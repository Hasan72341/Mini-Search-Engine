Model organisms are widely used to research human disease when human experimentation would be unfeasible or unethical. This strategy is made possible by the common descent of all living organisms, and the conservation of metabolic and developmental pathways and genetic material over the course of evolution.\nResearch using animal models has been central to most of the achievements of modern medicine. It has contributed most of the basic knowledge in fields such as human physiology and biochemistry, and has played significant roles in fields such as neuroscience and infectious disease. The results have included the near-eradication of polio and the development of organ transplantation, and have benefited both humans and animals. From 1910 to 1927, Thomas Hunt Morgan's work with the fruit fly \"Drosophila melanogaster\" identified chromosomes as the vector of inheritance for genes, and Eric Kandel wrote that Morgan's discoveries \"helped transform biology into an experimental science\". Research in model organisms led to further medical advances, such as the production of the diphtheria antitoxin and the 1922 discovery of insulin and its use in treating diabetes, which had previously meant death. Modern general anaesthetics such as halothane were also developed through studies on model organisms, and are necessary for modern, complex surgical operations. Other 20th-century medical advances and treatments that relied on research performed in animals include organ transplant techniques, the heart-lung machine, antibiotics, and the whooping cough vaccine.\nIn researching human disease, model organisms allow for better understanding the disease process without the added risk of harming an actual human. The species of the model organism is usually chosen so that it reacts to disease or its treatment in a way that resembles human physiology, even though care must be taken when generalizing from one organism to another. However, many drugs, treatments and cures for human diseases are developed in part with the guidance of animal models. Treatments for animal diseases have also been developed, including for rabies, anthrax, glanders, feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV), tuberculosis, Texas cattle fever, classical swine fever (hog cholera), heartworm, and other parasitic infections. Animal experimentation continues to be required for biomedical research, and is used with the aim of solving medical problems such as Alzheimer's disease, AIDS, multiple sclerosis, spinal cord injury, many headaches, and other conditions in which there is no useful \"in vitro\" model system available.\nModel organisms are drawn from all three domains of life, as well as viruses. One of the first model systems for molecular biology was the bacterium \"Escherichia coli\" (\"E. coli\"), a common constituent of the human digestive system. The mouse (\"Mus musculus\") has been used extensively as a model organism and is associated with many important biological discoveries of the 20th and 21st centuries. Other examples include baker's yeast (\"Saccharomyces cerevisiae\"), the T4 phage virus, the fruit fly \"Drosophila melanogaster\", the flowering plant \"Arabidopsis thaliana\", and guinea pigs (\"Cavia porcellus\"). Several of the bacterial viruses (bacteriophage) that infect \"E. coli\" also have been very useful for the study of gene structure and gene regulation (e.g. phages Lambda and T4). Disease models are divided into three categories: homologous animals have the same causes, symptoms and treatment options as would humans who have the same disease, isomorphic animals share the same symptoms and treatments, and predictive models are similar to a particular human disease in only a couple of aspects, but are useful in isolating and making predictions about mechanisms of a set of disease features.\nHistory.\nThe use of animals in research dates back to ancient Greece, with Aristotle (384\u2013322 BCE) and Erasistratus (304\u2013258 BCE) among the first to perform experiments on living animals. Discoveries in the 18th and 19th centuries included Antoine Lavoisier's use of a guinea pig in a calorimeter to prove that respiration was a form of combustion, and Louis Pasteur's demonstration of the germ theory of disease in the 1880s using anthrax in sheep.\nResearch using animal models has been central to most of the achievements of modern medicine. It has contributed most of the basic knowledge in fields such as human physiology and biochemistry, and has played significant roles in fields such as neuroscience and infectious disease. For example, the results have included the near-eradication of polio and the development of organ transplantation, and have benefited both humans and animals. From 1910 to 1927, Thomas Hunt Morgan's work with the fruit fly \"Drosophila melanogaster\" identified chromosomes as the vector of inheritance for genes. \"Drosophila\" became one of the first, and for some time the most widely used, model organisms, and Eric Kandel wrote that Morgan's discoveries \"helped transform biology into an experimental science\". \"D. melanogaster\" remains one of the most widely used eukaryotic model organisms. During the same time period, studies on mouse genetics in the laboratory of William Ernest Castle in collaboration with Abbie Lathrop led to generation of the DBA (\"dilute, brown and non-agouti\") inbred mouse strain and the systematic generation of other inbred strains. The mouse has since been used extensively as a model organism and is associated with many important biological discoveries of the 20th and 21st centuries.\nIn the late 19th century, Emil von Behring isolated the diphtheria toxin and demonstrated its effects in guinea pigs. He went on to develop an antitoxin against diphtheria in animals and then in humans, which resulted in the modern methods of immunization and largely ended diphtheria as a threatening disease. The diphtheria antitoxin is famously commemorated in the Iditarod race, which is modeled after the delivery of antitoxin in the 1925 serum run to Nome. The success of animal studies in producing the diphtheria antitoxin has also been attributed as a cause for the decline of the early 20th-century opposition to animal research in the United States.\nSubsequent research in model organisms led to further medical advances, such as Frederick Banting's research in dogs, which determined that the isolates of pancreatic secretion could be used to treat dogs with diabetes. This led to the 1922 discovery of insulin (with John Macleod) and its use in treating diabetes, which had previously meant death. John Cade's research in guinea pigs discovered the anticonvulsant properties of lithium salts, which revolutionized the treatment of bipolar disorder, replacing the previous treatments of lobotomy or electroconvulsive therapy. Modern general anaesthetics, such as halothane and related compounds, were also developed through studies on model organisms, and are necessary for modern, complex surgical operations.\nIn the 1940s, Jonas Salk used rhesus monkey studies to isolate the most virulent forms of the polio virus, which led to his creation of a polio vaccine. The vaccine, which was made publicly available in 1955, reduced the incidence of polio 15-fold in the United States over the following five years. Albert Sabin improved the vaccine by passing the polio virus through animal hosts, including monkeys; the Sabin vaccine was produced for mass consumption in 1963, and had virtually eradicated polio in the United States by 1965. It has been estimated that developing and producing the vaccines required the use of 100,000 rhesus monkeys, with 65 doses of vaccine produced from each monkey. Sabin wrote in 1992, \"Without the use of animals and human beings, it would have been impossible to acquire the important knowledge needed to prevent much suffering and premature death not only among humans, but also among animals.\"\nOther 20th-century medical advances and treatments that relied on research performed in animals include organ transplant techniques, the heart-lung machine, antibiotics, and the whooping cough vaccine. Treatments for animal diseases have also been developed, including for rabies, anthrax, glanders, feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV), tuberculosis, Texas cattle fever, classical swine fever (hog cholera), heartworm, and other parasitic infections. Animal experimentation continues to be required for biomedical research, and is used with the aim of solving medical problems such as Alzheimer's disease, AIDS, multiple sclerosis, spinal cord injury, many headaches, and other conditions in which there is no useful \"in vitro\" model system available.\nSelection.\nModels are those organisms with a wealth of biological data that make them attractive to study as examples for other species and/or natural phenomena that are more difficult to study directly. Continual research on these organisms focuses on a wide variety of experimental techniques and goals from many different levels of biology\u2014from ecology, behavior and biomechanics, down to the tiny functional scale of individual tissues, organelles and proteins. Inquiries about the DNA of organisms are classed as genetic models (with short generation times, such as the fruitfly and nematode worm), experimental models, and genomic parsimony models, investigating pivotal position in the evolutionary tree. Historically, model organisms include a handful of species with extensive genomic research data, such as the NIH model organisms.\nOften, model organisms are chosen on the basis that they are amenable to experimental manipulation. This usually will include characteristics such as short life-cycle, techniques for genetic manipulation (inbred strains, stem cell lines, and methods of transformation) and non-specialist living requirements. Sometimes, the genome arrangement facilitates the sequencing of the model organism's genome, for example, by being very compact or having a low proportion of junk DNA (e.g. yeast, arabidopsis, or pufferfish).\nWhen researchers look for an organism to use in their studies, they look for several traits. Among these are size, generation time, accessibility, manipulation, genetics, conservation of mechanisms, and potential economic benefit. As comparative molecular biology has become more common, some researchers have sought model organisms from a wider assortment of lineages on the tree of life.\nPhylogeny and genetic relatedness.\nThe primary reason for the use of model organisms in research is the evolutionary principle that all organisms share some degree of relatedness and genetic similarity due to common ancestry. The study of taxonomic human relatives, then, can provide a great deal of information about mechanisms and diseases within the human body that can be useful in medicine.\nVarious phylogenetic trees for vertebrates have been constructed using comparative proteomics, genetics, genomics, as well as the geochemical and fossil record. These estimations tell us that humans and chimpanzees last shared a common ancestor about 6\u00a0million years ago (mya). As our closest relatives, chimpanzees have a lot of potential to tell us about mechanisms of disease (and what genes may be responsible for human intelligence). However, chimpanzees are rarely used in research and are protected from highly invasive procedures. Rodents are the most common animal models. Phylogenetic trees estimate that humans and rodents last shared a common ancestor ~80-100mya. Despite this distant split, humans and rodents have far more similarities than they do differences. This is due to the relative stability of large portions of the genome, making the use of vertebrate animals particularly productive.\nGenomic data is used to make close comparisons between species and determine relatedness. Humans share about 99% of their genome with chimpanzees (98.7% with bonobos) and over 90% with the mouse. With so much of the genome conserved across species, it is relatively impressive that the differences between humans and mice can be accounted for in a few thousand genes, less than 1% (of ~19,000 total). Scientists have been able to take advantage of these similarities in generating experimental and predictive models of human disease.\nUse.\nThere are many model organisms. One of the first model systems for molecular biology was the bacterium \"Escherichia coli\", a common constituent of the human digestive system. Several of the bacterial viruses (bacteriophage) that infect \"E. coli\" also have been very useful for the study of gene structure and gene regulation (e.g. phages Lambda and T4). However, it is debated whether bacteriophages should be classified as organisms, because they lack metabolism and depend on functions of the host cells for propagation.\nIn eukaryotes, several yeasts, particularly \"Saccharomyces cerevisiae\" (\"baker's\" or \"budding\" yeast), have been widely used in genetics and cell biology, largely because they are quick and easy to grow. The cell cycle in a simple yeast is very similar to the cell cycle in humans and is regulated by homologous proteins. The fruit fly \"Drosophila melanogaster\" is studied, again, because it is easy to grow for an animal, has various visible congenital traits and has a polytene (giant) chromosome in its salivary glands that can be examined under a light microscope. The roundworm \"Caenorhabditis elegans\" is studied because it has very defined development patterns involving fixed numbers of cells, and it can be rapidly assayed for abnormalities.\nDisease models.\nAnimal models serving in research may have an existing, inbred or induced disease or injury that is similar to a human condition. These test conditions are often termed as animal models of disease. The use of animal models allows researchers to investigate disease states in ways which would be inaccessible in a human patient, performing procedures on the non-human animal that imply a level of harm that would not be considered ethical to inflict on a human. \nThe best models of disease are similar in etiology (mechanism of cause) and phenotype (signs and symptoms) to the human equivalent. However, complex human diseases can often be better understood in a simplified system where individual parts of the disease process are isolated and examined. For instance, behavioral analogues of anxiety or pain in laboratory animals can be used to screen and test new drugs for the treatment of these conditions in humans. A 2000 study found that animal models concorded (coincided on true positives and false negatives) with human toxicity in 71% of cases, with 63% for non-rodents alone and 43% for rodents alone.\nIn 1987, Davidson et al. suggested that the selection of an animal model for research be based on nine considerations. These include &lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;1) appropriateness as an analog, 2) transferability of information, 3) genetic uniformity of organisms, where applicable, 4) background knowledge of biological properties, 5) cost and availability, 6) generalizability of the results, 7) ease of and adaptability to experimental manipulation, 8) ecological consequences, and 9) ethical implications.\nAnimal models can be classified as homologous, isomorphic or predictive. Animal models can also be more broadly classified into four categories: 1) experimental, 2) spontaneous, 3) negative, 4) orphan.\nExperimental models are most common. These refer to models of disease that resemble human conditions in phenotype or response to treatment but are induced artificially in the laboratory. Some examples include:\nSpontaneous models refer to diseases that are analogous to human conditions that occur naturally in the animal being studied. These models are rare, but informative. Negative models essentially refer to control animals, which are useful for validating an experimental result. Orphan models refer to diseases for which there is no human analog and occur exclusively in the species studied.\nThe increase in knowledge of the genomes of non-human primates and other mammals that are genetically close to humans is allowing the production of genetically engineered animal tissues, organs and even animal species which express human diseases, providing a more robust model of human diseases in an animal model.\nAnimal models observed in the sciences of psychology and sociology are often termed animal models of behavior. It is difficult to build an animal model that perfectly reproduces the symptoms of depression in patients. Depression, as other mental disorders, consists of endophenotypes that can be reproduced independently and evaluated in animals. An ideal animal model offers an opportunity to understand molecular, genetic and epigenetic factors that may lead to depression. By using animal models, the underlying molecular alterations and the causal relationship between genetic or environmental alterations and depression can be examined, which would afford a better insight into the pathology of depression. In addition, animal models of depression are indispensable for identifying novel therapies for depression.\nImportant model organisms.\nModel organisms are drawn from all three domains of life, as well as viruses. The most widely studied prokaryotic model organism is \"Escherichia coli\" (\"E. coli\"), which has been intensively investigated for over 60 years. It is a common, gram-negative gut bacterium which can be grown and cultured easily and inexpensively in a laboratory setting. It is the most widely used organism in molecular genetics, and is an important species in the fields of biotechnology and microbiology, where it has served as the host organism for the majority of work with recombinant DNA.\nSimple model eukaryotes include baker's yeast (\"Saccharomyces cerevisiae\") and fission yeast (\"Schizosaccharomyces pombe\"), both of which share many characters with higher cells, including those of humans. For instance, many cell division genes that are critical for the development of cancer have been discovered in yeast. \"Chlamydomonas reinhardtii\", a unicellular green alga with well-studied genetics, is used to study photosynthesis and motility. \"C. reinhardtii\" has many known and mapped mutants and expressed sequence tags, and there are advanced methods for genetic transformation and selection of genes. \"Dictyostelium discoideum\" is used in molecular biology and genetics, and is studied as an example of cell communication, differentiation, and programmed cell death.\nAmong invertebrates, the fruit fly \"Drosophila melanogaster\" is famous as the subject of genetics experiments by Thomas Hunt Morgan and others. They are easily raised in the lab, with rapid generations, high fecundity, few chromosomes, and easily induced observable mutations. The nematode \"Caenorhabditis elegans\" is used for understanding the genetic control of development and physiology. It was first proposed as a model for neuronal development by Sydney Brenner in 1963, and has been extensively used in many different contexts since then. \"C. elegans\" was the first multicellular organism whose genome was completely sequenced, and as of 2012, the only organism to have its connectome (neuronal \"wiring diagram\") completed.\n\"Arabidopsis thaliana\" is currently the most popular model plant. Its small stature and short generation time facilitates rapid genetic studies, and many phenotypic and biochemical mutants have been mapped. \"A. thaliana\" was the first plant to have its genome sequenced.\nAmong vertebrates, guinea pigs (\"Cavia porcellus\") were used by Robert Koch and other early bacteriologists as a host for bacterial infections, becoming a byword for \"laboratory animal\", but are less commonly used today. The classic model vertebrate is currently the mouse (\"Mus musculus\"). Many inbred strains exist, as well as lines selected for particular traits, often of medical interest, e.g. body size, obesity, muscularity, and voluntary wheel-running behavior.\nThe rat (\"Rattus norvegicus\") is particularly useful as a toxicology model, and as a neurological model and source of primary cell cultures, owing to the larger size of organs and suborganellar structures relative to the mouse, while eggs and embryos from \"Xenopus tropicalis\" and \"Xenopus laevis\" (African clawed frog) are used in developmental biology, cell biology, toxicology, and neuroscience. Likewise, the zebrafish (\"Danio rerio\") has a nearly transparent body during early development, which provides unique visual access to the animal's internal anatomy during this time period. Zebrafish are used to study development, toxicology and toxicopathology, specific gene function and roles of signaling pathways.\nOther important model organisms and some of their uses include: T4 phage (viral infection), \"Tetrahymena thermophila\" (intracellular processes), maize (transposons), \"hydras\" (regeneration and morphogenesis), cats (neurophysiology), chickens (development), dogs (respiratory and cardiovascular systems), \"Nothobranchius furzeri\" (aging), non-human primates such as the rhesus macaque and chimpanzee (hepatitis, HIV, Parkinson's disease, cognition, and vaccines), and ferrets (SARS-CoV-2)\nSelected model organisms.\nThe organisms below have become model organisms because they facilitate the study of certain characteristics or because of their genetic accessibility. For example, \"E. coli\" was one of the first organisms for which genetic techniques such as transformation or genetic manipulation has been developed.\nThe genomes of all model species have been sequenced, including their mitochondrial/chloroplast genomes. Model organism databases exist to provide researchers with a portal from which to download sequences (DNA, RNA, or protein) or to access functional information on specific genes, for example the sub-cellular localization of the gene product or its physiological role.\nLimitations.\nMany animal models serving as test subjects in biomedical research, such as rats and mice, may be selectively sedentary, obese and glucose intolerant. This may confound their use to model human metabolic processes and diseases as these can be affected by dietary energy intake and exercise. Similarly, there are differences between the immune systems of model organisms and humans that lead to significantly altered responses to stimuli, although the underlying principles of genome function may be the same. The impoverished environments inside standard laboratory cages deny research animals of the mental and physical challenges are necessary for healthy emotional development. Without day-to-day variety, risks and rewards, and complex environments, some have argued that animal models are irrelevant models of human experience.\nMice differ from humans in several immune properties: mice are more resistant to some toxins than humans; have a lower total neutrophil fraction in the blood, a lower neutrophil enzymatic capacity, lower activity of the complement system, and a different set of pentraxins involved in the inflammatory process; and lack genes for important components of the immune system, such as IL-8, IL-37, TLR10, ICAM-3, etc. Laboratory mice reared in specific-pathogen-free (SPF) conditions usually have a rather immature immune system with a deficit of memory T cells. These mice may have limited diversity of the microbiota, which directly affects the immune system and the development of pathological conditions. Moreover, persistent virus infections (for example, herpesviruses) are activated in humans, but not in SPF mice, with septic complications and may change the resistance to bacterial coinfections. \"Dirty\" mice are possibly better suitable for mimicking human pathologies. In addition, inbred mouse strains are used in the overwhelming majority of studies, while the human population is heterogeneous, pointing to the importance of studies in interstrain hybrid, outbred, and nonlinear mice.\nUnintended bias.\nSome studies suggests that inadequate published data in animal testing may result in irreproducible research, with missing details about how experiments are done omitted from published papers or differences in testing that may introduce bias. Examples of hidden bias include a 2014 study from McGill University in Montreal, Canada which suggests that mice handled by men rather than women showed higher stress levels. Another study in 2016 suggested that gut microbiomes in mice may have an impact upon scientific research.\nAlternatives.\nEthical concerns, as well as the cost, maintenance and relative inefficiency of animal research has encouraged development of alternative methods for the study of disease. Cell culture, or \"in vitro\" studies, provide an alternative that preserves the physiology of the living cell, but does not require the sacrifice of an animal for mechanistic studies. Human, inducible pluripotent stem cells can also elucidate new mechanisms for understanding cancer and cell regeneration. Imaging studies (such as MRI or PET scans) enable non-invasive study of human subjects. Recent advances in genetics and genomics can identify disease-associated genes, which can be targeted for therapies.\nMany biomedical researchers argue that there is no substitute for a living organism when studying complex interactions in disease pathology or treatments.\nEthics.\nDebate about the ethical use of animals in research dates at least as far back as 1822 when the British Parliament under pressure from British and Indian intellectuals enacted the first law for animal protection preventing cruelty to cattle. This was followed by the Cruelty to Animals Act 1835 and the Cruelty to Animals Act 1849, which criminalized ill-treating, over-driving, and torturing animals. In 1876, under pressure from the National Anti-Vivisection Society, the Cruelty to Animals Act 1849 was amended to include regulations governing the use of animals in research. This new act stipulated that 1) experiments must be proven absolutely necessary for instruction, or to save or prolong human life; 2) animals must be properly anesthetized; and 3) animals must be killed as soon as the experiment is over. Today, these three principles are central to the laws and guidelines governing the use of animals and research. In the U.S., the Animal Welfare Act of 1970 (see also Laboratory Animal Welfare Act) set standards for animal use and care in research. This law is enforced by APHIS's Animal Care program.\nIn academic settings in which NIH funding is used for animal research, institutions are governed by the NIH Office of Laboratory Animal Welfare (OLAW). At each site, OLAW guidelines and standards are upheld by a local review board called the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC). All laboratory experiments involving living animals are reviewed and approved by this committee. In addition to proving the potential for benefit to human health, minimization of pain and distress, and timely and humane euthanasia, experimenters must justify their protocols based on the principles of Replacement, Reduction and Refinement.\n\"Replacement\" refers to efforts to engage alternatives to animal use. This includes the use of computer models, non-living tissues and cells, and replacement of \"higher-order\" animals (primates and mammals) with \"lower\" order animals (e.g. cold-blooded animals, invertebrates) wherever possible.\n\"'Reduction' refers to efforts to minimize the number of animals used in experiments, including avoiding unnecessary replication, and determining sample size via statistical power calculations so that the smallest number of animals necessary yields scientifically valid results.\nRefinement refers to efforts to make experimental design as painless and efficient as possible\u2014to minimize pain, suffering, distress or lasting harm\u2014by improving procedures, husbandry, analgesia, humane endpoints, and animal care.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

According to philosophical materialism, mind and consciousness are caused by physical processes, such as the neurochemistry of the human brain and nervous system, without which they cannot exist. Materialism directly contrasts with monistic idealism, according to which consciousness is the fundamental substance of nature.\nMaterialism is closely related to physicalism\u2014the view that all that exists is ultimately physical. Philosophical physicalism has evolved from materialism with the theories of the physical sciences to incorporate forms of physicality in addition to ordinary matter (e.g. spacetime, physical energies and forces, and exotic matter). Thus, some prefer the term \"physicalism\" to \"materialism\", while others use them as synonyms. Materialism is also related to naturalism\u2014the position that only natural laws and forces operate in the universe.\nDiscoveries of neural correlates between consciousness and the brain are taken as empirical support for materialism, but some philosophers of mind find that association fallacious or consider it compatible with non-materialist ideas. Alternative philosophies opposed or alternative to materialism or physicalism include idealism, pluralism, dualism, panpsychism, and other forms of monism.\nEpicureanism is a philosophy of materialism from classical antiquity that was a major forerunner of modern science. Classical atomism predates Epicurus: fifth\u2011century\u00a0BCE thinkers Leucippus and Democritus explained all change as the collisions of indivisible atoms moving in the void. Epicureanism refined this materialist picture. Epicurus held that everything\u2014including mind\u2014consists solely of atoms moving in the void; to explain how parallel falling atoms could ever meet, he postulated the \"clinamen\", an extremely slight lateral deviation that initiates collisions without invoking supernatural causes and that need not imply genuine indeterminism.\nIn late modern philosophy, German atheist anthropologist Ludwig Feuerbach signaled a new turn in materialism in his 1841 book \"The Essence of Christianity\", which presented a humanist account of religion as the outward projection of man's inward nature. Feuerbach introduced anthropological materialism, a version of materialism that views materialist anthropology as the universal science. \nFeuerbach's variety of materialism heavily influenced Karl Marx, who in the late 19th century elaborated the concept of historical materialism\u2014the basis for what Marx and Friedrich Engels outlined as \"scientific socialism\".\nOverview.\nMaterialism belongs to the class of monist ontology, and is thus different from ontological theories based on dualism or pluralism. For singular explanations of the phenomenal reality, materialism is in contrast to idealism, neutral monism, and spiritualism. It can also contrast with phenomenalism, vitalism, and dual-aspect monism. Its materiality can, in some ways, be linked to the concept of determinism, as espoused by Enlightenment thinkers.\nDespite the multiplicity of named schools, philosophy ultimately confronts a single binary: materialism versus idealism. Uncompromising materialism\u2014today often called physicalism\u2014holds that the universe is nothing but matter\u2011energy in motion; every phenomenon, from stellar fusion to human thought, is exhaustively explicable as organised interactions of physical entities. Matter is self\u2011moving and self\u2011organising, so it is scientifically superfluous to posit immaterial substances or disembodied minds. On this view, consciousness is a higher\u2011order property of certain complex material systems, not an ontological primitive. Idealism, by contrast, reverses the causal arrow: it elevates mind, spirit or abstract Forms to constitutive reality and demotes the material world to a mere appearance\u2014a position that historically provided philosophical cover for religion and other supernatural doctrines.\nAlthough the Western canon was long dominated by explicit idealists\u2014owing to church patronage, university control, and periodic censorship\u2014materialist undercurrents never disappeared. Thinkers including the pre\u2011Socratic atomists, Lucretius, Baruch Spinoza, Karl Marx, Friedrich Engels, and 20th\u2011century analytical naturalists advanced naturalistic explanations of mind and society even when such views risked condemnation or suppression. Contemporary debate subdivides materialism into identity theory, functional and non\u2011reductive physicalism, eliminative materialism, and other variants, but all share the thesis that whatever exists is ultimately physical.\nModern philosophical materialists extend the definition of other scientifically observable entities such as energy, forces, and the spacetime continuum; some philosophers, such as Mary Midgley, suggest that the concept of \"matter\" is elusive and poorly defined.\nDuring the 19th\u00a0century, Marx and Engels broadened materialism into a \"materialist conception of history\" centred on concrete human activity\u2014above all labour\u2014and on the institutions that such activity creates, reproduces, or abolishes. Drawing on both ancient atomism and the modern materialism of their day, they forged what was later called Marxist materialism, eliminating residual idealist elements and unifying the results into a single, consistently materialist worldview (see Modern philosophy). Marx\u2019s materialism long predated his encounter with G. W. F. Hegel. While still a student, Marx filled seven \"Notebooks on Epicurean Philosophy\" (1839), analysing Democritus, Epicurus, and Lucretius from an avowedly materialist standpoint. His 1841 doctoral dissertation, \"The Difference between the Democritean and Epicurean Philosophy of Nature\", likewise defends the ancient atomists against teleological speculation and affirms contingency in nature. These texts show Marx already rejecting metaphysical dualism a decade before \"Capital\".\nMarx's subsequent \"Critique of Hegel's Philosophy of Right\" (1843\u201344) therefore did not convert an idealist into a materialist; rather, the work borrows small aspects of Hegel\u2019s idealist dialectic, grounds it in material world, and rejects it very explicitly. Engels, arriving independently at a similar position, joined Marx in fusing Greek atomism, Enlightenment science, and a demystified dialectic into what later became known as Marxist materialism, a consistently materialist worldview that treats historical development as the product of human labour under definite social relations.\nNon-reductive materialism.\nMaterialism is often associated with reductionism, according to which the objects or phenomena individuated at one level of description, if they are genuine, must be explicable in terms of the objects or phenomena at some other level of description\u2014typically, at a more reduced level.\n\"Non-reductive materialism\" explicitly rejects this notion, taking the material constitution of all particulars to be consistent with the existence of real objects, properties or phenomena not explicable in the terms canonically used for the basic material constituents. Jerry Fodor held this view, according to which empirical laws and explanations in \"special sciences\" like psychology or geology are invisible from the perspective of basic physics.\nHistory.\nEarly history.\nBefore Common Era.\nMaterialism developed, possibly independently, in several geographically separated regions of Eurasia during what Karl Jaspers termed the Axial Age (c.\u00a0800\u2013200\u00a0BC).\nIn ancient Indian philosophy, materialism developed around 600\u00a0BC with the works of Ajita Kesakambali, Payasi, Kanada and the proponents of the C\u0101rv\u0101ka school of philosophy. Kanada became one of the early proponents of atomism. The Nyaya\u2013Vaisesika school (c.\u00a0600\u2013100\u00a0BC) developed one of the earliest forms of atomism (although their proofs of God and their positing that consciousness was not material precludes labelling them as materialists). Buddhist atomism and the Jaina school continued the atomic tradition.\nAncient Greek atomists like Leucippus, Democritus and Epicurus prefigure later materialists. The Latin poem \"De Rerum Natura\" by Lucretius (99\u00a0\u2013\u00a0c.\u00a055\u00a0BC) reflects the mechanistic philosophy of Democritus and Epicurus. According to this view, all that exists is matter and void, and all phenomena result from different motions and conglomerations of base material particles called \"atoms\" (literally \"indivisibles\"). \"De Rerum Natura\" provides mechanistic explanations for phenomena such as erosion, evaporation, wind, and sound. Famous principles like \"nothing can touch body but body\" first appeared in Lucretius's work. Democritus and Epicurus did not espouse a monist ontology, instead espousing the ontological separation of matter and space (i.e. that space is \"another kind\" of being).\nEarly Common Era.\nWang Chong (27\u00a0\u2013 c.\u00a0100\u00a0AD) was a Chinese thinker of the early Common Era said to be a materialist. Later Indian materialist Jayaraashi Bhatta (6th century) in his work \"Tattvopaplavasimha\" (\"The Upsetting of All Principles\") refuted the Ny\u0101ya S\u016btra epistemology. The materialistic C\u0101rv\u0101ka philosophy appears to have died out some time after 1400; when Madhavacharya compiled \"Sarva-dar\u015bana-samgraha\" (\"A Digest of All Philosophies\") in the 14th century, he had no C\u0101rv\u0101ka (or Lok\u0101yata) text to quote from or refer to.\nIn early 12th-century al-Andalus, Arabian philosopher Ibn Tufail (a.k.a.\u00a0Abubacer) discussed materialism in his philosophical novel, \"Hayy ibn Yaqdhan\" (\"Philosophus Autodidactus\"), while vaguely foreshadowing historical materialism.\nModern philosophy.\nIn France, Pierre Gassendi (1592\u20131665) represented the materialist tradition in opposition to the attempts of Ren\u00e9 Descartes (1596\u20131650) to provide the natural sciences with dualist foundations. There followed the materialist and atheist \"abb\u00e9\" Jean Meslier (1664\u20131729), along with the French materialists: Julien Offray de La Mettrie (1709\u20131751), Denis Diderot (1713\u20131784), \u00c9tienne Bonnot de Condillac (1714\u20131780), Claude Adrien Helv\u00e9tius (1715\u20131771), German-French Baron d'Holbach (1723\u20131789), and other French Enlightenment thinkers.\nIn England, materialism was developed in the philosophies of Francis Bacon (1561\u20131626), Thomas Hobbes (1588\u20131679), and John Locke (1632\u20131704). Scottish Enlightenment philosopher David Hume (1711\u20131776) became one of the most important materialist philosophers in the 18th century. John \"Walking\" Stewart (1747\u20131822) believed matter has a moral dimension, which had a major impact on the philosophical poetry of William Wordsworth (1770\u20131850).\nIn late modern philosophy, German atheist anthropologist Ludwig Feuerbach signaled a new turn in materialism in his 1841 book \"The Essence of Christianity\", which presented a humanist account of religion as the outward projection of man's inward nature. Feuerbach introduced anthropological materialism, a version of materialism that views materialist anthropology as the universal science.\nFeuerbach's variety of materialism heavily influenced Karl Marx, who in the late 19th century elaborated the concept of historical materialism\u2014the basis for what Marx and Friedrich Engels outlined as \"scientific socialism\":\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The materialist conception of history starts from the proposition that the production of the means to support human life and, next to production, the exchange of things produced, is the basis of all social structure; that in every society that has appeared in history, the manner in which wealth is distributed and society divided into classes or orders is dependent upon what is produced, how it is produced, and how the products are exchanged. From this point of view, the final causes of all social changes and political revolutions are to be sought, not in men's brains, not in men's better insights into eternal truth and justice, but in changes in the modes of production and exchange. They are to be sought, not in the philosophy, but in the economics of each particular epoch.\u2014\u200a\nThrough his \"Dialectics of Nature\" (1883), Engels later developed a \"materialist dialectic\" philosophy of nature, a worldview that Georgi Plekhanov, the father of Russian Marxism, called \"dialectical materialism\". In early 20th-century Russian philosophy, Vladimir Lenin further developed dialectical materialism in his 1909 book \"Materialism and Empirio-criticism\", which connects his opponents' political conceptions to their anti-materialist philosophies.\nA more naturalist-oriented materialist school of thought that developed in the mid-19th century was German materialism, which included Ludwig B\u00fcchner (1824\u20131899), the Dutch-born Jacob Moleschott (1822\u20131893), and Carl Vogt (1817\u20131895), even though they had different views on core issues such as the evolution and the origins of life.\nContemporary history.\nAnalytic philosophy.\nContemporary analytic philosophers (e.g. Daniel Dennett, Willard Van Orman Quine, Donald Davidson, and Jerry Fodor) operate within a broadly physicalist or scientific materialist framework, producing rival accounts of how best to accommodate the mind, including functionalism, anomalous monism, and identity theory.\nScientific materialism is often synonymous with, and has typically been described as, a reductive materialism. In the early 21st century, Paul and Patricia Churchland advocated a radically contrasting position (at least in regard to certain hypotheses): eliminative materialism. Eliminative materialism holds that some mental phenomena simply do not exist at all, and that talk of such phenomena reflects a spurious \"folk psychology\" and introspection illusion. A materialist of this variety might believe that a concept like \"belief\" has no basis in fact (e.g. the way folk science speaks of demon-caused illnesses).\nWith reductive materialism at one end of a continuum (our theories will \"reduce\" to facts) and eliminative materialism at the other (certain theories will need to be \"eliminated\" in light of new facts), revisionary materialism is somewhere in the middle.\nIn contrast, Christian List argues that the existence of first-person perspectives, i.e., one existing as oneself and not as someone else, refutes physicalism. List argues that since first-personal facts cannot supervene on physical facts, this refutes not only physicalism, but also most forms of dualism that have purely third-personal metaphysics.\nContinental philosophy.\nContemporary continental philosopher Gilles Deleuze has attempted to rework and strengthen classical materialist ideas. Contemporary theorists such as Manuel DeLanda, working with this reinvigorated materialism, have come to be classified as \"new materialists\". New materialism has become its own subfield, with courses on it at major universities, as well as numerous conferences, edited collections and monographs devoted to it.\nJane Bennett's 2010 book \"Vibrant Matter\" has been particularly instrumental in bringing theories of monist ontology and vitalism back into a critical theoretical fold dominated by poststructuralist theories of language and discourse. Scholars such as Mel Y. Chen and Zakiyyah Iman Jackson have critiqued this body of new materialist literature for neglecting to consider the materiality of race and gender in particular.\nM\u00e9tis scholar Zoe Todd, as well as Mohawk (Bear Clan, Six Nations) and Anishinaabe scholar Vanessa Watts, query the colonial orientation of the race for a \"new\" materialism. Watts in particular describes the tendency to regard matter as a subject of feminist or philosophical care as a tendency too invested in the reanimation of a Eurocentric tradition of inquiry at the expense of an Indigenous ethic of responsibility. Other scholars, such as Helene Vosters, echo their concerns and have questioned whether there is anything particularly \"new\" about \"new materialism\", as Indigenous and other animist ontologies have attested to what might be called the \"vibrancy of matter\" for centuries. Others, such as Thomas Nail, have critiqued \"vitalist\" versions of new materialism for depoliticizing \"flat ontology\" and being ahistorical.\nQuentin Meillassoux proposed \"speculative materialism\", a post-Kantian return to David Hume also based on materialist ideas.\nDefining \"matter\".\nThe nature and definition of \"matter\"\u2014like other key concepts in science and philosophy\u2014have occasioned much debate:\nOne challenge to the conventional concept of matter as tangible \"stuff\" came with the rise of field physics in the 19th century. Relativity shows that matter and energy (including the spatially distributed energy of fields) are interchangeable. This enables the ontological view that energy is \"prima materia\" and matter is one of its forms. In contrast, the Standard Model of particle physics uses quantum field theory to describe all interactions. On this view it could be said that fields are \"prima materia\" and the energy is a property of the field.\nAccording to the dominant cosmological model, the Lambda-CDM model, less than 5% of the universe's energy density is made up of the \"matter\" the Standard Model describes, and most of the universe is composed of dark matter and dark energy, with little agreement among scientists about what these are made of.\nWith the advent of quantum physics, some scientists believed the concept of matter had merely changed, while others believed the conventional position could no longer be maintained. Werner Heisenberg said: \"The ontology of materialism rested upon the illusion that the kind of existence, the direct 'actuality' of the world around us, can be extrapolated into the atomic range. This extrapolation, however, is impossible...atoms are not things.\"\nThe concept of matter has changed in response to new scientific discoveries. Thus materialism has no definite content independent of the particular theory of matter on which it is based. According to Noam Chomsky, any property can be considered material, if one defines matter such that it has that property.\nThe philosophical materialist Gustavo Bueno uses a more precise term than \"matter\", the \"stroma.\"\nIn \"Materialism and Empirio-Criticism\", Lenin argues that the truth of dialectical materialism is unrelated to any particular understanding of matter. To him, such changes actually confirm the dialectical form of materialism.\nPhysicalism.\nGeorge Stack distinguishes between materialism and physicalism: &lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;In the twentieth century, physicalism has emerged out of positivism. Physicalism restricts meaningful statements to physical bodies or processes that are verifiable or in principle verifiable. It is an empirical hypothesis that is subject to revision and, hence, lacks the dogmatic stance of classical materialism. Herbert Feigl defended physicalism in the United States and consistently held that mental states are brain states and that mental terms have the same referent as physical terms. The twentieth century has witnessed many materialist theories of the mental, and much debate surrounding them.\nBut not all conceptions of physicalism are tied to verificationist theories of meaning or direct realist accounts of perception. Rather, physicalists believe that no \"element of reality\" is missing from the mathematical formalism of our best description of the world. \"Materialist\" physicalists also believe that the formalism describes fields of insentience. In other words, the intrinsic nature of the physical is non-experiential.\nCriticism and alternatives.\nFrom contemporary physicists.\nRudolf Peierls, a physicist who played a major role in the Manhattan Project, rejected materialism: \"The premise that you can describe in terms of physics the whole function of a human being... including knowledge and consciousness, is untenable. There is still something missing.\"\nErwin Schr\u00f6dinger said, \"Consciousness cannot be accounted for in physical terms. For consciousness is absolutely fundamental. It cannot be accounted for in terms of anything else.\"\nWerner Heisenberg wrote: \"The ontology of materialism rested upon the illusion that the kind of existence, the direct 'actuality' of the world around us, can be extrapolated into the atomic range. This extrapolation, however, is impossible... Atoms are not things.\"\nQuantum mechanics.\nSome 20th-century physicists (e.g., Eugene Wigner and Henry Stapp), and some modern physicists and science writers (e.g., Stephen Barr, Paul Davies, and John Gribbin) have argued that materialism is flawed due to certain recent findings in physics, such as quantum mechanics and chaos theory. According to Gribbin and Davies (1991):\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Then came our Quantum theory, which totally transformed our image of matter. The old assumption that the microscopic world of atoms was simply a scaled-down version of the everyday world had to be abandoned. Newton's deterministic machine was replaced by a shadowy and paradoxical conjunction of waves and particles, governed by the laws of chance, rather than the rigid rules of causality. An extension of the quantum theory goes beyond even this; it paints a picture in which solid matter dissolves away, to be replaced by weird excitations and vibrations of invisible field energy.\nQuantum physics undermines materialism because it reveals that matter has far less \"substance\" than we might believe. But another development goes even further by demolishing Newton's image of matter as inert lumps. This development is the theory of chaos, which has recently gained widespread attention.\u2014\u200a\nDigital physics.\nThe objections of Davies and Gribbin are shared by proponents of digital physics, who view information rather than matter as fundamental. The physicist and proponent of digital physics John Archibald Wheeler wrote, \"all matter and all things physical are information-theoretic in origin and this is a participatory universe.\" Some founders of quantum theory, such as Max Planck, shared their objections. He wrote:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;As a man who has devoted his whole life to the most clear headed science, to the study of matter, I can tell you as a result of my research about atoms this much: There is no matter as such. All matter originates and exists only by virtue of a force which brings the particle of an atom to vibration and holds this most minute solar system of the atom together. We must assume behind this force the existence of a conscious and intelligent Mind. This Mind is the matrix of all matter.\u2014\u200a\nJames Jeans concurred with Planck, saying, \"The Universe begins to look more like a great thought than like a great machine. Mind no longer appears to be an accidental intruder into the realm of matter.\"\nPhilosophical objections.\nIn the \"Critique of Pure Reason\", Immanuel Kant argued against materialism in defending his transcendental idealism (as well as offering arguments against subjective idealism and mind\u2013body dualism). But Kant argues that change and time require an enduring substrate.\nPostmodern/poststructuralist thinkers also express skepticism about any all-encompassing metaphysical scheme. Philosopher Mary Midgley argues that materialism is a self-refuting idea, at least in its eliminative materialist form.\nVarieties of idealism.\nArguments for idealism, such as those of Hegel and Berkeley, often take the form of an argument against materialism; indeed, Berkeley's idealism was called \"immaterialism\". Now, matter can be argued to be redundant, as in bundle theory, and mind-independent properties can, in turn, be reduced to subjective percepts. Berkeley gives an example of the latter by pointing out that it is impossible to gather direct evidence of matter, as there is no direct experience of matter; all that is experienced is perception, whether internal or external. As such, matter's existence can only be inferred from the apparent (perceived) stability of perceptions; it finds absolutely no evidence in direct experience.\nIf matter and energy are seen as necessary to explain the physical world, but incapable of explaining mind, dualism results. Emergence, holism and process philosophy seek to ameliorate the perceived shortcomings of traditional (especially mechanistic) materialism without abandoning materialism entirely.\nMaterialism as methodology.\nSome critics object to materialism as part of an overly skeptical, narrow or reductivist approach to theorizing, rather than to the ontological claim that matter is the only substance. Particle physicist and Anglican theologian John Polkinghorne objects to what he calls \"promissory materialism\"\u2014claims that materialistic science will eventually succeed in explaining phenomena it has not so far been able to explain. Polkinghorne prefers \"dual-aspect monism\" to materialism.\nSome scientific materialists have been criticized for failing to provide clear definitions of matter, leaving the term \"materialism\" without any definite meaning. Noam Chomsky states that since the concept of matter may be affected by new scientific discoveries, as has happened in the past, scientific materialists are being dogmatic in assuming the opposite.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\na. &lt;templatestyles src=\"Citation/styles.css\"/&gt;^ Indeed, it has been noted it is difficult if not impossible to define one category without contrasting it with the other.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

As the name suggests, microelectronics relates to the study and manufacture (or microfabrication) of very small electronic designs and components. Usually, but not always, this means micrometre-scale or smaller. These devices are typically made from semiconductor materials. Many components of a normal electronic design are available in a microelectronic equivalent. These include transistors, capacitors, inductors, resistors, diodes and (naturally) insulators and conductors can all be found in microelectronic devices. Unique wiring techniques such as wire bonding are also often used in microelectronics because of the unusually small size of the components, leads and pads. This technique requires specialized equipment and is expensive.\nDigital integrated circuits (ICs) consist of billions of transistors, resistors, diodes, and capacitors. Analog circuits commonly contain resistors and capacitors as well. Inductors are used in some high frequency analog circuits, but tend to occupy larger chip area due to their lower reactance at low frequencies. Gyrators can replace them in many applications.\nAs techniques have improved, the scale of microelectronic components has continued to decrease. At smaller scales, the relative impact of intrinsic circuit properties such as interconnections may become more significant. These are called parasitic effects, and the goal of the microelectronics design engineer is to find ways to compensate for or to minimize these effects, while delivering smaller, faster, and cheaper devices.\nToday, microelectronics design is largely aided by electronic design automation (EDA) software.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "19378", "revid": "19014806", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19378", "title": "Mind", "text": "Totality of psychological phenomena\nThe mind is that which thinks, feels, perceives, imagines, remembers, and wills. It covers the totality of mental phenomena, including both conscious processes, through which an individual is aware of external and internal circumstances, and unconscious processes, which can influence an individual without intention or awareness. The mind plays a central role in most aspects of human life, but its exact nature is disputed. Some characterizations focus on internal aspects, saying that the mind transforms information and is not directly accessible to outside observers. Others stress its relation to outward conduct, understanding mental phenomena as dispositions to engage in observable behavior.\nThe mind\u2013body problem is the challenge of explaining the relation between matter and mind. Traditionally, mind and matter were often thought of as distinct substances that could exist independently from one another. The dominant philosophical position since the 20th century has been physicalism, which says that everything is material, meaning that minds are certain aspects or features of some material objects. The evolutionary history of the mind is tied to the development of nervous systems, which led to the formation of brains. As brains became more complex, the number and capacity of mental functions increased with particular brain areas dedicated to specific mental functions. Individual human minds also develop over time as they learn from experience and pass through psychological stages in the process of aging. Some people are affected by mental disorders, in which certain mental capacities do not function as they should.\nIt is widely accepted that at least some non-human animals have some form of mind, but it is controversial to which animals this applies. The topic of artificial minds poses similar challenges and theorists discuss the possibility and consequences of creating them using computers.\nThe main fields of inquiry studying the mind include psychology, neuroscience, cognitive science, and philosophy of mind. They tend to focus on different aspects of the mind and employ different methods of investigation, ranging from empirical observation and neuroimaging to conceptual analysis and thought experiments. The mind is relevant to many other fields, including epistemology, anthropology, religion, and education.\nDefinition.\nThe mind is the totality of psychological phenomena and capacities, encompassing both conscious and unconscious states. The term \"mind\" is sometimes used in a narrow meaning to refer only to cognitive functions associated with perception, reasoning, awareness, and memory. In a broader sense, it also includes processes like feeling, motivation, and behavior. The precise definition of mind is disputed. While it is generally accepted that some non-human animals also have minds, there is no agreement on where exactly the boundary lies. Despite these disputes, there is wide agreement that the mind plays a central role in most aspects of human life as the seat of consciousness, emotions, thoughts, and sense of personal identity. Various fields of inquiry study the mind; the main ones include psychology, cognitive science, neuroscience, and philosophy of mind.\nThe words \"psyche\" and \"mentality\" are usually used as synonyms of \"mind\". They are often employed in overlapping ways with the terms \"soul\", \"spirit\", \"cognition\", \"intellect\", \"intelligence\", and \"brain\", but their meanings are not exactly the same. Some religions understand the soul as an independent entity that constitutes the immaterial essence of human beings, is of divine origin, survives bodily death, and is immortal. The word \"spirit\" has various additional meanings not directly associated with mind, such as a vital principle animating living beings or a supernatural being inhabiting objects or places. Cognition encompasses certain types of mental processes in which knowledge is acquired and information is processed. The intellect is one mental capacity responsible for thought, reasoning, and understanding and is closely related to intelligence as the ability to acquire, understand, and apply knowledge. The brain is the physical organ responsible for most or all mental functions.\nThe modern English word \"mind\" originates from the Old English word , meaning \"memory\". This term gave rise to the Middle English words , , and , resulting in a slow expansion of meaning to cover all mental capacities. The original meaning is preserved in expressions like \"call to mind\" and \"keep in mind\". Cognates include the Old High German , the Gothic , the ancient Greek , the Latin , and the Sanskrit .\nForms.\nThe mind encompasses many phenomena, including perception, memory, thought, imagination, motivation, emotion, attention, learning, and consciousness. Perception is the process of interpreting and organizing sensory information to become acquainted with the environment. This information is acquired through sense organs receptive to various types of physical stimuli, which correspond to different forms of perception, such as vision, hearing, touch, smell, and taste. The sensory information received serves as raw data that is filtered and processed to actively constitute the experience of the world and the objects within it. This complex process underlying perceptual experience is shaped by many factors, including the individual's past experiences, cultural background, beliefs, knowledge, and expectations.\nMemory is the mechanism of storing and retrieving information. Episodic memory handles information about specific past events in one's life and makes this information available in the present. When a person remembers what they had for dinner yesterday, they employ episodic memory. Semantic memory handles general knowledge about the world that is not tied to any specific episodes. When a person recalls that the capital of Japan is Tokyo, they usually employ semantic memory to access this general information without remembering the specific instance when they learned it. Procedural memory is memory of how to do things, such as riding a bicycle or playing a musical instrument. Another distinction is between short-term memory, which holds information for brief periods, usually with the purpose of completing specific cognitive tasks, and long-term memory, which can store information for extended periods, potentially lasting a lifetime.\nThinking involves the processing of information and the manipulation of concepts and ideas. It is goal-oriented and often happens in response to experiences by aiming at making sense of them, organizing their information, and deciding how to respond. Logical reasoning is a form of thinking that starts from a set of premises and aims to arrive at a conclusion supported by these premises. This is the case when deducing that \"Socrates is mortal\" from the premises \"Socrates is a man\" and \"all men are mortal\". Problem-solving is a closely related process that consists of several steps, such as identifying a problem, developing a plan to address it, implementing the plan, and assessing whether it worked. Thinking in the form of decision-making involves considering possible courses of action to assess which one is the most beneficial. As a symbolic process, thinking is deeply intertwined with language, and some theorists hold that all thought happens through the medium of language.\nImagination is a creative process of internally generating mental images, ideas, experiences, and related phenomena. Unlike perception, it does not directly depend on the stimulation of sensory organs. Similar to dreaming, these mental constructs are often derived from previous experiences but can include novel combinations and elements. Imagination happens during daydreaming and plays a key role in art and literature. Additionally, it can also be used to come up with novel solutions to real-world problems.\nMotivation is an internal state that propels individuals to initiate, continue, or terminate goal-directed behavior. It is responsible for the formation of intentions to perform actions and affects what goals someone pursues, how much effort they invest in the activity, and how long they engage in it. Motivation is affected by emotions, which are temporary experiences of positive or negative feelings like joy or anger. They are directed at and evaluate specific events, persons, or situations. They usually come together with certain physiological and behavioral responses.\nAttention is an aspect of other mental processes in which mental resources like awareness are directed towards certain features of experience and away from others. This happens when a driver focuses on traffic while ignoring billboards on the side of the road. Attention can be controlled voluntarily in the pursuit of specific goals but can also be diverted involuntarily when a strong stimulus captures a person's attention. Attention is relevant to learning, which is the ability of the mind to acquire new information and permanently modify its understanding and behavioral patterns. Individuals learn by undergoing experiences, which helps them adapt to the environment.\nConscious and unconscious.\nAn influential distinction is between conscious and unconscious mental processes. Consciousness is the awareness of external and internal circumstances. It encompasses a wide variety of states, such as perception, thinking, fantasizing, dreaming, and altered states of consciousness. In the case of phenomenal consciousness, the awareness involves a direct and qualitative experience of mental phenomena, like the auditory experience of attending a concert. Access consciousness, by contrast, refers to an awareness of information that is accessible to other mental processes but not necessarily part of current experience. For example, the information stored in a memory may be accessible when drawing conclusions or guiding actions even when the person is not explicitly thinking about it.\nUnconscious or nonconscious mental processes operate without the individual's awareness but can still influence mental phenomena on the level of thought, feeling, and action. Some theorists distinguish between preconscious, subconscious, and unconscious states depending on their accessibility to conscious awareness. When applied to the overall state of a person rather than specific processes, the term \"unconscious\" implies that the person lacks any awareness of their environment and themselves, like during a coma. The unconscious mind plays a central role in psychoanalysis as the part of the mind that contains thoughts, memories, and desires not accessible to conscious introspection. According to Sigmund Freud, the psychological mechanism of repression keeps disturbing phenomena, like unacceptable sexual and aggressive impulses, from entering consciousness to protect the individual. Psychoanalytic theory studies symptoms caused by this process and therapeutic methods to avoid them by making the repressed thoughts accessible to conscious awareness.\nOther distinctions.\nMental states are often divided into qualitative and propositional states. Qualitative states are experiences of sensory qualities, typically referred to as qualia, like colors, sounds, smells, pains, itches, and hunger. Propositional states involve an attitude towards a content that can be expressed by a declarative sentence. When a person believes that it is raining, they have the propositional attitude of belief towards the content \"it is raining\". Different types of propositional states are characterized by different attitudes towards their content. For instance, it is also possible to hope, fear, desire, or doubt that it is raining.\nA mental state or process is rational if it is based on good reasons or follows the norms of rationality. For example, a belief is rational if it relies on strong supporting evidence and a decision is rational if it follows careful deliberation of all the relevant factors and outcomes. Mental states are irrational if they fail to adhere to these standards, such as beliefs caused by faulty reasoning, superstition, or cognitive biases, and decisions that give into temptations against one's best judgment. Mental states that fall outside the domain of rational evaluation are arational rather than irrational. There is controversy regarding which mental phenomena lie outside this domain; suggested examples include sensory impressions, feelings, desires, and involuntary responses.\nAnother contrast is between dispositional and occurrent mental states. A dispositional state is a power that is not exercised. If a person believes that cats have whiskers but does not think about this fact, it is a dispositional belief. By activating the belief to consciously think about it or use it in other cognitive processes, it becomes occurrent until it is no longer actively considered or used. The great majority of a person's beliefs are dispositional most of the time.\nFaculties and modules.\nTraditionally, the mind was subdivided into mental faculties understood as capacities to perform certain functions or bring about certain processes. An influential subdivision in the history of philosophy was between the faculties of intellect and will. The intellect encompasses mental phenomena aimed at understanding the world and determining what to believe or what is true; the will is concerned with practical matters and what is good, reflected in phenomena like desire, decision-making, and action. The exact number and nature of the mental faculties are disputed. More fine-grained distinctions divide the intellect into the faculties of understanding and judgment or add sensibility as an additional faculty responsible for sensory impressions.\nIn contrast to the traditional view, more recent approaches analyze the mind in terms of mental modules rather than faculties. A mental module is an inborn system of the brain that automatically performs a particular function within a specific domain without conscious awareness or effort. In contrast to faculties, the concept of mental modules is normally used to provide a more limited explanation. It is typically restricted to certain low-level cognitive processes without trying to explain how they are integrated into higher-level processes such as conscious reasoning. Many low-level cognitive processes responsible for visual perception have this automatic and unconscious nature. In the case of visual illusions like the M\u00fcller-Lyer illusion, the underlying processes continue their operation and the illusion persists even after a person has become aware of the illusion, indicating the mechanical and involuntary nature of the process. Other examples of mental modules concern cognitive processes responsible for language processing and facial recognition.\nTheories of the nature of mind.\nTheories of the nature of mind aim to determine what all mental states have in common. They seek to discover the \"mark of the mental\", that is, the criteria that distinguish mental from non-mental phenomena. Epistemic criteria say that the unique feature of mental states is how people know about them. For example, if a person has a toothache, they have direct or non-inferential knowledge that they are in pain. But they do not have this kind of knowledge about non-mental phenomena such as the physical causes of the pain, and may have to consult external evidence through visual inspection or a visit to the dentist. Another feature commonly ascribed to mental states is that they are private, meaning that others do not have direct access to a person's mental state. As a result, external observers have to make inferences from other indicators, like the pain behavior of the person with the toothache. Some philosophers claim that knowledge of some or all mental states is infallible, for instance, that a person cannot be mistaken about whether they are in pain.\nA related view asserts that all mental states are either conscious or accessible to consciousness. According to this view, when a person actively remembers the fact that the Eiffel Tower is in Paris then this state is mental because it is part of consciousness. When the person does not think about it, this belief is still considered a mental state because the person could bring it to consciousness by thinking about it. This view denies the existence of a \"deep unconsciousness\", that is, unconscious mental states that cannot in principle become conscious.\nAnother theory says that intentionality is the mark of the mental. A state is intentional if it refers to or represents something. For example, if a person perceives a piano or thinks about it then the mental state is intentional because it refers to a piano. This view distinguishes between the original intentionality of mental phenomena and the derivative intentionality of some non-mental phenomena. According to this view, the ability of words and pictures to refer to things derives from the fact that they can evoke mental states. In this sense, only mental states have original intentionality, whereas words and pictures have derivative intentionality since they would not refer if divorced from linguistic conventions or visual interpretations. Some philosophers disagree that all mental states are intentional, citing itches, tickles, and pains as possible exceptions.\nAccording to behaviorism, mental states are dispositions to engage in certain publicly observable behavior as a reaction to particular external stimuli. This view implies that mental phenomena are not private internal states but are accessible to empirical observation like regular physical phenomena. Functionalism agrees that mental states do not depend on the exact internal constitution of the mind and characterizes them instead in regard to their functional role. The functional role of a mental state is the way it interacts with other phenomena. For example, pain is often caused by bodily injury and typically leads to pain behavior, like moaning, and a desire to stop the pain. As a result, injury, pain behavior, and desire are part of the functional role of pain. Computationalism, a similar theory prominent in cognitive science, defines minds in terms of cognitions and computations as information processors.\nTheories under the umbrella of externalism emphasize the mind's dependency on the environment. According to this view, mental states and their contents are at least partially determined by external circumstances. For example, some forms of content externalism hold that it can depend on external circumstances whether a belief refers to one object or another. The position of embedded cognition emphasizes that mental processes happen in the context of a physical and social environments. It examines how this context shapes cognitive activity. The extended mind thesis states that external circumstances not only influence the mind but are part of it. In this sense, a diary is part of the mind by helping it store information. Similarly, an electronic calculator is part of the mind by helping it perform calculations. The closely related view of enactivism holds that mental processes involve an interaction between organism and environment. A theory from the field of embodied cognition states that the connection to a body is an essential feature of minds. It asserts that certain aspects of the body outside the nervous system, like motor capacities, are part of the mind.\nRelation to matter.\nMind\u2013body problem.\nThe mind\u2013body problem is the difficulty of providing a general explanation of the relationship between mind and body, for example, of the link between thoughts and brain processes. Despite their different characteristics, mind and body interact with each other, like when a bodily change causes mental discomfort or when a limb moves because of an intention. The mind\u2013body problem came to particular prominence in modern philosophy as a result of Descartes' metaphysical distinction between mind and body. Earlier philosophers typically did not see mind and body as contrasting principles. Following Descartes' philosophy, minds were often conceived as substantial entities able to exist on their own. Now they are more commonly seen as capacities rather than independent entities.\nAccording to substance dualism, minds or souls exist as independent entities in addition to material things. This view implies that, at least in principle, minds can exist without bodies. Property dualism is another view, saying that mind and matter are not independent entities but different properties that apply to the same individual. Monist views, by contrast, state that reality is made up of only one kind. According to metaphysical idealists, for instance, everything is mental. They understand material things as mental phenomena, for example, as ideas or perceptions. According to neutral monists, by contrast, the world is at its most fundamental level neither physical nor mental but neutral. They see physical and mental concepts as convenient but superficial ways to describe reality.\nThe monist view most influential since the 20th century has been physicalism, also referred to as materialism, which states that everything is physical. According to eliminative physicalism, there are no mental phenomena, meaning that things like beliefs and desires do not form part of reality. Reductive physicalists defend a less radical position: they say that mental states exist but can, at least in principle, be completely described by physics without the need for special sciences like psychology. For example, behaviorists aim to analyze mental concepts in terms of observable behavior without resorting to internal mental states. Type identity theory also belongs to reductive physicalism and says that mental states are the same as brain states. While non-reductive physicalists agree that everything is physical, they say that mental concepts describe physical reality on a more abstract level that cannot be articulated by physics. According to functionalism, mental concepts do not describe the internal constitution of physical substances but functional roles within a system. One consequence of this view is that mind does not depend on brains but can also be realized by other systems that implement the corresponding functional roles, possibly also computers. A different approach, found in the tradition of phenomenology, aims to dissolve the mind\u2013body problem by arguing that it is based on an artificial dichotomy not present in the phenomenological description of experience.\nThe hard problem of consciousness is a central aspect of the mind\u2013body problem: it is the challenge of explaining how physical states can give rise to conscious experience. Its main difficulty lies in the subjective and qualitative nature of consciousness, which is unlike typical physical processes. The hard problem of consciousness contrasts with the \"easy problems\" of explaining how certain aspects of consciousness function, such as perception, memory, or learning.\nBrain areas and processes.\nAnother approach to the relation between mind and matter uses empirical observation to study how the brain works and which brain areas and processes are associated with specific mental phenomena. The brain is the central organ of the nervous system and is present in all vertebrates and the majority of invertebrates. The human brain is of particular complexity and consists of about 86 billion neurons, which communicate with one another via synapses. They form a complex neural network and cognitive processes emerge from their electrical and chemical interactions. The human brain is divided into regions that are associated with different functions. The main regions are the hindbrain, midbrain, and forebrain. Many biological functions associated with basic survival are the responsibility of the hindbrain and midbrain. Higher mental functions, ranging from thoughts to motivation, are primarily localized in the forebrain.\nThe primary operations of many of the main mental phenomena are located in specific areas of the forebrain. The prefrontal cortex is responsible for executive functions, such as planning, decision-making, problem-solving, and working memory. The sensory cortex processes and interprets sensory information, with different subareas dedicated to different senses, like the visual and the auditory areas. A central function of the hippocampus is the formation and retrieval of long-term memories. It belongs to the limbic system, which plays a key role in the regulation of emotions through the amygdala. The motor cortex is responsible for planning, executing, and controlling voluntary movements. Broca's area is a separate region dedicated to speech production. The activity of the different areas is additionally influenced by neurotransmitters, which are signaling molecules that enhance or inhibit different types of neural communication. For example, dopamine influences motivation and pleasure while serotonin affects mood and appetite.\nThe close interrelation of brain processes and the mind is seen by the effect that physical changes of the brain have on the mind. For instance, the consumption of psychoactive drugs, like caffeine, antidepressants, alcohol, and psychedelics, temporarily affects brain chemistry with diverse effects on the mind, ranging from increased attention to mood changes, impaired cognitive functions, and hallucinations. Long-term changes to the brain in the form of neurodegenerative diseases and brain injuries can lead to permanent alterations in mental functions. Alzheimer's disease in its first stage deteriorates the hippocampus, reducing the ability to form new memories and recall existing ones. An often-cited case of the effects of brain injury is Phineas Gage, whose prefrontal cortex was severely damaged during a work accident when an iron rod pierced through his skull and brain. Gage survived the accident but his personality and social attitude changed significantly as he became more impulsive, irritable, and anti-social while showing little regard for social conventions and an impaired ability to plan and make rational decisions. Not all these changes were permanent and Gage managed to recover and adapt in some areas.\nDevelopment.\nEvolution.\nThe mind has a long evolutionary history starting with the development of the nervous system and the brain. While it is generally accepted today that mind is not exclusive to humans and various non-human animals have some form of mind, there is no consensus at which point exactly the mind emerged. The evolution of mind is usually explained in terms of natural selection: genetic variations responsible for new or improved mental capacities, such as better perception or social dispositions, have an increased chance of being passed on to future generations if they are beneficial to survival and reproduction.\nMinimal forms of information processing are already found in the earliest forms of life 4 to 3.5 billion years ago, like the abilities of bacteria and eukaryotic unicellular organisms to sense the environment, store this information, and react to it. Nerve cells emerged with the development of multicellular organisms more than 600 million years ago as a way to process and transmit information. About 600 to 550 million years ago, an evolutionary bifurcation happened into radially symmetric organisms with ring-shaped nervous systems or a nerve net, like jellyfish, and organisms with bilaterally symmetric bodies, whose nervous systems tend to be more centralized. About 540 million years ago, vertebrates evolved within the group of bilaterally organized organisms. Vertebrates, like birds and mammals, have a central nervous system including a complex brain with specialized functions. Invertebrates, like clams and insects, typically either have no or relatively simple brains. In the course of evolution, the brains of vertebrates tended to grow and the specialization of different brain areas tended to increase. These developments are closely related to changes in limb structures, sense organs, and living conditions with a close correspondence between the size of a brain area and the importance of its function to the organism. An important step in the evolution of mammals about 200 million years ago was the development of the neocortex, which is responsible for many higher-order brain functions.\nThe size of the brain relative to the body further increased with the development of primates, like monkeys, about 65 million years ago and later with the emergence of the first hominins about 7\u20135 million years ago. Anatomically modern humans appeared about 300,000 to 200,000 years ago. Various theories of the evolutionary processes responsible for human intelligence have been proposed. The social intelligence hypothesis says that the evolution of the human mind was triggered by the increased importance of social life and its emphasis on mental abilities associated with empathy, knowledge transfer, and meta-cognition. According to the ecological intelligence hypothesis, the main value of the increased mental capacities comes from their advantages in dealing with a complex physical environment through processes like behavioral flexibility, learning, and tool use. Other suggested mechanisms include the effects of a changed diet with energy-rich food and general benefits from an increased speed and efficiency of information processing. Some models propose that another major cognitive shift occurred possibly 50,000 to 40,000 years ago. Called \"behavioral modernity\", it is associated with the emergence of new or improved mental abilities, such as technological innovativeness, abstract thinking, the use of symbols, planning, and social coordination.\nIndividual.\nBesides the development of mind in general in the course of history, individual human minds also develop in the course of their lifetime. Some of the individual changes vary from person to person as a form of learning from experience, like forming specific memories or acquiring particular behavioral patterns. Others are more universal developments as psychological stages that all or most humans go through as they pass through early childhood, adolescence, adulthood, and old age. These developments cover various areas, including intellectual, sensorimotor, linguistic, emotional, social, and moral developments. Some factors affect the development of mind before birth, such as nutrition, maternal stress, and exposure to harmful substances like alcohol during pregnancy.\nEarly childhood is marked by rapid developments as infants learn voluntary control over their bodies and interact with their environment on a basic level. Typically after about one year, this covers abilities like walking, recognizing familiar faces, and producing individual words. On the emotional and social levels, they develop attachments with their primary caretakers and express emotions ranging from joy and surprise to fear and anger. An influential theory by Jean Piaget divides the cognitive development of children into four stages. The sensorimotor stage from birth until two years is concerned with sensory impressions and motor activities while learning that objects remain in existence even when not observed. In the preoperational stage until seven years, children learn to interpret and use symbols in an intuitive manner. They start employing logical reasoning to physical objects in the concrete operational stage until eleven years and extend this capacity in the following formal operational stage to abstract ideas, probabilities, and possibilities. Other important processes shaping the mind in this period are socialization and enculturation, at first through primary caretakers and later through peers and the schooling system.\nPsychological transformations during adolescence are provoked by physiological developments and by being confronted with a different social situation in the form of new expectations from others. An important factor in this period is change to the self-concept, which can take the form of an identity crisis. This process typically involves developing individuality and independence from parents while at the same time seeking closeness and conformity with friends and peers. Further developments in this period include improvements to the reasoning ability and the formation of a principled moral viewpoint.\nThe mind also changes during adulthood but in a less rapid and pronounced manner. Reasoning and problem-solving skills improve during early and middle adulthood. Some people experience the mid-life transition as a midlife crisis involving an inner conflict about personal identity, associated with anxiety, a sense of a lack of accomplishments in life, or an awareness of mortality. Intellectual faculties tend to decline in later adulthood, specifically the ability to learn complex unfamiliar tasks and later also the ability to remember. At the same time, people tend to become more inward-looking and cautious.\nNon-human.\nAnimal.\nIt is commonly acknowledged today that animals have some form of mind, but it is controversial to which animals this applies and how their mind differs from the human mind. Different conceptions of the mind lead to different responses to this problem. When understood in a very wide sense as the capacity to process information, the mind is present in all forms of life, including insects, plants, and individual cells. On the other side of the spectrum are views that deny the existence of mentality in most or all non-human animals based on the idea that they lack key mental capacities, like abstract rationality and symbolic language. The status of animal minds is highly relevant to the field of ethics since it affects the treatment of animals, including the topic of animal rights.\nDiscontinuity views state that the minds of non-human animals are fundamentally different from human minds and often point to higher mental faculties, like thinking, reasoning, and deliberate decision-making. This outlook is reflected in the traditionally influential position of defining humans as \"rational animals\" as opposed to all other animals. Continuity views, by contrast, emphasize similarities and see cognitive differences in degree rather than kind. Central considerations for this position are the shared evolutionary origin and organic similarities on the level of the brain and nervous system. Observable behavior is another key factor, such as problem-solving skills, animal communication, and reactions to and expressions of pain and pleasure. Of particular importance are the questions of consciousness and sentience, that is, to what extent non-human animals have a subjective experience of the world and are capable of suffering and feeling joy.\nArtificial.\nSome of the difficulties of assessing animal minds are also reflected in the topic of artificial minds. It includes the question of whether computer systems implementing artificial intelligence should be considered a form of mind. This idea is consistent with some theories of the nature of mind, such as functionalism and its claim that mental concepts describe functional roles. It asserts that the functions implemented by biological brains could in principle also be implemented by artificial devices.\nThe Turing test, proposed by Alan Turing (1912\u20131954), is a traditionally influential procedure to test artificial intelligence: a person exchanges messages with two parties, one of them a human and the other a computer. The computer passes the test if it is not possible to reliably tell which party is the human and which one the computer. While there are computer programs today that may pass the Turing test, this alone is usually not accepted as conclusive proof of mindedness. For some aspects of mind, it is controversial whether computers can, in principle, implement them, such as desires, feelings, consciousness, and free will.\nThis problem is often discussed through the contrast between weak and strong artificial intelligence. Weak or narrow artificial intelligence is limited to specific mental capacities or functions. It focuses on a particular task or a narrow set of tasks, like autonomous driving, speech recognition, or theorem proving. The goal of strong AI, also termed \"artificial general intelligence\", is to create a complete artificial person that has all the mental capacities of humans, including consciousness, emotion, and reason. It is controversial whether strong AI is possible; influential arguments against it include John Searle's Chinese Room Argument and Hubert Dreyfus's critique based on Heideggerian philosophy.\nMental health and disorder.\nMental health is a state of mind characterized by internal equilibrium and well-being in which mental capacities function as they should. Some theorists emphasize positive features such as the abilities of a person to realize their potential, express and modulate emotions, cope with adverse life situations, and fulfill their social role. Negative definitions, by contrast, see mental health as the absence of mental disorders. Mental disorders are abnormal patterns of thought, emotion, or behavior. These patterns deviate not only from how a mental capacity works on average but from how it should work while usually causing some form of distress. The content of those norms is controversial and there are differences from culture to culture. For instance, homosexuality was historically considered a mental disorder by medical professionals, a view which only changed in the second half of the 20th century.\nThere is a great variety of mental disorders, each associated with a different form of malfunctioning. Anxiety disorders involve intense and persistent fear that is disproportionate to the actual threat and significantly impairs everyday life. An example is social phobia, which involves irrational fear of certain social situations. Anxiety disorders also include obsessive\u2013compulsive disorder, for which the anxiety manifests in the form of intrusive thoughts that the person tries to alleviate by following compulsive rituals. Mood disorders cause intense moods or mood swings that are inconsistent with the external circumstances and can last for long periods. For instance, people affected by bipolar disorder experience extreme mood swings between manic states of euphoria and depressive states of hopelessness. Personality disorders are characterized by enduring patterns of maladaptive behavior that significantly impair regular life. Paranoid personality disorder, for example, leads people to be deeply suspicious of the motives of others without rational basis. Psychotic disorders are among the most severe mental illnesses and involve a distorted relation to reality in the form of hallucinations and delusions, as seen in schizophrenia. Other disorders include dissociative disorders and eating disorders.\nThe biopsychosocial model identifies three types of causes of mental disorders: biological, cognitive, and environmental factors. Biological factors include bodily causes, in particular neurological influences and genetic predispositions. On the cognitive level, maladaptive beliefs and patterns of thought can be responsible. Environmental factors involve cultural influences and social events that may trigger the onset of a disorder. There are various approaches to treating mental disorders, and the most suitable treatment usually depends on the type of disorder, its cause, and the individual's overall condition. Psychotherapeutic methods use personal interaction with a therapist to change patterns of thinking, feeling, and acting. Psychoanalysis aims to help patients resolve conflicts between the conscious and the unconscious mind. Cognitive behavioral therapy focuses on conscious mental phenomena to identify and change irrational beliefs and negative thought patterns. Behavior therapy relies on classical conditioning to unlearn harmful behaviors. Humanistic therapies try to help people gain insight into their self-worth and empower them to resolve their problems. Drug therapies use medication to alter the brain chemistry involved in the disorder through substances like antidepressants, antipsychotics, mood stabilizers, and anxiolytics.\nFields and methods of inquiry.\nVarious fields of inquiry study the mind, including psychology, neuroscience, philosophy, and cognitive science. They differ from each other in the aspects of mind they investigate and the methods they employ. The study of the mind poses various problems since it is difficult to directly examine, manipulate, and measure it. Trying to circumvent this problem by investigating the brain comes with new challenges of its own, mainly because of the brain's complexity as a neural network consisting of billions of neurons, each with up to 10,000 links to other neurons.\nPsychology.\nPsychology is the scientific study of mind and behavior. It investigates conscious and unconscious mental phenomena, including perception, memory, feeling, thought, decision, intelligence, and personality. It is further interested in their outward manifestation in the form of observable behavioral patterns, studying how these patterns depend on external circumstances and are shaped by learning. Psychology is a wide discipline that includes many subfields. Cognitive psychology is interested in higher-order mental activities like thinking, problem-solving, reasoning, and concept formation. Biological psychology seeks to understand the underlying mechanisms on the physiological level and how they depend on genetic transmission and the environment. Developmental psychology studies the development of the mind from childhood to old age while social psychology examines the influence of social contexts on mind and behavior. Personality psychology investigates personality, exploring how characteristic patterns of thought, feeling, and behavior develop and vary among individuals. Further subfields include comparative, clinical, educational, occupational, and neuropsychology. As a scientific discipline, psychology emerged at the end of the 19th century from the experimental work of Wilhelm Wundt (1832\u20131920). Early schools of thought included structuralism, psychoanalysis, Gestalt psychology, functionalism, and behaviorism.\nPsychologists use a great variety of methods to study the mind. Experimental approaches set up a controlled situation, either in the laboratory or the field, in which they modify independent variables and measure their effects on dependent variables. This approach makes it possible to identify causal relations between the variables. For example, to determine whether people with similar interests (independent variable) are more likely to become friends (dependent variable), participants in a study could be paired with either similar or dissimilar participants. After giving the pairs time to interact, it is assessed whether the members of similar pairs have more positive attitudes toward one another than the members of dissimilar pairs.\nCorrelational methods examine the strength of association between two variables without establishing a causal relationship between them. The survey method presents participants with a list of questions aimed at eliciting information about their mental attitudes, behavior, and other relevant factors. It analyzes how participants respond to questions and how answers to different questions correlate with one another. Surveys usually have a large number of participants in contrast to case studies, which focus on an in-depth examination of a single subject or a small group of subjects, often to examine rare phenomena or explore new fields. Further methods include longitudinal studies, naturalistic observation, and phenomenological description of experience.\nNeuroscience.\nNeuroscience is the study of the nervous system. Its primary focus is the central nervous system and the brain in particular, but it also investigates the peripheral nervous system mainly responsible for connecting the central nervous system to the limbs and organs. Neuroscience examines the implementation of mental phenomena on a physiological basis, covering various levels of analysis. On the small scale, it studies the molecular and cellular basis of the mind, dealing with the constitution of and interaction between individual neurons. On the large scale, it analyzes the architecture of the brain as a whole and its division into regions with different functions. The study of the nervous system began in the ancient period and evolved through the centuries, including anatomical insights through dissections and speculative theories about brain functions. Neuroscience was recognized as a distinct academic discipline in the 20th century as technological advances, like the development of neuroimaging techniques, revolutionized the field.\nIn modern neuroscience, neuroimaging techniques are of particular importance as the main research methods of neuroscientists. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) measures changes in the magnetic field of the brain associated with blood flow. Areas of increased blood flow indicate that the corresponding brain region is particularly active. Positron emission tomography (PET) uses radioactive substances to detect a range of metabolic changes in the brain. Electroencephalography (EEG) measures the electrical activity of the brain, usually by placing electrodes on the scalp and measuring the voltage differences between them. These techniques are often employed to measure brain changes under particular circumstances, for example, while engaged in a specific cognitive task. Important insights are also gained from patients and laboratory animals with brain damage, helping neuroscientists understand the function of the damaged area and how its absence affects the remaining brain.\nPhilosophy of mind.\nPhilosophy of mind examines the nature of mental phenomena and their relation to the physical world. It seeks to understand the \"mark of the mental\", that is, the features that all mental states have in common. It further investigates the essence of different types of mental phenomena, such as beliefs, desires, emotions, intentionality, and consciousness while exploring how they are related to one another. Philosophy of mind also examines solutions to the mind\u2013body problem, like dualism, idealism, and physicalism, and assesses arguments for and against them. It asks whether people have a free will or the ability to choose their actions, and how this ability contrasts with the idea that everything is determined by preceding causes.\nWhile philosophers of mind also include empirical considerations in their inquiry, they differ from fields like psychology and neuroscience by giving significantly more emphasis to non-empirical forms of inquiry. One such method is conceptual analysis, which aims to clarify the meaning of concepts, like \"mind\" and \"intention\", by decomposing them to identify their semantic parts. Thought experiments are often used to evoke intuitions about abstract theories to assess their coherence and plausibility. To do so, philosophers imagine a situation relevant to a theory and employ counterfactual thinking to assess the possible consequences of this theory. Influential thought experiments include Mary the color scientist, philosophical zombies, and brain in a vat-scenarios. Because of the subjective nature of the mind, the phenomenological method is also commonly used to analyze the structure of consciousness by describing experience from the first-person perspective. The philosophical discussion of the mind has a long history, reaching back to antiquity. Influential contributions were made by Plato (c.\u2009428\u2013347 BCE), Aristotle (384\u2013322 BCE), Ren\u00e9 Descartes (1596\u20131650), David Hume (1711\u20131776), Immanuel Kant (1724\u20131804), William James (1842\u20131910), and Gilbert Ryle (1900\u20131976).\nCognitive science.\nCognitive science is the interdisciplinary study of mental representations and processes. It aims to overcome the challenge of understanding something as complex as the mind by integrating research from diverse fields ranging from psychology and neuroscience to philosophy, linguistics, and artificial intelligence. Unlike these disciplines, it is not a unified field but a collaborative effort. One difficulty in synthesizing their insights is that each of these disciplines explores the mind from a different perspective and level of abstraction while using different research methods to arrive at its conclusion. Cognitive science emerged in the second half of the 20th century as researchers from various disciplines began to examine how mental processes represent the world and transform information. The field expanded in the 1980s following advances in neuroimaging to include a biological perspective on how computational processes are implemented by the brain.\nTo incorporate insights from diverse disciplines, cognitive science relies on a unified conceptualization of minds as information processors. This means that mental processes are understood as computations that retrieve, transform, store, and transmit information. For example, perception retrieves sensory information from the environment and transforms it to extract meaningful patterns that can be used in other mental processes, such as planning and decision-making. Cognitive science relies on different levels of description to analyze cognitive processes. The most abstract level focuses on the basic problem the process is supposed to solve and the reasons why the organism needs to solve it. The intermediate level seeks to uncover the algorithm as a formal step-by-step procedure to solve the problem. The most concrete level asks how the algorithm is implemented through physiological changes on the level of the brain. Another methodology is to analyze the mind as a complex system composed of individual subsystems that can be studied independently of one another. This analytic approach is complemented by the binding problem\u2014the challenge of explaining how the information computed in distinct neural regions is integrated to form coherent object representations.\nRelation to other fields.\nThe mind is relevant to many fields. In epistemology, the problem of other minds is the challenge of explaining how it is possible to know that people other than oneself have a mind. The difficulty arises from the fact that people directly experience their own minds but do not have the same access to the minds of others. According to a common view, it is necessary to rely on perception to observe the behavior of others and then infer that they have a mind based on analogical or abductive reasoning. Closely related to this problem is theory of mind in psychology, which is the ability to understand that other people possess beliefs, desires, intentions, and feelings that may differ from one's own.\nAnthropology is interested in how different cultures conceptualize the nature of mind and its relation to the world. These conceptualizations affect the way people understand themselves, experience illness, and interpret ritualistic practices as attempts to commune with spirits. Some cultures do not draw a strict boundary between mind and world by allowing that thoughts can pass directly into the world and manifest as beneficial or harmful forces. For instance, some indigenous beliefs systems, like traditional beliefs in the Azande culture, hold that angry thoughts can directly damage another person's crops or make them ill. Other cultures strictly separate the mind from external reality, seeing it as an internal phenomenon without supernatural powers. Sociology is a related field concerned with the connections between mind, society, and behavior. Among other topics, it is interested in the phenomenon of intersubjectivity, which happens when different people have a shared understanding or experience, meaning that their cognitive perspectives overlap.\nThe concept of mind plays a central role in various religions. Buddhists say that there is no enduring self underlying mental activity. They analyze the mind as a stream of constantly changing experiences characterized by five aspects or \"aggregates\": material form, feelings, perception, volition, and consciousness. Hindus, by contrast, affirm the existence of a permanent self. In an influential analogy, the human mind is compared to a horse-drawn chariot: the horses are the senses, which lure the sense mind corresponding to the reins through sensual pleasures. The senses are controlled by the charioteer embodying the intellect while the self is a passenger. In traditional Christian philosophy, mind and soul are closely intertwined as the immaterial aspect of humans that may survive bodily death. Islamic thought distinguishes between mind, spirit, heart, and self as interconnected aspects of the spiritual dimension of humans. Daoism and Confucianism use the concept of heart-mind as the center of cognitive and emotional life, encompassing thought, understanding, will, desire, and mood.\nIn the field of education, the minds of students are shaped through the transmission of knowledge, skills, and character traits as a process of socialization and enculturation. This is achieved through different teaching methods including the contrast between group work and individual learning and the use of instructional media. Teacher-centered education positions the teacher as the central authority controlling the learning process whereas in student-centered education, students have a more active role in shaping classroom activities. The choice of the most effective method to develop the minds of the learners is determined by various factors, including the topic and the learner's age and skill level.\nThe mind is a frequent subject of pseudoscientific inquiry. Phrenology was an early attempt to correlate mental functions with specific brain areas. While its central claims about predicting mental traits by measuring bumps on the skull did not survive scientific scrutiny, the underlying idea that certain mental functions are localized in particular regions of the brain is now widely accepted. Parapsychologists seek to discover and study paranormal mental abilities ranging from clairvoyance to telepathy and telekinesis.\nReferences.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "19379", "revid": "486612", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19379", "title": "Mahatma Gandhi", "text": "Indian independence activist (1869\u20131948)\nMohandas Karamchand Gandhi (2October 1869\u00a0\u2013 30January 1948) was an Indian lawyer, thinker, anti-colonial activist, and political ethicist who employed nonviolent resistance to lead the successful campaign for India's independence from British rule. He inspired movements for civil rights and freedom across the world. The honorific \"Mah\u0101tm\u0101\" (from Sanskrit, meaning great-souled, or venerable), first applied to him in South Africa in 1914, is used worldwide.\nBorn and raised in a Hindu family in coastal Gujarat, Gandhi was trained in the law at the Inner Temple in London and was called to the bar at the age of 22. After two uncertain years in India, where he was unable to start a successful law practice, Gandhi moved to South Africa in 1893 to represent an Indian merchant in a lawsuit. He went on to live in South Africa for the next 21 years. Here, Gandhi raised a family and first employed nonviolent resistance in a campaign for civil rights. In 1915, aged 45, he returned to India and soon set about organising peasants, farmers, and urban labourers to protest against discrimination and excessive land tax.\nAssuming leadership of the Indian National Congress in 1921, Gandhi led nationwide campaigns for easing poverty, expanding women's rights, building religious and ethnic amity, ending untouchability, and, above all, achieving \"swaraj\" or self-rule. Gandhi adopted the short \"dhoti\" woven with hand-spun yarn as a mark of identification with India's rural poor. He began to live in a self-sufficient residential community, to eat simple food, and undertake long fasts as a means of both introspection and political protest. Bringing anti-colonial nationalism to the common Indians, Gandhi led them in challenging the British-imposed salt tax with the Dandi Salt March in 1930 and in calling for the British to quit India in 1942. He was imprisoned many times and for many years in both South Africa and India.\nGandhi's vision of an independent India based on religious pluralism was challenged in the early 1940s by a Muslim nationalism which demanded a separate homeland for Muslims within British India. In August 1947, Britain granted independence, but the British Indian Empire was partitioned into two dominions, a Hindu-majority India and a Muslim-majority Pakistan. As many displaced Hindus, Muslims, and Sikhs made their way to their new lands, religious violence broke out, especially in the Punjab and Bengal. Abstaining from the official celebration of independence, Gandhi visited the affected areas, attempting to alleviate distress. In the months following, he undertook several hunger strikes to stop the religious violence. The last of these was begun in Delhi on 12 January 1948, when Gandhi was 78. The belief that Gandhi had been too resolute in his defence of both Pakistan and Indian Muslims spread among some Hindus in India. Among these was Nathuram Godse, a militant Hindu nationalist from Pune, western India, who assassinated Gandhi by firing three bullets into his chest at an interfaith prayer meeting in Delhi on 30 January 1948.\nGandhi's birthday, 2 October, is commemorated in India as Gandhi Jayanti, a national holiday, and worldwide as the International Day of Nonviolence. Gandhi is considered to be the Father of the Nation in post-colonial India. During India's nationalist movement and in several decades immediately after, he was also commonly called \"Bapu\", an endearment roughly meaning \"father\".\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:TOC limit/styles.css\" /&gt;\nEarly life and background.\nParents.\nGandhi's father, Karamchand Uttamchand Gandhi (1822\u20131885), served as the \"dewan\" (chief minister) of Porbandar state. His family originated from the then village of Kutiana in what was then Junagadh State. Although Karamchand only had been a clerk in the state administration and had an elementary education, he proved a capable chief minister.\nDuring his tenure, Karamchand married four times. His first two wives died young, after each had given birth to a daughter, and his third marriage was childless. In 1857, Karamchand sought his third wife's permission to remarry; that year, he married Putlibai (1844\u20131891), who also came from Junagadh, and was from a Pranami Vaishnava family. Karamchand and Putlibai had four children: a son, Laxmidas (c.\u20091860\u20131914), a daughter, Raliatbehn (1862\u20131960), a second son, Karsandas (c.\u20091866\u20131913), and a third son, Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi, who was born on 2 October 1869 in Porbandar (also known as \"Sudamapuri\"), a coastal town on the Kathiawar Peninsula and then part of the small princely state of Porbandar in the Kathiawar Agency of the British Raj.\nIn 1874, Gandhi's father, Karamchand, left Porbandar for the smaller state of Rajkot, where he became a counsellor to its ruler, the Thakur Sahib; though Rajkot was a less prestigious state than Porbandar, the British regional political agency was located there, which gave the state's \"diwan\" a measure of security. In 1876, Karamchand became \"diwan\" of Rajkot and was succeeded as \"diwan\" of Porbandar by his brother Tulsidas. Karamchand's family then rejoined him in Rajkot. They moved to their family home Kaba Gandhi No Delo in 1881.\nChildhood.\nAs a child, Gandhi was described by his sister Raliat as \"restless as mercury, either playing or roaming about. One of his favourite pastimes was twisting dogs' ears.\" The Indian classics, especially the stories of Shravana and king Harishchandra, had a great impact on Gandhi in his childhood. In his autobiography, Gandhi states that they left an indelible impression on his mind. Gandhi writes: \"It haunted me and I must have acted Harishchandra to myself times without number.\" Gandhi's early self-identification with truth and love as supreme values is traceable to these epic characters.\nThe family's religious background was eclectic. Mohandas was born into a Gujarati Hindu Modh Bania family. Gandhi's father, Karamchand, was Hindu and his mother Putlibai was from a Pranami Vaishnava Hindu family. Gandhi's father was of Modh Baniya caste in the varna of Vaishya. His mother came from the medieval Krishna bhakti-based Pranami tradition, whose religious texts include the Bhagavad Gita, the \"Bhagavata Purana\", and a collection of 14 texts with teachings that the tradition believes to include the essence of the Vedas, the Quran and the Bible. Gandhi was deeply influenced by his mother, an extremely pious lady who \"would not think of taking her meals without her daily prayers... she would take the hardest vows and keep them without flinching. To keep two or three consecutive fasts was nothing to her.\"\nAt the age of nine, Gandhi entered the local school in Rajkot, near his home. There, he studied the rudiments of arithmetic, history, the Gujarati language and geography. At the age of 11, Gandhi joined the High School in Rajkot, Alfred High School. He was an average student, won some prizes, but was a shy and tongue-tied student, with no interest in games; Gandhi's only companions were books and school lessons.\nMarriage.\nIn May 1883, the 13-year-old Gandhi was married to 14-year-old Kasturbai Gokuldas Kapadia (her first name was usually shortened to \"Kasturba\", and affectionately to \"Ba\") in an arranged marriage, according to the custom of the region at that time. In the process, he lost a year at school but was later allowed to make up by accelerating his studies. Gandhi's wedding was a joint event, where his brother and cousin were also married. Recalling the day of their marriage, Gandhi once said, \"As we didn't know much about marriage, for us it meant only wearing new clothes, eating sweets and playing with relatives.\" As was the prevailing tradition, the adolescent bride was to spend much time at her parents' house, and away from her husband.\nWriting many years later, Gandhi described with regret the lustful feelings he felt for his young bride: \"Even at school I used to think of her, and the thought of nightfall and our subsequent meeting was ever haunting me.\" Gandhi later recalled feeling jealous and possessive of her, such as when Kasturba would visit a temple with her girlfriends, and being sexually lustful in his feelings for her.\nIn late 1885, Gandhi's father, Karamchand, died. Gandhi had left his father's bedside to be with his wife mere minutes before his passing. Many decades later, Gandhi wrote \"if animal passion had not blinded me, I should have been spared the torture of separation from my father during his last moments.\" Later, Gandhi, then 16 years old, and his wife, age 17, had their first child, who survived only a few days. The two deaths anguished Gandhi. The Gandhis had four more children, all sons: Harilal, born in 1888; Manilal, born in 1892; Ramdas, born in 1897; and Devdas, born in 1900.\nIn November 1887, the 18-year-old Gandhi graduated from high school in Ahmedabad. In January 1888, he enrolled at Samaldas College in Bhavnagar State, then the sole degree-granting institution of higher education in the region. However, Gandhi dropped out and returned to his family in Porbandar.\nOutside school, Gandhi's education was enriched by exposure to Gujarati literature, especially reformers like Narmad and Govardhanram Tripathi, whose works alerted the Gujaratis to their own faults and weaknesses such as belief in religious dogmatism.\nThree years in London.\nStudent of law.\nGandhi had dropped out of the cheapest college he could afford in Bombay. Mavji Dave Joshiji, a Brahmin priest and family friend, advised Gandhi and his family that he should consider law studies in London. In July 1888, Gandhi's wife Kasturba gave birth to their first surviving child, Harilal. Gandhi's mother was not comfortable about Gandhi leaving his wife and family and going so far from home. Gandhi's uncle Tulsidas also tried to dissuade his nephew, but Gandhi wanted to go. To persuade his wife and mother, Gandhi made a vow in front of his mother that he would abstain from meat, alcohol, and women. Gandhi's brother, Laxmidas, who was already a lawyer, cheered Gandhi's London studies plan and offered to support him. Putlibai gave Gandhi her permission and blessing.\nOn 10 August 1888, Gandhi, aged 18, left Porbandar for Mumbai, then known as Bombay. A local newspaper covering the farewell function by his old high school in Rajkot noted that Gandhi was the first Bania from Kathiawar to proceed to England for his Barrister Examination. As Mohandas Gandhi waited for a berth on a ship to London he found that he had attracted the ire of the Modh Banias of Bombay. Upon arrival in Bombay, he stayed with the local Modh Bania community whose elders warned Gandhi that England would tempt him to compromise his religion, and eat and drink in Western ways. Despite Gandhi informing them of his promise to his mother and her blessings, Gandhi was excommunicated from his caste. Gandhi ignored this, and on 4 September, he sailed from Bombay to London, with his brother seeing him off. Gandhi attended University College, London, where he took classes in English literature with Henry Morley in 1888\u20131889.\nGandhi also enrolled at the Inns of Court School of Law in Inner Temple with the intention of becoming a barrister. His childhood shyness and self-withdrawal had continued through his teens. Gandhi retained these traits when he arrived in London, but joined a public speaking practice group and overcame his shyness sufficiently to practise law.\nGandhi demonstrated a keen interest in the welfare of London's impoverished dockland communities. In 1889, a bitter trade dispute broke out in London, with dockers striking for better pay and conditions, and seamen, shipbuilders, factory girls and other joining the strike in solidarity. The strikers were successful, in part due to the mediation of Cardinal Manning, leading Gandhi and an Indian friend to make a point of visiting the cardinal and thanking him for his work.\nVegetarianism and committee work.\nHis vow to his mother influenced Gandhi's time in London. Gandhi tried to adopt \"English\" customs, including taking dancing lessons. However, he didn't appreciate the bland vegetarian food offered by his landlady and was frequently hungry until he found one of London's few vegetarian restaurants. Influenced by Henry Salt's writing, Gandhi joined the London Vegetarian Society (LVS) and was elected to its executive committee under the aegis of its president and benefactor Arnold Hills. An achievement while on the committee was the establishment of a Bayswater chapter. Some of the vegetarians Gandhi met were members of the Theosophical Society, which had been founded in 1875 to further universal brotherhood, and which was devoted to the study of Buddhist and Hindu literature. They encouraged Gandhi to join them in reading the Bhagavad Gita both in translation as well as in the original.\nGandhi had a friendly and productive relationship with Hills, but the two men took a different view on the continued LVS membership of fellow committee member Thomas Allinson. Their disagreement is the first known example of Gandhi challenging authority, despite his shyness and temperamental disinclination towards confrontation.\nAllinson had been promoting newly available birth control methods, but Hills disapproved of these, believing they undermined public morality. He believed vegetarianism to be a moral movement and that Allinson should therefore no longer remain a member of the LVS. Gandhi shared Hills' views on the dangers of birth control, but defended Allinson's right to differ. It would have been hard for Gandhi to challenge Hills; Hills was 12 years his senior and unlike Gandhi, highly eloquent. Hills bankrolled the LVS and was a captain of industry with his Thames Ironworks company employing more than 6,000 people in the East End of London. Hills was also a highly accomplished sportsman who later founded the football club West Ham United. In his 1927 \"An Autobiography, Vol. I\", Gandhi wrote:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nA motion to remove Allinson was raised, and was debated and voted on by the committee. Gandhi's shyness was an obstacle to his defence of Allinson at the committee meeting. Gandhi wrote his views down on paper, but shyness prevented Gandhi from reading out his arguments, so Hills, the President, asked another committee member to read them out for him. Although some other members of the committee agreed with Gandhi, the vote was lost and Allinson was excluded. There were no hard feelings, with Hills proposing the toast at the LVS farewell dinner in honour of Gandhi's return to India.\nCalled to the bar.\nGandhi, at age 22, was called to the bar in June 1891 and then left London for India, where he learned that his mother had died while he was in London and that his family had kept the news from Gandhi. His attempts at establishing a law practice in Bombay failed because Gandhi was psychologically unable to cross-examine witnesses. He returned to Rajkot to make a modest living drafting petitions for litigants, but Gandhi was forced to stop after running afoul of British officer Sam Sunny.\nIn 1893, a Muslim merchant in Kathiawar named Dada Abdullah contacted Gandhi. Abdullah owned a large successful shipping business in South Africa. His distant cousin in Johannesburg needed a lawyer, and they preferred someone with Kathiawari heritage. Gandhi inquired about his pay for the work. They offered a total salary of \u00a3105 (~$4,143 in 2023 money) plus travel expenses. He accepted it, knowing that it would be at least a one-year commitment in the Colony of Natal, South Africa, also a part of the British Empire.\nCivil rights activist in South Africa (1893\u20131914).\nIn April 1893, Gandhi, aged 23, set sail for South Africa to be the lawyer for Abdullah's cousin. Gandhi spent 21 years in South Africa where he developed his political views, ethics, and politics. During this time Gandhi briefly returned to India\u00a0in 1902 to mobilise support for the welfare of Indians in South Africa.\nImmediately upon arriving in South Africa, Gandhi faced discrimination due to his skin colour and heritage. Gandhi was not allowed to sit with European passengers in the stagecoach and was told to sit on the floor near the driver, then beaten when he refused; elsewhere, Gandhi was kicked into a gutter for daring to walk near a house, in another instance thrown off a train at Pietermaritzburg after refusing to leave the first-class. Gandhi sat in the train station, shivering all night and pondering if he should return to India or protest for his rights. Gandhi chose to protest and was allowed to board the train the next day. In another incident, the magistrate of a Durban court ordered Gandhi to remove his turban, which he refused to do. Indians were not allowed to walk on public footpaths in South Africa. Gandhi was kicked by a police officer out of the footpath onto the street without warning.\nWhen Gandhi arrived in South Africa, according to Arthur Herman, he thought of himself as \"a Briton first, and an Indian second.\" However, the prejudice against Gandhi and his fellow Indians from British people that Gandhi experienced and observed deeply bothered him. Gandhi found it humiliating, struggling to understand how some people can feel honour, superiority or pleasure in such inhumane practices. Gandhi began to question his people's standing in the British Empire.\nThe Abdullah case that had brought him to South Africa concluded in May 1894, and the Indian community organised a farewell party for Gandhi as he prepared to return to India. The farewell party was turned into a working committee to plan the resistance to a new Natal government discriminatory proposal. This led to Gandhi extending his original period of stay in South Africa. Gandhi planned to assist Indians in opposing a bill to deny them the right to vote, a right then proposed to be an exclusive European right. He asked Joseph Chamberlain, the British Colonial Secretary, to reconsider his position on this bill. Though unable to halt the bill's passage, Gandhi's campaign was successful in drawing attention to the grievances of Indians in South Africa. He helped found the Natal Indian Congress in 1894, and through this organisation, Gandhi moulded the Indian community of South Africa into a unified political force. In January 1897, when Gandhi landed in Durban, a mob of white settlers attacked him, and Gandhi escaped only through the efforts of the wife of the police superintendent. However, Gandhi refused to press charges against any member of the mob.\nDuring the Boer War, Gandhi volunteered in 1900 to form a group of stretcher-bearers as the Natal Indian Ambulance Corps. According to Arthur Herman, Gandhi wanted to disprove the British colonial stereotype that Hindus were not fit for \"manly\" activities involving danger and exertion, unlike the Muslim \"martial races.\" Gandhi raised 1,100 Indian volunteers to support British combat troops against the Boers. They were trained and medically certified to serve on the front lines. They were auxiliaries at the Battle of Colenso to a White volunteer ambulance corps. At the Battle of Spion Kop, Gandhi and his bearers moved to the front line and had to carry wounded soldiers for miles to a field hospital since the terrain was too rough for the ambulances. Gandhi and 37 other Indians received the Queen's South Africa Medal.\nIn 1906, the Transvaal government promulgated a new Act compelling registration of the colony's Indian and Chinese populations. The law required Asians to undergo fingerprint registration and to carry identity certificates that officials could demand at any time. Historians have noted that Gandhi's resistance was therefore also a protest against a system of biometric identification that treated Indians as criminal subjects. Gandhi initially accepted voluntary registration as a gesture of trust, but later realized that once fingerprints were recorded, individuals lost the right to withdraw their consent. This then shaped Gandhi's understanding of Satyagraha as a defense of dignity and personal autonomy. At a mass protest meeting held in Johannesburg on 11 September that year, Gandhi adopted his still evolving methodology of \"Satyagraha\" (devotion to the truth), or nonviolent protest, for the first time. According to Anthony Parel, Gandhi was also influenced by the Tamil moral text \"Tirukku\u1e5ba\u1e37\" after Leo Tolstoy mentioned it in their correspondence that began with \"A Letter to a Hindu\". Gandhi urged Indians to defy the new law and to suffer the punishments for doing so. His ideas of protests, persuasion skills, and public relations had emerged. Gandhi took these back to India in 1915.\nEuropeans, Indians and Africans.\nGandhi focused his attention on Indians and Africans while he was in South Africa. Initially, Gandhi was not interested in politics, but this changed after he was discriminated against and bullied, such as by being thrown out of a train coach due to his skin colour by a white train official. After several such incidents with Whites in South Africa, Gandhi's thinking and focus changed, and he felt he must resist this and fight for rights. Gandhi entered politics by forming the Natal Indian Congress. According to Ashwin Desai and Goolam Vahed, Gandhi's views on racism are contentious in some cases. He suffered persecution from the beginning in South Africa. Like with other coloured people, white officials denied Gandhi his rights, and the press and those in the streets bullied and called Gandhi a \"parasite\", \"semi-barbarous\", \"canker\", \"squalid coolie\", \"yellow man\", and other epithets. People would even spit on him as an expression of racial hate.\nWhile in South Africa, Gandhi focused on the racial persecution of Indians before he started to focus on racism against Africans. In some cases, state Desai and Vahed, Gandhi's behaviour was one of being a willing part of racial stereotyping and African exploitation. During a speech in September 1896, Gandhi complained that the whites in the British colony of South Africa were \"degrading the Indian to the level of a raw Kaffir.\" Scholars cite it as an example of evidence that Gandhi at that time thought of Indians and black South Africans differently. As another example given by Herman, Gandhi, at the age of 24, prepared a legal brief for the Natal Assembly in 1895, seeking voting rights for Indians. Gandhi cited race history and European Orientalists' opinions that \"Anglo-Saxons and Indians are sprung from the same Aryan stock or rather the Indo-European peoples\" and argued that Indians should not be grouped with the Africans.\nYears later, Gandhi and his colleagues served and helped Africans as nurses and by opposing racism. The Nobel Peace Prize winner Nelson Mandela is among admirers of Gandhi's efforts to fight against racism in Africa. The general image of Gandhi, state Desai and Vahed, has been reinvented since his assassination as though Gandhi was always a saint, when in reality, his life was more complex, contained inconvenient truths, and was one that changed over time. Scholars have also pointed the evidence to a rich history of co-operation and efforts by Gandhi and Indian people with nonwhite South Africans against persecution of Africans and the Apartheid.\nIn 1903, Gandhi started the \"Indian Opinion\", a journal that carried news of Indians in South Africa, Indians in India with articles on all subjects \u2013 social, moral and intellectual. Each issue was multi-lingual and carried material in English, Gujarati, Hindi and Tamil. It carried ads, depended heavily on Gandhi's contributions (often printed without a byline) and was an \"advocate\" for the Indian cause.\nIn 1906, when the Bambatha Rebellion broke out in the colony of Natal, the then 36-year-old Gandhi, despite sympathising with the Zulu rebels, encouraged Indian South Africans to form a volunteer stretcher-bearer unit. Writing in the \"Indian Opinion\", Gandhi argued that military service would be beneficial to the Indian community and claimed it would give them \"health and happiness.\" Gandhi eventually led a volunteer mixed unit of Indian and African stretcher-bearers to treat wounded combatants during the suppression of the rebellion.\nThe medical unit commanded by Gandhi operated for less than two months before being disbanded. After the suppression of the rebellion, the colonial establishment showed no interest in extending to the Indian community the civil rights granted to white South Africans.\nBy 1910, Gandhi's newspaper, \"Indian Opinion\", was covering reports on discrimination against Africans by the colonial regime. Gandhi remarked that the Africans \"alone are the original inhabitants of the land. \u2026 The whites, on the other hand, have occupied the land forcibly and appropriated it for themselves.\"\nIn 1910, Gandhi established, with the help of his friend Hermann Kallenbach, an idealistic community they named Tolstoy Farm near Johannesburg. There, Gandhi nurtured his policy of peaceful resistance.\nIn the years after black South Africans gained the right to vote in South Africa (1994), Gandhi was proclaimed a national hero with numerous monuments.\nStruggle for Indian independence (1915\u20131947).\nAt the request of Gopal Krishna Gokhale, conveyed to Gandhi by C. F. Andrews, Gandhi returned to India in 1915. He brought an international reputation as a leading Indian nationalist, theorist and community organiser.\nGandhi joined the Indian National Congress and was introduced to Indian issues, politics and the Indian people primarily by Gokhale. Gokhale was a key leader of the Congress Party best known for his restraint and moderation, and his insistence on working inside the system. Gandhi took Gokhale's liberal approach based on British Whiggish traditions and transformed it to make it look Indian.\nGandhi took leadership of the Congress in 1920 and began escalating demands until on 26 January 1930 the Indian National Congress declared the independence of India. The British did not recognise the declaration, but negotiations ensued, with the Congress taking a role in provincial government in the late 1930s. Gandhi and the Congress withdrew their support of the Raj when the Viceroy declared war on Germany in September 1939 without consultation. Tensions escalated until Gandhi demanded immediate independence in 1942, and the British responded by imprisoning him and tens of thousands of Congress leaders. Meanwhile, the Muslim League did co-operate with Britain and moved, against Gandhi's strong opposition, to demands for a totally separate Muslim state of Pakistan. In August 1947, the British partitioned the land with India and Pakistan each achieving independence on terms that Gandhi disapproved.\nRole in World War I.\nIn April 1918, during the latter part of World War I, the Viceroy invited Gandhi to a War Conference in Delhi. Gandhi agreed to support the war effort. In contrast to the Zulu War of 1906 and the outbreak of World War I in 1914, when he recruited volunteers for the Ambulance Corps, this time Gandhi attempted to recruit combatants. In a June 1918 leaflet entitled \"Appeal for Enlistment\", Gandhi wrote: \"To bring about such a state of things we should have the ability to defend ourselves, that is, the ability to bear arms and to use them... If we want to learn the use of arms with the greatest possible despatch, it is our duty to enlist ourselves in the army.\" However, Gandhi stipulated in a letter to the Viceroy's private secretary that he \"personally will not kill or injure anybody, friend or foe.\"\nGandhi's support for the war campaign brought into question his consistency on nonviolence. Gandhi's private secretary noted that \"The question of the consistency between his creed of 'Ahimsa' (nonviolence) and his recruiting campaign was raised not only then but has been discussed ever since.\" According to political and educational scientist Christian Bartolf, Gandhi's support for the war stemmed from his belief that true ahimsa could not exist simultaneously with cowardice. Therefore, Gandhi felt that Indians needed to be willing and capable of using arms before they voluntarily chose non-violence.\nIn July 1918, Gandhi said that he could not persuade even one individual to enlist for the world war. \"So far I have not a single recruit to my credit apart,\" Gandhi wrote. He added: \"They object because they fear to die.\"\nChamparan agitations.\nGandhi's first major achievement came in 1917 with the Champaran agitation in Bihar. The Champaran agitation pitted the local peasantry against largely Anglo-Indian plantation owners who were backed by the local administration. The peasants were forced to grow indigo (\"Indigofera\" sp.), a cash crop for Indigo dye whose demand had been declining over two decades and were forced to sell their crops to the planters at a fixed price. Unhappy with this, the peasantry appealed to Gandhi at his ashram in Ahmedabad. Pursuing a strategy of nonviolent protest, Gandhi took the administration by surprise and won concessions from the authorities.\nKheda agitations.\nIn 1918, Kheda was hit by floods and famine and the peasantry was demanding relief from taxes. Gandhi moved his headquarters to Nadiad, organising scores of supporters and fresh volunteers from the region, the most notable being Vallabhbhai Patel. Using non-co-operation as a technique, Gandhi initiated a signature campaign where peasants pledged non-payment of revenue even under the threat of confiscation of land. A social boycott of \"mamlatdars\" and \"talatdars\" (revenue officials within the district) accompanied the agitation. Gandhi worked hard to win public support for the agitation across the country. For five months, the administration refused, but by the end of May 1918, the government gave way on important provisions and relaxed the conditions of payment of revenue tax until the famine ended. In Kheda, Vallabhbhai Patel represented the farmers in negotiations with the British, who suspended revenue collection and released all the prisoners.\nKhilafat Movement.\nIn 1919, following World War I, Gandhi (aged 49) sought political co-operation from Muslims in his fight against British imperialism by supporting the Ottoman Empire that had been defeated in the World War. Before this initiative of Gandhi, communal disputes and religious riots between Hindus and Muslims were common in British India, such as the riots of 1917\u201318. Gandhi had already vocally supported the British crown in the first world war. This decision of Gandhi was in part motivated by the British promise to reciprocate the help with \"swaraj\" (self-government) to Indians after the end of World War I. The British government had offered, instead of self-government, minor reforms instead, disappointing Gandhi. He announced his \"satyagraha\" (civil disobedience) intentions. The British colonial officials made their counter move by passing the Rowlatt Act, to block Gandhi's movement. The Act allowed the British government to treat civil disobedience participants as criminals and gave it the legal basis to arrest anyone for \"preventive indefinite detention, incarceration without judicial review or any need for a trial.\"\nGandhi felt that Hindu-Muslim co-operation was necessary for political progress against the British. He leveraged the Khilafat Movement, wherein Sunni Muslims in India, their leaders such as the sultans of princely states in India and the Ali brothers (Shaukat Ali and Mohammad Ali Jauhar) championed the Turkish Caliph as a solidarity symbol of Sunni Islamic community (\"ummah\"). They saw the Caliph as their means to support Islam and the Islamic law after the defeat of Ottoman Empire in World War I. Gandhi's support to the Khilafat Movement led to mixed results. It initially led to a strong Muslim support for Gandhi. However, the Hindu leaders including Rabindranath Tagore questioned Gandhi's leadership because they were largely against recognising or supporting the Sunni Islamic Caliph in Turkey.\nThe increasing Muslim support for Gandhi, after he championed the Caliph's cause, temporarily stopped the Hindu-Muslim communal violence. It offered evidence of inter-communal harmony in joint Rowlatt \"satyagraha\" demonstration rallies, raising Gandhi's stature as the political leader to the British. His support for the Khilafat Movement also helped Gandhi sideline Muhammad Ali Jinnah, who had announced his opposition to the \"satyagraha\" non-co-operation movement approach of Gandhi. Jinnah began creating his independent support, and later went on to lead the demand for West and East Pakistan. Though they agreed in general terms on Indian independence, they disagreed on the means of achieving this. Jinnah was mainly interested in dealing with the British via constitutional negotiation, rather than attempting to agitate the masses.\nIn 1922, the Khilafat Movement gradually collapsed following the end of the non-cooperation movement with the arrest of Gandhi. A number of Muslim leaders and delegates abandoned Gandhi and Congress. Hindu-Muslim communal conflicts reignited, and deadly religious riots re-appeared in numerous cities, with 91 in United Provinces of Agra and Oudh alone.\nNon-co-operation.\nWith his book \"Hind Swaraj\" (1909) Gandhi, aged 40, declared that British rule was established in India with the co-operation of Indians and had survived only because of this co-operation. If Indians refused to co-operate, British rule would collapse and \"swaraj\" (Indian independence) would come.\nIn February 1919, Gandhi cautioned the Viceroy of India with a cable communication that if the British were to pass the Rowlatt Act, he would appeal to Indians to start civil disobedience. The British government ignored him and passed the law, stating it would not yield to threats. The \"satyagraha\" civil disobedience followed, with people assembling to protest the Rowlatt Act. On 30 March 1919, British law officers opened fire on an assembly of unarmed people, peacefully gathered, participating in \"satyagraha\" in Delhi.\nPeople rioted in retaliation. On 6 April 1919, a Hindu festival day, Gandhi asked a crowd to remember not to injure or kill British people, but to express their frustration with peace, to boycott British goods and burn any British clothing they owned. He emphasised the use of non-violence to the British and towards each other, even if the other side used violence. Communities across India announced plans to gather in greater numbers to protest. Government warned him not to enter Delhi, but Gandhi defied the order and was arrested on 9 April.\nOn 13 April 1919, people including women with children gathered in an Amritsar park, and British Indian Army officer Reginald Dyer surrounded them and ordered troops under his command to fire on them. The resulting Jallianwala Bagh massacre (or Amritsar massacre) of hundreds of Sikh and Hindu civilians enraged the subcontinent but was supported by some Britons and parts of the British media as a necessary response. Gandhi in Ahmedabad, on the day after the massacre in Amritsar, did not criticise the British and instead criticised his fellow countrymen for not exclusively using \"love\" to deal with the \"hate\" of the British government. Gandhi demanded that the Indian people stop all violence, stop all property destruction, and went on fast-to-death to pressure Indians to stop their rioting.\nThe massacre and Gandhi's non-violent response to it moved many, but also made some Sikhs and Hindus upset that Dyer was getting away with murder. Investigation committees were formed by the British, which Gandhi asked Indians to boycott. The unfolding events, the massacre and the British response, led Gandhi to the belief that Indians will never get a fair equal treatment under British rulers, and he shifted his attention to \"swaraj\" and political independence for India. In 1921, Gandhi was the leader of the Indian National Congress. He reorganised the Congress. With Congress now behind Gandhi, and Muslim support triggered by his backing the Khilafat Movement to restore the Caliph in Turkey, Gandhi had political support and the attention of the British Raj.\nGandhi expanded his nonviolent non-co-operation platform to include the \"swadeshi\" policy \u2013 the boycott of foreign-made goods, especially British goods. Linked to this was his advocacy that \"khadi\" (homespun cloth) be worn by all Indians instead of British-made textiles. Gandhi exhorted Indian men and women, rich or poor, to spend time each day spinning \"khadi\" in support of the independence movement. In addition to boycotting British products, Gandhi urged the people to boycott British institutions and law courts, to resign from government employment, and to forsake British titles and honours. Gandhi thus began his journey aimed at crippling the British India government economically, politically and administratively.\nThe appeal of \"Non-cooperation\" grew, its social popularity drew participation from all strata of Indian society. Gandhi was arrested on 10 March 1922, tried for sedition, and sentenced to six years' imprisonment. He began his sentence on 18 March 1922. With Gandhi isolated in prison, the Indian National Congress split into two factions, one led by Chitta Ranjan Das and Motilal Nehru favouring party participation in the legislatures, and the other led by Chakravarti Rajagopalachari and Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, opposing this move. Furthermore, co-operation among Hindus and Muslims ended as Khilafat movement collapsed with the rise of Atat\u00fcrk in Turkey. Muslim leaders left the Congress and began forming Muslim organisations. The political base behind Gandhi had broken into factions. He was released in February 1924 for an appendicitis operation, having served only two years.\nSalt Satyagraha (Salt March/Civil Disobedience Movement).\nAfter his early release from prison for political crimes in 1924, Gandhi continued to pursue \"swaraj\" over the second half of the 1920s. He pushed through a resolution at the Calcutta Congress in December 1928 calling on the British government to grant India dominion status or face a new campaign of non-cooperation with complete independence for the country as its goal. After Gandhi's support for World War I with Indian combat troops, and the failure of Khilafat Movement in preserving the rule of Caliph in Turkey, followed by a collapse in Muslim support for his leadership, some such as Subhas Chandra Bose and Bhagat Singh questioned his values and non-violent approach. While many Hindu leaders championed a demand for immediate independence, Gandhi revised his own call to a one-year wait, instead of two.\nThe British did not respond favourably to Gandhi's proposal. British political leaders such as Lord Birkenhead and Winston Churchill announced opposition to \"the appeasers of Gandhi\" in their discussions with European diplomats who sympathised with Indian demands. On 31 December 1929, an Indian flag was unfurled in Lahore. Gandhi led Congress in a celebration on 26 January 1930 of India's Independence Day in Lahore. This day was commemorated by almost every other Indian organisation. Gandhi then launched a new Satyagraha against the British salt tax in March 1930. He sent an ultimatum in the form of a letter personally addressed to Lord Irwin, the viceroy of India, on 2 March. Gandhi condemned British rule in the letter, describing it as \"a curse\" that \"has impoverished the dumb millions by a system of progressive exploitation and by a ruinously expensive military and civil administration... It has reduced us politically to serfdom.\" Gandhi also mentioned in the letter that the viceroy received a salary \"over five thousand times India's average income.\" In the letter, Gandhi also stressed his continued adherence to non-violent forms of protest.\nThis was highlighted by the Salt March to Dandi from 12 March to 6 April, where, together with 78 volunteers, Gandhi marched from Ahmedabad to Dandi, Gujarat to make salt himself, with the declared intention of breaking the salt laws. The march took 25 days to cover 240 miles with Gandhi speaking to often huge crowds along the way. Thousands of Indians joined him in Dandi.\nAccording to Sarma, Gandhi recruited women to participate in the salt tax campaigns and the boycott of foreign products, which gave many women a new self-confidence and dignity in the mainstream of Indian public life. However, other scholars such as Marilyn French state that Gandhi barred women from joining his civil disobedience movement because Gandhi feared he would be accused of using women as a political shield. When women insisted on joining the movement and participating in public demonstrations, Gandhi asked the volunteers to get permissions of their guardians and only those women who can arrange child-care should join him. Regardless of Gandhi's apprehensions and views, Indian women joined the Salt March by the thousands to defy the British salt taxes and monopoly on salt mining. On 5 May, Gandhi was interned under a regulation dating from 1827 in anticipation of a protest that he had planned. The protest at Dharasana salt works on 21 May went ahead without Gandhi. A horrified American journalist, Webb Miller, described the British response thus:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;In complete silence the Gandhi men drew up and halted a hundred yards from the stockade. A picked column advanced from the crowd, waded the ditches and approached the barbed wire stockade... at a word of command, scores of native policemen rushed upon the advancing marchers and rained blows on their heads with their steel-shot lathis [long bamboo sticks]. Not one of the marchers even raised an arm to fend off blows. They went down like ninepins. From where I stood I heard the sickening whack of the clubs on unprotected skulls... Those struck down fell sprawling, unconscious or writhing with fractured skulls or broken shoulders.\nThis went on for hours until some 300 or more protesters had been beaten, many seriously injured and two killed. At no time did they offer any resistance. After Gandhi's arrest, the women marched and picketed shops on their own, accepting violence and verbal abuse from British authorities for the cause in the manner Gandhi inspired.\nThis campaign was one of Gandhi's most successful at upsetting the British hold on India; Britain responded by imprisoning over 60,000 people. However, Congress estimates put the figure at 90,000. Among them was one of Gandhi's lieutenants, Jawaharlal Nehru.\nGandhi as folk hero.\nIndian Congress in the 1920s appealed to Andhra Pradesh peasants by creating Telugu language plays that combined Indian mythology and legends, linked them to Gandhi's ideas, and portrayed Gandhi as a messiah, a reincarnation of ancient and medieval Indian nationalist leaders and saints. The plays built support among peasants steeped in traditional Hindu culture, according to Murali, and this effort made Gandhi a folk hero in Telugu speaking villages, a sacred messiah-like figure.\nAccording to Dennis Dalton, it was Gandhi's ideas that were responsible for his wide following. Gandhi criticised Western civilisation as one driven by \"brute force and immorality\", contrasting it with his categorisation of Indian civilisation as one driven by \"soul force and morality\". Gandhi captured the imagination of the people of his heritage with his ideas about winning \"hate with love\". These ideas are evidenced in his pamphlets from the 1890s, in South Africa, where too Gandhi was popular among the Indian indentured workers. After he returned to India, people flocked to Gandhi because he reflected their values.\nGandhi also campaigned hard going from one rural corner of the Indian subcontinent to another. He used terminology and phrases such as \"Rama-rajya\" from \"Ramayana\", Prahlada as a paradigmatic icon, and such cultural symbols as another facet of \"swaraj\" and \"satyagraha\". During Gandhi's lifetime, these ideas sounded strange outside India, but they readily and deeply resonated with the culture and historic values of his people.\nNegotiations.\nThe government, represented by Lord Irwin, the Viceroy of India, decided to negotiate with Gandhi. The Gandhi\u2013Irwin Pact was signed in March 1931. The British Government agreed to free all political prisoners, in return for the suspension of the civil disobedience movement. According to the pact, Gandhi was invited to attend the Round Table Conference in London for discussions and as the sole representative of the Indian National Congress. The conference was a disappointment to Gandhi and the nationalists. Gandhi expected to discuss India's independence, while the British side focused on the Indian princes and Indian minorities rather than on a transfer of power. Lord Irwin's successor, Lord Willingdon, took a hard line against India as an independent nation, began a new campaign of controlling and subduing the nationalist movement. Gandhi was again arrested, and the government tried and failed to negate his influence by completely isolating him from his followers.\nIn Britain, Winston Churchill, a prominent Conservative politician who was then out of office but later became its prime minister, became a vigorous and articulate critic of Gandhi and opponent of his long-term plans. Churchill often ridiculed Gandhi, saying in a widely reported 1931 speech:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;It is alarming and also nauseating to see Mr Gandhi, a seditious Middle Temple lawyer, now posing as a fakir of a type well known in the East, striding half-naked up the steps of the Vice-regal palace...to parley on equal terms with the representative of the King-Emperor.\nChurchill's bitterness against Gandhi grew in the 1930s. He called Gandhi as the one who was \"seditious in aim\" whose evil genius and multiform menace was attacking the British empire. Churchill called him a dictator, a \"Hindu Mussolini\", fomenting a race war, trying to replace the Raj with Brahmin cronies, playing on the ignorance of Indian masses, all for selfish gain. Churchill attempted to isolate Gandhi, and his criticism of Gandhi was widely covered by European and American press. It gained Churchill sympathetic support, but it also increased support for Gandhi among Europeans. The developments heightened Churchill's anxiety that the \"British themselves would give up out of pacifism and misplaced conscience.\"\nRound Table Conferences.\nDuring the discussions between Gandhi and the British government over 1931\u201332 at the Round Table Conferences, Gandhi, now aged about 62, sought constitutional reforms as a preparation to the end of colonial British rule, and begin the self-rule by Indians. The British side sought reforms that would keep the Indian subcontinent as a colony. The British negotiators proposed constitutional reforms on a British Dominion model that established separate electorates based on religious and social divisions. The British questioned the Congress party and Gandhi's authority to speak for all of India. They invited Indian religious leaders, such as Muslims and Sikhs, to press their demands along religious lines, as well as B. R. Ambedkar as the representative leader of the untouchables. Gandhi vehemently opposed a constitution that enshrined rights or representations based on communal divisions, because he feared that it would not bring people together but divide them, perpetuate their status, and divert the attention from India's struggle to end the colonial rule.\nThe Second Round Table conference was the only time Gandhi left India between 1914 and his death in 1948. He was accompanied by his secretary Mahadev Desai, son Devdas Gandhi and British supporter Mirabehn. Gandhi declined the government's offer of accommodation in an expensive West End hotel, preferring to stay in the East End, to live among working-class people, as he did in India. Gandhi based himself in a small cell-bedroom at his friend Muriel Lester's \"People's House\" at Kingsley Hall for the three-month duration of his stay. He was enthusiastically received by East Enders. Local children gave him toys for his birthday and Lester noted that he would gently place them on window sills and in carriages during his stay and took them back to India. During this time, Gandhi also renewed his links with the British vegetarian movement.\nAfter Gandhi returned from the Second Round Table conference, he started a new \"satyagraha\". Gandhi was arrested and imprisoned at the Yerwada Jail, Pune. While he was in prison, the British government enacted a new law that granted untouchables a separate electorate. It came to be known as the Communal Award. In protest, Gandhi started a fast-unto-death, while he was held in prison. The resulting public outcry forced the government, in consultations with Ambedkar, to replace the Communal Award with a compromise Poona Pact.\nCongress politics.\nIn 1934, Gandhi resigned from Congress party membership. He did not disagree with the party's position, but felt that if he resigned, Gandhi's popularity with Indians would cease to stifle the party's membership, which actually varied, including communists, socialists, trade unionists, students, religious conservatives, and those with pro-business convictions, and that these various voices would get a chance to make themselves heard. Gandhi also wanted to avoid being a target for Raj propaganda by leading a party that had temporarily accepted political accommodation with the Raj.\nIn 1936, Gandhi returned to active politics again with the Nehru presidency and the Lucknow session of the Congress. Although Gandhi wanted a total focus on the task of winning independence and not speculation about India's future, he did not restrain the Congress from adopting socialism as its goal. Gandhi had a clash with Subhas Chandra Bose, who had been elected president in 1938, and who had previously expressed a lack of faith in nonviolence as a means of protest. Despite Gandhi's opposition, Bose won a second term as Congress President, against Gandhi's nominee, Bhogaraju Pattabhi Sitaramayya. Gandhi declared that Sitaramayya's defeat was his defeat. Bose later left the Congress when the All-India leaders resigned en masse in protest of his abandonment of the principles introduced by Gandhi.\nWorld War II and \"Quit India movement\".\nGandhi opposed providing any help to the British war effort and he campaigned against any Indian participation in World War II. The British government responded with the arrests of Gandhi and many other Congress leaders and killed over 1,000 Indians who participated in this movement. A number of violent attacks were also carried out by the nationalists against the British government. While Gandhi's campaign did not enjoy the support of a number of Indian leaders, and over 2.5\u00a0million Indians volunteered and joined the British military to fight on various fronts of the Allied Forces, the movement played a role in weakening the control over the South Asian region by the British regime and it ultimately paved the way for Indian independence.\nGandhi's opposition to the Indian participation in World War II was motivated by his belief that India could not be party to a war ostensibly being fought for democratic freedom while that freedom was denied to India itself. Gandhi also condemned Nazism and Fascism, a view which won endorsement of other Indian leaders. As the war progressed, Gandhi intensified his demand for independence, calling for the British to \"Quit India\" in a 1942 speech in Mumbai. This was Gandhi's and the Congress Party's most definitive revolt aimed at securing the British exit from India. The British government responded quickly to the Quit India speech, and within hours after Gandhi's speech arrested Gandhi and all the members of the Congress Working Committee. His countrymen retaliated the arrests by damaging or burning down hundreds of government owned railway stations, police stations, and cutting down telegraph wires.\nIn 1942, Gandhi now nearing age 73, urged his people to completely stop co-operating with the imperial government. In this effort, Gandhi urged that they neither kill nor injure British people but be willing to suffer and die if violence is initiated by the British officials. He clarified that the movement would not be stopped because of any individual acts of violence, saying that the \"ordered anarchy\" of \"the present system of administration\" was \"worse than real anarchy.\" Gandhi urged Indians to \"karo ya maro\" (\"do or die\") in the cause of their rights and freedoms.\nGandhi's arrest lasted two years, as he was held in the Aga Khan Palace in Pune. During this period, Gandhi's longtime secretary Mahadev Desai died of a heart attack, his wife Kasturba died after 18 months' imprisonment on 22 February 1944, and Gandhi suffered a severe malaria attack. While in jail, he agreed to an interview with Stuart Gelder, a British journalist. Gelder then composed and released an interview summary, cabled it to the mainstream press, that announced sudden concessions Gandhi was willing to make, comments that shocked his countrymen, the Congress workers and even Gandhi. The latter two claimed that it distorted what Gandhi actually said on a range of topics and falsely repudiated the Quit India movement.\nGandhi was released before the end of the war on 6 May 1944 because of his failing health and necessary surgery; the Raj did not want him to die in prison and enrage the nation. Gandhi came out of detention to an altered political scene \u2013 the Muslim League for example, which a few years earlier had appeared marginal, \"now occupied the centre of the political stage\" and the topic of Jinnah's campaign for Pakistan was a major talking point. Gandhi and Jinnah had extensive correspondence and the two men met several times over a period of two weeks in September 1944 at Jinnah's house in Bombay, where Gandhi insisted on a united religiously plural and independent India which included Muslims and non-Muslims of the Indian subcontinent coexisting. Jinnah rejected this proposal and insisted instead for partitioning the subcontinent on religious lines to create a separate Muslim homeland (later Pakistan). These discussions continued through 1947.\nWhile the leaders of Congress languished in jail, the other parties supported the war and gained organisational strength. Underground publications flailed at the ruthless suppression of Congress, but it had little control over events. At the end of the war, the British gave clear indications that power would be transferred to Indian hands. At this point, Gandhi called off the struggle, and around 100,000 political prisoners were released, including the Congress's leadership.\nPartition and independence.\nGandhi opposed the partition of the Indian subcontinent along religious lines. The Indian National Congress and Gandhi called for the British to Quit India. However, the All-India Muslim League demanded \"Divide and Quit India.\" Gandhi suggested an agreement which required the Congress and the Muslim League to co-operate and attain independence under a provisional government, thereafter, the question of partition could be resolved by a plebiscite in the districts with a Muslim majority.\nJinnah rejected Gandhi's proposal and called for Direct Action Day, on 16 August 1946, to press Muslims to publicly gather in cities and support his proposal for the partition of the Indian subcontinent into a Muslim state and non-Muslim state. Huseyn Shaheed Suhrawardy, the Muslim League Chief Minister of Bengal \u2013 now Bangladesh and West Bengal (excluding Cooch Behar), gave Calcutta's police special holiday to celebrate the Direct Action Day. The Direct Action Day triggered a mass murder of Calcutta Hindus and the torching of their property, and holidaying police were missing to contain or stop the conflict. The British government did not order its army to move in to contain the violence. The violence on Direct Action Day led to retaliatory violence against Muslims across India. Thousands of Hindus and Muslims were murdered, and tens of thousands were injured in the cycle of violence in the days that followed. Gandhi visited the most riot-prone areas to appeal a stop to the massacres.\nArchibald Wavell, the Viceroy and Governor-General of British India for three years through February 1947, had worked with Gandhi and Jinnah to find a common ground, before and after accepting Indian independence in principle. Wavell condemned Gandhi's character and motives as well as his ideas. Wavell accused Gandhi of harbouring the single-minded idea to \"overthrow British rule and influence and to establish a Hindu raj\", and called Gandhi a \"malignant, malevolent, exceedingly shrewd\" politician. Wavell feared a civil war on the Indian subcontinent, and doubted Gandhi would be able to stop it.\nThe British reluctantly agreed to grant independence to the people of the Indian subcontinent, but accepted Jinnah's proposal of partitioning the land into Pakistan and India. Gandhi was involved in the final negotiations, but Stanley Wolpert states the \"plan to carve up British India was never approved of or accepted by Gandhi\".\nThe partition was controversial and violently disputed. More than half a million were killed in religious riots as 10 million to 12 million non-Muslims (Hindus and Sikhs mostly) migrated from Pakistan into India, and Muslims migrated from India into Pakistan, across the newly created borders of India, West Pakistan and East Pakistan.\nGandhi spent the day of independence not celebrating the end of the British rule, but appealing for peace among his countrymen by fasting and spinning in Calcutta on 15 August 1947. The partition had gripped the Indian subcontinent with religious violence and the streets were filled with corpses. Gandhi's fasting and protests are credited for stopping the religious riots and communal violence. His final fast took place from 13\u201318 January 1948, just days before his assassination.\nDeath.\nAt 5:17 p.m. on 30 January 1948, Gandhi was with his grandnieces in the garden of Birla House (now Gandhi Smriti), on his way to address a prayer meeting, when Nathuram Godse, a Hindu nationalist, fired three bullets into Gandhi's chest from a pistol at close range. According to some accounts, Gandhi died instantly. In other accounts, such as one prepared by an eyewitness journalist, he was carried into the Birla House, into a bedroom. There, he died about 30 minutes later as a family member read verses from Hindu scriptures.\nPrime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru addressed his countrymen over the All-India Radio saying:\nFriends and comrades, the light has gone out of our lives, and there is darkness everywhere, and I do not quite know what to tell you or how to say it. Our beloved leader, Bapu as we called him, the father of the nation, is no more. Perhaps I am wrong to say that; nevertheless, we will not see him again, as we have seen him for these many years, we will not run to him for advice or seek solace from him, and that is a terrible blow, not only for me, but for millions and millions in this country.\nGodse, a Hindu nationalist, with links to the Hindu Mahasabha and the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, made no attempt to escape; several other conspirators were soon arrested as well. The accused were Nathuram Vinayak Godse, Narayan Apte, Vinayak Damodar Savarkar, Shankar Kistayya, Dattatraya Parchure, Vishnu Karkare, Madanlal Pahwa, and Gopal Godse.\nThe trial began on 27May 1948 and ran for eight months before Justice Atma Charan passed his final order on 10February 1949. The prosecution called 149 witnesses, the defence none. The court found all of the defendants except one guilty as charged. Eight men were convicted for the murder conspiracy, and others were convicted for violation of the Explosive Substances Act. Savarkar was acquitted and set free. Nathuram Godse and Narayan Apte were sentenced to death by hanging while the remaining six (including Godse's brother, Gopal) were sentenced to life imprisonment.\nFuneral and memorials.\nGandhi's death was mourned nationwide. Over a million people joined the five-mile-long funeral procession that took over five hours to reach Raj Ghat from Birla house, where Gandhi was assassinated, and another million watched the procession pass by. His body was transported on a weapons carrier, whose chassis was dismantled overnight to allow a high-floor to be installed so that people could catch a glimpse of Gandhi's body. The engine of the vehicle was not used; instead, four drag-ropes held by 50 people each pulled the vehicle. All Indian-owned establishments in London remained closed in mourning as thousands of people from all faiths and denominations and Indians from all over Britain converged at India House in London.\nGandhi was cremated in accordance with Hindu tradition. His ashes were poured into urns which were sent across India for memorial services. Most of the ashes were immersed at the Sangam at Allahabad on 12 February 1948, but some were secretly taken away. In 1997, Tushar Gandhi immersed the contents of one urn, found in a bank vault and reclaimed through the courts, at the Sangam at Allahabad. Some of Gandhi's ashes were scattered at the source of the Nile River near Jinja, Uganda, and a memorial plaque marks the event. On 30 January 2008, the contents of another urn were immersed at Girgaum Chowpatty. Another urn is at the palace of the Aga Khan in Pune (where Gandhi was held as a political prisoner from 1942 to 1944) and another in the Self-Realization Fellowship Lake Shrine in Los Angeles.\nThe Birla House site where Gandhi was assassinated is now a memorial called Gandhi Smriti. The place near Yamuna River where he was cremated is the R\u0101j Gh\u0101t memorial in New Delhi. A black marble platform, it bears the epigraph \"H\u0113 R\u0101ma\" (Devanagari: \"\u0939\u0947 ! \u0930\u093e\u092e\" or, \"Hey Raam\"). These are said to be Gandhi's last words after he was shot.\nPrinciples, practices, and beliefs.\nGandhi's spirituality was greatly based on his embracement of the five great vows of Jainism and Hindu Yoga philosophy, viz. \"Satya\" (truth), \"ahimsa\" (nonviolence), \"brahmacharya\" (celibacy), \"asteya\" (non-stealing), and \"aparigraha\" (non-attachment). He stated that \"Unless you impose on yourselves the five vows you may not embark on the experiment at all.\" Gandhi's statements, letters and life have attracted much political and scholarly analysis of his principles, practices and beliefs, including what influenced him. Some writers present Gandhi as a paragon of ethical living and pacifism, while others present him as a more complex, contradictory and evolving character influenced by his culture and circumstances.\nTruth and Satyagraha.\nGandhi dedicated his life to discovering and pursuing truth, or \"Satya\", and called his movement satyagraha, which means \"appeal to, insistence on, or reliance on the Truth.\" The first formulation of the \"satyagraha\" as a political movement and principle occurred in 1920, which Gandhi tabled as \"Resolution on Non-cooperation\" in September that year before a session of the Indian Congress. It was the \"satyagraha\" formulation and step, states Dennis Dalton, that deeply resonated with beliefs and culture of his people, embedded him into the popular consciousness, transforming him quickly into Mahatma.\nGandhi based \"Satyagraha\" on the Vedantic ideal of self-realisation, ahimsa (nonviolence), vegetarianism, and universal love. William Borman states that the key to his \"satyagraha\" is rooted in the Hindu Upanishadic texts. According to Indira Carr, Gandhi's ideas on \"ahimsa\" and \"satyagraha\" were founded on the philosophical foundations of Advaita Vedanta. I. Bruce Watson states that some of these ideas are found not only in traditions within Hinduism, but also in Jainism or Buddhism, particularly those about non-violence, vegetarianism and universal love, but Gandhi's synthesis was to politicise these ideas. His concept of \"satya\" as a civil movement, states Glyn Richards, are best understood in the context of the Hindu terminology of Dharma and \"\u1e5ata\".\nGandhi stated that the most important battle to fight was overcoming his own demons, fears, and insecurities. Gandhi summarised his beliefs first when he said, \"God is Truth.\" Gandhi would later change this statement to \"Truth is God.\" Thus, \"satya\" (truth) in Gandhi's philosophy is \"God\". Gandhi, states Richards, described the term \"God\" not as a separate power, but as the Being (Brahman, Atman) of the Advaita Vedanta tradition, a nondual universal that pervades in all things, in each person and all life. According to Nicholas Gier, this to Gandhi meant the unity of God and humans, that all beings have the same one soul and therefore equality, that \"atman\" exists and is same as everything in the universe, ahimsa (non-violence) is the very nature of this \"atman\".\nThe essence of Satyagraha is \"soul force\" as a political means, refusing to use brute force against the oppressor, seeking to eliminate antagonisms between the oppressor and the oppressed, aiming to transform or \"purify\" the oppressor. It is not inaction but determined passive resistance and non-co-operation where, states Arthur Herman, \"love conquers hate\". A euphemism sometimes used for Satyagraha is that it is a \"silent force\" or a \"soul force\" (a term also used by Martin Luther King Jr. during his \"I Have a Dream\" speech). It arms the individual with moral power rather than physical power. Satyagraha is also termed a \"universal force\", as it essentially \"makes no distinction between kinsmen and strangers, young and old, man and woman, friend and foe.\"\nGandhi wrote: \"There must be no impatience, no barbarity, no insolence, no undue pressure. If we want to cultivate a true spirit of democracy, we cannot afford to be intolerant. Intolerance betrays want of faith in one's cause.\" Civil disobedience and non-co-operation as practised under Satyagraha are based on the \"law of suffering\", a doctrine that \"the endurance of suffering is a means to an end\". This end usually implies a moral upliftment or progress of an individual or society. Therefore, non-co-operation in Satyagraha is in fact a means to secure the co-operation of the opponent consistently with truth and justice.\nWhile Gandhi's idea of \"satyagraha\" as a political means attracted a widespread following among Indians, the support was not universal. For example, Muslim leaders such as Jinnah opposed the \"satyagraha\" idea, accused Gandhi to be reviving Hinduism through political activism, and began effort to counter Gandhi with Muslim nationalism and a demand for Muslim homeland. The untouchability leader Ambedkar, in June 1945, after his decision to convert to Buddhism and the first Law and Justice minister of modern India, dismissed Gandhi's ideas as loved by \"blind Hindu devotees\", primitive, influenced by spurious brew of Tolstoy and Ruskin, and \"there is always some simpleton to preach them\". Winston Churchill caricatured Gandhi as a \"cunning huckster\" seeking selfish gain, an \"aspiring dictator\", and an \"atavistic spokesman of a pagan Hinduism.\" Churchill stated that the civil disobedience movement spectacle of Gandhi only increased \"the danger to which white people there [British India] are exposed.\"\nNonviolence.\nAlthough Gandhi was not the originator of the principle of nonviolence, he was the first to apply it in the political field on a large scale. The concept of nonviolence (\"ahimsa\") has a long history in Indian religious thought, and is considered the highest dharma (ethical value/virtue), a precept to be observed towards all living beings (\"sarvbhuta\"), at all times (\"sarvada\"), in all respects (\"sarvatha\"), in action, words and thought. Gandhi explains his philosophy and ideas about \"ahimsa\" as a political means in his autobiography \"The Story of My Experiments with Truth\".\nAlthough Gandhi considered non-violence to be \"infinitely superior to violence\", he preferred violence to cowardice. Gandhi added that he \"would rather have India resort to arms in order to defend her honor than that she should in a cowardly manner become or remain a helpless witness to her own dishonor.\"\nBrahmacharya: abstinence from sex and food.\nAlong with many other texts, Gandhi studied the Bhagavad Gita while in South Africa. This Hindu scripture discusses jnana yoga, bhakti yoga and karma yoga along with virtues such as non-violence, patience, integrity, lack of hypocrisy, self restraint and abstinence. Gandhi began experiments with these, and in 1906 at age 37, although married, he vowed to abstain from sexual relations.\nGandhi's experiment with abstinence went beyond sex, and extended to food. He consulted the Jain scholar Shrimad Rajchandra, whom he fondly called Raychandbhai. Rajchandra advised him that milk stimulated sexual passion. Gandhi began abstaining from cow's milk in 1912, and did so even when doctors advised him to consume milk. According to Sankar Ghose, Tagore described Gandhi as someone who did not abhor sex or women, but considered sexual life as inconsistent with his moral goals.\nGandhi tried to test and prove to himself his \"brahmacharya\". The experiments began some time after the death of his wife in February 1944. At the start of his experiment, he had women sleep in the same room but in different beds. He later slept with women in the same bed, often naked. In April 1945, Gandhi referenced sleeping with several \"women or girls\" in a letter to Birla as part of the experiments. According to the 1960s memoir of his grandniece Manu, Gandhi feared in early 1947 that he and she may be killed by Muslims in the run-up to India's independence in August 1947, and asked her when she was 18 years old if she wanted to help him with his experiments to test their \"purity\", for which she readily accepted. Gandhi also shared his bed with 18-year-old Abha, wife of his grandnephew Kanu. Gandhi would sleep with both Manu and Abha at the same time. According to Vinay Lal, Gandhi slept naked with Manu and Abha several times, in order to test his celibacy and his will to abstain from committing sexual acts, in order to fulfill the conditions he felt were required in order to become a \"brahmacharya.\"\nAccording to Sean Scalmer, Gandhi in his final year of life was an ascetic, and his sickly skeletal figure was caricatured in Western media. In February 1947, he asked his confidants such as Birla and Ramakrishna if it was wrong for him to experiment his \"brahmacharya\" oath. Gandhi's public experiments, as they progressed, were widely discussed and criticised by his family members and leading politicians. However, Gandhi said that if he would not let Manu sleep with him, it would be a sign of weakness. Some of his staff resigned, including two of his newspaper's editors who had refused to print some of Gandhi's sermons dealing with his experiments. Nirmalkumar Bose, Gandhi's Bengali interpreter, for example, criticised Gandhi, not because Gandhi did anything wrong, but because Bose was concerned about the psychological effect on the women who participated in his experiments. Veena Howard states Gandhi's views on brahmacharya and religious renunciation experiments were a method to confront women issues in his times.\nGandhi also supported alcohol abstinence, advocating Prohibition as the only effective way to deal with alcohol usage.\nLiterary works.\nGandhi was a prolific writer. His signature style was simple, precise, clear and devoid of artificialities. One of Gandhi's earliest publications, \"Hind Swaraj\", published in Gujarati in 1909, became \"the intellectual blueprint\" for India's independence movement. The book was translated into English the next year, with a copyright legend that read \"No Rights Reserved\". For decades, Gandhi edited several newspapers including \"Harijan\" in Gujarati, in Hindi and in the English language; \"Indian Opinion\" while in South Africa and, \"Young India\", in English, and \"Navajivan\", a Gujarati monthly, on his return to India. Later, \"Navajivan\" was also published in Hindi. Gandhi also wrote letters almost every day to individuals and newspapers.\nGandhi also wrote several books, including his autobiography, \"The Story of My Experiments with Truth\" (), of which Gandhi bought the entire first edition to make sure it was reprinted. His other autobiographies included: \"Satyagraha in South Africa\" about his struggle there, \"Hind Swaraj or Indian Home Rule\", a political pamphlet, and a paraphrase in Gujarati of John Ruskin's \"Unto This Last\" which was an early critique of political economy. This last essay can be considered his programme on economics. Gandhi also wrote extensively on vegetarianism, diet and health, religion, social reforms, etc. Gandhi usually wrote in Gujarati, though he also revised the Hindi and English translations of his books. In 1934, Gandhi wrote \"Songs from Prison\" while prisoned in Yerawada jail in Maharashtra.\nGandhi's complete works were published by the Indian government under the name \"\" in the 1960s. The writings comprise about 50,000 pages published in about 100 volumes. In 2000, a revised edition of the complete works sparked a controversy, as it contained a large number of errors and omissions. The Indian government later withdrew the revised edition.\nLegacy.\nGandhi is noted as the greatest figure of the successful Indian independence movement against the British rule. He is also hailed as the greatest figure of modern India. American historian Stanley Wolpert described Gandhi as \"India's greatest revolutionary nationalist leader\" and the greatest Indian since the Buddha. In 1999, Gandhi was named \"Asian of the century\" by \"Asiaweek\". In a 2000 BBC poll, he was voted as the greatest man of the millennium.\nThe word \"Mahatma\", while often mistaken for Gandhi's given name in the West, is taken from the Sanskrit words \"maha\" (meaning \"Great\") and \"atma\" (meaning \"Soul\"). He was publicly bestowed with the honorific title \"Mahatma\" in July 1914 at farewell meeting in Town Hall, Durban. Rabindranath Tagore is said to have accorded the title to Gandhi by 1915. In his autobiography, Gandhi nevertheless explains that he never valued the title, and was often pained by it.\nInnumerable streets, roads, and localities in India are named after Gandhi. These include M.G. Road (the main street of a number of Indian cities including Mumbai, Bangalore, Kolkata, Lucknow, Kanpur, Gangtok and Indore), Gandhi Market (near Sion, Mumbai) and Gandhinagar (the capital of the state of Gujarat, Gandhi's birthplace).\nAs of 2008, over 150 countries have released stamps on Gandhi. In October 2019, about 87 countries including Turkey, the United States, Russia, Iran, Uzbekistan, and Palestine released commemorative Gandhi stamps on the 150th anniversary of his birth.\nIn 2014, Brisbane's Indian community commissioned a statue of Gandhi, created by Ram V. Sutar and Anil Sutar in the Roma Street Parkland, It was unveiled by Narendra Modi, then Prime Minister of India.\nFlorian asteroid 120461 Gandhi was named in his honour in September 2020. In October 2022, a statue of Gandhi was installed in Astana on the embankment of the rowing canal, opposite the cult monument to the defenders of Kazakhstan.\nOn 15 December 2022, the United Nations headquarters in New York unveiled the statue of Gandhi. UN Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres called Gandhi an \"uncompromising advocate for peaceful co-existence.\"\nOn 11 April 2025, the Anglo-Boer War Museum in Bloemfontein, South Africa launched a documentary called \"Caught in the Crossfire: Indian Involvement in the South African War\", and unveiled a bust of Gandhi. This was part of the museum's initiatives to acknowledge the role of Indian individuals \u2014 soldiers, stretcher-bearers and civilians \u2014 who were caught in the conflict between the British and the Boers during the Second Boer War.\nFollowers and international influence.\nGandhi influenced important leaders and political movements. Leaders of the civil rights movement in the United States, including Martin Luther King Jr., James Lawson, and James Bevel, drew from the writings of Gandhi in the development of their own theories about nonviolence. King said, \"Christ gave us the goals and Mahatma Gandhi the tactics.\" King sometimes referred to Gandhi as \"the little brown saint.\" Anti-apartheid activist and former President of South Africa, Nelson Mandela, was inspired by Gandhi. Others include Steve Biko, V\u00e1clav Havel, and Aung San Suu Kyi.\nIn his early years, the former President of South Africa Nelson Mandela was a follower of the nonviolent resistance philosophy of Gandhi. Bhana and Vahed commented on these events as \"Gandhi inspired succeeding generations of South African activists seeking to end White rule. This legacy connects him to Nelson Mandela...in a sense, Mandela completed what Gandhi started.\"\nGandhi's life and teachings inspired many who specifically referred to Gandhi as their mentor or who dedicated their lives to spreading his ideas. In Europe, Romain Rolland was the first to discuss Gandhi in his 1924 book \"Mahatma Gandhi\", and Brazilian anarchist and feminist Maria Lacerda de Moura wrote about Gandhi in her work on pacifism. In 1931, physicist Albert Einstein exchanged letters with Gandhi and called him \"a role model for the generations to come\" in a letter writing about him. Einstein said of Gandhi:\nMahatma Gandhi's life achievement stands unique in political history. He has invented a completely new and humane means for the liberation war of an oppressed country, and practised it with greatest energy and devotion. The moral influence he had on the consciously thinking human being of the entire civilised world will probably be much more lasting than it seems in our time with its overestimation of brutal violent forces. Because lasting will only be the work of such statesmen who wake up and strengthen the moral power of their people through their example and educational works. We may all be happy and grateful that destiny gifted us with such an enlightened contemporary, a role model for the generations to come. Generations to come will scarce believe that such a one as this walked the earth in flesh and blood.\nFarah Omar, a political activist from Somaliland, visited India in 1930, where he met Gandhi and was influenced by Gandhi's non-violent philosophy, which he adopted in his campaign in British Somaliland.\nLanza del Vasto went to India in 1936 intending to live with Gandhi; he later returned to Europe to spread Gandhi's philosophy and founded the Community of the Ark in 1948 (modelled after Gandhi's ashrams). Madeleine Slade (known as \"Mirabehn\") was the daughter of a British admiral who spent much of her adult life in India as a devotee of Gandhi.\nIn addition, the British musician John Lennon referred to Gandhi when discussing his views on nonviolence. In 2007, former US Vice-President and environmentalist Al Gore drew upon Gandhi's idea of \"satyagraha\" in a speech on climate change. 44th President of the United States Barack Obama said in September 2009 that his biggest inspiration came from Gandhi. His reply was in response to the question: \"Who was the one person, dead or live, that you would choose to dine with?\" Obama added, \"He's somebody I find a lot of inspiration in. He inspired Dr. King with his message of nonviolence. He ended up doing so much and changed the world just by the power of his ethics.\"\n\"Time\" magazine named The 14th Dalai Lama, Lech Wa\u0142\u0119sa, Martin Luther King Jr., Cesar Chavez, Aung San Suu Kyi, Benigno Aquino Jr., Desmond Tutu, and Nelson Mandela as \"Children of Gandhi\" and his spiritual heirs to nonviolence. The Mahatma Gandhi District in Houston, Texas, United States, an ethnic Indian enclave, is officially named after Gandhi.\nGandhi's ideas had a significant influence on 20th-century philosophy. It began with his engagement with Romain Rolland and Martin Buber. Jean-Luc Nancy said that the French philosopher Maurice Blanchot engaged critically with Gandhi from the point of view of \"European spirituality.\" Since then philosophers including Hannah Arendt, Etienne Balibar and Slavoj \u017di\u017eek found that Gandhi was a necessary reference to discuss morality in politics. American political scientist Gene Sharp wrote an analytical text, Gandhi as a political strategist, on the significance of Gandhi's ideas, for creating nonviolent social change. Recently, in the light of climate change, Gandhi's views on technology are gaining importance in the fields of environmental philosophy and philosophy of technology.\nGlobal days that celebrate Gandhi.\nIn 2007, the United Nations General Assembly declared Gandhi's birthday, 2 October, as \"the International Day of Nonviolence\". First proposed by UNESCO in 1948, as the School Day of Nonviolence and Peace (DENIP in Spanish), 30 January is observed as the School Day of Nonviolence and Peace in schools of many countries. In countries with a Southern Hemisphere school calendar, it is observed on 30 March.\nAwards.\n\"Time\" magazine named Gandhi the Man of the Year in 1930. In the same magazine's 1999 list of The Most Important People of the Century, Gandhi was second only to Albert Einstein, who had called Gandhi \"the greatest man of our age.\" The University of Nagpur awarded him an LL.D. in 1937. The Government of India awarded the annual Gandhi Peace Prize to distinguished social workers, world leaders and citizens. Nelson Mandela, the leader of South Africa's struggle to eradicate racial discrimination and segregation, was a prominent non-Indian recipient. In 2003, Gandhi was posthumously awarded with the World Peace Prize. Two years later, he was posthumously awarded with the Order of the Companions of O. R. Tambo. In 2011, Gandhi topped the \"Time\"'s list of Top 25 Political Icons of All Time.\nGandhi did not receive the Nobel Peace Prize, although he was nominated five times between 1937 and 1948, including the first-ever nomination by the American Friends Service Committee, though Gandhi made the short list only twice, in 1937 and 1947. Decades later, the Nobel Committee publicly declared its regret for the omission and admitted to deeply divided nationalistic opinion denying the award. Gandhi was nominated in 1948 but was assassinated before nominations closed. That year, the committee chose not to award the peace prize stating that \"there was no suitable living candidate\", and later research shows that the possibility of awarding the prize posthumously to Gandhi was discussed and that the reference to no suitable living candidate was to Gandhi. Geir Lundestad, Secretary of Norwegian Nobel Committee in 2006 said, \"The greatest omission in our 106-year history is undoubtedly that Mahatma Gandhi never received the Nobel Peace Prize. Gandhi could do without the Nobel Peace Prize, whether Nobel committee can do without Gandhi is the question.\" When the 14th Dalai Lama was awarded the Prize in 1989, the chairman of the committee said that this was \"in part a tribute to the memory of Mahatma Gandhi.\" In the summer of 1995, the North American Vegetarian Society inducted Gandhi posthumously into the Vegetarian Hall of Fame.\nFather of the Nation.\nIndians widely describe Gandhi as the Father of the Nation. Origin of this title is traced back to a radio address (on Singapore radio) on 6 July 1944 by Subhash Chandra Bose where Bose addressed Gandhi as \"The Father of the Nation\". On 28 April 1947, Sarojini Naidu during a conference also referred Gandhi as \"Father of the Nation\". He is also conferred the title \"Bapu\" (Gujarati: endearment for \"father\", \"papa\").\n21st-century impact within India.\nIndia, with its rapid economic modernisation and urbanisation, has rejected Gandhi's economics but accepted much of his politics and continues to revere his memory. Reporter Jim Yardley notes that \"modern India is hardly a Gandhian nation, if it ever was one. His vision of a village-dominated economy was shunted aside during his lifetime as rural romanticism, and his call for a national ethos of personal austerity and nonviolence has proved antithetical to the goals of an aspiring economic and military power.\" By contrast, Gandhi is \"given full credit for India's political identity as a tolerant, secular democracy.\"\nGandhi's birthday, 2 October, is a national holiday in India, Gandhi Jayanti. His image also appears on paper currency of all denominations issued by Reserve Bank of India, except for the one rupee note. Gandhi's date of death, 30 January, is commemorated as a Martyrs' Day in India.\nThere are three temples in India dedicated to Gandhi. One is located at Sambalpur in Odisha, the second at Nidaghatta village near Kadur in Chikmagalur district of Karnataka, and the third at Chityal in the district of Nalgonda, Telangana. The Gandhi Memorial in Kanyakumari resembles central Indian Hindu temples and the Tamukkam or Summer Palace in Madurai now houses the Mahatma Gandhi Museum.\nDescendants.\nGandhi's children and grandchildren live in India and other countries. Grandson Rajmohan Gandhi is a professor in Illinois and an author of Gandhi's biography titled \"Mohandas\", while another, Tarun Gandhi, has authored several authoritative books on his grandfather. Another grandson, Kanu Ramdas Gandhi (the son of Gandhi's third son Ramdas), was found living at an old age home in Delhi despite having taught earlier in the United States.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nGeneral and cited references.\nBooks\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nScholarly articles\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nPrimary sources\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "19381", "revid": "101805", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19381", "title": "Miyamoto Musashi", "text": "Japanese swordsman, philosopher, strategist, writer, artist, and r\u014dnin\n was a Japanese swordsman, strategist, artist and writer who became renowned through stories of his unique double-bladed swordsmanship and undefeated record in his 62 duels. Miyamoto is considered a \"kensei\" (sword saint) of Japan. He was the founder of the Niten Ichi-ry\u016b (or Nito Ichi-ry\u016b) style of swordsmanship, and in his final years authored and \"Dokk\u014dd\u014d\" (\u7368\u884c\u9053, \"The Path of Aloneness\").\nBoth documents were bequeathed to Terao Magonoj\u014d, Miyamoto's most important student, seven days before Musashi's death. \"The Book of Five Rings\" focuses on the character of his Niten Ichi-ry\u016b school in a concrete sense; his own practical martial art and its generic significance. On the other hand, \"The Path of Aloneness\" deals with the ideas that lie behind it, as well as his life's philosophy in a few short aphoristic sentences. \nIt is believed that Miyamoto was a friend of Mizuno Katsunari, a Tokugawa shogunate general. They fought together in the Battle of Sekigahara, Siege of Osaka, and Shimabara Rebellion as part of the Tokugawa Army.\nThe Miyamoto Musashi Budokan training center in \u014chara-ch\u014d (Mimasaka), Okayama Prefecture, Japan, was erected in honor of him.\nBiography.\nDetails of Miyamoto Musashi's early life are difficult to verify. Musashi writes in \"The Book of Five Rings\" (\"Go Rin No Sho\") that he was born in Miyamoto, a village in Harima Province. \"Niten Ki\", an early biography of Musashi, supports the assertion that Musashi was born in 1583. \"[He] was born in Bansh\u016b, in Tensh\u014d 12 [1583], the Year of the Goat.\" The historian Kamiko Tadashi, commenting on Musashi's text, notes: \"Munisai was Musashi's father\u00a0... he lived in Miyamoto village, in the Yoshino district [of Mimasaka Province]. Musashi was most probably born here.\"\nMusashi gives his full name and title in \"The Book of Five Rings\" as Shinmen Musashi-no-Kami Fujiwara no Harunobu (\u65b0\u514d\u6b66\u8535\u5b88\u85e4\u539f\u7384\u4fe1) . His father, Shinmen Munisai (\u65b0\u514d\u7121\u4e8c\u658e) was an accomplished martial artist and master of the sword and \"jutte\" (also \"jitte\"). Munisai, in turn, was the son of Hirata Sh\u014dgen (\u5e73\u7530\u5c06\u76e3), a vassal of Shinmen \"Iga no Kami\", the lord of Takayama Castle in the Yoshino district of Mimasaka Province. Hirata was relied upon by Lord Shinmen and so was allowed to use the Shinmen name. \"Fujiwara\" was the lineage from which Musashi claimed descent. Other names of his include Shinmen Takez\u014d, Miyamoto Bennosuke, and Niten D\u014draku (his Buddhist name). Hirata's wife was Omasa. She died as a result of giving birth to Miyamoto.\nMusashi developed eczema during infancy which had an adverse effect on his appearance. Another story claims that he never bathed himself because he did not want to be surprised unarmed. Historian Kamiko writes, \"For his entire life, Musashi never took a wife, cut his hair, or entered a bath\".\nAccording to \"The Book of Five Rings\", Musashi testified that his first duel occurred when he was still 13 years old. His opponent was a Arima Kihei, a swordsman who practised Kashima Shint\u014d-ry\u016b martial arts that were created by Tsukahara Bokuden. Musashi was victorious. The second duel happened when Musashi was 16 years old, when he won another victory against Tadashima Akiyama, a swordsman who was native to Tajima Province. Musashi's third duel, at age 21 was in Kyoto, where he defeated several students of a famous sword fighting school.\nIn 1599, Musashi left his village at age 15 or 16.\nSekigahara campaign.\nIn 1600, Musashi served in\u00a0Kuroda Yoshitaka's army on the Eastern side and fought in the Battle\u00a0of Ishigakihara\u00a0and the Siege of Fuka Castle against\u00a0\u014ctomo Yoshimune's army from the Western side. \n In this battle, the force of Kuroda Yoshitaka emerged victorious at 21 October.\nFor a long time, the popular theory stated that Musashi participated in the battle of Sekigahara on the Western Army side due to the fact that Shinmen clan was longtime vassal to the Ukita clan. However, recent research by modern Japanese historians challenged the theory, as they asserted that Musashi and his father, Shinmen Munisai, actually sided with The Eastern Army based on the historical records that Munisai no longer served the Ukita clan during that time, and the clan records of Kuroda clan, ally of Tokugawa Ieyasu during the war, had recorded the name of Shinmen Munisai among their vassals who participated in the war. Historians quoted \"The Transmission of Military Art to Master Bushu Genshin\", the record from Tachibana Mineki; vassal of Kuroda clan, and the \"Matsui Clan record\", rejecting that the theory that Musashi fought on the side of Western Army, both in Sekigahara and in Osaka siege 14 years later. Historian Masahide Fukuda has determined that the name of Munisai appeared in Kuroda clan record under the category of \"Kogofudai\", or Kuroda clan vassals who had entered service before 1586. Based on this fact, Fukuda concluded it was natural that Munisai and Musashi were on the Tokugawa side during the war.\nNevertheless despite the consensus among Japanese historians that Musashi fought on the victorious Eastern Army side, its still debated whether Musashi fought in the Sekigahara battle, or in Ishigakihara battle. Japanese history novelist Kengo Tominaga proposed a theory that Musashi during the Sekigahara Campaign did not fight in the main battle of Sekigahara, but instead he fought under Kuroda Yoshitaka against Ishida Mitsunari loyalists from the western provinces in the battle of Ishigakihara, \u014cita Prefecture.\nIn December 1608, It was reported that Musashi met with Mizuno Katsunari, a Tokugawa general. Musashi taught Katsunari the secret techniques of his sword style.\nIn 1611, Musashi learned zazen at My\u014dshin-ji Ky\u016bsh\u016b. Musashi introduced Nagaoka Sado to an official of daimyo (lord) named Hosokawa Tadaoki.\nDuel with Sasaki Kojiro.\nMusashi dueled Sasaki Kojiro, another skilled swordsman, in one of his most famous battles. While there are differing opinions on how it happened, the prevailing notion is that Musashi challenged Kojiro, requesting Hosokawa Tadaoki to organise the time and place. Kojiro agreed to the challenge, scheduled one year later, on 13 April, at Ganry\u016bjima Island. When the date arrived, the island was filled with spectators anxious to witness the duel. \nMusashi, it is said, deliberately arrived late. Kojir\u014d had lost his patience while waiting, and he taunted Musashi for his late arrival, though the latter remained composed. Kojir\u014d was known for fighting with a \"nodachi\", a sword with a long blade. During his journey to the island by boat, Musashi had carved an oar into a \"bokken\", or wooden practice sword. The duel ended when Musashi quickly and fatally struck Kojir\u014d, crushing his skull with a vertical stroke.\nServing under Shogunate army.\nIn 1614, during the Siege of Osaka, it was believed that Musashi participated in the Tokugawa army under the command of Musashi's personal friend, Mizuno Katsushige or also known as Katsunari. Musashi was reportedly carrying the banner of Katsunari, and also acted as bodyguard of Mizuno Katsutoshi, son of Katsunari. It was said in a later era, during the Shimabara Rebellion, that Musashi once told a commander of the Tokugawa army that he had served under Mizuno Katsunari's command during the Osaka siege and knew the military system very well. Miyamoto Mikinosuke, the adopted son of Musashi, also served under Katsunari during this battle. According to the \"Sekisui zatsuwa\", Mikinosuke was also Musashi's paternal relative through his father, Nakagawa Shimanosuke, who was also a vassal of Katsunari. The attendance of Musashi in this conflict under the Mizuno clan also attested by contemporary Oba clan record documents. A document titled \"Munekyu-sama Godeko\" (a collection of Katsunari's words and actions after his retirement) also mentions Mikinosuke.\nIn 1633, Musashi began staying with Hosokawa Tadatoshi, \"daimy\u014d\" of Kumamoto Castle, who had moved to the Kumamoto fief and Kokura, to train and paint. While he engaged in very few duels during this period, one occurred in 1634 at the arrangement of Lord Ogasawara, in which Musashi defeated a lance specialist named Takada Matabei. Musashi officially became the retainer of the Hosokawa lords of Kumamoto in 1640. The \"Niten Ki\" records \"[he] received from Lord Tadatoshi: 17 retainers, a stipend of 300 koku, the rank of \"\u014dkumigashira\" \u5927\u7d44\u982d, and Chiba Castle in Kumamoto as his residence.\"\nIn 1638, Musashi allegedly participated in the suppression of Shimabara Rebellion. In the journal \"Munekyu (Katsunari)-sama\", a collection of statements made by Katsunari Mizuno after his retirement in 1639, there is a story about Mizuno's army during the Shimabara Rebellion: a man named Miyamoto Musashi entered the camp of general Ogasawara Nagatsugu, and Musashi said, \"Last time (at Siege of Osaka), (Mizuno Katsunari) Hyuga-no-Kamidono's clan had this, and I knew the military system very well.\" Musashi continued, \"He is a great general that no one can match.\"\nLater life.\nIn the second month of 1641, Musashi wrote a work called the \"Hyoho Sanju Go\" (\"Thirty-five Instructions on Strategy\") for Hosokawa Tadatoshi. This work overlapped and formed the basis for the later \"The Book of Five Rings\". This was the year that his adopted son, Hirao Yoemon, became Master of Arms for the Owari fief. In 1642, Musashi suffered attacks of neuralgia, foreshadowing his future ill-health.\nIn 1643, he retired to a cave, \"Reigand\u014d\", living as a hermit to write \"The Book of Five Rings\". He finished it in the second month of 1645. On the twelfth of the fifth month, sensing his impending death, he bequeathed his worldly possessions, after giving his manuscript to the younger brother of Terao Magonojo, his closest disciple. Musashi died in Reigand\u014d cave around 13 June 1645 (\"Sh\u014dh\u014d 2, 19th day of the 5th month\"). Allegedly, his death resulted from lung cancer. According to \"Hyoho senshi denki\" (\"Anecdotes About the Deceased Master\"):\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nTimeline.\nThe following timeline of Musashi biography in chronological order (of which is based on the most accurate and most widely accepted information).\nPersonal life.\nIt was said that Musashi practised the way of the warrior and warfare strategy, which entailed the mastery of many art forms beyond that of the sword, such as tea ceremony (sad\u014d), labouring, writing, and painting, all of which Musashi pursued throughout his life.\nThis predominant cultural view of Musashi is somewhat contradicted by old texts such as \"Dobo goen\" (1720), which relay his intimacy with the courtesan Kumoi in his middle age. The \"Bushu Denraiki\" details Musashi fathering a daughter by a courtesan. The daughter is said to have died young which caused him great grief. It is uncertain if this courtesan and Kumoi were the same person. A rumour also connected Musashi with the \"oiran\" Yoshino Tayu.\nNiten Ichi Ryu.\nMusashi created and refined a two-sword \"kenjutsu\" technique called \"niten'ichi\" (\u4e8c\u5929\u4e00, \"two heavens as one\") or \"nit\u014dichi\" (\u4e8c\u5200\u4e00, \"two swords as one\") or \"Niten Ichi-ry\u016b\" In this technique, the swordsman uses \"both\" a large sword, and a \"companion sword\" at the same time\u2014a katana with a wakizashi.\nThe two-handed movements of temple drummers may have inspired him, although it could be that the technique was forged through Musashi's combat experience. \"Jitte\" techniques were taught to him by his father\u2014the \"jitte\" was often used in battle paired with a sword; the \"jitte\" would parry and neutralise the weapon of the enemy while the sword struck or the practitioner grappled with the enemy. Today Musashi's style of swordsmanship is known as Hy\u014dh\u014d Niten Ichi-ry\u016b.\nMusashi was also an expert in throwing weapons. He frequently threw his short sword and instructed others at throwing shuriken. Kenji Tokitsu believes that shuriken methods for the wakizashi were the Niten Ichi Ryu's secret techniques.\nWithin the book, Musashi mentions that the use of two swords within strategy is equally beneficial to those who use the skill for individual duels or large engagements. The idea of using two hands for a sword is an idea that Musashi opposes because there is no fluidity in movement with two hands: \"If you hold a sword with both hands, it is difficult to wield it freely to left and right, so my method is to carry the sword in one hand.\" He also disagrees with the idea of using a sword with two hands on a horse and/or riding on unstable terrain, such as muddy swamps, rice fields, or within crowds of people.\nTo learn the strategy of Ni-Ten Ichi Ry\u016b, Musashi asserts that by training with two long swords, one in each hand, one will be able to overcome the cumbersome nature of using a sword in both hands. Although it is difficult, Musashi agrees that there are times in which the long sword must be used with two hands, but one skilful enough should not need it.\nAfter using two long swords proficiently enough, mastery of a long sword, and a \"companion sword\", most likely a wakizashi, will be much increased: \"When you become used to wielding the long sword, you will gain the power of the Way and wield the sword well.\"\nIn short, it could be seen, from the excerpts from \"The Book of Five Rings\", that real strategy behind Ni-Ten No Ichi Ryu, is that there is no real iron-clad method, path, or type of weaponry specific to the style of Ni-Ten No Ichi Ryu:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;You can win with a long weapon, and yet you can also win with a short weapon. In short, the Way of the Ichi school is the spirit of winning, whatever the weapon and whatever its size.\nReligion.\nEven from an early age, Musashi separated his religion from his involvement in swordsmanship. Excerpts such as the one below, from \"The Book of Five Rings\", demonstrate a philosophy that is thought to have stayed with him throughout his life:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nHowever, the belief that Musashi disliked Shinto the religion is inaccurate, as he criticises the similarly worded Shint\u014d-ry\u016b style of swordsmanship, which is not the religion. In Musashi's \"Dokk\u014dd\u014d\", his stance on religion is further elucidated: \"Respect Buddha and the gods without counting on their help.\"\nAs an artist.\nIn his later years, Musashi said in his \"The Book of Five Rings\": \"When I apply the principle of strategy to the ways of different arts and crafts, I no longer have need for a teacher in any domain.\" He proved this by creating recognised masterpieces of calligraphy and classic ink painting. His paintings are characterised by sumi-e, skilled use of ink washes and an economy of brush stroke. He especially mastered the \"broken ink\" school of landscapes, applying it to other subjects, such as his \"Kobokumeikakuzu\" (\"Shrike Perched on a Withered Branch\"; part of a triptych whose other two members were \"Hotei Walking\" and \"Sparrow on Bamboo\"), his \"Hotei Watching a Cockfight\", and his \"Rozanzu\" (\"Wild Geese Among Reeds\", \u9b6f\u5c71\u56f3). \"The Book of Five Rings\" advocates involvement in calligraphy and other arts as a means of training in the art of war.\nIn Japanese and global culture.\nMiyamoto Musashi Budokan.\nOn 20 May 2000, at the initiative of Sensei Tadashi Chihara the Miyamoto Musashi Budokan was inaugurated. It was built in \u014chara-Cho in the province of Mimasaka, the birthplace of the samurai. Inside the building, the life and journey of Miyamoto Musashi are remembered everywhere. Dedicated to martial arts, the Budokan is the source for all of Japan's official traditional sabre and kendo schools. Practically, historically and culturally it is a junction for martial disciplines in the heart of traditional Japan dedicated to Musashi.\nThe inauguration of the Miyamoto Musashi Budokan perpetuated the twinning established on 4 March 1999, between the inhabitants of \u014chara-Ch\u014d (Japanese province of Mimasaka) and the inhabitants of Gleiz\u00e9. It was formalised in the presence of Sensei Tadashi Chihara, guarantor and tenth in the lineage of Miyamoto Musashi carrying a mandate from the mayor of \u014chara-Ch\u014d, and in the presence of the mayor of Gleiz\u00e9 \u00c9lisabeth Lamure. This event was extended during the mandate of the new mayor of \u014chara-Ch\u014d Fukuda Yoshiaki, by official invitation from Japan and the consequent visit of the mayor of Gleiz\u00e9 for the inauguration of the Miyamoto Musashi Budokan on 10 May 2000, in the presence of personalities and Japanese authorities.\nIn popular culture.\nIn Musashi's time, there were fictional texts resembling comic books and it is difficult to separate fact from fiction when discussing his life. There have been numerous later works of fiction made about or featuring Musashi, including novels, manga, film, anime, and video games.\nEiji Yoshikawa's novel \"Musashi\" (originally a 1930s daily newspaper serial) has greatly influenced successive fictional depictions and is often mistaken for a factual account of Musashi's life.\nHe has been portrayed many times in film, most notably in Hiroshi Inagaki's \"Samurai Trilogy\" (1954\u201356), starring Toshiro Mifune, which was based on Yoshikawa's novel.\nMusashi is also the protagonist of Takehiko Inoue's critically acclaimed manga series, \"Vagabond\", which follows a fictionalized account of his life.\nFinnish metal band, Whispered dedicated the song \"Kensei\" in 2016 to the teachings and life of Musashi. \nSwedish metal band, Sabaton wrote a song about Musashi entitled, \"The Duelist\".\nHe appears as an optional boss in 2025 video game Ghost of Y\u014dtei named \"Takezo the Unrivaled\" after beating other duelists at duelist trees around Ezo.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Typically, MVA is used to address situations where multiple measurements are made on each experimental unit and the relations among these measurements and their structures are important. A modern, overlapping categorization of MVA includes: \nMultivariate analysis can be complicated by the desire to include physics-based analysis to calculate the effects of variables for a hierarchical \"system-of-systems\". Often, studies that wish to use multivariate analysis are stalled by the dimensionality of the problem. These concerns are often eased through the use of surrogate models, highly accurate approximations of the physics-based code. Since surrogate models take the form of an equation, they can be evaluated very quickly. This becomes an enabler for large-scale MVA studies: while a Monte Carlo simulation across the design space is difficult with physics-based codes, it becomes trivial when evaluating surrogate models, which often take the form of response-surface equations.\nTypes of analysis.\nMany different models are used in MVA, each with its own type of analysis:\nDealing with incomplete data.\nIt is very common that in an experimentally acquired set of data the values of some components of a given data point are missing. Rather than discarding the whole data point, it is common to \"fill in\" values for the missing components, a process called \"imputation\".\nImportant probability distributions.\nThere is a set of probability distributions used in multivariate analyses that play a similar role to the corresponding set of distributions that are used in univariate analysis when the normal distribution is appropriate to a dataset. These multivariate distributions are:\n*Multivariate normal distribution\n*Wishart distribution\n*Multivariate Student-t distribution.\nThe Inverse-Wishart distribution is important in Bayesian inference, for example in Bayesian multivariate linear regression. Additionally, Hotelling's T-squared distribution is a multivariate distribution, generalising Student's t-distribution, that is used in multivariate hypothesis testing.\nHistory.\nC.R. Rao made significant contributions to multivariate statistical theory throughout his career, particularly in the mid-20th century. One of his key works is the book titled \"Advanced Statistical Methods in Biometric Research,\" published in 1952. This work laid the foundation for many concepts in multivariate statistics.\nAnderson's 1958 textbook,\" An Introduction to Multivariate Statistical Analysis\", educated a generation of theorists and applied statisticians; Anderson's book emphasizes hypothesis testing via likelihood ratio tests and the properties of power functions: admissibility, unbiasedness and monotonicity.\nMVA was formerly discussed solely in the context of statistical theories, due to the size and complexity of underlying datasets and its high computational consumption. With the dramatic growth of computational power, MVA now plays an increasingly important role in data analysis and has wide application in Omics fields.\nSoftware and tools.\nThere are an enormous number of software packages and other tools for multivariate analysis, including:"}

Money laundering is illegal; the acts generating the money almost always are themselves criminal in some way (for if not, the money would not need to be laundered). As financial crime has become more complex and financial intelligence is more important in combating international crime and terrorism, money laundering has become a prominent political, economic, and legal debate. Most countries implement some anti-money-laundering measures.\nIn the past, the term \"money laundering\" was applied only to financial transactions related to organized crime. Today its definition is often expanded by government and international regulators such as the US Office of the Comptroller of the Currency to mean \"any financial transaction which generates an asset or a value as the result of an illegal act,\" which may involve actions such as tax evasion or false accounting. In the UK, it does not need to involve money, but any economic good. Courts involve money laundering committed by private individuals, drug dealers, businesses, corrupt officials, members of criminal organizations such as the Mafia, and even states.\nIn United States law, money laundering is the practice of engaging in financial transactions to conceal the identity, source, or destination of illegally gained money. In United Kingdom law, the common law definition is wider. The act is defined as \"the process by which the proceeds of crime are converted into assets which appear to have a legitimate origin, so that they can be retained permanently or recycled into further criminal enterprises\".\nHistory.\nWhile existing laws were used to fight money laundering during the period of Prohibition in the United States during the 1930s, dedicated Anti-Money Laundering legislation was only implemented in the 1980s. Organized crime received a major boost from Prohibition and a large source of new funds that were obtained from illegal sales of alcohol. The successful prosecution of Al Capone on tax evasion brought in a new emphasis by the state and law enforcement agencies to track and confiscate money, but existing laws against tax evasion could not be used once gangsters started paying their taxes.\nIn the 1980s, the war on drugs led governments again to turn to money laundering rules in an attempt to track and seize the proceeds of drug crimes in order to catch the organizers and individuals running drug empires. It also had the benefit, from a law enforcement point of view, of turning rules of evidence \"upside down\". Law enforcers normally have to prove an individual is guilty to seize their property, but with civil forfeiture laws, money can be confiscated and it is up to the individual to prove that the source of funds is legitimate to get the money back. This makes it much easier for law enforcement agencies and provides for much lower burdens of proof.\nHowever, this process has been abused by some law enforcement agencies to take and keep money without strong evidence of related criminal activity, to be used to supplement their own budgets. Civil asset forfeiture has been harshly criticized by civil liberties advocates for its greatly reduced standards for conviction, reverse onus, financial conflicts of interests arising when the law enforcement agencies who decide whether or not to seize assets stand to keep those assets for themselves, and violation of separation of powers and due process.\nThe 11 September attacks in 2001, which led to the Patriot Act in the U.S. and similar legislation worldwide, led to a new emphasis on money laundering laws to combat terrorism financing. The Group of Seven (G7) nations used the Financial Action Task Force on Money Laundering to put pressure on governments around the world to increase surveillance and monitoring of financial transactions and share this information between countries. Starting in 2002, governments around the world upgraded money laundering laws and surveillance and monitoring systems of financial transactions. Anti-money laundering regulations have become a much larger burden for financial institutions and enforcement has stepped up significantly.\nDuring 2011\u20132015 a number of major banks faced ever-increasing fines for breaches of money laundering regulations. This included HSBC, which was fined $1.9 billion in December 2012, and BNP Paribas, which was fined $8.9 billion in July 2014 by the U.S. government. Many countries introduced or strengthened border controls on the amount of cash that can be carried and introduced central transaction reporting systems where all financial institutions have to report all financial transactions electronically. For example, in 2006, Australia set up the AUSTRAC system and required the reporting of all financial transactions.\nWith the surge in digital asset in the late 2010s, there has been a noticeable rise in money laundering and fraud tied to cryptocurrency. In 2021 alone, cybercriminals managed to secure US$14 billion in cryptocurrency through various illicit activities. It has been suggested that the expansion of the cryptocurrency trading created new avenues for \"secrecy-seeking capital\" from the 2010s onward, when money laundering and tax evasion through tax haven jurisdictions became more difficult, following various international policy initiatives for example within the OECD and the European Union.\nChinese organized criminal groups have become the principal money launderers for drug cartels in Mexico, Italy, and elsewhere. In the U.S., Chinese money laundering networks drove over US$312 billion in illicit money from 2021 to 2024, according to the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network.\nThe East and Southeast Asia regions have become areas of major concern for money laundering. The United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime noted in a 2019 transnational organized crime assessment that threats arising from organized crime in Southeast Asia were becoming more deeply integrated within the region itself, as well as with neighboring and connected regions. As the region's illicit economies expanded and evolved, including the growth of the synthetic drug industry, casinos and economic zones in the region's border areas became important hubs for money laundering. Sites such as the Golden Triangle Special Economic Zone in Laos have been identified as hotspots for money laundering and various other types of transnational crime.\nOther high risk sectors for money laundering include commercial banks, securities companies, currency exchange shops, money transfer service providers, insurance companies, real estate agencies, and the trade in valuable materials such as art, antiquities and wildlife products. As these industries have grown, the presence and sophistication of money laundering operations has too, creating a backdoor for organized crime to launder illicit funds into the global financial system.\nCasino junkets operating from Macao emerged as a major facilitator of money laundering, as has the more recently established online gambling industry. The rise of the cyber-enabled fraud industry across Southeast Asia, especially in Cambodia, Myanmar, Laos, and the Philippines, has given rise to new platforms providing guarantees and facilitating the laundering of funds through app-based channels. One such case is that of Huione, a Cambodia-based operation that blockchain analysis firms have identified as one of the leading actors in this space. Blockchain analytics firm Elliptic described Huione as the \"largest illicit online marketplace to have ever operated\". Global law enforcement has begun to respond to the threats posed by such platforms, and in May 2025 the U.S. Department of the Treasury's Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) issued a finding and notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) pursuant to Section 311 of the USA PATRIOT Act that identified Huione Group as a financial institution of primary money laundering concern, seeking to sever its access to the U.S. financial system.\nFeatures.\nDefinition.\nMoney laundering is the conversion or transfer of property; the concealment or disguising of the nature of the proceeds; the acquisition, possession or use of property, knowing that these are derived from criminal acts; the participating in or assisting the movement of funds to make the proceeds appear legitimate.\nMoney obtained from certain crimes, such as extortion, insider trading, drug trafficking, human trafficking, and illegal gambling is \"dirty\" and needs to be \"cleaned\" to appear to have been derived from legal activities, so that banks and other financial institutions will deal with it without suspicion. Money can be laundered by many methods that vary in complexity and sophistication.\nMoney laundering typically involves three steps: The first involves introducing cash into the financial system by some means (\"placement\"); the second involves carrying out complex financial transactions to camouflage the illegal source of the cash (\"layering\"); and finally, acquiring wealth generated from the transactions of the illicit funds (\"integration\"). Some of these steps may be omitted, depending on the circumstances. For example, non-cash proceeds that are already in the financial system would not need to be placed.\nAccording to the United States Treasury Department:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Money laundering is the process of making illegally-gained proceeds (i.e., \"dirty money\") appear legal (i.e., \"clean\"). Typically, it involves three steps: placement, layering, and integration. First, the illegitimate funds are furtively introduced into the legitimate financial system. Then, the money is moved around to create confusion, sometimes by wiring or transferring through numerous accounts. Finally, it is integrated into the financial system through additional transactions until the \"dirty money\" appears \"clean\".\nMethods.\nList of methods.\nMoney laundering can take several forms, although most methodologies can be categorized into one of a few types. These include \"bank methods, smurfing [also known as structuring], currency exchanges, and double-invoicing\".\nDigital electronic money.\nIn theory, electronic money should provide as easy a method of transferring value without revealing identity as untracked banknotes, especially wire transfers involving anonymity-protecting numbered bank accounts. In practice, however, the record-keeping capabilities of Internet service providers and other network resource maintainers tend to frustrate that intention. While some cryptocurrencies under recent development have aimed to provide more possibilities of transaction anonymity for various reasons, the degree to which they succeed \u2014 and, in consequence, the degree to which they offer benefits for money laundering efforts \u2014 is controversial. Solutions such as ZCash and Monero \u2015 known as \"privacy coins\" \u2015 are examples of cryptocurrencies that provide unlinkable anonymity via proofs and/or obfuscation of information (ring signatures). While not suitable for large-scale crimes, privacy coins like Monero are suitable for laundering money made through small-scale crimes.\nApart from traditional cryptocurrencies, Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) are also commonly used in connection with money laundering activities. NFTs are often used to perform Wash Trading by creating several different wallets for one individual, generating several fictitious sales and consequently selling the respective NFT to a third party. According to a report by Chainalysis, these types of wash trades are becoming increasingly popular among money launderers especially due to the largely anonymous nature of transactions on NFT marketplaces. Auction platforms for NFT sales may face regulatory pressure to comply with anti-money laundering legislation.\nAdditionally, cryptocurrency mixers have been increasingly used by cybercriminals over the past decade to launder funds. A mixer blends the cryptocurrencies of many users together to obfuscate the origins and owners of funds, enabling a greater degree of privacy on public blockchains like Bitcoin and Ethereum. Although not explicitly illegal in many jurisdictions, the legality of mixers is controversial. The use of the mixer Tornado Cash in the laundering of funds stolen by the DPRK-associated Lazarus Group led the Office of Foreign Assets Control to sanction it, prompting some users to sue the Treasury Department. Proponents have argued mixers allow users to protect their privacy and that the government lacks the authority to restrict access to decentralized software. In the United States, FinCEN requires mixers to register as money service businesses.\nIn 2013, Jean-Loup Richet, a research fellow at ESSEC ISIS, surveyed new techniques that cybercriminals were using in a report written for the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime. A common approach was to use a digital currency exchanger service which converted dollars into a digital currency called Liberty Reserve, and could be sent and received anonymously. The receiver could convert the Liberty Reserve currency back into cash for a small fee. In May 2013, the US authorities shut down Liberty Reserve, charging its founder and various others with money laundering.\nAnother increasingly common way of laundering money is to use online gaming. In a growing number of online games, such as \"Second Life\" and \"World of Warcraft,\" it is possible to convert money into virtual goods, services, or virtual cash that can later be converted back into money.\nTo avoid the usage of decentralized digital money such as Bitcoin for the profit of crime and corruption, Australia is planning to strengthen the nation's anti-money laundering laws. The characteristics of Bitcoin\u2014it is completely deterministic, protocol-based and can be difficult to censor\u2014make it possible to circumvent national laws using services like Tor to obfuscate transaction origins. Bitcoin relies completely on cryptography, not on a central entity running under a KYC framework. There are several cases in which criminals have cashed out a significant amount of Bitcoin after ransomware attacks, drug dealings, cyber fraud and gunrunning. However, many digital currency exchanges are now operating KYC programs under threat of regulation from the jurisdictions they operate.\nReverse money laundering.\nReverse money laundering is a process that disguises a legitimate source of funds that are to be used for illegal purposes. It is usually perpetrated for the purpose of financing terrorism but can be also used by criminal organizations that have invested in legal businesses and would like to withdraw legitimate funds from official circulation. Unaccounted cash received via disguising financial transactions is not included in official financial reporting and could be used to evade taxes, hand in bribes and pay \"under-the-table\" salaries. For example, in an affidavit filed on 24 March 2014 in United States District Court, Northern California, San Francisco Division, FBI special agent Emmanuel V. Pascua alleged that several people associated with the Chee Kung Tong organization, and California State Senator Leland Yee, engaged in reverse money laundering activities.\nThe problem of such fraudulent encashment practices (\"obnalichka\" in Russian) has become acute in Russia and other countries of the former Soviet Union. The Eurasian Group on Combating Money Laundering and Financing of Terrorism (EAG) reported that the Russian Federation, Ukraine, Turkey, Serbia, Kyrgyzstan, Uzbekistan, Armenia and Kazakhstan have encountered a substantial shrinkage of tax base and shifting money supply balance in favor of cash. These processes have complicated the planning and management of the economy and contributed to the growth of the shadow economy.\nMagnitude.\nMany regulatory and governmental authorities issue estimates each year for the amount of money laundered, either worldwide or within their national economy. In 1996, a spokesperson for the IMF estimated that 2\u20135% of the worldwide global economy involved laundered money. The Financial Action Task Force on Money Laundering (FATF), an intergovernmental body set up to combat money laundering, stated, \"Due to the illegal nature of the transactions, precise statistics are not available and it is therefore impossible to produce a definitive estimate of the amount of money that is globally laundered every year. The FATF therefore does not publish any figures in this regard.\" Academic commentators have likewise been unable to estimate the volume of money with any degree of assurance. Various estimates of the scale of global money laundering are sometimes repeated often enough to make some people regard them as factual\u2014but no researcher has overcome the inherent difficulty of measuring an actively concealed practice.\nRegardless of the difficulty in measurement, the amount of money laundered each year is in the billions of US dollars and poses a significant policy concern for governments. As a result, governments and international bodies have undertaken efforts to deter, prevent, and apprehend money launderers. Financial institutions have likewise undertaken efforts to prevent and detect transactions involving dirty money, both as a result of government requirements and to avoid the reputational risk involved. Issues relating to money laundering have existed as long as there have been large-scale criminal enterprises. Modern anti-money laundering laws have developed along with the modern war on drugs. In more recent times anti-money laundering legislation is seen as an adjunct to the financial crime of terrorist financing in that both crimes usually involve the transmission of funds through the financial system (although money laundering relates to where the money has come \"from\", and terrorist financing relating to where the money is going \"to\"). Finally, people, vessels, organisations and governments can be sanctioned due to international law-breaking, war (and of course tit-for-tat sanctions), and still want to move funds into markets where they are \"persona non grata\".\nTransaction laundering is a massive and growing problem. Finextra estimated that transaction laundering accounted for over $200 billion in the US in 2017 alone, with over $6 billion of these sales involving illicit goods or services, sold by nearly 335,000 unregistered merchants. Money laundering can erode democracy.\nStatistics.\nBelow table shows the annual reported money laundering cases per 100,000 population for individual countries for the last available year according to the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime. Proportion of unreported money laundering and definition of money laundering might differ between countries.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"template:sticky header/styles.css\"/&gt;&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Table alignment/tables.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "19391", "revid": "20483999", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19391", "title": "Midwifery", "text": "Pregnancy and childbirth-related profession\nMidwifery is the health science and health profession that deals with pregnancy, childbirth, and the postpartum period (including care of the newborn), in addition to the sexual and reproductive health of women throughout their lives. In many countries, midwifery is a medical profession (special for its independent and direct specialized education; should not be confused with the medical specialty, which depends on a previous general training). A professional in midwifery is known as a midwife.\nA 2015 Cochrane review concluded that \"most women should be offered midwifery-led continuity models of care and women should be encouraged to ask for this option although caution should be exercised in applying this advice to women with substantial medical or obstetric complications.\" The review found that midwifery-led care was associated with a reduction in the use of epidurals, with fewer episiotomies or instrumental births, and a decreased risk of losing the baby before 24 weeks' gestation. However, midwifery-led care was also associated with a longer mean length of labor as measured in hours.\nMain areas of midwifery.\nPregnancy.\nFirst trimester.\nTrimester means \"three months\". A normal pregnancy lasts about nine months and has three trimesters.\nFirst trimester screening varies by country. Women are typically offered urinalysis (UA) and blood tests including a complete blood count (CBC), blood typing (including Rh screen), syphilis, hepatitis, HIV, and rubella testing. Additionally, women may have chlamydia testing via a urine sample, and women considered at high risk are screened for sickle cell disease and thalassemia. Women must consent to all tests before they are carried out. The woman's blood pressure, height and weight are measured. Her past pregnancies and family, social, and medical history are discussed. Women may have an ultrasound scan during the first trimester which may be used to help find the estimated due date. Some women may have genetic testing, such as screening for Down syndrome. Diet, exercise, and common disorders of pregnancy such as morning sickness are discussed.\nSecond trimester.\nThe mother visits the midwife monthly or more often during the second trimester. The mother's partner and/or the birth companion may accompany her. The midwife will discuss pregnancy issues such as fatigue, heartburn, varicose veins, and other common problems such as back pain. Blood pressure and weight are monitored and the midwife measures the mother's abdomen to see if the baby is growing as expected. Lab tests such as a UA, CBC, and glucose tolerance test are done if clinically indicated.\nThird trimester.\nIn the third trimester the midwife will see the mother every two weeks until week 36 and every week after that. Weight, blood pressure, and abdominal measurements will continue to be done. Lab tests such as a CBC and UA may be done with additional testing done for at-risk pregnancies. The midwife palpates the woman's abdomen to establish the lie, presentation and position of the fetus and later, the engagement. A pelvic exam may be done to see if the mother's cervix is dilating. The midwife and the mother discuss birthing options and write a birth care plan.\nChildbirth.\nLabor and delivery.\nMidwives are qualified to assist with a normal vaginal delivery while more complicated deliveries are handled by a health care provider who has had further training. Childbirth is divided into four stages.\nFirst stage of labor The first stage of labour involves the opening of the cervix. In the early parts of this stage the cervix will become soft and thin thus preparing for the delivery of the baby. The first stage of labour is complete when the cervix has dilated the full 10cm. During the first stage of labor the mother begins to feel strong and regular contractions that come every 5 to 20 minutes and last 30 to 60 seconds. Contractions gradually become stronger, more frequent, and longer lasting.\nSecond stage of labor During the second stage the baby begins to move down the birth canal. As the baby moves to the opening of the vagina it \"crowns\", meaning the top of the head can be seen at the vaginal entrance. At one time an \"episiotomy\", (an incision in the tissue at the opening of the vagina) was done routinely because it was believed that it prevented excessive tearing and healed more readily than a natural tear. However, more recent research shows that a surgical incision may be more extensive than a natural tear, and is more likely to contribute to later incontinence and pain during sex than a natural tear would have.\nThe midwife assists the baby as needed and when fully emerged, cuts the umbilical cord. If desired, either of the baby's parents may cut the cord. In the past the cord was cut shortly after birth, but there is growing evidence that delayed cord clamping may benefit the infant.\nThird stage of labor The third stage of labour is where the mother must deliver the placenta. In order for the mother to do this they may need to push. Just like the contractions in the first stage of labour they may experience one or two of these. The midwife may assist the mother in delivering the placenta by gently pulling on the umbilical cord.\nFourth stage of labor The fourth stage of labor is the period beginning immediately after the birth and extending for about six weeks. The World Health Organization describes this period as the most critical and yet the most neglected phase in the lives of mothers and babies. Until recently babies were routinely removed from their mothers following birth, however beginning around 2000, some authorities began to suggest that early skin-to-skin contact (placing the naked baby on the mother's chest) is of benefit to both mother and infant. As of 2014, early skin-to-skin contact is endorsed by all major organizations that are responsible for the well-being of infants. Thus, to help establish bonding and successful breastfeeding, the midwife carries out immediate mother and infant assessments as the infant lies on the mother's chest and removes the infant for further observations only after they have had their first breastfeed.\nFollowing the birth, if the mother had an episiotomy or a tearing of the perineum, it is sutured. The midwife does regular assessments for uterine contraction, fundal height, and vaginal bleeding. Throughout labor and delivery the mother's vital signs (temperature, blood pressure, and pulse) are closely monitored and her fluid intake and output are measured. The midwife also monitors the baby's pulse rate, palpates the mother's abdomen to monitor the baby's position, and does vaginal examinations as indicated. If the birth deviates from the norm at any stage, the midwife requests assistance from the multi-disciplinary team.\nBirthing positions.\nUntil the last century most women have used both the upright position and alternative positions to give birth. The lithotomy position was not used until the advent of forceps in the seventeenth century and since then childbirth has progressively moved from a woman supported experience in the home to a medical intervention within the hospital.\nThere are significant advantages to assuming an upright position in labor and birth, such as stronger and more efficient uterine contractions aiding cervical dilatation, increased pelvic inlet and outlet diameters and improved uterine contractility. Upright positions in the second stage include sitting, squatting, kneeling, and being on hands and knees.\nPostpartum period.\nFor women who have a hospital birth, the minimum hospital stay is six hours. Women who leave before this do so against medical advice. Women may choose when to leave the hospital. Full postnatal assessments are conducted daily whilst inpatient, or more frequently if needed. A postnatal assessment includes the woman's observations, general well-being, breasts (either a discussion and assistance with breastfeeding or a discussion about lactation suppression), abdominal palpation (if she has not had a caesarean section) to check for involution of the uterus, or a check of her caesarean wound (the dressing does not need to be removed for this), a check of her perineum, particularly if she tore or had stitches, reviewing her lochia, ensuring she has passed urine and had her bowels open and checking for signs and symptoms of a DVT. The baby is also checked for jaundice, signs of adequate feeding, or other concerns. The baby has a nursery exam between six and seventy two hours of birth to check for conditions such as heart defects, hip problems, or eye problems.\nIn the community, the community midwife sees the woman at least until day ten. This does not mean she sees the woman and baby daily, but she cannot discharge them from her care until day ten at the earliest. Postnatal checks include neonatal screening test (NST, or heel prick test) around day five. The baby is weighed and the midwife plans visits according to the health and needs of mother and baby. They are discharged to the care of the health visitor.\nCare of the newborn.\nAt birth, the baby receives an Apgar score, at the least, one minute and five minutes of age. This is a score out of 10 that assesses the baby on five different areas\u2014each worth between 0 and 2 points. These areas are: colour, respiratory effort, tone, heart rate, and response to stimuli. The midwife checks the baby for any obvious problems, weighs the baby, and measure head circumference. The midwife ensures the cord has been clamped securely and the baby has the appropriate name tags on (if in hospital). Babies lengths are not routinely measured. The midwife performs these checks as close to the mother as possible and returns the baby to the mother quickly. Skin-to-skin is encouraged, as this regulates the baby's heart rate, breathing, oxygen saturation, and temperature\u2014and promotes bonding and breastfeeding.\nIn some countries, such as Chile, the midwife is the professional who can direct neonatal intensive care units. This is an advantage for these professionals, who can use the knowledge of perinatology to bring a high quality care of the newborn, with medical or surgical conditions.\nMidwifery-led continuity of care.\nMidwifery-led continuity of care is where one or more midwives have the primary responsibility for the continuity of care for childbearing women, with a multidisciplinary network of consultation and referral with other health care providers. This is different from \"medical-led care\" where an obstetrician or family physician is primarily responsible. In \"shared-care\" models, responsibility may be shared between a midwife, an obstetrician and/or a family physician. The midwife is part of very intimate situations with the mother. For this reason, many say that the most important thing to look for in a midwife is comfort with them, as one will go to them with every question or problem.\nAccording to a Cochrane review of public health systems in Australia, Canada, Ireland, New Zealand and the United Kingdom, \"most women should be offered midwifery-led continuity models of care and women should be encouraged to ask for this option although caution should be exercised in applying this advice to women with substantial medical or obstetric complications.\" Midwifery-led care has effects including the following:\nThere was no difference in the number of Caesarean sections. All trials in the Cochrane review included licensed midwives, and none included lay or traditional midwives. Also, no trial included out of hospital birth.\nCompared to women in other care models, women in continuity models of midwifery care are more satisfied with their care. The updated version of the also shows a cost-saving effect in continuity models, compared to other midwifery models of care.\nIn continuity models of midwifery care, the midwife-woman relationship is developing over time. The deepened relationship has shown to be of great importance and is in a https:// described as \"the vehicle through which personalised care, trust and empowerment are achieved in the continuity of care midwifery model\".\nIn some cultures, midwifery is the most traditional way of carrying out a pregnancy and childbirth, and it has been conducted for multiple generations. Child birthing women in these cultures, take Zimbabwe for example, feel that health facilities are not as comforting as cultural roots of care. Also, according to the World Health Organization, women should be able to have their children where ever they feel the most safe, so if having a midwife and proceeding with an at-home birth is what makes some women feel safe, then midwifery-led continuity of care might be the best option for them.\nHistory.\nAncient history.\nIn ancient Egypt, midwifery was a recognized female occupation, as attested by the Ebers Papyrus which dates from 1900 to 1550 BCE. Five columns of this papyrus deal with obstetrics and gynecology, especially concerning the acceleration of parturition (the action or process of giving birth to offspring) and the birth prognosis of the newborn. The Westcar papyrus, dated to 1700 BCE, includes instructions for calculating the expected date of confinement and describes different styles of birth chairs. Bas reliefs in the royal birth rooms at Luxor and other temples also attest to the heavy presence of midwifery in this culture.\nMidwifery in Greco-Roman antiquity covered a wide range of women, including old women who continued folk medical traditions in the villages of the Roman Empire, trained midwives who garnered their knowledge from a variety of sources, and highly trained women who were considered physicians. However, there were certain characteristics desired in a \"good\" midwife, as described by the physician Soranus of Ephesus in the 2nd century. He states in his work, \"Gynecology\", that \"a suitable person will be literate, with her wits about her, possessed of a good memory, loving work, respectable and generally not unduly handicapped as regards her senses [i.e., sight, smell, hearing], sound of limb, robust, and, according to some people, endowed with long slim fingers and short nails at her fingertips.\" Soranus also recommends that the midwife be of sympathetic disposition (although she need not have borne a child herself) and that she keep her hands soft for the comfort of both mother and child. Pliny, another physician from this time, valued nobility and a quiet and inconspicuous disposition in a midwife. There appears to have been three \"grades\" of midwives present: The first was technically proficient; the second may have read some of the texts on obstetrics and gynecology; but the third was highly trained and reasonably considered a medical specialist with a concentration in midwifery.\nAgnodice or Agnodike (Gr. \u1f08\u03b3\u03bd\u03bf\u03b4\u03af\u03ba\u03b7) was the earliest historical, and likely apocryphal, midwife mentioned among the ancient Greeks.\nMidwives were known by many different titles in antiquity, ranging from \"iatrin\u0113\" (Gr. nurse), \"maia\" (Gr., midwife), \"obstetrix\" (Lat., obstetrician), and \"medica\" (Lat., doctor). It appears as though midwifery was treated differently in the Eastern end of the Mediterranean basin as opposed to the West. In the East, some women advanced beyond the profession of midwife (\"maia\") to that of gynaecologist (\"iatros gynaikeios\", translated as \"women's doctor\"), for which formal training was required. Also, there were some gynecological tracts circulating in the medical and educated circles of the East that were written by women with Greek names, although these women were few in number. Based on these facts, it would appear that midwifery in the East was a respectable profession in which respectable women could earn their livelihoods and enough esteem to publish works read and cited by male physicians. In fact, a number of Roman legal provisions strongly suggest that midwives enjoyed status and remuneration comparable to that of male doctors. One example of such a midwife is Salpe of Lemnos, who wrote on women's diseases and was mentioned several times in the works of Pliny.\nHowever, in the Roman West, information about practicing midwives comes mainly from funerary epitaphs. Two hypotheses are suggested by looking at a small sample of these epitaphs. The first is the midwifery was not a profession to which freeborn women of families that had enjoyed free status of several generations were attracted; therefore it seems that most midwives were of servile origin. Second, since most of these funeral epitaphs describe the women as freed, it can be proposed that midwives were generally valued enough, and earned enough income, to be able to gain their freedom. It is not known from these epitaphs how certain slave women were selected for training as midwives. Slave girls may have been apprenticed, and it is most likely that mothers taught their daughters.\nThe actual duties of the midwife in antiquity consisted mainly of assisting in the birthing process, although they may also have helped with other medical problems relating to women when needed. Often, the midwife would call for the assistance of a physician when a more difficult birth was anticipated. In many cases the midwife brought along two or three assistants. In antiquity, it was believed by both midwives and physicians that a normal delivery was made easier when a woman sat upright. Therefore, during parturition, midwives brought a stool to the home where the delivery was to take place. In the seat of the birthstool was a crescent-shaped hole through which the baby would be delivered. The birthstool or chair often had armrests for the mother to grasp during the delivery. Most birthstools or chairs had backs which the patient could press against, but Soranus suggests that in some cases the chairs were backless and an assistant would stand behind the mother to support her. The midwife sat facing the mother, encouraging and supporting her through the birth, perhaps offering instruction on breathing and pushing, sometimes massaging her vaginal opening, and supporting her perineum during the delivery of the baby. The assistants may have helped by pushing downwards on the top of the mother's abdomen.\nFinally, the midwife received the infant, placed it in pieces of cloth, cut the umbilical cord, and cleansed the baby. The child was sprinkled with \"fine and powdery salt, or natron or aphronitre\" to soak up the birth residue, rinsed, and then powdered and rinsed again. Next, the midwives cleared away any and all mucus present from the nose, mouth, ears, or anus. Midwives were encouraged by Soranus to put olive oil in the baby's eyes to cleanse away any birth residue, and to place a piece of wool soaked in olive oil over the umbilical cord. After the delivery, the midwife made the initial call on whether or not an infant was healthy and fit to rear. She inspected the newborn for congenital deformities and testing its cry to hear whether or not it was robust and hearty. Ultimately, midwives made a determination about the chances for an infant's survival and likely recommended that a newborn with any severe deformities be exposed.\nA 2nd-century terracotta relief from the Ostian tomb of Scribonia Attice, wife of physician-surgeon M. Ulpius Amerimnus, details a childbirth scene. Scribonia was a midwife and the relief shows her in the midst of a delivery. A patient sits in the birth chair, gripping the handles and the midwife's assistant stands behind her providing support. Scribonia sits on a low stool in front of the woman, modestly looking away while also assisting the delivery by dilating and massaging the vagina, as encouraged by Soranus.\nThe services of a midwife were not inexpensive; this fact that suggests poorer women who could not afford the services of a professional midwife often had to make do with female relatives. Many wealthier families had their own midwives. However, the vast majority of women in the Greco-Roman world very likely received their maternity care from hired midwives. They may have been highly trained or possessed only a rudimentary knowledge of obstetrics. Also, many families had a choice of whether or not they wanted to employ a midwife who practiced the traditional folk medicine or the newer methods of professional parturition. Like a lot of other factors in antiquity, quality gynecological care often depended heavily on the socioeconomic status of the patient.\nEarly Modern history.\nMidwives were usually older, married or widowed women with their own grown children. However, this was not an absolute, but a commonly recognized pattern. Many midwives were teenagers or unmarried. Throughout the seventeenth century, the literacy of English midwives was quite high, usually surpassing the clientele base they served. By 1634, most English midwives in London could read, which is important since many of them may not have been able to write, only leaving a simple mark as their signature. By the 1660s, country midwives also had high literacy rates which was remarkable considering female literacy was very low during this period.\nModern history.\nFrom the 18th century, a conflict between surgeons and midwives arose, as medical men began to assert that their modern scientific techniques were better for mothers and infants than the folk medicine practiced by midwives.\nAs doctors and medical associations pushed for a legal monopoly on obstetrical care, midwifery became outlawed or heavily regulated throughout the United States and Canada. In Northern Europe and Russia, the situation for midwives was a little easier - in the Duchy of Estonia in Imperial Russia, Professor Christian Friedrich Deutsch established a midwifery school for women at the Imperial University of Dorpat in 1811, which existed until World War I. It was the predecessor for the Tartu Health Care College. Training lasted for 7 months and in the end a certificate for practice was issued to the female students. Despite accusations that midwives were \"incompetent and ignorant\", some argued that poorly trained surgeons were far more of a danger to pregnant women. In 1846, the physician Ignaz Semmelweiss observed that more women died in maternity wards staffed by male surgeons than by female midwives, and traced these outbreaks of puerperal fever back to (then all-male) medical students not washing their hands properly after dissecting cadavers, but his sanitary recommendations were ignored until acceptance of germ theory became widespread.\nThe argument that surgeons were more dangerous than midwives lasted until the study of bacteriology became popular in the early 1900s and hospital hygiene was improved. Women began to feel safer in the setting of the hospitals with the amount of aid and the ease of birth that they experienced with doctors. \"Physicians trained in the new century found a great contrast between their hospital and obstetrics practice in women's homes where they could not maintain sterile conditions or have trained help.\" German social scientists Gunnar Heinsohn and Otto Steiger theorize that midwifery became a target of persecution and repression by public authorities because midwives possessed highly specialized knowledge and skills regarding not only assisting birth, but also contraception and abortion.\nContemporary.\nAt late 20th century, midwives were already recognized as highly trained and specialized professionals in obstetrics. However, at the beginning of the 21st century, the medical perception of pregnancy and childbirth as potentially pathological and dangerous still dominates Western culture. Midwives who work in hospital settings also have been influenced by this view, although by and large they are trained to view birth as a normal and healthy process. While midwives play a much larger role in the care of pregnant mothers in Europe than in America, the medicalized model of birth still has influence in those countries, even though the World Health Organization recommends a natural, normal and humanized birth.\nThe midwifery model of pregnancy and childbirth as a normal and healthy process plays a much larger role in Sweden and the Netherlands than the rest of Europe, however. Swedish midwives stand out, since they administer 80 percent of prenatal care and more than 80 percent of family planning services in Sweden. Midwives in Sweden attend all normal births in public hospitals and Swedish women tend to have fewer interventions in hospitals than American women. The Dutch infant mortality rate is one of the lowest rate in the world, at 4.0 deaths per thousand births, while the United States ranked twenty-second. Midwives in the Netherlands and Sweden owe a great deal of their success to supportive government policies.\nReferences.\nNotes\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography"}

{"id": "19444", "revid": "50755956", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19444", "title": "Miguel de Cervantes", "text": "Spanish writer (1547\u20131616)\nMiguel de Cervantes Saavedra ( ; ; 29 September 1547 (assumed) \u2013 22 April 1616) was a Spanish writer widely regarded as the greatest writer in the Spanish language and one of the world's pre-eminent novelists. He is best known for his two-part novel \"Don Quixote\", a work considered to be the first modern novel. \"Don Quixote\" has been labelled by many well-known authors as the \"best book of all time\" and the \"best and most central work in world literature\".\nMuch of his life was spent in relative poverty and obscurity, which led to many of his early works being lost. Despite this, his influence and literary contribution are reflected by the fact that Spanish is often referred to as \"the language of Cervantes\".\nIn 1569, Cervantes was forced to leave Spain and move to Rome, where he worked in the household of a cardinal. In 1570, he enlisted in a Spanish Navy infantry regiment, and was badly wounded at the Battle of Lepanto in October 1571 and lost the use of his left arm and hand. He served as a soldier until 1575, when he was captured by Barbary pirates; after five years in captivity, he was ransomed, and returned to Madrid.\nHis first significant novel, titled \"La Galatea\", was published in 1585, but he continued to work as a purchasing agent, and later as a government tax collector. Part One of \"Don Quixote\" was published in 1605, and Part Two in 1615. Other works include the 12 \"Novelas ejemplares\" (\"Exemplary Novels\"); a long poem, the \"Viaje del Parnaso\" (\"Journey to Parnassus\"); and \"Ocho comedias y ocho entremeses\" (\"Eight Plays and Eight Interludes\"). The novel \"Los trabajos de Persiles y Sigismunda\" (\"The Travails of Persiles and Sigismunda\"), was published posthumously in 1617.\nThe cave of Medrano (also known as the casa de Medrano) in Argamasilla de Alba, which has been known since the beginning of the 17th century, and according to the tradition of Argamasilla de Alba, was the prison of Cervantes and the place where he conceived and began to write \"Don Quixote\".\nBiography.\nDespite his subsequent renown, many details of Cervantes' life remain uncertain, including his name, background, and physical appearance. He signed his name as \"Cerbantes\", but his printers used \"Cervantes\", which became the common form. In later life, Cervantes used \"Saavedra\", the name of a distant relative, rather than the more usual \"Cortinas\", after his mother. Historian Luce L\u00f3pez-Baralt has suggested that \"Saavedra\" comes from the Arabic dialect word \"shaibedraa\", meaning \"one-handed\", a reference to his nickname during his captivity. Further linguistic and historical evidence for this claim, however, remains debated.\nAnother area of dispute is his religious background. It has been suggested that not only Cervantes' father but also his mother may have been New Christians. Anthony Cascardi writes, \"While the family might have had some claim to nobility they often found themselves in financial straits. Moreover, they may have been of converso origin, that is, converts to Catholicism of Jewish ancestry. In the Spain of Cervantes' days, this meant living under clouds of official suspicion and social mistrust, with far more limited opportunities than were enjoyed by members of the 'Old Christian' caste.\" According to Charles D. Presberg, however, there is no wide following for the view that Cervantes had converso origins. Cuban writer Roberto Gonz\u00e1lez Echevarr\u00eda argues that the claims of Cervantes' converso origins are based on \"very flimsy evidence\", namely Cervantes' lack of social and financial progression which was not unusual for Spaniards of his time, regardless of their ancestry as many didn't receive these rewards during this period.\nIt is generally accepted Miguel de Cervantes was born around 29 September 1547, in Alcal\u00e1 de Henares. He was the second son of barber-surgeon Rodrigo de Cervantes and his wife, Leonor de Cortinas (c.\u20091520\u20131593). Rodrigo came from C\u00f3rdoba, Andalusia, where his father Juan de Cervantes was an influential lawyer.\n1547 to 1566: Early years.\nRodrigo was frequently in debt, or searching for work, and moved constantly. Leonor came from Arganda del Rey, and died in October 1593, at the age of 73; surviving legal documents indicate she had seven children, could read and write, and was a resourceful individual with a keen eye for business. When Rodrigo was imprisoned for debt from October 1553 to April 1554, she supported the family on her own.\nIn his \"Novelas ejemplares\", Cervantes claims to be a stutterer. Some authors believe it to be a figure of speech to describe himself as endowed with little verbal eloquence. Others, conversely, take it as a true speech impediment, citing similar commentaries made by Cervantes in three more of his writings aside from \"Novelas\".\nCervantes' siblings were Andr\u00e9s (born 1543), Andrea (born 1544), Luisa (born 1546), Rodrigo (born 1550), Magdalena (born 1554) and Juan. They lived in C\u00f3rdoba until 1556, when his grandfather died. For reasons that are unclear, Rodrigo did not benefit from his will and the family disappears until 1564 when he filed a lawsuit in Seville.\nSeville was then in the midst of an economic boom, and Rodrigo managed rented accommodation for his elder brother Andres, who was a junior magistrate. It is contended that Cervantes attended the Jesuit college in Seville, where one of the teachers was Jesuit playwright Pedro Pablo Acevedo, who moved there in 1561 from C\u00f3rdoba. However, legal records show his father got into debt once more and in 1566 the family moved to Madrid.\n1566 to 1580: Military service and captivity.\nIn the 19th century, a biographer discovered an arrest warrant for a Miguel de Cervantes, dated 15 September 1569, who was charged with wounding Antonio de Sigura in a duel. Although disputed at the time, largely on the grounds such behaviour was unworthy of so great an author, it is now accepted as the most likely reason for Cervantes leaving Madrid.\nCervantes eventually made his way to Rome, where he found a position in the household of Giulio Acquaviva, an Italian bishop who spent 1568 to 1569 in Madrid, and was appointed Cardinal in 1570. When the 1570 to 1573 Ottoman\u2013Venetian War began, Spain formed part of the Holy League, a coalition formed to support the Venetian Republic. Possibly seeing an opportunity to have his arrest warrant rescinded, Cervantes went to Naples, then part of the Crown of Aragon. The military commander in Naples was \u00c1lvaro de Sande, a friend of the family, who gave him a commission in the Tercio of Sicily under the Marqu\u00e9s de Santa Cruz. At some point, he was joined in Naples by his younger brother Rodrigo. \nIn September 1571, Cervantes sailed on board the \"Marquesa\", part of the Holy League fleet under Don John of Austria, illegitimate half brother of Phillip II of Spain; on 7 October, they defeated the Ottoman fleet at the Battle of Lepanto. This landmark sea battle, the most significant naval conflict since the Roman Battle of Actium in 32 B.C., stopped Muslim incursion into Europe, and for the first time allowed European Christians to feel that they were not going to be overrun by Islam.\nAccording to his own account, although suffering from malaria, Cervantes was given command of a 12-man skiff, a small boat used for assaulting enemy galleys. The \"Marquesa\" lost 40 dead, and 120 wounded, including Cervantes, who received three separate wounds, two in the chest, and another that rendered his left arm useless. This last wound is the reason why he later was called \"El manco de Lepanto\" (English: \"The one-handed man of Lepanto\", \"The one-armed man of Lepanto\"), a title that followed him for the rest of his life. His actions at Lepanto were a source of pride to the end of his life, while Don John approved no less than four separate pay increases for him.\nIn \"Journey to Parnassus\", published two years before his death in 1616, Cervantes claimed to have \"lost the movement of the left hand for the glory of the right\". As with much else, the extent of his disability is unclear, the only source being Cervantes himself, while commentators cite his habitual tendency to praise himself. However, they were serious enough to earn him six months in the Civic Hospital at Messina, Sicily.\nAlthough he returned to service in July 1572 in the \"Tercio de Figueroa\", records show his chest wounds were still not completely healed in February 1573. Based mainly in Naples, he joined expeditions to Corfu and Navarino, and took part in the 1573 occupation of Tunis and La Goulette, which were recaptured by the Ottomans in 1574. Despite Lepanto, the war overall was an Ottoman victory, and the loss of Tunis a military disaster for Spain. Cervantes returned to Palermo, where he was paid off by the Duke of Sessa, who gave him letters of commendation.\nIn early September 1575, Cervantes and Rodrigo left Naples on the galley \"Sol\"; as they approached Barcelona on 26 September, their ship was captured by Ottoman corsairs, and the brothers taken to Algiers, to be sold as slaves, or \u2013 as was the case of Cervantes and his brother \u2013 held for ransom, if this would be more lucrative than their sale as slaves. Rodrigo was ransomed in 1577, but his family could not afford the fee for Cervantes, who was forced to remain. Turkish historian Rasih Nuri \u0130leri found evidence suggesting Cervantes worked on the construction of the K\u0131l\u0131\u00e7 Ali Pasha Complex, which would mean he spent at least part of his captivity in Istanbul. This is yet to be proven and no evidence has been published on the matter.\nBy 1580, Spain was occupied with integrating Portugal, and suppressing the Dutch Revolt, while the Ottomans were at war with Persia; the two sides agreed a truce, leading to an improvement of relations. After almost five years, and four escape attempts, in 1580 Cervantes was set free by the Trinitarians, a religious charity that specialised in ransoming Christian captives, and returned to Madrid.\n1580 to 1616: Later life and death.\nWhile Cervantes was in captivity, both Don John and the Duke of Sessa died, depriving him of two potential patrons, while the Spanish economy was in dire straits. This made finding employment difficult; other than a period in 1581 to 1582, when he was employed as an intelligence agent in North Africa, little is known of his movements prior to 1584.\nIn April of that year, Cervantes visited Esquivias, to help arrange the affairs of his recently deceased friend and minor poet, Pedro La\u00ednez. There he met Catalina de Salazar y Palacios (c.\u20091566 \u2013 1626), eldest daughter of the widowed Catalina de Palacios; her husband died leaving only debts, but the elder Catalina owned some land of her own. This may be why in December 1584, Cervantes married her daughter, then between 15 and 18 years old. The first use of the name \"Cervantes Saavedra\" appears in 1586, on documents related to their marriage.\nShortly before this, his illegitimate daughter Isabel was born in November. Her mother, Ana Franca, was the wife of a Madrid innkeeper; they apparently concealed it from her husband, but Cervantes acknowledged paternity. When Ana Franca died in 1598, he asked his sister Magdalena to take care of his daughter.\nIn 1587, Cervantes was appointed as a government purchasing agent, \"Commissary of the Royal Galleons\" in Seville, obtaining wheat and oil for the doomed Spanish Armada. He became a tax collector in 1592 and was briefly jailed for 'irregularities' in his accounts, but quickly released. Several applications for positions in Spanish America were rejected i.e. to the Council of Indies in 1590, though modern critics note images of the colonies appear in his work.\nFrom 1596 to 1600, he lived primarily in Seville, then returned to Madrid in 1606, where he remained for the rest of his life. In later years, he received some financial support from the Count of Lemos, although he was not included in the retinue Lemos took to Naples when appointed Viceroy in 1608. In July 1613, he joined the Third Order Franciscans, then a common way for Catholics to gain spiritual merit. \nIt is generally accepted Cervantes died on 22 April 1616 (NS; the Gregorian calendar had superseded the Julian in 1582 in Spain and some other countries). The date of 23 April 1616 was long considered his death date, but is now understood to be his date of burial. 23 April, which is also the death date of William Shakespeare (also in 1616, but not on the same day, as England then used the Julian calendar), is now celebrated as World Book Day.\nThe symptoms described leading to his death, including intense thirst, correspond to diabetes, then untreatable.\nIn accordance with his will, Cervantes was buried in the Convent of the Barefoot Trinitarians, in central Madrid. His remains went missing when moved during rebuilding work at the convent in 1673, and in 2014, historian Fernando de Prado launched a project to rediscover them.\nIn January 2015, Francisco Etxeberria, the forensic anthropologist leading the search, reported the discovery of caskets containing bone fragments, and part of a board, with the letters 'M.C.'. Based on evidence of injuries suffered at Lepanto, on 17 March 2015 they were confirmed as belonging to Cervantes along with his wife and others. They were formally reburied at a public ceremony in June 2015.\nSupposed likenesses.\nNo authenticated portrait of Cervantes is known to exist. The one most often associated with the author is attributed to Juan de J\u00e1uregui, but both names were added at a later date. The El Greco painting in the , known as \"Retrato de un caballero desconocido\" (\"Portrait of an Unknown Gentleman\"), is cited as 'possibly' depicting Cervantes, but there is no evidence for this. It has been suggested that the portrait \"The Nobleman with his Hand on his Chest\", also by El Greco, may possibly depict Cervantes. \nHowever, The Prado itself, while mentioning, in passing, that \"specific names have been proposed for the sitter, including that of Cervantes\", and even \"that the painting could be a self-portrait [of El Greco]\", goes on to state that \"Without doubt, the most convincing suggestion has connected this figure with the Second Marquis of Montemayor, Juan de Silva y de Ribera, a contemporary of El Greco who was appointed military commander of the Alc\u00e1zar in Toledo by Philip II and Chief Notary to the Crown, a position that would explain the solemn gesture of the hand, depicted in the act of taking an oath.\"\nThe portrait by Luis de Madrazo, at the , painted in 1859, was based on his imagination. The image that appears on Spanish euro coins of \u20ac0.10, \u20ac0.20 and \u20ac0.50 is based on a bust, created in 1905.\nIn 2025, the European Central Bank announced that Cervantes had been selected to appear on the observe of fifty euro banknotes in a future redesign, were the theme \"European culture\" to be selected over \"Rivers and birds\".\nLiterary career and legacy.\nCervantes claimed to have written over 20 plays, such as \"El trato de Argel\", based on his experiences in captivity. Such works were extremely short-lived, and even Lope de Vega, the best-known playwright of the day, could not live on their proceeds. In 1585, he published \"La Galatea\", a conventional pastoral romance that received little contemporary notice; despite promising to write a sequel, he never did so.\nAside from these, and some poems, by 1605, Cervantes had not been published for 20 years. In \"Don Quixote\", he challenged a form of literature that had been a favourite for more than a century, explicitly stating his purpose was to undermine 'vain and empty' chivalric romances. His portrayal of real life, and use of everyday speech in a literary context was considered innovative, and proved instantly popular. First published in January 1605, Don Quixote and Sancho Panza featured in masquerades held to celebrate the birth of Philip IV on 8 April.\nHe finally achieved a degree of financial security, while its popularity led to demands for a sequel. In the foreword to his 1613 work, \"Novelas ejemplares\", dedicated to his patron, the Count of Lemos, Cervantes promises to produce one, but was pre-empted by an unauthorised version published in 1614, published under the name Alonso Fern\u00e1ndez de Avellaneda. It is possible this delay was deliberate, to ensure support from his publisher and reading public; Cervantes finally produced the second part of \"Don Quixote\" in 1615.\nThe two parts of \"Don Quixote\" are different in focus, but similar in their clarity of prose and their realism. The first was more comic, and had greater popular appeal. The second part is often considered more sophisticated and complex, with a greater depth of characterisation and philosophical insight.\nIn addition to this, he produced a series of works between 1613 and his death in 1616. They include a collection of tales titled \"Exemplary Novels\". This was followed by \"Viaje del Parnaso\", \"Eight Comedies and Eight New Interludes\", and \"Los trabajos de Persiles y Sigismunda\", completed just before his death, and published posthumously in January 1617.\nCervantes also possessed a unique writing style, often blending elements of comedic themes to more complex adult-oriented undertones, best displayed by Don Quixote. \n\"In the space of a few pages, what started as an exercise in comic ridicule and, as the narrator insists on several occasions, a satirical send-up of the tales of chivalry, has taken on an entirely different dimension; it has begun to transform itself into the story of a relationship between two characters whose incompatible takes on the world are bridged by friendship, loyalty, and eventually love.\"\nCervantes was rediscovered by English writers in the mid-18th century. The literary editor John Bowle argued that Cervantes was as significant as any of the Greek and Roman authors then popular, and published an annotated edition in 1781. Now viewed as a significant work, at the time it proved a failure. However, \"Don Quixote\" has been translated into all major languages, in 700 editions. Mexican author Carlos Fuentes suggested that Cervantes and his contemporary William Shakespeare form part of a narrative tradition that includes Homer, Dante, Defoe, Dickens, Balzac, and Joyce.\nSigmund Freud claimed he learnt Spanish to read Cervantes in the original; he particularly admired \"The Dialogue of the Dogs\" (\"El coloquio de los perros\"), from \"Exemplary Tales\", in which two dogs, Cipi\u00f3n and Berganza, share their stories; as one talks, the other listens, occasionally making comments. From 1871 to 1881, Freud and his close friend Eduard Silberstein wrote letters to each other, using the pen names Cipi\u00f3n and Berganza.\nIn 1905, the tricentennial of the publication of \"Don Quixote\" was marked with celebrations in Spain; the 400th anniversary of his death, in 2016, saw the production of \"Cervantina\", a celebration of his plays by the Compa\u00f1\u00eda Nacional de Teatro Cl\u00e1sico in Madrid. \"Man of La Mancha\", the 1965 musical, was loosely based on Cervantes' life. The Miguel de Cervantes Virtual Library is the world's largest digital archive of Spanish-language historical and literary works.\n\"The Cervantes Society of America\" was founded in 1978 and held its first membership meeting in San Francisco in December, 1979. The organization aims to further studies of Cervantes' works and his influence in our society.\nWorks.\nAs listed in \"Complete Works of Miguel de Cervantes\":\nOther works.\nCervantes is generally considered a mediocre poet; few of his poems survive. Some appear in \"La Galatea\", while he also wrote \"Dos Canciones \u00e0 la Armada Invencible\".\nHis sonnets include \"Al T\u00famulo del Rey Felipe en Sevilla\", \"Canto de Cal\u00edope\" and \"Ep\u00edstola a Mateo V\u00e1zquez\". \"Viaje del Parnaso\", or \"Journey to Parnassus\", is his most ambitious verse work, an allegory that consists largely of reviews of contemporary poets.\nHe published a number of dramatic works, including ten extant full-length plays:\nHe also wrote eight short farces (\"entremeses\"):\nThese plays and short farces, except for \"Trato de Argel\" and \"La Numancia\", made up \"Ocho Comedias y ocho entrem\u00e9ses nuevos, nunca representados\" (\"Eight Comedies and Eight New Interludes, Never Before Performed\"), which appeared in 1615. The dates and order of composition of Cervantes's short farces are unknown. Faithful to the spirit of Lope de Rueda, Cervantes endowed them with novelistic elements, such as simplified plot, the type of descriptions normally associated with a novel, and character development. Cervantes included some of his dramas among the works he was most satisfied with.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt; "}

Originally from C\u00f3rdoba, where he was born on Passover Eve of 1135 or 1138, his family was exiled from Muslim-ruled Spain when they refused to convert to Islam shortly after the Almohad Caliphate conquered the Almoravid Caliphate in 1148. Over the course of the next two decades, Maimonides resided in Fez, Acre, Jerusalem, Alexandria, and Cairo before finally settling in Fustat between 1168 and 1171. During this period, he advanced his vocations and became renowned for his achievements as an astronomer, philosopher, and physician\u2014even being appointed to serve as personal physician to Saladin of the Ayyubid Sultanate. \nMost contemporary Jews as far as Iraq and Yemen greeted Maimonides' writings on \"halakha\" and Jewish ethics with acclaim and gratitude. Yet, while he rose to lead the Jewish community in Egypt, he also had vociferous critics, particularly in Spain. He continued to live in Fustat until his death in 1204 and is said to have been buried in Tiberias. Accordingly, the Tomb of Maimonides in Tiberias holds importance as a Jewish pilgrimage site.\nTo date, Maimonides is recognized as one of the foremost rabbinic decisors and his copious work comprises a cornerstone of Jewish scholarship. His fourteen-volume still carries significant canonical authority in Judaism as a codification of \"halakha\", as do his thirteen principles of faith. Maimonides' era is considered by many to mark the end of the Jewish Golden Age in Spain, owing to the ubiquitous persecution of his family and the Sephardic Jewish community in general, though others assert that it lasted until the Christian \"Reconquista\" concluded in the 15th century.\nAside from being revered by Jewish historians, Maimonides features very prominently in the history of Islamic science. Influenced by Aristotle, al-Farabi, ibn Sina, and his contemporary ibn Rushd, his work as a polymath contributed to the Islamic Golden Age and was regarded highly in many parts of the Muslim world.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:TOC limit/styles.css\" /&gt;\nName.\nMaimonides' Arabic name was \"Ab\u016b \u02bfImr\u0101n M\u016bs\u0101 bin Maim\u016bn bin \u02bfUbaydall\u0101h al-Qur\u1e6dub\u012b\", \"Moses 'son of Amram\" son of Maymun, of Obadiah, the Cordoban\", or more often simply \"Moses, son of Maymun\" (). and \"Moses, son of rabbi Maymun the Iberian\". In Medieval Hebrew, he was usually called \"Ram\", short for \"our Rabbi Moshe\", but mostly he is called \"Rambam\", short for \"our Rabbi, Moshe son of Maimon\".\nIn Greek, the Hebrew ('son of') becomes the patronymic suffix \"-ides\", forming \u039c\u03c9\u03b7\u03c3\u03ae\u03c2 \u039c\u03b1\u03ca\u03bc\u03bf\u03bd\u03af\u03b4\u03b7\u03c2 \"Moses Maimonides\".\nHe is sometimes known as \"The Great Eagle\" ().\nBiography.\nEarly life.\nMaimonides was born 1138 (or 1135) in C\u00f3rdoba in the Muslim-ruled Almoravid Caliphate, at the end of the Golden Age of Jewish culture in Spain after the first centuries of Muslim rule. His father, Maimon ben Joseph, was a dayyan or rabbinic judge.\nMaimonides studied Torah under his father, who had in turn studied under Joseph ibn Migash, a student of Isaac Alfasi. At an early age, Maimonides developed an interest in contemporary science and philosophy. He read ancient Greek philosophy accessible via Arabic translations and was deeply immersed in the sciences and learning of Islamic culture.\nExile from Spain.\nA Berber dynasty, the Almohads, conquered C\u00f3rdoba in 1148 and abolished dhimmi status (i.e., state protection of non-Muslims ensured through payment of the jizya tax) in some territories. The loss of this status forced Jewish and Christian communities to choose between conversion to Islam, martyrdom, or exile. Many Jews were forced to convert, but due to suspicion by the authorities of fake conversions, the new converts had to wear identifying clothing that set them apart and made them subject to public scrutiny.\nMaimonides' family, along with many other Jews, chose exile. For the next ten years, Maimonides moved about in southern Spain and North Africa, eventually settling in Fas. Some say that his teacher in Fez was Yehuda Ha-Cohen Ibn Susan, until the latter was killed in 1165.\nDuring this time, he composed his acclaimed commentary on the \"Mishnah\" during 1166\u20131168.\nSettlement in Egypt.\nFollowing this sojourn in Morocco, he lived in Acre with his father and brother, before settling in Fustat in Fatimid Caliphate-controlled Egypt by 1168. There is mention that Maimonides first settled in Alexandria, and moved to Fustat only in 1171. While in Cairo, he studied in a yeshiva attached to a small synagogue, which now bears his name. In Jerusalem, he prayed at the Temple Mount. He wrote that this day of visiting the Temple Mount was a day of holiness for him and his descendants.\nMaimonides was soon instrumental in helping rescue Jews taken captive during the Christian Amalric of Jerusalem's siege of the southeastern Nile Delta town of Bilbeis. He sent five letters to the Jewish communities of Lower Egypt asking them to pool money together to pay the ransom. The money was collected and then given to two judges sent to Palestine to negotiate with the Crusaders. The captives were eventually released.\nDeath of his brother David.\nFollowing this success, the Maimonides family, hoping to increase their wealth, gave their savings to his brother, the youngest son David ben Maimon, a merchant. Maimonides directed his brother to procure goods only at the port of \u02bfAydhab along the Red Sea. After a long, arduous trip through the desert, however, David was unimpressed by the goods on offer there. Against his brother's wishes, David boarded a ship for India, since great wealth was to be found in the East. Before he could reach his destination, David drowned at sea sometime between 1169 and 1177. The death of his brother caused Maimonides to become sick with grief.\nIn a letter discovered in the Cairo Geniza, he wrote:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The greatest misfortune that has befallen me during my entire life\u2014worse than anything else\u2014was the demise of the saint, may his memory be blessed, who drowned in the Indian sea, carrying much money belonging to me, to him, and to others, and left with me a little daughter and a widow. On the day I received that terrible news I fell ill and remained in bed for about a year, suffering from a sore boil, fever, and depression, and was almost given up. About eight years have passed, but I am still mourning and unable to accept consolation. And how should I console myself? He grew up on my knees, he was my brother, [and] he was my student.\nLeadership of Egypt's Jewish community.\nAround 1171, Maimonides was appointed the nagid of the Egyptian Jewish community. Shelomo Dov Goitein believes the leadership he displayed during the ransoming of the Crusader captives led to this appointment. However, he was replaced by Sar Shalom ben Moses in 1173. Over the controversial course of Sar Shalom's appointment, during which Sar Shalom was accused of tax farming, Maimonides excommunicated and fought with him for several years until Maimonides was appointed Nagid in 1195. Abraham bar Hillel wrote a scathing description of Sar Shalom in his \"Megillat Zutta\" while praising Maimonides as \"the light of east and west and unique master and marvel of the generation.\"\nPhysician for the Ayyubid dynasty.\nWith the loss of the family funds tied up in David's business venture, Maimonides assumed the vocation of physician, for which he was to become famous. He had trained in medicine in both Spain and in Fez. Gaining widespread recognition, he was appointed court physician to Qadi al-Fadil, the chief secretary to Sultan Saladin, then to Saladin himself; after whose death he remained a physician to the Ayyubid dynasty.\nIn his medical writings, Maimonides described many conditions, including asthma, diabetes, hepatitis, and pneumonia, and he emphasized moderation and a healthy lifestyle. His treatises became influential for generations of physicians. He was knowledgeable about Greek and Arabic medicine, and followed the principles of humorism in the tradition of Galen. He did not blindly accept authority but used his own observation and experience. Julia Bess Frank indicates that Maimonides in his medical writings sought to interpret works of authorities so that they could become acceptable. Maimonides displayed in his interactions with patients attributes that today would be called intercultural awareness and respect for the patient's autonomy. Although he frequently wrote of his longing for solitude in order to come closer to God and to extend his reflections\u2014elements considered essential in his philosophy to the prophetic experience\u2014he gave over most of his time to caring for others. In a famous letter, Maimonides describes his daily routine. After visiting the Sultan's palace, he would arrive home exhausted and hungry, where \"I would find the antechambers filled with gentiles and Jews [...] I would go to heal them, and write prescriptions for their illnesses [...] until the evening [...] and I would be extremely weak.\"\nAs he goes on to say in this letter, even on Shabbat he would receive members of the community. Still, he managed to write extended treatises, including not only medical and other scientific studies but some of the most systematically thought-through and influential treatises on halakha (rabbinic law) and Jewish philosophy of the Middle Ages.\nIn 1172\u201374, Maimonides wrote his famous \"Epistle to Yemen\". It has been suggested that his \"incessant travail\" undermined his own health and brought about his death at 69 (although this is a normal lifespan).\nDeath and burial place.\nMaimonides died on 12 December 1204 (20th of Tevet 4965) in Fustat. A variety of medieval sources beginning with al-Qifti maintain that his body was interred near the Sea of Galilee, though there is no contemporary evidence for his removal from Egypt. Gedaliah ibn Yahya ben Joseph records that \"He was buried in the Upper Galilee with elegies upon his gravestone. In the time of Kimhi, when the sons of Belial rose up to besmirch [Maimonides] . . . they did evil. They altered his gravestone, which previously had been inscribed 'choicest of the human race (\u05de\u05d1\u05d7\u05e8 \u05d4\u05de\u05d9\u05df \u05d4\u05d0\u05e0\u05d5\u05e9\u05d9)', so that instead it read 'the excommunicated heretic ()'. But later, after the provocateurs had repented of their act, and praised this great man, a student repaired the gravestone to read 'choicest of the Israelites ()'\". Today, Tiberias hosts the Tomb of Maimonides, on which is inscribed \"From Moses to Moses arose none like Moses.\"\nHe is buried in Tomb of Maimonides in Tiberias. Other notable rabbis also buried in this complex are Isaiah Horowitz, Eliezer ben Hurcanus, Yohanan ben Zakkai, and Joshua ben Hananiah.\nAncestry and descendants.\nMaimonides is sometimes said to be a descendant of David, although he never made such a claim.\nAaron ben Jacob ha-Kohen later wrote that he had traced Maimonides' descent back to Simeon ben Judah ha-Nasi from the Davidic line. His ancestry, going back four generations, is given in his \"Epistle to Yemen\" as Moses ben Maimon ben Joseph ben Isaac ben Obadiah. At the end of his commentary on the Mishnah, however, a longer, slightly different genealogy is given: Moses ben Maimon ben Joseph ben Isaac ben Joseph ben Obadiah ben Solomon ben Obadiah.\nMaimonides and his wife, the daughter of Mishael ben Yeshayahu Halevi, had one child who survived into adulthood, Abraham Maimonides, who became recognized as a great scholar, but his scholarship and career was overshadowed by his father's importance. He succeeded Maimonides as Nagid and as court physician at the age of eighteen. Throughout his career, he defended his father's writings against all critics, an. The office of Nagid was held by the Maimonides family for four successive generations, until the end of the 14th century.\nPhilosophical and theological commentary.\nThrough \"The Guide for the Perplexed\" and the philosophical introductions to sections of his commentaries on the Mishna, Maimonides exerted an important influence on the Scholastic philosophers, especially on Albertus Magnus, Thomas Aquinas and Duns Scotus. He was a Jewish Scholastic. Educated more by reading the works of Arab Muslim philosophers than by personal contact with Arabian teachers, he acquired an intimate acquaintance not only with Arab Muslim philosophy, but with the doctrines of Aristotle. Maimonides strove to reconcile Aristotelianism and science with the teachings of the Torah. In his \"Guide for the Perplexed\", he often explains the function and purpose of the statutory provisions contained in the Torah against the backdrop of the historical conditions. The book was highly controversial in its day, and was banned by French rabbis, who burnt copies of the work in Montpellier.\nThirteen principles of faith in Judaism.\nIn his commentary on the Mishnah (Tractate Sanhedrin, chapter 10), Maimonides formulates his \"13 principles of faith\"; and that these principles summarized what he viewed as the required beliefs of Judaism:\nMaimonides is said to have compiled the principles from various Talmudic sources. These principles were controversial when first proposed, evoking criticism by Rabbis Hasdai Crescas and Joseph Albo, and were effectively ignored by much of the Jewish community for the next few centuries. However, these principles have become widely held and are considered to be the cardinal principles of faith for Orthodox Jews. Two poetic restatements of these principles ( and ) eventually became canonized in many editions of the Siddur (Jewish prayer book).\nThe omission of a list of these principles as such within his later works, the and \"The Guide for the Perplexed\", has led some to suggest that either he retracted his earlier position, or that these principles are descriptive rather than prescriptive.\nNature of the God of Abraham.\nMaimonides equated the God of Abraham to what philosophers refer to as the Necessary Being. God is unique in the universe, and the Torah commands that one love and fear God (Deut 10:12) on account of that uniqueness. To Maimonides, this meant that one ought to contemplate God's works and to marvel at the order and wisdom that went into their creation. When one does this, one inevitably comes to love God and to sense how insignificant one is in comparison to God. This is the basis of the Torah.\nThe principle that inspired his philosophical activity was identical to a fundamental tenet of scholasticism: there can be no contradiction between the truths which God has revealed and the findings of the human mind in science and philosophy. Maimonides primarily relied upon the science of Aristotle and the teachings of the Talmud, commonly claiming to find a basis for the latter in the former.\nMaimonides' admiration for the Neoplatonic commentators led him to doctrines which the later Scholastics did not accept. For instance, Maimonides was an adherent of apophatic theology. In this theology, one attempts to describe God through negative attributes. For example, one should not say that God exists in the usual sense of the term; it can be said that God is not non-existent. One should not say that \"God is wise\"; but it can be said that \"God is not ignorant,\" i.e., in some way, God has some properties of knowledge. One should not say that \"God is One,\" but it can be stated that \"there is no multiplicity in God's being.\" In brief, the attempt is to gain and express knowledge of God by describing what God is not, rather than by describing what God \"is.\"\nMaimonides argued adamantly that God is not corporeal. This was central to his thinking about the sin of idolatry. Maimonides insisted that all of the anthropomorphic phrases pertaining to God in sacred texts are to be interpreted metaphorically. A related tenet of Maimonidean theology is the notion that the commandments, especially those pertaining to sacrifices, are intended to help wean the Israelites away from idolatry.\nMaimonides also argued that God embodied reason, intellect, science, and nature, and was omnipotent and indescribable. He said that science, the growth of scientific fields, and discovery of the unknown by comprehension of nature was a way to appreciate God.\nMorality in character development.\nMaimonides taught about the developing of one's moral character. Although his life predated the modern concept of a personality, Maimonides believed that each person has an innate disposition along an ethical and emotional spectrum. Although one's disposition is often determined by factors outside of one's control, human beings have free will to choose to behave in ways that build character. He wrote, \"One is obligated to conduct his affairs with others in a gentle and pleasing manner.\" Maimonides advised that those with antisocial character traits should identify those traits and then make a conscious effort to behave in the opposite way. For example, an arrogant person should practice humility. If the circumstances of one's environment are such that it is impossible to behave ethically, one must move to a new location.\nThe \"prophetic\" state.\nMaimonides agreed with \"the Philosopher\" (Aristotle) that the use of logic is the \"right\" way of thinking. He claimed that in order to understand how to know God, every human being must, by study, and meditation attain the degree of perfection required to reach the prophetic state. Despite his rationalistic approach, he does not explicitly reject the previous ideas (as portrayed, for example, by Yehuda Halevi in his ) that in order to become a prophet, God must intervene. Maimonides teaches that prophecy is the highest purpose of the most learned and refined individuals.\nProblem of evil in spite of God's presence.\nMaimonides wrote on theodicy (the philosophical attempt to reconcile the existence of a God with the existence of evil). He took the premise that an omnipotent and good God exists. In \"The Guide for the Perplexed\", Maimonides writes that all the evil that exists within human beings stems from their individual attributes, while all good comes from a universally shared humanity (Guide 3:8). He says that there are people who are guided by higher purpose, and there are those who are guided by physicality and must strive to find the higher purpose with which to guide their actions.\nTo justify the existence of evil, assuming God is both omnipotent and omnibenevolent, Maimonides postulates that one who created something by causing its opposite not to exist is not the same as creating something that exists; so evil is merely the absence of good. God did not create evil, rather God created good, and evil exists where good is absent (Guide 3:10). Therefore, all good is divine invention, and evil both is not and comes secondarily.\nMaimonides contests the common view that evil outweighs good in the world. He says that if one were to examine existence only in terms of humanity, then that person may observe evil to dominate good, but if one looks at the whole of the universe, then he sees good is significantly more common than evil (Guide 3:12). Man, he reasons, is too insignificant a figure in God's myriad works to be their primary characterizing force, and so when people see mostly evil in their lives, they are not taking into account the extent of positive Creation outside of themselves.\nMaimonides believes that there are three types of evil in the world: evil caused by nature, evil that people bring upon others, and evil man brings upon himself (Guide 3:12). The first type of evil Maimonides states is the rarest form, but arguably of the most necessary\u2014the balance of life and death in both the human and animal worlds itself, he recognizes, is essential to God's plan. Maimonides writes that the second type of evil is relatively rare, and that humanity brings it upon itself. The third type of evil humans bring upon themselves and is the source of most of the ills of the world. These are the result of people's falling victim to their physical desires. To prevent the majority of evil which stems from harm one does to oneself, one must learn how to respond to one's bodily urges.\nSkepticism of astrology.\nMaimonides answered an inquiry concerning astrology, addressed to him from Marseille. He responded that man should believe only what can be supported either by rational proof, by the evidence of the senses, or by trustworthy authority. He affirms that he had studied astrology, and that it does not deserve to be described as a science. He ridicules the concept that the fate of a man could be dependent upon the constellations; he argues that such a theory would rob life of purpose, and would make man a slave of destiny.\nUnlike some of his contemporaries, Maimonides did not believe that Greek knowledge had originated with the Jews originally, but he does believe that the sages and Solomon knew science and philosophy, however he does not believe those books have survived down to his time. He notes that rabbinical knowledge of mathematics was imperfect because it was learned from contemporary men of science, and not divinely inspired prophecy.\nTrue beliefs versus necessary beliefs.\nIn \"The Guide for the Perplexed\" Book III, Chapter 28, Maimonides draws a distinction between \"true beliefs,\" which were beliefs about God that produced intellectual perfection, and \"necessary beliefs,\" which were conducive to improving social order. Maimonides places anthropomorphic personification statements about God in the latter class. He uses as an example the notion that God becomes \"angry\" with people who do wrong. In the view of Maimonides (taken from Avicenna), God does not become angry with people, as God has no human passions; but it is important for them to believe God does, so that they desist from doing wrong.\nHierarchy of righteousness (\"tzedakah\").\nMaimonides conceived of an eight-level hierarchy of tzedakah, where the highest form is to give a gift, loan, or partnership that will result in the recipient becoming self-sufficient instead of living upon others. In his view, the lowest form of \"tzedakah\" is to give begrudgingly. The eight levels are:\nBiblical eschatology and events.\nThe Messianic era.\nPerhaps one of Maimonides' most highly acclaimed and renowned writings is his treatise on the Messianic era, written originally in Judeo-Arabic and which he elaborates on in great detail in his Commentary on the Mishnah (Introduction to the 10th chapter of tractate Sanhedrin, also known as ).\nResurrection of the Dead.\nReligious Jews believed in immortality in a spiritual sense, and most believed that the future would include a messianic era and a resurrection of the dead. This is the subject of Jewish eschatology. Maimonides wrote much on this topic, but in most cases he wrote about the immortality of the soul for people of perfected intellect; his writings were usually not about the resurrection of dead bodies. Rabbis of his day were critical of this aspect of this thought, and there was controversy over his true views.\nEventually, Maimonides felt pressured to write a treatise on the subject, known as \"The Treatise on Resurrection.\" In it, he wrote that those who claimed that he believed the verses of the Hebrew Bible referring to the resurrection were only allegorical were spreading falsehoods. Maimonides asserts that belief in resurrection is a fundamental truth of Judaism about which there is no disagreement.\nWhile his position on the World to Come (non-corporeal eternal life as described above) may be seen as being in contradiction with his position on bodily resurrection, Maimonides resolved them with a then unique solution: Maimonides believed that the resurrection was not permanent or general. In his view, God never violates the laws of nature. Rather, divine interaction is by way of angels, whom Maimonides often regards to be metaphors for the laws of nature, the principles by which the physical universe operates, or Platonic eternal forms. Thus, if a unique event actually occurs, even if it is perceived as a miracle, it is not a violation of the world's order.\nIn this view, any dead who are resurrected must eventually die again. In his discussion of the 13 principles of faith, the first five deal with knowledge of God, the next four deal with prophecy and the Torah, while the last four deal with reward, punishment and the ultimate redemption. In this discussion Maimonides says nothing of a universal resurrection. All he says it is that whatever resurrection does take place, it will occur at an indeterminate time before the world to come, which he repeatedly states will be purely spiritual.\nThe World to Come.\nMaimonides distinguishes two kinds of intelligence in man, the one material in the sense of being dependent on, and influenced by, the body, and the other immaterial, that is, independent of the bodily organism. The latter is a direct emanation from the universal active intellect; this is his interpretation of the of Aristotelian philosophy. It is acquired as the result of the efforts of the soul to attain a correct knowledge of the absolute, pure intelligence of God.\nThe knowledge of God is a form of knowledge which develops in us the immaterial intelligence, and thus confers on man an immaterial, spiritual nature. This confers on the soul that perfection in which human happiness consists, and endows the soul with immortality. One who has attained a correct knowledge of God has reached a condition of existence, which renders him immune from all the accidents of fortune, from all the allurements of sin, and from death itself. Man is in a position to work out his own salvation and his immortality.\nBaruch Spinoza's doctrine of immortality was strikingly similar. However, Spinoza teaches that the way to attain the knowledge which confers immortality is the progress from sense-knowledge through scientific knowledge to philosophical intuition of all things , while Maimonides holds that the road to perfection and immortality is the path of duty as described in the Torah and the rabbinic understanding of the oral law.\nMaimonides describes the world to come as the stage after a person lives their life in this world as well as the final state of existence after the Messianic Era. Some time after the resurrection of the dead, souls will live forever without bodies. They will enjoy the radiance of the Divine Presence without the need for food, drink or sexual pleasures.\nViews on contemporary Kabbalah.\nMaimonides was not known as a supporter of Kabbalah, although a strong intellectual type of mysticism has been discerned in his philosophy. In \"The Guide for the Perplexed\", Maimonides declares his intention to conceal from the average reader his explanations of esoteric meanings of Torah. The nature of these \"secrets\" is debated. Religious Jewish rationalists, and the mainstream academic view, read Maimonides' Aristotelianism as a mutually-exclusive alternative metaphysics to Kabbalah. Some academics hold that Maimonides' project fought against the Proto-Kabbalah of his time.\nMaimonides employed rationalism to defend Judaism rather than limit inquiry of only to rationalism. His rationalism, if not taken as an opposition, also assisted the Kabbalists, purifying their transmitted teaching from mistaken corporeal interpretations that could have been made from Hekhalot literature, though Kabbalists held that their theosophy alone allowed human access to Divine mysteries.\nPublished works.\nMaimonides, who was revered for his personality as well as for his writings, led a busy life, and wrote many of his works while travelling or in temporary accommodation. Most of his work was originally compiled in Arabic, though he also wrote some of his religious tracts in Hebrew, with many of the earliest translations by other scholars existing primarily in Greek and Latin.\nOn Judaism.\n\"Mishneh Torah\".\nWith , Maimonides composed a code of Jewish law with the widest-possible scope and depth. The work gathers all the binding laws from the Talmud, and incorporates the positions of the Geonim (post-Talmudic early medieval scholars, mainly from Mesopotamia). It is also known as or simply () which has the numerical value 14, representing the 14 books of the work. The \"Mishneh Torah\" made following Jewish law easier for the Jews of his time, who were struggling to understand the complex nature of Jewish rules and regulations as they had adapted over the years.\nLater codes of halakha such as the \"Arba'ah Turim\" of Jacob ben Asher and \"Shulchan Aruch\" of Joseph Karo draw heavily on ; both often quote whole sections verbatim. However, it met initially with much opposition. There were two main reasons for this opposition. First, Maimonides had refrained from adding references to his work for the sake of brevity; second, in the introduction, he gave the impression of wanting to \"cut out\" study of the Talmud, to arrive at a conclusion in Jewish law, although Maimonides later wrote that this was not his intent. His most forceful opponents were the rabbis of Provence (Southern France), and a running critique by Abraham ben David (Raavad III) is printed in virtually all editions of . Nevertheless, Mishneh Torah was recognized as a monumental contribution to the systemized writing of halakha. Throughout the centuries, it has been widely studied and its halakhic decisions have weighed heavily in later rulings.\nIn response to those who would attempt to force followers of Maimonides and his to abide by the rulings of his own Shulchan Aruch or other later works, Joseph Karo wrote: \"Who would dare force communities who follow the Rambam to follow any other decisor [of Jewish law], early or late? [...] The Rambam is the greatest of the decisors, and all the communities of the Land of Israel and the Arabistan and the Maghreb practice according to his word, and accepted him as their rabbi.\"\nAn oft-cited legal maxim from his pen is: \"It is better and more satisfactory to acquit a thousand guilty persons than to put a single innocent one to death.\" He argued that executing a defendant on anything less than absolute certainty would lead to a slippery slope of decreasing burdens of proof, until defendants would be convicted merely according to the judge's caprice.\nRabbinic law and theology.\nMaimonides composed works of Jewish scholarship, rabbinic law, philosophy, and medical texts. Most of Maimonides' works were written in Judeo-Arabic. However, the was written in Hebrew. In addition to Mishneh Torah, his Jewish texts were:\nOn medicine.\nMaimonides' achievements in the medical field are well known, and are cited by many medieval authors. One of his more important medical works is his \"Guide to Good Health\" (), which he composed in Arabic for the Sultan al-Afdal, son of Saladin, who suffered from depression. The work was translated into Latin, and published in Florence in 1477, becoming the first medical book to appear in print there. While his prescriptions may have become obsolete, \"his ideas about preventive medicine, public hygiene, approach to the suffering patient, and the preservation of the health of the soul have not become obsolete.\" Maimonides wrote ten known medical works in Arabic that have been translated by the Jewish medical ethicist Fred Rosner into contemporary English. Lectures, conferences and research on Maimonides, even recently in the 21st century, have been done at medical universities in Morocco.\n\"Oath of Maimonides\".\nThe \"Oath of Maimonides\" is a document about the medical calling and recited as a substitute for the \"Hippocratic Oath\". It is not to be confused with a more lengthy \"Prayer of Maimonides\". These documents may not have been written by Maimonides, but later. The \"Prayer\" appeared first in print in 1793 and has been attributed to Markus Herz, a German physician, pupil of Immanuel Kant.\nOn philosophy.\n\"Treatise on Logic\".\nThe \"Treatise on Logic\" (Arabic: ) has been printed 17 times, including editions in Latin (1527), German (1805, 1822, 1833, 1828), French (1936) by Mo\u00efse Ventura and in 1996 by R\u00e9mi Brague, and English (1938) by Israel Efros, and in an abridged Hebrew form. The work illustrates the essentials of Aristotelian logic to be found in the teachings of the great Islamic philosophers such as Avicenna and, above all, Al-Farabi, \"the Second Master,\" the \"First Master\" being Aristotle. In his work devoted to the Treatise, R\u00e9mi Brague stresses the fact that Al-Farabi is the only philosopher mentioned therein. This indicates a line of conduct for the reader, who must read the text keeping in mind Al-Farabi's works on logic. In the Hebrew versions, the Treatise is called \"The words of Logic\" which describes the bulk of the work. The author explains the technical meaning of the words used by logicians. The Treatise duly inventories the terms used by the logician and indicates what they refer to. The work proceeds rationally through a lexicon of philosophical terms to a summary of higher philosophical topics, in 14 chapters corresponding to Maimonides' birthdate of 14 Nissan. The number 14 recurs in many of Maimonides' works. Each chapter offers a cluster of associated notions. The meaning of the words is explained and illustrated with examples. At the end of each chapter, the author carefully draws up the list of words studied.\nUntil very recently, it was accepted that Maimonides wrote the \"Treatise on Logic\" in his twenties or even in his teen years. Herbert Davidson has raised questions about Maimonides' authorship of this short work (and of other short works traditionally attributed to Maimonides). He maintains that Maimonides was not the author at all, based on a report of two Arabic-language manuscripts, unavailable to Western investigators in Asia Minor. Yosef Qafih maintained that it is by Maimonides and newly translated it to Hebrew (as ) from the Judeo-Arabic.\nLegacy.\nInfluence on Jewish scholarship.\nMaimonides' is considered by Jews even today as one of the chief authoritative codifications of Jewish law and ethics. It is exceptional for its logical construction, concise and clear expression and extraordinary learning, so that it became a standard against which other later codifications were often measured. It is still closely studied in rabbinic (seminaries). The first to compile a comprehensive lexicon containing an alphabetically arranged list of difficult words found in Maimonides' was Tan\u1e25um ha-Yerushalmi (1220\u20131291). A popular medieval saying that also served as his epitaph states, \"From Mosheh [of the Torah] to Mosheh [Maimonides] there was none like Mosheh.\" It chiefly referred to his rabbinic writings.\nHowever, Maimonides was also one of the most influential figures in medieval Jewish philosophy. His adaptation of Aristotelian thought to Biblical faith deeply impressed later Jewish thinkers, and had an unexpected immediate historical impact. Some more acculturated Jews in the century that followed his death, particularly in Spain, sought to apply Maimonides' Aristotelianism in ways that undercut traditionalist belief and observance, giving rise to an intellectual controversy in Spanish and southern French Jewish circles. The intensity of debate spurred Catholic Church interventions against \"heresy\" and a general confiscation of rabbinic texts.\nIn reaction, the more radical interpretations of Maimonides were defeated. At least amongst Ashkenazi Jews, there was a tendency to ignore his specifically philosophical writings and to stress instead the rabbinic and halakhic writings. These writings often included considerable philosophical chapters or discussions in support of halakhic observance; David Hartman observes that Maimonides clearly expressed \"the traditional support for a philosophical understanding of God both in the Aggadah of Talmud and in the behavior of the hasid [the pious Jew].\" Maimonidean thought continues to influence traditionally observant Jews.\nThe most rigorous medieval critique of Maimonides is Hasdai Crescas' . Crescas bucked the eclectic trend, by demolishing the certainty of the Aristotelian world-view, not only in religious matters but also in the most basic areas of medieval science (such as physics and geometry). Crescas' critique provoked a number of 15th-century scholars to write defenses of Maimonides.\nBecause of his path-finding synthesis of Aristotle and Biblical faith, Maimonides had an influence on Christian theologian Thomas Aquinas who refers to Maimonides in several of his works, including the \"Commentary on the Sentences\".\nMaimonides' combined abilities in the fields of theology, philosophy and medicine make his work attractive today as a source during discussions of evolving norms in these fields, particularly medicine. An example is the modern citation of his method of determining death of the body in the controversy regarding declaration of death to permit organ donation for transplantation.\nMaimonides remains one of the most widely debated Jewish thinkers among modern scholars. He has been adopted as a symbol and an intellectual hero by almost all major movements in modern Judaism, and has proven important to philosophers such as Leo Strauss; and his views on the importance of humility have been taken up by modern humanist philosophers.\nIn academia, particularly within the area of Jewish Studies, the teaching of Maimonides has been dominated by traditional scholars, generally Orthodox, who place a very strong emphasis on Maimonides as a rationalist; one result is that certain sides of Maimonides' thought, including his opposition to anthropocentrism, have been obviated. There are movements in some postmodern circles to claim Maimonides for other purposes, as within the discourse of ecotheology. Maimonides' reconciliation of the philosophical and the traditional has given his legacy an extremely diverse and dynamic quality.\nTributes and memorials.\nA was erected near the C\u00f3rdoba Synagogue.\nMaimonides has been memorialized in numerous ways. For example, one of the Learning Communities at the Tufts University School of Medicine bears his name. There is also Maimonides School in Brookline, Massachusetts, Maimonides Academy School in Los Angeles, California, Lyc\u00e9e Ma\u00efmonide in Casablanca, the Brauser Maimonides Academy in Hollywood, Florida, and Maimonides Medical Center in Brooklyn, New York. Beit Harambam Congregation, a Sephardi synagogue in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, is named after him.\nIssued from 8 May 1986 to 1995, the Series A of the Israeli New Shekel featured an illustration of Maimonides on the obverse and the place of his burial in Tiberias on the reverse on its 1-shekel bill.\nMaimonides is one of the heroes of the novel \"Century 21\", Normal IL, Dalkey Archive Press, 1992 by Ewa Kuryluk.\nIn 2004, conferences were held at Yale University, Florida International University, Penn State, and Rambam Hospital in Haifa, Israel, which is named after him. To commemorate the 800th anniversary of his death, Harvard University issued a memorial volume. In 1953, the Israel Postal Authority issued a postage stamp of Maimonides, pictured.\nIn March 2008, during the Euromed Conference of Ministers of Tourism, The Tourism Ministries of Israel, Morocco and Spain agreed to work together on a joint project that will trace the footsteps of the Rambam and thus boost religious tourism in the cities of C\u00f3rdoba, Fez and Tiberias.\nBetween December 2018 and January 2019 the Israel Museum held a special exhibit dedicated to the writings of Maimonides.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nExternal links.\nstyle=\"border:1px #aaa solid; width:692px; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;\""}
{"id": "19446", "revid": "19531195", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19446", "title": "Magnetic resonance imaging", "text": "Medical imaging technique\nMagnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a medical imaging technique used in radiology to generate pictures of the anatomy and the physiological processes inside the body. MRI scanners use strong magnetic fields, magnetic field gradients, and radio waves to form images of the organs in the body. MRI does not involve X-rays or the use of ionizing radiation, which distinguishes it from computed tomography (CT) and positron emission tomography (PET) scans. MRI is a medical application of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) which can also be used for imaging in other NMR applications, such as NMR spectroscopy.\nMRI is widely used in hospitals and clinics for medical diagnosis, staging and follow-up of disease. Compared to CT, MRI provides better contrast in images of soft tissues, e.g. in the brain or abdomen. However, it may be perceived as less comfortable by patients, due to the usually longer and louder measurements with the subject in a long, confining tube, although \"open\" MRI designs mostly relieve this. Additionally, implants and other non-removable metal in the body can pose a risk and may exclude some patients from undergoing an MRI examination safely.\nMRI was originally called NMRI (nuclear magnetic resonance imaging), but \"nuclear\" was dropped to avoid negative associations. Certain atomic nuclei are able to absorb radio frequency (RF) energy when placed in an external magnetic field; the resultant evolving spin polarization can induce an RF signal in a radio frequency coil and thereby be detected. In other words, the nuclear magnetic spin of protons in the hydrogen nuclei resonates with the RF incident waves and emit coherent radiation with compact direction, energy (frequency) and phase. This coherent amplified radiation is then detected by RF antennas close to the subject being examined. It is a process similar to masers. In clinical and research MRI, hydrogen atoms are most often used to generate a macroscopic polarized radiation that is detected by the antennas. Hydrogen atoms are naturally abundant in humans and other biological organisms, particularly in water and fat. For this reason, most MRI scans essentially map the location of water and fat in the body. Pulses of radio waves excite the nuclear spin energy transition, and magnetic field gradients localize the polarization in space. By varying the parameters of the pulse sequence, different contrasts may be generated between tissues based on the relaxation properties of the hydrogen atoms therein.\nSince its development in the 1970s and 1980s, MRI has proven to be a versatile imaging technique. While MRI is most prominently used in diagnostic medicine and biomedical research, it also may be used to form images of non-living objects, such as mummies. Diffusion MRI and functional MRI extend the utility of MRI to capture neuronal tracts and blood flow respectively in the nervous system, in addition to detailed spatial images. The sustained increase in demand for MRI within health systems has led to concerns about cost effectiveness and overdiagnosis.\nMechanism.\nConstruction and physics.\nIn most medical applications, hydrogen nuclei, which consist solely of a proton, that are in tissues create a signal that is processed to form an image of the body in terms of the density of those nuclei in a specific region. Given that the protons are affected by fields from other atoms to which they are bonded, it is possible to separate responses from hydrogen in specific compounds. To perform a study, the person is positioned within an MRI scanner that forms a strong magnetic field around the area to be imaged. First, energy from an oscillating magnetic field is temporarily applied to the patient at the appropriate resonance frequency. Scanning with X and Y gradient coils causes a selected region of the patient to experience the exact magnetic field required for the energy to be absorbed. The atoms are excited by a RF pulse and the resultant signal is measured by a receiving coil. The RF signal may be processed to deduce position information by looking at the changes in RF level and phase caused by varying the local magnetic field using gradient coils. As these coils are rapidly switched during the excitation and response to perform a moving line scan, they create the characteristic repetitive noise of an MRI scan as the windings move slightly due to magnetostriction. The contrast between different tissues is determined by the rate at which excited atoms return to the equilibrium state. Exogenous contrast agents may be given to the person to make the image clearer.\nThe major components of an MRI scanner are the main magnet, which polarizes the sample, the shim coils for correcting shifts in the homogeneity of the main magnetic field, the gradient system which is used to localize the region to be scanned and the RF system, which excites the sample and detects the resulting NMR signal. The whole system is controlled by one or more computers.\nMRI requires a magnetic field that is both strong and uniform to a few parts per million across the scan volume. The field strength of the magnet is measured in teslas \u2013 and while the majority of systems operate at 1.5 T, commercial systems are available between 0.2 and 7 T. 3T MRI systems, also called 3 Tesla MRIs, have stronger magnets than 1.5 systems and are considered better for images of organs and soft tissue. Whole-body MRI systems for research applications operate in e.g. 9.4T, 10.5T, 11.7T. Even higher field whole-body MRI systems e.g. 14 T and beyond are in conceptual proposal or in engineering design. Most clinical magnets are superconducting magnets, which require liquid helium to keep them at low temperatures. Lower field strengths can be achieved with permanent magnets, which are often used in \"open\" MRI scanners for claustrophobic patients. Lower field strengths are also used in a portable MRI scanner approved by the FDA in 2020. Recently, MRI has been demonstrated also at ultra-low fields, i.e., in the microtesla-to-millitesla range, where sufficient signal quality is made possible by prepolarization (on the order of 10\u2013100 mT) and by measuring the Larmor precession fields at about 100 microtesla with highly sensitive superconducting quantum interference devices (SQUIDs).\nT1 and T2.\nEach tissue returns to its equilibrium state after excitation by the independent relaxation processes of T1 (spin-lattice; that is, magnetization in the same direction as the static magnetic field) and T2 (spin-spin; transverse to the static magnetic field). To create a T1-weighted image, magnetization is allowed to recover before measuring the MR signal by changing the repetition time (TR). This image weighting is useful for assessing the cerebral cortex, identifying fatty tissue, characterizing focal liver lesions, and in general, obtaining morphological information, as well as for post-contrast imaging.\nTo create a T2-weighted image, magnetization is allowed to decay before measuring the MR signal by changing the echo time (TE). This image weighting is useful for detecting edema and inflammation, revealing white matter lesions, and assessing zonal anatomy in the prostate and uterus.\nThe information from MRI scans comes in the form of image contrasts based on differences in the rate of relaxation of nuclear spins following their perturbation by an oscillating magnetic field (in the form of radiofrequency pulses through the sample). The relaxation rates are a measure of the time it takes for a signal to decay back to an equilibrium state from either the longitudinal or transverse plane.\nMagnetization builds up along the z-axis in the presence of a magnetic field, B0, such that the magnetic dipoles in the sample will, on average, align with the z-axis summing to a total magnetization Mz. This magnetization along z is defined as the equilibrium magnetization; magnetization is defined as the sum of all magnetic dipoles in a sample. Following the equilibrium magnetization, a 90\u00b0 radiofrequency (RF) pulse flips the direction of the magnetization vector in the xy-plane, and is then switched off. The initial magnetic field B0, however, is still applied. Thus, the spin magnetization vector will slowly return from the xy-plane back to the equilibrium state. The time it takes for the magnetization vector to return to its equilibrium value, Mz, is referred to as the longitudinal relaxation time, T1. Subsequently, the rate at which this happens is simply the reciprocal of the relaxation time: formula_1. Similarly, the time in which it takes for Mxy to return to zero is T2, with the rate formula_2. Magnetization as a function of time is defined by the Bloch equations.\nT1 and T2 values are dependent on the chemical environment of the sample; hence their utility in MRI. Soft tissue and muscle tissue relax at different rates, yielding the image contrast in a typical scan.\nThe standard display of MR images is to represent fluid characteristics in black-and-white images, where different tissues turn out as follows:\nDiagnostics.\nUsage by organ or system.\nMRI has a wide range of applications in medical diagnosis and around 50,000 scanners are estimated to be in use worldwide. MRI affects diagnosis and treatment in many specialties although the effect on improved health outcomes is disputed in certain cases.\nMRI is the investigation of choice in the preoperative staging of rectal and prostate cancer and has a role in the diagnosis, staging, and follow-up of other tumors, as well as for determining areas of tissue for sampling in biobanking.\nNeuroimaging.\nMRI is the investigative tool of choice for neurological cancers over CT, as it offers better visualization of the posterior cranial fossa, containing the brainstem and the cerebellum. The contrast provided between grey and white matter makes MRI the best choice for many conditions of the central nervous system, including demyelinating diseases, dementia, cerebrovascular disease, infectious diseases, Alzheimer's disease and epilepsy. Since multiple images are taken milliseconds apart, it can show how the brain responds to different stimuli, enabling researchers to study both functional and structural brain abnormalities in psychological disorders. MRI also is used in guided stereotactic surgery and radiosurgery for treatment of intracranial tumors, arteriovenous malformations, and other surgically treatable conditions using a device known as the N-localizer. New tools that implement artificial intelligence in healthcare have demonstrated higher image quality and morphometric analysis in neuroimaging with the application of a denoising system.\nThe record for the highest spatial resolution of a whole intact brain (postmortem) is 100 microns, from Massachusetts General Hospital. The data was published in \"Nature\" in October 2019.\nThough MRI is used widely in research on mental disabilities, based on a 2024 systematic literature review and meta analysis commissioned by the Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute (PCORI), available research using MRI scans to diagnose ADHD showed great variability. The authors conclude that MRI cannot be reliably used to assist in making a clinical diagnosis of ADHD.\nCardiovascular.\nCardiac MRI is complementary to other imaging techniques, such as echocardiography, cardiac CT, and nuclear medicine. It can be used to assess the structure and the function of the heart. Its applications include assessment of myocardial ischemia and viability, cardiomyopathies, myocarditis, iron overload, vascular diseases, and congenital heart disease.\nMusculoskeletal.\nApplications in the musculoskeletal system include spinal imaging, assessment of joint disease, and soft tissue tumors. MRI techniques can also be used for diagnostic imaging of\nsystemic muscle diseases including genetic muscle diseases.\nSwallowing movements of the throat and esophagus can cause motion artifacts over the imaged spine. Therefore, a saturation pulse applied over this region can help to avoid these artifacts. Motion artifacts arising due to the pumping of the heart can be reduced by timing the MRI pulse according to heart cycles. Blood vessel flow artifacts can be reduced by applying saturation pulses above and below the region of interest.\nLiver and gastrointestinal.\nHepatobiliary MRI is used to detect and characterize lesions of the liver, pancreas, and bile ducts. Focal or diffuse disorders of the liver may be evaluated using diffusion-weighted, opposed-phase imaging and dynamic contrast enhancement sequences. Extracellular contrast agents are used widely in liver MRI, and newer hepatobiliary contrast agents also provide the opportunity to perform functional biliary imaging. Anatomical imaging of the bile ducts is achieved by using a heavily T2-weighted sequence in magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP). Functional imaging of the pancreas is performed following administration of secretin. MR enterography provides non-invasive assessment of inflammatory bowel disease and small bowel tumors. MR-colonography may play a role in the detection of large polyps in patients at increased risk of colorectal cancer.\nAngiography.\nMagnetic resonance angiography (MRA) generates pictures of the arteries to evaluate them for stenosis (abnormal narrowing) or aneurysms (vessel wall dilatations, at risk of rupture). MRA is often used to evaluate the arteries of the neck and brain, the thoracic and abdominal aorta, the renal arteries, and the legs (called a \"run-off\"). A variety of techniques can be used to generate the pictures, such as administration of a paramagnetic contrast agent (gadolinium) or using a technique known as \"flow-related enhancement\" (e.g., 2D and 3D time-of-flight sequences), where most of the signal on an image is due to blood that recently moved into that plane (see also FLASH MRI).\nTechniques involving phase accumulation (known as phase contrast angiography) can also be used to generate flow velocity maps easily and accurately. Magnetic resonance venography (MRV) is a similar procedure that is used to image veins. In this method, the tissue is now excited inferiorly, while the signal is gathered in the plane immediately superior to the excitation plane\u2014thus imaging the venous blood that recently moved from the excited plane.\nContrast agents.\nMRI for imaging anatomical structures or blood flow do not require contrast agents since the varying properties of the tissues or blood provide natural contrasts. However, for more specific types of imaging, exogenous contrast agents may be given intravenously, orally, or intra-articularly. Most contrast agents are either paramagnetic (e.g.: gadolinium, manganese, europium), and are used to shorten T1 in the tissue they accumulate in, or super-paramagnetic (SPIONs), and are used to shorten T2 and T2* in healthy tissue reducing its signal intensity (negative contrast agents). The most commonly used intravenous contrast agents are based on chelates of gadolinium, which is highly paramagnetic. In general, these agents have proved safer than the iodinated contrast agents used in X-ray radiography or CT. Anaphylactoid reactions are rare, occurring in approx. 0.03\u20130.1%. Of particular interest is the lower incidence of nephrotoxicity, compared with iodinated agents, when given at usual doses\u2014this has made contrast-enhanced MRI scanning an option for patients with renal impairment, who would otherwise not be able to undergo contrast-enhanced CT.\nGadolinium-based contrast reagents are typically octadentate complexes of gadolinium(III). The complex is very stable (log K &gt; 20) so that, in use, the concentration of the un-complexed Gd3+ ions should be below the toxicity limit. The 9th place in the metal ion's coordination sphere is occupied by a water molecule which exchanges rapidly with water molecules in the reagent molecule's immediate environment, affecting the magnetic resonance relaxation time.\nIn December 2017, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the United States announced in a drug safety communication that new warnings were to be included on all gadolinium-based contrast agents (GBCAs). The FDA also called for increased patient education and requiring gadolinium contrast vendors to conduct additional animal and clinical studies to assess the safety of these agents. Although gadolinium agents have proved useful for patients with kidney impairment, in patients with severe kidney failure requiring dialysis there is a risk of a rare but serious illness, nephrogenic systemic fibrosis, which may be linked to the use of certain gadolinium-containing agents. The most frequently linked is gadodiamide, but other agents have been linked too. Although a causal link has not been definitively established, current guidelines in the United States are that dialysis patients should only receive gadolinium agents where essential and that dialysis should be performed as soon as possible after the scan to remove the agent from the body promptly.\nIn Europe, where more gadolinium-containing agents are available, a classification of agents according to potential risks has been released. In 2008, a new contrast agent named gadoxetate, brand name Eovist (US) or Primovist (EU), was approved for diagnostic use: This has the theoretical benefit of a dual excretion path.\nSequences.\nAn MRI sequence is a particular setting of radiofrequency pulses and gradients, resulting in a particular image appearance. The T1 and T2 weighting can also be described as MRI sequences.\nOverview table.\n[ edit]&lt;br&gt;This table does not include uncommon and experimental sequences.\nSpecialized configurations.\nMagnetic resonance spectroscopy.\nMagnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) is used to measure the levels of different metabolites in body tissues, which can be achieved through a variety of single voxel or imaging-based techniques. The MR signal produces a spectrum of resonances that corresponds to different molecular arrangements of the isotope being \"excited\". This signature is used to diagnose certain metabolic disorders, especially those affecting the brain, and to provide information on tumor metabolism.\nMagnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging (MRSI) combines both spectroscopic and imaging methods to produce spatially localized spectra from within the sample or patient. The spatial resolution is much lower (limited by the available SNR), but the spectra in each voxel contains information about many metabolites. Because the available signal is used to encode spatial and spectral information, MRSI requires high SNR achievable only at higher field strengths (3 T and above). The high procurement and maintenance costs of MRI with extremely high field strengths inhibit their popularity. However, recent compressed sensing-based software algorithms (\"e.g.\", SAMV) have been proposed to achieve super-resolution without requiring such high field strengths.\nInterventional MRI.\nThe lack of harmful effects on the patient and the operator make MRI well-suited for interventional radiology, where the images produced by an MRI scanner guide minimally invasive procedures. Such procedures use no ferromagnetic instruments.\nA specialized growing subset of interventional MRI is intraoperative MRI, in which an MRI is used in surgery. Some specialized MRI systems allow imaging concurrent with the surgical procedure. More typically, the surgical procedure is temporarily interrupted so that MRI can assess the success of the procedure or guide subsequent surgical work.\nMagnetic resonance guided focused ultrasound.\nIn guided therapy, high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) beams are focused on a tissue, that are controlled using MR thermal imaging. Due to the high energy at the focus, the temperature rises to above 65 \u00b0C (150\u00a0\u00b0F) which completely destroys the tissue. This technology can achieve precise ablation of diseased tissue. MR imaging provides a three-dimensional view of the target tissue, allowing for the precise focusing of ultrasound energy. The MR imaging provides quantitative, real-time, thermal images of the treated area. This allows the physician to ensure that the temperature generated during each cycle of ultrasound energy is sufficient to cause thermal ablation within the desired tissue and if not, to adapt the parameters to ensure effective treatment.\nMultinuclear imaging.\nHydrogen has the most frequently imaged nucleus in MRI because it is present in biological tissues in great abundance, and because its high gyromagnetic ratio gives a strong signal. However, any nucleus with a net nuclear spin could potentially be imaged with MRI. Such nuclei include deuterium, helium-3, lithium-7, carbon-13, fluorine-19, oxygen-17, sodium-23, phosphorus-31 and xenon-129. 2H, 23Na and 31P are naturally abundant in the body, so they can be imaged directly. Naturally abundant deuterium at the concentration of around 15mM can be imaged, but suffers from low gamma sensitivity and quadripolar Relaxation (NMR). Deuterium imaging however has a sparse chemical shift spectra making it possible to develop tailored multiband selective RF pulses for metabolite selective imaging. Thus, metabolic imaging, similar to what's done with Carbon-13 is possible with Deuterium metabolic imaging (DMI) for insights into vivo metabolic processes. As well, the short T2 of deuterium allows it to be signal averaged rapidly, making up for some of its physical shortcomings. Gaseous isotopes such as 3He or 129Xe must be hyperpolarized and then inhaled as their nuclear density is too low to yield a useful signal under normal conditions. 17O and 19F can be administered in sufficient quantities in liquid form (e.g. 17O-water) that hyperpolarization is not a necessity. Using helium or xenon has the advantage of reduced background noise, and therefore increased contrast for the image itself, because these elements are not normally present in biological tissues.\nMoreover, the nucleus of any atom that has a net nuclear spin and that is bonded to a hydrogen atom could potentially be imaged via heteronuclear magnetization transfer MRI that would image the high-gyromagnetic-ratio hydrogen nucleus instead of the low-gyromagnetic-ratio nucleus that is bonded to the hydrogen atom. In principle, heteronuclear magnetization transfer MRI could be used to detect the presence or absence of specific chemical bonds.\nMultinuclear imaging is primarily a research technique at present. However, potential applications include functional imaging and imaging of organs poorly seen on 1H MRI (e.g., lungs and bones) or as alternative contrast agents. Inhaled hyperpolarized 3He can be used to image the distribution of air spaces within the lungs. Injectable solutions containing 13C or stabilized bubbles of hyperpolarized 129Xe have been studied as contrast agents for angiography and perfusion imaging. 31P can potentially provide information on bone density and structure, as well as functional imaging of the brain. Multinuclear imaging holds the potential to chart the distribution of lithium in the human brain, this element finding use as an important drug for those with conditions such as bipolar disorder.\nMolecular imaging by MRI.\nMRI has the advantages of having very high spatial resolution and is very adept at morphological imaging and functional imaging. MRI does have several disadvantages though. First, MRI has a sensitivity of around 10\u22123 mol/L to 10\u22125 mol/L, which, compared to other types of imaging, can be very limiting. This problem stems from the fact that the population difference between the nuclear spin states is very small at room temperature. For example, at 1.5 teslas, a typical field strength for clinical MRI, the difference between high and low energy states is approximately 9 molecules per 2\u00a0million. Improvements to increase MR sensitivity include increasing magnetic field strength and hyperpolarization via optical pumping or dynamic nuclear polarization. There are also a variety of signal amplification schemes based on chemical exchange that increase sensitivity.\nTo achieve molecular imaging of disease biomarkers using MRI, targeted MRI contrast agents with high specificity and high relaxivity (sensitivity) are required. To date, many studies have been devoted to developing targeted-MRI contrast agents to achieve molecular imaging by MRI. Commonly, peptides, antibodies, or small ligands, and small protein domains, such as HER-2 affibodies, have been applied to achieve targeting. To enhance the sensitivity of the contrast agents, these targeting moieties are usually linked to high payload MRI contrast agents or MRI contrast agents with high relaxivities. A new class of gene targeting MR contrast agents has been introduced to show gene action of unique mRNA and gene transcription factor proteins. These new contrast agents can trace cells with unique mRNA, microRNA and virus; tissue response to inflammation in living brains. The MR reports change in gene expression with positive correlation to TaqMan analysis, optical and electron microscopy.\nParallel MRI.\nIt takes time to gather MRI data using sequential applications of magnetic field gradients. Even for the most streamlined of MRI sequences, there are physical and physiologic limits to the rate of gradient switching. Parallel MRI circumvents these limits by gathering some portion of the data simultaneously, rather than in a traditional sequential fashion. This is accomplished using arrays of radiofrequency (RF) detector coils, each with a different 'view' of the body. A reduced set of gradient steps is applied, and the remaining spatial information is filled in by combining signals from various coils, based on their known spatial sensitivity patterns. The resulting acceleration is limited by the number of coils and by the signal to noise ratio (which decreases with increasing acceleration), but two- to four-fold accelerations may commonly be achieved with suitable coil array configurations, and substantially higher accelerations have been demonstrated with specialized coil arrays. Parallel MRI may be used with most MRI sequences.\nAfter a number of early suggestions for using arrays of detectors to accelerate imaging went largely unremarked in the MRI field, parallel imaging saw widespread development and application following the introduction of the simultaneous acquisition of spatial harmonics (SMASH) technique in 1996\u20137. The sensitivity encoding (SENSE) and generalized autocalibrating partially parallel acquisitions (GRAPPA) techniques are the parallel imaging methods in most common use today. The advent of parallel MRI resulted in extensive research and development in image reconstruction and RF coil design, as well as in a rapid expansion of the number of receiver channels available on commercial MR systems. Parallel MRI is now used routinely for MRI examinations in a wide range of body areas and clinical or research applications.\nQuantitative MRI.\nMost MRI focuses on qualitative interpretation of MR data by acquiring spatial maps of relative variations in signal strength which are \"weighted\" by certain parameters. Quantitative methods instead attempt to determine spatial maps of accurate tissue relaxometry parameter values or magnetic field, or to measure the size of certain spatial features.\nExamples of quantitative MRI methods are:\nQuantitative MRI aims to increase the reproducibility of MR images and interpretations, but has historically require longer scan times.\nQuantitative MRI (or qMRI) sometimes more specifically refers to multi-parametric quantitative MRI, the mapping of multiple tissue relaxometry parameters in a single imaging session. Efforts to make multi-parametric quantitative MRI faster have produced sequences which map multiple parameters simultaneously, either by building separate encoding methods for each parameter into the sequence, or by fitting MR signal evolution to a multi-parameter model.\nHyperpolarized gas MRI.\nTraditional MRI generates poor images of lung tissue because there are fewer water molecules with protons that can be excited by the magnetic field. Using hyperpolarized gas an MRI scan can identify ventilation defects in the lungs. Before the scan, a patient is asked to inhale hyperpolarized xenon mixed with a buffer gas of helium or nitrogen. The resulting lung images are much higher quality than with traditional MRI.\nSafety.\nMRI is, in general, a safe technique, although injuries may occur as a result of failed safety procedures or human error. Contraindications to MRI include most cochlear implants and cardiac pacemakers, shrapnel, and metallic foreign bodies in the eyes. Magnetic resonance imaging in pregnancy appears to be safe, at least during the second and third trimesters if done without contrast agents. Since MRI does not use any ionizing radiation, its use is generally favored in preference to CT when either modality could yield the same information. Some patients experience claustrophobia and may require sedation or shorter MRI protocols. Amplitude and rapid switching of gradient coils during image acquisition may cause peripheral nerve stimulation.\nMRI uses powerful magnets and can therefore cause magnetic materials to move at great speeds, posing a projectile risk, and may cause fatal accidents. However, as millions of MRIs are performed globally each year, fatalities are extremely rare.\nMRI machines can produce loud noise, up to 120 dB(A). This can cause hearing loss, tinnitus and hyperacusis, so appropriate hearing protection is essential for anyone inside the MRI scanner room during the examination.\nOveruse.\nMedical societies issue guidelines for when physicians should use MRI on patients and recommend against overuse. MRI can detect health problems or confirm a diagnosis, but medical societies often recommend that MRI not be the first procedure for creating a plan to diagnose or manage a patient's complaint. A common case is to use MRI to seek a cause of low back pain; the American College of Physicians, for example, recommends against imaging (including MRI) as unlikely to result in a positive outcome for the patient.\nArtifacts.\nAn MRI artifact is a visual artifact, that is, an anomaly during visual representation. Many different artifacts can occur during magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), some affecting the diagnostic quality, while others may be confused with pathology. Artifacts can be classified as patient-related, signal processing-dependent and hardware (machine)-related.\nNon-medical use.\nMRI is used industrially mainly for routine analysis of chemicals. The nuclear magnetic resonance technique is also used, for example, to measure the ratio between water and fat in foods, monitoring of flow of corrosive fluids in pipes, or to study molecular structures such as catalysts.\nBeing non-invasive and non-damaging, MRI can be used to study the anatomy of plants, their water transportation processes and water balance. It is also applied to veterinary radiology for diagnostic purposes. Outside this, its use in zoology is limited due to the high cost; but it can be used on many species.\nIn palaeontology it is used to examine the structure of fossils.\nForensic imaging provides graphic documentation of an autopsy, which manual autopsy does not. CT scanning provides quick whole-body imaging of skeletal and parenchymal alterations, whereas MR imaging gives better representation of soft tissue pathology. All that being said, MRI is more expensive, and more time-consuming to utilize. Moreover, the quality of MR imaging deteriorates below 10\u00a0\u00b0C.\nHistory.\nIn 1971 at Stony Brook University, Paul Lauterbur applied magnetic field gradients in all three dimensions and a back-projection technique to create NMR images. He published the first images of two tubes of water in 1973 in the journal \"Nature\", followed by the picture of a living animal, a clam, and in 1974 by the image of the thoracic cavity of a mouse. Lauterbur called his imaging method zeugmatography, a term which was replaced by (N)MR imaging. In the late 1970s, physicists Peter Mansfield at the University of Nottingham and Paul Lauterbur developed MRI-related techniques, like the echo-planar imaging (EPI) technique.\nRaymond Damadian's work into nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) has been incorporated into MRI, having built one of the first scanners.\nAdvances in semiconductor technology were crucial to the development of practical MRI, which requires a large amount of computational power. This was made possible by the rapidly increasing number of transistors on a single integrated circuit chip. Mansfield and Lauterbur were awarded the 2003 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for their \"discoveries concerning magnetic resonance imaging\".\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

For example, the integers with the addition operation form a group.\nThe concept of a group was elaborated for handling, in a unified way, many mathematical structures such as numbers, geometric shapes and polynomial roots. Because the concept of groups is ubiquitous in numerous areas both within and outside mathematics, some authors consider it as a central organizing principle of contemporary mathematics.\nIn geometry, groups arise naturally in the study of symmetries and geometric transformations: The symmetries of an object form a group, called the symmetry group of the object, and the transformations of a given type form a general group. Lie groups appear in symmetry groups in geometry, and also in the Standard Model of particle physics. The Poincar\u00e9 group is a Lie group consisting of the symmetries of spacetime in special relativity. Point groups describe symmetry in molecular chemistry.\nThe concept of a group arose in the study of polynomial equations. \u00c9variste Galois, in the 1830s, introduced the term \"group\" (French: ) for the symmetry group of the roots of an equation, now called a Galois group. After contributions from other fields such as number theory and geometry, the group notion was generalized and firmly established around 1870. Modern group theory\u2014an active mathematical discipline\u2014studies groups in their own right. To explore groups, mathematicians have devised various notions to break groups into smaller, better-understandable pieces, such as subgroups, quotient groups and simple groups. In addition to their abstract properties, group theorists also study the different ways in which a group can be expressed concretely, both from a point of view of representation theory (that is, through the representations of the group) and of computational group theory. A theory has been developed for finite groups, which culminated with the classification of finite simple groups, completed in 2004. Since the mid-1980s, geometric group theory, which studies finitely generated groups as geometric objects, has become an active area in group theory.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:TOC limit/styles.css\" /&gt;\nDefinition and illustration.\nFirst example: the integers.\nOne of the more familiar groups is the set of integers \nformula_1\ntogether with addition. For any two integers formula_2 and &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;, the sum formula_3 is also an integer; this \"closure\" property says that formula_4 is a binary operation on &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;. The following properties of integer addition serve as a model for the group axioms in the definition below.\nThe integers, together with the operation &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;, form a mathematical object belonging to a broad class sharing similar structural aspects. To appropriately understand these structures as a collective, the following definition is developed.\nDefinition.\nA group is a set formula_17 together with a binary operation on &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;, here denoted \"&amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;\", that combines any two elements formula_2 and formula_5 of formula_17 to form an element of &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;, denoted &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;, such that the following three requirements, known as group axioms, are satisfied:\n Such an element is unique (see below). It is called the \"identity element\" (or sometimes \"neutral element\") of the group.\n For each &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;, the element formula_5 is unique (see below); it is called \"the inverse\" of formula_2 and is commonly denoted &amp;NoBreak;}&amp;NoBreak;.\nNotation and terminology.\nFormally, a group is an ordered pair of a set and a binary operation on this set that satisfies the group axioms. The set is called the \"underlying set\" of the group, and the operation is called the \"group operation\" or the \"group law\".\nA group and its underlying set are thus two different mathematical objects. To avoid cumbersome notation, it is common to abuse notation by using the same symbol to denote both. This reflects also an informal way of thinking: that the group is the same as the set except that it has been enriched by additional structure provided by the operation.\nFor example, consider the set of real numbers &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;, which has the operations of addition formula_3 and multiplication &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;. Formally, formula_32 is a set, formula_33 is a group, and formula_34 is a field. But it is common to write formula_32 to denote any of these three objects.\nThe \"additive group\" of the field formula_32 is the group whose underlying set is formula_32 and whose operation is addition. The \"multiplicative group\" of the field formula_32 is the group formula_39 whose underlying set is the set of nonzero real numbers formula_40 and whose operation is multiplication.\nMore generally, one speaks of an \"additive group\" whenever the group operation is notated as addition; in this case, the identity is typically denoted &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;, and the inverse of an element formula_41 is denoted &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;. Similarly, one speaks of a \"multiplicative group\" whenever the group operation is notated as multiplication; in this case, the identity is typically denoted &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;, and the inverse of an element formula_41 is denoted &amp;NoBreak;}&amp;NoBreak;. In a multiplicative group, the operation symbol is usually omitted entirely, so that the operation is denoted by juxtaposition, formula_43 instead of &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;.\nThe definition of a group does not require that formula_44 for all elements formula_2 and formula_5 in &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;. If this additional condition holds, then the operation is said to be commutative, and the group is called an abelian group. It is a common convention that for an abelian group either additive or multiplicative notation may be used, but for a nonabelian group only multiplicative notation is used.\nSeveral other notations are commonly used for groups whose elements are not numbers. For a group whose elements are functions, the operation is often function composition &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;; then the identity may be denoted id. In the more specific cases of geometric transformation groups, symmetry groups, permutation groups, and automorphism groups, the symbol formula_47 is often omitted, as for multiplicative groups. Many other variants of notation may be encountered.\nSecond example: a symmetry group.\n&lt;/math&gt; (vertical reflection)\n | image6 = group D8 fh.svg\n | alt6 = The square is reflected horizontally; the corners are enumerated accordingly.\n | caption6 = formula_48 (horizontal reflection) \n | image7 = group D8 f13.svg\n | alt7 = The square is reflected along the SW\u2013NE diagonal; the corners are enumerated accordingly.\n | caption7 = formula_49 (diagonal reflection) \n | image8 = group D8 f24.svg\n | alt8 = The square is reflected along the SE\u2013NW diagonal; the corners are enumerated accordingly.\n | caption8 = formula_50 (counter-diagonal reflection)\n | total_width = 600\nTwo figures in the plane are congruent if one can be changed into the other using a combination of rotations, reflections, and translations. Any figure is congruent to itself. However, some figures are congruent to themselves in more than one way, and these extra congruences are called symmetries. A square has eight symmetries. These are:\nThese symmetries are functions. Each sends a point in the square to the corresponding point under the symmetry. For example, formula_53 sends a point to its rotation 90\u00b0 clockwise around the square's center, and formula_48 sends a point to its reflection across the square's vertical middle line. Composing two of these symmetries gives another symmetry. These symmetries determine a group called the dihedral group of degree four, denoted &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;. The underlying set of the group is the above set of symmetries, and the group operation is function composition. Two symmetries are combined by composing them as functions, that is, applying the first one to the square, and the second one to the result of the first application. The result of performing first formula_2 and then formula_5 is written symbolically \"from right to left\" as formula_57 (\"apply the symmetry formula_5 after performing the symmetry &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;\"). This is the usual notation for the composition of functions.\nA Cayley table lists the results of all such compositions possible. For example, rotating by 270\u00b0 clockwise (&amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;) and then reflecting horizontally (&amp;NoBreak;}&amp;NoBreak;) is the same as performing a reflection along the diagonal (&amp;NoBreak;}&amp;NoBreak;). Using the above symbols, highlighted in blue in the Cayley table:\nformula_59\nGiven this set of symmetries and the described operation, the group axioms can be understood as follows:\nIn contrast to the group of integers above, where the order of the operation is immaterial, it does matter in &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;, as, for example, formula_73 but &amp;NoBreak;}&amp;NoBreak;. In other words, formula_74 is not abelian.\nHistory.\nThe modern concept of an abstract group developed out of several fields of mathematics. The original motivation for group theory was the quest for solutions of polynomial equations of degree higher than 4. The 19th-century French mathematician \u00c9variste Galois, extending prior work of Paolo Ruffini and Joseph-Louis Lagrange, gave a criterion for the solvability of a particular polynomial equation in terms of the symmetry group of its roots (solutions). The elements of such a Galois group correspond to certain permutations of the roots. At first, Galois's ideas were rejected by his contemporaries, and published only posthumously. More general permutation groups were investigated in particular by Augustin Louis Cauchy. Arthur Cayley's \"On the theory of groups, as depending on the symbolic equation formula_75\" (1854) gives the first abstract definition of a finite group.\nGeometry was a second field in which groups were used systematically, especially symmetry groups as part of Felix Klein's 1872 Erlangen program. After novel geometries such as hyperbolic and projective geometry had emerged, Klein used group theory to organize them in a more coherent way. Further advancing these ideas, Sophus Lie founded the study of Lie groups in 1884.\nThe third field contributing to group theory was number theory. Certain abelian group structures had been used implicitly in Carl Friedrich Gauss's number-theoretical work \"Disquisitiones Arithmeticae\" (1798), and more explicitly by Leopold Kronecker. In 1847, Ernst Kummer made early attempts to prove Fermat's Last Theorem by developing groups describing factorization into prime numbers.\nThe convergence of these various sources into a uniform theory of groups started with 's . introduced the idea of specifying a group by means of generators and relations, and was also the first to give an axiomatic definition of an \"abstract group\", in the terminology of the time. As of the 20th century, groups gained wide recognition by the pioneering work of Ferdinand Georg Frobenius and William Burnside, who worked on representation theory of finite groups and wrote the first book about group theory in the English language: \"Theory of Groups of Finite Order\", Richard Brauer's modular representation theory and Issai Schur's papers. The theory of Lie groups, and more generally locally compact groups was studied by Hermann Weyl, \u00c9lie Cartan and many others. Its algebraic counterpart, the theory of algebraic groups, was first shaped by Claude Chevalley (from the late 1930s) and later by the work of Armand Borel and Jacques Tits.\nThe University of Chicago's 1960\u201361 Group Theory Year brought together group theorists such as Daniel Gorenstein, John G. Thompson and Walter Feit, laying the foundation of a collaboration that, with input from numerous other mathematicians, led to the classification of finite simple groups, with the final step taken by Aschbacher and Smith in 2004. This project exceeded previous mathematical endeavours by its sheer size, in both length of proof and number of researchers. Research concerning this classification proof is ongoing. Group theory remains a highly active mathematical branch, impacting many other fields, as the examples below illustrate.\nElementary consequences of the group axioms.\nBasic facts about all groups that can be obtained directly from the group axioms are commonly subsumed under \"elementary group theory\". For example, repeated applications of the associativity axiom show that the unambiguity of\nformula_76\ngeneralizes to more than three factors. Because this implies that parentheses can be inserted anywhere within such a series of terms, parentheses are usually omitted.\nUniqueness of identity element.\nThe group axioms imply that the identity element is unique; that is, there exists only one identity element: any two identity elements formula_21 and formula_78 of a group are equal, because the group axioms imply &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;. It is thus customary to speak of \"the\" identity element of the group.\nUniqueness of inverses.\nThe group axioms also imply that the inverse of each element is unique. Let a group element formula_2 have both formula_5 and formula_8 as inverses. Then\n formula_82\nTherefore, it is customary to speak of \"the\" inverse of an element.\nDivision.\nGiven elements formula_2 and formula_5 of a group &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;, there is a unique solution formula_41 in formula_17 to the equation &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;, namely &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;. It follows that for each formula_2 in &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;, the function formula_88 that maps each formula_41 to formula_90 is a bijection; it is called \"left multiplication\" by formula_2 or \"left translation\" by &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;.\nSimilarly, given formula_2 and &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;, the unique solution to formula_93 is &amp;NoBreak;}&amp;NoBreak;. For each &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;, the function formula_88 that maps each formula_41 to formula_96 is a bijection called \"right multiplication\" by formula_2 or \"right translation\" by &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;.\nEquivalent definition with relaxed axioms.\nThe group axioms for identity and inverses may be \"weakened\" to assert only the existence of a left identity and left inverses. From these \"one-sided axioms\", one can prove that the left identity is also a right identity and a left inverse is also a right inverse for the same element. Since they define exactly the same structures as groups, collectively the axioms are not weaker.\nIn particular, assuming associativity and the existence of a left identity formula_21 (that is, &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;) and a left inverse formula_99 for each element formula_78 (that is, &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;), it follows that every left inverse is also a right inverse of the same element as follows.\nIndeed, one has\n formula_101\nSimilarly, the left identity is also a right identity:\n formula_102\nThese results do not hold if any of these axioms (associativity, existence of left identity and existence of left inverse) is removed. For a structure with a looser definition (like a semigroup) one may have, for example, that a left identity is not necessarily a right identity.\nThe same result can be obtained by only assuming the existence of a right identity and a right inverse.\nHowever, only assuming the existence of a \"left\" identity and a \"right\" inverse (or vice versa) is not sufficient to define a group. For example, consider the set formula_103 with the operator formula_104 satisfying formula_105 and &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;. This structure does have a left identity (namely, &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;), and each element has a right inverse (which is formula_21 for both elements). Furthermore, this operation is associative (since the product of any number of elements is always equal to the rightmost element in that product, regardless of the order in which these operations are applied). However, formula_107 is not a group, since it lacks a right identity.\nBasic concepts.\nWhen studying sets, one uses concepts such as subset, function, and quotient by an equivalence relation. When studying groups, one uses instead subgroups, homomorphisms, and quotient groups. These are the analogues that take the group structure into account.\nGroup homomorphisms.\nGroup homomorphisms are functions that respect group structure; they may be used to relate two groups. A \"homomorphism\" from a group formula_108 to a group formula_109 is a function formula_110 such that\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Block indent/styles.css\"/&gt;\nIt would be natural to require also that formula_111 respect identities, &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;, and inverses, formula_112 for all formula_2 in &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;. However, these additional requirements need not be included in the definition of homomorphisms, because they are already implied by the requirement of respecting the group operation.\nThe \"identity homomorphism\" of a group formula_17 is the homomorphism formula_115 that maps each element of formula_17 to itself. An \"inverse homomorphism\" of a homomorphism formula_110 is a homomorphism formula_118 such that formula_119 and &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;, that is, such that formula_120 for all formula_121 in formula_17 and such that formula_123 for all formula_124 in &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;. An \"isomorphism\" is a homomorphism that has an inverse homomorphism; equivalently, it is a bijective homomorphism. Groups formula_17 and formula_126 are called \"isomorphic\" if there exists an isomorphism &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;. In this case, formula_126 can be obtained from formula_17 simply by renaming its elements according to the function &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;; then any statement true for formula_17 is true for &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;, provided that any specific elements mentioned in the statement are also renamed.\nThe collection of all groups, together with the homomorphisms between them, form a category, the category of groups.\nAn injective homomorphism formula_130 factors canonically as an isomorphism followed by an inclusion, formula_131 for some subgroup &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak; of &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;.\nInjective homomorphisms are the monomorphisms in the category of groups.\nSubgroups.\nInformally, a \"subgroup\" is a group formula_126 contained within a bigger one, &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;: it has a subset of the elements of &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;, with the same operation. Concretely, this means that the identity element of formula_17 must be contained in &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;, and whenever formula_134 and formula_135 are both in &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;, then so are formula_136 and &amp;NoBreak;}&amp;NoBreak;, so the elements of &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;, equipped with the group operation on formula_17 restricted to &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;, indeed form a group. In this case, the inclusion map formula_138 is a homomorphism.\nIn the example of symmetries of a square, the identity and the rotations constitute a subgroup &amp;NoBreak;}&amp;NoBreak;, highlighted in red in the Cayley table of the example: any two rotations composed are still a rotation, and a rotation can be undone by (i.e., is inverse to) the complementary rotations 270\u00b0 for 90\u00b0, 180\u00b0 for 180\u00b0, and 90\u00b0 for 270\u00b0. The subgroup test provides a necessary and sufficient condition for a nonempty subset &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak; of a group &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak; to be a subgroup: it is sufficient to check that formula_139 for all elements formula_121 and formula_124 in &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;. Knowing a group's subgroups is important in understanding the group as a whole.\nGiven any subset formula_142 of a group &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;, the subgroup generated by formula_142 consists of all products of elements of formula_142 and their inverses. It is the smallest subgroup of formula_17 containing &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;. In the example of symmetries of a square, the subgroup generated by formula_52 and formula_147 consists of these two elements, the identity element &amp;NoBreak;}&amp;NoBreak;, and the element &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;. Again, this is a subgroup, because combining any two of these four elements or their inverses (which are, in this particular case, these same elements) yields an element of this subgroup.\nCosets.\nIn many situations it is desirable to consider two group elements the same if they differ by an element of a given subgroup. For example, in the symmetry group of a square, once any reflection is performed, rotations alone cannot return the square to its original position, so one can think of the reflected positions of the square as all being equivalent to each other, and as inequivalent to the unreflected positions; the rotation operations are irrelevant to the question whether a reflection has been performed. Cosets are used to formalize this insight: a subgroup formula_126 determines left and right cosets, which can be thought of as translations of formula_126 by an arbitrary group element &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;. In symbolic terms, the \"left\" and \"right\" cosets of &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;, containing an element &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;, are\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Block indent/styles.css\"/&gt;\nThe left cosets of any subgroup formula_126 form a partition of &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;; that is, the union of all left cosets is equal to formula_17 and two left cosets are either equal or have an empty intersection. The first case formula_152 happens precisely when &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;, i.e., when the two elements differ by an element of &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;. Similar considerations apply to the right cosets of &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;. The left cosets of formula_126 may or may not be the same as its right cosets. If they are (that is, if all formula_121 in formula_17 satisfy &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;), then formula_126 is said to be a \"normal subgroup\".\nIn &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;, the group of symmetries of a square, with its subgroup formula_157 of rotations, the left cosets formula_158 are either equal to &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;, if formula_121 is an element of formula_157 itself, or otherwise equal to formula_161 (highlighted in green in the Cayley table of &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;). The subgroup formula_157 is normal, because formula_163 and similarly for the other elements of the group. (In fact, in the case of &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;, the cosets generated by reflections are all equal: &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;.)\nQuotient groups.\nSuppose that formula_164 is a normal subgroup of a group &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;, and\nformula_165\ndenotes its set of cosets.\nThen there is a unique group law on formula_166 for which the map formula_167 sending each element formula_121 to formula_169 is a homomorphism.\nExplicitly, the product of two cosets formula_169 and formula_171 is &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;, the coset formula_172 serves as the identity of &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;, and the inverse of formula_169 in the quotient group is &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;.\nThe group &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;, read as \"&amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak; modulo &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;\", is called a \"quotient group\" or \"factor group\".\nThe quotient group can alternatively be characterized by a universal property.\nThe elements of the quotient group formula_174 are formula_157 and &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;. The group operation on the quotient is shown in the table. For example, &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;. Both the subgroup formula_176 and the quotient formula_174 are abelian, but formula_74 is not. Sometimes a group can be reconstructed from a subgroup and quotient (plus some additional data), by the semidirect product construction; formula_74 is an example.\nThe first isomorphism theorem implies that any surjective homomorphism formula_180 factors canonically as a quotient homomorphism followed by an isomorphism: &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;.\nSurjective homomorphisms are the epimorphisms in the category of groups.\nPresentations.\nEvery group is isomorphic to a quotient of a free group, in many ways.\nFor example, the dihedral group formula_74 is generated by the right rotation formula_53 and the reflection formula_147 in a vertical line (every element of formula_74 is a finite product of copies of these and their inverses).\nHence there is a surjective homomorphism &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak; from the free group formula_185 on two generators to formula_74 sending formula_187 to formula_53 and formula_78 to &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;.\nElements in formula_190 are called \"relations\"; examples include &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;.\nIn fact, it turns out that formula_190 is the smallest normal subgroup of formula_185 containing these three elements; in other words, all relations are consequences of these three.\nThe quotient of the free group by this normal subgroup is denoted &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;.\nThis is called a \"presentation\" of formula_74 by generators and relations, because the first isomorphism theorem for &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak; yields an isomorphism &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;. \nA presentation of a group can be used to construct the Cayley graph, a graphical depiction of a discrete group.\nExamples and applications.\nExamples and applications of groups abound. A starting point is the group formula_194 of integers with addition as group operation, introduced above. If, instead of addition, multiplication is considered, one obtains multiplicative groups. These groups are predecessors of important constructions in abstract algebra.\nGroups are also applied in many other mathematical areas. Mathematical objects are often examined by associating groups to them and studying the properties of the corresponding groups. For example, Henri Poincar\u00e9 founded what is now called algebraic topology by introducing the fundamental group. By means of this connection, topological properties such as proximity and continuity translate into properties of groups.\nElements of the fundamental group of a topological space are equivalence classes of loops, where loops are considered equivalent if one can be smoothly deformed into another, and the group operation is \"concatenation\" (tracing one loop then the other). For example, as shown in the figure, if the topological space is the plane with one point removed, then loops which do not wrap around the missing point (blue) can be smoothly contracted to a single point and are the identity element of the fundamental group. A loop which wraps around the missing point formula_195 times cannot be deformed into a loop which wraps formula_196 times (with &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;), because the loop cannot be smoothly deformed across the hole, so each class of loops is characterized by its winding number around the missing point. The resulting group is isomorphic to the integers under addition.\nIn more recent applications, the influence has also been reversed to motivate geometric constructions by a group-theoretical background. In a similar vein, geometric group theory employs geometric concepts, for example in the study of hyperbolic groups. Further branches crucially applying groups include algebraic geometry and number theory.\nIn addition to the above theoretical applications, many practical applications of groups exist. Cryptography relies on the combination of the abstract group theory approach together with algorithmical knowledge obtained in computational group theory, in particular when implemented for finite groups. Applications of group theory are not restricted to mathematics; sciences such as physics, chemistry and computer science benefit from the concept.\nNumbers.\nMany number systems, such as the integers and the rationals, enjoy a naturally given group structure. In some cases, such as with the rationals, both addition and multiplication operations give rise to group structures. Such number systems are predecessors to more general algebraic structures known as rings and fields. Further abstract algebraic concepts such as modules, vector spaces and algebras also form groups.\nIntegers.\nThe group of integers formula_194 under addition, denoted &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;, has been described above. The integers, with the operation of multiplication instead of addition, formula_198 do \"not\" form a group. The associativity and identity axioms are satisfied, but inverses do not exist: for example, formula_199 is an integer, but the only solution to the equation formula_200 in this case is &amp;NoBreak;}&amp;NoBreak;, which is a rational number, but not an integer. Hence not every element of formula_194 has a (multiplicative) inverse.\nRationals.\nThe desire for the existence of multiplicative inverses suggests considering fractions\nformula_202\nFractions of integers (with formula_5 nonzero) are known as rational numbers. The set of all such irreducible fractions is commonly denoted &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;. There is still a minor obstacle for &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;, the rationals with multiplication, being a group: because zero does not have a multiplicative inverse (i.e., there is no formula_41 such that &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;), formula_205 is still not a group.\nHowever, the set of all \"nonzero\" rational numbers formula_206 does form an abelian group under multiplication, also denoted &amp;NoBreak;}&amp;NoBreak;. Associativity and identity element axioms follow from the properties of integers. The closure requirement still holds true after removing zero, because the product of two nonzero rationals is never zero. Finally, the inverse of formula_207 is &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;, therefore the axiom of the inverse element is satisfied.\nThe rational numbers (including zero) also form a group under addition. Intertwining addition and multiplication operations yields more complicated structures called rings and \u2013 if division by other than zero is possible, such as in formula_208 \u2013 fields, which occupy a central position in abstract algebra. Group theoretic arguments therefore underlie parts of the theory of those entities.\nModular arithmetic.\nModular arithmetic for a \"modulus\" formula_209 defines any two elements formula_2 and formula_5 that differ by a multiple of formula_209 to be equivalent, denoted by &amp;NoBreak;}&amp;NoBreak;. Every integer is equivalent to one of the integers from formula_213 to &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;, and the operations of modular arithmetic modify normal arithmetic by replacing the result of any operation by its equivalent representative. Modular addition, defined in this way for the integers from formula_213 to &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;, forms a group, denoted as formula_215 or &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;, with formula_213 as the identity element and formula_217 as the inverse element of &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;.\nA familiar example is addition of hours on the face of a clock, where 12 rather than 0 is chosen as the representative of the identity. If the hour hand is on formula_218 and is advanced formula_219 hours, it ends up on &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;, as shown in the illustration. This is expressed by saying that formula_220 is congruent to formula_221 \"modulo &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;\" or, in symbols,\nformula_222\nFor any prime number &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;, there is also the multiplicative group of integers modulo &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;. Its elements can be represented by formula_221 to &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;. The group operation, multiplication modulo &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;, replaces the usual product by its representative, the remainder of division by &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;. For example, for &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;, the four group elements can be represented by &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;. In this group, &amp;NoBreak;}&amp;NoBreak;, because the usual product formula_224 is equivalent to &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;: when divided by formula_225 it yields a remainder of &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;. The primality of formula_226 ensures that the usual product of two representatives is not divisible by &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;, and therefore that the modular product is nonzero. The identity element is represented by\u00a0&amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;, and associativity follows from the corresponding property of the integers. Finally, the inverse element axiom requires that given an integer formula_2 not divisible by &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;, there exists an integer formula_5 such that \nformula_229\nthat is, such that formula_226 evenly divides &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;. The inverse formula_5 can be found by using B\u00e9zout's identity and the fact that the greatest common divisor formula_232 equals\u00a0&amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;. In the case formula_233 above, the inverse of the element represented by formula_219 is that represented by &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;, and the inverse of the element represented by formula_235 is represented by\u00a0&amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;, as &amp;NoBreak;}&amp;NoBreak;. Hence all group axioms are fulfilled. This example is similar to formula_236 above: it consists of exactly those elements in the ring formula_237 that have a multiplicative inverse. These groups, denoted &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;, are crucial to public-key cryptography.\nCyclic groups.\nA \"cyclic group\" is a group all of whose elements are powers of a particular element &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;. In multiplicative notation, the elements of the group are\nformula_238\nwhere formula_239 means &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;, formula_240 stands for &amp;NoBreak;}&amp;NoBreak;, etc. Such an element formula_2 is called a generator or a primitive element of the group. In additive notation, the requirement for an element to be primitive is that each element of the group can be written as\nformula_242\nIn the groups formula_243 introduced above, the element formula_221 is primitive, so these groups are cyclic. Indeed, each element is expressible as a sum all of whose terms are &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;. Any cyclic group with formula_209 elements is isomorphic to this group. A second example for cyclic groups is the group of &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;th complex roots of unity, given by complex numbers formula_246 satisfying &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;. These numbers can be visualized as the vertices on a regular formula_209-gon, as shown in blue in the image for &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;. The group operation is multiplication of complex numbers. In the picture, multiplying with formula_246 corresponds to a counter-clockwise rotation by 60\u00b0. From field theory, the group formula_249 is cyclic for prime formula_226: for example, if &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;, formula_235 is a generator since &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;, &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;, &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;, and &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;.\nSome cyclic groups have an infinite number of elements. In these groups, for every non-zero element &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;, all the powers of formula_2 are distinct; despite the name \"cyclic group\", the powers of the elements do not cycle. An infinite cyclic group is isomorphic to &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;, the group of integers under addition introduced above. As these two prototypes are both abelian, so are all cyclic groups.\nThe study of finitely generated abelian groups is quite mature, including the fundamental theorem of finitely generated abelian groups; and reflecting this state of affairs, many group-related notions, such as center and commutator, describe the extent to which a given group is not abelian.\nSymmetry groups.\n\"Symmetry groups\" are groups consisting of symmetries of given mathematical objects, principally geometric entities, such as the symmetry group of the square given as an introductory example above, although they also arise in algebra such as the symmetries among the roots of polynomial equations dealt with in Galois theory (see below). Conceptually, group theory can be thought of as the study of symmetry. Symmetries in mathematics greatly simplify the study of geometrical or analytical objects. A group is said to act on another mathematical object &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak; if every group element can be associated to some operation on &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak; and the composition of these operations follows the group law. For example, an element of the (2,3,7) triangle group acts on a triangular tiling of the hyperbolic plane by permuting the triangles. By a group action, the group pattern is connected to the structure of the object being acted on.\nIn chemistry, point groups describe molecular symmetries, while space groups describe crystal symmetries in crystallography. These symmetries underlie the chemical and physical behavior of these systems, and group theory enables simplification of quantum mechanical analysis of these properties. For example, group theory is used to show that optical transitions between certain quantum levels cannot occur simply because of the symmetry of the states involved.\nGroup theory helps predict the changes in physical properties that occur when a material undergoes a phase transition, for example, from a cubic to a tetrahedral crystalline form. An example is ferroelectric materials, where the change from a paraelectric to a ferroelectric state occurs at the Curie temperature and is related to a change from the high-symmetry paraelectric state to the lower symmetry ferroelectric state, accompanied by a so-called soft phonon mode, a vibrational lattice mode that goes to zero frequency at the transition.\nSuch spontaneous symmetry breaking has found further application in elementary particle physics, where its occurrence is related to the appearance of Goldstone bosons.\nFinite symmetry groups such as the Mathieu groups are used in coding theory, which is in turn applied in error correction of transmitted data, and in CD players. Another application is differential Galois theory, which characterizes functions having antiderivatives of a prescribed form, giving group-theoretic criteria for when solutions of certain differential equations are well-behaved. Geometric properties that remain stable under group actions are investigated in (geometric) invariant theory.\nGeneral linear group and representation theory.\nMatrix groups consist of matrices together with matrix multiplication. The \"general linear group\" formula_253 consists of all invertible &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;-by-&amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak; matrices with real entries. Its subgroups are referred to as \"matrix groups\" or \"linear groups\". The dihedral group example mentioned above can be viewed as a (very small) matrix group. Another important matrix group is the special orthogonal group &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;. It describes all possible rotations in formula_209 dimensions. Rotation matrices in this group are used in computer graphics.\n\"Representation theory\" is both an application of the group concept and important for a deeper understanding of groups. It studies the group by its group actions on other spaces. A broad class of group representations are linear representations in which the group acts on a vector space, such as the three-dimensional Euclidean space &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;. A representation of a group formula_17 on an formula_209-dimensional real vector space is simply a group homomorphism\nformula_257\nfrom the group to the general linear group. This way, the group operation, which may be abstractly given, translates to the multiplication of matrices making it accessible to explicit computations.\nA group action gives further means to study the object being acted on. On the other hand, it also yields information about the group. Group representations are an organizing principle in the theory of finite groups, Lie groups, algebraic groups and topological groups, especially (locally) compact groups.\nGalois groups.\n\"Galois groups\" were developed to help solve polynomial equations by capturing their symmetry features. For example, the solutions of the quadratic equation formula_258 are given by\nformula_259\nEach solution can be obtained by replacing the formula_260 sign by formula_4 or &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;; analogous formulae are known for cubic and quartic equations, but do \"not\" exist in general for degree 5 and higher. In the quadratic formula, changing the sign (permuting the resulting two solutions) can be viewed as a (very simple) group operation. Analogous Galois groups act on the solutions of higher-degree polynomial equations and are closely related to the existence of formulas for their solution. Abstract properties of these groups (in particular their solvability) give a criterion for the ability to express the solutions of these polynomials using solely addition, multiplication, and roots similar to the formula above.\nModern Galois theory generalizes the above type of Galois groups by shifting to field theory and considering field extensions formed as the splitting field of a polynomial. This theory establishes\u2014via the fundamental theorem of Galois theory\u2014a precise relationship between fields and groups, underlining once again the ubiquity of groups in mathematics.\nFinite groups.\nA group is called \"finite\" if it has a finite number of elements. The number of elements is called the order of the group. An important class is the \"symmetric groups\" &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;, the groups of permutations of formula_164 objects. For example, the symmetric group on 3 letters formula_263 is the group of all possible reorderings of the objects. The three letters ABC can be reordered into ABC, ACB, BAC, BCA, CAB, CBA, forming in total 6 (factorial of 3) elements. The group operation is composition of these reorderings, and the identity element is the reordering operation that leaves the order unchanged. This class is fundamental insofar as any finite group can be expressed as a subgroup of a symmetric group formula_264 for a suitable integer &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;, according to Cayley's theorem. Parallel to the group of symmetries of the square above, formula_263 can also be interpreted as the group of symmetries of an equilateral triangle.\nThe order of an element formula_2 in a group formula_17 is the least positive integer formula_209 such that &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;, where formula_269 represents\nformula_270\nthat is, application of the operation \"&amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;\" to formula_209 copies of &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;. (If \"&amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;\" represents multiplication, then formula_269 corresponds to the &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;th power of &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;.) In infinite groups, such an formula_209 may not exist, in which case the order of formula_2 is said to be infinity. The order of an element equals the order of the cyclic subgroup generated by this element.\nMore sophisticated counting techniques, for example, counting cosets, yield more precise statements about finite groups: Lagrange's Theorem states that for a finite group formula_17 the order of any finite subgroup formula_126 divides the order of &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;. The Sylow theorems give a partial converse.\nThe dihedral group formula_74 of symmetries of a square is a finite group of order 8. In this group, the order of formula_53 is 4, as is the order of the subgroup formula_157 that this element generates. The order of the reflection elements formula_147 etc. is 2. Both orders divide 8, as predicted by Lagrange's theorem. The groups formula_249 of multiplication modulo a prime formula_226 have order &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;.\nFinite abelian groups.\nAny finite abelian group is isomorphic to a product of finite cyclic groups; this statement is part of the fundamental theorem of finitely generated abelian groups.\nAny group of prime order formula_226 is isomorphic to the cyclic group formula_284 (a consequence of Lagrange's theorem). \nAny group of order formula_285 is abelian, isomorphic to formula_286 or &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;.\nBut there exist nonabelian groups of order &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;; the dihedral group formula_74 of order formula_288 above is an example.\nSimple groups.\nWhen a group formula_17 has a normal subgroup formula_164 other than formula_291 and formula_17 itself, questions about formula_17 can sometimes be reduced to questions about formula_164 and &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;. A nontrivial group is called \"simple\" if it has no such normal subgroup. Finite simple groups are to finite groups as prime numbers are to positive integers: they serve as building blocks, in a sense made precise by the Jordan\u2013H\u00f6lder theorem.\nClassification of finite simple groups.\nComputer algebra systems have been used to list all groups of order up to 2000.\nBut classifying all finite groups is a problem considered too hard to be solved.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\nThe axioms for a group are short and natural ... Yet somehow hidden behind these axioms is the monster simple group, a huge and extraordinary mathematical object, which appears to rely on numerous bizarre coincidences to exist. The axioms for groups give no obvious hint that anything like this exists.\nRichard Borcherds\n, \"Mathematicians: An Outer View of the Inner World\"\nThe classification of all finite \"simple\" groups was a major achievement in contemporary group theory. There are several infinite families of such groups, as well as 26 \"sporadic groups\" that do not belong to any of the families. The largest sporadic group is called the monster group. The monstrous moonshine conjectures, proved by Richard Borcherds, relate the monster group to certain modular functions.\nThe gap between the classification of simple groups and the classification of all groups lies in the extension problem.\nGroups with additional structure.\nAn equivalent definition of group consists of replacing the \"there exist\" part of the group axioms by operations whose result is the element that must exist. So, a group is a set formula_17 equipped with a binary operation formula_296 (the group operation), a unary operation formula_297 (which provides the inverse) and a nullary operation, which has no operand and results in the identity element. Otherwise, the group axioms are exactly the same. This variant of the definition avoids existential quantifiers and is used in computing with groups and for computer-aided proofs.\nThis way of defining groups lends itself to generalizations such as the notion of group object in a category. Briefly, this is an object with morphisms that mimic the group axioms.\nTopological groups.\nSome topological spaces may be endowed with a group law. In order for the group law and the topology to interweave well, the group operations must be continuous functions; informally, formula_298 and formula_299 must not vary wildly if formula_121 and formula_124 vary only a little. Such groups are called \"topological groups,\" and they are the group objects in the category of topological spaces. The most basic examples are the group of real numbers under addition and the group of nonzero real numbers under multiplication. Similar examples can be formed from any other topological field, such as the field of complex numbers or the field of \"p\"-adic numbers. These examples are locally compact, so they have Haar measures and can be studied via harmonic analysis. Other locally compact topological groups include the group of points of an algebraic group over a local field or adele ring; these are basic to number theory Galois groups of infinite algebraic field extensions are equipped with the Krull topology, which plays a role in infinite Galois theory. A generalization used in algebraic geometry is the \u00e9tale fundamental group.\nLie groups.\nA \"Lie group\" is a group that also has the structure of a differentiable manifold; informally, this means that it looks locally like a Euclidean space of some fixed dimension. Again, the definition requires the additional structure, here the manifold structure, to be compatible: the multiplication and inverse maps are required to be smooth.\nA standard example is the general linear group introduced above: it is an open subset of the space of all formula_209-by-formula_209 matrices, because it is given by the inequality\nformula_304\nwhere formula_305 denotes an formula_209-by-formula_209 matrix.\nLie groups are of fundamental importance in modern physics: Noether's theorem links continuous symmetries to conserved quantities. Rotation, as well as translations in space and time, are basic symmetries of the laws of mechanics. They can, for instance, be used to construct simple models\u2014imposing, say, axial symmetry on a situation will typically lead to significant simplification in the equations one needs to solve to provide a physical description. Another example is the group of Lorentz transformations, which relate measurements of time and velocity of two observers in motion relative to each other. They can be deduced in a purely group-theoretical way, by expressing the transformations as a rotational symmetry of Minkowski space. The latter serves\u2014in the absence of significant gravitation\u2014as a model of spacetime in special relativity. The full symmetry group of Minkowski space, i.e., including translations, is known as the Poincar\u00e9 group. By the above, it plays a pivotal role in special relativity and, by implication, for quantum field theories. Symmetries that vary with location are central to the modern description of physical interactions with the help of gauge theory. An important example of a gauge theory is the Standard Model, which describes three of the four known fundamental forces and classifies all known elementary particles.\nGeneralizations.\nMore general structures may be defined by relaxing some of the axioms defining a group. The table gives a list of several structures generalizing groups.\nFor example, if the requirement that every element has an inverse is eliminated, the resulting algebraic structure is called a monoid. The natural numbers formula_308 (including zero) under addition form a monoid, as do the nonzero integers under multiplication &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;. Adjoining inverses of all elements of the monoid formula_309 produces a group &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;, and likewise adjoining inverses to any (abelian) monoid &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak; produces a group known as the Grothendieck group of &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;.\nA group can be thought of as a small category with one object &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak; in which every morphism is an isomorphism: given such a category, the set formula_310 is a group; conversely, given a group &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;, one can build a small category with one object &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak; in which &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;.\nMore generally, a groupoid is any small category in which every morphism is an isomorphism.\nIn a groupoid, the set of all morphisms in the category is usually not a group, because the composition is only partially defined: &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak; is defined only when the source of &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak; matches the target of &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;.\nGroupoids arise in topology (for instance, the fundamental groupoid) and in the theory of stacks.\nFinally, it is possible to generalize any of these concepts by replacing the binary operation with an n-ary operation (i.e., an operation taking n arguments, for some nonnegative integer n). With the proper generalization of the group axioms, this gives a notion of n-ary group. \nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\nGeneral references.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSpecial references.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nHistorical references.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "19448", "revid": "698799", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19448", "title": "Marilyn Manson (band)", "text": "American rock band\nMarilyn Manson is an American rock band formed by namesake lead singer Marilyn Manson and guitarist Daisy Berkowitz in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, in 1989. Originally named Marilyn Manson &amp; the Spooky Kids, they gained a local cult following in South Florida in the early 1990s with their theatrical live performances. In 1993, they were the first act signed to Trent Reznor's Nothing Records label. Until 1996, the name of each member was created by combining the first name of a female sex symbol and the last name of a male serial for example, Marilyn Monroe and Charles Manson. Their lineup has changed between many of their album releases; the eponymous lead singer is the only remaining original member.\nIn the past, band members dressed in outlandish makeup and costumes, and engaged in intentionally shocking behavior both onstage and off. Their lyrics often received criticism for their anti-religious sentiment and references to sex, violence and drugs, while their live performances were frequently called offensive and obscene. On several occasions, protests and petitions led to the group being blocked from performing, with at least three US states passing legislation banning the group from performing at state-owned venues. They released a number of platinum-selling albums, including \"Antichrist Superstar\" (1996) and \"Mechanical Animals\" (1998). These albums, along with their highly stylized music videos and worldwide touring, brought public recognition to Marilyn Manson. In 1999, news media, infamously, falsely blamed the band for influencing the perpetrators of the Columbine High School massacre.\nAs this controversy began to wane throughout the 2000s, so did the band's mainstream popularity. Despite this, Jon Wiederhorn of MTV, in June 2003, referred to Marilyn Manson as \"the only true artist today\". Marilyn Manson is widely regarded as being one of the most iconic and controversial figures in rock music, with the band and its lead singer influencing numerous other groups and musicians, both in metal-associated acts and also in wider popular culture. VH1 ranked Marilyn Manson as the seventy-eighth best rock band on their \"100 Great Artists of Hard Rock\". They were inducted into the \"Kerrang!\" Hall of Fame in 2000 and have been nominated for four Grammy Awards. In the U.S., the band has seen ten of its releases debut in the top ten, including two number-one albums. Marilyn Manson have sold in excess of 50 million records worldwide.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:TOC limit/styles.css\" /&gt;\nHistory.\nFormation and The Spooky Kids (1989\u20131992).\nIn 1989, Brian Warner was a college student working towards a degree in journalism at Broward College, gaining experience by writing music articles for the South Florida lifestyle magazine \"25th Parallel\". It was in this capacity that he met several of the musicians to whom his own band would later be compared, including My Life with the Thrill Kill Kult and Trent Reznor of Nine Inch Nails. That December, he met Scott Putesky, who proposed the two form a band, after reading some lyrics and poems written by Warner. Warner, guitarist Putesky and bassist Brian Tutunick recorded their first demo tape as Marilyn Manson &amp; the Spooky Kids in 1990, taking on the stage names of Marilyn Manson, Daisy Berkowitz and Olivia Newton Bundy, respectively. Bundy left the band soon after, and was replaced by Gidget Gein, born Brad Stewart. They were later joined on keyboard by Stephen Bier, who called himself Madonna Wayne Gacy. In 1991, drummer Fred Streithorst joined the band under the name Sara Lee Lucas.\nThe stage names adopted by each member were representative of a concept the band considered central: the dichotomy of good and evil, and the existence of both, together, in every whole. \"Marilyn Monroe had a dark side\", explained Manson in his autobiography, \"just as Charles Manson has a good, intelligent side.\" Over the next six years, all of the band's members would adopt names that combined the first name of a female sex symbol and the surname of a serial killer. Images of both Monroe and Manson, as well as of other famous and infamous figures, were common in the band's early promotional materials.\nThe Spooky Kids' popularity in the area grew quickly and because of the band's highly visual concerts, which drew from performance art and used many shock techniques such as \"naked women nailed to a cross, a child in a cage, or bloody animal body parts.\" Band members variously performed in women's clothing or bizarre costumes; and, for lack of a professional pyrotechnician, would set their own stage props on fire. The band would contrast these theatrics with elements drawn from their youth: characters from 1970s and '80s children's television made regular, often grotesquely altered, appearances on band flyers and newsletters, and were frequently sampled in their music. They continued to perform and release cassettes \u2013 shortening their name to Marilyn Manson in 1992 \u2013 until the summer of 1993, when they drew the attention of Reznor, who had just founded his own label, Nothing Records.\n\"Portrait of an American Family\" and \"Smells Like Children\" (1993\u20131995).\nReznor offered the band a contract with the label, as well as an opening slot supporting Nine Inch Nails on their upcoming \"Self Destruct Tour\". After accepting both offers, recording sessions for their debut studio album began in July 1993 with Swans producer Roli Mosimann at Criteria Studios in Miami, Florida. Recording a selection of new songs along with material from their Spooky Kids repertoire, the first version of their debut, titled \"The Manson Family Album\", was completed by the end of the month. However, it was not well received. The band's members, along with Reznor, criticized Mosimann's production as being flat, lifeless and poorly representative of the band's live performances. At the same time, Gidget Gein had begun to lose control of his addiction to heroin. Before reworking the album, the band played two shows in Florida under the name Mrs. Scabtree. This band featured Manson on drums, Gacy on keyboard, Berkowitz on guitar, and Jessicka from Jack Off Jill sharing vocal duties with Jeordie White of Coral Springs thrash band Amboog-a-Lard. Four other local musicians, bassists Mark Dubin of Sister Venus and Patrick Joyce from The Itch, guitarist Miles Hie and violinist Mary Karlzen were also involved.\nReznor agreed to rework production of \"The Manson Family Album\" in October 1993 at Record Plant Studios in Los Angeles. Gein, who had been hospitalized after his fourth heroin overdose, was not invited to participate, and was fired from the band soon after, replaced by White, of Amboog-a-Lard, who undertook the alias Twiggy Ramirez. After seven weeks of mixing, re-recording and remixing, the album \u2013 now titled \"Portrait of an American Family\" \u2013 was presented to Nothing's parent label Interscope. The album was released on July 19, 1994, and peaked at number thirty-five on \"Billboard\"'s Top Heatseekers album chart. The band began its first national headlining tour in December 1994, with Jack Off Jill opening. During the band's stint as opening act on the Nine Inch Nails tour, Manson met Church of Satan founder Anton LaVey. LaVey bestowed the title of \"Reverend\" on Manson\u2013 meaning a person who is revered by the church, and not necessarily one who dedicates their life to preaching the religion to others, as with a priest or minister. Manson would use this title in the liner notes of the band's following album, citing himself as \"Reverend Marilyn Manson\".\nIn March 1995, the band began a two-month tour, this time with Monster Voodoo Machine as support. This would be drummer Sara Lee Lucas's last tour with the band. Kenneth Wilson, better known by his stage name Ginger Fish, then joined the group before they embarked on a tour with rock band Danzig and metal band Korn. The band then relocated to the new home of Nothing Studios in New Orleans to begin work on remixes and b-sides for \"Portrait\"'s third single, \"Dope Hat\", releasing a music video inspired by the boat ride scene from the 1971 movie \"Willy Wonka &amp; the Chocolate Factory\". The proposed single eventually developed into \"Smells Like Children\", which included the band's version of the Eurythmics' \"Sweet Dreams (Are Made of This)\", their first hit; the song's music video was placed in heavy rotation on MTV, in stark contrast with the \"Dope Hat\" video, which the same channel had banished to late-night airplay only a few months prior.\n\"Antichrist Superstar\" (1996\u20131997).\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\nThis is perhaps the sickest group ever promoted by a mainstream record company.\n\u2014Former U.S. Senator Joe Lieberman\nThe band's second studio album, \"Antichrist Superstar\", was released on October 8, 1996. It was recorded at Nothing Studios with Reznor, Manson, Sean Beavan and former Skinny Puppy member and longtime producer Dave Ogilvie sharing co-production duties; members of both Marilyn Manson and Nine Inch Nails took part in its recording. The process of making the album was a long and difficult one, highlighted by experiments involving sleep deprivation and near-constant drug use, in an effort to create a violent and hostile environment suited to the album's content. During this time, antagonism between band members was high. Daisy Berkowitz, the band's founding guitarist, departed the band partway through the album's recording process, with Twiggy performing much of the album's guitar work. Timothy Linton responded to an advert seeking Berkowitz's replacement. He would form a close relationship with Madonna Wayne Gacy, who was responsible for the inclusion of one of the major sources of inspiration for the album: Kabbalah. Breaking with the six-year tradition of naming band members after female icons and serial killers, Zim Zum was chosen as Linton's stage name. It was derived from the Lurianic Kabbalah concept of Tzimtzum. \"The Beautiful People\" was released as the album's lead single. It created enough anticipation for \"Antichrist Superstar\" that the album debuted at number three on the \"Billboard\" 200 with first-week sales of 132,000 copies. Manson also appeared on the cover of \"Rolling Stone\", who awarded the band their 'Best New Artist' accolade in 1997. The year-long \"Dead to the World Tour\" followed, which was the band's longest and widest-ranging tour yet. In the US, however, the band was receiving more attention than ever before, and not all of it was positive. As the tour was getting underway, the band found itself the target of bipartisan congressional hearings, led by conservative violent entertainment watchdog group Empower America (now known as FreedomWorks) co-directors Republican Secretary of Education William Bennett and Democratic U.S. Senator Joseph Lieberman, to determine the effects, if any, of violent lyrics on young listeners. In addition, nearly every performance of the tour was picketed by religious organizations.\nIn July 1997, Manson collaborated with British trip hop group Sneaker Pimps for the single \"Long Hard Road Out of Hell\" from the soundtrack to the 1997 film \"Spawn\". The band released their second EP, \"Remix &amp; Repent\", on November 25, 1997. It featured new versions of \"Antichrist Superstar\"'s four singles: \"The Beautiful People\", \"Tourniquet\", \"Antichrist Superstar\" and \"Man That You Fear\". In February 1998, Manson released his autobiography, \"The Long Hard Road Out of Hell\", as well as a live video entitled \"Dead to the World\". It was also confirmed that \"Antichrist Superstar\" would be the first installment in a concept album trilogy which the band called their triptych.\n\"Mechanical Animals\" (1998\u20131999).\nThe band released the second part of their triptych, \"Mechanical Animals\", on September 15, 1998. Co-produced by the band's lead singer with Sean Beavan and Michael Beinhorn, the album moved away from the industrial rock production of its predecessor and was strongly influenced by 1970s glam rock, particularly David Bowie's 1974 album \"Diamond Dogs\". Billy Corgan served as an unofficial consultant to the band during the early development of the album. After playing a few songs for him, Corgan advised them that \"This is definitely the right direction\" but to \"go all the way with it. Don't just hint at it\", referring to its inclusion of glam influences. To suit their new musical style, the band also recast itself as a glam rock outfit, setting aside the \"rotting-corpse chic\" of the previous era in favor of attire more suited to the genre, incorporating leather, platform boots and brightly dyed hair. The band also relocated from New Orleans to Los Angeles, while Zim Zum was replaced by guitarist John Lowery of 2wo, whose stage name, John 5, was given to him by Manson during their first lunch meeting.\nInterscope's promotion of the album was massive, with the label erecting enormous billboards of the lead singer as an androgynous extraterrestrial in both Times Square and Sunset Strip. Repeated appearances on MTV and other networks helped propel the album's lead single, \"The Dope Show\", to number twelve on Billboard's Mainstream Rock chart, becoming the band's highest-charting single yet. The song's music video was critically acclaimed, winning two awards at the 1998 \"Billboard\" Music Video Awards as well as the Best Cinematography award at the 1999 MTV VMA's; while the song was also nominated for Best Hard Rock Performance at the 41st Annual Grammy Awards. The album would go on to debut at number one on the \"Billboard\" 200, with first week sales of over 223,000.\nAfter a brief promotional campaign, the band set out on the \"Beautiful Monsters Tour\" with Hole. The tour would be a problematic one, and was marred by frequent on\u2013and\u2013off stage exchanges between Manson and Hole vocalist Courtney Love. Private disputes also arose over the tour's financial arrangements, with Hole unwittingly financing most of Manson's production costs, which were disproportionately high relative to Hole's. The tour was to include thirty-seven shows spanning over a two-month period, although Hole left after taking part in just nine of the scheduled dates. A broken ankle from Manson also forced the postponement of the next two shows, with the remainder of the tour being renamed \"Rock Is Dead\" and Jack Off Jill and Nashville Pussy taking over select opening slots.\nThe final four dates of the tour were canceled out of respect for the victims of the Columbine High School massacre. The latter half of 1999 and much of 2000 was a period of relative silence for the band, who refused to take part in interviews and retreated from public life. They shelved plans for a proposed single and music video for their cover of AC/DC's \"Highway to Hell\", which appeared on the soundtrack to \"Detroit Rock City\". They spent this period writing and recording in a secluded studio in Death Valley, with only the live album \"The Last Tour on Earth\" appearing during this time. A studio outtake from \"Antichrist Superstar\", titled \"Astonishing Panorama of the Endtimes\", served as its only single.\n\"Holy Wood (In the Shadow of the Valley of Death)\" (2000\u20132001).\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\n1999 was a pivotal year\u2014as was 1969, the year of my birth. The two years share many similarities. Woodstock '99 became an Altamont of its own. Columbine became the Manson murders of our generation. Things happened that could've made me want to stop making music. Instead, I decided to come out and really punish everyone for daring to fuck with me. I've got a big fight ahead of me on this one. And I want every bit of it. \n\u2014Marilyn Manson\n\"Holy Wood (In the Shadow of the Valley of Death)\" was released on November 11, 2000. Produced by the band's lead singer with Dave Sardy, the album also features programming and pre-production editing by Bon Harris of Nitzer Ebb. The band wrote over 100 songs for the album, which was a return to the darker, more abrasive sound of \"Antichrist Superstar\". Much of its content was written in response to the Columbine massacre, with the album's third single, \"The Nobodies\", directly referring to the shootings. Described by the band's frontman as the third part of a trilogy which began with \"Antichrist Superstar\" and continued in \"Mechanical Animals\", its overarching theme is an exploration of the relationship between death and fame in American culture, and its lyrics and artwork contain many references to John F. Kennedy and Lee Harvey Oswald, John Lennon and Mark David Chapman, and Abraham Lincoln and John Wilkes Booth. The \"Guns, God and Government Tour\" elaborated on \"Holy Wood\"'s central theme, and with its logo \u2013 a rifle and handguns arranged to resemble the Christian cross \u2013 Manson made no attempt to conceal what he saw as the source of that fascination.\nThe band also revealed that within their concept album trilogy, \"Holy Wood\" serves as prequel to \"Mechanical Animals\" and \"Antichrist Superstar\" despite the latter two preceding \"Holy Wood\" in release date. Each album contains its own distinct storyline, which can be linked together to create a larger overarching storyline encompassing all three. Manson has offered this much in the way of an interpretation: \"[\"Holy Wood\" is about] wanting to fit into a world that didn't want me, and fighting really hard to get there. [The album's deepest elements] are idealism and the desire to start a revolution. If you begin with \"Holy Wood\", then \"Mechanical Animals\" really talks about how that revolution gets taken away from you and turned into a product, and then \"Antichrist Superstar\" is where you're given a choice to decide if you're going to be controlled by the power that you created or if you want to destroy yourself and then start over. It just becomes a cycle.\"\nThe band initially declined to join the 2001 lineup of Ozzy Osbourne's Ozzfest, as its June 21 date in Denver would mark their first appearance in Colorado since the Columbine massacre. After the band announced on their website that they would perform in Denver, they were protested by religious groups. The band planned to \"balance out\" their \"violent lyrics\" by quoting biblical texts, \"so we can examine the virtues of wonderful Christian stories of disease, murder, adultery, suicide and child sacrifice.\" The tour was documented by a DVD of the same name, which was released on October 29, 2002. In addition to a compilation style concert [songs from multiple individual shows edited together to appear as a single performance], it includes a thirty-minute short film titled \"The Death Parade\". This was followed by \"Guns, God and Government \u2013 Live in LA\" in 2009, which depicts their performance of January 13, 2001, at Los Angeles's Grand Olympic Auditorium in its entirety.\nEarlier in 2001, the band released a cover of Gloria Jones's \"Tainted Love\" on the soundtrack to \"Not Another Teen Movie\". The song became the band's biggest international hit yet, peaking at number one in numerous European territories. In 2002, Jonathan Davis of Korn invited Marilyn Manson to record vocals on a track titled \"Redeemer\", which was released on his to \"Queen of the Damned\". Manson also appeared in Michael Moore's 2002 documentary, \"Bowling for Columbine\"; his appearance was filmed on the same day as their Denver Ozzfest performance. When Moore asked what Manson would have said to the students at Columbine, he replied, \"I wouldn't say a single word to them. I would listen to what they have to say, and that's what no one did.\"\n\"The Golden Age of Grotesque\" and \"Lest We Forget\" (2002\u20132006).\nWith the \"triptych\" of previous albums complete, the band was free to begin a fresh project. In 2002, Manson created an original score for the \"Resident Evil\" film with former KMFDM multi-instrumentalist Tim Skold. Soon after, Skold became an official band member when Twiggy Ramirez amicably left the group, citing creative differences. After finding inspiration through Manson's girlfriend Dita Von Teese in the swing and burlesque movements of 1920s Berlin, the band recorded \"The Golden Age of Grotesque\", which was released on May 13, 2003, and debuted atop the \"Billboard\" 200 album chart, selling over 118,000 copies on its first week. It was also an international success, particularly in Europe, where it sold over 400,000 copies on its first week, and topping various national record charts, as well as \"Billboard\"'s European Albums Chart. The album also appeared on several critics' year-end lists, and won a 2003 Metal Edge Readers' Choice Award for \"Album of the Year\".\nEschewing the lyrical depth and symbolism found on \"Holy Wood\", the album was relatively straightforward: in an extended metaphor, Manson compares his own often-criticized work to the \"Entartete Kunst\" banned by the Nazi regime. Lyrically, Manson utilizes the narrative mode of stream of consciousness throughout the album to examine the human psyche in times of crisis, specifically focusing on the mindset of lunatics and children, as, according to Manson, \"they don't follow the rules [of society].\" Several songs incorporate elements commonly found in playground chants and nursery rhymes, which Manson would \"pervert into something ugly and lurid.\" The work of Kurt Weill was also noted as an influence, along with the lucid dreams the singer was having during its production, with Manson explaining that he would \"wake up and say, 'I want to write a song that sounds like a stampeding elephant,' or 'I want to write a song that sounds like a burning piano.'\"\nManson began his long-term collaboration with Austrian-Irish artist Gottfried Helnwein, working together on several multi-media projects associated with the album, including the exhibitions and installation art projects featured at the album's launch party at The Key Club in Los Angeles, the album artwork, the music video to lead single \"mOBSCENE\", as well as the artwork which accompanied Manson's essay for The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum. Limited edition copies of the album included a DVD titled \"Doppelherz\" (Double-heart), a 25-minute surrealist short film directed by Manson which featured art direction by Helnwein. Another world tour followed, \"Grotesk Burlesk\", which furthered the album's Weimar Republic-inspired theme by adding Helnwein-created stage dressing and elements of German \"Kabarett\" to the group's performances. Manson and the band members began appearing both on-and off-stage in designer suits created by Jean-Paul Gaultier.\n\"\" was released on September 28, 2004, and was referred to by Manson as a \"farewell\" compilation. It was the last album released under Nothing Records, as the label was dissolved following a lawsuit filed by Reznor against his former manager and business partner, John Malm. The compilation was supported by the \"Against All Gods Tour\", as well as a single\u2013a cover of Depeche Mode's \"Personal Jesus\". It was the first and only tour to feature Mark Chaussee of Rob Halford's Fight on lead guitar, replacing John 5, whose relationship with Manson had soured over the previous year. Former Nine Inch Nails drummer Chris Vrenna also replaced Ginger Fish, who fractured his wrist, skull and cheekbone after falling several feet off his drum riser during a performance at a German awards ceremony.\n\"Eat Me, Drink Me\" (2007\u20132008).\nBy late 2005, the band had composed 18 new songs, but work on their sixth studio album was halted when Manson focused his attention on various film and art projects, including the development of his screenplay, ', as well as a minor role in the Lucy Liu movie '. He also launched a self-proclaimed art movement, the Celebritarian Corporation, which included artist Gottfried Helnwein, fashion designer Steven Klein and director Anthony Silva, as well as announcing plans to open an art gallery and publish a book of his paintings. It was after opening the Celebritarian Corporation Gallery Of Fine Art on Melrose Avenue in 2006 that work started on new material, with Manson writing lyrics over Skold's already existing compositions.\nThe resulting material was composed and recorded entirely by Skold, and does not feature writing or performance contributions from any other member of the band. Its content is largely inspired by personal troubles relating to Manson's failed marriage to Von Teese, and his burgeoning relationship with then-19-year old actress Evan Rachel Wood. The band made their debut appearance on \"The Tonight Show with Jay Leno\" on October 31, 2006, performing their cover of \"This Is Halloween\" from a deluxe edition re-release of \"The Nightmare Before Christmas\" soundtrack. This would be their last performance featuring longtime keyboardist Madonna Wayne Gacy, who would go on to file a $20m lawsuit against the band the following year for unpaid \"partnership proceeds\".\nThe album was preceded by the release of a single, \"Heart-Shaped Glasses (When the Heart Guides the Hand)\", whose music video was shot using director James Cameron's 3D Fusion Camera System technology. The video caused controversy upon release, with several sources claiming that it featured genuine footage of Manson and Wood engaged in sexual intercourse. Wood was reportedly paid \"the highest [music] video salary in history\" to appear in the video. \"Eat Me, Drink Me\" was released on June 5, 2007, and entered the \"Billboard\" 200 at number eight with first week sales of 88,000 copies. It also peaked in the top ten of most major international album charts, as well as at number two on \"Billboard\"'s European Albums Chart. \"Putting Holes in Happiness\" was released as the album's second single.\nTo promote the album, the band embarked on the nine-month \"Rape of the World Tour\", which featured Skold on lead guitar, former The Prodigy bassist Rob Holliday and longtime drummer Ginger Fish; while Vrenna rejoined the band as their live keyboardist. The first leg of the tour was a co-headlining set with American thrash metal band Slayer, with support coming from Bleeding Through. In November 2007, Manson confirmed that he and Skold had begun work on the band's next studio album, with Slayer's Kerry King, former The Smashing Pumpkins guitarist James Iha and Nick Zinner of Yeah Yeah Yeahs set to feature. By the beginning of 2008, however, Twiggy Ramirez had rejoined the band as bassist, resulting in the exit of Skold, with Holliday moving from bass to lead guitar for the remaining duration of the tour. Future collaborations with Skold were not ruled out.\n\"The High End of Low\" (2009\u20132010).\nIn 2008, former Limp Bizkit guitarist Wes Borland joined the band for their headlining show at the 2008 ETP Fest in South Korea. However, Borland left the group to reunite with Limp Bizkit, later saying that he was reluctant to be a \"hired gun\", citing the band's refusal to record any of the nine songs he submitted for their upcoming album. R&amp;B singer Ne-Yo claimed in early December that he would hold writing sessions with the band's frontman on new material, although Manson denied it, saying that he had \"never even met Ne-Yo. I can assure him that he would not want to be associated with something this godless.\"\n\"The High End of Low\" was recorded throughout 2008, with Manson recording vocals at his Hollywood Hills home studio between November and January 5, 2009. Produced by Manson, Twiggy and Vrenna with \"Antichrist Superstar\" and \"Mechanical Animals\" co-producer Sean Beavan, Manson described the album as containing \"extreme\" autobiographical content relating to the dissolution of his engagement to Wood, and as being \"very ruthless, heavy and violent\". Its fifteen songs appear on the album in the order they were written. The penultimate track, \"Into the Fire\", portrays the vocalist's mental state on Christmas Day, wherein he attempted to contact Wood 158 times, cutting himself with a razorblade on the face or hands for each corresponding attempt. The album's final song, \"15\", was completed on Manson's January 5 birthday \u2013 hence the name. Manson utilized his entire home as a canvas to document the disintegration of the relationship, writing its lyrics on walls and coupling them with paintings and drawings relating to Wood, as well as used condoms, bags of cocaine and other drug paraphernalia.\n\"We're from America\" was released as a free download on the band's website on March 27, 2009, while a Hot Topic-exclusive CD single followed two weeks later. After playing an instrumental version of \"Arma-goddamn-motherfuckin-geddon\" to Interscope's A&amp;R department, it was chosen as the album's official lead single, with an employee telling Manson, \"This is gonna be a hit!\". Manson then quipped to the employee, \"Well, I'm glad that you have no consideration for what I [might] put on top of it.\" A heavily censored version of the profanity-laced track \u2013 re-titled to \"Arma ... geddon\" \u2013 was serviced to radio from April 13, and peaked at number thirty-seven on \"Billboard\"'s Mainstream Rock chart, becoming their lowest-peaking single in the process. The album was released on May 20, 2009 and debuted at number four on the \"Billboard\" 200 with sales of over 49,000 copies, their lowest opening week figure since \"The Last Tour on Earth\" debuted with 26,000 copies in 1999.\nPrior to \"The High End of Lows release, Manson made a series of disparaging comments regarding Interscope and its artistic censorship; as well as its then-CEO Jimmy Iovine, who Manson said \"wasn't smart enough to understand what [we] do\", and publicly claiming that the label \"cares more about Vitamin Water [the private equity venture of Interscope-signed 50 Cent] than music.\" Reznor \u2013 who, as of 2015, remains friends with Iovine \u2013 responded by calling Manson a \"dopey clown\" and claiming that \"He is a malicious guy and will step on anybody's face to succeed and cross any line of decency.\" While promoting the album in the UK, Manson appeared inebriated in a series of interviews. An interview for ' recorded during this time remains unaired, due to graphic language and content. A music video for \"Running to the Edge of the World\" \u2013 in which Manson beats a Wood lookalike to death \u2013 was released on November 4 and was condemned as a perceived glorification of violence against women. The band parted ways with Interscope on December 3. They settled the lawsuit filed by former keyboardist Stephen Bier (aka M.W. Gacy), with Manson's insurance company paying Bier's attorney's fees and Bier receiving no monetary value.\n\"Born Villain\" (2011\u20132013).\nUpon parting with Interscope, Manson said \"a lot of the creative control on which my hands were tied [has been regained]\", while stating that the band had been writing new material while touring their previous album. Manson attested that its lyrical content would be \"more romantic\" yet \"self-abusive\", and described its sonic elements as being \"suicide death metal\". Fred Sablan joined the band in July 2010. By October, Twiggy described the album as being \"almost done\", and opined that \"It's our best record yet. I mean, everyone always says that, but I think this is our best work so far. It's kind of like a little more of a punk rock \"Mechanical Animals\", without sounding too pretentious.\" The following month, it was announced that the band had signed a joint-venture deal with London-based indie label Cooking Vinyl. As part of the deal, the band would retain creative control over their artistic direction, with the band and label sharing profits equally after the label recoups costs associated with marketing, promotion and distribution.\nFor much of 2011, Manson removed himself from the public spotlight and ceased almost all communication with fans, only taking a break from his self-imposed sequestration to appear in the music video for \"Tempat Ku\" by Brunei rock band D'Hask. On February 24, longtime drummer Ginger Fish announced his resignation from the group. On May 22, their website underwent a complete overhaul. A 26-second clip of an unreleased song, tentatively titled \"I am among no one\", was uploaded to their Vimeo account, along with a new logo.\nAfter being impressed by his directorial work on one of Kid Cudi's music videos, Manson employed actor Shia LaBeouf to direct a short film entitled \"Born Villain\". Contrary to media reports that the project would be a \"making-of\" video documenting the album's recording, \"Born Villain\" was a surrealist short featuring a previously unreleased track, \"Overneath the Path of Misery\". Containing numerous references to \"Macbeth\", it was inspired by Jodorowsky's \"The Holy Mountain\" and Luis Bu\u00f1uel and Salvador Dal\u00ed's 1929 silent film \"Un Chien Andalou\". To promote the project, LaBeouf and his girlfriend, photographer Karolyn Pho, graffitied areas of LA with its artwork. LaBeouf and Pho later photographed their work, and released it as a limited edition book titled \"Campaign\", which was bundled with a DVD of the film. In November, Vrenna departed the band to focus on other production work, whilst indicating that production of their eighth studio album was \"largely completed\".\nThe album was preceded by the release of \"No Reflection\", which Manson leaked to KROQ-FM on March 7, 2012. Cooking Vinyl CEO Martin Goldschmidt called the leak a \"masterstroke\", saying \"we had all these exclusives lined up around the world, and then Manson blew them all. We're already getting more radio play than the whole of the last record.\" The song went on to peak at number twenty-six on the Mainstream Rock chart, spending fourteen weeks on the chart, and was their best-performing single there since \"Personal Jesus\" in 2004. \"Born Villain\" was released worldwide from April 25, debuting at number ten on the \"Billboard\" 200 and atop both the Independent Albums and Top Hard Rock Albums charts. The album spent two weeks at number one on the UK Rock Albums Chart. A remix EP for \"Slo-Mo-Tion\" followed on November 5. The band embarked on the seventeen-month \"Hey Cruel World... Tour\" from the end of April, which was interspersed by co-headlining tours with Rob Zombie (\"Twins of Evil\") and Alice Cooper (\"Masters of Madness\").\n\"The Pale Emperor\" (2014\u20132016).\nIn August 2012, it was announced that Manson would play a fictionalized version of himself in a four-episode arc of the sixth season of TV series \"Californication\". While filming its season finale at the Greek Theatre in LA, Manson met the series' composer, Tyler Bates, and the two discussed a potential collaboration. Manson confirmed that production started on new material by May 2013. Four months later, Sablan announced that he had left the group.\nOne track from the album, \"Cupid Carries a Gun\" was used as the opening theme to \"Salem\" from its second episode onwards, which premiered on US television on April 27. In October, a large portion of the album track \"Killing Strangers\" was predominantly featured in the Keanu Reeves movie \"John Wick\". \"Third Day of a Seven Day Binge\" was released for free download on the band's website on October 26, and served as the album's first official single. The band performed several new songs live for the first time as they played a handful of concerts around southern California in October and early November. \"Deep Six\" was released on December 16, with a music video following three days later. It went on to peak at number eight on \"Billboard\"'s Mainstream Rock chart, making it the band's highest-ever peaking single on \"Billboard\". \"Cupid Carries a Gun\" was released as the album's third official single on January 8, 2015.\n\"The Pale Emperor\" was released on January 15 in the US. It is dedicated to Manson's mother, who died in May 2014 after an eight-year battle with Alzheimer's disease and dementia. It was both a critical and commercial success, debuting at number eight on the \"Billboard\" 200 with sales of over 51,000 copies, their largest opening-week figure since \"Eat Me, Drink Me\" in 2007. Numerous publications referred to it as the band's best album in over a decade. It would go on to appear on several 'best of 2015' lists, with \"Rolling Stone\" dubbing it the 'best metal album' of 2015. Music videos for both \"The Mephistopheles of Los Angeles\" and \"Third Day of a Seven Day Binge\" were released in May and July, respectively.\nThe band embarked on the nearly-two year-long The Hell Not Hallelujah Tour in support of the album, which was interspersed by a co-headlining tour with The Smashing Pumpkins titled The End Times. In February 2016, Manson contributed vocals to a version of David Bowie's \"Cat People (Putting Out Fire)\" on \"Countach (For Giorgio)\", a tribute album to Giorgio Moroder curated by Shooter Jennings. A 16-bit music video for the song was released five months later. Also in February, details were announced of another co-headlining tour, this time with Slipknot. The tour was scheduled to begin on June 9 in Salt Lake City and consist of thirty-four dates in Amphitheatres throughout North America, with support from Of Mice &amp; Men. However, the first twelve dates of the tour were postponed after an examination revealed that Corey Taylor had broken two vertebrae in his neck. The tour began on June 28 in Nashville, Tennessee, with the postponed shows rescheduled for August.\n\"Heaven Upside Down\" (2017\u20132018).\nWhile touring with The Smashing Pumpkins, Manson indicated a \"strong possibility\" of working with Corgan on new material, and also revealed plans to collaborate with Korn frontman Jonathan Davis on a \"Southern-sounding, acoustic\" project. Manson announced in an interview with KEGL in November that work had begun on the band's tenth studio album, while also confirming that Twiggy, Bates and Sharone would all be involved in its recording. \"Antichrist Superstar\" was reissued on cassette exclusively in Europe as part of Record Store Day 2016. To celebrate the twentieth anniversary of the album's release, Manson indicated that a special edition of \"Antichrist Superstar\" would be issued on October 20, although this failed to materialize. Among its bonus content would have been a previously unreleased film, created during the \"Dead to the World Tour\".\nOn July 19, Manson announced that the band's tenth studio album had the working title \"SAY10\", and predicted a release date of Valentine's Day 2017. In September, Manson confirmed that the band were \"putting the finishing touches\" on the album, and said: \"It's not very much in any way like \"The Pale Emperor\". It's pretty violent in its nature for some reason, and it's not emotional in the same way. It's got a chip on its shoulder. I can't wait for people to hear it. I think they're going to be quite surprised.\" On November 8 \u2013 the day of the 2016 US presidential election \u2013 Manson released a teaser clip of a new music video created alongside \"Final Girl\" director Tyler Shields. It featured scenes of Manson brandishing a knife while standing over a decapitated corpse. According to \"The Daily Beast\"'s Marlow Stern, the decapitated figure is dressed to resemble Donald Trump. Manson would later say that the figure in the video \"wasn't anyone except if you wanted it to be them.\"\nThe album was not released in February 2017, and instead a long series of cryptic videos were posted to Marilyn Manson's personal Instagram account over the course of just under 2 months, before Manson revealed on May 9 that the album had been named \"Heaven Upside Down\". The band began their Heaven Upside Down Tour on July 20, 2017, in Budapest. The first single from the album, \"We Know Where You Fucking Live\", was released on September 11, with the album due to follow on October 6. A second single, \"Kill4Me\", was released on September 20. The band's founding guitarist, Daisy Berkowitz, died on October 22, 2017, at the age of 49; he had been diagnosed with Stage IV colorectal cancer in 2013. Two days later, Manson announced he had \"decided to part ways\" with bassist Twiggy, after a rape allegation was made against Twiggy by his former girlfriend, Jack Off Jill vocalist Jessicka; for the rest of the tour, Juan Alderete (formerly of Racer X and The Mars Volta) joined. In July 2018, Manson embarked on the in the US with co-headliner Rob Zombie and special guest Deadly Apples.\n\"We Are Chaos\" (2019\u20132023).\nIn March 2019, Manson announced that he was nearly finished recording his next studio album and that country musician Shooter Jennings was involved. Later that year, drummer Gil Sharone announced he was leaving the band to pursue \"other current and future projects\", with former Black Flag drummer Brandon Pertzborn hired as his replacement. Manson also revealed that Bates is no longer involved with the group, and that the album would be produced by Jennings and feature contributions from his drummer Jamie Douglass. In July, Manson embarked on the in the US and Canada with co-headliner Rob Zombie, followed by festivals and headline dates with support from Deadly Apples. The band released their cover of The Doors' \"The End\" on streaming music services in November, with a limited edition vinyl scheduled to be issued on March 6, 2020. The song was recorded for the soundtrack to the upcoming miniseries \"The Stand\", based on Stephen King's novel of the same name. Manson is set to appear in the miniseries. The band are set to appear as the opening act for Ozzy Osbourne during his No More Tours II series, a North American tour beginning in May 2020. However the tour was eventually cancelled along with Manson's performances after Ozzy Osbourne was diagnosed with Parkinson's disease.\nOn January 13, 2020, live bassist Juan Alderete (ex-Racer X) was involved in a bicycle accident which left him with a diffuse axonal injury, a type of traumatic brain injury. A GoFundMe page has been created to help cover the cost of his medical expenses. On April 29, Manson and Jennings confirmed they had finished work on the band's eleventh studio album, with both calling it a \"masterpiece\". On July 28, Manson announced that a new single titled \"We Are Chaos\" would be released the following day. The next day, the track was released alongside the announcement of the band's upcoming eleventh studio album titled \"We Are Chaos\" set for release on September 11, 2020. At the same time, the band revealed the album cover and the track list. The album debuted at number eight on the \"Billboard\" 200, making it their tenth top ten release on the chart.\nIn February 2021, Loma Vista Recordings announced they would not promote or participate in the distribution of any future recordings released by the band, following former girlfriend Evan Rachel Wood and various other accusations that the band's vocalist sexually and psychologically abused them. In November 2021, former band member Tim Skold announced he was again working on new material with Marilyn Manson. In May 2023, Marilyn Manson became active again on social media, posting two new pictures and announcing that there's \"something new for you to hear\".\n\"One Assassination Under God \u2013 Chapter 1\" (2024\u2013present).\nIn March 2024, it was announced the band would embark on an arena and amphitheater tour of North America with Five Finger Death Punch. The tour began on August 2, and was interspersed with the band's own headlining shows. The same day the tour began, the band released \"As Sick as the Secrets Within\", their first new single in four years. This was followed two weeks later by another new song, \"Raise the Red Flag\". Music videos were released for each song, which were both directed by Bill Yukich. \"Sacrilegious\" was released in September. The band's twelfth studio album, \"One Assassination Under God \u2013 Chapter 1\", was released on November 22, 2024. They began their own headline tour of Europe in February 2025, with a U.S. tour scheduled to begin in May.\nMusical style.\nAlthough the band's music has often been labeled as shock rock by mainstream media, Manson disputes the use of the label, preferring instead to identify his band's music as rock and roll. The band combined industrial, goth, shock rock and metal into a \"creative bricolage\". AllMusic's Stephen Thomas Erlewine wrote that the band \"draws equally from schlock metal, progressive metal, new wave, goth rock, and industrial rock\". AllMusic also described the band's music as \"glam-influenced industrial metal\".\"The Daily Texan\" wrote that the band \"originally found success during the rise and popularity of nu metal\", but \"Manson distanced himself from that movement, preferring alternative metal anguish over cookie monster-sounding raps.\" According to \"The Evolution of Goth Culture\", the goth subculture \"resisted this takeover of the goth name by Marilyn Manson and their fans\" initially, but the band's music would eventually be identified as being goth rock and industrial metal, even though Manson himself has been reluctant to \"pigeonhole\" his band as goth or metal. \"Rolling Stone\" described the band's music as \"heavy, industrialized goth rock\", while AllMusic contends that the band merely borrows from gothic rock's imagery. \"Consequence of Sound\" wrote that \"gothic darkness and industrial rock [pervades] all of\" the band's music. \"Stereogum\" wrote that \"metal has never been an integral part of Manson\u2019s sound\" and although the band utilizes \"varying degrees [of] gritty, distorted guitar\", the magazine suggested that the core of their music was actually pop music.\nFrom 1996 to his departure in 2002, Twiggy Ramirez was their chief musical contributor, co-writing many of the band's biggest hits with Manson during this period. Despite never receiving a writing credit, drummer Ginger Fish provided substantial pre-production assistance to both Manson and Twiggy while composing demos for \"Antichrist Superstar\". His drums loops and sound effects would go on to be predominantly featured on several tracks, most notably \"The Beautiful People\". John 5 and Tim Skold were also prevalent composers, while \"The Pale Emperor\" and \"Heaven Upside Down\" were composed entirely by Tyler Bates, who joined the band in 2014. Twiggy introduced Manson and musician Shooter Jennings to each other in 2013. Seven years later, the two wrote, recorded and produced \"We Are Chaos\" together. Bates returned to his role as composer on the following album, \"One Assassination Under God \u2013 Chapter 1\".\nAll of the band's lyrics are written by Manson, whose songwriting style varies between albums. Utilizing aesthetics often found within spoken-word poetry, his writing features comedy, puns, and double entendres, and he makes frequent use of alliteration. The band's witticisms often take the form of neologisms, delivered several at a time in rapid-fire succession. Lyrical content has emerged from a wide range of subjects, including love, sex and sexuality, sexual abuse, rape, consumerism, politics, revenge, suicide, capitalism, violence and mortality, as well as the Bible and Greek mythology.\nManson predominantly delivers lyrics in a melodic fashion, although he invariably enhances his vocal register by utilizing several extended vocal techniques, such as vocal fry, screaming, growling and crooning. His voice can emit five different tones simultaneously, which mixing engineer Robert Carranza discovered can form a pentagram when imported into a phrasal analyzer. He possesses a baritone vocal type. His lowest bass note of A1 can be heard in \"Arma-goddamn-motherfuckin-geddon\", while his highest note, an E6 \u2013 the first note of the whistle register \u2013 can be heard on the \"Born Villain\" song \"Hey, Cruel World ...\".\nInfluences.\nManson's earliest musical memory was listening to Kiss during a family road trip; he has since cited the band as a major influence. As a child, he would imitate Kiss's \"kabuki\"-like makeup and draw pictures of Gene Simmons and Peter Criss. The earliest incarnation of the band was conceived by Manson at a Fort Lauderdale nightclub called The Reunion Room in December 1989, where he was introduced to Big Black's \"Songs About Fucking\" by his future keyboardist, Stephen Bier. Daisy Berkowitz played in several punk rock outfits before co-founding the Spooky Kids, and was influenced by acts such as the New York Dolls and the Jim Carroll Band, whose \"People Who Died\" was covered regularly at live shows.\nAs its only permanent member, Manson heads the direction of the band's sound; he has been influenced by the shock rock of artists such as Arthur Brown, Alice Cooper, The Doors, Ozzy Osbourne and Iggy Pop. His biggest influence, however, was David Bowie, whom he credited with \"changing [his] life forever\". The two have often been compared by mainstream media, particularly in relation to their ability to shift genre and style \u2013 replete with a new look and musical philosophy \u2013 with each studio release. Manson's two favorite songs are Bowie's \"Quicksand\" and \"Ashes to Ashes\". For several years, Manson sang Bowie's \"Cat People (Putting Out Fire)\" as a vocal warm up exercise before live performances; he later covered the song with musician Shooter Jennings.\nDuring their period at Nothing Records, the band's sound gathered sonic elements from other outfits on that label's roster, particularly Nine Inch Nails, with Reznor co-producing their first two studio albums. Manson has cited Queen as an influence on the band's more melodic work, while new wave and synthpop acts such as Depeche Mode and Gary Numan have been noted as influencing their electronic material. Manson said of the latter, \"I was always into his apocalyptic fiction lyrics. He pioneered electronic dance music.\" The work of gothic rock acts such as The Cure and Bauhaus has also been cited, with Twiggy saying that \"as far as guitar and bass combinations go\", Bauhaus's Daniel Ash and David J were \"a really big influence\". Manson's other influences include The Beatles, Rihanna, Madonna, Prince, White Zombie, Johnny Cash, Jimi Hendrix, N.W.A, The Smashing Pumpkins, Justin Timberlake, Ministry, Led Zeppelin, the occult, horror comics, and the King James Bible.\nImpact and legacy.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\nIt's clear Manson isn't merely a freak rocker, media manipulator or one-trick pony. The secret to his longevity lies not in his sometimes schlocky image, but in the content of his work. Not only are his songs sonically compelling and his themes fresh and intriguing, but his actions speak louder than his words. His imagery, sounds and theatrics all still have a point, and like all true artists, he continues to wring significant messages from the lining of his contorted innards. Manson doesn't just bleed for his art. He drinks, pukes, fornicates and risks his life for it.\n\u2014Jon Wiederhorn of MTV on Marilyn Manson, 2003 \nMarilyn Manson have been credited with creating some of the most recognizable and visually defining music videos of the MTV Generation, with some commentators suggesting that their music videos played a significant role in the band's commercial success. Their work frequently incorporates surrealist iconography and purposefully grotesque imagery, and their style has been emulated by other performers. Joseph Schafer of \"Stereogum\" said in 2015 that \"perhaps no single artist has mastered the music video as a medium so well [as Marilyn Manson].\" They have received numerous awards and accolades for their work. Three of their videos \u2013 \"Sweet Dreams (Are Made of This)\", \"The Beautiful People\" and \"The Dope Show\" \u2013 received a total of five MTV Video Music Award nominations, with the latter winning the Award for Best Cinematography at the 1999 ceremony. The clip for \"The Dope Show\" also won two awards at the 1998 \"Billboard\" Music Video Awards. \"The Beautiful People\" appeared at number fifty-four on MTV's list of the '100 Greatest Music Videos Ever Made'. as well as at number one-hundred on MuchMusic's 100 Greatest Videos Ever. Their 2003 video for \"(s)AINT\" was referred to by \"NME\" as \"one of the most explicit music videos ever made\", and was included in lists of the 'Most Controversial Music Videos' by both \"Time\" and \"SF Weekly\".\nThe band have received several Kerrang! Awards throughout their career, and were inducted into the \"Kerrang!\" Hall of Fame in 2000. Manson also received their Icon Award in 2005, as well as their Lifetime Achievement Award ten years later. The publication has ranked \"Holy Wood (In the Shadow of the Valley of Death)\" as the eleventh greatest rock album of the 2000s, and in 2015 they listed Manson as the twenty-eighth greatest rockstar in the world. VH1 included Marilyn Manson at seventy-eight on their list of the '100 Greatest Artists of Hard Rock', and also included \"The Beautiful People\" at number eighty-six on their list of the \"100 Greatest Hard Rock Songs\". Similarly, Gigwise included Manson at number thirty-six in their list of the '60 Greatest Solo Artists of All Time'. In 2016, Manson was presented with an Icon Award at the Alternative Press Music Awards. The band has also received four Grammy Award nominations, including two for Best Metal Performance, along with nominations for Best Hard Rock Performance and Best Hard Rock/Metal Performance. Marilyn Manson have sold over 50 million records worldwide.\nSeveral commentators have referred to the band's lead singer as being one of the most iconic and controversial figures in heavy metal music, with some going so far as to call him a \"pop culture icon\". \"Paste\" magazine said there were \"few artists in the 90s as shocking as Marilyn Manson, the most famous of the shock-rockers.\" \"Rolling Stone\" editor Lorraine Ali credited \"Antichrist Superstar\" with marking the end of the reign of grunge within popular music, writing that Marilyn Manson \"[offered] total escapism as a true alternative\", elaborating that the album was \"a volatile reaction to five years of earnest, post-Nirvana rock.\" In 2003, Jon Wiederhorn of MTV called Manson \"the only major performer today who can justifiably call himself an artist.\" Graham Hartmann of \"Loudwire\" said that the band's best songs document \"a career that is unlike any other that came before\", highlighting their mix of a \"rock 'n' roll mentality with profound lyrics narrating the progression of society in real time, Manson has developed a polarizing identity as both a beloved hero and a reviled villain.\" Hannah Ewers of \"The Guardian\" wrote in 2016 that the band's music has \"never been more relevant [than] at this time of cultural and political turbulence. Whether [his lyrics are addressing] America's gun crime problem, sexual abuse, religious hypocrisy or consumerism, Manson remains a relevant cultural figure rather than a 90s one, because he continues to address the times without lapsing into a parody\", and opined: \"As long as young people are angry (which they are), he will have listeners.\"\nThe band has been noted as influencing numerous groups within metal-associated genres, such as American Head Charge, Babymetal, Black Veil Brides, Combichrist, Kittie, Korn, Motionless in White, Murderdolls, Mushroomhead, New Years Day, September Mourning, Slipknot, and Vanna. Outside of heavy metal, both the band and its lead singer have inspired a diverse group of acts, including the Astroid Boys, Avril Lavigne, Charli XCX, Creeper, Die Antwoord, Eminem, Grimes, Halsey, Lady Gaga, Lana Del Rey, Lil Uzi Vert, Ghostemane, Ski Mask the Slump God, Kid Bookie, Trippie Redd, Lil Peep, Lisa Marie Presley, Muse, My Chemical Romance, Mykki Blanco, Natalia Kills, Porcelain Black, Salem, Skrillex, Skylar Grey and Years &amp; Years. Garbage vocalist Shirley Manson has called Manson an \"amazing figure and provocateur and agitator\" and said that he was \"always challenging you to think about the church, to think about sexuality and to think about society in different ways. We just don't have singers like that anymore.\" Billy Corgan of The Smashing Pumpkins has commended Manson's manipulation of the culture of celebrity, saying: \"He's very savvy, in that he lets people think things about him or plays into things to see what will happen, almost like a performance artist. He's a visionary in a way, because he identified a culture that was coming and now that culture is everywhere.\"\nControversies.\nIn December 1996, Secretary of Education William Bennett, along with U.S. Senator Joe Lieberman and former Pennsylvania Secretary of State C. DeLores Tucker, held a press conference wherein they questioned MCA \u2013 the owner of Interscope \u2013 president Edgar Bronfman Jr.'s ability to head the label competently whilst profiting from \"profanity-laced\" albums by artists such as Tupac Shakur, Snoop Doggy Dogg and Marilyn Manson. The following November, Representative Sam Brownback chaired a hearing of the Committee on Government Affairs. At this subcommittee, Lieberman once again criticized the band's music, calling it \"vile, hateful, nihilistic and damaging\", and repeated his request that Seagram \u2013 then-owner of MCA \u2013 \"start ... disassociating itself from Marilyn Manson.\" The subcommittee also heard from Raymond Kuntz, of Burlington, North Dakota, who blamed his son Richard's suicide on \"Antichrist Superstar\u2014\"specifically the song \"The Reflecting God\".\nThe band's live performances have also come under fire\u2014the \"Dead to the World Tour\", in particular, was followed by protesters at nearly every North American venue it visited. Several state legislatures, including the Utah State Legislature, South Carolina Legislature and the Virginia General Assembly, enacted legislation specifically targeting the group, which banned them from performing in state-operated venues. These laws would later be repealed, following separate lawsuits from fans, the American Civil Liberties Union, and Ozzy Osbourne, who sued the New Jersey Sports and Exposition Authority after they forced the cancellation of the New Jersey date of the 1997 Ozzfest at Giants Stadium.\nOn June 30, 2003, the mutilated body of fourteen-year old schoolgirl Jodi Jones was discovered in woodland near her home in Easthouses, Scotland. The injuries sustained by Jones closely resembled those of actress Elizabeth Short, who was murdered in 1947 and was popularly referred to by media as the Black Dahlia. Jones's boyfriend, then-fifteen year old Luke Mitchell, was arrested on suspicion of her murder ten months later. During a search of his home, detectives confiscated a copy of \"The Golden Age of Grotesque\" containing the short film \"Doppelherz\". It was purchased two days after Jones's death. A ten-minute excerpt from the film, as well as several paintings by Manson depicting the Black Dahlia's mutilated body, were presented as evidence during the trial. Mitchell was found guilty of murder and sentenced to serve a minimum of twenty years in prison.\nThe band's scheduled appearance at the Park Live Festival in Moscow on June 27, 2014, was canceled moments before they were due to arrive on stage, after authorities received numerous bomb threats, while hundreds of activists affiliated with the Russian Orthodox Church protested outside the venue. The incident culminated in the assault of several members of the band and crew near their hotel. Two days later, a performance in Novosibirsk was also canceled when authorities refused to grant permission for the show to go ahead, accusing Manson of insulting the beliefs of the Orthodox church and of \"promoting sadomasochism\". Later that year, Manson garnered significant media attention when a video depicting the simulated rape of Lana Del Rey was posted onto YouTube by production company Sturmgruppe. The video, titled \"Sturmgruppe 2013 Reel\", showed simulated footage of film director Eli Roth attacking Del Rey, which was interspersed by unrelated images from two of the band's previous music videos\u2014\"No Reflection\" and \"Slo-Mo-Tion\". Manson's representatives released a statement to \"Billboard\" denying any involvement in the production of the rape scenes.\nIn October 2017, Twiggy Ramirez was accused of sexual assault by ex-girlfriend Jessicka Addams during their relationship in the mid-90s. Soon after, Manson announced that he had \"decided to part ways\" with his longterm bassist. Several days later, Ramirez released a statement which said: \"I have only recently been made aware of these allegations from over 20 years ago. I do not condone non-consensual sex of any kind. I will be taking some time to spend with my family and focus on maintaining my several years of sobriety. If I have caused anyone pain, I apologize and truly regret it.\"\nAlleged influence on school shootings.\nColumbine massacre.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\nI couldn't care less about those kids' reasoning. What reason do we have to go to war? It's all the same. Killing somebody can't be justified by having a reason. I think it says a lot about the media that those two kids were on the cover of \"Time\" magazine twice, because I'm sure that's everything they wanted. They wanted fame. America sold them the idea that an obituary is just another headline.\n\u2014Marilyn Manson on the Columbine massacre.\nOn April 20, 1999, Columbine High School students Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold killed twelve students and a teacher, and wounded twenty-one others before committing suicide. In the days following the massacre, media reports surfaced alleging that they were influenced by violence in entertainment, specifically movies, video games and music. The pair were widely reported as being fans of German bands KMFDM and Rammstein, but the majority of blame was directed at Marilyn Manson.\nFive days after the incident, longtime music industry critics Republican former Secretary of Education William Bennett and Democratic U.S. Senator Joseph Lieberman cited the band as a contributing factor to the massacre during an appearance on \"Meet the Press\". Soon after, sensationalist headlines such as \"Killers Worshipped Rock Freak Manson\" and \"Devil-Worshipping Maniac Told Kids To Kill\" began appearing in media coverage of the tragedy (such as Fox News). The Mayor of Denver, Wellington Webb, successfully petitioned promoters to cancel KBPI-FM's annual 'Birthday Bash', at which the band was scheduled to appear. Coloradoan politicians such as Governor Bill Owens and Republican Representative Tom Tancredo accused Manson of promoting \"hate, violence, death, suicide, drug use and the attitudes and actions of the Columbine High School killers.\" Later reports stated that neither Harris nor Klebold were fans of Marilyn Manson. The band canceled the remaining four dates of the Rock Is Dead Tour out of respect for the victims, while maintaining that music, movies, books or video games were not to blame.\nEleven days after the massacre, Manson wrote an op-ed piece for \"Rolling Stone\", titled \"Columbine: Whose Fault Is It?\", where he rebuked the ensuing hysteria and \"witch hunt\", and castigated US gun culture, the political influence of the National Rifle Association of America, and the media's culpability in similarly violent events in the future \u2013 through their irresponsible coverage \u2013 in facilitating the placement of blame on a scapegoat, instead of informing the populace of genuine societal issues.\nOther shootings.\nThe controversy connecting the band and school shootings continued on October 10, 2007, following the SuccessTech Academy shooting. After being punched in the face by another student while exiting a bathroom, Asa Coon shot his attacker \u2013 Michael Peek \u2013 in the abdomen. Armed with two revolvers, he then proceeded down a hallway, where he wounded another student and two teachers by firing into two occupied classrooms, before entering a nearby bathroom and committing suicide. Coon was wearing a black Marilyn Manson T-shirt during the incident.\nOn May 18, 2009, 15-year-old Justin Doucet, a student at Larose Middle School in Lafourche Parish, Louisiana, entered the school armed with a .25-caliber Automatic Colt Pistol. When seventh-grade teacher Jessica Plaisance refused to comply with Doucet's demand to say \"Hail Marilyn Manson\", he fired two shots, narrowly missing her head, before turning the gun on himself. He died from his injuries a week later.\nBand members.\nCurrent members\nFormer members\nTours.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Col-begin/styles.css\"/&gt;\nAwards and nominations.\nGrammy Awards\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Awards table/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "19451", "revid": "35936988", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19451", "title": "Mortimer J. Adler", "text": "American philosopher, author and educator (1902\u20132001)\nMortimer Jerome Adler (; December 28, 1902 \u2013 June 28, 2001) was an American philosopher, educator, encyclopedist, popular author and lay theologian. As a philosopher he worked within the Aristotelian and Thomistic traditions. He taught at Columbia University and the University of Chicago, served as chairman of the \"Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica\" board of editors, and founded the Institute for Philosophical Research.\nHe lived for long stretches in New York City, Chicago, San Francisco, and San Mateo, California.\nBiography.\nEarly life and education.\nAdler was born in Manhattan, New York City, on December 28, 1902, to Jewish immigrants from Germany: Clarissa (Manheim), a schoolteacher, and Ignatz Adler, a jewelry salesman. He dropped out of school at age 14 to become a copy boy for \"The New York Sun\", with the ultimate aspiration of becoming a journalist. Adler soon returned to school to take writing classes at night, where he discovered the western philosophical tradition. After his early schooling and work, he went on to study at Columbia University and contributed to the student literary magazine, \"The Morningside,\" a poem \"Choice\" (in 1922 when Charles A. Wagner was editor-in-chief and Whittaker Chambers an associate editor). Though he refused to take the required swimming test for a bachelor's degree (a matter that was rectified when Columbia gave him an honorary degree in 1983), he stayed at the university and eventually received an instructorship and finally a doctorate in psychology. While at Columbia University, Adler wrote his first book: \"Dialectic\", published in 1927.\nAdler worked with Scott Buchanan at the People's Institute and then for many years on their respective Great Books efforts. (Buchanan was the founder of the Great Books program at St. John's College).\nIntellectual development and philosophic evolution.\nWhile doing newspaper work and taking night classes during his adolescence, Adler encountered works of men he would come to call heroes: Plato, Aristotle, Thomas Aquinas, John Locke, John Stuart Mill, and others, who \"were assailed as irrelevant by student activists in the 1960s and subjected to 'politically correct' attack in later decades.\" His thought evolved toward the correction of what he considered \"philosophical mistakes\", as reflected in his 1985 book \"\". In Adler's view, these errors were introduced by Descartes on the continent and by Thomas Hobbes and David Hume in Britain, and were caused by a \"culpable ignorance\" about Aristotle by those who rejected the conclusions of dogmatic philosophy without acknowledging its sound classical premises. These modern errors were compounded and perpetuated, according to Adler, by Kant and the idealists and existentialists on the one side, and by John Stuart Mill, Jeremy Bentham, and Bertrand Russell and the English analytic tradition on the other. Adler held that he corrected these mistakes with reference to insights and distinctions drawn from the Aristotelian tradition.\nChicago.\nIn 1930, Robert Hutchins, the newly appointed president of the University of Chicago, whom Adler had befriended some years earlier, arranged for Chicago's law school to hire him as a professor of the philosophy of law. The philosophers at Chicago (who included James H. Tufts, E. A. Burtt, and George H. Mead) had \"entertained grave doubts as to Dr. Adler's competence in the field [of philosophy]\" and resisted Adler's appointment to the university's Department of Philosophy. Adler was the first \"non-lawyer\" to join the law school faculty. After the Great Books seminar inspired Chicago businessman and university trustee Walter Paepcke to found the Aspen Institute, Adler taught philosophy to business executives there.\nPopular appeal.\nAdler long strove to bring philosophy to the masses, and some of his works (such as \"How to Read a Book\") became popular bestsellers. He was also an advocate of economic democracy and wrote an influential preface to Louis O. Kelso's \"The Capitalist Manifesto\". Adler was often aided in his thinking and writing by Arthur Rubin, an old friend from his Columbia undergraduate days. In his own words:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Unlike many of my contemporaries, I never write books for my fellow professors to read. I have no interest in the academic audience at all. I'm interested in Joe Doakes. A general audience can read any book I write \u2013 and they do.\nDwight Macdonald once criticized Adler's popular style by saying \"Mr. Adler once wrote a book called \"How to Read a Book\". He should now read a book called \"How to Write a Book\".\"\nEncyclopedia and educational reform.\nAdler and Hutchins went on to found the Great Books of the Western World program and the Great Books Foundation. In 1952, Adler founded and served as director of the Institute for Philosophical Research. He also served on the Board of Editors of \"Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica\", compiled its Syntopicon and later Propaedia, and succeeded Hutchins as its chairman from 1974. As the director of editorial planning for the fifteenth edition of \"Britannica\" from 1965, he was instrumental in the major reorganization of knowledge embodied in that edition. He introduced the Paideia Proposal which resulted in his founding the Paideia Program, a grade school curriculum centered around guided reading and discussion of difficult works (as judged for each grade). With Max Weismann, he founded the Center for the Study of the Great Ideas in 1990 in Chicago.\nReligion and theology.\nAdler was born into a nonobservant Jewish family. In his early twenties, he discovered St. Thomas Aquinas, and in particular the \"Summa Theologica\". Many years later, he wrote that its \"intellectual austerity, integrity, precision and brilliance ... put the study of theology highest among all of my philosophical interests.\" An enthusiastic Thomist, he was a frequent contributor to Catholic philosophical and educational journals, as well as a frequent speaker at Catholic institutions, so much so that some assumed he was a convert to Catholicism. But that was reserved for later.\nIn 1940, James T. Farrell called Adler \"the leading American fellow-traveller of the Roman Catholic Church.\" What was true for Adler, Farrell said, was what was \"postulated in the dogma of the Roman Catholic Church,\" and he \"sang the same tune\" as avowed Catholic philosophers like \u00c9tienne Gilson, Jacques Maritain, and Martin D'Arcy. He also greatly admired Henri Bergson, the French Jewish philosopher and Nobel laureate, whose books the Catholic church had indexed as prohibited. Bergson refused to convert during the collaborationist Vichy regime, and despite the Statute on Jews he instead restated his previous views and was thus stripped of all his previous posts and honors. Farrell attributed Adler's delay in joining the Church to his being among those Christians who \"wanted their cake and ... wanted to eat it too\" and compared him to the Emperor Constantine, who waited until he was on his deathbed to formally become a Catholic.\nAdler took a long time to make up his mind about theological issues. When he wrote \"How to Think About God: A Guide for the Twentieth-Century Pagan\" in 1980, he claimed to consider himself the pagan of the book's subtitle. In volume 51 of the \"Mars Hill Audio Journal\" (2001), Ken Myers includes his 1980 interview with Adler, conducted after \"How to Think About God\" was published. Myers reminisces, \"During that interview, I asked him why he had never embraced the Christian faith himself. He explained that while he had been profoundly influenced by a number of Christian thinkers during his life, ... there were moral \u2013 not intellectual \u2013 obstacles to his conversion. He didn't explain any further.\"\nMyers notes that Adler finally \"surrendered to the Hound of Heaven\" and \"made a confession of faith and was baptized\" as an Episcopalian in 1984, only a few years after that interview. Offering insight into Adler's conversion, Myers quotes him from a subsequent 1990 article in \"Christianity\" magazine: \"My chief reason for choosing Christianity was because the mysteries were incomprehensible. What's the point of revelation if we could figure it out ourselves? If it were wholly comprehensible, then it would just be another philosophy.\"\nAccording to his friend Deal Hudson, Adler \"had been attracted to Catholicism for many years\" and \"wanted to be a Roman Catholic, but issues like abortion and the resistance of his family and friends\" kept him away. Many thought he was baptized as an Episcopalian rather than a Catholic solely because of his \"wonderful \u2013 and ardently Episcopal \u2013 wife\" Caroline. Hudson suggests it is no coincidence that it was only after her death in 1998 that he took the final step. In December 1999, in San Mateo, where he had moved to spend his last years, Adler was formally received into the Catholic Church by a long-time friend and admirer, Bishop Pierre DuMaine. \"Finally,\" wrote another friend, Ralph McInerny, \"he became the Roman Catholic he had been training to be all his life\".\nDespite not being a Catholic for most of his life, on account of his lifelong participation in the Neo-Thomist movement and his almost equally long membership in the American Catholic Philosophical Association, this latter, according to McInerny is willing to consider Adler \"a Catholic philosopher\".\nPhilosophy.\nAdler referred to Aristotle's \"Nicomachean Ethics\" as the \"ethics of common sense\" and also as \"the only moral philosophy that is sound, practical, and undogmatic.\" Thus, it is the only ethical doctrine that answers all the questions that moral philosophy should and can attempt to answer, neither more nor less, and that has answers that are true by the standard of truth that is appropriate and applicable to normative judgments. In contrast, Adler believed that other theories or doctrines try to answer more questions than they can or fewer than they should, and their answers are mixtures of truth and error, particularly the moral philosophy of Immanuel Kant.\nAdler was a self-proclaimed \"moderate dualist\" and viewed the positions of psychophysical dualism and materialistic monism to be opposite sides of two extremes. Regarding dualism, he dismissed the extreme form of dualism that stemmed from such philosophers as Plato (body and soul) and Descartes (mind and matter), as well as the theory of extreme monism and the mind\u2013brain identity theory. After eliminating the extremes, Adler subscribed to a more moderate form of dualism. He believed that the brain is only a necessary, but not a sufficient, condition for conceptual thought; that an \"immaterial intellect\" is also requisite as a condition; and that the difference between human and animal behavior is a radical difference in kind. Adler defended this position against many challenges to dualistic theories.\nFreedom and free will.\nThe meanings of \"freedom\" and \"free will\" have been and are under debate, and the debate is confused because there is no generally accepted definition of either term. Adler's \"Institute for Philosophical Research\" spent ten years studying the \"idea of freedom\" as the word was used by hundreds of authors who have discussed and disputed freedom. The study was published in 1958 as Volume One of \"The Idea of Freedom\", subtitled \"A Dialectical Examination of the Idea of Freedom\" with subsequent comments in \"Adler's Philosophical Dictionary\". Adler's study concluded that a delineation of three kinds of freedom \u2013 circumstantial, natural, and acquired \u2013 is necessary for clarity on the subject.\nReligion.\nAs Adler's interest in religion and theology increased, he made references to the Bible and the need to test articles of faith for compatibility with the conclusions of the science of nature and of philosophers. In his 1981 book \"How to Think About God\", Adler attempts to demonstrate God as the exnihilator (the creator of something from nothing). Adler stressed that even with this conclusion, God's existence cannot be proven or demonstrated, but only established as true beyond a reasonable doubt. However, in a recent re-review of the argument, John Cramer concluded that recent developments in cosmology appear to converge with and support Adler's argument, and that in light of such theories as the multiverse, the argument is no worse for wear and may, indeed, now be judged somewhat more probable than it was originally.\nAdler believed that, if theology and religion are living things, there is nothing intrinsically wrong about efforts to modernize them. They must be open to change and growth like everything else. Furthermore, there is no reason to be surprised when discussions such as those about the \"death of God\" \u2013 a concept drawn from Friedrich Nietzsche \u2013 stir popular excitement as they did in the recent past and could do so again today. According to Adler, of all the great ideas, the idea of God has always been and continues to be the one that evokes the greatest concern among the widest group of men and women. However, he was opposed to the idea of converting atheism into a new form of religion or theology.\nPersonal life.\nMortimer Adler was married twice and had four children. He married Helen Boynton in 1927. Together they adopted two children, Mark and Michael, in 1938 and 1940, respectively. They divorced in 1960. In 1963, Adler married Caroline Pring, his junior by thirty-four years; they had two children, Douglas and Philip.\nPublished works.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

His ideas continue to influence social theory and research.\nBorn in Erfurt in 1864, Weber studied law and history in Berlin, G\u00f6ttingen, and Heidelberg. After earning his doctorate in law in 1889 and habilitation in 1891, he taught in Berlin, Freiburg, and Heidelberg. He married his cousin Marianne Schnitger two years later. In 1897, he had a breakdown after his father died following an argument. Weber ceased teaching and travelled until the early 1900s. He recovered and wrote \"The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism\". During the First World War, he initially supported Germany's war effort but became critical of it and supported democratisation. He also gave the lectures \"Science as a Vocation\" and \"Politics as a Vocation\". After the war, Weber co-founded the German Democratic Party, unsuccessfully ran for office, and advised the drafting of the Weimar Constitution. Becoming frustrated with politics, he resumed teaching in Vienna and Munich. He died of pneumonia in 1920 at the age of 56, possibly as a result of the post-war Spanish flu pandemic. A book, \"Economy and Society\", was left unfinished.\nOne of Weber's main intellectual concerns was in understanding the processes of rationalisation, secularisation, and disenchantment. He formulated a thesis arguing that such processes were associated with the rise of capitalism and modernity. Weber also argued that the Protestant work ethic influenced the creation of capitalism in \"The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism\". It was followed by \"The Economic Ethics of the World Religions\", where he examined the religions of China, India, and ancient Judaism. In terms of government, Weber argued that states were defined by their monopoly on violence and categorised social authority into three distinct forms: charismatic, traditional, and rational-legal. He was also a key proponent of methodological antipositivism, arguing for the study of social action through interpretive rather than purely empiricist methods. Weber made a variety of other contributions to economic sociology, political sociology, and the sociology of religion.\nAfter his death, the rise of Weberian scholarship was slowed by the Weimar Republic's political instability and the rise of Nazi Germany. In the post-war era, organised scholarship began to appear, led by Talcott Parsons. Other American and British scholars were also involved in its development. Over the course of the twentieth century, Weber's reputation grew as translations of his works became widely available and scholars increasingly engaged with his life and ideas. As a result of these works, he began to be regarded as a founding father of sociology, alongside Karl Marx and \u00c9mile Durkheim, and one of the central figures in the development of the social sciences more generally.\nBiography.\nEarly life and education.\nMaximilian Carl Emil Weber was born on 21 April 1864 in Erfurt, Province of Saxony, Kingdom of Prussia, and his family moved to Charlottenburg in 1869. He was the oldest of Max Weber Sr. and Helene Fallenstein's eight children. Over the course of his life, Weber Sr. held posts as a lawyer, civil servant, and parliamentarian for the National Liberal Party in the Prussian Landtag and German Reichstag. This immersed his home in both politics and academia, as his salon welcomed scholars and public figures such as the philosopher Wilhelm Dilthey, the jurist Levin Goldschmidt, and the historian Theodor Mommsen. The young Weber and his brother Alfred, who also became a sociologist, spent their formative years in this intellectual atmosphere. Meanwhile, Fallenstein was partly descended from the French Huguenot Souchay family, which had obtained wealth through international commerce and the textile industry. Over time, Weber was affected by the marital and personality tensions between his father, who enjoyed material pleasures while overlooking religious and philanthropic causes, and his mother, a devout Calvinist and philanthropist.\nWeber entered the in Charlottenburg in 1870, before attending the between 1872 and 1882. While in class, bored and unimpressed with his teachers, Weber secretly read all forty of Johann Friedrich Cotta's volumes of the writer Johann Wolfgang von Goethe's works. Before entering university, he read many other classical works, including those by the philosopher Immanuel Kant. For Christmas in 1877, a thirteen-year-old Weber gifted his parents two historical essays, entitled \"About the Course of German History, with Special Reference to the Positions of the Emperor and the Pope\" and \"About the Roman Imperial Period from Constantine to the Migration Period\". Two years later, also during Christmastime, he wrote another historical essay, \"Observations on the Ethnic Character, Development, and History of the Indo-European Nations\". These three essays were non-derivative contributions to the philosophy of history and were derived from Weber's reading of \"numerous sources\".\nIn 1882, Weber enrolled in Heidelberg University as a law student, later studying at the Royal Friedrich Wilhelm University of Berlin and the University of G\u00f6ttingen. Weber's university years were dotted with several periods of military service, the longest of which lasted between October 1883 and September 1884. During this time, he was in Strasbourg and attended classes at the University of Strasbourg that his uncle, the historian Hermann Baumgarten, taught. Weber befriended Baumgarten, who influenced Weber's growing liberalism and criticism of Otto von Bismarck's domination of German politics. Weber was a member of the \"Burschenschaft Allemannia Heidelberg\", a (\"student association\"), and heavily drank beer and engaged in academic fencing during his first few university years. As a result of the latter, he obtained several duelling scars on the left side of his face. His mother was displeased by his behaviour and slapped him after he came home when his third semester ended in 1883. However, Weber matured, increasingly supported his mother in family arguments, and grew estranged from his father.\nOn 15 May 1886, Weber passed the Referendar examination, a legal training examination. He practiced law and worked as a lecturer simultaneously with his studies. Under the tutelage of Levin Goldschmidt and Rudolf von Gneist, Weber earned his law doctorate in 1889 by writing a dissertation on legal history titled \"Development of the Principle of Joint Liability and a Separate Fund of the General Partnership out of the Household Communities and Commercial Associations in Italian Cities\". It was a part of a longer work, \"On the History of Commercial Partnerships in the Middle Ages, Based on Southern European Documents\", which he published later that year. In the same year, Weber began working on his habilitation, a post-doctoral thesis, with the statistician August Meitzen and completed it two years later. His habilitation, titled \"Roman Agrarian History and Its Significance for Public and Private Law\", focused on the relationship between Roman surveying and Roman agrarian law. Theodor Mommsen was present and debated with him during his defence, later indicating that he wanted Weber to be his successor. Having thus become a , Weber joined the faculty of the Royal Friedrich Wilhelm University of Berlin, lecturing, conducting research, and consulting for the government.\nMarriage, early work, and breakdown.\nFrom 1887 until her declining mental health caused him to break off their relationship five years later, Weber had a semi-engagement with Emmy Baumgarten, the daughter of Hermann Baumgarten. Afterwards, he began a relationship with his second cousin Marianne Schnitger in 1893 and married her on 20 September of that year in Oerlinghausen. The marriage gave Weber financial independence, allowing him to leave his parents' household. They had no children. Marianne was a feminist activist and an author in her own right. Academically, between the completion of his dissertation and habilitation, Weber took an interest in contemporary social policy. He joined the (\"Association for Social Policy\") in 1888. The was an organisation of reformist thinkers who were generally members of the historical school of economics. Weber also involved himself in politics, participating in the founding of the left-leaning Evangelical Social Congress in 1890. It applied a Protestant perspective to the political debate regarding the social question. In the same year, the established a research program to examine the , which was the western migration of ethnically German agricultural labourers from eastern Germany and the corresponding influx of Polish farm workers into it. Weber was put in charge of the study and wrote a large part of the final report, which generated considerable attention and controversy, marking the beginning of his renown as a social scientist.\nFrom 1893 to 1899, Weber was a member of the Pan-German League (), an organisation that opposed the influx of Polish workers. The degree of his support for the Germanisation of Poles and similar German nationalist policies continues to be debated by scholars. Weber and his wife moved to Freiburg in 1894, where he was appointed professor of economics at the University of Freiburg. His 1895 inaugural lecture, \"The Nation State and Economic Policy\", criticised Polish immigration and argued that the Junkers were encouraging Slavic immigration to serve their economic interests over those of Germany. It influenced the politician Friedrich Naumann to create the National-Social Association, which was a Christian socialist and German nationalist political organisation. Weber was pessimistic regarding its potential success, and it dissolved after winning a single Reichstag seat in the 1903 German federal election. In 1896, he accepted an appointment to a chair in economics and finance at Heidelberg University. There, Weber and his wife became the central figures in the eponymous Weber Circle, which included Georg Jellinek, Ernst Troeltsch, and Werner Sombart. Younger scholars, such as Gy\u00f6rgy Luk\u00e1cs and Robert Michels, also joined it.\nIn June 1897, Weber had a severe quarrel with his father over his father's treatment of his mother. Weber Sr. died two months later while on a trip to Riga, leaving the argument unresolved. Afterwards, Weber became increasingly prone to depression, nervousness, and insomnia, which made it difficult for him to fulfill his professorial duties. His condition forced him to seek an exemption from his teaching obligations, which was granted in 1899. He spent time in the in 1898 and in a different sanatorium in Bad Urach in 1900. Weber also travelled to Corsica and Italy between 1899 and 1903 in order to alleviate his illness. He fully withdrew from teaching in 1903 and did not return to it until 1918. Weber thoroughly described his ordeal with mental illness in a personal chronology that his widow later destroyed. Its destruction was possibly caused by Marianne's fear that the Nazis would discredit his work if his experience with mental illness were widely known.\nRecovery and reintroduction to academia.\nAfter recovering from his illness, Weber became an associate editor of the (\"Archive for Social Science and Social Policy\") in 1904, alongside his colleagues Edgar Jaff\u00e9 and Werner Sombart. It facilitated his reintroduction to academia and became one of the most prominent social science journals as a result of his efforts. Weber published some of his most seminal works in this journal, including his book \"The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism\", which became his most famous work and laid the foundations for his later research on religion's impact on economic systems' development. Also in 1904, he was invited to participate in the Congress of Arts and Sciences that was held in connection with the Louisiana Purchase Exposition\u00a0\u2013 the World's fair\u00a0\u2013 in St. Louis. He went alongside his wife, Werner Sombart, Ernst Troeltsch, and other German scholars. Taking advantage of the fair, the Webers embarked on an almost three-month-long trip that began and ended in New York City. They travelled throughout the country, from New England to the Deep South. Different communities were visited, including German immigrant towns and African American communities. North Carolina was also visited, as some of Weber's relatives in the Fallenstein family had settled there. Weber used the trip to learn more about America's social, economic, and theological conditions and their relationship with his thesis. Afterwards, he felt that he was unable to resume regular teaching and remained a private scholar, helped by an inheritance in 1907.\nShortly after returning, Weber's attention shifted to the then-recent Russian Revolution of 1905. He learned the Russian language in a few months, subscribed to Russian newspapers, and discussed Russian political and social affairs with the Russian community in Heidelberg. He was personally popular in that community and twice entertained the idea of travelling to Russia. His schedule prevented it, however. While he was sceptical of the revolution's ability to succeed, Weber supported the establishment of a liberal democracy in Russia. He wrote two essays on it that were published in the . Weber thought that the peasants' desire for land caused the revolution. He discussed the role of the , rural peasant communities, in Russian political debates. According to Weber, they were difficult for liberal agrarian reformers to abolish due to their basis in natural law and the rising class manipulating them for their own gain. His general interpretation of the Russian Revolution was that it lacked a clear leader and was not based on the Russian intellectuals' goals. Instead, it was the result of the peasants' emotional passions.\nIn 1909, having become increasingly dissatisfied with the political conservatism and perceived lack of methodological discipline of the , he co-founded the German Sociological Association () and served as its first treasurer. Weber associated the society with the and viewed them as not having been competitors. He unsuccessfully tried to steer the association's direction. As part of that, Weber tried to make the its official journal. He resigned from his position as treasurer in 1912. That was caused by his support for value-freedom in the social sciences, which was a controversial position in the association. Weber\u00a0\u2013 alongside Simmel, Sombart, and T\u00f6nnies\u00a0\u2013 placed an abbreviated form of it into the association's statutes, prompting criticism from its other members. Also in 1909, Weber and his wife befriended a former student of his, Else von Richthofen, and the pianist Mina Tobler. After failing to court Richthofen, Weber began an affair with Tobler in 1911.\nLater, during the spring of 1913, Weber holidayed in the Monte Verit\u00e0 community in Ascona, Switzerland. While holidaying, he was advising Frieda Gross in her custody battle for her children. He opposed Erich M\u00fchsam's involvement because M\u00fchsam was an anarchist. Weber argued that the case needed to be dealt with by bourgeois reformers who were not \"derailed\". A year later, also in spring, he again holidayed in Ascona. The community contained several different expressions of the then-contemporaneous radical political and lifestyle reform movements. They included naturism, free love, and Western esotericism, among others. Weber was critical of the anarchist and erotic movements in Ascona, as he viewed their fusion as having been politically absurd.\nFirst World War and political involvement.\nAfter the outbreak of the First World War in 1914, Weber volunteered for service and was appointed as a reserve officer in charge of organising the army hospitals in Heidelberg, a role he fulfilled until the end of 1915. His views on the war and expanding the German Empire changed over the course of the conflict. Early on, he supported the German war effort, believing that the war was necessary to fulfill Germany's duty as a leading state power. Later, however, Weber became one of the most prominent critics of both German expansionism and the Kaiser's war policies. He publicly criticised Germany's potential annexation of Belgium and unrestricted submarine warfare, later supporting calls for constitutional reform, democratisation, and universal suffrage. His younger brother Karl, an architect, was killed near Brest-Litovsk in 1915 while fighting in the war. Weber had previously viewed him negatively but his death made him feel more connected to him.\nHe and his wife also participated in the 1917 Lauenstein Conferences at Lauenstein Castle in Bavaria. These conferences were planned by the publisher Eugen Diederichs and brought together intellectuals, including Theodor Heuss, Ernst Toller, and Werner Sombart. Weber's presence elevated his profile in Germany and served to dispel some of the event's romantic atmosphere. After speaking at the first one, he became involved in the planning for the second one, as Diederichs thought that the conferences needed an oppositional figure. In this capacity, he argued against the political romanticism that Max Maurenbrecher, a former theologian, espoused. Weber also opposed what he saw as the youth groups and nationalists' excessive rhetoric at Lauenstein, instead supporting German democratisation. For Weber and the younger participants, the conferences' romantic intent was irrelevant to the determination of Germany's future. In November, shortly after the second conference, Weber was invited by the Free Student Youth\u00a0\u2013 a student organisation\u00a0\u2013 to give a lecture in Munich, resulting in \"Science as a Vocation\". In it, he argued that an inner calling and specialisation were necessary for one to become a scholar. Weber also began a sadomasochistic affair with Else von Richthofen the next year. Meanwhile, she was simultaneously conducting an affair with his brother, Alfred. Max Weber's affairs with Richtofen and Mina Tobler lasted until his death in 1920.\nAfter the war ended, Weber unsuccessfully ran for a seat in the Weimar National Assembly in January 1919 as a member of the liberal German Democratic Party, which he had co-founded. He also advised the National Assembly in its drafting of the Weimar Constitution. While campaigning for his party, Weber critiqued the left and complained about Karl Liebknecht and Rosa Luxemburg who led the leftist Spartacus League. He regarded the German Revolution of 1918\u20131919 as responsible for Germany's inability to contest Poland's claims on its eastern territories. His opposition to the revolution may have prevented Friedrich Ebert, the new president of Germany and a member of the Social Democratic Party, from appointing him as a minister or ambassador. Weber also criticized the Treaty of Versailles, which he believed unjustly assigned war guilt to Germany. Instead, he believed that many countries were guilty, not just Germany. In making this case, Weber argued that Russia was the only great power that actually desired the war. Overall, Weber's political efforts were unsuccessful, with the exception of his support for a democratically elected and strong presidency. On 28 January 1919, after his electoral defeat, Weber delivered a lecture titled \"Politics as a Vocation\", which discussed politics. It was prompted by the early Weimar Republic's political turmoil and was requested by the Free Student Youth. Shortly before he left to join the Versailles delegation on 13 May 1919, Weber used his connections with the German National People's Party's deputies to meet with Erich Ludendorff and spent several hours unsuccessfully trying to convince him to surrender himself to the Allies.\nLast years.\nFrustrated with politics, Weber resumed teaching, first at the University of Vienna in 1918, then at the Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich in 1919. In Vienna, Weber filled a vacant chair in political economy that he had been considered for since October 1917. While there, he gave a lecture titled \"Socialism\" on the eponymous subject to a group of Austro-Hungarian Army officers. He also had a heated debate with Joseph Schumpeter at the Caf\u00e9 Landtmann on whether the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic was usable as a case study for communism. Later, in Munich, Weber was appointed to Lujo Brentano's chair in social science, economic history, and political economy. He accepted the appointment in order to be closer to his mistress, Else von Richthofen. Responding to student requests, he gave a series of economic history lectures. The student transcriptions of it were later edited and published as the \"General Economic History\" by Siegmund Hellmann and Melchior Palyi in 1923. In terms of politics, he opposed the pardoning of the Bavarian Minister-President Kurt Eisner's murderer, Anton Graf von Arco auf Valley. In response to that, right-wing students disrupted his classes and protested in front of his home. In early 1920, Weber discussed Oswald Spengler's \"The Decline of the West\" in a seminar, provoking some of his students\u00a0\u2013 who personally knew Spengler\u00a0\u2013 to suggest that he debate Spengler alongside other scholars. They debated for two days in the Munich town hall, but the students felt that the question of how to resolve Germany's post-war issues remained unanswered.\nLili Sch\u00e4fer, one of Weber's sisters, committed suicide on 7 April 1920 after the pedagogue Paul Geheeb ended his affair with her. Weber respected it, as he thought that her suicide was justifiable and that suicide in general could be honourable. Weber and his wife took in Lili's four children and planned to raise them. He was uncomfortable with his newfound role as a father figure, but he thought that this event fulfilled Marianne as a woman. She later formally adopted the children in 1927. Weber wished for her to stay with the children in Heidelberg or move closer to Geheeb's (\"Odenwald School\") so that he could be alone in Munich with his mistress, Else von Richthofen. He left the decision to Marianne, but she said that only he could make the decision to leave for himself. While this was occurring, Weber began to believe that own life had reached its end.\nOn 4 June 1920, Weber's students were informed that he had a cold and needed to cancel classes. By 14 June 1920, the cold had turned into influenza and he died of pneumonia in Munich. He had likely contracted the Spanish flu during the post-war pandemic and been subjected to insufficient medical care. Else von Richthofen, who was present by his deathbed alongside his wife, thought that he could have survived his illness if he had been given better treatment. His body was cremated in the Munich after a secular ceremony, and his cinerary urn was later buried in the Heidelberg \"Bergfriedhof\" in 1921. The funeral service was attended by his students, including Eduard Baumgarten and Karl Loewenstein, and fellow scholars, such as Lujo Brentano. At the time of his death, Weber had not finished writing \"Economy and Society\", his on sociological theory. His widow, Marianne, helped prepare it for its publication in 1922. She later published a Weber biography in 1926 which became one of the central historical accounts of his life.\nMethodology.\nSocial action was the central focus of Weber's sociology. He also considered it an important part of the field's scientific nature. He divided social action into the four categories of affectional, traditional, instrumental, and value-rational action. Affectional actions were caused by an actor's emotions. Traditional actions were based on tradition. Instrumental actions were calculated attempts to achieve goals. Value-rational actions were attempts to enact one's values. In his methodology, he distinguished himself from \u00c9mile Durkheim and Karl Marx in that he primarily focused on individuals and culture. Whereas Durkheim focused on society, Weber concentrated on the individual and their actions. Meanwhile, compared to Marx's support for the material world's primacy over the world of ideas, Weber valued ideas as motivating individuals' actions. His perspective on structure and action and macrostructure differed from theirs in that he was open to the idea that social phenomena could have several different causes and placed importance on social actors' interpretations of their actions.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\nThe result of what has been said so far is that an \"objective\" treatment of cultural occurrences, in the sense that the ideal aim of scientific work would be to reduce the empirical [reality] to \"laws\", is absurd. \"Not\" because\u00a0\u2013 as it has often been claimed\u00a0\u2013 the course of cultural processes or, say, processes in the human mind would, \"objectively\" speaking, be less law-like, but for the following two reasons: (1) knowledge of social laws does not constitute knowledge of social reality, but is only one of the various tools that our intellect needs for that [latter] purpose; (2) knowledge of \"cultural\" occurrences is only conceivable if it takes as its point of departure the \"significance\" that the reality of life, with its always individual character, has for us in certain \"particular\" respects. No law can reveal to us in \"what\" sense and in \"what\" respects this will be the case, as that is determined by those \"value ideas\" in the light of which we look at \"culture\" in each individual case.\n\u2014Max Weber in \"The 'Objectivity' of Knowledge in Social Science and Social Policy\", 1904.\nIn terms of methodology, Weber was primarily concerned with the question of objectivity and subjectivity, distinguishing social action from social behavior, and noting that social action must be understood through individuals' subjective relationships. According to him, the study of social action through interpretive means or (\"to understand\") needed to be based upon understanding the subjective meaning and purpose that individuals attached to their actions. Determining an individual's interpretation of their actions required either empathically or rationally derived evidence. Weber noted that subjectivity's importance in the social sciences made the creation of fool-proof, universal laws harder than in the natural sciences and that the amount of objective knowledge that social sciences were able to create was limited. Overall, he supported objective science as a goal worth striving for but noted that it was ultimately unreachable.\nWeber's methodology was developed in the context of wider social scientific methodological debates. The first of which was the (\"method dispute\"). In it, he was close to historicism, as he thought that social actions were heavily tied to historical contexts. Furthermore, analysing social actions required an understanding of the relevant individuals' subjective motivations. Therefore, his methodology emphasised the use of comparative historical analysis. As such, he was more interested in explaining how an outcome was the result of various historical processes than in predicting those processes' future outcomes. The second debate that shaped Weber's perspective on methodology was the (\"value-judgement dispute\"). This debate was held between 1909 and 1914 on value-judgements in the social sciences. It originated with a debate between the supporters and opponents of the idea that ethics was an important consideration in the field of economics. Weber's position was that the social sciences should strive to be value-free. In his view, scholars and students needed to avoid promoting political values in the classroom. Science had no part in choosing values. With regards to economics, he argued that productivity was not a useful scientific concept, as it could impede the proper evaluation of economic phenomena.\nMethodological individualism.\nThe principle of methodological individualism, which holds that social scientists should seek to understand collectivities solely as the result of individual people's actions, can be traced to Weber. The term \"methodological individualism\" was coined in 1908 by the Austrian-American economist Joseph Schumpeter as a way of referring to Weber's views on how to explain social phenomena. While his research interests placed a strong emphasis on interpreting economic history, Weber's support of methodological individualism broke with the historical school of economics and agreed with the Austrian school of economics' founder, Carl Menger, in the . In the first chapter of \"Economy and Society\", Weber argued that only individuals \"can be treated as agents in a course of subjectively understandable action\". Despite the term's usage of \"individualism\", he did not interpret the individual as being the true source for sociological explanations. Instead, while only individuals could engage in intentional action, they were not necessarily separate from the collective group. Weber thought that methodological individualism had a close proximity to (\"interpretive\") sociology, as actions could be interpreted subjectively. Similarly, it was also related to ideal types in that it involved discussions of abstract and rational models of human behaviour.\nIdeal type.\nThe ideal type was a central concept in Weber's methodology. He argued that they were indispensable for the social sciences. Due their taking of meaning into account, they are unique to the social sciences. The term \"ideal type\" was derived from Georg Jellinek's use of it. Weber outlined it in \"The 'Objectivity' of Knowledge in Social Science and Social Policy\" and the first chapter of \"Economy and Society\". The ideal types' three functions are the formulation of terminology, classifications, and hypotheses. The latter task was the most important of the three. In terms of their construction, an ideal type is a schematic that represents a social action and considers the role of meaning in it. By its nature, it was an exaggeration of an empirical situation through its assumption that the involved individuals were rational, had complete situational knowledge, were completely aware of the situation, were completely aware of their actions, and made no errors. This was then contrasted with empirical reality, allowing the researcher to better understand it. However, ideal types are not direct representations of reality and Weber warned against interpreting them as such. He placed no limits on what ideal types could be used to analyse. Since, for him, rational methodology and science were synonymous with one another, ideal types were constructed rationally.\nValue-freedom.\nWeber believed that social scientists needed to avoid making value-judgements. Instead, he wanted social scientific research to be value-free. This would give scientists objectivity, but it needed to be combined with an acknowledgement that their research connected with values in different ways. As part of his support for value-freedom, Weber opposed both instructors and students promoting their political views in the classroom. He first articulated it in his writings on scientific philosophy, including \"The 'Objectivity' of Knowledge in Social Science and Social Policy\" and \"Science as a Vocation\". Weber was influenced by Heinrich Rickert's concept of value-relevance. Rickert used it to relate historical objects to values while maintaining objectivity through explicitly defined conceptual distinctions. However, Weber disagreed with the idea that a scholar could maintain objectivity while ascribing to a hierarchy of values in the way that Rickert did, however. His argument regarding value-freedom was connected to his involvement in the . During it, he argued that the social sciences needed to be value-free. Meanwhile, he unsuccessfully tried to turn the German Sociological Association into a value-free organisation. Ultimately, he resigned as a result.\nTheories.\nRationalisation.\nRationalisation was a central theme in Weber's scholarship. This theme was situated in the larger context of the relationship between psychological motivations, cultural values, cultural beliefs, and the structure of the society. Weber understood rationalisation as having resulted in increasing knowledge, growing impersonality, and the enhanced control of social and material life. He was ambivalent towards rationalisation. Weber admitted that it was responsible for many advances, particularly freeing humans from traditional, restrictive, and illogical social guidelines. However, he also criticised it for dehumanising individuals as \"cogs in the machine\" and curtailing their freedom, trapping them in the iron cage of rationality and bureaucracy. His studies of the subject began with \"The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism\". In it, he argued that Protestantism's\u00a0\u2013 particularly Calvinism's\u00a0\u2013 redefinition of the connection between work and piety caused a shift towards rational attempts to achieve economic gain. In Protestantism, piety towards God was expressed through one's secular vocation. The religious principles that influenced the creation of capitalism became unnecessary and it became able to propagate itself without them.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\nWhat Weber depicted was not only the secularisation of Western \"culture\", but also and especially the development of modern \"societies\" from the viewpoint of rationalisation. The new structures of society were marked by the differentiation of the two functionally intermeshing systems that had taken shape around the organisational cores of the capitalist enterprise and the bureaucratic state apparatus. Weber understood this process as the institutionalisation of purposive-rational economic and administrative action. To the degree that everyday life was affected by this cultural and societal rationalisation, traditional forms of life\u00a0\u2013 which in the early modern period were differentiated primarily according to one's trade\u00a0\u2013 were dissolved.\n \u2014J\u00fcrgen Habermas in \"The Philosophical Discourse of Modernity: Twelve Lectures\", 1990.\nWeber continued his investigation into rationalisation in later works, notably in his studies on bureaucracy and the classification of legitimate authority into three ideal types\u00a0\u2013 rational-legal, traditional, and charismatic\u00a0\u2013 of which rational-legal was the dominant one in modernity. In these works, Weber described what he saw as society's movement towards rationalisation. Bureaucratic states justified themselves through their own rationality and were supported by expert knowledge which made them rational. Rationalisation could also be seen in the economy, with the development of a highly rational and calculating capitalism. Capitalism's rationality related to its basis in calculation, which separated it from alternative forms of economic organisation. State bureaucracy and capitalism served as the twin pillars of the developing rational society. These changes eliminated the preexisting traditions that relied on the trades. Weber also saw rationalisation as one of the main factors that set the West apart from the rest of the world. Furthermore, \"The Rational and Social Foundations of Music\" represented his application of rationalisation to music. It was influenced by his affair with the pianist Mina Tobler and a sense that Western music was the only type that had become harmonic, while other cultures' music was more intense and focused on hearing. Weber argued that music was becoming increasingly rational. In his view, that resulted from new developments in musical instrument construction and simultaneous socio-economic shifts of the different instruments' players.\nDisenchantment.\nThe process of disenchantment caused the world to become more explained and less mystical, moving from polytheistic religions to monotheistic ones and finally to the Godless science of modernity. Older explanations of events relied on the belief in supernatural interference in the material world. Due to disenchantment, this gave way to rational and scientific explanations for events. According to Weber, religious activity began with material world actions that were given magical meanings and associated with vague spirits. Over time, this became increasingly systemised and the spirits became gods, resulting in polytheism and organised religion. Increasing rationality caused Western monotheism to develop, and groups focused on specific gods for political and economic purposes, creating a universal religion. Protestantism encouraged an increased pursuit of rationality that led to the devaluing of itself. It was replaced by modern science, which was thought of as a valid alternative to religious belief. However, modern science also ceased to be a source for universal values, as it could not create values. In its place was a collection of different value systems that could not adequately replace it. This mirrored the previous state of Western polytheism, but differed from it in that its gods were stripped of any mystical qualities that their ancient counterparts had.\n\"The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism\".\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\nThe development of the concept of the calling quickly gave to the modern entrepreneur a fabulously clear conscience\u00a0\u2013 and also industrious workers; he gave to his employees as the wages of their ascetic devotion to the calling and of co-operation in his ruthless exploitation of them through capitalism the prospect of eternal salvation.\n\u2014Max Weber in \"The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism\", 1905.\n\"The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism\" is Weber's most famous work. It was his first work on how religions affected economic systems' development. In the book, he put forward the thesis that the Protestant work ethic, which was derived from the theological ideas of the Reformation, influenced the development of capitalism. Weber was looking for elective affinities between the Protestant work ethic and capitalism. He argued that the Puritans' religious calling to work caused them to systematically obtain wealth. They wished to prove that they were members of the elect who were destined to go to Heaven. Weber used Benjamin Franklin's personal ethic, as described in his \"Advice to a Young Tradesman\", as an example of the Protestant sects' economic ethic. Concepts that later became central to his scholarship, such as rationalisation and the ideal type, appeared in the thesis.\nChristian religious devotion was historically accompanied by the rejection of mundane affairs, including economic pursuit. Weber argued that the origin of modern capitalism was in the Reformation's religious ideas. According to him, certain types of Protestantism\u00a0\u2013 notably Calvinism\u00a0\u2013 were supportive of the rational pursuit of economic gain and the worldly activities that were dedicated to it, seeing those activities as having been endowed with moral and spiritual significance. The spirit of capitalism was found in the desire to work hard in a way that pleased the worker and signified their worth and originally had a basis in theology. In particular, the Protestant work ethic motivated the believers to work hard, be successful in business, and reinvest their profits in further development rather than frivolous pleasures. Weber thought that self-restraint, hard work, and a belief that wealth could be a sign of salvation were representative of ascetic Protestantism. Ascetic Protestants practiced inner-worldly asceticism and sought to change the world to better reflect their beliefs. The notion of a religious calling, when combined with predestination, meant that each individual had to take action to prove their salvation to themselves. However, the success that these religious principles created ultimately removed them as an influence on modern capitalism through their creation of a worldly perspective. As a result, rationalisation entrapped that system's inheritors in a socioeconomic iron cage.\n\"The Economic Ethics of the World Religions\".\nWeber's work in the field of sociology of religion began with the book \"The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism\". It continued with the book series \"The Economic Ethics of the World Religions\", which contained \"The Religion of China\", \"The Religion of India\", and \"Ancient Judaism\". However, his sudden death in 1920 left his work incomplete, preventing him from following \"Ancient Judaism\" with studies of early Christianity and Islam. The books' three main themes were: religious ideas' effect on economic activities, the relationship between social stratification and religious ideas, and the distinguishable characteristics of Western civilisation. His goal was to find reasons for the different developmental paths of the cultures of the Western world and the Eastern world, without making value-judgements, unlike the contemporaneous social Darwinists. Weber simply wanted to explain the distinctive elements of Western civilisation. Weber also proposed a socio-evolutionary model of religious change where societies moved from magic to ethical monotheism, with the intermediatory steps of polytheism, pantheism, and monotheism. According to him, this was the result of growing economic stability, which allowed for professionalisation and the evolution of an increasingly sophisticated priesthood. As societies grew more complex and encompassed different groups, a hierarchy of gods developed. Meanwhile, as their power became more centralised, the concept of a universal God became more popular and desirable.\n\"The Religion of China\".\nIn \"The Religion of China: Confucianism and Taoism\", Weber focused on the aspects of Chinese society that were different from those of Western Europe, especially ones that contrasted with Puritanism. As part of that, he questioned why capitalism had not developed in China. He focused on the issues of Chinese urban development, Chinese patrimonialism and officialdom and Chinese religion and philosophy\u00a0\u2013 primarily Confucianism and Taoism\u00a0\u2013 as the areas in which Chinese significantly differed from European development. According to Weber, Confucianism and Puritanism were superficially similar, but were actually very different from one another. Instead, they were mutually exclusive types of rational thought, each attempting to prescribe a way of life based on religious dogma. Notably, they both valued self-control and restraint and did not oppose accumulation of wealth. However, both of those qualities were simply means to different final goals. Confucianism's goal was \"a cultured status position\", while Puritanism's goal was to create individuals who were \"tools of God\". According to Weber, the Puritans sought rational control of the world and rejected its irrationality while Confucians sought rational acceptance of that state of affairs. Therefore, he stated that it was the difference in social attitudes and mentality, shaped by the respective dominant religions, that contributed to the development of capitalism in the West and the absence of it in China.\n\"The Religion of India\".\nIn \"The Religion of India: The Sociology of Hinduism and Buddhism\", Weber dealt with the structure of Indian society and what he interpreted as the orthodox doctrines of Hinduism and the heterodox doctrines of Buddhism and Jainism. In Weber's view, Hinduism in India, like Confucianism in China, was a barrier for capitalism. The Indian caste system, which developed in post-Classical India and served as the source for legitimate social interactions, served as a key part of that. Both Hinduism and the Brahmins' high status upheld the caste system. The Brahmins used their monopoly on education and theological authority to maintain their position. Meanwhile, Hinduism created a psychological justification for it through the cycle of reincarnation. A person's caste position was thought to have been determined by one's past-life actions. As a result, soul advancement and obeying the predetermined order were more important than seeking advancement in the material-world, including economic advancement.\nWeber ended his research of society and religion in India by bringing in insights from his previous work on China to discuss the similarities of the Asian belief systems. He noted that these religions' believers used otherworldly mystical experiences to interpret life's meaning. The social world was fundamentally divided between the educated elite who followed the guidance of a prophet or wise man and the uneducated masses whose beliefs were centered on magic. In Asia, there were no messianic prophecies to give both educated and uneducated followers meaning in their regular lives. Weber juxtaposed such Messianic prophecies, notably from the Near East, with the exemplary prophecies found in mainland Asia that focused more on reaching to the educated elites and enlightening them on the proper ways to live one's life, usually with little emphasis on hard work and the material world. It was those differences that prevented Western countries from following the paths of the earlier Chinese and Indian civilisations. His next work, \"Ancient Judaism\", was an attempt to prove this theory.\n\"Ancient Judaism\".\nIn \"Ancient Judaism\", Weber attempted to explain the factors that resulted in the early differences between Eastern and Western religiosity. He contrasted the inner-worldly asceticism developed by Western Christianity with the mystical contemplation that developed in India. Weber noted that some aspects of Christianity sought to conquer and change the world, rather than withdraw from its imperfections. This fundamental characteristic of Christianity originally stemmed from ancient Jewish prophecy. Weber classified the Jewish people as having been a pariah people, which meant that they were separated from the society that contained them. He examined the ancient Jewish people's origins and social structures. In his view, the Israelites maintained order through a covenant with the war god Yahweh and the practice of warrior asceticism. Under Solomon, that changed into a more organised and law-based society than the old confederation was. Religiously, the priests replaced the previous charismatic religious leaders. Weber thought that Elijah was the first prophet to have risen from the shepherds. Elijah promulgated political prophecies and opposed the monarchy.\nTheodicy.\nWeber used the concept of theodicy in his interpretation of theology and religion throughout his corpus. This involved both his scholarly and personal interests in the subject. It was central to his conception of humanity, which he interpreted as having a connection with finding meaning. Theodicy was a popular subject of study amongst German scholars who sought to determine how a world created by an omnibenevolent and omnipotent being can contain suffering. As part of this tradition, Weber was careful in his study of the subject. Rather than interpreting it through a theological or ethical lens, he interpreted it through a social one. Furthermore, he incorporated Friedrich Nietzsche's concept of into his discussion of the topic. However, Weber disagreed with Nietzsche's emotional discussion of and his interpretation of it as a Judaism-derived expression of slave morality.\nWeber divided theodicy into three main types:\nWeber defined the importance of societal class within religion by examining the difference between the theodicies of fortune and misfortune and to what class structures they apply. The theodicy of fortune related to successful people's desire to prove that they deserved it. They were also prone to not being satisfied with what they already had and wished to avoid the notion that they were illegitimate or sinful. Those who were unsuccessful in life believed in the theodicy of misfortune, believing wealth and happiness would later be divinely granted to those who deserved it. Another example of how this belief of religious theodicy influenced class was that those of lower economic status tended towards deep religiousness and faith as a way to comfort themselves and provide hope for a more prosperous future, while those of higher economic status preferred the sacraments or actions that proved their right to possess greater wealth.\nThe state, politics, and government.\nWeber defined the state as an entity that had a monopoly on violence. This meant that the state could legitimately use force to preserve itself within a given area. He also proposed that politics was the sharing of state power and influencing the distribution thereof between states and between groups within a state. Weber's definition of a politician required that they have passion, judgement, and responsibility. He divided action into the oppositional and \"verantwortungsethik\" (the \"ethic of ultimate ends\" and the \"ethic of responsibility\"). A adherent justified their actions through their consequences. Meanwhile, a adherent justified their actions through their ideals. While Weber thought that an ideal politician possessed both of them, he associated them with different types of people and mindsets. Combining them required that a politician be passionate about their goals and pragmatic about achieving them.\nWeber distinguished three ideal types of legitimate authority:\nIn his view, all historical relationships between rulers and ruled contained these elements, which could be analysed on the basis of this tripartite classification of authority. Charismatic authority was held by individuals who held power through their charisma, meaning that their power originated from extraordinary personal qualities. It was unstable, as it resisted institutionalisation and relied on the leader's success. Over time, it was forced to be routinised into more structured forms of authority. An administrative structure would be formed by the charismatic leader's followers. Traditional authority was based on loyalty to preestablished traditions and those who held authority as a result of those traditions. For Weber, patriarchalism\u00a0\u2013 the rule by a patriarch over a family\u00a0\u2013 was the most important variety of traditional authority. Patrimonialism\u00a0\u2013 a closely related concept to patriarchalism\u00a0\u2013 was a type of traditional authority where rulers treated the government and military as extensions of their households. Rational-legal authority relied on bureaucracy and belief in both the legality of the society's rules and the legitimacy of those who held power as a result of those rules. Unlike the other types of authority, it developed gradually. That was the result of legal systems ability to exist without charismatic individuals or traditions.\nBureaucracy.\nWeber's commentary on societal bureaucratisation is one of the most prominent parts of his work. According to him, bureaucracy was the most efficient societal organisation method and the most formally rational system. It was necessary for modern society to function and would be difficult to destroy. Bureaucratic officials felt superior to non-bureaucrats, had a strong sense of duty, and had fixed salaries that disinclined them to pursue monetary acquisition. Bureaucracy was less likely to be found among elected officials. Furthermore, Bureaucracy's treatment of all people without regard for individuals suited capitalism well. It was also a requirement for both modern capitalism and modern socialism to exist. This depersonalisation related to its increased efficiency. Bureaucrats could not openly make arbitrary decisions or base them on personal favours. As the most efficient and rational way of organising, bureaucratisation was the key part of rational-legal authority. Furthermore, he saw it as the key process in the ongoing rationalisation of Western society.\nWeber listed six characteristics of an ideal type of bureaucracy:\nThe development of communication and transportation technologies made more efficient administration possible and popularly requested. Meanwhile, the democratisation and rationalisation of culture resulted in demands that the new system treat everyone equally. Weber's ideal type of bureaucracy was characterised by hierarchical organisation, delineated lines of authority in a fixed area of activity, action taken on the basis of written rules, bureaucratic officials needing expert training, rules being implemented neutrally, and career advancement depending on technical qualifications judged by organisations. While arguing that bureaucracy was the most efficient form of organisation and was indispensable for the modern state, Weber was also critical of it. In his view, an inescapable bureaucratisation of society would happen in the future. He also thought that a hypothetical victory of socialism over capitalism would have not prevented that. Economic and political organisations needed entrepreneurs and politicians in order to counteract bureaucrats. Otherwise, they would be stifled by bureaucracy.\nSocial stratification.\nWeber also formulated a three-component theory of stratification that contained the conceptually distinct elements of class, status, and party. This distinction was most clearly described in his essay \"The Distribution of Power Within the : Classes, , Parties\", which was first published in his book \"Economy and Society\". Status served as one of the central ways in which people were ranked in society. As part of it, issues of honour and prestige were important. With regards to class, the theory placed heavy emphasis on class conflict and private property as having been key to its definition. While Weber drew upon Marx's interpretation of class conflict in his definition of class, he did not see it as having defined all social relations and stratification. Political parties were not given as much attention by Weber as the other two components were, as he thought that they were not particularly effectual in their actions. Their purpose was to seek power to benefit their members materially or ideologically.\nThe three components of Weber's theory were:\nWeber's concept of status emerged from his farm labour and the stock exchange studies, as he found social relationships that were unexplainable through economic class alone. The Junkers had social rules regarding marriage between different social levels and farm labourers had a strong sense of independence, neither of which was economically based. Weber maintained a sharp distinction between the terms \"status\" and \"class\", although non-scholars tend to use them interchangeably in casual use. Status and its focus on honour emerged from the , which denoted the part of society where loyalty originated from. Class emerged from the , a subdivision of the that included rationally driven markets and legal organisations. Parties emerged from a combination of the two. Weber interpreted life chances, the opportunities to improve one's life, as a definitional aspect of class. They related to the differences in access to opportunities that different people might have had in their lives. The relationship between status and class was not straightforward. One of them could lead to the other, but an individual or group could succeed in one but not the other.\nThe vocation lectures.\nTowards the end of his life, Weber gave two lectures, \"Science as a Vocation\" and \"Politics as a Vocation\", at the Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich on the subjects of the scientific and political vocations. The Free Student Youth, a left-liberal student organisation, had their spokesperson, Immanuel Birnbaum, invite him to give the lectures. In \"Science as a Vocation\", he argued that a scholar needed to possess an inner calling. Weber thought that only a particular type of person was able to have an academic career, stating that the path forward in scholarship required the scholar to be methodical in their research and understand that they might not succeed. Specialisation was also an aspect of modern scholarship that a scholar needed to engage in. Disenchantment and intellectual rationalisation were major aspects of his commentary on the scholar's role in modernity. These processes resulted in scholarship's value being questioned. Weber argued that scholarship could provide certainty through its starting presumptions, despite its inability to give absolute answers. Meanwhile, \"Politics as a Vocation\" commented on the subject of politics. Weber was responding to the early Weimar Republic's political instability. He argued that politicians had passion, judgement, and responsibility. There was also a division between conviction and responsibility. While these two concepts were sharply divided, it was possible for single individual\u00a0\u2013 particularly the ideal politician\u00a0\u2013 to possess both of them. He also divided legitimate authority into the three categories of traditional, charismatic, and rational-legal authority. Towards the lecture's end, he described politics as \"a slow, powerful drilling through hard boards\". Ultimately, Weber thought that the political issues of his day required consistent effort to resolve, rather than the quick solutions that the students preferred.\n\"The City\".\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\nThe origin of a rational and inner-worldly ethic is associated in the Occident with the appearance of thinkers and prophets... who developed in a social context that was alien to the Asiatic cultures. This context consisted of the political problems engendered by the bourgeois status-group of the city, without which neither Judaism, nor Christianity, nor the development of Hellenistic thinking are conceivable.\n\u2014Max Weber in \"The City\", 1921.\nAs part of his overarching effort to understand the Western world's unique development, Weber wrote a general study of the European city and its development in antiquity and the Middle Ages titled \"The City\". According to him, Christianity broke the kinship traditional bonds by causing its believers to participate in the religion as individuals. However, the institutions that formed as a result of this process were secular in nature. He also saw the rise of a unique form of non-legitimate domination in medieval European cities that successfully challenged the existing forms of legitimate domination\u00a0\u2013 traditional, charismatic, and rational-legal\u00a0\u2013 that had prevailed until then in the medieval world. These cities were previously under the jurisdiction of several different entities that were removed as they became autonomous. That process was caused by the granting of privileges to newer cities and the usurpation of authority in older ones.\nEconomics.\nWeber primarily regarded himself as an economist, and all of his professorial appointments were in economics, but his contributions to that field were largely overshadowed by his role as a founder of modern sociology. As a political economist and economic historian, Weber belonged to the German historical school of economics, represented by academics such as Gustav von Schmoller and his student Werner Sombart. While Weber's research interests were largely in line with this school, his views on methodology and marginal utility significantly diverged from those of the other German historicists. Instead, they were closer to those of Carl Menger and the Austrian school of economics, the historical school's traditional rivals. The division caused by the caused Weber to support a broad interpretation of economics that combined economic theory, economic history, and economic sociology in the form of \"Sozial\u00f6konomik\" (\"social economics\").\n\"Economy and Society\".\nWeber's \"Economy and Society\" is an essay collection that he was working on at the time of his death in 1920. It included a wide range of essays dealing with Weber's views regarding sociology, social philosophy, politics, social stratification, world religion, diplomacy, and other subjects. The text was largely unfinished, outside of the first three chapters. These chapters were written between 1919 and 1920. They relate to sociology, economic sociology, authority, and class and status groups, respectively. The first chapter is one of the two portions of the text that Weberian scholars consult most frequently\u00a0\u2013 alongside the third chapter\u00a0\u2013 and moved from a discussion of individuals' social actions to the centrality of the monopoly on violence to the state. Meanwhile, the second chapter is less discussed, as it represented a type of economic theory that had fallen out of style amongst economists after the 1930s. It presented an analytical economic history that contained a discussion of the origins of capitalism and supported the idea that the Austrian and historical schools of economics could have a methodological synthesis. Chapter three focused on Weber's tripartite definition of legitimate authority. Since the final chapter was unfinished, it was largely a brief set of classifications of classes and (\"statuses\").\nAfter Weber's death, the final organisation and editing of the book fell to his widow Marianne. She was assisted by the economist Melchior Palyi. The resulting volume was published in 1922 and was titled . It also included additional texts that were generally written between 1909 and 1914 that his widow had found amongst his belongings. In 1956, the German jurist Johannes Winckelmann edited and organised a revised 4th edition of \"Economy and Society\", later editing a 5th edition of it in 1976. Guenther Roth and Claus Wittich edited an English translation of the work in 1968. It was based on Winckelmann's 1956 edition of the text that he had revised in 1964. The \"Max Weber-Gesamtausgabe\" editors published \"Economy and Society\" in six parts, with the first devoted to the first four chapters thereof. The remaining five parts were organised in chronological order based on when they were written. In 2019, Keith Tribe published a revised English translation of the \"Max Weber-Gesamtausgabe\" edition of its first four chapters.\nMarginal utility.\nUnlike other historicists, Weber accepted marginal utility and taught it to his students. His overall economic sociology was based on it. In 1908, Weber published an article, \"Marginal Utility Theory and 'The Fundamental Law of Psychophysics'\", in which he argued that marginal utility and economics were not based on psychology. As part of that, he disputed Lujo Brentano's claim that marginal utility reflected the form of the psychological response to stimuli as described by the Weber\u2013Fechner law. He rejected the idea that marginal utility and economics were dependent on psychophysics. In general, Weber disagreed with the idea that economics relied on another field. He also included a similar discussion of marginal utility in the second chapter of \"Economy and Society\". Both marginal utility and declining utility's roles in his writings were implied through his usage of instrumentally rational action in that chapter.\nEconomic calculation.\nLike his colleague Werner Sombart, Weber regarded economic calculation, particularly double-entry bookkeeping, as having played a significant role in rationalisation and the development of capitalism. Weber's preoccupation with the importance of economic calculation led him to critique socialism as lacking a mechanism to efficiently allocate resources to satisfy human needs. Otto Neurath, a socialist thinker, thought that prices would not exist and central planners would use in-kind, rather than monetary, economic calculation in a completely socialised economy. According to Weber, this type of coordination was inefficient because it was incapable of solving the problem of imputation, which related to the difficulties in accurately determining the relative values of capital goods. Weber wrote that the value of goods had to be determined in a socialist economy. However, there was no clear method for doing so in that economic system. Planned economies were, therefore, irrational. At approximately the same time, Ludwig von Mises independently made the same argument against socialism. Weber himself significantly influenced Mises, whom he had befriended when they were both at the University of Vienna in the spring of 1918. However, Mises ultimately regarded him as a historian, rather than an economist.\nInspirations.\nWeber was strongly influenced by German idealism, particularly by neo-Kantianism. He was exposed to it by Heinrich Rickert, who was his professorial colleague at the University of Freiburg. The neo-Kantian belief that reality was essentially chaotic and incomprehensible, with all rational order deriving from the way the human mind focused its attention on certain aspects of reality and organised the resulting perceptions was particularly important to Weber's scholarship. His opinions regarding social scientific methodology showed parallels with the work of the contemporary neo-Kantian philosopher and sociologist Georg Simmel. Weber was also influenced by Kantian ethics more generally, but he came to think of them as being obsolete in a modern age that lacked religious certainties. His interpretation of Kant and neo-Kantianism was pessimistic as a result.\nWeber was responding to Friedrich Nietzsche's philosophy's effect on modern thought. His goal in the field of ethics was to find non-arbitrarily defined freedom in what he interpreted as a post-metaphysical age. That represented a division between the parts of his thought that represented Kantianism and Nietzscheanism. After his debate with Oswald Spengler in 1920, Weber said that the world was significantly intellectually influenced by Nietzsche and Marx. In \"The Protestant Work Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism\" and \"Science as a Vocation\", Weber negatively described \"\" (\"the 'last men'\"), who were Nietzschean \"specialists without spirit\" who he warned about in both texts. Similarly, he also used Nietzsche's concept of in his discussion of theodicy, but he interpreted it differently. Weber disliked Nietzsche's emotional approach to the subject and did not interpret it as a type of Judaism-derived slave morality.\nWhile a student in Charlottenburg, Weber read all forty of Johann Friedrich Cotta's volumes of Johann Wolfgang von Goethe works, which later influenced his methodology and concepts. For him, Goethe was one of the seminal figures in German history. In his writings, including \"The Protestant Work Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism\", Weber quoted Goethe on several occasions. His usage of \"elective affinity\" in his writings may have been derived from Goethe, as one of Goethe's works used it as its title. Weber was also influenced by Goethe's usage of the Greek (\"fate\"). That concept influenced Weber's perspective that one's fate was inevitable and that one was able to use experience to create intellectual passion. He thought that Goethe, his Faust, and Nietzsche's Zarathustra were figures that represented the and expressed the quality of human action by ceaselessly striving for knowledge.\nKarl Marx's writings and socialist thought in academia and active politics were also major influences on Weber's works. While Weber agreed with Marx on the importance of social conflict, he did not think that it would destroy a society if the traditions that upheld it were valued more than it was. Furthermore, he thought that a social conflict would have been resolvable within the preexisting social system. Writing in 1932, Karl L\u00f6with contrasted the works of Marx and Weber, arguing that both were interested in Western capitalism's causes and effects, but viewed it through different lenses. Marx viewed capitalism through the lens of alienation, while Weber interpreted it through rationalisation. Weber also expanded Marx's interpretation of alienation from the specific idea of the worker who was alienated from his work to similar situations that involved intellectuals and bureaucrats. Scholars during the Cold War frequently interpreted Weber as \"a bourgeois answer to Marx\", but he was instead responding to the issues that were relevant to the bourgeoisie in Wilhelmine Germany. In that regard, he focused on the conflict between rationality and irrationality.\nLegacy.\nAlongside Karl Marx and \u00c9mile Durkheim, Weber is commonly regarded as one of modern sociology's founders. He was instrumental in developing an antipositivist, hermeneutic, tradition in the social sciences. Weber influenced many scholars across the political spectrum. Left-leaning social theorists\u00a0\u2013 such as Theodor W. Adorno, Max Horkheimer, Gy\u00f6rgy Luk\u00e1cs, and J\u00fcrgen Habermas\u00a0\u2013 were influenced by his discussion of modernity and its friction with modernisation. As part of that, his analysis of modernity and rationalisation significantly influenced the Frankfurt School's critical theory. Right-leaning scholars\u00a0\u2013 including Carl Schmitt, Joseph Schumpeter, Leo Strauss, Hans Morgenthau, and Raymond Aron\u00a0\u2013 emphasised different elements of his thought. They focused on his discussion of strong leaders in democracy, political ethics' relationship with value-freedom and value-relativism, and combating bureaucracy through political action. The scholars who have examined his works philosophically, including Strauss, Hans Henrik Bruun, and Alfred Sch\u00fctz, have traditionally looked at them through the lens of Continental philosophy.\nWeber studies.\nWeberian scholarship's beginnings were delayed by the disruption of academic life in the Weimar Republic. Hyper-inflation caused Weber's support for parliamentary democracy to be countered by the declining respect that German professors had for it. Their political alienation caused many of them to become pessimistic and closer to the historical viewpoints espoused by Oswald Spengler in his \"The Decline of the West\". Furthermore, universities increasingly came under state control and influence, which accelerated after the Nazi Party took power. The previously dominant style of sociology, that of Alfred Vierkandt and Leopold von Wiese, was largely replaced by a sociology that was dominated by support for the Nazis. Hans Freyer and Othmar Spann were representative of that movement, while Werner Sombart began to support collectivism and Nazism. The Nazi Party's rise had marginalised Weber's scholarship in the German academy. However, some Weberian scholars had left Germany during this time, with most of them settling in the United States and the United Kingdom.\nThese scholars entered American and British academia when Weber's writings, such as the \"General Economic History\", were beginning to be translated into English. Talcott Parsons, an American scholar, was influenced by his readings of Weber and Sombart as a student in Germany during the 1920s. He obtained permission from Marianne Weber to publish a translation of \"The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism\" in his 1930 essay collection, the \"Collected Essays on the Sociology of Religion\". This translated version, which the publisher heavily edited, was not initially successful. Parsons used this translation as part of his effort to create an academic sociology, which resulted in his 1937 book \"The Structure of Social Action\". In it, Parsons argued that Weber and Durkheim were foundational sociologists. However, his book was not successful until after the Second World War. He then published a translation of \"Economy and Society\" as \"The Theory of Social and Economic Organization\". Parsons's increasing scholarly prominence led to this volume's own elevated influence. Other translations began to appear, including C. Wright Mills and Hans Gerth's \"\" in 1946, which was a collection of excerpts from Weber's writings. In the last year of the decade, Edward Shils edited a translation of Weber's \"Collected Essays on Methodology\", which was published as \"The Methodology of the Social Sciences\".\nAs the 1940s ended, Weber's scholarly reputation rose as a result of scholarly interpretations of it through the lenses of Parsons's structural functionalism and Mills's conflict theory. Over the course of the following decades, continued publications of translations of Weber's works began to appear, including ones on law, religion, music, and the city. Despite the translations' flaws, it became possible to obtain a largely complete view of Weber's scholarship. That was still impeded by the unorganised publishing of the translations, which prevented scholars from knowing the connections between the different texts. In 1968, a complete translation of Marianne Weber's prepared version of \"Economy and Society\" was published. While an interpretation of Weber that was separate from Parson's structural functionalism began with \"From Max Weber\", a more political and historical interpretation was forwarded by Reinhard Bendix's 1948 \"\", Ralf Dahrendorf's 1957 \"Class and Conflict in an Industrial Society\", and John Rex's 1962 \"Key Problems in Sociological Theory\". While this was going on, the 1964 centennial conference on Max Weber was held in Heidelberg. It featured a controversy over whether Weber's concept of charismatic authority played a role in Nazi Germany's rise. A year later, Raymond Aron's \"Main Currents in Sociological Thought\" gave an alternative to Parson's perspective on the history of sociology and framed Weber, Marx, and Durkheim as the three foundational figures. Anthony Giddens's 1971 \"Capitalism and Modern Social Theory\" solidified that interpretation. After the 1970s ended, more of Weber's less prominent publications were published. That effort coincided with the continued writing of critical commentaries on his works and ideas, including the creation of a scholarly journal in 2000\u00a0\u2013 \"Max Weber Studies\"\u00a0\u2013 that is devoted to such scholarship. Additionally, the Max Weber Foundation was founded in 2002 as the managing body for all ten German Institutes of the Humanities. Weber's death centenary in 2020 provoked several scholarly conferences that were held online as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nThe idea of publishing a collected edition of Weber's complete works was pushed forward by Horst Baier in 1972. A year later, the \"Max Weber-Gesamtausgabe\", a multi-volume set of all of his writings, began to take shape. Wolfgang J. Mommsen, Wolfgang Schluchter, Johannes Winckelmann, M. Rainer Lepsius, and Horst Baier were the initial editors. After Mommsen's death in 2004, Gangolf H\u00fcbinger succeeded him. Winckelmann, Lepsius, and Baier also died before its completion. The writings were organised in a combination of chronological order and by subject, with the material that Weber did not intend to publish in purely chronological order. The final editions of each text were used, with the exception of \"The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism\", which was published in both its first and final forms. Mohr Siebeck was selected to publish the volumes. The project was presented to the academic community in 1981 with the publication of a prospectus that was colloquially referred to as the \"green brochure\". It outlined the series' three sections: \"Writings and Speeches\", \"Letters\", and \"Lecture Manuscripts and Lecture Notes\". Four years later, the project entered publication. It concluded in June 2020 and contains forty-seven volumes, including two index volumes.\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nGeneral and cited sources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

These concerns became fundamental to critical theory.\nHis most influential works include \"Eclipse of Reason\" (1947), \"Dialectic of Enlightenment\" (1947, with Theodor W. Adorno), and a series of foundational essays written in the 1930s for the \"Zeitschrift f\u00fcr Sozialforschung\", later collected in \"Between Philosophy and Social Science\" and \"Critical Theory: Selected Essays\". He also composed aphoristic reflections between the late 1920s and the 1960s, published posthumously as \"D\u00e4mmerung\" (\"Dawn and Decline\"). As director of the Institute, Horkheimer planned, supported, and made possible many other significant works.\nBiography.\nEarly life.\nOn 14 February 1895, Horkheimer was born the only son of Moritz and Babetta Horkheimer. Horkheimer was born into a conservative, wealthy Orthodox Jewish family. His father was a successful businessman who owned several textile factories in the Zuffenhausen district of Stuttgart, where Max was born. Moritz expected his son to follow in his footsteps and own the family business.\nMax was taken out of school in 1910 to work in the family business, where he eventually became a junior manager. During this period he would begin two relationships that would last for the rest of his life. First, he met Friedrich Pollock, who would later become a close academic colleague, and who would remain Max's closest friend. He also met Rose Riekher, his father's personal secretary. Eight years Max's senior, a Christian, and from a lower economic class, Riekher was not considered a suitable match by Moritz Horkheimer. Despite this, Max and Maidon would marry in 1926 and remain together until her death in 1969.\nIn 1917, his manufacturing career ended and his chances of taking over his family business were interrupted when he was drafted into World War I. However, Horkheimer avoided service, being rejected on medical grounds.\nEducation.\nIn the spring of 1919, after failing an army physical, Horkheimer enrolled at Munich University. While living in Munich, he was mistaken for the revolutionary playwright Ernst Toller and arrested and imprisoned.\nAfter being released, Horkheimer moved to Frankfurt am Main, where he studied philosophy and psychology under Hans Cornelius. There, he met Theodor Adorno, several years his junior, with whom he would strike a lasting friendship and a collaborative relationship. After an abortive attempt at writing a dissertation on Gestalt psychology, Horkheimer, with Cornelius's direction, completed his doctorate in philosophy with a 78-page dissertation titled \"The Antinomy of Teleological Judgment\" (). In 1925, Horkheimer was habilitated with a dissertation entitled \"Kant's Critique of Judgment as Mediation between Practical and Theoretical Philosophy\" (). There, he met Friedrich Pollock, who would be his colleague at the University of Frankfurt Institute for Social Research. The following year, Max was appointed \"Privatdozent\". Shortly after, in 1926, Horkheimer married Rose Riekher.\nInstitute of Social Research (Institut f\u00fcr Sozialforschung).\nIn 1926, Horkheimer was an \"unsalaried lecturer in Frankfurt.\" Shortly after, in 1930, he was promoted to professor of philosophy at the University of Frankfurt am Main. In the same year, when the Institute for Social Research's directorship became vacant, after the departure of Carl Gr\u00fcnberg, Horkheimer was elected to the position \"by means of an endowment from a wealthy businessman\". The Institute had had its beginnings in a Marxist study group started by Felix Weil, a one-time student of political science at Frankfurt who used his inheritance to fund the group as a way to support his leftist academic aims. Pollock and Horkheimer were partners with Weil in the early activities of the institute.\nHorkheimer worked to make the Institute a purely academic enterprise. As director, he changed the institute from an orthodox Marxist school to a heterodox school for critical social research. The following year publication of the institute's \"Zeitschrift f\u00fcr Sozialforschung\" began, with Horkheimer as its editor.\nHorkheimer intellectually reoriented the institute, proposing a programme of collective research aimed at specific social groups (specifically the working class) that would highlight the problem of the relationship between history and reason. The Institute focused on integrating the views of Karl Marx and Sigmund Freud. The Frankfurt School attempted this by systematically hitching together the different conceptual structures of historical materialism and psychoanalysis.\nDuring the time between Horkheimer's being named Professor of Social Philosophy and director of the Institute in 1930, the Nazi party became the second largest party in the Reichstag. In the midst of the violence surrounding the Nazis' rise, Horkheimer and his associates began to prepare for the possibility of moving the Institute out of Germany. Horkheimer's \"venia legendi\" was revoked by the new Nazi government because of the Marxian nature of the institute's ideas as well as its prominent Jewish association. When Hitler was named the Chancellor in 1933, the institute was thus forced to close its location in Germany.\nHe emigrated to Geneva, Switzerland, and then to New York City the following year, where Horkheimer met with president of Columbia University Nicholas Murray Butler to discuss hosting the institute. To Horkheimer's surprise, the president agreed to host the Institute in exile as well as offer Horkheimer a building for the institute. In July 1934, Horkheimer accepted an offer from Columbia University to relocate the institute to one of their buildings.\nIn 1940, Horkheimer received American citizenship and moved to the Pacific Palisades district of Los Angeles, California, where his collaboration with Adorno would yield the \"Dialectic of Enlightenment.\" In 1942, Horkheimer assumed the directorship of the Scientific Division of the American Jewish Committee. In this capacity, he helped launch and organize a series of five Studies in Prejudice, which were published in 1949 and 1950. The most important of these was the pioneering study in social psychology entitled \"The Authoritarian Personality\", itself a methodologically advanced reworking of some of the themes treated in a collective project produced by the Institute in its first years of exile, Studies in Authority and Family.\nReturn to Germany.\nIn 1949, he returned to Frankfurt, where the Institute for Social Research reopened in 1950. In the years that followed, Horkheimer did not publish much, although he continued to edit \"Studies in Philosophy and Social Science\" as a continuation of the \"Zeitschrift.\" Between 1951 and 1953 Horkheimer was rector of the University of Frankfurt am Main. In 1953, Horkheimer stepped down from director of the Institute and took on a smaller role in the institute, while Adorno became director.\nHorkheimer continued to teach at the university until his retirement in the mid-1960s. In 1953, he was awarded the Goethe Plaque of the City of Frankfurt, and was later named an honorary citizen of Frankfurt for life. He returned to the United States in 1954 and 1959 to lecture as a frequent visiting professor at the University of Chicago. \nPersonal life and death.\nMax and Maidon married in 1926 and remained together until her death in 1969. They moved to Montagnola, Ticino in 1957. He died after a routine examination in Nuremberg in 1973 and was buried in the Jewish cemetery of Bern next to his wife.\nIn the late 1960s, Horkheimer supported Pope Paul VI's stand against artificial contraception, specifically the pill, arguing that it would lead to the end of romantic love.\nLegacy.\nHe remained an important figure until his death Max Horkheimer with the help of Theodor Adorno, Herbert Marcuse, Walter Benjamin, Leo L\u00f6wenthal, Otto Kirchheimer, Frederick Pollock and Franz Neumann developed \"Critical Theory\". According to Larry Ray \"Critical Theory\" has \"become one of the most influential social theories of the twentieth century\".\nThought.\nHorkheimer's work is marked by a concern to show the relation between affect (especially suffering) and concepts (understood as action-guiding expressions of reason). In that, he responded critically to what he saw as the one-sidedness of both neo-Kantianism (with its focus on concepts) and \"Lebensphilosophie\" (with its focus on expression and world-disclosure). He did not think that either was wrong, but he insisted that the insights of each school on its own could not adequately contribute to the repair of social problems. Horkheimer focused on the connections between social structures, networks/subcultures and individual realities and concluded that we are affected and shaped by the proliferation of products on the marketplace. It is also important to note that Horkheimer collaborated with Herbert Marcuse, Erich Fromm, Theodor Adorno, and Walter Benjamin.\nCritical theory.\nThrough critical theory, a social theory focusing on critiquing and changing society, Horkheimer \"attempted to revitalize radical social, and cultural criticism\" and discussed authoritarianism, militarism, economic disruption, environmental crisis and the poverty of mass culture. Horkheimer helped to create critical theory through a mix of radical and conservative lenses that stem from radical Marxism and end up in \"pessimistic Jewish transcendentalism\".\nHe developed his critical theory by examining his own wealth while witnessing the juxtaposition of the bourgeois and the impoverished. This critical theory embraced the future possibilities of society and was preoccupied with forces which moved society toward rational institutions that would ensure a true, free, and just life. He was convinced of the need to \"examine the entire material and spiritual culture of mankind\" in order to transform society as a whole. Horkheimer sought to enable the working class to reclaim their power in order to resist the lure of fascism. Horkheimer stated himself that \"the rationally organized society that regulates its own existence\" was necessary along with a society that could \"satisfy common needs\". To satisfy these needs, it reached out for a total understanding of history and knowledge. Through this, critical theory develops a \"critique of bourgeois society through which 'ideology critique' attempted to locate the 'utopian content' of dominant systems of thought\". Above all, critical theory sought to develop a critical perspective in the discussion of all social practices.\nWriting.\n\"Between Philosophy and Social Science\".\n\"Between Philosophy and Social Science\" appeared between 1930 and 1938, during the time the Frankfurt school moved from Frankfurt to Geneva to Columbia University. It included: \"Materialism and Morality\", \"The Present Situation of Moral Philosophy and the Tasks of an Institute for Social Research\", \"On the Problem of Truth\", \"Egoism and the Freedom Movement\", \"History and Psychology\", \"A New Concept of Ideology\", \"Remarks on Philosophical Anthropology\", and \"The Rationalism Debate in Contemporary Philosophy\". It also included \"The Present Situation of Social Philosophy and the Tasks for an Institute of Social Research\", \"Egoism and Freedom Movements\" and \"Beginnings of the Bourgeois Philosophy of History\". The essays within \"Between Philosophy and Social Science\" were Horkheimer's attempts to \"remove the individual from mass culture, a function for philosophy from the commodification of everything\". Horkheimer was extremely invested in the individual. In one of his writings, he states, \"When we speak of an individual as a historical entity, we mean not merely the space-time and the sense existence of a particular member of the human race, but in addition, his awareness of his own individuality as a conscious human being, including recognition of his own identity.\"\n\"The Present Situation of Social Philosophy and the Tasks for an Institute of Social Research\" was not only included in this volume, but it was also used as Horkheimer's inaugural speech as director of the Frankfurt School. In this speech he related economic groups to the struggles and challenges of real life. Horkheimer often referenced human struggle and used this example in his speech because it was a topic he understood well.\n\"Egoism and Freedom Movements\" and \"Beginnings of the Bourgeois Philosophy of History\" are the longest of the essays. The first is an evaluation of Machiavelli, Hobbes and Vico; the latter discusses the bourgeois control. In Beginnings of the Bourgeois Philosophy of History, Horkheimer explained \"what he learned from the bourgeois rise to power and what of the bourgeois he thought was worth preserving.\nThe volume also looks at the individual as the \"troubled center of philosophy.\" Horkheimer expressed that \"there is no formula that defines the relationship among individuals, society and nature for all time\". To understand the problem of the individual further, Horkheimer included two case studies on the individual: one on Montaigne and one on himself.\n\"Eclipse of Reason\".\nHorkheimer's book, \"Eclipse of Reason\", started in 1941 and published in 1947, is broken into five sections: Means and Ends, Conflicting Panaceas, The Revolt of Nature, The Rise and Decline of the Individual, and On the Concept of Philosophy. The \"Eclipse of Reason\" focuses on the concept of reason within the history of Western philosophy, which can only be fostered in an environment of free, critical thinking while also linking positivist and instrumental reason with the rise of fascism. He distinguishes between objective, subjective and instrumental reason, and states that we have moved from the former through the center and into the latter (though subjective and instrumental reason are closely connected). Objective reason deals with universal truths that dictate that an action is either right or wrong. It is a concrete concept and a force in the world that requires specific modes of behavior. The focus in the objective faculty of reason is on the ends, rather than the means. Subjective reason is an abstract concept of reason, and focuses primarily on means. Specifically, the reasonable nature of the purpose of action is irrelevant \u2013 the ends only serve the purpose of the subject (generally self-advancement or preservation). To be \"reasonable\" in this context is to be suited to a particular purpose, to be \"good for something else\". This aspect of reason is universally conforming, and easily furnishes ideology. In instrumental reason, the sole criterion of reason is its operational value or purposefulness, and with this, the idea of truth becomes contingent on mere subjective preference (hence the relation with subjective reason). Because subjective/instrumental reason rules, the ideals of a society, for example democratic ideals, become dependent on the \"interests\" of the people instead of being dependent on objective truths. Horkheimer writes, \"Social power is today more than ever mediated by power over things. The more intense an individual's concern with power over things, the more will things dominate him, the more will he lack any genuine individual traits, and the more will his mind be transformed into an automation of formalized reason.\"\nHorkheimer acknowledges that objective reason has its roots in Reason (\"Logos\" in Greek) and concludes, \"If by enlightenment and intellectual progress we mean the freeing of man from superstitious belief in evil forces, in demons and fairies, in blind fate \u2013 in short, the emancipation from fear \u2013 then denunciation of what is currently called reason is the greatest service we can render.\"\n\"Dialectic of Enlightenment\".\nMax Horkheimer and Theodor Adorno collaborated to publish \"Dialectic of Enlightenment\", which was originally published in 1944. The inspiration for this piece came from when Horkheimer and Adorno had to flee Germany, because of Hitler, and go to New York. They went to America and \"absorbed the popular culture\"; thinking that it was a form of totalitarianism. Nonetheless, Dialectic of Enlightenment's main argument was to serve as a wide-ranging critique of the \"self-destruction of enlightenment\". The work criticized popular culture as \"the product of a culture industry whose goal was to stupefy the masses with endless mass produced copies of the same thing\" (Lemert). Along with that, Horkheimer and Adorno had a few arguments; one being that these mass-produced products only appear to change over time. Horkheimer and Adorno stated that these products were so standardized in order to help consumers comprehend and appreciate the products with little attention given to them. They expressed, \"the result is a constant reproduction of the same thing\" (Adorno and Horkheimer, 1993 [1944]). However, they also explain how pseudo-individuality is encouraged among these products in order to keep the consumers coming back for more. They argue that small differences in products within the same area are acceptable.\nThe similar patterns found in the content of popular culture (films, popular songs and radio) have the same central message; \"it's all linked to \"the necessity of obedience of the masses to the social hierarchy in place in advanced capitalist societies\". These products appeal to the masses and encourage conformity to the consumers. In return, capitalism remains in power while buyers continue to consume from the industry. This is dangerous because the consumers' belief that the powers of technology are liberating, starts to increase. To support their claim, Horkheimer and Adorno, \"proposed an antidote: not just thinking the relations of \"things\", but also, as an immediate second step, thinking \"through\" that thinking, self-reflexively.\" In other words, technology lacks self-reflexivity. Nonetheless, Horkheimer and Adorno believed that art was an exception, because it \"is an open-ended system with no fixed rules\"; thus, it could not be an object of the industry.\nCriticisms.\nPerry Anderson sees Horkheimer's attempt to make the Institute purely academic as \"symptomatic of a more universal process, the emergence of a 'Western Marxism' divorced from the working-class movement and dominated by academic philosophers and the 'product of defeat'\" because of the isolation of the Russian Revolution. Rolf Wiggershaus, author of \"The Frankfurt School\" believed Horkheimer lacked the audacious theoretical construction produced by those like Marx and Luk\u00e1cs and that his main argument was that those living in misery had the right to material egoism. In his book, \"Social Theory\", Alex Callinicos claims that \"Dialectic of Enlightenment\" offers no systematic account of conception of rationality, but rather professes objective reason intransigently to an extent. Charles Lemert discusses in his book \"Social Theory\" that in writing \"Dialectic of Enlightenment\", Horkheimer and Adorno lack sufficient sympathy for the cultural plight of the average working person, unfair to criticize the tastes of ordinary people, and that popular culture does not really buttress social conformity and stabilize capitalism as much as the Frankfurt school thinks.\nIngar Solty, in a February 2020 \"Jacobin\" magazine article, notes that the work of Horkheimer, Adorno, and the Frankfurt School as a whole is marked by \"the vast historical defeats suffered by the interwar socialist movement.\" He notes, \"Horkheimer and Adorno thus became increasingly pessimistic with regards to the working class's ability to overthrow capitalism ... Horkheimer did not conduct empirical research on capitalism and its crises ... the hierarchical nature of the international division of labor, the organization of internationalizing capitalism in a system of nation-states, the origins of imperialism and inter-imperial rivalries, or such ... For Horkheimer, the working class had been a revolutionary subject only in the abstract ... [it] was essentially an empty placeholder for the subject which would overthrow an economic and social system which they considered wrong. If it failed to live up to its expectations, then it could easily be replaced by another subject of revolution\u2014or the conclusion that there was no way out (of capitalism).\"\nSolty contextualizes Horkheimer's (and, by implication, the Frankfurt School's) \"return from 'revolutionary optimism' to 'revolutionary pessimism'\" by noting, \"[m]any postwar radical leftists and anti-capitalists, especially those not organized in real workers' parties, were disappointed revolutionaries. The German writer Alfred Andersch, who had been close to the KPD before 1933 and then withdrawn into \"inner emigration,\" called the West German postwar left a \"homeless left.\" The working classes' betrayals seemed to continue after 1945. After the short-lived socialist revival, the Cold War and the internationalization of the New Deal as the Keynesian welfare state seemed to have completely absorbed what was left of revolutionary working-class spirit. This led many disappointed leftists to culture and ideology as levels of analyses which could explain this failure of the working class.\" Solty identifies Horkheimer's (and, implicitly, the Frankfurt School's) work as an important influence on that of Michel Foucault:Ultimately, both Horkheimer and Foucault only considered the defense of remaining elements of freedom and the identification of \"micro-powers\" of domination a possibility, but changes in the macro-power structures were out of reach. In other words, a Left was born that was no longer oriented toward \"counter-hegemony\" (as per Antonio Gramsci), as a way of building toward power, but rather \"anti-hegemony\" (Horkheimer, Foucault, etc.), as John Sanbonmatsu put it in his critique of postmodernism.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "19457", "revid": "44238690", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19457", "title": "Myanmar", "text": "Country in Southeast Asia\nMyanmar, officially the Republic of the Union of Myanmar and also referred to as Burma (the official English name until 1989), is a country in northwest Southeast Asia. It is the largest country by area in Mainland Southeast Asia and has a population of about 55 million. It is bordered by India and Bangladesh to the northwest, China to the northeast, Laos and Thailand to the east and southeast, and the Andaman Sea and the Bay of Bengal to the south and southwest. The country's capital city is Naypyidaw, while its largest city is Yangon (formerly Rangoon).\nEarly civilisations in the area included the Tibeto-Burman-speaking Pyu city-states in Upper Myanmar and the Mon kingdoms in Lower Myanmar. In the 9th century, the Bamar people entered the upper Irrawaddy valley, and following the establishment of the Pagan Kingdom in the 1050s, the Burmese language and culture and Theravada Buddhism slowly became dominant in the country. The Pagan Kingdom fell to Mongol invasions, and several warring states emerged. In the 16th century, reunified by the Taungoo dynasty, the country became the largest empire in the history of Southeast Asia for a short period. The early 19th-century Konbaung dynasty ruled over an area that included modern Myanmar and briefly controlled Assam, the Lushai Hills, and Manipur as well. The British East India Company seized control of the administration of Myanmar after three Anglo-Burmese Wars in the 19th century, and the country became a British colony. After a brief Japanese occupation, Myanmar was reconquered by the Allies. On 4 January 1948, Myanmar declared independence under the terms of the Burma Independence Act 1947.\nMyanmar's post-independence history has been checkered by continuous unrest and conflict. A coup d'\u00e9tat in 1962 resulted in a military dictatorship under the Burma Socialist Programme Party. On 8 August 1988, the 8888 Uprising resulted in a transition to a multi-party system two years later, but the country's post-uprising military junta, led by members of the Tatmadaw, refused to cede power and continued to rule the country directly until 2011, when the junta was officially dissolved following the 2010 general election. A nominally civilian government was installed and longtime political prisoners like Aung San Suu Kyi were released, but the military retained power over key government operations. The 2015 Myanmar general election led to improved foreign relations and eased economic sanctions, although the country's treatment of its ethnic minorities, particularly the Rohingya genocide, continued to be a source of international tension and consternation. \nFollowing the 2020 Myanmar general election, in which Aung San Suu Kyi's party won a clear majority in both houses, the Tatmadaw again seized power in a 2021 coup d'\u00e9tat, which led to the rule of the National Defence and Security Council (NDSC) and its new military junta, the State Administration Council (SAC). The coup, which was widely condemned by the international community, led to continuous ongoing widespread protests in Myanmar and has been marked by violent political repression by the military, as well as the outbreak of a civil war. The military again arrested Aung San Suu Kyi in order to remove her from public life, and charged her with crimes ranging from corruption to violation of COVID-19 protocols; all of the charges against her are \"politically motivated\" according to independent observers. The SAC imposed a state of emergency from 2021 to 2025, after which it transferred power back to the NDSC.\nMyanmar is a member of the East Asia Summit, Non-Aligned Movement, ASEAN, and BIMSTEC, but it is not a member of the Commonwealth of Nations despite once being part of the British Empire. Myanmar is a Dialogue Partner of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization. The country is very rich in natural resources, such as jade, gems, oil, natural gas, teak and other minerals, as well as endowed with renewable energy, having the highest solar power potential compared to other countries of the Great Mekong Subregion. However, Myanmar has long suffered from instability, factional violence, corruption, poor infrastructure, as well as a long history of colonial exploitation with little regard to human development. In 2013, its GDP (nominal) stood at US$56.7 billion and its GDP (PPP) at US$221.5 billion. The income gap in Myanmar is among the widest in the world, as a large proportion of the economy is controlled by cronies of the military junta. Myanmar is one of the least developed countries in the world. \nThe country remains riven by ethnic strife among its myriad ethnic groups and has one of the world's longest-running ongoing civil wars. The United Nations and several other organisations have reported consistent and systemic human rights violations in the country. Since 2021, more than 600,000 people have been displaced across Myanmar due to the civil war post-coup, with more than three million people in dire need of humanitarian assistance. According to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), there are over 1.3 million people counted as refugees and asylum seekers, and 3.5 million people displaced internally as of December 2024.\nEtymology.\nThe name of the country has been a matter of dispute and disagreement, particularly in the early 21st century, focusing mainly on the political legitimacy of those using \"Myanmar\" versus \"Burma\". Both names derive from the earlier Burmese \"Mranma\" or \"Mramma\", an ethnonym for the majority Burman ethnic group, of uncertain etymology. The terms are also popularly thought to derive from Sanskrit \"Brahma Desha\", 'land of Brahma'.\nIn 1989, the military government officially changed the English names of places, dating back to Burma's colonial period or earlier, to romanized versions of their official Burmese names, including that of the country itself: \"Burma\" became \"Myanmar\". The renaming remains a contested issue. Many political and ethnic opposition groups and countries continue to use \"Burma\" because they do not recognise the legitimacy or authority of the military government.\nThe country's official full name is \"Republic of the Union of Myanmar\" (, ', ). Countries that do not officially recognise that name use the long form \"Union of Burma\" instead. In English, the country is popularly known as either \"Burma\" or \"Myanmar\". In Burmese, the pronunciation depends on the register used and is either ' () or \"\" ().\nOfficial United States foreign policy retains \"Burma\" as the country's name although the State Department's website lists the country as \"Burma (Myanmar)\". The United Nations uses \"Myanmar\", as does the ASEAN and as do Australia, Russia, Germany, China, India, Bangladesh, Norway, Japan, Switzerland, Canada and Ukraine. Most English-speaking international news media refer to the country by the name \"Myanmar\", including the BBC, CNN, Al Jazeera, Reuters, and the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC)/Radio Australia. Myanmar is known by a name deriving from \"Burma\" in Spanish, Italian, Romanian, and Greek. French-language media consistently use \"Birmanie\".\nThere are at least nine different pronunciations of the English name \"Myanmar\", and no single one is standard. Pronunciations with two syllables are found most often in major British and American dictionaries. Dictionaries\u2014such as Collins\u2014and other sources also report pronunciations with three syllables.\nHistory.\nPrehistory.\nArchaeological evidence shows that \"Homo erectus\" lived in the region now known as Myanmar as early as 750,000 years ago, with no more \"erectus\" finds after 75,000 years ago. The first evidence of \"Homo sapiens\" is dated to about 25,000 BP with discoveries of stone tools in central Myanmar. Evidence of Neolithic age domestication of plants and animals and the use of polished stone tools dating to sometime between 10,000 and 6,000 BCE has been discovered in the form of cave paintings in Padah-Lin Caves.\nThe Bronze Age arrived c.\u20091500 BCE when people in the region were turning copper into bronze, growing rice and domesticating poultry and pigs; they were among the first people in the world to do so. Human remains and artefacts from this era were discovered in Monywa District in the Sagaing Region. The Iron Age began around 500 BCE with the emergence of iron-working settlements in an area south of present-day Mandalay. Evidence also shows the presence of rice-growing settlements of large villages and small towns that traded with their surroundings as far as China between 500 BCE and 200 CE. Iron Age Burmese cultures also had influences from outside sources such as India and Thailand, as seen in their funerary practices concerning child burials. This indicates some form of communication between groups in Myanmar and other places, possibly through trade.\nEarly city-states.\nAround the second century BCE the first-known city-states emerged in central Myanmar. The city-states were founded as part of the southward migration by the Tibeto-Burman-speaking Pyu people, the earliest inhabitants of Myanmar of whom records are extant, from present-day Yunnan. The Pyu culture was heavily influenced by trade with India, importing Buddhism as well as other cultural, architectural and political concepts, which would have an enduring influence on later Burmese culture and political organisation.\nBy the 9th century, several city-states had sprouted across the land: the Pyu in the central dry zone, Mon along the southern coastline and Arakanese along the western littoral. The balance was upset when the Pyu came under repeated attacks from Nanzhao between the 750s and the 830s. In the mid-to-late 9th century the Bamar people founded a small settlement at Bagan. It was one of several competing city-states until the late 10th century, when it grew in authority and grandeur.\nPagan Kingdom.\nPagan gradually grew to absorb its surrounding states until the 1050s\u20131060s when Anawrahta founded the Pagan Kingdom, the first ever unification of the Irrawaddy valley and its periphery. In the 12th and 13th centuries, the Pagan Empire and the Khmer Empire were two main powers in mainland Southeast Asia. The Burmese language and culture gradually became dominant in the upper Irrawaddy valley, eclipsing the Pyu, Mon and Pali norms by the late 12th century. Theravada Buddhism slowly began to spread to the village level, although Tantric, Mahayana, Hinduism, and folk religion remained heavily entrenched. Pagan's rulers and wealthy built over 10,000 Buddhist temples in the Pagan capital zone alone. Repeated Mongol invasions in the late 13th century toppled the four-century-old kingdom in 1287.\nPagan's collapse was followed by 250 years of political fragmentation that lasted well into the 16th century. Like the Burmans four centuries earlier, Shan migrants who arrived with the Mongol invasions stayed behind. Several competing Shan States came to dominate the entire northwestern to eastern arc surrounding the Irrawaddy valley. The valley too was beset with petty states until the late 14th century when two sizeable powers, Ava Kingdom and Hanthawaddy kingdom, emerged. In the west, a politically fragmented Arakan was under competing influences of its stronger neighbours until the Kingdom of Mrauk U unified the Arakan coastline for the first time in 1437. The kingdom was a protectorate of the Bengal Sultanate at different time periods.\nIn the 14th and 15th centuries, Ava fought wars of unification but could never quite reassemble the lost empire. Having held off Ava, the Mon-speaking Hanthawaddy entered its golden age, and Arakan went on to become a power in its own right for the next 350 years. In contrast, constant warfare left Ava greatly weakened, and it slowly disintegrated from 1481 onward. In 1527, the Confederation of Shan States conquered Ava and ruled Upper Myanmar until 1555.\nLike the Pagan Empire, Ava, Hanthawaddy and the Shan states were all multi-ethnic polities. Despite the wars, cultural synchronisation continued. This period is considered a golden age for Burmese culture. Burmese literature \"grew more confident, popular, and stylistically diverse\", and the second generation of Burmese law codes as well as the earliest pan-Burma chronicles emerged. Hanthawaddy monarchs introduced religious reforms that later spread to the rest of the country.\nTaungoo and Konbaung.\nPolitical unification returned in the mid-16th century, through the efforts of Taungoo, a former vassal state of Ava. Taungoo's young, ambitious King Tabinshwehti defeated the more powerful Hanthawaddy in the Toungoo\u2013Hanthawaddy War. His successor Bayinnaung went on to conquer a vast swath of mainland Southeast Asia including the Shan states, Lan Na, Manipur, Mong Mao, the Ayutthaya Kingdom, Lan Xang and southern Arakan. However, the largest empire in the history of Southeast Asia unravelled soon after Bayinnaung's death in 1581, completely collapsing by 1599. Ayutthaya seized Tenasserim and Lan Na, and Portuguese mercenaries established Portuguese rule at Thanlyin (Syriam).\nThe dynasty regrouped and defeated the Portuguese in 1613 and Siam in 1614. It restored a smaller, more manageable kingdom, encompassing Lower Myanmar, Upper Myanmar, Shan states, Lan Na and upper Tenasserim. The restored Toungoo kings created a legal and political framework whose basic features continued well into the 19th century. The crown completely replaced the hereditary chieftainships with appointed governorships in the entire Irrawaddy valley and greatly reduced the hereditary rights of Shan chiefs. Its trade and secular administrative reforms built a prosperous economy for more than 80 years. From the 1720s onward, the kingdom was beset with repeated Meithei raids into Upper Myanmar and a nagging rebellion in Lan Na. In 1740, the Mon of Lower Myanmar founded the Restored Hanthawaddy Kingdom. Hanthawaddy forces sacked Ava in 1752, ending the 266-year-old Toungoo Dynasty.\nAfter the fall of Ava, the Konbaung\u2013Hanthawaddy War involved one resistance group under Alaungpaya defeating the Restored Hanthawaddy, and by 1759 he had reunited all of Myanmar and Manipur and driven out the French and the British, who had provided arms to Hanthawaddy. By 1770, Alaungpaya's heirs had subdued much of Laos and fought and won the Burmese\u2013Siamese War against Ayutthaya and the Sino-Burmese War against Qing China.\nWith Burma preoccupied by the Chinese threat, Ayutthaya recovered its territories by 1770 and went on to capture Lan Na by 1776. Burma and Siam went to war until 1855, but all resulted in a stalemate, exchanging Tenasserim (to Burma) and Lan Na (to Ayutthaya). Faced with a powerful China and a resurgent Ayutthaya in the east, King Bodawpaya turned west, acquiring Arakan (1785), Manipur (1814) and Assam (1817). It was the second-largest empire in Burmese history but also one with a long ill-defined border with British India.\nIn 1826, Burma lost Arakan, Manipur, Assam and Tenasserim to the British in the First Anglo-Burmese War. In 1852, the British easily seized Lower Burma in the Second Anglo-Burmese War. King Mindon Min tried to modernise the kingdom and in 1875 narrowly avoided annexation by ceding the Karenni States. The British, alarmed by the consolidation of French Indochina, annexed the remainder of the country in the Third Anglo-Burmese War in 1885.\nKonbaung kings extended Restored Toungoo's administrative reforms and achieved unprecedented levels of internal control and external expansion. For the first time in history, the Burmese language and culture came to predominate the entire Irrawaddy valley. The evolution and growth of Burmese literature and theatre continued, aided by an extremely high adult male literacy rate for the era (half of all males and 5% of females). Nonetheless, the extent and pace of reforms were uneven and ultimately proved insufficient to stem the advance of British colonialism.\nBritish Burma (1885\u20131948).\nIn the 19th century, Burmese rulers sought to maintain their traditional influence in the western areas of Assam, Manipur and Arakan. Pressing them, however, was the British East India Company, which was expanding its interests eastwards over the same territory. Over the next 60 years, diplomacy, raids, treaties and compromises, known collectively as the Anglo-Burmese Wars, continued until Britain proclaimed control over most of Burma. With the fall of Mandalay, all of Burma came under British rule, being annexed on 1 January 1886.\nThroughout the colonial era, many Indians arrived as soldiers, civil servants, construction workers and traders and, along with the Anglo-Burmese community, dominated commercial and civil life in Burma. Rangoon became the capital of British Burma and an important port between Calcutta and Singapore. Burmese resentment was strong, and was vented in violent riots that periodically paralysed Rangoon until the 1930s. Some of the discontent was caused by a disrespect for Burmese culture and traditions. Buddhist monks became the vanguards of the independence movement. U Wisara, an activist monk, died in prison after a 166-day hunger strike.\nOn 1 April 1937, Burma became a separately administered colony of Britain, and Ba Maw became the first Prime Minister and Premier of Burma. Ba Maw was an outspoken advocate for Burmese self-rule, and he opposed the participation of Britain, and by extension Burma, in World War II. He resigned from the Legislative Assembly and was arrested for sedition. In 1940, before Japan formally entered the war, Aung San formed the Burma Independence Army in Japan.\nAs a major battleground, Burma was devastated during World War II by the Japanese invasion. Within months after they entered the war, Japanese troops had advanced on Rangoon, and the British administration had collapsed. A Burmese Executive Administration headed by Ba Maw was established by the Japanese in August 1942. Wingate's British Chindits were formed into long-range penetration groups trained to operate deep behind Japanese lines. A similar American unit, Merrill's Marauders, followed the Chindits into the Burmese jungle in 1943.\nBeginning in late 1944, allied troops launched a series of offensives that led to the end of Japanese rule in July 1945. The battles were intense with much of Burma laid waste by the fighting. Overall, the Japanese lost some 150,000 men in Burma with 1,700 prisoners taken. Although many Burmese fought initially for the Japanese as part of the Burma Independence Army, many Burmese, mostly from the ethnic minorities, served in the British Burma Army. The Burma National Army and the Arakan National Army fought with the Japanese from 1942 to 1944 but switched allegiance to the Allied side in 1945. Overall, 170,000 to 250,000 Burmese civilians died during World War II.\nFollowing World War II, Aung San negotiated the Panglong Agreement with ethnic leaders that guaranteed the independence of Burma as a unified state. Aung Zan Wai, Pe Khin, Bo Hmu Aung, Sir Maung Gyi, Sein Mya Maung, Myoma U Than Kywe were among the negotiators of the historic Panglong Conference negotiated with Bamar leader General Aung San and other ethnic leaders in 1947. In 1947, Aung San became Deputy Chairman of the Executive Council of Burma, a transitional government. But in July 1947, political rivals assassinated Aung San and several cabinet members.\nIndependence (1948\u20131962).\nOn 4 January 1948, the nation became an independent republic, under the terms of the Burma Independence Act 1947. The new country was named the \"Union of Burma\", with Sao Shwe Thaik as its first president and U Nu as its first prime minister. Unlike most other former British colonies and overseas territories, Burma did not become a member of the Commonwealth. A bicameral parliament was formed, consisting of a Chamber of Deputies and a Chamber of Nationalities, and multi-party elections were held in 1951\u20131952, 1956 and 1960.\nThe geographical area Burma encompasses today can be traced to the Panglong Agreement, which combined Burma Proper, which consisted of Lower Burma and Upper Burma, and the Frontier Areas, which had been administered separately by the British.\nIn 1961, U Thant, the Union of Burma's Permanent Representative to the United Nations and former secretary to the prime minister, was elected Secretary-General of the United Nations, a position he held for ten years.\nWhen the non-Burman ethnic groups pushed for autonomy or federalism, alongside having a weak civilian government at the centre, the military leadership staged a coup d'\u00e9tat in 1962. Though incorporated in the 1947 Constitution, successive military governments construed the use of the term 'federalism' as being anti-national, anti-unity and pro-disintegration.\nMilitary rule (1962\u20132011).\nOn 2 March 1962, the military led by General Ne Win took control of Burma through a coup d'\u00e9tat, and the government had been under direct or indirect control by the military since then. Between 1962 and 1974, Myanmar was ruled by a revolutionary council headed by the general. Almost all aspects of society (business, media, production) were nationalised or brought under government control under the Burmese Way to Socialism, which combined Soviet-style nationalisation and central planning.\nA new constitution of the Socialist Republic of the Union of Burma was adopted in 1974. Until 1988, the country was ruled as a one-party system, with the general and other military officers resigning and ruling through the Burma Socialist Programme Party (BSPP). During this period, Myanmar became one of the world's most impoverished countries. There were sporadic protests against military rule during the Ne Win years, and these were almost always violently suppressed. On 7 July 1962, the government broke up demonstrations at Rangoon University, killing 15 students. In 1974, the military violently suppressed anti-government protests at the funeral of U Thant. Student protests in 1975, 1976, and 1977 were quickly suppressed by overwhelming force.\nIn 1988, unrest over economic mismanagement and political oppression by the government led to widespread pro-democracy demonstrations throughout the country known as the 8888 Uprising. Security forces killed thousands of demonstrators, and General Saw Maung staged a coup d'\u00e9tat and formed the State Law and Order Restoration Council (SLORC). In 1989, SLORC declared martial law after widespread protests. The military government finalised plans for People's Assembly elections on 31 May 1989. SLORC changed the country's official English name from the \"Socialist Republic of the Union of Burma\" to the \"Union of Myanmar\" on 18 June 1989 by enacting the adaptation of the expression law.\nIn May 1990, the government held free multiparty elections for the first time in almost 30 years, and the National League for Democracy (NLD), the party of Aung San Suu Kyi, won earning 392 out of a total 492 seats (i.e., 80% of the seats). However, the military junta refused to cede power and continued to rule the nation, first as SLORC and, from 1997, as the State Peace and Development Council (SPDC) until its dissolution in March 2011. General Than Shwe took over the Chairmanship \u2013 effectively the position of Myanmar's top ruler \u2013 from General Saw Maung in 1992 and held it until 2011.\nOn 23 June 1997, Myanmar was admitted into the Association of Southeast Asian Nations. On 27 March 2006, the military junta, which had moved the national capital from Yangon to a site near Pyinmana in November 2005, officially named the new capital Naypyidaw, meaning \"city of the kings\".\nIn August 2007, an increase in the price of fuel led to the Saffron Revolution led by Buddhist monks that were dealt with harshly by the government. The government cracked down on them on 26 September 2007, with reports of barricades at the Shwedagon Pagoda and monks killed. There were also rumours of disagreement within the Burmese armed forces, but none was confirmed. The military crackdown against unarmed protesters was widely condemned as part of the international reactions to the Saffron Revolution and led to an increase in economic sanctions against the Burmese Government.\nIn May 2008, Cyclone Nargis caused extensive damage in the densely populated rice-farming delta of the Irrawaddy Division. It was the worst natural disaster in Burmese history with reports of an estimated 200,000 people dead or missing, damages totalled to 10\u00a0billion US dollars, and as many as 1 million were left homeless. In the critical days following this disaster, Myanmar's isolationist government was accused of hindering United Nations recovery efforts. Humanitarian aid was requested, but concerns about foreign military or intelligence presence in the country delayed the entry of United States military planes delivering medicine, food, and other supplies.\nIn early August 2009, a conflict broke out in Shan State in northern Myanmar. For several weeks, junta troops fought against ethnic minorities including the Han Chinese, Wa, and Kachin. During 8\u201312 August, the first days of the conflict, as many as 10,000 Burmese civilians fled to Yunnan in neighbouring China.\nCivil wars.\nCivil wars have been a constant feature of Myanmar's socio-political landscape since the attainment of independence in 1948. These wars are predominantly struggles for ethnic and sub-national autonomy, with the areas surrounding the ethnically Bamar central districts of the country serving as the primary geographical setting of conflict. Foreign journalists and visitors require a special travel permit to visit the areas in which Myanmar's civil wars continue.\nIn October 2012, the ongoing conflicts in Myanmar included the Kachin conflict, between the Pro-Christian Kachin Independence Army and the government; a civil war between the Rohingya Muslims, and the government and non-government groups in Rakhine State; and a conflict between the Shan, Lahu, and Karen minority groups, and the government in the eastern half of the country. In addition, al-Qaeda signalled an intention to become involved in Myanmar.\nArmed conflict between ethnic Chinese rebels and the Myanmar Armed Forces resulted in the Kokang offensive in February 2015. The conflict had forced 40,000 to 50,000 civilians to flee their homes and seek shelter on the Chinese side of the border. During the incident, the government of China was accused of giving military assistance to the ethnic Chinese rebels. Clashes between Burmese troops and local insurgent groups have continued, fuelling tensions between China and Myanmar.\nPeriod of liberalisation, 2011\u20132021.\nThe military-backed Government had promulgated a \"Roadmap to Discipline-flourishing Democracy\" in 1993, but the process appeared to stall several times, until 2008 when the Government published a new draft national constitution, and organised a (flawed) national referendum which adopted it. The new constitution provided for election of a national assembly with powers to appoint a president, while practically ensuring army control at all levels.\nA general election in 2010 \u2013 the first for twenty years \u2013 was boycotted by the NLD. The military-backed Union Solidarity and Development Party declared victory, stating that it had been favoured by 80 per cent of the votes; fraud, however, was alleged. A nominally civilian government was then formed, with retired general Thein Sein as president.\nA series of liberalising political and economic actions \u2013 or reforms \u2013 then took place. By the end of 2011 these included the release of pro-democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi from house arrest, the establishment of the National Human Rights Commission, the granting of general amnesties for more than 200 political prisoners, new labour laws that permitted labour unions and strikes, a relaxation of press censorship, and the regulation of currency practices. In response, United States Secretary of State Hillary Clinton visited Myanmar in December 2011 \u2013 the first visit by a US Secretary of State in more than fifty years \u2013 meeting both President Thein Sein and opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi.\nAung San Suu Kyi's NLD party participated in the 2012 by-elections, facilitated by the government's abolition of the laws that previously barred it. In the April 2012 by-elections, the NLD won 43 of the 45 available seats. The 2012 by-elections were also the first time that international representatives were allowed to monitor the voting process in Myanmar.\nMyanmar's improved international reputation was indicated by ASEAN's approval of Myanmar's bid for the position of ASEAN chair in 2014.\n2015 general elections.\nGeneral elections were held on 8 November 2015. These were the first openly contested elections held in Myanmar since the 1990 general election (which was annulled). The results gave the NLD an absolute majority of seats in both chambers of the national parliament, enough to ensure that its candidate would become president, while NLD leader Aung San Suu Kyi is constitutionally barred from the presidency.\nThe new parliament convened on 1 February 2016, and on 15 March 2016, Htin Kyaw was elected as the first non-military president since the military coup of 1962. On 6 April 2016, Aung San Suu Kyi assumed the newly created role of state counsellor, a role akin to a prime minister.\nCoup d'\u00e9tat and civil war.\nIn Myanmar's 2020 parliamentary election, the ostensibly ruling National League for Democracy (NLD), the party of State Counsellor Aung San Suu Kyi, competed with various other smaller parties \u2013 particularly the military-affiliated Union Solidarity and Development Party (USDP). Suu Kyi's NLD won the 2020 Myanmar general election on 8 November in a landslide. The USDP, regarded as a proxy for the military, suffered a \"humiliating\" defeat \u2013 even worse than in 2015 \u2013 capturing only 33 of the 476 elected seats.\nAs the election results began emerging, the USDP rejected them, urging a new election with the military as observers. More than 90 other smaller parties contested the vote, including more than 15 who complained of irregularities. However, election observers declared there were no major irregularities. However, despite the election commission validating the NLD's overwhelming victory, the USDP and Myanmar's military persistently alleged fraud.\nIn January 2021, just before the new parliament was to be sworn in, the NLD announced that Suu Kyi would retain her State Counsellor role in the upcoming government.\nIn the early morning of 1 February 2021, the day parliament was set to convene, the Tatmadaw, Myanmar's military, detained Suu Kyi and other members of the ruling party. The military handed power to military chief Min Aung Hlaing and declared a state of emergency for one year and began closing the borders, restricting travel and electronic communications nationwide. The military announced it would replace the existing election commission with a new one, and a military media outlet indicated new elections would be held in about one year \u2013 though the military avoided making an official commitment to that. The military expelled NLD party Members of Parliament from the capital city, Naypyidaw. By 15 March 2021 the military leadership continued to extend martial law into more parts of Yangon, while security forces killed 38 people in a single day of violence.\nBy the second day of the coup, thousands of protesters were marching in the streets of Yangon, and other protests erupted nationwide, largely halting commerce and transportation. Despite the military's arrests and killings of protesters, the first weeks of the coup found growing public participation, including groups of civil servants, teachers, students, workers, monks and religious leaders \u2013 even normally disaffected ethnic minorities.\nThe coup was immediately condemned by the United Nations Secretary General, and leaders of democratic nations. The U.S. threatened sanctions on the military and its leaders, including a \"freeze\" of US$1 billion of their assets in the U.S. India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Russia, Vietnam, Thailand, the Philippines and China refrained from criticizing the military coup. A United Nations Security Council resolution called for the release of Aung San Suu Kyi and the other detained leaders \u2013 a position shared by the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights.\nInternational development and aid partners \u2013 business, non-governmental, and governmental \u2013 hinted at suspension of partnerships with Myanmar. Banks were closed and social media communications platforms, including Facebook and Twitter, removed Tatmadaw postings. Protesters appeared at Myanmar embassies in foreign countries. The National Unity Government then declared the formation of an armed wing on 5 May 2021, a date that is often cited as the start of a full-scale civil war. This armed wing was named the People's Defence Force (PDF) to protect its supporters from military junta attacks and as a first step towards a Federal Union Army. The civil war is ongoing as of 2025.\nGeography.\nMyanmar has a total area of . It lies between latitudes 9\u00b0 and 29\u00b0N, and longitudes 92\u00b0 and 102\u00b0E. Myanmar is bordered in the northwest by the Chittagong Division of Bangladesh and the Mizoram, Manipur, Nagaland and Arunachal Pradesh states of India. Its north and northeast border is with the Tibet Autonomous Region and Yunnan for a Sino-Myanmar border total of . It is bounded by Laos and Thailand to the southeast. Myanmar has of contiguous coastline along the Bay of Bengal and Andaman Sea to the southwest and the south, which forms one quarter of its total perimeter.\nIn the north, the Hengduan Mountains form the border with China. Hkakabo Razi, located in Kachin State, at an elevation of , is the highest point in Myanmar. Many mountain ranges, such as the Rakhine Yoma, the Bago Yoma, the Shan Hills and the Tenasserim Hills exist within Myanmar, all of which run north-to-south from the Himalayas. The mountain chains divide Myanmar's three river systems, which are the Irrawaddy, Salween (Thanlwin), and the Sittaung rivers. The Irrawaddy River, Myanmar's longest river at nearly , flows into the Gulf of Martaban. Fertile plains exist in the valleys between the mountain chains. The majority of Myanmar's population lives in the Irrawaddy valley, which is situated between the Rakhine Yoma and the Shan Plateau.\nMyanmar is one of the most seismically prone countries in the world. The Sagaing Fault between the Indian Plate and the Eurasian Plate runs north-south through the center of the country. There have been many small and some big earthquakes with a 7\u20138 magnitude.\nAdministrative divisions.\nMyanmar is divided into seven states () and seven regions (), formerly called divisions. Regions are predominantly Bamar (that is, mainly inhabited by Myanmar's dominant ethnic group). States, in essence, are regions that are home to particular ethnic minorities. The administrative divisions are further subdivided into districts, which are further subdivided into townships, wards, and villages. Since 30 April 2022, districts inside regions and states have been expanded to total count of 121.\nBelow are the number of districts, townships, cities/towns, wards, village groups and villages in each division and state of Myanmar as of 30 April 2022:\nClimate.\nMuch of the country lies between the Tropic of Cancer and the Equator. It lies in the monsoon region of Asia, with its coastal regions receiving over of rain annually. Annual rainfall in the delta region is approximately , while average annual rainfall in the dry zone in central Myanmar is less than . The northern regions of Myanmar are the coolest, with average temperatures of . Coastal and delta regions have an average maximum temperature of .\nPreviously and currently analysed data, as well as future projections on changes caused by climate change predict serious consequences to development for all economic, productive, social, and environmental sectors in Myanmar. In order to combat the hardships ahead and do its part to help combat climate change Myanmar has displayed interest in expanding its use of renewable energy and lowering its level of carbon emissions. Groups involved in helping Myanmar with the transition and move forward include the UN Environment Programme, Myanmar Climate Change Alliance, and the Ministry of Natural Resources and Environmental Conservation which directed in producing the final draft of the Myanmar national climate change policy that was presented to various sectors of the Myanmar government for review.\nIn April 2015, it was announced that the World Bank and Myanmar would enter a full partnership framework aimed to better access to electricity and other basic services for about six million people and expected to benefit three million pregnant woman and children through improved health services. Acquired funding and proper planning has allowed Myanmar to better prepare for the impacts of climate change by enacting programs which teach its people new farming methods, rebuild its infrastructure with materials resilient to natural disasters, and transition various sectors towards reducing greenhouse gas emissions.\nBiodiversity.\nMyanmar is a biodiverse country with more than 16,000 plant, 314 mammal, 1131 bird, 293 reptile, and 139 amphibian species, and 64 terrestrial ecosystems including tropical and subtropical vegetation, seasonally inundated wetlands, shoreline and tidal systems, and alpine ecosystems. Myanmar houses some of the largest intact natural ecosystems in Southeast Asia, but the remaining ecosystems are under threat from land use intensification and over-exploitation. According to the IUCN Red List of Ecosystems categories and criteria more than a third of Myanmar's land area has been converted to anthropogenic ecosystems over the last 2\u20133 centuries, and nearly half of its ecosystems are threatened. Despite large gaps in information for some ecosystems, there is a large potential to develop a comprehensive protected area network that protects its terrestrial biodiversity.\nMyanmar continues to perform badly in the global Environmental Performance Index (EPI) with an overall ranking of 153 out of 180 countries in 2016, among the worst in the South Asian region. The environmental areas where Myanmar performs worst (i.e. highest ranking) are air quality (174), health impacts of environmental issues (143) and biodiversity and habitat (142). Myanmar performs best (i.e. lowest ranking) in environmental impacts of fisheries (21) but with declining fish stocks. Despite several issues, Myanmar also ranks 64 and scores very good (i.e. a high percentage of 93.73%) in environmental effects of the agricultural industry because of an excellent management of the nitrogen cycle. Myanmar is one of the most highly vulnerable countries to climate change; this poses a number of social, political, economic and foreign policy challenges to the country.\nMyanmar's slow economic growth has contributed to the preservation of much of its environment and ecosystems. Forests, including dense tropical growth and valuable teak in lower Myanmar, cover over 49% of the country, including areas of acacia, bamboo, ironwood and \"Magnolia champaca\". Coconut and betel palm and rubber have been introduced. In the highlands of the north, oak, pine and various rhododendrons cover much of the land.\nHeavy logging since the new 1995 forestry law went into effect has seriously reduced forest area and wildlife habitat. The lands along the coast support all varieties of tropical fruits and once had large areas of mangroves although much of the protective mangroves have disappeared. In much of central Myanmar (the dry zone), vegetation is sparse and stunted.\nTypical jungle animals, particularly tigers, occur sparsely in Myanmar. In upper Myanmar, there are rhinoceros, wild water buffalo, clouded leopard, wild boars, deer, antelope, and elephants, which are also tamed or bred in captivity for use as work animals, particularly in the lumber industry. Smaller mammals are also numerous, ranging from gibbons and monkeys to flying foxes. The abundance of birds is notable with over 800 species, including parrots, myna, peafowl, red junglefowl, weaverbirds, crows, herons, and barn owl. Among reptile species there are crocodiles, geckos, cobras, Burmese pythons, and turtles. Hundreds of species of freshwater fish are wide-ranging, plentiful and are very important food sources.\nGovernment and politics.\nMyanmar operates \"de jure\" as a unitary assembly-independent republic under its 2008 constitution. But in February 2021, the civilian government led by Aung San Suu Kyi, was deposed by the Tatmadaw. In February 2021, Myanmar military declared a one-year state emergency and First Vice President Myint Swe became the Acting President of Myanmar and handed the power to the Commander-in-Chief of Defence Services Min Aung Hlaing and he assumed the role Chairman of the State Administration Council, then Prime Minister. The President of Myanmar acts as the de jure head of state and the Chairman of the State Administration Council acts as the de facto head of government.\nThe constitution of Myanmar, its third since independence, was drafted by its military rulers and published in September 2008. The country is governed as a parliamentary system with a bicameral legislature (with an executive president accountable to the legislature), with 25% of the legislators appointed by the military and the rest elected in general elections.\nThe legislature, called the Assembly of the Union, is bicameral and made up of two houses: The 224-seat upper House of Nationalities and the 440-seat lower House of Representatives. The upper house consists 168 members who are directly elected and 56 who are appointed by the Burmese Armed Forces. The lower house consists of 330 members who are directly elected and 110 who are appointed by the armed forces.\nPolitical culture.\nThe major political parties are the National League for Democracy and the Union Solidarity and Development Party.\nMyanmar's army-drafted constitution was approved in a referendum in May 2008. The results, 92.4% of the 22 million voters with an official turnout of 99%, are considered suspect by many international observers and by the National League of Democracy with reports of widespread fraud, ballot stuffing, and voter intimidation.\nThe elections of 2010 resulted in a victory for the military-backed Union Solidarity and Development Party. Various foreign observers questioned the fairness of the elections. One criticism of the election was that only government-sanctioned political parties were allowed to contest in it and the popular National League for Democracy was declared illegal. However, immediately following the elections, the government ended the house arrest of the democracy advocate and leader of the National League for Democracy, Aung San Suu Kyi, and her ability to move freely around the country is considered an important test of the military's movement toward more openness. According to the V-Dem Democracy indices, Myanmar in 2024 was one of the most autocratic countries in the world.\nForeign relations.\nThough the country's foreign relations, particularly with Western nations, have historically been strained, the situation has markedly improved since the reforms following the 2010 elections. After years of diplomatic isolation and economic and military sanctions, the United States relaxed curbs on foreign aid to Myanmar in November 2011 and announced the resumption of diplomatic relations on 13 January 2012 The European Union has placed sanctions on Myanmar, including an arms embargo, cessation of trade preferences, and suspension of all aid with the exception of humanitarian aid.\nSanctions imposed by the United States and European countries against the former military government, coupled with boycotts and other direct pressure on corporations by supporters of the democracy movement, have resulted in the withdrawal from the country of most U.S. and many European companies. Despite Western isolation, Asian corporations have generally remained willing to continue investing in the country and to initiate new investments, particularly in natural resource extraction. The country has close relations with neighbouring India and China with several Indian and Chinese companies operating in the country. Under India's Look East policy, fields of co-operation between India and Myanmar include remote sensing, oil and gas exploration, information technology, hydropower and construction of ports and buildings. Myanmar also has close political relations with Vietnam and Japan.\nIn June 2013, Myanmar held its first ever summit, the World Economic Forum on East Asia 2013. A regional spinoff of the annual World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, the summit was held on 5\u20137 June and attended by 1,200 participants, including 10 heads of state, 12 ministers and 40 senior directors from around the world.\nOn 19 January 2025, Reuters reported that ASEAN had told Myanmar's military government to prioritise ceasefire, \"urging the junta to start dialogue and end hostilities immediately\" and \"to allow unhindered humanitarian access\", citing Malaysia's foreign minister Mohamad Hasan. The ASEAN chair's statement denounced \"the continued acts of violence against civilians and public facilities and urged all parties involved\" to \"immediately halt indiscriminate violence, exercise utmost restraint, ensure the protection and safety of all civilians and civilian infrastructures, and create a conducive environment for the delivery of humanitarian assistance and inclusive national dialogue\".\nMilitary.\nSince the late 1950s, Myanmar's military has had major roles in Myanmar's politics.23\nMyanmar has received extensive military aid from China in the past.\nMyanmar has been a member of ASEAN since 1997. Though it gave up its turn to hold the ASEAN chair and host the ASEAN Summit in 2006, it chaired the forum and hosted the summit in 2014. In November 2008, Myanmar's political situation with neighbouring Bangladesh became tense as they began searching for natural gas in a disputed block of the Bay of Bengal. Controversy surrounding the Rohingya population also remains an issue between Bangladesh and Myanmar.\nMyanmar's armed forces are known as the Tatmadaw, which numbers 488,000. The Tatmadaw comprises the Army, the Navy, and the Air Force. The country ranked twelfth in the world for its number of active troops in service. The military is very influential in Myanmar, with all top cabinet and ministry posts usually held by military officials. Official figures for military spending are not available. Estimates vary widely because of uncertain exchange rates, but Myanmar's military forces' expenses are high. Myanmar imports most of its weapons from Russia, Ukraine, China and India.\nMyanmar is building a research nuclear reactor near Pyin Oo Lwin with help from Russia. It is one of the signatories of the nuclear non-proliferation pact since 1992 and a member of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) since 1957. The military junta had informed the IAEA in September 2000 of its intention to construct the reactor. In 2010 as part of the leaked diplomatic cables, Myanmar was suspected of using North Korean construction teams to build a fortified surface-to-air missile facility. As of 2019, the United States Bureau of Arms Control assessed that Myanmar is not in violation of its obligations under the Non-Proliferation Treaty but that the Myanmar government had a history of non-transparency on its nuclear programs and aims.\nUntil 2005, the United Nations General Assembly annually adopted a detailed resolution about the situation in Myanmar by consensus. But in 2006 a divided United Nations General Assembly voted through a resolution that strongly called upon the government of Myanmar to end its systematic violations of human rights. In January 2007, Russia and China vetoed a draft resolution before the United Nations Security Council calling on the government of Myanmar to respect human rights and begin a democratic transition. South Africa also voted against the resolution.\nHuman rights and internal conflicts.\nThere is consensus that the former military regime in Myanmar (1962\u20132010) was one of the world's most repressive and abusive regimes. In November 2012, Samantha Power, Barack Obama's Special Assistant to the President on Human Rights, wrote on the White House blog that \"Serious human rights abuses against civilians in several regions continue, including against women and children.\" Members of the United Nations and major international human rights organisations have issued repeated and consistent reports of widespread and systematic human rights violations in Myanmar. The United Nations General Assembly has repeatedly called on the Burmese military junta to respect human rights and in November 2009 the General Assembly adopted a resolution \"strongly condemning the ongoing systematic violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms\" and calling on the Burmese military regime \"to take urgent measures to put an end to violations of international human rights and humanitarian law.\"\nInternational human rights organisations including Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International have repeatedly documented and condemned widespread human rights violations in Myanmar. The \"Freedom in the World 2011\" report by Freedom House notes, \"The military junta has\u00a0... suppressed nearly all basic rights; and committed human rights abuses with impunity.\" In July 2013, the Assistance Association for Political Prisoners indicated that there were approximately 100 political prisoners being held in Burmese prisons. Evidence gathered by a British researcher was published in 2005 regarding the extermination or \"Burmisation\" of certain ethnic minorities, such as the Karen, Karenni and Shan.\nBased on the evidence gathered by Amnesty photographs and video of the ongoing armed conflict between the Myanmar military and the Arakan Army (AA), attacks escalated on civilians in Rakhine State. Ming Yu Hah, Amnesty International's Deputy Regional Director for Campaigns said, the UN Security Council must urgently refer the situation in Myanmar to the International Criminal Court. The military is notorious for rampant use of sexual violence.\nIn November 2024, the ICC prosecutor Karim A.A. Khan KC filed an arrest warrant application of Senior General, Acting President and Commander-in-Chief of the Myanmar Defence Services Min Aung Hlaing for \"criminal responsibility for the crimes against humanity of deportation and persecution of the Rohingya, committed in Myanmar, and in part in Bangladesh\".\nGenocide, organ trading and human trafficking.\nChild soldiers have been a major issue in Myanmar, with reports of children being sold into the military for as little as $40. The Burmese Army and rebel groups have used child soldiers, though some efforts have been made to release them. The UN and other organizations have pressured the government to reform, but progress has been slow.\nThe military takeover in 2021 worsened poverty in country pushing people to extreme measures like illegal organ trade. Many Myanmar citizens sell their organs online for money, sometimes earning the equivalent of a two-year salary, as financial desperation forces families into a cycle of selling body parts.\nThe Myanmar government has been alleged to have committed genocide against the Rohingya. The Rohingya people face severe persecution, denied citizenship and basic rights since 1982. Many have been expelled, making them one of the world's most persecuted minorities.\nGovernment reforms.\nAccording to the Crisis Group, since Myanmar transitioned to a new government in August 2011, the country's human rights record has been improving. Previously giving Myanmar its lowest rating of 7, the 2012 \"Freedom in the World\" report also notes improvement, giving Myanmar a 6 for improvements in civil liberties and political rights, the release of political prisoners, and a loosening of restrictions. In 2013, Myanmar improved yet again, receiving a score of 5 in civil liberties and 6 in political freedoms.\nThe government has assembled a National Human Rights Commission that consists of 15 members from various backgrounds. Several activists in exile, including Thee Lay Thee Anyeint members, have returned to Myanmar after President Thein Sein's invitation to expatriates to return home to work for national development. In an address to the United Nations Security Council on 22 September 2011, Myanmar's Foreign Minister Wunna Maung Lwin confirmed the government's intention to release prisoners in the near future.\nThe government has also relaxed reporting laws, but these remain highly restrictive. In September 2011, several banned websites, including YouTube, Democratic Voice of Burma and Voice of America, were unblocked. A 2011 report by the Hauser Center for Nonprofit Organizations found that, while contact with the Myanmar government was constrained by donor restrictions, international humanitarian non-governmental organisations (NGOs) see opportunities for effective advocacy with government officials, especially at the local level. At the same time, international NGOs are mindful of the ethical quandary of how to work with the government without bolstering or appeasing it.\nFollowing Thein Sein's first ever visit to the UK and a meeting with Prime Minister David Cameron, the Myanmar president declared that all of his nation's political prisoners will be released by the end of 2013, in addition to a statement of support for the well-being of the Rohingya Muslim community. In a speech at Chatham House, he revealed that \"We [Myanmar government] are reviewing all cases. I guarantee to you that by the end of this year, there will be no prisoners of conscience in Myanmar.\"\nHomosexual acts are illegal in Myanmar and can be punishable by life imprisonment.\nIn 2016, Myanmar leader Aung San Suu Kyi was accused of failing to protect Myanmar's Muslim minority. Since August 2017 Doctors Without Borders have treated 113 Rohingya refugee females for sexual assault with all but one describing military assailants.\nEconomy.\nMyanmar's economy is one of the fastest growing economies in the world with a nominal GDP of US$76.09 billion in 2019 and an estimated purchasing power adjusted GDP of US$327.629 billion in 2017 according to the World Bank. Foreigners are able to legally lease but not own property. In December 2014, Myanmar set up its first stock exchange, the Yangon Stock Exchange.\nThe informal economy's share in Myanmar is one of the biggest in the world and is closely linked to corruption, smuggling and illegal trade activities. In addition, decades of civil war and unrest have contributed to Myanmar's current levels of poverty and lack of economic progress. Myanmar lacks adequate infrastructure. Goods travel primarily across the Thai border (where most illegal drugs are exported) and along the Irrawaddy River. Notably, opium production in Myanmar is the world's second-largest source of opium after Afghanistan, producing some 25% of the world's opium, forming part of the Golden Triangle. While opium poppy cultivation in Myanmar had declined year-on-year since 2015, cultivation area increased by 33% totalling 40,100 hectares alongside an 88% increase in yield potential to 790 tonnes in 2022 according to latest data from the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) Myanmar Opium Survey 2022. With that said, the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) has also warned that opium production in Myanmar may rise again if the economic crunch brought on by COVID-19 and the country's 1 February military coup persists, with significant public health and security consequences for much of Asia. At the same time, the Golden Triangle, and specifically Shan State in Myanmar, is believed to be the largest methamphetamine-producing area in the world. The growing signs of an intensification of methamphetamine manufacturing activity within and around the Golden Triangle, and a corresponding decrease in the number of production facilities dismantled in other parts of the region, suggests that methamphetamine manufacture in East and Southeast Asia is now consolidated into the lower Mekong region. Countries in East and Southeast Asia have collectively witnessed sustained increases in seizures of methamphetamine over the last decade, totalling over 171 tons and a record of over 1 billion methamphetamine tablets in 2021 according to the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, more than any other part of the world. In April and May 2020, Myanmar authorities reported Asia's largest ever drug operation in Shan State, totalling what was believed to be 193 million methamphetamine tablets, hundreds of kilogrammes of crystal methamphetamine as well as some heroin, and over 162,000 litres and 35.5 tons of drug precursors as well as sophisticated production equipment and several staging and storage facilities.\nBoth China and India have attempted to strengthen ties with the government for economic benefit in the early 2010s. Many Western nations, including the United States and Canada, and the European Union, historically imposed investment and trade sanctions on Myanmar. The United States and European Union eased most of their sanctions in 2012. From May 2012 to February 2013, the United States began to lift its economic sanctions on Myanmar \"in response to the historic reforms that have been taking place in that country.\" Foreign investment comes primarily from China, Singapore, the Philippines, South Korea, India, and Thailand. The military has stakes in some major industrial corporations of the country (from oil production and consumer goods to transportation and tourism).\nEconomic history.\nUnder the British administration, the people of Burma were at the bottom of the social hierarchy, with Europeans at the top, Indians, Chinese, and Christianised minorities in the middle, and Buddhist Burmese at the bottom. Forcefully integrated into the world economy, Burma's economy grew by involving itself with extractive industries and cash crop agriculture. However, much of the wealth was concentrated in the hands of Europeans. The country became the world's largest exporter of rice, mainly to European markets, while other colonies like India suffered mass starvation. Being a follower of free market principles, the British opened up the country to large-scale immigration with Rangoon exceeding New York City as the greatest immigration port in the world in the 1920s. Historian Thant Myint-U states, \"This was out of a total population of only 13 million; it was equivalent to the United Kingdom today taking 2 million people a year.\" By then, in most of Burma's largest cities, Rangoon, Akyab, Bassein and Moulmein, the Indian immigrants formed a majority of the population. The Burmese under British rule felt helpless, and reacted with a \"racism that combined feelings of superiority and fear\".\nCrude oil production, an indigenous industry of Yenangyaung, was taken over by the British and put under Burmah Oil monopoly. British Burma began exporting crude oil in 1853. European firms produced 75% of the world's teak. The wealth was, however, mainly concentrated in the hands of Europeans. In the 1930s, agricultural production fell dramatically as international rice prices declined and did not recover for several decades. During the Japanese invasion of Burma in World War II, the British followed a scorched earth policy. They destroyed major government buildings, oil wells and mines that developed for tungsten (Mawchi), tin, lead and silver to keep them from the Japanese. Myanmar was bombed extensively by the Allies.\nAfter independence, the country was in ruins with its major infrastructure completely destroyed. With the loss of India, Burma lost relevance and obtained independence from the British. After a parliamentary government was formed in 1948, Prime Minister U Nu embarked upon a policy of nationalisation and the state was declared the owner of all of the land in Burma. The government tried to implement an eight-year plan partly financed by injecting money into the economy, but this caused inflation to rise. The 1962 coup d'\u00e9tat was followed by an economic scheme called the Burmese Way to Socialism, a plan to nationalise all industries, with the exception of agriculture. While the economy continued to grow at a slower rate, the country eschewed a Western-oriented development model, and by the 1980s, was left behind capitalist powerhouses like Singapore which were integrated with Western economies. Myanmar asked for admittance to a least developed country status in 1987 to receive debt relief.\nAgriculture.\nThe major agricultural product is rice, which covers about 60% of the country's total cultivated land area. Rice accounts for 97% of total food grain production by weight. Through collaboration with the International Rice Research Institute, 52 modern rice varieties were released in the country between 1966 and 1997, helping increase national rice production to 14\u00a0million tons in 1987 and to 19\u00a0million tons in 1996. By 1988, modern varieties were planted on half of the country's ricelands, including 98 percent of the irrigated areas. In 2008 rice production was estimated at 50 million tons.\nExtractive industries.\nMyanmar produces precious stones such as rubies, sapphires, pearls, and jade. Rubies are the biggest earner; 90% of the world's rubies come from the country, whose red stones are prized for their purity and hue. Thailand buys the majority of the country's gems. Myanmar's \"Valley of Rubies\", the mountainous Mogok area, north of Mandalay, is noted for its rare pigeon's blood rubies and blue sapphires.\nMany U.S. and European jewellery companies, including Bulgari, Tiffany and Cartier, refuse to import these stones based on reports of deplorable working conditions in the mines. Human Rights Watch has encouraged a complete ban on the purchase of Burmese gems based on these reports and because nearly all profits go to the ruling junta, as the majority of mining activity in the country is government-run. The government of Myanmar controls the gem trade by direct ownership or by joint ventures with private owners of mines.\nRare-earth elements are also a significant export, as Myanmar supplies around 10% of the world's rare earths. Conflict in Kachin State has threatened the operations of its mines as of February 2021.\nOther industries include agricultural goods, textiles, wood products, construction materials, gems, metals, oil and natural gas. Myanmar Engineering Society has identified at least 39 locations capable of geothermal power production and some of these hydrothermal reservoirs lie quite close to Yangon which is a significant underutilised resource for electrical production.\nTourism.\nThe government receives a significant percentage of the income of private-sector tourism services. The most popular available tourist destinations in Myanmar include big cities such as Yangon and Mandalay; religious sites in Mon State, Pindaya, Bago and Hpa-An; nature trails in Inle Lake, Kengtung, Putao, Pyin Oo Lwin; ancient cities such as Bagan and Mrauk-U; as well as beaches in Nabule, Ngapali, Ngwe-Saung, and Mergui. Nevertheless, much of the country is off-limits to tourists, and interactions between foreigners and the people of Myanmar, particularly in the border regions, are subject to police scrutiny. They are not to discuss politics with foreigners, under penalty of imprisonment and, in 2001, the Myanmar Tourism Promotion Board issued an order for local officials to protect tourists and limit \"unnecessary contact\" between foreigners and ordinary Burmese people.\nThe most common way for travellers to enter the country is by air. According to the website \"Lonely Planet\", getting into Myanmar is problematic: \"No bus or train service connects Myanmar with another country, nor can you travel by car or motorcycle across the border\u00a0\u2013 you must walk across.\" They further state that \"It is not possible for foreigners to go to/from Myanmar by sea or river.\" There are a few border crossings that allow the passage of private vehicles, such as the border between Ruili (China) to Mu-se, the border between Htee Kee (Myanmar) and Phu Nam Ron (Thailand)\u2014the most direct border between Dawei and Kanchanaburi, and the border between Myawaddy and Mae Sot, Thailand. At least one tourist company has successfully run commercial overland routes through these borders since 2013.\nFlights are available from most countries, though direct flights are limited to mainly Thai and other ASEAN airlines. According to \"Eleven\" magazine, \"In the past, there were only 15 international airlines and increasing numbers of airlines have begun launching direct flights from Japan, Qatar, Taiwan, South Korea, Germany and Singapore.\"\nDemographics.\nThe provisional results of the 2014 Myanmar Census showed that the total population was 51,419,420. This figure includes an estimated 1,206,353 persons in parts of northern Rakhine State, Kachin State and Kayin State who were not counted. People who were out of the country at the time of the census are not included in these figures. There are over 600,000 registered migrant workers from Myanmar in Thailand, and millions more work illegally. Burmese citizens account for 80% of all migrant workers in Thailand. At the beginning of the 20th century, Burma's population was approximately 10\u00a0million. The national population density is , among the lowest in Southeast Asia.\nMyanmar's fertility rate in 2011 was 2.23, slightly above the replacement level and low compared to Southeast Asian countries of similar economic standing. There has been a significant decline in fertility in the 2000s, from a rate of 4.7 children per woman in 1983, down to 2.4 in 2001, despite the absence of any national population policy. The fertility rate is much lower in urban areas.\nThe relatively rapid decline in fertility is attributed to several factors, including extreme delays in marriage (almost unparalleled among developing countries in the region), the prevalence of illegal abortions, and the high proportion of single, unmarried women of reproductive age, with 25.9% of women aged 30\u201334 and 33.1% of men and women aged 25\u201334 being single.\nThese patterns stem from economic dynamics, including high income inequality, which results in residents of reproductive age opting for delay of marriage and family-building in favour of attempting to find employment and establish some form of wealth; the average age of marriage in Myanmar is 27.5 for men, 26.4 for women.\nLargest cities.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Largest_cities/styles.css\" /&gt;\nEthnic groups.\nMyanmar is ethnically diverse. The government recognises 135 distinct ethnic groups. There are at least 108 different ethnolinguistic groups in Myanmar, consisting mainly of distinct Tibeto-Burman peoples, but with sizeable populations of Tai\u2013Kadai, Hmong\u2013Mien, and Austroasiatic (Mon\u2013Khmer) peoples.\nEthnic identity in modern-day Myanmar has been significantly shaped by British colonial rule, Christian missionaries, and decolonisation in the post-independence era. To this day, the Burmese language does not have precise terminology that distinguishes the European concepts of race and ethnicity; the term \"lu-myo\" (, lit.\u2009'type of person') can reference race, ethnicity, and religion. For instance, many Bamar self-identify as members of the 'Buddhist \"lu-myo\"' or the 'Myanmar \"lu-myo\",' which has posed a significant challenge for census-takers.\nThe Bamar form an estimated 68% of the population. 10% of the population are Shan. The Kayin make up 7% of the population. The Rakhine people constitute 4% of the population. Overseas Chinese form approximately 3% of the population. Myanmar's ethnic minority groups prefer the term \"ethnic nationality\" over \"ethnic minority\" as the term \"minority\" furthers their sense of insecurity in the face of what is often described as \"Burmanisation\"\u2014the proliferation and domination of the dominant Bamar culture over minority cultures.\nMon, who form 2% of the population, are ethno-linguistically related to the Khmer. Overseas Indians are 2%. The remainder are Kachin, Chin, Rohingya, Anglo-Indians, Gurkha, Nepali and other ethnic minorities. Included in this group are the Anglo-Burmese. Once forming a large and influential community, the Anglo-Burmese left the country in steady streams from 1958 onwards, principally to Australia and the United Kingdom. It is estimated that 52,000 Anglo-Burmese remain in Myanmar. As of 2009[ [update]], 110,000 Burmese refugees were living in refugee camps in Thailand.\nRefugee camps exist along Indian, Bangladeshi and Thai borders while several thousand are in Malaysia. Conservative estimates state that there are over 295,800 minority refugees from Myanmar, with the majority being Rohingya, Karen, and Karenni are principally located along the Thai-Myanmar border. There are nine permanent refugee camps along the Thai-Myanmar border, most of which were established in the mid-1980s. The refugee camps are under the care of the Thai-Burma Border Consortium (TBBC). Since 2006, over 55,000 Burmese refugees have been resettled in the United States.\nThe persecution of Burmese Indians, Burmese Chinese and other ethnic groups after the military coup headed by General Ne Win in 1962 led to the expulsion or emigration of 300,000 people. They migrated to escape racial discrimination and the wholesale nationalisation of private enterprise that took place in 1964. The Anglo-Burmese at this time either fled the country or changed their names and blended in with the broader Burmese society.\nMany Rohingya Muslims have fled Myanmar. Many refugees headed to neighbouring Bangladesh, including 200,000 in 1978 as a result of the King Dragon operation in Arakan. 250,000 more left in 1991. Since August 2017, an estimated 23,000\u201343,700 Rohingya have been killed in the ongoing Rohingya genocide, and another 730,000 have fled to Bangladesh.\nLanguages.\nMyanmar is home to four major language families: Sino-Tibetan, Tai\u2013Kadai, Austroasiatic, and Indo-European. Sino-Tibetan languages are most widely spoken. They include Burmese, Karen, Kachin, Chin, and Chinese (mainly Hokkien). The primary Tai\u2013Kadai language is Shan. Mon, Palaung, and Wa are the major Austroasiatic languages spoken in Myanmar. The two major Indo-European languages are Pali, the liturgical language of Theravada Buddhism, and English. More than a hundred languages are spoken in total. Since many of them are known only within small tribes around the country, they may have been lost (many if not all) after a few generations.\nBurmese, the mother tongue of the Bamar and official language of Myanmar, is related to Tibetan and Chinese. It is written in a script consisting of circular and semi-circular letters, which were adapted from the Mon script, which in turn was developed from a southern Indian script in the 5th century. The earliest known inscriptions in the Burmese script date from the 11th century. It is also used to write Pali, the sacred language of Theravada Buddhism, as well as several ethnic minority languages, including Shan, several Karen dialects, and Kayah (Karenni), with the addition of specialised characters and diacritics for each language.\nReligion.\nMany religions are practised in Myanmar. Religious edifices and orders have been in existence for many years. The Christian and Muslim populations do, however, face religious persecution and it is hard, if not impossible, for non-Buddhists to join the army or get government jobs, the main route to success in the country. Such persecution and targeting of civilians is particularly notable in eastern Myanmar, where over 3,000 villages have been destroyed in the past ten years. More than 200,000 Muslims have fled to Bangladesh by 2007 to escape persecution.\nA large majority of the population practices Buddhism; estimates range from 80% to 89%. According to the 2014 Myanmar Census, 87.9% of the population identifies as Buddhists. Therav\u0101da Buddhism is the most widespread. There are some 500,000 Buddhist monks and 75,000 nuns in this country of 54 million. Other religions are practised largely without obstruction, with the notable exception of some religious minorities such as the Rohingya people, who have continued to have their citizenship status denied and treated as illegal immigrants instead, and Christians in Chin State. According to 2014 census, 6.2% of the population identifies as Christian; 4.3% as Muslim; 0.8% as followers of tribal religions; 0.5% as Hindus; 0.2% as followers of other religions; and 0.1% follow no religion. According to the 2010 estimates of the Pew Research Center, 7% of the population is Christian; 4% is Muslim; 1% follows traditional animistic beliefs; and 2% follow other religions, including Mahayana Buddhism, Hinduism, and East Asian religions. Jehovah's Witnesses have been present since 1914 and have about 80 congregations around the country and a branch office in Yangon publishing in 16 languages. A tiny Jewish community in Yangon had a synagogue but no resident rabbi.\nAlthough Hinduism is practised by 0.5% of the population, it was a major religion in Myanmar's past. Burmese folk religion is practised by many Bamars alongside Buddhism.\nHealth.\nThe general state of health care in Myanmar is poor. The government spends anywhere from 0.5% to 3% of the country's GDP on health care, consistently ranking among the lowest in the world. Although health care is nominally free, in reality, patients have to pay for medicine and treatment, even in public clinics and hospitals. Public hospitals lack many of the basic facilities and equipment. The 2010 maternal mortality rate per 100,000 births for Myanmar is 240. This is compared with 219.3 in 2008 and 662 in 1990. The under 5 mortality rate, per 1,000 births is 73 and the neonatal mortality as a percentage of under 5's mortality is 47. According to Doctors without Borders, 25,000 Burmese AIDS patients died in 2007, deaths that could largely have been prevented by antiretroviral therapy drugs and proper treatment.\nHIV/AIDS, recognised as a disease of concern by the Myanmar Ministry of Health, is most prevalent among sex workers and intravenous drug users. In 2005, the estimated adult HIV prevalence rate in Myanmar was 1.3% (200,000\u2013570,000 people), according to UNAIDS, and early indicators of any progress against the HIV epidemic are inconsistent. However, the National AIDS Programme Myanmar found that 32% of sex workers and 43% of intravenous drug users in Myanmar have HIV.\nEducation.\nAccording to the UNESCO Institute of Statistics, Myanmar's official literacy rate as of 2000 was 90%. Historically, Myanmar has had high literacy rates. The educational system of Myanmar is operated by the government agency, the Ministry of Education. The education system is based on the United Kingdom's system after nearly a century of British and Christian presences in Myanmar. Nearly all schools are government-operated, but there has been an increase in privately funded English language schools in the early 21st century. Schooling is compulsory until the end of elementary school, approximately 9 years old, while the compulsory schooling age is 15 or 16 at international level.\nThere are 101 universities, 12 institutes, 9 degree colleges and 24 colleges in Myanmar, a total of 146 higher education institutions. There are 10 technical training schools, 23 nursing training schools, 1 sport academy and 20 midwifery schools. There are four international schools acknowledged by WASC and College Board\u2014The International School Yangon, Myanmar International School, Yangon International School, and International School of Myanmar in Yangon. Myanmar was ranked 122nd in the Global Innovation Index in 2025.\nCrime.\nMyanmar had a murder rate of 15.2 per 100,000 population with a total of 8,044 murders in 2012. Factors influencing Myanmar's high murder rate include communal violence and armed conflict. Myanmar is one of the world's most corrupt nations according to the 2012 Transparency International Corruption Perceptions Index, which ranked the country at number 171, out of 176 countries in total. Myanmar is the world's second largest producer of opium after Afghanistan, producing some 25% of the world's opium, and forms part of the Golden Triangle. The opium industry was a monopoly during colonial times and has since been illegally operated by corrupt officials in the Burmese military and rebel fighters, primarily as the basis for heroin manufacture. Myanmar is the largest producer of methamphetamines in the world, with the majority of \"Ya ba\" found in Thailand produced in Myanmar, particularly in the Golden Triangle and northeastern Shan State, which borders Thailand, Laos and China. Burmese-produced \"ya ba\" is typically trafficked to Thailand via Laos, before being transported through the northeastern Thai region of Isan.\nCulture.\nA diverse range of indigenous cultures exist in Myanmar, with majority culture primarily Buddhist and Bamar. Bamar culture has been influenced by the cultures of neighbouring countries, manifested in its language, cuisine, music, dance and theatre. The arts, particularly literature, have historically been influenced by the local form of Theravada Buddhism. Considered the national epic of Myanmar, the \"Yama Zatdaw\", an adaptation of India's \"Ramayana\", has been influenced greatly by Thai, Mon, and Indian versions of the play. Buddhism is practised along with nat worship, which involves elaborate rituals to propitiate one from a pantheon of 37 nats.\nIn a traditional village, the monastery is the centre of cultural life. Monks are venerated and supported by the lay people. A novitiation ceremony called shinbyu is the most important coming of age events for a boy, during which he enters the monastery for a short time. All male children in Buddhist families are encouraged to be a novice (beginner for Buddhism) before the age of twenty and to be a monk after the age of twenty. Girls have ear-piercing ceremonies () at the same time. Burmese culture is most evident in villages where local festivals are held throughout the year, the most important being the pagoda festival. Many villages have a guardian nat, and superstition and taboos are commonplace.\nBritish colonial rule introduced Western elements of culture to Myanmar. Myanmar's education system is modelled after that of the United Kingdom. Colonial architectural influences are most evident in major cities such as Yangon. Many ethnic minorities, particularly the Karen in the southeast and the Kachin and Chin who populate the north and northeast, practice Christianity. According to \"The World Factbook\", the Burman population is 68% and the ethnic groups constitute 32%. In contrast, the exiled leaders and organisations claim the country is 40% ethnic.\nCuisine.\nBurmese cuisine is characterised by extensive use of fish products such as fish sauce, ngapi (fermented seafood) and dried prawn. Mohinga is the traditional breakfast dish and is Myanmar's national dish. Seafood is a common ingredient in coastal cities, while meat and poultry are more commonly used in landlocked cities like Mandalay. Freshwater fish and shrimp have been incorporated into inland cooking as a primary source of protein and are used in a variety of ways, fresh, salted whole or filleted, salted and dried, made into a salty paste, or fermented sour and pressed. Burmese cuisine also includes a variety of salads (\"a thoke\"), centred on one major ingredient, ranging from starches like rice, wheat and rice noodles, glass noodles and vermicelli, to potato, ginger, tomato, kaffir lime, long bean, and lahpet (pickled tea leaves).\nSport.\nThe Lethwei, Bando, Banshay, and Pongyi thaing martial arts and chinlone are traditional sports in Myanmar. Football is played all over the country, even in villages, and its national team is ruled by the Myanmar Football Federation. The 2013 Southeast Asian Games took place in Naypyidaw, Yangon, Mandalay and Ngwesaung Beach in December representing the third occasion that the event has been staged in Myanmar. Myanmar previously hosted the games in 1961 and 1969.\nArt.\nBurmese traditional art concepts are popular and respected by the Burmese people and people from abroad. Burmese contemporary art has developed quite rapidly on its own terms. Artists born after the 1980s have had greater chances of art practice outside the country.\nOne of the first to study western art was Ba Nyan. Together with Ngwe Gaing and a handful of other artists, they were the pioneers of western painting style. Later on most young children learned the concepts from them. Some well known contemporary artists are Lun Gywe, Aung Kyaw Htet, MPP Yei Myint, Myint Swe, Min Wai Aung, Aung Myint, Kin Maung Yin, Po Po and Zaw Zaw Aung.\nMedia and communications.\nBecause of Myanmar's political climate, there are not many media companies in relation to the country's population. Some are privately owned. All programming must meet with the approval of the censorship board. The Burmese government announced on 20 August 2012 that it would stop censoring media before publication. Following the announcement, newspapers and other outlets no longer required approved by state censors; however, journalists in the country can still face consequences for what they write and say. In April 2013, international media reports were published to relay the enactment of the media liberalisation reforms that we announced in August 2012. For the first time in numerous decades, the publication of privately owned newspapers commenced in the country.\nInternet.\nInternet use is estimated to be relatively low compared to other countries. Myanmar's internet used to be subject to censorship, and authorities viewed e-mails and posts on Internet blogs until 2012 when the government removed media censorship. During the strict censorship days, activity at internet cafes was regulated, and one blogger named Zarganar was sentenced to prison for publishing a video of destruction caused by Cyclone Nargis in 2008; Zarganar was released in October 2011.\nIn regards to communications infrastructure, Myanmar is the last ranked Asian country in the World Economic Forum's Networked Readiness Index (NRI) \u2013 an indicator for determining the development level of a country's information and communication technologies. With 139 countries reported on, Myanmar ranked number 133 overall in the 2016 NRI ranking.\nFilm.\nMyanmar's first film was a documentary of the funeral of Tun Shein\u2014a leading politician of the 1910s, who campaigned for Burmese independence in London. The first Burmese silent film \"Myitta Ne Thuya\" (\"Love and Liquor\") in 1920 which proved a major success, despite its poor quality. During the 1920s and 1930s, many Burmese-owned film companies made and produced several films. The first Burmese sound film was produced in 1932 in Bombay, India with the title Ngwe Pay Lo Ma Ya (Money Can't Buy It). After World War II, Burmese cinema continued to address political themes. Many of the films produced in the early Cold War era had a strong propaganda element.\nIn the era that followed the political events of 1988, the film industry has been increasingly controlled by the government. Film stars who had been involved in the political activities were banned from appearing in films. The government issues strict rules on censorship and largely determines who produces films, as well as who gets academy awards.\nOver the years, the movie industry has also shifted to producing many lower-budget direct-to-video films. Most of the movies produced nowadays are comedies. In 2008, only 12 films worthy of being considered for an Academy Award were made, although at least 800 VCDs were produced. Myanmar is the primary subject of a 2007 graphic novel titled \"Chroniques Birmanes\" by Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois author and animator, Guy Delisle.

Its initial purpose was to raise the morale of Jan Henryk D\u0105browski's Polish Legions that served with Napoleon Bonaparte in the Italian campaigns of the French Revolutionary Wars. The song expressed the idea that the nation of Poland, despite lacking an independent state of their own, had not disappeared as long as the Polish people endured and fought in its name.\nFollowing the declaration of independence of the Second Polish Republic in 1918, the song became its \"de facto\" national anthem, and was officially adopted in 1927. It also inspired similar songs by other peoples struggling for independence during the 19th century, such as the Ukrainian anthem \"Ukraine Is Not Yet Perished\", the Croatian reveille \"Croatia has not yet fallen\" and the Yugoslav and Slovak anthem \"Hey, Slavs\".\nEtymology.\nIt is also known by its original title, \"\" ('Song of the Polish Legions in Italy'). As there are no official translations of the name into English, various translations of its Polish incipit \"\" include 'Poland has not yet perished', 'Poland has not perished yet', 'Poland is not lost', 'Poland is not lost yet', 'Poland is not yet lost', and 'Poland has not yet succumbed'.\nLyrics.\nThe original lyrics, authored by Wybicki, are a poem consisting of six quatrains and a refrain quatrain repeated after all but the last stanza, all following an ABAB rhyme scheme. The official lyrics, based on a variant from 1806, \"Poland has not yet died\", suggesting a more violent cause of the nation's possible death. Wybicki's original manuscript was in the hands of his descendants until February 1944, when it was lost in Wybicki's great-great-grandson, Johann von Roznowski's home in Charlottenburg during the Allied bombing of Berlin. The manuscript is known today only from facsimile copies, twenty-four of which were made in 1886 by Edward Ro\u017cnowski, Wybicki's grandson, who donated them to Polish libraries.\nThe main theme of the poem is the idea that was novel in the times of early nationalisms based on centralized nation-states\u00a0\u2013 that the lack of political sovereignty does not preclude the existence of a nation. As Adam Mickiewicz explained in 1842 to students of Slavic Literature in Paris, the song \"The famous song of the Polish legions begins with lines that express the new history: Poland has not perished yet as long as we live. These words mean that people who have in them what constitutes the essence of a nation can prolong the existence of their country regardless of its political circumstances and may even strive to make it real again...\" The song also includes a call to arms and expresses the hope that, under General D\u0105browski's command, the legionaries would rejoin their nation and retrieve \"what the alien force has seized\" through armed struggle.\nThe chorus and subsequent stanzas include heart-lifting examples of military heroes, set as role models for Polish soldiers: Jan Henryk D\u0105browski, Napoleon, Stefan Czarniecki, and Tadeusz Ko\u015bciuszko.\nD\u0105browski, for whom the anthem is named, was a commander in the failed 1794 Ko\u015bciuszko Uprising against Russia. After the Third Partition in 1795, he came to Paris to seek French aid in re-establishing Polish independence and in 1796, he started the formation of the Polish Legions, a Polish unit of the French Revolutionary Army.\nBonaparte was, at the time when the song was written, a commander of the Italian campaign of French Revolutionary Wars and D\u0105browski's superior. Having already proven his skills as a military leader, he is described in the lyrics as the one \"who has shown us ways to victory.\" Bonaparte is the only non-Polish person mentioned by name in the Polish anthem.\nStefan Czarniecki was a 17th-century hetman, famous for his role in driving the Swedish Army out of Poland after an occupation that had left the country in ruins and is remembered by Poles as the Deluge. With the outbreak of a Dano-Swedish War, he continued his fight against Sweden in Denmark, from where he \"returned across the sea\" to fight the invaders alongside the king, who was then at the Royal Castle in Pozna\u0144. In the same castle, J\u00f3zef Wybicki started his career as a lawyer in 1765.\nKo\u015bciuszko, mentioned in a stanza now missing from the anthem, became a hero of the American Revolutionary War before coming back to Poland to defend his native country from Russia in the war of 1792 and a national uprising he led in 1794. One of his major victories during the uprising was the Battle of Rac\u0142awice, where the result was partly due to Polish peasants armed with scythes. Alongside the scythes, the song mentioned other types of weaponry, traditionally used by the Polish \"szlachta\", or nobility: the sabre, known in Polish as \"szabla\", and the backsword.\nBasia (a feminine diminutive of Barbara) and her father are fictional characters. They are used to represent the women and elderly men who waited for the Polish soldiers to return home and liberate their fatherland. The route that D\u0105browski and his legions hoped to follow upon leaving Italy is hinted at by the words \"we'll cross the Vistula, we'll cross the Warta\", two major rivers flowing through the parts of Poland that were in Austrian and Prussian hands at the time.\nMusic.\nThe melody of the Polish anthem is a lively and rhythmical mazurka. Mazurka as a musical form derives from the stylization of traditional melodies for the folk dances of Mazovia, a region in central Poland. It is characterized by a triple meter and strong accents placed irregularly on the second or third beat. Considered one of Poland's national dances in pre-partition times, it owes its popularity in 19th-century Western European ballrooms to the mazurkas of Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Chopin.\nThe composer of \" is not known, though most contemporary performances of it utilize a modern arrangement by composer Kazimierz Sikorski. The melody is most probably Wybicki's adaptation of a folk tune that had already been popular during the second half of the 18th century. The composition used to be erroneously attributed to Micha\u0142 Kleofas Ogi\u0144ski, who was known to have written a march for D\u0105browski's legions. Several historians confused Ogi\u0144ski's \" ('March for the Polish Legions') with Wybicki's mazurka, possibly due to the mazurka's chorus \"March, march, D\u0105browski\", until Ogi\u0144ski's sheet music for the march was discovered in 1938 and proven to be a different piece of music than Poland's national anthem.\nThe first composer to use the anthem for an artistic music piece is always stated to be Karol Kurpi\u0144ski. In 1821, he composed his piano/organ Fugue on \"Jeszcze Polska nie zgin\u0119\u0142a\" (it was published in 1821 in Warsaw; the first modern edition by Rostislaw Wygranienko was printed only in 2009). However, Karol Lipi\u0144ski used it in an overture for his opera \"K\u0142\u00f3tnia przez zak\u0142ad\" composed and staged in Lviv c.\u20091812.\nWojciech Sowi\u0144ski was the next who arranged \"\" for the piano. The arrangement, accompanied by the lyrics in Polish and French, was published 1829 in Paris. German composers who were moved by the suffering of the November Uprising wove the mazurek into their works. Examples include Richard Wagner's Polonia Overture and Albert Lortzing's \"Der Pole und sein Kind\".\nThe current official musical score of the national anthem was arranged by Kazimierz Sikorski and published by the Polish Ministry of Culture and National Heritage. Sikorski's harmonization allows for each vocal version to be performed either \"a cappella\" or together with any of the instrumental versions. Some orchestra parts, marked in the score as \"ad libitum\", may be left out or replaced by other instruments of equivalent musical scale.\nIn 1908, Ignacy Jan Paderewski, later to become the first Prime Minister of independent Poland, quoted the anthem in a disguised way in his Symphony in B minor \"Polonia\". He scored it in duple meter rather than its standard triple meter.\nThe anthem was quoted by Edward Elgar in his symphonic prelude \"Polonia\", composed in 1915.\nRegulations.\nThe national anthem is, along with the national coat of arms and the national colors, one of three national symbols defined by the Polish constitution.\nAs such, it is protected by law which declares that treating the national symbols \"with reverence and respect\" is the \"right and obligation\" of every Polish citizen and all state organs, institutions and organizations. The anthem should be performed or reproduced especially at celebrations of national holidays and anniversaries. Civilians should pay respect to the anthem by standing in a dignified manner; additionally, men should uncover their heads. Members of uniformed services should stand at attention; if their uniform includes headgear and they are not standing in an organized group, they should also perform the two-finger salute. The song is required to be played in the key of F major if played for a public purpose. Color guards pay respect to the anthem by dipping their banners.\nHistory.\nOrigin.\nIn 1795, after a prolonged decline and despite last-minute attempts at constitutional reforms and armed resistance, the Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth was ultimately partitioned by its three neighbors: Russia, Prussia and Austria. A once-vast and powerful empire was effectively erased from the map while monarchs of the partitioning powers pledged never to use the name \"Poland\" in their official titles. For many, including even leading representatives of the Polish Enlightenment, this new political situation meant the end of the Polish nation. In the words of Hugo Ko\u0142\u0142\u0105taj, a notable Polish political thinker of the time, \"Poland no longer belonged to currently extant nations,\" while historian Tadeusz Czacki declared that Poland \"was now effaced from the number of nations.\"\nMeanwhile, Polish patriots and revolutionaries turned for help to France, Poland's traditional ally, which was at war with Austria (member of the First Coalition) at the time. J\u00f3zef Wybicki was among the leading moderate \u00e9migr\u00e9 politicians seeking French aid in re-establishing Polish independence. In 1796, he came up with the idea of creating Polish Legions within the French Revolutionary Army. To this end, he convinced General Jan Henryk D\u0105browski, a hero of the Greater Poland campaign of the 1794 Ko\u015bciuszko Uprising, to come to Paris and present the plan to the French Directory. D\u0105browski was sent by the Directory to Napoleon, who was then spreading the French Revolution in northern Italy. In January 1797, the newly created French-controlled Cisalpine Republic accepted D\u0105browski's offer and a Polish legion was formed. D\u0105browski and his soldiers hoped to fight against Austria under Napoleon and, subsequently, march across the Austrian territory, \"from Italy to Poland\", where they would ignite a national uprising.\nIn early July 1797, Wybicki arrived in Reggio Emilia where the Polish Legions were then quartered and where he wrote the \"Song of the Polish Legions\" soon afterwards. He first sung it at a private meeting of Polish officers in the Legions' headquarters at the episcopal palace in Reggio. The first public performance most probably took place on 16 July 1797 during a military parade in Reggio's Piazza del Duomo (Cathedral Square). On 20 July, it was played again as the Legions were marching off from Reggio to Milan, the Cisalpine capital.\nWith its heart-lifting lyrics and folk melody, the song soon became a popular tune among Polish legionaries. On 29 August 1797, D\u0105browski already wrote to Wybicki from Bologna: \"soldiers gain more and more taste for your song.\" It appealed to both officers, usually \u00e9migr\u00e9 noblemen, and simple soldiers, most of whom were Galician peasants who had been drafted into the Austrian army and captured as POWs by the French. The last stanza, referring to Ko\u015bciuszko, who famously fought for freedom of the entire nation rather than the nobility alone, and the \"scythes of Rac\u0142awice\", seems to be directed particularly at the latter. Wybicki may have even hoped for Ko\u015bciuszko to arrive in Italy and personally lead the Legions, which might explain why the chorus \"March, march, D\u0105browski\" is not repeated after the last stanza. At that time, Wybicki was not yet aware that Ko\u015bciuszko had already returned to Philadelphia.\nRising popularity.\nThe song became popular in Poland as early as late 1797 and quickly became an object of variations and modifications. A variant from 1798 introduced some stylistic changes, which have since become standard, such as replacing ('not dead') with ('not perished') or ('to Poland from the Italian land') with ('from the Italian land to Poland'). It also added four new stanzas, now forgotten, written from the viewpoint of Polish patriots waiting for General D\u0105browski to bring freedom and human rights to Poland.\nThe ultimate fate of the Polish Legions in Italy was different from that promised by Wybicki's song. Rather than coming back to Poland, they were exploited by the French government to quell uprisings in Italy, Germany and, later, in Haiti where they were decimated by war and disease. Polish national hopes were revived with the outbreak of the Franco-Prussian War (part of the War of the Fourth Coalition) in 1806. Napoleon called D\u0105browski and Wybicki to come back from Italy and help gather support for the French army in Polish-populated parts of Prussia. On 6 November 1806, both generals arrived in Pozna\u0144, enthusiastically greeted by locals singing \"Poland Is Not Yet Lost\". The ensuing Greater Poland Uprising and Napoleon's victory over Russian forces at Friedland led to the creation of a French-controlled Polish puppet state known as the Duchy of Warsaw.\n\"Poland Is Not Yet Lost\" was one of the most popular patriotic songs in the duchy, stopping short of becoming that entity's national anthem. Among other occasions, it was sung in Warsaw on 16 June 1807 to celebrate the battle of Friedland, in Krak\u00f3w as it was liberated by Prince J\u00f3zef Poniatowski on 19 July 1809, and at a ball in Warsaw on 23 December 1809, the birthday of Frederick Augustus, King of Saxony and Duke of Warsaw. On the occasion of D\u0105browski's name day on 25 December 1810 in Pozna\u0144, D\u0105browski and Wybicki led the mazurka to the tune of \"Poland Is Not Yet Lost\". Although the melody of Wybicki's song remained unchanged and widely known, the lyrics kept changing. With the signing of a Franco-Russian alliance at Tilsit in 1807, the fourth stanza, specifically mentioning Russians as Poland's enemies, was removed. The last stanza, referring to Ko\u015bciuszko, who had grown suspicious of Napoleon and refused to lend his support to the emperor's war in Poland, met the same fate.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;poem&gt;\nThe blow struck with such skill, with such force unsurpassed,\nThat the strings rang out boldly, like trumpets of brass,\nAnd from them to the heavens that song wafted, cherished,\nThat triumphal march: Poland has never yet perished!\n...March D\u0105browski to Poland! \u2013 The audience entire\nClapped, and all \"March D\u0105browski!\" cried out as a choir.&lt;/poem&gt;\nAdam Mickiewicz, \"Pan Tadeusz\" (Book Twelve, \"Love and Friendship!\")\nThe anthem is mentioned twice in \"Pan Tadeusz\", the Polish national epic written by Adam Mickiewicz in 1834, but set in the years 1811\u20131812. The author makes the first reference to the song when Tadeusz, the main protagonist, returns home and, recalling childhood memories, pulls the string of a chiming clock to hear the \"old D\u0105browski's Mazurka\" once again. Music boxes and musical clocks playing the melody of \"Poland Is Not Yet Lost\" belonged to popular patriotic paraphernalia of that time. The song appears in the epic poem again when Jankiel, a Jewish dulcimerist and ardent Polish patriot, plays the mazurka in the presence of General D\u0105browski himself.\nWith Napoleon's defeat and the Congress of Vienna in 1815 came a century of foreign domination over Poland interspersed with occasional bursts of armed rebellion. \"Poland Is Not Yet Lost\" continued to be sung throughout that period, especially during national uprisings. During the November Uprising against Russia in 1830\u20131831, the song was chanted in the battlefields of Stoczek, Olszynka Grochowska, and Iganie. In peacetime, Polish patriots performed it at homes, official functions and political demonstrations. New variants of the song, of various artistic value and length of life, abounded. At least 16 alternative versions were penned during the November Uprising alone. At times, D\u0105browski's name was replaced by other national heroes: from J\u00f3zef Ch\u0142opicki during the November Uprising to J\u00f3zef Pi\u0142sudski during the First World War to W\u0142adys\u0142aw Sikorski during the Second World War. New lyrics were also written in regional dialects of Polish, from Silesia to Ermland and Masuria. A variant known as \"Marsz Polonii\" ('March of Polonia') spread among Polish immigrants in the Americas.\nMass political emigration following the defeat of the November Uprising, known as the Great Emigration, brought \"Poland Is Not Yet Lost\" to Western Europe. It soon found favor from Britain to France to Germany, where it was performed as a token of sympathy with the Polish cause. It was also highly esteemed in Central Europe, where various, mostly Slavic, peoples struggling for their own independence, looked to the Polish anthem for inspiration. Back in Poland, however, especially in the parts under Russian and Prussian rule, it was becoming increasingly risky to sing the anthem in public. Polish patriotic songs were banned in Prussia in 1850; between 1873 and 1911, German courts passed 44 sentences for singing such songs, 20 of which were specifically for singing \"Poland Is Not Yet Lost\". When Poland was part of the Russian Empire, public performance of the song often ended with police intervention.\nChoice of national anthem.\nWhen Poland re-emerged as an independent state after World War I in 1918, it had to decide on its national symbols. While the coat of arms and the flag were officially adopted as early as 1919, the question of a national anthem had to wait. Apart from \"Poland Is Not Yet Lost\", there were other popular patriotic songs that could compete for the status of an official national anthem.\nIn the Middle Ages, the role of a national anthem was played by hymns. Among them were \"Bogurodzica\" ('Mother of God'), one of the oldest (11th\u201312th century) known literary texts in Polish, and the Latin \"Gaude Mater Polonia\" ('Rejoice, Mother Poland'), written in the 13th century to celebrate the canonization of Bishop Stanislaus of Szczepan\u00f3w, the patron saint of Poland. Both were chanted on special occasions and on battlefields. The latter is sung nowadays at university ceremonies. During the Renaissance and the Enlightenment, several songs, both religious and secular, were written with the specific purpose of creating a new national anthem. Examples include the 16th-century Latin prayer ('Prayer for the Commonwealth and the King') by a Calvinist poet, Andrzej Trzeci\u0144ski, and \" ('Hymn to the Love of the Fatherland') written in 1744 by Prince-Bishop Ignacy Krasicki. They failed, however, to win substantial favor with the populace. Another candidate was \" ('God Is Born'), whose melody was originally a 16th-century coronation polonaise (dance) for Polish kings.\nThe official anthem of the Russian-controlled Congress Kingdom of Poland was \"\" (lit.\u2009'National Song to the King's Prosperity') written in 1816 by Alojzy Feli\u0144ski and Jan Kaszewski. Initially unpopular, it evolved in the early 1860s into an important religious and patriotic hymn. The final verse, which originally begged \"Save, O Lord, our King\", was substituted with \"Return us, O Lord, our free Fatherland\" while the melody was replaced with that of a Marian hymn. The result, known today as \"Bo\u017ce, co\u015b Polsk\u0119\" (from the first lines \"Bo\u017ce! Co\u015b Polsk\u0119 przez tak liczne wieki / Otacza\u0142 blaskiem pot\u0119gi i chwa\u0142y...\", \"Lord! Who for so many ages enclosed Poland with the light of power and glory...\"), has been sung in Polish churches ever since, with the final verse alternating between \"Return...\" and \"Bless, O Lord, our free Fatherland\", depending on Poland's political situation.\nA national song that was particularly popular during the November Uprising was \"Warszawianka\", originally written in French as \" by Casimir Delavigne, with melody by Karol Kurpi\u0144ski. The song praised Polish insurgents taking their ideals from the French July Revolution of 1830. A peasant rebellion against Polish nobles, which took place in western Galicia in 1846 and was encouraged by Austrian authorities who wished to thwart a new uprising attempt, moved Kornel Ujejski to write a mournful chorale entitled \" ('With the Smoke of Fires'). With the music composed by J\u00f3zef Nikorowicz, it became one of the most popular national songs of the time, although it declined into obscurity during the 20th century. In 1908, Maria Konopnicka and Feliks Nowowiejski created \"Rota\" ('Oath'), a song protesting against the oppression of the Polish population of the German Empire, who were subject to eviction from their land and forced assimilation. First publicly performed in 1910, during a quincentennial celebration of the Polish\u2013Lithuanian victory over the Teutonic Knights at Grunwald, it too became one of the most treasured national Polish songs.\nAt the inauguration of the United Nations in 1945, no delegation from Poland had been invited.12 The Polish pianist Artur Rubinstein, who was to perform the opening concert at the inauguration, began the concert by stating his deep disappointment that the conference did not have a delegation from Poland. Rubinstein later described becoming overwhelmed by a blind fury and angrily pointing out to the public the absence of the Polish flag. He then sat down to the piano and played \"Poland Is Not Yet Lost\" loudly and slowly, repeating the final part in a great thunderous \"forte\". When he had finished, the public rose to their feet and gave him a great ovation.\nOver 60 years later, on 22 September 2005, Aleksander Kwa\u015bniewski, President of Poland, said: &lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;For the UN is rightly criticised for being anachronistic, for reflecting the old world that is drifting away into the past. Particularly we, the Polish people, and all the nations of Central and Eastern Europe find it difficult to forget about that. The UN idea dates back to 1943; to the meeting of the \"Big Three\" in Tehran; to the illusions that Roosevelt harboured about Stalin, benevolently nicknamed \"Uncle Joe\". As a result, the road to San Francisco led via Yalta. And even though Poland had made a major contribution to the victory which put an end to the Second World War, in June 1945 a representative of our country was not allowed to put his signature to the United Nations Charter. We remember that event when Artur Rubinstein, seeing that there was no Polish delegation at the concert to mark the signing of the Charter, decided to play the D\u0105browski Mazurka, Poland's national anthem, to demonstrate that \"Poland was not lost yet\", that Poland lived on. I am recalling this because I had a very touching moment a few days ago in the same San Francisco opera house, to which I was invited for the opening of the season. This time it was the orchestra that played the D\u0105browski Mazurka, and at that moment the memories of the great Artur Rubinstein and his performance came back with full force and it was very touching indeed for me. The UN is rooted in the Second World War and in the post-war situation; it reflects the balance of power of that era.\nInfluence.\nDuring the European Revolutions of 1848, \"Poland Is Not Yet Lost\" won favor throughout Europe as a revolutionary anthem. This led the Slovak poet Samo Tom\u00e1\u0161ik to write the ethnic anthem, \"Hej, Sloveni\", based on the slowed melody of the Polish national anthem. It was later adopted by the Prague Slavic Congress as the Pan-Slavic Anthem. During the Second World War, a translation of this anthem became the national anthem of Yugoslavia, and later, Serbia and Montenegro. The similarity of the anthems sometimes confused these countries' football or volleyball matches. However, after the 2006 split between the two, neither Serbia nor Montenegro kept the song as its national anthem, instead choosing \"Bo\u017ee pravde\" and \"Oj, svijetla majska zoro\" respectively. The Polish national anthem is also notable for influencing the lyrics of the national anthem of Ukraine.\nThe anthem is played on First Programme of Polish Radio every day at midnight.\nThe line \"Poland is not yet lost\" has become proverbial in some languages. For example, in German, \"noch ist Polen nicht verloren\" is a common saying meaning all is not lost'. In Swedish, the similar phrase \"\u00e4n \u00e4r inte Polen f\u00f6rlorat\" is also used in the same context.\nAdditionally, the Italian anthem \"\" contains a reference to the Partitions of Poland by Prussia, Austria and Russia, due to the two countries' close relations.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "19496", "revid": "3843081", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19496", "title": "Mahjong", "text": "Tile-based game\nMahjong ( ; also spelled mah jongg, mah-jongg, and mahjongg) is a tile-based game that was developed in the 19th century in China and has spread throughout the world since the early 20th century. It is played by four players (with some three-player variations found in parts of China, Japan, South Korea, Vietnam, and Southeast Asia). The game and its regional variants are widely played throughout the Sinosphere in East and Southeast Asia and have also become popular in Western countries. The game has also been adapted into a widespread form of online entertainment. Similar to the Western card game rummy, mahjong is a game of skill, strategy, and luck. To distinguish it from mahjong solitaire, it is sometimes referred to as mahjong rummy.\nThe game is played with a set of 144 tiles based on Chinese characters and symbols, although many regional variations may omit some tiles or add unique ones. In most variations, each player begins by receiving 13 tiles. In turn, players draw and discard tiles until they complete a legal hand using the 14th drawn tile to form four melds (or sets) and a pair (eye). A player can also win with a small class of special hands. While many variations of mahjong exist, most variations have some basic rules in common including how a piece is drawn and discarded, the use of suits (numbered tiles) and honors (winds and dragons), the basic kinds of melds allowed, how to deal the tiles and the order of play. Beyond these basic common rules, numerous regional variations exist which may have notably different criteria for legal melds and winning hands, radically different scoring systems and even elaborate extra rules. A group of players may introduce their own house rules which can notably change the feel of play.\nEtymology.\nThe game was originally called ()\u2014meaning sparrow\u2014which is still used in several Chinese languages, mostly in the south, such as Cantonese and Hokkien. It is said that the clacking of tiles during shuffling resembles the chattering of sparrows. It has also been suggested that the name came from an evolution of an earlier card game called Madiao from which mahjong tiles were adapted. In Chinese, denotes a form of guerilla warfare tactics colloquially called 'sparrow warfare (tactics)'. Other languages, such as Sichuanese, Shanghainese and Standard Mandarin, now call the game (), which is a nasal erhua form of the original name. Its name is similar in other languages, except in Thai, where it is called (), a calque meaning \"sparrow cards\".\nOld Hong Kong mahjong rules.\nThere are many highly varied versions of mahjong both in rules and tiles used. \"Old Hong Kong mahjong\" uses the same basic features and rules as the majority of the different variations of the game. This form of mahjong uses all of the tiles of the most commonly available sets, includes no exotic complex rules, and has a relatively small set of scoring sets/hands with a simple scoring system. For these reasons Hong Kong mahjong is a suitable variation for the introduction of game rules and play and is the focus of this article.\nGame equipment.\nOld Hong Kong mahjong is played with a standard set of 144 mahjong tiles (though cards may be used). Sets often include counters (to keep score), dice (to decide how to deal), and a marker to show who the dealer is and which round is being played. Some sets include racks to hold the tiles, especially if they are larger or smaller than standard tiles or have an odd shape. Mahjong sets originating from the United States, Japan or Southeast Asia will likely have extra tiles or specialized markings.\nThe tiles are split into three categories: suited, honors, and bonus tiles.\nSuited tiles.\nSuited tiles are divided into three suits and each are numbered from 1 to 9. The suits are bamboos, dots, and characters. There are four identical copies of each suited tile totaling 108 tiles.\nThe bamboo suit is also known as \"sticks\", \"strings\" or \"bams\" suit; the first tile usually has a bird (traditionally, a peacock or sparrow) instead of a single bamboo. The dots suit is also known as the \"wheels\", \"circles\", \"coins\", \"stones\", \"marbles\" or \"balls\" suit. The characters suit is also known as the \"myriads\", \"cracks\" or \"numbers\" suit since the top characters are numbers in the Chinese writing system, and the bottom characters (in traditional Chinese characters) are the Chinese character for \"ten thousand\".\nHonors tiles.\nThere are two different sets of honors tiles: winds and dragons. The winds are east, south, west, and north, beginning with east. The dragons are red, green, and white. The white dragon has a blue or black frame on the face of the piece or in some sets is entirely blank. These tiles have no numerical sequence like the suited tiles (for example the bamboo pieces number 1 to 9). Like the suited tiles, there are four identical copies of each honors tile, for a total of 28 honors tiles.\nBonus tiles.\nThere are two sets of bonus tiles: flowers and seasons. The flower and season tiles play a unique role in the mechanics of the game. When drawn, the bonus tile is not added into a player's hand but are instead set aside and kept near the player's other tiles for scoring purposes should they win the hand, and an extra tile is drawn in replacement of the bonus tile.\nIn addition, unlike the suited and honors tiles, there is only one of each bonus tile, so there are a total of four flower and four season tiles in the set. The tiles have a different artistic rendering of a specific type of flower or season.\nIt is not necessary to know the names or the Chinese characters of each bonus tile, only the number, as this is associated with a specific direction, and the player receives bonus points when the bonus tile matches the seat direction. There is no relation between the bonus tile \"bamboo\" flower and the bamboo suit of suited tiles (e.g. 4 bamboo). In traditional Chinese culture, the Four Gentlemen are the plum (winter), orchid (spring), bamboo (summer), and chrysanthemum (autumn) which are regarded as the representative plants of those seasons, but people regard it as plum blossom (spring), orchid (summer), chrysanthemum (autumn) and bamboo (winter) now.\nChoosing table positions and first dealer.\nBefore the game can begin, players need to be assigned one of the wind positions at the table \u2013 those being (in counterclockwise order) East, South, West, and North. East will also be the first dealer. Play proceeds in this counterclockwise order.\nThere are a variety of ways to determine positions. For example, one way is to have each player roll dice and assign East to the player that rolls the highest, South to the second-highest, and so on. Another way is to shuffle the 4 wind tiles face down and have each player choose one, determining their position.\nHands, rounds, and matches.\nA match consists of four rounds, each representing a \"prevailing wind\", starting with East. Once the first round is completed, a second round begins with South as the prevailing wind, and so on. Wind position is significant in that it affects the scoring of the game. A mahjong set with winds in play will usually include a separate prevailing wind marker (typically a die marked with the wind characters in a holder).\nIn each round at least four hands are played, with each player taking the position of dealer. In the first hand of each round, Player 1 (winner of the dice toss) is East and therefore dealer. In the second hand, Player 2 takes the East position, shifting the seat winds amongst the players counter-clockwise (though players do not physically move their chairs). This continues until all four players have been East (dealer). A marker is used to mark which player is East and often the round number. (In sets with racks, a rack may be marked differently to denote the dealer.)\nWhenever a player in the East position (dealer) wins a hand, or if there is no winner (a draw or \"goulash hand\"), an extra hand is played with the same seating positions and prevailing wind as in the previous hand. This means that a match may potentially have no limit to the number of hands played (though some players will set a limit of three consecutive hands allowed with the same seat positions and prevailing wind).\nExample of games:\nDealing tiles.\nShuffling tiles.\nAll tiles are placed face down on the table and are shuffled. By convention all players should participate in shuffling using both hands moving the pieces around the table rigorously and loudly for a lengthy period. Tiles may get flipped up during this process and players should flip them facing down as soon as possible to avoid identifying the location of the revealed tiles.\nStacking tiles.\nEach player then stacks a row of 18 tiles, two tiles high in front of them (for a total of 36 tiles). Players then push each side of their stack together to form a square wall.\nRegular players usually place their stacks in a slightly diagonal position (about 20 to 30 degrees counter-clockwise); the right end of their stack is pushed slightly further in to the centre of the table to meet almost the middle of the stack of the player on the right. This creates a smaller square wall the length of about half of each stack, with walls extended away from each corner of the square. The diagonally positioned stacks and a smaller square creates a bigger space for players' tiles and also makes an ergonomic position for drawing tiles from the stack.\nDrawing tiles.\nThe dealer throws three dice in the square wall and sums up the total. Counting counter-clockwise so that the dealer is 1 (or 5, 9, 13, 17), so that south (player to the right) is 2 (or 6, 10, 14, 18), etc., a player's quarter of the wall is chosen. Some house rules may use only two dice but have double throws to increase randomness. In the case of double throws, the player of the chosen wall makes the second throw.\nUsing the same total on the dice (or the total of the two throws), the player whose wall is chosen then counts the stacks of tiles from right to left. (For double throws, the count may extend to the left side player's stack.) This determines the location where the 'deck' of tiles is cut. Starting from the left of the stacks counted, the dealer draws four tiles for their hand. Proceeding in counter-clockwise order, players take turns drawing blocks of four tiles (so that the stacks decrease clockwise) until each player (including the dealer) has 12 tiles. Each player then draws one last tile (top first, then bottom, then next stack etc. to make a 13-tile hand. The tile to be drawn is always the topmost tile left of the cut.\nDealing does not have to be strictly this way and may be done quite differently based on house rules. Tiles may flip over when being dealt and players should agree in advance on how to deal with the problem. Solutions include having the person who flipped the tile penalized points, shuffling the turned over piece back into the wall somehow, allowing the player to whom the tiles were dealt to take the piece or not (meaning the dealer must take it as their 14th piece), or other house rules.\nEach player now sets aside any flowers or seasons they may have drawn and takes turns to draw replacement tiles from the wall in the counter-clockwise direction from the dealer (the way this is done varies but can be as simple as first come first serve). In some rules, if a player gets any flowers or seasons tiles in the replacement draw, the players must wait for the next turn to draw replacement tiles.\nGame play starts.\nThe dealer draws a piece from the wall in clockwise direction, adding it to their hand. Typically, this draw is performed during the initial deal to speed up play. If this does not complete a legal hand, the dealer then discards a piece (throwing it into the middle of the wall with no particular order in mind).\nRules.\nEach player in turn, in counter-clockwise direction, draws a tile from the wall. When drawing, continue around the wall taking one piece from the wall (from where you last left off after dealing the tiles), top first, if that is taken, then the bottom one moving in the same direction the tiles were dealt (counter clockwise). The player then discard a tile (either the tile just drawn, or a tile in the hand) to maintain a hand of 13. The discarded tile is thrown into the centre and, if desired, the player announces out loud what the piece is. The other players have an opportunity to seize the discarded tile if they can make a meld with it; if no one takes it, the turn continues to the next player. Play continues this way until one player has a legal winning hand and calls out the win (each region does this call differently\u2014no Asian version uses the word \"mahjong\" to signal a win) while revealing their hand. Playing in English, players will usually shout out Mahjong!\nThere are four different ways that regular order of play can be interrupted:\nDuring play, each player's hand should always be 13 tiles (meaning in each turn a tile must be picked up and another discarded). The count of 13 tiles do not include any bonus tiles (flowers and seasons), which are set to the side, nor does it include the fourth added piece of a kong. If a player is seen to have fewer or more than 13 tiles in their hand outside of their turn they are penalised.\nLegal hand.\nA winning hand consists of 14 tiles. Since players always have 13 tiles in their hand during play, they must win by either drawing a piece from the wall that completes a 14-tile hand (\"winning from the wall\") or claiming a discard from another player which completes a 14-tile hand (\"winning by discard\"). The winning hand is made of four \"melds\" (a specific pattern of three pieces) and the \"eyes\" (a pair of identical pieces). The exceptions to this rule are the special hands listed below.\nMost players play with a table minimum, meaning a winning hand must score a minimum number of points (which can be seen in the scoring section). In Hong Kong mahjong the most common point set is three, but can be higher or lower depending on house rules.\nMelds.\nMelds are groups of tiles within the player's hand, consisting of either a pung (three identical tiles), a kong (four identical tiles), a chow (three tiles of the same suit in numerical sequence), or eyes (two identical tiles needed in a winning hand). Melds may be formed by drawing a tile from the wall, or by seizing another player's discard. There are rules governing which player has priority for a discard, and whether the meld should be exposed (displayed to all players) or remain concealed, depending on the manner in which the meld is formed.\nInterruption of play.\nThe regular counter-clockwise order of turns may be interrupted for four events:\n1. Flower or season.\nWhenever a player draws a flower or season, it is announced and then placed to the side (it is not considered a part of the 13-tile hand, but in the event that player wins, they may earn bonus points for them) and the last tile of the wall is drawn as a replacement tile so that the player has the 14 pieces needed before their discard. This may happen successively in a player's turn, each one needs to be set aside and a new tile taken from the wall.\n2. Melding by seizing a tile from another player's discard.\nWhen a player discards a tile, other players may seize the tile to complete a meld. Seizing tiles has both advantages (quickly forming a winning hand and scoring extra points) and disadvantages (being forced to reveal part of one's hand to other players and not being able to change the meld once declared).\nWhen a meld (pung, kong, or chow) is declared through seizing a discard, the player must state the type of meld to be declared and expose the meld by placing the three (or four) tiles face up. The player must then discard a tile, and play continues to the right of that player (this can disrupt the turn order). If the player who melds a discard is not directly after the discarder (in order of play), one or two players will essentially miss their turn as play continues counter-clockwise from the player who declared the meld.\nIf multiple players call for a discarded tile, priority for the discard depends on the declared action of the player stealing the discard.\n3. Winning a hand.\nThe act of winning a hand interrupts play to assess the validity of the hand won. Upon confirmation, the player is awarded the hand's value per the specific game's rule and points are settled.\nFrom a discard.\nIf at any point in the game a player can use another player's discard to complete a legal hand (and with the agreed minimum points), they declare a win and reveal their winning hand. This ends the hand, and scoring commences. If more than one player can use a discard to win the hand, there are multiple ways to handle the situation based on agreed table rules: The players might count the points they would win with the discard and the winner is the one with the higher score, the winner might simply be the player closest to the discarder in order of turn, or multiple players may be granted the win simultaneously.\nFrom the wall.\nAlternatively, a player may also win by drawing a tile that completes a legal hand. This is called \"winning from the wall\". In Hong Kong mahjong, winning from the wall doubles the number of base points each loser must pay.\nFalse win.\nTechnically, the declaration for winning a hand may be done at any time. However, the player must have a complete and legal hand. Otherwise, the player is penalized. The penalty depends on table rules. The player may forfeit points to the other players. Another potential penalty is the player who called out the false win must play the rest of the hand with their tiles face up on the table so other players can see them (open hand). Some methods apply the penalty at the end of the entire game. Again, the table rules dictate the enforcement of the penalty.\n4. Robbing a kong.\nA rarely occurring and high-scoring feature of Hong Kong mahjong is a move called robbing the kong. If a player declares a kong by adding a fourth piece to a melded pung but another player can use that piece to complete a hand, the completing player takes priority to win the hand and may steal that piece from the player who intended to declare the kong and wins the hand. Their winning hand will usually either form a chow with that piece or a special limit hand.\nExamples of winning hands.\nBelow are two examples of winning hands. A winning hand must consist of four melds (pungs, kongs, or chows) and a pair (eyes) and must also score the agreed table minimum.\nMost players include table variations in their games, of which some non-standard are included. The hands of \"seven different pairs\" and \"13 orphans\" are examples which do not have four melds and the eyes. They are described in more detail below.\nRepeated hands.\nIf the dealer wins the hand, they will remain the dealer and an extra hand is played in addition to the minimum 16 hands in a match.\nAn extra hand is also played if there is no winner by the time all the accessible tiles in the wall have been drawn. When there is no winner it is known as a goulash hand. Depending on table rules, the winner of the next game may take an agreed number of points from each player, carrying over the points from the non-winning hand to the winning one. If there are two or three goulash hands in a row then the winner would collect a considerable number of points from each player on top of their scoring hand. Because extra hands may be played every time a dealer wins or if there is a goulash hand, a match of 16 hands can easily become a match of 20 or even much more.\nAs table rules add a large amount of flexibility for players, they can choose to disregard the rule of extra hands and pass on the dealership regardless of who wins or if it results in a goulash hand. This puts a maximum estimated limit on the game duration and provides some amount of predictability.\nRhythm of play.\nPlayers may agree on table rules if the pace of the game is brisk or leisurely. For brisk games players may agree that a couple seconds after a discard are allowed for a \"window of opportunity\" before the next player picks up from the wall. Usually it is agreed once the next player has waited the duration of the \"window of opportunity\" and draws a tile from the wall, the previous discard is lost and cannot be claimed.\nScoring.\nOld Hong Kong scoring is relatively simple. There is only one winner (or if there is a draw the hand is replayed). The winner must have a legal hand that meets the minimum \"faan\" points agreed to in advance (not including any bonus points). Only the winner scores, and the other players pay the winner various sums. After each hand ends, the winner counts their \"faan\" points.\nConcealed vs. revealed meld and hand.\nA concealed meld is one that contains no tiles stolen from another player's discard. A concealed hand is one made up of only concealed melds. Many variations distinguish between a concealed hand (winning from the wall) and a semi concealed hand (the last tile is a stolen discard). In most mahjong variations having a concealed hand can be valuable in scoring. Hong Kong mahjong does not especially reward concealed melds/hands except for a few cases: limit hands or half-limit hands (thirteen orphans, heavenly gates, four concealed pungs) as well as a complete hand (seven pairs) and with several melds (three concealed pungs).\n\"Faan\" value.\nBasic \"faan\" value.\nA winning hand must include an agreed minimum amount of \"faan\" value (often 3). Some examples of scoring include:\nBonus \"faan\".\nA player only scores a bonus \"faan\" for flowers or seasons if it is their own flower or season (East=1, South=2, West=3 and North=4) or if the player has all four flowers or all four seasons (scoring 5 \"faan\" in total).\nPayment.\nThe losers pay the winning player points based on several criteria and depending on whether the game is for fun or for money. How points are reckoned is agreed by players beforehand. For example, they can keep a tally, exchange chips, or pay one another with money. The \"faan\" value of a hand is converted into base points which are then used to calculate the points the losers pay the winner. The table is progressive, doubling the number of base points when reaching a certain \"faan\" point target. The following is the Old Hong Kong simplified table; for other tables, see Hong Kong mahjong scoring rules.\nThis table is based on play where 3 \"faan\" is the minimum needed in order to win with a legal hand. If a player has 3 \"faan\", then their hand is worth one base point. A winning hand with 9 \"faan\" is worth four base points. Losing players must give the winning player the value of these base points. The following special cases result in doubled base points:\nIf two of these criteria apply to any player, they must double and then redouble the points owed to the winner.\nExamples.\nHong Kong mahjong is essentially a payment system of doubling and redoubling, where winning from the wall adds great value to the final payment and where the dealer is highly rewarded or penalised if they win or lose.\nLimit hands.\nIn Hong Kong mahjong there are a series of \"limit hands\". These are exceptional hands, difficult to obtain, and are very valuable in point scoring. As many table rules put a limit on the number of points a winner's hand can score, full limit hands score that maximum. Table rules dictate if these rare and special hands are allowed, which ones, and the limit for scoring. A common scoring limit is 64 points, which is the highest base points doubled twice. A winner receives the scoring limit from each player without any doubling.\nSome limit hands by necessity must be completely concealed (not discards used) or semi-concealed (the only discard used is the one needed to win). This includes the 13 orphans, 4 concealed pungs, heavenly hand and earthly hand. It is usually expected that the heavenly gates hand be concealed or semi-concealed. As for the dragon limit hands and the great winds, table rules dictate whether the hand must be concealed or not. Some table rules claim that a semi-concealed hand (winning from a discard) scores a half-limit.\nSome groups also play with the \"great flowers\" rule. If a player picks up all four flowers and all four seasons during their hand, they instantly win the hand and receive the maximum points from all of the players. This is exceptionally rare.\nIn all the hands that require pungs, each pung can be replaced by the corresponding kong.\nVariations.\nVariations may have far more complicated scoring systems, add or remove tiles, and include far more scoring elements and limit hands.\nIn many places, players often observe one version and are either unaware of other variations or claim that different versions are incorrect. In mainland China alone, there are over thirty variants, and across the world, there are over forty variations. Many variations today differ only by scoring.\n* Dutch tournament rules (\"Nederlandse Toernooi Spelregels\" or NTS) are a ruleset formalized in 2002 that is now maintained by the Dutch Mahjong Federation. Although nowadays not as popular as MCR in the Netherlands, it is still actively played in local clubs, tournaments, and living rooms.\n* Italian official rules (\"Regolamento Ufficiale Italiano\") are a ruleset maintained by the Italian Mahjong Federation.\n* In Korean three-player mahjong, one suit is omitted completely (usually the bamboo set or 2\u20138 of bamboo) as well as the seasons. The scoring is simpler and the play is faster. No melded chows are allowed and concealed hands are common. Riichi (much like its Japanese cousin) is an integral part of the game as well.\nEquipment.\nTables.\nMahjong playing surfaces are typically square and small enough to be within arm's length of all equipment. The edges are raised to prevent tiles from sliding off and the surface is covered in felt to limit wear on the tiles. Automatic dealing tables, often used for high stakes playing and tournaments, are able to shuffle tiles, build walls, and randomize dice. It is an elaborate device built into a table which uses two alternating sets of tiles. It shuffles one set of tiles while the players play on the other set. After the round is finished the tiles are dropped into the table and the standby wall raises upwards.\nTiles.\nThe following chart shows the most generic set of tiles\nThere are variations that feature specific use of tiles. Some three-player versions remove the North wind and one Chinese provincial version has no honors. Korean mahjong removes the bamboo suit or at least its numbers 2\u20138 so that terminals can be used. Japanese mahjong rarely uses flowers or seasons. The seasons are removed in Korean mahjong, while many Southeast Asian sets have more flower series.\nWild cards and jokers.\nSome mahjong variants accept wildcard tiles. The wildcard tiles are decided at the beginning of the game by choosing one random tile. The wild card could be the immediately following tile on the wall, after distributing tiles to all players, or it could also be separately decided by a dice throw. Wildcard tiles cannot be discarded and can only replace tiles in chows. Wildcard tiles cannot replace tiles in pungs and kongs. For example, if a character 4 is chosen, then character 4 and the next sequential tile, character 5, can be used as wild cards in this round. (When the wildcard indicator is chosen and exposed, only 3 tiles remain of the same denomination, so the next tile in the suit will also be used as a wildcard, adding to 7 wildcard tiles for 4 players.) Also, if a tile numbered 9 is the indicator, the suits circle back to 1, after 9. Thus, the number 9 and 1 are wild cards.\nAlso, if the chosen tile is not in the suited tiles, the wild cards are decided in rules:\nThe bonus tiles are not available for wild cards.\nA feature of several variations of mahjong, most notably in American mahjong, is the notion of some number of Joker tiles. They may be used as a wild card: a substitute for any tile in a hand, or, in some variations, only tiles in melds. Another variation is that the Joker tile may \"not\" be used for melding. Depending on the variation, a player may replace a Joker tile that is part of an exposed meld belonging to any player with the tile it represents.\nRules governing discarding Joker tiles also exist; some variations permit the Joker tile to take on the identity of any tile, and others only permit the Joker tile to take on the identity of the previously discarded tile (or the absence of a tile, if it is the first discard).\nJoker tiles may or may not affect scoring, depending on the variation. Some special hands may require the use of Joker tiles (for example, to represent a \"fifth tile\" of a certain suited or honor tile).\nIn American mahjong, it is illegal to pass Jokers during the Charleston.\nFlowers.\nJapanese rule sets discourage the use of flowers and seasons. Korean rules and three-player mahjong in the Korean/Japanese tradition use only flowers. In Singapore and Malaysia an extra set of bonus tiles of four animals are used. The rule set includes a unique function in that players who get two specific animals get a one-time immediate payout from all players. In Taiwanese mahjong, getting all eight flowers and seasons constitutes an automatic win of the hand and specific payout from all players.\nFour of the flower tiles represent the four noble plants of Confucian reckoning:\nThe other 4 flower tiles (or season tiles) represent seasons:\nThese animal tiles are used in Malaysia, Singapore and local variations. They represent the cat, mouse, rooster and centipede. Like flower tiles, they also function as bonus tiles. However, as they have no corresponding seat position, any player who draws one of these gets a bonus point.\nWalls.\nAll tiles are placed face down and shuffled. Each player then stacks a row of tiles two tiles high in front of them, the length of the row depending on the number of tiles in use:\nDice, markers, and counting pieces.\nDepending on the variation, two or three dice are usually used to decide what part of the wall to start dealing from. They are six-sided dice, traditionally but not necessarily Chinese dice with red one and four pips.\nThe dealer marker is a round or square object that the dealer places to the side to remind players who the dealer is. The wind marker may be used which indicates the current prevailing wind. In some cases the dealer marker and the wind marker are represented by one large marker, usually a small wheel where one can swivel the outer circle to indicate the prevailing wind (which the dealer holds onto), a cube with the four winds placed onto four of the sides which can be placed in a hollow square (the dealer holds onto it), or a cylinder locked into frame which can be rolled to expose the wind on the top. Japanese mahjong, especially in a gambling environment, may optionally use four yakitori markers to indicate which players have not won a hand yet and has to pay a penalty.\nThere are a variety of counting pieces used in different countries. They range from Chinese or Japanese counting sticks (thin sticks with various dots on them to represent various points), jetons, play money, paper and pencil, or various apps on touchscreen devices used to calculate and keep scores.\nRules.\nJapanese and Korean mahjong have some special rules. A player cannot win by a discard if that player had already discarded that piece, where players' discards are kept in neat rows in front of them. Players may declare ready, meaning that they need one tile to win, cannot change their hand and win extra points if they win. Some rules may replace some of the number 5 tiles with red tiles, as they can earn more points. Korean mahjong does not allow melded (stolen) chows.\nTaiwanese mahjong adds three tiles to a hand requiring a 5th set to be formed, making a clean hand or all-pung hand very difficult to procure.\nAmerican mahjong has distinctive game mechanics and the article on American mahjong details these. Some differences include many special patterns, a different scoring system and the use of jokers and five-of-a-kind.\nCharleston.\nIn the American variations it is required that, before each hand begins, a Charleston be enacted. In the first exchange, three tiles are passed to the player on one's right; in the next exchange, the tiles are passed to the player opposite, followed by three tiles passed to the left. If all players are in agreement, a second Charleston is performed; however, any player may decide to stop passing after the first Charleston is complete. The Charleston is followed by an optional pass to the player across of one, two, or three tiles. The Charleston, a distinctive feature of American mahjong, may have been borrowed from card games such as Hearts.\nHands.\nMany variations have specific hands, some of which are common while some are optional depending on regions and players. One example is the Pure Green hand made of chows or pungs using 2, 3, 4, 6, 8 of bamboo and green dragon.\nReady hands.\nWhen a hand is one tile short of winning (for example: , waiting for: , , or , as can be the eyes), the hand is said to be a ready hand, or more figuratively, \"on the pot\". The player holding a ready hand is said to be \"waiting\" for certain tiles. It is common to be waiting for two or three tiles, and some variations award points for a hand that is waiting for one tile. In 13-tile mahjong, the largest number of tiles for which a player can wait is 13 (the \"thirteen wonders\", or \"13 orphans\", a nonstandard special hand). Ready hands must be declared in some variations of mahjong, while other variations prohibit the same.\nSome variations of mahjong, most notably Japanese and Korean ones, allow a player to declare . A declaration of \"r\u012bchi\" is a promise that any tile drawn by the player is immediately discarded unless it constitutes a win. Standard requirements for \"r\u012bchi\" are that the hand be \"closed\" or have no melds declared (other than a concealed kong) and that players already have points for declaration of \"r\u012bchi\". A player who declares \"r\u012bchi\" and wins usually receives a point bonus for their hand directly, and a player who won with \"r\u012bchi\" also has the advantage to open the inner dora which leads to higher possibilities to match such a card, thus has more chance to grant additional bonus. However, a player who declares \"r\u012bchi\" and loses is usually penalised in some fashion. Declaring a nonexistent \"r\u012bchi\" is also penalised in some way.\nIn some variations, a situation in which all four players declare a \"r\u012bchi\" is an automatic drawn game, as it reduces the game down to pure luck, i.e., who gets their needed tile first.\nDraws.\nIf only the dead wall remains (or if no dead wall exists and the wall is depleted) and no one has won, the hand is drawn. A new hand begins, and depending on the variant, the Game Wind may change. For example, in most playing circles in Singapore, if there is at least one kong when the hand is a draw, the following player of the dealer becomes the next dealer; otherwise, the dealer remains dealer.\nJapanese mahjong has a special rule called sanchah\u014d, which is, if three players claim the same discard in order to win, the hand is drawn. One reason for this is that there are cases in which bars of 1,000 points for declaring \"r\u012bchi\" cannot be divided by three. The rule is treated the same as \"abortive draws\".\nAbortive draws.\nIn Japanese mahjong, rules allow abortive draws to be declared while tiles are still available. They can be declared under the following conditions:\nScoring.\nScoring in mahjong involves points, with a monetary value for points agreed upon by players. Although in many variations scoreless hands are possible, many require that hands be of some point value in order to win the hand.\nWhile the basic rules are more or less the same throughout mahjong, the greatest divergence between variations lies in the scoring systems. Like the rules, there is a generalized system of scoring, based on the method of winning and the winning hand, from which Chinese and Japanese base their roots. American mahjong generally has greatly divergent scoring rules, as well as greatly divergent general rules.\nBecause of the large differences between the various systems of scoring (especially for Chinese variants), groups of players will often agree on particular scoring rules before a game.\nPoints.\nPoints (terminology of which differs from variation to variation) are obtained by matching the winning hand with different criteria scoring different values. The points obtained may be modified into scores for each player using some (typically exponential) functions. Some criteria may be also in terms of both points and score.\nIn many variations the dealer receives no scoring bonus and does not maintain their turn by winning or a dead hand.\nIn classical mahjong all players score points. Points are given for sets and hand composition and winning bonuses, doubled and redoubled for basic patterns. Sometimes a loser may score more points than a winner. Japanese mahjong has a complex scoring system with several stages of scoring, rules and exceptions, evening out scores and bonus points at the end of a match. Korean mahjong has a simple scoring system where only winner scores without any form of doubling.\nSome variations give points for concealed hands, in which case no melds are made except by winning on a discard.\nIn Old Hong Kong mahjong:\nMahjong solitaire.\nA single player game employs the tiles of mahjong, usually played on computers or devices. Gameplay is entirely unrelated to mahjong or its variations and is a recent invention. The game involves stacking tiles face up in various elaborate patterns and removing uncovered matching tiles at the end of rows.\nCompetition.\nIn 1998, in the interest of dissociating illegal gambling from Mahjong, the China State Sports Commission published a new set of rules, now generally referred to as Chinese Official rules or International Tournament rules (). The principles of the new, wholesome Mahjong are no gambling, no drinking, and no smoking. In international tournaments, players are often grouped in teams to emphasize that Mahjong from now on is considered a sport.\nThe new rules are highly pattern-based. The rulebook contains 81 combinations, based on patterns and scoring elements popular in classic and modern regional Chinese variants; some table practices of Japan have also been adopted. Points for flower tiles (each flower is worth one point) may not be added until the player has scored eight points. The winner of a game receives the score from the player who discards the winning tile, plus eight basic points from each player; in the case of \"zimo\" (self-drawn win), they receive the value of this round plus eight points from all players.\nThe new rules were first used in an international tournament in Tokyo, where, in 2002, the first global tournament in mahjong was organized by the Mahjong Museum, the Japan Mahjong Organizing Committee, and the city council of Ningbo, China. One hundred players participated, mainly from Japan and China, but also from Europe and the United States. Mai Hatsune, from Japan, became the first world champion. The following year saw the first annual China Mahjong Championship, held in Hainan; the next two annual tournaments were held in Hong Kong and Beijing. Most players were Chinese; players from other nations attended as well.\nIn 2005, the first Open European Mahjong Championship was held in the Netherlands, with 108 players. The competition was won by Masato Chiba from Japan. The second European championship in Copenhagen (2007) was attended by 136 players and won by Danish player Martin Wedel Jacobsen. \nThe first Online European Mahjong Championship was held on the Mahjong Time server in 2007, with 64 players, and the winner was Juliani Leo, from the U.S., and the Best European Player was Gerda van Oorschot, from the Netherlands. The Third Open European Mahjong Championship 2009 at Baden/Vienna, Austria, was won by Japanese player Koji Idota, while runner-up Bo Lang from Switzerland became European Champion. There were 152 participants.\nThe fourth European Mahjong Championship was held in Mestre, Italy, on October 8th, 2011. There were 160 participants and it was won by Ildik\u00f3 Hargitai from Hungary. \nTournaments Calendar - EMA Rankings/\nIn 2006, the World Mahjong Organization (WMO) was founded in Beijing, China, with the cooperation of, amongst others, the Japan Mahjong Organizing Committee (JMOC) and the European Mahjong Association (EMA). This organization held its first World Mahjong Championship in November 2007 in the Chinese town of Chengdu, attended by 144 participants from all over the world. It was won by Li Li, a Chinese student at Tsinghua University. The next World Championship took place in Utrecht, the Netherlands, 27 to 29 August 2010.\nOther major international tournaments include the Mahjong International League's World Mahjong Sports Games and the privately sponsored World Series Of Mahjong.\nAmerican mahjong tournaments are held in virtually every state\u2014the largest is in Las Vegas, Nevada, twice a year, and in Atlantic City, New Jersey, by Mah Jongg Madness (MJM), and an annual cruise is hosted by the National Mah Jongg League and MJM. MJM tournaments host between 150 and 500 participants at these larger events; there are several smaller-scale, but equally successful, tournaments held annually by other hosts. Prize pools are based on the number participating. Rules are based on the National Mah Jongg League standard rules.\nHistory.\nThere are two disputed origin of mahjong, namely Ningbo and Fujian. The author of the first mahjong guidebook, Yifan Shen, wrote in his book \"Illustrated Mahjong Guide\" (1914) that the birth of mahjong was roughly thirty years ago in Ningbo,which is around the late 19th century. In the book \"Endless History (\u535a\u53f2\uff09\u201d written by Chinese scholar Yaquan Du in 1933, he believed that \"mahjong was originally popular among fishermen in Guangdong and Fujian. Later in the early years of Guangxu, it spreaded among the businessmen in Ningbo. Roughly speaking, mahjong started in late Qing, around the 19th century, with different scholars debating its actual year of invention. Late Qing scholar, lecturer of the Shanghai Jiaotong University, Zhixian Xu wrote in the book \"Folklore of the Ten Leaves\" that the popularity of mahjong grew in the last years of Guangxu (after the end of the First Sino-Japanese War in 1914). We can conclude that the decades between the late 19th century to the early 20th century were the infant years of mahjong. \nMahjong is based on draw-and-discard card games that were popular in 18th and 19th century China, some of which are still popular today. They were played with a stripped deck of money-suited cards. Each deck is divided into three suits of Cash or coins, Strings of cash, and Myriads of strings. There are nine ranks in each suit. In addition, there are three wild cards: Red flower, White flower, and Old thousand. Depending on the game, there are multiple copies of each card.\nGames scholar David Parlett has written that the Western card games Conquian and Rummy share a common origin with Mahjong. All these games involve players drawing and discarding tiles or cards to make melds. Khanhoo is an early example of such a game. The most likely ancestor to Mahjong was \"p\u00e8ngh\u00fa\" which was played with 120 or 150 cards. During the late 19th century, \"p\u00e8ngh\u00fa\" was used interchangeably with \"m\u00e1qu\u00e8\" in both card and tile form.\nIt is not known when the conversion from cards to tiles took place precisely but it most likely occurred in the middle of the 19th century. The earliest surviving tile sets date to around 1870 and were acquired in Fuzhou, Shanghai, and Ningbo. These sets differ from modern ones in several ways, there were no \"flower\" and \"f\u0101\" (\"green dragon\") tiles. In their place were \"king\" tiles for heaven, earth, man, and harmony and also for each of the 4 \"winds\" which may have acted as bonus tiles. In the contemporaneous Himly set, there were no \"zh\u014dng\" (\"red dragon\") tiles either. Instead there were the wild cards known as Cash Flower, String Flower, and Myriad Flower plus an additional tile, the king of everything. These early jokers are still found in Vietnamese sets. They may have been removed as the tiles share the same titles as the leaders of the Taiping Rebellion (1850\u20131864). For example, Hong Xiuquan was the self-styled \"Heavenly King of Great Peace\" and his top subordinates were called east king, south king, west king, and north king.\nThe ban on gambling after the founding of the People's Republic in 1949 led to a decline in playing. The game itself was banned during the Cultural Revolution (1966\u20131976). Today, it is a favorite pastime in China and other Chinese-speaking communities.\nMahjong in the West.\nThe first Western records about mahjong seem to correspond to the papers of British Consul General F.E.B. Harvey, around the time when he served as consul in Ningbo, during the 1860s. He mentions in his papers making the acquaintance of an English-fluent, rank-three official under the Daoguang Emperor, Chen Yumen, who taught him the game. In the same writings he details the rules he was taught by Chen. In 1895, British sinologist William Henry Wilkinson wrote a paper which mentioned a set of cards known in central China by the name of \"ma chioh\", literally, hemp sparrow, which he maintained was the origin of the term Mahjong. He did not explain the dialect of the originator or region specific etymology of this information. By 1910, there were written accounts in many languages, including French and Japanese.\nThe game was imported to the United States in the 1920s. The first Mahjong sets sold in the U.S. were sold by Abercrombie &amp; Fitch starting in 1920. It became a success in Washington, D.C., and the co-owner of the company, Ezra Fitch, sent emissaries to Chinese villages to buy every Mahjong set they could find. Abercrombie &amp; Fitch sold a total of 12,000 Mahjong sets. Mahjong became a central part of cultural bonding for Chinese Americans in the 1920s and '30s in Chinatown, Manhattan and was part of community building for suburban American Jewish women in the 1940s and 50s.\nAlso in 1920, Joseph Park Babcock published his book \"Rules of Mah-Jongg\", also known as the \"red book\". This was the earliest version of Mahjong known in America. Babcock had learned Mahjong while living in China. His rules simplified the game to make it easier for Americans to take up, and his version was common through the Mahjong fad of the 1920s. Later, when the 1920s fad died out, many of Babcock's simplifications were abandoned.\nThe game has taken on a number of trademarked names, such as \"Pung Chow\" and the \"Game of Thousand Intelligences\". Mahjong nights in America often involved dressing and decorating rooms in Chinese style. Several hit songs were recorded during the Mahjong fad, most notably \"Since Ma Is Playing Mah Jong\" by Eddie Cantor.\nMany variants of Mahjong developed during this period. By the 1930s, many revisions of the rules developed that were substantially different from Babcock's classical version (including some that were considered fundamentals in other variants, such as the notion of a standard hand). Standardization came with the formation of the National Mah Jongg League (NMJL) in 1937, along with the first American Mahjong rulebook, \"Maajh: The American Version of the Ancient Chinese Game\", written by NMJL's first president and co-founder, Viola L. Cecil. In 1999, a second organization was formed, the American Mah Jongg Association.\nIn the United Kingdom, British author Alan D. Millington revived the Chinese classical game of the 1920s with his book \"The Complete Book of Mah-jongg\" (1977). This handbook includes a formal rules set for the game.\nCurrent development.\nThere are many governing bodies which often host exhibition games and tournaments for modern and traditional Mahjong gaming.\nMahjong, as of 2010, is the most popular table game in Japan. As of 2008, there were approximately 7.6 million Mahjong players in Japan and an estimated 8,900 Mahjong parlors did \u00a5300 billion (converting to US$2.8 billion according to exchange rates for 30 April 2020) in sales. There are several manga and anime (e.g. \"Saki\" and \"Akagi\") devoted to dramatic and comic situations involving Mahjong. Since the 1980s, hundreds of different Mahjong arcade machines in Japanese video arcades have been created, including strip versions. Newer units can connect with other arcade machines across the Internet.\nMahjong culture is still deeply ingrained in the Chinese community. Sam Hui wrote Cantopop songs using Mahjong as their themes, and Hong Kong movies have often included scenes of Mahjong games. Many gambling movies have been filmed in Hong Kong, and a recent subgenre is the Mahjong movie.\nAlthough the popularity of the game in China is still broad, since 1949, mahjong was frowned upon by the government because it is seen as a means of gambling addiction, an issue that the government always sought to tackle.\nProlonged playing of Mahjong may trigger epileptic seizures according to a 2007 study. To date there are 23 reported cases of Mahjong-induced seizures in the English medical literature. Some doctors speculate that this may be due to stress and complex manual movement correlated with intense brain function similar to playing chess or card games such as poker.\nStudies by doctors have also shown in Hong Kong that the game is beneficial for individuals suffering from dementia or cognitive memory difficulties, leading to the development of Mahjong therapy. Many elderly in Hong Kong actively and regularly go to Mahjong Schools as a form of leisure and entertainment activities. As the Government does not allow gambling after World War II, the Government issued 144 licenses to these \"schools\" in 1956 in order to legalize the operation of places that provide Mahjong entertainment.\nResearchers have also used artificial intelligence techniques to develop Mahjong-playing agents using neural networks and reinforcement learning. They have shown that a self-learning machine can be trained to compete with some of the best Richi Mahjong players.\nSuperstitions.\nEven though both skill and chance play a fundamental role in the game, there is no shortage of superstitions in which players believe where they sit, how they hold their pieces or objects they have on their person will somehow affect the outcome. For example, players will try to find seats with the best feng shui or wear their lucky clothing or trinkets. Usually, after one round (everybody has been the dealer once in a particular prevailing wind), player will switch seats. Yet, some players may refuse to do so when they have won multiple games sitting in that seat. They may believe that position possesses luck that is beneficial to them, although feng shui is not science-based. Some believe that specific pieces (one dot, for example) bode bad luck if received in their opening hand. The belief of feng shui is still rather prevalent in the Chinese society, with over 47% of Chinese adults believing in it.\nMore elaborate superstitions in mahjong range from those found in the game poker, such as not counting one's wins and losses, to the comical, such as changing one's undergarments after a loss. As with all superstitions in gaming, none of them have been properly demonstrated as effective, though, for some, the rituals have become an integral part of the game experience and its aesthetics.\nIn popular culture.\nIn the Korean television series, \"My Love from the Star\", the character Do Min Joon (played by Kim Soo-Hyun) plays Mah-jong and becomes the best player in Seoul. Wong Kar-Wai's film \"In the Mood for Love\" takes place in 1962 Hong Kong. The families and owners who live in the boarding house play there for entire nights.\nThe manga and anime \"Saki\" revolves around a high school Mahjong club. \"Akagi\" and its prequel \"Ten\" deal with a college student who quickly becomes a prodigy of Mahjong, evolving within the Yakuza. Other manga with include \"Furiten-kun\", \"\" and \"The Legend of Koizumi\".\nIn Thomas Harris's novel \"Red Dragon\", a serial killer, who calls himself the \"Red Dragon\", carves the Mahjong symbol corresponding to his nickname on a tree.\nMahjong serves as a minor plot point in the 2016 film \"Arrival\" where General Shang uses the game to interact with the extraterrestrials.\nThe video game series \"Like a Dragon\" allows a player to play Mah-jong games in the form of mini-games. In \"Final Fantasy XIV\", a game called Doman Mahjong, a version strongly inspired by Mah-jong Riichi, can be played individually or multiplayer at the Gold Saucer, a casino inspired by \"Final Fantasy VII\". The MMORPG offers two game rules, one option with kuitan authorizes the formation of the yaku Tanyao after the announcement of chi, pon or kan.\nIn the 2008 American animated comedy film \"Kung Fu Panda\", Po's father, won his noodle shop in a Mahjong game. Mahjong is subtly present throughout the whole franchise of film, TV series and games.\nIn \"Le th\u00e9or\u00e8me de Marguerite\" (2023) by Anna Novion, the heroine Marguerite, a brilliant doctoral student in mathematics at the ENS, starts playing Mah-jong to earn money.\nIn the 2018 film \"Crazy Rich Asians\", the main character Rachel lets the extremely traditional mother of her boyfriend win a Mahjong game at a parlor as a major plot point to convey the nature of their relationship.\nReferences.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nHistorical research.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nChinese classic.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nChinese official.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Dubbed the \"Songbird Supreme\", Carey is known for her five-octave vocal range, melismatic singing style, signature use of the whistle register, and diva persona. An influential figure in music, she was ranked as the fifth-greatest singer of all time by \"Rolling Stone\" in 2023.\nCarey rose to fame in 1990 with her eponymous debut album and became the only artist to have their first five singles reach number one on the US \"Billboard\" Hot 100 chart, from \"Vision of Love\" to \"Emotions\". She achieved international success with the best-selling albums \"Music Box\" (1993) and \"Daydream\" (1995), before adopting a new image with hip hop-inflected sounds, following a remix to \"Fantasy\" with Ol' Dirty Bastard, and more extensively on \"Butterfly\" (1997). With eleven consecutive years of US number-one singles, Carey was named by \"Billboard\" as the Artist of the Decade. Following the failure of her film \"Glitter\" (2001) and a relative career decline, she made a comeback with \"The Emancipation of Mimi\" (2005), one of the best-selling albums of the 21st century. She has released six more albums to critical success.\nCarey's life and career have received widespread media coverage. She has been dubbed the \"Queen of Christmas\" due to the enduring popularity of her holiday music, particularly \"Merry Christmas\" (1994), one of the best-selling holiday albums, and its single \"All I Want for Christmas Is You\", which is one of the best selling singles in history. Outside of music, she co-founded Camp Mariah with the Fresh Air Fund in 1994; starred in films such as \"Precious\" (2009), \"The Butler\" (2013), and \"The Lego Batman Movie\" (2017); and served as a judge on \"American Idol\" (2013). Her 2020 memoir, \"The Meaning of Mariah Carey\", reached number one on \"The New York Times\" Best Seller list.\nCarey is one of the best-selling music artists, with over 220 million records sold worldwide. She was inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame. Her accolades include 5 Grammy Awards, a Grammy Global Impact Award, 10 American Music Awards, 19 World Music Awards, 14 \"Billboard\" Music Awards, and MTV's Michael Jackson Video Vanguard Award. \"Time\" named her one of the 100 most influential people in the world in 2008. She holds the record for the most \"Billboard\" Hot 100 number-one singles by a solo artist (19), a female songwriter (18), and a female producer (15), spending a record 97 weeks atop the chart. \"One Sweet Day\" and \"We Belong Together\" were ranked by \"Billboard\" as the most successful songs of the 1990s and 2000s, respectively. Carey is one of the highest-certified artists in the US, with three diamond certifications.\nEarly life.\nCarey was born on March 27, 1969, in Huntington, New York. Her name is derived from the song \"They Call the Wind Maria\", originally from the 1951 Broadway musical \"Paint Your Wagon.\" She is the youngest of three children born to Patricia (n\u00e9e Hickey), a former opera singer and vocal coach of Irish descent, and Alfred Roy Carey, an aeronautical engineer of both African-American and Afro-Venezuelan lineage. The last name \"Carey\" was adopted by her Venezuelan grandfather, Roberto N\u00fa\u00f1ez, after he emigrated to New York. Patricia's family disowned her for marrying a black man. Racial tensions prevented the Carey family from integrating into their community. While they lived in Huntington, their neighbors poisoned the family dog and set fire to their car. After her parents' divorce, Carey had little contact with her father and spent much of her time at home alone and began singing at age three, often imitating her mother's take on Verdi's opera \"Rigoletto\" in Italian. Her older sister Alison moved in with their father while Mariah and her elder brother Morgan lived with their mother.\nDuring her years in elementary school, Carey excelled in the arts, such as music and literature. She began writing poetry and lyrics while attending Harborfields High School in Greenlawn, New York, where she graduated in 1987. Carey began vocal training under her mother's guidance. Though she was a classically trained opera singer, Patricia Carey never pressured her daughter to pursue a career in classical opera, with Mariah Carey stating that \"I respect opera like crazy, but it didn't influence me.\" In high school, Mariah Carey was often absent because of her work as a demo singer. Working in the Long Island music scene gave her opportunities to work with musicians such as Gavin Christopher and Ben Margulies, with whom she co-wrote material for her demo tape. After moving to New York City, she worked part-time jobs to pay the rent and completed 500 hours of beauty school. Carey moved into a one-bedroom apartment in Manhattan with four female students as roommates. She landed a gig singing backup for freestyle singer Brenda K. Starr.\nCareer.\n1988\u20131992: Eponymous debut album, \"Emotions\" and \"MTV Unplugged\".\nIn December 1988, Carey accompanied Starr to a music executive's party and handed her demo tape to the head of Columbia Records, Tommy Mottola. After listening to the tape during the ride home, he immediately requested the driver turn around. She had already left the event, and Mottola spent two weeks looking for her. Another record label expressed interest and a bidding war ensued. He signed Carey to Columbia and enlisted producers Ric Wake, Narada Michael Walden, and Rhett Lawrence for her first album.\nColumbia marketed Carey as the main female artist on their roster and spent over $1\u00a0million promoting Carey's debut studio album, \"Mariah Carey\". On June 5, 1990, Carey made her first public appearance at the 1990 NBA Finals, singing \"America the Beautiful\". The highlight was the whistle note toward the song's conclusion, sparking CBS Sports anchor Pat O'Brien to declare, \"The palace now has a queen.\" The album topped the US \"Billboard\" 200 for eleven consecutive weeks, after Carey's exposure at the 33rd Annual Grammy Awards, where she won the award for Best New Artist, and Best Female Pop Vocal Performance for her single \"Vision of Love\". The album's singles \"Vision of Love\", \"Love Takes Time\", \"Someday\", and \"I Don't Wanna Cry\" all topped the US \"Billboard\" Hot 100. \"Mariah Carey\" was the best-selling album in the United States in 1991, and achieved worldwide sales of 15 million copies.\nCarey co-wrote, co-produced, and recorded her second studio effort, \"Emotions\", during 1991. She described it as a homage to Motown soul music and employed the help of Walter Afanasieff, who only had a small role on her debut, as well as Robert Clivill\u00e9s and David Cole, from the dance group C+C Music Factory. Carey's relationship with Margulies deteriorated over a songwriting royalties dispute. After he filed a lawsuit against Columbia's parent company, Sony Music Entertainment, the songwriting duo parted ways. \"Emotions\" was released on September 17 that year. Its title track served as the album's lead single and became Carey's fifth chart topper on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100, making her the first artist whose first five singles reached the chart's summit. Though critics praised the album's content and described it as a more mature effort, the album was criticized as calculated and lacking originality. While the album managed sales of eight million copies globally, \"Emotions\" failed to reach the commercial and critical heights of its predecessor.\nCarey did not embark on a world tour to promote the album. Although she attributed this to stage fright and the vocally challenging nature of her material, speculation grew that Carey was a \"studio worm\" and incapable of producing the perfect pitch and five-octave vocal range for which she was known. In hopes of ending any speculation of her being a manufactured artist, Carey booked an appearance on \"MTV Unplugged\". Days prior to the show's taping, Carey and Afanasieff chose to add a cover of the Jackson 5's 1970 song \"I'll Be There\" to the set-list. On March 16, 1992, she played and recorded an intimate seven-song show at Kaufman Astoria Studios in Queens, New York. The acclaimed revue was aired more than three times as often as the average episode, and critics heralding it as a \"vocal Tour de force\". Carey's live version of \"I'll Be There\" became her sixth number-one single on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 chart. Sony capitalized on this success and released an extended play (EP) of her performance. It earned a triple-Platinum certification by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) and earned Gold and Platinum certifications in several European markets.\n1993\u20131996: \"Music Box\", \"Merry Christmas\" and \"Daydream\".\nFollowing years of dating, Carey and Mottola got married on June 5, 1993. After \"Emotions\" failed to achieve the commercial heights of her debut album, Carey's subsequent release was to be marketed as adult contemporary and pop-friendly. \"Music Box\" was produced by Carey and Afanasieff, and it began a songwriting partnership that would extend until 1997's \"Butterfly\". The album was released on August 31, 1993, to mixed reviews from music critics. Carey's songwriting was derided as clich\u00e9d and her vocal performances were described as less emotive and lazier in their delivery. In his review of the album, AllMusic's Ron Wynn concluded: \"sometimes excessive spirit is preferable to an absence of passion\". In promotion of the album, Carey embarked on her debut tour, a six-date concert series, the Music Box Tour. \"Music Box\"'s first and second singles, \"Dreamlover\" and \"Hero\", became Carey's seventh and eighth chart-toppers in the United States, while her cover of Badfinger's \"Without You\" became her first number-one single in Germany, Sweden and the United Kingdom. \"Music Box\" remains Carey's best-seller and one of the best-selling albums, with worldwide sales of over 28 million copies.\nIn mid-1994, Carey and Luther Vandross recorded and released a cover of Lionel Richie and Diana Ross's \"Endless Love\". \"Merry Christmas\", released on November 1, 1994, became the best-selling Christmas album, with global sales of over 15 million copies. The lead single, \"All I Want for Christmas Is You\", became a holiday standard and continues to surge in popularity each holiday season. By October 2017, it had become the 11th best-selling single in history with over 16 million copies sold worldwide.\nCarey's fifth studio album, \"Daydream\", found her consolidating creative control over her career, leading to tensions with Columbia. Songs from her prior two albums had been primarily shaped by Mottola's conceptualization of what Carey should sound like, as innocent and wholesome tracks dominated by her vocal performance. \"Daydream\" featured a departure from her allegiance to pop and gravitated heavily towards R&amp;B and hip hop. Critically, the album was described as Carey's best to date. \"The New York Times\" named it one of 1995's best albums and wrote it \"brings R&amp;B candy-making to a new peak of textural refinement ... Carey's songwriting has taken a leap forward and become more relaxed, sexier and less reliant on thudding clich\u00e9s.\" Its lead single, \"Fantasy\", became the first single by a female artist to debut at number one on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100, and the second song overall after Michael Jackson's \"You Are Not Alone\". \"One Sweet Day\", a collaboration with R&amp;B group Boyz II Men, served as the second single from \"Daydream\" and remained atop the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 for a record-breaking 16 consecutive weeks, becoming the longest-running number-one song in the history of the charts at the time. It also opened at the top spot, becoming Carey's second track to do so. The album's third single, \"Always Be My Baby\", became Carey's eleventh chart-topper, tying her with Madonna and Whitney Houston for the most number-one singles among female artists at the time.\n\"Daydream\" became Carey's biggest-selling album in the United States, and her second album to be certified Diamond by the RIAA, after \"Music Box\". The album continued Carey's dominance in Asian music markets and sold in excess of 2.2 million copies in Japan alone and over 20 million copies globally. \"Daydream\" and its singles were nominated in six categories at the 38th Grammy Awards. Though considered a favorite to win the top awards of the evening, Carey was shut out, prompting her to comment \"What can you do? I will never be disappointed again.\" In early 1996, she embarked on her first international string of concerts, the Daydream World Tour. Its seven dates spanned three in Japan and four throughout Europe. \"Forbes\" named Carey the top-earning female musician of 1996, collecting an estimated $32 million.\nDuring the recording of \"Daydream\", Carey also worked on the alternative rock album \"Someone's Ugly Daughter\" by the band Chick, contributing writing, production, vocals and art direction. It was released during September 1995. As Columbia Records refused to release the album with her lead vocals, Carey's friend Clarissa Dane was brought in to become the face of Chick, and her vocals were layered on top of Carey's, masking her voice. Her contributions were secret until the release of her 2020 memoir \"The Meaning of Mariah Carey\".\n1997\u20132000: New image with \"Butterfly\" and \"Rainbow\".\nCarey's subsequent musical releases followed the trend that began with \"Daydream\". Her music began relying less on pop and adult contemporary-tinged balladry and instead incorporating heavy elements of hip hop and R&amp;B. On \"Butterfly\", she collaborated with a bevy of producers other than Afanasieff, such as Sean Combs, Q-Tip and Missy Elliott. \"Butterfly\" was released on September 10, 1997, and introduced a more subdued style of singing, with critics noting Carey's incorporation of breathy vocals. Some viewed her lack of propensity to use her upper range as a sign of maturity, while others questioned whether it forebode waning vocal prowess. The music video for the album's lead single, \"Honey\", her first since separating from Mottola, introduced a more overtly sexual image. \"Butterfly\" became Carey's best-reviewed album, with attention placed on the album's exploration of more mature lyrical themes. In their review of the album, \"Rolling Stone\" wrote it was \"not as if Carey has totally dispensed with her old saccharine, Houston-style balladry ... but the predominant mood of \"Butterfly\" is one of coolly erotic reverie.\" AllMusic editor Stephen Thomas Erlewine described Carey's vocals as \"sultrier and more controlled than ever,\" and felt the album \"illustrates that Carey continues to improve and refine her music, which makes her a rarity among her '90s peers.'\" \"Honey\" and \"My All\", the album's fifth single, both topped the Hot 100, making Carey a female artist with the most number-one singles in the chart's history. Though a commercial success, \"Butterfly\" failed to reach the commercial heights of her previous albums, \"Music Box\" and \"Daydream\".\nAfter concluding her Butterfly World Tour, Carey participated in the VH1 Divas benefit concert on April 14, 1998, where she sang alongside Aretha Franklin, Celine Dion, Shania Twain, Gloria Estefan, and Carole King. Carey began conceptualizing a film project \"All That Glitters\", later re-titled to simply \"Glitter\" (2001), and wrote songs for other projects, such as \"Men in Black\" (1997) and \"How the Grinch Stole Christmas\" (2000). After \"Glitter\" fell into developmental hell, Carey postponed the project and began writing material for a new album. Sony Music executives insisted she prepare a greatest hits collection in time for the holiday season. The album, titled \"#1's\" (1998), featured a cover of Brenda K. Starr's \"I Still Believe\" and a duet with Whitney Houston, \"When You Believe\", which was included on the soundtrack for \"The Prince of Egypt\" (1998). \"#1's\" became a phenomenon in Japan, selling over one million copies in its opening week, making Carey the only international artist to accomplish this feat. It sold over 3.25\u00a0million copies in Japan in its first three months and holds the record as the best-selling album by a non-Asian artist.\nWith only one album left to fulfill her contract with Sony, and with a desire to separate herself professionally from the record label her ex-husband still headed, Carey completed the album in three months in mid-1999. Titled \"Rainbow\", the album found Carey exploring with producers whom she had not worked with before. \"Rainbow\" became Carey's first album to not feature a collaboration with her longtime writing partner, Walter Afanasieff. She instead chose to work with David Foster and Diane Warren. \"Heartbreaker\" and \"Thank God I Found You\" both topped the \"Billboard\" Hot 100, while her rendition of Phil Collins' \"Against All Odds (Take a Look at Me Now)\" with Irish boy band Westlife became her second number-one song on the UK charts. \"Rainbow\" was released on November 2, 1999, to the highest first-week sales of her career at the time, and debuted at number two on the \"Billboard\" 200.\nCarey's tense relationship with Columbia grew increasingly fractious; she began posting messages on her website, sharing inside information with fans on the dispute, as well as instructing them to request \"Can't Take That Away (Mariah's Theme)\" on radio stations. Ultimately, the song was only given a very limited and low-promotion release. Critical reception of \"Rainbow\" was generally positive, with the general consensus finding: \"what began on \"Butterfly\" as a departure ends up on \"Rainbow\" a progression \u2013 perhaps the first compelling proof of Carey's true colors as an artist.\" Though a commercial success, \"Rainbow\" became Carey's lowest selling album at that point in her career.\n2001\u20132004: Personal and professional setbacks, \"Glitter\" and \"Charmbracelet\".\nCarey received \"Billboard\"'s Artist of the Decade Award and the World Music Award for Best-Selling Pop Female Artist of the Millennium, and parted from Columbia Records. She signed an unprecedented $80\u00a0million five-album recording contract with Virgin Records (EMI Records) in April 2001. \"Glitter\" was a musical departure, recreating a 1980s post-disco era to accompany the film, set in 1983. Carey was given full conceptual and creative control over the project. She said that Columbia had regarded her as a commodity, with her separation from Mottola exacerbating her relations with label executives. Carey's three-year relationship with Latin singer Luis Miguel ended.\nIn July 2001, Carey suffered a physical and emotional breakdown. She began posting disturbing messages on her website and behaved erratically in live promotional outings. On July 19, Carey made a surprise appearance on the MTV program \"Total Request Live\" (TRL). As the show's host Carson Daly began taping following a commercial break, she came out pushing an ice cream cart while wearing a large men's shirt and began a striptease that revealed a tight ensemble. She credited exhaustion for the appearance going awry. Days later, Carey posted irregular voice notes on her website. On July 26, she was hospitalized due to exhaustion and a \"physical and emotional breakdown\". Carey was admitted to a hospital in Connecticut and remained under doctor's care for two weeks, followed by an extended absence from the public. Virgin Records and 20th Century Fox delayed the release of \"Glitter\" and its soundtrack. Critics panned \"Glitter\" and its soundtrack; both were unsuccessful commercially. The soundtrack became Carey's lowest-selling album to that point. The \"St. Louis Post-Dispatch\" condemned it as \"an absolute mess that'll go down as an annoying blemish on [her] career\". She attributed the poor performance to her state of mind, its postponement and the soundtrack having been released on September 11.\nCarey's record deal with Virgin Records was bought out for $28 million. Carey described her time at Virgin \"a complete and total stress-fest.\" She signed a contract with Island Records, valued at more than $24 million, and launched the record label MonarC. Carey's father, Alfred Roy, with whom she had had little contact since childhood, died of cancer that year. Her song \"Sunflowers for Alfred Roy\" from \"Charmbracelet\" is dedicated to his memory. In 2002, she was cast in the independent film \"WiseGirls\" alongside Mira Sorvino and Melora Walters, who co-starred as waitresses at a mobster-operated restaurant. It premiered at the Sundance Film Festival, and received negative reviews, though Carey's performance was praised. Roger Friedman of Fox News described her as \"a Thelma Ritter for the new millennium\", and wrote, \"Her line delivery is sharp and she manages to get the right laughs.\"\nIn December 2002, Carey released her ninth studio album, \"Charmbracelet\", which she said marked \"a new lease on life\" for her. Sales of \"Charmbracelet\" were moderate and the quality of Carey's vocals came under criticism. Joan Anderson from \"The Boston Globe\" declared the album \"the worst of her career, and revealed a voice [that is] no longer capable of either gravity-defying gymnastics or soft coos\", while AllMusic editor Stephen Thomas Erlewine wrote, \"Mariah's voice is shot, sounding in tatters throughout the record. She can no longer coo or softly croon nor can she perform her trademark gravity-defying vocal runs.\" To support the album, Carey embarked on the Charmbracelet World Tour, spanning North America and East Asia over three months. While smaller venues were booked throughout the tour's stateside leg, Carey performed in stadiums in Asia and Europe. In the United Kingdom, it was her first tour to feature shows outside London. The tour garnered generally positive reviews, with many praising the production and Carey's vocals. In 2003, Carey featured on Busta Rhymes' \"I Know What You Want\".\n2005\u20132007: Resurgence with \"The Emancipation of Mimi\".\nCarey's tenth studio album, \"The Emancipation of Mimi\" in 2005, was produced with the Neptunes, Kanye West and Carey's longtime collaborator, Jermaine Dupri. She described the album as \"very much like a party record\". \"The Emancipation of Mimi\" topped the charts in the United States, becoming her fifth number-one album and first since \"Butterfly\" (1997), and was warmly accepted by critics. Caroline Sullivan of \"The Guardian\" defined it as \"cool, focused and urban [... some of] the first Mariah Carey tunes in years which I wouldn't have to be paid to listen to again,\" while \"USA Today\"'s Elysa Gardner wrote, \"The [songs] truly reflect the renewed confidence of a songbird who has taken her shots and kept on flying.\" The album's second single, \"We Belong Together\", became a \"career re-defining\" song for Carey, after a relatively unsuccessful period and a point when many critics had considered her career over.\nMusic critics heralded \"We Belong Together\" as her \"return to form,\" as well as the \"return of The Voice,\" while many felt it would revive \"faith\" in Carey's potential as a balladeer. \"We Belong Together\" broke several records in the United States and became Carey's sixteenth chart topper on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100. After staying at number one for fourteen non-consecutive weeks, the song became the second-longest-running number one song in US chart history, behind Carey's \"One Sweet Day\". \"Billboard\" listed it as the \"song of the decade\" and the ninth most popular song of all time. The song broke several airplay records, and according to Nielsen BDS, and gathered both the largest one-day and one-week audiences in history.\nDuring the week of September 25, 2005, Carey set another record, becoming the first woman to occupy the first two spots atop the Hot 100, as \"We Belong Together\" remained at number one, and her next single, \"Shake It Off\", moved into the number two spot (Ashanti had topped the chart in 2002 while being a featured singer on the number two single). On the US \"Billboard\" Hot 100 Year-end Chart of 2005, \"We Belong Together\" was declared the number one song, a first for Carey. The album was re-released as \"The Ultra Platinum Edition\", from which \"Don't Forget About Us\" became her seventeenth number-one in the United States.\n\"The Emancipation of Mimi\" earned ten Grammy Award nominations: eight in 2006 for the original release, the most received by Carey in a single year, and two in 2007 for the \"Ultra Platinum Edition\". Carey won Best Contemporary R&amp;B Album for \"The Emancipation of Mimi\" and Best Female R&amp;B Vocal Performance and Best R&amp;B Song for \"We Belong Together\". \"The Emancipation of Mimi\" was 2005's best-selling album in the United States, with nearly five million units sold. It was the first album by a solo female artist to become the year's best-selling album within the country since Alanis Morissette's \"Jagged Little Pill\" in 1996. At the end of 2005, the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry (IFPI) reported that \"The Emancipation of Mimi\" had sold more than 7.7\u00a0million copies globally, and was the second-best-selling album of the year after Coldplay's \"X&amp;Y\". It has since sold 12 million copies worldwide. In support of the album, Carey embarked on her first headlining tour in three years, named The Adventures of Mimi after a \"Carey-centric fan's\" music diary. The tour spanned 40 dates, with 32 in the United States and Canada, two in Africa, and six in Japan. It received warm reception from music critics and concert goers, many of which lauded Carey's vocals.\n2008\u20132009: \"E=MC\u00b2\", \"Memoirs of an Imperfect Angel\", and \"Precious\".\nIn early 2007, Carey began to work on her eleventh studio album, \"E=MC\u00b2\". Although the album was well received by some critics, others criticized it for being very similar to the formula used on \"The Emancipation of Mimi\". Two weeks before the album's release, \"Touch My Body\", the record's lead single, reached the top position on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100, becoming Carey's eighteenth number one and making her the solo artist with the most number one singles in United States history, pushing her past Elvis Presley into second place according to the magazine's revised methodology. Additionally, it gave Carey her 79th week atop the Hot 100, tying her with Presley as the artist with the most weeks at number one in the \"Billboard\" chart history.\"\n\"E=MC\u00b2\" debuted at number one on the \"Billboard\" 200 with 463,000 copies sold, the biggest opening week sales of her career. In 2008, Carey also played one of the lead roles in \"Tennessee\". Since the album's release, Carey had planned to embark on an extensive tour in support of \"E=MC\u00b2\". However, the tour was suddenly cancelled in early December 2008. Carey later stated that she had been pregnant during that time period and suffered a miscarriage, prompting the tour's cancellation. On January 20, 2009, Carey performed \"Hero\" at the Neighborhood Inaugural Ball after Barack Obama was sworn as the first African-American president of the United States. On July 7, 2009, Carey\u2014alongside Trey Lorenz\u2014performed her version of \"I'll Be There\" at the memorial service for Michael Jackson.\nIn 2009, she appeared as a social worker in \"Precious\", the movie adaptation of the 1996 novel \"Push\" by Sapphire. The film garnered mostly positive reviews from critics, also for Carey's performance. \"Variety\" described her acting as \"pitch-perfect\". In January 2010, Carey won the Breakthrough Actress Performance Award for her role in \"Precious\" at the Palm Springs International Film Festival.\nOn September 25, 2009, Carey's twelfth studio album, \"Memoirs of an Imperfect Angel\", was released. Reception for the album was mostly mixed; Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic called it \"her most interesting album in a decade,\" while Jon Caramanica from \"The New York Times\" criticized Carey's vocal performances, complaining she overused softer vocal registers at the expense of her more powerful lower and upper registers. Commercially, the album debuted at number three on the \"Billboard\" 200 with first week sales of 168,000 copies. \"Obsessed\" served as the lead single and peaked at number seven in the US, becoming Carey's 27th top-ten entry within the nation and tying her with Elton John and Janet Jackson for having the fifth most top-tens. Its follow-up single, a cover of Foreigner's \"I Want to Know What Love Is\", broke airplay records in Brazil. The song spent 27 weeks atop the Brasil Hot 100, making it the longest running number-one song in the chart's history.\nOn December 31, 2009, Carey embarked on her seventh concert tour, Angels Advocate Tour, which visited the United States and Canada and ended on September 26, 2010. A planned remix album of \"Memoirs of an Imperfect Angel\", titled \"Angels Advocate\", was slated for a March 30, 2010, release but was eventually cancelled after Island Def Jam decided to instead distribute \"Up Out My Face\" with Nicki Minaj and \"Angels Cry\" with Ne-Yo as stand-alone releases.\n2010\u20132014: \"Merry Christmas II You\" and \"Me. I Am Mariah... The Elusive Chanteuse\".\nFollowing the cancellation of \"Angels Advocate\", it was announced that Carey would return to the studio to start work on her thirteenth studio album. It was later revealed that it would be her second Christmas album, and follow-up to \"Merry Christmas\". The release date for the album, titled \"Merry Christmas II You\", was November 2, 2010. \"Merry Christmas II You\" debuted at number four on the \"Billboard\" 200 and number one on the R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Albums chart, making it only the second Christmas album to top this chart. In February 2011, she recorded a duet with Tony Bennett for his \"Duets II\" album, titled \"When Do The Bells Ring For Me?\", and re-recorded \"All I Want for Christmas Is You\" with Justin Bieber as a duet for his Christmas album, \"Under the Mistletoe\". In November that year, Carey was included in the remix to the mixtape single \"Warning\" by Uncle Murda; the remix also features 50 Cent and Young Jeezy. Later that month, Carey released a duet with John Legend titled \"When Christmas Comes\", originally part of \"Merry Christmas II You\".\nOn March 1, 2012, Carey performed at New York City's Gotham Hall; her first time performing since her pregnancy. She also performed a three-song set at a special fundraiser for US President Barack Obama held in New York's Plaza Hotel.

Carey told \"The New York Times\", \"I thought it would be a good opportunity to kind of, like, show my personality and who I am, even though I feel like my real fans have an idea of who I am...

The lead single, \"Type Dangerous\", debuted at number 95 on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100, becoming Carey's 50th entry on the chart. Its music video won the MTV Video Music Award for Best R&amp;B Video at the 2025 MTV Video Music Awards, marking her first win; later that night, she also received the Michael Jackson Video Vanguard Award. \nThe second single off the record, titled \"Sugar Sweet\", was released on July 21, 2025, and featured Kehlani and Shenseea. The Anderson .Paak assisted \"Play This Song\" was released as the third single on September 26, 2025.\nArtistry.\nInfluences.\nCarey has said that from childhood she has been influenced by Billie Holiday, Sarah Vaughan as well as R&amp;B and soul musicians including Al Green, Stevie Wonder, Gladys Knight, Aretha Franklin, and George Michael. Her music contains strong influences of gospel music, and she credits the Clark Sisters, Shirley Caesar, and Edwin Hawkins as the most influential in her early years. When Carey incorporated hip hop into her sound, speculation arose that she was making an attempt to take advantage of the genre's popularity, but she told \"Newsweek\", \"People just don't understand. I grew up with this music.\" She has expressed appreciation for rappers such as the Sugarhill Gang, Eric B. &amp; Rakim, the Wu-Tang Clan, The Notorious B.I.G. and Mobb Deep, with whom she collaborated on the single \"The Roof (Back in Time)\" (1998). Carey was heavily influenced by Minnie Riperton, and began experimenting with the whistle register due to her original practice of the range.\nDuring Carey's career, her vocal and musical style, along with her level of success, has been compared to Whitney Houston, whom she has also cited as an influence. Carey and her peers, according to Garry Mulholland, are \"the princesses of wails... virtuoso vocalists who blend chart-oriented pop with mature MOR torch song.\" Author and writer Lucy O'Brien attributed the comeback of Barbra Streisand's \"old-fashioned showgirl\" to Carey and Celine Dion, and described them and Houston as \"groomed, airbrushed and overblown to perfection\". Carey's musical transition and use of more revealing clothing during the late 1990s were, in part, initiated to distance herself from this image, and she subsequently said that most of her early work was \"schmaltzy MOR\". Some have noted that unlike Houston and Dion, Carey writes and produces her own music.\nMusical style.\nCarey gained public perception as a balladeer with her first few releases. Jim Faber of the \"New York Daily News\" stated that \"For Carey, vocalizing is all about the performance, not the emotions that inspired it. Singing, to her, represents a physical challenge, not an emotional unburdening.\" While reviewing \"Music Box\", Stephen Holden from \"Rolling Stone\" commented that Carey sang with \"sustained passion,\" while Arion Berger of \"Entertainment Weekly\" wrote that during some vocal moments, Carey becomes \"too overwhelmed to put her passion into words\". In 2001, \"The Village Voice\" wrote that \"Carey's Strawberry Shortcake soul still provides the template with which teen-pop cuties draw curlicues around those centerless [Diane] Warren ballads.\" Following her divorce with Tommy Mottola, Carey broke free of adult contemporary arrangements in favor of what Alex Macpherson of \"The Guardian\" described as \"a lovingly crafted, hip-hop-inflected quiet storm\". Carey often records her layered background vocals, which have been described as \"a swooning bank of a hundred Mariahs\". The singer has said that \"it's because I started out as a backup singer and doing sessions as a background vocalist learning from some of the greatest background vocalists, and also people like Luther Vandross. Growing up, I admired his texture in and of itself but also his use of background vocals\".\nCarey's output makes use of electronic instruments such as drum machines, keyboards and synthesizers. Many of her songs contain piano-driven melodies, as she was given piano lessons at age six. Carey said that she cannot read sheet music and prefers to collaborate with a pianist when composing her material, but feels that it is easier to experiment with faster and less-conventional melodies and chord progressions using this technique. Carey incorporates several ranges of production and instrumentation into her music, though she has maintained that her voice has always been her most important asset: \"My voice is my instrument; it always has been.\"\nCarey began commissioning remixes of her material early in her career and helped to spearhead the practice of recording entirely new vocals for remixes. Disc jockey David Morales has collaborated with Carey on several occasions, starting with \"Dreamlover\" (1993), which popularized the tradition of remixing R&amp;B songs into house records, and which \"Slant Magazine\" named one of the greatest dance songs. From \"Fantasy\" (1995) onward, Carey enlisted both hip hop and house producers to re-structure her album compositions. \"Entertainment Weekly\" included two remixes of \"Fantasy\" on a list of Carey's greatest recordings compiled in 2005: a National Dance Music Award-winning remix produced by Morales, and a Sean Combs production featuring rapper Ol' Dirty Bastard. The latter has been credited with popularizing the pop and hip hop collaboration trend that has continued into the 21st century. Combs said that Carey \"knows the importance of mixes, so you feel like you're with an artist who appreciates your work\u2014an artist who wants to come up with something with you.\"\nSongwriting.\nLove is the subject of the majority of Carey's lyrics, although she has written about themes such as loss, sex, race, abuse and spirituality. Andrew Chan of the University of Texas Press identifies \"the purging of private emotions\" as the main theme of Carey's ballads, though he believes several others aim to have an \"all-purpose feeling\" with mass appeal. Carey has said that much of her work is partly autobiographical, but \"Time\" magazine's Christopher John Farley wrote: \"If only Mariah Carey's music had the drama of her life. Her songs are often sugary and artificial\u2014NutraSweet soul. But her life has passion and conflict,\" applying it to the first stages of her career. He commented that as her albums progressed, so too her songwriting and music blossomed into more mature and meaningful material.\nCarey's songwriting is noted for its \"eccentric verbosity\". Jeffrey Ingold of \"Vice\" argues that her lyrics are \"among the most verbose in pop music, filling her catalogue with words like \"unyielding\" (\"Breakdown\"), \"emblazoned\" (\"My All\") and \"rhapsodise\" (\"Melt Away\")\". Since the beginning of her career, Carey has repeatedly described herself as a songwriter and \nproducer and emphasized the importance of being acknowledged for these roles. Despite that, she has also admitted having to constantly remind people of her songwriting work, noting that \"A lot of people see that whole other image. They see this diva; they see hair, makeup, body, and clothes\u2026 They don\u2019t think songwriter.\" Upon her induction into the Songwriters Hall of Fame, the institution named her \"the all-time most successful female songwriter in chart history\".\nVoice and timbre.\nCarey possesses a five-octave vocal range. Regarding her type of voice, several critics have described her as a lyric coloratura soprano or just a soprano. Jon Pareles of \"The New York Times\" described Carey's lower register as a \"rich, husky alto\" that extends to \"dog-whistle high notes\". She once described herself as an alto singer. Sasha Frere-Jones of \"The New Yorker\" adds her timbre on \"Vision of Love\" possesses various colors, stating, \"Carey's sound changes with nearly every line, mutating from a steely tone to a vibrating growl and then to a humid, breathy coo.\" Chan believes that Carey moved through several \"vocal personas\" throughout her discography, like the \"stentorian, full-throated belting of her first few albums; the fluid mix of chest and \nhead voice deployed to masterful effect in the mid-1990s; and the delicate, foggy tones and manic cadences that \npredominated after the turn of the millennium\". In an analysis of Carey's voice for ClassicFM, singer Catherine Bott claims that Carey's chest voice could go up \"higher in pitch\" compared to classical singers.\nHer sense of pitch is admired and Jon Pareles adds \"she can linger over sensual turns, growl with playful confidence, syncopate like a scat singer... with startlingly exact pitch.\" Carey claims that she has had nodules on her vocal cords since childhood, enabling her to sing in a higher register than others. However, tiredness and sleep deprivation can affect them due to the nodules, and Carey explained that she went through a lot of practice as a child to maintain a balance during singing. Carey is noted for her vocal improvisation skills.\nTowards the late 1990s, she began incorporating breathy vocals into her material. Tim Levell from BBC News described her vocals as \"sultry close-to-the-mic breathiness,\" while \"USA Today\"'s Elysa Gardner wrote \"it's impossible to deny the impact her vocal style, a florid blend of breathy riffing and resonant belting, has had on today's young pop and R&amp;B stars.\" In an interview, Ron Givens of \"Entertainment Weekly\" described it this way, \"first, a rippling, soulful ooh comes rolling effortlessly from her throat: alto. Then, after a quick breath, she goes for the stratosphere, with a sound that nearly changes the barometric pressure in the room. In one brief swoop, she seems to squeal and roar at the same time.\"\nAlex Macpherson of \"The Guardian\" noted that Carey's voice on \"Butterfly\" is \"an instrument of texture rather than volume, with pillows of lavishly layered vocals and nuanced phrasing magnifying the emotional intensity of the songs.\" Randy Jackson said that \"It's in the tone, that buttery tone that she has with her voice that is unbelievably amazing and unbelievably identifiable.\"\nStage performances and videos.\nDespite being called a \"show stopper\" and \"the 1990s pop phenomenon\", Carey suffered from stage fright in her early years in the music industry. One of her earliest performances was at \"MTV Unplugged\", which received positive reception as Carey silenced critics saying her vocals were studio-made. Chan identifies the Milli Vanilli lip syncing controversy as a potential contributor to the initial accusations. Carey's \"The Star-Spangled Banner\" rendition at the Super Bowl XXXVI was called \"stunning\" by \"Billboard\". She also performed \"America the Beautiful\" at the 1990 NBA Finals in which \"Rolling Stone\" writer, Brittany Spanos, stated the players were struck \"with awe by the incredible talent of a burgeoning young star\". The singer received the only standing ovation of the night at the 48th Annual Grammy Awards, after performing the medley of \"We Belong Together and \"Fly Like a Bird\". Although Carey's performance at \"Dick Clark's New Year's Rockin' Eve 2017\" was marred by technical issues, she returned to the stage a year later and, according to \"Time\", \"effectively redeemed herself\".\nCarey is known for being very static during her live performances. Some reviewers credited her stage fright and lack of confidence as the reasoning, while others pointed out that her performances focus on her vocals and the quality of her songs. Her onstage hand gesticulations have usually been mimicked, as the singer has a tendency for \"using her hands to point, flutter and sweep through the air as she deftly crests each run\". When reviewing Carey's 2014 concert, Michael Lallo wrote that \"If you're Mariah, you ... stroke your hair a lot. When a high note is on the horizon, you brace yourself by touching your ear and adopting a pained expression, provoking the crowd into losing its collective mind.\"\nCarey had been open about the fact that she had not been happy with some of her early music videos, and has subsequently been noted for self-directing and co-producing her subsequent videography. The music video for \"Fantasy\" was the first that Carey directed entirely on her own, and \"Honey\" pushed Carey further towards hip hop and R&amp;B than before. Its music video gained further attention, as Carey, for the first time in her career, was provocatively dressed, giving viewers a \"taste of the freer Mariah.\" In 2007, author Saul Austerlitz wrote Carey had been \"marketed as a whitebread pop princess\" in her earlier music videos, adding the plots, directorial styles, clothes, and auras from later videos like \"Heartbreaker\" were very different and she was displayed as an \"R&amp;B diva\". \"Billboard\" ranked Carey 73rd on its list of \"The 100 Greatest Music Video Artists of All Time\" in 2020, stating that \"over three decades, [Carey] has gone from breezy girl next door, flaunting a denim collection as wide as her vocal range, to secret agent, runaway bride and even her own stalker in a collection of music videos that play like mini-dramas\". The music video for \"The Roof\" was ranked 18th on \"Slant Magazine\"'s \"100 Greatest Music Videos. The music videos for \"Honey\" and \"Heartbreaker\" remain among the most expensive ever made, costing over $2 million. In 2021, Carey was honoured at the African American Film Critics Association with a Special Achievement Innovator Award for her \"visual storytelling in her music videos and specials\".\nCultural status.\nThroughout her career, Carey has been called a pop icon, a gay icon, and a fashion icon. The Recording Academy, the \"Guinness World Records\" and music critics have dubbed Carey the \"Songbird Supreme\". She has been labeled a \"diva\" for her stardom and persona. Her diva persona has received heavy attention, gaining admiration from her fans. Author Lily E. Hirsch argues that while Carey has displayed diva behavior during several incidents in her career, the media's association of the term with her is influenced by gender. Carey's style has often been described as \"eccentric\" and \"over the top\". Throughout her career, she has also been used in several social media memes, gaining the \"Queen of Shade\" title from \"Elle\". Carey's reactions in various interviews have often gone viral, becoming the origin of various memes including \"I don't know her\".\nCarey's public image has undergone significant transformations, often receiving heavy media attention. Early in her career, Carey had a polished image, influenced by Mottola and his control over her career. After their separation, Carey took on a more provocative image in her career and has since been called a sex symbol. Her career has received heavy media attention, particularly during the rollout of her 2001 film, \"Glitter\" which became \"tabloid legend\". Academic Shara Rambarran believes that Carey has matched the media's intense scrutiny and attention on her personal life through \"her diva attitude, performance, identity, and music\".\nCarey's enduring popularity as a musician has received extensive recognition and often praised for its longevity. She has been credited for her role in breaking down racial barriers in popular culture and facilitating public discourse surrounding multiracialism in the music industry. Carey has also been credited for popularizing the use of melisma amongst her peers and the generation after her, and has often been considered one of the greatest vocalists in pop music. Carey has influenced numerous artists and her music has also been recorded, performed or sampled by a variety of acts. In a 2010 article for \"The New York Times\", David Browne wrote that in the early 1990s, \"melisma overtook pop in a way it hadn't before. Mariah Carey's debut hit from 1990, 'Vision of Love', [set] the bar insanely high for notes stretched louder, longer and knottier than most pop fans had ever heard\". He added that because of this, various artists have since \"built their careers around melisma\" including Christina Aguilera, Jennifer Hudson and Beyonc\u00e9.\n\"All I Want for Christmas Is You\", as well as its parent album \"Merry Christmas\", have become such a ubiquitous part of wider popular culture that Carey's name became synonymous with the season, and she has since been dubbed the \"Queen of Christmas\". Multiple media sources have referred to Carey as a holiday icon. The singer has often incorporated holiday-themed outfits during her Christmas shows and music videos.\nAchievements.\nCarey has won six Grammy Awards (including a Grammy Global Impact Award), nineteen World Music Awards, ten American Music Awards, and fourteen \"Billboard\" Music Awards. Carey is one of the best-selling recording artists in history, with more than 220 million records sold. She is also an inductee of the Songwriters Hall of Fame and The Long Island Music and Entertainment Hall of Fame. Carey was honored with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 2015, a \"Billboard\" Icon Award in 2019, and a BET Ultimate Icon Award in 2025. In 2023, she became one of the first 13 recipients of the BRIT Billion Award, for surpassing the milestone one billion streams in the United Kingdom. \"Billboard\" ranked Carey at number 12 on its 2025 \"Top 100 Women Artists of the 21st Century\" list.\nOther activities.\nBusiness ventures.\nDeclining offers to appear in commercials in the United States during her early career, Carey was not involved in brand marketing initiatives until 2006, when she participated in endorsements for Intel Centrino personal computers and launched a jewelry and accessories line for teenagers, Glamorized, in American Claire's and Icing stores. During this period, as part of a partnership with Pepsi and Motorola, Carey recorded and promoted a series of exclusive ringtones, including \"Time of Your Life\". She signed a licensing deal with the cosmetics company Elizabeth Arden, and in 2007, she released her own fragrance, \"M\". The Elizabeth Arden deal has netted her $150\u00a0million. For the fragrance, Carey won a Basenotes Fragrance Award for Best Celebrity Women's Fragrance as well as being nominated in three other categories. She has released a series of fragrances with Elizabeth Arden, including Luscious Pink (2008) and Forever (2009). On November 29, 2010, she debuted a collection on HSN, which included jewelry, shoes and fragrances. In November 2011, Carey was announced as \"brand ambassador\" for Jenny Craig, Inc. which included \"participation in a new company initiative... public service announcements and community and education programs.\" In 2018, Carey featured in an advertisement for Hostelworld with the tagline \"Even Divas are Believers\".\nOn August 25, 2019, Carey signed a $12 million contract with the Walkers crisps brand as part of their Christmas campaign and starred in a commercial for the company. In December 2020, Carey launched a partnership with Virtual Dining Concepts and restaurateur, Robert Earl, for a biscuit line titled \"Mariah's Cookies\". In 2021, Carey announced the launch of a new line of alcohol called \"Black Irish\", an homage to her Black, Venezuelan, and Irish heritage. That same year, Carey also partnered with McDonald's, promoting an entirely new limited time menu. In 2022, Carey recorded nine video lessons for MasterClass titled \"Mariah Carey Teaches the Voice as an Instrument\", for which she re-recorded \"The Roof (Back in Time)\" alongside Brandy.\nPhilanthropy and activism.\nCarey is a philanthropist who has been involved with several charitable organizations. She became associated with the Fresh Air Fund in the early 1990s, and co-founded a camp located in Fishkill, New York, that enables inner-city youth to embrace the arts and introduces them to career opportunities. The camp was called Camp Mariah \"for her generous support and dedication to Fresh Air children,\" and she received a Congressional Horizon Award for her youth-related charity work. Carey has continued her direct involvement with Camp Mariah, and by 2019 the executive director of The Fresh Air Fund reported that \"...the kids who have gone to Camp Mariah have higher graduation rates out of high school and college. In 1999, Carey was presented with a Congressional Award for contributing \"to expanding opportunities for all Americans through their own personal contributions, and [setting] exceptional examples for young people through their own successes in life. In 2019, she was honored by \"Variety\"'s Power of Women for her work with The Fresh Air Fund's Camp Mariah.\nCarey also donated royalties from her songs \"Hero\" and \"One Sweet Day\" to charities. She has worked with the Make-A-Wish Foundation, and in November 2006 she was awarded the Foundation's Wish Idol for her \"extraordinary generosity and her many wish granting achievements.\" Carey has volunteered for the Police Athletic League of New York City and contributed to the obstetrics department of New York Presbyterian Hospital Cornell Medical Center. A percentage of the sales of \"MTV Unplugged\" was donated to various other charities. In 2008, Carey was named Hunger Ambassador of the World Hunger Relief Movement. In February 2010, the song, \"100%\", which was originally written and recorded for the film, \"Precious\", was used as one of the theme songs for the 2010 Winter Olympics, with all money proceeds going to Team USA. In 2017, Carey was awarded with PETA's Angel for Animals Award for promoting animal adoption through her animated movie \"All I Want for Christmas Is You\".\nOne of Carey's most high-profile benefit concert appearances was on VH1's 1998 \"Divas Live\" special, during which she performed alongside other female singers in support of the Save the Music Foundation. The concert was a ratings success, and Carey participated in the \"Divas 2000\" special and a . She appeared at the \"\" nationally televised fundraiser in the aftermath of the September 11 attacks and performed before peacekeeping troops in Kosovo. Carey hosted the CBS television special \"At Home for the Holidays\", which documented real-life stories of adopted children and foster families. In 2005, Carey performed for Live 8 in London and at the Hurricane Katrina relief telethon \"Shelter from the Storm\". In August 2008, Carey and other singers recorded the charity single, \"Just Stand Up!\" produced by Babyface and L.A. Reid, to support Stand Up to Cancer. During the COVID-19 pandemic, Carey participated in the iHeart Living Room Concert for America and \"Rise Up New York!\" telethons to raise money for those affected by COVID-19.\nIn 2008, Carey performed in a New Year's Eve concert for the family of Libyan dictator Muammar Gaddafi. She later said she felt \"horrible and embarrassed\" to have taken part in the concert. To make amends, in March 2011, Carey's representative Cindi Berger stated that royalties for the song \"Save the Day\", written for her fourteenth studio album, would be donated to charities that create awareness for human rights. Berger also said that Carey \"has and continues to donate her time, money and countless hours of personal service to many organizations both here and abroad.\" \"Save the Day\" remained unreleased until 2020. In 2013, human rights activists criticized Carey for performing in a concert for Angola's \"father-daughter kleptocracy\" and accused her of accepting \"dictator cash\".\nPersonal life.\nCarey stated in 2006: \"I do believe that I have been born again in a lot of ways. I think what I've changed are my priorities and my relationships with God. I feel the difference when I don't have my private moments to pray... I'm a fighter, but I learned that I'm not in charge. Whatever God wants to happen is what's going to happen. I feel like I've had endless second, third, fourth, fifth and sixth chances. It's by the grace of God I'm still here.\"\nCarey began dating Tommy Mottola while recording \"Mariah Carey\", and they were married at the Episcopal Saint Thomas Church in New York City on June 5, 1993, in a half-million dollar ceremony. The newlyweds moved into a custom-built mansion, located on a estate in Bedford, New York, referred to by Carey as \"Sing Sing\" (alluding to her feeling imprisoned there). After the release of \"Daydream\" and the success that followed, Carey began focusing on her personal life, which was a constant struggle at the time. Their relationship began to deteriorate due to their growing creative differences in terms of her music, as well as Mottola's controlling nature. They separated in December 1996, and announced it publicly on May 30, 1997. The couple divorced on March 4, 1998. Shortly afterwards they sold their home to Nelson Peltz for $20.5 million; it burned down in 1999.\nCarey was in a relationship with baseball player Derek Jeter from 1997 to 1998, and with singer Luis Miguel from 1998 to 2001. She began dating actor and comedian Nick Cannon while conceiving the music video for her song \"Bye Bye\", which they filmed together on an island off the coast of Antigua in April 2008. They were married on April 30, 2008, in the Bahamas. That same year, Carey suffered a miscarriage. At 35 weeks into her next pregnancy, she gave birth to their fraternal twins, Moroccan and Monroe, on April 30, 2011, via caesarean section. In August 2014, Cannon confirmed he and Carey had separated. He filed for divorce on December 12, 2014, which was finalized in 2016.\nIn 2015, Carey began dating Australian billionaire James Packer and, on January 21, 2016, she announced they were engaged. By October, however, they had called off the engagement. In October 2016, she began dating American choreographer Bryan Tanaka. On December 26, 2023, Tanaka confirmed that he and Carey had parted ways after seven years of dating. In April 2018, Carey opened up about taking therapy sessions and medication for her struggle with bipolar II disorder. She was diagnosed in 2001 and initially kept the diagnosis private.\nDiscography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nStudio albums\nFilmography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nTours and residencies.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Col-begin/styles.css\"/&gt;\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nPrint sources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "19500", "revid": "274535", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19500", "title": "Mervyn Peake", "text": "British author and illustrator (1911\u20131968)\nMervyn Laurence Peake (9 July 1911\u00a0\u2013 17 November 1968) was a British writer, artist, poet, and illustrator. He is best known for what are usually referred to as the \"Gormenghast\" books. The four works were part of what Peake conceived as a lengthy cycle, the completion of which was prevented by his death. They are sometimes compared to the work of his older contemporary J. R. R. Tolkien, but Peake's surreal fiction was influenced by his early love for Charles Dickens and Robert Louis Stevenson rather than Tolkien's studies of mythology and philology.\nPeake also wrote poetry and literary nonsense in verse form, short stories for adults and children (\"Letters from a Lost Uncle\", 1948), stage and radio plays, and \"Mr Pye\" (1953), a relatively tightly structured novel in which God implicitly mocks the evangelical pretensions and cosy world-view of the eponymous hero.\nPeake first made his reputation as a painter and illustrator during the 1930s and 1940s, when he lived in London, and he was commissioned to produce portraits of well-known people. For a short time at the end of World War II he was commissioned by various newspapers to depict war scenes. A collection of his drawings is still in the possession of his family. Although he gained little popular success in his lifetime, his work was highly respected by his peers, and his friends included C. S. Lewis, Dylan Thomas and Graham Greene. His works are now included in the collections of the National Portrait Gallery, the Imperial War Museum and The National Archives.\nIn 2008, \"The Times\" named Peake among their list of \"The 50 greatest British writers since 1945\".\nEarly life.\nMervyn Peake was born of British parents in Kuling located on top of Mount Lu in Jiujiang in 1911, only three months before the revolution and the founding of the Republic of China. His father, Ernest Cromwell Peake, was a medical missionary doctor with the London Missionary Society of the Congregationalist tradition, and his mother, Amanda Elizabeth Powell, had come to China as a missionary assistant. Ernest and Amanda met in July 1903 at Kuling (from the English word \"cooling\"), a summer European missionary resort in Mount Lu about the Yangtze River in Jiujiang. They got married in Hong Kong in December of that same year.\nThe Peakes were given leave to visit England just before World War I in 1914 and returned to China in 1916. Mervyn Peake attended Tientsin Grammar School until the family left for England in December 1922 via the Trans-Siberian Railway. He would later write a novella about this time, titled \"The White Chief of the Umzimbooboo Kaffirs\". Peake never returned to China but it has been noted that Chinese influences can be detected in his works, not least in the castle of Gormenghast itself, which in some respects echoes his birthplace Kuling, as well as the ancient walled city of Beijing and the enclosed compound where he grew up in Tianjin. It is also likely that his early exposure to the contrasts between the lives of the Europeans and of the Chinese, and between the poor and the wealthy in China, also exerted an influence on the Gormenghast books.\nHis education continued at Eltham College, Mottingham (1923\u20131929), where his talents were encouraged by his English teacher, Eric Drake. Peake completed his formal education at Croydon School of Art in the autumn of 1929, and then from December 1929 to 1933 at the Royal Academy Schools, where he first painted in oils. By this time he had written his first long poem, \"A Touch o' the Ash\". In 1931, he had a painting accepted for display by the Royal Academy and exhibited his work with the so-called \"Soho Group\".\nCareer.\nHis early career in the 1930s was as a painter in London, although he lived on the Channel Island of Sark for a time. He first moved to Sark in 1932 where his former teacher Eric Drake was setting up an artists' colony. In 1934, Peake exhibited with the Sark artists both in the Sark Gallery built by Drake and at the Cooling Galleries in London, and in 1935 he exhibited at the Royal Academy and at the Leger Galleries in London.\nIn 1936, he returned to London and was commissioned to design the sets and costumes for \"The Insect Play\", and his work was acclaimed in \"The Sunday Times\". He also began teaching life drawing at Westminster School of Art where he met the painter Maeve Gilmore, whom he married in 1937. They had three children: Sebastian (1940\u20132012), Fabian (born 1942), and Clare (born 1949).\nPeake had a very successful exhibition of paintings at the Calmann Gallery in London in 1938 and his first book, the self-illustrated children's pirate romance \"Captain Slaughterboard Drops Anchor\" (based on a story he had written around 1936), was first published in 1939 by \"Country Life\". In December 1939, he was commissioned by Chatto &amp; Windus to illustrate a children's book, \"Ride a Cock Horse and Other Nursery Rhymes\", published for the Christmas market in 1940.\nEnlistment.\nAt the outbreak of World War II, he applied to become a war artist, for he was keen to put his skills at the service of his country. He imagined \"An Exhibition by the Artist, Adolf Hitler\", in which horrific images of war with ironic titles were offered as \"artworks\" by the Nazi leader. Although the drawings were bought by the British Ministry of Information, Peake's application was turned down and he was conscripted into the Army, where he served first with the Royal Artillery, then with the Royal Engineers. He began writing \"Titus Groan\" at this time.\nIn April 1942, after his requests for commissions as a war artist\u00a0\u2013 or even leave to depict war damage in London\u00a0\u2013 had been consistently refused, he suffered a nervous breakdown and was sent to Southport Hospital. That autumn he was taken on as a graphic artist by the Ministry of Information for a period of six months to work on propaganda illustrations. The next spring he was invalided out of the Army. In 1943 he was commissioned by the War Artists' Advisory Committee, WAAC, to paint glassblowers at the Chance Brothers factory in Smethwick where cathode ray tubes for early radar sets were being produced. Peake was next given a full-time, three-month WAAC contract to depict various factory subjects and was also asked to submit a large painting showing RAF pilots being debriefed. Some of these paintings are on permanent display in Manchester Art Gallery whilst other examples are in the Imperial War Museum collection.\nIllustration and writing.\nThe five years between 1943 and 1948 were some of the most productive of his career. He finished \"Titus Groan\" and \"Gormenghast\" and completed some of his most acclaimed illustrations for books by other authors, including Lewis Carroll's \"The Hunting of the Snark\" (for which he was reportedly paid only \u00a35) and \"Alice in Wonderland\", Samuel Taylor Coleridge's \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner\", the Brothers Grimm's \"Household Tales\", \"All This and Bevin Too\" by Quentin Crisp and Robert Louis Stevenson's \"Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde\", as well as producing many original poems, drawings, and paintings.\nPeake designed the logo for Pan Books. The publishers offered him either a flat fee of \u00a310 or a royalty of one farthing per book. On the advice of Graham Greene, who told him that paperback books were a passing fad that would not last, Peake opted for the \u00a310.\nA book of nonsense poems, \"Rhymes Without Reason\", was published in 1944 and was described by John Betjeman as \"outstanding\". Shortly after the war ended in 1945, Edgar Ainsworth, the art editor of \"Picture Post\", commissioned Peake to visit France and Germany for the magazine. With writer Tom Pocock, Peake was among the first British civilians to witness the horrors of the Nazi concentration camp at Belsen, where the remaining prisoners, too sick to be moved, were dying before his very eyes. He made several drawings, but not surprisingly he found the experience profoundly harrowing, and expressed in deeply felt poems the ambiguity of turning their suffering into art.\nIn 1946, the family moved to Sark, where Peake continued to write and illustrate, and Maeve painted. \"Gormenghast\" was published in 1950, and the family moved back to England, settling in Smarden, Kent. Peake taught part-time at the Central School of Art, began his comic novel \"Mr Pye\", and renewed his interest in theatre. His father died that year and left his house in Hillside Gardens in Wallington, Surrey to Peake. \"Mr Pye\" was published in 1953, and he later adapted it as a radio play. The BBC broadcast other plays of his in 1954 and 1956.\nLater life.\nIn 1956, Mervyn and Maeve visited Spain, financed by a friend who hoped that Peake's health, which was already declining, would be improved by the holiday. That year his novella \"Boy in Darkness\" was published beside stories by William Golding and John Wyndham in a volume called \"Sometime, Never\". On 18 December the BBC broadcast his radio play \"The Eye of the Beholder\" (later revised as \"The Voice of One\"), in which an avant-garde artist is commissioned to paint a church mural. Peake placed much hope in his play \"The Wit to Woo\", which was finally staged in London's West End in 1957, but it was a critical and commercial failure. This affected him greatly\u00a0\u2013 his health degenerated rapidly and he was again admitted to hospital with a nervous breakdown.\nDuring this period he was published primarily in New Worlds by Michael Moorcock, a consistent supporter since the mid-1950s.\nDeclining health.\nHe was showing unmistakable early symptoms of dementia, for which he was given electroconvulsive therapy, to little avail. Over the next few years he gradually lost the ability to draw steadily and quickly, although he still managed to produce some drawings with the help of his wife. Among his last completed works were the illustrations for Balzac's \"Droll Stories\" (1961) and for his own poem \"The Rhyme of the Flying Bomb\" (1962), which he had written some 15 years earlier.\n\"Titus Alone\" was published in 1959 and was revised in 1970 by Langdon Jones, an editor of \"New Worlds\", to remove apparent inconsistencies introduced by the publisher's careless editing. Jones, also a composer, set \"The Rhyme of the Flying Bomb\" to music. A 1995 edition of all three completed Gormenghast novels includes a very short fragment of the beginning of what would have been the fourth Gormenghast novel, \"Titus Awakes\", as well as a listing of events and themes he wanted to address in that and later Gormenghast novels.\nDeath.\nThroughout the 1960s, Peake's health declined into physical and mental incapacitation, and he died on 17 November 1968 at a care home run by his brother-in-law, at Burcot, near Oxford. He was buried in the churchyard of St Mary's in the village of Burpham, West Sussex.\nA 2003 study published in \"JAMA Neurology\" assessed that Peake's death was the result of dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB).\nHis work, especially the \"Gormenghast\" series, became much better known and more widely appreciated after his death. They have since been translated into more than two dozen languages.\nPublications.\nSix volumes of Peake's verse were published during his lifetime; \"Shapes &amp; Sounds\" (1941), \"Rhymes without Reason\" (1944), \"The Glassblowers\" (1950), \"The Rhyme of the Flying Bomb\" (1962), \"Poems &amp; Drawings\" (1965), and \"A Reverie of Bone\" (1967). After his death came \"Selected Poems\" (1972), followed by \"Peake's Progress\" in 1979\u00a0\u2013 though the Penguin edition of 1982, with many corrections, including a whole stanza inadvertently omitted from the hardback edition. \"The Collected Poems of Mervyn Peake\" was published by Carcanet Press in June 2008. Other collections include \"The Drawings of Mervyn Peake\" (1974), \"Writings and Drawings\" (1974), and \"Mervyn Peake: the man and his art\" (2006). A limited edition of the collected works, issued to celebrate Peake's centenary year, was published by Queen Anne Press.\nArchive.\nIn 2010 an archive consisting of 28 containers of material, which included correspondence between Peake and Laurie Lee, Walter de la Mare and C. S. Lewis, plus 39 Gormenghast notebooks and original drawings for both \"Alice Through the Looking Glass\" and \"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland\", was acquired by the British Library. Access to the Archive is available through the British Library website. In July 2020, the British Library acquired from the Peake Estate a visual archive consisting of 300 of Peake's original illustrations for children's stories, \"Gormenghast\", and other works including \"Treasure Island\".\nCommemoration.\nPeake's three children presented on BBC Radio Four in 2018 a half-hour memoir of their father's life, emphasizing the importance of the island of Sark.\nThe first blue plaque on Sark was unveiled in Peake's honour at the Gallery Stores in the Avenue on 30 August 2019.\nDramatic adaptations of Peake's work.\nIn 1983, the Australian Broadcasting Corporation broadcast eight hour-long episodes for radio dramatising the complete Gormenghast Trilogy. This was the first to include the third book \"Titus Alone\".\nIn 1984, BBC Radio 4 broadcast two 90-minute plays based on \"Titus Groan\" and \"Gormenghast\", adapted by Brian Sibley and starring Sting as Steerpike and Freddie Jones as the Artist (narrator). A slightly abridged compilation of the two, running to 160 minutes, and entitled \"Titus Groan of Gormenghast\", was broadcast on Christmas Day, 1992. BBC 7 repeated the original versions on 21 and 28 September 2003.\nIn 1986, \"Mr Pye\" was adapted as a four-part Channel 4 miniseries starring Derek Jacobi.\nIn 2000, the BBC and WGBH Boston co-produced a lavish miniseries, titled \"Gormenghast\", based on the first two books of the series. It starred Jonathan Rhys-Meyers as Steerpike, Neve McIntosh as Fuchsia, June Brown as Nannie Slagg, Ian Richardson as Lord Groan, Christopher Lee as Flay, Richard Griffiths as Swelter, Warren Mitchell as Barquentine, Celia Imrie as Countess Gertrude, Lynsey Baxter and Zo\u00eb Wanamaker as the twins Cora and Clarice, and John Sessions as Dr Prunesquallor. The supporting cast included Olga Sosnovska, Stephen Fry and Eric Sykes, and the series is also notable as the last screen performance by comedy legend Spike Milligan (as the Headmaster).\nA 30-minute TV short film entitled \"A Boy in Darkness\" (also made in 2000 and adapted from Peake's novella) was the first production from the BBC Drama Lab. It was set in a \"virtual\" computer-generated world created by young computer game designers, and starred Jack Ryder (from \"EastEnders\") as Titus, with Terry Jones (\"Monty Python's Flying Circus\") narrating.\nIrmin Schmidt, founder of seminal German Krautrock group Can, wrote an opera called \"Gormenghast\", based on the novels; it was first performed in Wuppertal, Germany, in November 1998. A number of early songs by New Zealand rock group Split Enz were inspired by Peake's work. The song \"The Drowning Man\", by British band The Cure, is inspired by events in \"Gormenghast\", and the song \"Lady Fuchsia\" by another British band, Strawbs, is also based on events in the novels.\nPeake's play \"The Cave\", which dates from the mid-1950s, was given a first public reading at the Blue Elephant Theatre in Camberwell (London) in 2009, and had its world premiere in the same theatre, directed by Aaron Paterson, on 19 October 2010.\nIn 2011, Brian Sibley adapted the story again, this time as six one-hour episodes broadcast on BBC Radio 4 as the Classic Serial starting on 10 July 2011. The serial was titled \"The History of Titus Groan\" and adapted all three novels written by Mervyn Peake and the recently discovered concluding volume, \"Titus Awakes\", completed by his widow, Maeve Gilmore. It starred Luke Treadaway as Titus, David Warner as the Artist and Carl Prekopp as Steerpike. It also starred Paul Rhys, Miranda Richardson, James Fleet, Tamsin Greig, Fenella Woolgar, Adrian Scarborough and Mark Benton among others.\nSting owned the film rights to the \"Gormenghast\" novels for a brief period in the 1980s, during which he discussed the possibility of adapting the novels into a series of concept albums, but he abandoned the idea after declaring the Radio 4 audio drama as ideal. As of 2015, author Neil Gaiman was in talks to adapt the novels for the big screen.\nLegacy.\nAuthors who have cited Peake as influences on their work include: Neil Gaiman, Joanne Harris, Simon Maginn, Christopher Fowler and Susanna Clarke.\nPeake is considered to be one of the Big Three of (secondary world) Fantasy, along with J. R. R. Tolkien and Robert E. Howard. Their equivalents in the science fiction genre are Isaac Asimov, Arthur C. Clarke, and Robert A. Heinlein.\nBibliography.\nGormenghast\n\"Boy in Darkness and other stories\" (2007, the correct text and five other pieces)\nOther works\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

They are practiced for a number of reasons ranging from; violent street fighting, self-defense, military and law enforcement; to non-violent exercising, ceremonial, competition; physical, mental, and spiritual development; entertainment; and to preserve the intangible cultural heritage of a nation. The term \"martial arts\" was originally used to refer to the traditions of East Asia, but has subsequently been applied to other practices which originated outside that region.\nEtymology.\nAccording to John Clements, the term \"martial arts\" itself is derived from an older Latin term meaning the \"arts of Mars\", Mars being the Roman god of war, and was used to refer to the combat systems of Europe as early as the 1550s. \nThe term \"martial arts\" was popularized by mainstream popular culture during the 1960s to 1970s, notably by Hong Kong martial arts films and martial artists such as Bruce Lee, during the so-called \"chopsocky\" wave of the early 1970s.\nThe term martial science, or martial sciences, was commonly used to refer to Asian martial arts up until the 1970s, with the term \"Chinese boxing\" also being used to refer to Chinese martial arts until then.\nSome authors have argued that fighting arts or fighting systems would be a more appropriate term as many martial arts were never \"martial\" in the sense of being used or created by professional warriors.\nVariation and scope.\nMartial arts may be categorized using a variety of criteria, including:\nBy technical focus.\nUnarmed.\nUnarmed martial arts can be broadly grouped into those focusing on strikes, those focusing on grappling, and those that cover both fields, often described as hybrid martial arts.\nStrikes\nGrappling\nArmed.\nThe traditional martial arts that include armed combat often use a wide array of melee weapons such as bladed weapons and polearms. Such traditions include eskrima, silat, Kalaripayattu, kobudo, and historical European martial arts, especially those of the Italian Renaissance. Many Chinese martial arts also feature weapons as part of their curriculum.\nSometimes, the use and handling of a single weapon is considered a martial art, for example Japanese martial arts such as kenjutsu, kendo (sword), bojutsu (staff), and ky\u016bd\u014d (archery). Other similar modern martial arts and sports include modern fencing, stick-fighting systems like canne de combat, modern competitive archery and practical shooting.\nBy application or intent.\nSpirituality-oriented.\nTraditional Korean martial arts place great emphasis on the practitioner's spiritual development. A common theme in most Korean styles, such as Taekkyon, taekwondo, and Hapkido is the focus on \"inner peace\", which is said to be achievable only through meditation and training. Korean martial arts believe that the use of physical force can only be justified in self defense. Japanese martial arts are called \"budo\". The suffix \"-do\" translates to \"way\" or \"path\", as the martial art is meant to lead the practitioner towards a spiritually fulfilling life.\nPahlevani and zourkhaneh rituals is the UNESCO term for the Persian martial art of varzesh-e pahlav\u0101ni (, \"heroic sport\") or varzesh-e b\u0101st\u0101ni (; \"varze\u0161-e b\u0101st\u0101n\u012b\", \"ancient sport\"), a traditional system that was originally used to train warriors in Iran (Persia), first appearing in its current name and form during the Safavid era, it has similarities to other systems in the region and are referred to by different names in those places.\nHistory.\nHistorical martial arts.\nHuman warfare dates back to the Epipalaeolithic and early Neolithic era. The oldest works of art depicting scenes of battle are cave paintings from eastern Spain dated to between 10,000 and 6,000 BCE that show organized groups fighting with bows and arrows. Similar evidence of warfare has also been found in Epipalaeolithic to early Neolithic era mass burials, excavated in Germany and at Jebel Sahaba in Northern Sudan.\nWrestling is the oldest combat sport, with origins in hand-to-hand combat. Depictions of Belt wrestling can be found in Mesopotamian and Ancient Egyptian works of art dating to c.\u20093000 BC, and later in the Sumerian \"Epic of Gilgamesh\". The earliest known depiction of boxing is a Sumerian relief found in Mesopotamia dating to the 3rd millennium BC.\nThe development of modern Chinese and Indian martial arts was likely facilitated by early cultural exchanges between China and India. During the Warring States period (480\u2013221\u00a0BC) in China, extensive development in martial philosophy and strategy took place, as mentioned by Sun Tzu in \"The Art of War\" (c.\u2009350\u00a0BC). Legendary accounts link the origin of Shaolinquan to the spread of Buddhism from ancient India during the early 5th century AD, and the coming of Bodhidharma, to China. Written evidence of martial arts in Southern India dates back to the Sangam literature (2nd century BCE - 2nd century AD). The combat techniques of the Sangam period are the earliest precursors of Kalaripayattu\nIn Europe, the earliest martial arts traditions date to Ancient Greece. Boxing (\"pygme\", \"pyx\"), wrestling (\"pale\") and pankration featured in the Ancient Olympic Games. The Romans produced gladiatorial combat as a public spectacle.\nA number of combat manuals have survived from the European Middle Ages, and include such styles as sword and shield, two-handed swordfighting and other types of melee weapons in addition to unarmed combat. Amongst these are transcriptions of Johannes Liechtenauer's mnemonic poem on the longsword dating back to the late 14th century. Likewise, Asian martial arts became well-documented during the medieval period; Japanese martial arts beginning with the establishment of the samurai nobility in the 12th century, Chinese martial arts during the Ming era with treatises such as Ji Xiao Xin Shu, Indian martial arts in medieval texts such as the Agni Purana and the Malla Purana and Korean martial arts during the Joseon era with texts such as the Muyejebo (1598).\nEuropean swordsmanship always had a sportive component, but the duel was always a possibility until World War I. Modern sport fencing began developing during the 19th century as the French and Italian military academies began codifying rules. The Olympic games led to standard international rules, with the F\u00e9deration Internationale d'Escrime being founded in 1913. Modern boxing originates with the rules of Jack Broughton in the 18th century, and reached its present form under the Rules of the Marquess of Queensberry in 1867.\nFolk styles.\nCertain traditional combat sports and fighting styles exist all over the world, rooted in local culture and folklore. The most common of these are styles of folk wrestling, some of which have been practiced since antiquity and are found in the most remote areas. Other examples include forms of stick fighting and boxing. While these arts are based on historical traditions and folklore, they are not \"historical\" in the sense that they reconstruct or preserve a historical system from a specific era. They are rather contemporary regional sports that coexist with the modern forms of martial arts sports as they have developed since the 19th century, often including cross-fertilization between sports and folk styles; thus, the traditional Thai art of muay boran developed into the modern national sport of muay Thai, which in turn came to be practiced worldwide and contributed significantly to modern hybrid styles like kickboxing and mixed martial arts. The English martial art of Singlestick, can often be seen used in morris dancing. Many European dances have elements derived from martial arts, these include the Ukrainian Hopak, Polish Zb\u00f3jnicki (use of ciupaga), the Czech dance odzemek, and the Norwegian Halling.\nModern history.\nLate 19th to early 20th century.\nThe mid to late 19th century marks the beginning of martial arts as modern sports, developing out of earlier traditional fighting systems. In Europe, this included the development of boxing, wrestling and fencing as sports. In Japan, the same period marks the creation of modern judo, jujutsu, karate, and kendo based on earlier schools of martial arts which existed during the Edo period and which had been suppressed during the Meiji Restoration. In 1882, Kano Jigoro established the Kodokan School of judo, thus starting the sport of judo. Kano Jigoro had studied old forms jujutsu before establishing his judo school.\nModern Muay Thai rules date to the 1920s. In China, the modern history of martial arts begins in the Nanjing decade (1930s) following the foundation of the Central Guoshu Institute in 1928 under the Kuomintang government.\nWestern interest in Asian martial arts arises towards the end of the 19th century, due to the increase in trade between the United States with China and Japan. Relatively few Westerners actually practiced the arts, considering it to be mere performance. Edward William Barton-Wright, a railway engineer who had studied jujutsu while working in Japan between 1894 and 1897, was the first man known to have taught Asian martial arts in Europe. He also founded an eclectic style named Bartitsu which combined jujutsu, judo, wrestling, boxing, savate and stick fighting.\nFencing and Greco-Roman wrestling was included in the 1896 Summer Olympics. FILA Wrestling World Championships and Boxing at the Summer Olympics were introduced in 1904. The tradition of awarding championship belts in wrestling and boxing can be traced to the Lonsdale Belt, introduced in 1909.\n20th century (1914 to 1989).\nThe International Boxing Association was established in 1920 and the World Fencing Championships have been held since 1921. \nAs Western influence grew in Asia a greater number of military personnel spent time in China, Japan and South Korea during World War II and the Korean War and were exposed to local fighting styles. Jujutsu, judo and karate first became popular among the mainstream from the 1950s\u20131960s. Due in part to Asian and Hollywood martial arts movies, most modern American martial arts are either Asian-derived or Asian influenced. The term kickboxing (kikku bokushingu \u30ad\u30c3\u30af\u30dc\u30af\u30b7\u30f3\u30b0) was created by the Japanese boxing promoter Osamu Noguchi for a variant of muay Thai and karate that he created in the 1950s. American kickboxing was developed in the 1970s, as a combination of boxing and karate.Taekwondo was developed in the context of the Korean War in the 1950s.\nThe late 1960s and the 1970s witnessed an increased media interest in Chinese martial arts, influenced by martial artist Bruce Lee. Bruce Lee is credited as one of the first instructors to openly teach Chinese martial arts to Westerners. World Judo Championships have been held since 1956, and Judo was introduced to the Summer Olympics in 1964. Karate World Championships were introduced in 1970.\nThe \"kung fu wave\" of Hong Kong action cinema in the 1970s, especially Bruce Lee films, popularized martial arts in global popular culture. A number of mainstream films produced during the 1980s also contributed significantly to the perception of martial arts in Western popular culture. These include \"The Karate Kid\" (1984) and \"Bloodsport\" (1988). This era produced some Hollywood action stars with martial arts background, such as Jean-Claude Van Damme and Chuck Norris.\nAlso during the 20th century, a number of martial arts were adapted for self-defense purposes and for military hand-to-hand combat. World War II combatives, KAPAP (1930s) and Krav Maga (1950s) in Israel, Systema in Soviet-era Russia, and Sanshou in the People's Republic of China are examples of such systems. The US military de-emphasized hand-to-hand combat training during the Cold War period, but revived it with the introduction of LINE in 1989.\n1990 to present.\nIn 1993, the first Pancrase event was held in Japan. The K-1 rules of kickboxing were introduced, based on 1980s Seidokaikan karate.\nDuring the 1990s, Brazilian jiu-jitsu became popular and proved to be effective in mixed martial arts (MMA) competitions such as the UFC and PRIDE.\nJackie Chan and Bruce Lee were prominent martial artists who became major movie stars during the late 20th and early 21st century. They have played a pivotal role in popularizing and promoting Chinese martial arts in the West.\nThe continual discovery of medieval and Renaissance fighting manuals has led to the practice of Historical European Martial Arts and other Western Martial Arts, which have since gained popularity across the United States and Europe.\nOn 29 November 2011, UNESCO inscribed Taekkyon onto its Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity List.\nRevival.\nMany Indian martial arts were banned by the colonial authorities during the period of British rule, which led to their decline. Some, such as Kalaripayattu, were able to resist this decline by practicing in secret. Other Indian martial art, such as Silambam, while not widely practiced in India, continue to be practiced in other countries in the Indian cultural sphere such as Indonesia and Malaysia. Many other Indian martial arts such as Mardhani Khel and Paika Akhada survived by practitioners practicing the art in secret, or by telling the colonial authorities that it was a form of dance. While many regional Indian martial arts forms are fading into obscurity, martial arts such as Gatka and Kalaripayattu are experiencing a gradual resurgence.\nTesting and competition.\nTesting or evaluation is important to martial artists of many disciplines who wish to determine their progression or own level of skill in specific contexts. Students often undergo periodic testing and grading by their own teacher in order to advance to a higher level of recognized achievement, such as a different belt color or title. The type of testing used varies from system to system but may include forms or sparring.\nVarious forms and sparring are commonly used in martial art exhibitions and tournaments. Some competitions pit practitioners of different disciplines against each other using a common set of rules, these are referred to as mixed martial arts competitions. Rules for sparring vary between art and organization but can generally be divided into \"light-contact\", \"medium-contact\", and \"full-contact\" variants, reflecting the amount of force that should be used on an opponent.\nLight- and medium-contact.\nThese types of sparring restrict the amount of force that may be used to hit an opponent, in the case of light sparring this is usually to 'touch' contact, e.g. a punch should be 'pulled' as soon as or before contact is made. In medium-contact (sometimes referred to as semi-contact) the punch would not be 'pulled' but not hit with full force. As the amount of force used is restricted, the aim of these types of sparring is not to knock out an opponent; a point system is used in competitions.\nA referee acts to monitor for fouls and to control the match, while judges mark down scores, as in boxing. Particular targets may be prohibited, certain techniques may be forbidden (such as headbutting or groin hits), and fighters may be required to wear protective equipment on their head, hands, chest, groin, shins or feet. Some grappling arts, such as aikido, use a similar method of compliant training that is equivalent to light or medium contact.\nIn some styles (such as fencing and some styles of taekwondo sparring), competitors score points based on the landing of a single technique or strike as judged by the referee, whereupon the referee will briefly stop the match, award a point, then restart the match. Alternatively, sparring may continue with the point noted by the judges. Some critics of point sparring feel that this method of training teaches habits that result in lower combat effectiveness. Lighter-contact sparring may be used exclusively, for children or in other situations when heavy contact would be inappropriate (such as beginners), medium-contact sparring is often used as training for full contact.\nFull-contact.\nFull-contact sparring or competition, where strikes or techniques are not pulled but used with full force as the name implies, has a number of tactical differences from light and medium-contact sparring. It is considered by some to be requisite in learning realistic unarmed combat.\nIn full-contact sparring, the aim of a competitive match is to knock out the opponent or to force the opponent to submit.\nWhere scoring takes place it may be a subsidiary measure, only used if no clear winner has been established by other means; in some competitions, such as the UFC 1, there was no scoring, though most now use some form of judging as a backup. Due to these factors, full-contact matches tend to be more aggressive in character, but rule sets may still mandate the use of protective equipment, or limit the techniques allowed.\nNearly all mixed martial arts organizations such as UFC, Pancrase, Shooto use a form of full-contact rules as do professional boxing organizations and K-1. Kyokushin karate requires advanced practitioners to engage in bare-knuckled, full-contact sparring allowing kicks, knees and punching although punching to the head is disallowed while wearing only a karate \"gi\", mouthguard, groin guard for males, or chest guard worn under the karate \"gi\" for females. Brazilian jiu-jitsu and judo matches do not allow striking, but are full-contact in the sense that full force is applied in the permitted grappling and submission techniques. Competitions held by World Taekwondo requires the use of Headgear and padded vest, but are full contact in the sense that full force is applied to strikes to the head and body, and win by knockout is possible.\nWithin Kyokushin Karate, one of the defining aspects is the level of challenge and contact within kumite. The ultimate challenge in Kyokushin Karate is the 100-man kumite challenge, this is where a challenger must complete a total of 100 continuous rounds each with fresh Karateka ready to fight often with minimal or no protective gear. This challenge is considered one of the ultimate tests of endurance, strength, technique and spirit in martial arts with only 30 people to have successfully completed this feat.\nMartial sport.\nMartial arts have crossed over into sports when forms of sparring become competitive, becoming a sport in its own right that is dissociated from the original combative origin, such as with western fencing. The Summer Olympic Games includes judo, taekwondo, western archery, boxing, javelin, wrestling and fencing as events, while Chinese wushu recently failed in its bid to be included, but is still actively performed in tournaments across the world. Practitioners in some arts such as kickboxing and Brazilian jiu-jitsu often train for sport matches, whereas those in other arts such as aikido generally spurn such competitions. Some schools believe that competition breeds better and more efficient practitioners, and gives a sense of good sportsmanship. Others believe that the rules under which competition takes place have diminished the combat effectiveness of martial arts or encourage a kind of practice which focuses on winning trophies rather than a focus such as cultivating a particular moral character.\nThe question of \"which is the best martial art\" has led to inter style competitions fought with very few rules allowing a variety of fighting styles to enter with few limitations. This was the origin of the first Ultimate Fighting Championship tournament (later renamed UFC 1: The Beginning) in the USA inspired by the Brazilian Vale tudo tradition and along with other minimal rule competitions, most notably those from Japan such as Shooto and Pancrase, have evolved into the combat sport of Mixed Martial Arts (MMA).\nSome martial artists compete in non-sparring competitions such as breaking or choreographed routines of techniques such as poomse, kata and aka, or modern variations of the martial arts which include dance-influenced competitions such as tricking. Martial traditions have been influenced by governments to become more sport-like for political purposes; the central impetus for the attempt by the People's Republic of China in transforming Chinese martial arts into the committee-regulated sport of wushu was suppressing what they saw as the potentially subversive aspects of martial training, especially under the traditional system of family lineages.\nHealth and fitness benefits.\nMartial arts training aims to result in several benefits to trainees, such as their physical, mental, emotional and spiritual health.\nThrough systematic practice in the martial arts a person's physical fitness may be boosted (strength, stamina, speed, flexibility, movement coordination, etc.) as the whole body is exercised and the entire muscular system is activated. \nBeyond contributing to physical fitness, martial arts training also has benefits for mental health, contributing to self-esteem, self-control, emotional and spiritual well-being. For this reason, a number of martial arts schools have focused purely on therapeutic aspects, de-emphasizing the historical aspect of self-defense or combat completely.\nBruce Lee viewed martial arts as an art form, emphasizing that it involves not only physical mastery but also emotional and mental expression. Through fluidity, balance, and spontaneous reaction, martial artists communicate emotionally, transcending mere technique and transforming combat into a deeply personal and expressive form of communication.\nSelf-defense, military and law enforcement applications.\nSome traditional martial concepts have seen new use within modern military training. Perhaps the most recent example of this is point shooting which relies on muscle memory to more effectively use a firearm in a variety of awkward situations, much the way an iaidoka would master movements with their sword.\nDuring the World War II era William E. Fairbairn and Eric A. Sykes were recruited by the Special Operations Executive (SOE) to teach their martial art of Defendu (itself drawing on Western boxing and Jujutsu) and pistol shooting to UK, US, and Canadian special forces. The book \"Kill or Get Killed\", written by Colonel Rex Applegate, was based on the Defendu taught by Sykes and Fairbairn. Both Fairbairn's \"Get Tough\" and Appelgate's \"Kill or Get Killed\" became classic works on hand-to-hand combat.\nTraditional hand-to-hand, knife, and spear techniques continue to see use in the composite systems developed for today's wars. Examples of this include European Unifight, the US Army's Combatives system developed by Matt Larsen, the Israeli army's KAPAP and Krav Maga, and the US Marine Corps's \"Marine Corps Martial Arts Program\" (MCMAP). Unarmed dagger defenses identical to those found in the manual of Fiore dei Liberi and the Codex Wallerstein were integrated into the U.S. Army's training manuals in 1942\nand continue to influence today's systems along with other traditional systems such as eskrima and silat.\nThe rifle-mounted bayonet which has its origin in the spear, has seen use by the United States Army, the United States Marine Corps, and the British Army as recently as the Iraq War.\nMany martial arts are also seen and used in Law Enforcement hand-to-hand training. For example, the Tokyo Riot Police's use of aikido.\nMartial arts industry.\nMartial arts since the 1970s has become a significant industry, a subset of the wider sport industry (including cinema and sports television).\nHundreds of millions of people worldwide practice some form of martial art.\nWeb Japan (sponsored by the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs) claims there are 50\u00a0million karate practitioners worldwide.\nThe South Korean government in 2009 published an estimate that taekwondo is practiced by 70\u00a0million people in 190 countries.\nThe wholesale value of martial arts related sporting equipment shipped in the United States was estimated at US$314\u00a0million in 2007; participation in the same year was estimated at 6.9\u00a0million (ages 6 or older, 2% of US population). R. A. Court, CEO of Martial Arts Channel, stated the total revenue of the US martial arts industry at US$40\u00a0billion and the number of US practitioners at 30\u00a0million in 2003.\nEquipment.\nMartial arts equipment can include that which is used for conditioning, protection and weapons. Specialized conditioning equipment can include breaking boards, dummy partners such as the wooden dummy, and targets such as punching bags and the makiwara. Protective equipment for sparring and competition includes boxing gloves, headgear and mouthguards.\nMartial arts fraud.\nAsian martial arts experienced a surge of popularity in the West during the 1970s, and the rising demand resulted in numerous low quality or fraudulent schools. Fueled by fictional depictions in martial arts movies, this led to the ninja craze of the 1980s in the United States. There were also numerous fraudulent ads for martial arts training programs, inserted into comic books circa the 1960s and 1970s, which were read primarily by adolescent boys.\nIn the seventies, lower ranks (kyu) began to be given colorful belts to show progress. This proved to be commercially viable and colored-belt systems were adopted into many martial arts schools and systems, this also led to exploitation within many martial arts degree mills (also known as \"McDojos\" and \"belt factories\") as a means to generate additional cash. This was covered in the \"\" (June 2010).\nFraudulent martial arts practitioners are still common across the world. Martial arts fraudsters will often run their classes with a cult-like mentality. Another red flag around this is that they discourage cross-training in other martial arts styles or make it deliberately difficult to leave. They often teach techniques which are ineffective and dangerous that are likely to give practitioners a false sense of security and even claim that they can perform \"no-touch K.O's\". Instructors of \"McDojo's\" often make outlandish claims about their own success or in many cases self-promote themselves to the rank of 10th Dan Black Belt or even claim to have invented their own style of martial art which claims to be more effective or deadlier than \"other styles\".\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Typically, the relation describes a possible connection between the elements of an \"n\"-tuple. For example, the relation \"\"x\" is divisible by \"y\" and \"z\"\" consists of the set of 3-tuples such that when substituted to \"x\", \"y\" and \"z\", respectively, make the sentence true.\nThe non-negative integer \"n\" that gives the number of \"places\" in the relation is called the \"arity\", \"adicity\" or \"degree\" of the relation. A relation with \"n\" \"places\" is variously called an n\"-ary relation, an n\"-adic relation or a relation of degree \"n\". Relations with a finite number of places are called \"finitary relations\" (or simply \"relations\" if the context is clear). It is also possible to generalize the concept to \"infinitary relations\" with infinite sequences.\nDefinitions.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;When two objects, qualities, classes, or attributes, viewed together by the mind, are seen under some connexion, that connexion is called a relation.\u2014\u200a\nSince the definition is predicated on the underlying sets \"X\"1, ..., \"X\"\"n\", \"R\" may be more formally defined as the (\"n\" + 1)-tuple (\"X\"1, ..., \"X\"\"n\", \"G\"), where \"G\", called the \"graph\" of \"R\", is a subset of the Cartesian product \"X\"1 \u00d7 ... \u00d7 \"X\"\"n\".\nAs is often done in mathematics, the same symbol is used to refer to the mathematical object and an underlying set, so the statement (\"x\"1, ..., \"x\"\"n\") \u2208 \"R\" is often used to mean (\"x\"1, ..., \"x\"\"n\") \u2208 \"G\" is read \"\"x\"1, ..., \"x\"\"n\" are \"R\"-related\" and are denoted using prefix notation by \"Rx\"1\u22ef\"x\"\"n\" and using postfix notation by \"x\"1\u22ef\"x\"\"n\"\"R\". In the case where \"R\" is a binary relation, those statements are also denoted using infix notation by \"x\"1\"Rx\"2.\nThe following considerations apply:\nLet a Boolean domain \"B\" be a two-element set, say, \"B\" = {0, 1}, whose elements can be interpreted as logical values, typically 0 = false and 1 = true. The characteristic function of \"R\", denoted by \"\u03c7\"\"R\", is the Boolean-valued function \"\u03c7\"\"R\": \"X\"1 \u00d7 ... \u00d7 \"X\"\"n\" \u2192 \"B\", defined by \"\u03c7\"\"R\"((\"x\"1, ..., \"x\"\"n\")) = 1 if \"Rx\"1\u22ef\"x\"\"n\" and \"\u03c7\"\"R\"((\"x\"1, ..., \"x\"\"n\")) = 0 otherwise.\nIn applied mathematics, computer science and statistics, it is common to refer to a Boolean-valued function as an \"n\"-ary \"predicate\". From the more abstract viewpoint of formal logic and model theory, the relation \"R\" constitutes a \"logical model\" or a \"relational structure\", that serves as one of many possible interpretations of some \"n\"-ary predicate symbol.\nBecause relations arise in many scientific disciplines, as well as in many branches of mathematics and logic, there is considerable variation in terminology. Aside from the set-theoretic extension of a relational concept or term, the term \"relation\" can also be used to refer to the corresponding logical entity, either the logical comprehension, which is the totality of intensions or abstract properties shared by all elements in the relation, or else the symbols denoting these elements and intensions. Further, some writers of the latter persuasion introduce terms with more concrete connotations (such as \"relational structure\" for the set-theoretic extension of a given relational concept).\nSpecific values of \"n\".\nNullary.\nNullary (0-ary) relations count only two members: the empty nullary relation, which never holds, and the universal nullary relation, which always holds. This is because there is only one 0-tuple, the empty tuple (), and there are exactly two subsets of the (singleton) set of all 0-tuples. They are sometimes useful for constructing the base case of an induction argument.\nUnary.\nUnary (1-ary) relations can be viewed as a collection of members (such as the collection of Nobel laureates) having some property (such as that of having been awarded the Nobel Prize).\nEvery nullary function is a unary relation.\nBinary.\nBinary (2-ary) relations are the most commonly studied form of finitary relations. Homogeneous binary relations (where \"X\"1 = \"X\"2) include\nHeterogeneous binary relations include\nTernary.\nTernary (3-ary) relations include, for example, the binary functions, which relate two inputs and the output. All three of the domains of a homogeneous ternary relation are the same set.\nExample.\nConsider the ternary relation \"R\" \"\"x\" thinks that \"y\" likes \"z\"\" over the set of people \"P\" = {Alice, Bob, Charles, Denise}, defined by:\n \"R\" = {(Alice, Bob, Denise), (Charles, Alice, Bob), (Charles, Charles, Alice), (Denise, Denise, Denise)}.\n\"R\" can be represented equivalently by the following table:\nHere, each row represents a triple of \"R\", that is it makes a statement of the form \"\"x\" thinks that \"y\" likes \"z\"\". For instance, the first row states that \"Alice thinks that Bob likes Denise\". All rows are distinct. The ordering of rows is insignificant but the ordering of columns is significant.\nThe above table is also a simple example of a relational database, a field with theory rooted in relational algebra and applications in data management. Computer scientists, logicians, and mathematicians, however, tend to have different conceptions what a general relation is, and what it is consisted of. For example, databases are designed to deal with empirical data, which is by definition finite, whereas in mathematics, relations with infinite arity (i.e., infinitary relation) are also considered.\nHistory.\nThe logician Augustus De Morgan, in work published around 1860, was the first to articulate the notion of relation in anything like its present sense. He also stated the first formal results in the theory of relations (on De Morgan and relations, see Merrill 1990).\nCharles Peirce, Gottlob Frege, Georg Cantor, Richard Dedekind and others advanced the theory of relations. Many of their ideas, especially on relations called orders, were summarized in \"The Principles of Mathematics\" (1903) where Bertrand Russell made free use of these results.\nIn 1970, Edgar Codd proposed a relational model for databases, thus anticipating the development of data base management systems.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "19510", "revid": "7611264", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19510", "title": "Mokele-mbembe", "text": "Water-dwelling entity that supposedly lives in the Congo River Basin\nIn several Bantu mythologies, mokele-mbembe (also written as \"mok\u00e8l\u00e9-mb\u00e8mb\u00e9\") is a mythical water-dwelling entity that is believed to exist in the Congo River Basin. It is variously described as a reptilian creature, a spirit, or a member of the extinct lineage of sauropods.\nIn the early to mid-20th century, the entity became a point of focus among adherents of cryptozoology and young Earth creationism, resulting in numerous expeditions led by cryptozoologists and often funded by young Earth creationists and other groups with the objective to find evidence that invalidates or contradicts the scientific consensus regarding evolution. Paleontologist Donald Prothero remarks that \"the quest for Mokele-Mbembe ... is part of the effort by creationists to overthrow the theory of evolution and teaching of science by any means possible\". Additionally, Prothero noted that \"the only people looking for mokele-mbembe are creationist ministers, not wildlife biologists.\"\nHowever, in the 1940s, Roy Mackal, a microbiologist from the University of Chicago, conducted multiple expeditions to locate the animal and eyewitness testimony described it:\n\"The head was distinctly snake-like, a long thin tail, and a body approximating the size of an elephant, or at least that of a hippopotamus. The legs are short, with the hind legs possessing three claws. The animals are a reddish brown in color, and have a rooster-like frill running from the top of the head down the back of the neck.\" However, no expeditions have found evidence of the animal other than eyewitness testimonies.\nMost mainstream experts believe that mokele-mbembe, as reported by Congolese natives, was probably inspired by the black rhinoceros, which once thrived in the region. Historian Edward Guimont has argued that the mokele-mbembe myth grows out of earlier pseudohistorical claims about Great Zimbabwe, and in turn influenced the later reptilian conspiracy theory.\nHistory.\n20th century.\nSource:\nThe first report of the mokele-mbembe comes from German Captain Ludwig Freiherr von Stein zu Lausnitz, as described by Willy Ley in the book \"The Lungfish and the Unicorn\" (1941). Von Stein was ordered to conduct a survey of German colonies in what is now Cameroon in 1913. He heard stories of an enormous reptile called \"Mokele-mbembe\" alleged to live in the jungles, and included a description in his official report. According to Ley, \"von Stein worded his report with utmost caution,\" knowing it might be seen as unbelievable. Nonetheless, von Stein thought the tales were credible: trusted native guides had related the tales to him, and the stories were related to him by independent sources, yet featured many of the same details. Though von Stein's report was never formally published, Ley quoted von Stein as writing:\nThe animal is said to be of a brownish-gray color with a smooth skin, its size is approximately that of an elephant; at least that of a hippopotamus. It is said to have a long and very flexible neck and only one tooth but a very long one; \"some say it is a horn\". A few spoke about a long, muscular tail like that of an alligator. Canoes coming near it are said to be doomed; the animal is said to attack the vessels at once and to kill the crews but without eating the bodies. The creature is said to live in the caves that have been washed out by the river in the clay of its shores at sharp bends. It is said to climb the shores even at daytime in search of food; its diet is said to be entirely vegetable. This feature disagrees with a possible explanation as a myth. The preferred plant was shown to me, it is a kind of liana with large white blossoms, with a milky sap and apple-like fruits. At the Ssombo River I was shown a path said to have been made by this animal in order to get at its food. The path was fresh and there were plants of the described type nearby. But since there were too many tracks of elephants, hippos, and other large mammals it was impossible to make out a particular spoor with any amount of certainty.\nHowever, according to Brian Dunning, in a 1929 German book by science author Wilhelm B\u00f6lsche called \"Dragons: Legend and Science\", B\u00f6lsche wrote that von Stein clearly believed that the creature described was not an actual animal, but instead was nothing more than local folklore. \nAccording to German adventurer Lt. Paul Gratz's account from 1911:The crocodile is found only in very isolated specimens in Lake Bangweulu, except in the mouths of the large rivers at the north. In the swamp lives the \"nsanga\", much feared by the natives, a degenerate saurian which one might well confuse with the crocodile were it not that its skin has no scales and its toes are armed with claws. I did not succeed in shooting a \"nsanga\", but on the island of Mbawala I came by some strips of its skin.\nTales of entities like mokele-mbembe, living saurians or large scientifically unidentified creatures walking around the African rain forest, are not rare; there have been multiple tales of large, smooth-skinned quadrupeds with long necks that fed on large prey still living in central Africa. It was only after the description of the mokele-mbembe surfaced that the rest of the world started interpreting those legends as possessing a dinosaur-like body structure. A notable example would be the emela-ntouka, an elephant-sized creature that shares a lot of similarities with the mokele-mbembe. It is described as having smooth skin, a strong and muscular tail, and a \"horn\" or \"tooth\". Another similar creature, the \"jago-nini\", was described by Alfred Aloysius Smith, who had worked for a British trading company in what is now Gabon in the late 19th century, who briefly mentions it in his 1927 memoir.\nReports of entities described to be dinosaur-like in Africa caused a minor sensation in the mass media, and newspapers in Europe and North America carried many articles on the subject in the early 1910s; some took the reports at face value, while others were more skeptical. It is notable that Western Europe and the Americas were going through a pop cultural interest in dinosaurs, of which the Brontosaurus was one of the most popular. This cultural trend could have contributed to both the reports as well as the tendency for newspapers to claim the reported beast was a sauropod.\nSeveral expeditions, of varying scientific credibility, were undertaken in the 20th century to search for mokele-mbembe or interview claimed eyewitnesses. In 1980 and again in 1981, explorer Henry Powell and biologist Roy Mackal visited the Congo region and interviewed native residents. They did not find any direct physical evidence, but nonetheless argued consistent statements from claimed eyewitnesses tended to support the creature's existence. Mackal published a book in 1987 detailing his expeditions. Mackal admitted his investigation was \"tinged with some romanticism\", but also insisted he had serious scientific intent. Prothero argues the Powell-Mackall expedition almost single-handedly popularized the modern concept of mokele-mbembe to Westerners, yet was seriously flawed. Mackal's training was in virology, which arguably did not qualify him to search for a large, exotic creature; and Mackal seemed to uncritically accept eyewitness statements without considering the possibility people might lie or exaggerate for financial gain, for attention, or to impress an American visitor. Furthermore, Mackal was dismissive of Africans who \"denied knowledge of mokele-mbeme\" or who asserted the creature did not exist. In 1981, explorer Herman Regusters and his expedition team traveled to Lake Tele, where Regusters claimed he took a photograph of the dinosaur as well as recorded its sound. Roy Mackal was skeptical of Regusters and his team.\nZoologist Marcellin Agnagna said he took a film of mokele-mbeme in 1983 but the footage did not develop properly. Prothero describes the story as \"suspicious\", noting critical details of Agnagna's account have changed and none of it was supported by other witnesses. Scottish explorer William \"Billy\" Gibbons led two expeditions in 1985 and 1992, though Prothero question his motives as a creationist and describes Gibbons as not following even basic scientific principles. Journalist Rory Nugent's book \"Drums Along The Congo: On The Trail Of Mokele-Mbembe, the Last Living Dinosaur\" was published in 1993 by Houghton Mifflin. Nugent's book included a photograph he claimed was possibly mokele-mbembe, but which Prothero argues was more likely a floating log.\n21st century.\nIn 2001, BBC's \"Congo\", a television documentary series on the natural history of the region, included an interview with the Biaka people who identified the mokele-mbembe as a rhinoceros while looking at an illustrated manual of wildlife. However, neither species of African rhinoceros is common in the Congo Basin, so the mokele-mbembe may be a mixture of mythology and folk memory from a time when rhinoceroses were found in the area.\nIn 2016, a travel documentary crew from South Africa made a documentary about searching for mokele-mbembe, which they later sold to Discovery Africa. The team spent roughly four weeks in the Likuoala swamp region visiting various Aka (pygmy) villages, collecting stories of the creature's existence. They pointed out the difficulty of differentiating between a mokele-mbembe's metaphysical and physical existence. While they interviewed people who believed in its presence, others stated it died at least a decade ago.\nIn 2018, Lensgreve of Knuthenborg, Adam Christoffer Knuth, along with a film crew from Danish Radio and a DNA scientist, traveled to Lake Tele in Congo, in search of the mokele-mbembe. They did not find the cryptid; however, they found a new species of green algae.\nTheories.\nThe lack of physical evidence and the conflicting witnesses have made the existence of the entity doubted by the large majority of scientists and historians. The most reasonable and agreed upon explanation is that the mokele-mbembe is a legend based on the black rhinoceros, a species once common to central Africa, where the stories of the mokele-mbembe originated. According to skeptic Ben Radford, the origin of the creature can be traced back to a 1909 book by zoologist Carl Hagenbeck called \"Beasts and Men\". Based on recently discovered dinosaur bones, Hagenbeck speculated that sauropods may still live in Africa. Although he offered no evidence other than legends, the claims were circulated by the press, including \"The Washington Post\". Daniel Loxton and Donald Prothero claimed it \"launched what would become the modern cryptozoological legend of mokele-mbembe\". They concluded that the reports of the monster were not result of hard evidence or genuine first-hand accounts of native encounters with the creature, but rather a \"distillation of many creatively varied stories from widely separated regions. The absence of evidence supporting the creature's existence, despite several centuries of Western contact with the region, numerous expeditions in search of the animal, and periodic aerial and satellite surveillance, all of which have detected elephants and other large animals - but no sauropods - all serve to argue against the existence of mokele-mbembe.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "19513", "revid": "35936988", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19513", "title": "Intuitionism", "text": "Approach in philosophy of mathematics and logic\nIn the philosophy of mathematics, intuitionism, or neointuitionism (opposed to preintuitionism), is an approach where mathematics is considered to be purely the result of the constructive mental activity of humans rather than the discovery of fundamental principles claimed to exist in an objective reality. That is, logic and mathematics are not considered analytic activities wherein deep properties of objective reality are revealed and applied, but are instead considered the application of internally consistent methods used to realize more complex mental constructs, regardless of their possible independent existence in an objective reality.\nTruth and proof.\nThe fundamental distinguishing characteristic of intuitionism is its interpretation of what it means for a mathematical statement to be true. In Brouwer's original intuitionism, the truth of a mathematical statement is a subjective claim: a mathematical statement corresponds to a mental construction, and a mathematician can assert the truth of a statement only by verifying the validity of that construction by intuition. The vagueness of the intuitionistic notion of truth often leads to misinterpretations about its meaning. Kleene formally defined intuitionistic truth from a realist position, yet Brouwer would likely reject this formalization as meaningless, given his rejection of the realist/Platonist position. Intuitionistic truth therefore remains somewhat ill-defined. However, because the intuitionistic notion of truth is more restrictive than that of classical mathematics, the intuitionist must reject some assumptions of classical logic to ensure that everything they prove is in fact intuitionistically true. This gives rise to intuitionistic logic.\nTo an intuitionist, the claim that an object with certain properties exists is a claim that an object with those properties can be constructed. Any mathematical object is considered to be a product of a construction of a mind, and therefore, the existence of an object is equivalent to the possibility of its construction. This contrasts with the classical approach, which states that the existence of an entity can be proved by refuting its nonexistence. For the intuitionist, this is not valid; the refutation of the nonexistence does not mean that it is possible to find a construction for the putative object, as is required in order to assert its existence. As such, intuitionism is a variety of mathematical constructivism; but it is not the only kind.\nThe interpretation of negation is different in intuitionist logic than in classical logic. In classical logic, the negation of a statement asserts that the statement is \"false\"; to an intuitionist, it means the statement is \"refutable\". There is thus an asymmetry between a positive and negative statement in intuitionism. If a statement \"P\" is provable, then \"P\" certainly cannot be refutable. But even if it can be shown that \"P\" cannot be refuted, this does not constitute a proof of \"P\". Thus \"P\" is a stronger statement than \"not-not-P\".\nSimilarly, to assert that \"A\" or \"B\" holds, to an intuitionist, is to claim that either \"A\" or \"B\" can be \"proved\". In particular, the law of excluded middle, \"\"A\" or not \"A\", is not accepted as a valid principle. For example, if \"A\" is some mathematical statement that an intuitionist has not yet proved or disproved, then that intuitionist will not assert the truth of \"A\" or not \"A\". However, the intuitionist will accept that \"A\" and not \"A\"\" cannot be true. Thus the connectives \"and\" and \"or\" of intuitionistic logic do not satisfy de Morgan's laws as they do in classical logic.\nIntuitionistic logic substitutes constructability for abstract truth and is associated with a transition from the proof of model theory to abstract truth in modern mathematics. The logical calculus preserves justification, rather than truth, across transformations yielding derived propositions. It has been taken as giving philosophical support to several schools of philosophy, most notably the Anti-realism of Michael Dummett. Thus, contrary to the first impression its name might convey, and as realized in specific approaches and disciplines (e.g. Fuzzy Sets and Systems), intuitionist mathematics is more rigorous than conventionally founded mathematics, where, ironically, the foundational elements which intuitionism attempts to construct/refute/refound are taken as intuitively given.\nInfinity.\nAmong the different formulations of intuitionism, there are several different positions on the meaning and reality of infinity.\nThe term potential infinity refers to a mathematical procedure in which there is an unending series of steps. After each step has been completed, there is always another step to be performed. For example, consider the process of counting: formula_1\nThe term actual infinity refers to a completed mathematical object which contains an infinite number of elements. An example is the set of natural numbers, formula_2.\nIn Cantor's formulation of set theory, there are many different infinite sets, some of which are larger than others. For example, the set of all real numbers formula_3 is larger than formula_4, because any attempt to put the natural numbers into one-to-one correspondence with the real numbers will always fail: there will always be an infinite number of real numbers \"left over\". Any infinite set that can be placed in one-to-one correspondence with the natural numbers is said to be \"countable\" or \"denumerable\". Infinite sets larger than this are said to be \"uncountable\".\nCantor's set theory led to the axiomatic system of Zermelo\u2013Fraenkel set theory (ZFC), now the most common foundation of modern mathematics. Intuitionism was created, in part, as a reaction to Cantor's set theory.\nModern constructive set theory includes the axiom of infinity from ZFC (or a revised version of this axiom) and the set formula_4 of natural numbers. Most modern constructive mathematicians accept the reality of countably infinite sets (however, see Alexander Esenin-Volpin for a counter-example).\nBrouwer rejected the concept of actual infinity, but admitted the idea of potential infinity.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;According to Weyl 1946, 'Brouwer made it clear, as I think beyond any doubt, that there is no evidence supporting the belief in the existential character of the totality of all natural numbers ... the sequence of numbers which grows beyond any stage already reached by passing to the next number, is a manifold of possibilities open towards infinity; it remains forever in the status of creation, but is not a closed realm of things existing in themselves. That we blindly converted one into the other is the true source of our difficulties, including the antinomies \u2013 a source of more fundamental nature than Russell's vicious circle principle indicated. Brouwer opened our eyes and made us see how far classical mathematics, nourished by a belief in the 'absolute' that transcends all human possibilities of realization, goes beyond such statements as can claim real meaning and truth founded on evidence.\u2014\u200a\nHistory.\nIntuitionism's history can be traced to two controversies in nineteenth century mathematics.\nThe first of these was the invention of transfinite arithmetic by Georg Cantor and its subsequent rejection by a number of prominent mathematicians including most famously his teacher Leopold Kronecker\u2014a confirmed finitist.\nThe second of these was Gottlob Frege's effort to reduce all of mathematics to a logical formulation via set theory and its derailing by a youthful Bertrand Russell, the discoverer of Russell's paradox. Frege had planned a three-volume definitive work, but just as the second volume was going to press, Russell sent Frege a letter outlining his paradox, which demonstrated that one of Frege's rules of self-reference was self-contradictory. In an appendix to the second volume, Frege acknowledged that one of the axioms of his system did in fact lead to Russell's paradox.\nFrege, the story goes, plunged into depression and did not publish the third volume of his work as he had planned. For more see Davis (2000) Chapters 3 and 4: Frege: \"From Breakthrough to Despair\" and Cantor: \"Detour through Infinity.\" See van Heijenoort for the original works and van Heijenoort's commentary.\nThese controversies are strongly linked as the logical methods used by Cantor in proving his results in transfinite arithmetic are essentially the same as those used by Russell in constructing his paradox. Hence how one chooses to resolve Russell's paradox has direct implications on the status accorded to Cantor's transfinite arithmetic.\nIn the early twentieth century L. E. J. Brouwer represented the \"intuitionist\" position and David Hilbert the formalist position\u2014see van Heijenoort. Kurt G\u00f6del offered opinions referred to as \"Platonist\" (see various sources re G\u00f6del). Alan Turing considers:\n\"non-constructive systems of logic with which not all the steps in a proof are mechanical, some being intuitive\". Later, Stephen Cole Kleene brought forth a more rational consideration of intuitionism in his \"Introduction to metamathematics\" (1952).\nNicolas Gisin is adopting intuitionist mathematics to reinterpret quantum indeterminacy, information theory and the physics of time.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nIn \"Chapter 39 Foundations\", with respect to the 20th century Anglin gives very precise, short descriptions of Platonism (with respect to Godel), Formalism (with respect to Hilbert), and Intuitionism (with respect to Brouwer).\nLess readable than Goldstein but, in \"Chapter III Excursis\", Dawson gives an excellent \"A Capsule History of the Development of Logic to 1928\".\nIn \"Chapter II Hilbert and the Formalists\" Goldstein gives further historical context. As a Platonist G\u00f6del was reticent in the presence of the logical positivism of the Vienna Circle. Goldstein discusses Wittgenstein's impact and the impact of the formalists.

Having been collected in the 3rd century CE, it is the first work of rabbinic literature, written primarily in Mishnaic Hebrew but also partly in Jewish Aramaic. The oldest surviving physical fragments of it are from the 6th to 7th centuries. It is viewed as authoritative and binding revelation by most Orthodox Jews and some non-Orthodox Jews. \nThe Mishnah was redacted by Judah ha-Nasi probably in Beit Shearim or Sepphoris, in the late second or early third century CE. in a time when the persecution of Jews and the passage of time raised the possibility that the details of the oral traditions of the Pharisees from the Second Temple period (516\u00a0BCE\u00a0\u2013 70\u00a0CE) would be forgotten.\nAfter the Mishnah was compiled, it became the subject of centuries of rabbinic commentary, primarily taking place in the Talmudic academies in Syria Palaestina (Palestine / Land of Israel) and in Babylonia (Lower Mesopotamia). Both of these centers compiled their own collection of rabbinic commentaries on the Mishnah, leading to the creation of the Jerusalem Talmud and the now more well known Babylonian Talmud (\"Calmed\" alone refers to the latter).\nEtymology.\n\"Mishnah\" comes from the verb \"shanah\", which means \"to repeat\", \"to study\", \"to heed oral instruction\", or \"to teach\".\nStructure.\nThe Mishnah is arranged by subject matter, and is divided into six \"orders\" (', singular ' ), each containing 7\u201312 tractates (', singular ' ; lit. \"web\"), 63 in total. Except for Zeraim, the orders are arranged from longest (in number of chapters) to shortest. According to tradition, the Mishnah was divided into six thematic sections by its author, Judah Ha-Nasi. \nEach ' is divided into chapters (', singular ') and then paragraphs (', singular \"\"). In this last context, the word \"mishnah\" means a single paragraph of the work, i.e. the smallest unit of structure, leading to the use of the plural, \"Mishnayot\", for the whole work.\nAccording to the Babylonian Talmud, Hagigah 14a:9, there were originally six to seven hundred orders of the Mishnah, with only six surviving to the present.\nThe six orders.\nThe Mishnah may also be called the Shas (an acronym for \"Shisha Sedarim\" \u2013 the \"six orders\"), a term that more often denotes the entire Talmud.\nThe six orders are:\nA popular mnemonic for these orders is the acronym \"Z'MaN NaKaT\".\nContent and purpose.\nThe Mishnah teaches the oral traditions by example, presenting actual cases being brought to judgment, usually along with (i) the \"debate\" on the matter, and (ii) the judgment that was given by a notable rabbi based on halakha, mitzvot, and spirit of the teaching (\"Torah\") that guided his decision.\nIn this way, the Mishnah brings to everyday reality the practice of the 613 Commandments presented in the Torah and aims to cover all aspects of human living, serve as an example for future judgments, and, most important, demonstrate pragmatic exercise of the Biblical laws, which was much needed since the destruction of the Second Temple in 70\u00a0CE. The Mishnah is thus a collection of existing traditions rather than new law.\nThe term \"Mishnah\" is related to the verb \"to teach, repeat\", and to adjectives meaning \"second\". It is thus named for being both the one written authority (codex) secondary (only) to the Tanakh as a basis for the passing of judgment, a source and a tool for creating laws, and the first of many books to complement the Tanakh in certain aspects.\nOral law.\nBefore the publication of the Mishnah, Jewish scholarship and judgement were predominantly oral, as according to the Talmud, it was not permitted to write them down. The earliest recorded oral law may have been of the midrashic form, in which halakhic discussion is structured as exegetical commentary on the Torah, with the oldest surviving written material dating to the 6th to 7th centuries CE. Rabbis expounded on and debated the Tanakh without the benefit of written works (other than the Biblical books themselves). However, some may have made private notes () for example of court decisions. The oral traditions were far from monolithic and varied among various schools, the most famous of which were the Houses of Hillel and Shammai.\nAfter the First Jewish\u2013Roman War in 70\u00a0CE, with the end of the Second Temple center in Jerusalem, Jewish social and legal norms were in upheaval. The rabbis faced the new reality of Judaism without a Temple to serve as the center of teaching and study and a Judea without autonomy. During this period, Rabbinic discourse began to be recorded in writing. The possibility was felt that the details of the oral traditions of the Pharisees from the Second Temple period (530s BCE / 3230s AM \u2013 70\u00a0CE/ 3830 AM) would be forgotten, so the justification was found to have these oral laws transcribed.\nOver time, different traditions of the Oral Law came into being, raising problems of interpretation. According to the \"Mevo Hatalmud\", many rulings were given in a specific context but would be taken out of it, or a verdict was revisited, but the second ruling would not become popularly known. To correct this, Judah the Prince took up the redaction of the Mishnah. If a point was of no conflict, he kept its language; where there was conflict, he reordered the opinions and ruled and clarified where context was not given. The idea was not to use his discretion but to examine the tradition as far back as he could and only supplement as required.\nThe Mishnah and the Hebrew Bible.\nAccording to Rabbinic Judaism, the Oral Torah () was given to Moses at Sinai or Mount Horeb as an exposition to the Torah. The accumulated traditions of the Oral Law, expounded by scholars in each generation from Moses onward, are considered the necessary basis for the interpretation, and often for the reading, of the Written Law. Jews sometimes refer to this as the \"Masora\" (), roughly translated as \"tradition\". However, that word is often used in a narrower sense to mean traditions concerning the editing and reading of the Biblical text (see Masoretic Text). The resulting Jewish law and custom is called halakha.\nWhile most discussions in the Mishnah concern the correct way to carry out laws recorded in the Torah, it usually presents its conclusions without explicitly linking them to any scriptural passage, though scriptural quotations do occur. For this reason it is arranged in order of topics rather than in the form of a Biblical commentary. (In a very few cases, there is no scriptural source at all and the law is described as \"Halakha leMoshe miSinai\", \"law to Moses from Sinai\".) The \"Midrash halakha\" presents similar laws in the form of a Biblical commentary and explicitly links its conclusions to details in the Biblical text. These Midrashim often predate the Mishnah.\nThe Mishnah also quotes the Torah for principles not associated with law but just as practical advice, even at times for humor or as guidance for understanding historical debates.\nAuthorship.\nThe rabbis who contributed to the Mishnah are known as the Tannaim, of whom approximately 120 are known. The period during which the Mishnah was assembled spanned about 130 years, or five generations, in the first and second centuries. Judah ha-Nasi is credited with the final redaction and publication of the Mishnah: Abraham ben David calculated the date as 189. There have been a few additions since his time according to the \"Iggeret\" of Sherira Gaon. those passages that cite him or his grandson, Judah II, and the end of tractate Sotah, which refers to the period after Judah's death. In addition to redacting the Mishnah, Judah and his court also ruled on which opinions should be followed, although the rulings do not always appear in the text.\nMost of the Mishnah is related without attribution (\"\"). This usually indicates that many sages taught so, or that Judah the Prince ruled so. The halakhic ruling usually follows that view. Sometimes, however, it appears to be the opinion of a single sage, and the view of the sages collectively (, \"hachamim\") is given separately.\nAs Judah the Prince went through the tractates, the Mishnah was set forth, but throughout his life some parts were updated as new information came to light. Because of the proliferation of earlier versions, it was deemed too hard to retract anything already released, and therefore a second version of certain laws were released. The Talmud refers to these differing versions as ' (\"First Mishnah\") and ' (\"Last Mishnah\"). David Zvi Hoffmann suggests that \"Mishnah Rishonah\" actually refers to texts from earlier Sages upon which Rebbi based his Mishnah.\nThe Talmud records a tradition that unattributed statements of the law represent the views of Rabbi Meir in Sanhedrin 86a, which supports the theory as recorded in the \"Iggeret\" of Sherira that he was the author of an earlier collection. For this reason, the few passages that actually say \"this is the view of Rabbi Meir\" represent cases where the author intended to present Rabbi Meir's view as a \"minority opinion\" not representing the accepted law.\nThere are also references to the \"Mishnah of Rabbi Akiva\", suggesting a still earlier collection; on the other hand, these references may simply mean his teachings in general. Another possibility is that Rabbi Akiva and Rabbi Meir established the divisions and order of subjects in the Mishnah, making them the authors of a school curriculum rather than of a book.\nAuthorities are divided on whether Judah the Prince recorded the Mishnah in writing or established it as an oral text for memorisation. The most important early account of its composition, the \"Iggeret\" of Rabbi Sherira Gaon is ambiguous on the point, although the Spanish recension leans to the theory that the Mishnah was written. However, the Talmud records that, in every study session, there was a person called the \"tanna\" appointed to recite the Mishnah passage under discussion. This may indicate that, even if the Mishnah was reduced to writing, it was not available on general distribution.\nMishnah studies.\nTextual variants.\nVery roughly, there are two traditions of Mishnah text. One is found in manuscripts and printed editions of the Mishnah on its own, or as part of the Jerusalem Talmud. The other is found in manuscripts and editions of the Babylonian Talmud; though there is sometimes a difference between the text of a whole paragraph printed at the beginning of a discussion (which may be edited to conform with the text of the Mishnah-only editions) and the line-by-line citations in the course of the discussion.\nRobert Brody, in his \"Mishna and Tosefta Studies\" (Jerusalem 2014), warns against oversimplifying the picture by assuming that the Mishnah-only tradition is always the more authentic, or that it represents a \"Palestinian\" as against a \"Babylonian\" tradition. Manuscripts from the Cairo Geniza, or citations in other works, may support either type of reading or other readings altogether.\nManuscripts.\nMostly-complete manuscripts (mss.) bolded. Each is missing pages, some of which have been replaced by later hands. \nThe earliest extant material witness to rabbinic literature of any kind is dated to the 6th to 7th centuries CE, see Mosaic of Rehob.\nThe Literature of the Jewish People in the Period of the Second Temple and the Talmud, Volume 3 The Literature of the Sages: First Part: Oral Tora, Halakha, Mishna, Tosefta, Talmud, External Tractates. \"Compendia Rerum Iudaicarum ad Novum Testamentum\", Ed. Shmuel Safrai, Brill, 1987, \nPrinted editions.\nThe first printed edition of the Mishnah was published in Naples. There have been many subsequent editions, including the late 19th century Vilna edition, which is the basis of the editions now used by the religious public.\nVocalized editions were published in Italy, culminating in the edition of David ben Solomon Altaras, publ. Venice 1737. The Altaras edition was republished in Mantua in 1777, in Pisa in 1797 and 1810 and in Livorno in many editions from 1823 until 1936: reprints of the vocalized Livorno editions were published in Israel in 1913, 1962, 1968 and 1976. These editions show some textual variants by bracketing doubtful words and passages, though they do not attempt detailed textual criticism. The Livorno editions are the basis of the Sephardic tradition for recitation.\nAs well as being printed on its own, the Mishnah is included in all editions of the Babylonian and Jerusalem Talmuds. Each paragraph is printed on its own, and followed by the relevant Gemara discussion. However, that discussion itself often cites the Mishnah line by line. While the text printed in paragraph form has generally been standardized to follow the Vilna edition, the text cited line by line in the Gemara often preserves important variants, which sometimes reflect the readings of older manuscripts.\nThe nearest approach to a critical edition is that of Hanoch Albeck. There is also an edition by Yosef Qafi\u1e25 of the Mishnah together with the commentary of Maimonides, which compares the base text used by Maimonides with the Napoli and Vilna editions and other sources.\nOral traditions and pronunciation.\nThe Mishnah was and still is traditionally studied through recitation (out loud). Jewish communities around the world preserved local melodies for chanting the Mishnah, and distinctive ways of pronouncing its words.\nMany medieval manuscripts of the Mishnah are vowelized, and some of these, especially some fragments found in the Genizah, are partially annotated with Tiberian cantillation marks.\nToday, many communities have a special tune for the Mishnaic passage \"Bammeh madliqin\" in the Friday night service; there may also be tunes for Mishnaic passages in other parts of the liturgy, such as the passages in the daily prayers relating to sacrifices and incense and the paragraphs recited at the end of the Musaf service on Shabbat. Otherwise, there is often a customary intonation used in the study of Mishnah or Talmud, somewhat similar to an Arabic mawwal, but this is not reduced to a precise system like that for the Biblical books. (In some traditions this intonation is the same as or similar to that used for the Passover Haggadah.) Recordings have been made for Israeli national archives, and Frank Alvarez-Pereyre has published a book-length study of the Syrian tradition of Mishnah reading on the basis of these recordings.\nMost vowelized editions of the Mishnah today reflect standard Ashkenazic vowelization, and often contain mistakes. The Albeck edition of the Mishnah was vocalized by Hanoch Yelon, who made careful eclectic use of both medieval manuscripts and current oral traditions of pronunciation from Jewish communities all over the world. The Albeck edition includes an introduction by Yelon detailing his eclectic method.\nTwo institutes at the Hebrew University in Jerusalem have collected major oral archives which hold extensive recordings of Jews chanting the Mishnah using a variety of melodies and many different kinds of pronunciation. These institutes are the Jewish Oral Traditions Research Center and the National Voice Archives (the \"Phonoteca\" at the Jewish National and University Library). See below for external links.\nAs a historical source.\nBoth the Mishnah and Talmud contain little serious biographical studies of the people discussed therein, and the same tractate will conflate the points of view of many different people. Yet, sketchy biographies of the Mishnaic sages can often be constructed with historical detail from Talmudic and Midrashic sources.\nAccording to the Encyclopaedia Judaica (Second Edition), it is accepted that Judah the Prince added, deleted, and rewrote his source material during the process of redacting the Mishnah between the ending of the second century and the beginning of the 3rd century CE. Modern authors who have provided examples of these changes include J.N. Epstein and S. Friedman.\nFollowing Judah the Prince's redaction there remained a number of different versions of the Mishnah in circulation. The Mishnah used in the Babylonian rabbinic community differing markedly from that used in the Palestinian one. Indeed within these rabbinic communities themselves there are indications of different versions being used for study. These differences are shown in divergent citations of individual Mishnah passages in the Talmud Yerushalmi and the Talmud Bavli, and in variances of medieval manuscripts and early editions of the Mishnah. The best known examples of these differences is found in J.N.Epstein's Introduction to the Text of the Mishnah (1948).\nEpstein has also concluded that the period of the Amoraim was one of further deliberate changes to the text of the Mishnah, which he views as attempts to return the text to what was regarded as its original form. These lessened over time, as the text of the Mishnah became more and more regarded as authoritative.\nMany modern historical scholars have focused on the timing and the formation of the Mishnah. A vital question is whether it is composed of sources which date from its editor's lifetime, and to what extent is it composed of earlier, or later sources. Are Mishnaic disputes distinguishable along theological or communal lines, and in what ways do different sections derive from different schools of thought within early Judaism? Can these early sources be identified, and if so, how? In response to these questions, modern scholars have adopted a number of different approaches.\nCommentaries.\nThe main work discussing the Mishnah is the Talmud, as outlined.\nHowever, the Talmud is not usually viewed as a commentary on the Mishnah \"per se\", because:\nthe Talmud also has many other goals; its analysis \u2013 \"Gemara\" \u2013 often entails long, tangential discussions; and neither version of the Talmud covers the entire Mishnah (each covers about 50\u201370% of the text). As a result, numerous commentaries-proper on the Mishna have been written, typically intended to allow for the study of the work without requiring direct reference to (and facility for) the \"Gemara\".\nList of commentaries.\nCommentaries by Rishonim:\nProminent commentaries by early Acharonim:\nOther commentaries by early Acharonim:\n19th century:\n20th century:\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "19522", "revid": "14595349", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19522", "title": "Monotheism", "text": "Belief that there is only one God\nMonotheism is the belief that one God is the only, or at least the dominant deity. A distinction may be made between exclusive monotheism, in which the one God is a singular existence, and both inclusive and pluriform monotheism, in which multiple gods or godly forms are recognized, but each are postulated as extensions of the same God.\nMonotheism is distinguished from henotheism, a religious system in which the believer worships one god without denying that others may worship different gods with equal validity, and monolatrism, the recognition of the existence of many gods but with the consistent worship of only one deity. \nMonotheism characterizes the traditions of Abrahamic religions such as Judaism, Christianity, Islam, and the early derivatives of these faiths, including Samaratinism and Druzism.\nOther early monotheistic traditions include Atenism of ancient Egypt, Platonic and Neoplatonic belief in the Monad, Mandaeism, Manichaeism, Waaqeffanna, and Zoroastrianism.\nMonotheistic traditions from post-antiquity and the early modern period comprise Deism, Yazidism, and Sikhism, with varying degrees of influence from Abrahamic monotheism. Many new religious movements are monotheistic such as B\u00e1bism, the Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed Faith, Seicho-No-Ie, and Tenrikyo.\nNarrow monotheism and wide monotheism exist on a spectrum of belief. Narrow monotheism holds that only one exclusive deity exists, disallowing others, while wide monotheism acknowledges one supreme deity and permits lesser deities. Elements of wide monotheistic thought are found in early religions such as \nancient Chinese religion, Tengrism, and Yahwism.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:TOC limit/styles.css\" /&gt;\nEtymology, origin, and usage.\nThe word \"monotheism\" is a combination of the Greek (\"monos\") meaning \"single\" and (\"theos\") meaning \"god\". \n'Monotheism' was coined by Henry More in 1660; it was not a term used in the Greco-Roman period. More's usage of the concept was not particularly rigorous by later standards, with it more serving as a marker of \"good\" religion against bad. For example, More condemned Islam as having \"hypocritical\" monotheism with Muslims \"still truly Pagans\", and thought that pantheists did not count as monotheists either, because \"to make the \"World\" God is to make no God at all\". Other writers in the 17th and 18th centuries were similarly lax; Ralph Cudworth wrote that Greek Platonism was monotheistic, seemingly out of admiration for Platonism.\nMonotheism is a complex and nuanced concept. The biblical authors had various ways of understanding God and the divine, shaped by their historical and cultural contexts. The notion of monotheism that is used today was developed much later, influenced by the Enlightenment and Christian views. Many definitions of monotheism are inherently modern and Christian-centered, and do not map easily to the diversity and complexity of the ancient sources.\nThe term \"monotheism\" is often contrasted with \"polytheism\", but many scholars prefer other terms such as monolatry, henotheism, or one-god discourse.\nHistory.\nQuasi-monotheistic claims of the existence of a universal deity date to the Late Bronze Age, with Akhenaten's \"Great Hymn to the Aten\" from the 14th century BCE.\nIn the Iron-Age South Asian Vedic period, a possible inclination towards monotheism emerged. The Rigveda exhibits notions of monism of the Brahman, particularly in the comparatively late tenth book, which is dated to the early Iron Age, e.g. in the Nasadiya Sukta. Later, ancient Hindu theology was monist, but was not strictly monotheistic in worship because it still maintained the existence of many gods, who were envisioned as aspects of one supreme God, Brahman.\nIn China, the orthodox faith system held by most dynasties since at least the Shang dynasty (1766\u00a0BCE) until the modern period centered on the worship of \"Shangdi\" (literally \"Above Sovereign\", generally translated as \"God\") or Heaven as an omnipotent force. However, this faith system was not truly monotheistic since other lesser gods and spirits, which varied with locality, were also worshipped along with \"Shangdi\". Still, later variants such as Mohism (470 BCE\u2013c.391 BCE) approached true monotheism, teaching that the function of lesser gods and ancestral spirits is merely to carry out the will of \"Shangdi\", akin to the angels in Abrahamic religions which in turn counts as only one god.\nSince the sixth century BCE, Zoroastrians have believed in the supremacy of one God above all: Ahura Mazda as the \"Maker of All\" and the first being before all others. The prophet Zoroaster is credited with the founding of the first monotheistic religion in history sometime as early as the middle of the second millennium BCE, leaving a lasting influence on other belief systems such as Second Temple Judaism and, through it, on later monotheistic religions. Scholars are conflicted whether Zoroastrianism is best characterized as monotheistic, polytheistic, or henotheistic religion due to the centrality of Ahriman as a component or opposite force of Ahura Mazda.\nPost-exilic Judaism, after the late 6th century BCE, was the first religion to conceive the notion of a personal monotheistic God within a monist context. The concept of ethical monotheism, which holds that morality stems from God alone and that its laws are unchanging, first occurred in Judaism, but is now a core tenet of most modern monotheistic religions, including Christianity, Islam, Sikhism, and Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed Faith.\nAlso from the 6th century BCE, Thales (followed by other Monists, such as Anaximander, Anaximenes, Heraclitus, Parmenides) proposed that nature can be explained by reference to a single unitary principle that pervades everything. Numerous ancient Greek philosophers, including Xenophanes of Colophon and Antisthenes, believed in a similar polytheistic monism that bore some similarities to monotheism. The first known reference to a unitary God is Plato's Demiurge (divine Craftsman), followed by Aristotle's unmoved mover, both of which would profoundly influence Jewish and Christian theology.\nAccording to contemporary Jewish, Christian and Islamic tradition, monotheism was the original religion of humanity; this original religion is sometimes referred to as \"the Adamic religion\", or, in the terms of Andrew Lang, the \"Urreligion\". Scholars of religion largely abandoned that view in the 19th and 20th centuries in favour of an evolutionary progression from animism via polytheism to monotheism. More recently, Karen Armstrong and other authors have returned to the idea of an evolutionary progression beginning with animism, which developed into polytheism, which developed into henotheism, which developed into monolatry, which developed into true monotheism. This order was reversed by Austrian anthropologist Wilhelm Schmidt, who had postulated an \"Urmonotheismus\", \"original\" or \"primitive monotheism\" in the 1910s. The evolution of monotheism is bound with universal monarchies.\nNarrow and wide monotheism.\n\"Narrow monotheism\" is a religion that believes in only one deity, disallowing the possibility of there being other deities. \"Wide monotheism\" is a religion that believes in only one supreme deity, allowing the possibility of there being other lesser deities. A narrow monotheistic religion will often regard other monotheistic religions as worshipping its own specific deity under a different name or form (hence the Abrahamic religions believe they worship the same one God). A wide monotheistic religion will often regard other monotheistic religions as worshipping deities lesser than its own specific deity (hence Atenism believes Yahweh to be a lesser deity to Aten). Examples of narrow monotheist religions includes: Judaism, Christianity, Islam, Sikhism, and Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed Faith. Examples of wide monotheism include: Atenism, Native American worship of the Great Spirit, Hinduism, Chinese religions, Tengrism, Mandaeism, Rastafari, Yazidism, Zoroastrianism, Proto-Indo-European religion, Hellenistic religion, and Andaman Islands religion.\nRegions.\nAfrica.\nEastern Africa.\nAccording to Robin Dunbar, an evolutionary psychologist, the emergence of doctrinal religions is closely linked to environmental and social factors. He argues that large, densely populated societies\u2014often arising in agriculturally productive regions\u2014required more formalized religious structures to maintain social cohesion. In particular, the shift from small, kin-based communities to larger settlements increased the need for moralizing gods and centralized rituals. Additionally, the climatic stability of the Northern Subtropical Zone during the Neolithic facilitated surplus food production, enabling religious specialists to emerge and institutionalize belief systems.\nDunbar identifies two early monotheistic traditions in sub-Saharan Africa. The Cushitic-speaking populations of the central Nile Valley (present-day Sudan) circa 5th millennium BCE worshipped Waaq, a singular sky deity whose veneration persists among some Cushitic groups. Later, Nilotic-speaking societies migrating southward developed or adopted similar beliefs, with singular deities such as Engai of the Maasai, though often combined with ancestral reverence and spirit veneration. Many Southern Nilotic peoples such as the Samburu and Datooga have substantial Cushitic ancestry from the Savanna Pastoral Neolithic communities believed to be of Cushitic origin.\nWaaq is the name of a singular God in the traditional religion of many Cushitic people in the Horn of Africa, denoting an early monotheistic religion. However, this religion was mostly replaced with the Abrahamic religions, such as Islam in the case of the Somali. The term \"barwaaqo\" in the Somali language means prosperity still includes the name of Waaq. The Somali rendition of the Ethiopian prosperity party is \"Xisbiga Barwaaqo\". The Somali city of Abudwak means 'worship Waaq' in Somali. Some Oromo still follow the traditional monotheistic religion called Waaqeffanna in the Oromo language.\nIrreechaa is an annual thanksgiving festival celebrated by the Oromo people, primarily in Ethiopia, marking the end of the rainy season and the beginning of the harvest. It is a spiritual occasion dedicated to Waaq, the supreme God in traditional Oromo belief, symbolizing gratitude for nature's abundance. The festival is observed in various regions, with its largest celebration taking place in Addis Ababa, where tens of thousands of people gather near bodies of water to offer prayers, songs, and traditional rituals. Irreechaa not only reflects deep-rooted cultural practices but also promotes unity and peace among the Oromo community and beyond.\nAncient Egypt.\nAtenism.\nAmenhotep IV initially introduced Atenism in Year 5 of his reign (1348/1346 BCE) during the 18th dynasty of the New Kingdom. He raised Aten, once a relatively obscure Egyptian solar deity representing the disk of the sun, to the status of Supreme God in the Egyptian pantheon. To emphasise the change, Aten's name was written in the cartouche form normally reserved for Pharaohs, an innovation of Atenism. This religious reformation appears to coincide with the proclamation of a Sed festival, a sort of royal jubilee intended to reinforce the Pharaoh's divine powers of kingship. Traditionally held in the thirtieth year of the Pharaoh's reign, this possibly was a festival in honour of Amenhotep III, who some Egyptologists think had a coregency with his son Amenhotep IV of two to twelve years.\nYear 5 is believed to mark the beginning of Amenhotep IV's construction of a new capital, Akhetaten (\"Horizon of the Aten\"), at the site known today as Amarna. Evidence of this appears on three of the boundary stelae used to mark the boundaries of this new capital. At this time, Amenhotep IV officially changed his name to Akhenaten (\"Agreeable to Aten\") as evidence of his new worship. The date given for the event has been estimated to fall around January 2 of that year. In Year 7 of his reign (1346/1344 BCE), the capital was moved from Thebes to Akhetaten (near modern Amarna), though construction of the city seems to have continued for two more years. In shifting his court from the traditional ceremonial centres Akhenaten was signalling a dramatic transformation in the focus of religious and political power.\nThe move separated the Pharaoh and his court from the influence of the priesthood and from the traditional centres of worship, but his decree had deeper religious significance too\u2014taken in conjunction with his name change, it is possible that the move to Amarna was also meant as a signal of Akhenaten's symbolic death and rebirth. It may also have coincided with the death of his father and the end of the coregency. In addition to constructing a new capital in honor of Aten, Akhenaten also oversaw the construction of some of the most massive temple complexes in ancient Egypt, including one at Karnak and one at Thebes, close to the old temple of Amun.\nIn Year 9 (1344/1342 BCE), Akhenaten declared a more radical version of his new religion, declaring Aten not merely the supreme god of the Egyptian pantheon, but the only God of Egypt, with himself as the sole intermediary between the Aten and the Egyptian people. Key features of Atenism included a ban on idols and other images of the Aten, with the exception of a rayed solar disc, in which the rays (commonly depicted ending in hands) appear to represent the unseen spirit of Aten. Akhenaten made it however clear that the image of the Aten only represented the god, but that the god transcended creation and so could not be fully understood or represented. Aten was addressed by Akhenaten in prayers, such as the \"Great Hymn to the Aten\": \"O Sole God beside whom there is none\".\nThe details of Atenist theology are still unclear. The exclusion of all but one god and the prohibition of idols was a radical departure from Egyptian tradition, but scholars see Akhenaten as a practitioner of monolatry rather than monotheism, as he did not actively deny the existence of other gods; he simply refrained from worshiping any but Aten. Akhenaten associated Aten with Ra and put forward the eminence of Aten as the renewal of the kingship of Ra.\nUnder Akhenaten's successors, Egypt reverted to its traditional religion, and Akhenaten himself came to be reviled as a heretic.\nOther monotheistic traditions.\nSome Egyptian ethical text authors believed in only a single god ruling over the universe.\nCentral Africa.\nBukongo' is the traditional religion of the Kongo people, originating from Central Africa ( the former \"Ntotila kya Kongo\" established parts of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Angola, and the Republic of Congo ). It is based on the belief in a supreme God called Nzambi a Mpungu Tulendo, an abstract, formless entity representing the cycle of the Nza (the Universe) and the source of all life. While it includes practices related to the ancestral community (\"bakulu\") and natural forces that can be embodied by Nzambi a Mpungu, these entities are regarded as respected intermediaries, not as independent deities. As such, Bukongo can be classified as a hierarchical monotheism, with a spiritual structure centered on a single, supreme God.\nAmericas.\nNative American religion.\nNative American religions may be monotheistic, polytheistic, henotheistic, animistic, or some combination thereof. Cherokee religion, for example, is monotheist as well as pantheist.\nThe Great Spirit, called \"Wakan Tanka\" among the Sioux, and \"Gitche Manitou\" in Algonquian, is a conception of universal spiritual force, or supreme being prevalent among some Native American and First Nation cultures. According to Lakota activist Russell Means a better translation of \"Wakan Tanka\" is the Great Mystery. Indeed, \"Wanka Tanka\" among the Lakota was considered a \"council of gods\" in pre-Columbian times, and their religion is not monotheistic.\nSome researchers have interpreted Aztec philosophy as fundamentally monotheistic or panentheistic. While the populace at large believed in a polytheistic pantheon, Aztec priests and nobles might have come to an interpretation of Teotl as a single universal force with many facets. There has been criticism to this idea, however, most notably that many assertions of this supposed monotheism might actually come from post-Conquistador bias, imposing an Antiquity pagan model onto the Aztec.\nAsia.\nSouth Asia.\nHinduism.\nAs an old religion, Hinduism inherits religious concepts spanning monotheism, polytheism, panentheism, pantheism, monism, and atheism among others; and its concept of God is complex and depends upon each individual and the tradition and philosophy followed.\nHindu views are broad and range from monism, through pantheism and panentheism (alternatively called monistic theism by some scholars) to monotheism and even atheism. Hinduism cannot be said to be purely polytheistic. Hindu religious leaders have repeatedly stressed that while God's forms are many and the ways to communicate with him are many, God is one. The \"puja\" of the \"murti\" is a way to communicate with the abstract one god (\"Brahman\") which creates, sustains and dissolves creation.\nRig Veda 1.164.46,\n\"\n\"They call him Indra, Mitra, Varu\u1e47a, Agni, and he is heavenly nobly-winged Garuda.\nTo what is One, sages give many a title they call it Agni, Yama, M\u0101tari\u015bvan.\" (trans. Griffith)\nTraditions of Gaudiya Vaishnavas, the Nimbarka Sampradaya and followers of Swaminarayan and Vallabha consider Krishna to be the source of all avatars, and the source of Vishnu himself, or to be the same as Narayana. As such, he is therefore regarded as \"Svayam Bhagavan\".\nWhen Krishna is recognized to be \"Svayam Bhagavan\", it can be understood that this is the belief of Gaudiya Vaishnavism, the Vallabha Sampradaya, and the Nimbarka Sampradaya, where Krishna is accepted to be the source of all other avatars, and the source of Vishnu himself. This belief is drawn primarily \"from the famous statement of the Bhagavatam\" (1.3.28). A viewpoint differing from this theological concept is the concept of Krishna as an \"avatar\" of Narayana or Vishnu. It should be however noted that although it is usual to speak of Vishnu as the source of the avataras, this is only one of the names of the God of Vaishnavism, who is also known as Narayana, Vasudeva and Krishna and behind each of those names there is a divine figure with attributed supremacy in Vaishnavism.\nThe Rig Veda discusses monotheistic thought, as do the Atharva Veda and Yajur Veda:\n\"Devas are always looking to the supreme abode of Vishnu\" (\"tad vi\u1e63\u1e47o\u1e25 parama\u1e41 pada\u1e41 sad\u0101 pa\u015byanti s\u1e7braya\u1e25\" Rig Veda 1.22.20)\n\"The One Truth, sages know by many names\" (Rig Veda 1.164.46)\n\"When at first the unborn sprung into being, He won His own dominion beyond which nothing higher has been in existence\" (Atharva Veda 10.7.31)\n\"There is none to compare with Him. There is no parallel to Him, whose glory, verily, is great.\" (Yajur Veda 32.3)\nThe number of auspicious qualities of God are countless, with the following six qualities (\"bhaga\") being the most important:\nIn the Shaivite tradition, the \"Shri Rudram\" (Sanskrit \u0936\u094d\u0930\u0940 \u0930\u0941\u0926\u094d\u0930\u092e\u094d), to which the Chamakam (\u091a\u092e\u0915\u092e\u094d) is added by scriptural tradition, is a Hindu \"stotra\" dedicated to Rudra (an epithet of Shiva), taken from the Yajurveda (TS 4.5, 4.7). Shri Rudram is also known as \"Sri Rudraprasna\", \"\", and \"Rudradhyaya\". The text is important in Vedanta where Shiva is equated to the Universal supreme God. The hymn is an early example of enumerating the names of a deity, a tradition developed extensively in the sahasranama literature of Hinduism.\nThe Nyaya school of Hinduism has made several arguments regarding a monotheistic view. The Naiyanikas have given an argument that such a god can only be one. In the \"Nyaya Kusumanjali\", this is discussed against the proposition of the \"Mimamsa\" school that let us assume there were many demigods (\"devas\") and sages (\"rishis\") in the beginning, who wrote the Vedas and created the world. Nyaya says that:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;[If they assume such] omniscient beings, those endowed with the various superhuman faculties of assuming infinitesimal size, and so on, and capable of creating everything, then we reply that the \"law of parsimony\" bids us assume only one such, namely Him, the adorable Lord. There can be no confidence in a non-eternal and non-omniscient being, and hence it follows that according to the system which rejects God, the tradition of the Veda is simultaneously overthrown; there is no other way open.\nIn other words, Nyaya says that the polytheist would have to give elaborate proofs for the existence and origin of his several celestial spirits, none of which would be logical, and that it is more logical to assume one eternal, omniscient god.\nMany other Hindus, however, view polytheism as far preferable to monotheism. The famous Hindu revitalist leader Ram Swarup, for example, points to the Vedas as being specifically polytheistic, and states that, \"only some form of polytheism alone can do justice to this variety and richness.\"\nSita Ram Goel, another 20th-century Hindu historian, wrote:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;I had an occasion to read the typescript of a book [Ram Swarup] had finished writing in 1973. It was a profound study of Monotheism, the central dogma of both Islam and Christianity, as well as a powerful presentation of what the monotheists denounce as Hindu Polytheism. I had never read anything like it. It was a revelation to me that Monotheism was not a religious concept but an imperialist idea. I must confess that I myself had been inclined towards Monotheism till this time. I had never thought that a multiplicity of Gods was the natural and spontaneous expression of an evolved consciousness.\nSikhism.\nSikhi is a monotheistic and a revealed religion. God in Sikhism is called Akal Purakh (which means \"The Immortal Being\") or \"V\u0101higur\u016b\" (Wondrous Enlightener). However, other names like Rama, Brahman, Khuda, Allah, etc. are also used to refer to the same God, who is shapeless, timeless, and sightless: \"nira\u1e45k\u0101r\", \"akaal\", and \"alakh\". Sikhi presents a unique perspective where God is present (\"sarav vi\u0101pak\") in all of its creation and does not exist outside of its creation. God must be seen from \"the inward eye\", or the \"heart\". Sikhs follow the Aad Guru Granth Sahib and are instructed to meditate on the Naam (Name of God - \"V\u0101higur\u016b\") to progress towards enlightenment, as its rigorous application permits the existence of communication between God and human beings.\nSikhism is a monotheistic faith that arose in the Punjab region of the Indian subcontinent during the 16th and 17th centuries. Sikhs believe in one, timeless, omnipresent, supreme creator. The opening verse of the Guru Granth Sahib, known as the Mul Mantra, signifies this:\nTransliteration: ikk \u014dank\u0101r sat(i)-n\u0101m(u) karat\u0101 purakh(u) nirabha'u niravair(u) ak\u0101la m\u016brat(i) aj\u016bn\u012b saibhan gur(a) pras\u0101d(i).\nOne Universal creator God, The supreme Unchangeable Truth, The Creator of the Universe, Beyond Fear, Beyond Hatred, Beyond Death, Beyond Birth, Self-Existent, by Guru's Grace.\nThe word \"\u0a74\" (\"Ik \u014da\u1e45k\u0101r\") has two components. The first is \u0a67, the digit \"1\" in Gurmukhi signifying the singularity of the creator. Together the word means: \"One Universal creator God\".\nIt is often said that the 1430 pages of the Guru Granth Sahib are all expansions on the Mul Mantra. Although the Sikhs have many names for God, some derived from Islam and Hinduism, they all refer to the same Supreme Being.\nThe Sikh holy scriptures refer to the One God who pervades the whole of space and is the creator of all beings in the universe. The following quotation from the Guru Granth Sahib highlights this point:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Chant, and meditate on the One God, who permeates and pervades the many beings of the whole Universe. God created it, and God spreads through it everywhere. Everywhere I look, I see God. The Perfect Lord is perfectly pervading and permeating the water, the land and the sky; there is no place without Him.\u2014\u200a\nHowever, there is a strong case for arguing that the Guru Granth Sahib teaches monism due to its non-dualistic tendencies:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Guru Granth Sahib, Page 13\nSikhs believe that God has been given many names, but they all refer to the One God, V\u0101hiGur\u016b. Sikh holy scripture (Guru Granth Sahib) speaks to all faiths and Sikhs believe that members of other religions such as Islam, Hinduism and Christianity all worship the same God, and the names Allah, Rahim, Karim, Hari, Raam and Paarbrahm are, therefore, frequently mentioned in the Sikh holy scripture (Guru Granth Sahib) . God in Sikhism is most commonly referred to as Akal Purakh (which means \"The Immortal Being\") or Waheguru, the Wondrous Enlightener.\nEast Asia.\nChinese religion.\nThe orthodox faith system held by most dynasties of China since at least the Shang dynasty (1766\u00a0BCE) until the modern period centered on the worship of \"Shangdi\" (literally \"Above Sovereign\", generally translated as \"High-god\") or Heaven as a supreme being, standing above other gods. This faith system pre-dated the development of Confucianism and Taoism and the introduction of Buddhism and Christianity. It has some features of monotheism in that Heaven is seen as an omnipotent entity, a noncorporeal force with a personality transcending the world. However, this faith system was not truly monotheistic since other lesser gods and spirits, which varied with locality, were also worshiped along with \"Shangdi\". Still, later variants such as Mohism (470 BCE\u2013c.391 BCE) approached true monotheism, teaching that the function of lesser gods and ancestral spirits is merely to carry out the will of \"Shangdi.\" In Mozi's \"Will of Heaven\" (\u5929\u5fd7), he writes:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;I know Heaven loves men dearly not without reason. Heaven ordered the sun, the moon, and the stars to enlighten and guide them. Heaven ordained the four seasons, Spring, Autumn, Winter, and Summer, to regulate them. Heaven sent down snow, frost, rain, and dew to grow the five grains and flax and silk that so the people could use and enjoy them. Heaven established the hills and rivers, ravines and valleys, and arranged many things to minister to man's good or bring him evil. He appointed the dukes and lords to reward the virtuous and punish the wicked, and to gather metal and wood, birds and beasts, and to engage in cultivating the five grains and flax and silk to provide for the people's food and clothing. This has been so from antiquity to the present.\n\u4e14\u543e\u6240\u4ee5\u77e5\u5929\u4e4b\u611b\u6c11\u4e4b\u539a\u8005\u6709\u77e3\uff0c\u66f0\u4ee5\u78e8\u70ba\u65e5\u6708\u661f\u8fb0\uff0c\u4ee5\u662d\u9053\u4e4b\uff1b\u5236\u70ba\u56db\u6642\u6625\u79cb\u51ac\u590f\uff0c\u4ee5\u7d00\u7db1\u4e4b\uff1b\u96f7\u964d\u96ea\u971c\u96e8\u9732\uff0c\u4ee5\u9577\u9042\u4e94\u7a40\u9ebb\u7d72\uff0c\u4f7f\u6c11\u5f97\u800c\u8ca1\u5229\u4e4b\uff1b\u5217\u70ba\u5c71\u5ddd\u8c3f\u8c37\uff0c\u64ad\u8ce6\u767e\u4e8b\uff0c\u4ee5\u81e8\u53f8\u6c11\u4e4b\u5584\u5426\uff1b\u70ba\u738b\u516c\u4faf\u4f2f\uff0c\u4f7f\u4e4b\u8cde\u8ce2\u800c\u7f70\u66b4\uff1b\u8cca\u91d1\u6728\u9ce5\u7378\uff0c\u5f9e\u4e8b\u4e4e\u4e94\u7a40\u9ebb\u7d72\uff0c\u4ee5\u70ba\u6c11\u8863\u98df\u4e4b\u8ca1\u3002\u81ea\u53e4\u53ca\u4eca\uff0c\u672a\u5617\u4e0d\u6709\u6b64\u4e5f\u3002\u2014\u200a\nWorship of \"Shangdi\" and Heaven in ancient China includes the erection of shrines, the last and greatest being the Temple of Heaven in Beijing, and the offering of prayers. The ruler of China in every Chinese dynasty would perform annual sacrificial rituals to \"Shangdi\", usually by slaughtering a completely healthy bull as sacrifice. Although its popularity gradually diminished after the advent of Taoism and Buddhism, among other religions, its concepts remained in use throughout the pre-modern period and have been incorporated in later religions in China, including terminology used by early Christians in China. Despite the rising of non-theistic and pantheistic spirituality contributed by Taoism and Buddhism, Shangdi was still praised up until the end of the Qing dynasty as the last ruler of the Qing declared himself son of heaven.\nTengrism.\nTengrism or Tangrism (sometimes stylized as Tengriism), occasionally referred to as Tengrianism, is a modern term for a Central Asian religion characterized by features of shamanism, animism, totemism, both polytheism and monotheism, and ancestor worship. Historically, it was the prevailing religion of the Bulgars, Turks, Mongols, and Hungarians, as well as the Xiongnu and the Huns. It was the state religion of the six ancient Turkic states: Avar Khaganate, Old Great Bulgaria, First Bulgarian Empire, G\u00f6kt\u00fcrks Khaganate, Eastern Tourkia and Western Turkic Khaganate. In \"Irk Bitig\", Tengri is mentioned as \"T\u00fcr\u00fck T\u00e4ngrisi\" (God of Turks). The term is perceived among Turkic peoples as a \"national\" religion.\nIn Chinese and Turco-Mongol traditions, the Supreme God is commonly referred to as the ruler of Heaven, or the Sky Lord granted with omnipotent powers, but it has largely diminished in those regions due to ancestor worship, Taoism's pantheistic views and Buddhism's rejection of a creator God. On some occasions in the mythology, the Sky Lord as identified as a male has been associated to mate with an Earth Mother, while some traditions kept the omnipotence of the Sky Lord unshared.\nWest Asia.\nAbrahamic religions.\nBah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed Faith.\nGod in the Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed Faith is taught to be the Imperishable, uncreated Being Who is the source of existence, too great for humans to fully comprehend. Human primitive understanding of God is achieved through his revelations via his divine intermediary Manifestations. In the Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed faith, such Christian doctrines as the Trinity are seen as compromising the Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed view that God is single and has no equal,\nand the very existence of the Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed Faith is a challenge to the Islamic doctrine of the finality of Muhammad's revelation.\nGod in the Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed Faith communicates to humanity through divine intermediaries, known as Manifestations of God. These Manifestations establish religion in the world. It is through these divine intermediaries that humans can approach God, and through them God brings divine revelation and law.\nThe Oneness of God is one of the core teachings of the Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed Faith. The obligatory prayers in the Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed Faith involve explicit monotheistic testimony. God is the imperishable, uncreated being who is the source of all existence. He is described as \"a personal God, unknowable, inaccessible, the source of all Revelation, eternal, omniscient, omnipresent and almighty\". Although transcendent and inaccessible directly, his image is reflected in his creation. The purpose of creation is for the created to have the capacity to know and love its creator. God communicates his will and purpose to humanity through intermediaries, known as Manifestations of God, who are the prophets and messengers that have founded religions from prehistoric times up to the present day.\nChristianity.\nAmong early Christians, there was considerable debate over the nature of the Godhead, with some denying the incarnation but not the deity of Jesus (Docetism) and others later calling for an Arian conception of God. Despite at least one earlier local synod rejecting the claim of Arius, this Christological issue was to be one of the items addressed at the First Council of Nicaea.\nThe First Council of Nicaea, held in Nicaea (in present-day Turkey), convoked by the Roman Emperor Constantine I in 325, was the first ecumenical council of bishops of the Roman Empire, and most significantly resulted in the first uniform Christian doctrine, called the Nicene Creed. With the creation of the creed, a precedent was established for subsequent general ecumenical councils of bishops (synods) to create statements of belief and canons of doctrinal orthodoxy\u2014the intent being to define a common creed for the Church and address heretical ideas.\nOne purpose of the council was to resolve disagreements in Alexandria over the nature of Jesus in relationship to the Father; in particular, whether Jesus was of the same substance as God the Father or merely of similar substance. All but two bishops took the first position; while Arius' argument failed.\nChristian orthodox traditions (Eastern Orthodox, Oriental Orthodox, Roman Catholic, and most Protestants) follow this decision, which was reaffirmed in 381 at the First Council of Constantinople and reached its full development through the work of the Cappadocian Fathers. They consider God to be a triune entity, called the Trinity, comprising three \"persons\", God the Father, God the Son, and God the Holy Spirit. These three are described as being \"of the same substance\" ().\nChristians overwhelmingly assert that monotheism is central to the Christian faith, as the Nicene Creed (and others), which gives the orthodox Christian definition of the Trinity, begins: \"I believe in one God\". From earlier than the times of the Nicene Creed, 325\u00a0CE, various Christian figures advocated the triune mystery-nature of God as a normative profession of faith. According to Roger E. Olson and Christopher Hall, through prayer, meditation, study and practice, the Christian community concluded \"that God must exist as both a unity and trinity\", codifying this in ecumenical council at the end of the 4th century.\nMost modern Christians believe the Godhead is triune, meaning that the three persons of the Trinity are in one union in which each person is also wholly God. They also hold to the doctrine of a man-god Christ Jesus as God incarnate. These Christians also do not believe that one of the three divine figures is God alone and the other two are not but that all three are mysteriously God and one. Other Christian religions, including Unitarian Universalism, Jehovah's Witnesses, Mormonism and others, do not share those views on the Trinity.\nSome Christian faiths, such as Mormonism, argue that the Godhead is in fact three separate individuals which include God the Father, His Son Jesus Christ, and the Holy Ghost, each individual having a distinct purpose in the grand existence of human kind. Furthermore, Mormons believe that before the Council of Nicaea, the predominant belief among many early Christians was that the Godhead was three separate individuals. In support of this view, they cite early Christian examples of belief in subordinationism.\nUnitarianism is a theological movement, named for its understanding of God as one person, in direct contrast to Trinitarianism.\nSome in Judaism and some in Islam do not consider Trinitarian Christianity to be a pure form of monotheism due to the pluriform monotheistic Christian doctrine of the Trinity, classifying it as \"shituf\" in Judaism and as \"shirk\" in Islam. Trinitarian Christians, on the other hand, argue that the doctrine of the Trinity is a valid expression of monotheism, citing that the Trinity does not consist of three separate deities, but rather the three persons, who exist consubstantially (as one substance) within a single Godhead.\nIslam.\nIn Islam, God (All\u0101h) is all-powerful and all-knowing, the Creator, Sustainer, Ordainer and Judge of the universe. God in Islam is strictly singular (\"tawhid\") unique (\"wahid\") and inherently One (\"ahad\"), all-merciful and omnipotent. All\u0101h exists on the \"Al-'Arsh\" [Quran https://], but the Quran states that \"No vision can encompass Him, but He encompasses all vision. For He is the Most Subtle, All-Aware.\" (Quran https://) All\u0101h is the only God and the same God worshiped in Christianity and Judaism(Q https://).\nIslam emerged in the 7th century CE in the context of both Christianity and Judaism, with some thematic elements similar to Gnosticism. Islamic belief states that Muhammad did not bring a new religion from God, but rather the same religion as practiced by Abraham, Moses, David, Jesus and all the other prophets of God. The assertion of Islam is that the message of God had been corrupted, distorted or lost over time, and the Quran was sent to Muhammad in order to correct the lost message of the Tawrat (Torah), Injil (Gospel) and Zabur.\nThe Quran asserts the existence of a single and absolute truth that transcends the world; a unique and indivisible being who is independent of the creation. The Quran rejects binary modes of thinking such as the idea of a duality of God by arguing that both good and evil generate from God's creative act. God is a universal god rather than a local, tribal or parochial one; an absolute who integrates all affirmative values and brooks no evil. Ash'ari theology, which dominated Sunni Islam from the tenth to the nineteenth century, insists on ultimate divine transcendence and holds that divine unity is not accessible to human reason. Ash'arism teaches that human knowledge regarding it is limited to what has been revealed through the prophets, and on such paradoxes as God's creation of evil, revelation had to accept \"bila kayfa\" (without [asking] how).\n\"Tawhid\" constitutes the foremost article of the Muslim profession of faith, \"There is no god but God, Muhammad is the messenger of God. To attribute divinity to a created entity is the only unpardonable sin mentioned in the Quran. The entirety of the Islamic teaching rests on the principle of \"tawhid\".\nMedieval Islamic philosopher Al-Ghazali offered a proof of monotheism from omnipotence, asserting there can only be one omnipotent being. For if there were two omnipotent beings, the first would either have power over the second (meaning the second is not omnipotent) or not (meaning the first is not omnipotent); thus implying that there could only be one omnipotent being.\nAs they traditionally profess a concept of monotheism with a singular entity as God, Judaism and Islam reject the Christian idea of monotheism. Judaism uses the term Shituf to refer to non-monotheistic ways of worshiping God. Although Muslims venerate Jesus (Isa in Arabic) as a prophet and messiah, they do not accept the doctrine that he was a begotten son of God.\nJudaism.\nJudaism is traditionally considered one of the oldest monotheistic religions in the world, although up to the 8th century BCE the Israelites were polytheistic, with their worship including the gods El, Baal, Asherah, and Astarte. Yahweh was originally the national god of the Kingdom of Israel and the Kingdom of Judah. During the 8th century BCE, the worship of Yahweh in Israel was in competition with many other cults, described by the Yahwist faction collectively as Baals. The oldest books of the Hebrew Bible reflect this competition, as in the books of Hosea and Nahum, whose authors lament the \"apostasy\" of the people of Israel, threatening them with the wrath of God if they do not give up their polytheistic cults.\nAs time progressed, the henotheistic cult of Yahweh grew increasingly militant in its opposition to the worship of other gods. Some scholars date the start of widespread monotheism to the late 8th century BCE, and view it as a response to Neo-Assyrian aggression. Later, the reforms of King Josiah imposed a form of strict monolatrism. After the fall of Judah and the beginning of the Babylonian captivity, a small circle of priests and scribes gathered around the exiled royal court, where they first developed the concept of Yahweh as the sole God of the world.\nSecond Temple Judaism and later Rabbinic Judaism became strictly monotheistic. The Babylonian Talmud references other, \"foreign gods\" as non-existent entities to whom humans mistakenly ascribe reality and power. One of the best-known statements of Rabbinic Judaism on monotheism is the Second of Maimonides' 13 Principles of faith:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;God, the Cause of all, is one. This does not mean one as in one of a pair, nor one like a species (which encompasses many individuals), nor one as in an object that is made up of many elements, nor as a single simple object that is infinitely divisible. Rather, God is a unity, unlike any other possible unity.\nSome in Judaism and Islam reject the Christian idea of monotheism. Modern Judaism uses the term \"shituf\" to refer to the worship of God in a manner which Judaism deems to be neither purely monotheistic (though still permissible for non-Jews) nor polytheistic (which would be prohibited).\nMandaeism.\nMandaeism or Mandaeanism ( \"\"), sometimes also known as Sabianism, is a monotheistic, Gnostic, and ethnic religion.Mandaeans consider Adam, Seth, Noah, Shem and John the Baptist to be prophets, with Adam being the founder of the religion and John being the greatest and final prophet.The Mandaeans believe in one God commonly named Hayyi Rabbi meaning 'The Great Life' or 'The Great Living God'. The Mandaeans speak a dialect of Eastern Aramaic known as Mandaic. The name 'Mandaean' comes from the Aramaic \"manda\" meaning \"knowledge\", as does Greek \"gnosis\". The term 'Sabianism' is derived from the Sabians (, ), a mysterious religious group mentioned three times in the Quran alongside the Jews, the Christians and the Zoroastrians as a 'people of the book', and whose name was historically claimed by the Mandaeans as well as by several other religious groups in order to gain the legal protection () offered by Islamic law. Mandaeans recognize God to be the eternal, creator of all, the one and only in domination who has no partner.\nRastafari.\nRastafari, sometimes termed Rastafarianism, is classified as both a new religious movement and social movement. It developed in Jamaica during the 1930s. It lacks any centralised authority and there is much heterogeneity among practitioners, who are known as Rastafari, Rastafarians, or Rastas.\nRastafari refer to their beliefs, which are based on a specific interpretation of the Bible, as \"Rastalogy\". Central is a monotheistic belief in a single God\u2014referred to as Jah\u2014who partially resides within each individual. The former emperor of Ethiopia, Haile Selassie, is given central importance. Many Rastas regard him as an incarnation of Jah on Earth and as the Second Coming of Christ. Others regard him as a human prophet who fully recognised the inner divinity within every individual.\nYazidism.\nGod in Yazidism created the world and entrusted it into the care of seven Holy Beings, known as Angels. The Yazidis believe in a divine Triad. The original, hidden God of the Yazidis is considered to be remote and inactive in relation to his creation, except to contain and bind it together within his essence. His first emanation is the Angel Melek Ta\u00fbs (), who functions as the ruler of the world and leader of the other Angels. The second hypostasis of the divine Triad is the Sheikh 'Ad\u012b ibn Musafir. The third is Sultan Ezid. These are the three hypostases of the one God. The identity of these three is sometimes blurred, with Sheikh 'Ad\u012b considered to be a manifestation of Taw\u00fbs\u00ea Melek and vice versa; the same also applies to Sultan Ezid. Yazidis are called \"\" (\"the nation of Taw\u00fbs\u00ea Melek\").\nGod is referred to by Yazidis as ', , ', and ' ('King'), and, less commonly, ' and \"\". According to some Yazidi hymns (known as \"Qewls\"), God has 1,001 names, or 3,003 names according to other Qewls.\nZoroastrianism.\nBy some scholars, the Zoroastrians (\"Parsis\" or \"Zartoshtis\") are sometimes credited with being some of the first monotheists and having had influence on other world religions. But this theory has been widely criticized, even by Zoroastrians, who consider that their religion believes in two gods, not one god.\nGherardo Gnoli comments that the Islamic conquest of Persia caused a huge impact on the Zoroastrian doctrine:\"After the Islamic conquest of Persia and the migration of many Zoroastrians to India and after being exposed to Islamic and Christian propaganda, the Zoroastrians, especially the Parsis in India, went so far as to deny dualism and consider themselves completely monotheists. After several transformations and developments, one of the distinctive features of the Zoroastrian religion gradually faded away and almost disappeared from modern Zoroastrianism.\"\nManeckji Nusserwanji Dhalla described the doctrine of the Gayomarthians sect as another attempt to mitigate the dualism that has always been the essence of Zoroastrianism. This was due to the Prophet Muhammad's emphasis on monotheism and the Muslims' mockery of the doctrine of worshipping two gods, which made the Zoroastrians view dualism as a defect, so they added monotheism, which led to the Zoroastrians' division into sects and he mentions examples of the Zoroastrian attempt to establish a monotheistic belief by diminishing the importance of Ahriman, including that Ahura Mazda and Ahriman were created from time, or that Ahura Mazda himself allowed the existence of evil, or that Ahriman was a corrupt angel who rebelled against Ahura Mazda. Then he mentions the name of a Persian book from the 15h century in which it is written that the Magi (Zoroastrians) believe that Allah and Iblis are brothers.\nEurope.\nAncient proto-Indo-European religion.\nThe head deity of the Proto-Indo-European religion was the god *\"Dy\u1e17us P\u1e25at\u1e17r \". A number of words derived from the name of this prominent deity are used in various Indo-European languages to denote a monotheistic God. Nonetheless, in spite of this, Proto-Indo-European religion itself was not monotheistic.\nIn Eastern Europe, the ancient traditions of the Slavic religion contained elements of monotheism. In the sixth century AD, the Byzantine chronicler Procopius recorded that the Slavs \"acknowledge that one god, creator of lightning, is the only lord of all: to him do they sacrifice an ox and all sacrificial animals.\" The deity to whom Procopius is referring is the storm god Per\u00fan, whose name is derived from *\"Perkwunos\", the Proto-Indo-European god of lightning. The ancient Slavs syncretized him with the Germanic god Thor and the Biblical prophet Elijah.\nAncient Greek religion.\nClassical Greece.\nThe surviving fragments of the poems of the classical Greek philosopher Xenophanes of Colophon suggest that he held views very similar to those of modern monotheists. His poems harshly criticize the traditional notion of anthropomorphic gods, commenting that \"...if cattle and horses and lions had hands or could paint with their hands and create works such as men do... [they] also would depict the gods' shapes and make their bodies of such a sort as the form they themselves have.\" Instead, Xenophanes declares that there is \"...one god, greatest among gods and humans, like mortals neither in form nor in thought.\" Xenophanes's theology appears to have been monist, but not truly monotheistic in the strictest sense. Although some later philosophers, such as Antisthenes, believed in doctrines similar to those expounded by Xenophanes, his ideas do not appear to have become widely popular.\nAlthough Plato himself was a polytheist, in his writings, he often presents Socrates as speaking of \"the god\" in the singular form. He does, however, often speak of the gods in the plural form as well. The Euthyphro dilemma, for example, is formulated as \"Is that which is holy loved by the gods because it is holy, or is it holy because it is loved by the gods?\"\nHellenistic religion.\nThe development of pure (philosophical) monotheism is a product of the Late Antiquity. During the 2nd to 3rd centuries, early Christianity was just one of several competing religious movements advocating monotheism.\n\"The One\" () is a concept that is prominent in the writings of the Neoplatonists, especially those of the philosopher Plotinus. In the writings of Plotinus, \"The One\" is described as an inconceivable, transcendent, all-embodying, permanent, eternal, causative entity that permeates throughout all of existence.\nA number of oracles of Apollo from Didyma and Clarus, the so-called \"theological oracles\", dated to the 2nd and 3rd century CE, proclaim that there is only one highest god, of whom the gods of polytheistic religions are mere manifestations or servants. 4th century CE Cyprus had, besides Christianity, an apparently monotheistic cult of Dionysus.\nThe Hypsistarians were a religious group who believed in a most high god, according to Greek documents. Later revisions of this Hellenic religion were adjusted towards monotheism as it gained consideration among a wider populace. The worship of Zeus as the head-god signaled a trend in the direction of monotheism, with less honour paid to the fragmented powers of the lesser gods.\nOceania.\nAboriginal Australian religion.\nAboriginal Australians are typically described as polytheistic in nature. Although some researchers shy from referring to Dreamtime figures as \"gods\" or \"deities\", they are broadly described as such for the sake of simplicity.\nIn Southeastern Australian cultures, the sky father Baiame is perceived as the creator of the universe (though this role is sometimes taken by other gods like Yhi or Bunjil) and at least among the Gamilaraay traditionally revered above other mythical figures. Equation between him and the Christian god is common among both missionaries and modern Christian Aboriginals.\nThe Yolngu had extensive contact with the Makassans and adopted religious practises inspired by those of Islam. The god Walitha'walitha is based on Allah (specifically, with the \"wa-Ta'ala\" suffix), but while this deity had a role in funerary practises it is unclear if it was \"Allah-like\" in terms of functions.\nAndaman Islands.\nThe religion of the Andamanese peoples has at times been described as \"animistic monotheism\", believing foremost in a single deity, P\u016bluga, who created the universe. However, P\u016bluga is not worshipped, and anthropomorphic personifications of natural phenomena are also known.\nCriticism.\nDavid Hume (1711\u20131776) said that monotheism is less pluralistic and thus less tolerant than polytheism, because monotheism stipulates that people pigeonhole their beliefs into one tenet. In the same vein, Auguste Comte said that \"Monotheism is irreconcilable with the existence in our nature of the instincts of benevolence\" because it compels followers to devote themselves to a single Creator. Mark S. Smith, an American biblical scholar and ancient historian, wrote that monotheism has been a \"totalizing discourse\", often co-opting all aspects of a social belief system, resulting in the exclusion of \"others\". Jacob Neusner suggests that \"the logic of monotheism ... yields little basis for tolerating other religions\".\nAncient monotheism is described as the instigator of violence in its early days because it inspired the Israelites to wage war upon the Canaanites who believed in multiple gods. Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan regarded monotheism as a cause of violence, saying: \"The intolerance of narrow monotheism is written in letters of blood across the history of man from the time when first the tribes of Israel burst into the land of Canaan. The worshippers of the one jealous God are egged on to aggressive wars against people of alien [beliefs and cultures]. They invoke divine sanction for the cruelties inflicted on the conquered. The spirit of old Israel is inherited by Christianity and Islam, and it might not be unreasonable to suggest that it would have been better for Western civilization if Greece had moulded it on this question rather than Palestine.\" Both Regina Schwartz and Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan do not present quantitative data demonstrating that polytheist states waged less aggressive and cruel wars. In addition, according to the academic consensus, the Israelites neither were monotheist at that stage, nor \"burst into Canaan.\"\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The name \u201cArt of Eight Limbs\u201d refers to the combined use of fists, elbows, knees and shins. Muay Thai became widespread internationally in the late 20th to 21st century, when Westernised practitioners from Thailand began competing in kickboxing and mixed-rules matches as well as matches under Muay Thai rules around the world. The professional league is governed by the Professional Boxing Association of Thailand, sanctioned by the Sports Authority of Thailand.\nMuay Thai is related to other martial art styles of the Indian cultural sphere such as Musti-yuddha, Muay Chaiya, Muay Boran, Muay Lao, Lethwei, Kun Khmer, Benjang and Tomoi. A practitioner of Muay Thai is known as a \"Nak Muay\". Western practitioners in Thailand are sometimes called \"Nak Muay Farang\", meaning \"foreign boxer\".\nEtymology.\nThe term \"Muay Thai\" is a Thai term that is a compound word made up of two basic words; \"muay\" and \"Thai\".\nThe term \"Muay Thai\" is successor of the term \"Ram Mut Ram Muay\" () since the reign of King Rama II (1809\u20131824), and has thus entered into the global vocabulary.\nThe oldest text of the term \"Muay\" ever recorded is found in the palm-leaf manuscripts in Northern Thai language called \"Mungrai Law 1839 BE\", enacted 1296 AD. The pronunciation of the word \"Muay\" existed in Thai people since prior Nanzhao period (738\u2013902 AD) said in \"The History of Muay Thai\" by The Institute of the Art of Muay Thai, Department of Physical Education National Stadium of Thailand (DPE).\nThe historical term \"Tha Nai Lueak\" (, ), meaning \"Nak Muay for the King's guard, the name of division to be in charge of Nak Muay.\" The term was adopted in \"the Law of the Military and Provincial Hierarchy 1998 BE\" since 1455, during the reign of King Borommatrailokkanat, and repealed during the reign (1851\u20131868) of King Mongkut.\nVariant names.\nThe term \"Muay Thai\" is also written in various languages, including , , , , , , and .\nHistory.\n7th century.\nThe earliest origin of Muay Thai dates back to the 657 AD Haripu\u00f1jaya period of a hermit named \"Sukatanata\" who established his school of liberal and martial arts consisting of Muay Thai, which will be mentioned in order of history compiled officially by The Institute of the Art of Muay Thai, Department of Physical Education National Stadium of Thailand (DPE).\nFrom 738 AD in the Nanzhao period. Muay Thai had been trained from variant movements of dance; \"Fon jerng\" or \"jerng\" means \"tactics\" or \"finesse\", () included weapons and bare hands, showing the art of men's fighting, which is similar to Lei tai due to the war engagement with China for a long time. It is said to be the earliest stage of Thai people forming, and Muay Thai had been training for generations along the \"Fon jerng\" dance. The \"Fon jerng\" also became one of the recreational Thai classical dances in Northern Thailand, existing nowadays.\n10th century.\nAfter the Northern Tai people, led by King Lavachakkaraj, who ruled the town of Fang () (now Uttaradit province, Thailand), founded the Singhanavati Kingdom, known as Yonoknakhon (757\u20131188), they continued to expand their territory by seizing and establishing kingdoms, such as the Lan Na Kingdom, Phayao Kingdom, Haripu\u00f1jaya, and Lampang.\nFrom 947 AD onward, they conquered various ethnic groups, including the Khom ethnic groups, aboriginal Siamese (known as Siam-asli, Saimi-mandala, Siamese Lavo, Xi\u0101n, or Siam at that time), and Mon-Khmer in the upper part of the Chao Phraya River basin, using their martial arts skills (Muay). The Tai people then moved down northwest and successfully established the Sukhothai Kingdom (1238\u20131438) under the rule of King Si Inthrathit, who was a descendant of King Phrom, a descendant of the Singhanavati Dynasty (King Lavachakkaraj). This is mentioned in the folklore, \"the Legend of Singhanavati\".\nThe \"Mungrai Customary Law 1296 CE\" (Mungraiyashastra), one of the oldest palm-leaf manuscripts written in the Northern Thai language during the reign of King Mangrai, who established the town of Chiang Mai (1292\u20131311), also mentioned the Tai martial arts (Muay) in section 7, under the article of 18 types of quarrels, for the first time in the Lan Na Kingdom. In the folklore, \"the Legend of the Phayao Kingdom\" (1094\u20131338), the version by Wat Sriboonrueng mentioned the Tai martial arts (Muay) known as \"jerng tiw khui\" during the reign of King Chueang Maharat (1115\u20131162).\n13th century.\nDuring the Pre-Ayutthaya era (Ayodhya period) before 1351, the \"Royal Chronicle of the North\" documented King Uthong's importation of Muay boxers from the city of Sri Phalo (now Chonburi province, Thailand) to the city-state of Ayodhya. This occurred during his reign from 1253 to 1289, and a Muay boxing match between a Siamese boxer and a Chinese boxer also took place during the late reign of King Suwanracha, who ruled Ayodhya from 1301 to 1310. Furthermore, the Siam-Thai of Ayutthaya (known as Gywan and Siam-Asli) launched an attack on the Thaton kingdom in 1056 CE. They expanded their territory southward and used their martial arts skills (Muay) to penetrate deep into the Malay Peninsula before 1160 CE. These events are recorded in various historical sources, including the Burmese chronicle, \"Hmannan Yazawin\", the \"Malay annals\" (Sulalatus Salatin), and the \"History of the Malay Kingdom of Patani\" (Sejarah Kerajaan Melayu Patani).\nDuring the Sukhothai Kingdom from 1238 to 1268, Muay Thai was highly regarded as an art form and was even included in the curriculum for members of the royal family. It was seen as a way to train brave warriors with exceptional physical fitness, as well as prepare them for leadership and warfare against neighboring kingdoms. King Si Inthrathit sent his second son, aged 13, Prince Ram Khamhaeng, to study Dharma, liberal arts, and martial arts (Muay) at the Samo Khon School in Lawapura town (now Lopburi province, Thailand), Lavo Kingdom. It was here that Prince Ram Khamhaeng formed a close bond with Prince Ngam Mueang, who would later become the King of Phayao Kingdom in 1258, as mentioned in the \"Yonok Chronicles\":\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nThe Samo Khon school was founded in 657 AD during the Haripu\u00f1jaya period by a hermit named Sukatanata (). He taught a variety of subjects, collectively known as \"Maiya Shastra\" (\u0cae\u0cc8\u0cb6\u0cbe\u0cb8\u0ccd\u0ca4\u0ccd\u0cb0), which included martial arts (Muay), sword fighting, archery, and elephant and horse control. One of the most notable alumni of the school was King Mangrai. The Hermitage of Sukatanata still exists today and can be accessed at Wat Khao Samo Khon in Lopburi province, Thailand.\nKing Ram Khamhaeng also composed a war strategy manual during his reign that also mentioned Muay Thai. Later, King Maha Thammaracha I was trained in essential subjects as well as practical skills, including martial arts (Muay) for self-defense with bare hands and the use of weapons. Muay Thai was also taught at temples, which served as learning centers for the Tai peoples, following the guidelines of King Ram Khamhaeng's war strategy manual.\n15th century.\nIn 1431 AD, King Borommarachathirat II, the King of Ayutthaya Kingdom, led Siamese forces and included groups of Siamese boxers to assault the Khmers plundering Angkor Thom, also known as the Fall of Angkor in 1431. King Borommarachathirat II built an inscription of Khun Sri Chaiya Raj Mongkol Thep for the victory monument and Siamese warriors' commemoration, which inscribed a list of Siamese warriors and assault record in the inscription after the Angkor had already been captured, as well as written in \"A Lost Chronicle of Ayutthaya\" by Michael Vickery, stanzas 9\u201311.\nThe inscription of Khun Sri Chaiya Raj Mongkol Thep (N.M. 78, Face 2) 1431 AD reads:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFrom 1455 AD in the Ayutthaya period, Muay Thai was officially integrated with Siamese royal courts of Ayutthaya called The King's Guard Department () since the reign of King Borommatrailokkanat enacted the Law of the Military and Provincial Hierarchy 1998 BE (1455 AD), which consisted of two director generals with noble titles, Khun Phakdeeasa () and Khun Yothaphakdee () in the hierarchy. There were countless skilled Siamese boxers in The King's Unarmed Guard Division (), a sub-division of The King's Guard Department, picked from competition by the king to be his private guards and patrol the royal palace as major missions. The boxing competitions occur in peace situations as well as to safeguard the king at war.\nThere was also the law mentioned of Muay in the reign of King Ekathotsarot (1590\u20131605), called Miscellaneous Laws (Phra Aiyakan Betset), which states:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nThe well-known Siamese boxers during the Ayutthaya period include King Naresuan, King Suriyenthrathibodi, and Nai Khanom Tom.\n16th century.\nAccording to history, Muay Thai had been developed by the Siamese army as a form of self-defense and to date back at least to the 13th century, according to King Ram Khamhaeng's war strategics manual. In Ayutthaya Kingdom, the war strategics manual was recomposed in 1518 by King Ramathibodi II called \"Tamra Phichaisongkram\" ().\nKing Naresuan practiced martial arts and rearranged his soldiers for 15 years at peacetime. He had learned warrior fighting techniques from Burmese royal courts after he was raised on his age 9 by King Bayinnaung for 6 years in Burma after the invasion by Bayinnaung's army to Ayutthaya Kingdom in the Burmese\u2013Siamese War (1563\u20131564). King Naresuan also improved the war strategics manual version of King Ramathibodi II to the version of King Naresuan after he was backed to Ayutthaya Kingdom to be capable of self-defense in war engagements during his reign.\nIn 1687, Simon de la Loub\u00e8re, a French diplomat to Siam of King Louis XIV, handwrote that Muay Thai was one of the occupations of Siamese people in his famous book, \"Du Royaume de Siam\", during the reign of King Narai, which reads:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\n(Translation): Hot weather weakened the Siamese people to be tired. Wrestling and fighting with fists or elbows (Muay Thai) were just their occupations. Thence, paddling courses were only their exercises.\nIn 1698, according to the second French mission to Siam by King Louis XIV, who after appointed Guy Tachard to be in charge of the French ambassador to Siam. Muay Thai was being trained to prepare for an engagement with a French expeditionary force after the Dutch captain informed the Siamese Royal Court of the news about French battleships to siege Puducherry and Myeik seaports of the Kingdom of Ayutthaya in the reign of King Phetracha after the Siamese revolution of 1688.\n\"Monsieur Braud's letter to Directors of the International Affairs Kingdom of Ayutthaya (June 9, 1699)\" reads:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\n18th century.\nIn the 1702 reign of King Suriyenthrathibodi. The king questioned his vassals about the Siamese people festival held outside the boundary of Ayutthaya Royal Palace. The government official responded to the king that the temple fair will be held at Khwaeng Wiset Chai Chan (now Ang Thong province, Thailand). Tomorrow, there are Buddhist monastery celebrations, grand competitions, and amusements. King Suriyenthrathibodi then responded back that he had not punched Muay boxing for a long time since enthroned, and he decided to join Muay boxing competitions tomorrow.\nOn the next festival day, King Suriyenthrathibodi disguised himself as the general public with a few royal police and went to the festival by boat to join the Muay boxing competitions, and he won both the first and second matches during the competition, as the \"Royal Chronicle of the Kingdom of Ayutthaya\" reads:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nThe \"Royal Chronicle of the Kingdom of Rattanakosin: First Reign\", documents the arrival of two French boxing brothers in Bangkok in 1788. They had come to compete in a boxing match for a monetary prize. Seeking to compete with a Siamese boxer, they enlisted the help of an interpreter to convey their request to a Siamese nobleman, Chaophraya Phra Khlang (Hon). This nobleman then brought the matter to the attention of King Rama I. The King, in turn, consulted with his younger brother, Prince Maha Sura Singhanat of the Front Palace, and made a plea:\nSince the foreigners have made a challenge, it would be considered an insult if we did not come up with Thai boxers to compete against them. It would be said that no Thais in all the capital could fight. Our reputation would suffer. The dishonor would spread abroad. I beg you to find a Thai boxer skillful enough to inflict a resounding defeat.\nKing Rama I accepted his brother's advice and asked a nobleman to inform the Frenchmen that a match would be arranged with a purse of fifty Chang (equivalent to 4,000 baht at the time). Prince Maha Sura Singhanat personally supervised the construction of a suitable arena and prepared the Siamese boxer.\nOn the day of the boxing competition, King Rama I, his younger brother, and many members of the Siamese royal court were present as spectators near the western theater of Wat Phra Kaew. Prince Maha Sura Singhanat arranged for a Siamese boxer from the Front Palace King's Guard Department named Muean Phlan to compete against the younger of the French brothers. During the match, Muean Phlan constantly evaded his opponent, making it difficult for the younger French brother to get a hold of him. As the elder French brother rushed to assist his younger sibling, Prince Maha Sura Singhanat also joined the fight and knocked the elder brother down. All the umpires rushed to help the Siamese boxer, and the Frenchmen were treated harshly. After Rama I had the two French brothers receive physical therapy, they soon departed.\nFolklore of Nai Khanom Tom.\nAccording to the popular folklore story, in 1767, after the second fall of Ayutthaya Kingdom from the Burmese\u2013Siamese War (1765\u20131767), the invading Burmese troops rounded up thousands of Siamese citizens and brought to Burma. They then organized a seven-day, seven-night religious festival in honor of Buddha's relics. The festivities included many forms of entertainment, such as costume plays, comedies, and sword-fighting matches. King Hsinbyushin wanted to see how Thai fighters would compare to his fighters. Nai Khanom Tom was selected to fight against the King's chosen champion, and the boxing ring was set up in front of the throne. When the fight began, Nai Khanom Tom charged out, using punches, kicks, elbows, and knees to pummel his opponent until he collapsed.The King supposedly asked if Nai Khanom Tom would fight nine other Burmese champions to prove himself. He agreed and fought one after the other with no rest periods. His last opponent was a great kickboxing teacher from Rakhine State whom Nai Khanom Tom defeated with kicks.\nIt had been said that King Hsinbyushin was allegedly so impressed that he remarked in \"The Royal Chronicle of the Kingdom of Ayutthaya\":\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\"While King Hsinbyushin of Burma was residing at Yangon to raise an umbrella crown of the Shwedagon Pagoda for celebration, a Burmese nobleman informed him of a Siamese-skilled muay thai man. The King then stated a royal order to arrange for a Siamese man named Nai Khanom Tom, a famous fighter from Ayutthaya, to confront a Burmese boxer in front of the throne. The first round, the latter collapsed by Nai Khanom Tom, and the other round he confronted nine and ten other Burmese boxers. King Hsinbyushin was applauding him and said that Siamese was in a dangerous situation, but he could confront opponents up to nine and ten while unarmed. Because of King of Ayutthaya's negligent behavior that caused the aftermath of Ayutthaya Kingdom, the kingdom could stay if he's good. King Hsinbyushin then royally rewarded Nai Khanom Tom as should.\"\nThis historiography was largely extrapolated from brief mentions in written records, including four episodes in the royal chronicles of the 18th century: one where King Sanphet VIII fought an incognito match at a temple fair, Khwaeng Mueang Wiset Chai Chan in 1702; one where Nai Khanom Tom, as a war captive following the fall of Ayutthaya, fought in front of the Burmese king and defeated ten Burmese fighters; one of the military commander Phraya Phichai Dap Hak, who in his youth was a Muay Thai fighter; and one of Muen Phlan, who was chosen by King Rama I to fight against two French challengers in 1788.\nTo commemorate the story of Nai Khanom Tom, the Muay Thai Festival and Wai Khru Muay Thai Ceremony are staged annually every year on March 17 as \"Muay Thai Day\" in Thailand.\nThe popular folklore story of Nai Khanom Tom is widely celebrated in Thailand and around the world and the character is referred as the \"father of Muay Thai.\" Several scholars have critically examined the legend of Nai Khanom Tom, suggesting it is mythological rather than historical. Scholars suggest that the story of Nai Khanom Tom probably emerged in the 20th century, coinciding with efforts by Thai cultural institutions to construct a cohesive national identity. During the post-World War II era, figures like Luang Wichitwathakan played pivotal roles in promoting Thai nationalism, often through the creation and dissemination of cultural myths. The legend of Nai Khanom Tom serves as a case study in the invention of tradition, where folklore is utilized to foster national unity and cultural continuity.\nIn his book \"Muay Thai: Inventing Tradition for a National Symbol\", Peter Vail argues that the story has been used to construct Thai national identity and serves more as a cultural symbol than a verifiable historical account. Similarly, historian Craig J. Reynolds, in his 1991 book \"National Identity and Its Defenders: Thailand, 1939\u20131989\", discusses how Thai historical narratives were shaped in the post-World War II era to promote national unity, including the elevation of figures like Nai Khanom Tom without historical documentation. Scholars emphasize the lack of contemporary sources and suggest the legend likely emerged or was amplified during Thailand\u2019s modern nation-building period.\n19th century.\nThe ascension of King Chulalongkorn (Rama V) to the throne in 1868 ushered in a golden age not only for Muay but for the whole country of Thailand. Muay progressed greatly during the reign of Rama V as a direct result of the king's personal interest in the sport. The country was at peace and Muay functioned as a means of physical exercise, self-defense, attacking, recreation and personal advancement.\nTo increase interest in Muay Thai, King Chulalongkorn implemented nationwide tournaments and established a Royal Boxing Center, known as Muay Luang or Royal Boxers, similar to the Muay Fighters Regiment during the Ayutthaya Period, to administer the training of both Muay Thai and Krabi\u2013krabong. He also bestowed the title of Muen, a Thai nobility rank, to the victor of each match. In 1887, the Department of Education (now the Department of Physical Education, Ministry of Tourism and Sports (Thailand)) was established by King Chulalongkorn, with Muay Thai being included as a subject in the national curriculum for both physical education teacher training schools and the Chulachomklao Royal Military Academy (CRMA).\n20th century.\nModern Muay Thai arose from the local form of bare-hand fighting historically known simply as \"muay\", and became recognized as a distinct martial art form in the early 20th century, when the term \"Muay Thai\" ('Siamese boxing' in English) was introduced in physical education curricular documents to distinguish it from international boxing (\"muay sakon\" in Thai).\nThe officially recognized history of Muay Thai was largely codified in the late 20th century, when the sport gained widespread popularity and became recognized as a national sport and cultural heritage. The term Muay Boran was coined to describe the pre-modern historical martial art form of Muay Thai, and they came to symbolize a warrior spirit seen as a core component of Thainess.\nIn 1910, the King requested \"muay\" fighters from outlying provinces to fight matches at the funeral of his son Prince Urubongse Rajasombhoj, and granted the noble rank of \"Muen\" to the three best fighters, who were from Lopburi, Khorat and Chaiya. These would later become codified as regional styles of Muay Boran.\n1913: British boxing was introduced into the curriculum of the Suan Kulap College. The first descriptive use of the term \"Muay Thai\".\nFrom 1914 to 1918 during World War I, Thailand sent troops to fight with its allies in France. They taught people there Muay Thai, and later Thai boxing spread to others and became known internationally, so the word of \"Muay Thai\" had reached Europe by this time. A French magazine, \"Le Sport Orient\", published in Mainz, observed:\nThai boxing is astounding but hard to get to see. The boxers are agile, strong, and tough. This sport is not just a thrilling, strange, and extraordinary form of entertainment. Once again, it makes the French feel that Siam is one of the truly remarkable nations of Asia.\n1919: British boxing and Muay Thai were taught as one sport in the curriculum of the Suan Kulap College. Judo was also offered.\n1921: First permanent ring in Siam at Suan Kulap College. Used for both muay and British boxing.\n1923: Suan Sanuk Stadium. First international style three-rope ring with red and blue padded corners, near Lumpinee Park. Muay and British boxing.\nKing Rama VII (r. 1925\u20131935) pushed for codified rules for Muay and they were put into place. Thailand's first boxing ring was built in 1921 at Suan Kulap. Referees were introduced and rounds were now timed by kick. Fighters at the Lumpinee Boxing Stadium began wearing modern gloves, as well as hard groin protectors, during training and in boxing matches against foreigners. Traditional rope-binding (\"Khat Chueak\") made the hands a hardened, dangerous striking tool. The use of knots in the rope over the knuckles made the strikes more abrasive and damaging for the opponent while protecting the hands of the fighter. This rope-binding was still used in fights between Thais but after a death in the ring, it was decided that fighters should wear gloves and cotton coverlets over the feet and ankles. It was also around this time that the term \"Muay Thai\" became commonly used, while the older form of the style came to be known as \"Muay Boran\", which is now performed primarily as an exhibition art form.\nOn October 29, 1970. King Bhumibol Adulyadej gave his speech to the Muay Thai Fund Raising Organizing Committee in support of Thai boxers on behalf of the Anandamahidol Foundation states:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nMuay Thai was at the height of its popularity in the 1980s and 1990s. Top fighters commanded purses of up to 200,000 Baht and the stadia where gambling was legal drew big gates and big advertising revenues. In 2016, a payout to a superstar fighter was about 100,000 Baht per fight, but can range as high as 540,000 Baht for a bout.\nIn 1993, the International Federation of Muay Thai Amateur, or IFMA was inaugurated. It became the governing body of amateur Muay Thai consisting of 128 member countries worldwide and is recognised by the Olympic Council of Asia.\nIn 1995, the World Muaythai Council, the oldest and largest professional sanctioning organisations of muay Thai, was established by the Thai government and sanctioned by the Sports Authority of Thailand.\nIn 1995, the World Muay Thai Federation was founded by the merger of two existing organisations, and established in Bangkok, becoming the federation governing international Muay Thai. In August 2012, it had over 70 member countries. Its president is elected at the World Muay Thai Congress.\n21st century.\nIn 2006, Muay Thai was included in SportAccord with IFMA. One of the requirements of SportAccord was that no sport can have a name of a country in its name. As a result, an amendment was made in the IFMA constitution to change the name of the sport from \"Muay Thai\" to \"Muaythai\" \u2013 written as one word in accordance with Olympic requirements.\nIn 2014, Muay Thai was included in the International World Games Association (IWGA) and was represented in the official programme of The World Games 2017 in Wroc\u0142aw, Poland.\nIn January 2015, Muay Thai was granted the patronage of the International University Sports Federation (FISU) and, from 16 to 23 March 2015, the first University World Muaythai Cup was held in Bangkok.\nIn 2020, there are more than 3,800 Thai boxing gyms overseas.\nRules.\nAccording to IFMA rules, Muay Thai is a full contact martial art that uses the fists, elbows, knees and feet to strike an opponent. For a strike to count as a point score, it has to connect without being blocked by your opponent. Strikes do not score if they connect with your opponent's glove, forearm, shin or foot. Strikes to the groin were allowed in Muay Thai boxing until the late 1980s, and are still permitted in Thailand itself, and in club or competition events that abide to the traditional rules. While competitors do wear groin protection, such as cups, the rules for club level sparring and competition events may vary regarding the protective gear that may or may not be worn. Mixed-sex fights are not practiced at international level, but do occur in club and inter-club sparring and competition events. If the fight goes the distance and both fighters finish with the same score, then the winner is determined by which fighter landed the most full contact blows.\nOlympics.\nTimeline of International Federation of Muaythai Associations (IFMA) from founding to International Olympic Committee (IOC) recognition:\nTraditional wear.\nThe \"mongkhon\", or \"mongkol\" (headband), and \"pra jiad\" (armbands) are often worn into the ring before the match begins. They originated when Siam was in a constant state of war. Young men would tear off pieces of a loved one's clothing (often a mother's \"sarong\") and wear it in battle for good luck as well as to ward off harmful spirits. In modern times, the \"mongkol\" (lit. \"holy spirit\", \"luck\", \"protection\") is worn as a tribute to the fighter's gym. The \"mongkol\" is traditionally presented by a trainer to the fighter when he judges that the fighter is ready to represent the gym in the ring. Often, after the fighter has finished the \"wai kru\", the trainer will take the \"mongkol\" off his head and place it in his corner of the ring for luck. They were also used for protection. Whether the fighter is a Buddhist or not, it is common for them to bring the \"mongkol\" to a Buddhist monk who blesses it for good luck prior to stepping into the ring.\nTechniques.\nFormal Muay Thai techniques are divided into two groups: \"mae mai\" (\u0e41\u0e21\u0e48\u0e44\u0e21\u0e49), or \"major techniques\", and \"luk mai\" (\u0e25\u0e39\u0e01\u0e44\u0e21\u0e49), or \"minor techniques\". Muay Thai is often a fighting art of attrition, where opponents exchange blows with one another. This is certainly the case with traditional stylists in Thailand, but is a less popular form of fighting in the contemporary world fighting circuit where the Thai style of exchanging blow for blow is no longer favorable. Almost all techniques in Muay Thai use the entire body movement, rotating the hip with each kick, punch, elbow and block.\nPunching (\"Muay Mat\").\nThe punch techniques in Muay Thai were originally quite limited, being crosses and a long (or lazy) circular strike made with a straight (but not locked) arm and landing with the heel of the palm. Cross-fertilisation with Western boxing and Western martial arts mean the full range of western boxing punches are now used: lead jab, straight/cross, hook, uppercut, shovel and corkscrew punches and overhands, as well as hammer fists and back fists.\nAs a tactic, body punching is used less in Muay Thai than most other striking combat sports to avoid exposing the attacker's head to counter strikes from knees or elbows. To utilize the range of targeting points, in keeping with the centre line theory, the fighter can use either the Western or Thai stance which allows for either long range or short range attacks to be undertaken effectively without compromising guard.\nElbow (\"sok\").\nThe elbow can be used in several ways as a striking weapon: horizontal, diagonal-upwards, diagonal-downwards, uppercut, downward, backward-spinning, and flying. From the side, it can be used as either a finishing move or as a way to cut the opponent's eyebrow so that blood might block his vision. The diagonal elbows are faster than the other forms but are less powerful. The elbow strike is considered the most dangerous form of attack in the sport.\nThere is a distinct difference between a single elbow and a follow-up elbow. The single elbow is a move independent from any other, whereas a follow-up elbow is the second strike from the same arm, being a hook or straight punch first with an elbow follow-up. Such elbows, and most other elbow strikes, are used when the distance between fighters becomes too small and there is too little space to throw a hook at the opponent's head.\nElbows can be used to great effect as blocks or defences against, for example, spring knees, side body knees, body kicks or punches. When well connected, an elbow strike can cause serious damage to the opponent, including cuts or even a knockout.\nKicking (\"te\").\nThe two most common kicks in Muay Thai are known as the \"thip\" (literally \"foot jab\") and the \"te chiang\" (kicking upwards in the shape of a triangle cutting under the arm and ribs), or roundhouse kick. The Thai roundhouse kick uses a rotational movement of the entire body and has been widely adopted by practitioners of other combat sports. It is done from a circular stance with the back leg just a little ways back (roughly shoulder width apart) in comparison to instinctive upper body fighting (boxing) where the legs must create a wider base. The roundhouse kick draws its power almost entirely from the rotational movement of the hips, counter-rotation of the shoulders and arms are also often used to add torque to the lower body and increase the power of the kick as well.\nIf a roundhouse kick is attempted by the opponent, the Thai boxer will normally check the kick, that is, he will block the kick with the outside of his lower leg. Thai boxers are trained to always connect with the shin. The foot contains many fine bones and is much weaker. A fighter may end up hurting himself if he tries to strike with his foot or instep. Shins are trained by repeatedly striking firm objects, such as pads or heavy bags.\nKnee (\"ti khao\").\nSource:\nFoot-thrust (\"teep\").\nThe foot-thrust, or literally, \"foot jab\", is one of the techniques in Muay Thai. It is mainly used as a defensive technique to control distance or block attacks. Foot-thrusts should be thrown quickly but with enough force to knock an opponent off balance.\nClinch and neck wrestling (\"chap kho\").\nIn Western boxing, the two fighters are separated when they clinch; in muay Thai, however, they are not. It is often in the clinch that knee and elbow techniques are used. To strike and bind the opponent for both offensive and defensive purposes, small amounts of stand-up grappling are used in the clinch. The front clinch should be performed with the palm of one hand on the back of the other. There are three reasons why the fingers must not be intertwined. 1) In the ring fighters are wearing boxing gloves and cannot intertwine their fingers. 2) The Thai front clinch involves pressing the head of the opponent downwards, which is easier if the hands are locked behind the back of the head instead of behind the neck. Furthermore, the arms should be putting as much pressure on the neck as possible. 3) A fighter may incur an injury to one or more fingers if they are intertwined, and it becomes more difficult to release the grip in order to quickly elbow the opponent's head.\nA correct clinch also involves the fighter's forearms pressing against the opponent's collar bone while the hands are around the opponent's head rather than the opponent's neck. The general way to get out of a clinch is to push the opponent's head backward or elbow them, as the clinch requires both participants to be very close to one another. Additionally, the non-dominant clincher can try to \"swim\" their arm underneath and inside the opponent's clinch, establishing the previously non-dominant clincher as the dominant clincher.\nMuay Thai has several other variants of the clinch or \"chap kho\" , including:\nDefence against attacks.\nDefences in muay Thai are categorised in six groups:\nDefences in practice.\nDefensively, the concept of \"wall of defence\" is used, in which shoulders, arms and legs are used to hinder the attacker from successfully executing techniques. Blocking is a critical element in muay Thai and compounds the level of conditioning a successful practitioner must possess. Low and mid body roundhouse kicks are normally blocked with the upper portion of a raised shin (this block is known as a \"check\"). High body strikes are blocked ideally with the forearms and shoulder together, or if enough time is allowed for a parry, the glove (elusively), elbow, or shin will be used. Midsection roundhouse kicks can also be caught/trapped, allowing for a sweep or counter-attack to the remaining leg of the opponent. Punches are blocked with an ordinary boxing guard and techniques similar, if not identical, to basic boxing technique. A common means of blocking a punch is using the hand on the same side as the oncoming punch. For example, if an orthodox fighter throws a jab (being the left hand), the defender will make a slight tap to redirect the punch's angle with the right hand. The deflection is always as small and precise as possible to avoid unnecessary energy expenditure and return the hand to the guard as quickly as possible. Hooks are often blocked with a motion sometimes described as \"combing the hair\", that is, raising the elbow forward and effectively shielding the head with the forearm, flexed biceps and shoulder. More advanced muay Thai blocks are usually in the form of counter-strikes, using the opponent's weight (as they strike) to amplify the damage that the countering opponent can deliver. This requires impeccable timing and thus can generally only be learned by many repetitions.\nChild boxers.\nIn 2016, 9,998 children under the age of 15 were registered with Board of Boxing under the Sport Authority of Thailand, according to the Child Safety Promotion and Injury Prevention Research Centre (CSIP). Some estimates put the number of child boxers nationwide at between 200,000 and 300,000, some as young as four years old.\nThe Advanced Diagnostic Imaging Centre (AIMC) at Ramathibodi Hospital studied 300 child boxers aged under 15 with two to more than five years of experience, as well as 200 children who do not box. The findings show that child boxers not only sustain brain injuries, they also have a lower IQ, about 10 points lower than average levels. Moreover, IQ levels correlate with the length of their training. Beyond brain damage, the death of young fighters in the ring sometimes occurs.\nAdisak Plitapolkarnpim, director of CSIP, was indirectly quoted (in 2016) as having said that muay Thai practitioners \"younger than 15 years old are being urged to avoid 'head contact' to reduce the risk of brain injuries, while children aged under nine should be banned from the combat fight\"; furthermore, the Boxing Act's minimum age to compete professionally was largely being flouted; furthermore, quoted indirectly, \"Boxers aged between 13 and 15\" should still be permitted to compete, but \"with light contact to the head and face\". He said that \"spectators and a change in the boxing rules can play a vital role in preventing child boxers from suffering brain injuries, abnormality in brain structure, Parkinson's disease and early-onset Alzheimer's later in life...Children aged between nine and 15 can take part in [Thai] boxing, but direct head contact must not be allowed\". Referring to \"Findings [of 2014] on the Worst Forms of Child Labour\" as published by the US Department of Labor's Bureau of International Labor Affairs, he said, \"We know Muay Thai paid fighters have been exploited in the past like child labourers and the matter still remains a serious concern.\"\nAt the 13th World Conference on Injury Prevention and Safety Promotion in 2018, it was revealed that up to three percent of the upcoming generation will grow up with learning disabilities unless an amendment is ratified that bans children under 12 from participating in boxing matches. International pediatricians have called on lawmakers in Thailand to help.\nInjuries.\nMuay Thai is a combat sport that utilises eight different parts of the body (fists, elbows, knees and shins) so injuries are quite common in all levels of muay Thai. An injury is considered reportable if it requires the athlete to rest for more than one day. Many injuries in the sport go unreported as the fighters may not notice the injuries at first, refuse to admit that they need treatment, have a heightened pain threshold, fear that their instructor will perceive the injury negatively, or have confusion as to what is an injury. Similar to most sports, injury rates tend to be higher in beginners than amateurs and professionals. Soft tissue injuries are the most common form of injury in muay Thai, comprising between 80 and 90% of all injuries. These injuries are caused by repeated trauma to soft parts of the body. During matches there is little to no padding, leaving soft tissue vulnerable to strikes. The second most common injuries among beginners and amateurs are sprains and strains. It appears that these injuries can be easily avoided or reduced. Many participants of a study admitted to inadequate warm up before the event of the injury. The third most common injuries are fractures. Fractures are more commonly seen with amateur and professional fighters, because they are allowed full contact, while beginners are not. The most common sites for fractures are the nose, carpal bones, metacarpals, digits and ribs. The distribution of injuries differs significantly for beginners, amateurs and professionals, because as a fighter progresses through the different levels, the forces involved grow progressively higher, less padding and protective equipment is used, and athletes are likely to train harder, resulting in more serious injuries among experienced fighters.\nGambling.\nAccording to a \"Bangkok Post\" columnist, \"...Thai professional boxing is all about gambling and big money. Gambling on muay Thai boxing is estimated to worth about 40 billion baht a year...all the talk about the promotion of Thai martial arts is just baloney.\" Rob Cox, the manager of a boxing camp just east of Bangkok claims that \"Without the gamblers, the sport would pretty much be dead. They're killing it off, but they're also keeping it alive\".\nThe practice of fixing fights is not unknown. Boxers can earn from 60,000 to 150,000 baht for purposefully losing a fight. A fighter, later arrested, who threw a fight at Rajadamnern Stadium in December 2019, is an example. An infamous alleged case of match-fixing was the bout on 12 October 2014 in Pattaya between top Thai boxer Buakaw Banchamek and his challenger, Enriko Kehl, at the K-1 World Max Final event.\nConditioning.\nLike most full contact fighting sports, muay Thai has a heavy focus on body conditioning. This can create a steep learning curve for newcomers to muay Thai but allows for rapid increases in fitness and stamina provided one avoids overtraining. Training regimens include many staples of combat sport conditioning such as running, shadowboxing, rope jumping, body weight resistance exercises, medicine ball exercises, abdominal exercises and, in some cases, weight training. Thai boxers rely heavily on kicks utilising the shin bone. As such, practitioners will repeatedly hit a dense heavy bag with their shins, conditioning it, hardening the bone through a process called cortical remodelling. Striking a sand-filled bag will have the same effect.\nTraining specific to a Thai fighter includes training with coaches on Thai pads, focus mitts, heavy bag, and sparring. Daily training includes many rounds (3\u20135 minute periods broken up by a short rest, often 1\u20132 minutes) of these various methods of practice. Thai pad training is a cornerstone of muay Thai conditioning that involves practicing punches, kicks, knees, and elbow strikes with a trainer wearing thick pads covering the forearms and hands. These special pads (often referred to as Thai pads) are used to absorb the impact of the fighter's strikes and allow the fighter to react to the attacks of the pad holder in a live situation. The trainer will often also wear a belly pad around the abdominal area so that the fighter can attack with straight kicks or knees to the body at any time during the round.\nFocus mitts are specific to training a fighter's hand speed, punch combinations, timing, punching power, defence and counter-punching and may also be used to practice elbow strikes. Heavy bag training is a conditioning and power exercise that reinforces the techniques practiced on the pads. Sparring is a means to test technique, skills, range, strategy and timing against a partner. Sparring is often a light to medium contact exercise because competitive fighters on a full schedule are not advised to risk injury by sparring hard. Specific tactics and strategies can be trained with sparring including in close fighting, clinching and kneeing only, cutting off the ring, or using reach and distance to keep an aggressive fighter away.\nDue to the rigorous training regimen (some Thai boxers fight almost every other week), professional boxers in Thailand have relatively short careers in the ring. Many retire from competition to begin instructing the next generation of Thai fighters. Most professional Thai boxers come from lower economic backgrounds, and the purse (after other parties have their cut) is sought as a means of support for the fighters and their families. Very few higher economic strata Thais join the professional muay Thai ranks; they usually either do not practice the sport or practice it only as amateur boxers.\nPerspectives.\nScholars have described this royalist-nationalist history as an invented tradition, constructed to serve the needs of Thai nationalism at the time. This tradition has caused Muay Thai to become strongly attached to the official Thai cultural institution and separated from other similar and closely related martial arts in the region, including \"muay Lao\" in Laos, and \"lethwei\" in Myanmar.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
