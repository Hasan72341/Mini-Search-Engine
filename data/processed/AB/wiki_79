It is often referred to as an archetypal example of how complex, chaotic behaviour can arise from very simple nonlinear dynamical equations.\nThe map was initially utilized by Edward Lorenz in the 1960s to showcase properties of irregular solutions in climate systems. It was popularized in a 1976 paper by the biologist Robert May, in part as a discrete-time demographic model analogous to the logistic equation written down by Pierre Fran\u00e7ois Verhulst.\nOther researchers who have contributed to the study of the logistic map include Stanis\u0142aw Ulam, John von Neumann, Pekka Myrberg, Oleksandr Sharkovsky, Nicholas Metropolis, and Mitchell Feigenbaum.\nTwo introductory examples.\nDynamical Systems example.\nIn the logistic map, x is a variable, and r is a parameter. It is a map in the sense that it maps a configuration or phase space to itself (in this simple case the space is one dimensional in the variable x)\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Numbered block/styles.css\" /&gt;\nIt can be interpreted as a tool to get next position in the configuration space after one time step. The difference equation is a discrete version of the logistic differential equation, which can be compared to a time evolution equation of the system. \nGiven an appropriate value for the parameter r and performing calculations starting from an initial condition formula_1, we obtain the sequence formula_1, formula_3, formula_4, ... which can be interpreted as a sequence of time steps in the evolution of the system. \nIn the field of dynamical systems, this sequence is called an orbit, and the orbit changes depending on the value given to the parameter. When the parameter is changed, the orbit of the logistic map can change in various ways, such as settling on a single value, repeating several values periodically, or showing non-periodic fluctuations known as chaos.\nAnother way to understand this sequence is to iterate the logistic map (here represented by formula_5) to the initial state formula_1\nformula_7\nNow this is important given this was the initial approach of Henri Poincar\u00e9 to study dynamical systems and ultimately chaos starting from the study of fixed points or in other words states that do not change over time (i.e. when formula_8). Many chaotic systems such as the Mandelbrot set emerge from iteration of very simple quadratic nonlinear functions such as the logistic map.\nDemographic model example.\nTaking the biological population model as an example xn is a number between zero and one, which represents the ratio of existing population to the maximum possible population. \nThis nonlinear difference equation is intended to capture two effects:\nThe usual values of interest for the parameter r are those in the interval [0,\u00a04], so that xn remains bounded on [0,\u00a01]. The \"r\" \n 4 case of the logistic map is a nonlinear transformation of both the bit-shift map and the \"\u03bc\" \n 2 case of the tent map. If \"r\" &gt; 4, this leads to negative population sizes. (This problem does not appear in the older Ricker model, which also exhibits chaotic dynamics.) One can also consider values of r in the interval [\u22122,\u00a00], so that xn remains bounded on [\u22120.5,\u00a01.5].\nCharacterization of the logistic map.\nThe animation shows the behaviour of the sequence formula_9 over different values of the parameter r. A first observation is that the sequence does not diverge and remains finite for r between 0 and 4. It is possible to see the following qualitative phenomena in order of time: \nThe first four are also available in standard linear systems, oscillations between two values are available too under resonance, chaotic systems though have typically a large range of resonance conditions.\nThe other phenomena are peculiar to chaos. This progression of stages is strikingly similar to the onset of turbulence.\nChaos is not peculiar to non-linear systems alone and it can also be exhibited by infinite dimensional linear systems.\nAs mentioned above, the logistic map itself is an ordinary quadratic function. An important question in terms of dynamical systems is how the behavior of the trajectory changes when the parameter r changes. Depending on the value of r, the behavior of the trajectory of the logistic map can be simple or complex. Below, we will explain how the behavior of the logistic map changes as r increases.\nDomain, graphs and fixed points.\nAs mentioned above, the logistic map can be used as a model to consider the fluctuation of population size. In this case, the variable x of the logistic map is the number of individuals of an organism divided by the maximum population size, so the possible values of x are limited to 0 \u2264 x \u2264 1. For this reason, the behavior of the logistic map is often discussed by limiting the range of the variable to the interval [0, 1].\nIf we restrict the variables to 0 \u2264 x \u2264 1, then the range of the parameter r is necessarily restricted to 0 to 4 (0 \u2264 r \u2264 4). This is because if formula_9 is in the range [0, 1], then the maximum value of formula_11 is\nr/4. Thus, when r &gt; 4, the value of formula_12 can exceed 1. On the other hand, when r is negative, x can take negative values.\nA graph of the map can also be used to learn much about its behavior. The graph of the logistic map formula_13 is the plane curve that plots the relationship between formula_9 and formula_11, with formula_9 (or x) on the horizontal axis and formula_17 (or f (x)) on the vertical axis. The graph \u2009of the logistic map looks like this, except for the case r = 0:\nIt has the shape of a parabola with a vertex at \n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Numbered block/styles.css\" /&gt;\\right)}&lt;/math&gt;|2-1}} \nWhen r is changed, the vertex moves up or down, and the shape of the parabola changes. In addition, the parabola of the logistic map intersects with the horizontal axis (the line where formula_18) at two points. The two intersection points are formula_19 and formula_20, and the positions of these intersection points are constant and do not depend on the value of r.\nGraphs of maps, especially those of one variable such as the logistic map, are key to understanding the behavior of the map. One of the uses of graphs is to illustrate fixed points, called points. Draw a line y = x (a 45\u00b0 line) on the graph of the map. If there is a point where this 45\u00b0 line intersects with the graph, that point is a fixed point. In mathematical terms, a fixed point is\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Numbered block/styles.css\" /&gt; \nIt means a point that does not change when the map is applied. We will denote the fixed point as formula_21. In the case of the logistic map, the fixed point that satisfies equation (2-2) is obtained by solving formula_22.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Numbered block/styles.css\" /&gt;\n(except for r = 0). The concept of fixed points is of primary importance in discrete dynamical systems.\nAnother graphical technique that can be used for one-variable mappings is the spider web projection. After determining an initial value formula_1 on the horizontal axis, draw a vertical line from the initial value formula_1 to the curve of f(x). Draw a horizontal line from the \u2009point where the curve of f(x) meets the 45\u00b0 line of y = x, and then draw a vertical line from the point where the curve meets the 45\u00b0 line to the curve of f(x). By repeating this process, a spider web or staircase-like diagram is created on the plane. This construction is in fact equivalent to calculating the trajectory graphically, and the spider web diagram created represents the trajectory starting from formula_1. This projection allows the overall behavior of the trajectory to be seen at a glance.\nBehavior dependent on \"r\".\nThe image below shows the amplitude and frequency content of a logistic map that iterates itself for parameter values ranging from 2\u00a0to\u00a04. Again one can see initial linear behaviours then chaotic behaviour not only in the time domain (left) but especially in the frequency domain or spectrum (right), i.e. chaos is present at all scales as it is in the case of Energy cascade of Kolmogorov and it even propagates from one scale to another.\nBy varying the parameter r, the following behavior is observed:\nCase when 0 \u2264 r &lt; 1.\nFirst, when the parameter r = 0, formula_26, regardless of the initial value formula_1. In other words, the trajectory of the logistic map when a = 0 is a trajectory in which all values after the initial value are 0, so there is not much to investigate in this case.\nNext, when the parameter r is in the range 0 &lt; r &lt; 1, formula_9 decreases monotonically for any value of formula_1 between 0 and 1. That is, formula_9 converges to 0 in the limit n \u2192 \u221e. \n The point to which formula_9 converges is the fixed point formula_32 shown in equation (2-3). Fixed points of \u2009this type, where orbits around them converge, are called asymptotically stable, stable, or attractive. Conversely, if orbits around formula_21 move away from formula_21 as time n increases, the fixed point formula_21 is called unstable or repulsive. \nA common and simple way to know whether a fixed point is asymptotically stable is to take the derivative of the map f. This derivative is expressed as formula_36,\nformula_21 is asymptotically stable if the following condition is satisfied.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Numbered block/styles.css\" /&gt;\nWe can see this by graphing the map: if the slope of the tangent to the curve at formula_21 is between \u22121 and 1, then formula_21 is stable and the orbit around it is attracted to formula_21. The derivative of the logistic map is\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Numbered block/styles.css\" /&gt;\nTherefore, for x = 0 and 0 &lt; r &lt; 1, 0 &lt; f \u2009'(0) &lt; 1, so the fixed point formula_32 = 0 \u2009satisfies equation (3-1).\nHowever, the discrimination method using equation (3-1) does not know the range of orbits from formula_21 that are attracted to formula_21. It only guarantees that x within a certain neighborhood of formula_21 will converge. In this case, the domain of initial values that converge to 0 is the entire domain [0, 1], but to know this for certain, a separate study is required.\nThe method for determining whether a fixed point is unstable can be found by similarly differentiating the map. For r&lt;1 if a fixed point formula_21 is unstable if\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Numbered block/styles.css\" /&gt;\nIf the parameter lies in the range 0 &lt; r &lt; 1, then the other fixed point formula_46\nis negative and therefore does not lie in the range [0, 1], but it does exist as an unstable fixed point.\nCase when 1 \u2264 r \u2264 2.\nIn the general case with r between 1 and 2, the population will quickly approach the value , independent of the initial population.\nWhen the parameter r = 1, the trajectory of the logistic map converges to 0 as before, but the convergence speed is slower at r = 1. The fixed point 0 at r = 1 is asymptotically stable, but does not satisfy equation (3-1). In fact, the discrimination method based on equation (3-1) works by approximating the map to the first order near the fixed point. When r = 1, this approximation does not hold, and stability or instability is determined by the quadratic (square) terms of the map, or in order words the second order perturbation.\nWhen r = 1 is graphed, the curve is tangent to the 45\u00b0 diagonal at x = 0. In this case, the fixed point formula_47, which exists in the negative range for formula_48, is formula_49.\nFor formula_50, that is, as r increases, the value of formula_51\u2009approaches 0, and just at r = 1 \u2009, formula_51 collides with \u2009formula_53. This collision gives rise to a phenomenon known as a transcritical bifurcation.\nBifurcation is a term used to describe a qualitative change in the behavior of a dynamical system. In this case, transcritical bifurcation is when the stability of fixed points alternates between each other. That is, when r is less than 1, formula_32 is stable and formula_51 is unstable, but when r is greater than 1, formula_32 is unstable and formula_51 is stable. The parameter \u2009values at which bifurcation occurs are called bifurcation points. In this case, r = 1 is the bifurcation point.\nAs a result of the bifurcation, the orbit of the logistic map converges to the limit point formula_47 instead of formula_53. In particular, if the parameter formula_60, then the trajectory starting from a value formula_1in the interval (0, 1), exclusive of 0 and 1, converges to formula_51 by increasing or decreasing monotonically. The difference in the convergence pattern depends on the range of the initial value. formula_63\nIn the case of formula_64\nThen, it converges monotonically, \nformula_65, the function converges monotonically except for the first step.\nFurthermore, the fixed point formula_53 becomes unstable due to bifurcation, but continues to exist as a fixed point even after r &gt; 1. This does not mean that there is no initial value other than formula_32 itself that \u2009can reach this unstable fixed point \u2009formula_32. This is formula_69, and since the logistic map satisfies f (1) = 0 regardless of the value of r, \u2009applying the map once to formula_69 maps it to formula_53. A point such as x = 1 that can be reached directly as a fixed point by a \u2009finite number of iterations of the map is called a final fixed point.\nCase when 2 \u2264 r \u2264 3.\nWith r between 2 and 3, the population will also eventually approach the same value , but first will fluctuate around that value for some time. The rate of convergence is linear, except for \"r\" \n 3, when it is dramatically slow, less than linear (see Bifurcation memory).\nWhen the parameter 2 &lt; r &lt; 3, except for the initial values 0 and 1, the fixed point formula_47 is the same as when 1 &lt; r \u2264 2.\nHowever, in this case the convergence is not monotonically. As the variable approaches formula_51, it becomes larger and smaller than formula_51 repeatedly, and follows a convergent trajectory that oscillates around formula_51.\n. The value that is mapped to formula_51 by applying the mapping once is formula_77\nIn general, bifurcation diagrams are useful for understanding bifurcations. These diagrams are graphs of fixed points (or periodic points, as described below) x as a function of a parameter a, with a on the horizontal axis and x on the vertical axis. To distinguish between stable and unstable fixed points, the former curves are sometimes drawn as solid lines and the latter as dotted lines. When drawing a bifurcation diagram for the logistic map, we have a straight line representing the fixed point formula_53 \u2009and a straight line representing the fixed point formula_79\nIt can be seen that the curves representing a and b intersect at r = 1, and that stability is switched between the two.\nCase when 3 \u2264 r \u2264 3.44949.\nIn the general case With r between 3 and 1\u00a0+\u00a0\u221a6 \u2248 3.44949 the population will approach permanent oscillations between two values. These two values are dependent on r and given by formula_80.\nWhen the parameter is exactly r = 3, the orbit also has a fixed point formula_81. \nHowever, the variables converge more slowly than when formula_82. When formula_83, the derivative formula_84 reaches \u22121 and no longer satisfies equation (3-1). When r exceeds 3, formula_85, and formula_51 becomes \u2009an unstable fixed point. That is, another bifurcation occurs at formula_83.\nFor formula_83 a type of bifurcation known as a period doubling bifurcation occurs. For formula_89, the orbit no longer converges to a single point, but instead alternates between large and small values even after a sufficient amount of time has passed. For example, for formula_90, the variable alternates between the values 0.4794... and 0.8236...\nAn orbit that cycles through the same values periodically is called a periodic orbit. In this case, the final behavior of the variable as n \u2192 \u221e is a periodic orbit with two periods. Each value (point) that makes up a periodic orbit is called a periodic point. In the example where a = 3.3, 0.4794... and 0.8236... are periodic points. If a certain x is a periodic point, then in the case of two periodic points, applying the map twice to x will return it to its original state, so\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Numbered block/styles.css\" /&gt;\nIf we apply the logistic map equation (1-2) to this equation, we get\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Numbered block/styles.css\" /&gt;\nThis gives us the following fourth-order equation. The solutions of this equation are the periodic points. In fact, there are two fixed points formula_53 and formula_47\nalso satisfies equation (3-4). Therefore, of the solutions to equation (3-5), two correspond to formula_32 and formula_51, and the remaining two solutions are 2-periodic points. Let the 2-periodic points be denoted as formula_95 and formula_96, respectively. By solving equation (3-5), we can obtain them as follows\nA similar theory about the stability of fixed points can also be applied to periodic points. That is, a periodic point that attracts surrounding orbits is called an asymptotically stable periodic point, and a periodic point where the surrounding orbits move away is called an unstable periodic point. It is possible to determine the stability of periodic points in the same way as for fixed points. In the general case, consider formula_97 after k iterations of the map. \nLet formula_98 be the derivative\u2009 formula_99 of the k-periodic point formula_100. If formula_100 satisfies:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Numbered block/styles.css\" /&gt;\nthen formula_100 is asymptotically stable.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Numbered block/styles.css\" /&gt;\nthen formula_100 is unstable.\nThe above discussion of the stability of periodic points can be easily understood by drawing a graph, just like the fixed points. In this diagram, the horizontal axis is xn and the vertical axis is formula_104, and a curve is drawn that shows the relationship between formula_104 and formula_9. The intersections of this curve and the 45\u00b0 line are points that satisfy equation (3-4), so the intersections represent fixed points and 2-periodic points. If we draw a graph of the logistic map formula_107, we can observe that the slope of the tangent at the fixed point formula_51 exceeds\u2009 1 at the boundary formula_109 and becomes unstable. At the same time, two new intersections appear, which are the periodic points formula_95 and formula_96.\nWhen we actually calculate the differential coefficients of two periodic points for the logistic map, we get\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Numbered block/styles.css\" /&gt;\nWhen this is applied to equation (3-7), the parameter a becomes:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Numbered block/styles.css\" /&gt;\nIt can be seen that the 2-periodic points are asymptotically stable when this range is formula_112, i.e., when r exceeds formula_113, the 2-periodic points are no longer asymptotically stable and their behavior changes.\nAlmost all initial values in [0, 1] are attracted to the 2-periodic points, but formula_114 and formula_46\nremains as an unstable fixed point in [0,1]. These unstable fixed points continue to remain in [0,1] even if r is increased. Therefore, when the initial value is exactly formula_32 or formula_51, the orbit \u2009does not attract to a 2-periodic point. Moreover, when the initial value is the final fixed point for formula_32 or the final fixed point for formula_51, the orbit does not attract to a 2-periodic point. There are an infinite number of such final fixed points in [0, 1]. However, the number of such points is negligibly small compared to the set of real numbers [ 0, 1].\nCase when 3.44949 \u2264 r \u2264 3.56995.\nWith r between 3.44949 and 3.54409 (approximately), from almost all initial conditions the population will approach permanent oscillations among four values. The latter number is a root of a 12th degree polynomial (sequence in the OEIS).\nWith r increasing beyond 3.54409, from almost all initial conditions the population will approach oscillations among 8 values, then 16, 32, etc. The lengths of the parameter intervals that yield oscillations of a given length decrease rapidly; the ratio between the lengths of two successive bifurcation intervals approaches the Feigenbaum constant \"\u03b4\" \u2248 4.66920. This behavior is an example of a period-doubling cascade.\nWhen the parameter r exceeds formula_113, the previously stable 2-periodic points become unstable, stable 4-periodic points are generated, and the orbit gravitates toward a 4-periodic oscillation. That is, a period-doubling bifurcation occurs again at formula_121. The value of x at the 4-periodic point is also\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Numbered block/styles.css\" /&gt;\nsatisfies, so that solving this equation allows the values of x at the 4-periodic points to be found. However, equation (3-11) is a 16th-order equation, and even if we factor out the four solutions for the fixed points and the 2-periodic points, it is still a 12th-order equation. Therefore, it is no longer possible to solve this equation to obtain an explicit function of a that represents the values of the 4-periodic points in the same way as for the 2-periodic points.\nAs a becomes larger, the stable 4-periodic point undergoes another period doubling, resulting in a stable 8-periodic point. As an increases, period doubling bifurcations occur infinitely: 16, 32, 64, ..., and so on, until an infinite period, i.e., an orbit that never returns to its original value. This infinite series of period doubling bifurcations is called a cascade. While these period doubling bifurcations occur infinitely, the intervals between a at which they occur decrease in a geometric progression. Thus, an infinite number of period doubling bifurcations occur before the parameter a reaches a finite value. Let the bifurcation from period 1 to period 2 that occurs at r = 3 be counted as the first period doubling bifurcation. Then, in this cascade of period doubling bifurcations, a stable 2k-periodic point occurs at the k-th bifurcation point. Let the k-th bifurcation point a be denoted as a k. In this case, it is known that formula_122 converges to the following value as k \u2192 \u221e. (sequence in the OEIS)\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Numbered block/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurthermore, it is known that the rate of decrease of a k reaches a constant value in the limit, as shown in the following equation.\nThis value of \u03b4 is called the Feigenbaum constant because it was discovered by mathematical physicist Mitchell Feigenbaum. formula_123 is called the Feigenbaum point. In the period doubling cascade, formula_124\u2009 and formula_125 have the property that they are locally identical after an appropriate scaling transformation. The Feigenbaum constant can be found by a technique called renormalization that exploits this self-similarity. The properties that the logistic map exhibits in the period doubling cascade are also universal in a broader class of maps, as will be discussed later.\u2009\nTo get an overview of the final behavior of an orbit for a certain parameter, an approximate bifurcation diagram, orbital diagram, is useful. In this diagram, the horizontal axis is the parameter r and the vertical axis is the variable x, as in the bifurcation diagram. Using a computer, the parameters are determined and, for example, 500 iterations are performed. Then, the first 100 results are ignored and only the results of the remaining 400 are plotted. This allows the initial transient behavior to be ignored and the asymptotic behavior of the orbit remains. For example, when one point is plotted for r, it is a fixed point, and when m points are plotted for r, it corresponds to an m-periodic orbit. When an orbital diagram is drawn for the logistic map, it is possible to see how the branch representing the stable periodic orbit splits, which represents a cascade of period-doubling bifurcations.\nWhen the parameter formula_126 is exactly the accumulation point of the period-doubling cascade, the variable formula_9 is attracted to aperiodic orbits that never close. In other words, there exists a periodic point with infinite period at formula_128. This aperiodic orbit is called the Feigenbaum attractor. The critical formula_129 attractor. An attractor is a term used to refer to a region that has the property of attracting surrounding orbits, and is the orbit that is eventually drawn into and continues. The attractive fixed points and periodic points mentioned above are also members of the attractor family.\nThe structure of the Feigenbaum attractor is the same as that of a fractal figure called the Cantor set. The number of points that compose the Feigenbaum attractor is infinite and their cardinality is equal to the real numbers. However, no matter which two of the points are chosen, there is always an unstable periodic point between them, and the distribution of the points is not continuous. The fractal dimension of the Feigenbaum attractor, the Hausdorff dimension or capacity dimension, is known to be approximately 0.54.\nCase when 3.56995 &lt; r &lt; 4.\nQualitative Summary.\n 1; all subsequent windows involving odd c occur in decreasing order of c starting with arbitrarily large c. \n 4, almost all initial values eventually leave the interval [0,1] and diverge. The set of initial conditions which remain within [0,1] form a Cantor set and the dynamics restricted to this Cantor set is chaotic.\nFor any value of r there is at most one stable cycle. If a stable cycle exists, it is globally stable, attracting almost all points. Some values of r with a stable cycle of some period have infinitely many unstable cycles of various periods.\nThe bifurcation diagram &lt;templatestyles src=\"If mobile/styles.css\" /&gt;at rightabove summarizes this. The horizontal axis shows the possible values of the parameter r while the vertical axis shows the set of values of x visited asymptotically from almost all initial conditions by the iterates of the logistic equation with that r value.\nThe bifurcation diagram is a self-similar: if we zoom in on the above-mentioned value \"r\" \u2248 3.82843 and focus on one arm of the three, the situation nearby looks like a shrunk and slightly distorted version of the whole diagram. The same is true for all other non-chaotic points. This is an example of the deep and ubiquitous connection between chaos and fractals.\nWe can also consider negative values of r:\nThe Emergence of Chaos.\nWhen the parameter r exceeds formula_133, the logistic map exhibits chaotic behavior. Roughly speaking, chaos is a complex and irregular behavior that occurs despite the fact that the difference equation describing the logistic map has no probabilistic ambiguity and the next state is completely and uniquely determined. The range of formula_134 of the logistic map is called the chaotic region.\nOne of the properties of chaos is its unpredictability, symbolized by the term butterfly effect. This is due to the property of chaos that a slight difference in the initial state can lead to a huge difference in the later state. In terms of a discrete dynamical system, if we have two initial values formula_1 and formula_136\nNo matter how close they are, once time n has progressed to a certain extent, each destination formula_9 and formula_138 can vary significantly. For example, use formula_139\nIf the orbits are calculated using two very similar initial values, 0 = 0.1000000001, the difference grows to macroscopic values that are clearly visible on the graph after about 29 iterations.\nThis property of chaos, called initial condition sensitivity, can be quantitatively expressed by the Lyapunov exponent. For a one-dimensional map, the Lyapunov exponent \u03bb can be calculated as follows:\nHere, log means natural logarithm. This \u03bb is the distance between the two orbits (formula_9 and\nformula_138).\nA positive value of \u03bb indicates that the system is sensitive to initial conditions, while a zero or negative value indicates that the system is not sensitive to initial conditions. When calculating \u03bb of numerically, it can be confirmed \u03bb remains in the range of zero or negative values in the range formula_142, and that \u03bb can take positive values in the range formula_134.\nWindow, intermittent\nEven beyond formula_128, the behavior does not depend simply on the parameter r. Many sophisticated mathematical structures lurk in the chaotic region for formula_134. In this region, chaos does not persist forever; stable periodic orbits reappear. The behavior for formula_146 can be broadly divided into two types:\nThe region of stable periodic points that exists for r formula_147 is called a periodic window, or simply a window. If one looks at a chaotic region in an orbital diagram, the region of nonperiodic orbits looks like a cloud of countless points, with the windows being the scattered blanks surrounded by the cloud.\n Orbit diagram of the logistic map from r = 3.55 to r = 4 (parameter is denoted as r in the diagram)\nIn each window, the cascade of period-doubling bifurcations that occurred before formula_133 occurs again. However, instead of the previous stable periodic orbits of 2 k, new stable periodic orbits such as 3\u00d72 k and 5\u00d72 k are generated. The first window has a period of p, and the windows from which the period-doubling cascade occurs are called windows of period p, etc.. For example, a window of period 3 exists in the region around 3.8284 &lt; a &lt; 3.8415, and within this region the period doublings are: 3, 6, 12, 24, ..., 3\u00d72 k, ...\nIn the window region, chaos does not disappear but exists in the background. However, this chaos is unstable, so only stable periodic orbits are observed. In the window region, this potential chaos appears before the orbit is attracted from its initial state to a stable periodic orbit. Such chaos is called transient chaos. In this potential presence of chaos, windows differ from the periodic orbits that appeared before a\u221e.\nThere are an infinite number of windows in the range a\u221e &lt; a &lt; 4. The windows have various periods, and there is a window with a period for every natural number greater than or equal to three. However, each window does not occur exactly once. The larger the value of p, the more often a window with that period occurs. A window with period 3 occurs only once, while a window with period 13 occurs 315 times. When a periodic orbit of 3 occurs in the window with period 3, the Szarkovsky order is completed, and all orbits with all periods have been seen.\nIf we restrict ourselves to the case where p is a prime number, the number of windows with period p is\nThis formula was derived for p to be a prime number, but in fact it is possible to calculate with good accuracy the number of stable p- periodic points for non-prime p as well.\nThe window width (the difference between a where the window begins and a where the window ends) is widest for windows with period 3 and narrows for larger periods. For example, the window width for a window with period 13 is about 3.13 \u00d7 10\u22126. Rough estimates suggest that about 10% of formula_149 is in the window region, with the rest dominated by chaotic orbits.\nThe change from chaos to a window as r is increased is caused by a tangent bifurcation, where the map curve is tangent to the diagonal of y = x at the moment of bifurcation, and further parameter changes result in two fixed points where the curve and the line intersect. For a window of period p, the iterated map formula_150 exhibits tangent bifurcation, resulting in stable p-periodic orbits. The exact value of the bifurcation point for a window of period 3 is known, and if the value of this bifurcation point r is formula_151, then formula_152. The outline of this bifurcation can be understood by considering the graph of formula_153 (vertical axis formula_154, horizontal axis formula_9).\u2009\u2009\nWhen we look at the behavior of formula_9 when r = 3.8282, which is slightly smaller than the branch point formula_151, we can see that in addition to the irregular changes, there is also a behavior that changes periodically with approximately three periods, and these occur alternately. This type of periodic behavior is called a \"laminar\", and the irregular behavior is called a burst, in analogy with fluids. There is no regularity in the length of the time periods of the bursts and laminars, and they change irregularly. However, when we observe the behavior at r = 3.828327, which is closer to formula_151, the average length of the laminars is longer and the average length of the bursts is shorter than when r = 3.8282. If we further increase r, the length of the laminars becomes larger and larger, and at formula_151 it changes to a perfect three- period.\nThe phenomenon in which orderly motions called laminars and disorderly motions called bursts occur intermittently is called intermittency or intermittent chaos. If we consider the parameter a decreasing from a3, this is a type of emergence of chaos. As the parameter moves away from the window, bursts become more dominant, eventually resulting in a completely chaotic state. This is also a general route to chaos, like the period doubling bifurcation route mentioned above, and routes characterized by the emergence of intermittent chaos due to tangent bifurcations are called intermittency routes.\nThe mechanism of intermittency can also be understood from the graph of the map. When formula_160 is slightly smaller than formula_151, there is a very small gap between the graph of formula_153 and the diagonal. This gap is called a channel, and many iterations of the map occur as the orbit passes through the narrow channel. During the passage through this channel, formula_9 and formula_164 become very close, and the variables change almost like a periodic three orbit. This corresponds to a laminar. The orbit eventually leaves the narrow channel, but returns to the channel again as a result of the global structure of the map. While leaving the channel, it behaves chaotically. This corresponds to a burst.\nBand, window finish\nLooking at the entire chaotic domain, whether it is chaotic or windowed, the maximum and minimum values on the vertical axis of the orbital diagram (the upper and lower limits of the attractor) are limited to a certain range. As shown in equation (2-1), the maximum value of the logistic map is given by r/4, which is the upper limit of the attractor. The lower limit of the attractor is given by the point f(r/4) where r/4 is mapped. Ultimately, the maximum and minimum values at which xn moves on the orbital diagram depend on the parameter r\nFinally, for r = 4, the orbit spans the entire range [0, 1].\nWhen observing an orbital map, the distribution of points has a characteristic shading. Darker areas indicate that the variable takes on values in the vicinity of the darker areas, whereas lighter areas indicate that the variable takes on values in the vicinity of the darker areas. These differences in the frequency of the points are due to the shape of the graph of the logistic map. The top of the graph, near r/4, attracts orbits with high frequency, and the area near f(r/4) that is mapped from there also becomes highly frequent, and the area near formula_165 that is mapped from there also becomes\u2009 highly frequent, and so on. The density distribution of points generated by the map is characterized by a quantity called an invariant measure or distribution function, and the invariant measure of the attractor is reproducible regardless of the initial value.\nLooking at the beginning of the chaotic region of the orbit diagram, just beyond the accumulation point formula_166 of the first period - doubling cascade, one can see that the orbit is divided into several subregions. These subregions are called bands. When there are multiple bands, the orbit moves through each band in a regular order, but the values within each band are irregular. Such chaotic orbits are called band chaos or periodic chaos, and chaos with k bands is called k -band chaos. Two-band chaos lies in the range 3.590 &lt; r &lt; 3.675, approximately.\n Band structure. Because the formula_167 spacing rapidly decreases, it is not possible to show more than eight bands. The top and bottom lines, which contain the orbitals, are within the range of equation (3-16).\nAs the value of r is further decreased from the left-hand end of two-band chaos, r = 3.590, the number of bands doubles, just as in the period doubling bifurcation. Let formula_167 (for p = 1, 2, 4, ..., 2k, ...) denote the bifurcation points where p \u2212 1 band chaos splits into p band chaos, or where p band chaos merges into p \u2212 1 band chaos. Then, just as in the period doubling bifurcation, e p accumulates to a value as p \u2192 \u221e. At this accumulation point formula_169, the number of bands becomes infinite, and the value of formula_169 is equal to the value of formula_128.\nSimilarly, for the bifurcation points of the period-doubling bifurcation cascade that appeared before a\u221e, let a p (where p = 1, 2, 4, ..., 2k, ...) denote the bifurcation points where p stable periodic orbits branch into p + 1 stable periodic orbits. In this case, if we look at the orbital diagram from formula_172 to formula_173, there are two reduced versions of the global orbital diagram from formula_174 to formula_175 in the orbital diagram from formula_172 to formula_173. Similarly, if we look at the orbital diagram from formula_178 to formula_179, there are four reduced versions of the global orbital diagram from a1 to e1 in the orbital diagram from formula_178 to formula_179. Similarly, there are p reduced versions of the global orbital diagram in the orbital diagram from ap to ep, and the branching structure of the logistic map has an infinite self-similar hierarchy.\nA self-similar hierarchy of bifurcation structures also exists within windows. The period-doubling bifurcation cascades within a window follow the same path as the cascades of period-2k bifurcations. That is, there are an infinite number of period-doubling bifurcations within a window, after which the behavior becomes chaotic again. For example, in a window of period 3, the cascade of stable periodic orbits ends at formula_182 \u2248 3.8495. After formula_182 \u2248 3.8495, the behavior becomes band chaos of multiples of three. As a increases from formula_182, these band chaos also merge by twos, until at the end of the window there are three bands. Within such bands within a window, there are an infinite number of windows. Ultimately, the window contains a miniature version of the entire orbital diagram for 1 \u2264 a \u2264 4, and within the window there exists a self-similar hierarchy of branchings.\nAt the end of the window, the system reverts to widespread chaos. For a period 3 window, the final 3-band chaos turns into large-area 1-band chaos at a \u2248 3.857, ending the window. However, this change is discontinuous, and the 3-band chaotic attractor suddenly changes size and turns into a 1-band. Such discontinuous changes in attractor size are called crises. Crises of this kind, which occur at the end of a window, are also called internal crises. When a crisis occurs at the end of a window, a stable periodic orbit just touches an unstable periodic point that is not visible on the orbit diagram. This creates an exit point through which the periodic orbits can escape, resulting in an internal crisis. Immediately after the internal crisis, there are periods of widespread chaos, and periods of time when the original band chaotic behavior reoccurs, resulting in a kind of intermittency similar to that observed at the beginning of a window.\nWhen r = 4.\n Spider diagram of the logistic map with parameter r = 4 (left) and time series up to n = 500 (right) for the initial value formula_1 = 0.3.\nWhen the parameter r = 4, the behavior becomes chaotic over the entire range [0, 1]. At this time, the Lyapunov exponent \u03bb is maximized, and the state is the most chaotic. The value of \u03bb for the logistic map at r = 4 can be calculated precisely, and its value is \u03bb = log 2. Although a strict mathematical definition of chaos has not yet been unified, it can be shown that the logistic map with r = 4 is chaotic on [0, 1] according to one well-known definition of chaos.\nThe invariant measure of the density of points, \u03c1(x), can also be given by the exact function \u03c1(x) for r = 4:\nHere, \u03c1(x) means that the fraction of points xn that fall in the infinitesimal interval [x,x+dx] when the map is iterated is given by \u03c1(x) dx. The frequency distribution of the logistic map with r = 4 has high density near both sides of [0, 1] and is least dense at x = 0.5.\nWhen r = 4, apart from chaotic orbits, there are also periodic orbits with any period. For a natural number n, the graph of formula_186 is a curve with formula_187 peaks and formula_188 valleys, all of which are tangent to 0 and 1. Thus, the number of intersections between the diagonal and the graph is formula_189, and there are formula_189 fixed points of formula_191. The n-periodic points are always included in these formula_189 fixed points, so any n-periodic orbit exists for formula_193. Thus,when r = 4, there are an infinite number of periodic points on [0, 1], but all of these periodic points are unstable. Furthermore,the uncountably infinite set in the interval [0, 1], the number of periodic points is countably infinite, and so almost all orbits starting from initial values are not periodic but non-periodic.\u2009\nOne of the important aspects of chaos is its dual nature: deterministic and stochastic. Dynamical systems are deterministic processes, but when the range of variables is appropriately coarse-grained, they become indistinguishable from stochastic processes. In the case of the logistic map with r = 4, the outcome of every coin toss can be described by the trajectory of the logistic map. This can be elaborated as follows.\nAssume that a coin is tossed with a probability of 1/2 landing on heads or tails, and the coin is tossed repeatedly. If heads is 0 and tails is 1, then the result of heads, tails, heads, tails, etc. will be a symbol string such as 01001... On the other hand, for the trajectory formula_194 of the logistic map, values less than x = 0.5 are converted to 0 and values greater than x = 0.5 are converted to 1, and the trajectory is replaced with a symbol string consisting of 0s and 1s. For example, if the initial value is formula_195, then formula_196, formula_197, formula_198, ..., so the trajectory will be the symbol string 0110... Let formula_199 be the symbol string resulting from the former coin toss, and formula_200 be the symbol string resulting from the latter logistic map. The symbols in the symbol string formula_199 were determined by random coin tossing, so any number sequence patterns are possible. So, whatever the string formula_200 of the logistic map, there is an identical one in formula_199. And, what is \"remarkable\" is that the converse is also true: whatever the string of formula_199, it can be realized by a logistic map trajectory formula_200 by choosing the appropriate initial values. That is, for any formula_199, there exists a unique point formula_1 in [0, 1] such that formula_208.\nWhen r &gt; 4.\nWhen the parameter r exceeds 4, the vertex r /4 of the logistic map graph exceeds 1. To the extent that the graph penetrates 1, trajectories can escape [0, 1].\nThe bifurcation at r = 4 is also a type of crisis, specifically a boundary crisis. In this case, the attractor at [0, 1] becomes unstable and collapses, and since there is no attractor outside it, the trajectory diverges to infinity.\nOn the other hand, there are orbits that remain in [0, 1] even if r &gt; 4. Easy-to-understand examples are fixed points and periodic points in [0, 1], which remain in [0, 1]. However, there are also orbits that remain in [0, 1] other than fixed points and periodic points.\nLet formula_209 be the interval of x such that f \u2009(x) &gt; 1. As mentioned above,once a variable formula_9 enters formula_209, it diverges to minus infinity. There is also formula_212 x in [0, 1] that maps to formula_209 after one application of the map. This interval of x is divided into two, which are collectively called formula_214. Similarly, there are four intervals that map to formula_214 after one application of the map, which are collectively called formula_216. Similarly,there are 2n intervals formula_217 that reach formula_209 after n iterations. Therefore, the interval formula_219 obtained by removing formula_217 from [0, 1] an infinite number of times as follows is a collection of orbits that remain in I.\nThe process of removing formula_217 from [0, 1] is similar to the construction of the Cantor set mentioned above, and in fact \u039b exists in [0, 1] as a Cantor set (a closed, completely disconnected, and complete subset of [0, 1]). Furthermore, on formula_219, the logistic map formula_223 is chaotic.\nWhen r &lt; 0.\nSince the logistic map has been often studied as an ecological model, the case where the parameter r is negative has rarely been discussed. As a decreases from 0, when \u22121 &lt; r &lt; 0, the map asymptotically approaches a stable fixed point of xf = 0, but when a exceeds \u22121, it bifurcates into two periodic points, and as in the case of positive values, it passes through a period doubling bifurcation and reaches chaos. Finally, when a falls below \u22122, the map diverges to plus infinity.\n Orbit diagram for parameter r from \u22122 to 4. The orbit diverges when the parameter a goes beyond this range, both on the negative and positive sides.\nExact solutions for special cases.\nFor a logistic map with a specific parameter formula_224, an exact solution that explicitly includes the time formula_225 and the initial value formula_1 has been obtained as follows.\nWhen r = 4\nWhen r = 2\nWhen r = \u22122\nConsidering the three exact solutions above, all of them are\nChaos and the logistic map.\nThe relative simplicity of the logistic map makes it a widely used point of entry into a consideration of the concept of chaos. A rough description of chaos is that chaotic systems exhibits: (see Chaotic dynamics)\nThese are properties of the logistic map for most values of r between about 3.57 and 4 (as noted above). A common source of such sensitivity to initial conditions is that the map represents a repeated folding and stretching of the space on which it is defined. In the case of the logistic map, the quadratic difference equation describing it may be thought of as a stretching-and-folding operation on the interval (0,1).\nThe following figure illustrates the stretching and folding over a sequence of iterates of the map. Figure (a), left, shows a two-dimensional Poincar\u00e9 plot of the logistic map's state space for \"r\" \n 4, and clearly shows the quadratic curve of the difference equation (1). However, we can embed the same sequence in a three-dimensional state space, in order to investigate the deeper structure of the map. Figure (b) demonstrates this, showing how initially nearby points begin to diverge, particularly in those regions of xt corresponding to the steeper sections of the plot.\nThis stretching-and-folding does not just produce a gradual divergence of the sequences of iterates, but an exponential divergence (see Lyapunov exponents), evidenced also by the complexity and unpredictability of the chaotic logistic map. In fact, exponential divergence of sequences of iterates explains the connection between chaos and unpredictability: a small error in the supposed initial state of the system will tend to correspond to a large error later in its evolution. Hence, predictions about future states become progressively (indeed, exponentially) worse when there are even very small errors in our knowledge of the initial state. This quality of unpredictability and apparent randomness led the logistic map equation to be used as a pseudo-random number generator in early computers.\nAt r = 2, the function formula_227 intersects formula_228 precisely at the maximum point, so convergence to the equilibrium point is on the order of formula_229. Consequently, the equilibrium point is called \"superstable\". Its Lyapunov exponent is formula_230. A similar argument shows that there is a superstable formula_160 value within each interval where the dynamical system has a stable cycle. This can be seen in the Lyapunov exponent plot as sharp dips.\nSince the map is confined to an interval on the real number line, its dimension is less than or equal to unity. Numerical estimates yield a correlation dimension of (Grassberger, 1983), a Hausdorff dimension of about 0.538 (Grassberger 1981), and an information dimension of approximately 0.5170976 (Grassberger 1983) for \"r\" \u2248 3.5699456 (onset of chaos). Note: It can be shown that the correlation dimension is certainly between 0.4926 and 0.5024.\nIt is often possible, however, to make precise and accurate statements about the \"likelihood\" of a future state in a chaotic system. If a (possibly chaotic) dynamical system has an attractor, then there exists a probability measure that gives the long-run proportion of time spent by the system in the various regions of the attractor. In the case of the logistic map with parameter \"r\" \n 4 and an initial state in (0,1), the attractor is also the interval (0,1) and the probability measure corresponds to the beta distribution with parameters \"a\" \n 0.5 and \"b\" \n 0.5. Specifically, the invariant measure is\nformula_232\nUnpredictability is not randomness, but in some circumstances looks very much like it. Hence, and fortunately, even if we know very little about the initial state of the logistic map (or some other chaotic system), we can still say something about the distribution of states arbitrarily far into the future, and use this knowledge to inform decisions based on the state of the system.\nGraphical representation.\nThe bifurcation diagram for the logistic map can be visualized with the following Python code:\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\ninterval = (2.8, 4) # start, end\naccuracy = 0.0001\nreps = 600 # number of repetitions\nnumtoplot = 200\nlims = np.zeros(reps)\nfig, biax = plt.subplots()\nfig.set_size_inches(16, 9)\nlims[0] = np.random.rand()\nfor r in np.arange(interval[0], interval[1], accuracy):\n for i in range(reps - 1):\n lims[i + 1] = r * lims[i] * (1 - lims[i])\n biax.plot([r] * numtoplot, lims[reps - numtoplot :], \"b.\", markersize=0.02)\nbiax.set(xlabel=\"r\", ylabel=\"x\", title=\"logistic map\")\nplt.show()\nSpecial cases of the map.\nUpper bound when 0 \u2264 \"r\" \u2264 1.\nAlthough exact solutions to the recurrence relation are only available in a small number of cases, a closed-form upper bound on the logistic map is known when 0 \u2264 \"r\" \u2264 1. There are two aspects of the behavior of the logistic map that should be captured by an upper bound in this regime: the asymptotic geometric decay with constant r, and the fast initial decay when \"x\"0 is close to 1, driven by the (1 \u2212 \"xn\") term in the recurrence relation. The following bound captures both of these effects:\nformula_233\nSolution when \"r\" = 4.\nThe special case of \"r\" = 4 can in fact be solved exactly, as can the case with \"r\" = 2; however, the general case can only be predicted statistically. \nThe solution when \"r\" = 4 is:\nformula_234\nwhere the initial condition parameter \u03b8 is given by\nformula_235\nFor rational \u03b8, after a finite number of iterations xn maps into a periodic sequence. But almost all \u03b8 are irrational, and, for irrational \u03b8, xn never repeats itself \u2013 it is non-periodic. This solution equation clearly demonstrates the two key features of chaos \u2013 stretching and folding: the factor 2\"n\" shows the exponential growth of stretching, which results in sensitive dependence on initial conditions, while the squared sine function keeps xn folded within the range [0,1].\nFor \"r\" = 4 an equivalent solution in terms of complex numbers instead of trigonometric functions is\nformula_236\nwhere \u03b1 is either of the complex numbers\nformula_237\nwith modulus equal to 1. Just as the squared sine function in the trigonometric solution leads to neither shrinkage nor expansion of the set of points visited, in the latter solution this effect is accomplished by the unit modulus of \u03b1.\nBy contrast, the solution when \"r\" = 2 is\nformula_238\nfor \"x\"0 \u2208 [0,1). Since (1 \u2212 2\"x\"0) \u2208 (\u22121,1) for any value of \"x\"0 other than the unstable fixed point 0, the term (1 \u2212 2\"x\"0)2\"n\" goes to 0 as n goes to infinity, so xn goes to the stable fixed point .\n\n 4====\nFor the \"r\" \n 4 case, from almost all initial conditions the iterate sequence is chaotic. Nevertheless, there exist an infinite number of initial conditions that lead to cycles, and indeed there exist cycles of length k for \"all\" integers \"k\" &gt; 0. We can exploit the relationship of the logistic map to the dyadic transformation (also known as the \"bit-shift map\") to find cycles of any length. If x follows the logistic map \"x\"\"n\" + 1 \n 4\"xn\"(1 \u2212 \"xn\") and y follows the \"dyadic transformation\"\nformula_239\nthen the two are related by a homeomorphism\nformula_240\nThe reason that the dyadic transformation is also called the bit-shift map is that when y is written in binary notation, the map moves the binary point one place to the right (and if the bit to the left of the binary point has become a \"1\", this \"1\" is changed to a \"0\"). A cycle of length 3, for example, occurs if an iterate has a 3-bit repeating sequence in its binary expansion (which is not also a one-bit repeating sequence): 001, 010, 100, 110, 101, or 011. The iterate 001001001... maps into 010010010..., which maps into 100100100..., which in turn maps into the original 001001001...; so this is a 3-cycle of the bit shift map. And the other three binary-expansion repeating sequences give the 3-cycle 110110110... \u2192 101101101... \u2192 011011011... \u2192 110110110... Either of these 3-cycles can be converted to fraction form: for example, the first-given 3-cycle can be written as \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 . Using the above translation from the bit-shift map to the formula_241 logistic map gives the corresponding logistic cycle 0.611260467... \u2192 0.950484434... \u2192 0.188255099... \u2192 0.611260467... We could similarly translate the other bit-shift 3-cycle into its corresponding logistic cycle. Likewise, cycles of any length k can be found in the bit-shift map and then translated into the corresponding logistic cycles.\nHowever, since almost all numbers in [0,1) are irrational, almost all initial conditions of the bit-shift map lead to the non-periodicity of chaos. This is one way to see that the logistic \"r\" \n 4 map is chaotic for almost all initial conditions.\nThe number of cycles of (minimal) length \"k\" \n 1, 2, 3,\u2026 for the logistic map with \"r\" \n 4 (tent map with \"\u03bc\" \n 2) is a known integer sequence (sequence in the OEIS): 2, 1, 2, 3, 6, 9, 18, 30, 56, 99, 186, 335, 630, 1161... This tells us that the logistic map with \"r\" \n 4 has 2 fixed points, 1 cycle of length 2, 2 cycles of length 3 and so on. This sequence takes a particularly simple form for prime k: 2 \u22c5. For example: 2\u00a0\u22c5\u00a0 = 630 is the number of cycles of length 13. Since this case of the logistic map is chaotic for almost all initial conditions, all of these finite-length cycles are unstable.\nUniversality.\nA class of mappings that exhibit homogeneous behavior.\nThe bifurcation pattern shown above for the logistic map is not limited to the logistic map . It appears in a number of maps that satisfy certain conditions . The following dynamical system using sine functions is one example :\nHere, the domain is 0 \u2264 b \u2264 1 and 0 \u2264 x \u2264 1 . The sine map ( 4-1 ) exhibits qualitatively identical behavior to the logistic map ( 1-2 ) : like the logistic map, it also becomes chaotic via a period doubling route as the parameter b increases, and moreover, like the logistic map, it also exhibits a window in the chaotic region .\nBoth the logistic map and the sine map are one-dimensional maps that map the interval [0, 1] to [0, 1] and satisfy the following property, called unimodal .\nformula_242.\nThe map is differentiable and there exists a unique critical point c in [0, 1] such that formula_243.\nIn general, if a one-dimensional map with one parameter and one variable is unimodal and the vertex can be approximated by a second-order polynomial, then, regardless of the specific form of the map, an infinite period-doubling cascade of bifurcations will occur for the parameter range 3 \u2264 r \u2264 3.56994... , and the ratio \u03b4 defined by equation ( 3-13 ) is equal to the Feigenbaum constant, 4.669... .\nThe pattern of stable periodic orbits that emerge from the logistic map is also universal . For a unimodal map, formula_244 , with parameter c, stable periodic orbits with various periods continue to emerge in a parameter interval where the two fixed points are unstable, and the pattern of their emergence (the number of stable periodic orbits with a certain period and the order of their appearance) is known to be common . In other words, for this type of map, the sequence of stable periodic orbits is the same regardless of the specific form of the map . For the logistic map, the parameter interval is 3 &lt; a &lt; 4, but for the sine map ( 4-1 ), the parameter interval for the common sequence of stable periodic orbits is 0.71... &lt; b &lt; 1 . This universal sequence of stable periodic orbits is called the U sequence .\nIn addition, the logistic map has the property that its Schwarzian derivative is always negative on the interval [0, 1] . The Schwarzian derivative of a map f (of class C3 ) is\u2009\nIn fact, when we calculate the Schwarzian derivative of the logistic map, we get\nwhere the Schwarzian derivative is negative regardless of the values of a and x . It is known that if a one-dimensional mapping from [0, 1] to [0, 1] is unimodal and has a negative Schwarzian derivative, then there is at most one stable periodic orbit . \nTopological conjugate mapping.\nLet the symbol \u2218 denote the composition of maps . In general, for \u2009a topological space X, Y, two maps f \u2009: X \u2192 X and g \u2009: Y \u2192 Y are composed by a homeomorphism h : X \u2192 Y.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Numbered block/styles.css\" /&gt;\nf and g are said to be phase conjugates if they satisfy the relation . The concept of phase conjugation plays an important role in the study of dynamical systems . Phase conjugate f and g exhibit essentially identical behavior, and if the behavior of f is periodic, then g is also periodic, and if the behavior of f is chaotic, then g is also chaotic .\nIn particular, if a homeomorphism h is linear, then f and g are said to be linearly conjugate . Every quadratic function is linearly conjugate with every other quadratic function . Hence,\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Numbered block/styles.css\" /&gt;\nare linearly conjugates of the logistic map for any parameter a . Equations ( 4-6 ) and ( 4-7 ) are also called logistic maps . In particular, the form ( 4-7 ) is suitable for time-consuming numerical calculations, since it requires less computational effort .\nMoreover, the logistic map formula_245 for formula_241 is topologically conjugate to the following tent map T \u2009( x ) and Bernoulli shift map B \u2009( x ) .\nThese phase conjugate relations can be used to prove that the logistic map formula_245 is strictly chaotic and to derive the exact solution ( 3-19 ) of formula_248 .\nAlternatively, introducing the concept of symbolic dynamical systems, consider the following shift map \u03c3 defined on the symbolic string space consisting of strings of 0s and 1s as introduced above :\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Numbered block/styles.css\" /&gt;\nHere, formula_249 is 0 or 1. On the set formula_219 introduced in equation ( 3-18 ), the logistic map formula_251 is topologically conjugate to the shift map, so we can use this to derive that formula_251 on formula_219 is chaotic .\nPeriod-doubling route to chaos.\nIn the logistic map, we have a function formula_254, and we want to study what happens when we iterate the map many times. The map might fall into a fixed point, a fixed cycle, or chaos. When the map falls into a stable fixed cycle of length formula_225, we would find that the graph of formula_256 and the graph of formula_257 intersects at formula_225 points, and the slope of the graph of formula_256 is bounded in formula_260 at those intersections. \nFor example, when formula_261, we have a single intersection, with slope bounded in formula_260, indicating that it is a stable single fixed point.\nAs formula_160 increases to beyond formula_261, the intersection point splits to two, which is a period doubling. For example, when formula_265, there are three intersection points, with the middle one unstable, and the two others stable.\nAs formula_160 approaches formula_267, another period-doubling occurs in the same way. The period-doublings occur more and more frequently, until at a certain formula_268, the period doublings become infinite, and the map becomes chaotic. This is the period-doubling route to chaos.\nScaling limit.\nLooking at the images, one can notice that at the point of chaos formula_269, the curve of formula_270 looks like a fractal. Furthermore, as we repeat the period-doublingsformula_271, the graphs seem to resemble each other, except that they are shrunken towards the middle, and rotated by 180 degrees. \nThis suggests to us a scaling limit: if we repeatedly double the function, then scale it up by formula_272 for a certain constant formula_272:formula_274then at the limit, we would end up with a function formula_275 that satisfies formula_276. This is a Feigenbaum function, which appears in most period-doubling routes to chaos (thus it is an instance of universality). Further, as the period-doubling intervals become shorter and shorter, the ratio between two period-doubling intervals converges to a limit, the first Feigenbaum constant formula_277.\nThe constant formula_272 can be numerically found by trying many possible values. For the wrong values, the map does not converge to a limit, but when it is formula_279, it converges. This is the second Feigenbaum constant.\nChaotic regime.\nIn the chaotic regime, formula_280, the limit of the iterates of the map, becomes chaotic dark bands interspersed with non-chaotic bright bands.\nOther scaling limits.\nWhen formula_160 approaches formula_282, we have another period-doubling approach to chaos, but this time with periods 3, 6, 12, ... This again has the same Feigenbaum constants formula_283. The limit of formula_284 is also the same Feigenbaum function. This is an example of universality.\nWe can also consider period-tripling route to chaos by picking a sequence of formula_285 such that formula_212 is the lowest value in the period-formula_287 window of the bifurcation diagram. For example, we have formula_288, with the limit formula_289. This has a different pair of Feigenbaum constants formula_290. And formula_280converges to the fixed point to formula_292As another example, period-4-pling has a pair of Feigenbaum constants distinct from that of period-doubling, even though period-4-pling is reached by two period-doublings. In detail, define formula_285 such that formula_212 is the lowest value in the period-formula_295 window of the bifurcation diagram. Then we have formula_296, with the limit formula_297. This has a different pair of Feigenbaum constants formula_298. \nIn general, each period-multiplying route to chaos has its own pair of Feigenbaum constants. In fact, there are typically more than one. For example, for period-7-pling, there are at least 9 different pairs of Feigenbaum constants.\nGenerally, formula_299, and the relation becomes exact as both numbers increase to infinity: formula_300.\nFeigenbaum universality of 1-D maps.\nUniversality of one-dimensional maps with parabolic maxima and Feigenbaum constants formula_301, formula_302.\nThe gradual increase of formula_303 at interval formula_304 changes dynamics from regular to chaotic one with qualitatively the same bifurcation diagram as those for logistic map.\nRenormalization estimate.\nThe Feigenbaum constants can be estimated by a renormalization argument. (Section 10.7,).\nBy universality, we can use another family of functions that also undergoes repeated period-doubling on its route to chaos, and even though it is not exactly the logistic map, it would still yield the same Feigenbaum constants.\nDefine the family formula_305The family has an equilibrium point at zero, and as formula_160 increases, it undergoes period-doubling bifurcation at formula_307.\nThe first bifurcation occurs at formula_308. After the period-doubling bifurcation, we can solve for the period-2 stable orbit by formula_309, which yields formula_310At some point formula_311, the period-2 stable orbit undergoes period-doubling bifurcation again, yielding a period-4 stable orbit. In order to find out what the stable orbit is like, we \"zoom in\" around the region of formula_312, using the affine transform formula_313. Now, by routine algebra, we haveformula_314where formula_315. At approximately formula_316, the second bifurcation occurs, thus formula_317.\nBy self-similarity, the third bifurcation when formula_318, and so on. Thus we have formula_319, or formula_320. Iterating this map, we find formula_321, and formula_322.\nThus, we have the estimates formula_323, and formula_324. These are within 10% of the true values.\nRelation to logistic ordinary differential equation.\nThe logistic map exhibits numerous characteristics of both periodic and chaotic solutions, whereas the logistic ordinary differential equation (ODE) exhibits regular solutions, commonly referred to as the S-shaped sigmoid function. The logistic map can be seen as the discrete counterpart of the logistic ODE, and their correlation has been extensively discussed in literature.\nThe logistic map as a model of biological populations.\nDiscrete population model.\nWhile Lorenz used the logistic map in 1964, it gained widespread popularity from the research of British mathematical biologist Robert May and became widely known as a formula for considering changes in populations of organisms. In such a logistic map for organism populations, the variable formula_9 represents the number of organisms living in a certain environment (more technically, the population size). Furthermore, it is assumed that no organisms leave the environment and no external organisms enter the environment (or that there is no substantial impact even if there is immigration), and the mathematical model for considering the increase or decrease in population in such a situation is the logistic map in mathematical biology. \nThere are two types of mathematical models for the growth of populations of organisms: discrete-time models using difference equations and continuous-time models using differential equations. For example, in the case of a type of insect that dies soon after laying eggs, the population of the insect is counted for each generation, i.e., the number of individuals in the first generation, the number of individuals in the second generation, and so on. Such examples fit the former discrete-time model. On the other hand, when the generations are continuously overlapping, it is compatible with the continuous-time model. The logistic map corresponds to such a discrete or generation-separated population model. \nLet N denote the number of individuals of a single species in an environment. The simplest model for population growth is one in which the population continues to grow at a constant rate relative to the number of individuals. This type of population growth model is called the Malthusian model, and can be expressed as follows :\nHere, N n is the number of individuals in the nth generation, and \u03b1 is the population growth rate, a positive constant . However, in model (5-1), the population continues to grow indefinitely, making it an unrealistic model for most real-world phenomena . Since there is a limit to the number of individuals that an environment can support, it seems natural that the growth rate \u03b1 decreases as the population N n increases . This change in growth rate due to changes in population density is called the density effect . The following difference equation is the simplest improvement model that reflects the density effect in model (5-1).\nHere, a is the maximum growth rate possible in the environment, and b is the strength of the influence of density effects . Model ( 5-2 ) assumes that the growth rate declines simply in proportion to the number of individuals. Let N n in equation (5-2) be\nAfter performing the variable transformation, the following logistic map is derived:\nWhen using equation (5-2) or equation (5-4) as the population size of an organism, if Nn or xn becomes negative, it becomes meaningless as a population size. To prevent this, the condition 0 \u2264 x0 \u2264 1 for the initial value x0 and the condition 0 \u2264 r \u2264 4 for the parameter a are required. \nAlternatively, we can assume a maximum population size K that the environment can support, and use this to\nThe logistic map can be derived by considering a difference equation that incorporates density effects in the form formula_326 , where the variable formula_9 represents the ratio of the number of individuals formula_328 to the maximum number of individuals K .\nDiscretization of the logistic equation.\nThe logistic map can also be derived from the discretization of the logistic equation for continuous-time population models. The name of the logistic map comes from Robert May's introduction of the logistic map from the discretization of the logistic equation. The logistic equation is an ordinary differential equation that describes the time evolution of a population as follows: \nHere, N is the number or population density of an organism, t is continuous time, and K and r are parameters. K is the carrying capacity, and r is the intrinsic rate of natural increase, which is usually positive . The left-hand side of this equation \ndN/dt\ndenotes the rate of change of the population size at time t .\nThe logistic equation ( 5-6 ) appears similar to the logistic map ( 5-4 ), but the behavior of the solutions is quite different from that of the logistic map . As long as the initial value N 0 is positive, the population size N of the logistic equation always converges monotonically to K .\nThe logistic map can be derived by applying the Euler method, which is a method for numerically solving first-order ordinary differential equations, to this logistic equation . [ Note 2 ] The Euler method uses a time interval (time step size) \u0394t to approximate the growth rate dN/dt\nis approximated as follows :\nThis approximation leads to the following logistic map :\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Numbered block/styles.css\" /&gt;\nwhere formula_9 and a in this equation are related to the original parameters, variables, and time step size as follows :\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Numbered block/styles.css\" /&gt;\nIf \u0394t is small enough, equation ( 5-8 ) serves as a valid approximation to the original equation ( 5-6 ), and coincides with the solution of the original equation as \u0394t \u2192 0 . On the other hand, as \u0394t becomes large, the solution deviates from the original solution . Furthermore, due to the relationship in equation ( 5-10 ), increasing \u0394t is equivalent to increasing the parameter a . Thus, increasing \u0394t not only increases the error from the original equation but also produces chaotic behavior in the solution .\nPositioning.\nAs described above, in biological population dynamics, the logistic map is one of the models of discrete growth processes. However, unlike the laws of physics, the logistic map as a model of biological population size is not derived from direct experimental results or universally valid principles . Although there is some rationality in the way it is derived, it is essentially a \"model\" thought up in one's mind . May, who made the logistic map famous, did not claim that the model he was discussing accurately represented the increase and decrease in population size . Historically, continuous-time models based on differential equations have been widely used in the study of biological population dynamics, and the application of these continuous-time models has deepened our understanding of biological population dynamics . As a discrete-time population model that takes into account density effects, the Ricker model, in which the population size is not negative, is more realistic .\nGenerally speaking, mathematical models can provide important qualitative information about population dynamics, but their results should not be taken too seriously without experimental support . Even if the conclusions of mathematical models deviate from those of biological studies, mathematical modeling is still useful because it can provide a useful control. Biological issues may be raised by reviewing the model construction process and settings, or the biological knowledge and assumptions that the model is based on. Although the logistic map is too simple to be realistic as a population model, its results suggest that a variety of population fluctuations may occur due to the dynamics inherent in the population itself, regardless of random influences from the environment. \nApplications.\nCoupled map system.\nThe degree of freedom or dimension of a one-variable logistic map as a system is one . On the other hand, in the real natural world, it is thought that there are many chaotic systems with many degrees of freedom, not only in time but also in space . Alternatively, the synchronization phenomenon of oscillators performing chaotic motion is also a research subject . To investigate such things, there is a method of coupled maps that couples many difference equations (maps) . The logistic map is often used as a subject of coupled map model research . The reason for this is that the logistic map itself has already been well investigated as a typical model of chaos, and there is an accumulation of research on it .\nThere are various methods for the specific coupling in the coupled map model . Suppose a total of N maps are coupled, and the state of the i-th map at time n is represented by formula_330 . In a method called globally coupled maps, formula_331 is formulated as follows :\nIn the current field of coupled oscillators, the simplest model is the following, in which two oscillators, x and y, are coupled by a difference in variables : \nIn these equations, f( x ) is the specific map to incorporate into the coupled map model, and applies here if the logistic map is used .\nIn equations ( 6-1 ) and ( 6-2 ), \u03b5 and D are parameters called coupling coefficients, which indicate the strength of the coupling between the maps . On the other hand, when the logistic map is incorporated into a coupled map model, the parameter a of the logistic map indicates the strength of the nonlinearity of the model . By changing the value of a and the value of \u03b5 or D, various phenomena appear in the coupled map system of logistic maps. For example, in model ( 6-2 ), when D is increased to a value Dc or more, x and y oscillate chaotically while synchronously . Even below Dc, not only do chaotic oscillations occur in a continuous manner . When D is in a certain range, x and y oscillate with two periods even though r = 4 . When a = 3.8, behavior in which synchronous and asynchronous states alternate continuously is also observed .\nIn a study of the application of the logistic map to a globally coupled map with a large degree of freedom ( 6-1 ), a phenomenon called chaotic itinerancy was found . This is a phenomenon in which the orbit traverses a region in phase space that is said to be the remains of an attractor, repeating the cycle from an orderly state in which several clusters oscillate together to a disordered state, then to another cluster state, then back to the disordered state again, and so on . \nPseudorandom number generator.\nIn the fields of computer simulation and information security, the creation of pseudorandom numbers using a computer is an important technique, and one of the methods for generating pseudorandom numbers is the use of chaos. Although a pseudorandom number generator based on chaos with sufficient performance has not yet been realized, several methods have been proposed. Several researchers have also investigated the possibility of creating a pseudorandom number generator based on chaos for the logistic map. \nParameter r = 4 is often used for pseudorandom number generation using the logistic map. Historically, as described below, in 1947, shortly after the birth of electronic computers, Stanis\u0142aw Ulam and John von Neumann also pointed out the possibility of a pseudorandom number generator using the logistic map with r = 4. However, the distribution of points for the logistic map formula_332 is as shown in equation ( 3-17 ), and the numbers that are generated are biased toward 0 and 1. Therefore, some processing is required to obtain unbiased uniform random numbers. Methods for doing so include:\nA method for converting the obtained values to a uniform distribution using the tent map ( 4-8 ). \nThe resulting number is converted to either 0 or 1 using a threshold, as in the coin tossing analogy above, and this process is repeated to obtain a uniformly random bit string. \nIn addition, the sequences formula_9 and formula_334 obtained by the logistic map are strongly correlated, which makes it problematic for pseudorandom sequences. One way to solve this is to generate the sequence formula_335 for each iteration of the map, rather than generating the sequence formula_336 for some number of iterations \u03c4 &gt; 1. For example, it is said that good pseudorandom numbers can be obtained for method 1 with \u03c4 &gt; 10 or \u03c4 &gt; 13, and for method 2 with \u03c4 &gt; 16. \nA common problem with digitally calculating chaos using a computer is that, because a computer has a finite calculation precision, it is in principle impossible to obtain a truly aperiodic sequence, which is the nature of chaos, and instead outputs a finite periodic sequence. Even if aperiodic sequences cannot be obtained in principle, sequences with as long a period as possible are desirable for generating pseudorandom numbers. However, when the periodicity of the sequence actually output by the logistic map formula_248 in single-precision floating-point calculations was investigated, it was reported that the period of the sequence actually output is much smaller than the maximum period possible from the number of bits allocated, and from this point of view, it has been pointed out that pseudorandom number generation by the logistic map is inferior to existing pseudorandom number generators such as the Mersenne Twister. In addition, with the logistic map, formula_248 there is a risk that the value will fall to the fixed point 0 during the calculation and remain constant. On the other hand, the logistic map always takes values in the open interval (0, 1), so it can be calculated without problems not only with floating point but also with fixed point, and can enjoy the advantages of fixed point arithmetic. It has been pointed out that fixed point has a longer period than floating point for the same number of bits, and that unintended convergence to 0 can be eliminated. \nExtension to complex numbers.\nDynamical systems defined by complex analytic functions are also of interest. An example is the dynamical system defined by the quadratic function: \n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Numbered block/styles.css\" /&gt;\nwhere the parameter c and the variable z are complex numbers. This map is essentially the same as the logistic map (1\u20132). As mentioned above, the map (6\u20133) is topologically conjugate to the logistic map (1\u20132) through a linear function. \nWhen the iteration of the map (6\u20133) is calculated with a fixed parameter c and varying the initial value formula_339, a set of formula_339 such that formula_341 does not diverge to infinity as n \u2192 \u221e is called a filled Julia set. Furthermore, the boundary of a filled Julia set is called a Julia set. When the iteration of the map (6\u20133) is calculated with a fixed initial value formula_342 and varying the parameter c, a set of c such that z does not diverge to infinity is called a Mandelbrot set. The Julia sets and Mandelbrot sets of the map (6\u20133) generate fractal figures that are described as \"mystical looking\" and \"extremely mysterious\". \nIn particular, in the Mandelbrot set, each disk in the diagram corresponds to a region of asymptotically stable periodic orbits of a certain period. By juxtaposing the logistic map orbit diagram with the Mandelbrot set diagram, it is possible to see that the asymptotically stable fixed points, period doubling bifurcations, and period-three windows of the logistic map orbit diagram correspond on the real axis to the Mandelbrot set diagram. \nWhen there is a time delay.\nIf we interpret the logistic map as a model of the population of each generation of organisms, it is possible that the population of the next generation will affect not only the population of the current generation, but also the population of the generation before that. An example of such a case is\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Numbered block/styles.css\" /&gt;\nwhere the number of individuals in the previous generation, formula_343, is included in the equation as a negative density effect . If formula_344, then equation ( 6-4 ) can be replaced by the following two-variable difference equation .\nThis dynamical system is used to study bifurcation of quasi-periodic attractors and is called the delayed logistic map . The delayed logistic map exhibits a Neimark\u2013Sacker bifurcation at r = 2, where the asymptotically stable fixed point becomes unstable and an asymptotically stable invariant curve forms around the unstable fixed point .\nResearch history.\nBefore Chaos was named.\nBefore the iteration of maps became relevant to dynamical systems, mathematicians Gaston Julia and Pierre Fatou studied the iteration of complex functions. Julia and Fatou's work was broad, focusing on analytic functions. In particular, they studied the behavior of the following complex quadratic function, also shown in equation (6\u20133), in the 1920s. \n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Numbered block/styles.css\" /&gt;\nJulia and Fatu also recognized chaotic behavior in Julia sets, but because there was no computer graphics at the time, no one followed suit and their research stalled. Research on complex dynamical systems then declined until the late 1970s, and it was not until the appearance of Benoit Mandelbrot and others that the rich dynamical behavior exhibited by maps on the complex plane was noticed. \nIn 1947, mathematicians Stanislaw Ulam and John von Neumann wrote a short paper entitled \"On combination of stochastic and deterministic processes\" in which they\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Numbered block/styles.css\" /&gt;\nThey pointed out that pseudorandom numbers can be generated by the repeated composition of quadratic functions such as. In modern terms, this equation corresponds to the logistic map with r = 4. At that time, the word \"chaos\" had not yet been used, but Ulam and von Neumann were already paying attention to the generation of complex sequences using nonlinear functions. In their report, Ulam and von Neumann also clarified that the map (7\u20132) and the tent map are topologically conjugate, and that the invariant measure of the sequence of this map is given by equation (3\u201317).\nThere have since been some detailed investigations of quadratic maps of the form with arbitrary parameter a. Between 1958 and 1963, Finnish mathematician Pekka Mylberg developed the\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Numbered block/styles.css\" /&gt;\nThis line of research is essential for dynamical systems, and M\u00fchlberg has also investigated the period-doubling branching cascades of this map, showing the existence of an accumulation point \u03bb = 1.401155189... Others, such as the work of the Soviet Oleksandr Sharkovsky in 1964, the French Igor Gumowski and Christian Mila in 1969, and Nicholas Metropolis in 1973, have revealed anomalous behavior of simple one-variable difference equations such as the logistic map. \nRobert May's research.\nLater, in the early 1970s, mathematical biologist Robert May encountered the model of equation (1\u20132) while working on an ecological problem. May introduced equation (1\u20132), i.e., the logistic map, by discretizing the logistic equation in time. He mathematically analyzed the behavior of the logistic map, and published his results in 1973 and 1974. Numerical experiments were performed on the logistic map to investigate the change in its behavior depending on the parameter r. \nIn 1976, he published a paper in \"Nature\" entitled \"Simple mathematical models with very complicated dynamics\". This paper was a review paper that focused on the logistic map and emphasized and drew attention to the fact that even simple nonlinear functions can produce extremely complex behaviors such as period-doubling bifurcation cascades and chaos. This paper in particular caused a great stir and was accepted by the scientific community due to May's status as a mathematical biologist, the clarity of his research results, and above all, the shocking content that a simple parabolic equation can produce surprisingly complex behavior. Through May's research, the logistic map attracted many researchers to chaos research and became such a famous mathematical model that it is said to have restarted the flow of chaos research. \nAfter May's research.\nMay also drew attention to the paper by using the term \"chaos\", which was used by Tien-Yen Li and James York in their paper \"Period three implies chaos\". Although some disagree, Li and York's paper is considered the first to use the word \"chaos\" as a mathematical term, and is credited with coining the term \"chaos\" to refer to deterministic, chaotic behavior. Li and York completed the paper in 1973, but when they submitted it to \"The American Mathematical Monthly\", they were told that it was too technical and that it should be significantly rewritten to make it easier to understand, and it was rejected. The paper was then left unrevised. However, the following year, in 1974, May came to give a special guest lecture at the University of Maryland where Lee and York were working, and talked about the logistic map. At the time, May did not yet understand what was happening in the chaotic domain of the logistic map, but Lee and York were also unaware of the period-doubling cascade of the logistic map. Excited by May's talk, Lee and York caught up with May after the lecture and told him about their results, which surprised May. Lee and York quickly rewrote the rejected paper, and the resubmitted paper was published in 1975. \nAlso, around 1975, mathematical physicist Mitchell Feigenbaum noticed a scaling law in which the branching values converged in a geometric progression when he looked at the period-doubling cascade of the logistic map, and discovered the existence of a constant, now called the Feigenbaum constant, through numerical experiments. May and George Oster had also noticed the scaling law, but they were unable to follow it in depth. Feigenbaum discovered that the same constant also appeared in the sine map shown in equation (4\u20131), and realized that this scaling law had a universality that went beyond the logistic map. In 1980, a rigorous proof of this result was given by Pierre Coll\u00e9, Jean-Pierre Eckman, Oscar Rumford, and others. At about the same time as Feigenbaum, or later, physicists discovered the same period doubling cascade and the Feigenbaum constant in real life, and chaos, which had previously been seen as a strictly mathematical phenomenon, had a major impact on the field of physics as well. \nHowever, there is criticism of the tendency to downplay research results from before the popularity of chaos, and to attribute many of those results to rediscoverers who used the logistic map, etc. May himself respects the existence of previous research, but positions his own achievement as not being \"the first to independently discover the strange mathematical behavior of quadratic maps\", but as being one of the \"last researchers to emphasize their broad implications in science\". Mathematician Robert Devaney states the following before explaining the logistic map in his book:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "18138", "revid": "24902", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18138", "title": "Levant", "text": "Region in the Eastern Mediterranean\nThe Levant ( , ) is a subregion of West Asia along the Eastern Mediterranean, that forms part of the Middle East. The term is often used in conjunction with historical or cultural references.\nIn its narrowest sense, used in archaeology and other contexts, the Levant refers to Cyprus and land bordering the Mediterranean Sea in West Asia that includes the Syria region, Lebanon, Jordan, Palestine, Israel, and south Cilicia (Turkey). In its widest historical sense, the Levant included all the Eastern Mediterranean; extending from Greece to Egypt and Cyrenaica (Eastern Libya). The Levant represents the land bridge between Africa and Eurasia, has been described as the crossroads of West Asia, Eastern Mediterranean, and Northeast Africa, and geologically as the \"northwest of the Arabian plate\".\nIn the 13th and 14th centuries, \"levante\" was used for Italian maritime commerce in the Eastern Mediterranean, including Greece, Anatolia, Syria-Palestine, and Egypt, that is the lands east of Venice. It derives from the Italian , meaning \"rising\", implying the rising of the Sun in the east, and is broadly equivalent to \"Mashriq\" (, ), meaning \"eastern place, where the Sun rises\". Eventually the term was restricted to the Muslim countries of Syria-Palestine and Egypt. The term entered English in the 15th century from French. In 1581, England set up the Levant Company to trade with the Ottoman Empire. The name \"Levant States\" was used to refer to the French mandate over Syria and Lebanon after World War I, so \"Levant\" has come to refer to modern Syria, Lebanon, Palestine, Israel, Jordan, and Cyprus.\nAs a name for the contemporary region, several dictionaries consider \"Levant\" to be archaic. The noun \"Levant\" and adjective \"Levantine\" are sometimes used to describe the ancient and modern culture area formerly called Syro-Palestinian. Archaeologists now speak of the Levant and Levantine archaeology, food scholars of Levantine cuisine, and Latin Catholics of the Levant are sometimes called \"Levantines\", though the term is normally used to describe the Levant population more widely.\nEtymology.\nThe term \"Levant\" appears in English in 1497, and originally meant 'the East' or 'Mediterranean lands east of Italy'. It is borrowed from the French 'rising', referring to the rising of the sun in the east, or the point where the sun rises. The phrase is ultimately from the Latin word , meaning 'lift, raise'. Similar etymologies are found in Greek \"Anatol\u0113\" (\"cf.\" Anatolia 'the direction of sunrise'), in Germanic \"Morgenland\" (lit.\u2009'morning land'), in Italian (as in \"Riviera di Levante\", the portion of the Liguria coast east of Genoa), in Hungarian \"Kelet\" ('east'), in Spanish and Catalan \"Levante\" and \"Llevant\" ('the place of rising'), and in Hebrew \"mizra\u1e25\" ('east'). Most notably, \"Orient\" and its Latin source \"oriens\" meaning 'east', is literally \"rising\", deriving from Latin \"orior\" 'rise'.\nThe notion of the Levant has undergone a dynamic process of historical evolution in usage, meaning, and understanding. While the term \"Levantine\" originally referred to the European residents of the eastern Mediterranean region, it later came to refer to regional \"native\" and \"minority\" groups.\nThe term became current in English in the 16th century, along with the first English merchant adventurers in the region; English ships appeared in the Mediterranean in the 1570s, and the English merchant company signed its agreement (\"capitulations\") with the Ottoman Sultan in 1579. The English Levant Company was founded in 1581 to trade with the Ottoman Empire, and in 1670 the French Compagnie du Levant was founded for the same purpose. At this time, the Far East was known as the \"Upper Levant\".\nIn early 19th-century travel writing, the term sometimes incorporated certain Mediterranean provinces of the Ottoman Empire, as well as independent Greece (and especially the Greek islands). In 19th-century archaeology, it referred to overlapping cultures in this region during and after prehistoric times, intending to reference the place instead of any one culture. The French mandate of Syria and Lebanon (1920\u20131946) was called the Levant states.\nGeography and modern-day use of the term.\nToday, \"Levant\" is the term typically used by archaeologists and historians with reference to the history of the region. Scholars have adopted the term Levant to identify the region due to its being a \"wider, yet relevant, cultural corpus\" that does not have the \"political overtones\" of Syria-Palestine. The term is also used for modern events, peoples, states or parts of states in the same region, namely Cyprus, Egypt, Iraq, Israel, Jordan, Lebanon, Palestine, Syria, and Turkey are sometimes considered Levant countries (compare with Near East, Middle East, Eastern Mediterranean and West Asia). Several researchers include the island of Cyprus in Levantine studies, including the Council for British Research in the Levant, the UCLA Near Eastern Languages and Cultures department, \"Journal of Levantine Studies\" and the UCL Institute of Archaeology, the last of which has dated the connection between Cyprus and mainland Levant to the early Iron Age. Archaeologists seeking a neutral orientation that is neither biblical nor national have used terms such as Levantine archaeology and archaeology of the Southern Levant.\nWhile the usage of the term \"Levant\" in academia has been restricted to the fields of archeology and literature, there is a recent attempt to reclaim the notion of the Levant as a category of analysis in political and social sciences. Two academic journals were launched in the early 2010s using the word: the \"Journal of Levantine Studies\", published by the Van Leer Jerusalem Institute and \"The Levantine Review\", published by Boston College.\nThe word \"Levant\" has been used in some translations of the term \"ash-Sh\u0101m\" as used by the organization known as ISIL, ISIS, and other names, though there is disagreement as to whether this translation is accurate.\nIn archaeology: a definition.\nIn \"The Oxford Handbook of the Archaeology of the Levant: c. 8000\u2013332 BCE\" (OHAL; 2013), the definition of the Levant for the specific purposes of the book is synonymous to that of the Arabic \"\"bilad al-sham\", 'the land of sham [Syria]'\", translating in Western parlance to greater Syria. OHAL defines the boundaries of the Levant as follows.\nA distinction is made between the main subregions of the Levant, the northern and the southern:\nThe island of Cyprus is also included as a third subregion in the archaeological region of the Levant:\nDemographics.\nThe region is inhabited by Levantine Arabs, Bedouins, Jews, Kurds, Maronites, Assyrians, Armenians, Chechens and Circassians. The population of the modern Levant border is approximately 57.6 million consisting of the populations of Syria, Jordan, Israel, Lebanon and Palestine.\nReligious and ethnic groups.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Module:Historical populations/styles.css\"/&gt;\nThe majority of Levantines are Muslims. Islam was first introduced into the region following the Muslim conquest of the Levant in the 7th century; however, a Muslim majority was only reached by the 13th century. The majority of Levantine Muslims are Sunnis adhering to the four madhhabs (Hanafi, Shafi'i, Hanbali and Maliki). Islamic minorities include the Alawites and Nizari Ismailis in Syria, and Twelver Shiites in Lebanon.\nAs the birthplace of Christianity, the Levant has many Christians belonging to various churches, mainly the Greek Orthodox (Antiochian), Syriac Orthodox, and various Eastern Catholic (Syriac Catholic, Melkite and Maronite) churches. Armenians mostly belong to the Armenian Apostolic Church. There are also Assyrians belonging to the Assyrian Church of the East and the Chaldean Catholic Church.\nOther religious groups in the Levant include Jews, Samaritans, Yazidis in Iraq, and Druze in Syria and Lebanon.\nLanguages.\nMost populations in the Levant speak Levantine Arabic (, ), a variety of Arabic descended from the pre-Islamic Arabic dialects of Syria and Hejazi Arabic, but retaining significant influence from Western Middle Aramaic. Levantine Arabic is usually classified as North Levantine Arabic in Lebanon, Syria, and parts of Turkey, and South Levantine Arabic in Palestine and Jordan. Each of these encompasses a spectrum of regional or urban/rural variations. In addition to the varieties normally grouped together as \"Levantine\", a number of other varieties and dialects of Arabic are spoken in the Levant area, such as Levantine Bedawi Arabic (by Bedouins) and Mesopotamian Arabic (in eastern Syria).\nOf the languages of Cyprus, the two official languages are Turkish and Greek. The most used languages by population are Greek in the south followed by Turkish in the north. Two minority languages are recognized: Armenian, and Cypriot Maronite Arabic, a hybrid of mostly medieval Arabic vernaculars with strong influence from contact with Turkish and Greek, spoken by approximately 1,000 people.\nIn Israel, the official language is Hebrew, which is spoken by the majority of its population. Its Arab minority speaks the Arabic language.\nWestern Neo-Aramaic is additionally spoken in three villages in Syria: Maaloula, Jubb'adin and Bakhah.\nAmong diaspora communities based in the Levant, Greek, Armenian and Circassian are also spoken.\nGenetics.\nAncient DNA analysis has confirmed the genetic relationship between Natufians and other ancient and modern Middle Easterners. The presence of Neolithic Anatolian and Neolithic Iranian ancestry among modern Levantines can be attributed to migrations during the Neolithic and Bronze Ages.\nAccording to recent ancient DNA studies, Levantines derive most of their ancestry from ancient Semitic-speaking peoples of the Bronze and Iron age Levant. Other Arabs include the Bedouins of Syrian Desert, Naqab and eastern Syria, who speak Bedouin Arabic. Non-Arab minorities include Circassians, Chechens, Turks, Jews, Turkmens, Assyrians, Kurds, Nawars and Armenians.\nSee also.\nOverlapping regional designations\nSubregional designations\nOthers\n\"Other places in the east of a larger region\"\nExplanatory notes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nGeneral and cited references.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

These mandates served as legal documents establishing the internationally agreed terms for administering the territory on behalf of the League of Nations. Combining elements of both a treaty and a constitution, these mandates contained minority rights clauses that provided for the rights of petition and adjudication by the Permanent Court of International Justice.\nThe mandate system was established under Article 22 of the Covenant of the League of Nations, entered into force on 28 June 1919. Two governing principles formed the core of the Mandate System, being non-annexation of the territory and its administration as a \"sacred trust of civilisation\" to develop the territory for the benefit of its native people.\nAccording to historian Susan Pedersen, colonial administration in the mandates did not differ substantially from colonial administration elsewhere. Even though the Covenant of the League committed the great powers to govern the mandates differently, the main difference appeared to be that the colonial powers spoke differently about the mandates than their other colonial possessions.\nWith the dissolution of the League of Nations after World War\u00a0II, it was stipulated at the Yalta Conference that the remaining mandates should be placed under the trusteeship of the United Nations, subject to future discussions and formal agreements. Most of the remaining mandates of the League of Nations (with the exception of South West Africa) thus eventually became United Nations trust territories.\nBasis.\nThe mandate system was established by Article 22 of the Covenant of the League of Nations, drafted by the victors of World War I. The article referred to territories which after the war were no longer ruled by their previous sovereign, but their peoples were not considered \"able to stand by themselves under the strenuous conditions of the modern world\". The article called for such people's tutelage to be \"entrusted to advanced nations who by reason of their resources, their experience or their geographical position can best undertake this responsibility\".\nU.S. President Woodrow Wilson and South African General Jan Smuts played influential roles in pushing for the establishment of a mandates system. The mandates system reflected a compromise between Smuts (who wanted colonial powers to annex the territories) and Wilson (who wanted trusteeship over the territories).\nGeneralities.\nAll of the territories subject to League of Nations mandates were previously controlled by states defeated in World War I, principally Imperial Germany and the Ottoman Empire. The mandates were fundamentally different from the protectorates in that the mandatory power undertook obligations to the inhabitants of the territory and to the League of Nations.\nThe process of establishing the mandates consisted of two phases:\nTreaties.\nThe divestiture of Germany's overseas colonies, along with three territories disentangled from its European homeland area (the Free City of Danzig, the Memel Territory, and the Saar), was accomplished in the Treaty of Versailles (1919), with the territories being allotted among the Allies on 7 May of that year. Ottoman territorial claims were first addressed in the Treaty of S\u00e8vres (1920) and finalised in the Treaty of Lausanne (1923). The Ottoman territories were allotted among the Allied Powers at the San Remo conference in 1920.\nTypes of mandates.\nThe League of Nations decided the exact level of control by the mandatory power over each mandate on an individual basis. However, in every case the mandatory power was forbidden to construct fortifications or raise an army within the territory of the mandate, and was required to present an annual report on the territory to the Permanent Mandates Commission of the League of Nations.\nThe mandates were divided into three distinct groups based upon the level of development each population had achieved at that time.\nClass A mandates.\nThe first group, or \"Class A mandates\", were territories formerly controlled by the Ottoman Empire that were deemed to \"... have reached a stage of development where their existence as independent nations can be provisionally recognised subject to the rendering of administrative advice and assistance by a Mandatory until such time as they are able to stand alone. The wishes of these communities must be a principal consideration in the selection of the Mandatory.\"\nClass B mandates.\nThe second group of mandates, or \"Class B mandates\", were all former German colonies in West and Central Africa, referred to by Germany as (protectorates or territories), which were deemed to require a greater level of control by the mandatory power: \"...the Mandatory must be responsible for the administration of the territory under conditions which will guarantee freedom of conscience and religion.\" The mandatory power was forbidden to construct military or naval bases within the mandates.\nClass C mandates.\n\"Class C mandates\", including South West Africa and the South Pacific Islands, were considered to be \"best administered under the laws of the Mandatory as integral portions of its territory.\"\nRules of establishment.\nAccording to the Council of the League of Nations, meeting of August 1920: \"draft mandates adopted by the Allied and Associated Powers would not be definitive until they had been considered and approved by the League... the legal title held by the mandatory Power must be a double one: one conferred by the Principal Powers and the other conferred by the League of Nations.\"\nThree steps were required to establish a Mandate under international law: (1) The Principal Allied and Associated Powers confer a mandate on one of their number or on a third power; (2) the principal powers officially notify the council of the League of Nations that a certain power has been appointed mandatory for such a certain defined territory; and (3) the council of the League of Nations takes official cognisance of the appointment of the mandatory power and informs the latter that it [the council] considers it as invested with the mandate, and at the same time notifies it of the terms of the mandate, after ascertaining whether they are in conformance with the provisions of the covenant.\"\nThe U.S. State Department's \"Digest of International Law\" says that the terms of the Treaty of Lausanne provided for the application of the principles of state succession to the \"A\" Mandates. The Treaty of Versailles provisionally recognised the former Ottoman communities as independent nations. It also required Germany to recognise the disposition of the former Ottoman territories and to recognise the new states laid down within their boundaries. The terms of the Treaty of Lausanne required the newly created states that acquired the territory detached from the Ottoman Empire to pay annuities on the Ottoman public debt and to assume responsibility for the administration of concessions that had been granted by the Ottomans. The treaty also let the States acquire, without payment, all the property and possessions of the Ottoman Empire situated within their territory. The treaty provided that the League of Nations was responsible for establishing an arbitral court to resolve disputes that might arise and stipulated that its decisions were final.\nA disagreement regarding the legal status and the portion of the annuities to be paid by the \"A\" mandates was settled when an Arbitrator ruled that some of the mandates contained more than one State:The difficulty arises here how one is to regard the Asiatic countries under the British and French mandates. Iraq is a Kingdom in regard to which Great Britain has undertaken responsibilities equivalent to those of a Mandatory Power. Under the British mandate, Palestine and Transjordan have each an entirely separate organisation. We are, therefore, in the presence of three States sufficiently separate to be considered as distinct Parties. France has received a single mandate from the Council of the League of Nations, but in the countries subject to that mandate, one can distinguish two distinct States: Syria and the Lebanon, each State possessing its own constitution and a nationality clearly different from the other.\nLater history.\nAfter the United Nations was founded in 1945 and the League of Nations was disbanded, all but one of the mandated territories became United Nations trust territories, a roughly equivalent status. In each case, the colonial power that held the mandate on each territory became the administering power of the trusteeship, except that of the Empire of Japan, which had been defeated in World War II, lost its mandate over the South Pacific islands, which became a \"strategic trust territory\" known as the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands under U.S. administration.\nThe sole exception to the transformation of the League of Nations mandates into UN trusteeships was that of South Africa and its mandated territory South West Africa. Rather than placing South West Africa under trusteeship like other former mandates, South Africa proposed annexation, a proposition rejected by the UN General Assembly. Despite South Africa's resistance, the International Court of Justice affirmed that South Africa continued to have international obligations regarding the South West Africa mandate. Eventually, in 1990, the mandated territory, now Namibia, gained independence, culminating from the Tripartite Accords and the resolution of the South African Border War \u2014 a prolonged guerrilla conflict against the apartheid regime that lasted from 1966 until 1990.\nNearly all the former League of Nations mandates had become sovereign states by 1990, including all of the former UN trust territories with the exception of a few successor entities of the gradually dismembered Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands (formerly Japan's South Pacific Trust Mandate). These exceptions include the Northern Mariana Islands which is a commonwealth in political union with the U.S. with the status of unincorporated organised territory. The Northern Mariana Islands does elect its own governor to serve as territorial head of government, but it remains a U.S. territory with its head of state being the President of the United States and federal funds to the commonwealth administered by the Office of Insular Affairs of the U.S. Department of the Interior.\nRemnant Micronesia and the Marshall Islands, the heirs of the last territories of the Trust, attained final independence on 22 December 1990. (The UN Security Council ratified termination of trusteeship, effectively dissolving trusteeship status, on 10 July 1987.) The Republic of Palau, split off from the Federated States of Micronesia, became the last to effectively gain its independence, on 1 October 1994.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Founded in 1934 when it was originally sanctioned by the American Motorcyclist Association (AMA), the race is one of the oldest motorcycle competitions in the United States. The competition changed locations over the years, starting as a dirt track race before evolving into a road race. From the late 1930s until the early 2000s, the Loudon Classic was one of the most prestigious motorcycle races in the United States, second only to the Daytona 200. \nHistory.\nRally beginnings.\nIn the 1910s the New Hampshire Lakes Region became a popular riding destination for early motorcycle enthusiasts. Unlike the Sturgis Motorcycle Rally which originated as a motorcycle race, the Loudon Classic originated as a motorcycle rally. When motorcycle sales began to decline as a result of the introduction of the low cost Ford Model T, the American motorcycle industry body, the Federation of American Motorcyclists (FAM) sought to boost sales by sponsoring a series of Gypsy tours, so called because the participants camped in large gatherings like Romani people. The annual tour held at Weirs Beach in Laconia, New Hampshire on the southern shore of Lake Winnipesaukee, became the most popular of these tours due to its proximity to Boston, New York, Philadelphia and Montreal.\nDirt track roots.\nIn 1933, the AMA introduced a new racing category called Class C which featured street-legal motorcycles in an effort to make motorcycle racing less expensive for ordinary motorcyclists. Street-legal motorcycles were known at the time as touring motorcycles hence, a tourist trophy (TT) signified a race classification for street-legal motorcycles. Informal motorcycle racing had occurred at previous Weirs Beach rallies however, the first race formally sanctioned by the American Motorcyclist Association (AMA), occurred in 1934 when, a dirt track TT race for Class C motorcycles was held on a 3.3 mile track in Swanzey, New Hampshire that used partially paved and unimproved gravel roads, up and down gently rolling hills. Local rider Babe Tancrede won the inaugural Laconia Classic riding a Harley-Davidson.\nBelknap circuit.\nIn 1937 the race moved to Old Orchard Beach, Maine where it was held as a event for only one year then, in 1938 it was moved to a 1.0-mile track in the Belknap Recreational Area, now known as the Gunstock Mountain Resort near Laconia, New Hampshire. The Belknap circuit featured crudely paved roads as well as improved gravel roads. Although the event became known as the Laconia Classic, the Belknap Recreational Area was located in nearby Gilford, New Hampshire. An integral promoter responsible for bringing the race to Belknap was Fritzie Baer, an Indian motorcycle dealer from Springfield, Massachusetts who would promote the race until 1963. \nAlong with the move to Belknap, the event was accredited national championship status by the AMA in 1938. Indian rider Ed Kretz, who had won the inaugural Daytona 200 in 1937, won the first national championship race held at Belknap in 1938. His victory marked the only 200 mile Laconia Classic as, the race distance was reduced to 100 miles in 1939. In 1940, the circuit was converted from dirt and gravel to a fully paved course and, the AMA changed the race classification from a TT national to a road race national. \nDick Klamfoth's 1951 Laconia Classic victory on a Norton marked the first win by a foreign manufacturer. Harley-Davidson rider Brad Andres was the most successful competitor during the Belknap era with four victories in five years between 1955 and 1959. Three-time Grand National Champion Joe Leonard won the event three times before going on to a successful auto racing career. Harley-Davidson would win 13 of the 20 races held at Belknap, despite the track being near the Springfield, Massachusetts factory of their largest competitor, Indian motorcycles. \nThe event surged in popularity after the Second World War drawing increasingly larger crowds of spectators. The race grew to become a weeklong event known as Laconia Motorcycle Week that was the largest annual gathering of North American motorcyclists, until it was overtaken by the Sturgis Motorcycle Rally during the 1970s. When the overwhelming number of spectators created a rash of minor incidents in 1963, local residents protested the event. Unwilling to risk the increasing costs of property damage, and unable to reach an agreement with local officials, race promoters closed the Belknap track in 1964. The final race at the Belknap circuit held in 1963 was won by Jody Nicholas riding a BSA motorcycle.\nBryar Motorsports Park.\nThe closure of the Belknap circuit resulted in the construction of the new 1.6-mile Bryar Motorsports Park in 1965, located 20 miles south of Laconia in Loudon, New Hampshire. The Laconia Classic gradually became known as the Loudon Classic. The Bryar Motorsports Park track road course followed the contours of a hillside around a small lake. Compressing 11 turns within its 1.6-mile length, the track was short and tight, making it one of the best venues to watch motorcycle racing in the United States. Slight elevation changes in the track layout allowed many spectators to follow a racer for a complete lap of the circuit. \nThe track developed a reputation for its challenging nature as, riders were constantly applying throttle or their brakes for the entire lap. It rewarded a rider's skill over horsepower and its many turns allowed for aggressive racing. The circuit hosted numerous amateur races during the year which bred many local track experts who often provided challenging competition for national championship level riders when they arrived for the annual Loudon Classic.\nGary Nixon and Mike Baldwin were the most successful competitors during the Bryar Motorsports era, each with four victories. When Gary Fisher won the race in 1972 riding a Yamaha, he joined his father, 1953 Laconia Classic winner Ed Fisher, as the only father son duo to have won the race. His victory aboard a Yamaha also marked the first victory by a Japanese manufacturer in the history of the event. Fisher's 1972 victory marked the last 100-mile national as, the race distance was reduced to 75-miles for 1973. Carter Alsop became the first female competitor in an AMA professional road race when she entered the Novice Class at the 1977 Loudon Classic. Jamie James won the final race on the Bryar Motorsports Park circuit in 1989 before it was purchased by Bob Bahre, who built the New Hampshire Motor Speedway in its place.\nNew Hampshire Motor Speedway.\nConstruction of the New Hampshire Motor Speedway was completed in 1990. The Loudon Classic continued as a national championship race at the new speedway until 2001 however, a combination of safety issues and more powerful motorcycles eventually made the track obsolete for AMA Superbike events. Eric Bostrom won the final AMA National Championship race at Loudon in 2001. Since 2002 the race has continued featuring semi-professional racers.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It is the second-largest town by area in New Hampshire. The population was 1,631 at the 2020 census. The town is home to the New Hampshire Highland Games and to a portion of Franconia Notch State Park. Set in the White Mountains, large portions of the town are within the White Mountain National Forest. The Appalachian Trail crosses the western and northeastern parts of the town. Lincoln is the location of Loon Mountain Ski Resort and associated recreation-centered development.\nThe primary settlement in town, where 969 people resided at the 2020 census, is defined as the Lincoln census-designated place (CDP) and is located along New Hampshire Route 112 east of Interstate 93. The town also includes the former village sites of Stillwater and Zealand (sometimes known as Pullman) in the town's remote eastern and northern sections respectively, which are now within the White Mountain National Forest.\nHistory.\nIn 1764, colonial Governor Benning Wentworth granted to a group of approximately 70 land investors from Connecticut. Lincoln was named after Henry Fiennes Pelham-Clinton, 2nd Duke of Newcastle, 9th Earl of Lincoln \u2013 a cousin of the Wentworth governors. He held the position of comptroller of customs for the port of London under King George II and George III, which was important to trade between America and England.\nThe town was settled about 1782. The 1790 census indicates that it had 22 inhabitants. Rocky soil yielded poor farming, but the area's abundant timber, combined with water power to run sawmills on the Pemigewasset River and its East Branch, helped Lincoln develop into a center for logging. By 1853, the Merrimack River Lumber Company was operating. The railroad transported freight, and increasingly brought tourists to the beautiful mountain region. In 1892, James Everell Henry (1831\u20131912) bought approximately of virgin timber and established a logging enterprise at what is today the center of Lincoln. In 1902, he built a pulp and paper mill. He erected the Lincoln House hotel in 1903, although a 1907 fire would nearly raze the community. Until he died in 1912, Henry controlled his company town, installing relatives in positions of civic authority.\nIn 1917, Henry's heirs sold the business to the Parker Young Company, which in turn sold it to the Marcalus Manufacturing Company in 1946. Franconia Paper took over in 1950, producing 150 tons of paper a day until bankruptcy in 1971, at which time new river classification standards discouraged further papermaking in Lincoln.\nTourism is today the principal business. Nearby Loon Mountain has long drawn skiers, and in recent years has attempted to convert itself into a four-season attraction. The Flume is one of the most visited attractions in the state. Discovered in 1808, it is a natural canyon extending at the base of Mount Liberty. Walls of Conway granite rise to a height of and are only apart.\nGeography.\nAccording to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which are land and are water, comprising 0.43% of the town. It is the second-largest town in area in New Hampshire, after Pittsburg.\nLincoln is drained by the Pemigewasset River and its East Branch. Lincoln lies almost fully within the Merrimack River watershed, with the western edge of town in the Connecticut River watershed. Kancamagus Pass, elevation , is on the Kancamagus Highway at the eastern boundary. The highest point in Lincoln is the summit of Mount Bond at above sea level.\nDemographics.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"US Census population/styles.css\"/&gt;\nAs of the census of 2010, there were 1,662 people, 794 households, and 439 families residing in the town. There were 2,988 housing units, of which 2,194, or 73.4%, were vacant. 2,083 of the vacant units were for seasonal or recreational use. The racial makeup of the town was 96.9% white, 0.3% African American, 0.1% Native American, 1.7% Asian, 0.0% Native Hawaiian or Pacific Islander, 0.3% some other race, and 0.6% from two or more races. 1.7% of the population were Hispanic or Latino of any race.\nOf the 794 households, 21.5% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 43.1% were headed by married couples living together, 7.8% had a female householder with no husband present, and 44.7% were non-families. Of all households, 37.0% were made up of individuals, and 13.4% were someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.09, and the average family size was 2.75.\nIn the town, 18.7% of the population were under the age of 18, 6.8% were from 18 to 24, 19.4% from 25 to 44, 34.8% from 45 to 64, and 20.4% were 65 years of age or older.

The coherency, high monochromaticity, and ability to reach extremely high powers are all properties which allow for these specialized applications.\nScientific.\nIn science, lasers are used in many ways, including:\nLasers may also be indirectly used in spectroscopy as a micro-sampling system, a technique termed Laser ablation (LA), which is typically applied to ICP-MS apparatus resulting in the powerful LA-ICP-MS.\nThe principles of laser spectroscopy are discussed by Demtr\u00f6der.\nSpectroscopy.\nMost types of laser are an inherently pure source of light; they emit near-monochromatic light with a very well defined range of wavelengths. By careful design of the laser components, the purity of the laser light (measured as the \"linewidth\") can be improved more than the purity of any other light source. This makes the laser a very useful source for spectroscopy. The high intensity of light that can be achieved in a small, well collimated beam can also be used to induce a nonlinear optical effect in a sample, which makes techniques such as Raman spectroscopy possible. Other spectroscopic techniques based on lasers can be used to make extremely sensitive detectors of various molecules, able to measure molecular concentrations in the parts-per-1012 (ppt) level. Due to the high power densities achievable by lasers, beam-induced atomic emission is possible: this technique is termed Laser induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS).\nHeat treatment.\nHeat treating with the lasers allows selective surface hardening against wear with little or no distortion of the component. Because this eliminates much part reworking that is currently done, the laser system's capital cost is recovered in a short time. An inert, absorbent coating for laser heat treatment has also been developed that eliminates the fumes generated by conventional paint coatings during the heat-treating process with CO2 laser beams.\nOne consideration crucial to the success of a heat treatment operation is control of the laser beam irradiance on the part surface. The optimal irradiance distribution is driven by the thermodynamics of the laser-material interaction and by the part geometry.\nTypically, irradiances between 500 and 5000 W/cm^2 satisfy the thermodynamic constraints and allow the rapid surface heating and minimal total heat input required. For general heat treatment, a uniform square or rectangular beam is one of the best options. For some special applications or applications where the heat treatment is done on an edge or corner of the part, it may be better to have the irradiance decrease near the edge to prevent melting.\nWeather.\nResearch shows that scientists may one day be able to induce rain and lightning storms (as well as micro-manipulating some other weather phenomena) using high energy lasers. Such a breakthrough could potentially eradicate droughts, help alleviate weather related catastrophes, and allocate weather resources to areas in need.\nLunar laser ranging.\nWhen the Apollo astronauts visited the Moon, they planted retroreflector arrays to make possible the Lunar Laser Ranging Experiment. Laser beams are focused through large telescopes on Earth aimed toward the arrays, and the time taken for the beam to be reflected back to Earth measured to determine the distance between the Earth and Moon with high accuracy.\nPhotochemistry.\nSome laser systems, through the process of mode locking, can produce extremely brief pulses of light - as short as picoseconds or femtoseconds (10\u221212 - 10\u221215 seconds). Such pulses can be used to initiate and analyze chemical reactions, a technique known as \"photochemistry\". The short pulses can be used to probe the process of the reaction at a very high temporal resolution, allowing the detection of short-lived intermediate molecules. This method is particularly useful in biochemistry, where it is used to analyse details of protein folding and function.\nLaser scanner.\nLaser barcode scanners are ideal for applications that require high speed reading of linear codes or stacked symbols.\nLaser cooling.\nA technique that has recent success is \"laser cooling\". This involves atom trapping, a method where a number of atoms are confined in a specially shaped arrangement of electric and magnetic fields. Shining particular wavelengths of light at the ions or atoms slows them down, thus \"cooling\" them. As this process is continued, they all are slowed and have the same energy level, forming an unusual arrangement of matter known as a Bose\u2013Einstein condensate.\nNuclear fusion.\nSome of the world's most powerful and complex arrangements of multiple lasers and optical amplifiers are used to produce extremely high intensity pulses of light of extremely short duration, e.g. laboratory for laser energetics, National Ignition Facility, GEKKO XII, Nike laser, Laser M\u00e9gajoule, HiPER. These pulses are arranged such that they impact pellets of tritium\u2013deuterium simultaneously from all directions, hoping that the squeezing effect of the impacts will induce atomic fusion in the pellets. This technique, known as \"inertial confinement fusion\", so far has not been able to achieve \"breakeven\", that is, so far the fusion reaction generates less power than is used to power the lasers, however; experiments at the National Ignition Facility were able to demonstrate fusion reactions that generate more energy than was contained within the lasers driving the reaction.\nParticle acceleration.\nPowerful lasers producing ultra-short (in the tens of femtoseconds) and ultra-intense (up to 1023 W/cm2) laser pulses offer much greater acceleration gradients than that of conventional accelerators. This fact is exploited in several plasma acceleration techniques used for accelerating both electrons and charged ions to high energies.\nMicroscopy.\nConfocal laser scanning microscopy and Two-photon excitation microscopy make use of lasers to obtain blur-free images of thick specimens at various depths. Laser capture microdissection use lasers to procure specific cell populations from a tissue section under microscopic visualization.\nAdditional laser microscopy techniques include harmonic microscopy, four-wave mixing microscopy and interferometric microscopy.\nMilitary.\nDirectly as an energy weapon.\nA laser weapon is directed-energy weapon based on lasers.\nDefensive countermeasures.\nDefensive countermeasure applications can range from compact, low power infrared countermeasures to high power, airborne laser systems. IR countermeasure systems use lasers to confuse the seeker heads on infrared homing missiles.\nDisorientation.\nSome weapons simply use a laser to disorient a person. One such weapon is the Thales Green Laser Optical Warner.\nGuidance.\nLaser guidance is a technique of guiding a missile or other projectile or vehicle to a target by means of a laser beam.\nTarget designator.\nAnother military use of lasers is as a \"laser target designator\". This is a low-power laser pointer used to indicate a target for a precision-guided munition, typically launched from an aircraft. The guided munition adjusts its flight-path to home in to the laser light reflected by the target, enabling a great precision in aiming. The beam of the laser target designator is set to a pulse rate that matches that set on the guided munition to ensure munitions strike their designated targets and do not follow other laser beams which may be in use in the area. The laser designator can be shone onto the target by an aircraft or nearby infantry. Lasers used for this purpose are usually infrared lasers, so the enemy cannot easily detect the guiding laser light.\nFirearms.\nLaser sight.\nThe laser has in most firearms applications been used as a tool to enhance the targeting of other weapon systems. For example, a laser sight is a small, usually visible-light laser placed on a handgun or a rifle and aligned to emit a beam parallel to the barrel. Since a laser beam has low divergence, the laser light appears as a small spot even at long distances; the user places the spot on the desired target and the barrel of the gun is aligned (but not necessarily allowing for bullet drop, windage, distance between the direction of the beam and the axis of the barrel, and the target mobility while the bullet travels).\nMost laser sights use a red laser diode. Others use an infrared diode to produce a dot invisible to the naked human eye but detectable with night vision devices. The firearms adaptive target acquisition module LLM01 laser light module combines visible and infrared laser diodes. In the late 1990s, green diode pumped solid state laser (DPSS) laser sights (532\u00a0nm) became available.\nEye-targeted lasers.\nA less-lethal laser weapon was developed by the U.S. Air Force to temporarily impair an adversary's ability to fire a weapon or to otherwise threaten enemy forces. This unit illuminates an opponent with harmless low-power laser light and can have the effect of dazzling or disorienting the subject or causing them to flee. Several types of dazzlers are now available, and some have been used in combat.\nThere remains the possibility of using lasers to blind, since this requires relatively low power levels and is easily achievable in a man-portable unit. However, most nations regard the deliberate permanent blinding of the enemy as forbidden by the rules of war (see Protocol on Blinding Laser Weapons). Although several nations have developed blinding laser weapons, such as China's ZM-87, none of these are believed to have made it past the prototype stage.\nIn addition to the applications that cross over with military applications, a widely known law enforcement use of lasers is for lidar to measure the speed of vehicles.\nHolographic weapon sight.\nA holographic weapon sight uses a laser diode to illuminate a hologram of a reticle built into a flat glass optical window of the sight. The user looks through the optical window and sees a cross hair reticle image superimposed at a distance on the field of view.\nIndustrial and commercial.\nIndustrial laser applications can be divided into two categories depending on the power of the laser: material processing and micro-material processing.\nIn material processing, lasers with average optical power above 1 kilowatt are used mainly for industrial materials processing applications. Beyond this power threshold there are thermal issues related to the optics that separate these lasers from their lower-power counterparts. Laser systems in the 50-300W range are used primarily for pumping, plastic welding and soldering applications. Lasers above 300W are used in brazing, thin metal welding, and sheet metal cutting applications. The required brightness (as measured in by the beam parameter product) is higher for cutting applications than for brazing and thin metal welding. High power applications, such as hardening, cladding, and deep penetrating welding, require multiple kW of optical power, and are used in a broad range of industrial processes.\nMicro material processing is a category that includes all laser material processing applications under 1 kilowatt. The use of lasers in Micro Materials Processing has found broad application in the development and manufacturing of screens for smartphones, tablet computers, and LED TVs.\nA detailed list of industrial and commercial laser applications includes:\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Examples of pump sources include electrical discharges, flashlamps, arc lamps, light from another laser, chemical reactions and even explosive devices. The type of pump source used principally depends on the \"gain medium\", and this also determines how the energy is transmitted to the medium. A helium\u2013neon (HeNe) laser uses an electrical discharge in the helium-neon gas mixture, a uses either light focused from a xenon flash lamp or diode lasers, and excimer lasers use a chemical reaction.\nGain medium / Laser medium.\nThe \"gain medium\" is the major determining factor of the wavelength of operation, and other properties, of the laser. \"Gain media\" in different materials have linear spectra or wide spectra. \"Gain media\" with wide spectra allow tuning of the laser frequency. There are hundreds if not thousands of different gain media in which laser operation has been achieved (see list of laser types for a list of the most important ones). The gain medium is excited by the pump source to produce a population inversion, and it is in the gain medium where spontaneous and stimulated emission of photons takes place, leading to the phenomenon of optical gain, or amplification.\nExamples of different gain media include:\nOptical resonator.\nThe \"optical resonator\", or \"optical cavity\", in its simplest form is two parallel mirrors placed around the gain medium, which provide feedback of the light. The mirrors are given optical coatings which determine their reflective properties. Typically, one will be a high reflector, and the other will be a partial reflector. The latter is called the output coupler, because it allows some of the light to leave the cavity to produce the laser's output beam.\nLight from the medium, produced by spontaneous emission, is reflected by the mirrors back into the medium, where it may be amplified by stimulated emission. The light may reflect from the mirrors and thus pass through the gain medium many hundreds of times before exiting the cavity. In more complex lasers, configurations with four or more mirrors forming the cavity are used. The design and alignment of the mirrors with respect to the medium is crucial for determining the exact operating wavelength and other attributes of the laser system.\nOther optical devices, such as spinning mirrors, modulators, filters, and absorbers, may be placed within the optical resonator to produce a variety of effects on the laser output, such as altering the wavelength of operation or the production of pulses of laser light.\nSome lasers do not use an optical cavity, but instead rely on very high optical gain to produce significant amplified spontaneous emission (ASE) without needing feedback of the light back into the gain medium. Such lasers are said to be superluminescent, and emit light with low coherence but high bandwidth. Since they do not use optical feedback, these devices are often not categorized as lasers."}

In Jan \u0141ukasiewicz's prefix notation for logic, the operator is formula_12, for Polish \"koniunkcja\".\nIn mathematics, the conjunction of an arbitrary number of elements formula_24 can be denoted as an iterated binary operation using a \"big wedge\" \u22c0 (Unicode ):\nformula_25\nDefinition.\nIn classical logic, logical conjunction is an operation on two logical values, typically the values of two propositions, that produces a value of \"true\" if and only if (also known as iff) both of its operands are true.\nThe conjunctive identity is true, which is to say that AND-ing an expression with true will never change the value of the expression.

Many languages also provide short-circuit control structures corresponding to logical conjunction.\nLogical conjunction is often used for bitwise operations, where codice_7 corresponds to false and codice_8 to true:\nThe operation can also be applied to two binary words viewed as bitstrings of equal length, by taking the bitwise AND of each pair of bits at corresponding positions. For example:\nThis can be used to select part of a bitstring using a bit mask. For example, codice_19 \u00a0=\u00a0 codice_20 extracts the fourth bit of an 8-bit bitstring.\nIn computer networking, bit masks are used to derive the network address of a subnet within an existing network from a given IP address, by ANDing the IP address and the subnet mask.\nLogical conjunction \"codice_4\" is also used in SQL operations to form database queries.\nThe Curry\u2013Howard correspondence relates logical conjunction to product types.\nSet-theoretic correspondence.\nThe membership of an element of an intersection set in set theory is defined in terms of a logical conjunction: formula_60 if and only if formula_61.

For example, \"and\" sometimes implies order having the sense of \"then\". For example, \"They got married and had a child\" in common discourse means that the marriage came before the child.\nThe word \"and\" can also imply a partition of a thing into parts, as \"The American flag is red, white, and blue.\" Here, it is not meant that the flag is \"at once\" red, white, and blue, but rather that each color is a part of the flag.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "18153", "revid": "44645973", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18153", "title": "Logical connective", "text": "Symbol connecting formulas in logic\n B, A \\downarrow B, \\overline{A+B}&lt;/math&gt;\n | XNOR | formula_1\n | \u2514 equivalent | formula_2\n | XOR | formula_3\n | \u2514 nonequivalent | formula_4\n | implies | formula_5\n | nonimplication\u00a0(NIMPLY) | formula_6\n | converse | formula_7\n | converse nonimplication | formula_8\nIn logic, a logical connective (also called a logical operator, sentential connective, or sentential operator) is an operator that combines or modifies one or more logical variables or formulas, similarly to how arithmetic connectives like formula_9 and formula_10 combine or negate arithmetic expressions. For instance, in the syntax of propositional logic, the binary connective formula_11 (meaning \"or\") can be used to join the two logical formulas formula_12 and formula_13, producing the complex formula formula_14.\nUnlike in algebra, there are many symbols in use for each logical connective. The table \"Logical connectives\" shows examples.\nCommon connectives include negation, disjunction, conjunction, implication, and equivalence. In standard systems of classical logic, these connectives are interpreted as truth functions, though they receive a variety of alternative interpretations in nonclassical logics. Their classical interpretations are similar to the meanings of natural language expressions such as English \"not\", \"or\", \"and\", and \"if\", but not identical. Discrepancies between natural language connectives and those of classical logic have motivated nonclassical approaches to natural language meaning.\nOverview.\nIn formal languages, truth functions are denoted by fixed symbols, ensuring that well-formed statements have a single interpretation. These symbols are called \"logical connectives\", \"logical operators\", \"propositional operators\", or, in classical logic, \"truth-functional connectives\". For the rules which allow new well-formed formulas to be constructed by joining other well-formed formulas using truth-functional connectives, see well-formed formula.\nLogical connectives can be used to link zero or more statements, so one can speak about \"n-ary logical connectives\". The boolean constants \"True\" and \"False\" can be thought of as zero-ary operators. Negation is a unary connective, and so on.\nList of common logical connectives.\nCommonly used logical connectives include the following ones. \nFor example, the meaning of the statements \"it is raining\" (denoted by formula_41) and \"I am indoors\" (denoted by formula_42) is transformed, when the two are combined with logical connectives:\nIt is also common to consider the \"always true\" formula and the \"always false\" formula to be connective (in which case they are nullary).\nThis table summarizes the terminology:\nHistory of notations.\nSome authors used letters for connectives: formula_84 for conjunction (German's \"und\" for \"and\") and formula_85 for disjunction (German's \"oder\" for \"or\") in early works by Hilbert (1904); formula_86 for negation, formula_87 for conjunction, formula_88 for alternative denial, formula_89 for disjunction, formula_90 for implication, formula_91 for biconditional in \u0141ukasiewicz in 1929.\nRedundancy.\nSuch a logical connective as converse implication \"formula_92\" is actually the same as material conditional with swapped arguments; thus, the symbol for converse implication is redundant. In some logical calculi (notably, in classical logic), certain essentially different compound statements are logically equivalent. A less trivial example of a redundancy is the classical equivalence between formula_93 and formula_94. Therefore, a classical-based logical system does not need the conditional operator \"formula_27\" if \"formula_15\" (not) and \"formula_24\" (or) are already in use, or may use the \"formula_27\" only as a syntactic sugar for a compound having one negation and one disjunction.\nThere are sixteen Boolean functions associating the input truth values formula_41 and formula_42 with four-digit binary outputs. These correspond to possible choices of binary logical connectives for classical logic. Different implementations of classical logic can choose different functionally complete subsets of connectives.\nOne approach is to choose a \"minimal\" set, and define other connectives by some logical form, as in the example with the material conditional above.\nThe following are the minimal functionally complete sets of operators in classical logic whose arities do not exceed 2:\nAnother approach is to use with equal rights connectives of a certain convenient and functionally complete, but \"not minimal\" set. This approach requires more propositional axioms, and each equivalence between logical forms must be either an axiom or provable as a theorem.\nThe situation, however, is more complicated in intuitionistic logic. Of its five connectives, {\u2227,\u2009\u2228,\u2009\u2192,\u2009\u00ac,\u2009\u22a5}, only negation \"\u00ac\" can be reduced to other connectives (see for more). Neither conjunction, disjunction, nor material conditional has an equivalent form constructed from the other four logical connectives.\nNatural language.\nThe standard logical connectives of classical logic have rough equivalents in the grammars of natural languages. In English, as in many languages, such expressions are typically grammatical conjunctions. However, they can also take the form of complementizers, verb suffixes, and particles. The denotations of natural language connectives is a major topic of research in formal semantics, a field that studies the logical structure of natural languages.\nThe meanings of natural language connectives are not precisely identical to their nearest equivalents in classical logic. In particular, disjunction can receive an exclusive interpretation in many languages. Some researchers have taken this fact as evidence that natural language semantics is nonclassical. However, others maintain classical semantics by positing pragmatic accounts of exclusivity which create the illusion of nonclassicality. In such accounts, exclusivity is typically treated as a scalar implicature. Related puzzles involving disjunction include free choice inferences, Hurford's Constraint, and the contribution of disjunction in alternative questions.\nOther apparent discrepancies between natural language and classical logic include the paradoxes of material implication, donkey anaphora and the problem of counterfactual conditionals. These phenomena have been taken as motivation for identifying the denotations of natural language conditionals with logical operators including the strict conditional, the variably strict conditional, as well as various dynamic operators.\nThe following table shows the standard classically definable approximations for the English connectives.\nProperties.\nSome logical connectives possess properties that may be expressed in the theorems containing the connective. Some of those properties that a logical connective may have are:\nFor classical and intuitionistic logic, the \"=\" symbol means that corresponding implications \"...\u2192...\" and \"...\u2190...\" for logical compounds can be both proved as theorems, and the \"\u2264\" symbol means that \"...\u2192...\" for logical compounds is a consequence of corresponding \"...\u2192...\" connectives for propositional variables. Some many-valued logics may have incompatible definitions of equivalence and order (entailment).\nBoth conjunction and disjunction are associative, commutative and idempotent in classical logic, most varieties of many-valued logic and intuitionistic logic. The same is true about distributivity of conjunction over disjunction and disjunction over conjunction, as well as for the absorption law.\nIn classical logic and some varieties of many-valued logic, conjunction and disjunction are dual, and negation is self-dual, the latter is also self-dual in intuitionistic logic. \nOrder of precedence.\nAs a way of reducing the number of necessary parentheses, one may introduce precedence rules: \u00ac has higher precedence than \u2227, \u2227 higher than \u2228, and \u2228 higher than \u2192. So for example, formula_130 is short for formula_131.\nHere is a table that shows a commonly used precedence of logical operators.\nHowever, not all compilers use the same order; for instance, an ordering in which disjunction is lower precedence than implication or bi-implication has also been used. Sometimes precedence between conjunction and disjunction is unspecified requiring to provide it explicitly in given formula with parentheses. The order of precedence determines which connective is the \"main connective\" when interpreting a non-atomic formula.\nTable and Hasse diagram.\nThe 16 logical connectives can be partially ordered to produce the following Hasse diagram. \nThe partial order is defined by declaring that formula_132 if and only if whenever formula_133 holds then so does formula_134 \nApplications.\nLogical connectives are used in computer science and in set theory.\nComputer science.\nA truth-functional approach to logical operators is implemented as logic gates in digital circuits. Practically all digital circuits (the major exception is DRAM) are built up from NAND, NOR, NOT, and transmission gates; see more details in Truth function in computer science. Logical operators over bit vectors (corresponding to finite Boolean algebras) are bitwise operations.\nBut not every usage of a logical connective in computer programming has a Boolean semantic. For example, lazy evaluation is sometimes implemented for \"P\"\u2009\u2227\u2009\"Q\" and \"P\"\u2009\u2228\u2009\"Q\", so these connectives are not commutative if either or both of the expressions P, Q have side effects. Also, a conditional, which in some sense corresponds to the material conditional connective, is essentially non-Boolean because for codice_1, the consequent\u00a0Q is not executed if the antecedent\u00a0P is false (although a compound as a whole is successful \u2248 \"true\" in such case). This is closer to intuitionist and constructivist views on the material conditional\u2014 rather than to classical logic's views.\nSet theory.\nLogical connectives are used to define the fundamental operations of set theory, as follows:\nThis definition of set equality is equivalent to the axiom of extensionality.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "18154", "revid": "19469161", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18154", "title": "Propositional logic", "text": "Branch of logic\nPropositional logic is a branch of logic. It is also called statement logic, sentential calculus, propositional calculus, sentential logic, or sometimes zeroth-order logic. Sometimes, it is called \"first-order\" propositional logic to contrast it with System F, but it should not be confused with first-order logic. It deals with propositions (which can be true or false) and relations between propositions, including the construction of arguments based on them. Compound propositions are formed by connecting propositions by logical connectives representing the truth functions of conjunction, disjunction, implication, biconditional, and negation. Some sources include other connectives, as in the table below.\nUnlike first-order logic, propositional logic does not deal with non-logical objects, predicates about them, or quantifiers. However, all the machinery of propositional logic is included in first-order logic and higher-order logics. In this sense, propositional logic is the foundation of first-order logic and higher-order logic.\nPropositional logic is typically studied with a formal language, in which propositions are represented by letters, which are called \"propositional variables\". These are then used, together with symbols for connectives, to make \"propositional formulas\". Because of this, the propositional variables are called \"atomic formulas\" of a formal propositional language. While the atomic propositions are typically represented by letters of the alphabet, there is a variety of notations to represent the logical connectives. For the benefit of readers who may only be used to a different variant notation for the logical connectives, the following table shows the main notational variants for each of the connectives in propositional logic. Other notations have been used historically, such as Polish notation. For the history of each of these symbols, see the respective articles as well as the article \"Logical connective\".\nThe most thoroughly researched branch of propositional logic is classical truth-functional propositional logic, in which formulas are interpreted as having precisely one of two possible truth values, the truth value of \"true\" or the truth value of \"false\". The principle of bivalence and the law of excluded middle are upheld. By comparison with first-order logic, truth-functional propositional logic is considered to be \"zeroth-order logic\".\nHistory.\nAlthough propositional logic had been hinted by earlier philosophers, Chrysippus is often credited with development of a deductive system for propositional logic as his main achievement in the 3rd century BC which was expanded by his successor Stoics. The logic was focused on propositions. This was different from the traditional syllogistic logic, which focused on terms. However, most of the original writings were lost and, at some time between the 3rd and 6th century CE, Stoic logic faded into oblivion, to be resurrected only in the 20th century, in the wake of the (re)-discovery of propositional logic.\nSymbolic logic, which would come to be important to refine propositional logic, was first developed by the 17th/18th-century mathematician Gottfried Leibniz, whose calculus ratiocinator was, however, unknown to the larger logical community. Consequently, many of the advances achieved by Leibniz were recreated by logicians like George Boole and Augustus De Morgan, completely independent of Leibniz.\nGottlob Frege's predicate logic builds upon propositional logic, and has been described as combining \"the distinctive features of syllogistic logic and propositional logic.\" Consequently, predicate logic ushered in a new era in logic's history; however, advances in propositional logic were still made after Frege, including natural deduction, truth trees and truth tables. Natural deduction was invented by Gerhard Gentzen and Stanis\u0142aw Ja\u015bkowski. Truth trees were invented by Evert Willem Beth. The invention of truth tables, however, is of uncertain attribution.\nWithin works by Frege and Bertrand Russell, are ideas influential to the invention of truth tables. The actual tabular structure (being formatted as a table), itself, is generally credited to either Ludwig Wittgenstein or Emil Post (or both, independently). Besides Frege and Russell, others credited with having ideas preceding truth tables include Philo, Boole, Charles Sanders Peirce, and Ernst Schr\u00f6der. Others credited with the tabular structure include Jan \u0141ukasiewicz, Alfred North Whitehead, William Stanley Jevons, John Venn, and Clarence Irving Lewis. Ultimately, some have concluded, like John Shosky, that \"It is far from clear that any one person should be given the title of 'inventor' of truth-tables\".\nSentences.\nPropositional logic, as currently studied in universities, is a specification of a standard of logical consequence in which only the meanings of propositional connectives are considered in evaluating the conditions for the truth of a sentence, or whether a sentence logically follows from some other sentence or group of sentences.\nDeclarative sentences.\nPropositional logic deals with statements, which are defined as declarative sentences having truth value. Examples of statements might include:\nDeclarative sentences are contrasted with questions, such as \"What is Wikipedia?\", and imperative statements, such as \"Please add citations to support the claims in this article.\". Such non-declarative sentences have no truth value, and are only dealt with in nonclassical logics, called erotetic and imperative logics.\nCompounding sentences with connectives.\nIn propositional logic, a statement can contain one or more other statements as parts. \"Compound sentences\" are formed from simpler sentences and express relationships among the constituent sentences. This is done by combining them with logical connectives: the main types of compound sentences are negations, conjunctions, disjunctions, implications, and biconditionals, which are formed by using the corresponding connectives to connect propositions. In English, these connectives are expressed by the words \"and\" (conjunction), \"or\" (disjunction), \"not\" (negation), \"if\" (material conditional), and \"if and only if\" (biconditional). Examples of such compound sentences might include:\nIf sentences lack any logical connectives, they are called \"simple sentences\", or \"atomic sentences\"; if they contain one or more logical connectives, they are called \"compound sentences\", or \"molecular sentences\".\n\"Sentential connectives\" are a broader category that includes logical connectives. Sentential connectives are any linguistic particles that bind sentences to create a new compound sentence, or that inflect a single sentence to create a new sentence. A \"logical connective\", or \"propositional connective\", is a kind of sentential connective with the characteristic feature that, when the original sentences it operates on are (or express) propositions, the new sentence that results from its application also is (or expresses) a proposition. Philosophers disagree about what exactly a proposition is, as well as about which sentential connectives in natural languages should be counted as logical connectives. Sentential connectives are also called \"sentence-functors\", and logical connectives are also called \"truth-functors\".\nArguments.\nAn argument is defined as a pair of things, namely a set of sentences, called the premises, and a sentence, called the conclusion. The conclusion is claimed to \"follow from\" the premises, and the premises are claimed to \"support\" the conclusion.\nExample argument.\nThe following is an example of an argument within the scope of propositional logic:\nPremise 1: \"If\" it's raining, \"then\" it's cloudy.\nPremise 2: It's raining.\nConclusion: It's cloudy.\nThe logical form of this argument is known as modus ponens, which is a classically valid form. So, in classical logic, the argument is \"valid\", although it may or may not be \"sound\", depending on the meteorological facts in a given context. This example argument will be reused when explaining .\nValidity and soundness.\nAn argument is valid if, and only if, it is \"necessary\" that, if all its premises are true, its conclusion is true. Alternatively, an argument is valid if, and only if, it is \"impossible\" for all the premises to be true while the conclusion is false.\nValidity is contrasted with \"soundness\". An argument is sound if, and only if, it is valid and all its premises are true. Otherwise, it is \"unsound\".\nLogic, in general, aims to precisely specify valid arguments. This is done by defining a valid argument as one in which its conclusion is a logical consequence of its premises, which, when this is understood as \"semantic consequence\", means that there is no \"case\" in which the premises are true but the conclusion is not true \u2013 see below.\nFormalization.\nPropositional logic is typically studied through a formal system in which formulas of a formal language are interpreted to represent propositions. This formal language is the basis for proof systems, which allow a conclusion to be derived from premises if, and only if, it is a logical consequence of them. This section will show how this works by formalizing the . The formal language for a propositional calculus will be fully specified in , and an overview of proof systems will be given in .\nPropositional variables.\nSince propositional logic is not concerned with the structure of propositions beyond the point where they cannot be decomposed any more by logical connectives, it is typically studied by replacing such \"atomic\" (indivisible) statements with letters of the alphabet, which are interpreted as variables representing statements (\"propositional variables\"). With propositional variables, the would then be symbolized as follows:\nPremise 1: formula_1\nPremise 2: formula_2\nConclusion: formula_3\nWhen P is interpreted as \"It's raining\" and Q as \"it's cloudy\" these symbolic expressions correspond exactly with the original expression in natural language. Not only that, but they will also correspond with any other inference with the same logical form.\nWhen a formal system is used to represent formal logic, only statement letters (usually capital roman letters such as formula_2, formula_3 and formula_6) are represented directly. The natural language propositions that arise when they're interpreted are outside the scope of the system, and the relation between the formal system and its interpretation is likewise outside the formal system itself.\nGentzen notation.\nIf we assume that the validity of modus ponens has been accepted as an axiom, then the same can also be depicted like this:\nformula_7\nThis method of displaying it is Gentzen's notation for natural deduction and sequent calculus. The premises are shown above a line, called the inference line, separated by a comma, which indicates \"combination\" of premises. The conclusion is written below the inference line. The inference line represents \"syntactic consequence\", sometimes called \"deductive consequence\", which is also symbolized with \u22a2. So the above can also be written in one line as formula_8.\nSyntactic consequence is contrasted with \"semantic consequence\", which is symbolized with \u22a7. In this case, the conclusion follows \"syntactically\" because the natural deduction inference rule of modus ponens has been assumed. For more on inference rules, see the sections on proof systems below.\nLanguage.\nThe language (commonly called formula_9) of a propositional calculus is defined in terms of:\nA \"well-formed formula\" is any atomic formula, or any formula that can be built up from atomic formulas by means of operator symbols according to the rules of the grammar. The language formula_9, then, is defined either as being \"identical to\" its set of well-formed formulas, or as \"containing\" that set (together with, for instance, its set of connectives and variables).\nUsually the syntax of formula_9 is defined recursively by just a few definitions, as seen next; some authors explicitly include \"parentheses\" as punctuation marks when defining their language's syntax, while others use them without comment.\nSyntax.\nGiven a set of atomic propositional variables formula_12, formula_13, formula_14, ..., and a set of propositional connectives formula_15, formula_16, formula_17, ..., formula_18, formula_19, formula_20, ..., formula_21, formula_22, formula_23, ..., a formula of propositional logic is defined recursively by these definitions:\nDefinition 1: Atomic propositional variables are formulas.\nDefinition 2: If formula_24 is a propositional connective, and formula_25A, B, C, \u2026formula_26 is a sequence of m, possibly but not necessarily atomic, possibly but not necessarily distinct, formulas, then the result of applying formula_24 to formula_25A, B, C, \u2026formula_26 is a formula.\nDefinition 3: Nothing else is a formula.\nWriting the result of applying formula_24 to formula_25A, B, C, ...formula_26 in functional notation, as formula_24(A, B, C, ...), we have the following as examples of well-formed formulas:\nWhat was given as \"Definition 2\" above, which is responsible for the composition of formulas, is referred to by Colin Howson as the \"principle of composition\". It is this recursion in the definition of a language's syntax which justifies the use of the word \"atomic\" to refer to propositional variables, since all formulas in the language formula_9 are built up from the atoms as ultimate building blocks. Composite formulas (all formulas besides atoms) are called \"molecules\", or \"molecular sentences\". (This is an imperfect analogy with chemistry, since a chemical molecule may sometimes have only one atom, as in monatomic gases.)\nThe definition that \"nothing else is a formula\", given above as \"Definition 3\", excludes any formula from the language which is not specifically required by the other definitions in the syntax. In particular, it excludes \"infinitely long\" formulas from being well-formed. It is sometimes called the \"Closure Clause\".\nCF grammar in BNF.\nAn alternative to the syntax definitions given above is to write a context-free (CF) grammar for the language formula_9 in Backus-Naur form (BNF). This is more common in computer science than in philosophy. It can be done in many ways, of which a particularly brief one, for the common set of five connectives, is this single clause:\nformula_43\nThis clause, due to its self-referential nature (since formula_44 is in some branches of the definition of formula_44), also acts as a recursive definition, and therefore specifies the entire language. To expand it to add modal operators, one need only add ...\u00a0formula_46 to the end of the clause.\nConstants and schemata.\nMathematicians sometimes distinguish between propositional constants, propositional variables, and schemata. \"Propositional constants\" represent some particular proposition, while \"propositional variables\" range over the set of all atomic propositions. Schemata, or \"schematic letters\", however, range over all formulas. (Schematic letters are also called \"metavariables\".) It is common to represent propositional constants by A, B, and C, propositional variables by P, Q, and R, and schematic letters are often Greek letters, most often \u03c6, \u03c8, and \u03c7.\nHowever, some authors recognize only two \"propositional constants\" in their formal system: the special symbol formula_47, called \"truth\", which always evaluates to \"True\", and the special symbol formula_48, called \"falsity\", which always evaluates to \"False\". Other authors also include these symbols, with the same meaning, but consider them to be \"zero-place truth-functors\", or equivalently, \"nullary connectives\".\nSemantics.\nTo serve as a model of the logic of a given natural language, a formal language must be semantically interpreted. In classical logic, all propositions evaluate to exactly one of two truth-values: \"True\" or \"False\". For example, \"Wikipedia is a online encyclopedia that anyone can edit\" , while \"Wikipedia is a paper encyclopedia\" .\nIn other respects, the following formal semantics can apply to the language of any propositional logic, but the assumptions that there are only two semantic values (\"bivalence\"), that only one of the two is assigned to each formula in the language (\"noncontradiction\"), and that every formula gets assigned a value (\"excluded middle\"), are distinctive features of classical logic. To learn about nonclassical logics with more than two truth-values, and their unique semantics, one may consult the articles on \"Many-valued logic\", \"Three-valued logic\", \"Finite-valued logic\", and \"Infinite-valued logic\".\nInterpretation (case) and argument.\nFor a given language formula_9, an interpretation, valuation, Boolean valuation, or case, is an assignment of \"semantic values\" to each formula of formula_9. For a formal language of classical logic, a case is defined as an \"assignment\", to each formula of formula_9, of one or the other, but not both, of the truth values, namely truth (T, or 1) and falsity (F, or 0). An interpretation that follows the rules of classical logic is sometimes called a Boolean valuation. An interpretation of a formal language for classical logic is often expressed in terms of truth tables. Since each formula is only assigned a single truth-value, an interpretation may be viewed as a function, whose domain is formula_9, and whose range is its set of semantic values formula_53, or formula_54.\nFor formula_55 distinct propositional symbols there are formula_56 distinct possible interpretations. For any particular symbol formula_57, for example, there are formula_58 possible interpretations: either formula_57 is assigned T, or formula_57 is assigned F. And for the pair formula_57, formula_62 there are formula_63 possible interpretations: either both are assigned T, or both are assigned F, or formula_57 is assigned T and formula_62 is assigned F, or formula_57 is assigned F and formula_62 is assigned T. Since formula_9 has formula_69, that is, denumerably many propositional symbols, there are formula_70, and therefore uncountably many distinct possible interpretations of formula_9 as a whole.\nWhere formula_72 is an interpretation and formula_73 and formula_74 represent formulas, the definition of an \"argument\", given in , may then be stated as a pair formula_75, where formula_76 is the set of premises and formula_74 is the conclusion. The definition of an argument's \"validity\", i.e. its property that formula_78, can then be stated as its \"absence of a counterexample\", where a counterexample is defined as a case formula_72 in which the argument's premises formula_76 are all true but the conclusion formula_74 is not true. As will be seen in , this is the same as to say that the conclusion is a \"semantic consequence\" of the premises.\nPropositional connective semantics.\nAn interpretation assigns semantic values to atomic formulas directly. Molecular formulas are assigned a \"function\" of the value of their constituent atoms, according to the connective used; the connectives are defined in such a way that the truth-value of a sentence formed from atoms with connectives depends on the truth-values of the atoms that they're applied to, and \"only\" on those. This assumption is referred to by Colin Howson as the assumption of the \"truth-functionality of the connectives\".\nSemantics via truth tables.\n B, A \\downarrow B, \\overline{A+B}&lt;/math&gt;\n | XNOR | formula_82\n | \u2514 equivalent | formula_83\n | XOR | formula_84\n | \u2514 nonequivalent | formula_85\n | implies | formula_86\n | nonimplication\u00a0(NIMPLY) | formula_87\n | converse | formula_88\n | converse nonimplication | formula_89\nSince logical connectives are defined semantically only in terms of the truth values that they take when the propositional variables that they're applied to take either of the two possible truth values, the semantic definition of the connectives is usually represented as a truth table for each of the connectives, as seen below:\nThis table covers each of the main five logical connectives: conjunction (here notated formula_90), disjunction (\"p\" \u2228 \"q\"), implication (\"p\" \u2192 \"q\"), biconditional (\"p\" \u2194 \"q\") and negation, (\u00ac\"p\", or \u00ac\"q\", as the case may be). It is sufficient for determining the semantics of each of these operators. For more truth tables for more different kinds of connectives, see the article \"Truth table\".\nSemantics via assignment expressions.\nSome authors write out the connective semantics using a list of statements instead of a table. In this format, where formula_91 is the interpretation of formula_73, the five connectives are defined as:\nInstead of formula_91, the interpretation of formula_73 may be written out as formula_109, or, for definitions such as the above, formula_110 may be written simply as the English sentence \"formula_73 is given the value formula_112\". Yet other authors may prefer to speak of a Tarskian model formula_113 for the language, so that instead they'll use the notation formula_114, which is equivalent to saying formula_110, where formula_72 is the interpretation function for formula_113.\nConnective definition methods.\nSome of these connectives may be defined in terms of others: for instance, implication, formula_118, may be defined in terms of disjunction and negation, as formula_119; and disjunction may be defined in terms of negation and conjunction, as formula_120). In fact, a \"truth-functionally complete\" system, in the sense that all and only the classical propositional tautologies are theorems, may be derived using only disjunction and negation (as Russell, Whitehead, and Hilbert did), or using only implication and negation (as Frege did), or using only conjunction and negation, or even using only a single connective for \"not and\" (the Sheffer stroke), as Jean Nicod did. A \"joint denial\" connective (logical NOR) will also suffice, by itself, to define all other connectives. Besides NOR and NAND, no other connectives have this property.\nSome authors, namely Howson and Cunningham, distinguish equivalence from the biconditional. (As to equivalence, Howson calls it \"truth-functional equivalence\", while Cunningham calls it \"logical equivalence\".) Equivalence is symbolized with \u21d4 and is a metalanguage symbol, while a biconditional is symbolized with \u2194 and is a logical connective in the object language formula_9. Regardless, an equivalence or biconditional is true if, and only if, the formulas connected by it are assigned the same semantic value under every interpretation. Other authors often do not make this distinction, and may use the word \"equivalence\", and/or the symbol \u21d4, to denote their object language's biconditional connective.\nSemantic truth, validity, consequence.\nGiven formula_73 and formula_74 as formulas (or sentences) of a language formula_9, and formula_72 as an interpretation (or case) of formula_9, then the following definitions apply:\nFor interpretations (cases) formula_72 of formula_9, these definitions are sometimes given:\nFor classical logic, which assumes that all cases are complete and consistent, the following theorems apply:\nProof systems.\nProof systems in propositional logic can be broadly classified into \"semantic proof systems\" and \"syntactic proof systems\", according to the kind of logical consequence that they rely on: semantic proof systems rely on semantic consequence (formula_146), whereas syntactic proof systems rely on syntactic consequence (formula_197). Semantic consequence deals with the truth values of propositions in all possible interpretations, whereas syntactic consequence concerns the derivation of conclusions from premises based on rules and axioms within a formal system. This section gives a very brief overview of the kinds of proof systems, with anchors to the relevant sections of this article on each one, as well as to the separate Wikipedia articles on each one.\nSemantic proof systems.\n&lt;math&gt;\\begin{array}{ Example of a truth table\nSemantic proof systems rely on the concept of semantic consequence, symbolized as formula_146, which indicates that if formula_73 is true, then formula_74 must also be true in every possible interpretation.\nTruth tables.\nA truth table is a semantic proof method used to determine the truth value of a propositional logic expression in every possible scenario. By exhaustively listing the truth values of its constituent atoms, a truth table can show whether a proposition is true, false, tautological, or contradictory. See .\nSemantic tableaux.\nA semantic tableau is another semantic proof technique that systematically explores the truth of a proposition. It constructs a tree where each branch represents a possible interpretation of the propositions involved. If every branch leads to a contradiction, the original proposition is considered to be a contradiction, and its negation is considered a tautology. See .\nSyntactic proof systems.\nSyntactic proof systems, in contrast, focus on the formal manipulation of symbols according to specific rules. The notion of syntactic consequence, formula_197, signifies that formula_74 can be derived from formula_73 using the rules of the formal system.\nAxiomatic systems.\nAn axiomatic system is a set of axioms or assumptions from which other statements (theorems) are logically derived. In propositional logic, axiomatic systems define a base set of propositions considered to be self-evidently true, and theorems are proved by applying deduction rules to these axioms. See .\nNatural deduction.\nNatural deduction is a syntactic method of proof that emphasizes the derivation of conclusions from premises through the use of intuitive rules reflecting ordinary reasoning. Each rule reflects a particular logical connective and shows how it can be introduced or eliminated. See .\nSequent calculus.\nThe sequent calculus is a formal system that represents logical deductions as sequences or \"sequents\" of formulas. Developed by Gerhard Gentzen, this approach focuses on the structural properties of logical deductions and provides a powerful framework for proving statements within propositional logic.\nSemantic proof via truth tables.\nTaking advantage of the semantic concept of validity (truth in every interpretation), it is possible to prove a formula's validity by using a truth table, which gives every possible interpretation (assignment of truth values to variables) of a formula. If, and only if, all the lines of a truth table come out true, the formula is semantically valid (true in every interpretation). Further, if (and only if) formula_138 is valid, then formula_73 is inconsistent.\nFor instance, this table shows that \"\"p\" \u2192 (\"q\" \u2228 \"r\" \u2192 (\"r\" \u2192 \u00ac\"p\"))\" is not valid:\nThe computation of the last column of the third line may be displayed as follows:\nFurther, using the theorem that formula_146 if, and only if, formula_179 is valid, we can use a truth table to prove that a formula is a semantic consequence of a set of formulas: formula_78 if, and only if, we can produce a truth table that comes out all true for the formula formula_209 (that is, if formula_210).\nSemantic proof via tableaux.\nSince truth tables have 2n lines for n variables, they can be tiresomely long for large values of n. Analytic tableaux are a more efficient, but nevertheless mechanical, semantic proof method; they take advantage of the fact that \"we learn nothing about the validity of the inference from examining the truth-value distributions which make either the premises false or the conclusion true: the only relevant distributions when considering deductive validity are clearly just those which make the premises true or the conclusion false.\"\nAnalytic tableaux for propositional logic are fully specified by the rules that are stated in schematic form below. These rules use \"signed formulas\", where a signed formula is an expression formula_211 or formula_212, where formula_213 is a (unsigned) formula of the language formula_9. (Informally, formula_211 is read \"formula_213 is true\", and formula_212 is read \"formula_213 is false\".) Their formal semantic definition is that \"under any interpretation, a signed formula formula_211 is called true if formula_213 is true, and false if formula_213 is false, whereas a signed formula formula_212 is called false if formula_213 is true, and true if formula_213 is false.\"\nformula_225\nIn this notation, rule 2 means that formula_226 yields both formula_227, whereas formula_228 \"branches\" into formula_229. The notation is to be understood analogously for rules 3 and 4. Often, in tableaux for classical logic, the \"signed formula\" notation is simplified so that formula_230 is written simply as formula_73, and formula_232 as formula_138, which accounts for naming rule 1 the \"Rule of Double Negation\".\nOne constructs a tableau for a set of formulas by applying the rules to produce more lines and tree branches until every line has been used, producing a \"complete\" tableau. In some cases, a branch can come to contain both formula_211 and formula_212 for some formula_213, which is to say, a contradiction. In that case, the branch is said to close. If every branch in a tree closes, the tree itself is said to close. In virtue of the rules for construction of tableaux, a closed tree is a proof that the original formula, or set of formulas, used to construct it was itself self-contradictory, and therefore false. Conversely, a tableau can also prove that a logical formula is tautologous: if a formula is tautologous, its negation is a contradiction, so a tableau built from its negation will close.\nTo construct a tableau for an argument formula_75, one first writes out the set of premise formulas, formula_76, with one formula on each line, signed with formula_239 (that is, formula_230 for each formula_230 in the set); and together with those formulas (the order is unimportant), one also writes out the conclusion, formula_74, signed with formula_243 (that is, formula_244). One then produces a truth tree (analytic tableau) by using all those lines according to the rules. A closed tree will be proof that the argument was valid, in virtue of the fact that formula_146 if, and only if, formula_246 is inconsistent (also written as formula_247).\nList of classically valid argument forms.\nUsing semantic checking methods, such as truth tables or semantic tableaux, to check for tautologies and semantic consequences, it can be shown that, in classical logic, the following classical argument forms are semantically valid, i.e., these tautologies and semantic consequences hold. We use formula_73 \u27da formula_74 to denote equivalence of formula_73 and formula_74, that is, as an abbreviation for both formula_146 and formula_253; as an aid to reading the symbols, a description of each formula is given. The description reads the symbol \u22a7 (called the \"double turnstile\") as \"therefore\", which is a common reading of it, although many authors prefer to read it as \"entails\", or as \"models\".\nSyntactic proof via natural deduction.\nNatural deduction, since it is a method of syntactical proof, is specified by providing \"inference rules\" (also called \"rules of proof\") for a language with the typical set of connectives formula_254; no axioms are used other than these rules. The rules are covered below, and a proof example is given afterwards.\nNotation styles.\nDifferent authors vary to some extent regarding which inference rules they give, which will be noted. More striking to the look and feel of a proof, however, is the variation in notation styles. The , which was covered earlier for a short argument, can actually be stacked to produce large tree-shaped natural deduction proofs\u2014not to be confused with \"truth trees\", which is another name for analytic tableaux. There is also a style due to Stanis\u0142aw Ja\u015bkowski, where the formulas in the proof are written inside various nested boxes, and there is a simplification of Ja\u015bkowski's style due to Fredric Fitch (Fitch notation), where the boxes are simplified to simple horizontal lines beneath the introductions of suppositions, and vertical lines to the left of the lines that are under the supposition. Lastly, there is the only notation style which will actually be used in this article, which is due to Patrick Suppes, but was much popularized by E.J. Lemmon and Benson Mates. This method has the advantage that, graphically, it is the least intensive to produce and display, which made it a natural choice for the editor who wrote this part of the article, who did not understand the complex LaTeX commands that would be required to produce proofs in the other methods.\nA proof, then, laid out in accordance with the Suppes\u2013Lemmon notation style, is a sequence of lines containing sentences, where each sentence is either an assumption, or the result of applying a rule of proof to earlier sentences in the sequence. Each line of proof is made up of a sentence of proof, together with its annotation, its assumption set, and the current line number. The assumption set lists the assumptions on which the given sentence of proof depends, which are referenced by the line numbers. The annotation specifies which rule of proof was applied, and to which earlier lines, to yield the current sentence. See the .\nInference rules.\nNatural deduction inference rules, due ultimately to Gentzen, are given below. There are ten primitive rules of proof, which are the rule \"assumption\", plus four pairs of introduction and elimination rules for the binary connectives, and the rule \"reductio ad adbsurdum\". Disjunctive Syllogism can be used as an easier alternative to the proper \u2228-elimination, and MTT and DN are commonly given rules, although they are not primitive.\nNatural deduction proof example.\nThe proof below derives formula_255 from formula_1 and formula_257 using only MPP and RAA, which shows that MTT is not a primitive rule, since it can be derived from those two other rules.\nSyntactic proof via axioms.\nIt is possible to perform proofs axiomatically, which means that certain tautologies are taken as self-evident and various others are deduced from them using modus ponens as an inference rule, as well as a \"rule of substitution\", which permits replacing any well-formed formula with any &lt;dfn id=\"\"&gt;substitution-instance&lt;/dfn&gt; of it. Alternatively, one uses axiom schemas instead of axioms, and no rule of substitution is used.\nThis section gives the axioms of some historically notable axiomatic systems for propositional logic. For more examples, as well as metalogical theorems that are specific to such axiomatic systems (such as their completeness and consistency), see the article Axiomatic system (logic).\nFrege's \"Begriffsschrift\".\nAlthough axiomatic proof has been used since the famous Ancient Greek textbook, Euclid's \"Elements of Geometry\", in propositional logic it dates back to Gottlob Frege's 1879 \"Begriffsschrift\". Frege's system used only implication and negation as connectives. It had six axioms:\nThese were used by Frege together with modus ponens and a rule of substitution (which was used but never precisely stated) to yield a complete and consistent axiomatization of classical truth-functional propositional logic.\n\u0141ukasiewicz's P2.\nJan \u0141ukasiewicz showed that, in Frege's system, \"the third axiom is superfluous since it can be derived from the preceding two axioms, and that the last three axioms can be replaced by the single sentence formula_264\". Which, taken out of \u0141ukasiewicz's Polish notation into modern notation, means formula_265. Hence, \u0141ukasiewicz is credited with this system of three axioms:\nJust like Frege's system, this system uses a substitution rule and uses modus ponens as an inference rule. The exact same system was given (with an explicit substitution rule) by Alonzo Church, who referred to it as the system P2 and helped popularize it.\nSchematic form of P2.\nOne may avoid using the rule of substitution by giving the axioms in schematic form, using them to generate an infinite set of axioms. Hence, using Greek letters to represent schemata (metalogical variables that may stand for any well-formed formulas), the axioms are given as:\nThe schematic version of P2 is attributed to John von Neumann, and is used in the Metamath \"set.mm\" formal proof database. It has also been attributed to Hilbert, and named formula_272 in this context.\nProof example in P2.\nAs an example, a proof of formula_273 in P2 is given below. First, the axioms are given names:\n(A1) formula_274\n(A2) formula_275\n(A3) formula_276\nAnd the proof is as follows:\nSolvers.\nOne notable difference between propositional calculus and predicate calculus is that satisfiability of a propositional formula is decidable.81 Deciding satisfiability of propositional logic formulas is an NP-complete problem. However, practical methods exist (e.g., DPLL algorithm, 1962; Chaff algorithm, 2001) that are very fast for many useful cases. Recent work has extended the SAT solver algorithms to work with propositions containing arithmetic expressions; these are the SMT solvers.\nSee also.\nRelated topics.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "18155", "revid": "50922246", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18155", "title": "Lazy evaluation", "text": "Software optimization technique\nIn programming language theory, lazy evaluation, or call-by-need, is an evaluation strategy which delays the evaluation of an expression until its value is needed (non-strict evaluation) and which avoids repeated evaluations (by the use of sharing).\nThe benefits of lazy evaluation include: \nLazy evaluation is often combined with memoization, as described in Jon Bentley's \"Writing Efficient Programs\". After a function's value is computed for that parameter or set of parameters, the result is stored in a lookup table that is indexed by the values of those parameters; the next time the function is called, the table is consulted to determine whether the result for that combination of parameter values is already available. If so, the stored result is simply returned. If not, the function is evaluated, and another entry is added to the lookup table for reuse.\nLazy evaluation is difficult to combine with imperative features such as exception handling and input/output, because the order of operations becomes indeterminate.\nThe opposite of lazy evaluation is eager evaluation, sometimes known as strict evaluation. Eager evaluation is the evaluation strategy employed in most programming languages.\nHistory.\nLazy evaluation was introduced for lambda calculus by Christopher Wadsworth. For programming languages, it was independently introduced by Peter Henderson and James H. Morris and by Daniel P. Friedman and David S. Wise.\nApplications.\nDelayed evaluation is used particularly in functional programming languages. When using delayed evaluation, an expression is not evaluated as soon as it gets bound to a variable, but when the evaluator is forced to produce the expression's value. That is, a statement such as codice_1 (i.e. the assignment of the result of an expression to a variable) clearly calls for the expression to be evaluated and the result is placed in codice_2, but what actually is in codice_2 is irrelevant until there is a need for its value via a reference to codice_2 in some later expression whose evaluation could itself be deferred, though eventually the rapidly growing tree of dependencies would be pruned to produce some symbol rather than another for the outside world to see.\nLazy evaluation is fundamental in big data frameworks such as Apache Spark, where computations on distributed datasets are delayed until results are explicitly needed, allowing for execution optimizations and reduction of unnecessary processing.\nControl structures.\nLazy evaluation allows control structures to be defined normally, and not as primitives or compile-time techniques. For example, one can define if-then-else and short-circuit evaluation operators:\nifThenElse True b c = b\nifThenElse False b c = c\n-- or\nTrue || b = True\nFalse || b = b\n-- and\nTrue &amp;&amp; b = b\nFalse &amp;&amp; b = False\nThese have the usual semantics, i.e., evaluates (a), then if and only if (a) evaluates to true does it evaluate (b), otherwise it evaluates (c). That is, exactly one of (b) or (c) will be evaluated. Similarly, for , if the easy part gives True the lots of work expression could be avoided. Finally, when evaluating , if \"SafeToTry\" is false there will be no attempt at evaluating the \"Expression\".\nConversely, in an eager language the above definition for would evaluate (a), (b), and (c) regardless of the value of (a). This is not the desired behavior, as (b) or (c) may have side effects, take a long time to compute, or throw errors. It is usually possible to introduce user-defined lazy control structures in eager languages as functions, though they may depart from the language's syntax for eager evaluation: Often the involved code bodies need to be wrapped in a function value, so that they are executed only when called.\nWorking with infinite data structures.\nDelayed evaluation has the advantage of being able to create calculable infinite lists without infinite loops or size matters interfering in computation. The actual values are only computed when needed. For example, one could create a function that creates an infinite list (often called a \"stream\") of Fibonacci numbers. The calculation of the \"n\"-th Fibonacci number would be merely the extraction of that element from the infinite list, forcing the evaluation of only the first n members of the list.\nTake for example this trivial program in Haskell:\nnumberFromInfiniteList :: Int -&gt; Int\nnumberFromInfiniteList n = infinity !! n - 1\n where infinity = [1..]\nmain = print $ numberFromInfiniteList 4\nIn the function numberFromInfiniteList, the value of infinity is an infinite range, but until an actual value (or more specifically, a specific value at a certain index) is needed, the list is not evaluated, and even then, it is only evaluated as needed (i.e., only to the desired index). Provided the programmer is careful, the program completes normally. However, certain calculations may result in the program attempting to evaluate an infinite number of elements; for example, requesting the length of the list or trying to sum the elements of the list with a fold operation would result in the program either failing to terminate or running out of memory.\nAs another example, the list of all Fibonacci numbers can be written in the programming language Haskell as:\n fibs = 0 : 1 : zipWith (+) fibs (tail fibs)\nIn Haskell syntax, \"codice_5\" prepends an element to a list, codice_6 returns a list without its first element, and codice_7 uses a specified function (in this case addition) to combine corresponding elements of two lists to produce a third.\nOther uses.\nIn computer windowing systems, the painting of information to the screen is driven by \"expose events\" which drive the display code at the last possible moment. By doing this, windowing systems avoid computing unnecessary display content updates.\nAnother example of laziness in modern computer systems is copy-on-write page allocation or demand paging, where memory is allocated only when a value stored in that memory is changed.\nLaziness can be useful for high performance scenarios. An example is the Unix mmap function, which provides \"demand driven\" loading of pages from disk, so that only those pages actually touched are loaded into memory, and unneeded memory is not allocated.\nMATLAB implements \"copy on edit\", where arrays which are copied have their actual memory storage replicated only when their content is changed, possibly leading to an \"out of memory\" error when updating an element afterwards instead of during the copy operation.\nPerformance.\nThe number of beta reductions to reduce a lambda term with call-by-need is not larger than the number needed by call-by-value or call-by-name reduction. With certain programs the number of steps may be much smaller, for example a specific family of lambda terms using Church numerals take an infinite amount of steps with call-by-value (i.e. never complete), an exponential number of steps with call-by-name, but only a polynomial number with call-by-need. Call-by-need embodies two optimizations - never repeat work (similar to call-by-value), and never perform unnecessary work (similar to call-by-name). \nLazy evaluation can also lead to reduction in memory footprint, since values are created when needed.\nIn practice, lazy evaluation may cause significant performance issues compared to eager evaluation. For example, on modern computer architectures, delaying a computation and performing it later is slower than performing it immediately . This can be alleviated through strictness analysis. Lazy evaluation can also introduce memory leaks due to unevaluated expressions.\nImplementation.\nSome programming languages delay evaluation of expressions by default, and some others provide functions or special syntax to delay evaluation. In KRC, Miranda and Haskell, evaluation of function arguments is delayed by default. In many other languages, evaluation can be delayed by explicitly suspending the computation using special syntax (as with Scheme's \"codice_8\" and \"codice_9\" and OCaml's \"codice_10\" and \"codice_11\") or, more generally, by wrapping the expression in a thunk. The object representing such an explicitly delayed evaluation is called a \"lazy future.\" Raku uses lazy evaluation of lists, so one can assign infinite lists to variables and use them as arguments to functions, but unlike Haskell and Miranda, Raku does not use lazy evaluation of arithmetic operators and functions by default.\nLaziness and eagerness.\nControlling eagerness in lazy languages.\nIn lazy programming languages such as Haskell, although the default is to evaluate expressions only when they are demanded, it is possible in some cases to make code more eager\u2014or conversely, to make it more lazy again after it has been made more eager. This can be done by explicitly coding something which forces evaluation (which may make the code more eager) or avoiding such code (which may make the code more lazy). \"Strict\" evaluation usually implies eagerness, but they are technically different concepts.\nHowever, there is an optimisation implemented in some compilers called strictness analysis, which, in some cases, allows the compiler to infer that a value will always be used. In such cases, this may render the programmer's choice of whether to force that particular value or not, irrelevant, because strictness analysis will force strict evaluation.\nIn Haskell, marking constructor fields strict means that their values will always be demanded immediately. The codice_12 function can also be used to demand a value immediately and then pass it on, which is useful if a constructor field should generally be lazy. However, neither of these techniques implements \"recursive\" strictness\u2014for that, a function called codice_13 was invented.\nAlso, pattern matching in Haskell 98 is strict by default, so the codice_14 qualifier has to be used to make it lazy.\nSimulating laziness in eager languages.\nC++.\nIn C++, the codice_15 library uses lazy range adaptors.\nimport std;\nusing std::vector;\nusing std::ranges::to;\nusing std::views::filter;\nusing std::views::iota;\nusing std::views::transform;\nvector&lt;int&gt; v = iota(1, 1'000'000) // lazily generate ints from 1 to 1,000,000\n | filter([](int x) -&gt; bool { return x % 2 == 0; }) // filter out odd numbers, keeping evens\n | transform([](int x) -&gt; int { return x * x; }) // square each value\n | to&lt;vector&gt;(); // convert the range back to a vector&lt;int&gt;\nJava.\nIn Java, lazy evaluation can be done by using objects that have a method to evaluate them when the value is needed. The body of this method must contain the code required to perform this evaluation. Since the introduction of lambda expressions in Java SE8, Java has supported a compact notation for this. The following example generic interface provides a framework for lazy evaluation:\ninterface Lazy&lt;T&gt; {\n T eval();\nThe codice_16 interface with its codice_17 method is equivalent to the codice_18 interface with its codice_19 method in the codice_20 library.\nEach class that implements the codice_16 interface must provide an codice_22 method, and instances of the class may carry whatever values the method needs to accomplish lazy evaluation. For example, consider the following code to lazily compute and print 210:\nLazy&lt;Integer&gt; a = () -&gt; 1;\nfor (int i = 0; i &lt; 10; i++) {\n Lazy&lt;Integer&gt; b = a;\n a = () -&gt; b.eval() + b.eval();\nSystem.out.println(\"a = \" + a.eval());\nIn the above, the variable a initially refers to a lazy integer object created by the lambda expression codice_23. Evaluating this lambda expression is similar to constructing a new instance of an anonymous class that implements codice_24 with an eval method returning 1.\nEach iteration of the loop links a to a new object created by evaluating the lambda expression inside the loop. Each of these objects holds a reference to another lazy object, b, and has an eval method that calls codice_25 twice and returns the sum. The variable b is needed here to meet Java's requirement that variables referenced from within a lambda expression be effectively final.\nThis is an inefficient program because this implementation of lazy integers does not memoize the result of previous calls to eval. It also involves considerable autoboxing and unboxing. What may not be obvious is that, at the end of the loop, the program has constructed a linked list of 11 objects and that all of the actual additions involved in computing the result are done in response to the call to codice_26 on the final line of code. This call recursively traverses the list to perform the necessary additions.\nWe can build a Java class that memoizes a lazy object as follows:\nclass Memo&lt;T&gt; implements Lazy&lt;T&gt; {\n private Lazy&lt;T&gt; lazy; // a lazy expression, eval sets it to null\n private T memo; // the memorandum of the previous value\n public Memo(Lazy&lt;T&gt; lazy) {\n this.lazy = lazy;\n public T eval() {\n if (lazy != null) {\n memo = lazy.eval();\n lazy = null;\n return memo;\nThis allows the previous example to be rewritten to be far more efficient. Where the original ran in time exponential in the number of iterations, the memoized version runs in linear time:\nLazy&lt;Integer&gt; a = () -&gt; 1;\nfor (int i = 0; i &lt; 10; i++) {\n Lazy&lt;Integer&gt; b = a;\n a = new Memo&lt;Integer&gt;(() -&gt; b.eval() + b.eval());\nSystem.out.printf(\"a = %s%n\", a.eval());\nJava's lambda expressions are just syntactic sugar. Anything that can be written with a lambda expression can be rewritten as a call to construct an instance of an anonymous inner class implementing the interface, and any use of an anonymous inner class can be rewritten using a named inner class, and any named inner class can be moved to the outermost nesting level.\nJavaScript.\nIn JavaScript, lazy evaluation can be simulated by using a generator. For example, the stream of all Fibonacci numbers can be written, using memoization, in the following TypeScript code:\n * Generator functions return generator objects, which reify lazy evaluation.\n * @return {!Generator&lt;bigint&gt;} A non-null generator of integers.\nfunction* fibonacciNumbers(): Generator&lt;bigint, never, unknown&gt; {\n let memo: [bigint, bigint] = [1n, -1n]; // create the initial state (e.g. a vector of \"negafibonacci\" numbers)\n while (true) { // repeat indefinitely\n memo = [memo[0] + memo[1], memo[0]]; // update the state on each evaluation\n yield memo[0]; // yield the next value and suspend execution until resumed\nconst stream: Generator&lt;bigint, never, unknown&gt; = fibonacciNumbers(); // create a lazy evaluated stream of numbers\nconst first10: bigint[] = Array.from(new Array(10), () =&gt; stream.next().value); // evaluate only the first 10 numbers\nconsole.log(first10); // the output is [0n, 1n, 1n, 2n, 3n, 5n, 8n, 13n, 21n, 34n]\nPython.\nIn Python 2.x the codice_27 function computes a list of integers. The entire list is stored in memory when the first assignment statement is evaluated, so this is an example of eager or immediate evaluation:\nr = range(10)\nprint r\nprint r[3]\nIn Python 3.x the codice_27 function returns a generator which computes elements of the list on demand. Elements are only generated when they are needed (e.g., when codice_29 is evaluated in the following example), so this is an example of lazy or deferred evaluation:\nr: Iterator[int] = range(10)\nprint(r)\nprint(r[3])\nThis change to lazy evaluation saves execution time for large ranges which may never be fully referenced and memory usage for large ranges where only one or a few elements are needed at any time.\nIn Python 2.x is possible to use a function called codice_30 which returns an object that generates the numbers in the range on demand. The advantage of codice_31 is that generated object will always take the same amount of memory.\nr = xrange(10)\nprint r\nlst = [x for x in r]\nprint lst\nFrom version 2.2 forward, Python manifests lazy evaluation by implementing iterators (lazy sequences) unlike tuple or list sequences. For instance (Python 2):\nnumbers: Iterator[int] = range(10)\niterator: Iterator[int] = iter(numbers)\nprint(numbers)\nprint(iterator)\nprint(iterator.next())\nThe above example shows that lists are evaluated when called, but in case of iterator, the first element '0' is printed when need arises.\n.NET.\nIn the .NET framework, it is possible to do lazy evaluation using the class System.Lazy&lt;T&gt;. The class can be easily exploited in F# using the lazy keyword, while the force method will force the evaluation. There are also specialized collections like Microsoft.FSharp.Collections.Seq that provide built-in support for lazy evaluation. \nlet fibonacci = Seq.unfold (fun (x, y) -&gt; Some(x, (y, x + y))) (0I,1I)\nfibonacci |&gt; Seq.nth 1000\nIn C# and VB.NET, the class System.Lazy&lt;T&gt; is directly used. \npublic int Sum()\n int a = 0;\n int b = 0; \n Lazy&lt;int&gt; x = new(() =&gt; a + b);\n a = 3;\n b = 5;\n return x.Value; // returns 8\nOr with a more practical example: \n// recursive calculation of the n'th fibonacci number\npublic int Fib(int n)\n return (n == 1) ? 1 : (n == 2) ? 1 : Fib(n - 1) + Fib(n - 2);\npublic void Main()\n Console.WriteLine(\"Which Fibonacci number do you want to calculate?\");\n int n = Int32.Parse(Console.ReadLine()); \n Lazy&lt;int&gt; fib = new(() =&gt; Fib(n)); // function is prepared, but not executed\n bool execute; \n if (n &gt; 100)\n Console.WriteLine(\"This can take some time. Do you really want to calculate this large number? [y/n]\");\n execute = (Console.ReadLine() == \"y\"); \n else \n execute = true;\n if (execute) \n Console.WriteLine(fib.Value); // number is only calculated if needed\nAnother way is to use the yield keyword: \n// eager evaluation \npublic IEnumerable&lt;int&gt; Fibonacci(int x)\n IList&lt;int&gt; fibs = new List&lt;int&gt;();\n int prev = -1;\n int next = 1;\n for (int i = 0; i &lt; x; i++)\n int sum = prev + next;\n prev = next;\n next = sum;\n fibs.Add(sum); \n return fibs;\n// lazy evaluation \npublic IEnumerable&lt;int&gt; LazyFibonacci(int x)\n int prev = -1;\n int next = 1;\n for (int i = 0; i &lt; x; i++)\n int sum = prev + next;\n prev = next;\n next = sum;\n yield return sum;\nRust.\nIn Rust, lazy evaluation is included in the Rust Standard library, through the types codice_32 and codice_33. codice_34 is the thread safe version of codice_35. The types are described as \"a value which is initialized on the first access\", as so:use std::cell::LazyCell;\nlet lazy: LazyCell&lt;i32&gt; = LazyCell::new(|| {\n println!(\"initializing\");\n 92\nprintln!(\"ready\");\nprintln!(\"{}\", *lazy);\nprintln!(\"{}\", *lazy);\n// Prints:\n// ready\n// initializing\n// 92\n// 92The types are defined as codice_36 where codice_37 is the type of the inner cell, and return type of codice_38, the function called once upon initialization.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

They are represented by the Lemuriformes in Madagascar with one of the highest concentration of the lemurs. One of five families commonly known as lemurs, these animals were once thought to be the evolutionary predecessors of monkeys and apes, but this is no longer considered correct. They are formally referred to as lemurids.\nClassification.\nThe family Lemuridae contains 21 extant species in five genera.\nFamily Lemuridae\nThis family was once broken into two subfamilies, Hapalemurinae (bamboo lemurs and the greater bamboo lemur) and Lemurinae (the rest of the family), but molecular evidence and the similarity of the scent glands have since placed the ring-tailed lemur with the bamboo lemurs and the greater bamboo lemur.\nLemur species in the genus \"Eulemur\" are known to interbreed, despite having dramatically different chromosome numbers. Red-fronted (2N=60) and collared brown (2N=50\u201352) lemurs were found to hybridize at Berenty Reserve, Madagascar.\nCharacteristics.\nLemurids are medium-sized arboreal primates, ranging from in length, excluding the tail, and weighing from . They have long, bushy tails and soft, woolly fur of varying coloration. The hindlegs are slightly longer than the forelegs, although not enough to hamper fully quadrupedal movement (unlike the sportive lemurs). Most species are highly agile, and regularly leap several metres between trees. They have a good sense of smell and binocular vision. All but one species (the ring-tailed lemur) lack a tapetum lucidum, a reflective layer in the eye that improves night vision. Among mammals, activity cycles are either strictly diurnal or nocturnal, however, these can widely vary across species. In general, lemur activity has evolved from nocturnal to diurnal. Some lemurs are also cathemeral, an activity pattern where an animal is neither strictly diurnal nor nocturnal.\nLemurids are herbivorous, eating predominantly fruits and leaves, with some species consuming nectar, gums, and insects. However, the composition of their diets varies greatly depending on the species. Most lemurids have the dental formula 2.1.3.32.1.3.3. Some subfossil records have contributed to the knowledge of the currently extant lemurs from the Holocene by showing the changes in their dental records in habitats near human activity. This demonstrates that lemur species such as the ring-tailed lemur and the common brown lemur were forced to switch their primary diet to a group of secondary food sources.\nWith most lemurids, the mother gives birth to one or two young after a gestation period of between 120 and 140 days, depending on species. The ruffed lemur species are the only lemurids that have true litters, consisting of anywhere from two to six offspring. They are generally sociable animals, living in groups of up to thirty individuals in some species. In some cases, such as the ring-tailed lemur, the groups are long-lasting, with distinct dominance hierarchies, while in others, such as the common brown lemur, the membership of the groups varies from day to day, and seems to have no clear social structure.\nSome of the lemur traits include low basal metabolic rate, highly seasonal breeders, adaptations to unpredictable climate and female dominance. Female dominance is expressed in lemurs with the females and males being sexually monomorphic and females having priority access to food. Lemurs live in groups of 11 to 17 animals, where females tend to stay within their natal groups and the males migrate. Male lemurs are competitive to win their mates which causes instability among the other organisms. Lemurs are able to mark their territory by using scents from local areas.\nA number of lemur species are considered threatened; two species are critically endangered, one species is endangered, and five species are rated as vulnerable.\nHabitat.\nThe highly seasonal dry deciduous forest of Madagascar alternates between dry and wet seasons, making it uniquely suitable for lemurs. Lemur species diversity increases as the number of tree species in an area increase and is also higher in forests that have been disturbed over undisturbed areas. Evidence from the subfossil records show that many of the now extinct lemurs actually lived in much drier climates than the currently extant lemurs.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "18157", "revid": "50696945", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18157", "title": "Lucent Technologies", "text": "American telecommunications company (1996-2006)\nLucent Technologies, Inc. was an American multinational telecommunications equipment company headquartered in Murray Hill, New Jersey. It was established on September 30, 1996, through the divestiture of the former AT&amp;T Technologies business unit of AT&amp;T Corporation, which included Western Electric and Bell Labs.\nLucent was acquired by Alcatel SA on December 1, 2006, forming Alcatel-Lucent.\nName.\nLucent means \"light-bearing\" in Latin. The name was applied for in 1996 at the time of the split from AT&amp;T.\nThe name was widely criticised, as the logo was to be, both internally and externally. Corporate communications and business cards included the strapline 'Bell Labs Innovations' in a bid to retain the prestige of the internationally famous research lab, within a new business under an as-yet unknown name.\nThis same linguistic root also gives Lucifer, \"the light bearer\" (from lux, 'light', and ferre, 'to bear'), who is also a character in Dante's epic poem \"Inferno\". Shortly after the Lucent renaming in 1996, Lucent's Plan 9 project released a development of their work as the Inferno OS in 1997. This extended the 'Lucifer' and Dante references as a series of punning names for the components of Inferno - Dis, Limbo, Charon and Styx (9P Protocol). When the rights to Inferno were sold in 2000, the company Vita Nuova Holdings was formed to represent them. This continues the Dante theme, although moving away from his \"Divine Comedy\" to the poem \"La Vita Nuova\".\nLogo.\nThe Lucent logo, the Innovation Ring, was designed by Landor Associates, a prominent San Francisco-based branding consultancy. One source inside Lucent says that the logo is a Zen Buddhist symbol for \"eternal truth\", the Ens\u014d, turned 90 degrees and modified. Another source says it represents the mythic ouroboros, a snake holding its tail in its mouth. Lucent's logo also has been said to represent constant re-creating and re-thinking. Carly Fiorina picked the logo because her mother was a painter and she rejected the sterile geometric logos of most high tech companies.\nAfter the logo was compared in the media to the ring a coffee mug leaves on paper, a \"Dilbert\" comic strip showed Dogbert as an overpaid consultant designing a new company logo; he takes a piece of paper that his coffee cup was sitting on and calls it the \"Brown Ring of Quality\". A telecommunication commentator referred to the logo as \"a big red zero\" and predicted financial losses.\nHistory.\nOne of the primary reasons AT&amp;T Corporation chose to spin off its equipment manufacturing business was to permit it to profit from sales to competing telecommunications providers; these customers had previously shown reluctance to purchase from a direct competitor. Bell Labs brought prestige to the new company, as well as the revenue from thousands of patents.\nAt the time of its spinoff, Lucent was placed under the leadership of Henry Schacht, who was brought in to oversee its transition from an arm of AT&amp;T into an independent corporation. Richard McGinn, who was serving as president and COO, succeeded Schacht as CEO in 1997 while Schacht remained chairman of the board. Lucent became a \"darling\" stock of the investment community in the late 1990s, and its split-adjusted spinoff price of $7.56/share rose to a high of $84. Its market capitalization reached a high of $258 billion, and it was at the time the most widely held company with 5.3 million shareholders.\nIn 1995, Carly Fiorina led corporate operations. In that capacity, she reported to Lucent chief executive Henry B. Schacht. She played a key role in planning and implementing the 1996 initial public offering of a successful stock and company launch strategy. Under her guidance, the spin-off raised US$3 billion.\nLater in 1996, Fiorina was appointed president of Lucent's consumer products sector, reporting to president and chief operating officer Rich McGinn. In 1997, she was named group president for Lucent's US$19 billion global service-provider business, overseeing marketing and sales for the company's largest customer segment. That year, Fiorina chaired a US$2.5 billion joint venture between Lucent's consumer communications and Royal Philips Electronics, under the name Philips Consumer Communications (PCC). The focus of the venture was to bring both companies to the top three in technology, distribution, and brand recognition.\nUltimately, the project struggled, and dissolved a year later after it garnered only 2% market share in mobile phones. Losses were at $500 million on sales of $2.5 billion. As a result of the failed joint venture, Philips announced the closure of one-quarter of the company's 230 factories worldwide, and Lucent closed down its wireless handset portion of the venture. Analysts suggested that the joint venture's failure was due to a combination of technology and management problems. Upon the end of the joint venture, PCC sent 5,000 employees back to Philips, many of which were laid off, and 8,400 employees back to Lucent.\nUnder Fiorina, the company added 22,000 jobs and revenues seemed to grow from US$19 billion to US$38 billion. However, the real cause of Lucent spurring sales under Fiorina was by lending money to their own customers. According to \"Fortune\" magazine, \"In a neat bit of accounting magic, money from the loans began to appear on Lucent's income statement as new revenue while the dicey debt got stashed on its balance sheet as an allegedly solid asset\". Lucent's stock price grew 10-fold.\nIn 1997, Lucent acquired Milpitas-based voicemail market leader Octel Communications Corporation for $1.8 billion, a move which immediately rendered the Business Systems Group profitable. The same year, Lucent acquired Livingston Enterprises Inc. for $650 million in stock. Livingston was known most for the creation of the RADIUS protocol and their PortMaster product that was used widely by dial-up internet service providers. In 1999, Lucent acquired Ascend Communications, an Alameda, California\u2013based manufacturer of communications equipment for US$20 billion. Lucent held discussions to acquire Juniper Networks but decided instead to buy Nexabit Networks.\nAt the start of 2000, Lucent's \"private bubble\" burst, while competitors like Nortel Networks and Alcatel were still going strong; it would be many months before the rest of the telecom industry bubble collapsed. Previously Lucent had 14 straight quarters where it exceeded analysts' expectations, leading to high expectations for the 15th quarter, ending Dec. 31, 1999. On January 6, 2000, Lucent made the first of a string of announcements that it had missed its quarterly estimates, as CEO Rich McGinn grimly announced that Lucent had run into special problems during that quarter\u2014including disruptions in its optical networking business\u2014and reported flat revenues and a big drop in profits. That caused the stock to plunge by 28%, shaving $64 billion off of the company's market capitalization. When it was later revealed that it had used dubious accounting and sales practices to generate some of its earlier quarterly numbers, Lucent fell from grace. It was said that \"Rich McGinn couldn't accept Lucent's fall from its early triumphs.\" He described himself once as imposing \"audacious\" goals on his managers, believing the stretch for performance would produce dream results. Henry Schacht defended the corporate culture that McGinn created and noted that McGinn did not sell any Lucent shares while serving as CEO. In June 2000, Lucent announced it would acquire Chromartis, an Israeli maker of optical network equipment, for $4.5 billion In November 2000, the company disclosed to the Securities and Exchange Commission that it had a $125 million accounting error for the third quarter of 2000, and by December 2000 it reported it had overstated its revenues for its latest quarter by nearly $700 million. Although no wrongdoing was found on his part, McGinn was forced to resign as CEO and he was replaced by Schacht on an interim basis. Subsequently, its CFO, Deborah Hopkins, left the company in May 2001 with Lucent's stock at $9.06 whereas at the time she was hired it was at $46.82. In August 2001, Lucent shut down Chromartis.\nIn April 2000, Lucent sold its Consumer Products unit to VTech. In October 2000, Lucent spun off its Business Systems arm into Avaya, Inc., and in June 2002, it spun off its microelectronics division into Agere Systems. The spinoffs of enterprise networking and wireless, the industry's key growth businesses from 2003 onward, meant that Lucent no longer had the capacity to serve this market.\nIn May 2000, Lucent received the Shingo Prize for Excellence in Manufacturing at the Mount Olive, New Jersey Product Realization Center.\nIn May and December 2001 there were merger discussions between Lucent and Alcatel, which would have seen Lucent acquired at its current market price without a premium; the newly combined entity would have been headquartered in Murray Hill. However, these negotiations collapsed when Schacht insisted on an equal 7\u20137 split of the merged company's board of directors, while Alcatel chief executive officer Serge Tchuruk wanted 8 of the 14 board seats for Alcatel due to it being in a stronger position. The failure of the merger talks caused Lucent's share price to collapse, and by October 2002 the stock price had bottomed at 55 cents per share.\nIn August 2001, certain Lucent Technologies manufacturing assets in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma and Columbus, Ohio were signed into a five-year supply agreement by Celestica and positioned it as a lead electronics manufacturing services provider for Lucent\u2019s North American wireless networking systems, access, and switching products. With this supply agreement, Lucent became one of the top three customers with over 10% of the revenue for Celestica in 2001, IBM and Sun Microsystems were the other customers in this Celestica revenue segment. The Lucent deal earned $570 million in cash from Celestica and possible value of up to $10 billion for the electronics manufacturing service contractor. Lucent's operational strategy was to continue developing networking systems, instead of manufacturing with this partnership with Celestica.\nOn January 7, 2002, Patricia Russo, formerly Lucent's EVP of the Corporate Office who then left for Eastman Kodak to serve as COO, was named permanent chairman and CEO of Lucent, succeeding Schacht who remained on the board of directors.\nLucent was reduced to 30,500 employees, down from about 165,000 employees at its zenith. The layoffs of so many experienced employees meant that the company was in a weakened position and unable to re-establish itself when the market recovered in 2003. By early 2003, Lucent's market value was $15.6 billion (which includes $6.8 billion of current value for two companies that Lucent had recently spun off, Avaya and Agere Systems), making the shares worth around $2.13, a far cry from its dotcom bubble peak of around $84, when Lucent was worth $258 billion.\nLucent continued to be active in the areas of telephone switching, optical, data and wireless networking.\nIn 2004, the SEC charged Lucent with a $25 million fine for the company's lack of cooperation in their fraud case.\nOn April 2, 2006, Lucent announced a merger agreement with Alcatel, which was 1.5 times the size of Lucent. Serge Tchuruk became non-executive chairman, and Russo served as CEO of the newly merged company, Alcatel-Lucent, until they were both forced to resign at the end of 2008. The merger failed to produce the expected synergies, and there were significant write-downs of Lucent's assets that Alcatel purchased.\nOperations.\nDivisions.\nLucent was divided into several core groups:\nMurray Hill facility.\nThe Murray Hill facility in New Providence, New Jersey was the global headquarters for Lucent Technologies. There was a cricket field in the grounds.\nThe Murray Hill anechoic chamber, built in 1940, is the world's oldest wedge-based anechoic chamber. The interior room measures approximately high by wide by deep. The exterior concrete and brick walls are about thick to keep outside noise from entering the chamber. The chamber absorbs over 99.995% of the incident acoustic energy above 200\u00a0Hz. At one time the Murray Hill chamber was cited in the Guinness Book of World Records as the world's quietest room.\nMount Olive facility.\nThe Mount Olive Product Realization Center (MTO-PRC) facility in Mount Olive, New Jersey was part of the Wireless Networks Group business unit. The 252,000 square-feet building was constructed for AT&amp;T Corp. in 1994. The two leased buildings were located at the International Trade Center (New Jersey) and one building was used for warehousing and the other used for wireless products manufacturing since 1995. An additionally built wireless products manufacturing, PRC, was located in Piscataway, New Jersey also independently of AT&amp;T creation.\nThis system integration plant was a manufacturing location with the business unit under one roof. This allowed, the development, design, business functions for manufacturing cellular phone parts and between 1996 and 1999, the production of first generation CDMA (Code-division multiple access) minicells needed for cellular phone carriers. A 1,015-lb second generation Flexent Modcell cabinet was introduced in October 1999 for production as PCS (1.9 gigahertz) and TDMA (time-division multiple access) cellular (850\u00a0MHz) versions.\nFrom 1996 to 1999, PRC achieved and reduced with this new facility the following production metrics and lean manufacturing statistics: product-development cycle time reduced over 50%, material cost reduced 43%, cost of goods by 68%, assembly productivity increased close to 150%, assembly defects reduced by 80%, manufacturing inventory reduced 70%, and 100% on-time delivery. The facility introduced several self-managed work teams called PODs (Production On Demand) to assemble and test 50 Flexent Modcells daily.\nThe location was also active in research and development of CDMA minicells for future global market growth and third generation W-CDMA (Wideband Code-Division Multiple Access) innovation. Expansion was evident with minicell lines for the South America market with cross-training technicians from Brazil on the product and the W-CDMA product for Japan's cellular carrier, NTT DoCoMo.\nThe facility was awarded various awards and prizes for the lean manufacturing of products and excellence in work methods.\nIn June 2002, Lucent announced closure of the manufacturing building by the end of the year, due to the telecommunication losses in operations. Of the remaining 530 employees at the facility. 170 were employee layoffs and the other 360 employees would mostly transfer to Lucent's Whippany, New Jersey location. The manufacturing of cell based systems would transfer to the Columbus, Ohio facility without employees. In the prior year. the warehouse building had closed for consolidation of facilities and cost reduction.\nNotable buildings.\nDuring its expansion in the late 1990s, Lucent commissioned several large office buildings. The architectural firm, Kevin Roche, John Dinkeloo, and Associates (KRJDA) designed five structures clad in energy-efficient, tinted, low-E glass. \nLeased locations.\nTo meet customer and business needs, further locations were built and leased for Lucent, rather than built as corporate assets. At September, 1997 Lucent reported that future non-cancelable lease payments totaled $1,037 million.\nDomestic manufacturing locations.\nMany of the following manufacturing locations were transferred to other subsidiaries during Lucent's existence, closed, or sold years later. These facilities were established by Western Electric before the 1983 Bell System break-up. AT&amp;T operated and managed these locations from 1984 until 1996. After the AT&amp;T spin-off of Lucent, the telecommunications equipment being manufactured at these locations became products of Lucent Technologies.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Lupercalia was also known as \"dies Februatus\", after the purification instruments called \"februa\", the basis for the month named \"Februarius\".\nName.\nThe festival was originally known as Februa (\"Purifications\" or \"Purgings\") after the ' which was used on the day. It was also known as ' and gave its name variously, as epithet to Juno Februalis, Februlis, or Februata in her role as patron deity of that month; to a supposed purification deity called Februus; and to February ('), the month during which the festival occurred. Ovid connects ' to an Etruscan word for \"purging\".\nThe name \"Lupercalia\" was believed in antiquity to evince some connection with the Ancient Greek festival of the Arcadian Lykaia, a wolf festival (, \"l\u00fdkos\"; ), and the worship of \"Lycaean Pan\", assumed to be a Greek equivalent to Faunus, as instituted by Evander. Justin describes a cult image of \"the Lycaean god, whom the Greeks call Pan and the Romans Lupercus\", as nude, save for a goatskin girdle. \nThe statue stood in the Lupercal, the cave where tradition held that Romulus and Remus were suckled by the she-wolf (Lupa). The cave lay at the foot of the Palatine Hill, on which Romulus was thought to have founded Rome. The name of the festival most likely derives from \"lupus\", \"wolf\", though both the etymology and its significance are obscure. The wolf appellation may have to do with the fact that an animal predator plays a key role in male rites of passage. Despite Justin's assertion, no deity named \"Lupercus\" has been identified.\nRites.\nLocations.\nThe rites were confined to the Lupercal cave, the Palatine Hill, and the Forum, all of which were central locations in Rome's foundation myth. Near the cave stood a sanctuary of Rumina, goddess of breastfeeding; and the wild fig-tree (\"Ficus Ruminalis\") to which Romulus and Remus were brought by the divine intervention of the river-god Tiberinus; some Roman sources name the wild fig tree \"caprificus\", literally \"goat fig\". Like the cultivated fig, its fruit is pendulous, and the tree exudes a milky sap if cut, which makes it a good candidate for a cult of breastfeeding.\nPriesthoods.\nThe Lupercalia had its own priesthood, the \"Luperci\" (\"brothers of the wolf\"), whose institution and rites were attributed either to the Arcadian culture-hero Evander, or to Romulus and Remus, erstwhile shepherds who had each established a group of followers. The \"Luperci\" were young men (\"iuvenes\"), usually between the ages of 20 and 40. They formed two religious \"collegia\" (associations) based on ancestry; the \"Quinctiliani\" (named after the \"gens\" Quinctia) and the \"Fabiani\" (named after the \"gens\" Fabia). Each college was headed by a \"magister\".\nIn 44 BC, a third college, the \"Juliani\", was instituted in honor of Julius Caesar; its first \"magister\" was Mark Antony. The college of \"Juliani\" disbanded or lapsed following the Assassination of Julius Caesar, and was not re-established in the reforms of his successor, Augustus. In the Imperial era, membership of the two traditional \"collegia\" was opened to \"iuvenes\" of equestrian status.\nSacrifice and fertility rites.\nAt the Lupercal altar, a male goat (or goats) and a dog were sacrificed by one or another of the \"Luperci\", under the supervision of the Flamen dialis, Jupiter's chief priest. An offering was also made of salted mealcakes, prepared by the Vestal Virgins. After the blood sacrifice, two \"Luperci\" approached the altar. Their foreheads were anointed with blood from the sacrificial knife, then wiped clean with wool soaked in milk, after which they were expected to laugh.\nThe sacrificial feast followed, after which the Luperci cut thongs (known as \"\") from the flayed skin of the animal, and ran with these, naked or near-naked, along the old Palatine boundary, in an anticlockwise direction around the hill. In Plutarch's description of the Lupercalia, written during the early Roman Empire,\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;...many of the noble youths and of the magistrates run up and down through the city naked, for sport and laughter striking those they meet with shaggy thongs. And many women of rank also purposely get in their way, and like children at school present their hands to be struck, believing that the pregnant will thus be helped in delivery, and the barren to pregnancy.\nThe \"Luperci\" completed their circuit of the Palatine, then returned to the \"Lupercal\" cave.\nWhile sometimes repeated uncritically by modern sources, there is no ancient evidence for any kind of lottery or sortition scheme pairing couples for sex. The first descriptions of this fictitious lottery appeared in the 15th century in relation to Valentine's Day, with a connection to the Lupercalia first asserted in 18th century antiquarian works, such as those by Alban Butler and Francis Douce.\nHistory.\nThe Februa was of ancient and possibly Sabine origin. After February was added to the Roman calendar, Februa occurred on its fifteenth day (\"\"). Of its various rituals, the most important came to be those of the Lupercalia. The Romans themselves attributed the instigation of the Lupercalia to Evander, a culture hero from Arcadia who was credited with bringing the Olympic pantheon, Greek laws and alphabet to Italy, where he founded the city of Pallantium on the future site of Rome, 60 years before the Trojan War.\nLupercalia was celebrated in parts of Italy; \"Luperci\" are attested by inscriptions at Velitrae, Praeneste, Nemausus (modern N\u00eemes) and elsewhere. The ancient cult of the Hirpi Sorani (\"wolves of Soranus\", from Sabine \"hirpus\" \"wolf\"), who practiced at Mt. Soracte, north of Rome, had elements in common with the Roman Lupercalia.\nDescriptions of the Lupercalia festival of 44 BC attest to its continuity. During the festival, Julius Caesar publicly refused a golden crown offered to him by Mark Antony. The Lupercal cave was restored or rebuilt by Augustus, and has been speculated to be identical with a grotto discovered in 2007, below the remains of Augustus' residence; according to scholarly consensus, the grotto is a nymphaeum, not the Lupercal. The Lupercalia festival is marked on a calendar of 354 alongside traditional and Christian festivals. \nDespite the banning in 391 of all non-Christian cults and festivals, the Lupercalia was celebrated by the nominally Christian populace on a regular basis into the reign of the emperor Anastasius. Pope Gelasius I (494\u201396) claimed that only the \"vile rabble\" were involved in the festival and sought its forceful abolition; the Roman Senate protested that the Lupercalia was essential to Rome's safety and well-being. This prompted Gelasius' scornful suggestion that \"If you assert that this rite has salutary force, celebrate it yourselves in the ancestral fashion; run nude yourselves that you may properly carry out the mockery\".\nThere is no contemporary evidence to support the popular notions that Gelasius abolished the Lupercalia, or that he, or any other prelate, replaced it with the Feast of the Purification of the Blessed Virgin Mary. A literary association between the Lupercalia and the romantic elements of Saint Valentine's Day dates back to Chaucer and poetic traditions of courtly love.\nLegacy.\nHorace's Ode III, 18 alludes to the Lupercalia. The festival or its associated rituals gave its name to the Roman month of February (\"\") and thence to the modern month. The Roman god Februus personified both the month and purification, but seems to postdate both.\nWilliam Shakespeare's play \"Julius Caesar\" begins during the Lupercalia. Mark Antony is instructed by Caesar to strike his wife Calpurnia, in the hope that she will be able to conceive.\nResearch published in 2019 suggests that the word Leprechaun derives from \"Lupercus\".\nPatrick Wolf's fifth album was titled Lupercalia in honour of the festival.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "18167", "revid": "50872019", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18167", "title": "Linked list", "text": "Data structure with nodes pointing to the next node\nIn computer science, a linked list is a linear collection of data elements whose order is not given by their physical placement in memory. Instead, each element points to the next. It is a data structure consisting of a collection of nodes which together represent a sequence. In its most basic form, each node contains data, and a reference (in other words, a \"link\") to the next node in the sequence. This structure allows for efficient insertion or removal of elements from any position in the sequence during iteration. More complex variants add additional links, allowing more efficient insertion or removal of nodes at arbitrary positions. A drawback of linked lists is that data access time is linear in respect to the number of nodes in the list. Because nodes are serially linked, accessing any node requires that the prior node be accessed beforehand (which introduces difficulties in pipelining). Faster access, such as random access, is not feasible. Arrays have better cache locality compared to linked lists.\nLinked lists are among the simplest and most common data structures. They can be used to implement several other common abstract data types, including lists, stacks, queues, associative arrays, and S-expressions, though it is not uncommon to implement those data structures directly without using a linked list as the basis.\nThe principal benefit of a linked list over a conventional array is that the list elements can be easily inserted or removed without reallocation or reorganization of the entire structure because the data items do not need to be stored contiguously in memory or on disk, while restructuring an array at run-time is a much more expensive operation. Linked lists allow insertion and removal of nodes at any point in the list, and allow doing so with a constant number of operations by keeping the link previous to the link being added or removed in memory during list traversal.\nOn the other hand, since simple linked lists by themselves do not allow random access to the data or any form of efficient indexing, many basic operations\u2014such as obtaining the last node of the list, finding a node that contains a given datum, or locating the place where a new node should be inserted\u2014may require iterating through most or all of the list elements.\nHistory.\nLinked lists were developed in 1955\u20131956, by Allen Newell, Cliff Shaw and Herbert A. Simon at RAND Corporation and Carnegie Mellon University as the primary data structure for their Information Processing Language (IPL). IPL was used by the authors to develop several early artificial intelligence programs, including the Logic Theory Machine, the General Problem Solver, and a computer chess program. Reports on their work appeared in IRE Transactions on Information Theory in 1956, and several conference proceedings from 1957 to 1959, including Proceedings of the Western Joint Computer Conference in 1957 and 1958, and Information Processing (Proceedings of the first UNESCO International Conference on Information Processing) in 1959. The now-classic diagram consisting of blocks representing list nodes with arrows pointing to successive list nodes appears in \"Programming the Logic Theory Machine\" by Newell and Shaw in Proc. WJCC, February 1957. Newell and Simon were recognized with the ACM Turing Award in 1975 for having \"made basic contributions to artificial intelligence, the psychology of human cognition, and list processing\". The problem of machine translation for natural language processing led Victor Yngve at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) to use linked lists as data structures in his COMIT programming language for computer research in the field of linguistics. A report on this language entitled \"A programming language for mechanical translation\" appeared in Mechanical Translation in 1958.\nAnother early appearance of linked lists was by Hans Peter Luhn who wrote an internal IBM memorandum in January 1953 that suggested the use of linked lists in chained hash tables.\nLISP, standing for list processor, was created by John McCarthy in 1958 while he was at MIT and in 1960 he published its design in a paper in the Communications of the ACM, entitled \"Recursive Functions of Symbolic Expressions and Their Computation by Machine, Part I\". One of LISP's major data structures is the linked list.\nBy the early 1960s, the utility of both linked lists and languages which use these structures as their primary data representation was well established. Bert Green of the MIT Lincoln Laboratory published a review article entitled \"Computer languages for symbol manipulation\" in IRE Transactions on Human Factors in Electronics in March 1961 which summarized the advantages of the linked list approach. A later review article, \"A Comparison of list-processing computer languages\" by Bobrow and Raphael, appeared in Communications of the ACM in April 1964.\nSeveral operating systems developed by Technical Systems Consultants (originally of West Lafayette Indiana, and later of Chapel Hill, North Carolina) used singly linked lists as file structures. A directory entry pointed to the first sector of a file, and succeeding portions of the file were located by traversing pointers. Systems using this technique included Flex (for the Motorola 6800 CPU), mini-Flex (same CPU), and Flex9 (for the Motorola 6809 CPU). A variant developed by TSC for and marketed by Smoke Signal Broadcasting in California, used doubly linked lists in the same manner.\nThe TSS/360 operating system, developed by IBM for the System 360/370 machines, used a double linked list for their file system catalog. The directory structure was similar to Unix, where a directory could contain files and other directories and extend to any depth.\nBasic concepts and nomenclature.\nEach record of a linked list is often called an 'element' or 'node'.\nThe field of each node that contains the address of the next node is usually called the 'next link' or 'next pointer'. The remaining fields are known as the 'data', 'information', 'value', 'cargo', or 'payload' fields.\nThe 'head' of a list is its first node. The 'tail' of a list may refer either to the rest of the list after the head, or to the last node in the list. In Lisp and some derived languages, the next node may be called the 'cdr' (pronounced ) of the list, while the payload of the head node may be called the 'car'.\nSingly linked list.\nSingly linked lists contain nodes which have a 'value' field as well as 'next' field, which points to the next node in line of nodes. Operations that can be performed on singly linked lists include insertion, deletion and traversal.\nThe following C language code demonstrates how to add a new node with the \"value\" to the end of a singly linked list:\n// Each node in a linked list is a structure. The head node is the first node in the list.\ntypedef struct Node {\n int value;\n struct Node* next;\n} Node;\nNode* addNodeToTail(Node* head, int value) {\n // declare Node pointer and initialize to point to the new Node (i.e., it will have the new Node's memory address) being added to the end of the list.\n Node* temp = (Node*)malloc(sizeof *temp); /// 'malloc' in stdlib.\n temp-&gt;value = value; // Add data to the value field of the new Node.\n temp-&gt;next = NULL; // initialize invalid links to nil.\n if (!head) {\n head = temp; // If the linked list is empty (i.e., the head node pointer is a null pointer), then have the head node pointer point to the new Node.\n } else {\n Node* p = head; // Assign the head node pointer to the Node pointer 'p'.\n while (p-&gt;next) {\n p = p-&gt;next; // Traverse the list until p is the last Node. The last Node always points to NULL.\n p-&gt;next = temp; // Make the previously last Node point to the new Node.\n \n return head; // Return the head node pointer.\nDoubly linked list.\nIn a 'doubly linked list', each node contains, besides the next-node link, a second link field pointing to the 'previous' node in the sequence. The two links may be called 'forward('s') and 'backwards', or 'next' and 'prev'('previous').\nA technique known as XOR-linking allows a doubly linked list to be implemented using a single link field in each node. However, this technique requires the ability to do bit operations on addresses, and therefore may not be available in some high-level languages.\nMany modern operating systems use doubly linked lists to maintain references to active processes, threads, and other dynamic objects. A common strategy for rootkits to evade detection is to unlink themselves from these lists.\nMultiply linked list.\nIn a 'multiply linked list', each node contains two or more link fields, each field being used to connect the same set of data arranged in a different order (e.g., by name, by department, by date of birth, etc.). While a doubly linked list can be seen as a special case of multiply linked list, the fact that the two and more orders are opposite to each other leads to simpler and more efficient algorithms, so they are usually treated as a separate case.\nCircular linked list.\nIn the last node of a linked list, the link field often contains a null reference, a special value used to indicate the lack of further nodes. A less common convention is to make it point to the first node of the list; in that case, the list is said to be 'circular' or 'circularly linked'; otherwise, it is said to be 'open' or 'linear'. It is a list where the last node pointer points to the first node (i.e., the \"next link\" pointer of the last node has the memory address of the first node).\nIn the case of a circular doubly linked list, the first node also points to the last node of the list.\nSentinel nodes.\nIn some implementations an extra 'sentinel' or 'dummy' node may be added before the first data record or after the last one. This convention simplifies and accelerates some list-handling algorithms, by ensuring that all links can be safely dereferenced and that every list (even one that contains no data elements) always has a \"first\" and \"last\" node.\nEmpty lists.\nAn empty list is a list that contains no data records. This is usually the same as saying that it has zero nodes. If sentinel nodes are being used, the list is usually said to be empty when it has only sentinel nodes.\nHash linking.\nThe link fields need not be physically part of the nodes. If the data records are stored in an array and referenced by their indices, the link field may be stored in a separate array with the same indices as the data records.\nList handles.\nSince a reference to the first node gives access to the whole list, that reference is often called the 'address', 'pointer', or 'handle' of the list. Algorithms that manipulate linked lists usually get such handles to the input lists and return the handles to the resulting lists. In fact, in the context of such algorithms, the word \"list\" often means \"list handle\". In some situations, however, it may be convenient to refer to a list by a handle that consists of two links, pointing to its first and last nodes.\nCombining alternatives.\nThe alternatives listed above may be arbitrarily combined in almost every way, so one may have circular doubly linked lists without sentinels, circular singly linked lists with sentinels, etc.\nTradeoffs.\nAs with most choices in computer programming and design, no method is well suited to all circumstances. A linked list data structure might work well in one case, but cause problems in another. This is a list of some of the common tradeoffs involving linked list structures.\nLinked lists vs. dynamic arrays.\nA \"dynamic array\" is a data structure that allocates all elements contiguously in memory, and keeps a count of the current number of elements. If the space reserved for the dynamic array is exceeded, it is reallocated and (possibly) copied, which is an expensive operation.\nLinked lists have several advantages over dynamic arrays. Insertion or deletion of an element at a specific point of a list, assuming that a pointer is indexed to the node (before the one to be removed, or before the insertion point) already, is a constant-time operation (otherwise without this reference it is O(n)), whereas insertion in a dynamic array at random locations will require moving half of the elements on average, and all the elements in the worst case. While one can \"delete\" an element from an array in constant time by somehow marking its slot as \"vacant\", this causes fragmentation that impedes the performance of iteration.\nMoreover, arbitrarily many elements may be inserted into a linked list, limited only by the total memory available; while a dynamic array will eventually fill up its underlying array data structure and will have to reallocate\u2014an expensive operation, one that may not even be possible if memory is fragmented, although the cost of reallocation can be averaged over insertions, and the cost of an insertion due to reallocation would still be amortized O(1). This helps with appending elements at the array's end, but inserting into (or removing from) middle positions still carries prohibitive costs due to data moving to maintain contiguity. An array from which many elements are removed may also have to be resized in order to avoid wasting too much space.\nOn the other hand, dynamic arrays (as well as fixed-size array data structures) allow constant-time random access, while linked lists allow only sequential access to elements. Singly linked lists, in fact, can be easily traversed in only one direction. This makes linked lists unsuitable for applications where it's useful to look up an element by its index quickly, such as heapsort. Sequential access on arrays and dynamic arrays is also faster than on linked lists on many machines, because they have optimal locality of reference and thus make good use of data caching.\nAnother disadvantage of linked lists is the extra storage needed for references, which often makes them impractical for lists of small data items such as characters or Boolean values, because the storage overhead for the links may exceed by a factor of two or more the size of the data. In contrast, a dynamic array requires only the space for the data itself (and a very small amount of control data). It can also be slow, and with a na\u00efve allocator, wasteful, to allocate memory separately for each new element, a problem generally solved using memory pools.\nSome hybrid solutions try to combine the advantages of the two representations. Unrolled linked lists store several elements in each list node, increasing cache performance while decreasing memory overhead for references. CDR coding does both these as well, by replacing references with the actual data referenced, which extends off the end of the referencing record.\nA good example that highlights the pros and cons of using dynamic arrays vs. linked lists is by implementing a program that resolves the Josephus problem. The Josephus problem is an election method that works by having a group of people stand in a circle. Starting at a predetermined person, one may count around the circle \"n\" times. Once the \"n\"th person is reached, one should remove them from the circle and have the members close the circle. The process is repeated until only one person is left. That person wins the election. This shows the strengths and weaknesses of a linked list vs. a dynamic array, because if the people are viewed as connected nodes in a circular linked list, then it shows how easily the linked list is able to delete nodes (as it only has to rearrange the links to the different nodes). However, the linked list will be poor at finding the next person to remove and will need to search through the list until it finds that person. A dynamic array, on the other hand, will be poor at deleting nodes (or elements) as it cannot remove one node without individually shifting all the elements up the list by one. However, it is exceptionally easy to find the \"n\"th person in the circle by directly referencing them by their position in the array.\nThe list ranking problem concerns the efficient conversion of a linked list representation into an array. Although trivial for a conventional computer, solving this problem by a parallel algorithm is complicated and has been the subject of much research.\nA balanced tree has similar memory access patterns and space overhead to a linked list while permitting much more efficient indexing, taking O(log n) time instead of O(n) for a random access. However, insertion and deletion operations are more expensive due to the overhead of tree manipulations to maintain balance. Schemes exist for trees to automatically maintain themselves in a balanced state: AVL trees or red\u2013black trees.\nSingly linked linear lists vs. other lists.\nWhile doubly linked and circular lists have advantages over singly linked linear lists, linear lists offer some advantages that make them preferable in some situations.\nA singly linked linear list is a recursive data structure, because it contains a pointer to a \"smaller\" object of the same type. For that reason, many operations on singly linked linear lists (such as merging two lists, or enumerating the elements in reverse order) often have very simple recursive algorithms, much simpler than any solution using iterative commands. While those recursive solutions can be adapted for doubly linked and circularly linked lists, the procedures generally need extra arguments and more complicated base cases.\nLinear singly linked lists also allow tail-sharing, the use of a common final portion of sub-list as the terminal portion of two different lists. In particular, if a new node is added at the beginning of a list, the former list remains available as the tail of the new one\u2014a simple example of a persistent data structure. Again, this is not true with the other variants: a node may never belong to two different circular or doubly linked lists.\nIn particular, end-sentinel nodes can be shared among singly linked non-circular lists. The same end-sentinel node may be used for \"every\" such list. In Lisp, for example, every proper list ends with a link to a special node, denoted by codice_1 or codice_2.\nThe advantages of the fancy variants are often limited to the complexity of the algorithms, not in their efficiency. A circular list, in particular, can usually be emulated by a linear list together with two variables that point to the first and last nodes, at no extra cost.\nDoubly linked vs. singly linked.\nDouble-linked lists require more space per node (unless one uses XOR-linking), and their elementary operations are more expensive; but they are often easier to manipulate because they allow fast and easy sequential access to the list in both directions. In a doubly linked list, one can insert or delete a node in a constant number of operations given only that node's address. To do the same in a singly linked list, one must have the \"address of the pointer\" to that node, which is either the handle for the whole list (in case of the first node) or the link field in the \"previous\" node. Some algorithms require access in both directions. On the other hand, doubly linked lists do not allow tail-sharing and cannot be used as persistent data structures.\nCircularly linked vs. linearly linked.\nA circularly linked list may be a natural option to represent arrays that are naturally circular, e.g. the corners of a polygon, a pool of buffers that are used and released in FIFO (\"first in, first out\") order, or a set of processes that should be time-shared in round-robin order. In these applications, a pointer to any node serves as a handle to the whole list.\nWith a circular list, a pointer to the last node gives easy access also to the first node, by following one link. Thus, in applications that require access to both ends of the list (e.g., in the implementation of a queue), a circular structure allows one to handle the structure by a single pointer, instead of two.\nA circular list can be split into two circular lists, in constant time, by giving the addresses of the last node of each piece. The operation consists in swapping the contents of the link fields of those two nodes. Applying the same operation to any two nodes in two distinct lists joins the two list into one. This property greatly simplifies some algorithms and data structures, such as the quad-edge and face-edge.\nThe simplest representation for an empty \"circular\" list (when such a thing makes sense) is a null pointer, indicating that the list has no nodes. Without this choice, many algorithms have to test for this special case, and handle it separately. By contrast, the use of null to denote an empty \"linear\" list is more natural and often creates fewer special cases.\nFor some applications, it can be useful to use singly linked lists that can vary between being circular and being linear, or even circular with a linear initial segment. Algorithms for searching or otherwise operating on these have to take precautions to avoid accidentally entering an endless loop. One well-known method is to have a second pointer walking the list at half or double the speed, and if both pointers meet at the same node, a cycle has been found.\nUsing sentinel nodes.\nSentinel node may simplify certain list operations, by ensuring that the next or previous nodes exist for every element, and that even empty lists have at least one node. One may also use a sentinel node at the end of the list, with an appropriate data field, to eliminate some end-of-list tests. For example, when scanning the list looking for a node with a given value \"x\", setting the sentinel's data field to \"x\" makes it unnecessary to test for end-of-list inside the loop. Another example is the merging two sorted lists: if their sentinels have data fields set to +\u221e, the choice of the next output node does not need special handling for empty lists.\nHowever, sentinel nodes use up extra space (especially in applications that use many short lists), and they may complicate other operations (such as the creation of a new empty list).\nHowever, if the circular list is used merely to simulate a linear list, one may avoid some of this complexity by adding a single sentinel node to every list, between the last and the first data nodes. With this convention, an empty list consists of the sentinel node alone, pointing to itself via the next-node link. The list handle should then be a pointer to the last data node, before the sentinel, if the list is not empty; or to the sentinel itself, if the list is empty.\nThe same trick can be used to simplify the handling of a doubly linked linear list, by turning it into a circular doubly linked list with a single sentinel node. However, in this case, the handle should be a single pointer to the dummy node itself.\nLinked list operations.\nWhen manipulating linked lists in-place, care must be taken to not use values that have been invalidated in previous assignments. This makes algorithms for inserting or deleting linked list nodes somewhat subtle. This section gives pseudocode for adding or removing nodes from singly, doubly, and circularly linked lists in-place. Throughout, \"null\" is used to refer to an end-of-list marker or sentinel, which may be implemented in a number of ways.\nLinearly linked lists.\nSingly linked lists.\nThe node data structure will have two fields. There is also a variable, \"firstNode\" which always points to the first node in the list, or is \"null\" for an empty list.\n record \"Node\"\n data; \"// The data being stored in the node\"\n \"Node\" next \"// A reference\" to the next node, null for last node\n record \"List\"\n \"Node\" firstNode \"// points to first node of list; null for empty list\"\nTraversal of a singly linked list is simple, beginning at the first node and following each \"next\" link until reaching the end:\n node := list.firstNode\n while node not null\n \"(do something with node.data)\"\n node := node.next\nThe following code inserts a node after an existing node in a singly linked list. The diagram shows how it works. Inserting a node before an existing one cannot be done directly; instead, one must keep track of the previous node and insert a node after it.\n function insertAfter(\"Node\" node, \"Node\" newNode) \"// insert newNode after node\"\n newNode.next := node.next\n node.next := newNode\nInserting at the beginning of the list requires a separate function. This requires updating \"firstNode\".\n function insertBeginning(\"List\" list, \"Node\" newNode) \"// insert node before current first node\"\n newNode.next := list.firstNode\n list.firstNode := newNode\nSimilarly, there are functions for removing the node \"after\" a given node, and for removing a node from the beginning of the list. The diagram demonstrates the former. To find and remove a particular node, one must again keep track of the previous element.\n function removeAfter(\"Node\" node) \"// remove node past this one\"\n obsoleteNode := node.next\n node.next := node.next.next\n destroy obsoleteNode\n function removeBeginning(\"List\" list) \"// remove first node\"\n obsoleteNode := list.firstNode\n list.firstNode := list.firstNode.next \"// point past deleted node\"\n destroy obsoleteNode\nNotice that codice_3 sets codice_4 to codice_5 when removing the last node in the list.\nSince it is not possible to iterate backwards, efficient codice_6 or codice_7 operations are not possible. Inserting to a list before a specific node requires traversing the list, which would have a worst case running time of O(n).\nAppending one linked list to another can be inefficient unless a reference to the tail is kept as part of the List structure, because it is needed to traverse the entire first list in order to find the tail, and then append the second list to this. Thus, if two linearly linked lists are each of length formula_1, list appending has asymptotic time complexity of formula_2. In the Lisp family of languages, list appending is provided by the codice_8 procedure.\nMany of the special cases of linked list operations can be eliminated by including a dummy element at the front of the list. This ensures that there are no special cases for the beginning of the list and renders both codice_9 and codice_3 unnecessary, i.e., every element or node is next to another node (even the first node is next to the dummy node). In this case, the first useful data in the list will be found at codice_11.\nCircularly linked list.\nIn a circularly linked list, all nodes are linked in a continuous circle, without using \"null.\" For lists with a front and a back (such as a queue), one stores a reference to the last node in the list. The \"next\" node after the last node is the first node. Elements can be added to the back of the list and removed from the front in constant time.\nCircularly linked lists can be either singly or doubly linked.\nBoth types of circularly linked lists benefit from the ability to traverse the full list beginning at any given node. This often allows us to avoid storing \"firstNode\" and \"lastNode\", although if the list may be empty, there needs to be a special representation for the empty list, such as a \"lastNode\" variable which points to some node in the list or is \"null\" if it is empty; it uses such a \"lastNode\" here. This representation significantly simplifies adding and removing nodes with a non-empty list, but empty lists are then a special case.\nAlgorithms.\nAssuming that \"someNode\" is some node in a non-empty circular singly linked list, this code iterates through that list starting with \"someNode\":\n function iterate(someNode)\n if someNode \u2260 null\n node := someNode\n do\n do something with node.value\n node := node.next\n while node \u2260 someNode\nNotice that the test \"while node \u2260 someNode\" must be at the end of the loop. If the test was moved to the beginning of the loop, the procedure would fail whenever the list had only one node.\nThis function inserts a node \"newNode\" into a circular linked list after a given node \"node\". If \"node\" is null, it assumes that the list is empty.\n function insertAfter(\"Node\" node, \"Node\" newNode)\n if node = null // assume list is empty\n newNode.next := newNode\n else\n newNode.next := node.next\n node.next := newNode\n update \"lastNode\" variable if necessary\nSuppose that \"L\" is a variable pointing to the last node of a circular linked list (or null if the list is empty). To append \"newNode\" to the \"end\" of the list, one may do\n insertAfter(L, newNode)\n L := newNode\nTo insert \"newNode\" at the \"beginning\" of the list, one may do\n insertAfter(L, newNode)\n if L = null\n L := newNode\nThis function inserts a value \"newVal\" before a given node \"node\" in O(1) time. A new node has been created between \"node\" and the next node, then puts the value of \"node\" into that new node, and puts \"newVal\" in \"node\". Thus, a singly linked circularly linked list with only a \"firstNode\" variable can both insert to the front and back in O(1) time.\n function insertBefore(\"Node\" node, newVal)\n if node = null // assume list is empty\n newNode := new Node(data:=newVal, next:=newNode)\n else\n newNode := new Node(data:=node.data, next:=node.next)\n node.data := newVal\n node.next := newNode\n update \"firstNode\" variable if necessary\nThis function removes a non-null node from a list of size greater than 1 in O(1) time. It copies data from the next node into the node, and then sets the node's \"next\" pointer to skip over the next node.\n function remove(\"Node\" node)\n if node \u2260 null and size of list &gt; 1\n removedData := node.data\n node.data := node.next.data\n node.next = node.next.next\n return removedData\nLinked lists using arrays of nodes.\nLanguages that do not support any type of reference can still create links by replacing pointers with array indices. The approach is to keep an array of records, where each record has integer fields indicating the index of the next (and possibly previous) node in the array. Not all nodes in the array need be used. If records are also not supported, parallel arrays can often be used instead.\nAs an example, consider the following linked list record that uses arrays instead of pointers:\n record \"Entry\" {\n \"integer\" next; \"// index of next entry in array\"\n \"integer\" prev; \"// previous entry (if double-linked)\"\n \"string\" name;\n \"real\" balance;\nA linked list can be built by creating an array of these structures, and an integer variable to store the index of the first element.\n \"integer\" listHead\n \"Entry\" Records[1000]\nLinks between elements are formed by placing the array index of the next (or previous) cell into the Next or Prev field within a given element. For example:\nIn the above example, codice_12 would be set to 2, the location of the first entry in the list. Notice that entry 3 and 5 through 7 are not part of the list. These cells are available for any additions to the list. By creating a codice_13 integer variable, a free list could be created to keep track of what cells are available. If all entries are in use, the size of the array would have to be increased or some elements would have to be deleted before new entries could be stored in the list.\nThe following code would traverse the list and display names and account balance:\n i := listHead\n while i \u2265 0 \"// loop through the list\"\n print i, Records[i].name, Records[i].balance \"// print entry\"\n i := Records[i].next\nWhen faced with a choice, the advantages of this approach include:\nThis approach has one main disadvantage, however: it creates and manages a private memory space for its nodes. This leads to the following issues:\nFor these reasons, this approach is mainly used for languages that do not support dynamic memory allocation. These disadvantages are also mitigated if the maximum size of the list is known at the time the array is created.\nLanguage support.\nMany programming languages such as Lisp and Scheme have singly linked lists built in. In many functional languages, these lists are constructed from nodes, each called a \"cons\" or \"cons cell\". The cons has two fields: the \"car\", a reference to the data for that node, and the \"cdr\", a reference to the next node. Although cons cells can be used to build other data structures, this is their primary purpose.\nIn languages that support abstract data types or templates, linked list ADTs or templates are available for building linked lists. In other languages, linked lists are typically built using references together with records.\nInternal and external storage.\nWhen constructing a linked list, one is faced with the choice of whether to store the data of the list directly in the linked list nodes, called \"internal storage\", or merely to store a reference to the data, called \"external storage\". Internal storage has the advantage of making access to the data more efficient, requiring less storage overall, having better locality of reference, and simplifying memory management for the list (its data is allocated and deallocated at the same time as the list nodes).\nExternal storage, on the other hand, has the advantage of being more generic, in that the same data structure and machine code can be used for a linked list no matter what the size of the data is. It also makes it easy to place the same data in multiple linked lists. Although with internal storage the same data can be placed in multiple lists by including multiple \"next\" references in the node data structure, it would then be necessary to create separate routines to add or delete cells based on each field. It is possible to create additional linked lists of elements that use internal storage by using external storage, and having the cells of the additional linked lists store references to the nodes of the linked list containing the data.\nIn general, if a set of data structures needs to be included in linked lists, external storage is the best approach. If a set of data structures need to be included in only one linked list, then internal storage is slightly better, unless a generic linked list package using external storage is available. Likewise, if different sets of data that can be stored in the same data structure are to be included in a single linked list, then internal storage would be fine.\nAnother approach that can be used with some languages involves having different data structures, but all have the initial fields, including the \"next\" (and \"prev\" if double linked list) references in the same location. After defining separate structures for each type of data, a generic structure can be defined that contains the minimum amount of data shared by all the other structures and contained at the top (beginning) of the structures. Then generic routines can be created that use the minimal structure to perform linked list type operations, but separate routines can then handle the specific data. This approach is often used in message parsing routines, where several types of messages are received, but all start with the same set of fields, usually including a field for message type. The generic routines are used to add new messages to a queue when they are received, and remove them from the queue in order to process the message. The message type field is then used to call the correct routine to process the specific type of message.\nExample of internal and external storage.\nTo create a linked list of families and their members, using internal storage, the structure might look like the following:\n record \"member\" { \"// member of a family\"\n \"member\" next;\n \"string\" firstName;\n \"integer\" age;\n record \"family\" { \"// the family itself\"\n \"family\" next;\n \"string\" lastName;\n \"string\" address;\n \"member\" members \"// head of list of members of this family\"\nTo print a complete list of families and their members using internal storage, write:\n aFamily := Families \"// start at head of families list\"\n while aFamily \u2260 null \"// loop through list of families\"\n print information about family\n aMember := aFamily.members \"// get head of list of this family's members\"\n while aMember \u2260 null \"// loop through list of members\"\n print information about member\n aMember := aMember.next\n aFamily := aFamily.next\nUsing external storage, the following structures can be created:\n record \"node\" { \"// generic link structure\"\n \"node\" next;\n \"pointer\" data \"// generic pointer for data at node\"\n record \"member\" { \"// structure for family member\"\n \"string\" firstName;\n \"integer\" age\n record \"family\" { \"// structure for family\"\n \"string\" lastName;\n \"string\" address;\n \"node\" members \"// head of list of members of this family\"\nTo print a complete list of families and their members using external storage, write:\n famNode := Families \"// start at head of families list\"\n while famNode \u2260 null \"// loop through list of families\"\n aFamily := (family) famNode.data \"// extract family from node\"\n print information about family\n memNode := aFamily.members \"// get list of family members\"\n while memNode \u2260 null \"// loop through list of members\"\n aMember := (member)memNode.data \"// extract member from node\"\n print information about member\n memNode := memNode.next\n famNode := famNode.next\nNotice that when using external storage, an extra step is needed to extract the record from the node and cast it into the proper data type. This is because both the list of families and the list of members within the family are stored in two linked lists using the same data structure (\"node\"), and this language does not have parametric types.\nAs long as the number of families that a member can belong to is known at compile time, internal storage works fine. If, however, a member needed to be included in an arbitrary number of families, with the specific number known only at run time, external storage would be necessary.\nSpeeding up search.\nFinding a specific element in a linked list, even if it is sorted, normally requires O(\"n\") time (linear search). This is one of the primary disadvantages of linked lists over other data structures. In addition to the variants discussed above, below are two simple ways to improve search time.\nIn an unordered list, one simple heuristic for decreasing average search time is the \"move-to-front heuristic\", which simply moves an element to the beginning of the list once it is found. This scheme, handy for creating simple caches, ensures that the most recently used items are also the quickest to find again.\nAnother common approach is to \"index\" a linked list using a more efficient external data structure. For example, one can build a red\u2013black tree or hash table whose elements are references to the linked list nodes. Multiple such indexes can be built on a single list. The disadvantage is that these indexes may need to be updated each time a node is added or removed (or at least, before that index is used again).\nRandom-access lists.\nA random-access list is a list with support for fast random access to read or modify any element in the list. One possible implementation is a skew binary random-access list using the skew binary number system, which involves a list of trees with special properties; this allows worst-case constant time head/cons operations, and worst-case logarithmic time random access to an element by index. Random-access lists can be implemented as persistent data structures.\nRandom-access lists can be viewed as immutable linked lists in that they likewise support the same O(1) head and tail operations.\nA simple extension to random-access lists is the min-list, which provides an additional operation that yields the minimum element in the entire list in constant time (without mutation complexities).\nRelated data structures.\nBoth stacks and queues are often implemented using linked lists, and simply restrict the type of operations which are supported.\nThe skip list is a linked list augmented with layers of pointers for quickly jumping over large numbers of elements, and then descending to the next layer. This process continues down to the bottom layer, which is the actual list.\nA binary tree can be seen as a type of linked list where the elements are themselves linked lists of the same nature. The result is that each node may include a reference to the first node of one or two other linked lists, which, together with their contents, form the subtrees below that node.\nAn unrolled linked list is a linked list in which each node contains an array of data values. This leads to improved cache performance, since more list elements are contiguous in memory, and reduced memory overhead, because less metadata needs to be stored for each element of the list.\nA hash table may use linked lists to store the chains of items that hash to the same position in the hash table.\nA heap shares some of the ordering properties of a linked list, but is almost always implemented using an array. Instead of references from node to node, the next and previous data indexes are calculated using the current data's index.\nA self-organizing list rearranges its nodes based on some heuristic which reduces search times for data retrieval by keeping commonly accessed nodes at the head of the list.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Depending on the context, the term may refer to an ideal logic gate, one that has, for instance, zero rise time and unlimited fan-out, or it may refer to a non-ideal physical device (see ideal and real op-amps for comparison).\nThe primary way of building logic gates uses diodes or transistors acting as electronic switches. Today, most logic gates are made from MOSFETs (metal\u2013oxide\u2013semiconductor field-effect transistors). They can also be constructed using vacuum tubes, electromagnetic relays with relay logic, fluidic logic, pneumatic logic, optics, molecules, acoustics, or even mechanical or thermal elements.\nLogic gates can be cascaded in the same way that Boolean functions can be composed, allowing the construction of a physical model of all of Boolean logic, and therefore, all of the algorithms and mathematics that can be described with Boolean logic. Logic circuits include such devices as multiplexers, registers, arithmetic logic units (ALUs), and computer memory, all the way up through complete microprocessors, which may contain more than 100 million logic gates.\nCompound logic gates AND-OR-invert (AOI) and OR-AND-invert (OAI) are often employed in circuit design because their construction using MOSFETs is simpler and more efficient than the sum of the individual gates.\nHistory and development.\nThe binary number system was refined by Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz (published in 1705), influenced by the ancient \"I Ching\"'s binary system. Leibniz established that using the binary system combined the principles of arithmetic and logic.\nThe analytical engine devised by Charles Babbage in 1837 used mechanical logic gates based on gears.\nIn an 1886 letter, Charles Sanders Peirce described how logical operations could be carried out by electrical switching circuits. Early Electromechanical computers were constructed from switches and relay logic rather than the later innovations of vacuum tubes (thermionic valves) or transistors (from which later electronic computers were constructed). Ludwig Wittgenstein introduced a version of the 16-row truth table as proposition 5.101 of \"Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus\" (1921). Walther Bothe, inventor of the coincidence circuit, got part of the 1954 Nobel Prize in physics, for the first modern electronic AND gate in 1924. Konrad Zuse designed and built electromechanical logic gates for his computer Z1 (from 1935 to 1938).\nFrom 1934 to 1936, NEC engineer Akira Nakashima, Claude Shannon and Victor Shestakov introduced switching circuit theory in a series of papers showing that two-valued Boolean algebra, which they discovered independently, can describe the operation of switching circuits. Using this property of electrical switches to implement logic is the fundamental concept that underlies all electronic digital computers. Switching circuit theory became the foundation of digital circuit design, as it became widely known in the electrical engineering community during and after World War II, with theoretical rigor superseding the \"ad hoc\" methods that had prevailed previously.\nIn 1948, Bardeen and Brattain patented an insulated-gate transistor (IGFET) with an inversion layer. Their concept forms the basis of CMOS technology today. In 1957, Frosch and Derick were able to manufacture PMOS and NMOS planar gates. Later a team at Bell Labs demonstrated a working MOS with PMOS and NMOS gates. Both types were later combined and adapted into complementary MOS (CMOS) logic by Chih-Tang Sah and Frank Wanlass at Fairchild Semiconductor in 1963.\nSymbols.\nThere are two sets of symbols for elementary logic gates in common use, both defined in ANSI/IEEE Std 91-1984 and its supplement ANSI/IEEE Std 91a-1991. The \"distinctive shape\" set, based on traditional schematics, is used for simple drawings and derives from United States Military Standard MIL-STD-806 of the 1950s and 1960s. It is sometimes unofficially described as \"military\", reflecting its origin. The \"rectangular shape\" set, based on ANSI Y32.14 and other early industry standards as later refined by IEEE and IEC, has rectangular outlines for all types of gate and allows representation of a much wider range of devices than is possible with the traditional symbols. The IEC standard, IEC 60617-12, has been adopted by other standards, such as EN 60617-12:1999 in Europe, BS EN 60617-12:1999 in the United Kingdom, and DIN EN 60617-12:1998 in Germany.\nThe mutual goal of IEEE Std 91-1984 and IEC 617-12 was to provide a uniform method of describing the complex logic functions of digital circuits with schematic symbols. These functions were more complex than simple AND and OR gates. They could be medium-scale circuits such as a 4-bit counter to a large-scale circuit such as a microprocessor.\nIEC 617-12 and its renumbered successor IEC 60617-12 do not explicitly show the \"distinctive shape\" symbols, but do not prohibit them. These are, however, shown in ANSI/IEEE Std 91 (and 91a) with this note: \"The distinctive-shape symbol is, according to IEC Publication 617, Part 12, not preferred, but is not considered to be in contradiction to that standard.\" IEC 60617-12 correspondingly contains the note (Section 2.1) \"Although non-preferred, the use of other symbols recognized by official national standards, that is distinctive shapes in place of symbols [list of basic gates], shall not be considered to be in contradiction with this standard. Usage of these other symbols in combination to form complex symbols (for example, use as embedded symbols) is discouraged.\" This compromise was reached between the respective IEEE and IEC working groups to permit the IEEE and IEC standards to be in mutual compliance with one another.\nIn the 1980s, schematics were the predominant method to design both circuit boards and custom ICs known as gate arrays. Today custom ICs and the field-programmable gate array are typically designed with Hardware Description Languages (HDL) such as Verilog or VHDL.\nDe Morgan equivalent symbols.\nBy use of De Morgan's laws, an \"AND\" function is identical to an \"OR\" function with negated inputs and outputs. Likewise, an \"OR\" function is identical to an \"AND\" function with negated inputs and outputs. A NAND gate is equivalent to an OR gate with negated inputs, and a NOR gate is equivalent to an AND gate with negated inputs.\nThis leads to an alternative set of symbols for basic gates that use the opposite core symbol (\"AND\" or \"OR\") but with the inputs and outputs negated. Use of these alternative symbols can make logic circuit diagrams much clearer and help to show accidental connection of an active high output to an active low input or vice versa. Any connection that has logic negations at both ends can be replaced by a negationless connection and a suitable change of gate or vice versa. Any connection that has a negation at one end and no negation at the other can be made easier to interpret by instead using the De Morgan equivalent symbol at either of the two ends. When negation or polarity indicators on both ends of a connection match, there is no logic negation in that path (effectively, bubbles \"cancel\"), making it easier to follow logic states from one symbol to the next. This is commonly seen in real logic diagrams \u2013 thus the reader must not get into the habit of associating the shapes exclusively as OR or AND shapes, but also take into account the bubbles at both inputs and outputs in order to determine the \"true\" logic function indicated.\nA De Morgan symbol can show more clearly a gate's primary logical purpose and the polarity of its nodes that are considered in the \"signaled\" (active, on) state. Consider the simplified case where a two-input NAND gate is used to drive a motor when either of its inputs are brought low by a switch. The \"signaled\" state (motor on) occurs when either one OR the other switch is on. Unlike a regular NAND symbol, which suggests AND logic, the De Morgan version, a two negative-input OR gate, correctly shows that OR is of interest. The regular NAND symbol has a bubble at the output and none at the inputs (the opposite of the states that will turn the motor on), but the De Morgan symbol shows both inputs and output in the polarity that will drive the motor.\nDe Morgan's theorem is most commonly used to implement logic gates as combinations of only NAND gates, or as combinations of only NOR gates, for economic reasons.\nTruth tables.\nOutput comparison of various logic gates:\nUniversal logic gates.\nCharles Sanders Peirce (during 1880\u20131881) showed that NOR gates alone (or alternatively NAND gates alone) can be used to reproduce the functions of all the other logic gates, but his work on it was unpublished until 1933. The first published proof was by Henry M. Sheffer in 1913, so the NAND logical operation is sometimes called \"Sheffer stroke\"; the logical NOR is sometimes called \"Peirce's arrow\". Consequently, these gates are sometimes called \"universal logic gates\".\nData storage and sequential logic.\nLogic gates can also be used to hold a state, allowing data storage. A storage element can be constructed by connecting several gates in a \"latch\" circuit. Latching circuitry is used in static random-access memory. More complicated designs that use clock signals and that change only on a rising or falling edge of the clock are called edge-triggered \"flip-flops\". Formally, a flip-flop is called a bistable circuit, because it has two stable states which it can maintain indefinitely. The combination of multiple flip-flops in parallel, used to store a multiple-bit value, is known as a register. When using any of these gate setups the overall system has memory; it is then called a sequential logic system since its output can be influenced by its previous state(s), i.e. by the \"sequence\" of input states. In contrast, the output from combinational logic is purely a combination of its present inputs, unaffected by the previous input and output states.\nThese logic circuits are used in computer memory. They vary in performance, based on factors of speed, complexity, and reliability of storage, and many different types of designs are used based on the application.\nManufacturing.\nElectronic gates.\nA functionally complete logic system may be composed of relays, valves (vacuum tubes), or transistors.\nElectronic logic gates differ significantly from their relay-and-switch equivalents. They are much faster, consume much less power, and are much smaller (all by a factor of a million or more in most cases). Also, there is a fundamental structural difference. The switch circuit creates a continuous metallic path for current to flow (in either direction) between its input and its output. The semiconductor logic gate, on the other hand, acts as a high-gain voltage amplifier, which sinks a tiny current at its input and produces a low-impedance voltage at its output. It is not possible for current to flow between the output and the input of a semiconductor logic gate.\nFor small-scale logic, designers now use prefabricated logic gates from families of devices such as the TTL 7400 series by Texas Instruments, the CMOS 4000 series by RCA, and their more recent descendants. Increasingly, these fixed-function logic gates are being replaced by programmable logic devices, which allow designers to pack many mixed logic gates into a single integrated circuit. The field-programmable nature of programmable logic devices such as FPGAs has reduced the \"hard\" property of hardware; it is now possible to change the logic design of a hardware system by reprogramming some of its components, thus allowing the features or function of a hardware implementation of a logic system to be changed.\nAn important advantage of standardized integrated circuit logic families, such as the 7400 and 4000 families, is that they can be cascaded. This means that the output of one gate can be wired to the inputs of one or several other gates, and so on. Systems with varying degrees of complexity can be built without great concern of the designer for the internal workings of the gates, provided the limitations of each integrated circuit are considered.\nThe output of one gate can only drive a finite number of inputs to other gates, a number called the \"fan-out limit\". Also, there is always a delay, called the \"propagation delay\", from a change in input of a gate to the corresponding change in its output. When gates are cascaded, the total propagation delay is approximately the sum of the individual delays, an effect which can become a problem in high-speed synchronous circuits. Additional delay can be caused when many inputs are connected to an output, due to the distributed capacitance of all the inputs and wiring and the finite amount of current that each output can provide.\nLogic families.\nThere are several logic families with different characteristics (power consumption, speed, cost, size) such as: RDL (resistor\u2013diode logic), RTL (resistor-transistor logic), DTL (diode\u2013transistor logic), TTL (transistor\u2013transistor logic) and CMOS. There are also sub-variants, e.g. standard CMOS logic vs. advanced types using still CMOS technology, but with some optimizations for avoiding loss of speed due to slower PMOS transistors.\nThe simplest family of logic gates uses bipolar transistors, and is called resistor\u2013transistor logic (RTL). Unlike simple diode logic gates (which do not have a gain element), RTL gates can be cascaded indefinitely to produce more complex logic functions. RTL gates were used in early integrated circuits. For higher speed and better density, the resistors used in RTL were replaced by diodes resulting in diode\u2013transistor logic (DTL). Transistor\u2013transistor logic (TTL) then supplanted DTL.\nAs integrated circuits became more complex, bipolar transistors were replaced with smaller field-effect transistors (MOSFETs); see PMOS and NMOS. To reduce power consumption still further, most contemporary chip implementations of digital systems now use CMOS logic. CMOS uses complementary (both n-channel and p-channel) MOSFET devices to achieve a high speed with low power dissipation.\nOther types of logic gates include, but are not limited to:\nThree-state logic gates.\nA three-state logic gate is a type of logic gate that can have three different outputs: high (H), low (L) and high-impedance (Z). The high-impedance state plays no role in the logic, which is strictly binary. These devices are used on buses of the CPU to allow multiple chips to send data. A group of three-state outputs driving a line with a suitable control circuit is basically equivalent to a multiplexer, which may be physically distributed over separate devices or plug-in cards.\nIn electronics, a high output would mean the output is sourcing current from the positive power terminal (positive voltage). A low output would mean the output is sinking current to the negative power terminal (zero voltage). High impedance would mean that the output is effectively disconnected from the circuit.\nNon-electronic logic gates.\nNon-electronic implementations are varied, though few of them are used in practical applications. Many early electromechanical digital computers, such as the Harvard Mark I, were built from relay logic gates, using electro-mechanical relays. Logic gates can be made using pneumatic devices, such as the Sorteberg relay or mechanical logic gates, including on a molecular scale. Various types of fundamental logic gates have been constructed using molecules (molecular logic gates), which are based on chemical inputs and spectroscopic outputs. Logic gates have been made out of DNA (see DNA nanotechnology) and used to create a computer called MAYA (see MAYA-II). Logic gates can be made from quantum mechanical effects, see quantum logic gate. Photonic logic gates use nonlinear optical effects.\nIn principle any method that leads to a gate that is functionally complete (for example, either a NOR or a NAND gate) can be used to make any kind of digital logic circuit. Note that the use of 3-state logic for bus systems is not needed, and can be replaced by digital multiplexers, which can be built using only simple logic gates (such as NAND gates, NOR gates, or AND and OR gates).\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "18171", "revid": "205204", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18171", "title": "Linear search", "text": "Sequentially looking in an array\nIn computer science, linear search or sequential search is a method for finding an element within a list. It sequentially checks each element of the list until a match is found or the whole list has been searched.\nA linear search runs in linear time in the worst case, and makes at most \"n\" comparisons, where \"n\" is the length of the list. If each element is equally likely to be searched, then linear search has an average case of comparisons, but the average case can be affected if the search probabilities for each element vary. Linear search is rarely practical because other search algorithms and schemes, such as the binary search algorithm and hash tables, allow significantly faster searching for all but short lists.\nAlgorithm.\nA linear search sequentially checks each element of the list until it finds an element that matches the target value. If the algorithm reaches the end of the list, the search terminates unsuccessfully.\nBasic algorithm.\nGiven a list \"L\" of \"n\" elements with values or records \"L\"0 ... \"L\"\"n\"\u22121, and target value \"T\", the following subroutine uses linear search to find the index of the target \"T\" in \"L\".\n \"T\", the search terminates successfully; return \"i\".\nWith a sentinel.\nThe basic algorithm above makes two comparisons per iteration: one to check if \"L\"\"i\" equals \"T\", and the other to check if \"i\" still points to a valid index of the list. By adding an extra record \"L\"\"n\" to the list (a sentinel value) that equals the target, the second comparison can be eliminated until the end of the search, making the algorithm faster. The search will reach the sentinel if the target is not contained within the list.\n \"T\", go to step 4.\nIn an ordered table.\nIf the list is ordered such that \"L\"0 \u2264 \"L\"1 ... \u2264 \"L\"\"n\"\u22121, the search can establish the absence of the target more quickly by concluding the search once \"L\"\"i\" exceeds the target. This variation requires a sentinel that is greater than the target.\n \"T\", the search terminates successfully; return \"i\". Else, the search terminates unsuccessfully.\nAnalysis.\nFor a list with \"n\" items, the best case is when the value is equal to the first element of the list, in which case only one comparison is needed. The worst case is when the value is not in the list (or occurs only once at the end of the list), in which case \"n\" comparisons are needed.\nIf the value being sought occurs \"k\" times in the list, and all orderings of the list are equally likely, the expected number of comparisons is\nformula_1\nFor example, if the value being sought occurs once in the list, and all orderings of the list are equally likely, the expected number of comparisons is formula_2. However, if it is \"known\" that it occurs once, then at most \"n\" \u2212 1 comparisons are needed, and the expected number of comparisons is \nformula_3\n(for example, for \"n\" = 2 this is 1, corresponding to a single if-then-else construct).\nEither way, asymptotically the worst-case cost and the expected cost of linear search are both O(\"n\").\nNon-uniform probabilities.\nThe performance of linear search improves if the desired value is more likely to be near the beginning of the list than to its end. Therefore, if some values are much more likely to be searched than others, it is desirable to place them at the beginning of the list.\nIn particular, when the list items are arranged in order of decreasing probability, and these probabilities are geometrically distributed, the cost of linear search is only O(1). \nIn general, if items are arranged in order of decreasing probability and the probability of searching for the \"i\"th element is formula_4, the expected cost of a single search is formula_5. Under the natural assumption\nthat the probabilities are not known in advance, or one cannot spend the time to sort the list by probabilities, one can use the\napproach of \"self-adjusting data structure\" and move elements towards the head of the list when they are requested in a search.\nTwo natural heuristics for this self-adjustment are \"Move to Front\" (MF) and \"Transpose\" (T), where the requested element \ntrades places with its predecessor. It is known that the expected cost of an access in a large sequence of independent accesses,\naveraged over all initial orders of the list, satisfies formula_6.\nIn terms of amortized cost, averaging over a worst-case sequence of operations (note - among sequences satisfying the assumption on probabilities), we have formula_7, while formula_8 can be as bad as formula_9.\nApplication.\nLinear search is usually very simple to implement, and is practical when the list has only a few elements, or when performing a single search in an unordered list.\nWhen many values have to be searched in the same list, it often pays to preprocess the list in order to use a faster method. For example, one may sort the list and use binary search, or build an efficient search data structure from it. Should the content of the list change frequently, repeated reorganization may be more trouble than it is worth.\nAs a result, even though in theory other search algorithms may be faster than linear search (for instance binary search), in practice even on medium-sized arrays (around 100 items or less) it might be infeasible to use anything else. On larger arrays, it only makes sense to use other, faster search methods if the data is large enough, because the initial time to prepare (sort) the data is comparable to many linear searches.\nReferences.\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Land mines are divided into two types: anti-tank mines, which are designed to disable tanks or other vehicles; and anti-personnel mines, designed to injure or kill people.\nLand mines are typically pressure activated, exploding automatically when stepped on by a person or driven over by a vehicle, though alternative detonation mechanisms are sometimes used. A land mine may cause damage by direct blast effect, by fragments that are thrown by the blast, or by both. Land mines are typically laid throughout an area, creating a \"minefield\" which is dangerous to cross.\nThe use of land mines is controversial because of their indiscriminate nature and their potential to remain dangerous many years after a conflict has ended, harming civilians and the economy. With pressure from a number of campaign groups organised through the International Campaign to Ban Landmines, a global movement to prohibit their use led to the 1997 Convention on the Prohibition of the Use, Stockpiling, Production and Transfer of Anti-Personnel Mines and on their Destruction, also known as the \"Ottawa Treaty\". To date, 164 nations have signed the treaty. However, China, Russia, and the United States are not signatories.\nDefinition.\nThe Anti-Personnel Mine Ban Convention (also known as the Ottawa Treaty) and the Protocol on Mines, Booby-Traps and Other Devices define a mine as a \"munition designed to be placed under, on or near the ground or other surface area and to be exploded by the presence, proximity or contact of a person or vehicle\". Similar in function is the \"booby-trap\", which the protocol defines as \"any device or material which is designed, constructed or adapted to kill or injure and which functions unexpectedly when a person disturbs or approaches an apparently harmless object or performs an apparently safe act\". Such actions might include opening a door or picking up an object. Normally, mines are mass-produced and placed in groups, while booby traps are improvised and deployed one at a time. Booby traps can also be non-explosive devices such as punji sticks. Overlapping both categories is the \"improvised explosive device\" (IED), which is \"a device placed or fabricated in an improvised manner incorporating explosive material, destructive, lethal, noxious, incendiary, pyrotechnic materials or chemicals designed to destroy, disfigure, distract or harass. They may incorporate military stores, but are normally devised from non-military components.\" Some meet the definition of mines or booby traps and are also referred to as \"improvised\", \"artisanal\" or \"locally manufactured\" mines. Other types of IED are remotely activated, so are not considered mines.\n\"Remotely delivered mines\" are dropped from aircraft or carried by devices such as artillery shells or rockets. Another type of remotely delivered explosive is the cluster munition, a device that releases several submunitions (\"bomblets\") over a large area. The use, transfer, production, and stockpiling of cluster munitions is prohibited by the international CCM treaty. If bomblets do not explode, they are referred to as \"unexploded ordnance\" (UXO), along with unexploded artillery shells and other explosive devices that were not manually placed (that is, mines and booby traps are not UXOs). \"Explosive remnants of war\" (ERW) include UXOs and \"abandoned explosive ordnance\" (AXO), devices that were never used and were left behind after a conflict.\nHistory.\nThe history of land mines can be divided into three main phases: In the ancient world, buried spikes provided many of the same functions as modern mines. Mines using gunpowder as the explosive were used from the Ming dynasty to the American Civil War. Subsequently, high explosives were developed for use in land mines.\nBefore explosives.\nSome fortifications in the Roman Empire were surrounded by a series of hazards buried in the ground. These included \"goads\", pieces of wood with iron hooks on their ends; \"lilia\" (lilies, so named after their appearance), which were pits in which sharpened logs were arranged in a five-point pattern; and \"abatis\", fallen trees with sharpened branches facing outwards. As with modern land mines, they were \"victim-operated\", often concealed, and complicated attempts by the enemy to remove the obstacles by making them vulnerable to projectiles such as spears. A notable use of these defenses was by Julius Caesar in the Battle of Alesia. His forces were besieging Vercingetorix, the leader of the Gauls, but Vercingetorix managed to send for reinforcements. To maintain the siege and defend against the reinforcements, Caesar formed a line of fortifications on both sides, and they played an important role in his victory. Lilies were also used by Scots against the English at the Battle of Bannockburn in 1314, and by Germans at the Battle of Passchendaele in the First World War.\nA more easily deployed defense used by the Romans was the caltrop, a weapon across with four sharp spikes that are oriented so that when it is thrown on the ground, one spike always points up. As with modern antipersonnel mines, caltrops are designed to disable soldiers rather than kill them; they are also more effective in stopping mounted forces, who lack the advantage of being able to carefully scrutinize each step they take (though forcing foot-mounted forces to take the time to do so has benefits in and of itself). They were used by the Jin dynasty in China at the Battle of Zhongdu to slow down the advance of Genghis Khan's army; Joan of Arc was wounded by one in the Siege of Orl\u00e9ans; in Japan they are known as \"tetsu-bishi\" and were used by ninjas from the fourteenth century onward. Caltrops are still strung together and used as roadblocks in some modern conflicts.\nGunpowder.\nEast Asia.\nGunpowder, an explosive mixture of sulfur, charcoal and potassium nitrate was invented in China by the 10th century and was used in warfare soon after. An \"enormous bomb\", credited to Lou Qianxia, was used in 1277 by the Chinese at the Battle of Zhongdu.\nA 14th-century military treatise, the \"Huolongjing\" (\"Fire Dragon Manual\"), describes hollow cast iron cannonball shells filled with gunpowder. The wad of the mine was made of hard wood, carrying three different fuses in case of defective connection to the touch hole. These fuses were long and lit by hand, so they required carefully timed calculations of enemy movements.\nThe \"Huolongjing\" also describes land mines that were set off by enemy movement. A length of bamboo was waterproofed by wrapping it in cowhide and covering it with oil. It was filled with compressed gunpowder and lead or iron pellets, sealed with wax and concealed in a trench. The triggering mechanism was not fully described until the early 17th\u00a0century. When the enemy stepped onto hidden boards, they dislodged a pin, causing a weight to fall. A cord attached to the weight was wrapped around a drum attached to two steel wheels; when the weight fell, the wheels struck sparks against flint, igniting a set of fuses leading to multiple mines. A similar mechanism was used in the first wheellock musket in Europe as sketched by Leonardo da Vinci around 1500\u00a0AD.\nAnother victim-operated device was the \"underground sky-soaring thunder\", which lured bounty hunters with halberds, pikes, and lances planted in the ground. If they pulled on one of these weapons, the butt end disturbed a bowl underneath and a slow-burning incandescent material in the bowl ignited the fuses.\nWestern world.\nAt Augsburg in 1573, three centuries after the Chinese invented the first pressure-operated mine, a German military engineer by the name of Samuel Zimmermann invented the \"Fladdermine\" (flying mine). It consisted of around a kilogram (a few pounds) of black powder buried near the surface and was activated by stepping on it or tripping a wire that made a flintlock fire. Such mines were deployed on the slope in front of a fort. They were used during the Franco-Prussian War, but were probably not very effective because a flintlock does not work for long when left untended.\nThe fougasse, was a precursor of modern fragmentation mines and the claymore mine. It consisted of a cone-shape hole with gunpowder at the bottom, covered either by rocks and scrap iron (\"stone fougasse\") or mortar shells, similar to large black powder hand grenades (\"shell fougasse\"). It was triggered by a flintlock connected to a tripwire on the surface. It could sometimes cause heavy casualties but required high maintenance due to the susceptibility of black powder to dampness. Consequently, it was mainly employed in the defenses of major fortifications, in which role it used in several European wars of the eighteenth century and the American Revolution.\nEarly land mines suffered from unreliable fuses which were vulnerable to damp. This changed with the invention of the safety fuse. Later, \"command initiation\", the ability to detonate a charge immediately instead of waiting several minutes for a fuse to burn, became possible after electricity was developed. An electric current sent down a wire could ignite the charge with a spark. The Russians claim first use of this technology in the Russo-Turkish War of 1828\u20131829, and with it the fougasse remained useful until it was superseded by the Claymore mine in the 1960s.\nVictim-activated mines were also unreliable because they relied on a flintlock to ignite the explosive. The percussion cap, developed in the early 19th century, made them much more reliable, and pressure-operated mines were deployed on land and sea in the Crimean War (1853\u20131856).\nDuring the American Civil War, the Confederate brigadier general Gabriel J. Rains deployed thousands of \"torpedoes\" consisting of artillery shells with pressure caps, beginning with the Battle of Yorktown in 1862. As a captain, Rains had earlier employed explosive booby traps during the Seminole Wars in Florida in 1840. Over the course of the war, mines only caused a few hundred casualties, but they had a large effect on morale and slowed down the advance of Union troops. Many on both sides considered the use of mines barbaric, and in response, generals in the Union Army forced Confederate prisoners to remove the mines.\nHigh explosives.\nStarting in the 19th century, more powerful explosives than gunpowder were developed, often for non-military reasons such as blasting train tunnels in the Alps and Rockies. Guncotton, up to four times more powerful than gunpowder, was invented by Christian Schonbein in 1846. It was dangerous to make until Frederick Augustus Abel developed a safe method in 1865. From the 1870s to the First World War, it was the standard explosive used by the British military.\nIn 1847, Ascanio Sobrero invented nitroglycerine to treat angina pectoris and it turned out to be a much more powerful explosive than guncotton. It was very dangerous to use until Alfred Nobel formulated a solid mixture he called dynamite and paired it with a safe detonator he developed. Even then, dynamite needed to be stored carefully or it could form crystals that detonated easily. Thus, the military still preferred guncotton.\nIn 1863, the German chemical industry developed trinitrotoluene (TNT). This had the advantage that it was difficult to detonate, so it could withstand the shock of firing by artillery pieces. It was also advantageous for land mines for several reasons: it was not detonated by the shock of shells landing nearby; it was lightweight, unaffected by damp, and stable under a wide range of conditions; it could be melted to fill a container of any shape, and it was cheap to make. Thus, it became the standard explosive in mines after the First World War.\nBetween the American Civil War and the First World War.\nThe British used mines in the Siege of Khartoum. A Sudanese Mahdist force much larger than British strength was held off for ten months, but the town was ultimately taken and the British massacred. In the Boer War (1899\u20131903), they succeeded in holding Mafeking against Boer forces with the help of a mixture of real and fake minefields; and they laid mines alongside railroad tracks to discourage sabotage.\nIn the Russo-Japanese War of 1904\u20131905, both sides used land and sea mines, although the effect on land mainly affected morale. The naval mines were far more effective, destroying several battleships.\nFirst World War.\nOne sign of the increasing power of explosives used in land mines was that, by the First World War, they burst into about 1,000 high-velocity fragments; in the Franco-Prussian War (1870), it had only been 20 to 30 fragments. Nevertheless, anti-personnel mines were not a big factor in the war because machine guns, barbed wire and rapid-fire artillery were far more effective defenses. An exception was in Africa (now Tanzania and Namibia) where the warfare was much more mobile.\nTowards the end of the war, the British started to use tanks to break through trench defenses. The Germans responded with anti-tank guns and mines. Improvised mines gave way to mass-produced mines consisting of wooden boxes filled with guncotton, and minefields were standardized to stop masses of tanks from advancing.\nBetween world wars, the future Allies did little work on land mines, but the Germans developed a series of anti-tank mines, the \"Tellermines\" (plate mines). They also developed the \"Schrapnell mine\" (also known as the S-mine), the first bounding mine. When triggered, this jumped up to about waist height and exploded, sending thousands of steel balls in all directions. Triggered by pressure, trip wires or electronics, it could harm soldiers within an area of about .\nSecond World War.\nTens of millions of mines were laid in the Second World War, particularly in the deserts of North Africa and the steppes of Eastern Europe, where the open ground favored tanks. However, the first country to use them was Finland. They were defending against a much larger Soviet force with over 6,000 tanks, twenty times the number the Finns had; but they had terrain that was broken up by lakes and forests, so tank movement was restricted to roads and tracks. Their defensive line, the Mannerheim Line, integrated these natural defenses with mines, including simple fragmentation mines mounted on stakes.\nWhile the Germans were advancing rapidly using \"blitzkrieg\" tactics, they did not make much use of mines. After 1942, however, they were on the defensive and became the most inventive and systematic users of mines. Their production shot up and they began inventing new types of mines as the Allies found ways to counter the existing ones. To make it more difficult to remove antitank mines, they surrounded them with S-mines and added anti-handling devices that would explode when soldiers tried to lift them. They also took a formal approach to laying mines and they kept detailed records of the locations of mines.\nIn the Second Battle of El Alamein in 1942, the Germans prepared for an Allied attack by laying about half a million mines in two fields running across the entire battlefield and five miles deep. Nicknamed the \"Devil's gardens\", they were covered by 88 mm anti-tank guns and small-arms fire. The Allies prevailed, but at the cost of over half their tanks; 20 percent of the losses were caused by mines.\nThe Soviets learned the value of mines from their war with Finland, and when Germany invaded they made heavy use of them, manufacturing over 67 million. At the Battle of Kursk, which put an end to the German advance, they laid over a million mines in eight belts with an overall depth of .\nMines forced tanks to slow down and wait for soldiers to go ahead and remove the mines. The main method of breaching minefields involved prodding the dirt with a bayonet or stick at an angle of 30 degrees to avoid pressuring the top of the mine. Since all mines at the beginning of the war had metal casings, metal detectors could be used to speed up the locating of mines. A Polish officer, J\u00f3zef Kosacki, developed a portable mine detector known as the Polish mine detector. To counter the detector, Germans developed mines with wooden casings, the Sch\u00fc-mine 42 (anti-personnel) and Holzmine 42 (anti-tank). Effective, cheap and easy to make, the Sch\u00fc-mine became the most common mine in the war. Mine casings were also made of glass, concrete and clay. The Russians developed a mine with a pressed-cardboard casing, the PMK40, and the Italians made an anti-tank mine out of bakelite. In 1944, the Germans created the Topfmine, an entirely non-metallic mine. They ensured that they could detect their own mines by covering them with radioactive sand; the Allies did not find this out until after the war.\nSeveral mechanical methods for clearing mines were tried. Heavy rollers were attached to tanks or cargo trucks, but they did not last long and their weight made the tanks considerably slower. Tanks and bulldozers pushed ploughs that pushed aside any mines to a depth of . The Bangalore torpedo, a long thin tube filled with explosives, was invented in 1912 and used to clear barbed wire; larger versions such as the Snake and the Conger were developed for clearing mines, but were not very effective. One of the best options was the flail, which had weights attached by chains to rotating drums. The first version, the Scorpion, was attached to the Matilda tank and used in the Second Battle of El Alamein. The Crab, attached to the Sherman tank, was faster, at ; it was used during D-Day and the aftermath.\nCold War.\nDuring the Cold War, the members of NATO were concerned about massive armored attacks by the Soviet Union. They planned for a minefield stretching across the entire West German border, and developed new types of mines. The British designed an anti-tank mine, the Mark 7, to defeat rollers by detonating the second time it was pressed. It also had a 0.7-second delay so the tank would be directly over the mine. They also developed the first scatterable mine, the No. 7 Dingbat. The Americans used the M6 anti-tank mine and tripwire-operated bounding anti-personnel mines such as the M2 and M16.\nIn the Korean War, land mine use was dictated by the steep terrain, narrow valleys, forest cover and lack of developed roads. This made tanks less effective and more easily stopped by mines. However, mines laid near roads were often easy to spot. In response to this problem, the US developed the M24, a mine that was placed off to the side of the road. When triggered by a tripwire, it fired a rocket. However, the mine was not available until after the war.\nThe Chinese had success with massed infantry attacks. The extensive forest cover limited the range of machine guns, but anti-personnel mines were effective. However, mines were poorly recorded and marked, often becoming as much a hazard to allies as enemies. Tripwire-operated mines were not defended by pressure mines; the Chinese were often able to disable them and reuse them against UN forces.\nLooking for more destructive mines, the Americans developed the Claymore, a directional fragmentation mine that hurls steel balls in a 60-degree arc at a speed of . They also developed a pressure-operated mine, the M14 \"toe-popper\". These, too, were ready too late for the Korean War.\nIn 1948, the British developed the No. 6 anti-personnel mine, a minimum-metal mine with a narrow diameter, making it difficult to detect with metal detectors or prodding. Its three-pronged pressure piece inspired the nickname \"carrot mine\". However, it was unreliable in wet conditions. In the 1960s the Canadians developed a similar, but more reliable mine, the C3A1 \"Elsie\" and the British army adopted it. The British also developed the L9 bar mine, a wide anti-tank mine with a rectangular shape, which covered more area, allowing a minefield to be laid four times as fast as previous mines. They also upgraded the Dingbat to the Ranger, a plastic mine that was fired from a truck-mounted discharger that could fire 72 mines at a time.\nIn the 1950s, the US Operation Doan Brook studied the feasibility of delivering mines by air. This led to three types of air-delivered mine. \"Wide Area Anti-Personnel Mines\" (WAAPMs) were small steel spheres that discharged tripwires when they hit the ground; each dispenser held 540 mines. The BLU-43 Dragontooth was small and had a flattened \"W\" shape to slow its descent, while the gravel mine was larger. Both were packed by the thousand into bombs. All three were designed to inactivate after a period of time, but any that failed to activate presented a safety challenge. Over 37 million gravel mines were produced between 1967 and 1968, and when they were dropped in places like Vietnam their locations were unmarked and unrecorded. A similar problem was presented by unexploded cluster munitions.\nThe next generation of scatterable mines arose in response to the increasing mobility of war. The Germans developed the Skorpion system, which scattered AT2 mines from a tracked vehicle. The Italians developed a helicopter delivery system that could rapidly switch between SB-33 anti-personnel mines and SB-81 anti-tank mines. The US developed a range of systems called the Family of Scatterable Mines (FASCAM) that could deliver mines by fast jet, artillery, helicopter and ground launcher.\nMiddle eastern conflicts.\nThe Iraq-Iran War, the Gulf War, and the Islamic State have all contributed to land mine saturation in Iraq from the 1980s through 2020. In 2019, Iraq was the most saturated country in the world with land mines. Countries that provided land mines during the Iran-Iraq War included Belgium, Canada, Chile, China, Egypt, France, Italy, Romania, Singapore, the former Soviet Union and the US, and were concentrated in the Kurdish areas in the northern area of Iraq. During the Gulf War, the US deployed 117,634 mines, with 27,967 being anti-personnel mines and 89,667 being anti-vehicle mines. The US did not use land mines during the Iraq War.\nLandmines and other unexploded battlefield ordnance contaminate at least of land in Afghanistan. Only two of Afghanistan's twenty-nine provinces are believed to be free of landmines. The most heavily mined provinces are Herat and Kandahar. Since 1989, nearly 44,000 Afghan civilians have been recorded to have been killed or injured by landmines and explosive remnants of war (ERW) averaging to around 110 people per month. Improvised mines and ERW from armed clashes caused nearly 99 percent of the casualties recorded in 2021.\nInvasion of Ukraine.\nDuring the 2022 Russian Invasion of Ukraine, both Russian and Ukrainian forces have used land mines. Ukrainian officials claim Russian forces planted thousands of land mines or other explosive devices during their withdrawal from Ukrainian cities, including in civilian areas. Russian forces have also used remotely delivered anti-personnel mines such as the POM-3.\nChemical and nuclear.\nIn the First World War, the Germans developed a device, nicknamed the \"Yperite Mine\" by the British, that they left behind in abandoned trenches and bunkers. It was detonated by a delayed charge, spreading mustard gas (\"Yperite\"). In the Second World War they developed a modern chemical mine, the Spr\u00fch-B\u00fcchse 37 (Bounding Gas Mine 37), but never used it. The United States developed the M1 chemical mine, which used mustard gas, in 1939; and the M23 chemical mine, which used the VX nerve agent, in 1960. The Soviets developed the KhF, a \"bounding chemical mine\". The French had chemical mines and the Iraqis were believed to have them before the invasion of Kuwait. In 1997, the Chemical Weapons Convention came into force, prohibiting the use of chemical weapons and mandating their destruction. By July 2023 all declared stockpiles of chemical weapons were destroyed.\nFor a few decades during the Cold War, the US developed atomic demolition munitions, often referred to as nuclear land mines. These were portable nuclear bombs that could be placed by hand, and could be detonated remotely or with a timer. Some of these were deployed in Europe. Governments in West Germany, Turkey and Greece wanted to have nuclear minefields as a defense against attack from the Warsaw Pact. However, such weapons were politically and tactically infeasible, and by 1989 the last of these munitions was retired. The British also had a project, codenamed Blue Peacock, to develop nuclear mines to be buried in Germany; the project was cancelled in 1958.\nCharacteristics and function.\nA conventional land mine consists of a casing that is mostly filled with the main charge. It has a firing mechanism such as a pressure plate; this triggers a detonator or igniter, which in turn sets off a booster charge. There may be additional firing mechanisms in anti-handling devices.\nFiring mechanisms and initiating actions.\nA land mine can be triggered by a number of things including pressure, movement, sound, magnetism and vibration. Anti-personnel mines commonly use the pressure of a person's foot as a trigger, but tripwires are also frequently employed. Because modern anti-vehicle mines usually employ magnetic triggers, they can detonate even if the victim's tires or tracks do not directly impact it. Advanced mines are able to sense the difference between friendly and enemy types of vehicles by way of a built-in signature catalog (an identification friend or foe system). This theoretically enables friendly forces to use the mined area while denying the enemy access.\nMany mines combine the main trigger with a touch or tilt trigger to prevent enemy engineers from defusing the mine. Land mine designs tend to use as little metal as possible to make searching with a metal detector more difficult; land mines made mostly of plastic have the added advantage of being very inexpensive.\nSome types of modern mines are designed to self-destruct, or chemically render themselves inert after a period of weeks or months to reduce the likelihood of civilian casualties at the conflict's end. These self-destruct mechanisms are not absolutely reliable, and most land mines laid historically are not equipped in this manner. There is a common myth that mines will become inert and harmless after a few years in the ground, but in fact they can remain dangerous for many decades.\nThere is a common misconception that a landmine is armed by stepping on it and only triggered by stepping off. In all cases the initial pressure trigger detonates the mine, since mines are designed to kill or maim the victims rather than having them standing still until the mine can be disarmed. This misperception originated with the fictional portrayal of mines, often in movies in which the disarming of a mine is a source of narrative tension.\nAnti-handling devices.\nAnti-handling devices detonate the mine if someone attempts to lift, shift or disarm it. The intention is to hinder deminers by discouraging any attempts to clear minefields. There is a degree of overlap between the function of a boobytrap and an anti-handling device insofar as some mines have optional fuze pockets into which standard pull or pressure-release boobytrap firing devices can be screwed. Alternatively, some mines may mimic a standard design, but actually be specifically intended to kill deminers, such as the MC-3 and PMN-3 variants of the PMN mine. Anti-handling devices can be found on both anti-personnel mines and anti-tank mines, either as an integral part of their design or as improvised add-ons. For this reason, the standard render safe procedure for mines is often to destroy them on site without attempting to lift them.\nSmart mines.\n\"Smart mines\" use a number of advanced technologies developed in the late 20th and early 21st century. Most commonly, this includes mechanisms to deactivate or self-destruct the mine after a preset period of time. This is intended to reduce civilian casualties and simplify demining.\nOther innovations include \"self-healing\" minefields, which detect gaps in the field and can direct the mines to rearrange their positions, eliminating the gaps.\nAnti-tank mines.\nAnti-tank mines were created in response to the invention of the tank in the First World War. Though improvised at first, purpose-built designs were soon developed. Set off when a tank passes, they attack the tank at one of its weaker areas \u2013 the tracks. They are designed to immobilize or destroy vehicles and their occupants. In US military terminology destroying the vehicles is referred to as a catastrophic kill while only disabling its movement is referred to as a mobility kill.\nAnti-tank mines are typically larger than anti-personnel mines and require more pressure to detonate. The high trigger pressure, normally requiring prevents them from being set off by infantry or smaller vehicles of lesser importance. More modern anti-tank mines use shaped charges to focus and increase the armor penetration of the explosives.\nAnti-personnel mines.\nAnti-personnel mines are designed primarily to kill or injure people, as opposed to vehicles. They are often designed to injure rather than kill to increase the logistical support (evacuation, medical) burden on the opposing force. Some types of anti-personnel mines can also damage the tracks or wheels of armored vehicles.\nIn the asymmetric warfare conflicts and civil wars of the 21st century, improvised explosives, known as IEDs, have partially supplanted conventional land mines as the source of injury to dismounted (pedestrian) soldiers and civilians. IEDs are used mainly by insurgents and terrorists against regular armed forces and civilians. The injuries from the anti-personnel IED were recently reported in BMJ Open to be far worse than with landmines resulting in multiple limb amputations and lower body mutilation.\nWarfare.\nLand mines were designed for two main uses:\nLand mines are currently used in large quantities mostly for this first purpose, thus their widespread use in the demilitarized zones (DMZs) of likely flashpoints such as Cyprus, Afghanistan and Korea. Syria has used land mines in its civil war. Since 2021, land mine use has risen in Myanmar during its internal conflict. As of 2023, both Russia and Ukraine have deployed land mines.\nIn military science, minefields are considered a defensive or harassing weapon, used to slow the enemy down, to deny certain terrain to the enemy, to focus enemy movement into kill zones, or to reduce morale by randomly attacking materiel and personnel. In some engagements during World War II, anti-tank mines accounted for half of all vehicles disabled.\nSince combat engineers with mine-clearing equipment can clear a path through a minefield relatively quickly, mines are usually considered effective only if covered by fire.\nThe extents of minefields are often marked with warning signs and cloth tape, to prevent friendly troops and non-combatants from entering them. Of course, sometimes terrain can be denied using dummy minefields. Most forces carefully record the location and disposition of their own minefields, because warning signs can be destroyed or removed, and minefields should eventually be cleared. Minefields may also have marked or unmarked safe routes to allow friendly movement through them.\nPlacing minefields without marking and recording them for later removal is considered a war crime under Protocol II of the Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons, which is itself an annex to the Geneva Conventions.\nArtillery and aircraft-scatterable mines allow minefields to be placed in front of moving formations of enemy units, including the reinforcement of minefields or other obstacles that have been breached by enemy engineers. They can also be used to cover the retreat of forces disengaging from the enemy, or for interdiction of supporting units to isolate front line units from resupply. In most cases these minefields consist of a combination of anti-tank and anti-personnel mines, with the anti-personnel mines making removal of the anti-tank mines more difficult. Mines of this type used by the United States are designed to self-destruct after a preset period of time, reducing the requirement for mine clearing to only those mines whose self-destruct system did not function. Some designs of these scatterable mines require an electrical charge (capacitor or battery) to detonate. After a certain period of time, either the charge dissipates, leaving them effectively inert or the circuitry is designed such that upon reaching a low level, the device is triggered, destroying the mine.\nGuerrilla warfare.\nNone of the conventional tactics and norms of mine warfare applies when they are employed in a guerrilla role:\nLand mines were commonly deployed by insurgents during the South African Border War, leading directly to the development of the first dedicated mine-protected armoured vehicles in South Africa. Namibian insurgents used anti-tank mines to throw South African military convoys into disarray before attacking them. To discourage detection and removal efforts, they also laid anti-personnel mines directly parallel to the anti-tank mines. This initially resulted in heavy South African military and police casualties, as the vast distances of road network vulnerable to insurgent sappers every day made comprehensive detection and clearance efforts impractical. The only other viable option was the adoption of mine-protected vehicles which could remain mobile on the roads with little risk to their passengers even if a mine was detonated. South Africa is widely credited with inventing the v-hull, a vee-shaped hull for armoured vehicles which deflects mine blasts away from the passenger compartment.\nDuring the Syrian Civil War (2011-2025), Iraqi Civil War (2014\u20132017) and Yemeni Civil War (2015\u2013present) land mines have been used for both defensive and guerrilla purposes.\nLaying mines.\nMinefields may be laid by several means. The preferred, but most labour-intensive, way is to have engineers bury the mines, since this will make the mines practically invisible and reduce the number of mines needed to deny the enemy an area. Mines can be laid by specialized mine-laying vehicles. Mine-scattering shells may be fired by artillery from a distance of several tens of kilometers.\nMines may be dropped from helicopters or airplanes, or ejected from cluster bombs or cruise missiles.\nAnti-tank minefields can be scattered with anti-personnel mines to make clearing them manually more time-consuming; and anti-personnel minefields are scattered with anti-tank mines to prevent the use of armored vehicles to clear them quickly. Some anti-tank mine types are also able to be triggered by infantry, giving them a dual purpose even though their main and official intention is to work as anti-tank weapons.\nSome minefields are specifically booby-trapped to make clearing them more dangerous. Mixed anti-personnel and anti-tank minefields, anti-personnel mines \"under\" anti-tank mines, and fuses separated from mines have all been used for this purpose. Often, single mines are backed by a secondary device, designed to kill or maim personnel tasked with clearing the mine.\nMultiple anti-tank mines have been buried in stacks of two or three with the bottom mine fuzed, to multiply the penetrating power. Since the mines are buried, the ground directs the energy of the blast in a single direction\u2014through the bottom of the target vehicle or on the track.\nAnother specific use is to mine an aircraft runway immediately after it has been bombed to delay or discourage repair. Some cluster bombs combine these functions. One example was the British JP233 cluster bomb which includes munitions to damage (crater) the runway as well as anti-personnel mines in the same cluster bomb. As a result of the anti-personnel mine ban it was withdrawn from British Royal Air Force service, and the last stockpiles of the mine were destroyed on October 19, 1999.\nDemining.\nMetal detectors were first used for demining, after their invention by the Polish officer J\u00f3zef Kosacki. His invention, known as the Polish mine detector, was used by the Allies alongside mechanical methods, to clear the German mine fields during the Second Battle of El Alamein when 500 units were shipped to Field Marshal Montgomery's Eighth Army.\nThe Nazis used captured civilians who were chased across minefields to detonate the explosives. According to Laurence Rees \"Curt von Gottberg, the SS-Obergruppenf\u00fchrer who, during 1943, conducted another huge anti-partisan action called Operation Kottbus on the eastern border of Belarus, reported that 'approximately two to three thousand local people were blown up in the clearing of the minefields'.\"\nWhereas the placing and arming of mines is relatively inexpensive and simple, the process of detecting and removing them is typically expensive, slow, and dangerous. This is especially true of irregular warfare where mines were used on an ad hoc basis in unmarked and undocumented areas. Anti-personnel mines are most difficult to find, due to their small size and many being made almost entirely of non-metallic materials specifically to evade metal detectors.\nManual clearing remains the most effective technique for clearing mine fields, although hybrid techniques involving the use of animals and robots are being developed. Many animals are desirable due to having a strong sense of smell capable of detecting a land mine. Animals such as rats and dogs can be trained to detect the explosive agent.\nOther techniques involve the use of geolocation technologies. As of 2008[ [update]] a joint team of researchers at the University of New South Wales and Ohio State University was working to develop a system based on multi-sensor integration. Furthermore, defence firms have been increasingly competing on the creation of unmanned demining systems. In addition to conventional remote control mine defusing robots that operate either through precise mechanical dismantling, electronic destabilization and kinetic triggering methods, fully autonomous methods are in development. Notably, these autonomous methods use unmanned ground systems, or more recently subterranean systems such as the EMC Operations Termite, using either outward pressure differentials along system bodies, or corkscrew mechanisms.\nThe laying of land mines has inadvertently led to a positive development in the Falkland Islands. Minefields laid near the sea during the Falklands War have become favorite places for penguins, which do not weigh enough to detonate the mines. Therefore, they can breed safely, free of human intrusion. These odd sanctuaries have proven so popular and lucrative for ecotourism that efforts existed to prevent removal of the mines, but the area has since been demined.\nInternational treaties.\nThe use of land mines is controversial because they are indiscriminate weapons, harming soldier and civilian alike. They remain dangerous after the conflict in which they were deployed has ended, killing and injuring civilians and rendering land impassable and unusable for decades. To make matters worse, many factions have not kept accurate records (or any at all) of the exact locations of their minefields, making removal efforts painstakingly slow. These facts pose serious difficulties in many developing nations where the presence of mines hampers resettlement, agriculture, and tourism. The International Campaign to Ban Landmines campaigned successfully to prohibit their use, culminating in the 1997 Convention on the Prohibition of the Use, Stockpiling, Production and Transfer of Anti-Personnel Mines and on their Destruction, known informally as the Ottawa Treaty.\nThe Treaty came into force on March 1, 1999. The treaty was the result of the leadership of the Governments of Canada, Norway, South Africa and Mozambique working with the \"International Campaign to Ban Landmines\", launched in 1992. The campaign and its leader, Jody Williams, won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1997 for its efforts.\nThe treaty does not include anti-tank mines, cluster bombs or Claymore-type mines operated in command mode and focuses specifically on anti-personnel mines, because these pose the greatest long term (post-conflict) risk to humans and animals since they are typically designed to be triggered by any movement or pressure of only a few kilograms, whereas anti-tank mines require much more weight (or a combination of factors that would exclude humans). Existing stocks must be destroyed within four years of signing the treaty.\nSignatories of the Ottawa Treaty agree that they will not use, produce, stockpile or trade in anti-personnel land mines. In 1997, there were 122 signatories; as of early 2016, 162 countries have joined the Treaty. Thirty-six countries, including the People's Republic of China, the Russian Federation and the United States, which together may hold tens of millions of stockpiled anti-personnel mines, are not party to the Convention. Another 34 have yet to sign on. The United States did not sign because the treaty lacks an exception for the Korean Demilitarized Zone.\nArticle 3 of the Treaty permits countries to retain land mines for use in training or development of countermeasures. Sixty-four countries have taken this option.\nAs an alternative to an outright ban, 10 countries follow regulations that are contained in a 1996 amendment of Protocol II of the Convention on Conventional Weapons (CCW). The countries are China, Finland, India, Israel, Morocco, Pakistan, South Korea and the United States. Sri Lanka, which had adhered to this regulation, announced in 2016 that it would join the Ottawa Treaty.\nSubmunitions and unexploded ordnance from cluster munitions can also function as land mines, in that they continue to kill and maim indiscriminately long after conflicts have ended. The Convention on Cluster Munitions (CCM) is an international treaty that prohibits the use, distribution, or manufacture of cluster munitions. The CCM entered into force in 2010, and has been ratified by over 100 countries.\nManufacturers.\nBefore the Ottawa Treaty was adopted, the Arms Project of Human Rights Watch identified \"almost 100 companies and government agencies in 48 countries\" that had manufactured \"more than 340 types of anti-personnel land mines in recent decades\". Five to ten million mines were produced per year with a value of $50 to $200\u00a0million. The largest producers were probably China, Italy and the Soviet Union. The companies involved included giants such as Daimler-Benz, the Fiat Group, the Daewoo Group, RCA and General Electric.\nAs of 2017, the \"Landmine &amp; Cluster Munition Monitor\" identified four countries that were \"likely to be actively producing\" land mines: India, Myanmar, Pakistan and South Korea. Another seven states reserved the right to make them but were probably not doing so: China, Cuba, Iran, North Korea, Russia, Singapore, and Vietnam.\nIn recent years, arms industry manufacturers have been using non-static mines that can be specifically targeted in order to remove the imprecision of anti-personnel devices, promoting the use of movable underground systems, movable above ground systems and systems that can be expired (automatically or manually via strategic operators.)\nDevelopment of systems such as Termite, by arms firm EMC Operations has led to criticism from proponents of past multilateral agreements against the placement of land mines and submunitions due to expectations of similar long-dormancy period issues after systems break or fail after it was announced that vehicles would likely be armed to destroy static targets, rather than focus purely on demining efforts.\nImpacts.\nThroughout the world there are millions of hectares that are contaminated with land mines.\nCasualties.\nFrom 1999 to 2017, the \"Landmine Monitor\" has recorded over 120,000 casualties from mines, IEDs and ERW; it estimates that another 1,000 per year go unrecorded. The estimate for all time is over half a million. In 2017, at least 2,793 were killed and 4,431 injured. 87% of the casualties were civilians and 47% were children (less than 18 years old). The largest numbers of casualties were in Afghanistan (2,300), Syria (1,906), and Ukraine (429).\nEnvironmental.\nNatural disasters can have a significant impact on efforts to demine areas of land. For example, the floods that occurred in Mozambique in 1999 and 2000 may have displaced hundreds of thousands of land mines left from the war. Uncertainty about their locations delayed recovery efforts.\nLand degradation.\nFrom a study by Asmeret Asefaw Berhe, land degradation caused by land mines \"can be classified into five groups: access denial, loss of biodiversity, micro-relief disruption, chemical composition, and loss of productivity\". The effects of an explosion depend on: \"(i) the objectives and methodological approaches of the investigation; (ii) concentration of mines in a unit area; (iii) chemical composition and toxicity of the mines; (iv) previous uses of the land and (v) alternatives that are available for the affected populations\".\nAccess denial.\nThe most prominent ecological issue associated with land mines (or fear of them) is denial of access to vital resources (where \"access\" refers to the ability to use resources, in contrast to \"property\", the right to use them). The presence and fear of presence of even a single land mine can discourage access for agriculture, water supplies and possibly conservation measures. Reconstruction and development of important structures such as schools and hospitals are likely to be delayed, and populations may shift to urban areas, increasing overcrowding and the risk of spreading diseases.\nAccess denial can have positive effects on the environment. When a mined area becomes a \"no-man's land\", plants and vegetation have a chance to grow and recover. For example, formerly arable lands in Nicaragua returned to forests and remained undisturbed after the establishment of land mines. Similarly, the penguins of the Falkland Islands have benefited because they are not heavy enough to trigger the mines present. However, these benefits can only last as long as animals, tree limbs, etc. do not detonate the mines. In addition, long idle periods could \"potentially end up creating or exacerbating loss of productivity\", particularly within land of low quality.\nLoss of biodiversity.\nLand mines can threaten biodiversity by wiping out vegetation and wildlife during explosions or demining. This extra burden can push threatened and endangered species to extinction. They have also been used by poachers to target endangered species. Displaced refugees hunt animals for food and destroy habitat by making shelters.\nShrapnel, or abrasions of bark or roots caused by detonated mines, can cause the slow death of trees and provide entry sites for wood-rotting fungi. When land mines make land unavailable for farming, residents resort to the forests to meet all of their survival needs. This exploitation furthers the loss of biodiversity.\nChemical contamination.\nNear mines that have exploded or decayed, soils tend to be contaminated, particularly with heavy metals. Products produced from the explosives, both organic and inorganic substances, are most likely to be \"long lasting, water-soluble and toxic even in small amounts\". They can be implemented either \"directly or indirectly into soil, water bodies, microorganisms and plants with drinking water, food products or during respiration\".\nToxic compounds can also find their way into bodies of water and accumulate in land animals, fish and plants. They can act \"as a nerve poison to hamper growth\", with deadly effect.\nEconomic.\nA 2025 study in \"Econometrica,\" which examined landmine removal in Mozambique, found substantial economic benefits from landmine removal, in particular in areas where the mines affected roads and railroads.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Col-begin/styles.css\"/&gt;\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "18175", "revid": "13286072", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18175", "title": "Lwa", "text": "Haitian Vodou spirits\n, also called loa, are spirits in the African diasporic religion of Haitian Vodou and Dominican Vud\u00fa. They have also been incorporated into some revivalist forms of Louisiana Voodoo. Many of the lwa derive their identities in part from deities venerated in the traditional religions of West Africa, especially those of the Fon and Yoruba.\nIn Haitian Vodou, the lwa serve as intermediaries between humanity and Bondye, a transcendent creator divinity. Vodouists believe that over a thousand lwa exist, the names of at least 232 of which are recorded. Each lwa has its own personality and is associated with specific colors and objects. Many of them are equated with specific Roman Catholic saints on the basis of similar characteristics or shared symbols. The lwa are divided into different groups, known as \"nanchon\" (nations), the most notable of which are the Petwo and the Rada. According to Vodou belief, the lwa communicate with humans through dreams and divination, and in turn are given offerings, including sacrificed animals. Vodou teaches that during ceremonies, the lwa possess specific practitioners, who during the possession are considered the \"chwal\" (horse) of the lwa. Through possessing an individual, Vodouists believe, the lwa can communicate with other humans, offering advice, admonishment, or healing. \nDuring the Atlantic slave trade of the 16th to 19th centuries, enslaved West Africans brought their traditional religions with them. In the French colony of Saint-Domingue, which became the republic of Haiti in the early 19th century, the diasporic religion of Vodou emerged amid the mixing of different West African traditional religions and the influence of the French colonists' Roman Catholicism. From at least the 19th century, Haitian migrants took their religion to Louisiana, by that point part of the United States, where they contributed to the formation of Louisiana Voodoo, a religion that largely died out in the early 20th century. In the latter part of that century, Voodoo revivalist groups emerged in Louisiana, often incorporating both the lwa spirits of Haitian Vodou and the oricha spirits of Cuban Santer\u00eda into their practices.\nEtymology.\nModern linguists trace the etymology of \"lwa\" to a family of Yoruba language words which include \"\" (god) and \"babalawo\" (diviner or priest).\nThe term \"lwa\" is phonetically identical to both a French term for law, \"loi\", and a Haitian Creole term for law, \"lwa\". The early 20th-century writer Jean Price-Mars pondered if the term \"lwa\", used in reference to Vodou spirits, emerged from their popular identification with the laws of the Roman Catholic Church. In the early 21st century, the historian Kate Ramsey agreed that the phonetic similarity between the terms for the law and the Vodou spirits may not be \"mere linguistic coincidence\" but could reflect the complex interactions of African and French colonial cultures in Haiti.\nSeveral spelling for \"lwa\" have been used. Early 20th-century writers on Haitian religion, such as Price-Mars, usually spelled the term \"loi\". During that century, writers like the American anthropologist Melville Herskovits favored the spelling \"loa\", although in 2008 the historian Jeffrey E. Anderson wrote that the spelling \"loa\" was typically found in older works on the topic, having fallen out of favor with scholarly writers. The spelling \"lwa\" has been favored by more recent scholarly writers including Anderson, Ramsey, the anthropologist Karen McCarthy Brown, the scholar of religious studies Leslie Desmangles, and the Hispanic studies scholars Margarite Fern\u00e1ndez Olmos and Lizabeth Paravisini-Gebert.\nTheology.\nVodou teaches that there are over a thousand lwa. They are regarded as the intermediaries of Bondy\u00e9, the supreme creator deity in Vodou. Desmangles argued that by learning about the various lwas, practitioners come to understand the different facets of Bondy\u00e9. Much as Vodouists often identify Bondy\u00e9 with the Christian God, the lwa are sometimes equated with the angels of Christian cosmology. The lwa are also known as the \"myst\u00e8res\", \"anges\", \"saints\", and \"les invisibles\".\nThe lwa can offer help, protection, and counsel to humans, in return for ritual service. They are thought of as having wisdom that is useful for humans, although they are not seen as moral exemplars which practitioners should imitate. Each lwa has its own personality, and is associated with specific colors, days of the week, and objects. The lwa can be either loyal or capricious in their dealings with their devotees; Vodouists believe that the lwa are easily offended, for instance if offered food that they dislike. When angered, the lwa are believed to remove their protection from their devotees, or to inflict misfortune, illness, or madness on an individual.\nAlthough there are exceptions, most lwa names derive from the Fon and Yoruba languages. New lwa are nevertheless added to those brought from Africa; practitioners believe that some Vodou priests and priestesses became lwa after death, or that certain talismans become lwa. Vodouists often refer to the lwa residing in \"Guinea\", but this is not intended as a precise geographical location. Many lwa are also understood to live under the water, at the bottom of the sea or in rivers. Vodouists believe that the lwa communicate with humans through dreams and through the possession of human beings.\nDuring rituals, the lwa are summoned through designs known as \"veve\". These are sketched out on the floor of the ceremonial space using cornmeal, ash, coffee grounds, or powdered eggshells.\nThe lwa are associated with specific Roman Catholic saints. For instance, Azaka, the lwa of agriculture, is associated with Saint Isidore the farmer. Similarly, because he is understood as the \"key\" to the spirit world, Papa Legba is typically associated with Saint Peter, who is visually depicted holding keys in traditional Roman Catholic imagery. The lwa of love and luxury, Ezili Freda, is associated with Mater Dolorosa. Damballa, who is a serpent, is often equated with Saint Patrick, who is traditionally depicted in a scene with snakes; alternatively he is often associated with Moses. The Marasa, or sacred twins, are typically equated with the twin saints Cosmos and Damian.\nNanchon.\nIn Haitian Vodou, the lwa are divided into \"nanchon\" or \"nations\". This classificatory system derives from the way in which enslaved West Africans were divided into \"nations\" upon their arrival in Haiti, usually based on their African port of departure rather than their ethno-cultural identity. The nanchons are nevertheless not groupings based in the geographical origins of specific lwas. The term \"fanmi\" (family) is sometimes used synonymously with \"nation\" or alternatively as a sub-division of the latter category. It is often claimed that there are 17 nanchon, although few Haitians could name all of them. Each is deemed to have its own characteristic ethos.\nAmong the more commonly known nanchon are the Wangol, Ginen, Kongo, Nago (or Anago), Ibo, Rada, and Petwo. Of these, the Rada and the Petwo are the largest and most dominant. The Rada derive their name from Arada, a city in the Dahomey kingdom of West Africa. The Rada lwa are usually regarded as \"dous\" or \"doux\", meaning that they are sweet-tempered. The Petwo lwa are conversely seen as \"lwa chaud\" (\"lwa cho\"), indicating that they can be forceful or violent and are associated with fire; they are generally regarded as being socially transgressive and subversive. The Rada lwa are seen as being 'cool'; the Petwo lwa as 'hot'.\nThe Rada lwa are generally regarded as righteous, whereas their Petwo counterparts are thought of as being more morally ambiguous, associated with issues like money. At the same time, the Rada lwa are regarded as being less effective or powerful than those of the Petwo nation. The Petwo lwa derive from various backgrounds, including Creole, Kongo, and Dahomeyan. \nIn various cases, certain lwa can be absorbed from one nanchon into another; various Kongo and Ibo lwa have been incorporated into the Petwo nanchon. Many lwa exist \"andezo\" or \"en deux eaux\", meaning that they are \"in two waters\" and are served in both Rada and Petwo rituals. Various lwas are understood to have direct counterparts in different nanchon; several Rada lwas for instance have Petwo counterparts whose names bear epithets like \"Flangbo\" (afire), \"Je-Rouge\" (Red-Eye), or \"Zarenyen\" (spider). One example is the Rada lwa Ezili, who is associated with love, but who has a Petwo parallel known as Ezili Je-Rouge, who is regarded as dangerous and prone to causing harm. Another is the Rada lwa Legba, who directs human destiny, and who is paralleled in the Petwo pantheon by Kafou Legba, a trickster who causes accidents that alter a person's destiny.\nThe Gede (also \"Ghede\" or \"Guede\") family of lwa are associated with the realm of the dead. The head of the family is Baron Samedi (\"Baron Saturday\"). His consort is Grand Brigitte; she has authority over cemeteries and is regarded as the mother of many of the other Gede. When the Gede are believed to have arrived at a Vodou ceremony they are usually greeted with joy because they bring merriment. Those possessed by the Gede at these ceremonies are known for making sexual innuendos; the Gede's symbol is an erect penis, while the \"banda\" dance associated with them involves sexual-style thrusting.\nRitual.\nOfferings and animal sacrifice.\nFeeding the lwa is of great importance in Vodou, with rites often termed \"mangers-lwa\" (\"feeding the lwa\"). Offering food and drink to the lwa is the most common ritual within the religion, conducted both communally and in the home. An \"oungan\" (priest) or \"manbo\" (priestess) will also organize an annual feast for their congregation in which animal sacrifices to various lwa will be made. The choice of food and drink offered varies depending on the lwa in question, with different lwa believed to favour different foodstuffs. Damballa for instance requires white foods, especially eggs. Foods offered to Legba, whether meat, tubers, or vegetables, need to be grilled on a fire. The lwa of the Ogu and Nago nations prefer raw rum or clairin as an offering.\nA \"mange s\u00e8c\" (dry meal) is an offering of grains, fruit, and vegetables that often precedes a simple ceremony; it takes its name from the absence of blood. Species used for sacrifice include chickens, goats, and bulls, with pigs often favored for petwo lwa. The animal may be washed, dressed in the color of the specific lwa, and marked with food or water. Often, the animal's throat will be cut and the blood collected in a calabash. Chickens are often killed by the pulling off of their heads; their limbs may be broken beforehand. The organs are removed and placed on the altar or v\u00e8v\u00e8. The flesh will be cooked and placed on the altar, subsequently often being buried.\nMaya Deren wrote that: \"The intent and emphasis of sacrifice is not upon the death of the animal, it is upon the transfusion of its life to the lwa; for the understanding is that flesh and blood are of the essence of life and vigor, and these will restore the divine energy of the god.\" Because Agw\u00e9 is believed to reside in the sea, rituals devoted to him often take place beside a large body of water such as a lake, river, or sea. His devotees sometimes sail out to Trois Ilets, drumming and singing, where they throw a white sheep overboard as a sacrifice to him.\nThe food is typically offered when it is cool; it remains there for a while before humans can then eat it. The food is often placed within a \"kwi\", a calabash shell bowl. Once selected, the food is placed on special calabashes known as \"assiettes de Guin\u00e9e\" which are located on the altar. Offerings not consumed by the celebrants are then often buried or left at a crossroads. Libations might be poured into the ground. Vodouists believe that the lwa then consume the essence of the food. Certain foods are also offered in the belief that they are intrinsically virtuous, such as grilled maize, peanuts, and cassava. These are sometimes sprinkled over animals that are about to be sacrificed or piled upon the \"v\u00e8v\u00e8\" designs on the floor of the \"peristil\".\nPossession.\nPossession by the lwa constitutes an important element of Vodou. It lies the heart of many of its rituals; these typically take place in a temple called an \"ounf\u00f2\", specifically in a room termed the \"peristil\" or \"peristyle\". \nThe person being possessed is referred to as the \"chwal\" or \"chual\" (horse); the act of possession is called \"mounting a horse\". Vodou teaches that a lwa can possess an individual regardless of gender; both male and female lwa can possess either men or women. Although children are often present at these ceremonies, they are rarely possessed as it is considered too dangerous. While the specific drums and songs used are designed to encourage a specific lwa to possess someone, sometimes an unexpected lwa appears and takes possession instead. In some instances a succession of lwa possess the same individual, one after the other.\nThe trance of possession is known as the \"crise de lwa\". Vodouists believe that during this process, the lwa enters the head of the chwal and displaces their \"gwo bon anj\", which is one of the two halves of a person's soul. This displacement is believed to cause the chwal to tremble and convulse; Maya Deren described a look of \"anguish, ordeal and blind terror\" on the faces of those as they became possessed. Because their consciousness has been removed from their head during the possession, Vodouists believe that the chwal will have no memory of what occurs during the incident. The length of the possession varies, often lasting a few hours but sometimes several days. It may end with the chwal collapsing in a semi-conscious state; they are typically left physically exhausted. Some individuals attending the dance will put a certain item, often wax, in their hair or headgear to prevent possession.\nOnce the lwa possesses an individual, the congregation greet it with a burst of song and dance. The chwal will typically bow before the officiating priest or priestess and prostrate before the \"poto mitan\", a central pillar within the temple. The chwal is often escorted into an adjacent room where they are dressed in clothing associated with the possessing lwa. Alternatively, the clothes are brought out and they are dressed in the peristil itself. Once the chwal has been dressed, congregants kiss the floor before them. These costumes and props help the chwal take on the appearance of the lwa. Many ounfo have a large wooden phallus on hand which is used by those possessed by Ghede lwa during their dances.\nThe chwal takes on the behaviour and expressions of the possessing lwa; their performance can be very theatrical. Those believing themselves possessed by the serpent Damballa, for instance, often slither on the floor, dart out their tongue, and climb the posts of the peristil. Those possessed by Zaka, lwa of agriculture, will dress as a peasant in a straw hat with a clay pipe and will often speak in a rustic accent. The chwal will often then join in with the dances, dancing with anyone whom they wish to, or sometimes eating and drinking. Sometimes the lwa, through the chwal, will engage in financial transactions with members of the congregation, for instance by selling them food that has been given as an offering or lending them money.\nPossession facilitates direct communication between the lwa and its followers; through the chwal, the lwa communicates with their devotees, offering counsel, chastisement, blessings, warnings about the future, and healing. Lwa possession has a healing function, with the possessed individual expected to reveal possible cures to the ailments of those assembled. Clothing that the chwal touches is regarded as bringing luck. The lwa may also offer advice to the individual they are possessing; because the latter is not believed to retain any memory of the events, it is expected that other members of the congregation will pass along the lwa's message. In some instances, practitioners have reported being possessed at other times of ordinary life, such as when someone is in the middle of the market, or when they are asleep.\nHistory.\nDuring the closing decades of the 20th century, attempts were made to revive Louisiana Voodoo, often by individuals drawing heavily on Haitian Vodou and Cuban Santer\u00eda in doing so. Among those drawing on both Vodou lwa and Santer\u00eda oricha to create a new Voodoo was the African American Miriam Chamani, who established the Voodoo Spiritual Temple in the French Quarter of New Orleans in 1990. Another initiate of Haitian Vodou, the Ukrainian-Jewish American Sallie Ann Glassman, launched an alternative group, La Source Ancienne, in the city's Bywater neighborhood. A further Haitian Vodou initiate, the Louisiana Creole Ava Kay Jones, also began promoting a form of Louisiana Voodoo.\nList.\nVodouisants will sometimes comment that there are over a thousand lwas, most of whom are not known to humans. Of these, the names of at least 232 have been recorded. The large number of lwas found in Vodou contrasts with the Cuban religion of Santer\u00eda, where only 15 orichas (spirits) have gained prominence among its followers.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Broadly, it surveys labor markets and the ecomic decisions of agents participating in such markets. Topics of study include the labour supply of workers and how it is affected by variables such as age, education, gender and childbearing, as well as the labour demand by firms searching for different forms of labor as an input in the production of goods and services. In addition, labour economics studies, amognst others, phenomena such as schooling, human capital, inequality, unemployment, trade unions, discrimination, technological change, and public policies related to labor markets, such as unemployment benefits, pensions and health care.\nMacro and micro analysis of labour markets.\nLabour economics can generally be seen as the application of microeconomic or macroeconomic techniques to the labour market. A general assumption in the microeconomic study of labor markets is that workers \u2013 suppliers of labor \u2013 make rational choices based on the information that they know regarding wage, desire to provide labour, and desire for leisure, to maximise utility over their lifetime by consuming economic goods, services and leisure. Conversely, economic firms \u2013 demanders of labor \u2013 seek to maximise profits by hiring these laborers.\nThe labour force (LF) is defined as the number of people of working age, who are either employed or actively looking for work (unemployed). The \"labour force participation rate\" (LFPR) is the number of people in the labour force divided by the size of the adult civilian noninstitutional population (or by the population of working age that is not institutionalized), LFPR = LF/Population.\nThe non-labour force includes those who are not looking for work, those who are institutionalized (such as in prisons or psychiatric wards), stay-at-home spouses, children not of working age, and those serving in the military. The unemployment level is defined as the labour force minus the number of people currently employed. The unemployment rate is defined as the level of unemployment divided by the labour force. The employment rate is defined as the number of people currently employed divided by the adult population (or by the population of working age). In these statistics, self-employed people are counted as employed.\nThe labour market has the ability to create a higher derivative efficiency of labour, especially on a national and international level, compared to simpler forms of labour distribution, leading to a higher financial GDP growth and output. An efficient labour market is important for the private sector as it drives up derivative income through the reduction of relative costs of labour. This presupposes that division of labour is used as a method to attain cost efficiency.\nVariables like employment level, unemployment level, labour force, and unfilled vacancies are called stock variables because they measure a quantity at a point in time. They can be contrasted with flow variables which measure a quantity over a duration of time. Changes in the labour force are due to flow variables such as natural population growth, net immigration, new entrants, and retirements. Changes in unemployment depend on inflows (non-employed people starting to look for jobs and employed people who lose their jobs that are looking for new ones) and outflows (people who find new employment and people who stop looking for employment). When looking at the overall macroeconomy, several types of unemployment have been identified, which can be separated into two categories of natural and unnatural unemployment.\n\"Natural Unemployment\"\n\"Unnatural Unemployment\"\nAggregate expenditure (AE) can be increased by increasing consumption spending (C), investment spending (I), government spending (G), or increasing exports (X), since AE = C + I + G + X.\nNeoclassical microeconomics.\nNeoclassical economists view the labour market as similar to other markets in that the forces of supply and demand jointly determine the price (in this case the wage rate) and quantity (in this case the number of people employed).\nHowever, the labour market differs from other markets (like the markets for goods or the financial market) in several ways. In particular, the labour market may act as a non-clearing market. While according to neoclassical theory most markets quickly attain a point of equilibrium without excess supply or demand, this may not be true of the labour market: it may have a persistent level of unemployment. Contrasting the labour market to other markets also reveals persistent compensating differentials among similar workers.\nModels that assume perfect competition in the labour market, as discussed below, conclude that workers earn their marginal product of labour.\nNeoclassical supply.\nHouseholds are suppliers of labour. In microeconomic theory, people are assumed to be rational and seeking to maximize their utility function. In the labour market model, their utility function expresses trade-offs in preference between leisure time and income from time used for labour. However, they are constrained by the hours available to them.\nFormulas below will have to be updated as Major constraint: a problem with this is seven-day work week, made up usually of 5 work days and 2 off-days, built upon 8000 year old work-rest schedule, from the Sumerians. 5/2 schedule is asymmetrical, as labor supply and demand would considerably change as well as work participation; the new schedule is symmetrical, much more supply by women, and care-givers, willing workers constrained by having only three days availability. \nSymmetrical: two 3-day part-time people can take on one job . the 5/2 is a major constraint on people work/life freedom, wreaks havoc on lives and productivity choices. People are so un-productive and un-free with their time/life that most are not able to have progeny. Most people are working for society/the rich, in a work-time prison, they are told when to check-in, when to eat, when to check out, and when to have rest, just like farming chickens. A two-day no-choice rest, usually un-productive, just throw away 2/7 of one's life.\nTo get out of this problem, different civilizations tried different combinations, the Romans used 8 (= 7 work + 1 rest), the French Revolutionaries tried 10 (= 9 work + 1 rest), Russians tried 6 (= 5 work + 1 rest), then 5 (= 4 work + 1 rest). all failed. but there is a solution described in John N. Peters \u2033Better Work/Life Balance Productivity Schedule for much Better Work/Rest/Exercise Quality of Life\u2033\nLet \"w\" denote the hourly wage, \"k\" denote total hours available for labour and leisure, \"L\" denote the chosen number of working hours, \u03c0 denote income from non-labour sources, and \"A\" denote leisure hours chosen. The individual's problem is to maximise utility \"U\", which depends on total income available for spending on consumption and also depends on the time spent in leisure, subject to a time constraint, with respect to the choices of labour time and leisure time:\nformula_1\nThis is shown in the graph below, which illustrates the trade-off between allocating time to leisure activities and allocating it to income-generating activities. The linear constraint indicates that every additional hour of leisure undertaken requires the loss of an hour of labour and thus of the fixed amount of goods that that labour's income could purchase. Individuals must choose how much time to allocate to leisure activities and how much to working. This allocation decision is informed by the indifference curve labelled IC1. The curve indicates the combinations of leisure and work that will give the individual a specific level of utility. The point where the highest indifference curve is just tangent to the constraint line (point A), illustrates the optimum for this supplier of labour services.\nIf consumption is measured by the value of income obtained, this diagram can be used to show a variety of interesting effects. This is because the absolute value of the slope of the budget constraint is the wage rate. The point of optimisation (point A) reflects the equivalency between the wage rate and the marginal rate of substitution of leisure for income (the absolute value of the slope of the indifference curve). Because the marginal rate of substitution of leisure for income is also the ratio of the marginal utility of leisure (MUL) to the marginal utility of income (MUY), one can conclude:\nformula_2\nwhere \"Y\" is total income and the right side is the wage rate.\n\"Effects of a wage increase\"\nIf the wage rate increases, this individual's constraint line pivots up from X,Y1 to X,Y2. He/she can now purchase more goods and services. His/her utility will increase from point A on IC1 to point B on IC2.\nTo understand what effect this might have on the decision of how many hours to work, one must look at the income effect and substitution effect.\nThe wage increase shown in the previous diagram can be decomposed into two separate effects. The pure income effect is shown as the movement from point A to point C in the next diagram. Consumption increases from YA to YC and \u2013 since the diagram assumes that leisure is a normal good \u2013 leisure time increases from XA to XC. (Employment time decreases by the same amount as leisure increases.)\n\"The Income and Substitution effects of a wage increase\"\nBut that is only part of the picture. As the wage rate rises, the worker will substitute away from leisure and into the provision of labour\u2014that is, will work more hours to take advantage of the higher wage rate, or in other words substitute away from leisure because of its higher opportunity cost. This substitution effect is represented by the shift from point C to point B. The net impact of these two effects is shown by the shift from point A to point B. The relative magnitude of the two effects depends on the circumstances. In some cases, such as the one shown, the substitution effect is greater than the income effect (in which case more time will be allocated to working), but in other cases, the income effect will be greater than the substitution effect (in which case less time is allocated to working). The intuition behind this latter case is that the individual decides that the higher earnings on the previous amount of labour can be \"spent\" by purchasing more leisure.\n\"The Labour Supply curve\"\nIf the substitution effect is greater than the income effect, an individual's supply of labour services will increase as the wage rate rises, which is represented by a positive slope in the labour supply curve (as at point E in the adjacent diagram, which exhibits a positive wage elasticity). This positive relationship is increasing until point F, beyond which the income effect dominates the substitution effect and the individual starts to reduce the number of labour hours he supplies (point G) as wage increases; in other words, the wage elasticity is now negative.\nThe direction of the slope may change more than once for some individuals, and the labour supply curve is different for different individuals.\nOther variables that affect the labour supply decision, and can be readily incorporated into the model, include taxation, welfare, work environment, and income as a signal of ability or social contribution.\nNeoclassical demand.\nA firm's labour demand is based on its marginal physical product of labour (MPPL). This is defined as the additional output (or physical product) that results from an increase of one unit of labour (or from an infinitesimal increase in labour). (See also Production theory basics.)\nLabour demand is a derived demand; that is, hiring labour is not desired for its own sake but rather because it aids in producing output, which contributes to an employer's revenue and hence profits. The demand for an additional amount of labour depends on the Marginal Revenue Product (MRP) and the marginal cost (MC) of the worker. With a perfectly competitive goods market, the MRP is calculated by multiplying the price of the end product or service by the Marginal Physical Product of the worker. If the MRP is greater than a firm's Marginal Cost, then the firm will employ the worker since doing so will increase profit. The firm only employs however up to the point where MRP=MC, and not beyond, in neoclassical economic theory.\nThe MRP of the worker is affected by other inputs to production with which the worker can work (e.g. machinery), often aggregated under the term \"capital\". It is typical in economic models for greater availability of capital for a firm to increase the MRP of the worker, all else equal. Education and training are counted as \"human capital\". Since the amount of physical capital affects MRP, and since financial capital flows can affect the amount of physical capital available, MRP and thus wages can be affected by financial capital flows within and between countries, and the degree of capital mobility within and between countries.\nAccording to neoclassical theory, over the relevant range of outputs, the marginal physical product of labour is declining (law of diminishing returns). That is, as more and more units of labour are employed, their additional output begins to decline.\nAdditionally, although the MRP is a good way of expressing an employer's demand, other factors such as social group formation can the demand, as well as the labour supply. This constantly restructures exactly what a labour market is, and leads way to cause problems for theories of inflation.\nEquilibrium.\n\"A firm's labour demand in the short run (D) and a horizontal supply curve (S)\"\nThe marginal revenue product of labour can be used as the demand for labour curve for this firm in the short run. In competitive markets, a firm faces a perfectly elastic supply of labour which corresponds with the wage rate and the marginal resource cost of labour (W = SL = MFCL). In imperfect markets, the diagram would have to be adjusted because MFCL would then be equal to the wage rate divided by marginal costs. Because optimum resource allocation requires that marginal factor costs equal marginal revenue product, this firm would demand L units of labour as shown in the diagram.\nThe demand for labour of this firm can be summed with the demand for labour of all other firms in the economy to obtain the aggregate demand for labour. Likewise, the supply curves of all the individual workers (mentioned above) can be summed to obtain the aggregate supply of labour. These supply and demand curves can be analysed in the same way as any other industry demand and supply curves to determine equilibrium wage and employment levels.\nWage differences exist, particularly in mixed and fully/partly flexible labour markets. For example, the wages of a doctor and a port cleaner, both employed by the NHS, differ greatly. There are various factors concerning this phenomenon. This includes the MRP of the worker. A doctor's MRP is far greater than that of the port cleaner. In addition, the barriers to becoming a doctor are far greater than that of becoming a port cleaner. To become a doctor takes a lot of education and training which is costly, and only those who excel in academia can succeed in becoming doctors. The port cleaner, however, requires relatively less training. The supply of doctors is therefore significantly less elastic than that of port cleaners. Demand is also inelastic as there is a high demand for doctors and medical care is a necessity, so the NHS will pay higher wage rates to attract the profession.\nMonopsony.\nSome labour markets have a single employer and thus do not satisfy the perfect competition assumption of the neoclassical model above. The model of a monopsonistic labour market gives a lower quantity of employment and a lower equilibrium wage rate than does the competitive model.\nAsymmetric information.\nIn many real-life situations, the assumption of perfect information is unrealistic. An employer does not necessarily know how hard workers are working or how productive they are. This provides an incentive for workers to shirk from providing their full effort, called moral hazard. Since it is difficult for the employer to identify the hard-working and the shirking employees, there is no incentive to work hard and productivity falls overall, leading to the hiring of more workers and a lower unemployment rate.\nOne solution that is used to avoid a moral hazard is stock options that grant employees the chance to benefit directly from a firm's success. However, this solution has attracted criticism as executives with large stock-option packages have been suspected of acting to over-inflate share values to the detriment of the long-run welfare of the firm. Another solution, foreshadowed by the rise of temporary workers in Japan and the firing of many of these workers in response to the 2008 financial crisis, is more flexible job- contracts and -terms that encourage employees to work less than full-time by partially compensating for the loss of hours, relying on workers to adapt their working time in response to job requirements and economic conditions instead of the employer trying to determine how much work is needed to complete a given task and overestimating.\nAnother aspect of uncertainty results from the firm's imperfect knowledge about worker ability. If a firm is unsure about a worker's ability, it pays a wage assuming that the worker's ability is the average of similar workers. This wage under compensates high-ability workers which may drive them away from the labour market as well as at the same time attracting low-ability workers. Such a phenomenon, called adverse selection, can sometimes lead to market collapse.\nOne way to combat adverse selection, firms will try to use signalling, pioneered by Michael Spence, whereby employers could use various characteristics of applicants differentiate between high-ability or low-ability workers. One common signal used is education, whereby employers assume that high-ability workers will have higher levels of education. Employers can then compensate high-ability workers with higher wages. However, signalling does not always work, and it may appear to an external observer that education has raised the marginal product of labour, without this necessarily being true.\nSearch models.\nOne of the major research achievements of the 1990\u20132010 period was the development of a framework with dynamic search, matching, and bargaining.\nPersonnel economics: hiring and incentives.\nAt the micro level, one sub-discipline eliciting increased attention in recent decades is analysis of internal labour markets, that is, \"within\" firms (or other organisations), studied in personnel economics from the perspective of personnel management. By contrast, external labour markets \"imply that workers move somewhat fluidly between firms and wages are determined by some aggregate process where firms do not have significant discretion over wage setting.\" The focus is on \"how firms establish, maintain, and end employment relationships and on how firms provide incentives to employees,\" including models and empirical work on incentive systems and as constrained by economic efficiency and risk/incentive tradeoffs relating to personnel compensation.\nDiscrimination and inequality.\nInequality and discrimination in the workplace can have many effects on workers.\nIn the context of labour economics, inequality is usually referring to the unequal distribution of earning between households. Inequality is commonly measured by economists using the Gini coefficient. Over time, inequality has, on average, been increasing. This is due to numerous factors including labour supply and demand shifts as well as institutional changes in the labour market. On the shifts in labour supply and demand, factors include demand for skilled workers going up more than the supply of skilled workers and relative to unskilled workers as well as technological changes that increase productivity; all of these things cause wages to go up for skilled labour while unskilled worker wages stay the same or decline. As for the institutional changes, a decrease in union power and a declining real minimum wage, which both reduce unskilled workers wages, and tax cuts for the wealthy all increase the inequality gap between groups of earners.\nAs for discrimination, it is the difference in pay that can be attributed to the demographic differences between people, such as gender, race, ethnicity, religion, sexual orientation, etc., even though these factors do not affect the productivity of the worker. Many regions and countries have enacted government policies to combat discrimination, including discrimination in the workplace. Discrimination can be modelled and measured in numerous ways. The Oaxaca decomposition is a common method to calculate the amount of discrimination that exists when wages differ between groups of people. This decomposition aims to calculate the difference in wages that occurs because of differences in skills versus the returns to those skills. A way of modelling discrimination in the workplace when dealing with wages are Gary Becker's taste models. Using taste models, employer discrimination can be thought of as the employer not hiring the minority worker because of their perceived cost of hiring that worker is higher than that of the cost of hiring a non-minority worker, which causes less hiring of the minority. Another taste model is for employee discrimination, which does not cause a decline in the hiring of minorities, but instead causes a more segregated workforce because the prejudiced worker feels that they should be paid more to work next to the worker they are prejudiced against or that they are not paid an equal amount as the worker they are prejudiced against. One more taste model involves customer discrimination, whereby the employers themselves are not prejudiced but believe that their customers might be, so therefore the employer is less likely to hire the minority worker if they are going to interact with customers that are prejudiced. There are many other taste models other than these that Gary Becker has made to explain discrimination that causes differences in hiring in wages in the labour market.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nOrley C.

The name originates from the word \"loaf\" in reference to bread and \"Mass\" in reference to the Eucharist. It is a festival in the liturgical calendar to mark the blessing of the First Fruits of harvest, with a loaf of bread being brought to the church for this purpose. Lammastide falls at the halfway point between the summer solstice and the autumn equinox. Christians also have church processions to bakeries, where those working therein are blessed by Christian clergy.\nWhile Lammas is traditionally a Christian holy day, some neopagans have adopted the name and date for one of their harvest festivals in their Wheel of the Year. It is also the same date as the Gaelic harvest festival Lughnasadh.\nName.\nThe name 'Lammas' comes from Old English meaning \"loaf mass\". \nSeveral antiquarians suggested that the name 'Lammas' came from 'lamb mass'. John Brady supposed that tenants of the Cathedral of York, dedicated to St Peter in Chains, of which this is the feast, were required to bring a live lamb to the church.\nAnother name for the feast in the Middle Ages was the 'Gule of August'. It has been suggested, following the 18th-century Welsh clerical antiquary John Pettingall, that this is an anglicisation of \"\", Welsh for \"feast of August\".\nHistory.\nIn Christianity, the offering of first fruits to God is described in the Old Testament, which depicts how, \"when the harvest ripened, the priest went into the field and gathered a sheaf of first-ripened grain. Then he took that sheaf into the temple and waved it before the Lord.\" The Didache of the early Church enjoined firstfruits be given of \"money, clothes, and all of your possessions\" (13:7).\nIn Anglo-Saxon England Lammas was the name for the first day of August and was described in Old English literature as \"the feast of first fruits\", being mentioned often in the \"Anglo-Saxon Chronicle\". It was probably the day when loaves baked from the first of the wheat harvest were blessed at church. The loaves might then have been used in protective rituals: a book of Anglo-Saxon charms directed that the Lammas loaf be broken into four parts, which were to be placed at the four corners of the barn, to protect the grain.\nFor many villeins, the wheat must have run low in the days before Lammas, and the new harvest began a season of plenty, of hard work and company in the fields, reaping in teams. In the medieval agricultural year, Lammas also marked the end of the hay harvest that had begun after Midsummer. At the end of hay-making a sheep would be loosed in the meadow among the mowers, for him to keep who could catch it.\nHistorian Ronald Hutton writes \"the time that the first of the harvest could be gathered would have been a natural point for celebration in an agrarian society\". He says it is likely \"that a pre-Christian festival had existed among the Anglo-Saxons on that date\". Folklorist M\u00e1ire MacNeill linked Lammas with the Insular Celtic harvest festival Lughnasadh, held on the same date, and suggested the Anglo-Saxons adopted it from the Celtic Britons. She highlighted the apparent lack of a Continental Germanic festival on 1 August, and the apparent borrowing of the Welsh name \"G\u0175yl Awst\", 'Gule of August'. However, Hutton says that \"MacNeill's thesis of a pan-Celtic seasonal ritual, like her reconstruction of pagan rites, is so far un-proven\" and to prove it \"would involve a detailed knowledge of the religious calendar of the Anglo-Saxons before they arrived in England, which is impossible\".\nLammas Day was one of the traditional Scottish quarter days before 1886. Lammas also coincided with the feast of St Peter in Chains, commemorating Saint Peter's miraculous deliverance from prison, but in the liturgical reform of 1969 the feast of St Alphonsus Liguori was transferred to this day.\nAnn Lewin explains the Christian feast of Lammas (Loaf Mass Day) and its importance in the liturgical year:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;August begins with Lammas Day, Loaf Mass Day, the day in the Book of Common Prayer calendar when a loaf baked with flour from newly harvested corn would be brought into church and blessed. It's one of the oldest points of contact between the agricultural world and the Church. The others were Plough Sunday in early January, the Sunday after Epiphany and the day before work would begin again in the fields after Christmas festivities, when ploughs would be brought to church to be blessed; and Rogation days in May, the days before Ascension Day, when God's blessing would be sought on the growing crops. \nToday, in the Church of England, the mother church of the Anglican Communion, during the celebration of Holy Communion, \"The Lammas loaf, or part of it, may be used as the bread of the Eucharist, or the Lammas loaf and the eucharistic bread may be kept separate.\" \"Common Worship\" specifies: \n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The Lammas loaf should ideally be baked by members of the congregation, using local produce wherever possible. Other small loaves or buns, in the tradition of 'blessed bread,' may be distributed to the congregation. Part of the Lammas loaf may be used as the eucharistic bread on this occasion. Two patterns of readings are suggested, the first concerning the offering of the first-fruits and the second concerning the bread of life.\nChristians also have church processions to bakeries, where those working therein are blessed by Christian clergy.\nIn Shakespeare's \"Romeo and Juliet\" (1.3.19) it is observed of Juliet, \"Come Lammas Eve at night shall she [Juliet] be fourteen.\" Another well-known cultural reference is the opening of \"The Battle of Otterburn\": \"It fell about the Lammas tide when the muir-men win their hay.\"\nOther uses.\nNeopaganism.\nSome neopagans have adopted the name and date of Lammas, making it one of the harvest festivals in their Wheel of the Year. Other neopagans use the Gaelic name \"Lughnasa\". It is the first of the three autumn festivals, the others being the autumn equinox and Samhain. In the Northern Hemisphere it takes place around 1 August, while in the Southern Hemisphere it is celebrated around 1 February.\nHorticulture.\n\"Lammas leaves\" or \"Lammas growth\" refers to a second crop of leaves produced in high summer by some species of trees in temperate countries to replace those lost to insect damage. They often differ slightly in shape, texture and/or hairiness from the earlier leaves. \nLammas Fairs.\nExeter in Devon is one of the few towns in England that still celebrates its Lammas Fair and has a processional custom which stretches back over 900 years, led by the Lord Mayor. During the fair a white glove on a pole decorated with garlands is raised above the Guildhall. The fair now takes place on the first Thursday in July. Other examples include Ould Lammas Fair and Inverkeithing Lammas Fair.St Andrews in Fife, Scotland continues to have an annual Lammas Fair which takes place along streets in the town.\nSustainability.\nA low-impact development project at Tir y Gafel, Glandwr, Pembrokeshire, Lammas Ecovillage, is a collective initiative for nine self-built homes. It was the first such project to obtain planning permission based on a predecessor of what is now the sixth national planning guidance for sustainable rural communities originally proposed by the One Planet Council.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The population was 15,853 at the 2020 census.\nHistory.\nLongmeadow was first settled in 1644, and officially incorporated October 17, 1783. The town was originally farmland within the limits of Springfield. It remained relatively pastoral until the street railway was built c.\u20091910, when the population tripled over a fifteen-year period. After Interstate 91 was built in the wetlands on the west side of town, population tripled again between 1960 and 1975.\nDuring the 19th and early 20th centuries, Longmeadow was best known as the site from which Longmeadow brownstone was mined. Several famous American buildings, including Princeton University's Neo-Gothic library, are made of Longmeadow brownstone. In 1894, the more populous and industrialized \"East Village\" portion of the town containing the brownstone quarries split off to become East Longmeadow.\nDesigned by famed golf course architect Donald Ross in 1922, the Longmeadow Country Club was the proving ground for golf equipment designed and manufactured by the Spalding Co. of Chicopee. Bobby Jones, a consultant for Spalding, was a member in standing at LCC and made a number of his instructional films at LCC in the 1930s.\nGeography.\nLongmeadow is located in the western part of the state, just south of the city of Springfield, and is bordered on the west by the Connecticut River and Agawam, to the east by East Longmeadow, and to the south by Enfield, Connecticut. It extends approximately north to south and east to west. It is approximately north of Hartford.\nMore than 30% of the town is permanent open space. Conservation areas on the west side of town include more than bordering the Connecticut River. The area supports a wide range of wildlife including deer, beaver, wild turkeys, foxes, and eagles. Springfield's Forest Park, which at is the largest city park in New England, forms the northern border of the town. The private Twin Hills and public Franconia golf courses, plus town athletic fields and conservation land, cover nearly 2/3 of the eastern border of the town. Two large public parks, the Longmeadow Country Club, and three conservation areas account for the bulk of the remaining formal open space. Almost 20% of the houses in town are in proximity to a \"dingle\", a tree-lined steep-sided sandy ravine with a wetland at the bottom that provides a privacy barrier between yards.\nLongmeadow has a town common, commonly referred to as \"The Green\", located along U.S. Route 5 on the west side of town. It is approximately long. Roughly 100 houses date back before 1900, most of which are in the historic district, are located near the town green. Longmeadow's Town Green is a historic district on the National Register of Historic Places, and it is surrounded by a number of buildings dating back to the 18th and 19th centuries. Longmeadow is unique as the town green has maintained its residential purpose and has resisted commercial pressure. The current function as listed by the National Register of Historic Places is domestic and landscape. The current sub-function as listed by the National Register of Historic Places is park and single dwelling. Houses along the photogenic main street (Longmeadow Street) are set back farther than in most towns of similar residential density. The town has three recently remodeled elementary schools, two secondary schools, and one high school. The commercial center of town is an area called \"The Longmeadow Shops\", including restaurants and clothing stores.\nAccording to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which are land and , or 5.34%, are water.\nDemographics.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"US Census population/styles.css\"/&gt;\nAs of the census of 2000, there were 15,633 people, 5,734 households, and 4,432 families residing in the town. The population density was . There were 5,879 housing units at an average density of . The racial makeup of the town was 95.42% White, 0.69% African American, 0.05% Native American, 2.90% Asian, 0.06% Pacific Islander, 0.26% from other races, and 0.62% from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 1.09% of the population.\nThere were 5,734 households, out of which 37.1% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 69.1% were married couples living together, 6.4% had a female householder with no husband present, and 22.7% were non-families. 20.4% of all households were made up of individuals, and 14.0% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.66 and the average family size was 3.09.\nIn the town, the population was spread out, with 26.8% under the age of 18, 4.6% from 18 to 24, 22.0% from 25 to 44, 28.7% from 45 to 64, and 17.8% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 43 years. For every 100 females, there were 87.7 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 82.0 males.\nThe median income for a household in the town was $109,586, and the median income for a family was $115,578. Males had a median income of $68,238 versus $40,890 for females. The per capita income for the town was $48,949. About 1.0% of families and 2.1% of the population were below the poverty line, including 0.3% of those under age 18 and 8.3% of those age 65 or over.\nGovernment.\nThe town is chartered as an Open Town Meeting form of government. The town government also consists of a Select Board with five members, elected by the town. The public school system is governed by the School Committee. The School Committee is made up of seven voting members elected by the town, the superintendent of schools, two assistant-superintendents, a secretary, and a student representative.\nEducation.\nThe Longmeadow public school system operates six schools. Blueberry Hill School, Center School, and Wolf Swamp Road School are K\u22125 elementary schools. Williams Middle School and Glenbrook Middle School serve grades 6\u20138. Longmeadow High School serves all students in the town between grades 9 and 12. The town's elementary schools have been recently rebuilt, statements of interest for improvements to the two middle schools and Longmeadow High School were filed with the Massachusetts School Building Authority in 2007. In 2010, the voters of Longmeadow approved a 2.5% budget override to support the construction of a new $78 million high school. The town received an estimated $34 million in state funds to be used towards the new construction The new High School was completed and opened to students on February 26, 2013. After students and faculty had moved into the new school, the demolition of the old school was begun. The demolition was completed by June 2013. The school had its grand opening in September 2013 with both the brand new school and renovated business &amp; administration wing open.\nLongmeadow also hosts two private parochial schools, the http:// (LYA) and https://. LYA was established in 1946 in response to the Greater Springfield Jewish community's need for a quality Jewish day school. In 1999, LYA became the first Jewish day school to be accredited by the New England Association of Schools and Colleges (NEASC). The more than 90 students that the school serves each year from across the spectrum of Jewish life include orthodox, conservative, reform, and unaffiliated families. St. Mary's Academy, located behind St. Mary's Church, serves Catholic students grades Pre-K through Grade 8.\nApproximately 50% of the students at Longmeadow High School participate in the music program. The choruses have won numerous gold medals at the MICCA competition. The jazz ensemble has won numerous gold medals as well, but no longer competes. The honors chorus \"Lyrics\" has won numerous awards and has traveled to many places around the world on tours, such as Italy and Sweden. The wind ensemble and symphony orchestra have had the honor of performing in Indianapolis, Boston (Boston Symphony Hall), and New York (Carnegie Hall). In 2010, Longmeadow was awarded The American Prize in Orchestral Performance. The music program's crowning achievement has been receiving three national Grammy Awards based on the high level of excellence maintained throughout all groups in the music program.\nLongmeadow is home to the primary campus of Bay Path University, a private undergraduate and graduate institution founded in 1897.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "18183", "revid": "48549243", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18183", "title": "Body relative direction", "text": "Relative geometrical orientations\nBody relative directions (also known as egocentric coordinates) are geometrical orientations relative to a body such as a human person's body or a road sign.\nThe most common ones are: left and right; forward and backward; up and down.\nThey form three pairs of orthogonal axes.\nTraditions and conventions.\nSince definitions of left and right based on the geometry of the natural environment are unwieldy, in practice, the meaning of relative direction words is conveyed through tradition, acculturation, education, and direct reference. One common definition of up and down uses the gravity of Earth as a frame of reference. Since there is a very noticeable force of gravity acting between the Earth and any other nearby object, down is defined as that direction consistent with the local gravitational field unit vector, in other words, the direction which an object moves in reference to the Earth when the object is allowed to fall freely. Up is then defined as the opposite direction of down. Another common definition uses a human body, standing upright, as a frame of reference. In that case, up is defined as the direction from feet to head, perpendicular to the surface of the Earth. In most cases, up is a directionally oriented position generally opposite to that of the pull of gravity.\nIn situations where a common frame of reference is needed, it is most common to use an egocentric view. A simple example is road signage. Another example is stage blocking, where \"stage left\" \"stage right\" are, by convention, defined from the point of view of actors facing the audience. \"Upstage\" and \"downstage\" do not follow gravity but by convention mean away from and towards the audience. An example of a non-egocentric view is page layout, where the relative terms \"upper half\" \"left margin,\" etc. are defined in terms of the observer but employed in reverse for a type compositor, returning to an egocentric view. In medicine and science, where precise definitions are crucial, relative directions (left and right) are the sides of the organism, not those of the observer. The same is true in heraldry, where left and right in a coat of arms is treated as if the shield were being held by the armiger. To avoid confusion, Latin terminology is employed: \"dexter\" and \"sinister\" for right and left. Proper right and proper left are terms mainly used to describe artistic images, and overcome the potential confusion that a figure's \"own\" right or \"proper right\" hand is on the left hand as the viewer sees it from the front.\nForward and backward may be defined by referring to an object's or organism's motion. Forward is defined as the direction in which the object is moving. Backward is then defined as the opposite direction to forward. Alternatively, 'forward' may be the direction pointed by the observer's nose, defining 'backward' as the direction from the nose to the sagittal border in the observer's skull. With respect to a ship 'forward' would indicate the relative position of any object lying in the direction the ship is pointing. For symmetrical objects, it is also necessary to define forward and backward in terms of expected direction. Many mass transit trains are built symmetrically with paired control booths, and definitions of forward, backward, left, and right are temporary.\nGiven significant distance from the magnetic poles, one can figure which hand is which using a magnetic compass and the sun. Facing the sun, before noon, the north pointer of the compass points to the \"left\" hand. After noon, it points to the \"right\".\nGeometry of the natural environment.\n A right-hand rule is one common way to relate three principal directions. For many years a fundamental question in physics was whether a left-hand rule would be equivalent. Many natural structures, including human bodies, follow a certain \"handedness\", but it was widely assumed that nature did not distinguish the two possibilities. This changed with the discovery of parity violations in particle physics. If a sample of cobalt-60 atoms is magnetized so that they spin counterclockwise around some axis, the beta radiation resulting from their nuclear decay will be preferentially directed opposite that axis. Since counter-clockwise may be defined in terms of up, forward, and right, this experiment unambiguously differentiates left from right using only natural elements: if they were reversed, or the atoms spun clockwise, the radiation would follow the spin axis instead of being opposite to it.\nNautical terminology.\nBow, stern, port, starboard, fore and aft are nautical terms that convey an impersonal relative direction in the context of the moving frame of persons aboard a ship. The need for impersonal terms is most clearly seen in a rowing shell where the majority of the crew face aft (\"backwards\"), hence the oars to their right are actually on the port side of the boat. Rowers eschew the terms left, right, port and starboard in favor of stroke-side and bow-side. The usage derives from the tradition of having the stroke (the rower closest to the stern of the boat) oar on the port side of the boat.\nCultures without relative directions.\nMost human cultures use relative directions for reference, but there are exceptions. Some Australian Aboriginal languages like Guugu Yimithirr, Kayardild and Kuuk Thaayorre have no words denoting the egocentric directions; instead, speakers exclusively refer to cardinal directions, even when describing small-scale spaces. For instance, if they wanted someone to move over on the car seat to make room, they might say \"move a bit to the east\". To tell someone where exactly they left something in their house, they might say, \"I left it on the southern edge of the western table.\" Or they might warn a person to \"look out for that big ant just north of your foot\". Other peoples \"from Polynesia to Mexico and from Namibia to Bali\" similarly have predominantly \"geographic languages\". American Sign Language makes heavy use of geographical direction through absolute orientation.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "18184", "revid": "14423536", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18184", "title": "Lizard", "text": "Informal group of reptiles\nLizard is the common name used for all squamate reptiles other than snakes (and to a lesser extent amphisbaenians), encompassing over 7,000 species, ranging across all continents except Antarctica, as well as most oceanic island chains. The grouping is paraphyletic as some lizards are more closely related to snakes than they are to other lizards. Lizards range in size from chameleons and geckos a few centimeters long to the 3-meter-long Komodo dragon.\nMost lizards are quadrupedal, running with a strong side-to-side motion. Some lineages (known as \"legless lizards\") have secondarily lost their legs, and have long snake-like bodies. Some lizards, such as the forest-dwelling \"Draco\", are able to glide. They are often territorial, the males fighting off other males and signalling, often with bright colours, to attract mates and to intimidate rivals. Lizards are mainly carnivorous, often being sit-and-wait predators; many smaller species eat insects, while the Komodo eats mammals as big as water buffalo.\nLizards make use of a variety of antipredator adaptations, including venom, camouflage, reflex bleeding, and the ability to sacrifice and regrow their tails.\nAnatomy.\nLargest and smallest.\nThe adult length of species within the suborder ranges from a few centimeters for chameleons such as \"Brookesia micra\" and geckos such as \"Sphaerodactylus ariasae\" to nearly in the case of the largest living varanid lizard, the Komodo dragon. Most lizards are fairly small animals.\nDistinguishing features.\nLizards typically have rounded torsos, elevated heads on short necks, four limbs and long tails, although some are legless. Lizards and snakes share a movable quadrate bone, distinguishing them from the rhynchocephalians, which have more rigid diapsid skulls. Some lizards such as chameleons have prehensile tails, assisting them in climbing among vegetation.\nAs in other reptiles, the skin of lizards is covered in overlapping scales made of keratin. This provides protection from the environment and reduces water loss through evaporation. This adaptation enables lizards to thrive in some of the driest deserts on earth. The skin is tough and leathery, and is shed (sloughed) as the animal grows. Unlike snakes which shed the skin in a single piece, lizards slough their skin in several pieces. The scales may be modified into spines for display or protection, and some species have bone osteoderms underneath the scales.\nThe dentitions of lizards reflect their wide range of diets, including carnivorous, insectivorous, omnivorous, herbivorous, nectivorous, and molluscivorous. Species typically have uniform teeth suited to their diet, but several species have variable teeth, such as cutting teeth in the front of the jaws and crushing teeth in the rear. Most species are pleurodont, though agamids and chameleons are acrodont.\nThe tongue can be extended outside the mouth, and is often long. In the beaded lizards, whiptails and monitor lizards, the tongue is forked and used mainly or exclusively to sense the environment, continually flicking out to sample the environment, and back to transfer molecules to the vomeronasal organ responsible for chemosensation, analogous to but different from smell or taste. In geckos, the tongue is used to lick the eyes clean: they have no eyelids. Chameleons have very long sticky tongues which can be extended rapidly to catch their insect prey.\nThree lineages, the geckos, anoles, and chameleons, have modified the scales under their toes to form adhesive pads, highly prominent in the first two groups. The pads are composed of millions of tiny setae (hair-like structures) which fit closely to the substrate to adhere using van der Waals forces; no liquid adhesive is needed. In addition, the toes of chameleons are divided into two opposed groups on each foot (zygodactyly), enabling them to perch on branches as birds do.\nPhysiology.\nLocomotion.\nAside from legless lizards, most lizards are quadrupedal and move using gaits with alternating movement of the right and left limbs with substantial body bending. This body bending prevents significant respiration during movement, limiting their endurance, in a mechanism called Carrier's constraint. Several species can run bipedally, and a few can prop themselves up on their hindlimbs and tail while stationary. Several small species such as those in the genus \"Draco\" can glide: some can attain a distance of , losing in height. Some species, like geckos and chameleons, adhere to vertical surfaces including glass and ceilings. Some species, like the common basilisk, can run across water.\nSenses.\nLizards make use of their senses of sight, touch, olfaction and hearing like other vertebrates. The balance of these varies with the habitat of different species; for instance, skinks that live largely covered by loose soil rely heavily on olfaction and touch, while geckos depend largely on acute vision for their ability to hunt and to evaluate the distance to their prey before striking. Monitor lizards have acute vision, hearing, and olfactory senses. Some lizards make unusual use of their sense organs: chameleons can steer their eyes in different directions, sometimes providing non-overlapping fields of view, such as forwards and backwards at once. Lizards lack external ears, having instead a circular opening in which the tympanic membrane (eardrum) can be seen. Many species rely on hearing for early warning of predators, and flee at the slightest sound.\nAs in snakes and many mammals, all lizards have a specialised olfactory system, the vomeronasal organ, used to detect pheromones. Monitor lizards transfer scent from the tip of their tongue to the organ; the tongue is used only for this information-gathering purpose, and is not involved in manipulating food.\nSome lizards, particularly iguanas, have retained a photosensory organ on the top of their heads called the parietal eye, a basal (\"primitive\") feature also present in the tuatara. This \"eye\" has only a rudimentary retina and lens and cannot form images, but is sensitive to changes in light and dark and can detect movement. This helps them detect predators stalking it from above.\nVenom.\nUntil 2006 it was thought that the Gila monster and the Mexican beaded lizard were the only venomous lizards. However, several species of monitor lizards, including the Komodo dragon, produce powerful venom in their oral glands. Lace monitor venom, for instance, causes swift loss of consciousness and extensive bleeding through its pharmacological effects, both lowering blood pressure and preventing blood clotting. Nine classes of toxin known from snakes are produced by lizards. The range of actions provides the potential for new medicinal drugs based on lizard venom proteins.\nGenes associated with venom toxins have been found in the salivary glands of a wide range of lizards, including species traditionally thought of as non-venomous, such as iguanas and bearded dragons. This suggests that these genes evolved in the common ancestor of lizards and snakes, some 200 million years ago (forming a single clade, the Toxicofera). However, most of these putative venom genes were \"housekeeping genes\" found in all cells and tissues, including skin and cloacal scent glands. The genes in question may thus be evolutionary precursors of venom genes.\nRespiration.\nRecent studies (2013 and 2014) on the lung anatomy of the savannah monitor and green iguana found them to have a unidirectional airflow system, which involves the air moving in a loop through the lungs when breathing. This was previously thought to only exist in the archosaurs (crocodilians and birds). This may be evidence that unidirectional airflow is an ancestral trait in diapsids.\nReproduction and life cycle.\nAs with all amniotes, lizards rely on internal fertilisation and copulation involves the male inserting one of his hemipenes into the female's cloaca. Female lizards also have\nhemiclitorises, a doubled\nclitoris. The majority of species are oviparous (egg laying). The female deposits the eggs in a protective structure like a nest or crevice or simply on the ground. Depending on the species, clutch size can vary from 4\u20135 percent of the females body weight to 40\u201350 percent and clutches range from one or a few large eggs to dozens of small ones. \nIn most lizards, the eggs have leathery shells to allow for the exchange of water, although more arid-living species have calcified shells to retain water. Inside the eggs, the embryos use nutrients from the yolk. Parental care is uncommon and the female usually abandons the eggs after laying them. Brooding and protection of eggs do occur in some species. The female prairie skink uses respiratory water loss to maintain the humidity of the eggs which facilitates embryonic development. In lace monitors, the young hatch close to 300 days, and the female returns to help them escape the termite mound where the eggs were laid.\nAround 20 percent of lizard species reproduce via viviparity (live birth). This is particularly common in Anguimorphs. Viviparous species give birth to relatively developed young which look like miniature adults. Embryos are nourished via a placenta-like structure. A minority of lizards have parthenogenesis (reproduction from unfertilised eggs). These species consist of all females who reproduce asexually with no need for males. This is known to occur in various species of whiptail lizards. Parthenogenesis was also recorded in species that normally reproduce sexually. A captive female Komodo dragon produced a clutch of eggs, despite being separated from males for over two years.\nSex determination in lizards can be temperature-dependent. The temperature of the eggs' micro-environment can determine the sex of the hatched young: low temperature incubation produces more females while higher temperatures produce more males. However, some lizards have sex chromosomes and both male heterogamety (XY and XXY) and female heterogamety (ZW) occur.\nAging.\nA significant component of aging in the painted dragon lizard \"Ctenophorus pictus\" is fading breeding colors. By manipulating superoxide levels (using a superoxide dismutase mimetic) it was shown that this fading coloration is likely due to gradual loss with lizard age of an innate capacity for antioxidation due to increasing DNA damage.\nBehaviour.\nDiurnality and thermoregulation.\nThe majority of lizard species are active during the day, though some are active at night, notably geckos. As ectotherms, lizards have a limited ability to regulate their body temperature, and must seek out and bask in sunlight to gain enough heat to become fully active. Thermoregulation behavior can be beneficial in the short term for lizards as it allows the ability to buffer environmental variation and endure climate warming.\nIn high altitudes, the \"Podarcis hispaniscus\" responds to higher temperature with a darker dorsal coloration to prevent UV-radiation and background matching. Their thermoregulatory mechanisms also allow the lizard to maintain their ideal body temperature for optimal mobility.\nTerritoriality.\nMost social interactions among lizards are between breeding individuals. Territoriality is common and is correlated with species that use sit-and-wait hunting strategies. Males establish and maintain territories that contain resources that attract females and which they defend from other males. Important resources include basking, feeding, and nesting sites as well as refuges from predators. The habitat of a species affects the structure of territories, for example, rock lizards have territories atop rocky outcrops. Some species may aggregate in groups, enhancing vigilance and lessening the risk of predation for individuals, particularly for juveniles. Agonistic behaviour typically occurs between sexually mature males over territory or mates and may involve displays, posturing, chasing, grappling and biting.\nCommunication.\nLizards signal both to attract mates and to intimidate rivals. Visual displays include body postures and inflation, push-ups, bright colours, mouth gapings and tail waggings. Male anoles and iguanas have dewlaps or skin flaps which come in various sizes, colours and patterns and the expansion of the dewlap as well as head-bobs and body movements add to the visual signals. Some species have deep blue dewlaps and communicate with ultraviolet signals. Blue-tongued skinks will flash their tongues as a threat display. Chameleons are known to change their complex colour patterns when communicating, particularly during agonistic encounters. They tend to show brighter colours when displaying aggression and darker colours when they submit or \"give up\".\nSeveral gecko species are brightly coloured; some species tilt their bodies to display their coloration. In certain species, brightly coloured males turn dull when not in the presence of rivals or females. While it is usually males that display, in some species females also use such communication. In the bronze anole, head-bobs are a common form of communication among females, the speed and frequency varying with age and territorial status. Chemical cues or pheromones are also important in communication. Males typically direct signals at rivals, while females direct them at potential mates. Lizards may be able to recognise individuals of the same species by their scent.\nAcoustic communication is less common in lizards. Hissing, a typical reptilian sound, is mostly produced by larger species as part of a threat display, accompanying gaping jaws. Some groups, particularly geckos, snake-lizards, and some iguanids, can produce more complex sounds and vocal apparatuses have independently evolved in different groups. These sounds are used for courtship, territorial defense and in distress, and include clicks, squeaks, barks and growls. The mating call of the male tokay gecko is heard as \"tokay-tokay!\". Tactile communication involves individuals rubbing against each other, either in courtship or in aggression. Some chameleon species communicate with one another by vibrating the substrate that they are standing on, such as a tree branch or leaf.\nDefence.\nLizards are normally quick and agile to easily outrun attackers.\nEcology.\nDistribution and habitat.\nLizards are found worldwide, excluding the far north and Antarctica, and some islands. They can be found in elevations from sea level to . They prefer warmer, tropical climates but are adaptable and can live in all but the most extreme environments. Lizards also exploit a number of habitats; most primarily live on the ground, but others may live in rocks, on trees, underground and even in water. The marine iguana is adapted for life in the sea.\nDiet.\nThe majority of lizard species are predatory and the most common prey items are small, terrestrial invertebrates, particularly insects. Many species are sit-and-wait predators though others may be more active foragers. Chameleons prey on numerous insect species, such as beetles, grasshoppers and winged termites as well as spiders. They rely on persistence and ambush to capture these prey. An individual perches on a branch and stays perfectly still, with only its eyes moving. When an insect lands, the chameleon focuses its eyes on the target and slowly moves toward it before projecting its long sticky tongue which, when hauled back, brings the attached prey with it. Geckos feed on crickets, beetles, termites and moths.\nTermites are an important part of the diets of some species of Autarchoglossa, since, as social insects, they can be found in large numbers in one spot. Ants may form a prominent part of the diet of some lizards, particularly among the lacertas. Horned lizards are also well known for specializing on ants. Due to their small size and indigestible chitin, ants must be consumed in large amounts, and ant-eating lizards have larger stomachs than even herbivorous ones. Species of skink and alligator lizards eat snails and their power jaws and molar-like teeth are adapted for breaking the shells.\nLarger species, such as monitor lizards, can feed on larger prey including fish, frogs, birds, mammals and other reptiles. Prey may be swallowed whole and torn into smaller pieces. Both bird and reptile eggs may also be consumed as well. Gila monsters and beaded lizards climb trees to reach both the eggs and young of birds. Despite being venomous, these species rely on their strong jaws to kill prey. Mammalian prey typically consists of rodents and leporids; the Komodo dragon can kill prey as large as water buffalo. Dragons are prolific scavengers, and a single decaying carcass can attract several from away. A dragon is capable of consuming a carcass in 17 minutes.\nAround 2 percent of lizard species, including many iguanids, are herbivores. Adults of these species eat plant parts like flowers, leaves, stems and fruit, while juveniles eat more insects. Plant parts can be hard to digest, and, as they get closer to adulthood, juvenile iguanas eat faeces from adults to acquire the microflora necessary for their transition to a plant-based diet. Perhaps the most herbivorous species is the marine iguana which dives to forage for algae, kelp and other marine plants. Some non-herbivorous species supplement their insect diet with fruit, which is easily digested.\nAntipredator adaptations.\nLizards have a variety of antipredator adaptations, including running and climbing, venom, camouflage, tail autotomy, and reflex bleeding.\nCamouflage.\nLizards exploit a variety of different camouflage methods. Many lizards are disruptively patterned. In some species, such as Aegean wall lizards, individuals vary in colour, and select rocks which best match their own colour to minimise the risk of being detected by predators. The Moorish gecko is able to change colour for camouflage: when a light-coloured gecko is placed on a dark surface, it darkens within an hour to match the environment. The chameleons in general use their ability to change their coloration for signalling rather than camouflage, but some species such as Smith's dwarf chameleon do use active colour change for camouflage purposes.\nThe flat-tail horned lizard's body is coloured like its desert background, and is flattened and fringed with white scales to minimise its shadow.\nAutotomy.\nMany lizards, including geckos and skinks, are capable of shedding their tails (autotomy). The detached tail, sometimes brilliantly coloured, continues to writhe after detaching, distracting the predator's attention from the fleeing prey. Lizards partially regenerate their tails over a period of weeks. Some 326 genes are involved in regenerating lizard tails. The fish-scale gecko \"Geckolepis megalepis \" sheds patches of skin and scales if grabbed.\nEscape, playing dead, reflex bleeding.\nMany lizards attempt to escape from danger by running to a place of safety; for example, wall lizards can run up walls and hide in holes or cracks. Horned lizards adopt differing defences for specific predators. They may play dead to deceive a predator that has caught them; attempt to outrun the rattlesnake, which does not pursue prey; but stay still, relying on their cryptic coloration, for \"Masticophis\" whip snakes which can catch even swift prey. If caught, some species such as the greater short-horned lizard puff themselves up, making their bodies hard for a narrow-mouthed predator like a whip snake to swallow. Finally, horned lizards can squirt blood at cat and dog predators from a pouch beneath its eyes, to a distance of about ; the blood tastes foul to these attackers.\nEvolution.\nFossil history.\nThe closest living relatives of lizards are rhynchocephalians, a once diverse order of reptiles, of which is there is now only one living species, the tuatara of New Zealand. Some reptiles from the Early and Middle Triassic, like \"Sophineta\" and \"Megachirella\", are suggested to be stem-group squamates, more closely related to modern lizards than rhynchocephalians, however, their position is disputed, with some studies recovering them as less closely related to squamates than rhynchocephalians are. The oldest undisputed lizards date to the Middle Jurassic, from remains found In Europe, Asia and North Africa. Lizard morphological and ecological diversity substantially increased over the course of the Cretaceous. In the Palaeogene, lizard body sizes in North America peaked during the middle of the period.\nMosasaurs likely evolved from an extinct group of aquatic lizards known as aigialosaurs in the Early Cretaceous. Dolichosauridae is a family of Late Cretaceous aquatic varanoid lizards closely related to the mosasaurs.\nPhylogeny.\nExternal.\nThe position of the lizards and other Squamata among the reptiles was studied using fossil evidence by Rainer Schoch and Hans-Dieter Sues in 2015. Lizards form about 60% of the extant non-avian reptiles.\nInternal.\nBoth the snakes and the Amphisbaenia (worm lizards) are clades deep within the Squamata (the smallest clade that contains all the lizards), so \"lizard\" is paraphyletic.\nThe cladogram is based on genomic analysis by Wiens and colleagues in 2012 and 2016. Excluded taxa are shown in upper case on the cladogram.\nTaxonomy.\nIn the 13th century, lizards were recognized in Europe as part of a broad category of \"reptiles\" that consisted of a miscellany of egg-laying creatures, including \"snakes, various fantastic monsters, [\u2026], assorted amphibians, and worms\", as recorded by Vincent of Beauvais in his \"Mirror of Nature\". The seventeenth century saw changes in this loose description. The name Sauria was coined by James Macartney (1802); it was the Latinisation of the French name \"Sauriens\", coined by Alexandre Brongniart (1800) for an order of reptiles in the classification proposed by the author, containing lizards and crocodilians, later discovered not to be each other's closest relatives. Later authors used the term \"Sauria\" in a more restricted sense, i.e. as a synonym of Lacertilia, a suborder of Squamata that includes all lizards but excludes snakes. This classification is rarely used today because Sauria so-defined is a paraphyletic group. It was defined as a clade by Jacques Gauthier, Arnold G. Kluge and Timothy Rowe (1988) as the group containing the most recent common ancestor of archosaurs and lepidosaurs (the groups containing crocodiles and lizards, as per Mcartney's original definition) and all its descendants. A different definition was formulated by Michael deBraga and Olivier Rieppel (1997), who defined Sauria as the clade containing the most recent common ancestor of Choristodera, Archosauromorpha, Lepidosauromorpha and all their descendants. However, these uses have not gained wide acceptance among specialists.\nSuborder Lacertilia (Sauria) \u2013 (lizards) \nConvergence.\nLizards have frequently evolved convergently, with multiple groups independently developing similar morphology and ecological niches. \"Anolis\" ecomorphs have become a model system in evolutionary biology for studying convergence. Limbs have been lost or reduced independently over two dozen times across lizard evolution, including in the Anniellidae, Anguidae, Cordylidae, Dibamidae, Gymnophthalmidae, Pygopodidae, and Scincidae; snakes are just the most famous and species-rich group of Squamata to have followed this path.\nRelationship with humans.\nInteractions and uses by humans.\nMost lizard species are harmless to humans. Only the largest lizard species, the Komodo dragon, which reaches in length and weighs up to , has been known to stalk, attack, and, on occasion, kill humans. An eight-year-old Indonesian boy died from blood loss after an attack in 2007.\nNumerous species of lizard are kept as pets, including bearded dragons, iguanas, anoles, and geckos (such as the popular leopard gecko).Monitor lizards such as the savannah monitor and tegus such as the Argentine tegu and red tegu are also kept.\nGreen iguanas are eaten in Central America, where they are sometimes referred to as \"chicken of the tree\" after their habit of resting in trees and their supposedly chicken-like taste, while spiny-tailed lizards are eaten in Africa. In North Africa, \"Uromastyx\" species are considered \"dhaab\" or 'fish of the desert' and eaten by nomadic tribes.Lizards such as the Gila monster produce toxins with medical applications. Gila toxin reduces plasma glucose; the substance is now synthesized for use in the anti-diabetes drug exenatide (Byetta). Another toxin from Gila monster saliva has been studied for use as an anti-Alzheimer's drug.\nIn culture.\nLizards appear in myths and folktales around the world. In Australian Aboriginal mythology, Tarrotarro, the lizard god, split the human race into male and female, and gave people the ability to express themselves in art. A lizard king named Mo'o features in Hawaii and other cultures in Polynesia. In the Amazon, the lizard is the king of beasts, while among the Bantu of Africa, the god UNkulunkulu sent a chameleon to tell humans they would live forever, but the chameleon was held up, and another lizard brought a different message, that the time of humanity was limited. A popular legend in Maharashtra tells the tale of how a common Indian monitor, with ropes attached, was used to scale the walls of the fort in the Battle of Sinhagad. \nLizards in many cultures share the symbolism of snakes, especially as an emblem of resurrection. This may have derived from their regular molting. The motif of lizards on Christian candle holders probably alludes to the same symbolism. According to Jack Tresidder, in Egypt and the Classical world, they were beneficial emblems, linked with wisdom. In African, Aboriginal and Melanesian folklore they are linked to cultural heroes or ancestral figures.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "18187", "revid": "50717717", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18187", "title": "Book of Leviticus", "text": "Third book of the Bible\nThe Book of Leviticus (, from , ; , , 'And He called'; ) is the third book of the Torah (the Pentateuch) and of the Old Testament, also known as the Third Book of Moses. Many hypotheses presented by scholars as to its origins agree that it developed over a long period of time, reaching its present form during the Persian Period, from 538 to 332 BC, although this is disputed.\nMost of its chapters (1\u20137, 11\u201327) consist of God's speeches to Moses, which he tells Moses to repeat to the Israelites. This takes place within the story of the Israelites' Exodus after they escaped Egypt and reached Mount Sinai (Exodus 19:1). The Book of Exodus narrates how Moses led the Israelites in building the Tabernacle (Exodus 35\u201340) with God's instructions (Exodus 25\u201331). In Leviticus, God tells the Israelites and their priests, Aaron and his sons, how to make offerings in the Tabernacle and how to conduct themselves while camped around the holy tent sanctuary. Leviticus takes place during the month or month-and-a-half between the completion of the Tabernacle (Exodus 40:17) and the Israelites' departure from Sinai (Numbers 1:1, 10:11).\nThe instructions of Leviticus emphasize ritual, legal, and moral practices rather than beliefs. Nevertheless, they reflect the world view of the creation story in Genesis 1 that God wishes to live with humans. The book teaches that faithful performance of the sanctuary rituals can make that possible, so long as the people avoid sin and impurity whenever possible. The rituals, especially the sin and guilt offerings, provide the means to gain forgiveness for sins (Leviticus 4\u20135) and purification from impurities (Leviticus 11\u201316) so that God can continue to live in the Tabernacle in the midst of the people.\nTitle.\nThe English name Leviticus comes from the Latin , which is in turn from the (), referring to the priestly tribe of the Israelites, 'Levi'. The Greek expression is in turn a variant of the rabbinic Hebrew , 'law of priests', as many of its laws relate to priests.\nIn Hebrew the book is called (), from the opening of the book, \"And He [God] called.\"\nStructure.\nThe outlines from commentaries are similar, though not identical; compare those of Wenham, Hartley, Milgrom, and Watts.\nSummary.\nChapters 1\u20135 describe the various sacrifices from the sacrificers' point of view, although the priests are essential for handling the blood. Chapters 6\u20137 go over much the same ground, but from the point of view of the priest, who, as the one actually carrying out the sacrifice and dividing the \"portions\", needs to know how to do it. Sacrifices are between God, the priest, and the offers, although in some cases the entire sacrifice is a single portion to God\u2014i.e., burnt to ashes.\nChapters 8\u201310 describe how Moses consecrates Aaron and his sons as the first priests, the first sacrifices, and God's destruction of two of Aaron's sons for ritual offenses. The purpose is to underline the character of altar priesthood (i.e., those priests with power to offer sacrifices to God) as an Aaronite privilege, and the responsibilities and dangers of their position.\nWith sacrifice and priesthood established, chapters 11\u201315 instruct the lay people on purity (or cleanliness). Eating certain animals produces uncleanliness, as does giving birth; certain skin diseases (but not all) are unclean, as are certain conditions affecting walls and clothing (mildew and similar conditions); and unusual bodily discharges, including female menses and male emissions (gonorrhea), are unclean. The reasoning behind the food rules are obscure; for the rest the guiding principle seems to be that all these conditions involve a loss of \"life force\", usually but not always blood.\nChapter 16 concerns the Day of Atonement (though that phrase appears first in 23:27). This is the only day on which the High Priest is to enter the holiest part of the sanctuary, the holy of holies. He is to sacrifice a bull for the sins of the priests, and a goat for the sins of the laypeople. The priest is to send a second goat into the desert to \"Azazel\", bearing the sins of the whole people. Azazel's identity is unknown, with some Christian tradition linking him to a fallen angel, older English Bible translations like the King James Version translating it as \"a scapegoat\".\nChapters 17\u201326 are the Holiness code. It begins with a prohibition on all unauthorized ritual slaughter of animals, and then prohibits a long list of sexual contacts and also child sacrifice. The \"holiness\" injunctions which give the code its name begin with the next section: there are penalties for the worship of Molech, consulting mediums and wizards, cursing one's parents and engaging in unlawful sex. Priests receive instruction on mourning rituals and acceptable bodily defects. The punishment for blasphemy is death, and there is the setting of rules for eating sacrifices; there is an explanation of the calendar, and there are rules for sabbatical and Jubilee years; there are rules for oil lamps and bread in the sanctuary; and there are rules for slavery. The code ends by telling the Israelites they must choose between the law and prosperity on the one hand, or, on the other, horrible punishments, the worst of which will be expulsion from the land.\nChapter 27 is a disparate and probably late addition telling about persons and things serving as dedication to the Lord and how one can redeem, instead of fulfill, vows.\nComposition.\nThe majority of scholars have concluded that the Pentateuch received its final form during the Persian period (538\u2013332\u00a0BC). Nevertheless, Leviticus had a long period of growth before reaching that form.\nThe entire composition of the book of Leviticus is Priestly literature. Most scholars see chapters 1\u201316 (the Priestly code) and chapters 17\u201326 (the Holiness code) as the work of two related schools, but while the Holiness material employs the same technical terms as the Priestly code, it broadens their meaning from pure ritual to the theological and moral, turning the ritual of the Priestly code into a model for the relationship of Israel to Yahweh: as the tabernacle, which is apart from uncleanliness, becomes holy by the presence of Yahweh, so he will dwell among Israel when Israel receives purification (becomes holy) and separates from other peoples. The ritual instructions in the Priestly code apparently grew from priests giving instruction and answering questions about ritual matters; the Holiness code (or H) used to be a separate document, later becoming part of Leviticus, but it seems better to think of the Holiness authors as editors who worked with the Priestly code and actually produced Leviticus as is now extant.\nThemes.\nSacrifice and ritual.\nMany scholars argue that the rituals of Leviticus have a theological meaning concerning Israel's relationship with its God. Jacob Milgrom was especially influential in spreading this view. He maintained that the priestly regulations in Leviticus expressed a rational system of theological thought. The writers expected them to be put into practice in Israel's temple, so the rituals would express this theology as well, as well as ethical concern for the poor. Milgrom also argued that the book's purity regulations (chapters 11\u201315) have a basis in ethical thinking. Many other interpreters have followed Milgrom in exploring the theological and ethical implications of Leviticus's regulations (e.g., Marx, Balentine), though some have questioned how systematic they really are. Ritual, therefore, is not taking a series of actions for their own sake, but a means of maintaining the relationship between God, humanity, and the world.\nKehuna (Jewish priesthood).\nThe main function of the priests is service at the altar, and only the sons of Aaron are priests in the full sense. (Ezekiel also distinguishes between altar-priests and lower Levites, but in Ezekiel the altar-priests are sons of Zadok instead of sons of Aaron; many scholars see this as a remnant of struggles between different priestly factions in First Temple times, finding resolution by the Second Temple into a hierarchy of Aaronite altar-priests and lower-level Levites, including singers, gatekeepers and the like.)\nIn chapter 10, God kills Nadab and Abihu, the oldest sons of Aaron, for offering \"strange incense\". Aaron has two sons left. Commentators have read various messages in the incident: a reflection of struggles between priestly factions in the post-Exilic period (Gerstenberger); or a warning against offering incense outside the Temple, where there might be the risk of invoking strange gods (Milgrom). In any case, there has been a pollution of the sanctuary by the bodies of the two dead priests, leading into the next theme, holiness.\nUncleanliness and purity.\nRitual purity is essential for an Israelite to be able to approach Yahweh and remain part of the community. Uncleanliness threatens holiness; chapters 11\u201315 review the various causes of uncleanliness and describe the rituals which will restore cleanliness; one is to maintain cleanliness through observation of the rules on sexual behaviour, family relations, land ownership, worship, sacrifice, and observance of holy days.\nYahweh dwells with Israel in the Tabernacle. All of the priestly ritual focuses on Yahweh and the construction and maintenance of a holy space, but sin generates impurity, as do everyday events such as childbirth and menstruation; impurity pollutes the holy dwelling place. Failure to purify the sacred space ritually could result in God's leaving, which would be disastrous.\nInfectious diseases in chapter 13.\nIn chapter 13, God instructs Moses and Aaron on how to identify infectious diseases and deal with them accordingly. The translators and interpreters of the Hebrew Bible in various languages have never reached a consensus on these infectious diseases, or (), and the translation and interpretation of the scriptures are not known for certain. The most common translation is that these infectious diseases are leprosy; however, what is described in chapter 13 does not represent a typical manifestation of leprosy. Modern dermatology shows that many of the infectious diseases in chapter 13 were likely dermatophytoses, a group of highly contagious skin diseases.\nThe infectious disease of the chin described in verses 29\u201337 seems to be Tinea barbae in men or Tinea faciei in women; the infectious disease described in verses 29\u201337 (as resulting in hair loss and eventual baldness) seems to be Tinea capitis (Favus). Verses 1\u201317 seem to describe Tinea corporis.\nThe Hebrew word in verses 38\u201339 is translated as 'tetter' or 'freckles', likely because translators did not know what it meant at the time, and thus, translated it incorrectly. Later translations identify it as talking about vitiligo; however, vitiligo is not an infectious disease. The disease, described as healing itself and leaving white patches after infection, is likely to be pityriasis versicolor (tinea versicolor). \"Tetter\" originally referred to an outbreak, which later evolved meaning ringworm-like lesions. Therefore, a common name for Tinea pedis (athlete's foot) was Cantlie's foot tetter. In addition, verses 18\u201323 describe infections after scald, and verses 24\u201328 describe infections after burn.\nAtonement.\nThrough sacrifice, the priest \"makes atonement\" for sin and the offeror receives forgiveness (but only if Yahweh accepts the sacrifice). Atonement rituals involve the pouring or sprinkling of blood as the symbol of the life of the victim: the blood has the power to wipe out or absorb the sin. The two-part division of the book structurally reflects the role of atonement: chapters 1\u201316 call for the establishment of the institution for atonement, and chapters 17\u201327 call for the life of the atoned community in holiness.\nHoliness.\nThe consistent theme of chapters 17\u201326 is in the repetition of the phrase, \"Be holy, for I the Lord your God am holy.\" Holiness in ancient Israel and the Hebrew Bible had a different meaning than in contemporary usage: it might have been regarded as the essence of Yahweh, an invisible but physical and potentially dangerous force. Specific objects, or even days, can be holy, but they derive holiness from being connected with Yahweh\u2014the seventh day, the tabernacle, and the priests all derive their holiness from him. As a result, Israel had to maintain its own holiness in order to live safely alongside God.\nThe need for holiness is for the possession of the Promised Land (Canaan), where the Jews will become a holy people: \"You shall not do as they do in the land of Egypt where you dwelt, and you shall not do as they do in the land of Canaan to which I am bringing you[...] You shall do my ordinances and keep my statutes[...] I am the Lord, your God.\" (Leviticus 18:3).\nSubsequent tradition.\nLeviticus, as part of the Torah, became the law book of Jerusalem's Second Temple as well as of the Samaritan temple. Its influence is evident among the Dead Sea Scrolls, which included fragments of seventeen manuscripts of Leviticus dating from the 3rd to the 1st centuries BC. Many other Qumran scrolls cite the book, especially the Temple Scroll and 4QMMT.\nJews and Christians have not observed Leviticus's instructions for animal offerings since the 1st century AD, following the destruction of the Second Temple in Jerusalem in 70 AD. As there was no longer a Temple at which to offer animal sacrifices, Judaism pivoted towards prayer and the study of the Torah, eventually giving rise to Rabbinic Judaism. Nevertheless, Leviticus constitutes a major source of Jewish law and is traditionally the first book children learn in the Rabbinic system of education. There are two main Midrashim on Leviticus\u2014the halakhic one (Sifra) and a more aggadic one (Vayikra Rabbah).\nThe New Testament, particularly the Epistle to the Hebrews, uses ideas and images from Leviticus to describe Jesus as the high priest who offers his own blood as a sin offering. Therefore, Christians do not make animal offerings either, because as Gordon Wenham summarized: \"With the death of Christ the only sufficient 'burnt offering' was offered once and for all, and therefore the animal sacrifices which foreshadowed Christ's sacrifice were made obsolete.\"\nChristians generally have the view that the New Covenant supersedes the Old Testament's ritual laws, which includes some of the rules in Leviticus. Christians, therefore, do not usually follow Leviticus' rules regarding diet purity, and agriculture. Christian teachings have differed, however, as to where to draw the line between ritual and moral regulations. In \"Homilies on Leviticus\", the third century theologian, Origen, expounded on the qualities of priests as models for Christians to be perfect in everything, strict, wise and to examine themselves individually, forgive sins, and convert sinners (by words and by doctrine).\nJudaism's weekly Torah portions in the Book of Leviticus.\nFor detailed contents, see:\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nExternal links.\nOnline versions of Leviticus:\nRelated article:\nBrief introduction"}

Frank Baum", "text": "American author (1856\u20131919)\nLyman Frank Baum (; May 15, 1856 \u2013 May 6, 1919) was an American author best known for his children's fantasy books, particularly \"The Wonderful Wizard of Oz\", part of a series. In addition to the 14 \"Oz\" books, Baum penned 41 other novels (not including four lost, unpublished novels), 83 short stories, over 200 poems, and at least 42 scripts. He made numerous attempts to bring his works to the stage and screen; the 1939 adaptation of the first \"Oz\" book became a landmark of 20th-century cinema.\nBorn and raised in Chittenango, New York, Baum moved west after an unsuccessful stint as a theater producer and playwright. He and his wife opened a store in South Dakota and he edited and published a newspaper. They then moved to Chicago, where he worked as a newspaper reporter and published children's literature, coming out with the first \"Oz\" book in 1900. While continuing his writing, among his final projects he sought to establish a film studio in Los Angeles, California.\nHis works anticipated such later commonplace things as television, augmented reality, laptop computers (\"The Master Key\"), wireless telephones (\"Tik-Tok of Oz\"), women in high-risk and action-heavy occupations (\"Mary Louise in the Country\"), and the ubiquity of advertising on clothing (\"Aunt Jane's Nieces at Work\").\nChildhood and early life.\nBaum was born in Chittenango, New York, in 1856 into a devout Methodist family. He had German, Scots-Irish, and English ancestry. He was the seventh of nine children of Cynthia Ann (n\u00e9e Stanton) and Benjamin Ward Baum, only five of whom survived into adulthood. \"Lyman\" was the name of his father's brother (Lyman Spaulding Baum), but he always disliked it and preferred his middle name \"Frank\".\nHis father succeeded in many businesses, including barrel-making, oil drilling in Pennsylvania, and real estate. Baum grew up on his parents' expansive estate called Rose Lawn, which he fondly recalled as a sort of paradise. Rose Lawn was located in Mattydale, New York. Baum was a sickly, dreamy child, tutored at home with his siblings. From the age of 12, he spent two years at Peekskill Military Academy but, after being severely disciplined for daydreaming, he had a possibly psychogenic heart attack and was allowed to return home.\nBaum started writing early in life, possibly prompted by his father buying him a cheap printing press. He had always been close to his younger brother Henry (Harry) Clay Baum, who helped in the production of \"The Rose Lawn Home Journal\". The brothers published several issues of the journal, including advertisements from local businesses, which they gave to family and friends for free. By the age of 17, Baum established a second amateur journal called \"The Stamp Collector\", printed an 11-page pamphlet called \"Baum's Complete Stamp Dealers' Directory\", and started a stamp dealership with friends.\nAt 20, Baum took on the national craze of breeding poultry. He specialized in raising the Hamburg chicken. In March 1880, he established a monthly trade journal, \"The Poultry Record\" and, in 1886, when Baum was 30 years old, his first book was published: \"The Book of the Hamburgs: A Brief Treatise upon the Mating, Rearing, and Management of the Different Varieties of Hamburgs\".\nBaum had a flair for being the spotlight of fun in the household, including during times of financial difficulties. His selling of fireworks made the Fourth of July memorable. His skyrockets, Roman candles, and fireworks filled the sky, while many people around the neighborhood would gather in front of the house to watch the displays. Christmas was even more festive. Baum dressed as Santa Claus for the family. His father would place the Christmas tree behind a curtain in the front parlor so that Baum could talk to everyone while he decorated the tree without people managing to see him. He maintained this tradition all his life.\nCareer.\nTheater.\nBaum embarked on his lifetime infatuation\u2014and wavering financial success\u2014with the theater. A local theatrical company duped him into replenishing their stock of costumes on the promise of leading roles coming his way. Disillusioned, Baum left the theater\u2014temporarily\u2014and went to work as a clerk in his brother-in-law's dry goods company in Syracuse. This experience may have influenced his story \"The Suicide of Kiaros\", first published in the literary journal \"The White Elephant\". A fellow clerk one day had been found locked in a store room dead, probably from suicide.\nBaum could never stay away long from the stage. He performed in plays under the stage names of Louis F. Baum and George Brooks. In 1880, his father built him a theater in Richburg, New York, and Baum set about writing plays and gathering a company to act in them. \"The Maid of Arran\" proved a modest success, a melodrama with songs based on William Black's novel \"A Princess of Thule\". Baum wrote the play and composed songs for it (making it a prototypical musical, as its songs relate to the narrative), and acted in the leading role. His aunt Katharine Gray played his character's aunt. She was the founder of Syracuse Oratory School, and Baum advertised his services in her catalog to teach theater, including stage business, play writing, directing, translating (French, German, and Italian), revision, and operettas.\nOn November 9, 1882, Baum married Maud Gage, a daughter of Matilda Joslyn Gage, a famous women's suffrage and feminist activist. A local newspaper reported that their ceremony was \"one of equality\" and that their marriage vows were \"precisely the same.\" While Baum was touring with \"The Maid of Arran\", the theater in Richburg caught fire during a production of Baum's ironically titled parlor drama \"Matches\", destroying the theater as well as the only known copies of many of Baum's scripts, including \"Matches\", as well as costumes.\nThe South Dakota years.\nIn July 1888, Baum and his wife moved to Aberdeen, Dakota Territory where he opened a store called \"Baum's Bazaar\". His habit of giving out wares on credit led to the eventual bankrupting of the store, so Baum turned to editing the local newspaper \"The Aberdeen Saturday Pioneer\" where he wrote the column \"Our Landlady\". Following the death of Sitting Bull at the hands of Indian agency police, Baum recommended the wholesale extermination of all America's native peoples in a column that he wrote on December 20, 1890 (full text below). It is unclear whether Baum meant it as a satire or not, especially since his mother-in-law Matilda Joslyn Gage received an honorary adoption into the Wolf Clan of the Mohawk Nation and was a fierce defender of Native American rights, but on January 3, 1891, he returned to the subject in an editorial response to the Wounded Knee Massacre:\nThe Pioneer has before declared that our only safety depends upon the total extirmination [\"sic\"] of the Indians. Having wronged them for centuries, we had better, in order to protect our civilization, follow it up by one more wrong and wipe these untamed and untamable creatures from the face of the earth.\nBaum's description of Kansas in \"The Wonderful Wizard of Oz\" is based on his experiences in drought-ridden South Dakota. During much of this time, his mother-in-law was living in the Baum household. While Baum was in South Dakota, he sang in a quartet which included James Kyle, who became one of the first Populist (People's Party) senators in the U.S.\nWriting.\nBaum's newspaper failed in 1891, and he, Maud, and their four sons moved to the Humboldt Park section of Chicago, where Baum took a job reporting for the \"Evening Post\". \nBeginning in 1897, he founded and edited a magazine called \"The Show Window\", later known as the \"Merchants Record and Show Window\", which focused on store window displays, retail strategies and visual merchandising. The major department stores of the time created elaborate Christmas time fantasies, using clockwork mechanisms that made people and animals appear to move. The former \"Show Window\" magazine is still currently in operation, now known as \"VMSD\" magazine (visual merchandising + store design), based in Cincinnati. \nIn 1900, Baum published a book about window displays in which he stressed the importance of mannequins in drawing customers. He also had to work as a traveling salesman.\nIn 1897, he wrote and published \"Mother Goose in Prose\", a collection of Mother Goose rhymes written as prose stories and illustrated by Maxfield Parrish. \"Mother Goose\" was a moderate success and allowed Baum to quit his sales job (which had had a negative impact on his health). In 1899, Baum partnered with illustrator W. W. Denslow to publish \"Father Goose, His Book\", a collection of nonsense poetry. The book was a success, becoming the best-selling children's book of the year.\n\"The Wonderful Wizard of Oz\".\nIn 1900, Baum and Denslow (with whom he shared the copyright) published \"The Wonderful Wizard of Oz\" to much critical acclaim and financial success. The book was the best-selling children's book for two years after its initial publication. Baum went on to write thirteen more novels based on the places and people of the Land of Oz.\n\"The Wizard of Oz: Fred R. Hamlin's Musical Extravaganza\".\nTwo years after \"Wizard\"'s publication, Baum and Denslow teamed up with composer Paul Tietjens and director Julian Mitchell to produce a musical stage version of the book under Fred R. Hamlin. Baum and Tietjens had worked on a musical of \"The Wonderful Wizard of Oz\" in 1901 and based closely upon the book, but it was rejected. This stage version opened in Chicago in 1902 (the first to use the shortened title \"The Wizard of Oz\"), then ran on Broadway for 293 stage nights from January to October 1903. It returned to Broadway in 1904, where it played from March to May and again from November to December. It successfully toured the United States with much of the same cast, as was done in those days, until 1911, and then became available for amateur use. The stage version starred Anna Laughlin as Dorothy Gale, alongside David C. Montgomery and Fred Stone as the Tin Woodman and Scarecrow respectively, which shot the pair to instant fame.\nThe stage version differed quite a bit from the book, and it was aimed primarily at adults. Toto was replaced with Imogene the Cow, and Tryxie Tryfle (a waitress) and Pastoria (a streetcar operator) were added as fellow cyclone victims. The Wicked Witch of the West was eliminated entirely in the script, and the plot became about how the four friends were allied with the usurping Wizard and were hunted as traitors to Pastoria II, the rightful King of Oz. It is unclear how much control or influence Baum had on the script; it appears that many of the changes were written by Baum against his wishes due to contractual requirements with Hamlin. Jokes in the script, mostly written by Glen MacDonough, called for explicit references to President Theodore Roosevelt, Senator Mark Hanna, Rev. Andrew Danquer, and oil tycoon John D. Rockefeller. Although use of the script was rather free-form, the line about Hanna was ordered dropped as soon as Hamlin got word of his death in 1904.\nBeginning with the success of the stage version, most subsequent versions of the story, including newer editions of the novel, have been titled \"The Wizard of Oz\", rather than using the full, original title. In more recent years, restoring the full title has become increasingly common, particularly to distinguish the novel from the Hollywood film.\nBaum wrote a new Oz book, \"The Marvelous Land of Oz\", with a view to making it into a stage production, which was titled \"The Woggle-Bug\", but Montgomery and Stone balked at appearing when the original was still running. The Scarecrow and Tin Woodman were then omitted from this adaptation, which was seen as a self-rip-off by critics and proved to be a major flop before it could reach Broadway. He also worked for years on a musical version of \"Ozma of Oz\", which eventually became \"The Tik-Tok Man of Oz\". This did fairly well in Los Angeles but not well enough to convince producer Oliver Morosco to mount a production in New York. He also began a stage version of \"The Patchwork Girl of Oz\", but this was ultimately realized as a film.\nLater life and work.\nWith the success of \"Wizard\" on page and stage, Baum and Denslow hoped for further success and published \"Dot and Tot of Merryland\" in 1901. The book was one of Baum's weakest, and its failure further strained his faltering relationship with Denslow. It was their last collaboration. Baum worked primarily with John R. Neill on his fantasy work beginning in 1904, but Baum met Neill few times (all before he moved to California) and often found Neill's art not humorous enough for his liking. He was particularly offended when Neill published \"The Oz Toy Book: Cut-outs for the Kiddies\" without authorization.\nBaum reportedly designed the chandeliers in the Crown Room of the Hotel del Coronado; however, that attribution has yet to be corroborated. Several times during the development of the Oz series, Baum declared that he had written his last Oz book and devoted himself to other works of fantasy fiction based in other magical lands, including \"The Life and Adventures of Santa Claus\" and \"Queen Zixi of Ix\". However, he returned to the series each time, persuaded by popular demand, letters from children, and the failure of his new books. Even so, his other works remained very popular after his death, with \"The Master Key\" appearing on \"St. Nicholas Magazine\"'s survey of readers' favorite books well into the 1920s.\nIn 1905, Baum declared plans for an Oz amusement park. In an interview, he mentioned buying \"Pedloe Island\" off the coast of California to turn it into an Oz park. However, there is no evidence that he purchased such an island, and no one has ever been able to find any island whose name even resembles Pedloe in that area. Nevertheless, Baum stated to the press that he had discovered a Pedloe Island off the coast of California and that he had purchased it to be \"the Marvelous Land of Oz,\" intending it to be \"a fairy paradise for children.\" Eleven-year-old Dorothy Talbot of San Francisco was reported to be ascendant to the throne on March 1, 1906, when the Palace of Oz was expected to be completed. Baum planned to live on the island, with administrative duties handled by the princess and her all-child advisers. Plans included statues of the Scarecrow, Tin Woodman, Jack Pumpkinhead, and H.M. Woggle-Bug, T.E. Baum abandoned his Oz park project after the failure of \"The Woggle-Bug\", which was playing at the Garrick Theatre in 1905.\nBecause of his lifelong love of theatre, he financed elaborate musicals, often to his financial detriment. One of Baum's worst financial endeavors was his \"The Fairylogue and Radio-Plays\" (1908), which combined a slideshow, film, and live actors with a lecture by Baum as if he were giving a travelogue to Oz. However, Baum ran into trouble and could not pay his debts to the company who produced the films. He did not get back to a stable financial situation for several years, after he sold the royalty rights to many of his earlier works, including \"The Wonderful Wizard of Oz\". This resulted in the M.A. Donahue Company publishing cheap editions of his early works with advertising which purported that Baum's newer output was inferior to the less expensive books that they were releasing. He claimed bankruptcy in August 1911. However, Baum had shrewdly transferred most of his property into Maud's name, except for his clothing, his typewriter, and his library (mostly of children's books, such as the fairy tales of Andrew Lang, whose portrait he kept in his study)\u2014all of which, he successfully argued, were essential to his occupation. Maud handled the finances anyway, and thus Baum lost much less than he could have.\nBaum made use of several pseudonyms for some of his other non-Oz books. They include:\nBaum also anonymously wrote \"The Last Egyptian: A Romance of the Nile\". He continued theatrical work with Harry Marston Haldeman's men's social group The Uplifters, for which he wrote several plays for various celebrations. He also wrote the group's parodic by-laws. The group also included Will Rogers, but it was proud to have had Baum as a member and posthumously revived many of his works despite their ephemeral intent. Many of these play's titles are known, but only \"The Uplift of Lucifer\" is known to survive (it was published in a limited edition in the 1960s). Prior to that, his last produced play was \"The Tik-Tok Man of Oz\" (based on \"Ozma of Oz\" and the basis for \"Tik-Tok of Oz\"), a modest success in Hollywood that producer Oliver Morosco decided did not do well enough to take to Broadway. Morosco, incidentally, quickly turned to film production, as did Baum.\nIn 1914, Baum started his own film production company The Oz Film Manufacturing Company, which came as an outgrowth of the Uplifters. He served as its president and principal producer and screenwriter. The rest of the board consisted of Louis F. Gottschalk, Harry Marston Haldeman, and Clarence R. Rundel. The films were directed by J. Farrell MacDonald, with casts that included Violet MacMillan, Vivian Reed, Mildred Harris, Juanita Hansen, Pierre Couderc, Mai Welles, Louise Emmons, J. Charles Haydon, and early appearances by Harold Lloyd and Hal Roach. Silent film actor Richard Rosson appeared in one of the films (Rosson's younger brother Harold Rosson was the cinematographer on \"The Wizard of Oz\", released in 1939). After little success probing the unrealized children's film market, Baum acknowledged his authorship of \"The Last Egyptian\" and made a film of it (portions of which are included in \"Decasia\"), but the Oz name had become box office poison for the time being, and even a name change to Dramatic Feature Films and transfer of ownership to Frank Joslyn Baum did not help. Baum invested none of his own money in the venture, unlike \"The Fairylogue and Radio-Plays\", but the stress probably took its toll on his health.\nPersonal life and death.\nOn May 5, 1919, Baum suffered a stroke, slipped into a coma and died the following day, nine days before his 63rd birthday. His last words were spoken to his wife during a brief period of lucidity: \"Now we can cross the Shifting Sands.\" He was buried in Glendale's Forest Lawn Memorial Park Cemetery.\nHis final Oz book, \"Glinda of Oz\", was published on July 10, 1920, a year after his death. The Oz series was continued long after his death by other authors, notably Ruth Plumly Thompson, who wrote an additional twenty-one Oz books.\nBaum's beliefs.\nPolitical.\nRacial views.\nDuring the period of the 1890 Ghost Dance movement and Wounded Knee Massacre, Baum wrote two editorials asserting that the safety of American settlers depended on the wholesale genocide of Native Americans. These editorials were republished in 1990 by sociologist Robert Venables of Cornell University, who argues that Baum was not using sarcasm. Historian Camilla Townsend, the editor of \"American Indian History: A Documentary Reader\", argued that the editorial was \"[a]gainst character\", as he had earlier published a piece that criticized the idea of White Americans fearing Native Americans; Townsend stated that she failed to find evidence that Baum was using sarcasm.\nThe first piece was published on December 20, 1890, five days after the killing of the Lakota Sioux holy man Sitting Bull. The piece opined that with Sitting Bull's death, \"the nobility of the Redskin\" had been extinguished, and the safety of the frontier would not be established until there was \"total annihilation\" of the remaining Native Americans, who, he claimed, lived as \"miserable wretches.\" Baum said that their extermination should not be regretted, and their elimination would \"do justice to the manly characteristics\" of their ancestors.\nThe Wounded Knee Massacre occurred nine days later; the second editorial was published on January 3, 1891. Baum alleged that General Nelson A. Miles' weak rule on the Native Americans had caused American soldiers to suffer a \"terrible loss of blood\", in a \"battle\" which had been a disgrace to the Department of War. He found that the \"disaster\" could have easily been prevented with proper preparations. Baum reiterated that he believed, due to the history of mistreatment of Native Americans, that the extermination of the \"untamed and untamable\" tribes was necessary to protect American settlers. Baum ended the editorial with the following anecdote: \"An eastern contemporary, with a grain of wisdom in its wit, says that 'when the whites win a fight, it is a victory, and when the Indians win it, it is a massacre.'\"\nIn 2006, two descendants of Baum apologized to the Sioux nation for any hurt that their ancestor had caused.\nThe short story \"The Enchanted Buffalo\" claims to be a legend about a tribe of bison, and it states that a key element of it made it into the legends of Native American tribes. Baum mentions his characters' distaste for a Hopi snake dance in \"Aunt Jane's Nieces and Uncle John\", but he also deplores the horrible situation which exists on Native American reservations. \"Aunt Jane's Nieces on the Ranch\" features a hard-working Mexican in order to disprove Anglo-American stereotypes which portray Mexicans as lazy. Baum's mother-in-law and woman's suffrage leader Matilda Joslyn Gage strongly influenced his views. Gage was initiated into the Wolf Clan and admitted into the Iroquois Council of Matrons in recognition of her outspoken respect and sympathy for the Native American people.\nWomen's suffrage advocate.\nWhen Baum lived in Aberdeen, South Dakota, where he was secretary of its Equal Suffrage Club, much of the politics in the Republican \"Aberdeen Saturday Pioneer\" dealt with trying to convince the populace to vote for women's suffrage. Susan B. Anthony visited Aberdeen and stayed with the Baums. Nancy Tystad Koupal notes an apparent loss of interest in editorializing after Aberdeen failed to pass the bill for women's enfranchisement.\nSally Roesch Wagner of The Matilda Joslyn Gage Foundation published \"The Wonderful Mother of Oz\", describing how Matilda Gage's feminist politics were sympathetically channeled by Baum into his Oz books. Some of Baum's contacts with suffragists of his day seem to have inspired much of \"The Marvelous Land of Oz\". In this story, General Jinjur leads the girls and women of Oz in a revolt, armed with knitting needles; they succeed and make the men do the household chores. Jinjur proves to be an incompetent ruler, but Princess Ozma, who advocates gender equality, is ultimately placed on the throne. Charlotte Perkins Gilman's 1915 classic of feminist science fiction, \"Herland\", bears strong similarities to \"The Emerald City of Oz\" (1910); the link between Baum and Gilman is considered to be Gage. Baum's stories outside of Oz also contain feminist or egalitarian themes. His Edith Van Dyne stories depict girls and young women engaging in traditionally masculine activities, including \"Aunt Jane's Nieces\" and \"The Flying Girl\" and its sequel. The Bluebird Books feature a girl sleuth.\nPolitical imagery in \"The Wizard of Oz\".\nNumerous political references to the \"Wizard\" appeared early in the 20th century. Henry Littlefield, an upstate New York high school history teacher, wrote a scholarly article in 1964, the first full-fledged interpretation of the novel as an extended metaphor of the politics and characters of the 1890s. He paid special attention to the Populist metaphors and debates over silver and gold. He published a poem in support of William McKinley.\nSince 1964, many scholars, economists, and historians have expanded on Littlefield's interpretation, pointing to multiple similarities between the characters (especially as depicted in Denslow's illustrations) and stock figures from editorial cartoons of the period. Littlefield wrote to \"The New York Times\" letters to the editor section spelling out that his theory had no basis in fact, but that his original point was \"not to label Baum, or to lessen any of his magic, but rather, as a history teacher at Mount Vernon High School, to invest turn-of-the-century America with the imagery and wonder I have always found in his stories.\"\nBaum's newspaper had addressed politics in the 1890s, and Denslow was an editorial cartoonist as well as an illustrator of children's books. A series of political references is included in the 1902 stage version, such as references to the President, to a powerful senator, and to John D. Rockefeller for providing the oil needed by the Tin Woodman. Scholars have found few political references in Baum's Oz books after 1902. Baum was asked whether his stories had hidden meanings, but he always replied that they were written to \"please children\".\nLiterary.\nBaum's avowed intentions with the Oz books and his other fairy tales was to retell tales such as those which are found in the works of the Brothers Grimm and Hans Christian Andersen, remake them in an American vein, update them, omit stereotypical characters such as dwarfs or genies, and remove the association of violence and moral teachings. His first Oz books contained a fair amount of violence, but the amount of it decreased as the series progressed; in \"The Emerald City of Oz\", Ozma objects to the use of violence, even to the use of violence against the Nomes who threaten Oz with invasion. His introduction is often cited as the beginning of the sanitization of children's stories, although he did not do a great deal more than eliminate harsh moral lessons.\nAnother traditional element that Baum intentionally omitted was the emphasis on romance. He considered romantic love to be uninteresting to young children, as well as largely incomprehensible. In \"The Wonderful Wizard of Oz\", the only elements of romance lay in the background of the Tin Woodman and his love for Nimmie Amee, which explains his condition but does not affect the tale in any other way, and the background of Gayelette and the enchantment of the winged monkeys. The only other stories with such elements were \"The Scarecrow of Oz\" and \"Tik-Tok of Oz\"; both of them were based on dramatizations, which Baum regarded warily until his readers accepted them.\nReligion.\nBaum was originally a Methodist, but he joined the Episcopal Church in Aberdeen in order to participate in community theatricals. Later, he and his wife were encouraged to become members of the Theosophical Society in 1892 by Matilda Joslyn Gage. Baum's beliefs are frequently reflected in his writings; however, the only mention of a church in his Oz books is the porcelain one which the Cowardly Lion breaks in the Dainty China Country in \"The Wonderful Wizard of Oz\". The Baums sent their older sons to \"Ethical Culture Sunday School\" in Chicago, which taught morality, not religion.\nWriters including Evan I. Schwartz among others have suggested that Baum intentionally used allegory and symbolism in \"The Wonderful Wizard of Oz\" to convey concepts that are central to spiritual teachings such as Theosophy and Buddhism. They postulate that the main characters' experiences in Oz represent the soul's journey toward enlightenment. Schwartz specifically states that key plot elements of the book take \"the reader on a journey guided by Eastern philosophy\" (Schwartz, p.\u00a0265). An article in BBC Culture lists several allegorical interpretations of the book including that it may be viewed as a parable of Theosophy. The article cites various symbols and their possible meanings, for example the Yellow Brick Road representing the 'Golden Path' in Buddhism, along which the soul travels to a state of spiritual realization.\nBaum's own writing suggests he believed the story may have been divinely inspired: \"It was pure inspiration. It came to me right out of the blue. I think that sometimes the Great Author had a message to get across and He was to use the instrument at hand\".\nWorks.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nLand of Oz works.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\n1921's \"The Royal Book of Oz\" was posthumously attributed to Baum but was entirely the work of Ruth Plumly Thompson.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nExternal links.\nWorks\nPapers\nMetadata\nFan sites"}
{"id": "18189", "revid": "43507737", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18189", "title": "Lake Ladoga", "text": "Lake in Leningrad, Russia\nLake Ladoga is a freshwater lake located in the Republic of Karelia and Leningrad Oblast in northwestern Russia, in the vicinity of Saint Petersburg.\nIt is the largest lake located entirely in Europe, the second largest lake in Russia after Lake Baikal, and the 14th largest lake by area in the world. It is comparable in size to Lake Ontario. \"Ladoga Lacus\", a methane lake on Saturn's moon Titan, is named after the lake.\nEtymology.\nIn one of Nestor's chronicles from the 12th century a lake called \"the Great Nevo\" is mentioned, a clear link to the Neva River and possibly further to Finnish \"nevo\" 'sea' or \"neva\" 'bog, quagmire'.\nAncient Norse sagas and Hanseatic treaties both mention a city made of lakes named Old Norse \"Aldeigja\" or \"Aldoga\". Since the beginning of the 14th century this hydronym was commonly known as \"Ladoga\". According to T. N. Jackson, it can be taken \"almost for granted that the name of Ladoga first referred to the river, then the city, and only then the lake\". Therefore, he considers the primary hydronym Ladoga to originate in the eponymous inflow to the lower reaches of the Volkhov River whose early Finnic name was \"Alodejoki\" (corresponding to modern ) 'river of the lowlands'.\nThe Germanic toponym (\"Aldeigja\" ~ \"Aldoga\") was soon borrowed by the Slavic population and transformed by means of the Old East Slavic metathesis \"ald- \u2192 lad-\" to . The Old Norse intermediary word between Finnish and Old East Slavic word is fully supported by archeology, since the Scandinavians first appeared in Ladoga in the early 750s, that is, a couple of decades before the Slavs.\nOther hypotheses about the origin of the name derive it from 'wave' and 'wavy', or from the Russian dialectal word \u0430\u043b\u043e\u0434\u044c, meaning 'open lake, extensive water field'. Eugene Helimski by contrast, offers a Germanic etymology. In his opinion, the primary name of the lake was 'old source', associated to the open sea, in contrast to the name of the Neva River (flowing from Lake Ladoga) which would derive from the Germanic expression for 'the new'. Through the intermediate form \"*Aldaugja\", came about, referring to the city of Ladoga.\nGeography.\nThe lake has an average surface area of 17,891\u00a0km2 (excluding the islands), slightly larger than Kuwait. Its north-to-south length is 219\u00a0km and its average width is 83\u00a0km; the average depth is 47\u00a0m, although it reaches a maximum of 230\u00a0m in the north-western part. Basin area: 276,000\u00a0km2, volume: 837\u00a0km3 (earlier estimated as 908\u00a0km3). There are around 660 islands, with a total area of about 435\u00a0km2. Ladoga is, on average, 5\u00a0m above sea level. Most of the islands, including the famous Valaam archipelago, Kilpola and Konevets, are situated in the northwest of the lake.\nSeparated from the Baltic Sea by the Karelian Isthmus, it drains into the Gulf of Finland via the Neva River.\nLake Ladoga is navigable, being a part of the Volga\u2013Baltic Waterway connecting the Baltic Sea with the Volga River. The Ladoga Canal bypasses the lake in the south, connecting the Neva to the Svir.\nThe basin of Lake Ladoga includes about 50,000 lakes and 3,500 rivers longer than 10\u00a0km. About 85% of the water inflow is due to tributaries, 13% is due to precipitation, and 2% is due to underground waters.\nGeological history.\nGeologically, the Lake Ladoga depression is a graben and syncline structure of Proterozoic age (Precambrian). This \"Ladoga\u2013Pasha structure\", as it is known, hosts Jotnian sediments. During the Pleistocene glaciations the depression was partially stripped of its sedimentary rock fill by glacial overdeepening. During the Last Interglacial (Eemian), around 130-115,000 years ago, the lake formed part of marine channel between the Baltic and White Seas.\nDuring the Last Glacial Maximum, about 17,000 years BP, the lake served likely as a channel that concentrated ice of the Fennoscandian Ice Sheet into an ice stream that fed glacier lobes further east.\nDeglaciation following the Weichselian glaciation took place in the Lake Ladoga basin between 12,500 and 11,500 radiocarbon years BP. Lake Ladoga was initially part of the Baltic Ice Lake (70\u201380 m. above present sea level), a historical freshwater stage of Baltic Sea. It is possible, though not certain, that Ladoga was isolated from it during regression of the subsequent Yoldia Sea brackish stage (10,200\u20139,500 BP). The isolation threshold should be at Heinjoki to the east of Vyborg, where the Baltic Sea and Ladoga were connected by a strait or a river outlet at least until the formation of the River Neva, and possibly even much later, until the 12th century AD or so.\nAt 9,500 BP, Lake Onega, previously draining into the White Sea, started emptying into Ladoga via the River Svir. Between 9,500 and 9,100 BP, during the transgression of Ancylus Lake, the next freshwater stage of the Baltic, Ladoga certainly became part of it, even if they hadn't been connected immediately before. During the Ancylus Lake subsequent regression, around 8,800 BP Ladoga became isolated.\nLadoga slowly transgressed in its southern part due to uplift of the Baltic Shield in the north. It has been hypothesized, but not proven, that waters of the Litorina Sea, the next brackish-water stage of the Baltic, occasionally invaded Ladoga between 7,000 and 5,000 BP. Around 5,000 BP the waters of the Saimaa Lake penetrated Salpausselk\u00e4 and formed a new outlet, River Vuoksi, entering Lake Ladoga in the northwestern corner and raising its level by 1\u20132 m.\nThe River Neva originated when the Ladoga waters at last broke through the threshold at Porogi into the lower portions of Izhora River, then a tributary of the Gulf of Finland, between 4,000 and 2,000 BP. Dating of some sediments in the northwestern part of Lake Ladoga suggests it happened at 3,100 radiocarbon years BP (3,410\u20133,250 calendar years BP).\nWildlife.\nThe Ladoga is rich with fish. Forty-eight forms (species and infra specific taxa) of fish have been encountered in the lake, including roach, carp bream, zander, European perch, ruffe, endemic variety of smelt, two varieties of \"Coregonus albula\" (vendace), eight varieties of \"Coregonus lavaretus\", a number of other Salmonidae as well as, albeit rarely, endangered Atlantic sturgeon (formerly confused with European sea sturgeon). Commercial fishing was once a major industry but has been hurt by overfishing. After the war, between 1945 and 1954, the total annual catch increased and reached a maximum of 4,900 tonnes. However, unbalanced fishery led to the drastic decrease of catch in 1955\u20131963, sometimes to 1,600 tonnes per year. Trawling has been forbidden in Lake Ladoga since 1956 and some other restrictions were imposed. The situation gradually recovered, and in 1971\u20131990 the catch ranged between 4,900 and 6,900 tonnes per year, about the same level as the total catch in 1938. Fish farms and recreational fishing are developing.\nIt has its own endemic ringed seal subspecies known as the Ladoga seal.\nSince the beginning of the 1960s Ladoga has become considerably eutrophicated.\nNizhnesvirsky Natural Reserve is situated along the shore of Lake Ladoga immediately to the north of the mouth of the River Svir.\nThe Ladoga has a population of Arctic char that is genetically close to the chars of Lake Sommen and Lake V\u00e4ttern in southern Sweden.\nHistory.\nIn the Middle Ages, the lake formed a vital part of the trade route from the Varangians to the Eastern Roman Empire, with the Norse emporium at Staraya Ladoga defending the mouth of the Volkhov since the 8th century. In the course of the Swedish\u2013Novgorodian Wars, the area was disputed between the Novgorod Republic and Sweden. In the early 14th century, the fortresses of Korela (Kexholm) and Oreshek (N\u00f6teborg) were established along the banks of the lake.\nDuring the Russo-Swedish War of 1656\u20131658, the Swedes deployed several armed vessels (called Lodja) on lake Ladoga to combat the Russians though no large sea battles were fought.\nThe ancient Valaam Monastery was founded on the island of Valaam, the largest in Lake Ladoga, abandoned between 1611 and 1715, restored in the 18th century, and evacuated to Finland during the Winter War in 1940. In 1989 the monastic activities in the Valaam were resumed. Other historic cloisters in the vicinity are the Konevets Monastery, which sits on the Konevets island, and the Alexander-Svirsky Monastery, which preserves samples of medieval Muscovite architecture.\nDuring the Ingrian War, a fraction of the Ladoga coast was occupied by Sweden. In 1617, by the Treaty of Stolbovo, the northern and western coast was ceded by Russia to Sweden. In 1721, after the Great Northern War, it was restitutioned to Russia by the Treaty of Nystad. In the 18th century, the Ladoga Canal was built to bypass the lake which was prone to winds and storms that destroyed hundreds of cargo ships.\nLater, from around 1812\u20131940 the lake was shared between Finland and Russia. According to the conditions of the 1920 Tartu Peace Treaty militarization of the lake was severely restricted. However, both Soviet Russia and Finland had flotillas in Ladoga (see also Finnish Ladoga Naval Detachment). After the Winter War (1939\u201340) according to the Moscow Peace Treaty, Ladoga, previously shared with Finland, became an internal basin of the Soviet Union.\nDuring World War II not only Finnish and Soviet, but also German and Italian vessels operated there (see also Naval Detachment K and Regia Marina). Under these circumstances, during much of the Siege of Leningrad (1941\u201344), Lake Ladoga provided the only access to the besieged city as a section of the eastern shore remained in Soviet hands. Supplies were transported into Leningrad with trucks on winter roads over the ice, the \"Road of Life\", and by boat in the summer. After World War II, Finland lost the Karelia region again to the USSR, and all Finnish citizens were evacuated from the ceded territory. Ladoga became an internal Soviet basin once again. The northern shore, Ladoga Karelia with the town of Sortavala, is now part of the Republic of Karelia. The western shore, Karelian Isthmus, became part of Leningrad Oblast.\n\"(incomplete list)\"\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The term \"family\" is a metaphor borrowed from biology, with the tree model used in historical linguistics analogous to a family tree, or to phylogenetic trees of taxa used in evolutionary taxonomy. Linguists thus describe the \"daughter languages\" within a language family as being \"genetically related\". The divergence of a proto-language into daughter languages typically occurs through geographical separation, with different regional dialects of the proto-language undergoing different language changes and thus becoming distinct languages over time. \nOne well-known example of a language family is the Romance languages, including Spanish, French, Italian, Portuguese, Romanian, Catalan, Romansh, and many others, all of which are descended from Vulgar Latin. The Romance family itself is part of the larger Indo-European family, which includes many other languages native to Europe and South Asia, all believed to have descended from a common ancestor known as Proto-Indo-European.\nA language family is usually said to contain at least two languages, although language isolates \u2014 languages that are not related to any other language \u2014 are occasionally referred to as families that contain one language. Conversely, there is no upper bound to the number of languages a family can contain. Some families, such as the Austronesian languages, contain over 1,000.\nLanguage families can be identified from characteristics shared amongst their languages. Sound changes are one of the strongest pieces of evidence that can be used to identify a genetic relationship because of their predictable and consistent nature, and through the comparative method can be used to reconstruct proto-languages. However, languages can also change through language contact, which can falsely suggest genetic relationships. For example, the Mongolic, Tungusic, and Turkic languages share many similarities that have led several scholars to believe they were related. These supposed relationships were later discovered (in the view of most scholars) to be derived through language contact and thus they are not related through shared ancestry. Eventually though, intense language contact with other language families, and inconsistent changes within the original language family, will obscure inherited characteristics and make it virtually impossible to deduce earlier relationships; even the oldest demonstrable language family, Afroasiatic, is far younger than language itself.\nMajor language families.\nEstimates of the number of language families in the world may vary widely. According to \"Ethnologue\" there are 7,151 living human languages across 142 different language families. Lyle Campbell (2019) identifies a total of 406 independent language families, including isolates.\n\"Ethnologue\" 27 (2024) lists the following families that contain at least 1% of the 7,164 known languages in the world; while \"Glottolog\" 5.0 (2024) lists the following as the largest families, of 7,788 languages (other than sign languages, pidgins, and unclassifiable languages):\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Table alignment/tables.css\" /&gt;\nLanguage counts can vary significantly depending on what is considered merely a dialect; for example Lyle Campbell counts only 27 Otomanguean languages, although he, \"Ethnologue\" and \"Glottolog\" also disagree as to which languages belong in the family.\nNeither Ethnologue nor Glottolog list the language families of sign languages. Of sign language families, the Francosign family, hosting around 70 languages, is by far the largest and most widespread.\nThe largest five language families in terms of number of speakers (Indo-European, Sino-Tibetan, Afro-Asiatic, Niger-Congo and Austronesian) make up five-sixths (almost 83.3%) of the world\u2019s population.\nGenetic relationship.\nTwo languages have a \"genetic relationship\", and belong to the same language family, if both are descended from a common ancestor through the process of language change, or one is descended from the other.\nThe term and the process of language evolution are independent of, and not reliant on, the terminology, understanding, and theories related to genetics in the biological sense, so, to avoid confusion, some linguists prefer the term \"genealogical relationship\".\nThere is a remarkably similar pattern shown by the linguistic tree and the genetic tree of human ancestry \nthat was verified statistically. Languages interpreted in terms of the putative phylogenetic tree of human languages are transmitted to a great extent vertically (by ancestry) as opposed to horizontally (by spatial diffusion).\nEstablishment.\nIn some cases, the shared derivation of a group of related languages from a common ancestor is directly attested in the historical record. For example, this is the case for the Romance language family, wherein Spanish, Italian, Portuguese, Romanian, and French are all descended from Latin, as well as for the North Germanic language family, including Danish, Swedish, Norwegian and Icelandic, which have shared descent from Ancient Norse. Latin and ancient Norse are both attested in written records, as are many intermediate stages between those ancestral languages and their modern descendants.\nIn other cases, genetic relationships between languages are not directly attested. For instance, the Romance languages and the North Germanic languages are also related to each other, being subfamilies of the Indo-European language family, since both Latin and Old Norse are believed to be descended from an even more ancient language, Proto-Indo-European; however, no direct evidence of Proto-Indo-European or its divergence into its descendant languages survives. In cases such as these, genetic relationships are established through use of the comparative method of linguistic analysis.\nIn order to test the hypothesis that two languages are related, the comparative method begins with the collection of pairs of words that are hypothesized to be cognates: i.e., words in related languages that are derived from the same word in the shared ancestral language. Pairs of words that have similar pronunciations and meanings in the two languages are often good candidates for hypothetical cognates. The researcher must rule out the possibility that the two words are similar merely due to chance, or due to one having borrowed the words from the other (or from a language related to the other). Chance resemblance is ruled out by the existence of large collections of pairs of words between the two languages showing similar patterns of phonetic similarity. Once coincidental similarity and borrowing have been eliminated as possible explanations for similarities in sound and meaning of words, the remaining explanation is common origin: it is inferred that the similarities occurred due to descent from a common ancestor, and the words are actually cognates, implying the languages must be related.\nLinguistic interference and borrowing.\nWhen languages are in contact with one another, either of them may influence the other through linguistic interference such as borrowing. For example, French has influenced English, Arabic has influenced Persian, German has influenced Hungarian, Sanskrit has influenced Tamil, and Chinese has influenced Japanese in this way. However, such influence does not constitute (and is not a measure of) a genetic relationship between the languages concerned. Linguistic interference can occur between languages that are genetically closely related, between languages that are distantly related (like English and French, which are distantly related Indo-European languages) and between languages that have no genetic relationship.\nComplications.\nSome exceptions to the simple genetic relationship model of languages include language isolates and mixed, pidgin and creole languages. \nMixed languages, pidgins and creole languages constitute special genetic types of languages. They do not descend linearly or directly from a single language and have no single ancestor. \nIsolates are languages that cannot be proven to be genealogically related to any other modern language. As a corollary, every language isolate also forms its own language family\u2014a genetic family which happens to consist of just one language. One often cited example is Basque, which forms a language family on its own; but there are many other examples outside Europe. On the global scale, the site Glottolog counts a total of 423 language families in the world, including 184 isolates.\nMonogenesis.\nOne controversial theory concerning the genetic relationships among languages is monogenesis, the idea that all known languages, with the exceptions of creoles, pidgins and sign languages, are descendant from a single ancestral language. If that is true, it would mean all languages (other than pidgins, creoles, and sign languages) are genetically related, but in many cases, the relationships may be too remote to be detectable. Alternative explanations for some basic observed commonalities between languages include developmental theories, related to the biological development of the capacity for language as the child grows from newborn.\nStructure of a family.\nA language family is a monophyletic unit; all its members derive from a common ancestor, and all descendants of that ancestor are included in the family. Thus, the term \"family\" is analogous to the biological term \"clade\". Language families can be divided into smaller phylogenetic units, sometimes referred to as \"branches\" or \"subfamilies\" of the family; for instance, the Germanic languages are a subfamily of the Indo-European family. Subfamilies share a more recent common ancestor than the common ancestor of the larger family; Proto-Germanic, the common ancestor of the Germanic subfamily, was itself a descendant of Proto-Indo-European, the common ancestor of the Indo-European family. Within a large family, subfamilies can be identified through \"shared innovations\": members of a subfamily will share features that represent retentions from their more recent common ancestor, but were not present in the overall proto-language of the larger family.\nSome taxonomists restrict the term \"family\" to a certain level, but there is little consensus on how to do so. Those who affix such labels also subdivide branches into \"groups\", and groups into \"complexes\". A top-level (i.e., the largest) family is often called a \"phylum\" or \"stock\". The closer the branches are to each other, the more closely the languages will be related. This means if a branch of a proto-language is four branches down and there is also a sister language to that fourth branch, then the two sister languages are more closely related to each other than to that common ancestral proto-language.\nThe term \"macrofamily\" or \"superfamily\" is sometimes applied to proposed groupings of language families whose status as phylogenetic units is generally considered to be unsubstantiated by accepted historical linguistic methods.\nDialect continua.\nSome close-knit language families, and many branches within larger families, take the form of dialect continua in which there are no clear-cut geographical boundaries that make it possible to unequivocally identify, define, or count individual languages within the family. However, when the differences between the speech of different regions at the extremes of the continuum are so great that there is no mutual intelligibility between them, as occurs in Arabic, the continuum cannot meaningfully be seen as a single language.\nFurther, a speech variety may either be considered as a language or as a dialect, depending on social or political considerations. Thus, different sources, especially over time, can give wildly different numbers of languages within a certain family. Classifications of the Japonic family, for example, range from one language (a language isolate with dialects) to nearly twenty\u2014until the classification of Ryukyuan as separate languages within a Japonic language family rather than dialects of Japanese, the Japanese language itself was considered a language isolate and therefore the only language in its family.\nIsolates.\nMost of the world's languages are known to be related to others. Those that have no known relatives (or for which family relationships are only tentatively proposed) are called language isolates, essentially language families consisting of a single language. There are an estimated 129 language isolates known today. An example is Basque. In general, it is assumed that language isolates have relatives or had relatives at some point in their history but at a time depth too great for linguistic comparison to recover them.\nA language isolate is classified based on the fact that enough is known about the isolate to compare it genetically to other languages but no common ancestry or relationship is found with any other known language.\nA language isolated in its own branch within a family, such as Albanian and Armenian within Indo-European, is often also called an isolate, but the meaning of the word \"isolate\" in such cases is usually clarified with a modifier. For instance, Albanian and Armenian may be referred to as an \"Indo-European isolate\". By contrast, so far as is known, the Basque language is an absolute isolate: it has not been shown to be related to any other modern language despite numerous attempts. A language may be said to be an isolate currently but not historically if related but now extinct relatives are attested. The Aquitanian language, spoken in Roman times, may have been an ancestor of Basque, but it could also have been a sister language to the ancestor of Basque. In the latter case, Basque and Aquitanian would form a small family together. Ancestors are not considered to be distinct members of a family.\nProto-languages.\nA proto-language can be thought of as a mother language (not to be confused with a mother tongue) being the root from which all languages in the family stem. The common ancestor of a language family is seldom known directly since most languages have a relatively short recorded history. However, it is possible to recover many features of a proto-language by applying the comparative method, a reconstructive procedure worked out by 19th century linguist August Schleicher. This can demonstrate the validity of many of the proposed families in the list of language families. For example, the reconstructible common ancestor of the Indo-European language family is called \"Proto-Indo-European\". Proto-Indo-European is not attested by written records and so is conjectured to have been spoken before the invention of writing.\nVisual representation.\nA common visual representation of a language family is given by a genetic language tree. The tree model is sometimes termed a dendrogram or phylogeny. The family tree shows the relationship of the languages within a family, much as a family tree of an individual shows their relationship with their relatives. There are criticisms to the family tree model. Critics focus mainly on the claim that the internal structure of the trees is subject to variation based on the criteria of classification. Even among those who support the family tree model, there are debates over which languages should be included in a language family. For example, within the dubious Altaic language family, there are debates over whether the Japonic and Koreanic languages should be included or not.\nThe wave model has been proposed as an alternative to the tree model. The wave model uses isoglosses to group language varieties; unlike in the tree model, these groups can overlap. While the tree model implies a lack of contact between languages after derivation from an ancestral form, the wave model emphasizes the relationship between languages that remain in contact, which is more realistic. Historical glottometry is an application of the wave model, meant to identify and evaluate genetic relations in linguistic linkages.\nOther classifications of languages.\nSprachbund.\nA sprachbund is a geographic area having several languages that feature common linguistic structures. The similarities between those languages are caused by language contact, not by chance or common origin, and are not recognized as criteria that define a language family. An example of a sprachbund would be the Indian subcontinent.\nShared innovations, acquired by borrowing or other means, are not considered genetic and have no bearing with the language family concept. It has been asserted, for example, that many of the more striking features shared by Italic languages (Latin, Oscan, Umbrian, etc.) might well be \"areal features\". However, very similar-looking alterations in the systems of long vowels in the West Germanic languages greatly postdate any possible notion of a proto-language innovation (and cannot readily be regarded as \"areal\", either, since English and continental West Germanic were not a linguistic area). In a similar vein, there are many similar unique innovations in Germanic, Baltic and Slavic that are far more likely to be areal features than traceable to a common proto-language. But legitimate uncertainty about whether shared innovations are areal features, coincidence, or inheritance from a common ancestor, leads to disagreement over the proper subdivisions of any large language family.\nContact languages.\nThe concept of language families is based on the historical observation that languages develop dialects, which over time may diverge into distinct languages. However, linguistic ancestry is less clear-cut than familiar biological ancestry, in which species do not crossbreed. It is more like the evolution of microbes, with extensive lateral gene transfer. Quite distantly related languages may affect each other through language contact, which in extreme cases may lead to languages with no single ancestor, whether they be creoles or mixed languages. In addition, a number of sign languages have developed in isolation and appear to have no relatives at all. Nonetheless, such cases are relatively rare and most well-attested languages can be unambiguously classified as belonging to one language family or another, even if this family's relation to other families is not known.\nLanguage contact can lead to the development of new languages from the mixture of two or more languages for the purposes of interactions between two groups who speak different languages. Languages that arise in order for two groups to communicate with each other to engage in commercial trade or that appeared as a result of colonialism are called pidgin. Pidgins are an example of linguistic and cultural expansion caused by language contact. However, language contact can also lead to cultural divisions. In some cases, two different language speaking groups can feel territorial towards their language and do not want any changes to be made to it. This causes language boundaries and groups in contact are not willing to make any compromises to accommodate the other language.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The island and its foreshore belongs to the charity, Cornwall Wildlife Trust.\nAccording to local legend, Joseph of Arimathea landed here with the Christ Child. Some scholars, including Glyn S. Lewis, suggest the island could be Ictis, the location described by Diodorus Siculus as a centre for the tin trade in pre-Roman Britain.\nThe island is now owned and managed by the Cornwall Wildlife Trust charity where access (including landing on the foreshore and flying of drones over the island) is carefully managed for the benefit of wildlife and landing is only possible via the Cornwall Wildlife Trust authorized boat operator. The waters around the island are a marine nature reserve and form part of the Whitsand and Looe Bay Marine Conservation Area (VMCA). First established in 1995, the Whitsand and Looe Bay Marine Conservation Area covers nearly 5\u00a0km of coastline and aims to protect the coastal and marine wildlife around Looe.\nHistory.\nPeople have been living on Looe Island since the Iron Age. Evidence of early habitation includes pieces of Roman amphorae as well as stone boat anchors and Roman coins. A number of late prehistoric or Romano-British finds have been made in the vicinity of the island, including a large bronze ingot found by divers south of Looe Island, which has led a number of people to suggest the island is possibly Ictis, the tin trading island seen by Pytheas in the 4th century BC and recalled by Diodorus Siculus in the 1st century BC. A small hoard of eight late Roman coins was recovered in 2008. These coins were recovered from one of the shallow ditches forming a 'pear shaped enclosure' which encompassed the top of Looe Island and the later Christian chapel site. All eight coins date to the late 3rd or early 4th century AD.\nIn the Dark Ages, the island was used a seat of early Christian settlement. The child Jesus was believed to have visited the Island with his uncle, Joseph of Arimathea, who traded with the Cornish tin traders. Looe Island was already a place of pilgrimage for early Christians before the creation of this story and a small thatched roofed chapel was built there during this time.\nIn the later medieval period, the island came under the overall control of Glastonbury Abbey, with the Prior of Lammana being directly responsible for its governance; the island's chapel was under the care of two Benedictine monks until 1289 when the property was sold to a local landowner. The priory was replaced by a domestic chapel served by a secular priest until the Dissolution of the Monasteries in 1536 when it became property of the Crown. From the 13th to the 16th centuries it was known as St Michael's Island but after the dissolution of the monasteries, it was rededicated in 1594 as St George's Island.\nThrough the 17th and 18th centuries, the island was used by smugglers to avoid the British Government's revenue cutters out of Plymouth and Falmouth. The Guildhall Museum in Looe holds information and research about the smuggling families of Looe Island and information is also available in the more recent publications about the island.\nDuring the Second World War, Looe Island was for a time renamed as 'H.M.S St. George', following the dropping of a probable parachute mine which resulted in a large crater in the summit. It was believed the island was mistaken for an Allied ship. The incident was recorded in \"The Cornish Times\" under the headline \"H.M.S St. George. Nazi Airman's Direct Hit Off Looe \u2013 Another 'Success' for the Luftwaffe\". The article continued \"H.M.S St. George is still riding peacefully at her anchorage in Looe Bay, after being bombed recently by a Nazi air-raider in what would seem to have been an attempt to sink her. Although St. George has occupied the same berth for millennia, and is as well-known to inhabitants and visitors to Looe as the palms of their hands, no one has determined to what particular class of battleship she belongs, indeed all are familiar with the shapely hulk lying seaward of Hannafore as Looe Island (or, cartographically St. Georges Island)\".\nIn 1965 the island was bought for \u00a325,000 () by two sisters, Babs and Evelyn Atkins. They wrote two books chronicling their purchase and subsequent life on Looe; \"We Bought An Island\" and its sequel \"Tales From Our Cornish Island\". Evelyn died in 1997 at the age of 87; Babs continued to live on the island until her death in 2004, at the age of 86. On her death, the island was bequeathed to Cornwall Wildlife Trust; it will be preserved as a nature reserve in perpetuity. Today the wardens for Cornwall Wildlife Trust live on the island and manage it for the benefit of wildlife. The adjoining islet, formerly known as Little Island, now renamed Trelawny Island and connected by a small bridge, was bequeathed by Atkins back to the Trelawny family, who previously owned Looe Island from 1743 to 1921.\nGeography.\nSituated in the English Channel, about one mile from East Looe in the direction of Polperro, it is about in area and a mile (1.6\u00a0km) in circumference. Its highest point is above sea level. Looe Island, like much of south west England, has a mild climate with frost and snow being rare.\nThe island is owned and managed by the Cornwall Wildlife Trust. This is a non-profit-making venture, the landing fees and other income being devoted to conserving the island's natural environment and providing facilities. The island is open during the summer to day visitors arriving by the Trust's authorised boat operator. After a short welcome talk visitors are directed to the small visitor centre from where they can pick up a copy of the self-guided trail. Visitors have some two hours on the island and all trips are subject to tides and weather/sea state. \nMedia appearances.\nIn 2008, Channel 4's archaeology series \"Time Team\" visited the island to carry out an investigation into its early Christian history. They excavated the sites of Christian chapels built on both the island and on the mainland opposite. During their dig they found the remains of a Benedictine chapel that was built in c.1139 by monks from Glastonbury Abbey, a reliquary, graves and the remains of much earlier Anglo-Romano places of worship built of wood with dating evidence suggesting use by Christians before the reign of Constantine the Great.\nIn 1994/95 Andrew Hugill composed \"Island Symphony\", an electro-acoustic piece utilising sampled sounds sourced over the net plus recorded natural sounds from the island itself.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

LaTeX provides a high-level, descriptive markup language to utilize TeX more easily: TeX handles the document layout, while LaTeX handles the content side for document processing. Because the plain TeX formatting commands are elementary, it provides authors with ready-made commands for formatting and layout requirements such as chapter headings, footnotes, cross-references and bibliographies.\nLaTeX was originally written in the early 1980s by Leslie Lamport at SRI International. The current version is LaTeX2e, first released in 1994 but incrementally updated starting in 2015. This update policy replaced earlier plans for a separate release of LaTeX3, which had been in development since 1989. LaTeX is free software and is distributed under the LaTeX Project Public License (LPPL).\nLike TeX, LaTeX started as a writing tool for mathematicians and computer scientists, but even from early in its development, it has also been taken up by scholars who needed to write documents that include complex math expressions or non-Latin scripts, such as Arabic, Devanagari, and Chinese.\nHistory.\nLaTeX was created in the early 1980s by Leslie Lamport when he was working at Stanford Research Institute (SRI). He needed to write TeX macros for his own use and thought that with a little extra effort, he could make a general package usable by others. Peter Gordon, an editor at Addison-Wesley, convinced him to write a LaTeX user's manual for publication (Lamport was initially skeptical that anyone would pay money for it); it came out in 1986 and sold hundreds of thousands of copies. Meanwhile, Lamport released versions of his LaTeX macros in 1984 and 1985. On 21 August 1989, at a TeX Users Group (TUG) meeting at Stanford, Lamport agreed to turn over maintenance and development of LaTeX to Frank Mittelbach. Mittelbach, along with Chris Rowley and Rainer Sch\u00f6pf, formed the LaTeX3 team; in 1994, they released LaTeX2e, the current standard version. LaTeX3 has since been discontinued as a separate format and has become a programming layer within LaTeX2e since 2018.\nTypesetting system.\nLaTeX attempts to follow the design philosophy of separating presentation from content, so that authors can focus on the content of what they are writing without attending simultaneously to its visual appearance. In preparing a LaTeX document, the author specifies the logical structure using simple, familiar concepts such as \"chapter\", \"section\", \"table\", \"figure\", etc., and lets the LaTeX system handle the formatting and layout of these structures. As a result, it encourages the separation of the layout from the content \u2013 while still allowing manual typesetting adjustments whenever needed. This concept is similar to the mechanism by which many word processors allow styles to be defined globally for an entire document, or the use of Cascading Style Sheets in styling HyperText Markup Language (HTML) documents.\nThe LaTeX system is a markup language that handles typesetting and rendering, and can be arbitrarily extended by using the underlying macro language to develop custom macros such as new environments and commands. Such macros are often collected into \"packages,\" which could then be made available to address some specific typesetting needs such as the formatting of complex mathematical expressions or graphics (e.g., the use of the codice_1 environment provided by the codice_2 package to produce aligned equations).\nTo create a document in LaTeX, a user first creates a file, such as codice_3, typically using a text editor. The user then gives their codice_3 file as input to the TeX program (with the LaTeX macros loaded), which prompts TeX to write out a file suitable for onscreen viewing or printing. This write-format-preview cycle is one of the chief ways in which working with LaTeX differs from the What-You-See-Is-What-You-Get (WYSIWYG) style of document editing. It is similar to the code-compile-execute cycle known to computer programmers. Today, many LaTeX-aware editing programs make this cycle a simple matter through the pressing of a single key while showing the output preview on the screen beside the input window. Some online LaTeX editors even automatically refresh the preview, while other online tools provide incremental editing in-place, mixed in with the preview in a single window.\nPronunciation and typography.\nThe characters 'T', 'E', and 'X' in the name come from the Greek capital letters tau, epsilon, and chi, as the name of TeX derives from the ('skill', 'art', 'technique'); for this reason, TeX's creator Donald Knuth promotes its pronunciation as () (that is, with a voiceless velar fricative as in Modern Greek, or the ch in loch). Lamport remarks that \"TeX is usually pronounced \"tech\", making \"lah\"-tech, lah-\"tech\", and \"lay\"-tech the logical choices; but language is not always logical, so \"lay-tecks\" is also possible.\"\nThe name is printed in running text with a typographical logo: &lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:TeX wordmark/style.css\" /&gt;LaTeX. In media where the logo cannot be precisely reproduced in running text, the word is typically given the unique capitalization LaTeX. Alternatively, the TeX, LaTeX, and XeTeX logos can also be rendered via pure CSS and XHTML for use in graphical web browsers \u2013 by following the specifications of the internal codice_5 macro.\nExample.\nThe example below shows the input to LaTeX and the corresponding output from the system:\nRelated software.\nAs a macro package, LaTeX provides a set of macros for TeX to interpret. There are many other macro packages for TeX, including Plain TeX, GNU Texinfo, AMSTeX, Chemfig, chemmacros, PSTricks, PSfrag, and ConTeXt.\nWhen TeX \"compiles\" a document, it follows (from the user's point of view) the following processing sequence: Macros \u2192 TeX \u2192 Driver \u2192 Output. Different implementations of each of these steps are typically available in TeX distributions. Traditional TeX will output a DVI file, which is usually converted to a PostScript file. In 2000, H\u00e0n Th\u1ebf Th\u00e0nh and others wrote an implementation of TeX called pdfTeX, which also outputs to PDF and takes advantage of features available in that format. The XeTeX engine developed by Jonathan Kew, on the other hand, merges modern font technologies and Unicode with TeX. LuaTeX is an extended version of pdfTeX using Lua as an embedded scripting language.\nCompatibility and converters.\nLaTeX documents (codice_6) can be opened with any text editor. They consist of plain text and contain no hidden formatting codes or binary information. TeX documents can also be shared by rendering the LaTeX file to other formats such as OpenDocument, XML, or class () files. LaTeX can also (and commonly is) rendered to PDF files using the LaTeX extension pdfLaTeX. LaTeX files containing Unicode text can be processed into PDFs with the codice_7 package, or by the TeX extensions XeLaTeX and LuaLaTeX.\nLaTeX has become the de facto standard to typeset mathematical expression in scientific documents. Hence, there are several conversion tools focusing on mathematical LaTeX expressions, such as converters to MathML or Computer Algebra System.\nLicensing.\nLaTeX is typically distributed along with plain TeX under a free software licence: the LaTeX Project Public License (LPPL). The LPPL is not compatible with the GNU General Public License, as it requires that modified files must be clearly differentiable from their originals (usually by changing the filename); this was done to ensure that files that depend on other files will produce the expected behavior and avoid dependency hell. The LPPL is Debian Free Software Guidelines (DFSG) compliant as of version 1.3. As free software, LaTeX is available on most operating systems.\nVersions.\nLaTeX2e is the current version of LaTeX, since it replaced LaTeX 2.09 in 1994. As of 2020[ [update]], LaTeX3, which started in the early 1990s, is under a long-term development project. Planned features include improved syntax (separation of content from styling), hyperlink support, a new user interface, access to arbitrary fonts and a new documentation. Some LaTeX3 features are available in LaTeX2e using packages, and by 2020 many features have been enabled in LaTeX2e by default for a gradual transition.\nThere are many commercial implementations of the entire TeX system. System vendors may add extra features like added typefaces and telephone support. LyX is a free software, WYSIWYM visual document processor that uses LaTeX for a back-end. TeXmacs is a free, WYSIWYG editor with similar functionalities as LaTeX, but with a different typesetting engine. Other WYSIWYG editors that produce LaTeX include Scientific Word on Windows and macOS.\nMany community-supported TeX distributions are available.\nAdoption.\nLaTeX is widely used in academia for the communication and publication of scientific documents and technical note-taking in many fields, owing partially to its support for complex mathematical notation. It also has a prominent role in the preparation and publication of books and articles that contain complex multilingual materials, such as Arabic and Greek. LaTeX uses the TeX typesetting program for formatting its output, and is itself written in the TeX macro language.\nLaTeX can be used as a standalone document preparation system or as an intermediate format. In the latter role, for example, it is sometimes used as part of a pipeline for translating DocBook and other XML-based formats for PDF. The typesetting system offers programmable desktop publishing features and extensive facilities for automating most aspects of typesetting and desktop publishing, including numbering and cross-referencing of tables and figures, chapter and section headings, graphics, page layout, indexing and bibliographies.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

For lower dimensions formula_1, it coincides with the standard measure of length, area, or volume. In general, it is also called n\"-dimensional volume, n\"-volume, hypervolume, or simply volume. It is used throughout real analysis, in particular to define Lebesgue integration. Sets that can be assigned a Lebesgue measure are called Lebesgue-measurable; the measure of the Lebesgue-measurable set formula_2 is here denoted by formula_3.\nHenri Lebesgue described this measure in the year 1901 which, a year after, was followed up by his description of the Lebesgue integral. Both were published as part of his dissertation \"Int\u00e9grale, Longueur, Aire\" in 1902.\nDefinition.\nFor any interval formula_4, or formula_5, in the set formula_6 of real numbers, let formula_7 denote its length. For any subset formula_8, the \"Lebesgue outer measure\" formula_9 is defined as an infimum\nformula_10\nThe above definition can be generalised to higher dimensions as follows. For any rectangular cuboid formula_11 which is a Cartesian product formula_12 of open intervals, let formula_13 (a real number product) denote its volume.

The set of all such formula_16 forms a \"\u03c3\"-algebra.\nThe \"Lebesgue measure\" of such a set is defined as its Lebesgue outer measure: formula_23. ZFC proves that non-measurable sets do exist; examples are the Vitali sets.\nIntuition.\nThe first part of the definition states that the subset formula_16 of the real numbers is reduced to its outer measure by coverage by sets of open intervals. Each of these sets of intervals formula_25 covers formula_16 in a sense, since the union of these intervals contains formula_16. The total length of any covering interval set may overestimate the measure of formula_28 because formula_16 is a subset of the union of the intervals, and so the intervals may include points which are not in formula_16. The Lebesgue outer measure emerges as the greatest lower bound (infimum) of the lengths from among all possible such sets. Intuitively, it is the total length of those interval sets which fit formula_16 most tightly and do not overlap.\nThat characterizes the Lebesgue outer measure. Whether this outer measure translates to the Lebesgue measure proper depends on an additional condition. This condition is tested by taking subsets formula_2 of the real numbers using formula_16 as an instrument to split formula_2 into two partitions: the part of formula_2 which intersects with formula_16 and the remaining part of formula_2 which is not in formula_16: the set difference of formula_2 and formula_16. These partitions of formula_2 are subject to the outer measure. If for all possible such subsets formula_2 of the real numbers, the partitions of formula_2 cut apart by formula_16 have outer measures whose sum is the outer measure of formula_2, then the outer Lebesgue measure of formula_16 gives its Lebesgue measure. Intuitively, this condition means that the set formula_16 must not have some curious properties which causes a discrepancy in the measure of another set when formula_16 is used as a \"mask\" to \"clip\" that set, hinting at the existence of sets for which the Lebesgue outer measure does not give the Lebesgue measure. (Such sets are, in fact, not Lebesgue-measurable.)\nProperties.\nThe Lebesgue measure on formula_58 has the following properties:\nAll the above may be succinctly summarized as follows (although the last two assertions are non-trivially linked to the following):\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Block indent/styles.css\"/&gt;\nThe Lebesgue measure also has the property of being \u03c3-finite.\nNull sets.\nA subset of formula_58 is a \"null set\" if, for every formula_114, it can be covered with countably many products of \"n\" intervals whose total volume is at most formula_115. All countable sets are null sets.\nIf a subset of formula_58 has Hausdorff dimension less than \"n\" then it is a null set with respect to \"n\"-dimensional Lebesgue measure. Here Hausdorff dimension is relative to the Euclidean metric on formula_58 (or any metric Lipschitz equivalent to it). On the other hand, a set may have topological dimension less than n and have positive \"n\"-dimensional Lebesgue measure. An example of this is the Smith\u2013Volterra\u2013Cantor set which has topological dimension 0 yet has positive 1-dimensional Lebesgue measure.\nIn order to show that a given set \"formula_61\" is Lebesgue-measurable, one usually tries to find a \"nicer\" set \"formula_71\" which differs from \"formula_61\" only by a null set (in the sense that the symmetric difference \"formula_121\" is a null set) and then show that \"formula_71\" can be generated using countable unions and intersections from open or closed sets.\nConstruction of the Lebesgue measure.\nThe modern construction of the Lebesgue measure is an application of Carath\u00e9odory's extension theorem. It proceeds as follows.\nFix formula_123. A box in formula_58 is a set of the formformula_125where formula_126, and the product symbol here represents a Cartesian product. The volume of this box is defined to beformula_127For \"any\" subset \"formula_2\" of formula_58, we can define its outer measure formula_130 by:formula_131We then define the set \"formula_2\" to be Lebesgue-measurable if for every subset \"formula_133\" of formula_58,formula_135These Lebesgue-measurable sets form a \"\u03c3\"-algebra, and the Lebesgue measure is defined by formula_136 for any Lebesgue-measurable set \"formula_2\".\nThe existence of sets that are not Lebesgue-measurable is a consequence of the set-theoretical axiom of choice, which is independent from many of the conventional systems of axioms for set theory. The Vitali theorem, which follows from the axiom, states that there exist subsets of formula_6 that are not Lebesgue-measurable. Assuming the axiom of choice, non-measurable sets with many surprising properties have been demonstrated, such as those of the Banach\u2013Tarski paradox.\nIn 1970, Robert M. Solovay showed that the existence of sets that are not Lebesgue-measurable is not provable within the framework of Zermelo\u2013Fraenkel set theory in the absence of the axiom of choice (see Solovay's model).\nRelation to other measures.\nThe Borel measure agrees with the Lebesgue measure on those sets for which it is defined; however, there are many more Lebesgue-measurable sets than there are Borel measurable sets. While the Lebesgue measure on formula_58 is automatically a locally finite Borel measure, not every locally finite Borel measure on formula_58 is necessarily a Lebesgue measure. The Borel measure is translation-invariant, but not complete.\nThe Haar measure can be defined on any locally compact group and is a generalization of the Lebesgue measure (formula_58 with addition is a locally compact group).\nThe Hausdorff measure is a generalization of the Lebesgue measure that is useful for measuring the subsets of formula_58 of lower dimensions than \"n\", like submanifolds, for example, surfaces or curves in formula_143 and fractal sets. The Hausdorff measure is not to be confused with the notion of Hausdorff dimension.\nIt can be shown that there is no infinite-dimensional analogue of Lebesgue measure.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

With a length of and surface area over , it lies mostly between the U.S. states of New York and Vermont, but also extends north into the Canadian province of Quebec.\nThe cities of Burlington, Vermont, and Plattsburgh, New York, are the largest settlements on the lake, and towards the south lies the historic Fort Ticonderoga in New York. The Quebec portion is in the regional county municipalities of Le Haut-Richelieu and Brome-Missisquoi. There are a number of islands in the lake; the largest include Grand Isle, Isle La Motte and North Hero: all part of Grand Isle County, Vermont. Because of Lake Champlain's connections both to the St. Lawrence Seaway via the Richelieu River, and to the Hudson River via the Champlain Canal, Lake Champlain is sometimes referred to as \"The Sixth Great Lake\".\nThe lake's coastline is relatively undeveloped, and hosts a number of state parks, including ones at North Hero and Button Bay in Vermont, and Cumberland Bay in New York. Much of New York's shoreline is located within the larger Adirondack Park. The lake is a significant part of local culture, especially Champ, a lake monster that allegedly resides there.\nGeology.\nThe Champlain Valley is the northernmost unit of a landform system known as the Great Appalachian Valley, which stretches between Quebec, Canada, to the north, and Alabama, U.S., to the south. The Champlain Valley is a physiographic section of the larger Saint Lawrence Valley, which in turn is part of the larger Appalachian physiographic division.\nLake Champlain is one of numerous large lakes scattered in an arc through Labrador, in Canada, the northern United States, and the Northwest Territories of Canada.\nHydrology.\nLake Champlain covers approximately , making it the thirteenth-largest lake by area in the U.S. It lies at an elevation of , is , has a shoreline, averages in width, has an average depth of , a maximum depth of , and holds some of water.\nLake Champlain is in the Champlain Valley between the Green Mountains of Vermont and the Adirondack Mountains of New York, drained northward by the Richelieu River into the St. Lawrence River at Sorel-Tracy, Quebec, northeast and downstream of Montreal. The Champlain basin covers and collects waters from the northwestern slopes of the Green Mountains and the eastern portion of the Adirondack Mountains, reaching as far south as the Lake George in New York. The lake drains nearly half of Vermont, and approximately 250,000 people get their drinking water from it.\nThe lake is fed in Vermont by the LaPlatte, Lamoille, Missisquoi, Poultney and Winooski rivers, along with Lewis Creek, Little Otter Creek and Otter Creek. In New York, it is fed by the Ausable, Boquet, Great Chazy, La Chute, Little Ausable, Little Chazy, Salmon and Saranac rivers, along with Putnam Creek. In Quebec, it is fed by the Pike River. It is connected to the Hudson River by the Champlain Canal.\nParts of the lake freeze each winter, and in some winters the entire lake surface freezes, referred to as \"closing\". In July and August, the lake temperature reaches an average of .\nChazy Reef.\nThe Chazy Reef is an extensive Ordovician carbonate rock formation that extends from Tennessee to Quebec and Newfoundland. The oldest reefs are around \"The Head\" of the south end of Isle La Motte; slightly younger reefs are found at the Fisk Quarry, and the youngest (the famous coral reefs) are in fields to the north.\nHistory.\nThe lake has long acted as a border between indigenous nations, much as it is today between the states of New York and Vermont. The lake is located at the frontier between Abenaki and Mohawk (Iroquois Confederacy) traditional territories. The official toponym for the lake, according to the orthography established by the Grand Council of Waban-aki Nation, is Pitawbagok (alternative orthographies include Petonbowk and Bitawbagok), meaning \"middle lake\", \"lake in between\" or \"double lake\".\nThe Mohawk language name in modern orthography, as standardized in 1993, is Kaniatarakw\u00e0:ronte, meaning \"a bulged lake\" or \"lake with a bulge in it\". An alternate name is Kani\u00e1:tare tsi kahnhok\u00e0:ronte (phonetic English spelling \"Caniaderi Guarunte\"), meaning \"door of the country\" or \"lake to the country\". The lake is an important eastern gateway to Iroquois Confederacy lands.\nThe lake was named after the French explorer Samuel de Champlain, who encountered it in July 1609. While the ports of Burlington, Vermont, Port Henry, New York, and Plattsburgh, New York, today are primarily used by small craft, ferries and lake cruise ships, they were of substantial commercial and military importance in the 18th and 19th centuries.\nColonial America and the Revolutionary War.\nNew France allocated concessions all along Lake Champlain to French settlers and built forts to defend the waterways. In colonial times, Lake Champlain was used as a water (or, in winter, ice) passage between the Saint Lawrence and Hudson valleys. Travelers found it easier to journey by boats and sledges on the lake rather than go overland on unpaved and frequently mud-bound roads. The lake's northern tip at Saint-Jean-sur-Richelieu, Quebec (known as St. John in colonial times under British rule) is just from Montreal, Quebec. The southern tip at Whitehall (Skenesborough in revolutionary times) is north of Glens Falls on the Hudson River and north of Albany, New York.\nForts were built at Ticonderoga and Crown Point (Fort St. Frederic) to control passage on the lake in colonial times. Important battles were fought at Ticonderoga in 1758 and 1775. During the Revolutionary War, the British and Americans conducted a frenetic shipbuilding race through the spring and summer of 1776, at opposite ends of the lake, and fought a significant naval engagement on October 11 at the Battle of Valcour Island. While it was a tactical defeat for the Americans, and the small fleet led by Benedict Arnold was almost destroyed, the Americans gained a strategic victory; the British invasion was delayed long enough so the approach of winter prevented the fall of these forts until the following year. In this period, the Continental Army gained strength and was victorious at Saratoga.\nBeginning of the Revolutionary War.\nAt the start of the Revolutionary War, British forces occupied the Champlain Valley. However, it did not take long for rebel leaders to realize the importance of controlling Lake Champlain. Early in the war, the colonial militias attempted to expel the British from Boston; however, this undertaking could not be achieved without heavy artillery. The British forts at Ticonderoga and Crown Point, on Lake Champlain, were known to have ample supplies of artillery and were weakly-manned by the British. Thus, the colonial militias devised a plan to take control of the two forts and bring the guns back to the fight in Boston.\nThe necessity of controlling the two forts at Ticonderoga and Crown Point placed Lake Champlain as a strategic arena during the Revolutionary War. By taking control of these forts, Americans not only gained heavy artillery, but control of a vast water highway as well: Lake Champlain provided a direct invasion route to British Canada. However, had the British controlled the lake, they could have divided the colonies of New England and further depleted the Continental Army.\nThe Continental Army's first offensive action took place in May 1775, three weeks after the Battles of Lexington and Concord. Ethan Allen, accompanied by 200 Green Mountain Boys, was ordered to capture Fort Ticonderoga and retrieve supplies for the fight in Boston. Benedict Arnold shared the command with Allen, and, in early May 1775, they captured Fort Ticonderoga, Crown Point and the southern Loyalist settlement of Skenesborough. As a result of Allen's offensive attack on the Champlain Valley in 1775, the American forces controlled the Lake Champlain waterway.\nSiege of Quebec: 1775\u20131776.\nThe Continental Army realized the strategic advantage of controlling Lake Champlain, as it leads directly to the heart of Quebec. Immediately after taking Forts Ticonderoga and Crown Point, the Americans began planning an attack on British Canada. The American siege of Quebec was a two-pronged assault and occurred throughout the winter of 1775\u20131776. Brigadier General Richard Montgomery led the first assault up the Champlain Valley into Canada, while Benedict Arnold led a second army to Quebec via the Maine wilderness.\nDespite the strategic advantage of controlling a direct route to Quebec by way of the Champlain Valley, the American siege of British Canada during the winter of 1775 failed. The Continental Army mistakenly assumed that it would receive support from the Canadians upon their arrival at Quebec. This was not the case, and the rebel army struggled to take Quebec with diminishing supplies, support, and harsh northern winter weather.\nThe Continental Army was forced to camp outside Quebec's walls for the winter, with reinforcements from New York, Pennsylvania, Massachusetts, New Hampshire and Connecticut allowing the soldiers to maintain their siege of the city. However, smallpox descended on both the sieging forces and their reinforcements and savaged the American force. The reinforcements traveled hundreds of miles up the frozen Lake Champlain and St. Lawrence River, but were too late and too few to influence a successful siege of Quebec. In May 1776, with the arrival of a British convoy carrying 10,000 British and Hessian troops to Canada, the Continental forces retreated back down the Champlain Valley to reevaluate their strategy.\n\"I know of no better method than to secure the important posts of Ticonderoga and Crown Point, and by building a number of armed vessels to command the lakes, otherwise the forces now in Canada will be brought down upon us as quick as possible, having nothing to oppose them...They will doubtless try to construct some armed vessels and then endeavor to penetrate the country toward New York.\" (Brigadier General John Sullivan to George Washington, June 24, 1776).\nBoth British and American forces spent the summer of 1776 building their naval fleets, at opposite ends of Lake Champlain. By the October 1776, the Continental Army had 16 operating naval vessels on Lake Champlain: a great increase to the four small ships they had at the beginning of the summer. General Benedict Arnold commanded the American naval fleet on Lake Champlain, which was composed of volunteers and soldiers drafted from the Northern Army. With great contrast to the Continental navy, experienced Royal Navy officers, British seamen and Hessian artillerymen manned the British fleet on Lake Champlain. By the end of the summer of 1776, the opposing armies were prepared to battle over the strategic advantage of controlling Lake Champlain.\nBattle of Valcour Island.\nOn October 11, 1776, the British and American naval fleets met on the western side of Valcour Island, on Lake Champlain. American General Benedict Arnold established the location, as it provided the Continental fleet with a natural defensive position. The British and American vessels engaged in combat for much of the day, only stopping due to impending nightfall.\nAfter a long day of combat, the American fleet was in worse shape than the experienced British Navy. Upon ceasefire, Arnold called a council of war with his fellow officers, proposing to escape the British fleet via rowboats under the cover of night. As the British burned Arnold's flagship, the \"Royal Savage\", to the east, the Americans rowed past the British lines.\nThe following morning, the British learned of the Americans' escape and set out after the fleeing Continental vessels. On October 13, the British fleet caught up to the struggling American ships near Split Rock Mountain. With no hope of fighting off the powerful British navy, Arnold ordered his men to run their five vessels aground in Ferris Bay, Panton, Vermont. The depleted Continental army escaped on land back to Fort Ticonderoga and Mount Independence; however, they no longer controlled the Lake Champlain waterway.\nThe approaching winter of 1776\u20131777 restricted British movement along the recently controlled Lake Champlain. As the British abandoned Crown Point and returned to Canada for the winter, the Americans reduced their garrisons in the Champlain Valley from 13,000 to 2,500 soldiers.\nGeneral Burgoyne's Campaign.\nIn early 1777, British General John Burgoyne led 8,000 troops from Canada, down Lake Champlain and into the Champlain Valley. The goal of this invasion was to divide the New England colonies, thus forcing the Continental Army into a separated fight on multiple fronts. Lake Champlain provided Burgoyne with protected passage deep into the American colonies. Burgoyne's army reached Fort Ticonderoga and Mount Independence in late June, 1777. During the night of July 5, the American forces fled Ticonderoga as the British took control of the fort. However, Burgoyne's southern campaign did not go uncontested.\nOn October\u00a07, 1777, American General Horatio Gates, who occupied Bemis Heights, met Burgoyne's army at the Second Battle of Freeman's Farm. At Freeman's Farm, Burgoyne's army suffered its final defeat and ended its invasion south into the colonies. Ten days later, on October\u00a017, 1777, British General Burgoyne surrendered his army at Saratoga. This defeat was instrumental to the momentum of the Revolutionary War, as the defeat of the British army along the Champlain-Hudson waterway convinced France to ally with the American army.\nAftermath of 1777.\nFollowing the failed British campaign led by General Burgoyne, the British still maintained control over the Champlain waterway for the duration of the Revolutionary War. The British used the Champlain waterway to supply raids across the Champlain Valley from 1778 to 1780, and Lake Champlain permitted direct transportation of supplies from the British posts at the northern end of the lake.\nWith the end of the Revolutionary War in 1783, the British naval fleet on Lake Champlain retreated up to St. John's. However, British troops garrisoned at Fort Dutchman's Point (North Hero, Vermont) and Fort au Fer (Champlain, New York), on Lake Champlain, did not leave until the 1796 Jay Treaty.\nPost-Revolutionary War period.\nEager to take back control of Lake Champlain following the end of the Revolutionary War, Americans flocked to settle the Champlain Valley. Many individuals emigrated from Massachusetts and other New England colonies, such as Salmon Dutton, a settler of Cavendish, Vermont. Dutton emigrated in 1782 and worked as a surveyor, town official and toll-road owner. His home had a dooryard garden, typical of mid-19th century New England village homes, and his experience settling in the Champlain Valley depicts the industries and lifestyles surrounding Lake Champlain following the Revolutionary War.\nSimilar to the experience of Salmon Dutton, former colonial militia Major General Hezekiah Barnes settled in Charlotte, Vermont, in 1787. Following the war, Barnes worked as a road surveyor; he also established an inn and trading post in Charlotte, along the main trade route from Montreal down Lake Champlain. Barnes' stagecoach inn was built in traditional Georgian style, with 10 fireplaces, a ballroom on the interior and a wraparound porch on the outside. In 1800, Continental Army Captain Benjamin Harrington established a distillery business in Shelburne, Vermont, which supplied his nearby inn. These individual accounts shed light on the significance of Lake Champlain during the post-Revolutionary War period.\nWar of 1812.\nDuring the War of 1812, British and American forces faced each other in the Battle of Lake Champlain, also known as the Battle of Plattsburgh, fought on September\u00a011, 1814. This ended the final British invasion of the northern states during the War of 1812. It was fought just prior to the signing of the Treaty of Ghent, and the American victory denied the British any leverage to demand exclusive control over the Great Lakes or territorial gains against the New England states.\nThree US Naval ships have been named after this battle: , and a cargo ship used during World War I.\nFollowing the War of 1812, the U.S. Army began construction on \"Fort Blunder\": an unnamed fortification built at the northernmost end of Lake Champlain to protect against attacks from British Canada. Its nickname came from a surveying error: the initial phase of construction on the fort turned out to be taking place on a point north of the Canada\u2013U.S. border. Once this error was spotted, construction was abandoned. Locals scavenged materials used in the abandoned fort for use in their homes and public buildings.\nBy the Webster\u2013Ashburton Treaty of 1842, the Canada\u2013U.S. border was adjusted northward to include the strategically important site of \"Fort Blunder\" on the US side. In 1844, work was begun to replace the remains of the 1812-era fort with a massive new Third System masonry fortification, known as Fort Montgomery. Portions of this fort are still standing.\nModern history.\nIn the early 19th century, the construction of the Champlain Canal connected Lake Champlain to the Hudson River system, allowing north\u2013south commerce by water from New York City to Montreal and Atlantic Canada.\nIn 1909, 65,000 people celebrated the 300th anniversary of the French discovery of the lake. Attending dignitaries included President William Howard Taft, along with representatives from France, Canada and the United Kingdom.\nIn 1929, then-New York Governor Franklin Roosevelt and Vermont Governor John Weeks dedicated the first bridge to span the lake, built from Crown Point to Chimney Point. This bridge lasted until December 2009. Severe deterioration was found, and the bridge was demolished and replaced with the Lake Champlain Bridge, which opened in November 2011.\nOn February 19, 1932, boats were able to sail on Lake Champlain. It was the first time that the lake was known to be free of ice during the winter at that time.\nLake Champlain briefly became the nation's sixth Great Lake on March 6, 1998, when President Clinton signed Senate Bill 927. This bill, which was led by U.S. Senator Patrick Leahy of Vermont and reauthorized the National Sea Grant Program, contained a line declaring Lake Champlain to be a Great Lake. This status enabled its neighboring states to apply for additional federal research and education funds allocated to these national resources. However, following a small uproar, the Great Lake status was rescinded on March 24 (although New York and Vermont universities continue to receive funds to monitor and study the lake).\n\"Champ\", Lake Champlain monster.\nIn 1609, Samuel de Champlain wrote that he saw a lake monster long, as thick as a man's thigh, with silver-gray scales a dagger could not penetrate. The alleged monster had jaws with sharp and dangerous teeth. Native Americans claimed to have seen similar monsters long. This mysterious creature is likely the original Lake Champlain monster. The monster has been memorialized in sports teams' names and mascots, e.g., Champ, the mascot of the Vermont Lake Monsters, the state's AAA baseball team. Champ is also commonly known as Nessie's American cousin due to similarities between the two cryptids. A Vermont Historical Society publication recounts the story and offers possible explanations for accounts of the so-called monster: \"floating logs, schools of large sturgeon diving in a row, or flocks of blackbirds flying close to the water\". In 2022, it was reported that a feature dramatic film, \"Lucy and the Lake Monster\", was in the works about a young orphan girl and her grandfather looking for Champ. The film was released in 2024, garnering accolades on the film festival circuit and streaming on Amazon Prime and other outlets.\nEcology.\nA pollution prevention, control and restoration plan for Lake Champlain was first endorsed in October 1996 by the governors of New York and Vermont and the regional administrators of the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). In April 2003, the plan was updated, and Quebec signed on to it. The plan is being implemented by the Lake Champlain Basin Program and its partners at the state, provincial, federal and local levels. Renowned as a model for interstate and international cooperation, its primary goals are to reduce phosphorus inputs to Lake Champlain, reduce toxic contamination, minimize the risks to humans from water-related health hazards and control the introduction, spread, and impact of non-native nuisance species to preserve the integrity of the Lake Champlain ecosystem.\nSenior staff who helped organize the Environmental Protection Agency in 1970 recall that International Paper was one of the first companies to call upon the brand-new agency, because it was being pressured by both New York and Vermont with regard to a discharge of pollution into Lake Champlain.\nAgricultural and urban runoff from the watershed or drainage basin is the primary source of excess phosphorus, which exacerbates algae blooms in Lake Champlain. The most problematic blooms have been cyanobacteria, commonly called blue-green algae, in the northeastern part of the lake: primarily Missisquoi Bay.\nTo reduce phosphorus runoff to this part of the lake, Vermont and Quebec agreed to reduce their inputs by 60% and 40%, respectively, by an agreement signed in 2002. While agricultural sources (manure and fertilizers) are the primary sources of phosphorus (about 70%) in the Missisquoi basin, runoff from developed land and suburbs is estimated to contribute about 46% of the phosphorus runoff basin-wide to Lake Champlain, and agricultural lands contributed about 38%.\nIn 2002, the cleanup plan noted that the lake had the capacity to absorb of phosphorus each year. In 2009, a judge noted that were still flowing in annually: more than twice what the lake could handle. Sixty municipal and industrial sewage plants discharge processed waste from the Vermont side.\nIn 2008, the EPA expressed concerns to the State of Vermont that the lake's cleanup was not progressing fast enough to meet the original cleanup goal of 2016. The state, however, cites its Clean and Clear Action Plan as a model that will produce positive results for Lake Champlain.\nIn 2007, Vermont banned phosphates for dishwasher use starting in 2010. This will prevent an estimated from flowing into the lake. While this represents 0.6% of the phosphate pollution, it took US$1.9\u00a0million to remove the pollutant from treated wastewater: an EPA requirement.\nDespite concerns about pollution, Lake Champlain is safe for swimming, fishing and boating. It is considered a world-class fishery for salmonidae species (lake trout and Atlantic salmon) and bass. About 81 fish species live in the lake, and more than 300 bird species rely on it for habitat and as a resource during migrations.\nBy 2008, at least seven institutions were monitoring lake water health:\nIn 2001, scientists estimated that farming contributed 38% of the phosphorus runoff. By 2010, results of environmentally-conscious farming practices, enforced by law, had made a positive contribution to lake cleanliness. A federally-funded study was started to analyze this problem and to arrive at a solution.\nBiologists have been trying to control lampreys in the lake since 1985 or earlier. Lampreys are native to the area, but have expanded in population to such an extent that they wounded nearly all lake trout in 2006, and 70\u201380% of salmon. The use of pesticides against the lamprey has reduced their damage to other fish to 35% of salmon and 31% of lake trout. The goal was 15% of salmon and 25% of lake trout.\nThe federal and state governments originally budgeted US$18\u00a0million for lake programs for 2010. This was later supplemented by an additional US$6.5\u00a0million from the federal government.\nNatural history.\nIn 2010, the estimated cormorant population, now classified as a nuisance species because they take so much of the lake fish, ranged from 14,000 to 16,000. A Fish and Wildlife commissioner said that the ideal population would be about 3,300, amounting to . Cormorants had disappeared from the lake (and all northern lakes) due to the use of DDT in the 1940s and 1950s, which made their eggs more fragile and reduced breeding populations.\nRing-billed gulls are also considered a nuisance, and measures have been taken to reduce their population. Authorities are trying to encourage the return of black-crowned night herons, cattle egrets and great blue herons, which disappeared during the time DDT was being widely used.\nIn 1989, UNESCO designated the area around Lake Champlain as the Champlain-Adirondack Biosphere Reserve.\nInfrastructure.\nLake crossings.\nThe Alburgh Peninsula (also known as the Alburgh Tongue), extending south from the Quebec shore of the lake into Vermont, and Province Point, the southernmost tip of a small promontory approximately in size a few miles to the northeast of the community of East Alburgh, Vermont, are connected by land to the rest of the state only via Canada. This is a distinction shared with the state of Alaska, Point Roberts, Washington, and the Northwest Angle in Minnesota. All of these are practical exclaves of the United States contiguous with Canada. Unlike the other cases, highway bridges across the lake provide direct access to the Alburgh peninsula from within the United States (from three directions), but Province Point is still accessible by land only through Canada.\nRoad.\nThree roadways cross the lake, two connecting New York and Vermont and one connecting two towns in New York:\nIn 2009, the bridge had been used by 3,400 drivers per day, and driving around the southern end of the lake added two hours to the trip. Ferry service was re-established to take some of the traffic burden. On December\u00a028, 2009, the bridge was destroyed by a controlled demolition. A new bridge was rapidly constructed by a joint state commitment, opening on November 7, 2011.\nFerry.\nNorth of Ticonderoga, New York, the lake widens appreciably; ferry service is operated by the Lake Champlain Transportation Company at:\nWhile the old bridge was being demolished and the new one constructed, Lake Champlain Transportation Company operated a free, 24-hour ferry from just south of the bridge to Chimney Point, Vermont, at the expense of the states of New York and Vermont, at a cost to the states of about $10 per car.\nThe most southerly crossing is the Fort Ticonderoga Ferry, connecting Ticonderoga, New York, with Shoreham, Vermont, just north of the historic fort.\nRailroad.\nFour significant railroad crossings were built over the lake. As of 2021, only one remains.\nNow called Colchester Park, the main causeway has been adapted and preserved as a recreation area for cyclists, runners and anglers. Two smaller marble tailings and granite rock landfill causeways were also erected as part of this line that connected Grand Isle to North Hero, and spanned from North Hero to Alburgh.\nWaterways.\nLake Champlain has been connected to the Erie Canal via the Champlain Canal since the canal's official opening on September\u00a09, 1823, the same day as the opening of the Erie Canal from Rochester on Lake Ontario to Albany. It connects to the St. Lawrence River via the Richelieu River, with the Chambly Canal bypassing rapids on the river since 1843. Together with these waterways, the lake is part of the Lakes to Locks Passage. The Lake Champlain Seaway, a project to use the lake to bring ocean-going ships from New York City to Montreal, was proposed in the late 19th century and considered as late as the 1960s, but rejected for various reasons. The lake is also part of the Northern Forest Canoe Trail, which begins in Old Forge, New York, and ends in Fort Kent, Maine.\nSurrounding area.\nMajor cities.\nBurlington, Vermont (pop. 44,743, 2020 census) is the largest city on the lake.

Untyped lambda calculus, the topic of this article, is a universal machine, a model of computation that can be used to simulate any Turing machine (and vice versa). It was introduced by the mathematician Alonzo Church in the 1930s as part of his research into the foundations of mathematics. In 1936, Church found a formulation which was logically consistent, and documented it in 1940.\nDefinition.\nThe lambda calculus consists of a language of lambda terms, that are defined by a certain formal syntax, and a set of transformation rules for manipulating the lambda terms. In BNF, the syntax is formula_1 where variables \"x\",\"y\",\"z\" range over an infinite set of names. Terms \"M\",\"N\",\"t\",\"s\",\"e\",\"f\" range over all lambda terms. This corresponds to the following inductive definition:\nA lambda term is syntactically valid if and only if it can be obtained by repeated application of these three rules. For convenience, parentheses can often be omitted when writing a lambda term\u2014see for details.\nIn the term formula_4, occurrences of x within M that are under the scope of this \u03bb are termed \"bound\"; any occurrence of a variable not bound by an enclosing \u03bb is \"free\". FV(M) is the set of free variables of M. The notation formula_5 denotes capture-avoiding substitution: substituting N for every free occurrence of x in M, while avoiding variable capture. This operation is defined inductively as follows:\nThere are several notions of \"equivalence\" and \"reduction\" that make it possible to reduce lambda terms to equivalent lambda terms.\nThe term \"redex\", short for \"reducible expression\", refers to subterms that can be reduced by one of the reduction rules. For example, (\u03bb\"x\".\"M\") \"N\" is a \u03b2-redex in expressing the substitution of \"N\" for \"x\" in \"M\". The expression to which a redex reduces is called its \"reduct\"; the reduct of (\u03bb\"x\".\"M\") \"N\" is \"M\"[\"x\" := \"N\"].\nExplanation and applications.\nLambda calculus is Turing complete, that is, it is a universal model of computation that can be used to simulate any Turing machine. Its namesake, the Greek letter lambda (\u03bb), is used in lambda expressions and lambda terms to denote binding a variable in a function.\nLambda calculus may be \"untyped\" or \"typed\". In typed lambda calculus, functions can be applied only if they are capable of accepting the given input's \"type\" of data. Typed lambda calculi are strictly \"weaker\" than the untyped lambda calculus, which is the primary subject of this article, in the sense that \"typed lambda calculi can express less\" than the untyped calculus can. On the other hand, more things can be proven with typed lambda calculi. For example, in simply typed lambda calculus, it is a theorem that every evaluation strategy terminates for every simply typed lambda-term, whereas evaluation of untyped lambda-terms need not terminate (see below). One reason there are many different typed lambda calculi has been the desire to do more (of what the untyped calculus can do) without giving up on being able to prove strong theorems about the calculus.\nLambda calculus has applications in many different areas in mathematics, philosophy, linguistics, and computer science. Lambda calculus has played an important role in the development of the theory of programming languages. Functional programming languages implement lambda calculus. Lambda calculus is also a current research topic in category theory.\nHistory.\nLambda calculus was introduced by mathematician Alonzo Church in the 1930s as part of an investigation into the foundations of mathematics. The original system was shown to be logically inconsistent in 1935 when Stephen Kleene and J. B. Rosser developed the Kleene\u2013Rosser paradox.\nSubsequently, in 1936 Church isolated and published just the portion relevant to computation, what is now called the untyped lambda calculus. In 1940, he also introduced a computationally weaker, but logically consistent system, known as the simply typed lambda calculus.\nUntil the 1960s when its relation to programming languages was clarified, the lambda calculus was only a formalism. Thanks to Richard Montague and other linguists' applications in the semantics of natural language, the lambda calculus has begun to enjoy a respectable place in both linguistics and computer science.\nOrigin of the \"\u03bb\" symbol.\nThere is some uncertainty over the reason for Church's use of the Greek letter lambda (\u03bb) as the notation for function-abstraction in the lambda calculus, perhaps in part due to conflicting explanations by Church himself. According to Cardone and Hindley (2006):\nBy the way, why did Church choose the notation \"\u03bb\"? In [an unpublished 1964 letter to Harald Dickson] he stated clearly that it came from the notation \"formula_37\" used for class-abstraction by Whitehead and Russell, by first modifying \"formula_37\" to \"formula_39\" to distinguish function-abstraction from class-abstraction, and then changing \"formula_40\" to \"\u03bb\" for ease of printing.\nThis origin was also reported in [Rosser, 1984, p.338]. On the other hand, in his later years Church told two enquirers that the choice was more accidental: a symbol was needed and \u03bb just happened to be chosen.\nDana Scott has also addressed this question in various public lectures.\nScott recounts that he once posed a question about the origin of the lambda symbol to Church's former student and son-in-law John W. Addison Jr., who then wrote his father-in-law a postcard:\nDear Professor Church,\nRussell had the iota operator, Hilbert had the epsilon operator. Why did you choose lambda for your operator?\nAccording to Scott, Church's entire response consisted of returning the postcard with the following annotation: \"eeny, meeny, miny, moe\".\nMotivation.\nComputable functions are a fundamental concept within computer science and mathematics. The lambda calculus provides simple semantics for computation which are useful for formally studying properties of computation. The lambda calculus incorporates two simplifications that make its semantics simple.\nThe first simplification is that the lambda calculus treats functions \"anonymously\"; it does not give them explicit names. For example, the function\n formula_41\ncan be rewritten in \"anonymous form\" as\n formula_42\n(which is read as \"a tuple of x and y is mapped to formula_43\"). Similarly, the function\n formula_44\ncan be rewritten in anonymous form as\n formula_45\nwhere the input is simply mapped to itself.\nThe second simplification is that the lambda calculus only uses functions of a single input. An ordinary function that requires two inputs, for instance the formula_46 function, can be reworked into an equivalent function that accepts a single input, and as output returns \"another\" function, that in turn accepts a single input. For example,\n formula_42\ncan be reworked into\n formula_48\nThis method, known as currying, transforms a function that takes multiple arguments into a chain of functions each with a single argument.\nFunction application of the formula_46 function to the arguments (5, 2), yields at once\n formula_50\n formula_51\n formula_52,\nwhereas evaluation of the curried version requires one more step\n formula_53\n formula_54 // the definition of formula_13 has been used with formula_56 in the inner expression. This is like \u03b2-reduction.\n formula_57 // the definition of formula_58 has been used with formula_59. Again, similar to \u03b2-reduction.\n formula_60\nto arrive at the same result.\nIn lambda calculus, functions are taken to be 'first class values', so functions may be used as the inputs, or be returned as outputs from other functions. For example, the lambda term formula_24 represents the identity function, formula_45. Further, formula_63 represents the \"constant function\" formula_64, the function that always returns formula_58, no matter the input. As an example of a function operating on functions, the function composition can be defined as formula_66.\nNormal forms and confluence.\nIt can be shown that \u03b2-reduction is confluent when working up to \u03b1-conversion (i.e. we consider two normal forms to be equal if it is possible to \u03b1-convert one into the other). If repeated application of the reduction steps eventually terminates, then by the Church\u2013Rosser theorem it will produce a unique \u03b2-normal form. However, the untyped lambda calculus as a rewriting rule under \u03b2-reduction is neither strongly normalising nor weakly normalising; there are terms with no normal form such as \u03a9.\nConsidering individual terms, both strongly normalising terms and weakly normalising terms have a unique normal form. For strongly normalising terms, any reduction strategy is guaranteed to yield the normal form, whereas for weakly normalising terms, some reduction strategies may fail to find it.\nEncoding datatypes.\nThe basic lambda calculus may be used to model arithmetic, Booleans, data structures, and recursion, as illustrated in the following sub-sections \"i\", \"ii\", \"iii\", and \"\u00a7 iv\".\nArithmetic in lambda calculus.\nThere are several possible ways to define the natural numbers in lambda calculus, but by far the most common are the Church numerals, which can be defined as follows:\n 0 := \u03bb\"f\".\u03bb\"x\".\"x\"\n 1 := \u03bb\"f\".\u03bb\"x\".\"f\" \"x\"\n 2 := \u03bb\"f\".\u03bb\"x\".\"f\" (\"f\" \"x\")\n 3 := \u03bb\"f\".\u03bb\"x\".\"f\" (\"f\" (\"f\" \"x\"))\nand so on. Or using an alternative syntax allowing multiple uncurried arguments to a function:\n 0 := \u03bb\"fx\".\"x\"\n 1 := \u03bb\"fx\".\"f\" \"x\"\n 2 := \u03bb\"fx\".\"f\" (\"f\" \"x\")\n 3 := \u03bb\"fx\".\"f\" (\"f\" (\"f\" \"x\"))\nA Church numeral is a higher-order function\u2014it takes a single-argument function \"f\", and returns another single-argument function. The Church numeral \"n\" is a function that takes a function \"f\" as argument and returns the \"n\"-th composition of \"f\", i.e. the function \"f\" composed with itself \"n\" times. This is denoted \"f\"(\"n\") and is in fact the \"n\"-th power of \"f\" (considered as an operator); \"f\"(0) is defined to be the identity function. Functional composition is associative, and so, such repeated compositions of a single function \"f\" obey two laws of exponents, \"f\"(\"m\")\u2218\"f\"(\"n\") \n \"f\"(\"m+n\") and (\"f\"(\"n\"))(\"m\") \n \"f\"(\"m*n\"), which is why these numerals can be used for arithmetic. (In Church's original lambda calculus, the formal parameter of a lambda expression was required to occur at least once in the function body, which made the above definition of 0 impossible.)\nOne way of thinking about the Church numeral \"n\", which is often useful when analyzing programs, is as an instruction 'repeat \"n\" times'. For example, using the PAIR and NIL functions defined below, one can define a function that constructs a (linked) list of \"n\" elements all equal to \"x\" by repeating 'prepend another \"x\" element' \"n\" times, starting from an empty list. The lambda term \n \u03bb\"n\".\u03bb\"x\".\"n\" (PAIR \"x\") NIL\ncreates, given a Church numeral \"n\" and some \"x\", a sequence of \"n\" applications\n PAIR \"x\" (PAIR \"x\"...(PAIR \"x\" NIL)...)\nBy varying what is being repeated, and what argument(s) that function being repeated is applied to, a great many different effects can be achieved.\nWe can define a successor function, which takes a Church numeral \"n\" and returns its successor \"n\" + 1 by performing one additional application of the function \"f\" it is supplied with, where (\"n f x\") means \"\"n\" applications of \"f\" starting from \"x\"\":\n SUCC := \u03bb\"n\".\u03bb\"f\".\u03bb\"x\".\"f\" (\"n\" \"f\" \"x\")\nBecause the \"m\"-th composition of \"f\" composed with the \"n\"-th composition of \"f\" gives the \"m\"+\"n\"-th composition of \"f\", \"f\"(\"m\")\u2218\"f\"(\"n\") \n \"f\"(\"m+n\"), addition can be defined as \n PLUS := \u03bb\"m\".\u03bb\"n\".\u03bb\"f\".\u03bb\"x\".\"m\" \"f\" (\"n\" \"f\" \"x\")\nPLUS can be thought of as a function taking two natural numbers as arguments and returning a natural number; it can be verified that\n PLUS 2 3\nand\n 5\nare beta-equivalent lambda expressions. Since adding \"m\" to a number can be accomplished by repeating the successor operation \"m\" times, an alternative definition is:\n PLUS\u2032 := \u03bb\"m\".\u03bb\"n\".\"m\" SUCC \"n \"\nSimilarly, following (\"f\"(\"n\"))(\"m\") \n \"f\"(\"m*n\"), multiplication can be defined as\n MULT := \u03bb\"m\".\u03bb\"n\".\u03bb\"f\".\"m\" (\"n\" \"f\")\nThus multiplication of Church numerals is simply their composition as functions. Alternatively\n MULT\u2032 := \u03bb\"m\".\u03bb\"n\".\"m\" (PLUS \"n\") 0\nsince multiplying \"m\" and \"n\" is the same as adding \"n\" repeatedly, \"m\" times, starting from zero.\nExponentiation, being the repeated multiplication of a number with itself, translates as a repeated composition of a Church numeral with itself, as a function. And repeated composition is what Church numerals \"are\": \n POW := \u03bb\"b\".\u03bb\"n\".\"n\" \"b\"\nAlternatively here as well,\n POW\u2032 := \u03bb\"b\".\u03bb\"n\".\"n\" (MULT \"b\") 1\nSimplifying, it becomes\n POW\u2032\u2032 := \u03bb\"b\".\u03bb\"n\".\u03bb\"f\".\"n\" \"b\" \"f\"\nbut that is just an eta-expanded version of POW we already have, above.\nThe \"predecessor\" function, specified by two equations PRED (SUCC \"n\") = \"n\" and PRED 0 = 0, is considerably more involved. The formula\n PRED := \u03bb\"n\".\u03bb\"f\".\u03bb\"x\".\"n\" (\u03bb\"g\".\u03bb\"h\".\"h\" (\"g\" \"f\")) (\u03bb\"u\".\"x\") (\u03bb\"u\".\"u\")\ncan be validated by showing inductively that if \"T\" denotes (\u03bb\"g\".\u03bb\"h\".\"h\" (\"g\" \"f\")), then T(\"n\")(\u03bb\"u\".\"x\") = (\u03bb\"h\".\"h\"(\"f\"(\"n\"\u22121)(\"x\"))) for \"n\" &gt; 0. Two other definitions of PRED are given below, one using conditionals and the other using pairs. With the predecessor function, subtraction is straightforward. Defining\n SUB := \u03bb\"m\".\u03bb\"n\".\"n\" PRED \"m\",\nSUB \"m\" \"n\" yields \"m\" \u2212 \"n\" when \"m\" &gt; \"n\" and 0 otherwise.\nLogic and predicates.\nBy convention, the following two definitions (known as Church Booleans) are used for the Boolean values TRUE and FALSE:\n TRUE := \u03bb\"x\".\u03bb\"y\".\"x\"\n FALSE := \u03bb\"x\".\u03bb\"y\".\"y\"\nThen, with these two lambda terms, we can define some logic operators (these are just possible formulations; other expressions could be equally correct):\n AND := \u03bb\"p\".\u03bb\"q\".\"p\" \"q\" \"p\"\n OR := \u03bb\"p\".\u03bb\"q\".\"p\" \"p\" \"q\"\n NOT := \u03bb\"p\".\"p\" FALSE TRUE\n IFTHENELSE := \u03bb\"p\".\u03bb\"a\".\u03bb\"b\".\"p\" \"a\" \"b\"\nWe are now able to compute some logic functions, for example:\n AND TRUE FALSE\n \u2261 (\u03bb\"p\".\u03bb\"q\".\"p\" \"q\" \"p\") TRUE FALSE \u2192\u03b2 TRUE FALSE TRUE\n \u2261 (\u03bb\"x\".\u03bb\"y\".\"x\") FALSE TRUE \u2192\u03b2 FALSE\nand we see that AND TRUE FALSE is equivalent to FALSE.\nA \"predicate\" is a function that returns a Boolean value. The most fundamental predicate is ISZERO, which returns TRUE if its argument is the Church numeral 0, but FALSE if its argument were any other Church numeral:\n ISZERO := \u03bb\"n\".\"n\" (\u03bb\"x\".FALSE) TRUE\nThe following predicate tests whether the first argument is less-than-or-equal-to the second:\n LEQ := \u03bb\"m\".\u03bb\"n\".ISZERO (SUB \"m\" \"n\"),\nand since \"m\" = \"n\", if LEQ \"m\" \"n\" and LEQ \"n\" \"m\", it is straightforward to build a predicate for numerical equality.\nThe availability of predicates and the above definition of TRUE and FALSE make it convenient to write \"if-then-else\" expressions in lambda calculus. For example, the predecessor function can be defined as:\n PRED := \u03bb\"n\".\"n\" (\u03bb\"g\".\u03bb\"k\".ISZERO (\"g\" 1) \"k\" (PLUS (\"g\" \"k\") 1)) (\u03bb\"v\".0) 0\nwhich can be verified by showing inductively that \"n\" (\u03bb\"g\".\u03bb\"k\".ISZERO (\"g\" 1) \"k\" (PLUS (\"g\" \"k\") 1)) (\u03bb\"v\".0) is the add \"n\" \u2212 1 function for \"n\" &gt; 0.\nPairs.\nA pair (2-tuple) can be defined in terms of TRUE and FALSE, by using the Church encoding for pairs. For example, PAIR encapsulates the pair (\"x\",\"y\"), FIRST returns the first element of the pair, and SECOND returns the second.\n PAIR := \u03bb\"x\".\u03bb\"y\".\u03bb\"f\".\"f\" \"x\" \"y\"\n FIRST := \u03bb\"p\".\"p\" TRUE\n SECOND := \u03bb\"p\".\"p\" FALSE\n NIL := \u03bb\"x\".TRUE\n NULL := \u03bb\"p\".\"p\" (\u03bb\"x\".\u03bb\"y\".FALSE)\nA linked list can be defined as either NIL for the empty list, or the PAIR of an element and a smaller list. The predicate NULL tests for the value NIL. (Alternatively, with NIL := FALSE, the construct \"l\" (\u03bb\"h\".\u03bb\"t\".\u03bb\"z\".deal_with_head_\"h\"_and_tail_\"t\") (deal_with_nil) obviates the need for an explicit NULL test).\nAs an example of the use of pairs, the shift-and-increment function that maps (\"m\", \"n\") to (\"n\", \"n\" + 1) can be defined as\n \u03a6 := \u03bb\"x\".PAIR (SECOND \"x\") (SUCC (SECOND \"x\"))\nwhich allows us to give perhaps the most transparent version of the predecessor function:\n PRED := \u03bb\"n\".FIRST (\"n\" \u03a6 (PAIR 0 0)).\nAdditional programming techniques.\nThere is a considerable body of programming idioms for lambda calculus. Many of these were originally developed in the context of using lambda calculus as a foundation for programming language semantics, effectively using lambda calculus as a low-level programming language. Because several programming languages include the lambda calculus (or something very similar) as a fragment, these techniques also see use in practical programming, but may then be perceived as obscure or foreign.\nNamed constants.\nIn lambda calculus, a library would take the form of a collection of previously defined functions, which as lambda-terms are merely particular constants. The pure lambda calculus does not have a concept of named constants since all atomic lambda-terms are variables, but one can emulate having named constants by setting aside a variable as the name of the constant, using abstraction to bind that variable in the main body, and apply that abstraction to the intended definition. Thus to use \"f\" to mean \"N\" (some explicit lambda-term) in \"M\" (another lambda-term, the \"main program\"), one can say\n (\u03bb\"f\".\"M\") \"N\"\nAuthors often introduce syntactic sugar, such as let, to permit writing the above in the more intuitive order\n let \"f\" = \"N\" in \"M\"\nBy chaining such definitions, one can write a lambda calculus \"program\" as zero or more function definitions, followed by one lambda-term using those functions that constitutes the main body of the program.\nA notable restriction of this let is that the name \"f\" may not be referenced in \"N\", for \"N\" is outside the scope of the abstraction binding \"f\", which is \"M\"; this means a recursive function definition cannot be written with let. The letrec construction would allow writing recursive function definitions, where the scope of the abstraction binding \"f\" includes \"N\" as well as \"M\". Or self-application a-la that which leads to Y combinator could be used.\nRecursion and fixed points.\nRecursion is when a function invokes itself. What would a value be which were to represent such a function? It has to refer to itself somehow inside itself, just as the definition refers to itself inside itself. If this value were to contain itself by value, it would have to be of infinite size, which is impossible. Other notations, which support recursion natively, overcome this by referring to the function \"by name\" inside its definition. Lambda calculus cannot express this, since in it there simply are no names for terms to begin with, only arguments' names, i.e. parameters in abstractions. Thus, a lambda expression can receive itself as its argument and refer to (a copy of) itself via the corresponding parameter's name. This will work fine in case it was indeed called with itself as an argument. For example, (\u03bb\"x\".\"x\" \"x\") \"E\" \n (\"E E\") will express recursion when \"E\" is an abstraction which is applying its parameter to itself inside its body to express a recursive call. Since this parameter receives \"E\" as its value, its self-application will be the same (\"E E\") again.\nAs a concrete example, consider the factorial function F(\"n\"), recursively defined by\n F(\"n\") = 1, if \"n\" = 0; else \"n\" \u00d7 F(\"n\" \u2212 1).\nIn the lambda expression which is to represent this function, a \"parameter\" (typically the first one) will be assumed to receive the lambda expression itself as its value, so that calling it with itself as its first argument will amount to the recursive call. Thus to achieve recursion, the intended-as-self-referencing argument (called \"s\" here, reminiscent of \"self\", or \"self-applying\") must always be passed to itself within the function body at a recursive call point:\n E := \u03bb\"s\". \u03bb\"n\".(1, if \"n\" = 0; else \"n\" \u00d7 (\"s\" \"s\" (\"n\"\u22121)))\n with \"s s n\" = F \"n\" = E E \"n\" to hold, so \"s\" \n E and\n F := (\u03bb\"x\".\"x\" \"x\") E = E E\nand we have\n F = E E = \u03bb\"n\".(1, if \"n\" = 0; else \"n\" \u00d7 (E E (\"n\"\u22121)))\nHere \"s s\" becomes \"the same\" (E E) inside the result of the application (E E), and using the same function for a call is the definition of what recursion is. The self-application achieves replication here, passing the function's lambda expression on to the next invocation as an argument value, making it available to be referenced there by the parameter name \"s\" to be called via the self-application \"s\" \"s\", again and again as needed, each time \"re-creating\" the lambda-term F \n E E. \nThe application is an additional step just as the name lookup would be. It has the same delaying effect. Instead of having F inside itself as a whole \"up-front\", delaying its re-creation until the next call makes its existence possible by having two \"finite\" lambda-terms E inside it re-create it on the fly \"later\" as needed.\nThis self-applicational approach solves it, but requires re-writing each recursive call as a self-application. We would like to have a generic solution, without the need for any re-writes:\n G := \u03bb\"r\". \u03bb\"n\".(1, if \"n\" = 0; else \"n\" \u00d7 (\"r\" (\"n\"\u22121)))\n with \"r\" \"x\" = F \"x\" = G \"r\" \"x\" to hold, so \"r\" = G \"r\" =: FIX G and\n F := FIX G where FIX \"g\" = (\"r\" where \"r\" = \"g\" \"r\") = \"g\" (FIX \"g\")\n so that FIX G = G (FIX G) = (\u03bb\"n\".(1, if \"n\" = 0; else \"n\" \u00d7 ((FIX G) (\"n\"\u22121))))\nGiven a lambda term with first argument representing recursive call (e.g. G here), the \"fixed-point\" combinator FIX will return a self-replicating lambda expression representing the recursive function (here, F). The function does not need to be explicitly passed to itself at any point, for the self-replication is arranged in advance, when it is created, to be done each time it is called. Thus the original lambda expression (FIX G) is re-created inside itself, at call-point, achieving self-reference.\nIn fact, there are many possible definitions for this FIX operator, the simplest of them being:\n Y := \u03bb\"g\".(\u03bb\"x\".\"g\" (\"x\" \"x\")) (\u03bb\"x\".\"g\" (\"x\" \"x\"))\nIn the lambda calculus, Y \"g\" is a fixed-point of \"g\", as it expands to:\n Y \"g\"\n ~&gt; (\u03bb\"h\".(\u03bb\"x\".\"h\" (\"x\" \"x\")) (\u03bb\"x\".\"h\" (\"x\" \"x\"))) \"g\"\n ~&gt; (\u03bb\"x\".\"g\" (\"x\" \"x\")) (\u03bb\"x\".\"g\" (\"x\" \"x\"))\n ~&gt; \"g\" ((\u03bb\"x\".\"g\" (\"x\" \"x\")) (\u03bb\"x\".\"g\" (\"x\" \"x\")))\n &lt;~ \"g\" (Y \"g\")\nNow, to perform the recursive call to the factorial function for an argument \"n\", we would simply call (Y G) \"n\". Given \"n\" = 4, for example, this gives:\n (Y G) 4\n ~&gt; G (Y G) 4\n ~&gt; (\u03bb\"r\".\u03bb\"n\".(1, if \"n\" = 0; else \"n\" \u00d7 (\"r\" (\"n\"\u22121)))) (Y G) 4\n ~&gt; (\u03bb\"n\".(1, if \"n\" = 0; else \"n\" \u00d7 ((Y G) (\"n\"\u22121)))) 4\n ~&gt; 1, if 4 = 0; else 4 \u00d7 ((Y G) (4\u22121))\n ~&gt; 4 \u00d7 (G (Y G) (4\u22121))\n ~&gt; 4 \u00d7 ((\u03bb\"n\".(1, if \"n\" = 0; else \"n\" \u00d7 ((Y G) (\"n\"\u22121)))) (4\u22121))\n ~&gt; 4 \u00d7 (1, if 3 = 0; else 3 \u00d7 ((Y G) (3\u22121)))\n ~&gt; 4 \u00d7 (3 \u00d7 (G (Y G) (3\u22121)))\n ~&gt; 4 \u00d7 (3 \u00d7 ((\u03bb\"n\".(1, if \"n\" = 0; else \"n\" \u00d7 ((Y G) (\"n\"\u22121)))) (3\u22121)))\n ~&gt; 4 \u00d7 (3 \u00d7 (1, if 2 = 0; else 2 \u00d7 ((Y G) (2\u22121))))\n ~&gt; 4 \u00d7 (3 \u00d7 (2 \u00d7 (G (Y G) (2\u22121))))\n ~&gt; 4 \u00d7 (3 \u00d7 (2 \u00d7 ((\u03bb\"n\".(1, if \"n\" = 0; else \"n\" \u00d7 ((Y G) (\"n\"\u22121)))) (2\u22121))))\n ~&gt; 4 \u00d7 (3 \u00d7 (2 \u00d7 (1, if 1 = 0; else 1 \u00d7 ((Y G) (1\u22121)))))\n ~&gt; 4 \u00d7 (3 \u00d7 (2 \u00d7 (1 \u00d7 (G (Y G) (1\u22121)))))\n ~&gt; 4 \u00d7 (3 \u00d7 (2 \u00d7 (1 \u00d7 ((\u03bb\"n\".(1, if \"n\" = 0; else \"n\" \u00d7 ((Y G) (\"n\"\u22121)))) (1\u22121)))))\n ~&gt; 4 \u00d7 (3 \u00d7 (2 \u00d7 (1 \u00d7 (1, if 0 = 0; else 0 \u00d7 ((Y G) (0\u22121))))))\n ~&gt; 4 \u00d7 (3 \u00d7 (2 \u00d7 (1 \u00d7 (1))))\n ~&gt; 24\nEvery recursively defined function can be seen as a fixed point of some suitably defined higher order function (also known as functional) closing over the recursive call with an extra argument. Therefore, using Y, every recursive function can be expressed as a lambda expression. In particular, we can now cleanly define the subtraction, multiplication, and comparison predicates of natural numbers, using recursion.\nWhen Y combinator is coded directly in a strict programming language, the applicative order of evaluation used in such languages will cause an attempt to fully expand the internal self-application formula_67 prematurely, causing stack overflow or, in case of tail call optimization, indefinite looping. A delayed variant of Y, the Z combinator, can be used in such languages. It has the internal self-application hidden behind an extra abstraction through eta-expansion, as formula_68, thus preventing its premature expansion:\n formula_69\nStandard terms.\nCertain terms have commonly accepted names:\n I := \u03bb\"x\".\"x\"\n S := \u03bb\"x\".\u03bb\"y\".\u03bb\"z\".\"x\" \"z\" (\"y\" \"z\")\n K := \u03bb\"x\".\u03bb\"y\".\"x\"\n B := \u03bb\"x\".\u03bb\"y\".\u03bb\"z\".\"x\" (\"y\" \"z\")\n C := \u03bb\"x\".\u03bb\"y\".\u03bb\"z\".\"x\" \"z\" \"y\"\n W := \u03bb\"x\".\u03bb\"y\".\"x\" \"y\" \"y\"\n \u03c9 or \u0394 or U := \u03bb\"x\".\"x\" \"x\"\n \u03a9 := \u03c9 \u03c9\nI is the identity function. SK and BCKW form complete combinator calculus systems that can express any lambda term - see \nthe next section. \u03a9 is UU, the smallest term that has no normal form. YI is another such term.\nY is standard and defined above, and can also be defined as Y\nBU(CBU), so that Yg\ng(Yg). TRUE and FALSE defined above are commonly abbreviated as T and F.\nAbstraction elimination.\nIf \"N\" is a lambda-term without abstraction, but possibly containing named constants (combinators), then there exists a lambda-term \"T\"(\"x\",\"N\") which is equivalent to \u03bb\"x\".\"N\" but lacks abstraction (except as part of the named constants, if these are considered non-atomic). This can also be viewed as anonymising variables, as \"T\"(\"x\",\"N\") removes all occurrences of \"x\" from \"N\", while still allowing argument values to be substituted into the positions where \"N\" contains an \"x\". The conversion function \"T\" can be defined by:\n \"T\"(\"x\", \"x\") := I\n \"T\"(\"x\", \"N\") := K \"N\" if \"x\" is not free in \"N\".\n \"T\"(\"x\", \"M\" \"N\") := S \"T\"(\"x\", \"M\") \"T\"(\"x\", \"N\")\nIn either case, a term of the form \"T\"(\"x\",\"N\") \"P\" can reduce by having the initial combinator I, K, or S grab the argument \"P\", just like \u03b2-reduction of (\u03bb\"x\".\"N\") \"P\" would do. I returns that argument. K throws the argument away, just like (\u03bb\"x\".\"N\") would do if \"x\" has no free occurrence in \"N\". S passes the argument on to both subterms of the application, and then applies the result of the first to the result of the second.\nThe combinators B and C are similar to S, but pass the argument on to only one subterm of an application (B to the \"argument\" subterm and C to the \"function\" subterm), thus saving a subsequent K if there is no occurrence of \"x\" in one subterm. In comparison to B and C, the S combinator actually conflates two functionalities: rearranging arguments, and duplicating an argument so that it may be used in two places. The W combinator does only the latter, yielding the B, C, K, W system as an alternative to SKI combinator calculus.\nTyped lambda calculus.\nA \"typed lambda calculus\" is a typed formalism that uses the lambda-symbol (formula_70) to denote anonymous function abstraction. In this context, types are usually objects of a syntactic nature that are assigned to lambda terms; the exact nature of a type depends on the calculus considered (see Kinds of typed lambda calculi). From a certain point of view, typed lambda calculi can be seen as refinements of the untyped lambda calculus but from another point of view, they can also be considered the more fundamental theory and \"untyped lambda calculus\" a special case with only one type.\nTyped lambda calculi are foundational programming languages and are the base of typed functional programming languages such as ML and Haskell and, more indirectly, typed imperative programming languages. Typed lambda calculi play an important role in the design of type systems for programming languages; here typability usually captures desirable properties of the program, e.g., the program will not cause a memory access violation.\nTyped lambda calculi are closely related to mathematical logic and proof theory via the Curry\u2013Howard isomorphism and they can be considered as the internal language of classes of categories, e.g., the simply typed lambda calculus is the language of a Cartesian closed category (CCC).\nReduction strategies.\nWhether a term is normalising or not, and how much work needs to be done in normalising it if it is, depends to a large extent on the reduction strategy used. Common lambda calculus reduction strategies include:\nWeak reduction strategies do not reduce under lambda abstractions:\nStrategies with sharing reduce computations that are \"the same\" in parallel:\nComputability.\nThere is no algorithm that takes as input any two lambda expressions and outputs TRUE or FALSE depending on whether one expression reduces to the other. More precisely, no computable function can decide the question. This was historically the first problem for which undecidability could be proven. As usual for such a proof, \"computable\" means computable by any model of computation that is Turing complete. In fact computability can itself be defined via the lambda calculus: a function \"F\": N \u2192 N of natural numbers is a computable function if and only if there exists a lambda expression \"f\" such that for every pair of \"x\", \"y\" in N, \"F\"(\"x\")=\"y\" if and only if \"f\" \"x\"\u00a0=\u03b2\u00a0\"y\", where \"x\" and \"y\" are the Church numerals corresponding to \"x\" and \"y\", respectively and =\u03b2 meaning equivalence with \u03b2-reduction. See the Church\u2013Turing thesis for other approaches to defining computability and their equivalence.\nChurch's proof of uncomputability first reduces the problem to determining whether a given lambda expression has a normal form. Then he assumes that this predicate is computable, and can hence be expressed in lambda calculus. Building on earlier work by Kleene and constructing a G\u00f6del numbering for lambda expressions, he constructs a lambda expression \"e\" that closely follows the proof of G\u00f6del's first incompleteness theorem. If \"e\" is applied to its own G\u00f6del number, a contradiction results.\nComplexity.\nThe notion of computational complexity for the lambda calculus is a bit tricky, because the cost of a \u03b2-reduction may vary depending on how it is implemented. \nTo be precise, one must somehow find the location of all of the occurrences of the bound variable \"V\" in the expression \"E\", implying a time cost, or one must keep track of the locations of free variables in some way, implying a space cost. A na\u00efve search for the locations of \"V\" in \"E\" is \"O\"(\"n\") in the length \"n\" of \"E\". Director strings were an early approach that traded this time cost for a quadratic space usage. More generally this has led to the study of systems that use explicit substitution.\nIn 2014, it was shown that the number of \u03b2-reduction steps taken by normal order reduction to reduce a term is a \"reasonable\" time cost model, that is, the reduction can be simulated on a Turing machine in time polynomially proportional to the number of steps. This was a long-standing open problem, due to \"size explosion\", the existence of lambda terms which grow exponentially in size for each \u03b2-reduction. The result gets around this by working with a compact shared representation. The result makes clear that the amount of space needed to evaluate a lambda term is not proportional to the size of the term during reduction. It is not currently known what a good measure of space complexity would be.\nAn unreasonable model does not necessarily mean inefficient. Optimal reduction reduces all computations with the same label in one step, avoiding duplicated work, but the number of parallel \u03b2-reduction steps to reduce a given term to normal form is approximately linear in the size of the term. This is far too small to be a reasonable cost measure, as any Turing machine may be encoded in the lambda calculus in size linearly proportional to the size of the Turing machine. The true cost of reducing lambda terms is not due to \u03b2-reduction per se but rather the handling of the duplication of redexes during \u03b2-reduction. It is not known if optimal reduction implementations are reasonable when measured with respect to a reasonable cost model such as the number of leftmost-outermost steps to normal form, but it has been shown for fragments of the lambda calculus that the optimal reduction algorithm is efficient and has at most a quadratic overhead compared to leftmost-outermost. In addition the BOHM prototype implementation of optimal reduction outperformed both Caml Light and Haskell on pure lambda terms.\nLambda calculus and programming languages.\nAs pointed out by Peter Landin's 1965 paper \"A Correspondence between ALGOL 60 and Church's Lambda-notation\", sequential procedural programming languages can be understood in terms of the lambda calculus, which provides the basic mechanisms for procedural abstraction and procedure (subprogram) application.\nAnonymous functions.\nFor example, in Python the \"square\" function can be expressed as a lambda expression as follows:\nThe above example is an expression that evaluates to a first-class function. The symbol codice_1 creates an anonymous function, given a list of parameter names\u2014just the single argument codice_2, in this case\u2014and an expression that is evaluated as the body of the function, codice_3. Anonymous functions are sometimes called \"lambda expressions.\"\nPascal and many other imperative languages have long supported passing subprograms as arguments to other subprograms through the mechanism of function pointers. However, function pointers are an insufficient condition for functions to be first class datatypes, because a function is a first class datatype if and only if new instances of the function can be created at runtime. Such runtime creation of functions is supported in Smalltalk, JavaScript, Wolfram Language, and more recently in Scala, Eiffel (as agents), C# (as delegates) and C++11, among others.\nParallelism and concurrency.\nThe Church\u2013Rosser property of the lambda calculus means that evaluation (\u03b2-reduction) can be carried out in \"any order\", even in parallel. This means that various nondeterministic evaluation strategies are relevant. However, the lambda calculus does not offer any explicit constructs for parallelism. One can add constructs such as futures to the lambda calculus. Other process calculi have been developed for describing communication and concurrency.\nSemantics.\nThe fact that lambda calculus terms act as functions on other lambda calculus terms, and even on themselves, led to questions about the semantics of the lambda calculus. Could a sensible meaning be assigned to lambda calculus terms? The natural semantics was to find a set \"D\" isomorphic to the function space \"D\" \u2192 \"D\", of functions on itself. However, no nontrivial such \"D\" can exist, by cardinality constraints because the set of all functions from \"D\" to \"D\" has greater cardinality than \"D\", unless \"D\" is a singleton set.\nIn the 1970s, Dana Scott showed that if only continuous functions were considered, a set or domain \"D\" with the required property could be found, thus providing a model for the lambda calculus.\nThis work also formed the basis for the denotational semantics of programming languages.\nVariations and extensions.\nThese extensions are in the lambda cube:\nThese formal systems are extensions of lambda calculus that are not in the lambda cube:\nThese formal systems are variations of lambda calculus:\nThese formal systems are related to lambda calculus:\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n\"Some parts of this article are based on material from FOLDOC, used with .\"\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

These techniques are used to reduce data size for storing, handling, and transmitting content. Higher degrees of approximation create coarser images as more details are removed. This is opposed to lossless data compression (reversible data compression) which does not degrade the data. The amount of data reduction possible using lossy compression is much higher than using lossless techniques.\nWell-designed lossy compression technology often reduces file sizes significantly before degradation is noticed by the end-user. Even when noticeable by the user, further data reduction may be desirable (e.g., for real-time communication or to reduce transmission times or storage needs). The most widely used lossy compression algorithm is the discrete cosine transform (DCT), first published by Nasir Ahmed, T. Natarajan and K. R. Rao in 1974.\nLossy compression is most commonly used to compress multimedia data (audio, video, and images), especially in applications such as streaming media and internet telephony. By contrast, lossless compression is typically required for text and data files, such as bank records and text articles. It can be advantageous to make a master lossless file which can then be used to produce additional copies from. This allows one to avoid basing new compressed copies on a lossy source file, which would yield additional artifacts and further unnecessary information loss.\nTypes.\nIt is possible to compress many types of digital data in a way that reduces the size of a computer file needed to store it, or the bandwidth needed to transmit it, with no loss of the full information contained in the original file. A picture, for example, is converted to a digital file by considering it to be an array of dots and specifying the color and brightness of each dot. If the picture contains an area of the same color, it can be compressed without loss by saying \"200 red dots\" instead of \"red dot, red dot, ...(197 more times)..., red dot.\"\nThe original data contains a certain amount of information, and there is a lower bound to the size of a file that can still carry all the information. Basic information theory says that there is an absolute limit in reducing the size of this data. When data is compressed, its entropy increases, and it cannot increase indefinitely. For example, a compressed ZIP file is smaller than its original, but repeatedly compressing the same file will not reduce the size to nothing. Most compression algorithms can recognize when further compression would be pointless and would in fact increase the size of the data.\nIn many cases, files or data streams contain more information than is needed. For example, a picture may have more detail than the eye can distinguish when reproduced at the largest size intended; likewise, an audio file does not need a lot of fine detail during a very loud passage. Developing lossy compression techniques as closely matched to human perception as possible is a complex task. Sometimes the ideal is a file that provides exactly the same perception as the original, with as much digital information as possible removed; other times, perceptible loss of quality is considered a valid tradeoff.\nThe terms \"irreversible\" and \"reversible\" are preferred over \"lossy\" and \"lossless\" respectively for some applications, such as medical image compression, to circumvent the negative implications of \"loss\". The type and amount of loss can affect the utility of the images. Artifacts or undesirable effects of compression may be clearly discernible yet the result still useful for the intended purpose. Or lossy compressed images may be 'visually lossless', or in the case of medical images, so-called diagnostically acceptable irreversible compression (DAIC) may have been applied.\nTransform coding.\nSome forms of lossy compression can be thought of as an application of transform coding, which is a type of data compression used for digital images, digital audio signals, and digital video. The transformation is typically used to enable better (more targeted) quantization. Knowledge of the application is used to choose information to discard, thereby lowering its bandwidth. The remaining information can then be compressed via a variety of methods. When the output is decoded, the result may not be identical to the original input, but is expected to be close enough for the purpose of the application.\nThe most common form of lossy compression is a transform coding method, the discrete cosine transform (DCT), which was first published by Nasir Ahmed, T. Natarajan and K. R. Rao in 1974. DCT is the most widely used form of lossy compression, for popular image compression formats (such as JPEG), video coding standards (such as MPEG and H.264/AVC) and audio compression formats (such as MP3 and AAC).\nIn the case of audio data, a popular form of transform coding is perceptual coding, which transforms the raw data to a domain that more accurately reflects the information content. For example, rather than expressing a sound file as the amplitude levels over time, one may express it as the frequency spectrum over time, which corresponds more accurately to human audio perception. While data reduction (compression, be it lossy or lossless) is a main goal of transform coding, it also allows other goals: one may represent data more accurately for the original amount of space \u2013 for example, in principle, if one starts with an analog or high-resolution digital master, an MP3 file of a given size should provide a better representation than a raw uncompressed audio in WAV or AIFF file of the same size. This is because uncompressed audio can only reduce file size by lowering bit rate or depth, whereas compressing audio can reduce size while maintaining bit rate and depth. This compression becomes a selective loss of the least significant data, rather than losing data across the board. Further, a transform coding may provide a better domain for manipulating or otherwise editing the data \u2013 for example, equalization of audio is most naturally expressed in the frequency domain (boost the bass, for instance) rather than in the raw time domain.\nFrom this point of view, perceptual encoding is not essentially about \"discarding\" data, but rather about a \"better representation\" of data. Another use is for backward compatibility and graceful degradation: in color television, encoding color via a luminance-chrominance transform domain (such as YUV) means that black-and-white sets display the luminance, while ignoring the color information. Another example is chroma subsampling: the use of color spaces such as YIQ, used in NTSC, allow one to reduce the resolution on the components to accord with human perception \u2013 humans have highest resolution for black-and-white (luma), lower resolution for mid-spectrum colors like yellow and green, and lowest for red and blues \u2013 thus NTSC displays approximately 350 pixels of luma per scanline, 150 pixels of yellow vs. green, and 50 pixels of blue vs. red, which are proportional to human sensitivity to each component.\nInformation loss.\nLossy compression formats suffer from generation loss: repeatedly compressing and decompressing the file will cause it to progressively lose quality. This is in contrast with lossless data compression, where data will not be lost via the use of such a procedure. Information-theoretical foundations for lossy data compression are provided by rate-distortion theory. Much like the use of probability in optimal coding theory, rate-distortion theory heavily draws on Bayesian estimation and decision theory in order to model perceptual distortion and even aesthetic judgment.\nThere are two basic lossy compression schemes:\nIn some systems the two techniques are combined, with transform codecs being used to compress the error signals generated by the predictive stage.\nComparison.\nThe advantage of lossy methods over lossless methods is that in some cases a lossy method can produce a much smaller compressed file than any lossless method, while still meeting the requirements of the application. Lossy methods are most often used for compressing sound, images or videos. This is because these types of data are intended for human interpretation where the mind can easily \"fill in the blanks\" or see past very minor errors or inconsistencies \u2013 ideally lossy compression is transparent (imperceptible), which can be verified via an ABX test. Data files using lossy compression are smaller in size and thus cost less to store and to transmit over the Internet, a crucial consideration for streaming video services such as Netflix and streaming audio services such as Spotify.\nTransparency.\nWhen a user acquires a lossily compressed file, (for example, to reduce download time) the retrieved file can be quite different from the original at the bit level while being indistinguishable to the human ear or eye for most practical purposes. Many compression methods focus on the idiosyncrasies of human physiology, taking into account, for instance, that the human eye can see only certain wavelengths of light. The psychoacoustic model describes how sound can be highly compressed without degrading perceived quality. Flaws caused by lossy compression that are noticeable to the human eye or ear are known as compression artifacts.\nCompression ratio.\nThe compression ratio (that is, the size of the compressed file compared to that of the uncompressed file) of lossy video codecs is nearly always far superior to that of the audio and still-image equivalents.\nTranscoding and editing.\nAn important caveat about lossy compression (formally transcoding), is that editing lossily compressed files causes digital generation loss from the re-encoding. This can be avoided by only producing lossy files from (lossless) originals and only editing (copies of) original files, such as images in raw image format instead of JPEG. If data which has been compressed lossily is decoded and compressed losslessly, the size of the result can be comparable with the size of the data before lossy compression, but the data already lost cannot be recovered. When deciding to use lossy conversion without keeping the original, format conversion may be needed in the future to achieve compatibility with software or devices (format shifting), or to avoid paying patent royalties for decoding or distribution of compressed files.\nEditing of lossy files.\nBy modifying the compressed data directly without decoding and re-encoding, some editing of lossily compressed files without degradation of quality is possible. Editing which reduces the file size as if it had been compressed to a greater degree, but without more loss than this, is sometimes also possible.\nJPEG.\nThe primary programs for lossless editing of JPEGs are codice_1, and the derived codice_2 (which also preserves Exif information), and http:// (which provides a Windows interface).\nThese allow the image to be cropped, rotated, flipped, and flopped, or even converted to grayscale (by dropping the chrominance channel). While unwanted information is destroyed, the quality of the remaining portion is unchanged.\nSome other transforms are possible to some extent, such as joining images with the same encoding (composing side by side, as on a grid) or pasting images such as logos onto existing images (both via http://), or scaling.\nSome changes can be made to the compression without re-encoding:\nThe freeware Windows-only IrfanView has some lossless JPEG operations in its codice_3 plugin.\nMetadata.\nMetadata, such as ID3 tags, Vorbis comments, or Exif information, can usually be modified or removed without modifying the underlying data.\nDownsampling/compressed representation scalability.\nOne may wish to downsample or otherwise decrease the resolution of the represented source signal and the quantity of data used for its compressed representation without re-encoding, as in bitrate peeling, but this functionality is not supported in all designs, as not all codecs encode data in a form that allows less important detail to simply be dropped. Some well-known designs that have this capability include JPEG 2000 for still images and H.264/MPEG-4 AVC based Scalable Video Coding for video. Such schemes have also been standardized for older designs as well, such as JPEG images with progressive encoding, and MPEG-2 and MPEG-4 Part 2 video, although those prior schemes had limited success in terms of adoption into real-world common usage. Without this capacity, which is often the case in practice, to produce a representation with lower resolution or lower fidelity than a given one, one needs to start with the original source signal and encode, or start with a compressed representation and then decompress and re-encode it (transcoding), though the latter tends to cause digital generation loss.\nAnother approach is to encode the original signal at several different bitrates, and then either choose which to use (as when streaming over the internet \u2013 as in RealNetworks' \"SureStream\" \u2013 or offering varying downloads, as at Apple's iTunes Store), or broadcast several, where the best that is successfully received is used, as in various implementations of hierarchical modulation. Similar techniques are used in mipmaps, pyramid representations, and more sophisticated scale space methods. Some audio formats feature a combination of a lossy format and a lossless correction which when combined reproduce the original signal; the correction can be stripped, leaving a smaller, lossily compressed, file. Such formats include MPEG-4 SLS (Scalable to Lossless), WavPack, OptimFROG DualStream, and DTS-HD Master Audio in lossless (XLL) mode).\nMethods.\nOther data.\nResearchers have performed lossy compression on text by either using a thesaurus to substitute short words for long ones, or generative text techniques, although these sometimes fall into the related category of lossy data conversion.\nLowering resolution.\nA general kind of lossy compression is to lower the resolution of an image, as in image scaling, particularly decimation. One may also remove less \"lower information\" parts of an image, such as by seam carving. Many media transforms, such as Gaussian blur, are, like lossy compression, irreversible: the original signal cannot be reconstructed from the transformed signal. However, in general these will have the same size as the original, and are not a form of compression. Lowering resolution has practical uses, as the NASA New Horizons craft transmitted thumbnails of its encounter with Pluto-Charon before it sent the higher resolution images. Another solution for slow connections is the usage of Image interlacing which progressively defines the image. Thus a partial transmission is enough to preview the final image, in a lower resolution version, without creating a scaled and a full version too."}

Lossless compression is possible because most real-world data exhibits statistical redundancy. By contrast, lossy compression permits reconstruction only of an approximation of the original data, though usually with greatly improved compression rates (and therefore reduced media sizes).\nBy operation of the pigeonhole principle, no lossless compression algorithm can shrink the size of all possible data: Some data will get longer by at least one symbol or bit.\nCompression algorithms are usually effective for human- and machine-readable documents and cannot shrink the size of random data that contain no redundancy. Different algorithms exist that are designed either with a specific type of input data in mind or with specific assumptions about what kinds of redundancy the uncompressed data are likely to contain.\nLossless data compression is used in many applications. For example, it is used in the ZIP file format and in the GNU tool gzip. It is also often used as a component within lossy data compression technologies (e.g. lossless mid/side joint stereo preprocessing by MP3 encoders and other lossy audio encoders).\nLossless compression is used in cases where it is important that the original and the decompressed data be identical, or where deviations from the original data would be unfavourable. Common examples are executable programs, text documents, and source code. Some image file formats, like PNG or GIF, use only lossless compression, while others like TIFF and MNG may use either lossless or lossy methods. Lossless audio formats are most often used for archiving or production purposes, while smaller lossy audio files are typically used on portable players and in other cases where storage space is limited or exact replication of the audio is unnecessary.\nTechniques.\nMost lossless compression programs do two things in sequence: the first step generates a \"statistical model\" for the input data, and the second step uses this model to map input data to bit sequences in such a way that \"probable\" (i.e. frequently encountered) data will produce shorter output than \"improbable\" data.\nThe primary encoding algorithms used to produce bit sequences are Huffman coding (also used by the deflate algorithm) and arithmetic coding. Arithmetic coding achieves compression rates close to the best possible for a particular statistical model, which is given by the information entropy, whereas Huffman compression is simpler and faster but produces poor results for models that deal with symbol probabilities close to 1.\nThere are two primary ways of constructing statistical models: in a \"static\" model, the data is analyzed and a model is constructed, then this model is stored with the compressed data. This approach is simple and modular, but has the disadvantage that the model itself can be expensive to store, and also that it forces using a single model for all data being compressed, and so performs poorly on files that contain heterogeneous data. \"Adaptive\" models dynamically update the model as the data is compressed. Both the encoder and decoder begin with a trivial model, yielding poor compression of initial data, but as they learn more about the data, performance improves. Most popular types of compression used in practice now use adaptive coders.\nLossless compression methods may be categorized according to the type of data they are designed to compress. While, in principle, any general-purpose lossless compression algorithm (\"general-purpose\" meaning that they can accept any bitstring) can be used on any type of data, many are unable to achieve significant compression on data that are not of the form for which they were designed to compress. Many of the lossless compression techniques used for text also work reasonably well for indexed-color images.\nMultimedia.\nThese techniques take advantage of the specific characteristics of images such as the common phenomenon of contiguous 2-D areas of similar tones. Every pixel but the first is replaced by the difference to its left neighbor. This leads to small values having a much higher probability than large values. This is often also applied to sound files, and can compress files that contain mostly low frequencies and low volumes. For images, this step can be repeated by taking the difference to the top pixel, and then in videos, the difference to the pixel in the next frame can be taken.\nThe adaptive encoding uses the probabilities from the previous sample in sound encoding, from the left and upper pixel in image encoding, and additionally from the previous frame in video encoding. In the wavelet transformation, the probabilities are also passed through the hierarchy.\nHistorical legal issues.\nMany of these methods are implemented in open-source and proprietary tools, particularly LZW and its variants. Some algorithms are patented in the United States and other countries and their legal usage requires licensing by the patent holder. Because of patents on certain kinds of LZW compression, and in particular licensing practices by patent holder Unisys that many developers considered abusive, some open source proponents encouraged people to avoid using the Graphics Interchange Format (GIF) for compressing still image files in favor of Portable Network Graphics (PNG), which combines the LZ77-based deflate algorithm with a selection of domain-specific prediction filters. However, the patents on LZW expired on June 20, 2003.\nMany of the lossless compression techniques used for text also work reasonably well for indexed images, but there are other techniques that do not work for typical text that are useful for some images (particularly simple bitmaps), and other techniques that take advantage of the specific characteristics of images (such as the common phenomenon of contiguous 2-D areas of similar tones, and the fact that color images usually have a preponderance of a limited range of colors out of those representable in the color space).\nAs mentioned previously, lossless sound compression is a somewhat specialized area. Lossless sound compression algorithms can take advantage of the repeating patterns shown by the wave-like nature of the essentially using autoregressive models to predict the \"next\" value and encoding the (possibly small) difference between the expected value and the actual data. If the difference between the predicted and the actual data (called the \"error\") tends to be small, then certain difference values (like 0, +1, \u22121 etc. on sample values) become very frequent, which can be exploited by encoding them in few output bits.\nIt is sometimes beneficial to compress only the differences between two versions of a file (or, in video compression, of successive images within a sequence). This is called delta encoding (from the Greek letter \u0394, which in mathematics, denotes a difference), but the term is typically only used if both versions are meaningful outside compression and decompression. For example, while the process of compressing the error in the above-mentioned lossless audio compression scheme could be described as delta encoding from the approximated sound wave to the original sound wave, the approximated version of the sound wave is not meaningful in any other context.\nMethods.\nNo lossless compression algorithm can efficiently compress all possible data &lt;templatestyles src=\"Crossreference/styles.css\" /&gt;. For this reason, many different algorithms exist that are designed either with a specific type of input data in mind or with specific assumptions about what kinds of redundancy the uncompressed data are likely to contain.\nSome of the most common lossless compression algorithms are listed below.\nVideo.\nSee list of lossless video codecs\nCryptography.\nCryptosystems often compress data (the \"plaintext\") \"before\" encryption for added security. When properly implemented, compression greatly increases the unicity distance by removing patterns that might facilitate cryptanalysis. However, many ordinary lossless compression algorithms produce headers, wrappers, tables, or other predictable output that might instead make cryptanalysis easier. Thus, cryptosystems must utilize compression algorithms whose output does not contain these predictable patterns.\nGenetics and genomics.\nGenetics compression algorithms (not to be confused with genetic algorithms) are the latest generation of lossless algorithms that compress data (typically sequences of nucleotides) using both conventional compression algorithms and specific algorithms adapted to genetic data. In 2012, a team of scientists from Johns Hopkins University published the first genetic compression algorithm that does not rely on external genetic databases for compression. HAPZIPPER was tailored for HapMap data and achieves over 20-fold compression (95% reduction in file size), providing 2- to 4-fold better compression much faster than leading general-purpose compression utilities.\nGenomic sequence compression algorithms, also known as DNA sequence compressors, explore the fact that DNA sequences have characteristic properties, such as inverted repeats. The most successful compressors are XM and GeCo. For eukaryotes XM is slightly better in compression ratio, though for sequences larger than 100\u00a0MB its computational requirements are impractical.\nExecutables.\nSelf-extracting executables contain a compressed application and a decompressor. When executed, the decompressor transparently decompresses and runs the original application. This is especially often used in demo coding, where competitions are held for demos with strict size limits, as small as 1 kilobyte. This type of compression is not strictly limited to binary executables, but can also be applied to scripts, such as JavaScript.\nBenchmarks.\nLossless compression algorithms and their implementations are routinely tested in head-to-head benchmarks. There are a number of better-known compression benchmarks. Some benchmarks cover only the data compression ratio, so winners in these benchmarks may be unsuitable for everyday use due to the slow speed of the top performers. Another drawback of some benchmarks is that their data files are known, so some program writers may optimize their programs for best performance on a particular data set. The winners on these benchmarks often come from the class of context-mixing compression software.\nMatt Mahoney, in his February 2010 edition of the free booklet \"Data Compression Explained\", additionally lists the following:\nThe Compression Ratings website published a chart summary of the \"frontier\" in compression ratio and time.\nLimitations.\nLossless data compression algorithms cannot guarantee compression for all input data sets. In other words, for any lossless data compression algorithm, there will be an input data set that does not get smaller when processed by the algorithm, and for any lossless data compression algorithm that makes at least one file smaller, there will be at least one file that it makes larger. This is easily proven with elementary mathematics using a counting argument called the pigeonhole principle, as follows:\nMost practical compression algorithms provide an \"escape\" facility that can turn off the normal coding for files that would become longer by being encoded. In theory, only a single additional bit is required to tell the decoder that the normal coding has been turned off for the entire input; however, most encoding algorithms use at least one full byte (and typically more than one) for this purpose. For example, deflate compressed files never need to grow by more than 5 bytes per 65,535 bytes of input.\nIn fact, if we consider files of length N, if all files were equally probable, then for any lossless compression that reduces the size of some file, the expected length of a compressed file (averaged over all possible files of length N) must necessarily be \"greater\" than N. So if we know nothing about the properties of the data we are compressing, we might as well not compress it at all. A lossless compression algorithm is useful only when we are more likely to compress certain types of files than others; then the algorithm could be designed to compress those types of data better.\nThus, the main lesson from the argument is not that one risks big losses, but merely that one cannot always win. To choose an algorithm always means implicitly to select a \"subset\" of all files that will become usefully shorter. This is the theoretical reason why we need to have different compression algorithms for different kinds of files: there cannot be any algorithm that is good for all kinds of data.\nThe \"trick\" that allows lossless compression algorithms, used on the type of data they were designed for, to consistently compress such files to a shorter form is that the files the algorithms are designed to act on all have some form of easily modeled redundancy that the algorithm is designed to remove, and thus belong to the subset of files that that algorithm can make shorter, whereas other files would not get compressed or even get bigger. Algorithms are generally quite specifically tuned to a particular type of file: for example, lossless audio compression programs do not work well on text files, and vice versa.\nIn particular, files of random data cannot be consistently compressed by any conceivable lossless data compression algorithm; indeed, this result is used to \"define\" the concept of randomness in Kolmogorov complexity.\nIt is provably impossible to create an algorithm that can losslessly compress any data. While there have been many claims through the years of companies achieving \"perfect compression\" where an arbitrary number \"N\" of random bits can always be compressed to \"N\"\u00a0\u2212\u00a01 bits, these kinds of claims can be safely discarded without even looking at any further details regarding the purported compression scheme. Such an algorithm contradicts fundamental laws of mathematics because, if it existed, it could be applied repeatedly to losslessly reduce any file to length 1.\nOn the other hand, it has also been proven that there is no algorithm to determine whether a file is incompressible in the sense of Kolmogorov complexity. Hence it is possible that any particular file, even if it appears random, may be significantly compressed, even including the size of the decompressor. An example is the digits of the mathematical constant \"pi\", which appear random but can be generated by a very small program. However, even though it cannot be determined whether a particular file is incompressible, a simple theorem about incompressible strings shows that over 99% of files of any given length cannot be compressed by more than one byte (including the size of the decompressor).\nMathematical background.\nAbstractly, a compression algorithm can be viewed as a function on sequences (normally of octets). Compression is successful if the resulting sequence is shorter than the original sequence (and the instructions for the decompression map). For a compression algorithm to be lossless, the compression map must form an injection from \"plain\" to \"compressed\" bit sequences. The pigeonhole principle prohibits a bijection between the collection of sequences of length \"N\" and any subset of the collection of sequences of length \"N\"\u22121. Therefore, it is not possible to produce a lossless algorithm that reduces the size of every possible input sequence.\nPoints of application in real compression theory.\nReal compression algorithm designers accept that streams of high information entropy cannot be compressed, and accordingly, include facilities for detecting and handling this condition. An obvious way of detection is applying a raw compression algorithm and testing if its output is smaller than its input. Sometimes, detection is made by heuristics; for example, a compression application may consider files whose names end in \".zip\", \".arj\" or \".lha\" uncompressible without any more sophisticated detection. A common way of handling this situation is quoting input, or uncompressible parts of the input in the output, minimizing the compression overhead. For example, the zip data format specifies the 'compression method' of 'Stored' for input files that have been copied into the archive verbatim.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

His 1970 novel \"Ringworld\" won the Hugo, Locus, Ditmar, and Nebula awards. With Jerry Pournelle he wrote \"The Mote in God's Eye\" (1974) and \"Lucifer's Hammer\" (1977). The Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers of America gave him the 2015 Damon Knight Memorial Grand Master Award. \nHis work is primarily hard science fiction, using big science concepts and theoretical physics. It also often includes elements of detective fiction and adventure stories. His fantasy includes the series \"The Magic Goes Away\", works of rational fantasy dealing with magic as a non-renewable resource.\nBiography.\nNiven was born in Los Angeles. He is a great-grandson of Edward L. Doheny, an oil tycoon who drilled the first successful well in the Los Angeles City Oil Field in 1892, and also was subsequently implicated in the Teapot Dome scandal. \nNiven briefly attended the California Institute of Technology and graduated with a Bachelor of Arts in mathematics (with a minor in psychology) from Washburn University in Topeka, Kansas in 1962. He also completed a year of graduate work in mathematics at the University of California, Los Angeles. On September 6, 1969, he married Marilyn Wisowaty, a science fiction and Regency literature fan.\nWork.\nNiven is the author of numerous science fiction short stories and novels, beginning with his 1964 story \"The Coldest Place\". In this story, the coldest place concerned is the dark side of Mercury, which at the time the story was written was thought to be tidally locked with the Sun (it was found to rotate in a 2:3 resonance after Niven received payment for the story, but before it was published).\nAlgis Budrys said in 1968 that Niven becoming a top writer despite the New Wave was evidence that \"trends are for second-raters\". In addition to the Nebula Award in 1970 and the Hugo and Locus awards in 1971 for \"Ringworld\", Niven won the Hugo Award for Best Short Story for \"Neutron Star\" in 1967. He won the same award in 1972, for \"Inconstant Moon\", and in 1975 for \"The Hole Man\". In 1976, he won the Hugo Award for Best Novelette for \"The Borderland of Sol\".\nNiven frequently collaborated with Jerry Pournelle; they wrote nine novels together, including \"The Mote in God's Eye\", \"Lucifer's Hammer\" and \"Footfall\".\nNiven has written scripts for two science fiction television series: the original \"Land of the Lost\" series and \"\", for which he adapted his early story \"The Soft Weapon.\" For \"The Outer Limits\", his story \"Inconstant Moon\" was adapted into an episode of the same name by Brad Wright.\nNiven has also written for the DC Comics character Green Lantern, including in his stories hard science fiction concepts such as universal entropy and the redshift effect.\nSeveral of his stories predicted the black market in transplant organs (\"organlegging\").\nMany of Niven's stories\u2014sometimes called the Tales of Known Space\u2014take place in his Known Space universe, in which humanity shares the several habitable star systems nearest to the Sun with over a dozen alien species, including the aggressive feline Kzinti and the very intelligent but cowardly Pierson's Puppeteers, which are frequently central characters. The \"Ringworld\" series is part of the Tales of Known Space, and Niven has shared the setting with other writers since a 1988 anthology, \"The Man-Kzin Wars\" (Baen Books, jointly edited with Jerry Pournelle and Dean Ing). There have been several volumes of short stories and novellas.\nNiven has also written a logical fantasy series \"The Magic Goes Away\", which utilizes an exhaustible resource called \"mana\" to power a rule-based \"technological\" magic. \"The Draco Tavern\" series of short stories take place in a more light-hearted science fiction universe, and are told from the point of view of the proprietor of an omni-species bar. The whimsical \"Svetz\" series consists of a collection of short stories, \"The Flight of the Horse\", and a novel, \"Rainbow Mars\", which involve a nominal time machine sent back to retrieve long-extinct animals, but which travels, in fact, into alternative realities and brings back mythical creatures such as a roc and a unicorn. Much of his writing since the 1970s has been in collaboration, particularly with Jerry Pournelle and Steven Barnes, but also Brenda Cooper and Edward M. Lerner.\nOne of Niven's best known humorous works is \"Man of Steel, Woman of Kleenex\", in which he uses real-world physics to underline the difficulties of Superman and a human woman (Lois Lane or Lana Lang) mating.\nInfluence.\nIn the \"\" trading card game, the card Nevinyrral's Disk uses his name, spelled backwards. This tribute was paid because the game's system where mana from lands is used to power spells was inspired by his book \"The Magic Goes Away\". The card Nevinyrral, Urborg Tyrant was added in Commander Legends, adding Niven's namesake character fully to the game.\nPolitics.\nAccording to author Michael Moorcock, in 1967, Niven, despite being a staunch conservative, voiced opposition to the Vietnam War. However, in 1968 Niven signed an advertisement in \"Galaxy Science Fiction\" in support for continued US involvement in the Vietnam War.\nNiven was an adviser to Ronald Reagan on the creation of the Strategic Defense Initiative antimissile policy, as part of the Citizens' Advisory Council on National Space Policy\u2014as covered in the BBC documentary \"Pandora's Box\" by Adam Curtis.\nIn 2007, Niven, in conjunction with a think tank of science fiction writers known as SIGMA, founded and led by Arlan Andrews, began advising the U.S. Department of Homeland Security as to future trends affecting terror policy and other topics. Among those topics was reducing costs for hospitals to which Niven offered the solution to spread rumors in Latino communities that organs were being harvested illegally in hospitals.\nNiven's laws.\nLarry Niven is also known in science fiction fandom for \"Niven's Law\": \"There is no cause so right that one cannot find a fool following it.\" Over the course of his career Niven has added to this first law a list of Niven's Laws which he describes as \"how the Universe works\" as far as he can tell.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Although the name does not imply product distribution per se, a distro\u2014if distributed on its own\u2014is often obtained via a website intended specifically for the purpose. Distros have been designed for a wide variety of systems ranging from personal computers (for example, Linux Mint) to servers (for example, Red Hat Enterprise Linux) and from embedded devices (for example, OpenWrt) to supercomputers (for example, Rocks Cluster Distribution).\nA distro typically includes many components in addition to the Linux kernel. Commonly, it includes a package manager, an init system (such as systemd, OpenRC, SysVinit, or runit), GNU tools and libraries, documentation, IP network configuration utilities, the getty TTY setup program, and many more. To provide a desktop experience (most commonly the Mesa userspace graphics drivers) a display server (the most common being the X.org Server, or, more recently, a Wayland compositor such as Sway, KDE's KWin, or GNOME's Mutter), a desktop environment (most commonly GNOME, KDE Plasma, or Xfce), a sound server (usually either PulseAudio or more recently PipeWire), and other related programs may be included or installed by the user.\nTypically, most of the included software is free and open-source software \u2013 made available both as binary for convenience and as source code to allow for modifying it. A distro may also include proprietary software that is not available in source code form, such as a device driver binary.\nA distro may be described as a particular assortment of application and utility software (various GNU tools and libraries, for example), packaged with the Linux kernel in such a way that its capabilities meet users' needs. The software is usually adapted to the distribution and then combined into software packages by the distribution's maintainers. The software packages are available online in repositories, which are storage locations usually distributed around the world. Beside \"glue\" components, such as the distribution installers (for example, Debian-Installer and Anaconda) and the package management systems, very few packages are actually written by a distribution's maintainers.\nDistributions have been designed for a wide range of computing environments, including desktops, servers, laptops, netbooks, mobile devices (phones and tablets), and embedded systems. There are commercially backed distributions, such as Red Hat Enterprise Linux (Red Hat), openSUSE (SUSE) and Ubuntu (Canonical), and entirely community-driven distributions, such as Debian, Slackware, Gentoo and Arch Linux. Most distributions come ready-to-use and prebuilt for a specific instruction set, while some (such as Gentoo) are distributed mostly in source code form and must be built before installation.\nHistory.\nLinus Torvalds developed the Linux kernel and distributed its first version, 0.01, in 1991. Linux was initially distributed as source code only, and later as a pair of downloadable floppy disk images: one bootable and containing the Linux kernel itself, and the other with a set of GNU utilities and tools for setting up a file system. Since the installation procedure was complicated, especially in the face of growing amounts of available software, distributions sprang up to simplify it.\nEarly distributions included:\nThe two oldest, still active distribution projects started in 1993. The SLS distribution was not well maintained, so in July 1993 a new SLS-based distribution, Slackware, was released by Patrick Volkerding. Also dissatisfied with SLS, Ian Murdock set to create a free distribution by founding Debian in August 1993, with first public BETA released in January 1994 and first stable version in June 1996.\nUsers were attracted to Linux distributions as alternatives to MS-DOS compatible operating systems, Windows, Classic Mac OS, and proprietary versions of Unix. Most early adopters were familiar with Unix from work or school. They embraced Linux distributions for their low (or absent) cost, and the availability of the source code for most or all of their software.\nAs of 2025, Linux has become more popular in server and embedded devices markets than in the desktop market. It is used in approximately 64.5% of web servers; its current operating system market share is about 2.51%, and its desktop operating system market share is about 2.94%.\nComponents.\nMany Linux distributions provide an installation system akin to that provided with other modern operating systems. Other distributions, including Gentoo Linux, provide only the binaries of a basic kernel, compilation tools, and an installer; the installer compiles all the requested software for the specific architecture of the user's computer, using these tools and the software's source code.\nPackage management.\nDistributions are normally segmented into \"packages\". Each package contains a specific application or service. Examples of packages are a library for handling the PNG image format, a collection of fonts, and a web browser.\nThe package is typically provided as compiled code, with installation and removal of packages handled by a package management system (PMS) rather than a simple file archiver. Each package intended for such a PMS contains meta-information such as its description, version number, and its dependencies (other packages it requires to run). The package management system evaluates this meta-information to allow package searches, perform automatic upgrades to newer versions, and to check that all dependencies of a package are present (and either notify the user to install them, or install them automatically). The package can also be provided as source code to be compiled on the system.\nMost distributions install packages, including the kernel and other core operating system components, in a predetermined configuration. A few now require or permit configuration adjustments at first install time. This makes installation less daunting, particularly for new users, but is not always acceptable. For specific requirements, much software must be carefully configured to be useful, to work correctly with other software, or to be secure, and local administrators are often obliged to spend time reviewing and reconfiguring it.\nSome (but not all) distributions go to considerable lengths to adjust and customize the software they include, and some provide configuration tools to help users do so.\nBy obtaining and installing \"everything\" normally provided in a distribution, an administrator may create a \"distributionless\" installation. It is possible to build such systems from scratch, avoiding distributions altogether. One needs a way to generate the first binaries until the system is \"self-hosting\". This can be done via compilation on another system capable of building binaries for the intended target (possibly by cross-compilation). For example, see Linux From Scratch.\nTypes and trends.\nIn broad terms, Linux distributions may be:\nThe diversity of Linux distributions is due to technical, organizational, and philosophical variation among vendors and users. The permissive licensing of free software means that users with sufficient knowledge and interest can customize any extant distribution, or design one to suit their own needs.\nRolling distributions vis-\u00e0-vis standard releases.\nRolling Linux distributions are kept current using small and frequent updates. The terms \"partially rolling\" and \"partly rolling\" (along with synonyms \"semi-rolling\" and \"half-rolling\"), \"fully rolling\", \"truly rolling\" and \"optionally rolling\" are sometimes used by software developers and users.\nRepositories of rolling distributions usually contain very recent software releases\u2014often the latest stable versions available. They have pseudo-releases and installation media that are simply snapshots of the distribution at the time of the installation image's release. Typically, a rolling-release OS installed from older installation medium can be fully updated after it is installed.\nDepending on the usage case, there can be pros and cons to both standard release and rolling release software development methodologies.\nIn terms of the software development process, standard releases require significant development effort to keep old versions up-to-date by propagating bug fixes back to the newest branch, versus focusing on the newest development branch. Also, unlike rolling releases, standard releases require more than one code branch to be developed and maintained, which increases the workload of the software developers and maintainers.\nOn the other hand, software features and technology planning are easier in standard releases due to a better understanding of upcoming features in the next version(s). Software release cycles can also be synchronized with those of major upstream software projects, such as desktop environments.\nAs for the user experience, standard releases are often viewed as more stable and bug-free since software conflicts can be more easily addressed and the software stack more thoroughly tested and evaluated, during the software development cycle. For this reason, they tend to be the preferred choice in enterprise environments and mission-critical tasks.\nHowever, rolling releases offer more current software which can also provide increased stability and fewer software bugs along with the additional benefits of new features, greater functionality, faster running speeds, and improved system and application security. Regarding software security, the rolling release model can have advantages in timely security updates, fixing system or application security bugs and vulnerabilities, that standard releases may have to wait till the next release for or patch in various versions. In a rolling release distribution, where the user has \"chosen\" to run it as a highly dynamic system, the constant flux of software packages can introduce new unintended vulnerabilities.\nInstallation-free distributions (live CD/USB).\nA \"live\" distribution is a Linux distribution that can be booted from removable storage media such as optical discs or USB flash drives, instead of being installed on and booted from a hard disk drive. The portability of installation-free distributions makes them advantageous for applications such as demonstrations, borrowing someone else's computer, rescue operations, or as installation media for a standard distribution.\nWhen the operating system is booted from a read-only medium such as a CD or DVD, any user data that needs to be retained between sessions cannot be stored on the boot device but must be written to another storage device, such as a USB flash drive or a hard disk drive.\nMany Linux distributions provide a \"live\" form in addition to their conventional form, which is a network-based or removable-media image intended to be used only for installation; such distributions include antiX, SUSE, Ubuntu, Linux Mint, MX Linux and Fedora Linux. Some distributions, including Knoppix, Puppy Linux, Devil-Linux, SuperGamer, SliTaz GNU/Linux and , are designed primarily for live use. Additionally, some minimal distributions can be run directly from as little space as one floppy disk without the need to change the contents of the system's hard disk drive.\nExamples.\nThe website DistroWatch lists many Linux distributions and displays some of the ones that have the most web traffic on the site. The Wikimedia Foundation released an analysis of the browser User Agents of visitors to WMF websites until 2015, which includes details of the most popular Operating System identifiers, including some Linux distributions. Many of the popular distributions are listed below.\nLinux-kernel-based operating systems.\nSeveral operating systems include the Linux kernel, but have a userland that differs significantly from that of mainstream Linux distributions:\nWhether such operating systems count as a \"Linux distribution\" is a controversial topic. They use the Linux kernel, so the Linux Foundation and Chris DiBona, Google's former open-source chief, agree that Android is a Linux distribution; others, such as Google engineer Patrick Brady, disagree by noting the lack of support for many GNU tools in Android, including glibc.\nOther Linux-kernel-based operating systems include Tizen, Mer/Sailfish OS, KaiOS and Amazon's Kindle firmware.\nLightweight distributions.\nLightweight Linux distributions are those that have been designed with support for older hardware in mind, allowing older hardware to still be used productively, or, for maximum possible speed in newer hardware by leaving more resources available for use by applications. Examples include antiX, Damn Small Linux (based on antiX), Tiny Core Linux, Puppy Linux and Slitaz.\nNiche distributions.\nOther distributions target specific niches, such as:\nObscure distributions.\nSome distros are lesser-known or known for their quirks, such as:\nInterdistribution issues.\nThe Free Standards Group was an organization formed by major software and hardware vendors that aims to improve interoperability between different distributions. Among their proposed standards are the Linux Standard Base, which defines a common ABI and packaging system for Linux, and the Filesystem Hierarchy Standard which recommends a standard filenaming chart, notably the basic directory names found on the root of the tree of any Linux filesystem. Those standards, however, see limited use, even among the distributions developed by members of the organization.\nThe diversity of Linux distributions means that not all software runs on all distributions, depending on what libraries and other system attributes are required. Packaged software and software repositories are usually specific to a particular distribution, though cross-installation is sometimes possible on closely related distributions.\nInstallation.\nThere are several ways to install a Linux distribution. The most popular method of installing Linux is by booting from a live USB memory stick, which can be created by using a USB image writer application and the ISO image, which can be downloaded from various Linux distribution websites. DVD disks, CD disks, network installations and even other hard drives can also be used as \"installation media\".\nIn the 1990s, Linux distributions were installed using sets of floppy disks, but this has been abandoned by all major distributions. By the 2000s, many distributions offered CD and DVD sets with the vital packages on the first disk and less important packages on later ones. Some distributions, such as Debian also enabled installing over a network after booting from either a set of floppy disks or a CD with only a small amount of data on it.\nNew users tend to begin by partitioning a hard drive to keep their formerly installed operating system. The Linux distribution can then be installed on its own separate partition without affecting formerly saved data.\nIn a Live CD setup, the computer boots the entire operating system from CD without first installing it on the computer's hard disk. Many distributions have a Live CD \"installer\", where the computer boots the operating system from the disk, and it can then be installed on the computer's hard disk, providing a seamless transition from the OS running from the CD to the OS running from the hard disk.\nBoth servers and personal computers that come with Linux already installed are available from vendors including Hewlett-Packard, Dell and System76.\nOn embedded devices, Linux is typically held in the device's firmware and may or may not be consumer-accessible.\nAnaconda, one of the more popular installers, is used by Red Hat Enterprise Linux, Fedora (which uses the Fedora Media Writer) and other distributions to simplify the installation process. Debian, Ubuntu and many others use Debian-Installer.\nThe process of constantly switching between distributions is often referred to as \"distro hopping\". Virtual machine software such as VirtualBox and VMware Workstation virtualize hardware allowing users to test live media on a virtual machine without installing to the real system. Some websites like DistroWatch offer lists of distributions, and link to screenshots of operating systems as a way to get a first impression of various distributions.\nInstallation via an existing operating system.\nSome distributions let the user install Linux on top of their current system, such as WinLinux (outdated) or coLinux. Linux is installed to the Windows hard disk partition, and can be started from inside Windows itself.\nVirtual machines (such as VirtualBox or VMware) also make it possible for Linux to be run inside another OS. The VM software simulates a separate computer onto which the Linux system is installed. After installation, the virtual machine can be booted as if it were an independent computer.\nVarious tools are also available to perform full dual-boot installation from extant platforms with no CD, most notably:\nProprietary software.\nSome specific proprietary software products are not available in any form for Linux. As of September 2015, the Steam gaming service has over 1,500 games available on Linux, compared to 2,323 games for Mac and 6,500 Windows games. Emulation and API-translation projects like Wine and CrossOver make it possible to run non-Linux-based software on Linux systems, either by emulating a proprietary operating system or by translating proprietary API calls (e.g., calls to Microsoft's Win32 or DirectX APIs) into native Linux API calls. A virtual machine can also be used to run a proprietary OS (like Microsoft Windows) on top of Linux.\nOEM contracts.\nPre-built computers are usually sold with an operating system other than Linux already installed by the original equipment manufacturer (OEM). In the case of IBM PC compatibles, the OS is usually Microsoft Windows; in the case of Apple's Mac computers, it has always been macOS; Sun Microsystems sold SPARC hardware with Solaris installed; video game consoles such as the Xbox, PlayStation, Wii, and Nintendo Switch each have their own proprietary OS. This limits Linux's market share: consumers are unaware that an alternative exists, they must make a conscious effort to use a different operating system, and they must either perform the actual installation themselves, or depend on support from a friend, relative, or computer professional.\nHowever, it is possible to buy hardware with Linux already installed. Lenovo, Hewlett-Packard, Dell, Affordy, Purism, Pine64 and System76 all sell general-purpose Linux laptops. Custom-order PC manufacturers will also build Linux systems, but possibly with the Windows key on the keyboard. Fixstars Solutions (formerly Terra Soft) sold Macintosh computers and PlayStation 3 consoles with Yellow Dog Linux installed.\nIt is more common to find embedded devices sold with Linux as the default manufacturer-supported OS, including the Linksys NSLU2 NAS device, TiVo's line of personal video recorders, and Linux-based cellphones (including Android smartphones), PDAs, and portable music players.\nThe current Microsoft Windows license lets the manufacturer determine the refund policy. With prior versions of Windows, it was possible to obtain a refund if the manufacturer failed to provide the refund by litigation in the small claims courts. On February 15, 1999, a group of Linux users in Orange County, California held a \"Windows Refund Day\" protest in an attempt to pressure Microsoft into issuing them refunds. In France, the Linuxfrench and AFUL (French speaking Libre Software Users' Association) organizations along with free software activist Roberto Di Cosmo started a \"Windows Detax\" movement, which led to a 2006 petition against \"racketiciels\" (translation: Racketware) with 39,415 signatories and the DGCCRF branch of the French government filing several complaints against bundled software.\nStatistics.\nThere are no official figures on the popularity, adoption, downloads or installed base of Linux distributions.\nThere are also no official figures for the total number of Linux systems, partly due to the difficulty of quantifying the number of PCs running Linux (see Desktop Linux adoption), since many users download Linux distributions. Hence, the sales figures for Linux systems and commercial Linux distributions indicate a much lower number of Linux systems and level of Linux adoption than is the case; this is mainly due to Linux being free and open-source software that can be downloaded free of charge. A Linux Counter Project had kept track of a running guesstimate of the number of Linux systems, but did not distinguish between rolling release and standard release distributions. It ceased operation in August 2018, though a few related blog posts were created through October 2018.\nDesktop usage statistical reports for particular Linux distributions have been collected and published since July 2014 by the Linux Hardware Project.\nStatcounter, a web traffic analysis company, within the \"operating system market share\", showed that the Linux operating systems had, according to them, 3.9% of the worldwide market share in July 2025.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "18213", "revid": "50393845", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18213", "title": "Los Angeles Dodgers", "text": "Major League Baseball franchise in Los Angeles, California\nThe Los Angeles Dodgers are an American professional baseball team based in Los Angeles. The Dodgers compete in Major League Baseball (MLB) as a member of the National League (NL) West Division. One of the most successful and storied franchises in MLB, the Dodgers have won nine World Series championships and a record 26 National League pennants. As of 2024, \"Forbes\" ranked the Dodgers second in MLB franchise valuation at $5.45 billion. They are the current champions of baseball, having won the world series for the second straight year.\nFounded in 1883 in Brooklyn, New York, the team joined the NL in 1890 as the Brooklyn Bridegrooms and used other names before becoming the Brooklyn Dodgers in 1932. The Dodgers broke the baseball color line in 1947 with the debut of Jackie Robinson, the first African American to play in the Major Leagues since 1884. From the 1940s through the mid-1950s, the Dodgers had a fierce crosstown rivalry with the New York Yankees. The clubs have faced each other in the World Series seven times, with the Dodgers losing the first five matchups before winning the franchise's first title in 1955.\nAfter 68 seasons in Brooklyn, Dodgers owner and president Walter O'Malley moved the franchise to Los Angeles before the 1958 season. The team played their first four seasons at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum before moving to their current home of Dodger Stadium in 1962. The Dodgers found immediate success in Los Angeles, winning the 1959 World Series. Success continued into the 1960s; their ace pitchers Sandy Koufax and Don Drysdale helped win titles in 1963 and 1965. In 1956, Don Newcombe became the first player to win the Cy Young Award and be named NL MVP in the same season. In 1981, rookie pitcher Fernando Valenzuela became a sensation and led the team to a championship; he remains the only player to win the Cy Young and Rookie of the Year awards in the same season. The Dodgers were once again victorious in 1988, upsetting their heavily favored opponent in each series and becoming the only franchise to win multiple titles in the 1980s. Next came a 32-year championship drought, despite 12 postseason appearances in a 17-year span and eight consecutive division titles from 2013 to 2020. It was broken when the Dodgers won the 2020 World Series. Two-way superstar Shohei Ohtani joined the Dodgers in 2024, who led the team to consecutive World Series titles that season and in 2025 while setting league and franchise records along the way.\nEleven players have been named NL MVP with the Dodgers. Eight Dodger pitchers have won a total of 12 Cy Young Awards\u2014by far the most of any MLB franchise. The Dodgers boast 18 Rookie of the Year Award winners, twice as many as the next club. This includes four consecutive Rookies of the Year from 1979 to 1982 and five consecutive from 1992 to 1996. From 1884 through 2025, the Dodgers' record is 11,525\u201310,137\u2013139 (). Since moving to Los Angeles in 1958, the Dodgers' record is 5,901\u20134,857\u20136 () through the end of 2025.\nThe Dodgers have a wide fanbase and have historically been one of the National League's most dominant teams. Their rivalry with the San Francisco Giants has spanned three centuries and distinct eras as a New York City cross-town affair and a California cross-state rivalry.\nHistory.\nThe club was formed, as the Brooklyn Baseball Association, in 1883, when it played in the Interstate League. It joined the major league American Association in 1884, and the National League in 1890.\nAlthough the team had no official nickname until 1932, they were informally nicknamed the Bridegrooms in the team's earliest years, then the Superbas around the turn of the century, and then the Robins (named after manager Wilbert Robinson). In the early 1900s, sportswriter Charles Dryden nicknamed the team the Trolley Dodgers after the Brooklyn pedestrians who dodged streetcars in the city, and the Dodgers nickname was used contemporaneously with Superbas and Robins. In 1932, the team allowed the Brooklyn baseball writers to select a permanent name, and the writers chose Dodgers on January 22, 1932. The only other nickname seriously considered by the writers was Kings.\nIn 1941, the Dodgers captured their third National League pennant, only to lose to the New York Yankees. This marked the onset of the Dodgers\u2013Yankees rivalry, as the Dodgers would face them in their next six World Series appearances. Led by Jackie Robinson, the first black Major League Baseball player of the modern era; and three-time National League Most Valuable Player Roy Campanella, also signed out of the Negro leagues, the Dodgers captured their first World Series title in 1955 by defeating the Yankees for the first time, a story described in the 1972 book \"The Boys of Summer\".\nAfter the 1957 season, the team left Brooklyn. In just their second season in Los Angeles, the Dodgers won their second World Series title, beating the Chicago White Sox in six games in 1959. Spearheaded by the dominant pitching of Sandy Koufax and Don Drysdale, the Dodgers captured three pennants in the 1960s and won two more World Series titles, sweeping the Yankees in four games in 1963, and edging the Minnesota Twins in seven in 1965. The 1963 sweep was their second victory against the Yankees, and their first against them as a Los Angeles team. The Dodgers won more pennants in 1966, 1974, 1977, and 1978, but lost in each World Series appearance. They won the World Series again in 1981 behind pitching sensation Fernando Valenzuela; the early 1980s were affectionately dubbed \"Fernandomania\".\nIn 1988, another pitching hero, Orel Hershiser, led them to a World Series victory, aided by one of the most memorable home runs of all time: star outfielder Kirk Gibson, injured in both knees, came off the bench to pinch-hit with two outs in the bottom of the ninth inning of game 1, in his only appearance of the series. Their next pennant came in 2017, aided by a Justin Turner walk-off home run, 29 years to the day after Gibson's. They lost the Series in seven games to the Houston Astros, which would later be revealed to have been stealing signs. The Dodgers repeated as pennant-winners in 2018 but lost the Series to the Boston Red Sox in 5 games. They took the pennant in 2020 in a season shortened by the COVID-19 pandemic to 60 games, and defeated the Tampa Bay Rays to win the Series in 6 games. The Dodgers returned to the World Series in 2024, defeating the New York Yankees in 5 games. They returned to the World Series as defending champions in 2025, defeating the Toronto Blue Jays in 7 games.\nThe Dodgers share a fierce rivalry with the San Francisco Giants, dating back the franchises' time in New York City. Both teams moved west for the 1958 season. The Brooklyn/Los Angeles Dodgers have appeared in the World Series 22 times, while the New York/San Francisco Giants have appeared in the World Series 20 times. The Dodgers have won nine World Series titles, and the Giants eight. When the two teams were based in New York, the Giants won five World Series championships, and the Dodgers one. Since the move to California, the Dodgers have won eight World Series while the Giants have won three.\nIn Brooklyn, the Dodgers won the NL pennant 12 times (1890, 1899, 1900, 1916, 1920, 1941, 1947, 1949, 1952, 1953, 1955, 1956) and the World Series in 1955. After moving to Los Angeles, the team won National League pennants in 1959, 1963, 1965, 1966, 1974, 1977, 1978, 1981, 1988, 2017, 2018, 2020, 2024, and 2025 with World Series championships in 1959, 1963, 1965, 1981, 1988, 2020, 2024 and 2025. In all, the Dodgers have appeared in 22 World Series: nine in Brooklyn and 13 in Los Angeles.\nTeam history.\nBrooklyn Dodgers.\nThe Dodgers were founded in 1883 as the Brooklyn Atlantics, borrowing the name of a defunct team that had played in Brooklyn before them. The team joined the American Association in 1884 and won the AA championship in 1889 before joining the National League in 1890. They promptly won the NL Championship in their first year in the League. The team was known alternatively as the Bridegrooms, Grooms, Superbas, Robins and Trolley Dodgers, before officially becoming the Brooklyn Dodgers in the 1930s.\nJackie Robinson.\nFor most of the first half of the 20th century, no Major League Baseball team employed an African American player. Jackie Robinson became the first African American to play for a Major League Baseball team when he played his first major league game on April 15, 1947, as a member of the Brooklyn Dodgers. This was mainly due to general manager Branch Rickey's efforts. The deeply religious Rickey's motivation appears to have been primarily moral, although business considerations were also a factor. Rickey was a member of The Methodist Church, the antecedent denomination to The United Methodist Church of today, which was a strong advocate for social justice and active later in the American Civil Rights Movement.\nThis event was the harbinger of the integration of professional sports in the United States, the concomitant demise of the Negro leagues, and is regarded as a key moment in the history of the American Civil Rights Movement. Robinson was an exceptional player, a speedy runner who sparked the team with his intensity. He was the inaugural recipient of the Rookie of the Year award, which is now named the Jackie Robinson Award in his honor. The Dodgers' willingness to integrate, when most other teams refused to, was a key factor in their 1947\u20131956 success. They won six pennants in those 10 years with the help of Robinson, three-time MVP Roy Campanella, Cy Young Award winner Don Newcombe, Jim Gilliam and Joe Black. Robinson would eventually go on to become the first African-American elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1962.\nMove to California.\nReal estate investor Walter O'Malley acquired majority ownership of the Dodgers in 1950 when he bought the 25 percent share of co-owner Branch Rickey and became allied with the widow of another equal partner, Mrs. John L. Smith. Shortly afterwards, he was working to buy new land in Brooklyn to build a more accessible and profitable ballpark than the aging Ebbets Field. Beloved as it was, Ebbets Field was no longer well-served by its aging infrastructure and the Dodgers could no longer sell out the park even in the heat of a pennant race, despite largely dominating the National League from 1946 to 1957.\nO'Malley wanted to build a new, state-of-the-art stadium in Brooklyn. But City Planner Robert Moses and New York politicians refused to grant him the eminent domain authority required to build pursuant to O'Malley's plans. To put pressure on the city, during the 1955 season, O'Malley announced that the team would play seven regular-season games and one exhibition game at Jersey City's Roosevelt Stadium in 1956. Moses and the City considered this an empty threat, and did not believe O'Malley would go through with moving the team from New York City.\nAfter teams began to travel to and from games by air instead of train, it became possible to include locations in the far west. Los Angeles officials attended the 1956 World Series looking to the Washington Senators to move to the West Coast. When O'Malley heard that LA was looking for a club, he sent word to the Los Angeles officials that he was interested in talking. LA offered him what New York would not: a chance to buy land suitable for building a ballpark, and own that ballpark, giving him complete control over all revenue streams. When the news came out, NYC Mayor Robert F. Wagner, Jr. and Moses made an offer to build a ballpark on the World's Fair Grounds in Queens that would be shared by the Giants and Dodgers. However, O'Malley was interested in his park under only his conditions, and the plans for a new stadium in Brooklyn seemed like a pipe dream. O'Malley decided to move the Dodgers to California, convincing Giants owner Horace Stoneham to move to San Francisco instead of Minneapolis to keep the Giants-Dodgers rivalry alive on the West Coast. They were the first MLB teams both west and south of St. Louis.\nThe Dodgers played their final game at Ebbets Field on September 24, 1957, which the Dodgers won 2\u20130 over the Pittsburgh Pirates.\nNew York remained a one-team town with the New York Yankees until 1962, when Joan Payson founded the New York Mets and brought National League baseball back to the city. The blue background used by the Dodgers was adopted by the Mets, honoring their New York NL forebears with a blend of Dodgers blue and Giants orange.\nLos Angeles Dodgers.\nThe Dodgers were the first Major League Baseball team to ever play in Los Angeles. On April 18, 1958, the Dodgers played their first Los Angeles game, defeating the former New York and now new San Francisco Giants, 6\u20135, before 78,672 fans at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum. Catcher Roy Campanella, left partially paralyzed in an off-season accident, was never able to play in Los Angeles.\nConstruction on Dodger Stadium was completed in time for Opening Day 1962. With its clean, simple lines and its picturesque setting amid hills and palm trees, the ballpark quickly became an icon of the Dodgers and their new California lifestyle. O'Malley was determined that there would not be a bad seat in the house, achieving this by cantilevered grandstands that have since been widely imitated. More importantly for the team, the stadium's spacious dimensions, along with other factors, gave defense an advantage over offense and the Dodgers moved to take advantage of this by assembling a team that would excel with its pitching.\nSince moving to Los Angeles, the Dodgers have won twelve more National League Championships and seven more World Series rings. The Dodgers have had only three top-five draft picks since the MLB Draft was introduced in 1965, and have had one top-ten pick (Clayton Kershaw, No. 7) since 1985.\nOther historical notes.\nOrigin of the nickname.\nThe Dodgers' official history reports that the term \"Trolley Dodgers\" was attached to the Brooklyn ballclub due to the complex maze of trolley cars that weaved its way through the borough of Brooklyn.\nIn 1892, the city of Brooklyn (Brooklyn was an independent city until annexed by New York City in 1898) began replacing its slow-moving, horse-drawn trolley lines with the faster, more powerful electric trolley lines. Within less than three years, by the end of 1895, electric trolley accidents in Brooklyn had resulted in more than 130 deaths and maimed well over 500 people. Brooklyn's high profile, the significant number of widely reported accidents, and a trolley strike in early 1895, combined to create a strong association in the public's mind between Brooklyn and trolley dodging.\nSportswriters started using the name \"Trolley Dodgers\" to refer to the Brooklyn team early in the 1895 season. The name was shortened to, on occasion, the \"Brooklyn Dodgers\" as early as 1898.\nSportswriters in the early 20th century began referring to the Dodgers as the \"Bums\", in reference to the team's fans and possibly because of the \"street character\" nature of Jack Dawkins, the \"Artful Dodger\" in Charles Dickens' \"Oliver Twist\". Newspaper cartoonist Willard Mullin used a drawing of famous clown Emmett Kelly to depict \"Dem Bums\": the team would later use \"Weary Willie\" in promotional images, and Kelly himself was a club mascot during the 1950s.\nOther team names used by the franchise were the Atlantics, Grays, Grooms, Bridegrooms, Superbas, and Robins. All of these nicknames were used by fans and sportswriters to describe the team, but not in any official capacity. The team's legal name was the Brooklyn Base Ball Club. However, the Trolley Dodger nickname was used throughout this period, simultaneously with these other nicknames, by fans and sportswriters of the day. The team did not use the name in any formal sense until 1932 when the word \"Dodgers\" appeared on team jerseys. The \"conclusive shift\" came in 1933, when both home and road jerseys for the team bore the name \"Dodgers\".\nExamples of how the many popularized names of the team were used are available from newspaper articles before 1932. A New York Times article describing a game in 1916 starts out: \"Jimmy Callahan, pilot of the Pirates, did his best to wreck the hopes the Dodgers have of gaining the National League pennant\", but then goes on to comment: \"the only thing that saved the Superbas from being toppled from first place was that the Phillies lost one of the two games played\". What is interesting about the use of these two nicknames is that most baseball statistics sites and baseball historians generally now refer to the pennant-winning 1916 Brooklyn team as the Robins. A 1918 New York Times article uses the nickname in its title: \"Buccaneers Take Last From Robins\", but the subtitle of the article reads: \"Subdue The Superbas By 11 To 4, Making Series An Even Break\".\nAnother example of the use of the many nicknames is found on the program issued at Ebbets Field for the 1920 World Series, which identifies the matchup in the series as \"Dodgers vs. Indians\" despite the fact that the Robins nickname had been in consistent use for around six years. The \"Robins\" nickname was derived from the name of their Hall of Fame manager, Wilbert Robinson, who led the team from 1914 to 1931.\nUniforms.\nThe Dodgers' uniform has remained relatively unchanged since the 1930s. The home jersey is white with \"Dodgers\" written in script across the chest in royal. The road jersey is gray with \"Los Angeles\" written in script across the chest in royal. The word \"Dodgers\" was first used on the front of the team's home jersey in 1933; the uniform was then white with red pinstripes and a stylized \"B\" on the left shoulder. The Dodgers also wore green outlined uniforms and green caps throughout the 1937 season but reverted to blue the following year.\nThe current design was created in 1939 and has remained the same ever since with only cosmetic changes. Originally intended for the 1951 World Series for which the ballclub failed to qualify, red numbers under the \"Dodgers\" script were added to the home uniform in 1952. The road jersey also has a red uniform number under the script. When the franchise moved from Brooklyn to Los Angeles, the city name on the road jersey changed, and the stylized \"B\" was replaced with the interlocking \"LA\" on the caps in 1958. In 1970, the Dodgers removed the city name from the road jerseys and had \"Dodgers\" on both the home and away uniforms. The city script returned to the road jerseys in 1999, and the tradition-rich Dodgers flirted with an alternate uniform for the first time since 1944 (when all-blue satin uniforms were introduced). These 1999 alternate jerseys had a royal top with the \"Dodgers\" script in white across the chest, and the red number on the front. These were worn with white pants and a new cap with a silver brim, a top button, and a Dodger logo. These alternates proved unpopular and the team abandoned them after only one season. They would, however, bring back the blue jerseys in recent years but only wear them in spring training games. In 2014, the Dodgers introduced an alternate road jersey: a gray version with the \"Dodgers\" script instead of the city name. Since its introduction, however, the road jersey with the \"Dodgers\" script was used more often than the road jersey with the \"Los Angeles\" script, so much that the team now considers it as a primary road uniform. In 2018, the Dodgers wore their 60th anniversary patch to honor the 60 years of being in Los Angeles.\nIn 2021, the Dodgers again unveiled a blue alternate uniform, this time as part of the \"City Connect\" series in collaboration with Nike. This uniform was similar to the blue alternates they wore in 1999, but with the script \"Los Dodgers\" in homage to Los Angeles' Latino community. The uniform is also worn with blue pants, and black stripes are added to the sleeves. Initially, the Dodgers wore a special blue cap with the \"Los Dodgers\" script but switched in 2022 to a blue interlocking \"LA\" cap with a black brim. The \"Los Dodgers\" script was then relocated to the right side. In 2023, white pants with blue piping replaced the blue pants previously worn with the \"City Connect\" uniform.\nMidway through the 2024 season, the Dodgers unveiled their second \"City Connect\" uniform. The cream-based uniform paid homage to the city of Los Angeles and various chapters of the city's history that are connected to the team. The \"Los Angeles\" wordmark was inspired by the signage of the Dodgers' original home of Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum and was slanted upward. The number font was inspired by the mid-century typefaces that were popular during the team's early years in Los Angeles. The uniform also featured two different shades of blue: cobalt and electric, while \"chili red\" was based on the chest number colors the team had worn since the 1950s. The cobalt blue cap featured the \"interlocking LA\" and script \"D\" from the \"Dodgers\" logo merged to form the LAD team code; the said logo also appears as a sleeve patch. Above the manufacturer's tag is the hashtag #ITFDB, a reference to broadcaster Vin Scully's catchphrase \"It's time for Dodger baseball!\".\nAsian players.\nThe Dodgers have been pioneers in signing players from Asia, particularly Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan. Then-owner Peter O'Malley began reaching out in 1980 by starting clinics in China and South Korea and building baseball fields in two Chinese cities. In 1998, the Dodgers became the first major league team to open an office in Asia. They were the second team to start a Japanese player, and first in nearly 30 years (pitcher Hideo Nomo); the first team to start a South Korean player (pitcher Chan Ho Park); and the first to start a Taiwanese player (Chin-Feng Chen).\nIn 2005, the Dodgers' Hee Seop Choi became the first Asian player to compete in the Home Run Derby.\nIn the 2008 season, no team had more Asian players on its roster than the Dodgers: Park; Japan's Takashi Saito and countryman Hiroki Kuroda; and Taiwan's pitcher Hong-Chih Kuo and infielder Chin-Lung Hu. On May 17, 2008, they became the first team to send out three Asian pitchers from different Asian countries in a single game: Park, Kuo, and Saito against the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim.\nFor the 2013 season, the Dodgers signed starting pitcher Hyun-Jin Ryu with a six-year, $36\u00a0million contract, after posting a bid of nearly $27\u00a0million to acquire him from the KBO's Hanhwa Eagles. For the 2016 season, the Dodgers signed starting pitcher Kenta Maeda with an eight-year, $25\u00a0million contract, after posting a bid of $20\u00a0million to acquire him from the NPB's Hiroshima Toyo Carp. For the 2024 season, the Dodgers signed free agent two-way player Shohei Ohtani with a 10-year, $700\u00a0million contract, the largest in professional sports history.\nRivalries.\nThe Dodgers' rivalry with the San Francisco Giants dates to the 19th century when the two teams were based in New York; the rivalry with the New York Yankees took place when the Dodgers were based in New York, but was revived with their East Coast/West Coast World Series battles in 1963, 1977, 1978, and 1981. The Dodgers' rivalries with the Philadelphia Phillies and St. Louis Cardinals also dates back to their days in New York, but were most fierce during the 1960s, 1980s, and 2000s-2010s.\nThe Dodgers also shared a heated rivalry with the Cincinnati Reds during the 1970s, 1980s and early 1990s. The Dodgers had even shared a rather volatile rivalry with divisional foes; the Arizona Diamondbacks during most of the 2010s. Their intra-city rivalry with the Los Angeles Angels dates back to the Angels' inaugural season in 1961. The Dodgers have recently revived an old Southern California-based rivalry with the San Diego Padres dating back to the Padres' inaugural season in 1969. Most recently; the Dodgers have also regrown a heated rivalry against the former divisional foe Houston Astros after their move to the American League, due in no small part to the controversy of the 2017 World Series.\nDivisional.\nSan Francisco Giants.\nThe Dodgers\u2013Giants rivalry is one of the oldest and fiercest rivalries in North American sports.\nThe feud between the Dodgers and the San Francisco Giants began in the late 19th century when both clubs were based in New York City, with the Dodgers playing in Brooklyn and the Giants playing at the Polo Grounds in Manhattan. After the 1957 season, Dodgers owner Walter O'Malley moved the team to Los Angeles for financial and other reasons. Along the way, he managed to convince Giants owner Horace Stoneham\u2014who was considering moving his team to Minnesota\u2014to preserve the rivalry by bringing his team to California as well. New York baseball fans were stunned and heartbroken by the move. Given that the cities of Los Angeles and San Francisco have been bitter rivals in economic, cultural, and political arenas for over a century and a half, the new venue in California became fertile ground for its transplantation.\nEach team's ability to endure for over a century while moving across an entire continent, as well as the rivalry's leap from a cross-city to a cross-state engagement, have led to the rivalry being considered one of the greatest in American sports history.\nUnlike many other historic baseball match-ups in which one team remains dominant for most of their history, the Dodgers\u2013Giants rivalry has exhibited a persistent balance in the respective successes of the two teams. While the Giants have more wins in franchise history, the Dodgers have the most National League pennants at 26, with the Giants following close behind at 23. The Dodgers have won nine World Series titles to the Giants' eight. and the Giants. The 2010 World Series was the Giants' first championship since moving to California, while the Dodgers had won seven World Series titles since their move, their last title coming in the 2025 World Series.\nIn 2021, the Dodgers and Giants both finished the regular season with over 100 wins, with the latter clinching the division with a record of 107\u201355. The Dodgers were one game behind with a record of 106\u201356, relegating them to the NL Wild Card Game, in which they defeated the St. Louis Cardinals. This resulted in the first postseason matchup between the Dodgers and Giants in the NLDS. With a combined 213 regular season wins, this is the most number of regular season wins between competing teams in any MLB postseason series. The Dodgers ultimately won in the decisive Game 5, but would lose in the NLCS to the eventual World Series champions: Atlanta Braves.\nSan Diego Padres.\nThe Padres' rivalry with the Dodgers has often been lopsided in favor of Los Angeles; however, recent growth between the two teams in competition has added intensity on top of proximity between Los Angeles and San Diego.\nThe Dodgers currently lead the series 518\u2013419, with the two teams meeting in the playoffs three times. The Dodgers swept the Padres in the 2020 NLDS, won in five games in the 2024 NLDS, and the Padres won in four games in the 2022 NLDS.\nArizona Diamondbacks.\nThe rivalry between the Dodgers and the Arizona Diamondbacks was one of the fiercest divisional matchups for multiple years, particularly during the 2010s when both teams were in regular contention for control of the division. In addition to the elevated competition, animosity rose immensely between both sides resulting in multiple incidents involving either team throwing pitches at one another, occasionally escalating into several bench-clearing brawls.\nAfter eliminating the Diamondbacks and clinching the division on September 19, 2013, multiple Dodgers players celebrated the win by jumping into the pool at Chase Field. On December 8, 2015, Zack Greinke signed a six-year, $206.5 million contract with the Diamondbacks in free agency. Both teams met during the 2017 National League Division Series; the Diamondbacks were swept 3\u20130 by the Dodgers en route to their appearance in the World Series. The teams rematched in the 2023 National League Division Series, with the Diamondbacks returning the favor with a 3\u20130 sweep of their own as they eventually reached the World Series. The Dodgers lead the series 259\u2013193, with the teams tied 3\u20133 in the postseason.\nNational League.\nSt. Louis Cardinals.\nPrimarily a playoff rivalry; since 1892, The Dodgers and St. Louis Cardinals have met six times in the postseason. The Cardinals have won four, including two NLCS series, while the Dodgers won the 2009 NLDS and the 2021 National League Wild Card Game.\nCincinnati Reds.\nThe Dodgers' rivalry with the Cincinnati Reds was one of the most intense during the 1970s through the early 1990s. They often competed for the NL West division title. From 1970 to 1990, they had eleven 1\u20132 finishes in the standings, with seven of them being within 5\u00bd games or fewer. Both teams also played in numerous championships during this span, combining to win 10 NL Pennants and 5 World Series titles from 1970\u20131990, most notably as the Big Red Machine teams clashed frequently with the Tommy Lasorda-era Dodgers teams. Reds manager Sparky Anderson once said, \"I don't think there's a rivalry like ours in either league. The Giants are supposed to be the Dodgers' natural rivals, but I don't think the feeling is there anymore. It's not there the way it is with us and the Dodgers.\" The rivalry ended when division realignment moved the Reds to the NL Central. However, they did face one another in the 1995 NLDS.\nAmerican League.\nLos Angeles Angels.\nThis rivalry refers to a series of games played with the Los Angeles Angels. The Freeway Series takes its name from the massive freeway system in the greater Los Angeles metropolitan area, the home of both teams; one could travel from one team's stadium to the other simply by traveling along Interstate 5. The term is akin to \"Subway Series,\" a term for meetings between New York City baseball teams. The term \"Freeway Series\" also inspired the official name of the region's NHL rivalry: the \"Freeway Face-Off.\"\nAnimosity between the team's fanbases grew in 2005, when the Angels' new team owner Arte Moreno changed the name of his ball club from the 'Anaheim Angels', to the 'Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim'. Since the city of Anaheim is roughly 30 miles from Downtown Los Angeles, the Angels franchise was ridiculed throughout the league for the contradictory name, especially by Dodgers owner Frank McCourt, who filed a formal complaint to commissioner Bud Selig. After the complaint was denied, McCourt ordered a t-shirt reading \"The Los Angeles Dodgers of Los Angeles\", which remains popular among fans to this day.\nNew York Yankees.\nThe Dodgers' rivalry with the New York Yankees is among the best-known rivalries in Major League Baseball. The two teams have met 12 times in the World Series, more than any other two teams from the American and National Leagues. The rivalry began when the Dodgers played in Brooklyn. After the Dodgers moved to Los Angeles in 1958, the teams represented the two largest U.S. cities since the 1980s.\nThe teams have met in numerous World Series, although they went 40 years without doing so, from 1981 until 2024. They would not play each other in a non-exhibition game until 2004, when they played a three-game interleague series. Their last meeting in the regular season was from May 30-June 1 2025, when the Dodgers won two out of three games in Los Angeles.\nHouston Astros.\nThe rivalry between the Dodgers and the Houston Astros began as a divisional matchup, but hostility waned after Houston moved to the American League. In 2017, the two teams faced off in the 2017 World Series, which the Astros won in seven games using a sign-stealing system to steal pitch signs. The Dodgers lead the all-time series 400\u2013334; the teams are tied in postseason wins 6\u20136.\nFan support.\nAttendance rose from eleventh in MLB during the Dodgers' final season in Brooklyn to second in their first season in Los Angeles. Team owner Walter O'Malley feared that the planned Dodger Stadium would be too large to fill regularly, but the Dodgers led the league in attendance by a sizeable margin for the 1962 season, nearly doubling that of the New York Yankees.\nIn 2012, a \"Bleacher Report\" article called Dodgers fans the best in Los Angeles. \nAttendance records.\nIn 1978 the Dodgers became the first MLB team to attract more than three\u00a0million fans in a season, and repeated the feat six more times before any other franchise reached three million fans overall. The Dodgers drew at least three\u00a0million fans for 15 consecutive seasons from 1996 to 2010, the longest such streak among all MLB teams. The team's largest fan club, Pantone 294 (a reference to the Pantone code of Dodger blue), regularly travels to away games to cheer for the Dodgers. The Dodgers have regularly placed in the top three in attendance, or have led the league numerous times since 2000, excluding the 2020 season; the Dodgers have recently led the league in attendance for nine straight seasons going back to 2013.\nOn July 3, 2007, Dodgers management announced that total franchise attendance, dating back to 1901, had reached 175\u00a0million, a record for all professional sports. In 2007, the Dodgers set a franchise record for single-season attendance, attracting over 3.8\u00a0million fans. On March 28, 2008, the Dodgers set the world record for the largest attendance for a single baseball game during an exhibition game against the Boston Red Sox at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum in honor of the Dodgers' 50th anniversary, with 115,300 fans in attendance. In 2009, the Dodgers led MLB in total attendance. The Dodger baseball cap is consistently in the top three in sales.\nPrimarily, Dodgers fans originate from most of southern or central California and also parts of southern Nevada. The fanbase has also extended out to states across the southwest such as Arizona, New Mexico and even western Texas. In 2015, Vivid Seats reported that the Dodgers were the most popular MLB team in Utah based on ticket sales. Dodgers' away games throughout the US will usually attract substantial numbers of expats and traveling fans.\nHome games often draw Hollywood celebrities, including team co-owner Magic Johnson, Flea, Mary Hart, DaBaby, Larry King, Tiger Woods, Alyssa Milano, Shia LaBeouf, George Lopez, Lana Del Rey, Mila Kunis and Ashton Kutcher. Some sit at field box seats behind home plate where they sign autographs for fellow Dodger fans. Actor Bryan Cranston is a lifelong Dodger fan.\nInternational.\nThe Dodgers have a devoted following in Mexico because of Mexican players such as Fernando Valenzuela, Ismael Vald\u00e9z, and Julio Urias. The Sonora-born, California-raised Mel Almada, the first Mexican-born player to play in the MLB, played for the Dodgers near the end of his career in 1939. An estimated 54% of fans in home attendance are of Mexican descent. The team boosted its Asian fanbase with players such as Hideo Nomo, Hiroki Kuroda, Kenta Maeda, and Yu Darvish. The Dodgers signed Chan Ho Park, the first South Korean-born MLB player, and in 2013, All-Star pitcher Hyun Jin Ryu. The team worked with the Korean communities of Los Angeles to launch an annual Korean Heritage night in 2016. The Dodgers signed the first Taiwanese player in MLB: Chin-Feng Chen in 2002; other Taiwanese players such as Chin-Lung Hu and Chin-Hui Tsao later signed.\nThe Dodgers signed Japanese star Shohei Ohtani, then launched theme nights in collaboration with Japanese companies such as Sanrio (which sponsored a Hello Kitty night, headlined by the national anthem being performed by Japanese musician and X Japan member Yoshiki), and VTuber agency Hololive (which also coincided with Los Angeles' Anime Expo).\nRadio and television.\nAs of 2023, the primary play-by-play announcers on television and radio, respectively, are Joe Davis and Charley Steiner, with Orel Hershiser (TV) and Rick Monday (radio) working as the primary color commentators. On some games, Stephen Nelson would fill in for Davis during his national assignments with Fox Sports, with Davis typically working as the lead voice of the MLB on Fox and as one of the play-by-play voices of the NFL on Fox. Nomar Garciaparra, Eric Karros, Dontrelle Willis and Jessica Mendoza often fill in for Hershiser on select games. On the radio side, Tim Neverett works play-by-play on select games, and also fills in for Davis on television broadcasts.\nFrom 1950 to 2016, almost all Dodger games were called by Vin Scully. His longtime partners were Jerry Doggett (1956\u20131987) and Ross Porter (1977\u20132004). In 1976, he was selected by Dodgers fans as the Most Memorable Personality (on the field or off) in the team's history. He is also a recipient of the Baseball Hall of Fame's Ford C. Frick Award for broadcasters (inducted in 1982). Unlike the modern style in which multiple sportscasters have an on-air conversation (usually with one functioning as play-by-play announcer and the other[s] as color commentator), Scully, Doggett, and Porter generally called games solo, trading with each other inning-by-inning. In the 1980s and 1990s, Scully would call the entire radio broadcast except for the third and seventh inning, allowing the other Dodger commentators to broadcast an inning. Fans and critics alike frequently praised Scully due in large part for his longevity with the team, and his ability to provide peculiar details about multiple players appearing onfield. Despite his longevity and a strong relationship with the team and fanbase, Scully was also praised for his relatively unbiased view of any game he called, often referring to the listeners as 'friends' instead of 'fans'.\nWhen Doggett retired after the 1987 season, he was replaced by Hall-of-Fame Dodgers pitcher Don Drysdale, who previously broadcast games for the California Angels and Chicago White Sox. Drysdale died in his hotel room following a heart attack before a game in Montreal in 1993. This was a difficult broadcast for Scully and Porter who could not mention it on-air until Drysdale's family had been notified and the official announcement made. He was replaced by former Dodgers outfielder Rick Monday. Porter's tenure ended after the 2004 season, after which the format of play-by-play announcers and color commentators was installed, led by Monday and newcomer Charley Steiner. Scully, however, continued to announce solo.\nScully called roughly 100 games per season (all home games and road games in California and Arizona) for both flagship radio station KLAC and on television for Spectrum SportsNet LA. Scully was simulcast for the first three innings of each of his appearances, then announced only for the TV audience. If Scully was calling the game, Steiner took over play-by-play on the radio beginning with the fourth inning, with Monday as color commentator. If Scully was not calling the game, Steiner and Orel Hershiser called the entire game on television while Monday and Kevin Kennedy did the same on radio. In the event the Dodgers were in post-season play, Scully called the first three and last three innings of the radio broadcast alone, and Steiner &amp; Monday handled the middle innings. Vin Scully retired from calling games in 2016. His tenure with the Dodgers was the longest with any single sports team at 67 years. Youthful announcer Joe Davis was selected in 2017 by Dodgers management to handle play-by-play on television with Orel Hershiser as his colorman.\nThe Dodgers also broadcast on radio in two other languages, Spanish and Korean. Upon moving to Los Angeles in 1958, the Dodgers became the first MLB team with a Spanish-language flagship station, KWKW (1300 AM), with a broadcast team that included Ren\u00e9 C\u00e1rdenas. From 1959 to 2022, the Spanish play-by-play was voiced by another Frick Award winner, Jaime Jarr\u00edn. Until his death in 2024, a color analyst for some games was former Dodger pitcher Fernando Valenzuela, for whom Jarrin once translated post-game interviews. Valenzuela was joined on the Spanish booth in 2023 and 2024 by Pepe Y\u00f1iguez and Jos\u00e9 Mota, son of Dodger legend Manny Mota. The Spanish-language radio flagship station is KTNQ. Meanwhile, the Dodgers' Korean broadcast began in 2013 through KMPC.\nAchievements.\nRetired numbers.\nKoufax, Campanella, and Robinson were the first Dodgers to have their numbers retired, in a ceremony at Dodger Stadium on June 4, 1972. Although other MLB teams had already been retiring numbers for decades, the Dodgers were late to the trend. The Dodgers had wanted to retire Robinson's No. 42 for some time, but Robinson had consistently rejected the honor due to a long-running grudge with Dodgers owner Walter O'Malley. Robinson did not agree to appear at a number retirement ceremony until O'Malley handed over control of the team to his son Peter in 1970.\nAlthough the Dodgers website states that there are no \"written 'criteria' for retiring uniform numbers,\" the team has historically retired only the numbers of individuals who played most of their career with the Dodgers and are members of the Baseball Hall of Fame. (Underscoring the principle, Koufax, Snider, Reese, Drysdale, Lasorda, Sutton, and Hodges all had their numbers retired during the seasons in which they were inducted into the Hall. Robinson and Campanella had already been Hall of Famers for several years when their numbers were retired in 1972.) There have only been three exceptions:\nIn 1997, 50 years after he broke the color barrier and 25 years after the Dodgers retired his number, Robinson's No. 42 was retired throughout Major League Baseball. Robinson is the only major league baseball player so honored. Starting in the 2007 season, Jackie Robinson Day (April 15, commemorating the Opening Day of Robinson's rookie season of 1947) has featured many or all players and coaches wearing the number 42 as a tribute to Robinson.\nA broader term, the Dodgers \"Ring of Honor,\" encompasses both the retired numbers and three non-baseball personnel whose insignia are displayed alongside the retired numbers. Longtime broadcasters Vin Scully (English) and Jaime Jarr\u00edn (Spanish) are honored with microphone symbols. Team owner Walter O'Malley, who moved the Dodgers to Los Angeles, is honored with the team \"LA\" logo. All three have been recognized by the Hall of Fame, O'Malley by induction, and Scully and Jarr\u00edn by the Ford C. Frick Award for broadcasters.\nBaseball Hall of Famers.\nLos Angeles Dodgers Hall of Famers\nAffiliation according to the National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum\nBrooklyn Bridegrooms/Superbas/Robins/Dodgers\nLos Angeles Dodgers\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Plainlist/styles.css\"/&gt;\nFord C.

The program honors those who made an \"impact on the franchise, both on and off the field.\" Recipients are recognized with plaques at Dodger Stadium.\nPersonnel.\nManagers.\nSince 1884, the Dodgers have used a total of 31 Managers, the most current being Dave Roberts, who was appointed following the 2015 postseason, after the departure of Don Mattingly.\nOver the nearly 43 years from 1954 to mid-1996, the Dodgers employed only two managers, Walter Alston and Tommy Lasorda, both of whom are in the Hall of Fame. During this entire time period of extraordinary stability, the Dodgers were family-owned by Walter O'Malley and then his son Peter O'Malley. It was during this era that the Dodgers won 11 of their 24 pennants and their first six World Series championships.\nThe managers of the Los Angeles Dodgers (1958\u2013present) are as follows:\nPublic address announcers/organists.\nFrom the Dodgers' move to Los Angeles from Brooklyn in 1958, the Dodgers employed a handful of well-known public address announcers; the most famous of which was John Ramsey, who served as the PA voice of the Dodgers from 1958 until his retirement in 1982; he was also well known for announcing at other venerable Los Angeles venues, including the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum and Sports Arena, and the Forum. Ramsey died in 1990.\nFrom 1958 to 1982, Doug Moore, Philip Petty, and Dennis Packer served as back-up voices for John Ramsey for the Dodgers, California Angels, Los Angeles Chargers, USC football, and Los Angeles Rams. Packer was Ramsey's primary backup for the Los Angeles Lakers and Los Angeles Kings until Ramsey's retirement from the Forum in 1978. Thereafter, Packer became the public address announcer for the Lakers, Kings, indoor soccer, and indoor tennis events at the Forum.\nNick Nickson, a radio broadcaster for the Los Angeles Kings, replaced John Ramsey as the Dodger Stadium public address announcer in 1983 and served in that capacity through the 1989 season to work with the Kings full-time.\nDennis Packer and Pete Arbogast were emulators of John Ramsey, using the same stentorian style of announcing Ramsey was famous for. Packer and Arbogast shared the stadium announcing chores for the 1994 FIFA World Cup matches at the Rose Bowl. Arbogast won the Dodgers job on the day that Ramsey died on January 25, 1990, by doing a verbatim imitation of Ramsey's opening and closing remarks that were standard at each game. His replacement, in 1994 was Mike Carlucci, who remained as the Dodgers' PA voice announcer until he resigned in 2002 to concentrate on his voiceover and acting career along with his Olympics announcing duties.\nFrom 2003 to 2014, the Dodgers public address announcer was Eric Smith, who also announces for the Los Angeles Clippers and USC Trojans.\nOn April 3, 2015, the Dodgers announced that former radio broadcaster Todd Leitz was hired to become their new public address announcer. Leitz was an anchor and news reporter in Los Angeles at KNX 1070 AM for 10 years, and a news reporter at KABC 790 for two years.\nFrom 1988 to 2015, Nancy Bea Hefley enjoyed popularity behind the Dodger Stadium keyboard similar to Gladys Goodding. Since retirement in 2015, Bea's replacement and current organist is Dieter Ruehle, who also plays at Crypto.com Arena for Los Angeles Kings games.\nOther.\nVin Scully is permanently honored in the Baseball Hall of Fame's \"Scribes &amp; Mikemen\" exhibit as a result of winning the Ford C. Frick Award in 1982. Frick Award recipients are not official members of the Hall.\nAllan Roth was the first person hired as the official statistician of a Major League team when he was hired by the Brooklyn Dodgers in 1947. He continued his tenure with Los Angeles until 1964.\nSue Falsone, was the first female physical therapist in Major League baseball, and from 2012 to 2013, was the first female head athletic trainer.\nMinor league affiliations.\nThe Los Angeles Dodgers farm system consists of seven minor league affiliates.\nExplanatory notes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Considered the most influential Dutch composer of his generation, he was a central proponent of The Hague school of composition. Although his music was initially dominated by neoclassicism and serialism, his style gradually shifted to a synthesis of American minimalism, big band jazz and the expressionism of Igor Stravinsky.\nBorn in Utrecht into a musical family, Andriessen studied with his father, the composer Hendrik Andriessen as well as composers Kees van Baaren and Luciano Berio. Andriessen taught at the Royal Conservatory of The Hague from 1974 to 2012, influencing notable composers. His opera \"La Commedia\", based on Dante's \"Divine Comedy\", won the 2011 Grawemeyer Award for Music Composition and was selected in 2019 by critics at \"The Guardian\" as one of the most outstanding compositions of the 21st century.\nLife and career.\nAndriessen was born in Utrecht on 6 June 1939 to a musical family, the son of the composer Hendrik Andriessen and Johanna Justina Ansch\u00fctz (1898\u20131975). His father was professor of composition at the Royal Conservatory of The Hague, and later its director. His siblings were composers Jurriaan Andriessen (1925\u20131966) and Caecilia Andriessen (1931\u20132019), and he is the nephew of Willem Andriessen (1887\u20131964).\nAndriessen originally studied with his father and Kees van Baaren at the Royal Conservatory of The Hague, graduating in 1961 with a first prize, before embarking upon two years of study with Italian composer Luciano Berio in Milan and Berlin. His father introduced him to the works of Francis Poulenc and Eric Satie which he came to love. From 1961\u201365, Andriessen wrote for the daily \"De Volkskrant\", and for \"De Gids\" magazine from 1966\u201369. Andriessen lived in Amsterdam starting in 1965.\nIn 1969, he was part of a group of protesters at a concert of the Concertgebouw Orchestra. They disrupted the concert with nutcrackers and bicycle horns, handing out leaflets on the dismal representation of Dutch new music in the orchestra's programming. The next year, he and the other \"Nutcrackers\" were given one-week prison sentences, and yet their protest sparked something of a social reform in the Dutch music scene.\nAndriessen was internationally recognised as a composer with his 1976 \"De Staat\" which included texts from Plato's \"Republic\". He was one of the founders of the Hague School, an avant-garde and minimalist movement from the second half of the 20th century. In later decades, he accepted commissions from major orchestras, including the San Francisco Symphony, the Los Angeles Philharmonic, the BBC Symphony Orchestra and the New York Philharmonic. Andriessen was the focus of festivals in Tanglewood (1994), London (1994; 2002), Tokyo (2000), Brisbane (2001) and New York (2004). In 2008, he was elected an honorary member of the International Society for Contemporary Music ISCM. He held the Richard and Barbara Debs Composer's Chair at Carnegie Hall during the 2009\u201310 season.\nEnsembles.\nIn 1969, Andriessen co-founded Studio voor Elektro-Instrumentale Muziek STEIM in Amsterdam. In opposition to the classical orchestra, a structure seen as \"hierarchical\", he also helped founding the instrumental groups Orkest de Volharding and Hoketus, both of which performed compositions of the same names, formed by classical, jazz and pop musicians. He later became closely involved with the Schonberg and Asko ensembles and inspired the formation of the British ensemble Icebreaker.\nTeaching.\nAndriessen joined the faculty of the Royal Conservatory in 1974. He taught instrumentation from 1974 to 1978 and taught composition there from 1978 to 2012, where he influenced notable students including Michel van der Aa, Richard Ayres and Steve Martland. Yale University invited him in 1987 to lecture on theory and composition, he was also guest lecturer at New York State University, Buffalo (1989) and Princeton (1996). The arts faculty of the University of Leiden appointed him professor in 2004. One of his students was Raminta \u0160erk\u0161nyt\u0117, a Lithuanian pianist and composer.\nPersonal life.\nAndriessen was married to guitarist Jeanette Yanikian (1935\u20132008). They were a couple for over 40 years, and were married in 1996. \"La Commedia\" is dedicated to Yanikian. He was married in 2012 a second time to violinist Monica Germino, for whom he wrote several works. In December 2020, she announced that Andriessen was suffering from dementia. He died on 1 July 2021 in Weesp at age 82.\nAndriessen had one son, Lodewijk Torenbos-Andriessen, with dancer and theatre director Betsy Torenbos.\nStyle and notable works.\nAndriessen began in the style of an intentionally dry neoclassicism, but then turned into a strict serialist. His early works show experimentation with various contemporary trends: post-war serialism (\"Series\", 1958), pastiche (\"Anachronie I\", 1966\u201367), and tape (\"Il Duce\", 1973). His reaction to what he perceived as the conservatism of much of the Dutch contemporary music scene quickly moved him to form a radically alternative musical aesthetic of his own. From the early 1970s on he refused to write for conventional symphony orchestras and instead opted to write for his own idiosyncratic instrumental combinations, which often retain some traditional orchestral instruments alongside electric guitars, electric basses, and congas. Andriessen repeatedly used his music for political confessions and messages, but he also referred to painting and philosophy. His range of inspiration was wide, including the music of Charles Ives in \"Anachronie I\", the art of Piet Mondrian in \"De Stijl\", the visions of Beguine mystic Hadewijch in \"Hadewijch\", and shipbuilding and atomic theory in \"De Materie\" Part I.\nAndriessen's later style is a unique blend of American sounds and European forms. His mature music combines the influences of jazz, American minimalism, and the music of Igor Stravinsky and Claude Vivier, containing minimalist-influenced polyrhythms, lyrical melodic fragments, and predominantly consonant harmonies disrupted by concentrated dissonance. Andriessen's music thus departs from post-war European serialism and its offshoots. By the 21st century he was widely regarded as Europe's most important minimalist composer.\nHis notable works include \"Workers Union\" (1975), a melodically indeterminate piece \"for any loud sounding group of instruments\" whose score specifies rhythm and contour but not exact pitch; \"Mausoleum\" (1979) for two baritones and large ensemble; \"De Tijd\" (\"Time\", 1979\u201381) for female singers and ensemble; \"De Snelheid\" (\"Velocity\", 1982\u201383), for three amplified ensembles; \"De Materie\" (\"Matter\", 1984\u201388), a large four-part work for voices and ensemble; collaborations with filmmaker and librettist Peter Greenaway on the film \"M is for Man, Music, Mozart\" and the operas \"Rosa: A Horse Drama\" (1994) and \"Writing to Vermeer\" (1998); and \"La Passione\" (2000\u201302) for female voice, violin and ensemble. His 2008 opera \"La Commedia\", based on Dante's \"Divine Comedy\", won the 2011 Grawemeyer Award for Music Composition and was selected by critics at \"The Guardian\" as one of the most outstanding classical compositions of the 21st century in 2019.\nWorks.\nAndriessen's primary publishers are Boosey &amp; Hawkes and Donemus.\nComplete list of works:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He was sentenced to two consecutive terms of life imprisonment. Peltier became eligible for parole in 1993. \nOn January 19, 2025, Peltier's sentence was commuted to indefinite house arrest by President Joe Biden shortly before he left office. On February 18, the date specified by the grant of clemency, Peltier was released and transferred to the Turtle Mountain Indian Reservation in Belcourt, North Dakota. \nIn his 1999 memoir \"Prison Writings: My Life Is My Sun Dance\", Peltier admitted to participating in the shootout but said he did not kill the FBI agents. However, witnesses say he confessed, including Darlene Ka-Mook Nichols, who testified against him at trial. Human rights watchdogs, such as Amnesty International, and political figures including Nelson Mandela, Mother Teresa, and the 14th Dalai Lama, campaigned for clemency for Peltier.\nAt the time of the shootout, Peltier was an active member of AIM, an Indigenous rights advocacy group that worked to combat the racism and police brutality experienced by Native Americans.\nEarly life and education.\nPeltier was born on September 12, 1944, at the Turtle Mountain Indian Reservation of the Turtle Mountain Chippewa near Belcourt, North Dakota. He is of Lakota, Dakota, and Anishinaabe descent, and was raised among the Turtle Mountain Chippewa and Fort Totten Sioux Nations of North Dakota. He was one of 13 children. His parents divorced when he was four years old, with Leonard and his sister Betty Ann living with their paternal grandparents Alex and Mary Dubois-Peltier in the Turtle Mountain Indian Reservation.\nIn September 1953, Leonard was enrolled at the Wahpeton Indian School in Wahpeton, North Dakota, an Indian boarding school run by the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA). The school, which was located away from his home in the Turtle Mountain Reservation, practiced forced cultural assimilation of Indigenous children into white American culture by requiring the children to use English and forbidding the inclusion of Native American culture. He graduated from Wahpeton in May 1957 and then attended the Flandreau Indian School in Flandreau, South Dakota. After finishing the ninth grade, he returned to the Turtle Mountain Reservation to live with his father. Peltier later obtained a general equivalency degree (GED).\nCareer and activism.\nIn 1965, Peltier relocated to Seattle, Washington. Peltier worked as a welder, a construction worker, and as the co-owner of an auto shop in Seattle in his twenties. The co-owners used the upper level of the building as a stopping place, or halfway house, for American Indians who had alcohol addiction issues or had recently finished their prison sentences and were re-entering society. The halfway house took a financial toll on the shop, so they closed it.\nIn Seattle, Peltier became involved in a variety of causes championing Native American civil rights. In the early 1970s, he learned about the factional tensions at the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation in South Dakota between supporters of Richard Wilson, elected tribal chairman in 1972, and traditionalist members of the Lakota tribe. It was Dennis Banks who first invited Leonard Peltier to join AIM. Consequently, Peltier became an official member of the American Indian Movement (AIM) in 1972, which was founded by urban Indians in Minneapolis in 1968, at a time of rising Indian activism for civil rights.\nWilson had created a private militia, known as the Guardians of the Oglala Nation (GOON), whose members were reputed to have attacked political opponents. Protests over a failed impeachment hearing of Wilson contributed to the AIM and Lakota armed takeover of Wounded Knee at the reservation in February 1973. Federal forces reacted, conducting a 71-day siege, which became known as the Wounded Knee Occupation. Protestors demanded the resignation of Wilson. Peltier, however, spent most of the occupation in a Milwaukee, Wisconsin jail charged with attempted murder related to a different protest. When Peltier secured bail at the end of April, he took part in an AIM protest outside the federal building in Milwaukee and was on his way to Wounded Knee with the group to deliver supplies when the incident ended.\nIn 1975, Peltier traveled as a member of AIM to the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation to help reduce violence among political opponents. At the time, he was a fugitive, with an arrest warrant having been issued in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. It charged him with unlawful flight to avoid prosecution for the attempted murder of an off-duty Milwaukee police officer. (He was acquitted of the attempted murder charge in February 1978.)\nDuring this period, Peltier had seven children from two marriages and adopted two children.\nShootout at Pine Ridge.\nOn June 26, 1975, FBI Special Agents Ronald Arthur Williams and Jack Ross Coler returned to Pine Ridge to continue searching for a young man named Jimmy Eagle. According to FBI publications, he was wanted for questioning in connection with the recent assault of two local ranch hands and theft of a pair of cowboy boots.\nAround 11:50 a.m., Williams and Coler, driving two separate unmarked cars, radioed that they were following a white and red Chevrolet Suburban Carryall, reportedly carrying Peltier, Norman Charles, and Joe Stuntz. Peltier had an outstanding federal warrant for the attempted murder of a Milwaukee police officer, although Williams and Coler were not aware of this. Charles had met with Williams and Coler the evening before, when the agents explained to Charles they were looking for Eagle. After turning off US 18 into the Jumping Bull Ranch, where the Jumping Bull family had allowed AIM to camp, the occupants of the Suburban stopped and exited the vehicle. A firefight ensued.\nAccording to other FBI agents' recollection (of unrecorded radio transmissions), Williams radioed to a local dispatch that he and Coler had come under fire from the vehicle's occupants and would be killed if reinforcements did not arrive. He next radioed that they both had been shot. FBI Special Agent Gary Adams was the first to respond to Williams' call for assistance from away. But he and the other responding BIA officers also came under gunfire. They were unable to reach Coler and Williams in time, as both agents died within the first ten minutes of gunfire. It was not until about 4:25\u00a0p.m. that authorities recovered the bodies of Williams and Coler from Coler's vehicle. The FBI has stated that Norman Charles fired at the agents with a stolen British .308 rifle, and Peltier from an AR-15 rifle. The two agents had fired a total of five shots: two from Williams' handgun, one from Coler's handgun, one from Coler's rifle, and one from Coler's shotgun. In total, 125 bullet holes were found in the agents' vehicles, many from a .223 Remington AR-15 rifle. Coler was 28 years old and Williams was 27.\nThe FBI reported that Williams received a defensive wound to his right hand (as he attempted to shield his face) from a bullet that passed through his hand into his head. Williams was shot in the body and foot, before the lethal contact shot to the head. Coler, incapacitated from earlier bullet wounds, was shot twice in the head.\nWilliams's car was driven into the AIM camp farther south on the Jumping Bull property and stripped. The agents' guns were stolen. Allegedly, Darrelle Butler took Williams' handgun, Peltier took Coler's, and Robert Robideau took Coler's .308 and shotgun. Stuntz was found wearing Coler's FBI jacket after he was shot and killed by a BIA agent later that day.\nAftermath.\nAt least three men were arrested in connection with the shooting: Peltier, Robert Robideau, and Darrelle \"Dino\" Butler, all AIM members who were present at the Jumping Bull compound at the time of the shootings.\nPeltier provided numerous alibis to several people about his activities on the morning of the attacks. In an interview for Peter Matthiessen's 1983 book \"In the Spirit of Crazy Horse\", Peltier described working on a car in Oglala, claiming he had driven back to the Jumping Bull Compound about an hour before the shooting started. In an interview with Lee Hill, though, he described being awakened in his tent at the ranch encampment by the sound of gunshots; but to Harvey Arden, for \"Prison Writings\", he described enjoying the beautiful morning before he heard the firing. In his 1999 memoir \"Prison Writings: My Life Is My Sun Dance\", Peltier admitted to participating in the shootout but said he did not kill the FBI agents.\nOn September 5, Butler was arrested; Agent Williams' handgun and ammunition were recovered from an automobile in the vicinity. Four days later, Peltier bought a station wagon. The following day, AIM member Robideau, Charles and Anderson were injured in the accidental explosion of ammunition from Peltier's station wagon on the Kansas Turnpike close to Wichita. Coler's .308 and an AR-15 were found in the burned vehicle. The FBI forwarded a description of a recreational vehicle (RV) and Peltier's Plymouth station wagon to law enforcement during the hunt for the suspects. The RV was stopped by an Oregon state trooper, but the driver, later discovered to be Peltier, fled on foot after a small shootout. Peltier's thumbprint and Coler's handgun were discovered under the RV's front seat.\nTrial.\nOn December 22, 1975, Peltier was named to the FBI Ten Most Wanted Fugitives list. On February 6, 1976, Peltier was arrested along with Frank Blackhorse by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police in Hinton, Alberta, Canada at the Smallboy Camp, transported to Calgary, Alberta and taken to the Oakalla Prison Farm in Vancouver, British Columbia.\nIn December 1976, Peltier was extradited from Canada based on documents submitted by the FBI. Warren Allmand, Canada's Solicitor General at the time, later stated that these documents contained false information. (Blackhorse was also extradited to the United States, but charges against him related to the reservation shootout were dropped.) One of the documents relied on in Peltier's extradition was an affidavit signed by Myrtle Poor Bear, a Native American woman local to the area near Pine Ridge Reservation. While Poor Bear stated that she was Peltier's girlfriend during that time and had watched the killings, Peltier and others at the scene said that Poor Bear did not know Peltier and was not present during the murders. Poor Bear later admitted to lying to the FBI, but said the agents interviewing her had coerced her into making the claims. When Poor Bear tried to testify against the FBI, the judge barred her testimony because of mental incompetence. However, the Canadian government later reviewed the extradition and concluded it had been lawful since \"the circumstantial evidence presented at the extradition hearing, taken alone, constituted sufficient evidence to justify Mr. Peltier's committal on two murder charges.\"\nPeltier fought extradition to the United States. Robideau and Butler were acquitted on grounds of self-defense by a federal jury in Cedar Rapids, Iowa since the forensic evidence showed they had not been the ones to execute the agents and the government had no witnesses at the time who could prove they knew they were attacking FBI officers. This was not the case in Peltier's trial, where the FBI had forensic evidence and eyewitnesses that together linked Peltier directly to the killings of the officers.\nPeltier's trial was held in Fargo, North Dakota, where a jury convicted him of the murders of Coler and Williams. Unlike in the trial for Butler and Robideau, the FBI produced forensic evidence that the two FBI agents were killed by close-range shots to their heads, when they were already defenseless because of previous gunshot wounds. Consequently, Peltier could not submit a self-defense testimony like the other activists had. The jury was also shown autopsy and crime scene photographs of the two agents, which had not been shown to the jury at Cedar Rapids. In April 1977, Peltier was convicted and sentenced to two consecutive life sentences.\nSome organizations have raised doubts about Peltier's guilt and the fairness of his trial, based on alleged inconsistencies in the FBI and prosecution's handling of the case. Two witnesses in the initial trial recanted their statements and stated they were made under duress at the hands of the FBI. At least one witness was given immunity from prosecution in exchange for testimony against Peltier.\nDuring a June 8, 2024, interview by Native News Online, Peltier's serving attorney Kevin Sharp \u2013 who has also served as U.S. District Judge for the Middle District of Tennessee from 2011 to 2017, including as Chief Judge from 2014 to 2017 \u2013 stated the following:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\"Pine Ridge was a powder keg with the Goon Squad operating there with the government's help. AIM was there to protect those who were not part of the Goon Squad. There were many murders and assaults in a three-year timeframe. When plain-clothed agents in unmarked cars arrived, a firefight ensued. Leonard did not shoot the agents, and the FBI knew this but withheld evidence. The court of appeals acknowledged this but couldn't overturn the conviction due to legal standards. Judge Heaney, who wrote the opinion, later supported clemency for Leonard. Now, 38 of Judge Heaney's former clerks support parole for Leonard, including three who worked on his case. The government admits they don't know who killed the agents, but it wasn't Leonard. It's time to release Leonard and start the healing process.\"\nAlleged discrepancies in material evidence.\nFBI radio intercepts indicated that the two FBI agents Williams and Coler had entered the Pine Ridge Reservation in pursuit of a suspected thief in a red pickup truck. The FBI confirmed this claim the day after the shootout, but red pickup trucks near the reservation had been stopped for weeks, and Leonard Peltier did not drive a red pickup truck. Evidence was given that Peltier was driving a Chevrolet Suburban; a large sport utility vehicle built on a pickup truck chassis, with an enclosed rear section. Peltier's vehicle was orange with a white roof \u2013 not a red open-bed pickup truck with no white paint.\nAt Peltier's trial, FBI agents changed their previous statements that they had been in search of a red pickup truck and instead said they were looking for an orange and white van, similar to the one Peltier drove. This contradictory statement by the FBI was a highly contentious matter of evidence in the trials.\nThough the FBI's investigation indicated that an AR-15 was used to kill the agents, several different AR-15s were in the area at the time of the shootout. Also, no other cartridge cases or evidence about them was offered by the prosecutor's office, though other bullets were fired at the crime scene. However, the appeals court confirmed his conviction in 1986, noting that even though later evidence suggested there were multiple AR-15s in the area, the government's expert witness had testified during the trial that he could not match 14 shell casings to the AR-15 that killed the agents. The appeals court stated further that the fact was ultimately irrelevant given these shells were ejected in locations such that \"it would have been very difficult, if not impossible, for anyone to have fired at Coler and Williams from these points,\" instead concluding that \"it is more likely that these casings were ejected from an AR-15 in the firefight that occurred after Coler and Williams were killed and other agents had joined in the shooting.\"\nDuring the trial, all the bullets and bullet fragments found at the scene were provided as evidence and detailed by Cortland Cunningham, FBI firearms expert, in testimony (Ref \"US v. Leonard Peltier\", Vol 9). Years later, in 2004, a request under the Freedom of Information Act prompted another examination of the FBI ballistics report used to convict Peltier. An impartial expert evaluated the firing pin linked to the gun that shot Williams and Coler and concluded that some cartridge cases from the scene of the crime did not come from the rifle tied to Peltier. Again, the appeals court rejected the defense's argument, because the information included in the FOIA request \"did not refer to the .223 casing found in the agents\u2019 car, but to other casings found at the scene.\" The court concluded that given the immaterial nature of this new evidence, it was not probable that the jury would have reached a different verdict had that information been available.\n1979 prison escape.\nPeltier began serving his sentences in 1977. On July 20, 1979, he and two other inmates escaped from Federal Correctional Institution, Lompoc. One inmate was shot dead by a guard outside the prison and another was captured 90 minutes later, approximately away. Peltier remained at large until he was captured by a search party three days later near Santa Maria, California, after a farmer alerted authorities that Peltier, armed with a Ruger Mini-14 rifle, had consumed some of his crops and stolen his shoes, wallet, and pickup truck key. Peltier attempted to drive the truck away at high speed down the rough gravel road, resulting in a broken transmission, after which he again fled on foot. Peltier was later apprehended without incident. After a six-week trial held in Los Angeles before Judge Lawrence T. Lydick, Peltier was convicted and sentenced to serve a five-year sentence for escape and a two-year sentence for a felon in possession of a firearm, in addition to his preexisting two life sentences.\nClemency and commutation of sentence.\nSupport for clemency.\nPeltier's conviction sparked great controversy and drew criticism from a number of prominent figures across a wide range of disciplines. In 1999, Peltier asserted on CNN that he did not commit the murders and does not know who did. Peltier has described himself as a political prisoner. Numerous public and legal appeals were filed on his behalf; however, because of the consistent objection of the FBI, none of the resulting rulings were made in his favor. His appeals for clemency received support from world-famous civil rights advocates, including Nelson Mandela, Archbishop Desmond Tutu, Rev. Jesse Jackson, Tenzin Gyatso (the 14th Dalai Lama), Nobel Peace Prize Laureate and activist Rigoberta Mench\u00fa, and Mother Teresa. International and national government entities such as the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner on Human Rights, the United Nations Working Group on Indigenous Populations, the European Parliament, and the Belgian Parliament, have all passed resolutions in favor of Peltier's clemency. Several human rights groups, including the International Federation for Human Rights and Amnesty International launched campaigns advocating for Peltier's clemency. In the United States, the Kennedy Memorial Center for Human Rights, the Committee of Concerned Scientists, Inc., the National Lawyers Guild, and the American Association of Jurists are all supporters of clemency for Peltier.\nThe police officer who arrested Peltier, Bob Newbrook, is convinced that he \"was extradited illegally and that he didn't get a fair trial in the United States\".\nOn June 7, 2022, the United Nations Human Rights Council's Working Group on Arbitrary Detention released a seventeen-page analysis of Peltier's detention, rendering the opinion that it contravenes \"articles 2, 7, and 9 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and articles 2 (1), 9 and 26 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, is arbitrary and falls within categories III and V.\" The Working Group urged a \"full and independent investigation\" surrounding his detention and requested that the US government remedy his situation \"without delay and bring it into conformity with the relevant international norms\".\nClemency denial and commutation.\nIn 1999, Peltier filed a \"habeas corpus\" petition, but it was rejected by the 10th Circuit Court on November 4, 2003. Near the end of the Clinton administration in 2001, rumors began circulating that Bill Clinton was considering granting Peltier clemency. Opponents of Peltier campaigned against his possible clemency; about 500 FBI agents and families protested outside the White House, and FBI director Louis Freeh sent a letter opposing Peltier's clemency to the White House. Clinton did not grant Peltier clemency. In 2002, Peltier filed a civil rights lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia against the FBI, Louis Freeh and FBI agents who had participated in the campaign against his clemency petition, alleging that they \"engaged in a systematic and officially sanctioned campaign of misinformation and disinformation.\" On March 22, 2004, the suit was dismissed. In January 2009, President George W. Bush denied Peltier's clemency petition before leaving office.\nIn 2016, Peltier's attorneys filed a clemency application with the White House's Office of the Pardon Attorney, and his supporters organized a campaign to convince President Barack Obama to commute Peltier's sentence, a campaign which included an appeal by Pope Francis, as well as James H. Reynolds, a senior attorney and former US Attorney who supervised the prosecution against Peltier in the appeal period following his initial trial. In a letter to the United States Department of Justice, Reynolds wrote that clemency was \"in the best interest of justice in considering the totality of all matters involved\". In a subsequent letter to the \"Chicago Tribune\", Reynolds added that the case against Peltier \"was a very thin case that likely would not be upheld by courts today. It is a gross overstatement to label Peltier a 'cold-blooded murderer' on the basis of the minimal proof that survived the appeals in his case.\" On January 18, 2017, two days before President Obama left office, the Office of the Pardon Attorney announced that Obama had denied Peltier's application for clemency. On June 8, 2018, KFGO Radio in Fargo, N.D., reported that Peltier filed a formal clemency request with President Trump. KFGO obtained and published a letter that was sent by Peltier's attorney to the White House. On July 9, 2021, Reynolds wrote a letter to President Biden in which he stated: \u201cI have realized that the prosecution and continued incarceration of Mr. Peltier was and is unjust. We were not able to prove that Mr. Peltier personally committed any offense on the Pine Ridge Reservation.\"\nOn February 6, 2023, Leonard Peltier again made a plea for clemency.\nOn June 10, 2024, Peltier had his first parole hearing since 2009. Ahead of the hearing, his lawyer Kevin Sharp described the hearing as \"probably\" his \"last chance\" to make a case for parole. On July 2, 2024, he was denied parole. An interim hearing to discuss parole was set for 2026, while another full hearing was set for 2039, according to Sharp. From 2014 until 2025, Peltier was housed at Coleman I, the high-security penitentiary wing of the Coleman Federal Correctional Complex in Coleman, Florida.\nPresidential commutation and release from prison.\nOn January 19, 2025, the last full day of his presidency, Joe Biden commuted Peltier's life sentence to home confinement beginning on February 18, 2025. Peltier was released on that date. His son said that the Turtle Mountain Band has a home arranged for him on the reservation in Belcourt, North Dakota. Upon his release, Peltier's younger sister Shelia confirmed to the Minnesota-based newspaper \"Star Tribune\" that he opted to be transferred to the Turtle Mountain Indian Reservation in Belcourt, North Dakota, where he could reunite with his family more. On February 19, 2025, Peltier spoke publicly at Belcourt's Sky Dance Casino and Resort during an event welcoming him home.\nOther concerns and incidents.\n2002 editorial about deaths of agents and Anna Mae Aquash.\nIn January 2002 in the \"News from Indian Country\", publisher Paul DeMain wrote an editorial that an \"unnamed delegation\" told him that Peltier had murdered the FBI agents. DeMain described the delegation as \"grandfathers and grandmothers, AIM activists, pipe carriers and others who have carried a heavy unhealthy burden within them that has taken its toll.\" DeMain said he was also told that the motive for the execution-style murder of high-ranking AIM activist Anna Mae Aquash in December 1975 at Pine Ridge \"allegedly was her knowledge that Leonard Peltier had shot the two agents, as he was convicted.\"\nDeMain did not accuse Peltier of participation in the Aquash murder. In 2003 two Native American men were indicted and later convicted of the murder.\nOn May 1, 2003, Peltier sued DeMain for libel for similar statements about the case published on March 10, 2003, in \"News from Indian Country\". On May 25, 2004, Peltier withdrew the suit after he and DeMain settled the case. DeMain issued a statement saying he did not think Peltier was given a fair trial for the two murder convictions, nor did he think Peltier was connected to Aquash's death. DeMain stated he did not retract his allegations that Peltier was guilty of the murders of the FBI agents and that the motive for Aquash's murder was the fear that she might inform on the activist.\nIndictments and trials for the murder of Aquash.\nIn 2003, there were federal grand jury hearings on charges against Arlo Looking Cloud and John Graham for the kidnapping, rape and murder of Anna Mae Aquash. Bruce Ellison, Leonard Peltier's lawyer since the 1970s, was subpoenaed and invoked his Fifth Amendment rights against self-incrimination, refusing to testify. He also refused to testify, on the same grounds, at Looking Cloud's trial in 2004. During the trial, the federal prosecutor named Ellison as a co-conspirator in the Aquash case. Witnesses said that Ellison participated in interrogating Aquash about being an FBI informant on December 11, 1975, shortly before her murder.\nLeonard Peltier is quoted in We, The People as saying, \"I think it was around that December when I heard that Anna Mae was dead. I was in that jail over there in Canada right around whenever they exposed who she really was and what she died from, but I believe I didn't hear about it until December.\" Peltier had knowledge of Anna Mae Aquash's death in December, months before her body was found and her family was notified of her death. \nIn February 2004, Fritz Arlo Looking Cloud, an Oglala Sioux, was tried and convicted of the murder of Aquash. In Looking Cloud's trial, the prosecution argued that AIM's suspicion of Aquash stemmed from her having heard Peltier admit to the murders of the FBI agents. Darlene \"Kamook\" Nichols, former wife of the AIM leader Dennis Banks, testified that in late 1975, Peltier told of shooting the FBI agents. He was talking to a small group of AIM activists who were fugitives from law enforcement. They included Nichols, her sister Bernie Nichols (later Lafferty), Nichols' husband Dennis Banks, and Aquash, among several others. Nichols testified that Peltier said, \"The motherfucker was begging for his life, but I shot him anyway.\" Bernie Nichols-Lafferty gave the same account of Peltier's statement. At the time, all were fleeing law enforcement after the Pine Ridge shootout.\nEarlier in 1975, AIM member Douglass Durham had been revealed to be an undercover FBI agent and dismissed from the organization. AIM leaders were fearful of infiltration. Other witnesses have testified that, when Aquash was suspected of being an informant, Peltier interrogated her while holding a gun to her head. Peltier and David Hill were said to have Aquash participate in bomb-making so that her fingerprints would be on the bombs. Prosecutors alleged in court documents that the trio planted these bombs at two power plants on the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation on Columbus Day 1975.\nDuring the trial, Nichols acknowledged receiving $42,000 from the FBI in connection with her cooperation on the case. She said it was compensation for travel expenses to collect evidence and moving expenses to be farther from her ex-husband Dennis Banks, whom she feared because she had implicated him as a witness. Peltier has claimed that Kamook Nichols committed perjury with her testimony.\nNo investigation has been opened into the allegedly perjured testimony of Kamook Nichols, later married to a former FBI Chief Agent and living under the name Darlene Ecoffey. During the Looking Cloud trial, the Honorable Lawrence L. Piersol admitted the testimony with the following statement: \"The requested testimony is hearsay, but I am going to admit it for a limited purpose only. This is a limiting instruction. It isn't admitted nor received for the truth of the matter stated. In other words, whether the rumor is true or not. It is simply received as to what the rumor was. So it is limited to what the rumor was, it is not admitted for the truth of the statement as to whether the rumor was true or not.\"\nOn June 26, 2007, the Supreme Court of British Columbia ordered the extradition of John Graham to the United States to stand trial for his alleged role in the murder of Aquash. He was eventually tried by the state of South Dakota in 2010. During Graham's trial, Darlene \"Kamook\" Ecoffey said Peltier told both her and Aquash that he had killed the FBI agents in 1975. Ecoffey testified under oath, \"He (Peltier) held his hand like this\", she said, pointing her index finger like a gun, \"and he said 'that (expletive) was begging for his life but I shot him anyway.'\" Graham was convicted of murdering Aquash and sentenced to life in prison.\nMedia interviews.\nIn the documentary film \"Incident at Oglala\" (1992), AIM activist Robert Robideau said that the FBI agents had been shot by a 'Mr X'. When Peltier was interviewed about 'Mr X', he said he knew who the man was. Dino Butler, in a 1995 interview with E.K. Caldwell of \"News From Indian Country\", contended that 'Mr X' was a creation of Peltier's supporters and had been named as the murderer in an attempt to gain Peltier's release from prison. In a 2001 interview with \"News From Indian Country\", Bernie Lafferty said that she had witnessed Peltier's referring to his murder of one of the agents.\nPresidential politics.\nPeltier was the candidate for the Peace and Freedom Party in the 2004 election for President of the United States. While numerous states have laws that prohibit prison inmates convicted of felonies from voting (Maine and Vermont are exceptions), the United States Constitution has no prohibition against felons being elected to federal offices, including President. The Peace and Freedom Party secured ballot status for Peltier only in California. His presidential candidacy received 27,607 votes, approximately 0.2% of the vote in that state.\nIn 2020, he ran as the vice-presidential running mate of Gloria La Riva on the ticket of the Party for Socialism and Liberation in the presidential campaign. He was forced to resign from the ticket for health reasons in early August 2020, and was replaced with Sunil Freeman.\nRuling on FBI documents.\nIn a February 27, 2006, decision, U.S. District Judge William Skretny ruled that the FBI did not have to release five of 812 documents relating to Peltier and held at their Buffalo field office. He ruled that the particular documents were exempted on the grounds of \"national security and FBI agent/informant protection\". In his opinion, Judge Skretny wrote, \"Plaintiff has not established the existence of bad faith or provided any evidence contradicting (the FBI's) claim that the release of these documents would endanger national security or would impair this country's relationship with a foreign government.\" In response, Michael Kuzma, a member of Peltier's defense team, said, \"We're appealing. It's incredible that it took him 254 days to render a decision.\" Kuzma added, \"The pages we were most intrigued about revolved around a teletype from Buffalo ... a three-page document that seems to indicate that a confidential source was being advised by the FBI not to engage in conduct that would compromise attorney-client privilege.\" Several of Peltier's supporters have taken legal action in an attempt to obtain more than 100,000 pages of documents from FBI field offices, claiming that the files should have been turned over at the time of his trial or following a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request filed soon after.\nVictim of prison violence.\nOn January 13, 2009, Peltier was beaten by inmates at the United States Penitentiary, Canaan, where he had been transferred from USP Lewisburg. He was sent back to Lewisburg, where he remained until the fall of 2011, when he was transferred to a federal penitentiary in Florida. According to \"High Country News\" in 2016: \"Everywhere he's been, inmates have jumped and beaten him, likely with the collusion of guards.\"\nHealth issues.\nIn March 2000, Peltier was confirmed to be suffering from a jaw infection, diabetes and a heart condition and was granted a transfer to the Federal Medical Center in Rochester, Minnesota for a period of time in order to be close to the Mayo Clinic.\nOver the years in prison, Peltier's health has declined and he suffers from various ailments; by 2016 his diabetes had led to impaired vision [and] kidney issues. In April 2024, the International Indian Treaty Council (IITC) joined other groups appealing for his parole, citing his declining health: \"Mr. Peltier is almost 80 years old and has several compounding health conditions, including kidney disease, diabetes, near-total blindness, and an untreated aortic aneurysm. He requires a wheelchair.\" COVID-19 further weakened Peltier, according to his clemency lawyer. Still in prison six months later, and after a recent hospitalization, allies renewed the call for his release, or at least a transfer to a Minnesota prison, where he could be closer to family and friends. They accused the Bureau of Prisons of medical neglect, even \"cruel and unusual punishment\u201d, violating the Eighth Amendment. They said Peltier is not getting a healthy diet or insulin treatment for his diabetes and is unable to use his CPAP machine for sleep apnea treatment due to lack of an electrical outlet in his cell. At the time his sentence was commuted in January 2025, Peltier's sister Betty Ann informed the \"Minnesota Reformer\" that Peltier now also uses a walker.\nSince his release, Peltier has undergone several eye surgeries. In September 2025, Peltier stated that he had \"lost 80% of my vision.\" \nPrison writings: \"My Life Is My Sun Dance\".\nIntroduction and Preface.\nChief Arvol Looking Horse and former Attorney Clark Ramsey Clark contributed the introduction and preface, respectively, to \"My Life is My Sun Dance\". Chief Looking Horse is a spiritual leader and an activist, who notably was involved in recent protest against the Dakota Access Pipeline. Clark has provided legal counsel to Peltier in relation to his appeals for clemency.\nIn his introduction, Chief Looking Horse emphasizes Peltier's suffering and role of a Sun Dancer- \"...(Peltier) offered himself to Wakan Tanka so that the People might have peace and happiness once again\" (pg. ix). Looking Horse also makes a call for the freedom of Peltier, that his freedom mirrors the return of Indigenous land, and that action must be made to ensure these things occur.\nFormer Attorney General Ramsey Clark notes in his preface that Peltier's struggle is representative of human rights and Indigenous rights as a whole, and he is known the whole world over yet seemingly hidden from Americans. He makes a case for Peltier's innocence at Pine Ridge, and mentions the repeating of history that has occurred since Wounded Knee in 1973. Clark praises the efforts of the American Indian Movement taking initiative to protect their people, and berates the FBI and American judicial system on their willful ignorance of Peltier's case of innocence (pg. xxi).\nIn both the preface and introduction, these figureheads\u2014one who champions Indigenous peoples\u2019 rights, and the other who has worked extensively within the American judicial system\u2014both call for the release of Peltier.\nPart i \u2013 In My Own Voice.\nLeonard Peltier starts his memoir by explaining the uncomfortable and unsafe conditions in which he writes his passages. He expresses gratitude, welcoming his reader, unsure if his book will ever reach anyone. Despite his worries, his writing is personal, soaked in a humanizing tone of not only himself but of his reader. Peltier explains his intention behind writing his personal testimony on the 23rd year of his life sentence, proclaiming, \"[I'm writing] not because I'm planning to die, but because I'm planning to live\" (p.\u00a08). He spends much of this part reclaiming his identity, commonly restating his names, both Leonard Peltier and Gwarth-ee-lass, to allow his reader to view him as a person beyond any other label or event that has been used to strip him of his identity. As an Indigenous man to the Great Turtle Island, Peltier writes about his struggle against imprisonment, not as his sole struggle but as a struggle of his people, a struggle he would continue to endure for his people. He does not view himself as powerful until he aligns himself with his people, and only then does he find strength in the struggle he endures. Furthermore, he talks about the wisdom passed down to him from elders, that speaking out from the heart against injustice is the duty of all and is an Indigenous way of living. Peltier gives a detailed account of Sun Dance, a spiritual ceremony in which one sacrifices his flesh and life to the Great Spirit. This spiritual journey, like his Indigenous ancestors, allows him to resist his oppressors rather than abandon his people. As a Sun Dancer, he embodies an unbreakable resistance often misunderstood by settlers. Through the parts that follow, he shows the reader the power behind Sun Dance.\nPart ii \u2013 Who I Am.\nIn part 2 of \"My Life is My Sun Dance\", Peltier discusses what it means to be Indigenous in North America but more specifically the United States. He explains that his story is not specific to him but \"is the story of my people, the Indian people of this Great Turtle Island.\" He discusses some key point in history that outline what he describes as a history saddened in tragedy, deceit, and genocide. He describes how Indigenous peoples' lands have been stolen from them and how they were pushed onto reservations. He describes the events of the Wounded Knee Massacre, South Dakota on December 29, 1890, which was a crucial part in what he describes as the genocide of Indigenous people. He also describes how the genocide is being carried on into modern day by citing statistics such as the fact that some of the highest levels of poverty, unemployment, infant mortality, and teen suicide rates in the country are on the reservations in South Dakota. He highlights the American Indian Movement which has sought to reveal to the world the crimes against humanity that were committed against Indigenous people. Part 2 also contains a poem titled \"an eagle's cry\" which is about wanting to be heard as the lines \"Listen to me!\" and \"hear us\" are uttered many times throughout.\nPart iii \u2013 Growing Up Indian.\nPeltier writes about the importance of names in this section of his memoir. As they relate to Indigenous identity, Peltier notes how names give individuals a sense of who they are and their possibilities. He highlights that names provide individuals with something to live up to and that names can point to where a person is supposed to be in life. Peltier explains the different names he has, such as Tate Wikuw, which translates to \"Wind Chases the Sun\" in the Dakota language, which was his great-grandfather's name, and Gwarth-ee-lass which translates to \"He Leads the People\" (Peltier 61). This section of his memoir also showcases the struggles of Indigenous sovereignty and agency, as Peltier notes that he, along with every other person of the Ikce Wicasa (the Common/Original people), have their land and identities under occupation. He highlights the frequency of racial profiling of Indigenous people like himself and how the prison\u2013industrial complex (PIC) targets and thrives off of them. Peltier illuminates the genocidal projects of the PIC by showcasing the harmful effects of colonization, and the PIC replicating colonization in prisons, these systems have had on Indigenous peoples.\nPart iv \u2013 Becoming Political.\nPeltier writes about his entry into and work for Indigenous movements. Upon seeing Indigenous people being brutalized for trying to maintain and protect their rights, which are guaranteed under federal https:// and not upheld by the U.S. government, he began fighting for civil and Indigenous rights with AIM. He discusses how the U.S. government was primarily interested in taking Indigenous land through means of brutalization, murder, and wrongful incarceration for colonial and extractive reasons. As an AIM member, he participated in the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) takeover in November 1972, which began as a peace march called the \"Trail of Broken Treaties\" that escalated due to BIA and security officials attempting to forcefully remove protestors. He also worked with AIM to help find work for Indigenous people and worked in an alcohol rehab program, as well as spiritual work. In 1975, Peltier arrived at the Oglala nation to help protect the Indigenous people living there who were being murdered. He and other AIM warriors were sent to defend the residents of the land, not as a para-military force. However, they were ambushed and forced to defend themselves with the small supply of defensive arms they had. Peltier reflects on how the government hid information and lied to place blame on him and AIM members as aggressors in the exchange.\nPart v \u2013 That Day at Oglala.\nThis section goes over Peltier's recounting of the day of the attack on his people at Oglala that led to his eventual arrest and imprisonment. Peltier was staying in a \"tent city\" with other AIM members on Harry and Cecilia Jumping Bull's property. The Lakota Elders had asked for their protection from the GOON squads who had been \"terrorizing\" the Pine Ridge Reservation \"for months\" (Peltier 126). On June 26, 1975, their group, which included women, children, and elders, was attacked by \"lawmen, GOONs, SWAT teams, vigilantes, BIA police, you name it\" (129). Peltier's group did not want to immediately retaliate. However, two FBI agents, Jack R. Coler and Ronald A. Williams were killed and the violence against Peltier's group escalated. Despite being convicted for their murders, Peltier denies killing the two FBI agents and says that he would have tried to stop whoever was the true assailant. Peltier and his people managed to escape the attack and all survived, except for Joe Killsright Stuntz. While running away, the group stopped for prayer and Peltier says they were led to safety by an eagle. Peltier thanks those who gave them sanctuary after the attack and those who cheered on and aided their escape. While Peltier's group hid, police went on a large manhunt and terrorized the Pine Ridge Reservation looking for them. Elders in Peltier's group decided they would hide until Sun Dance in August where they could thank Wakan Tanka for saving their lives, but police caught and arrested members of the group one by one until Peltier decided to flee to Canada. He hoped for safety among the Indigenous communities there and possibly being granted political asylum, as he did not trust the American government to give him a fair trial, or even to let him live.\nPart vi \u2013 A Life in Hell.\nPeltier accounts his arrest in Canada on February 6, 1976. Following his arrest, the FBI suborned and coerced Myrtle Poor Bear to provide false affidavits against Peltier, claiming she was an eyewitness to the killing of two FBI agents on the Pine Ridge Reservation in June 1975 and an ex-girlfriend of Peltier's. Despite Peltier's unjust and inhumane treatment since his arrest in Canada, he refuses to be made a victim, emphasizing his status as a warrior who finds his strength in Sun Dance. After being falsely promised a fair trial, Peltier signed the extradition papers to facilitate his return to the United States, where he received two life sentences on June 1, 1977, and was transferred to the U.S. Penitentiary at Leavenworth, Kansas. The FBI elaborately orchestrated Peltier's sentencing through fabricated evidence and \"willful illegality\" as they desperately needed a public \"scapegoat\" to pay for the deaths of two of their agents. Peltier describes the \"unconstitutional\" treatment he has experienced since his imprisonment, including surviving an assassination plot and prison escape during his transfer to Lompoc prison in 1979. Further, Peltier recounts a recurring and changing dream he experienced while in solitary confinement, which he conveys in the form of a story titled \"The Last Battle\". Peltier also describes the \"\"inipi\", or sweat-lodge ceremony\" he participated in every Saturday at Leavenworth, through which he was able to feel a \u201cblessed freedom\u201d and total escape despite his imprisonment.\nPart vii \u2013 A Message to Humanity.\nIn the final section of his memoir, Peltier envisions humanity's mutual future. He discusses the necessity of respect, compassion, and collaboration among all people. He encourages the reader to celebrate humanity's differences and to find strength in togetherness and common humanity. He finds hope in children and anticipates a \"Great Healing\" toward a better future. To realize this vision, Peltier emphasizes the necessity for sincere effort and change in the present. He writes about the importance of individual action and underlines the need for Indigenous sovereignty.\nEndnotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It is the oldest MOO today.\n\"LambdaMOO\" was founded in 1990 by Pavel Curtis at Xerox PARC. Now hosted in the state of Washington, it is operated and administered entirely on a volunteer basis. Guests are allowed, and membership is free to anyone with an e-mail address.\n\"LambdaMOO\" gained some notoriety when Julian Dibbell wrote a book called \"My Tiny Life\" describing his experiences there. Over its history, \"LambdaMOO\" has been highly influential in the examination of virtual-world social issues.\nHistory.\nLambdaMOO has its roots in the 1978\u20131980 work by Roy Trubshaw and Richard Bartle to create and expand the concept of Multi-User Dungeon (MUD) \u2013 virtual communities. Around 1987\u20131988, the expansion of the global Internet allowed more users to experience the MUD. Pavel Curtis at Xerox PARC noted that they were \"almost exclusively for recreational purposes.\" Curtis determined to explore whether the MUD could be non-recreational. He developed \"LambdaMOO\" software to run on the LambdaMOO server, which implements the MOO programming language. This software was subsequently made available to the public. Several starter databases, known as cores, are available for MOOs; \"LambdaMOO\" itself uses the LambdaCore database. The \"Lambda\" name is from Curtis's own username on earlier MUD systems.\nLambdaMOO can refer to the software, the server, or the community of users.\nGeography.\n\"LambdaMOO\" central geography was based on Pavel Curtis's California home. New players and guests traditionally connected in \"The Coat Closet\", but a second area, \"The Linen Closet\" (specially programmed as a silent area) was later added as an alternative connection point. The coat closet opens onto the center of the house in The Living Room, a common hangout and place for conversation; its fixtures include a fireplace (where things can be roasted), The Living Room Couch (which periodically causes players' objects to 'fall through' to underneath the couch), and a pet Cockatoo who repeats overheard phrases (which is sometimes found with its beak gagged). Occasionally, the Cockatoo is replaced with a more seasonal creature: a Turkey near Thanksgiving, a Raven near Halloween, et cetera.\nTo the north of the Living Room is the Entrance Hall, the Front Yard, and a limited residential area along LambdaStreet. There is an extensive subterranean complex located down the manhole, including a sewage system. Players walking to the far west along LambdaStreet may be given the option to 'jump off the edge of the world', which disables access to their account for three months.\nTo the south of the Living Room is a pool deck, a hot tub, and some of the extensive grounds of the mansion, featuring gardens, hot air balloon landing pads, open fields, fishing holes, and the like.\nTo the northwest of the living room are the laundry room, garage, dining room, smoking room, drawing room, housekeeper's quarters, and kitchen.\nTo the east of the entry hall, hallways provide access to some individual rooms, the Linen Closet, and to the eastern wing of the house. In the eastern wing can be found the Library of online books, the Museum of generic objects (which account-holders may create instances of), and an extensive area for the \"LambdaMOO\" RPG.\nSince the creation of the original LambdaMOO map, many users have expanded the MOO by making additional rooms with the command \"@dig.\"\nPolitics.\nWhile most MOOs are run by administrative fiat, in summer of 1993 \"LambdaMOO\" implemented a petition/ballot mechanism, allowing the community to propose and vote on new policies and other administrative actions. A petition may be created by anyone eligible to participate in politics (those who have maintained accounts at the MOO for at least 30 days), can be signed by other players, and may then be submitted for administrative 'vetting'. Once vetted, the petition has a limited time to collect enough signatures to become valid and be made into a ballot. Ballots are subsequently voted on; those with a 66% approval rating are passed and will be implemented. This system suffered quite a lot of evolution and eventually passed into a state where wizards took back the power they'd passed into the hands of the people, but still maintain the ballot system as a way for the community to express its opinions.\nDemographics.\nThe population of \"LambdaMOO\" numbered close to 10,000 around 1994, with over 300 actively connected at any time.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Instead, it was given by scholars in the 16th century. Despite the lack of knowledge on the Roman name for the armor, scholars can make educated guesses on the Roman name. It is obvious the name had the word \"lorica\" in it. However, the following part of the name is unknown. Some scholars believe that the name was \"lorica lamminata\". This theory is based on the Romans referring to sheets of metal as lamina, although no firm evidence for any theory regarding the name of the armor currently exists.\nHistory.\nDespite the armor being commonly associated with the Romans, the technology behind the \"lorica segmentata\" was old by the time it was introduced into the Roman infantry. The Dendra panoply is an example from the 15th century BC of articulated plate defense using a similar technique of overlapping curved plates. Laminated armor was also used by the Parthians and possibly the Dacians, Scythians, or Sarmatians before the Romans adopted it. Some sets of limb armor of this type combined with scale armor dating back to the 4th century BC have been found in archaeological sites located in the steppe. It is possible the Manica (armguard) was worn by gladiators before it was introduced for military use. \nAlthough the exact time at which the Romans adopted the armor remains unknown, it is possible that the \"lorica segmentata\" was introduced after Crassus' defeat at Carrhae in 53 BC. Another possibility is that the armor was adopted in 21 AD after the Revolt of Julius Sacrovir and Julius Florus. Since an archeological research conducted in Kalkriese confirmed that the soldiers at the Battle of the Teutoburg Forest in 9 AD wore the \"lorica segmentata\", it is assumed that this armor must have been in use before 9 AD. \nAround the middle of the third century the \"lorica segmentata\" fell out of favor with the Roman army, although it did remain in use during the Late Roman Empire. Soldiers wearing the \"lorica segmentata\" were depicted on the Arch of Constantine, a monument erected in Rome in 315. However, it has been argued that these depictions are from an earlier monument by Marcus Aurelius, from which Constantine the Great incorporated portions into his Arch. The latest known use of the armor was therefore in the 4th century.\nOver time the type of \"lorica segmentata\" would change. From 9 BC to 43 AD the Roman soldier wore the Dangstetten-Kalkriese-Vindonissa types, from 69 to 100 the Corbridge-Carnuntum type was used. From 164 to 180, the Newstead type was used. The time the armors were used overlapped. It is possible that there was a fourth type, covering the body with segmented armor joined to scale shoulder defenses. However, this is only known from one badly damaged statue originating at Alba Iulia in Romania. This armor was used from about 14 BC to the early 4th century AD. The \"lorica segmentata's\" use in the Roman army was geographically widespread, but the mail armor \"lorica hamata\" may have been more common at all times.\nConstruction.\nThe plates in the \"lorica segmentata\" armor were made by overlapping ferrous plates that were then riveted to straps made from leather. It is unknown what animal was used to make the leather and if it was tanned or tawed. The plates were made of soft iron on the inside and rolled mild steel on the outside. This made the plates hardened against damage without making them brittle. This case-hardening was done by packing organic matter tightly around them and heating them in a forge, transferring carbon from the burnt materials into the surface of the metal. The plates were made from beating out ingots. \nThe strips were arranged horizontally on the body, overlapping downwards, and they surrounded the torso in two halves, being fastened at the front and back. Additional strips, shoulder guards, breastplates, and backplates were used to protect the upper body and the shoulders. The form of the armor allowed it to be stored very compactly, since it was possible to separate it into four sections, each of which would collapse on itself into a compact mass. The fitments that closed the various plate sections together (buckles, lobate hinges, hinged straps, tie-hooks, tie-rings, etc.) were made of brass. In later variants dating from around 75\u201380 C.E., the fastenings of the armor were simplified. \nBronze hinges were removed in favor of simple rivets, belt fastenings used small hooks, and the lowest two girdle plates were replaced by one broad plate. The component parts of the \"lorica segmentata\" moved in synchronization with the other parts. This made the armor more flexible. The armor was very long lasting. The Kalkriese type of armor lasted 55 years, the Corbridge armor lasted 70 years, and the Newstead type lasted 90 years. \nUsage.\nIt is unclear who used this armor. On monuments, \"Auxilia\" are generally shown wearing mail, not cuirasses, and carrying oval shields. Roman depictions of legionaries, such as those found on Trajan's column often depict them wearing the \"lorica segmentata\". On this basis, it has been supposed that \"lorica segmentata\" was exclusively used by legionaries and praetorians. However, some historians consider Trajan's Column to be inaccurate as a historical source due to its inaccurate and stylized portrayal of Roman armor. These historians also say that \"it is probably safest to interpret the Column reliefs as 'impressions', rather than accurate representations.\" \nThe discovery of parts of the \"lorica segmentata\" at areas where auxiliary soldiers would have been stationed implies that auxiliary troops used the \"lorica segmentata\". However, it is entirely possible that the reason behind the presence of the \"lorica segmentata\" in these areas could be that these areas had a small number of legionaries stationed there. On the Adamclisi \"Tropaeum\", the \"lorica segmentata\" does not appear at all, and legionaries and \"auxilia\" alike are depicted wearing the \"lorica squamata\". Some experts are of the opinion that the Adamclisi monument is a more accurate portrayal of the situation.\nIt may have been used rarely, maybe only for set-piece battles and parades. This viewpoint considers the figures in Trajan's Column to be highly stereotyped, in order to distinguish clearly between different types of troops. It is also debated if the lorica segmentata was only used in the west. All archaeological finds of such armor has been made in 16 countries in the western part of the Roman Empire but never in the east.\nCultural impact.\nThe tendency to portray Roman legionaries clad in this type of armour often extends to periods of time that are too early or too late in history.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "18224", "revid": "48264973", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18224", "title": "Known Space", "text": "Fictional universe created by Larry Niven\nKnown Space is the fictional setting of about a dozen science fiction novels and several collections of short stories by American writer Larry Niven. It has also become a shared universe in the spin-off \"Man-Kzin Wars\" anthologies. The Internet Speculative Fiction Database (ISFDB) catalogs all works set in the fictional universe that includes Known Space under the series name Tales of Known Space, which was the title of a 1975 collection of Niven's short stories. The first-published work in the series, which was Niven's first published piece, was \"The Coldest Place\", in the December 1964 issue of \"If\" magazine, edited by Frederik Pohl. This was the first-published work in the 1975 collection.\nThe stories span approximately one thousand years of future history, from the first human explorations of the Solar System to the colonization of dozens of nearby systems. Late in the series, Known Space is an irregularly shaped \"bubble\" about 60 light-years across.\nThe epithet \"Known Space\" refers to a small region in the Milky Way galaxy, one centered on Earth. In the future that the series depicts, spanning roughly the third millennium, humans have explored this region and colonized many of its worlds. Contact has been made with other species, such as the two-headed Pierson's Puppeteers and the aggressive felinoid Kzinti. Stories in the Known Space series include events and places outside of the region called \"Known Space\" such as the Ringworld, the Pierson's Puppeteers' Fleet of Worlds and the Pak homeworld.\nThe Tales were originally conceived as two separate series, the \"Belter\" stories set roughly from 2000 to 2350 CE and the \"Neutron Star\" / \"Ringworld\" stories set in 2651 CE and later. The earlier, \"Belter\" period features solar-system colonization and slower-than-light travel with fusion-powered and Bussard ramjet ships. The later, \"Neutron Star\", period features faster-than-light ships using \"hyperdrive\". Niven implicitly joined the two settings as a single fictional universe in the short story \"A Relic of the Empire\" (\"If\", December 1966), by using background elements of the Slaver civilization from the \"Belter\" series as a plot element in the faster-than-light setting. In the late 1980s\u2014having written almost no Tales of Known Space in more than a decade\u2014Niven opened the 300-year gap in the Known Space timeline as a shared universe, and the stories of the \"Man-Kzin Wars\" volumes fill in that history, bridging the two settings.\nLocations.\nOne aspect of the \"Known Space\" universe is that most of the early human colonies are on planets suboptimal for \"Homo sapiens\". During the first phase of human interstellar colonization (i.e. before humanity acquired FTL), simple robotic probes were sent to nearby stars to assess their planets for habitation. The programming of these probes was flawed: they sent back a \"good for colonization\" message if they found a habitable \"point\", rather than a habitable \"planet\". Sleeper ships containing human colonists were sent to the indicated star systems. Too often, those colonists had to make the best of a bad situation.\nTechnology.\nThe series features a number of \"superscience\" inventions which figure as plot devices. Stories earlier in the timeline feature technology such as Bussard ramjets and drouds (wires capable of directly stimulating the pleasure centers of the brain), and explore how organ transplantation technology enables the new crime of \"organlegging\" (as well as the general sociological effects of widespread transplant technology), while later stories feature hyperdrive, invulnerable starship hulls, stasis fields, molecular monofilaments, transfer booths (teleporters used only on planetary surfaces), the lifespan-extending drug boosterspice, and the tasp which is an extension of the droud which works without direct contact.\nBoosterspice.\n\"Boosterspice\" is a compound that increases the longevity and reverses aging of human beings. With the use of boosterspice, humans can easily live hundreds of years and, theoretically, indefinitely.\nDeveloped by the Institute of Knowledge on Jinx, it is said to be made from genetically engineered ragweed (although early stories have it ingested in the form of edible seeds). In \"Ringworld's Children\", it is suggested boosterspice may actually be adapted from Tree-of-Life, without the symbiotic virus that enabled hominids to metamorphose from Pak Breeder stage to Pak Protector stage (mutated Pak breeders were the ancestors of both \"Homo sapiens\" and the hominids of the Ringworld).\nOn the Ringworld, there is an analogous (and apparently more potent) compound developed from Tree-of-Life, but they are mutually incompatible; in \"The Ringworld Engineers\", Louis Wu learns that the character Halrloprillalar died when in ARM custody after leaving the Ringworld, as a result of having taken boosterspice after having used the Ringworld equivalent. Boosterspice only works on \"Homo sapiens\", whereas the Tree-of-Life compound will work on any hominid descended from the Pak.\nHyperdrive.\nFaster-than-light (FTL) propulsion, or hyperdrive, was obtained from the Outsiders at the end of the First Man\u2013Kzin War. In addition to winning the war for humanity, it allowed the re-integration of all the human colonies, which were previously separated by distance. Standard (Quantum I) hyperdrive covers a distance of one light-year every three days (121.75\u00a0\"c\"). A more advanced Quantum II hyperdrive introduced later is able to cover the same distance in one and a quarter minutes (420,768\u00a0\"c\").\nIn Niven's first novel, \"World of Ptavvs\", the hyperdrive used by the Thrintun required a ship to be going faster than 93% of the speed of light. However, this is the only time that hyperdrive is described this way.\nIn the vast majority of \"Known Space\" material, hyperdrive requires that a ship be outside a star's gravity well to use. Ships which activate hyperdrive close to a star are likely to disappear without a trace. This effect is regarded as a limitation based on the laws of physics. In Niven's novel \"Ringworld's Children\" the Ringworld itself is converted into a gigantic Quantum II hyperdrive and launched into hyperspace while within its star's gravity well. \"Ringworld's Children\" reveals that there is life in hyperspace around gravity wells and that hyperspace predators eat spaceships which appear in hyperspace close to large masses, thus explaining why a structure as large as the Ringworld can safely engage the hyperdrive in a star's gravity well.\nOne phenomenon travelers in hyperspace can experience is the so-called 'blind spot' should they look through a porthole or camera screen, giving the impression that the walls around the porthole or sides of the camera view screen are expanding to 'cover up the outside'. The phenomenon is the result of hyperspace being so fundamentally different from normal/'Einsteinian' space that a traveler's senses cannot truly comprehend it, and instead the observer 'sees' a form of nothingness that can be hypnotic and dangerous. Staring too long into the 'blind spot' can be insanity-inducing, so as a precaution all view ports on ships are blinded when a ship enters hyperspace.\nInvulnerable hulls.\nThe Puppeteer firm, General Products, produces a series of invulnerable starship hulls, known simply as the General Products hull. The hulls are impervious to any type of matter or energy, with the exception of antimatter (which destroys the hull, as demonstrated in \"Flatlander\"), gravitation (demonstrated in \"Neutron Star\"), and visible light (which passes through the hull). While invulnerable themselves, this is no guarantee that the contents are likewise protected. For example, though a high speed impact with the surface of a planet or star may cause no harm to the hull, the occupants will be crushed if they are not protected by additional measures such as a stasis field (\"Ringworld\") or a gravity compensating field.\nIn \"Fleet of Worlds\", the characters tour a General Products factory and receive clues that allow them to destroy a General Products hull from the inside using only a high-powered interstellar communications laser. In \"Juggler of Worlds\", the Puppeteers, attempting to surmise how this was done without antimatter, identify another technique which can be used to destroy the otherwise invulnerable hulls, one which does suggest some potential defense options.\nThe strength of the hulls was revealed to be based on the fact that they were essentially one giant molecule.\nOrgan transplantation.\nOn Earth in the mid-21st century, it became possible to transplant any organ from any person to another, with the exception of brain and central nervous system tissue. Individuals were categorized according to their so-called \"rejection spectrum\" which allowed doctors to counter any immune system responses to the new organs, allowing transplants to \"take\" for life. It also enabled the crime of \"organlegging\" which lasted well into the 24th century.\nStasis fields.\nA Slaver stasis field creates a bubble of spacetime disconnected from the entropy gradient of the rest of the universe. Time slows effectively to a stop for an object in stasis, at a ratio of some billions of years outside to a second inside. An object in stasis is invulnerable to anything occurring outside the field, as well as being preserved indefinitely. A stasis field may be recognized by its perfectly reflecting surface, so perfect that it reflects 100% of all radiation and particles, including neutrinos. However one stasis field cannot exist inside another. This is used in \"World of Ptavvs\" where humans develop a stasis field technology and realize that a mirrored artifact known as the \"Sea Statue\" must be actually an alien in a stasis field. They place it with a human envoy, who is a telepath, and envelop both in field. By doing this, they unleash the last living member of the Slaver species on the world.\nStepping disks.\nStepping disks are a teleportation technology. They were invented by the Pierson's Puppeteers, and their existence is not generally known to other races until the events of \"The Ringworld Engineers\".\nThe stepping disks are an outgrowth and improvement of the transfer booth technology used by humans and other Known Space races. Unlike the booths, the disks do not require an enclosed chamber, and somehow can differentiate between solid masses and air, for example. They also have a far greater range than transfer booths, extending several astronomical units.\nSeveral limitations to stepping disks are mentioned in the \"Ringworld\" novels. If there is a difference in velocity between two disks, any matter transferred between them must be accelerated by the disk accordingly. If there is not enough energy to do so, the transfer cannot take place. This becomes a problem with disks that are a significant distance apart on the Ringworld's surface, as they will have different velocities: same speed, different direction.\nTransfer booths.\nTransfer booths or displacement booths are an inexpensive form of teleportation. Short-range booths are similar in appearance to an old style telephone booth: one enters, \"dials\" one's desired destination, and is immediately deposited in a corresponding booth at the destination. Longer-range booths operate similarly, but are housed in former airports due to requiring \"equipment to compensate for the difference in rotational velocity between different points on the Earth\". They are inexpensive: a trip anywhere on Earth costs only a \"tenth-star\" (presumably equivalent to a dime). Introduced by one of Gregory Pelton's ancestors, apparently bought from, and based on, Puppeteer technology.\n\"A displacement booth was a glass cylinder with a rounded top. The machinery that made the magic work was invisible, buried beneath the booth. Coin slots and a telephone dial were set into the glass at sternum level\" (from \"Flash Crowd\").\nParanormal abilities.\nSome individuals in the stories display limited paranormal or \"psionic\" abilities. Gil Hamilton can move objects with his mind using his phantom arm, which he gained after losing an arm in an asteroid mining accident. When he finally had the arm replaced from an organ bank on Earth, the ability persisted. \"Plateau Eyes\" (introduced in \"A Gift From Earth\") is an ability on the part of some to hide in plain sight, by causing others not to notice them. Population control is tight on Earth, but these abilities can gain the possessor a license to have more children. The Pierson's Puppeteers engineer a lottery for child licenses on Earth to increase the occurrence of \"luck\", which they think is a paranormal ability humans have that has enabled them to defeat races such as the Kzinti. In \"Ringworld\", the character Teela Brown is said to have this ability (although possibly not to the same extent as others who avoided being included in the expedition).\nOrganizations.\nThe ARM is the police force of the United Nations. ARM originated as an acronym for \"Amalgamation of Regional Militia\", though this is not a term in current usage by the time of the \"Known Space\" novels. An agent of the ARM, Gil Hamilton, is the protagonist of Niven's science fictional detective stories, a series-within-a-series gathered in the collection \"Flatlander\". (Confusingly, \"Flatlander\" is also the name of an unrelated \"Known Space\" story.)\nTheir basic function is to enforce mandatory birth control on overcrowded Earth, and restrict research which might lead to dangerous weapons. In short, the ARM hunts down women who have illegal pregnancies and suppresses all new technologies. They also hunt organleggers, especially in the era of the \"organ bank problem\". Among the many technologies they control and outlaw are all trained forms of armed and unarmed combat. By the 25th century, ARM agents were kept in an artificially induced state of paranoid schizophrenia to enhance their usefulness as law enforcement officials, which led to them sometimes being referred to as \"Schizes\". Agents with natural tendencies toward paranoia were medicated into docility during their off duty hours, through the aforementioned science of psychistry (see \"Madness Has Its Place\" and \"Juggler of Worlds\").\nTheir jurisdiction is limited to the Earth-Moon system; other human colonies have their own militia. Nevertheless, in many \"Known Space\" stories, ARM agents operate or exert influence in other human star systems through the \"Bureau of Alien Affairs\" (see \"In the Hall of the Mountain King\", \"Procrustes\", \"The Borderland of Sol\", and \"Neutron Star\"). These interventions begin following the Man-Kzin Wars and the introduction of hyperdrive, presumably as part of a general re-integration of human societies.\nStories in Known Space.\nThe Tales of Known Space were first published primarily as short stories or serials in science fiction magazines. Generally the short fiction was subsequently released in one or more collections and the serial novels as books. Some of the shorter novels (novellas) published in magazines were expanded as, or incorporated in, book-length novels. There are also two or three short stories which share common themes and some background elements with Known Space stories, but which are not considered a part of the Known Space universe: \"One Face\" (1965) and \"Bordered in Black\" (1966)\u2014both in the 1979 collection \"Convergent Series\"\u2014and possibly \"The Color of Sunfire\", published online and listed here.\nIn the Known Space stories, Niven had created a number of technological devices (GP hull, stasis field, Ringworld material) which, combined with the \"Teela Brown gene\", made it very difficult to construct engaging stories beyond a certain date\u2014the combination of factors made it tricky to produce any kind of creditable threat/problem without complex contrivances. Niven demonstrated this, to his own satisfaction, with \"Safe at Any Speed\" (1967). He used the setting for much less short fiction after 1968 and much less for novels after two published in 1980. Late in that decade, Niven invited other authors to participate in a series of shared-universe novels, with the Man\u2013Kzin Wars as their setting. The first volume was published in 1988.\n\"Ringworld\" (1970) won the annual Nebula, Hugo, and Locus best novel awards.\n\"Protector\" (1973) and \"The Ringworld Engineers\" (1980) were nominated for the Hugo and Locus Awards.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nPlayground.\nNiven has described his fiction as \"playground equipment\", encouraging fans to speculate and extrapolate on the events described. Debates have been made, for example, on who built the Ringworld (Pak Protectors and the Outsiders being the traditional favorites, but see \"Ringworld's Children\" for a possibly definitive answer), and what happened to the Tnuctipun. Niven also states that this is not an invitation to violate his copyrights, warning potential publishers and editors not to proceed without permission.\nNiven was also reported to have said that \"Known Space should be seen as a possible future history told by people that may or may not have all their facts right.\"\nThe author also published an \"outline\" for a story which would \"destroy\" the Known Space Series (or more precisely, reveal much of the Known Space background to be an in-universe hoax), in an article entitled http:// . Although the article is written as though Niven intended to write the story, he later wrote that the article was only an elaborate joke, and he never intended to write such a novel. The article itself notes that the outline was made obsolete by the publication of \"Ringworld\". \"Down in Flames\" was a result of a conversation between Norman Spinrad and Niven in 1968, but at the time of its first publication in 1977 some of the concepts were invalidated by Niven's writings between 1968 and 1977. (A further edited version of the outline was published in \"N-Space\" in 1990.)\nReferences.\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He was one of nine children, and seven of his siblings were girls. As a child, he assembled model airplanes, collected aviation memorabilia and read books on aviation. Whenever the family held events where men weren't invited, his father would take him to McArthur Airport where they would watch the planes takeoff and land. He was 15 years old when he started flight instruction in a Cessna 152. Working part-time jobs after school to pay for flying lessons, he completed his first solo trip at the age of 16 and obtained his private pilot's certificate in 1983. Homer graduated from Ss. Cyril and Methodius School in 1979 and St. John the Baptist Diocesan High School in 1983.\nCareer and personal life.\nHe entered the United States Air Force Academy as a member of the class of 1987. As an upperclassman, he was a member of Cadet Squadron 31. He graduated on May 27, 1987, and was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the U.S. Air Force.\nAfter completing his USAF pilot training in 1988, he was assigned to McGuire Air Force Base in New Jersey, flying a Lockheed C-141 Starlifter. While on active duty, he served in the Gulf War and later supported operations in Somalia. He received many commendations, awards and medals during his military career. In 1993, he was named the Twenty-First Air Force \"Aircrew Instructor of the Year\". Homer achieved the rank of captain before his honorable discharge from active duty in 1995 and his acceptance of a reserve commission in order to continue his career as an Air Force officer.\nHomer continued his military career as a member of the U.S. Air Force Reserve, initially as a C-141 instructor pilot with the 356th Airlift Squadron at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in Ohio, then subsequently as an Academy Liaison Officer, recruiting potential candidates for both the Air Force Academy and the Air Force Reserve Officer Training Corps. During his time in the Air Force Reserve, he achieved the rank of major.\nHomer continued his flying career by joining United Airlines in May 1995. He briefly worked as a flight engineer, before becoming a First Officer on the Boeing 757/Boeing 767 in 1996, where he remained until his death.\nHomer married his wife, Melodie, on May 24, 1998, and his daughter, Laurel, was born in late November 2000. They resided together in Marlton, New Jersey.\nSeptember 11 attacks.\nOn September 11, 2001, Homer was flying with Captain Jason M. Dahl on United Airlines Flight 93 from Newark, New Jersey, to San Francisco. The plane was hijacked by four al-Qaeda terrorists, as they carried out the September 11 attacks. Homer and Dahl struggled with the hijackers, which was transmitted to Air Traffic Control.\nAfter learning of the earlier crashes at the World Trade Center and the Pentagon, the crew and passengers attempted to foil the hijacking and reclaim the aircraft. Given the uprising of crew and passengers, and knowing they would not make it to their intended target, which was the US Capitol, the hijackers instead chose to crash the plane into a field near Shanksville, Pennsylvania.\nHomer received many awards and citations posthumously, including honorary membership in the historic Tuskegee Airmen; the Congress of Racial Equality's Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Award; the Southern Christian Leadership Conference Drum Major for Justice Award; and the Westchester County Trailblazer Award.\nHe is survived by his wife, Melodie, and his only child, daughter Laurel. Other family members include his mother, seven sisters, and his brother. His widow Melodie Homer established the LeRoy W. Homer Jr. Foundation, which awards scholarships related to aviation.\nAt the National 9/11 Memorial, Homer Jr. is memorialized at the South Pool, on Panel S-67, along with other crew and passengers on Flight 93.\nOn May 7, 2021, United States Air Force Academy's graduating class of 2024 named Homer Jr as the class Exemplar, an honor that academy's graduating class has bestowed every year since 2000 upon the individual who \"exemplifies\" the type of person the cadets wish to emulate.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Constructed almost entirely from still photos, it tells the stable time loop story of a post-nuclear war experiment in time travel. It is 28 minutes long and shot in black and white.\nIt won the Prix Jean Vigo for short film. The 1995 science fiction film \"12 Monkeys\" was inspired by and borrows several concepts directly from \"La Jet\u00e9e\", as does the 2015 TV series of the same name.\nPlot.\nA man is a prisoner in the aftermath of World War III in post-apocalyptic Paris, where survivors live underground in the \"Palais de Chaillot\" galleries. Scientists research time travel, hoping to send test subjects to different time periods \"to call past and future to the rescue of the present.\" They have difficulty finding subjects who can mentally withstand the shock of time travel. The scientists eventually settle upon the protagonist; his key to the past is a vague but obsessive memory from his pre-war childhood of a woman he had seen on the observation platform (\"the jetty\") at Orly Airport shortly before witnessing a startling incident there. He did not understand exactly what happened, but knew he had seen a man die.\nAfter several attempts, he reaches the pre-war period. He meets the woman from his memory, and they develop a romantic relationship. After his successful passages to the past, the experimenters attempt to send him into the far future. In a brief meeting with the technologically advanced people of the future, he is given a power unit sufficient to regenerate his own destroyed society.\nUpon his return, with his mission accomplished, he discerns that he is to be executed by his jailers. He is contacted by the people of the future, who offer to help him escape to their time permanently; but he asks instead to be returned to the pre-war time of his childhood, hoping to find the woman again. He is returned to the past, placed on the jetty at the airport, and it occurs to him that the child version of himself is probably also there at the same time. He is more concerned with locating the woman, and quickly spots her. However, as he rushes to her, he notices an agent of his jailers who has followed him and realizes the agent is about to kill him. In his final moments, he comes to understand that the incident he witnessed as a child, which has haunted him ever since, was his own death.\nProduction.\n\"La Jet\u00e9e\" is constructed almost entirely from optically printed photographs playing out as a photomontage of varying rhythm. It contains only one brief shot (of the woman mentioned above sleeping and suddenly waking up) originating on a motion-picture camera, this due to the fact that Marker could only afford to hire one for an afternoon. The stills were taken with a Pentax Spotmatic and the motion-picture segment was shot with a 35 mm Arriflex. The film has no dialogue aside from small sections of muttering in German and people talking in an airport terminal. The story is told by a voice-over narrator. The scene in which the hero and the woman look at a cut-away trunk of a tree is a reference to Alfred Hitchcock's 1958 film \"Vertigo\" which Marker also references in his 1983 film \"Sans soleil\".\nThe editing of \"La Jet\u00e9e\" adds to the intensity of the film. With the use of cut-ins and fade-outs, it produces the eerie and unsettling nature adding to the theme of the apocalyptic destruction of World War III. Terry Gilliam, director of \"12 Monkeys\", describes the editing as \"simply poetic\" in the combination of editing and soundtrack that is used in the short film.\nAs the film plays out as a photomontage, the only continuous variable is the sound. The sound used in this production is minimal, showing up in the form of narration, orchestral score and sound effect. The rhythmic patterns of the soundtrack act as a framework to add to the intensity of the film. \"The dissolve is synchronized with the sound. As the story moves from the past to the present, \"La Jetee\" creates mental continuity.\" The soundtrack adds to the illusion of movement within the film and the change of time.\nInterpretation.\nIn \"Black and Blue\", her study of postwar French fiction, Carol Mavor describes \"La Jet\u00e9e\" as \"taking place in a no-place (u-topia) in no-time (u-chronia)\" which she connects to the time and place of the fairy tale. She further elaborates: \"even the sound of the title resonates with the fairy-tale surprise of finding oneself in another world: \"La Jet\u00e9e\" evokes 'l\u00e0 j'\u00e9tais' (there I was)\". By \"u-topia\", Mavor does not refer to \"utopia\" as the word is commonly used; she also describes an ambiguity of dystopia/utopia in the film: \"It is dystopia with the hope of utopia, or is it utopia cut by the threat of dystopia.\"\nTor Books blogger Jake Hinkson summed up his interpretation in the title of an essay about the film, \"There's No Escape Out of Time\". He elaborated:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;What [the protagonist] finds ... is that the past is never as simple as we wish it to be. To return to it is to realize that we never understood it. He also finds\u2014and here it is impossible to miss Marker's message for his viewers\u2014a person cannot escape from their own time, anyway. Try as we might to lose ourselves, we will always be dragged back into the world, into the here and now. Ultimately, there is no escape from the present.\nHinkson also addresses the symbolic use of imagery: \"The Man is blindfolded with some kind of padded device and he sees images. The Man is chosen for this assignment because ... he has maintained a sharp mind because of his attachment to certain images. Thus a film told through the use of still photos becomes about looking at images.\" He further observes that Marker himself did not refer to \"La Jet\u00e9e\" as a film, but as photo novel.\nYannis Karpouzis makes a structuralistic analysis on \"La Jet\u00e9e\", examining it as an intermedial artwork: Chris Marker creates an \"archive\" of objects and conditions that have a photographic quality of their own and they are followed by the same predicates as pictures. The dialogue between the media (photography and cinematography) and the filmic signifier (film stills, storyline and narration) is constantly in the backdrop.\nReception and legacy.\nRelease, awards, and recognition.\nIn 1963, Prix Jean Vigo awarded \"La Jet\u00e9e\" for \"Best Short Film\". That same year, \"La Jet\u00e9e\" was included in the Locarno International Film Festival, the Trieste Science+Fiction Festival, and the Mannheim-Heidelberg International Film Festival. The film has since been included in several contemporary film festivals, including the Buenos Aires Festival Internacional de Cine Independiente in 2009, the \"Cine//B Film Festival\" in 2011, and the International Documentary Film Festival Amsterdam in 2019.\n\"La Jet\u00e9e\" was included by producer Steven Schneider in the 2003 film reference book \"1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die\". In 2010, \"Time\" ranked \"La Jet\u00e9e\" first in its list of \"Top 10 time-travel movies\". In 2012, in correspondence with the \"Sight &amp; Sound\" poll, the British Film Institute deemed \"La Jet\u00e9e\" as the 50th greatest film of all time. In 2022, it took the spot of 67th greatest film on the \"Sight &amp; Sound\" critics' poll, and 35th greatest film on the director's poll, respectively.\nIn popular culture.\nScience fiction writer William Gibson considers the film one of his main influences.\nOn November 8, 2022 the Chicago Fringe Opera staged a world-premiere concert performance of Seth Boustead and J. Robert Lennon's chamber opera adaptation of the film.\nMusic.\nThe video for Sigue Sigue Sputnik's 1989 single \"Dancerama\" is an homage to \"La Jet\u00e9e\". The film is also one of the influences in the video for David Bowie's \"Jump They Say\" (1993).\nThe Chicago-based band Isotope 217 recorded the track \"La Jet\u00e9e\" for their 1997 album \"The Unstable Molecule\". On the 1998 album \"TNT\", the post-rock band Tortoise, of which Isotope 217 is a side-project, featured an alternate version of the same song, titled \"Jetty\". Both are inspired by the film.\nKode9, in collaboration with Ms. Haptic, Marcel Weber (aka MFO), and Lucy Benson created an homage to \"La Jet\u00e9e\" in 2011, for the Unsound Festival.\nNorthern Irish rock band Two Door Cinema Club screened the film at the launch party for their 2016 album \"Gameshow\". The final track on the album, \"Je viens de la\", is inspired by \"La Jet\u00e9e\" and describes the journey of the film's protagonist.\nFilm.\nTerry Gilliam's \"12 Monkeys\" (1995) was inspired by and takes several concepts directly from \"La Jet\u00e9e\" (acknowledging this debt in the opening credits). The 2003 short film \"La pupp\u00e9\" is both an homage to and a parody of \"La Jet\u00e9e\".\nThe 2007 Mexican film \"Year of the Nail\", which is told entirely through still photographs, was inspired by \"La Jet\u00e9e\". The 2018 Spanish film \"Entre Oscuros Sue\u00f1os\", where the still-image movie concept is also used, was entirely inspired by \"La Jet\u00e9e\". \"Friend of the World\", a two-hander film, was inspired by \"La Jet\u00e9e,\" among others.\nGames.\nLeonard Boyarsky, the art director of the initial installment of the \"Fallout\" series, was influenced by the look of the technology in \"La Jet\u00e9e.\"\nRelated media.\nIn 1992, Zone Books released a book which reproduced the film's original images along with the script in both English and French.\nHome media.\nIn Region 2, the film is available with English subtitles in the \"La Jet\u00e9e/Sans soleil\" digipack released by Arte Video. In Region 1, the Criterion Collection has released a \"La Jet\u00e9e/Sans soleil\" combination DVD / Blu-ray, which features the option of hearing the English or French narration.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It is commonly known as the fairy penguin, little blue penguin, or blue penguin, owing to its slate-blue plumage and is also known by its M\u0101ori name . It is a marine neritic species that dives for food throughout the day and returns to burrows on the shore at dusk. \"Eudyptula minor\" feathers are dense in melanosomes, which increase water resistance and give them their unique blue colour.\nThe Australian little penguin (\"Eudyptula novaehollandiae\"), from Australia and the Otago region of New Zealand, was initially described as \"Spheniscus\" \"novaehollandiae\" in 1826 and was later classified as \"Eudyptula\" \"minor\" \"novaehollandiae\", a subspecies of the little penguin.\nTaxonomy.\nThe little penguin was first described by German naturalist Johann Reinhold Forster in 1781. Several subspecies are known, but a precise classification of these is still a matter of dispute. The holotypes of the subspecies \"E. m. variabilis\" and \"Eudyptula minor chathamensis\" are in the collection of the Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa. The white-flippered penguin (\"E. m. albosignata\" or \"E. m. minor morpha albosignata\") is currently considered by most taxonomists to be a colour morph or subspecies of \"Eudyptula minor.\" In 2008, Shirihai treated the little penguin and white-flippered penguin as allospecies. However, as of 2012, the IUCN and BirdLife International consider the white-flippered penguin to be a subspecies or morph of the little penguin.\nLittle penguins from New Zealand and Australia were once considered to be the same species, called \"Eudyptula minor\". Analysis of mtDNA in 2002 revealed two clades in \"Eudyptula\": one containing little penguins of New Zealand's North Island, Cook Strait and Chatham Island, as well as the white-flippered penguin, and a second containing little penguins of Australia and the Otago region of New Zealand. Preliminary analysis of braying calls and cluster analysis of morphometrics partially supported these results. A 2016 study described the Australian little penguin as a new and separate species, \"Eudyptula novaehollandiae\". \"E. minor\" is endemic to New Zealand, while \"E. novaehollandiae\" is found in Australia and Otago. A 2019 study supported the recognition of \"E. minor\" and \"E. novaehollandiae\" as separate species.\nThe IUCN assessment for \"Eudyptula minor\" uses \"Eudyptula minor\" and \"Eudyptula novaehollandiae\" interchangeably throughout the report to specify location, but considers them as two genetically distinct clades within the same species.\nDescription.\nLike those of all penguins, the wings of \"Eudyptula\" species have developed into flippers used for swimming.\n\"Eudyptula\" species typically grow to between tall and on average weigh 1.5\u00a0kg (3.3\u00a0lb). The head and upper parts are blue in colour, with slate-grey ear coverts fading to white underneath, from the chin to the belly. Their flippers are blue in colour. The dark grey-black beak is 3\u20134\u00a0cm long, the irises pale silvery- or bluish-grey or hazel, and the feet pink above with black soles and webbing. An immature individual will have a shorter bill and lighter upperparts.\nLike most seabirds, the \"Eudyptula\" species have a long lifespan. The average for the species is 6.5 years, but flipper ringing experiments show that in very exceptional cases they may live up to 25 years in captivity.\n\"Eudyptula minor\" does not have the distinct bright blue feathers that distinguish \"Eudyptula novaehollandiae.\" In addition, the vocalisation patterns of the New Zealand lineage located on Tiritiri Matangi Island vary from the Australian lineage located in Oamaru. Females are known to prefer the local call of the New Zealand lineage.\nThere are also behavioural differences that help differentiate these penguins. Those of the Australian lineage will swim together in a large group after dusk and walk along the shore to reach their nesting sites. This may be an effective predator avoidance strategy by traveling in a large group simultaneously. This has not been seen by those of the New Zealand lineage. \"Eudyptula\" \"minor\" only recently encountered terrestrial vertebrate predators, while \"Eudyptula novaehollandiae\" would have had to deal with carnivorous marsupials.\nAlso, \"Eudyptula novaehollandiae\" located in Australia will double brood. Birds will double brood by laying another clutch of eggs in hopes to increase their reproductive success. They complete this after the first clutch has successfully fledged. They may also do this due to the increasing sea surface temperatures and changing sources of food that are available. This behaviour has never been observed by those in New Zealand.\nDistribution and habitat.\nThe Australian little penguin is native to Southern Australia. The species also colonized the Otago region of New Zealand after the human-caused decline of the endemic species Eudyptula minor.\nTagged or banded birds later recaptured or found deceased have shown that individual birds can travel great distances during their lifetimes. In 1984, a penguin that had been tagged at Gabo Island in eastern Victoria was found dead at Victor Harbor in South Australia. Another little penguin was found near Adelaide in 1970 after being tagged at Phillip Island in Victoria the previous year. In 1996, a banded penguin was found dead at Middleton. It had been banded in 1991 at Troubridge Island in Gulf St Vincent, South Australia.\nThe Australian little penguin's foraging range is quite limited in terms of distance from shore when compared to seabirds that can fly.\nAustralia.\nThe Australian little penguin occurs across Southern Australia, including New South Wales, Victoria, Tasmania, South Australia, Western Australia, and the Jervis Bay Territory. Colonies primarily exist on offshore islands, where they are protected from feral terrestrial predators and human disturbance. Colonies are found from Port Stephens in northern New South Wales around the southern coast to Fremantle, Western Australia. Foraging penguins have occasionally been seen as far north as Southport, Queensland and Shark Bay, Western Australia.\nNew South Wales.\nAn endangered population of Australian little penguins exists at Manly, in Sydney's North Harbour. The population is protected under the NSW Threatened Species Conservation Act 1995 and has been managed in accordance with a Recovery Plan since the year 2000. The population once numbered in the hundreds but has decreased to around 60 pairs of birds. The decline is believed to be mainly due to loss of suitable habitat, attacks by foxes and dogs and disturbance at nesting sites.\nThe largest colony in New South Wales is on Montague Island. Up to 8,000 breeding pairs are known to nest there each year. Additional colonies exist on the Tollgate Islands in Batemans Bay.\nAdditional colonies exist in the Five Islands Nature Reserve, offshore from Port Kembla, and at Boondelbah Island, Cabbage Tree Island, and the Broughton Islands off Port Stephens.\nJervis Bay Territory.\nA population of about 5,000 breeding pairs exists on Bowen Island. The colony has increased from 500 pairs in 1979 and 1500 pairs in 1985. During this time, the island was privately leased. The island was vacated in 1986.\nSouth Australia.\nIn South Australia, many Australian little penguin colony declines have been identified across the state. In some cases, colonies have declined to extinction (including the Neptune Islands, West Island, Wright Island, Pullen Island, and several colonies on western Kangaroo Island), while others have declined from thousands of animals to few (Granite Island and Kingscote). The only known mainland colony exists at Bunda Cliffs on the state's far west coast, though colonies have existed historically on the Yorke Peninsula. A report released in 2011 presented evidence supporting the listing of the statewide population or the more closely monitored sub-population from Gulf St. Vincent as Vulnerable under South Australia's \"National Parks &amp; Wildlife Act 1972\". As of 2014, the little penguin is not listed as a species of conservation concern, despite ongoing declines at many colonies.\nEncounter Bay and Granite Island.\nThe Granite Island population has undergone a significant decline since the 20th century. In July 1991, National Parks and Wildlife Service South Australia estimated the Encounter Bay area (which includes Granite, West, and Wright Islands) population of little penguins to total 7,000 birds. A general population count conducted in early December 1991 found 571 penguins on Granite Island, and a total of 2600 in the Encounter Bay area. In 1992, Granite Island's population was believed to be stable, estimated to total between 1000 and 1500 little penguins. In 1998, the colony was considered to be \"very healthy\" and was estimated to contain 1800 birds.\nBefore 2000, the estimated number of penguins on Granite Island was alternatively estimated as over 3000 or \"more than 1600\", but numbers have dropped dramatically since then. Rats and foxes have both been threats to the population of little penguins at times, and the millennium drought contributed to a steep decline in numbers after 2001.\nIn 2001, the population count was 1,548 penguins. A count conducted in October 2013 totalled 38 penguins. A fox attack on Granite Island in 2020 reduced the population to 12 penguins. In late 2020, nesting little penguins were discovered on West Island, indicating recolonisation had occurred on that island since 2013, when none were found.\nA December 2022 survey estimated 22 birds on Granite Island, with a different study putting the number at 26 that year. After 28 birds were counted in mid-2023, researchers were hopeful of a recovery in numbers. A count by volunteers in late 2025 revealed the number of birds to be around 36, up from 30 the previous year. There were 18 active burrows.\nTasmania.\nTasmania has Australia's largest Australian little penguin population, with estimates ranging from 110,000 to 190,000 breeding pairs, of which less than 5% are found on mainland Tasmania. Roughly 20,000 pairs occur on Babel Island. Conservation activities, education campaigns, and measures to prevent dog attacks on Australian little penguin rookeries have been implemented.\nVictoria.\nThe largest colony of little penguins in Victoria is located at Phillip Island, where the nightly 'parade' of penguins across Summerland Beach has been a major tourist destination, and more recently a major conservation effort, since the 1920s. Phillip Island is home to an estimated 32,000 breeding adults. Australian little penguins can also be seen in the vicinity of the St Kilda pier and breakwater in the inner suburbs of Melbourne. The breakwater is home to a colony of little penguins which have been the subject of a conservation study since 1986. As of 2020 the colony is 1,400 breeding adults and growing.\nLittle penguin habitats also exist at a number of other locations, including London Bridge and The Twelve Apostles along the Great Ocean Road, Wilsons Promontory, and Gabo Island.\nWestern Australia.\nThe largest colony of Australian little penguins in Western Australia is believed to be located on Penguin Island, where an estimated 1,000 pairs nest during winter. Penguins are also known to nest on Garden Island and Carnac Island which lie north of Penguin Island. Many islands along Western Australia's southern coast are likely to support little penguin colonies, though the status of these populations is largely unknown. An account of little penguins on Bellinger Island published in 1928 numbered them in their thousands. Visiting naturalists in November 1986 estimated the colony at 20 breeding pairs. The account named another substantial colony 12 miles from Bellinger Island and the same distance from Cape Pasley. Little penguins are known to breed on some islands of the Recherche Archipelago, including Woody Island where day-tripping tourists can view the animals. A penguin colony exists on Mistaken Island in King George Sound near Albany. Historical accounts of little penguins on Newdegate Island at the mouth of Deep River and on Breaksea Island in King George Sound also exist. West Australian little penguins have been found to forage as far as 150 miles north of Geraldton (south of Denham and Shark Bay).\nNew Zealand.\nWhile the main range of this penguin is in Australia, at least one population of \"Eudyptula novaehollandiae\" exists in Otago, which is located on the east coast of New Zealand's South Island. The chicks are raised in nests constructed in burrows along the shoreline, both dug by \"Eudyptula minor\" and by other animals. \"Eudyptula minor\" does not occur in Otago, which is located on the east coast of New Zealand's South Island. The Australian species \"Eudyptula novaehollandiae\" occurs in Otago.\nAs \"E. novaehollandiae\" was originally endemic to Australia, the arrival of the Australian species in New Zealand was determined to have occurred roughly between AD 1500 and 1900. When the \"E. minor\" population declined in New Zealand, it left a genetic opening for \"E. novaehollandiae\". The decrease of \"E. minor\" was most likely due to anthropogenic effects, such as being hunted by humans as well as introduced predators, including dogs brought from overseas. It has been determined that the population of \"Eudyptula novaehollandiae\" in Otago arrived even more recently than previously estimated due to multilocus coalescent analyses.\nOutside of the Otago region, all colonies are expected to belong to the subspecies \"Eudyptula minor.\" Many of these colonies are smaller and more patchily distributed than larger \"Eudyptula novaehollandiae\" colonies that exist in Australia and Otago. Extensive research exists on Philip Island and Oamaru colonies as they are sites of large colonies which attract large groups of tourists\nPopulation size and trends of colonies in New Zealand remain poorly documented. What are known as colonies in New Zealand commonly consist of smaller fragmented groups in comparison to Australia's larger colonies, some with &lt;10 breeding pairs. This is largely attributed to NZs fragmented coastline separating the larger colonies. This is commonly seen in Kaik\u014dura where 6\u20137 smaller colonies have been found along 1.7% of coastline\nOutside of Australasia.\nSightings of \"Eudyptula\" have been reported from Chile, where they are known as \"ping\u00fcino enano\", \"ping\u00fcino peque\u00f1o\", or \"ping\u00fcino hada.\" These include on Isla Cha\u00f1aral in 1995; at the Playa de Santo Domingo, San Antonio, 16 March 1997; 2005 in Chilean Antarctica; 2009 Isla Magdalena in the Magellan Straits; and in 2015 at Caleta Abarca beach in Vina del Mar.\nIn April 2005 the first recorded sighting of a living little penguin occurred on Ichaboe Island in Namibia.\nBehaviour.\nFeeding.\nLittle penguins feed by hunting small clupeoid fish, cephalopods, and crustaceans, for which they travel and dive quite extensively including to the sea floor. Researcher Tom Montague studied a Victorian population for two years in order to understand its feeding patterns. Montague's analysis revealed a penguin diet consisting of 76% fish and 24% squid. Nineteen fish species were recorded, with pilchard and anchovy dominating. The fish were usually less than 10\u00a0cm long and often post-larval or juvenile. Less common little penguin prey include: crab larvae, eels, jellyfish, and seahorses. In New Zealand, important little penguin prey items include arrow squid, slender sprat, Graham's gudgeon, red cod, and ahuru.\nLittle penguins are generally inshore feeders. The use of data loggers has shown that in the diving behaviour of little penguins, 50% of dives go no deeper than 2\u00a0m, and the mean diving time is 21 seconds. In the 1980s, average little penguin dive time was estimated to be 23\u201324 seconds. The maximum recorded depth and time submerged are 66.7\u00a0metres and 90 seconds respectively. Tracking technology is allowing researchers from IMAS and the University of Tasmania to garner new insights into the foraging behavior of little penguins.\nLittle penguins are central place foragers, meaning they will travel distances to forage but always return to the same nest or colony. They are also a species where both parents are required to raise chicks, and alternate foraging trips while the other is guarding and incubating the nest during the post guard stage. These stints can last anywhere between 1\u201310 days during incubation. Despite nesting on the shore, little penguins forage at sea and feed on a diet ranging from small schooling fish, to cephalopods, krill, and microzooplankton. As the species is widely distributed across a range of habitats in New Zealand and Australia, variation in diet and foraging choice has also arisen. Important little penguin prey items include arrow squid, slender sprat, Graham's gudgeon, red cod, and ahuru.\nSince the year 2000, the diet of the Australian little penguins of Port Phillip has consisted mainly of Australian anchovies (the primary food source), barracouta, anchovy, and Gould's squid. Pilchards previously featured more prominently in southern Australian little penguin diets prior to mass sardine mortality events of the 1990s. These mass mortality events affected sardine stocks over 5,000 kilometres of coastline. Jellyfish including species in the genera \"Chrysaora\" and \"Cyanea\" were found to be actively sought-out food items, while they previously had been thought to be only accidentally ingested. Similar preferences were found in the Ad\u00e9lie penguin, yellow-eyed penguin, and Magellanic penguin. An important crustacean present in the little penguin diet is the krill, \"Nyctiphanes australis\", which surface-swarms during the day.\nAlthough the diet of the Philip Island colony has diversified to include selections of cephalopods and krill during the post guard stage of their life cycle (where greater amounts of energy is required for chick development and egg production), resident penguins predominantly rely on anchovies when more energy is required.\nThe nature of their diet also impacts foraging methods, which may vary by colony depending on what food is available. When prey is larger and individuals are only catching 1-2 items at a time, they are more likely to hunt alone to reduce competition, whereas smaller and more mobile prey, or schooling prey species, promote group hunting to enable efficient encirclement. The Oamaru colony predominantly feeds on smaller schooling species such as sprat and gudgeon, while penguins from the Stewart/Codfish Island colonies more often hunt alone. The latter is likely linked to a predominantly cephalopods diet (58% of prey items at &lt; 10 gm each).\nForaging behaviour.\nLike many penguin species, Australian little penguins spend the largest part of their day swimming and foraging at sea. The species may also forage at night but never visits burrows during the day, making it the only penguin whose presence on land is strictly nocturnal. During the breeding and chick-rearing seasons, they travel within their home range to find food, but will return to their nest to feed both themselves and their chicks and return to their nests just after dusk. Thus, sunlight, moonlight, and artificial lights can affect the behaviour of attendance to the colony. Their foraging range is limited by how long chicks can fast, and the high energetic of costs of constant travelling for individuals.\nThis behaviour results in a small foraging range, and therefore a higher probability of competition when prey availability is more scarce. In order to survive, \"Eudyptula minor\" adapt to these constraints by increasing the plasticity and variability in their foraging behaviour, such as spatial, age, or diet based segregation, during breeding season when energy demands for both parents and chicks are at their highest. During chick rearing, parents will make on average one day long foraging trips within a 30\u00a0km radius of their nest.\nResearch conducted on the Philip Island colony found the spatial segregation of foraging behaviour was primarily determined by age rather than biological sex. Middle aged individuals foraged at greater distances from their nests and were able to dive greater distances, whereas older penguins were found to forage closer to the shore than middle aged adults. However, increased wind speeds negatively affect the little penguins' efficiency in foraging for chicks, for reasons not yet understood. Australian little penguins preen their feathers to keep them waterproof. They do this by rubbing a tiny drop of oil onto every feather from a special gland above the tail.\nWhen foraging in groups for small schooling prey, they were also observed to all be of a similar age cohort. If the groups are segregated by age, this is likely because they are at the same foraging ability and occupy the same approximate range.\nPrey availability.\nFood availability appears to strongly influence the survival and breeding success of little penguin populations across their range. Rising ocean temperatures have seen a trend towards earlier onset of breeding in\" Eudyptula minor\" which does not always align with the availability of their prey. This is because higher sea surface temperatures are associated with early onset of nesting, but also associated with lower nutrients and oxygen availability.\nDuring the breeding season, parents are restricted to a short foraging area close to their nest and are therefore vulnerable to small regional changes. La Ni\u00f1a events increasing the sea surface temperature along the New Zealand coastline cause prey such as schooling fish and krill to either become more regionally scarce or migrate to new habitats.\nVariation in prey abundance and distribution from year to year causes young birds to be washed up dead from starvation or in weak condition. This problem is not constrained to young birds, and has been observed throughout the 20th century. The breeding season of 1984\u20131985 in Australia was particularly bad, with minimal breeding success. Eggs were deserted prior to hatching and many chicks starved to death. Malnourished penguin carcasses were found washed up on beaches and the trend continued the following year. In April 1986, approximately 850 dead penguins were found washed ashore in south-western Victoria. The phenomenon was ascribed to lack of available food.\nThere are two seasonal peaks in the discovery of dead little penguins in Victoria. The first follows moult and the second occurs in mid-winter. Moulting penguins are under stress, and some return to the water in a weak condition afterwards. Mid-winter marks the season of lowest prey availability, thus increasing the probability of malnutrition and starvation.\nIn the late 1980s, it was believed that penguins did not compete with the fishing industry, despite anchovy being commercially caught. That assertion was made prior to the establishment and development of South Australia's commercial pilchard fishery in the 1990s. In South Africa, the overfishing of species of preferred penguin prey has caused African penguin populations to decline. Overfishing is a potential (but not proven) threat to the Australian little penguin.\nIn 1990, 24 dead penguins were found in the Encounter Bay area in South Australia during a week spanning late April to early May. A State government park ranger explained that many of the birds were juvenile and had starved after moulting. In 1995 pilchard mass mortality events occurred, which reduced the penguins' available prey and resulted in starvation and breeding failure. Another similar event occurred in 1999. Both mortality events were attributed to an exotic pathogen which spread across the entire Australian population of the fish, reducing the breeding biomass by 70%. Crested tern and gannet populations also suffered following these events. In 1995, 30 dead penguins were found ashore between Waitpinga and Chiton Rocks in the Encounter Bay area. The birds had suffered severe bacterial infections and the mortalities may have been linked to the mass mortality of pilchards that resulted from the spread of an exotic pathogen that year. However, the penguins were able to successfully adapt their diet to consist of slender sprat and pigfish.\nReproduction.\nAustralian little penguins reach sexual maturity at different ages. The female matures at two years old and the male at three years old.\nBetween June and August, males return to shore to renovate or dig new burrows and display to attract a mate for the season. Males compete for partners with their displays. Breeding occurs annually, but the timing and duration of the breeding season varies from location to location and from year to year. Breeding occurs during spring and summer when oceans are most productive and food is plentiful.\nAustralian little penguins remain faithful to their partner during a breeding season and whilst hatching eggs. At other times of the year, they tend to swap burrows. They exhibit site fidelity to their nesting colonies and nesting sites over successive years. Little penguins can breed as isolated pairs, in colonies, or semi-colonially.\nNesting.\nPenguins' nests vary depending on the available habitat. They are established close to the sea in sandy burrows excavated by the birds' feet or dug previously by other animals. Nests may also be made in caves, rock crevices, under logs, or in or under a variety of man-made structures including nest boxes, pipes, stacks of wood or timber, and buildings. Nests have been occasionally observed to be shared with prions, while some burrows are occupied by short-tailed shearwaters and little penguins in alternating seasons. In the 1980s, little was known on the subject of competition for burrows between bird species.\nTiming.\nThe timing of breeding seasons varies across the species' range. In the 1980s, the first egg laid at a penguin colony on Australia's eastern volcanos as early May or as late as October. Eastern Australian populations (including at Phillip Island, Victoria) lay their eggs from July to December. In South Australia's Gulf St. Vincent, eggs are laid between April and October and south of Perth in Western Australia, peak egg-laying occurred in June and continued until mid-October (based on observations from the 1980s).\nMale and female birds share incubating and chick-rearing duties. They are the only species of penguin capable of producing more than one clutch of eggs per breeding season, but few populations do so. In ideal conditions, a penguin pair is capable of raising two or even three clutches of eggs over an extended season, which can last between eight and twenty-eight weeks.\nThe one or two (on rare occasions, three) white or lightly mottled brown eggs are laid between one and four days apart. Each egg typically weighs around 55 grams at time of laying. Incubation takes up to 36 days. Chicks are brooded for 18\u201338 days and fledge after 7\u20138 weeks. On Australia's east coast, chicks are raised from August to March. In Gulf St. Vincent, chicks are raised from June through November.\nAustralian little penguins typically return to their colonies to feed their chicks at dusk. The birds tend to come ashore in small groups to provide some defence against predators, which might otherwise pick off individuals. In Australia, the strongest colonies are usually on cat-free and fox-free islands. However, the population on Granite Island (which is a fox, cat, and dog-free island) has been severely depleted, from around 2000 penguins in 2001 down to 22 in 2015. Granite Island is connected to the mainland via a timber causeway.\nDouble brooding.\nIf penguins produce a second clutch of eggs in a season once the first chicks have fledged, this is known as double brooding. Thus far this behaviour has only been observed in the \"Eudyptula novaehollandiae\", the lineage of little blue penguins which inhabit Australian and Otago regions. There is no evidence to suggest this is an established behaviour within \"Eudyptula minor\", however double broods are occasionally noticed among the colonies in the Kaik\u014dura coastline. It is as yet unclear whether this means double brooding is a genetically mediated behaviour. A study carried out on Oamaru penguin colony found double broods to increase breeding success by up to 75% per season. Double brooding is more likely to occur in individuals who lay their first clutch, prior to mid-September. While there is some interannual variability, the most common period for little penguins to lay their first clutch is in spring, mid-September is considered early and gives individuals time left in the season to lay a second clutch of eggs after the first have fledged.\nThe onset of double brooding can be strongly influenced by sea surface temperature, age and food availability. Warmer sea surface temperature in summer and autumn correlated with earlier laying of first clutch of eggs increasing the chances of double brooding. In contrast, in New Zealand it was observed that during the La Ni\u00f1a phase of the El Ni\u00f1o Southern Oscillation when colder temperature water was brought to the surface, there was a delay in the onset of breeding for \"Eudyptula novaehollandiae\", thus resulting in a lower incidence of double brooding in the Otago colonies. Age is also believed to be a factor affecting double brooding because the pairs successfully able to double brood were most commonly strategic in reclaiming successful nests and pair-bonds. Little penguins show a high nest fidelity, and the ability to reclaim success early suggests it is likely that successful double brooding is a behaviour that improves with age. Another influencing factor is the availability of food, for larger colonies such as the Philip Islands, competition for food can increase significantly during the breeding season, particularly if there is variability in the amount of prey available. If this competition results in aggression between adults, this can also influence ability to successfully raise chicks, and successfully breed in the next season.\nNative predators.\nPredation by native animals is not considered a threat to little penguin populations, as these predators' diets are diverse. In Australia, large native reptiles including the tiger snake and Rosenberg's monitor are known to take little penguin chicks and common blue-tongued skinks are known to take eggs. At sea, Australian little penguins are eaten by long-nosed fur seals. A study conducted by researchers from the South Australian Research and Development Institute found that roughly 40 percent of seal droppings in South Australia's Granite Island area contained little penguin remains. Other marine predators include Australian sea lions, sharks, and barracouta.\nThe introduction of Tasmanian devils to Maria Island in 2012 led to the complete destruction of a population of Australian little penguins that numbered 3,000 breeding pairs before the introduction.\nAustralian little penguins are also preyed upon by white-bellied sea eagles. These large birds-of-prey are endangered in South Australia and not considered a threat to colony viability there. Other avian predators include: kelp gulls, pacific gulls, brown skuas, and currawongs.\nIn Victoria, at least one penguin death has been attributed to a water rat.\nParasites.\nAustralian little penguins play an important role in the ecosystem as not only a predator to parasites but also a host. Recent studies have shown a new species of feather mite that feeds on the preening oil on the feathers of the penguin. Australian little penguins preen their mates to strengthen social bonds and remove parasites, especially from their partner's head where self-preening is difficult.\nRelationship with humans.\nAustralian little penguins have long been a curiosity to humans Captive animals are often exhibited in zoos. Over time attitudes towards penguins have evolved from direct exploitation (for meat, skins, and eggs) to the development of tourism ventures, conservation management and the protection of both birds and their habitat.\nDirect exploitation.\nDuring the 19th and 20th centuries, Australian little penguins were shot for sport, killed for their skins, captured for amusement and eaten by ship-wrecked sailors and castaways to avoid starvation. Their eggs were also collected for human consumption by indigenous and non-indigenous people. In 1831, N. W. J. Robinson noted that penguins were typically soaked in water for many days to tenderise the meat before eating.\nOne of the colonies raided for penguin skins was Lady Julia Percy Island in Victoria. The following directions for preparing penguin skin were published in \"The Chronicle\" in 1904:'F.W.M.,' Port Lincoln. \u2014 To clean penguin skins, scrape off as much fat as you can with a blunt knife. Then peg the skin out carefully, stretching it well. Let it remain in the sun till most of the fat is dried out of it, then rub with a compound of powdered alum, salt, and pepper in about equal proportions. Continue to rub this on at intervals until the skin becomes soft and pliable.An Australian taxidermist was once commissioned to make a woman's hat for a cocktail party from the remains of a dead little penguin. The newspaper described it as \"a smart little toque of white and black feathers, with black flippers set at a jaunty angle on the crown.\"\nIn the 20th century, little penguins were maliciously attacked by humans, used as bait to catch southern rock lobster, used to free snagged fishing tackle, killed as incidental bycatch by fishermen using nets, and killed by vehicle strikes on roads and on the water. However, towards the end of the 20th century and the beginning of the 21st, more mutually beneficial relationships between penguins and humans developed. The sites of some breeding colonies have become carefully managed tourist destinations which provide an economic boost for coastal and island communities in Australia and New Zealand. These locations also often provide facilities and volunteer staff to support population surveys, habitat improvement works and little penguin research programs.\nTourism.\nAt Phillip Island, Victoria, a viewing area has been established at the Phillip Island Nature Park to allow visitors to view the nightly \"penguin parade\". Lights and concrete stands have been erected to allow visitors to see but not photograph or film the birds (this is because it can blind or scare them) interacting in their colony. In 1987, more international visitors viewed the penguins coming ashore at Phillip Island than visited Uluru. In the financial year 1985\u201386, 350,000 people saw the event, and at that time audience numbers were growing 12% annually.\nIn Bicheno, Tasmania, evening penguin viewing tours are offered by a local tour operator at a rookery on private land. A similar sunset tour is offered at Low Head, near the mouth of the Tamar River on Tasmania's north coast. Observation platforms exist near some of Tasmania's other little penguin colonies, including Stanley, Bruny Island and Lillico Beach near Devonport.\nSouth of Perth, Western Australia, visitors to Penguin Island are able to view penguin feeding within a penguin rehabilitation centre and may also encounter wild penguins ashore in their natural habitat. The island is accessible via a short passenger ferry ride, and visitors depart the island before dusk to protect the colony from disturbance.\nVisitors to Kangaroo Island, South Australia, have nightly opportunities to observe penguins at the Kangaroo Island Marine Centre in Kingscote and at the Penneshaw Penguin Centre. Granite Island at Victor Harbor, South Australia continues to offer guided tours at dusk, despite its colony dropping from thousands in the 1990s to dozens in 2014. There is also a Penguin Centre located on the island where the penguins can be viewed in captivity.\nIn the Otago, New Zealand town of Oamaru, visitors view the birds returning to their colony at dusk. In Oamaru it is common for penguins to nest within the cellars and foundations of local shorefront properties, especially in the old historic precinct of the town. Little penguin viewing facilities have been established at Pilots Beach on the Otago Peninsula in Dunedin. Here visitors are guided by volunteer wardens to watch penguins returning to their burrows at dusk.\nMascots and logos.\nLinus Torvalds, the original creator of Linux (a popular operating system kernel), was once pecked by an Australian little penguin while on holiday in Australia. Reportedly, this encounter encouraged Torvalds to select Tux as the official Linux mascot.\nA Linux kernel programming challenge called the Eudyptula Challenge has attracted thousands of persons; its creator(s) use the name \"Little Penguin\".\nPenny the Little Penguin was the mascot for the 2007 FINA World Swimming Championships held in Melbourne, Victoria.\nThreats.\nIntroduced predators.\nIntroduced mammalian predators present the greatest terrestrial risk to little penguins and include cats, dogs, rats, foxes, ferrets, and stoats. Significant dog attacks have been recorded at the colony at Little Kaiteriteri Beach, and a suspected stoat or ferret attack at Doctor's Point near Dunedin, New Zealand, claimed the lives of 29 little blue penguins in November 2014.\nDogs and cats.\nUncontrolled dogs or feral cats can have sudden and severe impacts on penguin colonies (more than the penguin's natural predators) and may kill many individuals. Examples of colonies affected by dog attacks include Manly, New South Wales, Penneshaw, South Australia, Red Chapel Beach, Wynyard, Camdale and Low Head in Tasmania, Penguin Island in Western Australia, and Little Kaiteriteri Beach in New Zealand. Paw prints at an attack site at Freeman's Knob, Encounter Bay, South Australia showed that the dog responsible was small, roughly the size of a terrier. The single attack may have rendered the small colony extinct. Cats have been recorded preying on penguin chicks at Emu Bay on Kangaroo Island in South Australia. In October 2011, 15 dead penguin chicks were found near the Kingscote colony with their heads removed. A dog or cat attack was presumed to be the cause of death. A similar event also occurred in 2010.\nThe threat of dog and cat attack is ongoing at many colonies and reports of dog attacks on penguins date back to the mid 20th century. In the first seven months of 2014, South Australian animal rescue organisation AMWRRO received and treated 22 penguins that had been injured during dog attacks.\nFoxes.\nFoxes have been known to prey on little penguins since at least the early 20th century. A fox was believed responsible for the deaths of 53 little penguins over several nights on Granite Island in 1994. Little penguins on Middle Island off Warrnambool, Victoria have suffered heavy predation by foxes, which were able to reach the island at low tide by a tidal sand bridge. The small colony was reduced from approximately 600 penguins in 2001 to less than 10 in 2005. The use of Maremma sheepdogs to guard the colony has helped it recover to 100 birds by 2017. In June 2015, 26 penguins from the Manly colony were killed in 11 days. A fox believed responsible was eventually shot in the area and an autopsy was expected to prove or disprove its involvement. In November 2015 a fox entered the little penguin enclosure at the Melbourne Zoo and killed 14 penguins, prompting measures to further \"fox proof\" the enclosure.\nOther animals.\nA suspected stoat or ferret attack at Doctor's Point near Dunedin, New Zealand claimed the lives of 29 little blue penguins in November 2014. A population of Tasmanian devils introduced to Maria Island in 2012 for conservation reasons led to the loss of the local little penguin colony.\nOil spills.\nOil spills can be lethal for penguins and other sea birds and events related ports and shipping have impacted penguins across the Southern Hemisphere since the 1920s. Oil is toxic when ingested and penguins' buoyancy and the insulative quality of their plumage is damaged by contact with oil. Little penguin populations have been significantly affected during two major oil spills at sea: the \"Iron Baron\" oil spill off Tasmania's north coast in 1995 and the grounding of the \"Rena\" off New Zealand in 2011. In 2005, a 10-year post-mortem reflection on the \"Iron Baron\" incident estimated penguin fatalities at 25,000. The \"Rena\" incident killed 2,000 seabirds (including little penguins) directly, and killed an estimated 20,000 in total based on wider ecosystem impacts.\nVictoria's coastline has been subjected to chronic oil contamination from minor discharges or spills which have impacted little penguins at several colonies. An oil spill or dumping event claimed the lives of up to 120 little penguins which were found oiled, deceased and ashore near Warrnambool in 1990. A further 104 penguins were taken into care for cleaning. The waters west of Cape Otway were polluted with bunker oil. The source was unknown at the time and an investigation was started into three potentially responsible vessels.\nEarlier oil spill or oil dumping events have injured or killed little penguins at various locations in the 1920s, 1930s, 1940s, 1950s, 1960s and 1970s. The threat persists in the 21st century, with oiled birds received for treatment at specialised facilities like AMWRRO in South Australia. Oil spills are the most common cause of the little penguins being admitted to the rehabilitation facilities at Phillip Island Nature Park (PINP). These oil spill recurrences have endangered not just the little penguins, but the entire penguin population. This can further decline the population, which can lead to possible extinction.\nFire.\nIncreased frequency of drought and extreme temperatures in Southern Australia has led to an increased fire risk. Being flightless birds that nest on land, little blue penguins are especially vulnerable to fire. Behavioural traits such as reluctancy to abandon nests and emerging mostly during daylit hours is thought to be some of the main reasons for increased vulnerability in the future. The threats it provides include nest and habitat distruption, as well as deadly to eggs and individuals, despite this \"Eudyptula minor\" appears to show no fear towards fire when directly exposed. When observed, they have been to found to remain around or under vegetation until severely burnt or injured. Some have even been observed preening their feathers near to open flames.\nFires can also significantly alter the composition of vegetation in Eudyptula minor habitats. A large fire in Marion Bay, South Australia in 1994 saw the loss of two key plant species; introduced marram grass \"Ammophila\" and coastal wattle \"A.sophorae\". Following the fire, these grasses were replaced by invasive palms \"A.arenia\" and \"A.sophorae\"grew back in dense thickets. This habitat became no longer suitable for \"Eudyptula minor\" and colony relocated.\nHuman development.\nThe impacts of human habitation in proximity to little penguin colonies include collisions with vehicles, direct harassment, burning and clearing of vegetation and housing development. In 1950, roughly a hundred little penguins were allegedly burned to death near The Nobbies at Port Phillip Bay during a grass fire lit intentionally by a grazier for land management purposes. It was later reported that the figure had been overstated. The matter was resolved when the grazier offered to return land to the custody of the State for the future protection of the colony.\nA study in Perth from 2003 to 2012 found that the main cause of mortality was trauma, most likely from watercraft, leading to a recommendation for management strategies to avoid watercraft strikes. The Conservation Council of Western Australia has expressed opposition to the proposed development of a marina and canals at Mangles Bay, in close proximity to penguin colonies at Penguin Island and Garden Island. Researcher Belinda Cannell of Murdoch University found that over a quarter of penguins found dead in the area had been killed by boats. Carcasses had been found with heads, flippers or feet cut off, cuts on their backs and ruptured organs. The development would increase boat traffic and result in more penguin deaths.\nHuman interference.\nPenguins are vulnerable to interference by humans, especially while they are ashore during moult or nesting periods.\nIn 1930 in Tasmania, it was believed that little penguins were competing with short-tailed shearwaters, which were being commercially exploited. An \"open season\" in which penguins would be permitted to be killed was planned in response to requests from members of the mutton-birding industry. In the 1930s, an arsonist was believed to have started a fire on Rabbit Island near Albany, Western Australia- a known little penguin rookery. Visitors later reported finding dead penguins there with their feet burned off. In 1938 an account was given of a little penguin found with its flippers tied together with fishing line.\nIn 1949, penguins on Phillip Island in Victoria became victims of human cruelty, with some kicked and others thrown off a cliff and shot at. These acts of cruelty prompted the state government to fence off the rookeries. In 1973, ten dead penguins and fifteen young seagulls were found dead on Wright Island in Encounter Bay, South Australia. It was believed that they were killed by people poking sticks down burrows before scattering the dead bodies around, though a dog attack is also possible. In 1983 one penguin was found dead and another injured at Encounter Bay, both by human interference. The injured bird was euthanased.\nMore recent examples of destructive interference can be found at Granite Island, where in 1994 a penguin chick was taken from a burrow and abandoned on the mainland, a burrow containing penguin chicks was trampled and litter was discarded down active burrows. In 1998, two incidents in six months resulted in penguin deaths. The latter, which occurred in May, saw 13 penguins apparently kicked to death. In March 2016, two little penguins were kicked and attacked by humans during separate incidents at the St Kilda colony, Victoria.\nIn 2018, a dozen little penguin carcasses were found in a garbage bin at Low Head, Tasmania prompting an investigation into the causes of death. Also in 2018, 20-year-old Tasmanian man Joshua Leigh Jeffrey was fined $82.50 in court costs and sentenced to 49 hours of community service at Burnie Magistrates Court after killing nine little penguins at Sulphur Creek in North West Tasmania on 1 January 2016 by beating them with a stick. Dr Eric Woehler from conservation group Birds Tasmania denounced the perceived leniency of the sentence, which he said placed minimal value on Tasmania's wildlife and set an \"unwelcome precedent\". Following an appeal by prosecutors, Jeffrey had his sentence doubled on 15 October 2018. The office of the Director of Public Prosecutions said it considered the original sentence to be manifestly inadequate. The original sentence was set aside, and Jeffrey was sentenced to two months in prison, suspended on the condition of him committing no offences for a year that are punishable by imprisonment. His community order was also doubled to 98 hours.\nInteractions with fishing.\nSome little penguins are drowned when amateur fishermen set gill nets near penguin colonies. Discarded fishing line can also present an entanglement risk and contact can result in physical injury, reduced mobility or drowning. In 2014, a group of 25 dead little penguins was found on Altona Beach in Victoria. Necropsies concluded that the animals had died after becoming entangled in net fishing equipment, prompting community calls for a ban on net fishing in Port Phillip Bay.\nIn the 20th century, little penguins were intentionally shot or caught by fishermen to use as bait in pots for catching Southern rock lobster (also known as crayfish) or by line fishermen. Colonies were targeted for this purpose in various parts of Tasmania including Bruny Island and at West Island, South Australia.\nPlastic pollution.\nPlastics are swallowed by Australian little penguins, who mistake them for prey items. They present a choking hazard and also occupy space in the animal's stomach. Indigestible material in a penguin's stomach can contribute to malnutrition or starvation. Other larger plastic items, such as bottle packaging rings, can become entangled around penguins' necks, affecting their mobility.\nMass mortalities.\nA mass mortality event occurred in Port Phillip Bay in March 1935. The event coincided with moulting and deaths were attributed to fatigue. Another event occurred at Phillip Island in Victoria in 1940. The population there was believed to have fallen from 2,000 birds to 200. Dead birds were allegedly in healthy-looking condition, so speculation pointed to a disease or pathogen.\nOil spills resulting from shipping activity have occasionally resulted in mass mortalities of Australian little penguins. The worst of these was the \"Iron Baron\" oil spill at Low Head, Tasmania in 1995, followed by the \"Rena\" oil spill in New Zealand in 2011.\nCitizens have raised concerns about mass mortality of penguins, alleging a lack of official interest in the subject. Discoveries of dead penguins in Australia should be reported to the corresponding state's environment department. In South Australia, a mortality register was established in 2011.\nConservation.\n\"Eudyptula\" species are classified as \"at risk \u2013 declining\" under New Zealand's Wildlife Act 1953.\nOverall, little penguin populations in New Zealand have been decreasing. Some colonies have become extinct, and others continue to be at risk. Some new colonies have been established in urban areas. The species is not considered endangered in New Zealand, with the exception of the white-flippered subspecies found only on Banks Peninsula and nearby Motunau Island. Since the 1960s, the mainland population has declined by 60-70%; though a small increase has occurred on Motunau Island. A colony exists in Wellington Harbour on Matiu / Somes Island.\nProtestors have opposed the development of a marina at Kennedy Point, Waiheke Island in New Zealand for the risk it poses to little penguins and their habitat. Protesters claimed that they exhausted all legal means to oppose the project and have had to resort to occupation and non-violent resistance. Several arrests were made for trespassing. Construction of the marina was upheld by the Environment Court in 2012 and completed in 2022. Since the completion of the construction, little penguin burrows have still been found in the area, as well as one dead little penguin on the boat ramp there.\nThe West Coast Penguin Trust and DOC have worked in collaboration to maintain data on penguin mortality, the West Coast South Island colonies are highlighted as one of the \"Eudyptula minor\" colonies currently facing decline The data shows highest level of penguin mortality is caused by roadkill, likely due to many of the colonies being close to coastal highway. To mitigate this issue, a penguin-proof fence was erected in 2019 across 3.3\u00a0km of highway where road kill was most prevalent, no roadkill deaths have been recorded since its implementation\nThe risk of fire damage to habitats in Philip Island has been partially mitigated through the planting of fire-resistant indigenous vegetation in and around the nesting sites. Thus far this planting has occurred primarily in the &lt;10% of the colony most visible from tourist look-out points\nIn New South Wales, \"Eudyptula minor\" was listed as an endangered species in 1997 under the Endangered Species Act 1995. Since then conservation efforts such as public education, nest monitoring and labelling it as \"critical habitat\" were implemented. Despite these efforts, this mainland colony was met with additional challenges from threats from wild dogs and foxes, to lack of available local prey. The species is now listed as at-risk declining under the same act.\nIn general, the \"Eudyptula\" species are protected from various threats under different legislation in different jurisdictions:\nManagement of introduced predators.\nManagement strategies to mitigate the risk of domestic and feral dog and cats attack include establishing dog-free zones near penguin colonies and introducing regulations to ensure dogs to remain on leashes at all times in adjacent areas.\nThe threat of colony collapse at Warrnambool prompted conservationists to pioneer the experimental use of Maremma Sheepdogs to protect the colony and fend off would-be predators. The deployment of sheepdogs to protect the penguin colony has deterred the foxes and enabled the penguin population to rebound. This is in addition to the support from groups of volunteers who work to protect the penguins from attack at night. The first Maremma sheepdog to prove the concept was Oddball, whose story inspired a feature film of the same name, released in 2015. In December 2015, the BBC reported, \"The current dogs patrolling Middle Island are Eudy and Tula, named after the scientific term for the fairy penguin: Eudyptula. They are the sixth and seventh dogs to be used and a new puppy is being trained up [...] to start work in 2016\". Tula retired in 2019 after nine years of service, and her sister Eudy later died at age 12 in 2021. As of 2019, Tula is helping protect farm chickens and training younger guardian dogs.\nIn Sydney, professional hunters have been used to protect a colony of Australian little penguins. This effort is in addition to support from local volunteers who work to protect the penguins from attack at night. In 2019 it was announced that the defensive strategies were paying off and that Manly colony was recovering.\nNear some colonies in Tasmania, traps are set and feral cats that are captured are euthanized.\nHabitat restoration.\nSeveral efforts have been made to improve breeding sites on Kangaroo Island, including augmenting habitat with artificial burrows and revegetation work. The Knox School's habitat restoration efforts were filmed and broadcast in 2008 by \"Totally Wild\".\nIn 2019, concrete nesting \"huts\" were made for the little penguins of Lion Island in the mouth of the Hawkesbury River in New South Wales, Australia. The island had been ravaged by a fire which began with a lightning strike and destroyed 85% of the penguin's natural habitat.\nWeed control undertaken by the Friends of Five Islands in New South Wales helps improve prospects of breeding success for seabirds, including the little penguin. The main problem species on the Five Islands are kikuyu grass and coastal morning glory. The weeding work has resulted in increasing numbers of little penguin burrows in the areas weeded and the return of the white-faced storm petrel to the island after a 56-year breeding absence.\nOil spill response.\nPenguins are taken into care and cleaned by trained staff at specialised facilities when they are found alive in an oiled condition. When animals are first received at Phillip Island's rehabilitation facility, a knitted penguin sweater, made to a specific pattern, is applied to the bird. The sweater prevents the bird from attempting to preen off the oil itself. Once the birds have been treated and cleaned, the jumper is discarded. In 2019, the Phillip Island centre put out a call for 1,400 new penguin jumpers to be knitted after they increased the carrying capacity of their treatment facility. The last major oil spill the centre responded to saw 438 birds cleaned with a 96% survival rate after rehabilitation. The Melbourne Zoo also treats and rehabilitates oiled little penguins, and the Taronga Zoo has been cleaning and rehabilitating oiled penguins since the 1950s.\nZoological exhibits.\nZoological exhibits featuring purpose-built enclosures for \"Eudyptula\" species can be seen in Australia at the Adelaide Zoo, Melbourne Zoo, the National Zoo &amp; Aquarium in Canberra, Perth Zoo, Caversham Wildlife Park (Perth), Ballarat Wildlife Park, Sea Life Sydney Aquarium, and the Taronga Zoo in Sydney. Enclosures include nesting boxes or similar structures for the animals to retire into, a reconstruction of a pool and in some cases, a transparent aquarium wall to allow patrons to view the animals underwater while they swim.\n\"Eudyptula\" penguin exhibit exists at Sea World, on the Gold Coast, Queensland, Australia. In early March 2007, 25 of the 37 penguins died from an unknown toxin following a change of gravel in their enclosure. It is still not known what caused the deaths of the penguins, and it was decided not to return the 12 surviving penguins to the same enclosure where the penguins became ill. A new enclosure for the little penguin colony was opened at Sea World in 2008.\nIn New Zealand, \"Eudyptula\" penguin exhibits exist at the Auckland Zoo, the Wellington Zoo, the International Antarctic Centre and the National Aquarium of New Zealand. Since 2017, the National Aquarium of New Zealand, has featured a monthly \"Penguin of the Month\" board, declaring two of their resident animals the \"Naughty\" and \"Nice\" penguin for that month. Photos of the board have gone viral and gained the aquarium a large worldwide social media following.\nIn the United States, \"Eudyptula\" penguins can be seen at the Louisville Zoo the Bronx Zoo, Albuquerque Zoo, and the Cincinnati Zoo.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "18233", "revid": "34573757", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18233", "title": "Lake Balaton", "text": "Freshwater lake in Hungary\nLake Balaton () is a freshwater rift lake in the Transdanubian region of Hungary. It is the largest lake in Central Europe, and one of the region's foremost tourist destinations. The Zala River provides the largest inflow of water to the lake, and the canalized Si\u00f3 is the only outflow.\nThe mountainous region of the northern shore is known both for its historic character and as a major wine region, while the flat southern shore is known for its resort towns. Balatonf\u00fcred and H\u00e9v\u00edz developed early as resorts for the wealthy, but it was not until the late 19th century when landowners, ruined by \"Phylloxera\" attacking their grape vines, began building summer homes to rent out to the burgeoning middle class.\nName.\nIn distinction to all other Hungarian endonyms for lakes, which universally bear the suffix \"-t\u00f3\" 'lake', Lake Balaton is referred to in Hungarian with a definite article; that is, \"a Balaton\" 'the Balaton'. It was called \"lacus Pelsodis\" or \"Pelso\" by the Romans. The name is Indo-European in origin, derived from Slavic *\"bolto\" (Czech \"bl\u00e1to\", Slovak \"blato\", Polish \"b\u0142oto\"), meaning 'mud, swamp' (from earlier Proto-Slavic \"bolt\u044cno\", cf. , ). \nIn January 846, the Slavic prince Pribina began to build a fortress as his seat of power and several churches in the region of Lake Balaton, in the territory of modern Zalav\u00e1r surrounded by forests and swamps along the Zala River. His well-fortified castle and capital of the Lower Pannonian Principality became known as \"Blatnohrad\" or \"Moosburg\" (literally, 'Swamp Fortress'), and it served as a bulwark against both the Bulgarians and the Moravians.\nThe German name for the lake is '. It is unlikely it was given that name for being shallow because the adjective ' is a Greek loanword that was borrowed via French and entered general German vocabulary in the 17th century. It is also noteworthy that the average depth of Balaton () is not extraordinary for the area (cf. the average depth of the neighbouring Neusiedler See, which is roughly ).\nClimate.\nLake Balaton affects precipitation in the local area. The area receives approximately more precipitation than most of Hungary, resulting in more cloudy days and less extreme temperatures. The lake freezes over during winters. The microclimate around Lake Balaton has also made the region ideal for viticulture. The Mediterranean-like climate, combined with the soil (containing volcanic rock), has made the region notable for its production of wines since the Roman period 2,000 years ago.\nHistory.\nIt always has been an important location, both tactically and culturally (with many folk tales surrounding it). During the Ottoman wars played an important role in defending Royal Hungary where even battles were fought. While a few settlements on Lake Balaton, including Balatonf\u00fcred and H\u00e9v\u00edz, have long been resort centres for the Hungarian aristocracy, it was only in the late 19th century that the Hungarian middle class began to visit the lake. The construction of railways in 1861 and 1909 increased tourism substantially, but the post-war boom of the 1950s was much larger.\nBy the turn of the 20th century, Balaton had become a center of research by Hungarian biologists, geologists, hydrologists, and other scientists, leading to the country's first biological research institute being built on its shore in 1927.\nThe last major German offensive of World War II, Operation Spring Awakening, was conducted in the region of Lake Balaton in March 1945, being referred to as \"the Lake Balaton Offensive\" in many British histories of the war. The battle was a German attack by Sepp Dietrich's Sixth Panzer Army and the Hungarian Third Army between 6 and 16 March 1945, and in the end, resulted in a Red Army victory. Several Ilyushin Il-2 wrecks have been pulled out of the lake after having been shot down during the later months of the war.\nDuring the 1960s and 1970s, Balaton became a major tourist destination due to focused government efforts, causing the number of overnight guests in local hotels and campsites to increase from 700,000 in July 1965 to two million in July 1975. The number of weekend visitors to the region, including tens of thousands from Budapest, reached more than 600,000 by 1975. It was visited by ordinary working Hungarians, and especially for subsidised holiday excursions by National Council of Trade Union () members to exclusive hotels and small resorts () for them.\nIt also attracted many East Germans and other residents of the Eastern Bloc. West Germans could also visit, making Balaton a common meeting place for families and friends separated by the Berlin Wall until 1989.\nEcology.\nLake Balaton, Central Europe's largest shallow lake (area \u2248 594 km2; mean depth \u2248 3.3 m), extends 77 km W\u2013E through Transdanubia, Hungary. Because the Zala River delivers most of its inflow at the western end, the lake exhibits a persistent west-to-east trophic gradient from meso-eutrophic to oligo-mesotrophic conditions.\nBalaton is polymictic: frequent wind mixing prevents stable summer stratification, although a weak diel thermocline develops in calm periods. Average residence time is ~2.3 years; alkalinity (\u2248 2 meq L-1) and pH (8.2\u20139.1) reflect the surrounding dolomitic catchment. Restoration measures\u2014most notably the two-stage *Kis-Balaton Water Protection System* (KBWPS)\u2014and upgraded wastewater treatment have reduced external phosphorus loads since the 1990 s, yet episodic internal loading still triggers cyanobacterial blooms.\nFlora.\nEmergent and riparian vegetation.\nA nearly continuous reed (*\"Phragmites australis\"*) belt\u2014locally mixed with cattail (*\"Typha latifolia\"*) and bulrush (*\"Schoenoplectus lacustris\"*)\u2014fringes &gt; 100 km of shoreline, providing spawning substrate, wave attenuation and nutrient sequestration.\nSubmerged macrophytes.\nSpecies richness peaks in protected embayments where Secchi depth exceeds 1.5 m. Dominant taxa include *\"Potamogeton perfoliatus\"*, *\"P. pectinatus\"*, *\"Myriophyllum spicatum\"*, *\"Ceratophyllum demersum\"* and charophytes such as *\"Chara tomentosa\"*. \nSatellite-derived phenological metrics demonstrate that these macrophyte stands create pronounced spatio-temporal complexity in primary production dynamics and habitat structure.\nPhytoplankton.\nCommunity composition fluctuates between diatom-dominated spring assemblages (\"Cyclotella\", \"Aulacoseira\") and summer cyanobacterial blooms (notably \"Dolichospermum lemmermannii\", \"Microcystis aeruginosa\") in the western basins, whereas chlorophytes and cryptophytes prevail farther east. In 2019 Balaton experienced a record-setting bloom with chlorophyll-a &gt; 200 \u03bcg L-1, attributed to climate-driven sediment P release.\nFauna.\nFish.\nAbout fifty of Hungary's seventy-six native freshwater fish species occur. The littoral reed belt shelters cyprinids (common bream *\"Abramis brama\"*, bleak *\"Alburnus alburnus\"*), predator nurseries for pike-perch (*\"Sander lucioperca\"*) and northern pike (*\"Esox lucius\"*), and native endemics such as weather loach (*\"Misgurnus fossilis\"*). Feeding studies show cyprinids shift from zooplankton to benthic prey as they move inshore during summer. \nCommercial fishing has been banned since 2013; invasive gobiids (*\"Neogobius melanostomus\"*) and Prussian carp (*\"Carassius gibelio\"*) are increasingly targeted by recreational harvest regulations.\nZooplankton.\nRotifers (*Brachionus*, *Keratella*), cladocerans (*Daphnia cucullata*, *Bosmina longirostris*) and copepods (*Eudiaptomus gracilis*) dominate pelagic communities; densities reach 200\u2013400 ind. L-1 in Basin I but rarely exceed 100 ind. L-1 eastward.\nBenthic macroinvertebrates.\nSoft sediments host oligochaetes, chironomids and the invasive Asian clam (*\"Corbicula fluminea\"*). A 2024 lake-wide survey documented limited native recolonisation despite improved water quality, while alien taxa increased in rip-rap habitats.\nMicrobiota.\nComplementary 16S rRNA amplicon surveys show pronounced habitat and basin heterogeneity in the lake. A cross-lake transect in June 2017 revealed that planktonic communities are dominated by Proteobacteria (35\u201345 %) and Actinobacteria (20\u201330 %), whereas benthic sediments harbour proportionally more Proteobacteria (40\u201360 %), Bacteroidota and Firmicutes; Shannon diversity in sediments exceeded plankton by \u2248 25 %. The Zala River mouth contained distinct Betaproteobacterial (*Limnohabitans*) and Acidobacterial lineages, indicating the inflow as a hotspot of diversity.\nHigher-depth sequencing, detected 951 OTUs distributed across 26 phyla, including rare Verrucomicrobiota, Patescibacteria (candidate division CPR) and Parcubacteria that were previously overlooked by lower-resolution surveys, underscoring a substantial \"rare biosphere\" component in Balaton. Viral metagenomes further indicate high cyanophage richness, suggesting top-down control of bloom-forming cyanobacteria.\nHigh-resolution long-read sequencing of full-length 16S-rRNA genes on an Oxford Nanopore R10.4 flow cell, applied to water samples taken at 33 pelagic and littoral sites spanning all four basins, recovered &gt; 6 000 high-quality amplicon-sequence variants (ASVs). While some bacterial families, such as Methylophilaceae and Cryomorphaceae, are evenly distributed throughout the lake, others like Comamonadaceae and Burkholderiaceae show localized abundance, being prevalent in certain areas and scarce in others. The use of the long-read Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) sequencing has provided unprecedented insights into the genetic diversity and distribution of bacterioplankton across the lake. The high degree of shared taxa across all basins (209 taxa, 83%) suggests the presence of a core microbiome essential for the lake's ecosystem functioning. This core microbiome likely plays a vital role in maintaining ecological processes such as nutrient cycling and organic matter decomposition, which are crucial for the lake's health and stability. At the same time, the different groups identified between basins in lake water suggest a complex microbial ecosystem and highlight the need for ongoing monitoring to assess potential health risks and ecological change.\nConservation and management.\nKey measures include the KBWPS wetland complex, a 150-km2 reed-management zone, a ban on commercial fisheries (2013) and riparian buffer restoration. Recent Sentinel-2 analyses reveal strong functional connectivity between KBWPS and the western basins, mediating turbidity and chlorophyll pulses. Persistent challenges include sediment-mediated internal P release, shoreline hardening that favours alien macroinvertebrates, and climate-driven bloom intensification.\nTourism.\nThe major resorts around the lake are Si\u00f3fok, Keszthely, and Balatonf\u00fcred. Zam\u00e1rdi, another resort town on the southern shore, has been the site of Balaton Sound, a notable electronic music festival since 2007. Balatonkenese has hosted numerous traditional gastronomic events. Si\u00f3fok is known for attracting young people to it because of its large clubs. Keszthely is the site of the Festetics Palace and Balatonf\u00fcred is a historical bathing town which hosts the annual Anna Ball.\nThe peak tourist season extends from June until the end of August. The average water temperature during the summer is , which makes bathing and swimming popular on the lake. Most of the beaches consist of either grass, rocks, or the silty sand that also makes up most of the bottom of the lake. Many resorts have artificial sandy beaches and all beaches have step access to the water. Other tourist attractions include sailing, fishing, and other water sports, as well as visiting the countryside and hills, wineries on the north coast, and nightlife on the south shore. The Tihany Peninsula is a historical district. Badacsony is a volcanic mountain and wine-growing region as well as a lakeside resort. The lake is almost completely surrounded by separated bike lanes to facilitate bicycle tourism. Although the peak season at the lake is the summer, Balaton is also frequented during the winter, when visitors go ice-fishing or even skate, sledge, or ice-sail on the lake if it freezes over.\nS\u00e1rmell\u00e9k International Airport provides air service to Balaton (although most service is only seasonal).\nOther resort towns include Balatonalm\u00e1di, Balatonbogl\u00e1r, Balatonlelle, Fony\u00f3d, and Vonyarcvashegy.\nSport.\nThe annual Lake Balaton Crossing swim takes place in July. The race starts at R\u00e9vf\u00fcl\u00f6p and finishes at Balatonbogl\u00e1r for a total distance of 5.2 kilometres. \nTowns and villages.\nNorth shore.\nFrom east to west:\nBalatonf\u0151kaj\u00e1r - Balatonakarattya - Balatonkenese - Balatonf\u0171zf\u0151 - Balatonalm\u00e1di - Als\u00f3\u00f6rs - Paloznak - Csopak - Balatonar\u00e1cs - Balatonf\u00fcred - Tihany - Asz\u00f3f\u0151 - \u00d6rv\u00e9nyes - Balatonudvari - F\u00f6venyes - Balatonakali - Z\u00e1nka - Balatonszepezd - Szepezdf\u00fcrd\u0151 - R\u00e9vf\u00fcl\u00f6p - P\u00e1lk\u00f6ve - \u00c1brah\u00e1mhegy - Balatonrendes - Badacsonytomaj - Badacsony - Badacsonyt\u00f6rdemic - Szigliget - Balatonederics - Balatongy\u00f6r\u00f6k - Vonyarcvashegy - Gyenesdi\u00e1s - Keszthely\nSouth shore.\nFrom east to west:\nBalatonakarattya - Balatonaliga - Balatonvil\u00e1gos - S\u00f3st\u00f3 - Szabadif\u00fcrd\u0151 - Si\u00f3fok - Sz\u00e9plak - Zam\u00e1rdi - Sz\u00e1nt\u00f3d - Balatonf\u00f6ldv\u00e1r - Balatonsz\u00e1rsz\u00f3 - Balatonszemes - Balatonlelle - Balatonbogl\u00e1r - Fony\u00f3d - Fony\u00f3d\u2013Als\u00f3b\u00e9latelep - B\u00e9latelep - Balatonfenyves - Balatonm\u00e1riaf\u00fcrd\u0151 - Balatonkereszt\u00far - Balatonber\u00e9ny - Fen\u00e9kpuszta\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "18234", "revid": "3452924", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18234", "title": "Libro de los juegos", "text": "Work from the 13th century\nThe ' (Spanish: \"Book of games\"), or ' (\"Book of chess, dice and tables\", in Old Spanish), is a 13th century Spanish treatise of chess that synthesizes the information from Arabic works on this same topic, dice and tables (backgammon forebears) games, commissioned by Alfonso X of Castile, Galicia and Le\u00f3n and completed in his scriptorium in Toledo in 1283. It contains the earliest European treatise on chess as well as being the oldest document on European tables games, and is an exemplary piece of the literary legacy of the Toledo School of Translators.\nSignificance.\nThe is one of the most important documents for researching the history of board games. This \"celebrated MS book of games\" has been described as \"one of the choicest treasures of the library of the Escorial\" as well as \"perhaps the greatest source of information on board games ever compiled during the Middle Ages.\" It is both \"the earliest treatise on chess and the oldest document relating to tables which have had their origin in Europe.\"\nDescription.\nThe book consists of ninety-seven leaves of parchment, many with color illustrations, and contains 150 miniatures. The text is a treatise that addresses the playing of three game types: a game of skill, or chess; games of chance, or dice; and a third game type, tables, which combines elements of both skill and chance. These games are discussed in the final section of the book at both an astronomical and astrological level. Examining further, the text can also be read as an allegorical initiation tale and as a metaphysical guide for leading a balanced, prudent, and virtuous life. In addition to the didactic, although not overly moralistic, aspect of the text, the manuscript's illustrations reveal a rich cultural, social, and religious complexity.\nLocation.\nThe earliest manuscript is in the library of the monastery of El Escorial near Madrid in Spain, as manuscript T.I.6. It is bound in sheepskin and is 40\u00a0cm high and 28\u00a0cm wide (16\u00a0in\u00a0\u00d7\u00a011\u00a0in). A 1334 copy is held in the library of the Spanish Royal Academy of History in Madrid.\nBackground.\nAlfonso was likely influenced by his contact with scholars in the Arab world. Unlike many contemporary texts on the topic, he does not engage the games in the text with moralistic arguments; instead, he portrays them in an astrological context. He conceives of gaming as a dichotomy between the intellect and chance. The book is divided into three parts reflecting this: the first on chess (a game purely of abstract strategy), the second on dice (with outcomes controlled strictly by chance), and the last on tables (combining elements of both). The first section of the book also speaks of some other games of abstract strategy, notably alquerque and nine men's morris, among others. The text may have been influenced by Frederick II's text on falconry.\nChess.\nThe contains an extensive collection of writings on chess, with over 100 chess problems and variants. Among its more notable entries is a depiction of what Alfonso calls the \"ajedrex de los quatro tiempos\" (\"chess of the four seasons\"). This game is a chess variant for four players, described as representing a conflict between the four elements and the four humors. The chessmen are marked correspondingly in green, red, black, and white, and pieces are moved according to the roll of dice. Alfonso also describes a game titled \"astronomical chess\", played on a board of seven concentric circles, divided radially into twelve areas, each associated with a constellation of the Zodiac.\nAnother variant described in the book is the \"Grant Acedrex\", played over a 12x12 board with alternative pieces as the giraffe and the unicornio.\nTables.\nThe book describes the rules for a number of games in the tables family. One notable entry is \"todas tablas\", the equivalent of the Anglo-Scottish game of Irish, which some scholars have argued has several similarities to modern backgammon including an identical starting position and the same rules for movement and bearing off, albeit the accompanying image has a different opening layout. Alfonso also describes a variant played on a board with seven points in each table. Players rolled seven-sided dice to determine the movement of pieces, an example of Alfonso's preference for the number seven.\nThe tables games described are:\nArt.\nThe miniatures in the \"Libro de juegos\" vary between half- and full-page illustrations. The half-page miniatures typically occupy the upper half of a folio, with text explaining the game \"problem\" solved in the image occupying the bottom half. The back or second (verso) side of Folio 1, in a half-page illustration, depicts the initial stages of the creation of the \"Libro de juegos\", accompanied by text on the bottom half of the page, and the front or first (recto) side of Folio 2 depicts the transmission of the game of chess from an Indian Philosopher-King to three followers. The full-page illustrations are almost exclusively on the verso side of later folios and are faced by accompanying text on the recto side of the following folio. The significance of the change in miniature size and placement may indicate images of special emphasis, could merely function as a narrative or didactic technique, or could indicate different artisans at work in Alfonso's scriptorium as the project developed over time.\nHaving multiple artisans working on the \"Libro de juegos\" would have been a typical practice for medieval chanceries and scriptoria, where the labor of producing a manuscript was divided amongst individuals of varying capacities, for example the positions of scribe, draftsman, and apprentice cutting pages. But in addition to performing different tasks, various artisans could have labored at the same job, such as the work of illustration in the \"Libro de juegos\", thereby revealing a variety of hands or styles. The \"Libro de Juegos\" offers such evidence in the difference in size between the half- and full-page illustrations in addition to changes in framing techniques amongst the folios: geometrical frames with embellished corners, architectural frames established by loosely perspectival rooftops and colonnades, and games played under tents. Other stylistic variances are found in figural representation, in facial types, and in a repertoire of different postures assumed by the players in different folios in the manuscript.\nFor example, in a comparison of two miniatures, found on Folios 53v and 76r, examples of these different styles are apparent, although the trope of a pair of gamers is maintained. In Folio 53v, two men are playing chess, both wearing turbans and robes. Although they may be seated on rugs on the ground, as suggested by the ceramic containers that are placed on or front of the rug near the man on the right side of the board, the figures' seated positions, which are full frontal with knees bent at right angles, suggests that they are seated on stools or perhaps upholstered benches. The figures' robes display a Byzantine conservatism, with their modeled three-dimensionality and allusion to a Classical style, yet the iconic hand gestures are reminiscent of a Romanesque energy and theatricality. Although the figures are seated with their knees and torsos facing front, their shoulders and heads rotate in three-quarter profile toward the center of the page, the chess board, and each other. The proximal, inner arm of each player (the arm that is closest to the board) is raised in a speaking gesture; the distal, outside arms of the players are also raised and are bent at the elbows, creating a partial crossing of each player's torso as the hands lift in speaking gestures. The faces reveal a striking specificity of subtle detail, particular to a limited number of miniatures throughout the \"Libro de juegos\", perhaps indicative of a particular artist's hand. These details include full cheeks, realistic wrinkles around the eyes and across the brow, and a red, full-lipped mouth that hints at the Gothic affectations in figural representation coming out of France during the late twelfth and early thirteenth centuries.\nThe style in the miniature in Folio 76v is markedly different from the style in Folio 53v. In this case, the framed miniature contains two men, perhaps Spanish, with uncovered wavy light brown hair that falls to the jaw line. The men seem young, as the player on the left has no facial hair and his face is unlined. In both folios, both pairs of players are playing tables and seem to be well-dressed, although there is no addition of gold detailing to their robes as seen in the wardrobes of aristocratic players in other miniatures. These players are seated on the ground, leaning on pillows that are placed next to a tables board. In this miniature, the figure on the left side of the board faces the reader, while the figure on the right leans in to the board with his back to the reader. In other words, each player is leaning on his left elbow, using his right hand to reach across his body to play. In the miniatures of this style, the emphasis seems to be more on the posture of the player than the detail of their faces; this crossed, lounging style is only found in the folios of the \"Libro de tablas\", the third section of the \"Libro de juegos\" which explains tables games, again perhaps indicative of the work of a particular artist.\nOther visual details contemporaneous of Alfonso's court and social and cultural milieu infuse the \"Libro de juegos\". Although some of the miniatures are framed by simple rectangles with corners embellished by the golden castles and lions of Castile and Le\u00f3n, other are framed by medieval Spanish architectural motifs, including Gothic and Mud\u00e9jar arcades of columns and arches. At times, the figural depictions are hierarchical, especially in scenes with representations of Alfonso, where the king is seated on a raised throne while dictating to scribes or meting out punishments to gamblers. Yet a contemporary atmosphere of Spanish \"convivencia\" is evoked by the inclusion nobility, rogues, vagrants, young and old, men, women, Christian, Muslim, and Jewish characters. Alfonso himself is depicted throughout the text, both as participant and spectator and as an older man and as a younger. The pages are filled with many social classes and ethnicities in various stages of solving the challenges presented by games.\nIconography.\nThe can be divided into three parts: the games and problems it explores textually, the actual illuminations themselves, and the metaphysical allegories, where an analysis of the texts and illuminations reveals the movements of the macrocosmos of the universe and the microcosmos of man. The symbolism within the medieval illuminations, as explained by the accompanying texts, reveal allusions to medieval literature, art, science, law and philosophy. Intended as a didactic text, the manuscript functions as a manual that documents and explains how and why one plays games ranging from pure, intellectual strategy (chess), to games of pure chance (dice), to games that incorporate both elements (tables). Conceivably, Alfonso hoped to elucidate for himself how to better play the game of life, while also providing a teaching tool for others. The game of \"ajedrex\", or chess, is not the only game explained in the , but it does occupy the primary position in the text and is given the most attention to detail.\nIn the thirteenth century, chess had been played in Europe for almost two hundred years, having been introduced into Europe by Arabs around the year 1000. The Arabs had become familiar with the game as early as the eighth century when the Islamic empire conquered Persia, where the game of chess was alleged to have been originated. It is said that a royal advisor had invented the game in order to teach his king prudence without having to overtly correct him. As Arab contact with the West expanded, so too did the game and its various permutations, and by the twelfth century, chess was becoming an entertaining diversion among a growing population of Europeans, including some scholars, clergy, the aristocracy, and the merchant classes; thus, by the thirteenth century, the iconography and symbolism associated with chess would have been accessible and familiar to Alfonso and his literate court culture, who may have had access to the private library, and manuscripts, of Alfonso, including the .\nThe manuscript was a Castilian translation of Arabic texts, which were themselves translations of Persian manuscripts. The visual trope portrayed in the miniatures is seen in other European transcriptions of the Arabic translations, most notably the German Carmina Burana Manuscript: two figures, one on either side of the board, with the board tilted up to reveal to the readers the moves made by the players. The juxtaposition of chess and dice in Arabic tradition, indicating the opposing values of skill (chess) and ignorance (dice), was given a different spin in Alfonso's manuscript, however. As Alfonso elucidates in the opening section of the , the \"Libro de ajedrex\" (Book of chess) demonstrates the value of the intellect, the \"Libro de los dados\" (Book of dice) illustrates that chance has supremacy over pure intellect, and the\" Libro de las tablas\" (Book of tables) celebrates a conjoined use of both intellect and chance. Further, the iconographic linkage between chess and kingship in the Western tradition continued to evolve and became symbolic of kingly virtues, including skill, prudence, and intelligence.\nLiterary context.\nMost of the work accomplished in Alfonso's scriptorium consisted of translations into the Spanish vernacular from Arabic translations of Greek texts or classical Jewish medicinal texts. As a result, very few original works were produced by this scholar-king, relative to the huge amount of work that was translated under his auspices. This enormous focus on translation was perhaps an attempt by Alfonso to continue the legacy of academic openness in Castile, initiated by Islamic rulers in C\u00f3rdoba, where the emirates had also employed armies of translators in order to fill their libraries with Arabic translations of classic Greek texts. Alfonso was successful in promoting Castilian society and culture through his emphasis on the use of Galaico-Portuguese and Castilian, in academic, juridical, diplomatic, literary, and historical works. This emphasis also had the effect of reducing the universality of his translated works and original academic writings, as Latin was the \"lingua franca\" in both Iberia and Europe; yet Alfonso never desisted in his promotion of the Castilian vernacular.\nLegacy.\nIn 1217, Alfonso had captured the Kingdom of Murcia, on the Mediterranean coast south of Valencia, for his father, King Alfonso IX, thereby unifying the kingdoms of Castile and Le\u00f3n, bringing together the northern half of the Iberian Peninsula under one Christian throne. With the Christian \"Reconquista\" of the Peninsula underway, inroads into Islamic territories were successfully incorporating lands previously held by the \"taifa\" kingdoms. The arts and sciences prospered in the Kingdom of Castile under the confluence of Latin and Arabic traditions of academic curiosity as Alfonso sponsored scholars, translators, and artists of all three religions of the Book (Jewish, Christian, and Muslim) in his chanceries and scriptoria. Clerical and secular scholars from Europe turned their eyes to the Iberian Peninsula as the arts and sciences prospered in an early Spanish \"renaissance\" under the patronage of Alfonso X, who was continuing the tradition of (relatively) enlightened and tolerant \"convivencia\" established by the Muslim emirate several centuries earlier.\nAs an inheritor of a dynamic mixture of Arabic and Latin culture, Alfonso was steeped in the rich heritage of humanistic philosophy, and the production of his reveals the compendium of world views that comprised the eclectic thirteenth-century admixture of faith and science. According to this approach, man's actions could be traced historically, and his failures and successes could be studied as lessons to be applied to his future progress. These experiences can be played out and studied as they are lived, or as game moves played and analysed in the pages of the . It is a beautiful and luxurious document, rich not only in workmanship but also in the amount of scholarship of multiple medieval disciplines that are integrated in its pages.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

There is extensive pharmacology of lithium, the active component of this salt.\nHistory.\nLithium citrate was one of the lithium salts used to add lithium to drinks and water (lithia water) in the late 19th century and the early 20th century, when there was a general health craze for lithium with it believed to be a cure-all. The soft drink 7Up was at one point named \"7Up Lithiated Lemon Soda\" when it was formulated in 1929 because it claimed to contain lithium citrate. The beverage was a patent medicine marketed as a cure for hangover. In 1936 the federal government forced the manufacturer to remove a number of health claims, and because \"lithium was not an actual ingredient\", the name was changed to just \"7 Up\" in 1937. Many sources repeat an incorrect version of the story where the name is \"Bib-Label Lithiated Lemon-Lime Soda\" and the removal happened in 1948 due to a Food and Drug Administration ban.\nLithium citrate is used as a mood stabilizer and is used to treat mania, hypomania, depression and bipolar disorder. It can be administered orally in the form of a syrup.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "18237", "revid": "47862449", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18237", "title": "Lithium carbonate", "text": "&lt;templatestyles src=\"Chembox/styles.css\"/&gt;\nChemical compound\nLithium carbonate is an inorganic compound, the lithium salt of carbonic acid with the formula Li2CO3. This white salt is widely used in processing metal oxides. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines for its efficacy in the treatment of mood disorders such as bipolar disorder.\nUses.\nLithium carbonate is an important industrial chemical. Its main use is as a precursor to compounds used in lithium-ion batteries.\nGlasses derived from lithium carbonate are useful in ovenware. Lithium carbonate is a common ingredient in both low-fire and high-fire ceramic glaze. It forms low-melting fluxes with silica and other materials. Its alkaline properties are conducive to changing the state of metal oxide colorants in glaze, particularly red iron oxide (Fe2O3). Cement sets more rapidly when prepared with lithium carbonate, and is useful for tile adhesives. When added to aluminium trifluoride, it forms LiF which yields a superior electrolyte for the processing of aluminium.\nRechargeable batteries.\nLithium carbonate-derived compounds are crucial to lithium-ion batteries. Lithium carbonate may be converted into lithium hydroxide as an intermediate. In practice, two components of the battery are made with lithium compounds: the cathode and the electrolyte. The electrolyte is a solution of lithium hexafluorophosphate, while the cathode uses one of several lithiated structures, the most popular of which are lithium cobalt oxide and lithium iron phosphate.\nMedical uses.\nIn 1843, lithium carbonate was used to treat stones in the bladder. In 1859, some doctors recommended a therapy with lithium salts for a number of ailments, including gout, urinary calculi, rheumatism, mania, depression, and headache.\nIn 1948, John Cade discovered the anti-manic effects of lithium ions. This finding led to lithium carbonate's use as a psychiatric medication to treat mania, the elevated phase of bipolar disorder. Prescription lithium carbonate from a pharmacy is suitable for use as medicine in humans but industrial lithium carbonate is not since it may contain unsafe levels of toxic heavy metals or other toxicants. After ingestion, lithium carbonate is dissociated into pharmacologically active lithium ions (Li+) and (non-therapeutic) carbonate, with 300\u00a0mg of lithium carbonate containing approximately 8\u00a0mEq (8\u00a0mmol) of lithium ion. According to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), 300\u2013600\u00a0mg of lithium carbonate taken two to three times daily is typical for maintenance of bipolar I disorder in adults, where the exact dose given varies depending on factors such as the patient's serum lithium concentrations, which must be closely monitored by a physician to avoid lithium toxicity and potential kidney damage (or even kidney failure) from lithium-induced nephrogenic diabetes insipidus. Dehydration and certain drugs, including NSAIDs such as ibuprofen, can increase serum lithium concentrations to unsafe levels whereas other drugs, such as caffeine, may decrease concentrations. In contrast to the elemental ions sodium, potassium, and calcium, there is no known cellular mechanism specifically dedicated to regulating intracellular lithium. \nLithium can enter cells through epithelial sodium channels. Lithium ions interfere with ion transport processes &lt;templatestyles src=\"Crossreference/styles.css\" /&gt; that relay and amplify messages carried to the cells of the brain. Mania is associated with irregular increases in protein kinase C (PKC) activity within the brain. Lithium carbonate and sodium valproate, another drug conventionally used to treat the disorder, act in the brain by inhibiting PKC's activity and help to produce other compounds that also inhibit the PKC. Lithium carbonate's mood-controlling properties are not fully understood.\nHealth risks.\nTaking lithium salts has risks and side effects. Extended use of lithium to treat mental disorders has been known to lead to acquired nephrogenic diabetes insipidus. Lithium intoxication can affect the central nervous system and renal system and can be lethal. Over a prolonged period, lithium can accumulate in the principal cells of the collecting duct and interfere with antidiuretic hormone (ADH), which regulates the water permeability of principal cells in the collecting tubule. The medullary interstitium of the collecting duct system naturally has a high sodium concentration and attempts to maintain it. There is no known mechanism for cells to distinguish lithium ions from sodium ions, so damage to the kidney's nephrons may occur if lithium concentrations become too high as a result of dehydration, hyponatremia, an unusually low sodium diet, or certain drugs.\nRed pyrotechnic colorant.\nLithium carbonate is used to impart a red color to fireworks.\nProperties and reactions.\nUnlike sodium carbonate, which forms at least three hydrates, lithium carbonate exists only in the anhydrous form. Its solubility in water is low relative to other lithium salts. The isolation of lithium from aqueous extracts of lithium ores capitalizes on this poor solubility. Its apparent solubility increases 10-fold under a mild pressure of carbon dioxide; this effect is due to the formation of the metastable lithium bicarbonate, which is more soluble:\nLi2CO3 + CO2 + H2O \u21cc 2 LiHCO3\nThe extraction of lithium carbonate at high pressures of CO2 and its precipitation upon depressurizing is the basis of the Quebec process.\nLithium carbonate can also be purified by exploiting its diminished solubility in hot water. Thus, heating a saturated aqueous solution causes crystallization of Li2CO3.\nLithium carbonate, and other carbonates of group 1, do not decarboxylate readily. Li2CO3 decomposes at temperatures around 1300\u00a0\u00b0C.\nProduction.\nLithium is extracted from primarily two sources: spodumene in pegmatite deposits, and lithium salts in underground brine pools. About 82,000 tons were produced in 2020, showing significant and consistent growth.\nFrom underground brine reservoirs.\nIn the Salar de Atacama in the Atacama Desert of Northern Chile, lithium carbonate and hydroxide are produced from brine.\nThe process pumps lithium rich brine from below ground into shallow pans for evaporation. The brine contains many different dissolved ions, and as their concentration increases, salts precipitate out of solution and sink. The remaining supernatant liquid is used for the next step. The sequence of pans may vary depending on the concentration of ions in a particular source of brine.\nIn the first pan, halite (sodium chloride or common salt) crystallises. This has little economic value and is discarded. The supernatant, with ever increasing concentration of dissolved solids, is transferred successively to the sylvinite (sodium potassium chloride) pan, the carnalite (potassium magnesium chloride) pan and finally a pan designed to maximise the concentration of lithium chloride. The process takes about 15 months. The concentrate (30-35% lithium chloride solution) is trucked to Salar del Carmen. There, boron and magnesium are removed (typically residual boron is removed by solvent extraction and/or ion exchange and magnesium by raising the pH above 10 with sodium hydroxide) then in the final step, by addition of sodium carbonate, the desired lithium carbonate is precipitated out, separated, and processed.\nSome of the by-products from the evaporation process may also have economic value.\nThere is considerable attention to the use of water in this water poor region. SQM commissioned a life-cycle analysis (LCA) which concluded that water consumption for SQM's lithium hydroxide and carbonate is significantly lower than the average consumption by production from the main ore-based process, using spodumene. A more general LCA suggests the opposite for extraction from reservoirs.\nThe majority of brine based production is in the \"lithium triangle\" in South America.\nFrom \"geothermal\" brine.\nA potential source of lithium is the leachates of geothermal wells, carried to the surface. Recovery of lithium has been demonstrated in the field; the lithium is separated by simple precipitation and filtration. The process and environmental costs are primarily those of the already-operating well; net environmental impacts may thus be positive.\nThe brine of United Downs Deep Geothermal Power project near Redruth is claimed by Cornish Lithium to be valuable due to its high lithium concentration (220\u00a0mg/L) with low magnesium (&lt;5\u00a0mg/L) and total dissolved solids content of &lt;29g/L, and a flow rate of 40-60l/s.\nFrom ore.\n\u03b1-spodumene is roasted at 1100\u00a0\u00b0C for 1h to make \u03b2-spodumene, then roasted at 250\u00a0\u00b0C for 10 minutes with sulphuric acid.\nAs of 2020, Australia was the world's largest producer of lithium intermediates, all based on spodumene.\nIn recent years mining companies have begun exploration of lithium projects throughout North America, South America and Australia to identify economic deposits that can potentially bring new supplies of lithium carbonate online to meet the growing demand for the product.\nFrom clay.\nIn 2020 Tesla Motors announced a revolutionary process to extract lithium from clay in Nevada using only salt and no acid. This was met with scepticism.\nFrom end-of-life batteries.\nA few small companies are recycling spent batteries, focusing on recovering copper and cobalt. Some recover lithium carbonate alongside the compound Li2Al4(CO3)(OH)12\u22c53H2O\nalso.\nOther.\nIn April 2017 MGX Minerals reported it had received independent confirmation of its rapid lithium extraction process to recover lithium and other valuable minerals from oil and gas wastewater brine.\nElectrodialysis has been proposed to extract lithium from seawater, but it is not commercially viable.\nNatural occurrence.\nNatural lithium carbonate is known as zabuyelite. This mineral is connected with deposits of some salt lakes and some pegmatites.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It is popularly called the Moon buggy, a play on the term \"dune buggy\".\nBuilt by Boeing, each LRV has a mass of without payload. It could carry a maximum payload of , including two astronauts, equipment, and cargo such as lunar samples, and was designed for a top speed of , although it achieved a top speed of on its last mission, Apollo 17.\nEach LRV was carried to the Moon folded up in the Lunar Module's Quadrant 1 Bay. After being unpacked, each was driven an average of 30\u00a0km, without major incident. These three LRVs remain on the Moon.\nHistory.\nThe concept of a lunar rover predated Apollo, with a 1952\u20131954 series in \"Collier's Weekly\" magazine by Wernher von Braun and others, \"Man Will Conquer Space Soon!\" In this, von Braun described a six-week stay on the Moon, featuring 10-ton tractor-trailers for moving supplies.\nIn 1956, Mieczys\u0142aw G. Bekker published two books on land locomotion while he was a University of Michigan professor and a consultant to the U.S. Army Tank-Automotive Command's Land Locomotion Laboratory. The books provided much of the theoretical basis for future lunar vehicle development.\nIn 1959, Georg von Tiesenhausen conceived the lunar rover as a four-wheel-drive vehicle with noninflated, flexible wheels.\nEarly lunar mobility studies.\nIn the February 1964 issue of \"Popular Science\", von Braun, then director of NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC), discussed the need for a lunar surface vehicle, and revealed that studies had been underway at Marshall in conjunction with Lockheed, Bendix, Boeing, General Motors, Brown Engineering, Grumman, and Bell Aerospace. Saverio Morea was named LRV Manager at MSFC in 1961.\nBeginning in the early 1960s, a series of studies centering on lunar mobility were conducted under Marshall. This began with the lunar logistics system (LLS), followed by the mobility laboratory (MOLAB), then the lunar scientific survey module (LSSM), and finally the mobility test article (MTA). In early planning for the Apollo program, it had been assumed that two Saturn V launch vehicles would be used for each lunar mission: one for sending the crew aboard a Lunar Surface Module (LSM) to lunar orbit, landing, and returning, and a second for sending an LSM-Truck (LSM-T) with all of the equipment, supplies, and transport vehicle for use by the crew while on the surface. All of the first Marshall studies were based on this dual-launch assumption, allowing a large, heavy, roving vehicle.\nGrumman and Northrop, in late 1962, began to design pressurized-cabin vehicles, with electric motors for each wheel. At about this same time, Bendix and Boeing started their internal studies on lunar transportation systems. Mieczys\u0142aw Bekker, now with General Motors Defense Research Laboratories at Santa Barbara, California, was completing a study for NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory on a small, uncrewed lunar roving vehicle for the Surveyor program. Ferenc Pavlics, originally from Hungary, used a wire-mesh design for \"resilient wheels,\" a design that would be followed in future small rovers.\nIn early 1963, NASA selected Marshall for studies in an Apollo Logistics Support System (ALSS). Following reviews of all earlier efforts, this resulted in a 10-volume report. Included was the need for a pressurized vehicle in the weight range, accommodating two men with their expendables and instruments for traverses up to two weeks in duration. In June 1964, Marshall awarded contracts to Bendix and Boeing, with GM's lab designated as the vehicle technology subcontractor. Bell Aerospace was already under contract for studies of Lunar Flying Vehicles.\nEven as the Bendix and Boeing studies were underway, Marshall was examining a less ambitious surface exploration activity, the LSSM. This would be composed of a fixed, habitable shelter\u2013laboratory with a small lunar-traversing vehicle that could either carry one man or be remotely controlled. This mission would still require a dual launch with the moon vehicle carried on the \"lunar truck\". Marshall's Propulsion and Vehicle Engineering (P&amp;VE) lab contracted with Hayes International to make a preliminary study of the shelter and its related vehicle. Because of the potential need for an enclosed vehicle for enlarged future lunar explorations, those design efforts continued for some time and resulted in several full-scale test vehicles.\nWith pressure from Congress to hold down Apollo costs, Saturn V production was reduced, allowing only a single launch per mission. Any roving vehicle would have to fit on the same lunar module as the astronauts. In November 1964, two-rocket models were put on indefinite hold, but Bendix and Boeing were given study contracts for small rovers. The name of the lunar excursion module was changed to simply the Lunar Module, indicating that the capability for powered \"excursions\" away from a lunar-lander base did not yet exist. There could be no mobile lab\u2014the astronauts would work out of the LM. Marshall also continued to examine uncrewed robotic rovers that could be controlled from the Earth.\nFrom the beginnings at Marshall, the Brown Engineering Company of Huntsville, Alabama, had participated in all of the lunar mobility efforts. In 1965, Brown became the prime support contractor for Marshall's P&amp;VE Laboratory. With an urgent need to determine the feasibility of a two-man self-contained lander, von Braun bypassed the usual procurement process and had P&amp;VE's Advanced Studies Office directly task Brown to design, build, and test a prototype vehicle. While Bendix and Boeing would continue to refine concepts and designs for a lander, test model rovers were vital for Marshall human factors studies involving spacesuit-clad astronauts interfacing with power, telemetry, navigation, and life-support rover equipment.\nBrown's team made full use of the earlier small-rover studies, and commercially available components were incorporated wherever possible. The selection of wheels was of great importance, and almost nothing was known at that time about the lunar surface. The Marshall Space Sciences Laboratory (SSL) was responsible for predicting surface properties, and Brown was also prime support contractor for this lab; Brown set up a test area to examine a wide variety of wheel-surface conditions. To simulate Pavlics's \"resilient wheel,\" a four-foot-diameter inner tube wrapped with nylon ski rope was used. On the small test rover, each wheel had a small electric motor, with overall power provided by standard truck batteries. A roll bar gave protection from overturning accidents.\nIn early 1966, Brown's vehicle became available for examining human factors and other testing. Marshall built a small test track with craters and rock debris where several different mock-ups were compared; it became obvious that a small rover would be best for the proposed missions. The test vehicle was also operated in remote mode to determine characteristics that might be dangerous to the driver, such as acceleration, bounce-height, and turn-over tendency as it traveled at higher speeds and over simulated obstacles. The test rover's performance under one-sixth gravity was obtained through flights on a KC-135A aircraft in a Reduced Gravity parabolic maneuver; among other things, the need for a very soft wheel and suspension combination was shown. Although Pavlics' wire-mesh wheels were not initially available for the reduced gravity tests, the mesh wheels were tested on various soils at the Waterways Experiment Station of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers at Vicksburg, Mississippi. Later, when wire-mesh wheels were tested on low-g flights, the need for wheel fenders to reduce dust contamination was found. The model was also extensively tested at the U.S. Army's Yuma Proving Ground in Arizona, as well as the Army's Aberdeen Proving Ground in Maryland.\nLunar Roving Vehicle Project.\nDuring 1965 and 1967, the Summer Conference on Lunar Exploration and Science brought together leading scientists to assess NASA's planning for exploring the Moon and to make recommendations. One of their findings was that the LSSM was critical to a successful program and should be given major attention. At Marshall, von Braun established a Lunar Roving Task Team, and in May 1969, NASA approved the Manned Lunar Rover Vehicle Program as a Marshall hardware development. The project was led by Eberhard Rees, Director of Research and Development at Marshall, who oversaw the design and construction of the rover, with Saverio Morea acting as project manager.\nOn 11 July 1969, just before the successful Moon landing of Apollo 11, a request for proposal for the final development and building the Apollo LRV was released by Marshall. Boeing, Bendix, Grumman, and Chrysler submitted proposals. Following three months of proposal evaluation and negotiations, Boeing was selected as the Apollo LRV prime contractor on 28 October 1969. Boeing would manage the LRV project under Henry Kudish in Huntsville, Alabama. Kudish was replaced the following year in 1970 by LRV Project Manager Earl Houtz. As a major subcontractor, the General Motors Defense Research Laboratories in Santa Barbara, California, would furnish the mobility system (wheels, motors, and suspension); this effort would be led by GM Program Manager Samuel Romano and Ferenc Pavlics. Boeing in Seattle, Washington, would furnish the electronics and navigation system. Vehicle testing would take place at the Boeing facility in Kent, Washington, and the chassis manufacturing and overall assembly would be completed at the Boeing facility in Huntsville.\nThe first cost-plus-incentive-fee contract to Boeing was for $19,000,000 and called for delivery of the first LRV by 1 April 1971. Cost overruns, however, led to a final cost of $38,000,000 (equal to $ today), which was about the same as NASA's original estimate. Four lunar rovers were built, one each for Apollo missions 15, 16, and 17; and one used for spare parts after the cancellation of further Apollo missions. Other LRV models were built: a static model to assist with human factors design; an engineering model to design and integrate the subsystems; two one-sixth gravity models for testing the deployment mechanism; a one-gravity trainer to give the astronauts instruction in the operation of the rover and allow them to practice driving it; a mass model to test the effect of the rover on the LM structure, balance, and handling; a vibration test unit to study the LRV's durability and handling of launch stresses; and a qualification test unit to study integration of all LRV subsystems. A paper by Saverio Morea gives details of the LRV system and its development.LRVs were used for greater surface mobility during the Apollo J-class missions, Apollo 15, Apollo 16, and Apollo 17. The rover was first used on 31 July 1971, during the Apollo 15 mission. This greatly expanded the range of the lunar explorers. Previous teams of astronauts were restricted to short walking distances around the landing site due to the bulky space suit equipment required to sustain life in the lunar environment. The range, however, was operationally restricted to remain within walking distance of the lunar module, in case the rover broke down at any point. The rovers were designed with a top speed of about , although Eugene Cernan recorded a maximum speed of , giving him the (unofficial) lunar land-speed record.\nThe LRV was developed in only 17 months and performed all its functions on the Moon with no major anomalies. Scientist-astronaut Harrison Schmitt of Apollo 17 said, \"The Lunar Rover proved to be the reliable, safe and flexible lunar exploration vehicle we expected it to be. Without it, the major scientific discoveries of Apollo 15, 16, and 17 would not have been possible; and our current understanding of lunar evolution would not have been possible.\"\nThe LRVs experienced some minor problems. The rear fender extension on the Apollo 16 LRV was lost during the mission's second extra-vehicular activity (EVA) at station 8 when John Young bumped into it while going to assist Charles Duke. The dust thrown up from the wheel covered the crew, the console, and the communications equipment. High battery temperatures and resulting high power consumption ensued. No repair attempt was mentioned.\nThe fender extension on the Apollo 17 LRV broke when accidentally bumped by Eugene Cernan with a hammer handle. Cernan and Schmitt taped the extension back in place, but due to the dusty surfaces, the tape did not adhere, and the extension was lost after about one hour of driving, causing the astronauts to be covered with dust. For their second EVA, a replacement \"fender\" was made with some EVA maps, duct tape, and a pair of clamps from inside the Lunar Module that were nominally intended for the moveable overhead light. This repair was later undone so that the clamps could be taken inside for the return launch. The maps were brought back to Earth and are now on display at the National Air and Space Museum. The abrasion from the dust is evident on some portions of the makeshift fender.\nThe color TV camera mounted on the front of the LRV could be remotely operated by Mission Control in pan and tilt axes as well as zoom. This allowed far better television coverage of the EVA than the earlier missions. On each mission, at the conclusion of the astronauts' stay on the surface, the commander drove the LRV to a position away from the Lunar Module so that the camera could record the ascent stage launch. The camera operator in Mission Control experienced difficulty in timing the various delays so that the LM ascent stage was in frame through the launch. On the third and final attempt (Apollo 17), the launch and ascent were successfully tracked.\nNASA's rovers, left behind, are among the artificial objects on the Moon, as are the Soviet Union's uncrewed rovers, \"Lunokhod 1\" and \"Lunokhod 2\".\nFeatures and specifications.\nThe Apollo Lunar Roving Vehicle is a battery electric vehicle designed to operate in the low-gravity vacuum of the Moon and to be capable of traversing the lunar surface, allowing the Apollo astronauts to extend the range of their surface extravehicular activities. Three LRVs were used on the Moon: one on Apollo 15 by astronauts David Scott and Jim Irwin, one on Apollo 16 by John Young and Charles Duke, and one on Apollo 17 by Eugene Cernan and Harrison Schmitt. The mission commander served as the driver, occupying the left-hand seat of each LRV. Features are available in papers by Morea, Baker, and Kudish.\nMass and payload.\nThe Lunar Roving Vehicles have a mass of , and were designed to hold an additional payload of . This resulted in weights in the approximately one-sixth g on the lunar surface of empty (curb weight) and fully loaded (gross vehicle weight). The vehicle frame is long with a wheelbase of . The height of the vehicles is . The frame is made of 2219 aluminum alloy tubing welded assemblies and consisted of a three-part chassis that was hinged in the center so it could be folded up and hung in the Lunar Module Quadrant 1 bay, which was kept open to space by omission of the outer skin panel. They have two side-by-side foldable seats made of tubular aluminum with nylon webbing and aluminum floor panels. An armrest was mounted between the seats, and each seat had adjustable footrests and a Velcro-fastened seat belt. A large mesh dish antenna was mounted on a mast on the front center of the rover. The suspension consists of a double horizontal wishbone with upper and lower torsion bars and a damper unit between the chassis and upper wishbone. Fully loaded, the LRV has a ground clearance of .\nWheels and power.\nThe wheels were designed and manufactured by General Motors Defense Research Laboratories in Santa Barbara, California. Ferenc Pavlics was given special recognition by NASA for developing the \"resilient wheel\". They consisted of a spun aluminum hub and a , tire made of zinc-coated woven steel strands attached to the rim. Titanium chevrons covered 50% of the contact area to provide traction. Inside the tire was a titanium bump stop frame to protect the hub. Dust guards were mounted above the wheels. Each wheel had its own electric drive made by Delco, a brushed DC electric motor capable of at 10,000 rpm, attached to the wheel via an 80:1 harmonic drive, and a mechanical brake unit. In the case of drive failure, astronauts could remove pins to disengage the drive from the wheel, allowing the wheel to spin freely.\nManeuvering capability was provided through the use of front and rear steering motors. Each series-wound DC steering motor was capable of . The front and rear wheels could pivot in opposite directions to achieve a tight turning radius of , or could be decoupled so only front or rear would be used for steering. The wheels were linked in Ackermann steering geometry, where the inside tires have a greater turn angle than the outside tires, to avoid sideslip.\nPower was provided by two 36-volt silver-zinc potassium hydroxide non-rechargeable batteries developed by Eagle-Picher with a charge capacity of 121 A\u00b7h each (a total of 242 A\u00b7h), yielding a range of . These were used to power the drive and steering motors and also a 36-volt utility outlet mounted on the front of the LRV to power the communications relay unit or the TV camera. LRV batteries and electronics were passively cooled, using change-of-phase wax thermal capacitor packages and reflective, upward-facing radiating surfaces. While driving, radiators were covered with mylar blankets to minimize dust accumulation. When stopped, the astronauts would open the blankets, and manually remove excess dust from the cooling surfaces with hand brushes.\nControl and navigation.\nA T-shaped hand controller situated between the two seats controlled the four drive motors, two steering motors, and brakes. Moving the stick forward powered the LRV forward, left and right turned the vehicle left or right, and pulling backwards activated the brakes. Activating a switch on the handle before pulling back would put the LRV into reverse. Pulling the handle all the way back activated a parking brake. The control and display modules were situated in front of the handle and gave information on the speed, heading, pitch, and power and temperature levels.\nNavigation was based on continuously recording direction and distance through use of a directional gyro and odometer and feeding this data to a computer that would keep track of the overall direction and distance back to the LM. There was also a Sun-shadow device that could give a manual heading based on the direction of the Sun, using the fact that the Sun moved very slowly in the sky.\nUsage.\nThe LRV was used during the lunar surface operations of Apollo 15, 16 and 17, the J missions of the Apollo program. On each mission, the LRV was used on three separate EVAs, for a total of nine lunar traverses, or sorties. During operation, the commander (CDR) always drove, while the Lunar Module Pilot (LMP) was a passenger who assisted with navigation.\nAn operational constraint on the use of the LRV was that the astronauts must be able to walk back to the LM if the LRV were to fail at any time during the EVA (called the \"Walkback Limit\"). Thus, the traverses were limited in the distance they could go at the start and at any time later in the EVA. Therefore, they went to the farthest point away from the LM and worked their way back to it so that, as the life support consumables were depleted, their remaining walk back distance was equally diminished. This constraint was relaxed during the longest traverse on Apollo 17, based on the demonstrated reliability of the LRV and spacesuits on previous missions. A paper by Burkhalter and Sharp provides details on usage.\nDeployment.\nAstronaut deployment of the Lunar Roving Vehicle from the LM's open Quadrant 1 bay was achieved with a system of pulleys and braked reels using ropes and cloth tapes. The rover was folded and stored in the bay with the underside of the chassis facing out. One astronaut would climb the egress ladder on the LM and release the rover, which would then be slowly tilted out by the second astronaut on the ground through the use of reels and tapes. As the rover was let down from the bay, most of the deployment was automatic. The rear wheels folded out and locked in place. When they touched the ground, the front of the rover could be unfolded, the wheels deployed, and the entire frame let down to the surface by pulleys.\nThe rover components locked into place upon opening. Cabling, pins, and tripods would then be removed and the seats and footrests raised. After switching on all the electronics, the vehicle was ready to back away from the LM.\nLocations.\nFour flight-ready LRVs were manufactured, as well as several others for testing and training. Three were transported to and left on the Moon via the Apollo 15, 16, and 17 missions (LRV-1 to 3), with the fourth (LRV-4) used for spare parts for the first three following the cancellation of Apollo 18.\nThe rover used on Apollo 15 was left at Hadley-Apennine (). The rover used on Apollo 16 was left at Descartes (). The rover used on Apollo 17 was left at Taurus-Littrow () and was seen by the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter during passes in 2009 and 2011. In 2020 the State of Washington designated the flown rovers as historic landmarks.\nSince only the upper stages of the lunar excursion modules could return to lunar orbit from the surface, the vehicles, along with the lower stages were abandoned. As a result, the only lunar rovers on display are LRV-4, test vehicles, trainers, and mock-ups.\nAs mentioned before, additional test units were built, like a static model, two 1/6 gravity models, a mass model.\nReplicas of rovers are on display at the Johnson Space Center in Houston, Texas, the Kennedy Space Center Visitors Complex in Cape Canaveral, Florida, the National Museum of Naval Aviation in Pensacola, Florida, the Evergreen Aviation &amp; Space Museum in McMinnville, Oregon, the Kansas Cosmosphere and Space Center in Hutchinson, Kansas, the Omega Museum in Biel, Switzerland and the Technik Museum Speyer in Speyer, Germany. A replica on loan from the Smithsonian Institution is on display at the attraction at Epcot at the Walt Disney World Resort near Orlando, Florida.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It is neighbored by Archer City, Texas (population of 1,834) and Wichita Falls, Texas (population of 104,553) which reside within the Central Great Plains ecoregion.\nHydrology.\nLake Kickapoo reservoir was created by the impoundment of North Fork Little Wichita River, its only in-flow tributary, in 1946. The out-flow tributaries are Kickapoo Creek, Brier Creek, and Slippery Creek. It has a mean water level of , surface area of , and elevation of above sea level as of 2022. The storage capacity, as of October 29, 2022, is with a maximum capacity of . The reservoir storage has steadily dropped by 293 acre-feet/year since 1945 when it had a total capacity of , due to increasing drought events in the region.\nEcoregion.\nLake Kickapoo resides within the Broken Red Plains subdivision of the Central Great Plains ecoregion. The Broken Red Plains ecoregion is defined by red clay and sandy soils, with irregular sandstone and shrub-covered surface of the even more specific Wichita Formation ecoregion. It is predominantly grass-/shrublands with plant species like Texas wintergrass, blue grama, buffalograss, sand bluestem, etc. The riparian vegetation includes species such as cedar elm trees, pecan trees, black willow trees, and tobosa grass. This region has an annual precipitation of 30 inches and mean air temperature of 41 degrees Fahrenheit in January and 84 degrees Fahrenheit in July.\nUses.\nWater supply.\nThe construction of Lake Kickapoo Dam began in January 1945 and was completed on December 15, 1945. However, the deliberate impoundment of the North Fork Little Wichita River, a tributary of the Red River, did not occur until February 1, 1946. Lake Kickapoo Dam is classified as earth-fill embankment dam with a length of (including spillway) and height of . This dam's maximum design water surface has the capability to reach above sea level but has been experiencing much lower levels due to recent droughts in the area. The dam's uncontrolled spillway is classified as ogee concrete and has a crest elevation of above sea level. Lake Kickapoo reservoir is owned by the city of Wichita Falls and operated for the continued use as a water supply. Although it is owned by the city of Wichita Falls, the dam is regulated by the government entity Texas Commission on Environmental Quality.\nU.S. Naval Space Surveillance.\nOne of the nine Air Force Space Surveillance System (formerly NAVSPASUR) sites is located at Lake Kickapoo (33\u00b032.764\u2032N 98\u00b045.763\u2032W). https:// is one of three transmitter sites of the southern surveillance network, which is operated by the U.S. Naval Command. The purpose of these stations is to maintain an electromagnetic fence that has the capability to identify objects as far as . The Lake Kickapoo field station was constructed in 1951 to fill a gap in the surveillance fence. It is considered unique due to its transmitting power of 560 kilowatts via the combination of commercial FM and TV power unit frequencies.\nRecreation.\nSports fishing.\nThe main source of recreation for Lake Kickapoo is sports fishing. The reservoir contains sports fish species, such as Blue catfish (abundant), Channel catfish, Flathead catfish, White Bass (abundant), Largemouth Bass, and White Crappie (declining in abundance). These fish species are supported by prey fish, such as Gizzard shad (abundant) and Bluegill (decreased abundance).\nManagement plans have been enacted to support the genetic diversity of Largemouth Bass due to this species designation as a source for Texas Parks and Wildlife Department hatchery brood stock program. This is due to the decline in habitat for spawning and nursery areas via decreased water elevation.\nHistory.\nNamesake.\nThe name was derived from the Native American Kickapoo tribe that was native to that area along with the nearby inflow stream, Kickapoo Creek.\nLand use.\nThere is an elevated abundance of honey mesquite in the Broken Red Plains that has been associated with the 19th century cattle drives and subsequent grazing pressure via land use.\nDam.\nLake Kickapoo Dam was designed by F. M. Rugeley and A. J. Gates.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "18245", "revid": "28481209", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18245", "title": "Labyrinth", "text": "Elaborate, confusing structure in Greek mythology\nIn Greek mythology, the Labyrinth () is an elaborate, confusing structure designed and built by the legendary artificer Daedalus for King Minos of Crete at Knossos. Its function was to hold the Minotaur, the monster eventually killed by the hero Theseus. Daedalus had so cunningly made the Labyrinth that he could barely escape it after he built it.\nAlthough early Cretan coins occasionally exhibit branching (multicursal) patterns, the single-path (unicursal) seven-course \"Classical\" design without branching or dead ends became associated with the Labyrinth on coins as early as 430 BC, and similar non-branching patterns became widely used as visual representations of the Labyrinth \u2013 even though both logic and literary descriptions make it clear that the Minotaur was trapped in a complex branching maze. Even as the designs became more elaborate, visual depictions of the mythological Labyrinth from the Roman era until the Renaissance are almost invariably unicursal. Branching mazes were reintroduced only when hedge mazes became popular during the Renaissance.\nIn English, the term \"labyrinth\" is generally synonymous with \"maze\". As a result of the long history of unicursal representation of the mythological Labyrinth, however, many contemporary scholars and enthusiasts observe a distinction between the two. In this specialized usage, \"maze\" refers to a complex branching multicursal puzzle with choices of path and direction, while a unicursal \"labyrinth\" has only a single path to the center. A labyrinth in this sense has an unambiguous route to the center and back and presents no navigational challenge.\nUnicursal labyrinths appeared as designs on pottery or basketry, as body art, and in etchings on walls of caves or churches. The Romans created many primarily decorative unicursal designs on walls and floors in tile or mosaic. Many labyrinths set in floors or on the ground are large enough that the path can be walked. Unicursal patterns have been used historically both in group ritual and for private meditation, and are increasingly found for therapeutic use in hospitals and hospices.\nEtymology.\n\"Labyrinth\" is a word of pre-Greek origin whose derivation and meaning are uncertain. Maximillian Mayer suggested as early as 1892 that \"labyrinthos\" might derive from \"labrys\", a Lydian word for \"double-bladed axe\". Arthur Evans, who excavated the Minoan palace of Knossos in Crete early in the 20th century, suggested that the ruins there inspired the story of the labyrinth, and since the double axe motif appears in the palace ruins, he asserted that \"labyrinth\" could be understood to mean \"the house of the double axe\". The same symbol, however, was discovered in other palaces in Crete. Nilsson observed that in Crete the double axe is not a weapon and always accompanies goddesses or women and not a male god.\nThe association with \"labrys\" lost some traction when Linear B was deciphered in the 1950s, and an apparent Mycenaean Greek rendering of \"labyrinth\" appeared as (). This may be related to the Minoan word \"du-pu\u2082-re\", which appears in Linear A on libation tablets and in connection with Mount Dikte and Mount Ida, both of which are associated with caverns. Caverns near Gortyna, the Cretan capital in the 1st century AD, were called \"labyrinthos\".\nPliny's \"Natural History\" gives four examples of ancient labyrinths: the Cretan labyrinth, an Egyptian labyrinth, a Lemnian labyrinth, and an Italian labyrinth. These are all complex underground structures, and this appears to have been the standard Classical understanding of the word.\nBeekes also finds the relation with \"labrys\" speculative, and suggests instead a relation with Greek ('narrow street').\nAncient labyrinths.\nCretan labyrinth.\nWhen the Bronze Age site at Knossos was excavated by archaeologist Arthur Evans, the complexity of the architecture prompted him to suggest that the palace had been the Labyrinth of Daedalus. Evans found various bull motifs, including an image of a man leaping over the horns of a bull, as well as depictions of a labrys carved into the walls. On the strength of a passage in the \"Iliad\", it has been suggested that the palace was the site of a dancing-ground made for Ariadne by the craftsman Daedalus,\nwhere young men and women, of the age of those sent to Crete as prey for the Minotaur, would dance together. By extension, in popular legend the palace is associated with the myth of the Minotaur.\nIn the 2000s, archaeologists explored other potential sites of the labyrinth. Oxford University geographer Nicholas Howarth believes that \"Evans's hypothesis that the palace of Knossos is also the Labyrinth must be treated sceptically.\" Howarth and his team conducted a search of an underground complex known as the Skotino cave but concluded that it was formed naturally. Another contender is a series of tunnels at Gortyn, accessed by a narrow crack but expanding into interlinking caverns. Unlike the Skotino cave, these caverns have smooth walls and columns, and appear to have been at least partially man-made. This site corresponds to a labyrinth symbol on a 16th-century map of Crete in a book of maps in the library of Christ Church, Oxford. A map of the caves themselves was produced by the French in 1821. The site was also used by German soldiers to store ammunition during the Second World War. Howarth's investigation was shown on a documentary produced for the National Geographic Channel.\nThe Egyptian labyrinth.\nIn Book II of his \"Histories\", Herodotus applies the term \"labyrinth\" to a building complex in Egypt \"near the place called the City of Crocodiles\", that he considered to surpass the pyramids. The structure, which may have been a collection of funerary temples such as are commonly found near Egyptian pyramids, was destroyed in antiquity and can only be partially reconstructed. During the nineteenth century, the remains of this ancient Egyptian structure were discovered at Hawara in the Faiyum Oasis by Flinders Petrie at the foot of the pyramid of the twelfth-dynasty pharaoh Amenemhat III (reigned c. 1860 BC to c. 1814 BC).\nPliny's Lemnian labyrinth.\nPliny the Elder's \"Natural History\" (36.90) lists the legendary Smilis, reputed to be a contemporary of Daedalus, together with the historical mid-sixth-century BC architects and sculptors Rhoikos and Theodoros as two of the makers of the Lemnian labyrinth, which Andrew Stewart regards as \"evidently a misunderstanding of the Samian temple's location \"en limnais\" ['in the marsh'].\"\nPliny's Italian labyrinth.\nAccording to Pliny, the Tomb of Lars Porsena contained an underground maze. Pliny's description of the exposed portion of the tomb is intractable; Pliny, it seems clear, had not observed this structure himself, but is quoting the historian and Roman antiquarian Varro.\nAncient labyrinths outside Europe.\nA design essentially identical to the 7-course \"classical\" pattern appeared in Native American culture, the Tohono O'odham people labyrinth which features I'itoi, the \"Man in the Maze.\" The Tonoho O'odham pattern has two distinct differences from the classical: it is radial in design, and the entrance is at the top, where traditional labyrinths have the entrance at the bottom (see below). The earliest appearances cannot be dated securely; the oldest is commonly dated to the 17th century.\nUnsubstantiated claims have been made for the early appearance of labyrinth figures in India, such as a prehistoric petroglyph on a riverbank in Goa purportedly dating to circa 2500 BC. Other examples have been found among cave art in northern India and on a dolmen shrine in the Nilgiri Mountains, but are difficult to date accurately. Securely datable examples begin to appear only around 250 BC. Early labyrinths in India typically follow the Classical pattern or a local variant of it; some have been described as plans of forts or cities.\nLabyrinths appear in Indian manuscripts and Tantric texts from the 17th century onward. They are often called \"Chakravyuha\" in reference to an impregnable battle formation described in the ancient Mahabharata epic. Lanka, the capital city of mythic R\u0101vana, is described as a labyrinth in the 1910 translation of Al-Beruni's \"India\" (c. 1030 AD) p.\u00a0306 (with a diagram on the following page).\nBy the White Sea, notably on the Solovetsky Islands, there have been preserved more than 30 stone labyrinths. The most remarkable monument is the Stone labyrinths of Bolshoi Zayatsky Island \u2013 a group of some 13 stone labyrinths on 0.4\u00a0km2 area of one small island. Local archaeologists have speculated that these labyrinths may be 2,000\u20133,000 years old, though most researchers remain dubious.\nLabyrinth as pattern.\nThe 7-course \"Classical\" or \"Cretan\" pattern known from Cretan coins (ca 400\u2013200 BC) appears in several examples from antiquity, some perhaps as early as the late Stone Age or early Bronze Age. Roman floor mosaics typically unite four copies of the classical labyrinth (or a similar pattern) interlinked around the center, squared off as the medium requires, but still recognisable. An image of the Minotaur or an allusion to the legend of the Minotaur appears at the center of many of these mosaic labyrinths.\nThe four-axis medieval patterns may have developed from the Roman model, but are more varied in how the four quadrants of the design are traced out. The Minotaur or other danger is retained in the center of several medieval examples. The Chartres pattern (named for its appearance in Chartres Cathedral) is the most common medieval design; it appears in manuscripts as early as the 9th century.\nMedieval labyrinths and turf mazes.\nWhen the early humanist Benzo d'Alessandria visited Verona before 1310, he noted the \"\"Laberinthum\" which is now called the Arena\"; perhaps he was seeing the \"cubiculi\" beneath the arena's missing floor.\nThe full flowering of the medieval labyrinth came about from the twelfth through fourteenth centuries with the grand pavement labyrinths of the gothic cathedrals, notably Chartres, Reims and Amiens in northern France. The symbolism or purpose behind these is unclear, and may have varied from one installation to the next. Descriptions survive of French clerics performing a ritual Easter dance along the path on Easter Sunday. Some labyrinths may have originated as allusions to the Holy City; and some modern writers have theorized that prayers and devotions may have accompanied the perambulation of their intricate paths. Although some books (in particular guidebooks) suggest that the mazes on cathedral floors served as substitutes for pilgrimage paths, the earliest attested use of the phrase \"chemin de Jerusalem\" (path to Jerusalem) dates to the late 18th century when it was used to describe mazes at Reims and Saint-Omer. The accompanying ritual, depicted in Romantic illustrations as involving pilgrims following the maze on their knees while praying, may have been practiced at Chartres during the 17th century. The cathedral labyrinths are thought to be the inspiration for the many turf mazes in the UK, such as survive at Wing, Hilton, Alkborough, and Saffron Walden.\nOver the same general period, some 500 or more non-ecclesiastical labyrinths were constructed in Scandinavia. These labyrinths, generally in coastal areas, are marked out with stones, most often in the simple 7- or 11-course classical forms. They often have names which translate as \"Troy Town.\" They are thought to have been constructed by fishing communities: trapping malevolent trolls or winds in the labyrinth's coils might ensure a safe fishing expedition. There are also stone labyrinths on the Isles of Scilly, although none is known to date from before the nineteenth century.\nThere are examples of labyrinths in many disparate cultures. The symbol has appeared in various forms and media (petroglyphs, classic-form, medieval-form, pavement, turf, and basketry) at some time throughout most parts of the world, from Native North and South America to Australia, Java, India, and Nepal.\nModern labyrinths.\nStarting in the late 20th century, there has been a resurgence of interest in labyrinths and a revival in labyrinth building, of both unicursal and multicursal patterns. Approximately 6,000 labyrinths have been registered with the Worldwide Labyrinth Locator; these are located around the world in private properties, libraries, schools, gardens, and recreational areas, as well as famous temples and cathedrals.\nThe labyrinth is also treated in contemporary fine arts. Examples include Piet Mondrian's \"Pier and Ocean\" (1915), Joan Mir\u00f3's \"Labyrinth\" (1923), Pablo Picasso's \"Minotauromachy\" (1935), M. C. Escher's \"Relativity\" (1953), Friedensreich Hundertwasser's \"Labyrinth\" (1957), Jean Dubuffet's \"Logological Cabinet\" (1970), Richard Long's \"Connemara sculpture\" (1971), Joe Tilson's \"Earth Maze\" (1975), Richard Fleischner's \"Chain Link Maze\" (1978), Istv\u00e1n Orosz's \"Atlantis Anamorphosis\" (2000), Dmitry Rakov's \"Labyrinth\" (2003), and drawings by contemporary American artist Mo Morales employing what the artist calls \"Labyrinthine projection.\" The Italian painter Davide Tonato has dedicated many of his artistic works to the labyrinth theme. In modern imagery, the labyrinth of Daedalus is often represented by a multicursal maze, in which one may become lost.\nMark Wallinger has created a set of 270 enamel plaques of unicursal labyrinth designs, one for every tube station in the London Underground, to mark the 150th anniversary of the Underground. The plaques were installed over a 16-month period in 2013 and 2014, and each is numbered according to its position in the route taken by the contestants in the 2009 Guinness World Record Tube Challenge.\nCultural meanings.\nPrehistoric labyrinths may have served as traps for malevolent spirits or as paths for ritual dances. Many Roman and Christian labyrinths appear at the entrances of buildings, suggesting that they may have served a similar apotropaic purpose. In their cross-cultural study of signs and symbols, \"Patterns that Connect\", Carl Schuster and Edmund Carpenter present various forms of the labyrinth and suggest various possible meanings, including not only a sacred path to the home of a sacred ancestor, but also, perhaps, a representation of the ancestor him/herself: \"...many [New World] Indians who make the labyrinth regard it as a sacred symbol, a beneficial ancestor, a deity. In this they may be preserving its original meaning: the ultimate ancestor, here evoked by two continuous lines joining its twelve primary joints.\" Schuster also observes the common theme of the labyrinth being a refuge for a trickster; in India, the demon Ravana has dominion over labyrinths, the trickster Djonaha lives in a labyrinth according to Sumatran Bataks, and Europeans say it is the home of a rogue.\nOne can think of labyrinths as symbolic of pilgrimage: people walking the path ascend toward salvation or enlightenment. Mystical teachings in traditions across centuries suggest that they can also be understood as coded maps of the spiritual path. \nLabyrinth Walking.\nLabyrinth walking is a form of active meditation in which one navigates a labyrinth for meditative or therapeutic purposes. Modern labyrinths have been built in places of rehabilitation, such as prisons and hospitals, to be used in this way. While this activity is often connected with religious practice, it has been introduced into medical settings for spiritual and secular usage alike. Some faith-based researchers have claimed that labyrinth walking can help calm the mind and guide people through internal growth, while secular studies regarding its effectiveness in reducing stress are still ongoing.\nChristian use.\nLabyrinths have on various occasions been used in Christian tradition as a part of worship. The earliest known example is from a fourth-century pavement at the Basilica of St Reparatus, at Orleansville, Algeria, with the words \"Sancta Eclesia\" [\"sic\"] at the center, though it is unclear how it might have been used in worship.\nIn medieval times, labyrinths began to appear on church walls and floors around 1000 AD. The most famous medieval labyrinth, with great influence on later practice, was created in Chartres Cathedral.\nThe use of labyrinths has recently been revived in some contexts of Christian worship. Many churches in Europe and North America have constructed permanent, typically unicursal, labyrinths, or employ temporary ones (e.g., painted on canvas or outlined with candles). For example, a labyrinth was set up on the floor of St Paul's Cathedral for a week in March 2000. Some conservative Christians disapprove of labyrinths, considering them pagan practices or \"New Age\" fads.\nUsage in media.\nLabyrinths and mazes have been embraced by the video game industry, and countless video games include such a feature. For example, the 1994 video game Marathon features many maze-like passages the player must navigate.\nA number of film, game, and music creations feature labyrinths. For instance, the avant-garde multi-screen film \"In the Labyrinth\" presents a search for meaning in a symbolic modern labyrinth. The well-received 2006 film \"Pan's Labyrinth\" draws heavily upon labyrinth legend for symbolism. A magical labyrinth appears in the third episode, \"And The Horns of a Dilemma\", of \"The Librarians\". See Labyrinth (disambiguation) for a further list of titles. The cult classic film by Jim Henson Labyrinth (1986 film) features an enormous otherworldly maze which a young woman must traverse to save her younger brother.\nThe Argentine writer Jorge Luis Borges was entranced with the idea of the labyrinth, and used it extensively in his short stories (such as \"The House of Asterion\" in \"The Aleph\"). His use of it has inspired other authors (e.g. Umberto Eco's \"The Name of the Rose\", Mark Z. Danielewski's \"House of Leaves\"). Additionally, Roger Zelazny's fantasy series \"The Chronicles of Amber\" features a labyrinth, called \"the Pattern,\" which grants those who walk it the power to move between parallel worlds. In Rick Riordan's series Percy Jackson &amp; the Olympians, the events of the fourth novel, \"The Battle of the Labyrinth\", predominantly take place within the labyrinth of Daedalus, which has followed the heart of the West to settle beneath the United States. Ursula K. Le Guin used an underground labyrinth in the second book of her Earthsea series, \"The Tombs of Atuan\", in which the series hero Ged is captured by the book's protagonist Tenar on his trip to the Kargish Empire \u2013 the spiritual power of the \"Nameless Ones\" is vested at least in part in the labyrinth. Australian author Sara Douglass incorporated some labyrinthine ideas in her series The Troy Game, in which the Labyrinth on Crete is one of several in the ancient world, created with the cities as a source of magical power. Lawrence Durrell's \"The Dark Labyrinth\" depicts travelers trapped underground in Crete. Because a labyrinth can serve as a metaphor for situations that are difficult to be extricated from, Octavio Paz titled his book on Mexican identity \"The Labyrinth of Solitude\", describing the Mexican condition as orphaned and lost.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Today best known for concert harps, the company's Chicago headquarters and manufacturing facility contains a showroom and concert hall. George W. Lyon and Patrick J. Healy began the company in 1864 as a sheet music shop. By the end of the 19th century, they manufactured a wide range of musical instruments\u2014including not only harps, but pianos, guitars, mandolins, banjos, ukuleles and various brass and other percussion instruments.\nToday, Lyon &amp; Healy harps are widely played by professional musicians, since they are one of the few makers of harps for orchestral use\u2014which are known as \"concert harps\" or \"pedal harps\". Lyon &amp; Healy also makes smaller \"folk harps\" or lever harps (based on traditional Irish and Scottish instruments) that use levers to change string pitch instead of pedals. In the 1980s, Lyon &amp; Healy also began to manufacture electroacoustic harps and, later, solid body electric harps.\nHistory.\nGeorge W. Lyon, a native of Northborough, Massachusetts; and Patrick J. Healy, born in Mallow, Ireland, founded the company in 1864, after they moved from Boston to start a sheet music shop for music publisher Oliver Ditson. Determining Lyon &amp; Healy's history is complicated because its building and company records were destroyed in two fires, including the Great Chicago Fire of 1871. Two smaller fires did little damage to the firm and did not result in data loss.\nCompany letters and trade catalogs don't provide exact dates that would reveal when Lyon &amp; Healy began manufacturing instruments. An article in the \"Musical Courier\" states that Lyon &amp; Healy began manufacturing instruments in 1885. Clearly, Lyon &amp; Healy was making fretted string instruments in the 1880s, with Washburn (guitars, mandolins, banjos, and zithers) as their premier line. By the 1900s, if not earlier, Lyon &amp; Healy might well have been manufacturing bowed string instruments.\nAccording to Vintage Guitar magazine, \"Circa 1900, the firm was so large it manufactured under a host of sub-brands; Washburn is perhaps the most recognized, though Leland, Lakeside, and American Conservatory are still seen.\" https://\nLyon &amp; Healy also made various percussion instruments. Later, Lyon &amp; Healy began manufacturing brass instruments, possibly as early as the 1890s. Lyon &amp; Healy also repaired instruments, and offered engraving services. Complicating matters still further, Lyon &amp; Healy engraved instruments that it retailed but did not actually manufacture. In its 1892 catalog, it claimed that it manufactured 100,000 instruments annually.\nFor a period of time, 1876 to the Great Depression, the \"Golden Age\" of piano making, the company hand made pianos and reed organs in addition to harps. Like their harps, Lyon &amp; Healy put the highest quality and craftsmanship in building these instruments. In addition to making grand pianos, George W. Lyon patented his cottage upright in 1878. Its top-of-the-line pianos were sold under the Lyon &amp; Healy name. Their pianos have been described as being remarkably powerful, clear, and having a singing tone. Some have compared the Lyon &amp; Healy grand pianos to other high end brands of the time such as Steinway &amp; Sons, Wm. Knabe &amp; Co., and Sohmer. Lower cost pianos were sold by Lyon &amp; Healy under various other brand names. Like most other Golden Age piano companies, they stopped making pianos during the Great Depression.\nLyon retired in 1889 and Healy became the company's first president. That year, Lyon &amp; Healy built their first harp. Healy wanted to develop a harp better suited to the rigors of the American climate than available European models. They successfully produced a harp notable for its strength, pitch reliability, and freedom from unwanted vibration. Previously, most harps in North America were made by small groups of craftsmen in France, England, Ireland, or Italy.\nIn 1890, Lyon &amp; Healy introduced the Style 23 Harp, still a popular and recognizable design. It has 47 strings, highly decorative floral carving on the top of the column, base, and feet, and a fleur de lis pattern at the bottom of the column. It is available in a gold version. It is tall, and weighs about . Lyon &amp; Healy produces one of the most ornate and elaborate harps in the world, the Louis XV, which includes carvings of leaves, flowers, scrolls, and shells along its neck and kneeblock, as well the soundboard edges.\nLyon would later form a new company with E.A. Potter called Lyon &amp; Potter, and remained there until his death on January 12, 1894. Healy died of pneumonia on April 3, 1905.\nIn the 1890s the company\u2014which used the slogan,\"Everything in music\"\u2014began building pipe organs. In 1894 Robert J. Bennett came to Lyon &amp; Healy from the Hutchings company of Boston to head their organ department. The largest surviving Lyon &amp; Healy pipe organ is at the Our Lady of Sorrows Basilica in Chicago. It is a large organ of four manuals and 57 ranks of pipes.\nThey also made small pipe organs. An example survives at St. Mary's Catholic Church in Aspen Colorado. It is a two manual tracker with a 30 note straight pedalboard and 7 ranks. It is believed to have been built around 1900, and can still be pumped by hand.\nBy the 1900s, Lyon &amp; Healy was one of the largest music publishers in the world, and was a major producer of musical instruments. However, In late 1920s, Lyon &amp; Healy sold its brass musical instrument manufacturing branch (see \"New Langwill Index\"). In the 1970s, the firm concentrated solely upon making and selling harps.\nCarlos Salzedo, the pre-eminent harpist, collaborated with Lyon &amp; Healy on the design of their Art Nouveau model Style 11, still made today. Later, in 1928, Lyon &amp; Healy introduced one of the most unusual harps ever mass-produced, the \"Salzedo Model\". It was named for Salzedo, and designed by the artist Witold Gordon. It is an Art Deco style instrument that incorporates bold red and silver stripes on the soundboard, with squared layers of five in the base and column, and instead of the usual curved-edge sounding board, an angular one to combine the features of both the straight-sided sounding board with the expanded sound of the extended sounding board. Its design is considered by experts to be a work of fine art, that utilizes light and shadow to give it additional dimension, as well as a distinct appearance.\nLyon &amp; Healy has mostly employed numbers to name its varied models of pedal harps, and they can be confused as sometimes a number, such as 23, was used for more than one model. The current range of models can be viewed on the company website, as well as those of major harp dealers, but in the used harp listings, you may find the older models of differing designs. All are notable for their elegance and attention to detail. There was an additional Washburn line of smaller, simpler pedal harps sold to many schools in the early 20th century. Lyon &amp; Healy's Style 23 harp is widely considered the gold standard of tone quality. Each model may differ slightly, as the column design has some effect on the projection of the sound waves generated by the instrument. While the same woods are generally used, each instrument is to some degree individual in sound from its birth, and gains more individuality as it is played.\nIn the 1960s, Lyon &amp; Healy introduced a smaller lever harp, the \"Troubadour\", a 36-string harp marketed to beginners with rent-to-buy options and group classes. This harp stands , and weighs . Much later, they introduced the Ogden, which is a bit smaller, but has 37 strings, and then the Prelude, which is considerably larger, and styled more like a pedal harp. Between the Troubadour and Ogden models, there was an Egan model, but it was discontinued.\nIn the late 1970s, Steinway &amp; Sons (then owned by CBS) purchased Lyon &amp; Healy and soon after closed all retail stores, which sold sheet music and musical instruments, to focus on harp production.\nBy 1985, Lyon &amp; Healy also made folk harps, also known as \"Irish harps\", which are even smaller than the Troubadour. The \"Shamrock model folk harp\" has 34 strings. It stands tall with its legs. The legs can be removed so the player can hold the instrument lap\u2014style on the knees. It weighs about . It features Celtic designs on the soundboard. An Irish or folk harp player is sometimes called a \"harper\" rather than \"harpist\". \nDePaul University now owns the Wabash building. Lyon &amp; Healy harps are still in Chicago, Illinois, at 168 North Ogden Avenue. The building was once home to the recording studios of Orlando R. Marsh. They are in the process of moving to a new building farther west of the Chicago Loop.\nCraftsmanship.\nWood in harp construction varies by instrument, but Sitka Spruce (Picea sitchensis) is the most common soundboard wood. Various Lyon &amp; Healy guitars, mandolins, and many other instrument types reside in major musical instrument museums in the U.S. and Europe.\nLyon and Healy now primarily manufactures four types of harps\u2014the \"lever harp\", \"petite pedal harp\", \"semi-grande pedal harp\", and \"concert grand harp\". They also make limited numbers of \"special harps\" called \"concert grands\". Lyon &amp; Healy makes electric lever harps in nontraditional colors such as pink, green, blue, and red.\nLyon &amp; Healy Corporation.\nLyon &amp; Healy Corporation is a musical product distribution company in North America representing brands such as Paoletti Guitars, Bacci Guitars, Chapman Guitars, Magneto Guitars, Batson Guitars, MarconiLAB, Red Sound, Dophix, SIM1, Delta, and Acus Sound Engineering.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The company is owned by the Volkswagen Group through its subsidiary Audi.\nFerruccio Lamborghini (1916\u20131993), an Italian manufacturing magnate, founded Automobili Ferruccio Lamborghini S.p.A. in 1963 to compete with Ferrari. The company was noted for using a rear mid-engine, rear-wheel drive layout. Lamborghini grew rapidly during its first decade, but sales plunged in the wake of the 1973 worldwide financial downturn and the oil crisis. The firm's ownership changed three times after 1973, including a bankruptcy in 1978. American Chrysler Corporation took control of Lamborghini in 1987 and sold it to Malaysian investment group Mycom Setdco and Indonesian group V'Power Corporation in 1994. In 1998, Mycom Setdco and V'Power sold Lamborghini to the Volkswagen Group where it was placed under the control of the group's Audi division.\nNew products and model lines were introduced to the brand's portfolio and brought to the market and saw an increased productivity for the brand. In the late 2000s, during the Great Recession, Lamborghini's sales dropped nearly 50%.\nLamborghini currently produces the twin-turbo V8 plug-in Hybrid Temerario, the Urus SUV powered by a twin-turbo V8 engine, and the Revuelto, a V12/electric hybrid, as of 2025. In addition, the company produces V12 engines for offshore powerboat racing.\nLamborghini Trattori, founded in 1948 by Ferruccio Lamborghini, is headquartered in Pieve di Cento, Italy, and continues to produce tractors. Since 1973, Lamborghini Trattori has been a separate entity from the Lamborghini's automobile division.\nHistory.\nManufacturing magnate Italian Ferruccio Lamborghini founded the company in 1963 with the objective of producing a refined grand touring car to compete with offerings from established marques such as Ferrari. The company's first models, such as the 350 GT, were released in the mid-1960s. Lamborghini was noted for the 1966 Miura sports coup\u00e9, which used a rear mid-engine, rear-wheel drive layout.\nIn 1963, Ferruccio Lamborghini, already an established industrialist who manufactured tractors, boilers, and air conditioners, founded Lamborghini Automobili on May 7, 1963.\nThe company was headquartered in a purpose-built facility in Sant'Agata Bolognese. He surrounded himself with highly capable engineers and technicians: Giotto Bizzarrini designed the engine, Gian Paolo Dallara and Paolo Stanzani developed the chassis, and Franco Scaglione designed the bodywork. The first model, the 350 GTV, was not a success due to its futuristic style and remained a one-off prototype. The project was then handed over to the Milanese coachbuilder Touring, which created a more classic and sober design. The new car, named the 350 GT, was a fast and elegant two-seater grand tourer (according to Ferruccio's standards) and was the first series-produced car by Lamborghini. It achieved moderate sales success and was followed by the 400 GT (which benefited from an increased engine capacity) and the 400 GT 2+2, both presented in 1966.\nLamborghini grew rapidly during its first ten years, but sales fell in the wake of the 1973 worldwide financial downturn and the oil crisis. Ferruccio Lamborghini sold the company to Georges-Henri Rossetti and Ren\u00e9 Leimer and retired in 1974. The company went bankrupt in 1978, and was placed in the receivership of brothers Jean-Claude and Patrick Mimran in 1980. The Mimrans purchased the company out of receivership by 1984 and invested heavily in its expansion. Under the Mimrans' management, Lamborghini's model line was expanded from the Countach to include the Jalpa sports car and the LM002 high-performance off-road vehicle.\nThe Mimrans sold Lamborghini to the Chrysler Corporation in 1987. After replacing the Countach with the Diablo and discontinuing the Jalpa and the LM002, Chrysler sold Lamborghini to Malaysian investment group Mycom Setdco and Indonesian group V'Power Corporation in 1994. In 1998, Mycom Setdco and V'Power sold Lamborghini to the Volkswagen Group where it was placed under the control of the group's Audi division. New products and model lines were introduced to the brand's portfolio and brought to the market and saw an increased productivity for the brand Lamborghini. In the late 2000s, during the Great Recession, Lamborghini's sales dropped nearly 50%.\nIn 2021, the CEO of Lamborghini said that by 2024 all its models will be hybrid.\nProducts.\nAutomobiles.\nAs of the 2018 model year, Lamborghini's automobile product range consists of three model lines, two of which are mid-engine two-seat sports cars while the third one is a front engined, all-wheel drive SUV.\nModels in production.\nProduction of the new Revuelto began in mid-2023 and was delivered in late 2023 as a 2024 model. A 6.5L naturally aspirated V12 engine and three magnetic motors power the car for a combined output of 1,001\u00a0hp (1,015 PS). The Revuelto is the successor to the Aventador.\nThe Temerario is a mid-engine plug-in hybrid sports car. It was officially unveiled on August 16, 2024\nIntending to double its sales volume by 2019, Lamborghini also added an SUV named Urus in its line-up which is powered by a twin-turbo V8 engine and utilizes a front engine, all-wheel drive layout.\nMarine engines.\nMotori Marini Lamborghini produces a large V12 marine engine block for use in World Offshore Series Class 1 powerboats. A Lamborghini branded marine engine displaces approximately and outputs approximately .\nLamborghini motorcycle.\nIn the mid-1980s, Lamborghini produced a limited-production run of a sports motorcycle. UK weekly newspaper \"Motor Cycle News\" reported in 1994\u2014when featuring an example available through an Essex motorcycle retailer\u2014that 24 examples were produced with a Lamborghini alloy frame having adjustable steering head angle, Kawasaki GPz1000RX engine/transmission unit, Ceriani front forks and Marvic wheels.

This was unusual for the time, as many sports car manufacturers sought to demonstrate speed, reliability, and technical superiority through motorsport participation. Enzo Ferrari in particular was known for considering his road car business mostly a source of funding for his participation in motor racing. Ferruccio's policy led to tensions between him and his engineers, many of whom were racing enthusiasts; some had previously worked at Ferrari. When Dallara, Stanzani, and Wallace began dedicating their spare time to the development of the P400 prototype, they designed it to be a road car with racing potential, one that could win on the track and also be driven on the road by enthusiasts. When Ferruccio discovered the project, he allowed them to go ahead, seeing it as a potential marketing device for the company, while insisting that it would not be raced. The P400 went on to become the Miura. The closest the company came to building a true race car under Lamborghini's supervision were a few highly modified prototypes, including those built by factory test driver Bob Wallace, such as the Miura SV-based \"Jota\" and the Jarama S-based \"Bob Wallace Special\".\nIn the mid-1970s, while Lamborghini was under the management of Georges-Henri Rossetti, Lamborghini entered into an agreement with BMW to develop, then manufacture 400 cars for BMW in order to meet Group 4 homologation requirements. BMW lacked experience developing a mid-engined vehicle and believed that Lamborghini's experience in that area would make Lamborghini an ideal choice of partner. Due to Lamborghini's shaky finances, Lamborghini fell behind schedule developing the car's structure and running gear. When Lamborghini failed to deliver working prototypes on time, BMW took the program in house, finishing development without Lamborghini. BMW contracted with Baur to produce the car, which BMW named the M1, delivering the first vehicle in October 1978.\nIn 1985, Lamborghini's British importer developed the Countach QVX, in conjunction with Spice Engineering, for the 1986 Group C championship season. One car was built, but lack of sponsorship caused it to miss the season. The QVX competed in only one race, the non-championship 1986 Southern Suns 500\u00a0km race at Kyalami in South Africa, driven by Tiff Needell. Despite the car finishing better than it started, sponsorship could once again not be found and the programme was cancelled.\nLamborghini was an engine supplier in Formula One for the 1989 through 1993 Formula One seasons. It supplied engines to Larrousse (1989\u20131990, 1992\u20131993), Lotus (1990), Ligier (1991), Minardi (1992), and to the Modena team in 1991. While the latter is commonly referred to as a factory team, the company saw itself as a supplier, not a backer. The 1992 Larrousse\u2014Lamborghini was largely uncompetitive but noteworthy in its tendency to spew oil from its exhaust system. Cars following closely behind the Larrousse were commonly coloured yellowish-brown by the end of the race. Lamborghini's best result was achieved with Larrousse at the 1990 Japanese Grand Prix, when Aguri Suzuki finished third on home soil.\nIn 1991, a Lamborghini Formula One motor was used in the Konrad KM-011 Group C sports car, but the car only lasted a few races before the project was cancelled. The same engine, re-badged a Chrysler, Lamborghini's then-parent company, was tested by McLaren towards the end of the 1993 season, with the intent of using it during the 1994 season. Although driver Ayrton Senna was reportedly impressed with the engine's performance, McLaren pulled out of negotiations, choosing a Peugeot engine instead, and Chrysler ended the project.\nTwo racing versions of the Diablo were built for the Diablo Supertrophy, a single-model racing series held annually from 1996 to 1999. In the first year, the model used in the series was the Diablo SVR, while the Diablo 6.0 GTR was used for the remaining three years. Lamborghini developed the Murci\u00e9lago R-GT as a production racing car to compete in the FIA GT Championship, the Super GT Championship and the American Le Mans Series in 2004. The car's highest placing in any race that year was the opening round of the FIA GT Championship at Valencia, where the car entered by Reiter Engineering finished third from a fifth-place start. In 2006, during the opening round of the Super GT championship at Suzuka, a car run by the Japan Lamborghini Owners Club garnered the first victory (in class) by an R-GT. A GT3 version of the Gallardo has been developed by Reiter Engineering. A Murci\u00e9lago R-GT entered by All-Inkl.com racing, driven by Christophe Bouchut and Stefan M\u00fccke, won the opening round of the FIA GT Championship held at Zhuhai International Circuit, achieving the first major international race victory for Lamborghini.\nComplete Formula One results.\n() (results in bold indicate pole position) \nMarketing.\nBrand identity.\nThe world of bullfighting is a key part of Lamborghini's identity. In 1962, Ferruccio Lamborghini visited the Seville ranch of Don Eduardo Miura, a renowned breeder of Spanish fighting bulls. Lamborghini was so impressed by the majestic Miura animals that he decided to adopt a raging bull as the emblem for the automaker he would open shortly.\nVehicle nomenclature.\nAfter producing two cars with alphanumeric designations, Lamborghini once again turned to the bull breeder for inspiration. Don Eduardo was filled with pride when he learned that Ferruccio had named a car for his family and their line of bulls; the fourth Miura to be produced was unveiled to him at his ranch in Seville.\nThe automaker would continue to draw upon the bullfighting connection in future years. The Islero was named for the Miura bull that killed the famed bullfighter Manolete in 1947. \"Espada\" is the Spanish word for sword, sometimes used to refer to the bullfighter himself. The Jarama's name carried a special double meaning; though it was intended to refer only to the historic bullfighting region in Spain, Ferruccio was concerned about confusion with the also historic Jarama motor racing track.\nAfter christening the Urraco after a bull breed, in 1974, Lamborghini broke from tradition, naming the Countach ( ) not for a bull, but for (), a Piedmontese expletive. Legend has it that Nuccio Bertone uttered the word in surprise when he first saw the Countach prototype, \"Project 112\". The LM002 (LM for Lamborghini Militaire) sport utility vehicle and the Silhouette (named after the popular racing category of the time) were other exceptions to the tradition.\nThe Jalpa of 1982 was named for a bull breed; Diablo, for the Duke of Veragua's ferocious bull famous for fighting an epic battle against El Chicorro in Madrid in 1869; Murci\u00e9lago, the legendary bull whose life was spared by El Lagartijo for his performance in 1879; Gallardo, named for one of the five ancestral castes of the Spanish fighting bull breed; and Revent\u00f3n, the bull that defeated young Mexican \"torero\" F\u00e9lix Guzm\u00e1n in 1943. The Estoque concept of 2008 was named for the estoc, the sword traditionally used by matadors during bullfights.\nConcept vehicles.\nThroughout its history, Lamborghini has envisioned and presented a variety of concept cars, beginning in 1963 with the first Lamborghini prototype, the 350GTV. Other famous models include Bertone's 1967 Marzal, 1974 Bravo, and 1980 Athon, Chrysler's 1987 Portofino, the Italdesign-styled Cala from 1995, the Zagato-built Raptor from 1996.\nA retro-styled Lamborghini Miura concept car, the first creation of chief designer Walter de'Silva, was presented in 2006. President and CEO Stephan Winkelmann denied that the concept would be put into production, saying that the Miura concept was \"a celebration of our history, but Lamborghini is about the future. Retro design is not what we are here for. So we won't do the [new] Miura.\"\nAt the 2008 Paris Motor Show, Lamborghini revealed the Estoque, a four-door sedan concept. Although there had been much speculation regarding the Estoque's eventual production, Lamborghini management has not made a decision regarding production of what might be the first four-door car to roll out of the Sant'Agata factory.\nAt the 2010 Paris Motor Show, Lamborghini unveiled the Sesto Elemento. The concept car is made almost entirely of carbon fibre making it extremely light, with a weight of . The Sesto Elemento shares the same V10 engine found in the Lamborghini Gallardo. Lamborghini hopes to signal a shift in the company's direction from making super cars focused on top speed to producing more agile, track focused cars with the Sesto Elemento. The concept car can reach in 2.5 seconds and can reach a top speed of over .\nAt the 2012 Geneva Motor Show, Lamborghini unveiled the Aventador J\u2014a roofless, windowless version of the Lamborghini Aventador. The Aventador J uses the same 700\u00a0hp engine and seven-speed transmission as the standard Aventador.\nAt the 2012 Beijing Motor Show, Lamborghini unveiled the Urus SUV. This is the first SUV built by Lamborghini since the LM002.\nAs part of the celebration of 50 years of Lamborghini, the company created the Egoista. Egoista is for one person's driving and only one Egoista is to be made.\nAt the 2014 Paris Motor Show, Lamborghini unveiled the Asterion LPI910-4 hybrid concept car. Named after the half-man, half-bull hybrid (Minotaur) of Greek legend, it is the first hybrid Lamborghini in the history of the company. Utilizing the Hurac\u00e1n's 5.2 litre V10 producing , along with one electric motor mounted on the transaxle and an additional two on the front axle, developing an additional . This puts the power at a combined figure of .

In the case, the ICJ ruled that its own temporary court orders were legally binding and that the rights contained in the convention could not be denied by the application of domestic legal procedures.\nOn January 7, 1982, brothers Karl-Heinz LaGrand (1963\u20131999) and Walter Bernhard LaGrand (1962\u20131999) bungled an armed bank robbery in Marana, Arizona, killing 63-year-old Kenneth Hartsock by stabbing him 24 times with a letter opener, and severely injuring 20-year-old Dawn Lopez by stabbing her multiple times. Lopez later said she heard one of the brothers twice say, \"Just make sure he's dead.\" They were subsequently charged and convicted of murder and sentenced to death. The LaGrands also had prior convictions for robbery and burglary, which were used against them during the sentencing phase of their trials.\nBackground.\nOn January 7, 1982, brothers Karl-Heinz LaGrand (1963\u20131999) and Walter Bernhard LaGrand (1962\u20131999) bungled an armed bank robbery in Marana, Arizona, killing 63-year-old Kenneth Hartsock by stabbing him 24 times with a letter opener, and severely injuring 20-year-old Dawn Lopez by stabbing her multiple times. Lopez later said she heard one of the brothers twice say, \"Just make sure he's dead.\" They were subsequently charged and convicted of murder and sentenced to death. The LaGrands also had prior convictions for robbery and burglary, which were used against them during the sentencing phase of their trials.\nThe LaGrands were German nationals, having been born in Germany to a German mother. While they had both lived in the United States since they were four and five, respectively, neither had obtained U.S. citizenship. As foreigners, the LaGrands should have been informed of their right to consular assistance, under the Vienna Convention, from their state of nationality, Germany. However, the Arizona authorities failed to do this. The brothers later contacted Consul William Behrens, head of the German Consulate in Phoenix, on their own accord, having learned of their right to consular assistance. They appealed their sentences and convictions on the grounds that they were not informed of their right to consular assistance, and that with consular assistance they might have been able to mount a better defense. The federal courts rejected their argument on grounds of procedural default, which provides that issues cannot be raised in federal court appeals unless they had first been raised in state courts.\nDiplomatic efforts, including pleas by German Ambassador J\u00fcrgen Chrobog and German Member of Parliament Claudia Roth, and the recommendation of Arizona's clemency board, failed to sway Arizona Governor Jane Dee Hull, who insisted that the executions be carried out. Karl LaGrand was executed on February 24, 1999, by lethal injection. Walter LaGrand was executed March 3, 1999, by lethal gas (upon his request).\nCase.\nGermany initiated legal action in the International Court of Justice against the United States regarding Walter LaGrand. Hours before Walter LaGrand was due to be executed, Germany applied for the Court to grant a provisional court order, requiring the United States to delay the execution of Walter LaGrand, which the court granted.\nGermany then initiated action in the U.S. Supreme Court for enforcement of the provisional order. In its judgment, the U.S. Supreme Court held that it lacked jurisdiction with respect to Germany's complaint against Arizona due to the Eleventh Amendment of the U.S. constitution, which prohibits federal courts from hearing lawsuits of foreign states against a U.S. state. With respect to Germany's case against the United States, it held that the doctrine of procedural default was not incompatible with the Vienna Convention, and that even if procedural default did conflict with the Vienna Convention it had been overruled by later federal law \u2013 the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996, which explicitly legislated the doctrine of procedural default. (Subsequent federal legislation overrides prior self-executing treaty provisions, \"Whitney v. Robertson\", 124 U.S. https:// (1888)).\nThe U.S. Solicitor General sent a letter to the Supreme Court, as part of these proceedings, arguing that provisional measures of the International Court of Justice are not legally binding. The United States Department of State also conveyed the ICJ's provisional measure to the Governor of Arizona without comment. The Arizona clemency board recommended a stay to the governor, on the basis of the pending ICJ case; but the Governor of Arizona, Jane Dee Hull, ignored the recommendation.\nGermany then modified its complaint in the case before the ICJ, alleging furthermore that the U.S. violated international law by failing to implement the provisional measures. In opposition to the German submissions, the United States argued that the Vienna Convention did not grant rights to individuals but only to states; that the convention was meant to be exercised subject to the laws of each state party, which in the case of the United States meant subject to the doctrine of procedural default; and that Germany was seeking to turn the ICJ into an international court of criminal appeal.\nICJ decision.\nOn June 27, 2001, the ICJ, rejecting all of the United States' arguments, ruled in favor of Germany. The ICJ held that the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations of April 24, 1963, granted rights to individuals on the basis of its plain meaning, and that domestic laws could not limit the rights of the accused under the convention, but only specify the means by which those rights were to be exercised. The ICJ also found that its own provisional measures were legally binding.\nThe court also found that the United States violated the Vienna Convention through its application of procedural default. The court was at pains to point out that it was not passing judgment on the doctrine itself, but only its application to cases involving the Vienna Convention.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "18273", "revid": "91088", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18273", "title": "Lotus 1-2-3", "text": "Spreadsheet software\n \nLotus 1-2-3 is a discontinued spreadsheet program from Lotus Software (later part of IBM). It was the first killer application of the IBM PC, was hugely popular in the 1980s, and significantly contributed to the success of IBM PC-compatibles in the business market.\nThe first spreadsheet, VisiCalc, had helped launch the Apple II as one of the earliest personal computers in business use. With IBM's entry into the market, VisiCalc was slow to respond, and when they did, they launched what was essentially a straight port of their existing system despite the greatly expanded hardware capabilities. Lotus's solution was marketed as a three-in-one integrated solution: it handled spreadsheet calculations, database functionality, and graphical charts, hence the name \"1-2-3\", though how much database capability the product actually had was debatable, given the sparse memory left over after launching 1-2-3. It quickly overtook VisiCalc, as well as Multiplan and SuperCalc, the two VisiCalc competitors.\nLotus 1-2-3 was the state-of-the-art spreadsheet and the standard throughout the 1980s and into the early 1990s, part of an unofficial set of three stand-alone office automation products that included dBase and WordPerfect, to build a complete business platform. Lotus Software had their own word processor named Lotus Manuscript, which was to some extent acclaimed in academia, but did not catch the interest of the business, nor the consumer market. With the acceptance of Windows 3.0 in 1990, the market for desktop software grew even more. None of the major spreadsheet developers had seriously considered the graphical user interface (GUI) to supplement their DOS offerings, and so they responded slowly to Microsoft's own GUI-based products Excel and Word. Lotus was surpassed by Microsoft in the early 1990s, and never recovered. IBM purchased Lotus in 1995, and continued to sell Lotus offerings, only officially ending sales in 2013.\nHistory.\nVisiCalc.\nVisiCalc was launched in 1979 on the Apple II and immediately became a bestseller. In contrast to earlier programs, VisiCalc allowed for the easy construction of free-form calculation systems for practically any purpose, limited primarily by the memory and speed of the computer. The application was so compelling that many purchased Apple II computers just to run the program. VisiCalc's runaway success on the Apple led to direct bug-compatible ports to other platforms, including Atari 8-bit computers and the Commodore PET. This included the IBM PC when it launched in 1981, and on this platform it quickly became another bestseller, with an estimated 300,000 sales in the first six months on the market.\nThere were well-known problems with VisiCalc, and several competitors appeared to address some of these issues. One early example was 1980's SuperCalc, which solved the problem of circular references, while a slightly later example was Microsoft Multiplan from 1981, which offered larger sheets and other improvements. However, VisiCalc continued to outsell these and all other competitors.\nBeginnings.\nThe Lotus Development Corporation was founded by Mitchell Kapor, a friend of the developers of VisiCalc who had written software for it. 1-2-3 was originally written by Jonathan Sachs, who had written two spreadsheet programs while working at Concentric Data Systems, Inc.\n\"1-2-3\" symbolizes the software's three modules: spreadsheet, business graphics and database (replacing the originally planned word processor). While Kapor had some programming experience, he felt that his design skills were superior, and he was primarily a marketing guru. His ability to develop his product to appeal to non-technical users was one secret to its rapid success. Unlike many technologists, Kapor relied on focus-group feedback to make his user instructions more user-friendly. For example, in response to the instructions that read \"Remove the protective cover and insert disc into computer\", several focus-group participants tried to tear the stiff plastic envelope from the disc carrier. Kapor's recognition that highly technical instructions needed to be translated to everyday English was a strong reason for the product's popularity.\nLotus spent $1 million for advertising in January and February 1983 in \"The Wall Street Journal\", \"Business Week\", \"Time\", \"Newsweek\" and computer magazines. Lotus 1-2-3 was released on 26 January 1983 and immediately overtook VisiCalc in sales. Unlike Microsoft Multiplan, it stayed very close to the model of VisiCalc, including the \"A1\" letter and number cell notation and slash-menu structure. It was cleanly programmed, relatively bug-free, performant (as it was programmed in x86 assembly language) and wrote directly to video memory rather than using the slow DOS or BIOS text-output functions.\nAmong other novelties that Lotus introduced was a graph maker that could display several forms of graphs (including pie charts, bar graphics and line charts) but required a graphics card. At this early stage, the only video boards available for the PC were IBM's Color Graphics Adapter and Monochrome Display and Printer Adapter, the latter not supporting any graphics. However, because the two video boards used different RAM and port addresses, both could be installed in the same machine, so Lotus took advantage of this by supporting a \"split\" screen mode whereby the user could display the worksheet portion of 1-2-3 on the sharper monochrome video and the graphics on the CGA display.\nThe initial release of 1-2-3 supported only three video setups: CGA, MDA (for which the graph maker was unavailable) or dual-monitor mode. However, a few months later, support was added for Hercules Computer Technology's Hercules Graphics Adapter, which was a clone of the MDA that allowed bitmap mode. The ability to have high-resolution text and graphics capabilities (at the expense of color) proved extremely popular and Lotus 1-2-3 is credited with popularizing the Hercules graphics card.\nSubsequent releases of Lotus 1-2-3 supported more video standards, including EGA, AT&amp;T/Olivetti and VGA. Significantly, support for the PCjr/Tandy modes was never added, and users of those machines were limited to CGA graphics.\nThe early versions of 1-2-3 also included a disk copy protection. While 1-2-3 was hard-disk installable, it required insertion of the original floppy disk when starting the application. This protection scheme was easily cracked and posed a minor inconvenience for home users, but it proved to be a serious nuisance in an office setting. Lotus discontinued the copy protection with the 3.0 release. However, it was necessary to initialize the system disk with the user's name and company name in order to customize the copy of the program. Release 2.2 and higher had this requirement. This was an irreversible process unless an exact copy of the original disk had been made, posing challenges for the transfer of program ownership.\nThe reliance on the specific hardware of the IBM PC led to 1-2-3 being utilized as one of the two stress-test applications, along with Microsoft Flight Simulator, for true 100% compatibility when PC clones appeared in the early 1980s. 1-2-3 required two disk drives and at least 192K of memory, which made it incompatible with the IBM PCjr; Lotus produced a version for the PCjr that was on two cartridges but otherwise identical.\nBy early 1984, up to 23,000 copies of 1-2-3 were sold monthly. Despite Lotus including high-quality tutorial software, two dozen companies produced books, videocassettes, and other training tools for the spreadsheet. 1-2-3 was a killer app for the IBM PC and compatibles, while hurting sales of computers that could not run it. \"They're looking for 1-2-3. Boy, are they looking for 1-2-3!\" \"InfoWorld\" wrote. Noting that computer purchasers did not want PC compatibility as much as compatibility with certain PC software, the magazine suggested \"let's tell it like it is. Let's not say 'PC compatible,' or even 'MS-DOS compatible.' Instead, let's say '1-2-3 compatible.'\" PC clones' advertising did often prominently state that they were compatible with 1-2-3. An Apple II software company promised that its spreadsheet had \"the power of 1-2-3\". 1-2-3's macro system was the world's most popular application-development language. Because spreadsheets use large amounts of memory, 1\u20102\u20103 helped popularize greater RAM capacities in PCs, and especially the advent of expanded memory, which allowed greater than 640k to be accessed.\nRivals.\nBy 1988 1-2-3 had dominated the spreadsheet market for five years. Lotus had sold 3.5 million copies, and up to eight million people used the software. Competitors emerged, notably Microsoft's Excel and Borland's Quattro Pro.\nThe first 1-2-3 imitator was Mosaic Software's \"The Twin\", written in the fall of 1985 largely in the C programming language, followed by VP-Planner, which was backed by Adam Osborne. These were able to not only read 1-2-3 files, but also execute many or most macro programs by incorporating the same command structure. Copyright law had first been understood to only cover the source code of a program. After the success of lawsuits which claimed that the very \"look and feel\" of a program were covered, Lotus sought to ban any program which had a compatible command and menu structure. Program commands had not been considered to be covered before, but the commands of 1-2-3 were embedded in the words of the menu displayed on the screen. 1-2-3 won its three-year long court battle against Paperback Software International and Mosaic Software Inc. in 1990. However, when it sued Borland over Quattro Pro in \"Lotus v. Borland\", a six-year battle that ended at the Supreme Court in 1996, the final ruling appeared to support narrowing the applicability of copyright law to software; this is because the lower court's decision that it was not a copyright violation to merely have a compatible command menu or language was upheld, but only via stalemate. In 1995, the First Circuit found that command menus are an uncopyrightable \"method of operation\" under section 102(b) of the Copyright Act. The 1-2-3 menu structure (example, slash File Erase) was itself an advanced version of single letter menus introduced in VisiCalc. When the case came before the Supreme Court, the justices would end up deadlocked 4\u20134. This meant that Borland had emerged victorious, but the extent to which copyright law would be applicable to computer software went unaddressed and undefined.\nDecline.\nA 1990 member survey by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants found that 62% of spreadsheet users used 1-2-3, with 93% recommending it to others. 1-2-3 was also the most popular database at 25% of respondents, ahead of Ashton-Tate's dBase at 16%, as well as the most popular graphics and staff scheduling tools. By 1991 Lotus 1-2-3 version 2.2 still dominated the spreadsheet market, with sales more than twice that of rivals with more features. Microsoft and Borland's products lacked Lotus's ecosystem of hundreds of third-party add-ins, consultants, trainers, and books. Even Lotus could not persuade most customers or add-on developers to move to 1-2-3 version 3, or 1-2-3/G, because of their need for more hardware, mutual incompatibility, and lack of compelling new features.\nExcel debuted on the Macintosh in 1985. It arrived on PCs with the release of Windows 2.x in 1987, but as Windows was not yet popular, it posed no serious threat to Lotus's stranglehold on spreadsheet sales. However, Lotus suffered technical setbacks in this period. Version 3 of Lotus 1-2-3, fully converted from its original macro assembler to the more portable C language, was delayed by more than a year as the totally new 1-2-3 had to be made portable across platforms and fully compatible with existing macro sets and file formats. The inability to fit the larger code size of compiled C into lower-powered machines forced the company to split its spreadsheet offerings, with 1-2-3 release 3 only for higher-end machines, and a new version 2.2, based on the 2.01 assembler code base, available for PCs without extended memory. By the time these versions were released in 1989, Microsoft had eroded much of Lotus's market share. During the early 1990s, Windows grew in popularity, and along with it, Excel, which gradually displaced Lotus from its leading position. A planned total revamp of 1-2-3 for Windows fell apart, and all that the company could manage was a Windows adaptation of their existing spreadsheet with no changes except using a graphical interface. Additionally, several versions of 1-2-3 had different features and slightly different interfaces.\nLotus 1-2-3's intended successor, Lotus Symphony, was Lotus's entry into the anticipated \"integrated software\" market. It intended to expand the rudimentary all-in-one 1-2-3 into a fully-fledged spreadsheet, graph, database and word processor for DOS, but none of the integrated packages ever really succeeded. Lotus 1-2-3 migrated to the Windows platform, as part of Lotus SmartSuite.\nIBM's continued development and marketing of Lotus SmartSuite and OS/2 during the 1990s placed it in direct competition with Microsoft Office and Microsoft Windows, respectively. As a result, Microsoft \"punished the IBM PC Company with higher prices, a late license for Windows 95, and the withholding of technical and marketing support.\" Microsoft did not grant IBM the OEM rights for Windows 95 until 15 minutes prior to the release of Windows 95 on 24 August 1995. Because of this uncertainty, IBM machines were sold without Windows 95, while Compaq, HP, and other companies sold machines with Windows 95 from day one.\nOn 11 June 2013, IBM announced it would withdraw the Lotus brand: IBM Lotus 1-2-3 Millennium Edition V9.x, IBM Lotus SmartSuite 9.x V9.8.0, and Organizer V6.1.0. IBM stated, \"Customers will no longer be able to receive support for these offerings after 30 September 2014. No service extensions will be offered. There will be no replacement programs.\"\nUser features.\nThe name \"1-2-3\" stemmed from the product's integration of three main capabilities: along with its core spreadsheet functionality, 1-2-3 also offered integral charting/graphing and rudimentary database operations.\nData features included sorting data in any defined rectangle, by order of information in one or two columns in the rectangular area. Justifying text in a range into paragraphs allowed it to be used as a primitive word processor.\nIt had keyboard-driven pop-up menus as well as one-key commands, making it fast to operate. It was also user-friendly, introducing an early instance of context-sensitive help accessed by the F1 key.\nMacros in version one and add-ins (introduced in version 2.0) contributed much to 1-2-3's popularity, allowing dozens of outside vendors to sell macro packages and add-ins ranging from dedicated financial worksheets like F9 to full-fledged word processors. In the single-tasking MS-DOS, 1-2-3 was sometimes used as a complete office suite. All major graphics standards were supported; initially CGA and Hercules, and later EGA, AT&amp;T, and VGA. Early versions used the filename extension \"WKS\". In version 2.0, the extension changed first to \"WK1\", then \"WK2\". This later became \"WK3\" for version 3.0 and \"WK4\" for version 4.0.\nVersion 2 introduced macros with syntax and commands similar in complexity to an advanced BASIC interpreter, as well as string variable expressions. Later versions supported multiple worksheets and were written in C. The charting/graphing routines were written in Forth by Jeremy Sagan (son of Carl Sagan) and the printing routines by Paul Funk (founder of Funk Software).\nLotus Impress, later called WYSIWYG, was an add-on to Lotus 1-2-3 produced in the early 1990s by Lotus Software. After loading WYSIWYG loads the familiar slash (/) command menu and an additional graphical menu set control all spreadsheet operations, providing access to all 1-2-3's functions, commands, and features.\nPC version history.\nDOS.\nReal Mode (8088+).\nThese editions of 1-2-3 for DOS were primarily written in x86 assembly language.\nProtected Mode (80286+).\nThese editions of 1-2-3 for DOS were primarily written in C.\nFile formats.\nLotus 1-2-3 file formats use various filename extensions including 123, wks, wk1, wk2, wk3, wk4, some of these may open in the desktop applications of Collabora Online, LibreOffice and Apache OpenOffice, these can then be saved into the OpenDocument format or other file formats.\nReception.\nAfter previewing \"1-2-3\" on the IBM PC in 1982, \"BYTE\" called it \"modestly revolutionary\" for elegantly combining spreadsheet, database, and graphing functions. It praised the application's speed and ease of use, stating that with the built-in help screens and tutorial, \"1-2-3 is one of the few pieces of software that can literally be used by anybody. You can buy 1-2-3 and [an IBM PC] and be running the two together the same day\". \"PC Magazine\" in 1983 called 1-2-3 \"a powerful and impressive program ... as a spreadsheet, it's excellent\", and attributed its very fast performance to being written in assembly language. \"Compute!\" said in 1991 that \"you will hardly recognize\" release 3.1 for DOS's WYSIWYG appearance. Favorably citing the new interface, 3-D functionality, and ability to use both extended and expanded memory, the magazine said that the software's price 25% higher than that of other spreadsheets \"buys features not offered by the competition\". While noting that Excel and Quattro Pro would likely respond, \"Compute!\" concluded that its new features \"entitle Lotus to wear the winner's crown\".\nBugs.\nLotus 1-2-3 assumes that 1900 is a leap year. This is incorrect, for while 1900 is a year that is divisible by four, years divisible by 100 are not counted as leap years, unless divisible by 400. This bug persists today as its competitor, Microsoft Excel, still incorporates the bug to ensure compatibility with legacy Lotus 1-2-3 spreadsheets.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It follows one day after the Remembrance of the Dead (\"Dodenherdenking\") on 4 May. The end of the war is instead marked by National Remembrance on 15 August.\nAfter liberation in 1945, Liberation Day was celebrated every five years. In 1990 the day was declared a national holiday when liberation would be remembered and celebrated every year. Liberation Day replaced Waterloo Day. Festivals are held in most places in the Netherlands with parades of veterans and musical festivals throughout the whole country on Liberation Day.\nBackground.\nThe Netherlands was occupied by Germany and ruled under a civilian regime (Reichskommissariat Niederlande) beginning in 1940 during World War II. On 4 May 1945, German Admiral von Friedeburg surrendered in L\u00fcneburg on behalf of the German troops in northwest Germany, the Netherlands, Schleswig-Holstein, and Denmark to British Field Marshal Montgomery. The Netherlands was liberated by Canadian forces, British infantry divisions, the British I Corps, the 1st Polish Armoured Division, American, Belgian, Dutch and Czechoslovak troops. Parts of the country, in particular the south-east, were liberated by the British Second Army which included American and Polish airborne forces (see Operation Market Garden) and French airbornes (see Operation Amherst). On 5 May 1945, at Hotel de Wereld in Wageningen, I Canadian Corps commander Lieutenant-General Charles Foulkes and \"Oberbefehlshaber Niederlande\" commander-in-chief \"Generaloberst\" Johannes Blaskowitz reached an agreement on the capitulation of all German forces in the Netherlands in the presence of Prince Bernhard, commander of the Dutch Interior Forces (Bernhard himself was German and a former Nazi Party member). The capitulation document was signed the next day in the auditorium of Wageningen University, located next door.\nNational Day.\nThe liberation from the German and Japanese occupiers in 1945 was first celebrated on 31 August 1945, when it was still Queen's Day. Queen Wilhelmina did not want this celebration on her birthday, so May 5th, the day of the surrender negotiations, came into play. In 1946, the government decided that Liberation Day should take place on May 5th, unless it fell on a Sunday, because otherwise the tradition of Christian Sunday rest would be disrupted. In 1968, it was decided that Liberation Day would take place on May 5th, regardless of the day of the week.\nFrom 1958 onward, Liberation Day was celebrated only every five years. The various successive committees failed to establish a national tradition, unlike the National Remembrance Day. In 1990, May 5th was declared a national holiday, on which the liberation of the Netherlands from German occupation in 1945 is commemorated and celebrated annually. This does not automatically mean that May 5th is a day off. The Dutch government has determined that employees and employers in the private sector should make their own arrangements.\nDutch East Indies.\nIn the Dutch East Indies, there was no Liberation Day and remains so. Although the Dutch East Indies was liberated by the Japanese surrender on 15 August 1945, there was no reason for celebration for a free Indonesia because of the war of independence that started immediately. Instead, there is the National Remembrance, which only came into effect in 1999. Today the Kingdom of the Netherlands recognizes 15 August 1945 as the end of World War II and also the independence of Indonesia from the Netherlands.\nCelebrations.\nActivities are organized throughout the country; each city and town has its own program of activities, including many music festivals. The Liberation Day celebrations begin each year in a different province.\nFire.\nOn the night of May 4th to 5th, the mayor of Wageningen lights a fire in front of the historic Hotel de Wereld during a ceremony broadcast live on TV. From this historic location, walking groups will depart across the country to spread the flames. This is an important moment for the Netherlands as it transitions from commemorating on May 4th to celebrating liberation on May 5th. The Prime Minister traditionally lights the fire, officially kicking off the liberation festivities.\nLecture.\nSince 1995, an inspirational lecture has been given almost every year on the day. The first one was given by Queen Beatrix.\nFestival.\nThe Liberation Day celebration festivals on May 5th take place in fourteen provincial cities. These include major festivals such as the Liberation Event in Wageningen, which includes the Gelderland Liberation Festival, Bevrijdingspop in Haarlemmerhout, and the Overijssel Liberation Festival in Zwolle.\nVeterans.\nUntil 2004, the annual veterans' parade was held in Wageningen in the presence of Prince Bernhard. After Prince Bernhard's death, the parade was changed to the Liberation Parade on May 5th in Wageningen and the annual National Veterans Day in June in The Hague.\nConcerts.\nLiberation Day concludes with the televised May 5th concert in Amsterdam, in the presence of the King and Queen. A different orchestra performs this concert each year, performed on a stage on the water in front of the Royal Theater Carr\u00e9 on the Amstel River. The concert always concludes with Vera Lynn's \"We'll Meet Again,\" with the King and Queen sailing away in a boat.\nFlags.\nThe Dutch flag flies at its highest point on May 5th from sunrise to sunset, without an orange pennant (wimpel). A special pennant is available for use on Liberation Day. The pennant may also be used on August 15th, which marks the end of World War II in the former Dutch East Indies.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
