{"id": "12514", "revid": "41798114", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=12514", "title": "Ghost", "text": "Supernatural being originating in folklore\nIn folklore, a ghost is the soul or spirit of a dead person or non-human animal that is believed by some people to be able to appear to the living. In ghostlore, descriptions of ghosts vary widely, from an invisible presence to translucent or barely visible wispy shapes to realistic, lifelike forms. The deliberate attempt to contact the spirit of a deceased person is known as necromancy, or in spiritism as a \"s\u00e9ance\". Other terms associated with it are apparition, haunt, haint, phantom, poltergeist, shade, specter, spirit, spook, wraith, demon, and ghoul.\nThe belief in the existence of an afterlife, as well as manifestations of the spirits of the dead, is widespread, dating back to animism or ancestor worship in pre-literate cultures. Certain religious practices\u2014funeral rites, exorcisms, and some practices of spiritualism and ritual magic\u2014are specifically designed to rest the spirits of the dead. Ghosts are generally described as solitary, human-like essences, though stories of ghostly armies and the ghosts of animals other than humans have also been recounted. They are believed to haunt particular locations, objects, or people they were associated with in life. According to a 2009 study by the Pew Research Center, 18% of Americans say they have seen a ghost.\nThe overwhelming consensus of science is that there is no proof that ghosts exist. Their existence is impossible to falsify, and ghost hunting has been classified as pseudoscience. Despite centuries of investigation, there is no scientific evidence that any location is inhabited by the spirits of the dead. Historically, certain toxic and psychoactive plants (such as \"datura\" and \"hyoscyamus niger\"), whose use has long been associated with necromancy and the underworld, have been shown to contain anticholinergic compounds that are pharmacologically linked to dementia (specifically DLB) as well as histological patterns of neurodegeneration. Recent research has indicated that ghost sightings may be related to degenerative brain diseases such as Alzheimer's disease. Common prescription medication and over-the-counter drugs (such as sleep aids) may also, in rare instances, cause ghost-like hallucinations, particularly zolpidem and diphenhydramine. Older reports linked carbon monoxide poisoning to ghost-like hallucinations.\nIn folklore studies, ghosts fall within the motif index designation E200\u2013E599 (\"Ghosts and other revenants\").\nTerminology.\nEtymology.\nThe English word \"ghost\" comes from Old English \"g\u0101st\" (\"breath, spirit, soul, ghost\"), which can be traced back to Proto-Germanic \"*gaistaz\" (\"spirit, ghost\"). It is cognate (linguistic sibling from a common origin) with Old Frisian \"g\u0101st\" (\"spirit, ghost, demon\"), Old Saxon \"g\u0113st\" (\"soul, vitality, spirit, demon\"), Old Dutch \"g\u0113st\" (\"spirit\"), and Old High German (\"spirit\")\".\" Although recorded descendants do not appear in North and East Germanic sources (where Gothic uses \"ahma\" and Old Norse uses m. or f.), linguists reconstruct \"*gaistaz\" as stemming from pre-Germanic *\"ghois-t-oz\" (\"fury, anger\"). This reconstruction is supported by its connection to Sanskrit \"h\u012b\u1e0d-\" (\"to be angry\") and \"h\u00e9\u1e0da\" (\"anger\"), and to Avestan \"z\u014di\u017eda-\" (\"terrible\"; in \"z\u014di\u017edi\u0161ta\" \"most terrible\").\nThe common Proto-Indo-European form is posited as *\"\u01f5\u02b0oys-d-os\", a dental suffix derivative of the root \"\u01f5\u02b0\u00e9ys-\". This root also appears Proto-Germanic \"*gaistjan\" (\"to terrify\"; compare Old English \"g\u01fdstan\" and Gothic \"usgaisjan\"), in Old Norse *\"geiski\" (\"fear\"; implied in \"geiskafullr\", \"full of fear\"), and in Avestan \"z\u014di\u0161-\" (in \"z\u014di\u0161nu\", \"shivering, trembling\").\nBesides denoting a \"person's spirit or soul\" (as \"the life force\" or \"breath of life\" that gives life to the body, in contrast to its purely material being), the Old English word is also used as a synonym of Latin \"sp\u012britus\" in the meaning of \"the breath of God or a god\" from the earliest attestations (9th century). It could also denote any good or evil spirit, such as angels and demons (the Anglo-Saxon gospel refers to the demonic possession of Matthew 12:43 as \"se uncl\u00e6na gast\"). Also from the Old English period, the word could denote the spirit of God, the \"Holy Ghost\" (\"halgan gaste\"), after post-classical Latin \"spiritus sanctus\" .\nUsage and synonyms.\nThe now-prevailing sense of \"the soul of a deceased person, spoken of as appearing in a visible form\" only emerges in Middle English (14th century). The modern noun does, however, retain a wider field of application, extending on one hand to \"soul\", \"spirit\", \"vital principle\", \"mind\", or \"psyche\", the seat of feeling, thought, and moral judgement; on the other hand used figuratively of any shadowy outline, or fuzzy or unsubstantial image; in optics, photography, and cinematography especially, a flare, secondary image, or spurious signal.\nThe synonym \"spook\" is a Dutch loanword, akin to Low German (of uncertain etymology); it entered the English language via American English in the 19th century. Alternative words in modern usage include \"spectre\" (altn. \"specter\"; from Latin ), the Scottish \"wraith\" (of obscure origin), \"phantom\" (via French ultimately from Greek \"phantasma\", compare \"fantasy\") and \"apparition\". The term \"shade\" in classical mythology translates Greek \u03c3\u03ba\u03b9\u03ac, or Latin , in reference to the notion of spirits in the Greek underworld. The term \"poltergeist\" is a German word, literally a \"noisy ghost\", for a spirit said to manifest itself by invisibly moving and influencing objects.\n\"Wraith\" is a Scots word for \"ghost\", \"spectre\", or \"apparition\". It appeared in Scottish Romanticist literature, and acquired the more general or figurative sense of \"portent\" or \"omen\". In 18th- to 19th-century Scottish literature, it also applied to aquatic spirits. The word has no commonly accepted etymology; the \"OED\" notes \"of obscure origin\" only. An association with the verb \"writhe\" was the etymology favored by J. R. R. Tolkien. Tolkien's use of the word in the naming of the creatures known as the Ringwraiths has influenced later usage in fantasy literature. Bogey or \"bogy/bogie\" is a term for a ghost, and appears in Scottish poet John Mayne's \"Hallowe'en\" in 1780.\nA \"revenant\" is a deceased person returning from the dead to haunt the living, either as a disembodied ghost or alternatively as an animated (\"undead\") corpse. Also related is the concept of a fetch, the visible ghost or spirit of a person yet alive.\nTypology.\nAnthropological context.\nA notion of the transcendent, supernatural, or numinous, usually involving entities like ghosts, demons, or deities, is a cultural universal. In pre-literate folk religions, these beliefs are often summarized under animism and ancestor worship. Some people believe the ghost or spirit never leaves Earth until there is no-one left to remember the one who died.\nIn many cultures, malignant, restless ghosts are distinguished from the more benign spirits involved in ancestor worship.\nAncestor worship typically involves rites intended to prevent revenants, vengeful spirits of the dead, imagined as starving and envious of the living. Strategies for preventing revenants may either include sacrifice; that is, giving the dead food and drink to pacify them, or magical banishment of the deceased to force them not to return. Ritual feeding of the dead is performed in traditions like the Chinese Ghost Festival or the Western All Souls' Day. Magical banishment of the dead is present in many of the world's burial customs. The bodies found in many tumuli (kurgan) had been ritually bound before burial, and the custom of binding the dead persists, for example, in rural Anatolia.\nNineteenth-century anthropologist James Frazer stated in his classic work \"The Golden Bough\" that souls were seen as the creature within that animated the body.\nGhosts and the afterlife.\nAlthough the human soul was sometimes symbolically or literally depicted in ancient cultures as a bird or other animal, it appears to have been widely held that the soul was an exact reproduction of the body in every feature, even down to clothing the person wore. This is depicted in artwork from various ancient cultures, including such works as the Egyptian \"Book of the Dead\", which shows deceased people in the afterlife appearing much as they did before death, including the style of dress.\nFear of ghosts.\nWhile deceased ancestors are universally regarded as venerable, and often believed to have a continued presence in some form of afterlife, the spirit of a deceased person that persists in the material world (a ghost) is regarded as an unnatural or undesirable state of affairs and the idea of ghosts or revenants is associated with a reaction of fear. This is universally the case in pre-modern folk cultures, but fear of ghosts also remains an integral aspect of the modern ghost story, Gothic horror, and other horror fiction dealing with the supernatural.\nCommon attributes.\nAnother widespread belief concerning ghosts is that they are composed of a misty, airy, or subtle material. Anthropologists link this idea to early beliefs that ghosts were the person within the person (the person's spirit), most noticeable in ancient cultures as a person's breath, which upon exhaling in colder climates appears visibly as a white mist. This belief may have also fostered the metaphorical meaning of \"breath\" in certain languages, such as the Latin \"spiritus\" and the Greek \"pneuma\", which by analogy became extended to mean the soul. In the Bible, God is depicted as synthesising Adam, as a living soul, from the dust of the Earth and the breath of God.\nIn many traditional accounts, ghosts were often thought to be deceased people looking for vengeance (vengeful ghosts), or imprisoned on earth for bad things they did during life. The appearance of a ghost has often been regarded as an omen or portent of death. Seeing one's own ghostly double or \"fetch\" is a related omen of death. The impetus of haunting is commonly considered an unnatural death.\nWhite ladies were reported to appear in many rural areas, and supposed to have died tragically or suffered trauma in life. White Lady legends are found around the world. Common to many of them is the theme of losing a child or husband and a sense of purity, as opposed to the Lady in Red ghost that is mostly attributed to a jilted lover or prostitute. The White Lady ghost is often associated with an individual family line or regarded as a harbinger of death similar to a banshee.\nLegends of ghost ships have existed since the 18th century; most notable of these is the \"Flying Dutchman\". This theme has been used in literature in \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner\" by Samuel Taylor Coleridge.\nGhosts are often depicted as being covered in a shroud and/or dragging chains.\nLocale.\nA place where ghosts are reported is described as haunted, and often seen as being inhabited by spirits of deceased who may have been former residents or were familiar with the property. Supernatural activity inside homes is said to be mainly associated with violent or tragic events in the building's past such as murder, accidental death, or suicide\u2014sometimes in the recent or ancient past. However, not all hauntings are at a place of a violent death, or even on violent grounds. Many cultures and religions believe the essence of a being, such as the \"soul\", continues to exist. Some religious views argue that the \"spirits\" of those who have died have not \"passed over\" and are trapped inside the property where their memories and energy are strong.\nHistory.\nAncient Near East and Egypt.\nThere are many references to ghosts in Mesopotamian religions \u2013 the religions of Sumer, Babylon, Assyria, and other early states in Mesopotamia. Traces of these beliefs survive in the later Abrahamic religions that came to dominate the region. The concept of ghosts may predate many belief systems. Ghosts were thought to be created at time of death, taking on the memory and personality of the dead person. They traveled to the netherworld, where they were assigned a position, and led an existence similar in some ways to that of the living.\nRelatives of the dead were expected to make offerings of food and drink to the dead to ease their conditions. If they did not, the ghosts could inflict misfortune and illness on the living. Traditional healing practices ascribed a variety of illnesses to the action of ghosts, while others were caused by gods or demons.\nThere was widespread belief in ghosts in ancient Egyptian culture.\nThe Hebrew Bible contains few references to ghosts, associating spiritism with forbidden occult activities cf. Deuteronomy 18:11. The most notable reference is in the First Book of Samuel (I Samuel 28:3\u201319 KJV), in which a disguised King Saul has the Witch of Endor summon the spirit or ghost of Samuel.\nThe soul and spirit were believed to exist after death, with the ability to assist or harm the living, and the possibility of a second death. Over a period of more than 2,500 years, Egyptian beliefs about the nature of the afterlife evolved constantly. Many of these beliefs were recorded in hieroglyph inscriptions, papyrus scrolls and tomb paintings. The Egyptian \"Book of the Dead\" compiles some of the beliefs from different periods of ancient Egyptian history.\nIn modern times, the fanciful concept of a mummy coming back to life and wreaking vengeance when disturbed has spawned a whole genre of horror stories and films.\nClassical Antiquity.\nArchaic and Classical Greece.\nGhosts appeared in Homer's \"Odyssey\" and \"Iliad\", in which they were described as vanishing \"as a vapor, gibbering and whining into the earth\". Homer's ghosts had little interaction with the world of the living. Periodically they were called upon to provide advice or prophecy, but they do not appear to be particularly feared. Ghosts in the classical world often appeared in the form of vapor or smoke, but at other times they were described as being substantial, appearing as they had been at the time of death, complete with the wounds that killed them.\nBy the 5th century BC, classical Greek ghosts had become haunting, frightening creatures who could work to either good or evil purposes. The spirit of the dead was believed to hover near the resting place of the corpse, and cemeteries were places the living avoided. The dead were to be ritually mourned through public ceremony, sacrifice, and libations, or else they might return to haunt their families. The ancient Greeks held annual feasts to honor and placate the spirits of the dead, to which the family ghosts were invited, and after which they were \"firmly invited to leave until the same time next year.\"\nThe 5th-century BC play \"Oresteia\" includes an appearance of the ghost of Clytemnestra, one of the first ghosts to appear in a work of fiction.\nRoman Empire and Late Antiquity.\nThe ancient Romans believed a ghost could be used to exact revenge on an enemy by scratching a curse on a piece of lead or pottery and placing it into a grave.\nPlutarch, in the 1st century AD, described the haunting of the baths at Chaeronea by the ghost of a murdered man. The ghost's loud and frightful groans caused the people of the town to seal up the doors of the building. Another celebrated account of a haunted house from the ancient classical world is given by Pliny the Younger (c.\u200950 AD). Pliny describes the haunting of a house in Athens, which was bought by the Stoic philosopher Athenodorus, who lived about 100 years before Pliny. Knowing that the house was supposedly haunted, Athenodorus intentionally set up his writing desk in the room where the apparition was said to appear and sat there writing until late at night when he was disturbed by a ghost bound in chains. He followed the ghost outside where it indicated a spot on the ground. When Athenodorus later excavated the area, a shackled skeleton was unearthed. The haunting ceased when the skeleton was given a proper reburial. The writers Plautus and Lucian also wrote stories about haunted houses.\nIn the New Testament, according to Luke 24:37\u201339, following his resurrection, Jesus was forced to persuade the Disciples that he was not a ghost (some versions of the Bible, such as the KJV and NKJV, use the term \"spirit\"). Similarly, Jesus' followers at first believed he was a ghost (spirit) when they saw him walking on water.\nOne of the first persons to express disbelief in ghosts was Lucian of Samosata in the 2nd century AD. In his satirical novel \"The Lover of Lies\" (c. 150 AD), he relates how Democritus \"the learned man from Abdera in Thrace\" lived in a tomb outside the city gates to prove that cemeteries were not haunted by the spirits of the departed. Lucian relates how he persisted in his disbelief despite practical jokes perpetrated by \"some young men of Abdera\" who dressed up in black robes with skull masks to frighten him. This account by Lucian notes something about the popular classical expectation of how a ghost should look.\nIn the 5th century AD, the Christian priest Constantius of Lyon recorded an instance of the recurring theme of the improperly buried dead who come back to haunt the living, and who can only cease their haunting when their bones have been discovered and properly reburied.\nMiddle Ages.\nGhosts reported in medieval Europe tended to fall into two categories: the souls of the dead, or demons. The souls of the dead returned for a specific purpose. Demonic ghosts existed only to torment or tempt the living. The living could tell them apart by demanding their purpose in the name of Jesus Christ. The soul of a dead person would divulge its mission, while a demonic ghost would be banished at the sound of the Holy Name.\nMost ghosts were souls assigned to Purgatory, condemned for a specific period to atone for their transgressions in life. Their penance was generally related to their sin. For example, the ghost of a man who had been abusive to his servants was condemned to tear off and swallow bits of his own tongue; the ghost of another man, who had neglected to leave his cloak to the poor, was condemned to wear the cloak, now \"heavy as a church tower\". These ghosts appeared to the living to ask for prayers to end their suffering. Other dead souls returned to urge the living to confess their sins before their own deaths.\nMedieval European ghosts were more substantial than ghosts described in the Victorian age, and there are accounts of ghosts being wrestled with and physically restrained until a priest could arrive to hear its confession. Some were less solid, and could move through walls. Often they were described as paler and sadder versions of the person they had been while alive, and dressed in tattered gray rags. The vast majority of reported sightings were male.\nThere were some reported cases of ghostly armies, fighting battles at night in the forest, or in the remains of an Iron Age hillfort, as at Wandlebury, near Cambridge, England. Living knights were sometimes challenged to single combat by phantom knights, which vanished when defeated.\nFrom the medieval period an apparition of a ghost is recorded from 1211, at the time of the Albigensian Crusade. Gervase of Tilbury, Marshal of Arles, wrote that the image of Guilhem, a boy recently murdered in the forest, appeared in his cousin's home in Beaucaire, near Avignon. This series of \"visits\" lasted all of the summer. Through his cousin, who spoke for him, the boy allegedly held conversations with anyone who wished, until the local priest requested to speak to the boy directly, leading to an extended disquisition on theology. The boy narrated the trauma of death and the unhappiness of his fellow souls in Purgatory, and reported that God was most pleased with the ongoing Crusade against the Cathar heretics, launched three years earlier. The time of the Albigensian Crusade in southern France was marked by intense and prolonged warfare, this constant bloodshed and dislocation of populations being the context for these reported visits by the murdered boy.\nHaunted houses are featured in the 9th-century \"Arabian Nights\" (such as the tale of \"Ali the Cairene and the Haunted House in Baghdad\").\nEuropean Renaissance to Romanticism.\nRenaissance magic took a revived interest in the occult, including necromancy. In the era of the Reformation and Counter Reformation, there was frequently a backlash against unwholesome interest in the dark arts, typified by writers such as Thomas Erastus. The Swiss Reformed pastor Ludwig Lavater supplied one of the most frequently reprinted books of the period with his \"Of Ghosts and Spirits Walking By Night.\"\nThe Child Ballad \"Sweet William's Ghost\" (1868) recounts the story of a ghost returning to his fianc\u00e9e begging her to free him from his promise to marry her. He cannot marry her because he is dead but her refusal would mean his damnation. This reflects a popular British belief that the dead haunted their lovers if they took up with a new love without some formal release. \"The Unquiet Grave\" expresses a belief even more widespread, found in various locations over Europe: ghosts can stem from the excessive grief of the living, whose mourning interferes with the dead's peaceful rest. In many folktales from around the world, the hero arranges for the burial of a dead man. Soon after, he gains a companion who aids him and, in the end, the hero's companion reveals that he is in fact the dead man. Instances of this include the Italian fairy tale \"Fair Brow\" and the Swedish \"The Bird 'Grip'\".\nModern period of western culture.\nSpiritualist movement.\nSpiritualism is a monotheistic belief system or religion, postulating a belief in God, but with a distinguishing feature of belief that spirits of the dead residing in the spirit world can be contacted by \"mediums\", who can then provide information about the afterlife.\nSpiritualism developed in the United States and reached its peak growth in membership from the 1840s to the 1920s, especially in English-language countries. By 1897, it was said to have more than eight million followers in the United States and Europe, mostly drawn from the middle and upper classes, while the corresponding movement in continental Europe and Latin America is known as Spiritism.\nThe religion flourished for a half century without canonical texts or formal organization, attaining cohesion by periodicals, tours by trance lecturers, camp meetings, and the missionary activities of accomplished mediums. Many prominent Spiritualists were women. Most followers supported causes such as the abolition of slavery and women's suffrage. By the late 1880s, credibility of the informal movement weakened, due to accusations of fraud among mediums, and formal Spiritualist organizations began to appear. Spiritualism is currently practiced primarily through various denominational Spiritualist churches in the United States and United Kingdom.\nSpiritism.\nSpiritism, or French spiritualism, is based on the five books of the Spiritist Codification written by French educator Hypolite L\u00e9on Denizard Rivail under the pseudonym Allan Kardec reporting s\u00e9ances in which he observed a series of phenomena that he attributed to incorporeal intelligence (spirits). His assumption of spirit communication was validated by many contemporaries, among them many scientists and philosophers who attended s\u00e9ances and studied the phenomena. His work was later extended by writers like Leon Denis, Arthur Conan Doyle, Camille Flammarion, Ernesto Bozzano, Chico Xavier, Divaldo Pereira Franco, Waldo Vieira, Johannes Greber, and others.\nSpiritism has adherents in many countries throughout the world, including Spain, United States, Canada, Japan, Germany, France, England, Argentina, Portugal, and especially Brazil, which has the largest proportion and greatest number of followers.\nScientific view.\nThe physician John Ferriar wrote \"An Essay Towards a Theory of Apparitions\" in 1813 in which he argued that sightings of ghosts were the result of optical illusions. Later the French physician Alexandre Jacques Fran\u00e7ois Bri\u00e8re de Boismont published \"On Hallucinations: Or, the Rational History of Apparitions, Dreams, Ecstasy, Magnetism, and Somnambulism\" in 1845 in which he claimed sightings of ghosts were the result of hallucinations.\nDavid Turner, a retired physical chemist, suggested that ball lightning could cause inanimate objects to move erratically.\nJoe Nickell of the Committee for Skeptical Inquiry wrote that there was no credible scientific evidence that any location was inhabited by spirits of the dead. Limitations of human perception and ordinary physical explanations can account for ghost sightings; for example, air pressure changes in a home causing doors to slam, humidity changes causing boards to creak, condensation in electrical connections causing intermittent behavior, or lights from a passing car reflected through a window at night. Pareidolia, an innate tendency to recognize patterns in random perceptions, is what some skeptics believe causes people to believe that they have 'seen ghosts'. Reports of ghosts \"seen out of the corner of the eye\" may be accounted for by the sensitivity of human peripheral vision. According to Nickell, peripheral vision can easily mislead, especially late at night when the brain is tired and more likely to misinterpret sights and sounds. Nickell further states, \"science cannot substantiate the existence of a 'life energy' that could survive death without dissipating or function at all without a brain... why would... clothes survive?'\" He asks, if ghosts glide, then why do people claim to hear them with \"heavy footfalls\"? Nickell says that ghosts act the same way as \"dreams, memories, and imaginings, because they too are mental creations. They are evidence \u2013 not of another world, but of this real and natural one.\"\nBenjamin Radford from the Committee for Skeptical Inquiry and author of the 2017 book \"Investigating Ghosts: The Scientific Search for Spirits\" writes that \"ghost hunting is the world's most popular paranormal pursuit\" yet, to date, ghost hunters cannot agree on what a ghost is, or offer proof that they exist; \"it's all speculation and guesswork\". He writes that it would be \"useful and important to distinguish between types of spirits and apparitions. Until then it's merely a parlor game distracting amateur ghost hunters from the task at hand.\"\nAccording to research in anomalistic psychology visions of ghosts may arise from hypnagogic hallucinations (\"waking dreams\" experienced in the transitional states to and from sleep). In a study of two experiments into alleged hauntings (Wiseman \"et al.\". 2003) came to the conclusion \"that people consistently report unusual experiences in 'haunted' areas because of environmental factors, which may differ across locations.\" Some of these factors included \"the variance of local magnetic fields, size of location and lighting level stimuli of which witnesses may not be consciously aware\".\nSome researchers, such as Michael Persinger of Laurentian University, Canada, have speculated that changes in geomagnetic fields (created, e.g., by tectonic stresses in the Earth's crust or solar activity) could stimulate the brain's temporal lobes and produce many of the experiences associated with hauntings. Sound is thought to be another cause of supposed sightings. Richard Lord and Richard Wiseman have concluded that infrasound can cause humans to experience bizarre feelings in a room, such as anxiety, extreme sorrow, a feeling of being watched, or even the chills. Carbon monoxide poisoning, which can cause changes in perception of the visual and auditory systems, was speculated upon as a possible explanation for haunted houses as early as 1921.\nPeople who experience sleep paralysis often report seeing ghosts during their experiences. Neuroscientists Baland Jalal and V.S. Ramachandran have recently proposed neurological theories for why people hallucinate ghosts during sleep paralysis. Their theories emphasize the role of the parietal lobe and mirror neurons in triggering such ghostly hallucinations.\nBy religion.\nJudaism.\nThe Hebrew Bible contains several references to \"https://\" (), which are in a few places akin to shades of classical mythology but mostly describing mediums in connection with necromancy and spirit-consulting, which are grouped with witchcraft and other forms of divination under the category of forbidden occult activities. The most notable reference to a shade is in the First Book of Samuel, in which a disguised King Saul has the Witch of Endor conduct a seance to summon the dead prophet Samuel. A similar term appearing throughout the scriptures is \"https:// \" (), which while describing the race of \"giants\" formerly inhabiting Canaan in many verses, also refer to (the spirits of) dead ancestors of Sheol (like shades) in many others such as in the Book of Isaiah.\nJewish mythology and folkloric traditions describe \"dybbuks\", malicious possessing spirits believed to be the dislocated soul of a dead person. However, the term does not appear in the Kabbalah or Talmudic literature, where it is rather called an \"unclean spirit\" or (). It supposedly leaves the host body once it has accomplished its goal, sometimes after being helped.\nChristianity.\nIn the New Testament, Jesus has to persuade the Disciples that he is not a ghost following the resurrection, Luke 24:37\u201339 (some versions of the Bible, such as the KJV and NKJV, use the term \"spirit\"). Similarly, Jesus' followers at first believe he is a ghost (spirit) when they see him walking on water.\nSome Christian denominations such as the Roman Catholic Church consider ghosts as beings who while tied to earth, no longer live on the material plane and linger in an intermediate state before continuing their journey to heaven. On occasion, God would allow the souls in this state to return to earth to warn the living of the need for repentance. Christians are taught that it is sinful to attempt to conjure or control spirits in accordance with Deuteronomy XVIII: 9\u201312.\nSome ghosts are actually said to be demons in disguise, who the Church teaches, in accordance with I Timothy 4:1, that they \"come to deceive people and draw them away from God and into bondage.\" As a result, attempts to contact the dead may lead to unwanted contact with a demon or an unclean spirit, as was said to occur in the case of Robbie Mannheim, a fourteen-year-old Maryland youth. The Seventh-Day Adventist view is that a \"soul\" is not equivalent to \"spirit\" or \"ghost\" (depending on the Bible version), and that save for the Holy Spirit, all spirits or ghosts are demons in disguise. Furthermore, they teach that in accordance with (Genesis 2:7, Ecclesiastes 12:7), there are only two components to a \"soul\", neither of which survives death, with each returning to its respective source.\nChristadelphians and Jehovah's Witnesses reject the view of a living, conscious soul after death.\nIslam.\n\"R\u016b\u1e25\" (; plural \"arwah\") is a person's immortal, essential self \u2014 pneuma, i.e. the \"spirit\" or \"soul\". The term is also used for ghosts. The souls of the deceased dwell in barzakh. Only a barrier in Quran, in Islamic tradition this refers to an entire intermediary world between the living and the afterlife. The world, especially cemeteries, are perforated with several gateways to the otherworld or barzakh. In rare occasions, the dead can appear to the living. \nPure souls, such as the souls of saints, are commonly addressed as r\u016b\u1e25, while impure souls seeking for revenge, are often addressed as afarit. An inappropriate burial can also cause a soul to stay in this world, whereupon roaming the earth as a ghost. Other souls are cursed by God to roam the earth restlessly . Since the just souls remain close to their tomb, some people try to communicate with them in order to gain hidden knowledge. Contact with the dead is not the same as contact with jinn, who alike could provide knowledge concealed from living humans. Many encounters with ghosts are related to dreams supposed to occur in the realm of symbols.\nBelief in spirits have not ceased to exist in Muslim belief. Smile of new-born babies is sometimes used as a proof for sighting spirits, like ghosts. However, the connection to the other world fades during life on earth but is resumed after death. Once again, smiling of dying people is considered as evidence for recognizing the spirit of their beloved ones. Yet, Muslims who affirm the existence of ghosts, are carefully when interacting with spirits, as the ghosts of humans can be as bad as the jinn. Worst of all, however, are the devils.\nMuslim authors, like Ghazali, Ibn Qayyim and Suyuti wrote in more details about the life of ghosts. Ibn Qayyim and Suyuti assert, when a soul desires to turn back to earth long enough, it is gradually released from restrictions of Barzakh and able to move freely. Each spirit experiences afterlife in accordance with their deeds and condictions in the earthly life. Evil souls will find the afterlife as painful and punishment, imprisoned until God allows them to interact with other others. Good souls are not restricted. They are free to come visit other souls and even come down to lower regions. The higher planes (\"\u02bfilliyy\u012bn\") are considered to be broader than the lower ones, the lowest being the most narrow (\"sijj\u012bn\"). The spiritual space is not thought as spatial, but reflects the capacity of the spirit. The more pure the spirit gets, the more it is able to interact with other souls and thus reaches a broader degree of freedom.\nThe Ismailite Philosopher Nasir Khusraw conjectured that evil human souls turn into demons, when their bodies die, because of their intense attachment to the bodily world. They were worse than the jinn and fairies, who in turn could become devils, if they pursue evil. A similar thought is recorded by Muhammad ibn Zakariya al-Razi.\nThe ghosts of saints are thought to transmit blessings from God through the heavenly realm to whose who visit their graves. Therefore, visiting the graves of saints and prophets became a major ritual in Muslim spirituality.\nHinduism.\nA bhoota is the ghost of a deceased being in Indian religions. Interpretations of how bhootas come into existence vary by region and community, but they are usually considered to be perturbed and restless due to some factor that prevents them from moving on (to transmigration, non-being, nirvana, or swarga or naraka, depending on tradition). This could be a violent death, unsettled matters in their lives, or simply the failure of their survivors to perform proper funerals. Belief in ghosts has been deeply ingrained in the minds of the people of the subcontinent for generations. There are many allegedly haunted places in the subcontinent, such as cremation grounds, dilapidated buildings, royal mansions, havelis, forts, forest bungalows, burning ghats, etc. Ghosts also occupy a significant place in the Bengali culture. Ghosts and various supernatural entities form an integral part of the socio-cultural beliefs of both the Muslim and Hindu communities of Bangladesh and the Indian state of West Bengal.\nThe Bhutas (singular 'Bhuta'), spirits of deified heroes, of fierce and evil beings, of Hindu deities and of animals, etc., are wrongly referred to as \"ghosts\" or \"demons\" and, in fact, are protective and benevolent beings. Though it is true that they can cause harm in their violent forms, as they are extremely powerful, they can be pacified through worship or offerings referred to as Bhuta Aradhana.\nThe Churel, also spelled as Charail, Churreyl, Chudail, Chudel, Chu\u1e5bail, Cu\u1e0dail or Cu\u1e0del (, ), is a mythical spirit of a woman who died during pregnancy or childbirth, which may be a demoniacal revenant said to occur in South Asia and Southeast Asia, particularly popular in India, Bangladesh, Nepal and Pakistan. The churel is typically described as \"the ghost of an unpurified living thing\", but because she is often said to latch on to trees, she is also called a tree-spirit. According to some legends, a woman who dies during childbirth or pregnancy or from suffering at the hands of her in-laws will come back as a revenant churel for revenge, particularly targeting the males in her family.\nThe churel is mostly described as extremely ugly and hideous but is able to shape-shift and disguise herself as a beautiful woman to lure men into the woods or mountains where she either kills them or sucks up their life-force or virility, turning them into old men. Their feet are believed to be turned the other way around, so the toes face the direction of their back. The churel is called as Pichal Peri in Punjab and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.\nThere are many folk remedies and folkloric sayings that elaborate on how to get rid of revenant, bhoot and churels, and a number measures that supposedly prevent churels from coming to life. The family of a woman who dies a traumatic, tragic, or unnatural death might perform special rituals fearing that the victimised woman might return as a churel. The corpses of suspected churels are also buried in a particular method and posture so as to prevent her from returning.\nBuddhism.\nIn Buddhism, there are a number of planes of existence into which a person can be reborn, one of which is the realm of hungry ghosts. Buddhist celebrate the Ghost Festival as an expression of compassion, one of Buddhist virtues. If the hungry ghosts are fed by non-relatives, they would not bother the community.\nBy culture.\nAfrican folklore.\nFor the Igbo people, a man is simultaneously a physical and spiritual entity. However, it is his spirited dimension that is eternal. In the Akan conception, we witness five parts of the human personality. We have the Nipadua (body), the Okra (soul), Sunsum (spirit), Ntoro (character from father), Mogya (character from mother). The Humr people of southwestern Kordofan, Sudan consume the drink Umm Nyolokh, which is prepared from the liver and bone marrow of giraffes. Richard Rudgley hypothesises that Umm Nyolokh may contain DMT and certain online websites further theorise that giraffe liver might owe its putative psychoactivity to substances derived from psychoactive plants, such as Acacia spp. consumed by the animal. The drink is said to cause hallucinations of giraffes, believed by the Humr to be the ghosts of giraffes.\nEuropean folklore.\nBelief in ghosts in European folklore is characterized by the recurring fear of \"returning\" or \"revenant\" deceased who may harm the living. This includes the Scandinavian \"gjenganger\", the Romanian \"strigoi\", the Serbian \"vampir\", the Greek \"vrykolakas\", etc. In Scandinavian and Finnish tradition, ghosts appear in corporeal form, and their supernatural nature is given away by behavior rather than appearance. In fact, in many stories they are first mistaken for the living. They may be mute, appear and disappear suddenly, or leave no footprints or other traces. British folklore is particularly notable for its numerous haunted locations.\nSouth and Southeast Asia.\nIndian subcontinent.\nA \"bhoot\" or \"bhut\" (, , , , ) is a supernatural creature, usually the ghost of a deceased person, in the popular culture, literature and some ancient texts of the Indian subcontinent.\nNorth India.\nInterpretations of how \"bhoot\"s come into existence vary by region and community, but they are usually considered to be perturbed and restless due to some factor that prevents them from moving on (to transmigration, non-being, nirvana, or heaven or hell, depending on tradition). This could be a violent death, unsettled matters in their lives, or simply the failure of their survivors to perform proper funerals.\nIn Central and Northern India, \"ojha\" or spirit guides play a central role. It duly happens when in the night someone sleeps and decorates something on the wall, and they say that if one sees the spirit the next thing in the morning he will become a spirit too, and that to a headless spirit and the soul of the body will remain the dark with the dark lord from the spirits who reside in the body of every human in Central and Northern India. It is also believed that if someone calls one from behind, never turn back and see because the spirit may catch the human to make it a spirit.\nOther types of spirits in Hindu mythology include Baital, an evil spirit who haunts cemeteries and takes demonic possession of corpses, and Pishacha, a type of flesh-eating demon.\nBengal and East India.\nThere are many kinds of ghosts and similar supernatural entities that frequently come up in Bengali culture, its folklores and form an important part in Bengali peoples' socio-cultural beliefs and superstitions. It is believed that the spirits of those who cannot find peace in the afterlife or die unnatural deaths remain on Earth. The word \"Pret\" (from Sanskrit) is also used in Bengali to mean ghost. In Bengal, ghosts are believed to be the spirit after death of an unsatisfied human being or a soul of a person who dies in unnatural or abnormal circumstances (like murder, suicide or accident). Even it is believed that other animals and creatures can also be turned into ghost after their death.\nThailand.\nGhosts in Thailand are part of local folklore and have now become part of the popular culture of the country. Phraya Anuman Rajadhon was the first Thai scholar who seriously studied Thai folk beliefs and took notes on the nocturnal village spirits of Thailand. He established that, since such spirits were not represented in paintings or drawings, they were purely based on descriptions of popular orally transmitted traditional stories. Therefore, most of the contemporary iconography of ghosts such as Nang Tani, Nang Takian, Krasue, Krahang, Phi Hua Kat, Phi Pop, Phi Phong, Phi Phraya, and Mae Nak has its origins in Thai films that have now become classics.\nThe most feared spirit in Thailand is Phi Tai Hong, the ghost of a person who has died suddenly of a violent death. The folklore of Thailand also includes the belief that sleep paralysis is caused by a ghost, Phi Am.\nTibet.\nThere is widespread belief in ghosts in Tibetan culture. Ghosts are explicitly recognized in the Tibetan Buddhist religion as they were in Indian Buddhism, occupying a distinct but overlapping world to the human one, and feature in many traditional legends. When a human dies, after a period of uncertainty they may enter the ghost world. A hungry ghost (Tibetan: , ; ) has a tiny throat and huge stomach, and so can never be satisfied. Ghosts may be killed with a ritual dagger or caught in a spirit trap and burnt, thus releasing them to be reborn. Ghosts may also be exorcised, and an annual festival is held throughout Tibet for this purpose. Some say that Dorje Shugden, the ghost of a powerful 17th-century monk, is a deity, but the Dalai Lama asserts that he is an evil spirit, which has caused a split in the Tibetan exile community.\nAustronesia.\nThere are many Malay ghost myths, remnants of old animist beliefs that have been shaped by later Hindu, Buddhist, and Muslim influences in the modern states of Indonesia, Malaysia, and Brunei. Some ghost concepts such as the female vampires Pontianak and Penanggalan are shared throughout the region.\nGhosts are a popular theme in modern Malaysian and Indonesian films.\nThere are also many references to ghosts in Filipino culture, ranging from ancient legendary creatures such as the Manananggal and Tiyanak to more modern urban legends and horror films. The beliefs, legends and stories are as diverse as the people of the Philippines.\nThere was widespread belief in ghosts in Polynesian culture, some of which persists today.\nAfter death, a person's ghost normally traveled to the sky world or the underworld, but some could stay on earth. In many Polynesian legends, ghosts were often actively involved in the affairs of the living. Ghosts might also cause sickness or even invade the body of ordinary people, to be driven out through strong medicines.\nEast and Central Asia.\nChina.\nThere are many references to ghosts in Chinese culture. Even Confucius said, \"Respect ghosts and gods, but keep away from them.\"\nThe ghosts take many forms, depending on how the person died, and are often harmful. Many Chinese ghost beliefs have been accepted by neighboring cultures, notably Japan and southeast Asia. Ghost beliefs are closely associated with traditional Chinese religion based on ancestor worship, many of which were incorporated in Taoism. Later beliefs were influenced by Buddhism, and in turn influenced and created uniquely Chinese Buddhist beliefs.\nMany Chinese today believe it possible to contact the spirits of their ancestors through a medium, and that ancestors can help descendants if properly respected and rewarded. The annual ghost festival is celebrated by Chinese around the world. On this day, ghosts and spirits, including those of the deceased ancestors, come out from the lower realm. Ghosts are described in classical Chinese texts as well as modern literature and films.\nAn article in the China Post stated that nearly 87 percent of Chinese office workers believe in ghosts, and some 52 percent of workers will wear hand art, necklaces, crosses, or even place a crystal ball on their desks to keep ghosts at bay, according to the poll. The prevalence of belief is such that the ruling party has actively sought to discourage citizens.\nJapan.\n are figures in Japanese folklore, analogous to Western legends of ghosts. The name consists of two kanji, \u5e7d (\"y\u016b\"), meaning \"faint\" or \"dim\", and \u970a (\"rei\"), meaning \"soul\" or \"spirit\". Alternative names include meaning ruined or departed spirit, meaning dead spirit, or the more encompassing or .\nLike their Chinese and Western counterparts, they are thought to be spirits kept from a peaceful afterlife.\nAmericas.\nMexico.\nThere is extensive and varied belief in ghosts in Mexican culture. The modern state of Mexico before the Spanish conquest was inhabited by diverse peoples such as the Maya and Aztec, and their beliefs have survived and evolved, combined with the beliefs of the Spanish colonists. The Day of the Dead incorporates pre-Columbian beliefs with Christian elements. Mexican literature and films include many stories of ghosts interacting with the living.\nUnited States.\nAccording to the Gallup Poll News Service, belief in haunted houses, ghosts, communication with the dead, and witches had an especially steep increase over the 1990s. A 2005 Gallup poll found that about 32 percent of Americans believe in ghosts.\nDepiction in the arts.\nGhosts are prominent in story-telling of various nations. The ghost story is ubiquitous across all cultures from oral folktales to works of literature. While ghost stories are often explicitly meant to be scary, they have been written to serve all sorts of purposes, from comedy to morality tales. Ghosts often appear in the narrative as sentinels or prophets of things to come. Belief in ghosts is found in all cultures around the world, and thus ghost stories may be passed down orally or in written form.\nSpirits of the dead appear in literature as early as Homer's \"Odyssey\", which features a journey to the underworld and the hero encountering the ghosts of the dead, and the Old Testament, in which the Witch of Endor summons the spirit of the prophet Samuel.\nRenaissance to Romanticism (1500 to 1840).\nOne of the more recognizable ghosts in English literature is the shade of Hamlet's murdered father in Shakespeare's \"The Tragical History of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark\". In \"Hamlet\", it is the ghost who demands that Prince Hamlet investigate his \"murder most foul\" and seek revenge upon his usurping uncle, King Claudius.\nIn English Renaissance theater, ghosts were often depicted in the garb of the living and even in armor, as with the ghost of Hamlet's father. Armor, being out-of-date by the time of the Renaissance, gave the stage ghost a sense of antiquity. But the sheeted ghost began to gain ground on stage in the 19th century because an armored ghost could not satisfactorily convey the requisite spookiness: it clanked and creaked, and had to be moved about by complicated pulley systems or elevators. These clanking ghosts being hoisted about the stage became objects of ridicule as they became clich\u00e9d stage elements. Ann Jones and Peter Stallybrass, in \"Renaissance Clothing and the Materials of Memory\", point out, \"In fact, it is as laughter increasingly threatens the Ghost that he starts to be staged not in armor but in some form of 'spirit drapery'.\"\nVictorian/Edwardian (1840 to 1920).\nThe \"classic\" ghost story arose during the Victorian period, and included authors such as M. R. James, Sheridan Le Fanu, Violet Hunt, and Henry James. Classic ghost stories were influenced by the gothic fiction tradition, and contain elements of folklore and psychology. M. R. James summed up the essential elements of a ghost story as, \"Malevolence and terror, the glare of evil faces, 'the stony grin of unearthly malice', pursuing forms in darkness, and 'long-drawn, distant screams', are all in place, and so is a modicum of blood, shed with deliberation and carefully husbanded...\". One of the key early appearances by ghosts was \"The Castle of Otranto\" by Horace Walpole in 1764, considered to be the first gothic novel.\nFamous literary apparitions from this period are the ghosts of \"A Christmas Carol\", in which Ebenezer Scrooge is helped to see the error of his ways by the ghost of his former colleague Jacob Marley, and the ghosts of Christmas Past, Christmas Present, and Christmas Yet to Come.\nModern era (1920 to 1970).\nProfessional parapsychologists and \"ghosts hunters\", such as Harry Price, active in the 1920s and 1930s, and Peter Underwood, active in the 1940s and 1950s, published accounts of their experiences with ostensibly true ghost stories such as Price's \"The Most Haunted House in England\", and Underwood's \"Ghosts of Borley\" (both recounting experiences at Borley Rectory). The writer Frank Edwards delved into ghost stories in his books of his, like \"Stranger than Science\".\nChildren's benevolent ghost stories became popular, such as Casper the Friendly Ghost, created in the 1930s and appearing in comics, animated cartoons, and eventually a 1995 feature film.\nWith the advent of motion pictures and television, screen depictions of ghosts became common, and spanned a variety of genres; the works of Shakespeare, Dickens and Wilde have all been made into cinematic versions. Novel-length tales have been difficult to adapt to cinema, although that of \"The Haunting of Hill House\" to \"The Haunting\" in 1963 is an exception.\nSentimental depictions during this period were more popular in cinema than horror, and include the 1947 film \"The Ghost and Mrs. Muir\", which was later adapted to television with a successful 1968\u20131970 TV series. Genuine psychological horror films from this period include 1944's \"The Uninvited\", and 1945's \"Dead of Night\".\nPost-modern (1970\u2013present).\nThe 1970s saw screen depictions of ghosts diverge into distinct genres of the romantic and horror. A common theme in the romantic genre from this period is the ghost as a benign guide or messenger, often with unfinished business, such as 1989's \"Field of Dreams\", the 1990 film \"Ghost\", and the 1993 comedy \"Heart and Souls\". In the horror genre, 1980's \"The Fog\", and the \"A Nightmare on Elm Street\" series of films from the 1980s and 1990s are notable examples of the trend for the merging of ghost stories with scenes of physical violence.\nPopularised in such films as the 1984 comedy \"Ghostbusters\", ghost hunting became a hobby for many who formed ghost hunting societies to explore reportedly haunted places. The ghost hunting theme has been featured in reality television series, such as \"Ghost Adventures\", \"Ghost Hunters\", \"Ghost Hunters International\", \"Ghost Lab\", \"Most Haunted\", and \"A Haunting\". It is also represented in children's television by such programs as \"The Ghost Hunter\" and \"Ghost Trackers\". Ghost hunting also gave rise to multiple guidebooks to haunted locations, and ghost hunting \"how-to\" manuals.\nThe 1990s saw a return to classic \"gothic\" ghosts, whose dangers were more psychological than physical. Examples of films from this period include 1999's \"The Sixth Sense\" and \"The Others\".\nAsian cinema has also produced horror films about ghosts, such as the 1998 Japanese film \"Ringu\" (remade in the US as \"The Ring\" in 2002), and the Pang brothers' 2002 film \"The Eye\".\nIndian ghost movies are popular not just in India, but in the Middle East, Africa, South East Asia, and other parts of the world. Some Indian ghost movies such as the comedy / horror film \"Chandramukhi\" have been commercial successes, dubbed into several languages.\nIn fictional television programming, ghosts have been explored in series such as \"Supernatural\", \"Ghost Whisperer\", and \"Medium\".\nIn animated fictional television programming, ghosts have served as the central element in series such as \"Casper the Friendly Ghost\", \"Danny Phantom\", and \"Scooby-Doo\". Various other television shows have depicted ghosts as well. \nMetaphorical usages.\nNietzsche argued that people generally wear prudent masks in company, but that an alternative strategy for social interaction is to present oneself as an absence, as a social ghost \u2013 \"One reaches out for us but gets no hold of us\" \u2013 a sentiment later echoed (if in a less positive way) by Carl Jung.\nNick Harkaway has considered that all people carry a host of ghosts in their heads in the form of impressions of past acquaintances \u2013 ghosts who represent mental maps of other people in the world and serve as philosophical reference points.\nObject relations theory sees human personalities as formed by splitting off aspects of the person that he or she deems incompatible, whereupon the person may be haunted in later life by such ghosts of his or her alternate selves.\nThe sense of ghosts as invisible, mysterious entities is invoked in several terms that use the word metaphorically, such as ghostwriter (a writer who pens texts credited to another person without revealing the ghostwriter's role as an author); ghost singer (a vocalist who records songs whose vocals are credited to another person); and \"ghosting\" a date (when a person breaks off contact with a former romantic partner and disappears).\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Situated in the southwest of the country, where the Rh\u00f4ne exits Lake Geneva, it is the capital of the Republic and Canton of Geneva. Geneva is a global city, an international financial centre, and a worldwide centre for diplomacy, which has led to it being called the \"Peace Capital\".\nIt hosts the highest number of international organizations in the world, including the headquarters of many agencies of the United Nations and the ICRC and IFRC of the Red Cross. It was where the Geneva Conventions on humanitarian treatment in war were signed, and, in the aftermath of World War I, it hosted the League of Nations. It shares a unique distinction with municipalities such as New York City, Bonn, Basel, and Strasbourg as a city which serves as the headquarters of at least one critical international organization without being the capital of a country.\nThe city of Geneva () had a population of 203,856 in January 2021 within its municipal territory of . The Geneva metropolitan area as officially defined by Eurostat, including suburbs and exurbs in Vaud and the French departments of Ain and Haute-Savoie, extends over and had a population of 1,053,436 in 2021. The Canton of Geneva, the Nyon District, and the \"P\u00f4le m\u00e9tropolitain du Genevois fran\u00e7ais\" (a federation of eight French intercommunal councils), form the (\"Greater Geneva\"), a Local Grouping of Transnational Cooperation in charge of organizing cooperation within the cross-border metropolitan area of Geneva. The extends over and had a population of 1,046,168, with 58.3% of them living on Swiss territory, and 41.7% on French territory.\nIn 2025, Geneva was ranked as the world's fifteenth most important financial centre by the Global Financial Centres Index, fourth in Europe behind London, Frankfurt and Dublin. In 2024, Geneva was ranked as the third most liveable city in the world by Mercer, as well as the fourth most expensive city in the world. In a UBS ranking of global cities in 2018, Geneva was ranked first for gross earnings, second most expensive, and fourth in purchasing power.\nEtymology.\nThe city was mentioned in Latin texts, by Caesar, with the spelling \"Genava\", probably from the Celtic from the stem (\"mouth\"), in the sense of an estuary, an etymology shared with the Italian port city of Genoa (in Italian \"Genova\").\nThe medieval county of Geneva in Middle Latin was known as \"pagus major Genevensis\" or \"Comitatus Genevensis\" (also \"Gebennensis\"). After 1400 it became the \"Genevois\" province of Savoy (albeit not extending to the city proper, until the reformation of the seat of the Bishop of Geneva).\nHistory.\nGeneva was an Allobrogian border town, fortified against the Helvetii tribe, when the Roman Republic took it in 121 BC. It became Christian under the Late Roman Empire, and acquired its first bishop in the 5th century, having been connected to the Bishopric of Vienne in the 4th.\nIn the Middle Ages, Geneva was ruled by a count under the Holy Roman Empire until the late 14th century, when it was granted a charter giving it a high degree of self-governance. Around this time, the House of Savoy came to at least nominally dominate the city. In the 15th century, an oligarchic republican government emerged with the creation of the Grand Council. In the first half of the 16th century, the Protestant Reformation reached the city, causing religious strife, during which Savoy rule was thrown off and Geneva allied itself with the Swiss Confederacy.\nIn 1541, with Protestantism on the rise, John Calvin, the Protestant Reformer and proponent of Calvinism, became the spiritual leader of the city and established a \"Protestant Rome\". By the 18th century, Geneva had come under the influence of Catholic France, which cultivated the city as its own. France tended to be at odds with the ordinary townsfolk, which inspired the failed Geneva Revolution of 1782, an attempt to win representation in the government for men of modest means. In 1798, Revolutionary France under the Directory annexed Geneva. France lost Geneva, which recovered its independence, at the end of the Napoleonic Wars. On 19 May 1815, Geneva joined the Swiss Confederation. In 1907, the separation of Church and State was adopted. Geneva flourished in the 19th and 20th centuries, becoming the seat of many international organizations.\nGeography.\nTopography.\nGeneva is located at 46\u00b012' North, 6\u00b009' East, at the south-western end of Lake Geneva, where the Rh\u00f4ne flows out. It is surrounded by three mountain chains, each belonging to the Jura: the Jura main range lies north-westward, the Vuache southward, and the Sal\u00e8ve south-eastward.\nThe city covers an area of , while the area of the canton is , including the two small exclaves of C\u00e9ligny in Vaud. The part of the lake that is attached to Geneva has an area of and is sometimes referred to as ('small lake'). The canton has only a border with the rest of Switzerland. Of of the border, 103 are shared with France, the department of Ain to the north and west and the department of to the south and east.\nOf the land in the city, , or 1.5%, is used for agricultural purposes, while , or 3.1%, is forested. The rest of the land, , or 91.8%, is built up (buildings or roads), , or 3.1%, is either rivers or lakes and , or 0.1%, is wasteland.\nOf the built-up area, industrial buildings made up 3.4%, housing and buildings made up 46.2% and transportation infrastructure 25.8%, while parks, green belts and sports fields made up 15.7%. Of the agricultural land, 0.3% is used for growing crops. Of the water in the municipality, 0.2% is composed of lakes and 2.9% is rivers and streams.\nThe altitude of Geneva is and corresponds to the altitude of the largest of the Pierres du Niton, two large rocks emerging from the lake which date from the last ice age. This rock was chosen by General Guillaume Henri Dufour as the reference point for surveying in Switzerland. The second main river of Geneva is the Arve, which flows into the Rh\u00f4ne just west of the city centre. Mont Blanc can be seen from Geneva and is an hour's drive from the city.\nClimate.\nThe climate of Geneva is a temperate climate, more specifically an oceanic climate (K\u00f6ppen climate classification: Cfb). Winters are cool, usually with light frosts at night and thawing conditions during the day. Summers are relatively warm. Precipitation is adequate and is relatively well-distributed throughout the year, although autumn is slightly wetter than other seasons. Ice storms near Lac L\u00e9man are normal in the winter: Geneva can be affected by the Bise, a north-easterly wind. This can lead to severe icing in winter.\nIn summer, many people swim in the lake and patronise public beaches such as Gen\u00e8ve Plage and the Bains des P\u00e2quis. The city, in certain years, receives snow during colder months. The nearby mountains are subject to substantial snowfall and are suitable for skiing. Many world-renowned ski resorts such as Verbier and Crans-Montana are less than three hours away by car. Mont Sal\u00e8ve (), just across the border in France, dominates the southerly view from the city centre, and Mont Blanc, the highest of the Alpine range, is visible from most of the city, towering high above Chamonix, which, along with Morzine, Le Grand Bornand, La Clusaz, and resorts of the Grand Massif such as Samoens, Morillon, and Flaine, are the closest French skiing destinations to Geneva.\nDuring the years 2000\u20132009, the mean yearly temperature was 11\u00a0\u00b0C and the mean number of sunshine-hours per year was 2003.\nThe highest temperature recorded in Gen\u00e8ve\u2013Cointrin was in July 2015, and the lowest temperature recorded was \u221220.0\u00a0\u00b0C (\u22124.0\u00a0\u00b0F) in February 1956.\nPolitics.\nAdministrative divisions.\nThe city is divided into eight \"quartiers\", or districts, sometimes composed of several neighbourhoods. On the left bank are: (1) Jonction, (2) Centre, Plainpalais, and Acacias; (3) Eaux-Vives; and (4) Champel. The right bank includes: (1) Saint-Jean and Charmilles; (2) Servette and Petit-Saconnex; (3) Grottes and Saint-Gervais; and (4) Paquis and Nations.\nGovernment.\nThe Administrative Council () constitutes the executive government of the city of Geneva and operates as a collegiate authority. It is composed of five councilors (), each presiding over a department. The president of the executive department acts as mayor (). In the governmental year 2021\u20132022, the Administrative Council is presided over by Fr\u00e9d\u00e9rique Perler. Departmental tasks, coordination measures and implementation of laws decreed by the Municipal Council are carried out by the Administrative Council. Elections for the Administrative Council are held every five years. The current term of office is from 1June 2020 to 31May 2025. The delegates take office due to a winner-takes-all election (, or ). The mayor and vice change each year, while the heads of the other departments are assigned by the collegiate. The executive body holds its meetings in the Palais Eynard, near the .\nAs of 2020,[ [update]] Geneva's Administrative Council is made up of two representatives each of the Social Democratic Party (PS) and the Green Party (PES), and one member of the Christian Democratic Party (PDC). This gives the left-wing parties four out of the five seats and, for the first time in history, a female majority in the election held on 15March / 5April 2020. Except for the mayor, all other councillors have been elected for the first time.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nParliament.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Pie chart/styles.css\"/&gt;\nThe Municipal Council () holds legislative power. It is made up of 80 members, with elections held every five years. The Municipal Council makes regulations and by-laws that are executed by the Administrative Council and the administration. The delegates are selected by means of a system of proportional representation with a seven percent threshold.\nThe sessions of the Municipal Council are public. Unlike members of the Administrative Council, members of the Municipal Council are not politicians by profession, and they are paid a fee based on their attendance. Any resident of Geneva allowed to vote can be elected as a member of the Municipal Council. The Council holds its meetings in the Town Hall (), in the old city.\nThe last election of the Municipal Council was held on 15March 2020 for the term 2020\u20132025. Currently, the Municipal Council consists of: 19 members of the Social Democratic Party (PS), 18 Green Party (PES), 14 (PLR), 8 Christian Democratic People's Party; (PDC) 7 Geneva Citizens' Movement (MCG), 7 (an alliance of the left parties PST-POP () and , 6 Swiss People's Party (UDC).\nElections.\nNational Council.\nIn the 2019 federal election for the Swiss National Council the most popular party was the Green Party which received 26% (+14.6) of the vote. The next seven most popular parties were the PS (17.9%, -5.9), PLR (15.1%, -2.4), the UDC (12.6%, -3.7), the PdA/solidarit\u00e9S (10%, +1.3), the PDC (5.4%, -5.3), the pvl (5%, +2.9), and MCR (4.9%, -2.7). In the federal election a total of 34,319 votes were cast, and the voter turnout was 39.6%.\nIn the 2015 federal election for the Swiss National Council the most popular party was the PS which received 23.8% of the vote. The next five most popular parties were the PLR (17.6%), the UDC (16.3%), the Green Party (11.4%), the PDC (10.7%), and the solidarit\u00e9S (8.8%). In the federal election a total of 36,490 votes were cast, and the voter turnout was 44.1%.\nMetropolitan cooperation.\nThe city centre of Geneva is located only from the border of France. As a result, the urban area and the metropolitan area largely extend across the border on French territory. Due to the small size of the municipality of Geneva () and extension of the urban area over an international border, official bodies of transnational cooperation were developed as early as the 1970s to manage the cross-border Greater Geneva area at a metropolitan level.\nIn 1973, a Franco-Swiss agreement created the ('Franco-Genevan Regional Committee', ). In 1997 an 'Urban planning charter' of the CRFG defined for the first time a planning territory called ('Franco-Vaud-Genevan urban area'). 2001 saw the creation of a ('Strategic Committee for the Development of Regional Public Transports', ), a committee which adopted in 2003 a 'Charter for Public Transports', first step in the development of a metropolitan, cross-border commuter rail network (see L\u00e9man Express).\nIn 2004, a public transnational body called ('Franco-Vaud-Genevan urban area project') was created to serve as the main body of metropolitan cooperation for the planning territory defined in 1997, with more local French councils taking part in this new public body than in the CRFG created in 1973. Finally in 2012 the was renamed ('Greater Geneva'), and the following year it was transformed into a Local Grouping of Transnational Cooperation (), a public entity under Swiss law, which now serves as the executive body of the .\nThe GLCT is made up of the Canton of Geneva, the Nyon District (in the canton of Vaud), and the \"P\u00f4le m\u00e9tropolitain du Genevois fran\u00e7ais\u200a\" (literally 'Metropolitan hub of the French Genevan territory'), this last one a federation of eight French intercommunal councils in Ain and Haute-Savoie. The GLCT extends over and had a population of 1,046,168 in Jan. 2021 (Swiss estimates and French census), 58.3% of them living on Swiss territory, and 41.7% on French territory.\nInternational relations.\nGeneva does not have any sister relationships with other cities. It declares itself related to the entire world.\nDemographics.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Module:Historical populations/styles.css\"/&gt;The city of Geneva () had a population 203,856 in 2021 (Jan. estimate) within its small municipal territory of . The city of Geneva is at the centre of the Geneva metropolitan area, a Functional Urban Area (as per Eurostat methodology) which extends over Swiss territory (entire Canton of Geneva and part of the canton of Vaud) and French territory (parts of the departments of Ain and Haute-Savoie). The Geneva Functional Urban Area covers a land area of (24.2% in Switzerland, 75.8% in France) and had 1,053,436 inhabitants in Jan. 2021 (Swiss estimates and French census), 57.8% of them on Swiss territory and 42.2% on French territory.\nThe Geneva metropolitan area is one of the fastest growing in Europe. Its population rose from 906,603 in Jan. 2010 to 1,053,436 in Jan. 2021, which means the metropolitan area registered a population growth rate of +1.39% per year during those 11 years. Growth is higher in the French part of the metropolitan area (+1.80% per year between 2010 and 2021) than in the Swiss part (+1.10% per year between 2010 and 2021), as Geneva attracts many French commuters due to high Swiss salaries and a favourable Franco-Swiss tax regime for French residents working in Switzerland.\nLanguage.\nThe official language of Geneva (both the city and the canton) is French. English is also common due to a high number of Anglophone residents working in international institutions and the bank sector. In 2000 there were 128,622 residents, or 72.3% of the population, who spoke French as a first language. English was the second most common (7,853 or 4.4%), followed by Spanish (7,462 or 4.2%), Italian (7,320 or 4.1%), and German (7,050 or 4.0%); 113 spoke Romansh, an official language in Switzerland.\nPopulation by birthplace.\nIn the city of Geneva, as of 2013[ [update]], 48% of the population are resident foreign nationals. For a list of the largest groups of foreign residents see the cantonal overview. Over the last 10 years (1999\u20132009), the population has changed at a rate of 7.2%; a rate of 3.4% due to migration and at a rate of 3.4% due to births and deaths.\nGender.\nAs of 2008[ [update]], the gender distribution of the population was 47.8% male and 52.2% female.

A further 11,757 or 6.6% who were born in the same canton, while 27,359 or 15.4% were born elsewhere in Switzerland, and 77,893 or 43.8% were born outside of Switzerland.\nBirth rate.\nIn 2008[ [update]], there were 1,147 live births to Swiss citizens and 893 births to non-Swiss citizens, and in the same time span there were 1,114 deaths of Swiss citizens and 274 non-Swiss citizen deaths. Ignoring immigration and emigration, the population of Swiss citizens increased by 33, while the foreign population increased by 619. There were 465 Swiss men and 498 Swiss women who emigrated from Switzerland. At the same time, there were 2933 non-Swiss men and 2662 non-Swiss women who immigrated from another country to Switzerland. The total Swiss population change in 2008 (from all sources, including moves across municipal borders) was an increase of 135 and the non-Swiss population increased by 3181 people. This represents a population growth rate of 1.8%.\nAge, status and households.\nAs of 2000[ [update]], children and teenagers (0\u201319 years old) made up 18.2% of the population, while adults (20\u201364 years old) made up 65.8% and seniors (over 64 years old) make up 16%.\nAs of 2000[ [update]], there were 78,666 people who were single and never married in the municipality.

According to the Federal Statistical Office (OFS), the largest share of the population, 51.1%, identified as either having no religious affiliation (48.8%) or as having an unknown affiliation (2.36%). Christianity, as a whole, accounted for 38.5% of the population, with 26.3% identifying as Catholic, 5.90% as Protestant, and 6.29% belonging to other Christian communities. Among other religious groups, 7.32% of the population identified as Muslim, 1.29% as Jewish, and 1.72% adhered to other religions. \nThe 2000 census[ [update]] recorded 66,491 residents (37.4% of the population) as Catholic, while 41,289 people (23.20%) belonged to no church or were agnostic or atheist, 24,105 (13.5%) belonged to the Swiss Reformed Church, and 8,698 (4.89%) were Muslim. There were also 3,959 members of an Orthodox church (2.22%), 220 individuals (or about 0.12% of the population) who belonged to the Christian Catholic Church of Switzerland, 2,422 (1.36%) who belonged to another Christian church, and 2,601 people (1.46%) who were Jewish. There were 707 individuals who were Buddhist, 474 who were Hindu and 423 who belonged to another church. 26,575 respondents (14.93%) did not answer the question.\nAccording to 2012 statistics by Swiss Bundesamt f\u00fcr Statistik 49.2% of the population were Christian, (34.2% Catholic, 8.8% Swiss Reformed (organized in the Protestant Church of Geneva) and 6.2% other Christians, mostly other Protestants), 38% of Genevans were non-religious, 6.1% were Muslim and 1.6% were Jews.\nGeneva has historically been considered a Protestant city and was known as the \"Protestant Rome\" due to it being the base of John Calvin, William Farel, Theodore Beza and other Protestant reformers. Over the past century, substantial immigration from France and other predominantly Catholic countries, as well as general secularization, has changed its religious landscape. As a result, three times as many Roman Catholics as Protestants lived in the city in 2000, while a large number of residents were members of neither group. Geneva forms part of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Lausanne, Geneva and Fribourg.\nThe World Council of Churches and the Lutheran World Federation both have their headquarters at the Ecumenical Centre in Grand-Saconnex, Geneva. The World Communion of Reformed Churches, a worldwide organization of Presbyterian, Continental Reformed, Congregational and other Calvinist churches gathering more than 80\u00a0million people around the world was based here from 1948 until 2013. The executive committee of the World Communion of Reformed Churches voted in 2012 to move its offices to Hanover, Germany, citing the high costs of running the ecumenical organization in Geneva, Switzerland. The move was completed in 2013. Likewise, the Conference of European Churches have moved their headquarters from Geneva to Brussels.\n\"Protestant Rome\".\nPrior to the Protestant Reformation the city was \"de jure\" and \"de facto\" Catholic. Reaction to the new movement varied across Switzerland. John Calvin went to Geneva in 1536 after William Farel encouraged him to do so. In Geneva, the Catholic bishop had been obliged to seek exile in 1532. Geneva became a stronghold of Calvinism. Some of the tenets created there influenced Protestantism as a whole. St. Pierre Cathedral was where Calvin and his Protestant reformers preached. It constituted the epicentre of the newly developing Protestant thought that would later become known as the Reformed tradition. Many prominent Reformed theologians operated there, including William Farel and Theodore Beza, Calvin's successor who progressed Reformed thought after his death.\nGeneva was a haven for Calvinists, while Roman Catholics and others considered heretics were persecuted. The case of Michael Servetus, an early Nontrinitarian, is notable. Condemned by both Catholics and Protestants alike, he was arrested in Geneva and burnt at the stake as a heretic by order of the city's Protestant governing council. John Calvin and his followers denounced him, and possibly contributed to his sentence.\nIn 1802, during its annexation to France under Napoleon I, the Diocese of Geneva was united with the Diocese of Chamb\u00e9ry, but the 1814 Congress of Vienna and the 1816 Treaty of Turin stipulated that in the territories transferred to a now considerably extended Geneva, the Catholic religion was to be protected and that no changes were to be made in existing conditions without an agreement with the Holy See. Napoleon's common policy granted civil rights to Catholics in Protestant-majority areas, as well as the reverse, and also emancipated Jews. In 1819, the city of Geneva and 20 parishes were united to the Diocese of Lausanne by Pope Pius VII and in 1822, the non-Swiss territory was made into the Diocese of Annecy. A variety of concord with the civil authorities came as a result of the separation of church and state, enacted with strong Catholic support in 1907.\nCrime.\nIn 2014 the incidence of crimes listed in the Swiss Criminal Code in Geneva was 143.9 per thousand residents. During the same period the rate of drug crimes was 33.6 per thousand residents. The rate of violations of immigration, visa and work permit laws was 35.7 per thousand residents.\nHeritage sites of national significance.\nThere are 82 buildings or sites in Geneva that are listed as Swiss heritage sites of national significance, and the entire old city of Geneva is part of the Inventory of Swiss Heritage Sites.\nReligious buildings: Cath\u00e9drale St-Pierre et Chapelle des Macchab\u00e9es, Notre-Dame Church, Russian church, St-Germain Church, Temple de la Fusterie, Temple de l'Auditoire\nCivic buildings: Former Arsenal and Archives of the City of Gen\u00e8ve, Former Cr\u00e9dit Lyonnais, Former H\u00f4tel Buisson, Former H\u00f4tel du R\u00e9sident de France et Biblioth\u00e8que de la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de lecture de Gen\u00e8ve, Former \u00e9cole des arts industriels, Archives d'\u00c9tat de Gen\u00e8ve (Annexe), B\u00e2timent des forces motrices, Biblioth\u00e8que de Gen\u00e8ve, Library juive de Gen\u00e8ve \u00abG\u00e9rard Nordmann\u00bb, Cabinet des estampes, Centre d'Iconographie genevoise, Coll\u00e8ge Calvin, \u00c9cole Geisendorf, University Hospital of Geneva (HUG), H\u00f4tel de Ville et tour Baudet, Immeuble Clart\u00e9 at Rue Saint-Laurent 2 and 4, Immeubles House Rotonde at Rue Charles-Giron 11\u201319, Immeubles at Rue Beauregard 2, 4, 6, 8, Immeubles at Rue de la Corraterie 10\u201326, Immeubles at Rue des Granges 2\u20136, Immeuble at Rue des Granges 8, Immeubles at Rue des Granges 10 and 12, Immeuble at Rue des Granges 14, Immeuble and Former Armory at Rue des Granges 16, Immeubles at Rue Pierre Fatio 7 and 9, House de Saussure at Rue de la Cit\u00e9 24, House Des arts du Gr\u00fctli at Rue du G\u00e9n\u00e9ral-Dufour 16, House Royale et les deux immeubles \u00e0 c\u00f4t\u00e9 at Quai Gustave Ador 44\u201350, Tavel House at Rue du Puits-St-Pierre 6, Turrettini House at Rue de l'H\u00f4tel-de-Ville 8 and 10, Brunswick Monument, Palais de Justice, Palais de l'Ath\u00e9n\u00e9e, Palais des Nations with library and archives of the SDN and ONU, Palais Eynard et Archives de la ville de Gen\u00e8ve, Palais Wilson, Parc des Bastions avec Mur des R\u00e9formateurs, Place de Neuve et Monument du G\u00e9n\u00e9ral Dufour, Pont de la Machine, Pont sur l'Arve, Poste du Mont-Blanc, Quai du Mont-Blanc, Quai et H\u00f4tel des Bergues, Quai G\u00e9n\u00e9ral Guisan and English Gardens, Quai Gustave-Ador and Jet d'eau, T\u00e9l\u00e9vision Suisse Romande, University of Geneva, Victoria Hall.\nArcheological sites:\nFoundation Baur and Museum of the arts d'Extr\u00eame-Orient, Parc et campagne de la Grange and Library (neolithic shore settlement/Roman villa), Bronze Age shore settlement of Plonjon, Temple de la Madeleine archeological site, Temple Saint-Gervais archeological site, Old City with Celtic, Roman and medieval villages.\nMuseums, theaters, and other cultural sites: Conservatoire de musique at Place Neuve 5, Conservatoire et Jardin botaniques, Fonds cantonal d'art contemporain, Ile Rousseau and statue, Institut et Mus\u00e9e Voltaire with Library and Archives, Mallet House and Museum international de la R\u00e9forme, Mus\u00e9e Ariana, Museum of Art and History, Museum d'art moderne et contemporain, Museum d'ethnographie, Museum of the International Red Cross, Mus\u00e9e Rath, Natural History Museum, Plainpalais Commune Auditorium, Pito\u00ebff Theatre, Villa Bartholoni at the Museum of History and Science.\nInternational organizations: CERN, International Labour Organization (ILO), International Committee of the Red Cross, United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), World Meteorological Organization, World Trade Organization, International Telecommunication Union, World YMCA.\nSociety and culture.\nMedia.\nThe city's main newspaper is the daily \"Tribune de Gen\u00e8ve\", with a readership of about 187,000. \"Le Courrier\" mainly focuses on Geneva. Both \"Le Temps\" (headquartered in Geneva) and \"Le Matin\" are widely read in Geneva, but cover the whole of the Romandy.\nGeneva is the main media center for French-speaking Switzerland. It is the headquarters for the numerous French language radio and television networks of the Swiss Broadcasting Corporation, known collectively as Radio T\u00e9l\u00e9vision Suisse. While both networks cover the whole Romandy, special programs related to Geneva are sometimes broadcast on some of the local radio frequencies. Other local radio stations broadcast from the city, including YesFM (FM 91.8\u00a0MHz), Radio Cit\u00e9 (non-commercial radio, FM 92.2\u00a0MHz), OneFM (FM 107.0\u00a0MHz, also broadcast in Vaud), and World Radio Switzerland (FM 88.4\u00a0MHz). L\u00e9man Bleu is a local TV channel, founded in 1996 and distributed by cable. Due to the proximity to France, many French television channels are also available.\nTraditions and customs.\nGeneva observes \"Je\u00fbne genevois\" on the first Thursday following the first Sunday in September. By local tradition, this commemorates the date news of the St. Bartholomew's Day massacre of Huguenots reached Geneva.\nGeneva celebrates \"L'Escalade\" on the weekend nearest 12 December, celebrating the defeat of the surprise attack of troops sent by Charles Emmanuel I, Duke of Savoy during the night of 11\u201312 December 1602. Festive traditions include chocolate cauldrons filled with vegetable-shaped marzipan treats and the Escalade procession on horseback in seventeenth century armour. Geneva has also been organizing a Escalade race, usually during the first week-end of December. This race takes place around Geneva's Old Town, and with more that 50,000 participants is the largest in the country. Non-competitive racers dress up in fancy costumes, while walking in the race.\nThe Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 des Vieux-Grenadiers is a local gentlemen's club founded in 1749 and regroups the local political and economical elite. The society has a military branch performing during official events since the late XIXth century.\nSince 1818, a particular chestnut tree has been used as the official \"herald of the spring\" in Geneva. The \"sautier\" (secretary of the Parliament of the Canton of Geneva) observes the tree and notes the day of arrival of the first bud. While this event has no practical effect, the sautier issues a formal press release and the local newspaper will usually mention the news.\nAs this is one of the world's oldest records of a plant's reaction to climatic conditions, researchers have been interested to note that the first bud has been appearing earlier and earlier in the year. During the 19th century many dates were in March or April. In recent years, they have usually been in late February (sometimes earlier). In 2002, the first bud appeared unusually early, on 7 February, and then again on 29 December of the same year. The following year, one of the hottest years recorded in Europe, was a year with no bud. In 2008, the first bud also appeared early, on 19 February.\nMusic and festivals.\nThe opera house, the Grand Th\u00e9\u00e2tre de Gen\u00e8ve, which officially opened in 1876, was partly destroyed by a fire in 1951 and reopened in 1962. It has the largest stage in Switzerland. It features opera and dance performances, recitals, concerts and, occasionally, theatre. The Victoria Hall is used for classical music concerts. It is the home of the Orchestre de la Suisse Romande.\nEvery summer the F\u00eates de Gen\u00e8ve (Geneva Festival) are organised in Geneva. According to Radio T\u00e9l\u00e9vision Suisse in 2013 hundreds of thousands of people came to Geneva to see the annual hour-long grand firework display of the F\u00eates de Gen\u00e8ve.\nAn annual music festival takes place in June. Groups of artists perform in different parts of the city. In 2016 the festival celebrated its 25th anniversary.\nFurther annual festivals are the \"F\u00eate de l'Olivier\", a festival of Arabic music, organized by the ICAM since 1980, and the \"Genevan Brass Festival\", founded by Christophe Sturzenegger in 2010.\nEducation.\nThe Canton of Geneva's public school system has \"\u00e9coles primaires\" (ages 4\u201312) and \"cycles d'orientation\" (ages 12\u201315). Students can leave school at 15, but secondary education is provided by \"coll\u00e8ges\" (ages 15\u201319), the oldest of which is the Coll\u00e8ge Calvin, which could be considered one of the oldest public schools in the world, \"\u00e9coles de culture g\u00e9n\u00e9rale\" (15\u201318/19) and the \"\u00e9coles professionnelles\" (15\u201318/19). The \"\u00e9coles professionnelles\" offer full-time courses and part-time study as part of an apprenticeship. Geneva also has a number of private schools.\nIn 2011 89,244 (37.0%) of the population had completed non-mandatory upper secondary education, and 107,060 or (44.3%) had completed additional higher education (either university or a Fachhochschule). Of the 107,060 who completed tertiary schooling, 32.5% were Swiss men, 31.6% were Swiss women, 18.1% were non-Swiss men and 17.8% were non-Swiss women.\nDuring the 2011\u20132012 school year, there were a total of 92,311 students in the Geneva school system (primary to university). The education system in the Canton of Geneva has eight years of primary school, with 32,716 students. The secondary school program consists of three lower, obligatory years of schooling, followed by three to five years of optional, advanced study. There were 13,146 lower-secondary students who attended schools in Geneva. There were 10,486 upper-secondary students from the municipality along with 10,330 students who were in a professional, non-university track program. An additional 11,797 students were attending private schools.\nGeneva is home to the University of Geneva where approximately 16,500 students are regularly enrolled. In 1559 John Calvin founded the Geneva Academy, a theological and humanist seminary. In the 19th century the academy lost its ecclesiastic links and in 1873, with the addition of a medical faculty, it became the University of Geneva. In 2011 it was ranked European university.\nThe Geneva Graduate Institute was among the first academic institutions in the world to teach international relations. It is one of Europe's most prestigious institutions, offering MA and PhD programmes in anthropology and sociology, law, political science, history, economics, international affairs, and development studies.\nGeneva is also home to more than a dozen private, for-profit universities whose activities have come under scrutiny for offering degrees that are not recognized in Switzerland and engaging in \"unscrupulous practices\". These schools include the Geneva School of Diplomacy and International Relations, the International University in Geneva, the Geneva Business School and IFM Business School.\nThe oldest international school in the world is the International School of Geneva, founded in 1924 along with the League of Nations.\nFounded in 1954, CERN was one of Europe's first joint ventures and has developed as the world's largest particle physics laboratory. Physicists from around the world travel to CERN to research matter and explore the fundamental forces and materials that form the universe. It hosts the Large Hadron Collider.\nGeneva is home to five major libraries, the \"Biblioth\u00e8ques municipales Gen\u00e8ve\", the \"Haute \u00e9cole de travail social\", the \"Institut d'\u00e9tudes sociales\", the \"Haute \u00e9cole de sant\u00e9\", the \"\u00c9cole d'ing\u00e9nieurs de Gen\u00e8ve\" and the \"Haute \u00e9cole d'art et de design\". There were (as of 2008[ [update]]) 877,680 books or other media in the libraries, and in the same year 1,798,980 items were loaned.\nEconomy.\nGeneva's economy is largely service-driven and closely linked to the rest of the canton. The city is one of the global leaders in financial centres. Three main sectors dominate the financial sector: commodity trading; trade finance, and wealth management.\nAround a third of the world's free traded oil, sugar, grains and oil seeds is traded in Geneva. Approximately 22% of the world's cotton is traded in the Lake Geneva region. Other major commodities traded in the canton include steel, electricity, or coffee. Large trading companies have their regional or global headquarters in the canton, such as Bunge, Cargill, Vitol, Gunvor, BNP Paribas, Trafigura or Mercuria Energy Group, in addition to being home to the world's largest shipping company, Mediterranean Shipping Company. Commodity trading is sustained by a strong trade finance sector, with large banks such as BCGE, BCP, BNP Paribas, BCV, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole, Credit Suisse, ING, Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale, and UBS, all having their headquarters in the area for this business.\nWealth management is dominated by non-publicly listed banks and private banks, particularly Pictet, Lombard Odier, Edmond de Rothschild Group, Union Bancaire Priv\u00e9e, Mirabaud Group, Dukascopy Bank, Bordier &amp; Cie, Banque SYZ, or REYL &amp; Cie. In addition, the canton is home to the largest concentration of foreign-owned banks in Switzerland, such as HSBC Private Bank, JPMorgan Chase, or Arab Bank.\nBehind the financial sector, the next largest major economic sector is watchmaking, dominated by luxury firms such as Patek Philippe, Vacheron Constantin, Chopard, Piaget, Rolex, Roger Dubuis, Franck Muller, F. P. Journe and others, whose factories are concentrated in the Les Acacias neighbourhood, as well as the neighbouring municipalities of Plan-les-Ouates, Satigny, and Meyrin.\nTrade finance, wealth management, and watchmaking, approximately contribute two thirds of the corporate tax paid in the canton\nOther large multinationals are also headquartered in the city and canton, such as Firmenich (in Satigny), and Givaudan (in Vernier), the world's two largest manufacturers of flavours, fragrances and active cosmetic ingredients; SGS, the world's largest inspection, verification, testing and certification services company; Temenos, a large banking software provider; or the local headquarters for Procter &amp; Gamble, Japan Tobacco International, or L'Or\u00e9al (in Vernier).\nThe city of Geneva is also host to one of the world's largest concentrations of international organisations and UN agencies, such as the Red Cross, the World Health Organization, the World Trade Organization, the International Telecommunication Union, the World Intellectual Property Organization, the World Meteorological Organization, and the International Labour Organization, as well as the European headquarters of the United Nations.\nIts international mindedness, well-connected airport, and centrality in the continent, also make Geneva a good destination for congresses and trade fairs, of which the largest is the Geneva Motor Show held in Palexpo.\nAgriculture is commonplace in the hinterlands of Geneva, particularly wheat and wine. Despite its relatively small size, the canton produces around 10% of the Swiss wine and has the highest vineyard density in the country. The largest strains grown in Geneva are gamay, chasselas, pinot noir, gamaret, and chardonnay.\nAs of \u00a02019[ [update]], Geneva had an unemployment rate of 3.9%. As of 2008[ [update]], there were five people employed in the primary economic sector and about three businesses involved in this sector. 9,783 people were employed in the secondary sector and there were 1,200 businesses in this sector. 134,429 people were employed in the tertiary sector, with 12,489 businesses in this sector. There were 91,880 residents of the municipality who were employed in some capacity, with women making up 47.7% of the workforce.\nIn 2008[ [update]], the total number of full-time equivalent jobs was 124,185. The number of jobs in the primary sector was four, all of which were in agriculture. The number of jobs in the secondary sector was 9,363 of which 4,863 or (51.9%) were in manufacturing and 4,451 (47.5%) were in construction. The number of jobs in the tertiary sector was 114,818. In the tertiary sector; 16,573 or 14.4% were in wholesale or retail sales or the repair of motor vehicles, 3,474 or 3.0% were in the movement and storage of goods, 9,484 or 8.3% were in a hotel or restaurant, 4,544 or 4.0% were in the information industry, 20,982 or 18.3% were the insurance or financial industry, 12,177 or 10.6% were technical professionals or scientists, 10,007 or 8.7% were in education and 15,029 or 13.1% were in health care.\nIn 2000[ [update]], there were 95,190 workers who commuted into the municipality and 25,920 workers who commuted away. The municipality is a net importer of workers, with about 3.7 workers entering the municipality for every one leaving. About 13.8% of the workforce coming into Geneva are coming from outside Switzerland, while 0.4% of the locals commute out of Switzerland for work. Of the working population, 38.2% used public transportation to get to work, and 30.6% used a private car.\nSport.\nIce hockey is one of the most popular sports in Geneva. Geneva is home to Gen\u00e8ve-Servette HC, which plays in the National League (NL). They play their home games in the 7,135-seat Patinoire des Vernets. In 2008, 2010 and 2021 the team made it to the league finals but lost to the ZSC Lions, SC Bern and EV Zug respectively. The team eventually won its first championship in 2023. They won game 7 at home against EHC Biel in a packed Patinoire des Vernets and with an estimated 7,000 more fans watching the game on a giant TV screen in front of the arena. The following season, the team went on to win the Champions Hockey League in February 2024. They won their first European title in a packed Patinoire des Vernets and with an estimated 5,000 more fans watching the game in a fanzone in front of the arena. Historically, the team was by far the most popular one in both the city and the canton of Geneva, drawing three times more spectators than the football team in 2017. \nFootball is also popular and the town is home to Servette FC, a club founded in 1890 and named after a borough on the right bank of the Rh\u00f4ne. It is the most successful football club in Romandy, and the third in Switzerland overall, with 17 league titles and 8 Swiss Cups. The home of Servette FC is the 30,000-seat Stade de Gen\u00e8ve. Servette FC plays in the Credit Suisse Super League. Its women's team, Servette FC Ch\u00eanois F\u00e9minin, plays in the top tier AXA Women's Super League. They play their home games in the 4,000-seat Stade des Trois-Ch\u00eane. Its latest achievement is the Swiss championship title in 2024. \u00c9toile Carouge FC is another football team that currently competes in the second tier Challenge League. They play their home games in the 3,600-seat Stade de la Fontenette.\nGeneva is also home to a semi-pro basketball team, Lions de Gen\u00e8ve, 2013 and 2015 champions of the Swiss Basketball League. The team plays its home games in the Pavilion des Sports.\nAdditionally, Geneva is home to an amateur rugby team, Servette RC, that currently competes in the fourth tier of French rugby.\nThe Geneva Seahawks, established in 1986, are an amateur American football team that currently plays in the Nationalliga A. The Seahawks have reached the Swiss Bowl final six times winning the championship in 1991. The team currently plays home games at Vessy Sports Center.\nInfrastructure.\nTransportation.\nThe city is served by the Geneva Airport. It is connected by Geneva Airport railway station () to both the Swiss Federal Railways network and the French SNCF network, including links to Paris, Lyon, Marseille and Montpellier by TGV. Geneva is connected to the motorway systems of both Switzerland (A1 motorway) and France.\nPublic transport by bus, trolleybus or tram is provided by \"Transports Publics Genevois\". In addition to an extensive coverage of the city centre, the network extends to most of the municipalities of the Canton, with a few lines reaching into France. Public transport by boat is provided by the Mouettes Genevoises, which link the two banks of the lake within the city, and by the which serves more distant destinations such as Nyon, Yvoire, Thonon, \u00c9vian, Lausanne and Montreux using both modern diesel vessels and vintage paddle steamers.\nTrains operated by Swiss Federal Railways connect the airport to the main station of Cornavin in six minutes. Regional train services are being developed towards Coppet and Bellegarde. At the city limits two new railway stations have been opened since 2002: Gen\u00e8ve-S\u00e9cheron (close to the UN and the Botanical Gardens) and Lancy-Pont-Rouge.\nIn 2011 work started on the CEVA rail (Cornavin \u2013 Eaux-Vives \u2013 Annemasse) project, first planned in 1884, which will connect Cornavin with the Cantonal hospital, Eaux-Vives railway station and Annemasse, in France. The link between the main railway station and the classification yard of La Praille already exists; from there, the line runs mostly underground to the Hospital and Eaux-Vives, where it links to the existing line to France. The line fully opened in December 2019, as part of the L\u00e9man Express regional rail network.\nIn May 2013, the demonstrator electric bus system with a capacity of 133 passengers commenced between Geneva Airport and Palexpo. The project aims to introduce a new system of mass transport with electric \"flash\" recharging of the buses at selected stops while passengers are disembarking and embarking.\nTaxis in Geneva can be difficult to find, and may need to be booked in advance, especially in the early morning or at peak hours. Taxis can refuse to take babies and children because of seating legislation.\nAn ambitious project to close 200 streets in the centre of Geneva to cars was approved by the Geneva cantonal authorities in 2010 and was planned to be implemented over a span of four years (2010\u20132014), though as of 2018[ [update]], work on the project has yet to be started.\nUtilities.\nWater, natural gas and electricity are provided to the municipalities of the Canton of Geneva by the state-owned Services Industriels de Gen\u00e8ve, known as SIG. Most of the drinking water (80%) is extracted from the lake; the remaining 20% is provided by groundwater, originally formed by infiltration from the Arve. 30% of the Canton's electricity needs is locally produced, mainly by three hydroelectric dams on the Rh\u00f4ne (Seujet, Verbois and Chancy-Pougny). In addition, 13% of the electricity produced in the Canton is from the burning of waste at the waste incineration facility of Les Cheneviers. The remaining needs (57%) are covered by imports from other cantons in Switzerland or other European countries; SIG buys only electricity produced by renewable methods, and in particular does not use electricity produced using nuclear reactors or fossil fuels. Natural gas is available in the City of Geneva, as well as in about two-thirds of the municipalities of the canton, and is imported from Western Europe by the Swiss company Gaznat. SIG also provides telecommunication facilities to carriers, service providers and large enterprises. From 2003 to 2005, \"Voisin, voisine\" a fibre-to-the-home pilot project with a triple play offering was launched to test the end-user market in the Charmilles district.\nEcological infrastructure.\nIn the context of the city's Climate Strategy, Geneva's \"Office cantonal de l'agriculture et de la nature\" (OCAN) has developed and sustained a network of ecological infrastructure, mainly constituted by biological corridors. Its 2021 revision of the Lighting Plan (\"Plan Lumi\u00e8re\") further introduces dark infrastructure in the form of black corridors (\"Trame Noire\"). In 2024, the metropolitan area Geneva created an open data light pollution map encompassing a \u201cdark grid\u201d.https://\nInternational organisations.\nGeneva is the European headquarters of the United Nations, in the Palace of Nations building, up the hill from the headquarters of the former League of Nations. Several agencies are headquartered in Geneva, including the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, the UN Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights, the World Health Organization, the International Labour Organization, International Telecommunication Union, the International Baccalaureate Organization and the World Intellectual Property Organization.\nApart from the UN agencies, Geneva hosts many inter-governmental organizations, such as the World Trade Organization, the South Centre, the World Meteorological Organization, the World Economic Forum, the International Organization for Migration, the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies and the International Committee of the Red Cross.\nThe Maison de la Paix building hosts the three Geneva centres supported by the Swiss Confederation: the International Centre for Humanitarian Demining, the Centre for the Democratic Control of Armed Forces and the Geneva Centre for Security Policy, as well as other organisations active in the field of peace, international affairs and sustainable development.\nOrganizations on the European level include the European Broadcasting Union (EBU) and CERN (the European Organization for Nuclear Research) which is the world's largest particle physics laboratory.\nThe Geneva Environment Network (GEN) publishes the Geneva Green Guide, an extensive listing of Geneva-based global organisations working on environmental protection and sustainable development. A website, jointly run by the Swiss Government, the World Business Council for Sustainable Development, the United Nations Environment Programme and the International Union for Conservation of Nature, includes accounts of how NGOs, business, government and the UN cooperate. By doing so, it attempts to explain why Geneva has been picked by so many NGOs and UN bodies as their headquarters' location.\nThe World Organization of the Scout Movement and the World Scout Bureau Central Office are headquartered in Geneva.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nExternal links.\n "}
{"id": "12523", "revid": "50556635", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=12523", "title": "Gerard Manley Hopkins", "text": "English poet and Catholic priest (1844\u20131889)\nGerard Manley Hopkins (28 July 1844 \u2013 8 June 1889) was an English poet and Jesuit priest, whose posthumous fame places him among the leading English poets. His prosody \u2013 notably his concept of sprung rhythm \u2013 established him as an innovator, as did his praise of God through vivid use of imagery and nature.\nOnly after his death did Robert Bridges publish a few of Hopkins's mature poems in anthologies, hoping to prepare for wider acceptance of his style. By 1930 Hopkins's work was seen as one of the most original literary advances of his century. It intrigued such leading 20th-century poets as T. S. Eliot, Dylan Thomas, W. H. Auden, Stephen Spender and Cecil Day-Lewis.\nEarly life and family.\nGerard Manley Hopkins was born in Stratford, Essex (now in Greater London), as the eldest of probably nine children to Manley and Catherine Hopkins, n\u00e9e Smith. He was christened at the Anglican church of St John's, Stratford. His father founded a marine insurance firm and at one time served as Hawaiian consul-general in London. He was also for a time churchwarden at St John-at-Hampstead. His grandfather was the physician John Simm Smith, a university colleague of John Keats, and close friend of the eccentric philanthropist Ann Thwaytes. One of his uncles was Charles Gordon Hopkins, a politician of the Hawaiian Kingdom, and he was a first cousin of the writer, historian and suffragette Isabel Giberne Sieveking.\nAs a poet, Hopkins's father published works including \"A Philosopher's Stone and Other Poems\" (1843), \"Pietas Metrica\" (1849), and \"Spicelegium Poeticum, A Gathering of Verses by Manley Hopkins\" (1892). He reviewed poetry for \"The Times\" and wrote one novel. Catherine (Smith) Hopkins was the daughter of a London physician, particularly fond of music and of reading, especially German philosophy, literature and the novels of Dickens. Both parents were deeply religious high-church Anglicans. Catherine's sister, Maria Smith Giberne, taught her nephew Gerard to sketch. The interest was supported by his uncle, Edward Smith, his great-uncle Richard James Lane, a professional artist, and other family members. Hopkins's initial ambition was to be a painter \u2013 he would continue to sketch throughout his life and was inspired as an adult by the work of John Ruskin and the Pre-Raphaelites.\nHopkins became a skilled draughtsman. He found his early training in visual art supported his later work as a poet. His siblings drew a lot of inspiration from literature, religion, and the arts. In 1878, Milicent (1849\u20131946) enrolled in an Anglican sisterhood. Kate (1856\u20131933) would help Hopkins publish the first edition of his poetry. Hopkins's youngest sister Grace (1857\u20131945) set many of his poems to music. Lionel (1854\u20131952) became a world-famous expert on archaic and colloquial Chinese. Arthur (1848\u20131930) and Everard (1860\u20131928) were highly successful artists. Cyril (1846\u20131932) would join his father's insurance firm.\nManley Hopkins moved his family to Hampstead in 1852, near where John Keats had lived 30 years before and close to the green spaces of Hampstead Heath. When he was ten years old, Gerard was sent to board at Highgate School (1854\u20131863). While studying Keats's poetry, he wrote \"The Escorial\" (1860), his earliest extant poem. Here he practised early attempts at asceticism. He once argued that most people drank more liquids than they really needed and bet that he could go without drinking for a week. He persisted until his tongue was black and he collapsed at drill. On another occasion, he abstained from salt for a week. Among his teachers at Highgate was Richard Watson Dixon, who became an enduring friend and correspondent. Of the older pupils Hopkins recalls in his boarding house, the poet Philip Stanhope Worsley won the Newdigate Prize.\nOxford and priesthood.\nHopkins studied classics at Balliol College, Oxford (1863\u20131867). He began his time in Oxford as a keen socialite and prolific poet but seems to have alarmed himself with resulting changes in his behaviour. There he forged a lifelong friendship with Robert Bridges (later Poet Laureate of the United Kingdom), which would be important to his development as a poet and in establishing his posthumous acclaim. Hopkins was deeply impressed with the work of Christina Rossetti, who became one of his great contemporary influences. The two met in 1864. During this time he studied with the writer and critic Walter Pater, who tutored him in 1866 and remained a friend until Hopkins left Oxford for the second time in October 1879.\nIn a journal entry of 6 November 1865, Hopkins declared an ascetic intention for his life and work: \"On this day by God's grace I resolved to give up all beauty until I had His leave for it.\" On 18 January 1866, Hopkins composed his most ascetic poem, \"The Habit of Perfection\". On 23 January, he included poetry in a list of things to be given up for Lent. In July, he decided to become a Roman Catholic and travelled to Birmingham in September to consult the leader of the Oxford converts, John Henry Newman. Newman received him into the Roman Catholic Church on 21 October 1866.\nThe decision to convert estranged Hopkins from his family and from a number of acquaintances. After graduating in 1867, he was provided by Newman with a teaching post at the Oratory in Birmingham. While there he began to study the violin. On 5 May 1868 Hopkins firmly \"resolved to be a religious.\" Less than a week later, he made a bonfire of his poetry and gave it up almost entirely for seven years. He also felt a call to enter the ministry and decided to become a Jesuit. He paused first to visit Switzerland, which officially forbade Jesuits to enter.\nIn September 1868, Hopkins began his Jesuit novitiate at Manresa House, Roehampton, under the guidance of Alfred Weld. Two years later he moved to St Mary's Hall, he moved thereStonyhurst, for philosophical studies, taking vows of poverty, chastity and obedience on 8 September 1870. He felt that his interest in poetry had stopped him devoting himself wholly to religion. However, on reading Duns Scotus in 1872, he saw how the two need not conflict. He continued to write a detailed prose journal in 1868\u20131875. Unable to suppress a desire to describe the natural world, he also wrote music, sketched, and for church occasions, wrote \"verses\", as he called them. He later wrote sermons and other religious pieces.\nIn 1874, Hopkins returned to Manresa House to teach classics. While studying in the Jesuit house of theological studies, St Beuno's College, near St Asaph in Wales, he was asked by his religious superior to write a poem to commemorate the foundering of a German ship in a storm. So in 1875 he took up poetry once more to write a lengthy piece, \"The Wreck of the Deutschland\", inspired by the \"Deutschland\" incident, a maritime disaster in which 157 people died, including five Franciscan nuns who had been leaving Germany due to harsh anti-Catholic laws (see Kulturkampf). The work displays both the religious concerns and some of the unusual metre and rhythms of his subsequent poetry not present in his few remaining early works. It not only depicts the dramatic events and heroic deeds but tells of him reconciling the terrible events with God's higher purpose. The poem was accepted but not printed by a Jesuit publication. This rejection fed his ambivalence about his poetry, most of which remained unpublished until after his death.\nHopkins chose the austere and restrictive life of a Jesuit and was gloomy at times. His biographer Robert Bernard Martin notes that \"the life expectancy of a man becoming a novice at twenty-one was twenty-three more years rather than the forty years of males of the same age in the general population.\" The brilliant student who had left Oxford with first-class honours failed his final theology exam. This almost certainly meant that despite his ordination in 1877, Hopkins would not progress in the order. In 1877 he wrote \"God's Grandeur\", an array of sonnets that included \"The Starlight Night\". He finished \"The Windhover\" only a few months before his ordination. His life as a Jesuit trainee, though rigorous, isolated and sometimes unpleasant, at least had some stability; the uncertain and varied work after ordination was even harder on his sensibilities. In October 1877, not long after completing \"The Sea and the Skylark\" and only a month after his ordination, Hopkins took up duties as sub-minister and teacher at Mount St Mary's College near Sheffield. In July 1878 he became curate at the Jesuit church in Mount Street, London, and in December that of St Aloysius's Church, Oxford, then moving to Manchester, Liverpool and Glasgow. While ministering in Oxford, he became a founding member of The Newman Society, established in 1878 for Catholic members of the University of Oxford. He taught Greek and Latin at Mount St Mary's College, Sheffield, and Stonyhurst College, Lancashire.\nIn the late 1880s Hopkins met Matthew Russell of the \"Irish Monthly\", who introduced him to Katharine Tynan and W. B. Yeats.\nIn 1884, Hopkins became a professor of Greek and Latin at University College Dublin. His English roots and disagreement with the Irish politics of the time, along with his small stature (), unprepossessing nature and personal oddities, reduced his effectiveness as a teacher. This and his isolation in Ireland deepened a gloom that was reflected in his poems of the time, such as \"I Wake and Feel the Fell of Dark, not Day\". They came to be known as the \"terrible sonnets\", not for their quality but according to Hopkins's friend Canon Richard Watson Dixon, because they reached the \"terrible crystal\", meaning they crystallised the melancholic dejection that plagued the latter part of Hopkins's life.\nFinal years.\nSeveral influences led to a melancholic state and restricted his poetic inspiration in his last five years. His workload was heavy. He disliked living in Dublin, away from England and friends. He was disappointed at how far Dublin had fallen from its Georgian elegance of the previous century. His general health suffered and his eyesight began to fail. He felt confined and dejected. As a devout Jesuit, he found himself in an artistic dilemma. To subdue an egotism that he felt would violate the humility required by his religious position, he decided never to publish his poems but Hopkins realised that any true poet requires an audience for criticism and encouragement. This conflict between his religious obligations and his poetic talent made him feel he had failed at both.\nAfter several years' ill health and bouts of diarrhoea, Hopkins died of typhoid fever in 1889 at the age of 44 years and was buried in Glasnevin Cemetery, after a funeral in St Francis Xavier Church in Gardiner Street, located in Georgian Dublin. He is thought to have suffered throughout his life from what today might be labelled bipolar disorder or chronic unipolar depression and battled a deep sense of melancholic anguish. However, his last words on his deathbed were, \"I am so happy, I am so happy\".\nPoetry.\n\"The sonnets of desolation\".\nAccording to John Bayley, \"All his life Hopkins was haunted by the sense of personal bankruptcy and impotence, the straining of 'time's eunuch' with no more to 'spend'\u00a0...\", a sense of inadequacy, graphically expressed in his last sonnets. Toward the end of his life, Hopkins suffered several long bouts of depression. His \"terrible sonnets\" struggle with problems of religious doubt. He described them to Bridges as \"[t]he thin gleanings of a long weary while\".\n\"Thou Art Indeed Just, Lord\" (1889) echoes \"Jeremiah\" 12:1 in asking why the wicked prosper. It reflects the exasperation of a faithful servant who feels he has been neglected, and is addressed to a divine person (\"Sir\") capable of hearing the complaint, but seemingly unwilling to listen. Hopkins uses parched roots as a metaphor for despair.\nThe image of the poet's estrangement from God figures in \"I wake and feel the fell of dark, not day\", in which he describes lying awake before dawn, likening his prayers to \"dead letters sent To dearest him that lives alas! away.\" The opening line recalls Lamentations 3:2: \"He hath led me, and brought me into darkness, but not into light.\"\n\"No Worst, There is None\" and \"Carrion Comfort\" are also counted among the \"terrible sonnets\".\nSprung rhythm.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;poem&gt;\n\"Pied Beauty\"\nGlory be to God for dappled things\u2014\n For skies of couple-colour as a brinded cow;\n For rose-moles all in stipple upon trout that swim;\nFresh-firecoal chestnut-falls; finches' wings;\n Landscape plotted and pieced\u2014fold, fallow, and plough;\n And \u00e1ll tr\u00e1des, their gear and tackle and trim.\nAll things counter, original, spare, strange;\n Whatever is fickle, freckled (who knows how?)\n With swift, slow; sweet, sour; adazzle, dim;\nHe fathers-forth whose beauty is past change:\n Praise him.&lt;/poem&gt;\n\"Pied Beauty\" written 1877.\nMuch of Hopkins's historical importance has to do with the changes he brought to the form of poetry, which ran contrary to conventional ideas of metre. Prior to Hopkins, most Middle English and Modern English poetry was based on a rhythmic structure inherited from the Norman side of English literary heritage. This structure is based on repeating \"feet\" of two or three syllables, with the stressed syllable falling in the same place on each repetition. Hopkins called this structure \"running rhythm\", and although he wrote some of his early verse in running rhythm, he became fascinated with the older rhythmic structure of the Anglo-Saxon tradition, of which \"Beowulf\" is the most famous example.\nHopkins called his own rhythmic structure sprung rhythm. Sprung rhythm is structured around feet with a variable number of syllables, generally between one and four syllables per foot, with the stress always falling on the first syllable in a foot. It is similar to the \"rolling stresses\" of Robinson Jeffers, another poet who rejected conventional metre. Hopkins saw sprung rhythm as a way to escape the constraints of running rhythm, which he said inevitably pushed poetry written in it to become \"same and tame\". In this way, Hopkins's sprung rhythm can be seen as anticipating much of free verse. His work has no great affinity with either of the contemporary Pre-Raphaelite and neo-romanticism schools, although he does share their descriptive love of nature and he is often seen as a precursor to modernist poetry, or as a bridge between the two poetic eras.\nUse of language.\nHopkins was a supporter of linguistic purism in English. In an 1882 letter to Robert Bridges, Hopkins writes: \"It makes one weep to think what English might have been; for in spite of all that Shakespeare and Milton have done... no beauty in a language can make up for want of purity.\" He took time to learn Old English, which became a major influence on his writing. In the same letter to Bridges he calls Old English \"a vastly superior thing to what we have now.\"\nHe uses many archaic and dialect words but also coins new words. One example of this is \"twindles\", which seems from its context in \"Inversnaid\" to mean a combination of \"twines\" and \"dwindles\". He often creates compound adjectives, sometimes with a hyphen (such as \"dapple-dawn-drawn falcon\") but often without, as in \"rolling level underneath him steady air\". This use of compound adjectives, similar to the Old English use of compound nouns via kennings, concentrates his images, communicating to his readers the instress of the poet's perceptions of an inscape.\nAdded richness comes from Hopkins's extensive use of alliteration, assonance, onomatopoeia and rhyme, both at the end of lines and internally as in:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;&lt;poem&gt;\nAs kingfishers catch fire, dragonflies draw flame;\nAs tumbled over rim in roundy wells\nStones ring; like each tucked string tells, each hung bell's\nBow swung finds tongue to fling out broad its name;\n&lt;/poem&gt;\nHopkins was influenced by the Welsh language, which he had acquired while studying theology at St Beuno's near St Asaph. The poetic forms of Welsh literature and particularly cynghanedd, with its emphasis on repeating sounds, accorded with his own style and became a prominent feature of his work. This reliance on similar-sounding words with close or differing senses means that his poems are best understood if read aloud. An important element in his work is Hopkins' own concept of \"inscape\", which was derived in part from the medieval theologian Duns Scotus. Anthony Domestico explains,Inscape, for Hopkins, is the charged essence, the absolute singularity that gives each created thing its being; instress is both the energy that holds the inscape together and the process by which this inscape is perceived by an observer. We instress the inscape of a tulip, Hopkins would say, when we appreciate the particular delicacy of its petals, when we are enraptured by its specific, inimitable shade of pink.\"\n\"The Windhover\" aims to depict not the bird in general, but instead one instance and its relation to the breeze. This is just one interpretation of Hopkins's most famous poem, one which he felt was his best.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;poem&gt;\nI caught this morning morning's minion, king-\n dom of daylight's dauphin, dapple-dawn-drawn Falcon, in his riding\n Of the rolling level underneath him steady air, and striding\nHigh there, how he rung upon the rein of a wimpling wing\nIn his ecstasy! then off, off forth on swing,\n As a skate's heel sweeps smooth on a bow-bend: the hurl and gliding\n Rebuffed the big wind. My heart in hiding\nStirred for a bird, \u2013 the achieve of, the mastery of the thing!&lt;/poem&gt;\n The first stanza of \"The Windhover\" written 30 May 1877, published 1918.\nDuring his lifetime, Hopkins published a few poems. It was only through the efforts of Robert Bridges that his works were seen. Despite Hopkins burning all his poems on entering the Jesuit novitiate, he had already sent some to Bridges, who with some other friends, was one of the few people to see many of them for some years. After Hopkins's death they were distributed to a wider audience, mostly fellow poets, and in 1918 Bridges, by then poet laureate, published a collected edition; an expanded edition, prepared by Charles Williams, appeared in 1930, and a greatly expanded edition by William Henry Gardner appeared in 1948 (eventually reaching a fourth edition, 1967, with N. H. Mackenzie).\nNotable collections of Hopkins's manuscripts and publications are in Campion Hall, Oxford; the Bodleian Library, Oxford; and the Foley Library at Gonzaga University in Spokane, Washington.\nInfluences.\nErotic.\nIn 1970, Timothy d'Arch Smith, an antiquarian bookseller, ascribed to Hopkins suppressed homoerotic impulses which he views as taking on a degree of specificity after Hopkins met Robert Bridges's distant cousin, friend, and fellow Etonian Digby Mackworth Dolben, \"a Christian Uranian\".\nIn 1991, Robert Bernard Martin wrote in his biography \"Gerard Manley Hopkins: A Very Private Life\", that when Hopkins first met Dolben, on Dolben's 17th birthday in Oxford in February 1865, it \"was, quite simply, the most momentous emotional event of [his] undergraduate years, probably of his entire life.\" According to Robert Martin, \"Hopkins was completely taken with Dolben, who was nearly four years his junior, and his private journal for confessions the following year proves how absorbed he was in imperfectly suppressed erotic thoughts of him.\" Martin considered it \"probable that [Hopkins] would have been deeply shocked at the reality of sexual intimacy with another person.\"\nHopkins had composed two poems about Dolben, \"Where art thou friend\" and \"The Beginning of the End\". Robert Bridges, who edited the first edition of Dolben's poems as well as Hopkins's, cautioned that the second poem \"must never be printed\", though Bridges himself included it in the first edition (1918).\nAnother indication of the nature of his feelings for Dolben is that Hopkins's high Anglican confessor seems to have forbidden him to have any contact with Dolben except by letter. Hopkins never saw Dolben again, and any continuation of their relationship was abruptly ended by Dolben's drowning two years later in June 1867. Hopkins's feeling for Dolben seems to have cooled by that time, but he was nonetheless greatly affected by his death. \"Ironically, fate may have bestowed more through Dolben's death than it could ever have bestowed through longer life ... [for] many of Hopkins's best poems \u2013 impregnated with an elegiac longing for Dolben, his lost beloved and his muse \u2013 were the result.\" Hopkins's relationship with Dolben was explored in the 2017 novel \"The Hopkins Conundrum\".\nSome of Hopkins's poems, such as \"The Bugler's First Communion\" and \"Epithalamion\", arguably embody homoerotic themes, although the second poem was arranged by Robert Bridges from extant fragments. In 2006, M. M. Kaylor, argued for Hopkins's inclusion with the Uranian poets, a group whose writings derived, in many ways, from prose works of Walter Pater, Hopkins's academic coach for his Greats exams and later a lifelong friend.\nSome critics have argued that homoerotic readings are either highly tendentious or that they can be classified under the broader category of \"homosociality\", over the gender, sexual-specific \"homosexual\" term. Hopkins's journal writings, they argue, offer a clear admiration for feminised beauty. In 2000, Justus George Lawler criticised Robert Martin's biography by suggesting that Martin \"cannot see the heterosexual beam... for the homosexual biographical mote in his own eye... it amounts to a slanted eisegesis\". The poems that elicit homoerotic readings can be read not merely as exercises in sublimation but as powerful renditions of religious conviction, a conviction that caused strain in his family and even led him to burn some poems that he felt were unnecessarily self-centred. In 2000, Julia Saville viewed the religious imagery in the poems as Hopkins's way of expressing the tension with homosexual identity and desire.\nChristopher Ricks noted that Hopkins engaged in a number of penitential practices, \"but all of these self-inflictions were not self-inflictions to him, and they are his business \u2013 or are his understanding of what it was for him to be about his Father's business.\" Ricks takes issue with Martin's apparent lack of appreciation of the importance of the role of Hopkins's religious commitment to his writing, and cautions against assigning a priority of influence to any sexual instincts over other factors such as Hopkins's estrangement from his family. In 2009, biographer Paul Mariani found in Hopkins poems \"an irreconcilable tension \u2013 on the one hand, the selflessness demanded by Jesuit discipline; on the other, the seeming self-indulgence of poetic creation.\"\nIsolation.\nHopkins spent the last five years of his life as a classics professor at University College Dublin. Hopkins's isolation in 1885 was multiple: a Jesuit distanced from his Anglican family and his homeland, an Englishman teaching in Dublin during a time of political strife, and an unpublished poet striving to reconcile his artistic and religious callings. The poem \"To seem the stranger\" was written in Ireland between 1885 and 1886 and is a poem of isolation and loneliness.\nInfluence on others.\nRicks called Hopkins \"the most original poet of the Victorian age.\" Hopkins is considered as influential as T. S. Eliot in initiating the modernist movement in poetry. His experiments with elliptical phrasing, double meanings and quirky conversational rhythms turned out to be liberating to poets such as W. H. Auden and Dylan Thomas. Hopkins also had a direct influence on the Ghanaian poet and novelist Kojo Laing, whose poem \"No needle in the sky\" has been called an intercultural translation of Hopkins's \"The Windhover\". The American author Ron Hansen held the Gerard Manley Hopkins, SJ, Professorship in English at Santa Clara University; his novel \"Exiles\" dramatises Hopkins' composition of \"The Wreck of the Deutschland.\"\nThe Gerard Manley Hopkins Building in University College Dublin is named after him.\nSelected poems.\nWell-known works by Hopkins include:\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The prefixes \"\"cis\" and \"trans\"\" are from Latin: \"this side of\" and \"the other side of\", respectively. In the context of chemistry, \"cis\" indicates that the functional groups (substituents) are on the same side of some plane, while \"trans\" conveys that they are on opposing (transverse) sides. \"Cis\"\u2013\"trans\" isomers are stereoisomers, that is, pairs of molecules which have the same formula but whose functional groups are in different orientations in three-dimensional space. \"Cis\" and \"trans\" isomers occur both in organic molecules and in inorganic coordination complexes. \"Cis\" and \"trans\" descriptors are not used for cases of conformational isomerism where the two geometric forms easily interconvert, such as most open-chain single-bonded structures; instead, the terms \"\"syn\" and \"anti\"\" are used.\nAccording to IUPAC, \"geometric isomerism\" is an obsolete synonym of \"\"cis\"\u2013\"trans\" isomerism\".\n\"Cis\u2013trans\" or geometric isomerism is classified as one type of configurational isomerism.\nOrganic chemistry.\nVery often, \"cis\"\u2013\"trans\" stereoisomers contain double bonds or ring structures. In both cases the rotation of bonds is restricted or prevented. When the substituent groups are oriented in the same direction, the diastereomer is referred to as \"cis\", whereas when the substituents are oriented in opposing directions, the diastereomer is referred to as \"trans\". An example of a small hydrocarbon displaying \"cis\"\u2013\"trans\" isomerism is but-2-ene. 1,2-Dichlorocyclohexane is another example.\nComparison of physical properties.\n\"Cis\" and \"trans\" isomers have distinct physical properties. Their differing shapes influences the dipole moments, boiling, and especially melting points.\nThese differences can be very small, as in the case of the boiling point of straight-chain alkenes, such as pent-2-ene, which is 37\u00a0\u00b0C in the \"cis\" isomer and 36\u00a0\u00b0C in the \"trans\" isomer. The differences between \"cis\" and \"trans\" isomers can be larger if polar bonds are present, as in the 1,2-dichloroethenes. The \"cis\" isomer in this case has a boiling point of 60.3\u00a0\u00b0C, while the \"trans\" isomer has a boiling point of 47.5\u00a0\u00b0C. In the \"cis\" isomer the two polar C\u2013Cl bond dipole moments combine to give an overall molecular dipole, so that there are intermolecular dipole\u2013dipole forces (or Keesom forces), which add to the London dispersion forces and raise the boiling point. In the \"trans\" isomer on the other hand, this does not occur because the two C\u2212Cl bond moments cancel and the molecule has a net zero dipole moment (it does however have a non-zero quadrupole moment).\nThe differing properties of the two isomers of butenedioic acid are often very different. \nPolarity is key in determining relative boiling point as strong intermolecular forces raise the boiling point. In the same manner, symmetry is key in determining relative melting point as it allows for better packing in the solid state, even if it does not alter the polarity of the molecule. Another example of this is the relationship between oleic acid and elaidic acid; oleic acid, the \"cis\" isomer, has a melting point of 13.4\u00a0\u00b0C, making it a liquid at room temperature, while the \"trans\" isomer, elaidic acid, has the much higher melting point of 43\u00a0\u00b0C, due to the straighter \"trans\" isomer being able to pack more tightly, and is solid at room temperature.\nThus, \"trans\" alkenes, which are less polar and more symmetrical, have lower boiling points and higher melting points, and \"cis\" alkenes, which are generally more polar and less symmetrical, have higher boiling points and lower melting points.\nIn the case of geometric isomers that are a consequence of double bonds, and, in particular, when both substituents are the same, some general trends usually hold. These trends can be attributed to the fact that the dipoles of the substituents in a \"cis\" isomer will add up to give an overall molecular dipole. In a \"trans\" isomer, the dipoles of the substituents will cancel out due to being on opposite sides of the molecule. \"Trans\" isomers also tend to have lower densities than their \"cis\" counterparts.\nAs a general trend, \"trans\" alkenes tend to have higher melting points and lower solubility in inert solvents, as \"trans\" alkenes, in general, are more symmetrical than \"cis\" alkenes.\nVicinal coupling constants (3\"J\"HH), measured by NMR spectroscopy, are larger for \"trans\" (range: 12\u201318\u00a0Hz; typical: 15\u00a0Hz) than for \"cis\" (range: 0\u201312\u00a0Hz; typical: 8\u00a0Hz) isomers.\nStability.\nUsually for acyclic systems \"trans\" isomers are more stable than \"cis\" isomers. This difference is attributed to the unfavorable steric interaction of the substituents in the \"cis\" isomer. Therefore, \"trans\" isomers have a less-exothermic heat of combustion, indicating higher thermochemical stability. In the Benson heat of formation group additivity dataset, \"cis\" isomers suffer a 1.10\u00a0kcal/mol stability penalty. Exceptions to this rule exist, such as 1,2-difluoroethylene, 1,2-difluorodiazene (FN=NF), and several other halogen- and oxygen-substituted ethylenes. In these cases, the \"cis\" isomer is more stable than the \"trans\" isomer. This phenomenon is called the \"cis effect\".\n\"E\"\u2013\"Z\" notation.\nIn principle, \"cis\"\u2013\"trans\" notation should not be used for alkenes with two or more different substituents. Instead the \"E\"\u2013\"Z\" notation is used based on the priority of the substituents using the Cahn\u2013Ingold\u2013Prelog (CIP) priority rules for absolute configuration. The IUPAC standard designations \"E\" and \"Z\" are unambiguous in all cases, and therefore are especially useful for tri- and tetrasubstituted alkenes to avoid any confusion about which groups are being identified as \"cis\" or \"trans\" to each other.\n\"Z\" (from the German ) means \"together\". \"E\" (from the German ) means \"opposed\" in the sense of \"opposite\". That is, \"Z\" has the higher-priority groups \"cis\" to each other and \"E\" has the higher-priority groups \"trans\" to each other. Whether a molecular configuration is designated \"E\" or \"Z\" is determined by the CIP rules; higher atomic numbers are given higher priority. For each of the two atoms in the double bond, it is necessary to determine the priority of each substituent. If both the higher-priority substituents are on the same side, the arrangement is \"Z\"; if on opposite sides, the arrangement is \"E\".\nBecause the \"cis\"\u2013\"trans\" and \"E\"\u2013\"Z\" systems compare different groups on the alkene, it is not strictly true that \"Z\" corresponds to \"cis\" and \"E\" corresponds to \"trans\". For example, \"trans\"-2-chlorobut-2-ene (the two methyl groups, C1 and C4, on the but-2-ene backbone are \"trans\" to each other) is (\"Z\")-2-chlorobut-2-ene (the chlorine and C4 are together because C1 and C4 are opposite).\nUndefined alkene stereochemistry.\nWavy single bonds are the standard way to represent unknown or unspecified stereochemistry or a mixture of isomers (as with tetrahedral stereocenters). A crossed double-bond has been used sometimes; it is no longer considered an acceptable style for general use by IUPAC but may still be required by computer software.\nInorganic chemistry.\n\"Cis\"\u2013\"trans\" isomerism can also occur in inorganic compounds.\nDiazenes.\nDiazenes (and the related diphosphenes) can also exhibit \"cis\"\u2013\"trans\" isomerism. As with organic compounds, the \"cis\" isomer is generally the more reactive of the two, being the only isomer that can reduce alkenes and alkynes to alkanes, but for a different reason: the \"trans\" isomer cannot line its hydrogens up suitably to reduce the alkene, but the \"cis\" isomer, being shaped differently, can.\nCoordination complexes.\nCoordination complexes with octahedral or square planar geometries can also exhibit \"cis-trans\" isomerism.\nFor example, there are two isomers of square planar Pt(NH3)2Cl2, as explained by Alfred Werner in 1893. The \"cis\" isomer, whose full name is \"cis\"-diamminedichloroplatinum(II), was shown in 1969 by Barnett Rosenberg to have antitumor activity, and is now a chemotherapy drug known by the short name cisplatin. In contrast, the \"trans\" isomer (transplatin) has no useful anticancer activity. Each isomer can be synthesized using the trans effect to control which isomer is produced.\nFor octahedral complexes of formula MX4Y2, two isomers also exist. (Here M is a metal atom, and X and Y are two different types of ligands.) In the \"cis\" isomer, the two Y ligands are adjacent to each other at 90\u00b0, as is true for the two chlorine atoms shown in green in \"cis\"-[Co(NH3)4Cl2]+, at left. In the \"trans\" isomer shown at right, the two Cl atoms are on opposite sides of the central Co atom.\nA related type of isomerism in octahedral MX3Y3 complexes is\nfacial\u2013meridional (or \"fac\"\u2013\"mer\") isomerism, in which different numbers of ligands are \"cis\" or \"trans\" to each other. Metal carbonyl compounds can be characterized as \"fac\" or \"mer\" using infrared spectroscopy.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It is preserved in the Codex Regius manuscript and the AM 748 I 4to fragment. It is spoken through the voice of \"Gr\u00edmnir\", one of the many guises of the god Odin. The very name suggests guise, or mask or hood. Through an error, King Geirr\u00f6th tortured Odin-as-Gr\u00edmnir, a fatal mistake, since Odin caused him to fall upon his own sword. The poem is written mostly in the lj\u00f3\u00f0ah\u00e1ttr metre, typical for wisdom verse.\nStructure and history.\nThe work starts out with a lengthy prose section describing the circumstances leading up to Gr\u00edmnir's monologue. The monologue itself comprises 54 stanzas of poetic verse describing the worlds and Odin's many guises. The third and last part of the poem is also prose, a brief description of Geirr\u00f6th's demise, his son's ascension, and Odin's disappearance. \nThe prose sections were most likely not part of the original oral versions of Gr\u00edmnism\u00e1l. Henry Adams Bellows suggests that they were added in the 12th or 13th century and based on some sort of narrative tradition regarding the poem. This is not entirely certain. The poem itself was likely composed in the first half of the 10th century.\nSynopsis.\nOdin and his wife, Frigg, were sitting in Hlidskjalf, looking out on the worlds. They turned their eyes towards King Geirr\u00f6th, who was reigning in the stead of his late father, King Hrauthung. Geirr\u00f6th and his older brother Agnarr had been raised by Odin and Frigg, respectively. The god and goddess had disguised themselves as a peasant and his wife, and had taught the children wisdom. Geirr\u00f6th returned to his father's kingdom where he became king upon his father's death, while Agnarr dwelt with a giantess in a cave.\nIn Hli\u00f0skj\u00e1lf, Odin remarked to Frigg that his foster-child Geirr\u00f6th seemed to be prospering more so than her Agnarr. Frigg retorted that Geirr\u00f6th was so parsimonious and inhospitable that he would torture his guests if he thought there were too many of them. Odin disputed this, and the couple entered into a wager in this respect. Frigg then sent her maid Fulla to Geirr\u00f6th, advising him that a magician would soon enter his court to bewitch him, and saying that he could be recognised by the fact that no dog was fierce enough to attack him.\nGeirr\u00f6th heeded Fulla's false warning. He ordered his men to capture the man the dogs wouldn't attack, which they did. Odin-as-Gr\u00edmnir, dressed in a dark blue cloak, allowed himself to be captured. He stated that his name was Gr\u00edmnir, but he would say nothing further of himself.\nGeirr\u00f6th then had him tortured to force him to speak, putting him between two fires for eight nights. After this time, Geirr\u00f6th's son, named Agnarr after the king's brother, came to Gr\u00edmnir and gave him a full horn from which to drink, saying that his father, the king, was not right to torture him.\nGr\u00edmnir then spoke, saying that he had suffered eight days and nights, without succour from any save Agnarr, Geirr\u00f6th's son, whom Gr\u00edmnir prophesied would be Lord of the Goths. He then revealed himself for who he was, as the Highest One, promising Agnarr reward for the drink which he brought him.\nShifting from prose to poetry for Odin-as-Gr\u00edmnir's monologue, Gr\u00edmnir describes at great length the cosmogony of the worlds, the dwelling places of its inhabitants, and himself and his many guises.\nEventually, Gr\u00edmnir turns to Geirr\u00f6th and promises him misfortune, revealing his true identity. Geirr\u00f6th then realized the magnitude of his mistake. Having learned that he is undone, he rose quickly to pull Odin from the fires, but the sword which he had lain upon his knee slipped and fell hilt down, so that when the king stumbled he impaled himself upon it. Odin then vanished, and Agnarr, son of the dead King Geirr\u00f6th, ruled in his father's stead.\nIn popular culture.\nThe 12th album of the comic Valhalla is loosely based on the poem.\nIn the 2017 Starz television adaptation of Neil Gaiman's \"American Gods\", the character Mad Sweeney refers to Mr. Wednesday as Grimnir. Mr. Wednesday later emulates Odin's reveal of his identity through his various names when revealing his own true nature.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He secured a major role as struggling writer Paul Varjak when he starred alongside Audrey Hepburn in \"Breakfast at Tiffany's\" (1961), and later portrayed a character based on Howard Hughes in \"The Carpetbaggers\" (1964). On television, he played the title role of millionaire insurance investigator and sleuth Thomas Banacek in the early-1970s mystery series \"Banacek\". He played Col. John \"Hannibal\" Smith, the cigar-smoking leader of a renegade commando squad in the 1980s action television series \"The A-Team\".\nEarly life.\nGeorge Peppard Jr. was born October 1, 1928, in Detroit, the son of building contractor George Peppard Sr and music voice teacher Vernelle Rohrer Peppard. His mother had five miscarriages before giving birth to George. His family lost all their money in the Depression, and his father had to leave George and his mother in Detroit while he went looking for work. Peppard grew up in the Detroit suburb of Dearborn, Michigan. He graduated from Dearborn High School in 1946.\nPeppard enlisted in the United States Marine Corps on July 8, 1946, and rose to the rank of corporal, leaving the Corps at the end of his enlistment in January 1948.\nDuring 1948 and 1949, he studied civil engineering at Purdue University where he was a member of the Purdue Playmakers theatre troupe and Beta Theta Pi fraternity. He became interested in acting, being an admirer of Walter Huston in particular. \"I just decided I didn't want to be an engineer,\" he said later. \"It was the best decision I ever made.\"\nPeppard then transferred to Carnegie Institute of Technology (now Carnegie Mellon University) in Pittsburgh, where he earned his bachelor's degree in 1955. (It took longer than normal because he dropped out for a year when his father died in 1951 and he had to finish his father's jobs.) He also trained at the Pittsburgh Playhouse. While living in Pittsburgh, Peppard worked as a radio DJ at WLOA in Braddock, Pennsylvania. While giving a weather update, he famously called incoming snow flurries \"flow snurries\". This was an anecdote he repeated in several later interviews, including one with former NFL player Rocky Bleier for WPXI.\nIn addition to acting, Peppard was a pilot. He spent a portion of his 1966 honeymoon training to fly his Learjet in Wichita, Kansas.\nCareer.\nTheatre.\nPeppard made his stage debut in 1949 at the Pittsburgh Playhouse. After moving to New York City, Peppard enrolled in the Actors Studio, where he studied the Method with Lee Strasberg. He did a variety of jobs to pay his way during this time, such as working as a disc jockey, being a radio station engineer, teaching fencing, driving a taxi and being a mechanic in a motorcycle repair shop.\nHe worked in summer stock in New England and appeared at the open air Oregon Shakespeare Festival in Ashland, Oregon for two seasons.\nIn August 1955, he appeared in the play \"The Sun Dial\".\nEarly television appearances and transition to film.\nHe worked as a cab driver until getting his first part in \"Lamp Unto My Feet\". He appeared with Paul Newman, in \"The United States Steel Hour\" (1956), as the singing, guitar-playing baseball player Piney Woods in \"Bang the Drum Slowly\", directed by Daniel Petrie.\nHe appeared in an episode of \"Kraft Theatre\", \"Flying Object at Three O'Clock High\" (1956).\nIn March 1956, Peppard was on stage, off Broadway, in \"Beautiful Changes\".\nIn April 1956, he appeared in a segment of an episode of \"Cameras Three\" performing from \"The Shoemaker's Holiday\"; \"The New York Times\" called his performance \"beguiling\".\nIn July 1956, he signed to make his film debut in \"The Strange One\" directed by Jack Garfein, based on the play \"End as a Man\". It was the first film from Garfein as director and Calder Willingham as producer, plus for Peppard, Ben Gazzara, Geoffrey Horne, Pat Hingle, Arthur Storch and Clifton James. Filming took place in Florida. \"I wouldn't say I was nervous,\" said Peppard, \"just excited.\"\nOn his return to New York, he performed in \"Out to Kill\" on TV for \"Kraft\". In September he joined the cast of \"Girls of Summer\" directed by Jack Garfein with Shelley Winters, Storch and Hingle, plus a title song by Stephen Sondheim. This reached Broadway in November. Brooks Atkinson said Peppard \"expertly plays a sly, malicious dance teacher.\" It had only a short run.\nThe bulk of his work around this time was for television: \"The Kaiser Aluminum Hour\" (\"A Real Fine Cutting Edge\", directed by George Roy Hill), \"Studio One in Hollywood\" (\"A Walk in the Forest\"), \"The Alcoa Hour\" (\"The Big Build-Up\" with E. G. Marshall), \"Matinee Theatre\" (\"End of the Rope\" with John Drew Barrymore, \"Thread That Runs So True\", \"Aftermath\"), \"Kraft Theatre\" (\"The Long Flight\"), \"Alfred Hitchcock Presents\" (\"The Diplomatic Corpse\", with Peter Lorre directed by Paul Henreid), and \"Suspicion\" (\"The Eye of Truth\" with Joseph Cotten based on a script by Eric Ambler). \"The Strange One\" came out in April 1957 but despite some strong reviews \u2013 \"The New York Times\" called Peppard \"resolute\". \u2013 it was not a financial success.\nIn September 1957, he appeared in a trial run of a play by Robert Thom, \"The Minotaur\", directed by Sidney Lumet.\nPeppard played a key role in \"Little Moon of Alban\" (1958) alongside Christopher Plummer for the \"Hallmark Hall of Fame\". The \"Los Angeles Times\" called him \"excellent\".\nIn May 1958, Peppard played his second film role, a support part in the Korean War movie \"Pork Chop Hill\" (1959) directed by Lewis Milestone. He was cast in part because he was unfamiliar to moviegoers.\nIn May 1958, he appeared in stock in \"A Swim in the Sea\".\nIn October 1958, Peppard appeared on Broadway in \"The Pleasure of His Company\" (1958) starring Cyril Ritchard, who also directed. Peppard played the boyfriend who wants to marry Dolores Hart who was Ritchard's daughter; \"The New York Times\" called Peppard \"admirable\". The play was a hit and ran for a year.\nDuring the show's run, Peppard auditioned successfully for MGM's \"Home from the Hill\" (1960) and the studio signed him to a long-term contract \u2013 which he had not wanted to do but was a condition for the film. In February 1959, Hedda Hopper announced Peppard would leave \"Company\" to make two films for MGM: \"Home from the Hill\" and \"The Subterraneans\".\n\"Home from the Hill\" was a prestigious film directed by Vincente Minnelli and starring Robert Mitchum, who played Peppard's father. It featured several young actors MGM were hoping to develop, including Peppard, George Hamilton, and Luana Patten. During filming, Peppard said \"Brando is a dead talent \u2013 I saw him in \"The Young Lions\"\" \u2013 but said Peck is \"a man of integrity as a star and a person. Lee Strasberg is the only person I know who is brilliant.\"\n\"I want to be an actor and proud of my craft\", said Peppard. \"I would like to be an actor who is starred but being a star is something you can't count on whereas acting is something I can work on.\" It was a success at the box office, although the film's high cost meant that it was not profitable.\nPeppard's next film for MGM was \"The Subterraneans\", an adaptation of the 1958 novel by Jack Kerouac co starring Leslie Caron. It flopped and Peppard said \"I couldn't get arrested\" afterwards.\nHe had meant to follow \"The Subterraneans\" by returning to Broadway with Julie Harris in \"The Warm Peninsular\" but this did not happen. In April 1959 Hedda Hopper said he would be in \"Chatauqua\" but that was not made until a decade later, starring Elvis Presley, as \"The Trouble with Girls\" (1969). At the end of 1959 Hopper predicted Peppard would be a big star saying \"he has great emotional power, is a fine athlete, and does offbeat characters such as James Dean excelled in.\" Sol Siegel announced he would play the lead in \"Two Weeks in Another Town\". (Kirk Douglas ended up playing it.) He was also announced for the role of Arthur Blake in a film about the first Olympics called \"And Seven from America\" which was never made.\nPeppard returned to television to star in an episode of the anthology series \"Startime\", \"Incident at a Corner\" (1960) under the direction of Alfred Hitchcock alongside Vera Miles.\nHe played Teddy Roosevelt on television in an episode of \"Our American Heritage\", \"The Invincible Teddy\" (1961).\nStardom.\nHis good looks, elegant manner and acting skills landed Peppard his most famous film role as Paul Varjak in \"Breakfast at Tiffany's\" with Audrey Hepburn, based on the novella of the same name by Truman Capote. Director Blake Edwards had not wanted Peppard, but was overruled by the producers. He was cast in July 1960. During filming Peppard did not get along with Hepburn or Patricia Neal, the latter calling him \"cold and conceited\".\nIn November 1961, a newspaper article dubbed him \"the next big thing\". Peppard said he had turned down two TV series and was \"concentrating on big screen roles.\" His contract with MGM was for two pictures a year, allowing for one outside film and six TV appearances a year, plus the right to star in a play every second year. \"In a series you don't have time to develop a character,\" he said. \"There's no build up; in the first segment you're already established.\"\nHe was meant to appear in \"Unarmed in Paradise\" which was not made. He bought a script by Robert Blees called \"Baby Talk\" but it was also unmade.\nInstead, MGM cast him in the lead of their epic western \"How the West Was Won\" in 1962.(His character spanned three sections of the episodic Cinerama extravaganza.) It was a massive hit.\nHe followed this with a war story for Carl Foreman, \"The Victors\" (1963), made in Europe. He was offered $200,000 to appear in \"The Long Ships\" but did not want to go to Yugoslavia for six months. He was going to do \"Next Time We Love\" with Ross Hunter but it was never made.\nHe starred in \"The Carpetbaggers\", a 150-minute saga of a ruthless, Hughes-like aviation and film mogul based on the best-selling novel of the same name by Harold Robbins. The cast included Elizabeth Ashley, who had an affair with Peppard during filming and later married him. She described him as \"some kind of Nordic god \u2013 six feet tall with beautiful blond hair, blue eyes and a body out of every high school cheerleader's teenage lust fantasy.\" Ashley claimed Peppard \"was never late on set and he had nothing but scorn for actors who weren't professional enough to keep that together.\"\nShe added that Peppard:\nNever was one of those actors who believes his job is to take the money, hit the mark and say the lines and let it go at that. He felt that as an above-the-title star he had the responsibility to use his muscle and power to try and make it better and that has never stopped in him. He was unrelenting about it, to the point where a lot of executives and directors came to feel he was a pain in the ass. But the really talented people loved working with him because of all his wonderful creative energy.\n\"My performances bore me\", said Peppard in a 1964 interview, adding that his ambition was to deliver \"one great performance. And I must say I feel a little presumptuous to shoot for that. But that's the goal, like a hockey goal. I figure I've got a choice ... not of the outcome but of the objective. And my objective is that one performance.\"\nPeppard returned to television to do \"Bob Hope Presents the Chrysler Theatre\", \"The Game with Glass Pieces\". In March 1964 he tried to break his MGM contract to make \"The Great Adventure\" for Anthony Mann.\nFor MGM, he appeared in \"Operation Crossbow\" (1965), a war film with Sophia Loren. It was the first film he made under a new contract with MGM to do one movie a year for three years.\nHe was meant to follow this with an adaptation of the play \"Merrily We Roll Along\" but it was never made.\n\"I'm an actor not a star,\" he said around this time, adding that he looked for \"three things\" in a film, \"a good director, a good part and a good script. If I get two out of three of those I'm satisfied.\"\nPeppard starred in a thriller, \"The Third Day\" (1965) with Ashley who had become his second wife. The film was directed by Jack Smight who claimed Warner Bros only agreed to finance it because they had a deal with Peppard. Peppard said when he made the film \"I wasn't just broke I was up to my ears in debt.\"\nHe was announced for \"The Last Night of Don Juan\" for Michael Gordon but it was not made. He was cast as the lead in \"Sands of the Kalahari\" (1965) at a fee of $200,000 but walked off the set after only a few days of filming in March 1965 and had to be replaced by Stuart Whitman. Paramount sued Peppard for $930,555 in damages and he countersued.\nAshley later wrote:\nWhat tormented George so badly was that he was caught between being an actor and a movie star. He did not start off as an untalented pretty nothing who had to be grateful for any piece of meat that was thrown his way. He was intelligent and talented but because he was six foot tall with blond hair and blue eyes he had been put in the slot of being a movie star at a time when the movie studios were still very powerful and expected you to play the game by their rules ... I don't think it was possible to be a male movie star who looked like he did and got hot when he did and not be trapped by it.\nHe had a huge hit with \"The Blue Max\" (1966), playing a German World War One ace, alongside James Mason and Ursula Andress, directed by John Guillermin.\nFilm critic David Shipman writes of this stage in his career:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\"With his cool, blond baby-face looks and a touch of menace, of meanness, he had established a screen persona as strong as any of the time. He might have been the Alan Ladd or the Richard Widmark of the sixties: but the sixties didn't want a new Alan Ladd. Peppard began appearing in a series of action movies, predictably as a tough guy, but there were much tougher guys around\u00a0\u2014 like Cagney, Bogart and Robinson, whose films had now become television staples.\"\nPeppard played a German Jew fighting for the Allies in \"Tobruk\" (1967) alongside Rock Hudson. \"It's a big mistake to think I'm making a lot of money and turning out a lot of crap,\" he said in a 1966 interview.\nDecline.\nSeeking to ensure his financial security, Peppard bought a cattle ranch. The funding required by this venture prompted Peppard to sign a multi-million-dollar, five-picture contract with Universal in August 1966 \u2013 two films for the first year, then one each in the following three. Ashley claimed this ultimately hurt Peppard's career.\nThe first two films under the contract were \"Rough Night in Jericho\" (1967), a Western with Dean Martin, and \"What's So Bad About Feeling Good?\" (1968), a comedy directed by George Seaton with Mary Tyler Moore; these were followed by a detective film directed by Guillermin, \"P.J.\" (1968), and \"House of Cards\" (1968), a thriller directed by Guillermin and shot in Europe. None of these films was particularly successful at the box office. Ashley says that doing these films caused Peppard to start drinking. She also claimed Peppard turned down \"The Heart Is a Lonely Hunter\" because he did not want to play a weak or possibly homosexual character.\nIn 1967, he bought the script \"Midnight Fair\" by Sheridan Greenway, to produce. In 1968, he announced that he had co-written a script, \"Watch Them Die\", which he planned to direct, but not play a starring role in. It was never made. Neither was a version of \"The Most Dangerous Game\" for MGM, announced in 1967.\nPeppard starred in the crime drama \"Pendulum\" (1969), directed by George Schaefer with Jean Seberg, and traveled to England to star in \"The Executioner\" (1970) opposite Joan Collins. In \"Cannon for Cordoba\" (1970), Peppard played the steely Captain Rod Douglas, who has been put in charge of gathering a group of soldiers on a dangerous mission into Mexico. His fees for these were $400,000 plus a percentage. He was scheduled to make \"The Plot\" at Fox but this does not seem to have been made.\nPeppard instead was in \"One More Train to Rob\" (1971), another Western, at Universal. Ashley wrote \"he became more and more frustrated and disillusioned from hating the kind of pictures he had to do. There were no good scripts, no good directors and at some point it became icily clear that there weren't going to be any.\"\nIn September 1970, he toured Vietnam with a USO show.\nReturn to TV.\nIn March 1971, Peppard announced that his company, Tradewind Productions, had optioned a novel by Stanley Ellin, \"The Eighth Circle\", but it was not made.\nPeppard starred in a Western TV movie \"The Bravos\" (1972) with Pernell Roberts. He returned to features with \"The Groundstar Conspiracy\" (1972) co-starring Michael Sarrazin, shot in Canada for Universal; Peppard's fee was $400,000.\nIn August 1971, Peppard signed to star in \"Banacek\" (1972\u20131974), part of \"The NBC Mystery Movie\" series, starring in 90-minute whodunits as a wealthy Boston playboy who solves thefts for insurance companies for a finder's fee. Sixteen regular episodes were produced over two seasons. Peppard also did some second unit directing. \"Ever since \"The Carpetbaggers\" I've played the iron-jawed cold-eyed killer and that gets to be a goddamned bore,\" he said in 1972. \"Acting is not the most creative thing in the world and when you play a man of action it gets to be a long day. Banacek is the best character I've played in a long time.\"\nIn February 1972, Peppard stood trial in Boston, accused of attempting to rape a stripper in his hotel room. He was cleared of the charges. The same year, he and Ashley were divorced, with Peppard to pay her $2,000 per month alimony plus $350 per month child support for their son Christian.\nPeppard starred in \"Newman's Law\" (1974), an action film originally called \"Newman\". When \"Banacek\" ended Peppard wanted to take time off to focus on producing and directing, including a project called \"The Total Beast\". However alimony and child support obligations forced him back to acting. He made some TV movies \"One of Our Own\" (1975), a medical drama, and \"\" (1975), as Sam Sheppard, for which his fee was $100,000. \"One of Our Own\" had been a pilot for a TV series which was picked up \u2013 \"Doctors' Hospital\" (1975) lasted 15 episodes.\nPeppard starred in the science-fiction film \"Damnation Alley\" (1977), which has gone on to attain a substantial cult following in the years since. Peppard's role in the film was reportedly turned down by Steve McQueen because of salary issues. The movie cost $8.5 million. Peppard said Jack Smight's original director's cut was \"wonderful\" but claimed many of the key scenes in the film were cut when it was re-edited by executives.\nWith fewer interesting roles coming his way, he acted in, directed and produced the drama \"Five Days from Home\" in 1979.\n\"Five Days from Home\".\nPeppard later said the low point of his career came over a three-year period around the time of \"Five Days from Home\". \"It was a bad time\", he said in 1983. \"I was heavily in debt. My career seemed to be going nowhere. Not much work over a three-year period. Every morning I'd wake up and realize I was getting deeper and deeper into debt\".\nHe had to sell his car and take out a second mortgage on his home to finance \"Five Days from Home\". Eventually, he got his money back and was able to concentrate on his career.\"I'm quite proud of it\", he said in 1979. \"I sold many assets to help make it but I don't mind. It was the best time of my life.\"\nHe had the lead in the TV movies \"Crisis in Mid-air\" (1979) and \"Torn Between Two Lovers\" (1979) and went to Europe for \"From Hell to Victory\" (1979).\nIn a rare game show appearance, Peppard did a week of shows on \"Password Plus\" in 1979, in which he could often be seen smoking cigarettes while filming. Out of five shows, the first was never broadcast on NBC, but aired much later on GSN and Buzzr, because of on-camera comments made by Peppard regarding personal dissatisfaction he felt related to his treatment by the NBC officials who supervised the production of \"Password Plus\". As a result of this, Goodson-Todman banned Peppard from appearing on any of their game shows ever again for that incident, which cost them a lot since they had to film an extra episode two weeks later to make up for the pulled episode.\nIn April 1979, Peppard said \"I want to act again \u2013 and I need a good role. The Sam Shepherd story I did for TV was the only good role I've had in the last seven to ten years.\" He added he was developing two movies and a TV drama series plus an educational series.\n\"Dynasty\".\nIn 1980, Peppard was offered, and accepted, the role of Blake Carrington in the television series \"Dynasty\". During the filming of the pilot episode, which also featured Linda Evans and Bo Hopkins, Peppard repeatedly clashed with the show's producers, Richard and Esther Shapiro; among other things, he felt that his role was too similar to that of J. R. Ewing in the series \"Dallas\". Three weeks later, before filming of additional episodes was set to begin, Peppard was fired and the part was offered to John Forsythe; the scenes with Peppard were re-shot and Forsythe became the permanent star of the show. Joan Collins says she was pleased he didn't get the role as she \"hated him\" following an alleged sexual assault incident.\n\"It was a big blow,\" Peppard noted subsequently, adding he felt Forsythe ultimately did \"a better job (as Blake Carrington) than I could have done.\" Ironically, this led to his being available to be cast in NBC's \"The A-Team\", the number one rated television show in its first season in 1982.\n\"I'm so glad I wasn't drinking\", he said later, having stopped in 1979. \"I bet a lot of people thought when I did certain things, I had been drinking and now they found out it wasn't the booze at all. It was me.\"\nDuring that same period, Peppard also had a role as a cowboy in the science fiction film \"Battle Beyond the Stars\" (1980). He travelled to Canada to make \"Your Ticket Is No Longer Valid\" (1981) with Richard Harris, to New Zealand for \"Race for the Yankee Zephyr\" (1982) and Spain for \"Hit Man\" (1982).\n\"I almost disappeared for awhile, between ages 45 and 55\", he later reflected. \"Nobody wants to work with someone who quits three series. They think you're insane to quit a series with all the millions of dollars to be made there. It gets to be like crossing the mob. You find out some people you thought were your friends aren't really.\"\n\"The A-Team\".\nIn 1982, Peppard auditioned for and won the role of Colonel John \"Hannibal\" Smith in the television action adventure series \"The A-Team\", acting alongside Mr. T, Dirk Benedict and Dwight Schultz. In the series, the A-Team was a team of renegade commandos on the run from the military for \"a crime they did not commit\" while serving in the Vietnam War. The A-Team members made their collective living as soldiers of fortune, but they helped only people who came to them with justified grievances.\nAs \"Hannibal\" Smith, Peppard played the leader of the A-Team, distinguished by his cigar smoking, confident smirk, black leather gloves, disguises, and distinctive catchphrase, \"I love it when a plan comes together.\" Peppard was attracted to the role partly because Smith was a master of disguise enabling Peppard to play a variety of characters. \"I love the character of Hannibal,\" he said. \"It inspires my fantasy. And, frankly, I need the money.\"\n\"I wanted to change from leading man to character actor for years now but have never been given the chance before\", he added.\nThe show started filming in late 1982 and premiered in January 1983. It was an instant ratings success, going straight into the top ten most watched shows in the country. The series, which ran for five seasons on NBC from 1983 to 1987, made Peppard known to a new generation and is arguably his best-known role. His fee was reportedly $50,000 an episode. This went up to $65,000, making him one of the best paid stars on television.\nPeppard said \"the first year of the show \"it was kind of like \"Monty Python\" \u2013 absolutely ridiculous. It was fresh, it was fun, it was silly \u2013 building an airplane out of a lawn-mower engine \u2013 fun stuff done very straight.\" After that, though \"it became very boring to me and not very good.\"\nThe role was reportedly written originally with James Coburn in mind, but Coburn declined, and thus it went to Peppard. It was reported that Peppard was annoyed by Mr. T upstaging him in his public image, and at one point in their relationship, refused to speak directly to Mr. T. Instead, he sent messages through intermediaries (including at times fellow cast members, particularly Dirk Benedict), and for this, Peppard was occasionally portrayed by the press as not a team player. Melinda Culea claimed it was Peppard who got her fired after the first season.\n\"It's the first time I ever had money in the bank\", Peppard said later. \"Four California divorces and 25 years of alimony will see to it you have no money in the bank. It was a giant boost to my career, and made me a viable actor for other roles.\"\nDuring the series' run Peppard guest starred on the \"Tales of the Unexpected\" episode \"The Dirty Detail\" (1983).\nLater career.\nPeppard's last series was intended to be several television movie features entitled \"Man Against the Mob\" (1988) and set in the 1940s. In these TV detective films, Peppard played Los Angeles Police Detective Sgt. Frank Doakey. The second film \"\" was broadcast in December 1989. A third film in this series was planned, but Peppard died before it was filmed.\nIn his later years, Peppard appeared in several stage productions. In 1988, he portrayed Ernest Hemingway in the play \"PAPA\", which played a number of cities including Boise, Idaho; Atlanta, Georgia; and San Francisco. Peppard financed it, and played in it. In 1988, he said, \"Once I saw this thing, I knew that if I was going to do it, I'd have to stick with it. I've got a couple bucks in the bank, so I'm not working on anything else. I got an adrenaline rush when I first read this play \u2013 part joy, part fear.\" Peppard said he understood Hemingway. \"We were both married four times; that's one similarity. Up until ten years ago I used to drink a lot, as he did. And then, he had to deal with living the life of a famous person.\"\nThe play was well received. Peppard said of his image, \"There's a George Peppard out there that I don't know. He's been written about, and various people have interpreted him various ways. There are people who've made up stories, apocryphal, about me. There are people who didn't like me much.\"\nHe appeared in \"Silence Like Glass\" (1989) and \"Night of the Fox\" (1990). In 1989, he said \"I'm afraid I'm typecast. It was discouraging when it first happened. I was sad. I had hoped to do lots of different kinds of roles. But fear and insecurity guides casting decisions. Movies and TV have to make money. And people get used to you playing a part and doing certain things. If you don't do it, they get disappointed and it shows up at the box office.\"\nIn 1990, he was seeking financing for \"The Crystal Contract\", a film about an international cocaine cartel that he would produce and in which he would star, but it was never made. \"I would like to do another series because it would mean steady work \u2013 and because I would like one more hit.\"\nIn 1992, he toured in \"The Lion in Winter\", in which he played Henry II to Susan Clark's Eleanor of Aquitaine. \"I haven't been as happy as I am for a long time,\" he said. \"When you find a part you are right for and you love, it's a source of happiness, believe me... If I could have my wish come true, I'd spend the next two years doing nothing but this play.\"\nHis last television role was guest-starring in a 1994 episode of \"Matlock\" entitled \"The P.I\". The episode, co-starring Tracy Nelson, was meant to serve as a backdoor pilot for a series about a father and his estranged daughter both working as private investigators. The episode aired eight days before Peppard's death.\nPersonal life.\nPeppard was married five times and was the father of three children.\nIn 1990, he said, \"Getting married and having a bad divorce is just like breaking your leg. The same leg, in the same place. I'm lucky I don't walk with a cane.\"\nPeppard resided in a Greek revival-style white cottage in Hollywood Hills, California, until the time of his death. His home featured elegant porches on three sides and a guest house in the back. Later owned by designer Brenda Antin, who spent a year renovating it, the small home was purchased by writer/actress Lena Dunham in 2015 for $2.7 million.\nPeppard overcame a serious alcohol problem in 1978, after which he became deeply involved in helping other alcoholics. \"I knew I had to stop and I did\", he said in 1983. \"Looking back now I'm ashamed of some of the things I did when I was drinking.\" He smoked three packs of cigarettes a day for most of his life, until a diagnosis of lung cancer in 1992 and an operation to remove part of one lung, after which he quit. Despite health problems in his later years, he continued acting. In 1994, just before his death, Peppard completed a pilot with Tracy Nelson for a new series called \"The P.I.\" It aired as an episode of \"Matlock\" and was to be spun off into a new television series with Peppard playing an aging detective and Nelson his daughter and sidekick. On May 8, 1994, while battling lung cancer, Peppard died from pneumonia in Los Angeles.\nCritical appraisal.\nDavid Shipman published this appraisal of Peppard in 1972:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\"George Peppard's screen presence has some agreeable anomalies. He is tough, assured and insolent\u00a0\u2014 in a way that recalls late Dick Powell rather than early Bogart; but his bright blue eyes and blond hair, his boyish face suggest the all-American athlete, perhaps going to seed. The sophistication is surface deep: you can imagine him in Times Square on a Saturday night, sulky, defiant, out of his depth, not quite certain how he wants to spend the evening.\"\nIn 1990, Peppard said, \"An enormous amount of my film work has been spent charging up a hill saying, 'Follow me, men! This way!' Even though I did \"Breakfast at Tiffany's\", nobody seemed to think I could do comedy. I always played the man of action. And men of action are not terribly deep characters, and not real vocal characters.\"\nHe added, \"I trained for seven years before I started getting screen work as a stage actor. I love working for an audience. Aside from that, despite all the uniforms and the guns, I think I am at my base a character actor... Being a star has never interested me. Stars, per say [\"sic\"], are a pain. Stars to me are in the sky. The important question is, 'How good an actor are you?' And now I have some hope, because I'm of an age where I could be considered for character roles.\"\nShortly before he died, he said, \"If you look at my movie list, you'll see some really good movies and then the start of ones that were not so good. But I was making enough money to send my children to good schools, have a house for them and give them a center in their lives.\"\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "12533", "revid": "1078419", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=12533", "title": "Geocaching", "text": "Outdoor recreational activity\nGeocaching (, ) is an outdoor recreational activity, in which participants use a Global Positioning System (GPS) receiver or mobile device and other navigational techniques to hide and seek containers, called \"geocaches\" or \"caches\", at specific locations marked by coordinates all over the world. The first geocache was placed in 2000, and by 2023 there were over 3 million active caches worldwide.\nGeocaching can be considered a real-world, outdoor treasure-hunting game. A typical cache is a small waterproof container containing a logbook and sometimes a pen or pencil. The \"geocacher\" signs the log with their established code name/username and dates it, to prove that they found the cache. After signing the log, the cache must be placed back exactly where the person found it. Larger containers such as plastic storage containers (Tupperware or similar) or ammo boxes can also contain items for trading, such as toys or trinkets, usually of more sentimental worth than financial. Geocaching shares many aspects with benchmarking, trigpointing, orienteering, treasure hunting, letterboxing, trail blazing, and another type of location-based game called Munzee.\nHistory.\nGeocaching is similar to the game letterboxing (originating in 1854), which uses clues and references to landmarks embedded in stories. Geocaching was conceived shortly after the removal of selective availability from the Global Positioning System on May 2, 2000 (Blue Switch Day), because the improved accuracy of the system allowed for a small container to be specifically placed and located.\nThe first documented placement of a GPS-located cache took place on May 3, 2000, by Dave Ulmer in Beavercreek, Oregon. The location was posted on the Usenet newsgroup sci.geo.satellite-nav at . Within three days, the cache had been found twice, first by Mike Teague. According to Dave Ulmer's message, this cache was a black plastic bucket that was partially buried and contained various items, such as software, videos, books, money, a can of beans, and a slingshot. The geocache and most of its contents were eventually destroyed by a lawn mower, but the can of beans was the only item salvaged and was later turned into a trackable item known as the \"Original Can of Beans\". Another geocache and plaque, called the Original Stash Tribute Plaque, now sits at the site.\nGeocaching company Groundspeak allows extraterrestrial caches, e.g. the Moon or Mars, although presently, the website provides only earthbound coordinates. The first published extraterrestrial geocache was GC1BE91, which was placed on the International Space Station by Richard Garriott in 2008. It used the Baikonur launch area in Kazakhstan as its position. The original cache contained a Travel Bug (the first geocaching trackable item in space), which stayed on the station until it was brought back to earth in 2013. Due to fire restrictions on board the station, the geocache contained no official paper logbook. As of June 2024, only one confirmed geocacher (on November 17, 2013) has actually found the geocache, although others have claimed to have found it providing varying amounts of evidence. To commemorate the occasion, Groundspeak allowed specialized geocaching events to be published across the world, allowing attendees to obtain a virtual souvenir on their profile.\nThe second geocaching trackable in space is TB5EFXK which is attached to the SHERLOC calibration target on board the Mars Perseverance Rover, which landed on Mars on February 18, 2021. Geocachers were given the opportunity to virtually discover the trackable after the WATSON camera sent back its first photographs of the calibration target that contained the tracking code number. The code is printed on a prototype helmet visor material that will be used to test how well it can withstand the Martian environment. This will help scientists in creating a viable Martian spacesuit for future crewed missions to Mars. \nThe activity was originally referred to as the \"GPS stash hunt\" or \"gpsstashing.\" This was changed shortly after the original hide when it was suggested in the gpsstash eGroup that \"stash\" could have negative connotations and the term \"geocaching\" was adopted.\nOver time a variety of different hide-and-seek-type activities have been created or abandoned, so that \"Geocaching\" may now refer to hiding and seeking containers, or locations or information without containers.\nAn independent accounting of the early history documents several controversial actions taken by Jeremy Irish and Grounded, Inc., a predecessor to Groundspeak, to increase \"commercialization and monopolistic control over the hobby\". More recently, other similar hobbies such as Munzee have attracted some geocachers by rapidly adopting smart-phone technology, which has caused \"some resistance from geocaching organizers about placing caches along with Munzees\".\nGeocaches.\nFor the traditional geocache, a geocacher will place a waterproof container containing a log book, often also a pen and/or pencil and trade items or trackables, then record the cache's coordinates. These coordinates, along with other details of the location, are posted on a listing site (see list of some sites below). Other geocachers obtain the coordinates from that listing site and seek out the cache using their handheld GPS receivers. The finding geocachers record their exploits in the logbook and online, but then must return the cache to the same coordinates so that other geocachers may find it. Geocachers are free to take objects (except the logbook, pencil, or stamp) from the cache in exchange for leaving something of similar or higher value.\nTypical cache \"treasures\", also known in the geocaching world as SWAG (a backronym of \"stuff we all get\"), are not high in monetary value but may hold personal value to the finder. Aside from the logbook, common cache contents are unusual coins or currency, small toys, ornamental buttons, CDs, or books. Although not required, many geocachers decide to leave behind signature items, such as personal geocoins, pins, or craft items, to mark their presence at the cache location. Disposable cameras are popular as they allow for anyone who found the cache to take a picture which can be developed and uploaded to a geocaching web site listed below. Also common are objects that are moved from cache to cache called \"hitchhikers\", such as Travel Bugs or geocoins, whose travels may be logged and followed online. Cachers who initially place a Travel Bug or Geocoin(s) often assign specific goals for their trackable items. Examples of goals are to be placed in a certain cache a long distance from home, or to travel to a certain country, or to travel faster and farther than other hitchhikers in a race. Less common trends are site-specific information pages about the historic significance of the site, types of trees, birds in the area or other such information. Higher-value items are occasionally included in geocaches as a reward for the First to Find (called \"FTF\"), or in locations which are harder to reach.\nDangerous or illegal items, including weapons and drugs, are not allowed and are specifically against the rules of most geocache listing sites. Food is also disallowed, even if sealed, as it is considered unhygienic and can attract animals.\nIf a geocache has been vandalized or stolen by a person who is not familiar with geocaching, it is said to have been \"muggled\". The term plays off the fact that those not familiar with geocaching are called \"muggles\", a word borrowed from the \"Harry Potter\" series of books which were rising in popularity at the same time geocaching started.\nVariations.\nGeocaches vary in size, difficulty, and location. Simple caches that are placed near a roadside are often called \"drive-bys\", \"park 'n grabs\" (PNGs), or \"cache and dash\". Geocaches may also be complex, involving lengthy searches, significant travel, or use of specialist equipment such as SCUBA diving, kayaking, or abseiling. Different geocaching websites list different variations per their own policies.\nContainer sizes range from \"nano\", particularly \"magnetic nanos\", which can be smaller than the tip of a finger and have only enough room to store the log sheet, to 20-liter (5 gallon) buckets or even larger containers, such as entire trucks. The most common cache containers in rural areas are lunch-box-sized plastic storage containers or surplus military ammunition cans. Ammo cans are considered the gold standard of containers because they are very sturdy, waterproof, animal- and fire-resistant, and relatively cheap, and have plenty of room for trade items. Smaller containers are more common in urban areas because they can be more easily hidden.\nGeocache types.\nOver time many variations of geocaches have developed. Different platforms often have their own rules on which types are allowed or how they are classified. The following cache types are supported by geocaching.com.\nTraditional cache.\nThe simplest form of a geocache. It consists of a container with a log sheet, and is located at the posted coordinates. Cache containers come in many different sizes.\nNight cache.\nThese caches are intended to be found at night, usually by use of a UV torch.\nMulti-cache.\nThese caches include at least one stage in addition to the physical final container with a log sheet. The posted coordinates for a multi-cache are the first stage. At each stage, the geocacher gathers information that leads them to the next stage or to the final container. Multi-caches can consist of physical stages (i.e. the first stage contains coordinates for the next stage and so forth) or virtual stages (i.e. the first stage is a historical marker where geocachers have to answer questions to calculate the coordinates to the final physical container).\nMystery cache.\nAlso called a 'puzzle cache', players might need to solve a puzzle or bring a special tool to reveal the next waypoint or final coordinates. Most often, the final container is not at the posted coordinates which is noted in the cache description. Some puzzles can be easy and involve basic math operations or they can be quite difficult, with some of the more challenging ones requiring a firm understanding of computer programming. Geocaching Toolbox, a website dedicated to create and solve puzzle geocaches, provides a comprehensive list of common puzzle cache ciphers.\nThere are also some subcategories of the mystery cache, which are normally listed as a Mystery Type, which are listed below.\nChallenge cache.\nThis requires a geocacher to complete a reasonably attainable geocaching-related task before being able to log the cache as a find online. It does not restrict \"geocachers\" from finding the cache and signing the logbook at anytime. However a geocacher is not allowed to log a find on the geocaching website unless they qualify for the challenge specified in the cache description. Examples include finding a number of caches that meet a category, completing a number of cache finds within a period of time, or finding a cache for every calendar day.\nSince 2017, Groundspeak has required new challenges to have a \"geochecker\" in which users can put their name into an algorithm to see if they qualify without the need of physically checking all of one's previous finds. These \"geocheckers\" can be requested using the ProjectGC forums where volunteers can write and create scripts for specific challenges. Groundspeak also has been more strict into what types of challenges are published. For example, prior to 2017 it was possible to create a challenge cache to find 10 caches that have a food item in the title. Under current guidelines, this is no longer allowed because it restricts geocachers to find specific geocaches. Instead, Groundspeak has encouraged new challenges to be more creative. Acceptable challenges include finding caches in 10 states, finding 100 traditional geocaches, or finding 1000 geocaches with the \"wheelchair accessible\" attribute.\nBonus cache.\nA bonus cache requires the finder to have found an amount of caches, usually in a specific series by the same hider, before finding the bonus cache. The cache can be any type, however a bonus cache cannot be required for a second bonus cache.\nMoving or traveling cache.\nThese were found at a listed set of coordinates. The finder hides the cache in a different location, and updates the listing, essentially becoming the hider, and the next finder continues the cycle. This cache has been discontinued at geocaching.com due to many problems with maintenance, community volunteer reviewers, and with Groundspeak, and all traveling caches were archived in 2017. Since then, Groundspeak offered traveling cache owners the option to convert their cache to a trackable with its own unique icon.\nChirp cache.\nAlso known as a wireless beacon cache. This is a Garmin-created innovative on multi-caches using wireless beacon technology. It is a physical game piece, about the size of a half-dollar that can be hidden anywhere. Powered by a small battery, it is able to transmit a signal detectable on Garmin devices. The Chirp stores hints, multicache coordinates, counts visitors, and can confirm the cache is nearby. These caches caused considerable discussion and some controversy at Groundspeak, where they were ultimately given a new \"attribute\". These types of geocaches can also be listed as a traditional, multi-cache, or letterbox. It is up to the cache owner to designated the cache type for wireless beacon caches.\nGeocaching HQ geocache (GCK25B).\nThis is an official geocache located inside the Groundspeak headquarters office in Seattle, Washington. It is technically classified as a separate cache type under mystery caches, with its own unique icon both on the geocaching app and on one's profile statistics tab. Since publication in 2004, it has over 22,000 finds as of November 2025.\nWherigo cache.\nA multi-stage cache hunt that uses a Wherigo \"cartridge\" to guide players to find a physical cache sometime during cartridge play, usually at the end. However, not all Wherigo cartridges incorporate geocaches into gameplay. Wherigo caches are unique to the geocaching.com website. Wherigo is a GPS location-aware software platform initially released in January 2008. Authors can develop self-enclosed story files (called \"cartridges\") that are read by the Wherigo player software, installed on either a GPS unit or smartphone. The player and story take advantage of the location information provided by the GPS to trigger in-game events, such as using a virtual object or interacting with characters. Completing an adventure can require reaching different locations and solving puzzles. Cartridges are coded in Lua. Lua may be used directly, but a builder application is usually used. The Wherigo site offers a builder application and a database of adventures free for download, though the builder has remained in its Alpha version since its last release in May 2008. The official player is only available for Pocket PC. A built-in player is available on Garmin Colorado and Oregon GPS models. The Wherigo Foundation was organized in December 2012. The group is composed of all Wherigo application developers who, up until that time, had been acting and developing separately. Their goal is to provide a consistent Wherigo experience across platforms, connect Wherigo applications via an API, and add modern features to the Wherigo platform. While Groundspeak is aware of this project, the company has yet to take a position.\nReverse Wherigo.\nAn RWIG provides three lines of code composed of 9 digits each that a player can type into the RWIG cartridge. Instead of following a story or interacting with characters, and RWIG gives you the distance to the final cache, but not direction. It requires geocachers to get closer to the final geocache by process of elimination. Once you are within 25 metres, the final coordinates are given to provide a more accurate location for the geocache.\nLetterbox hybrid.\nThis is a combination of a geocache and a letterbox in the same container. Letterboxes involve a rubber stamp and logbook that are not supposed to be traded and taken instead of tradable items, but letterbox hybrids may or may not include trade items. Letterboxers carry their own stamp with them, to stamp the letterbox's logbook and inversely stamp their personal logbook with the letterbox stamp. The letterbox hybrid cache contains the important materials for this. Typically, letterbox hybrid caches are not found at the given coordinates which only act as a starting location. Instead, a series of clues are given as to where to find the cache such as \"take a left past the bridge\" or \"about 25 paces past the big oak tree\".\nProject A.P.E. cache.\nAlso known as Ape caches, these are a special type of traditional cache that were hidden in conjunction with 20th Century Fox and Groundspeak to promote the 2001 remake of Planet of the Apes. There were 14 APE geocaches placed around the world and each one contained a prop from the film. As of 2023, only 2 APE caches are still active with one near Seattle, Washington ('Tunnel of Light', GC1169) and the other in Brazil ('Southern Bowl', GCC67). Of those two, the Brazil APE cache is the only surviving original APE cache because GC1169 was muggled in 2016. However, the original container was later found by a Groundspeak led survey in April of that year. What remains of \"Tunnel of Light\" is an \"official\" replacement of the original ammo can that was left in 2001.\nVirtual cache.\nThis cache type does not contain a physical logbook. They are normally hidden at a rather interesting or unique location, usually with a described object such as an art sculpture or a scenic lookout. Validation for finding a virtual cache generally requires one to email the cache hider with information such as a date or a name on a plaque, or to post a picture of oneself at the site with a GPS receiver in hand. As of 2005, new virtual caches are no longer allowed by Groundspeak as it is considered a legacy cache.\nOn August 24, 2017, Groundspeak announced \"Virtual Rewards\", allowing 4000 new virtual caches to be placed during the following year. Each year, eligible geocachers can opt-in to a drawing and some selected with the opportunity to submit a virtual cache for publication. From 2005 to 2017, the geocaching website no longer listed new caches without a physical container, including virtual and webcam caches (with the exception of earthcaches and events); however, older caches of these types have been grandfathered.\nEarthCache.\nSimilar to virtual geocaches, an EarthCache is published not by a local reviewer, but by a volunteer regional reviewer associated with the Geological Society of America. The geocacher usually has to perform a task which teaches an education lesson about the geology of the cache area. Visitors must answer geological questions to complete the cache which can be as simple as describing the color and thickness of layers in an outcrop or can be as complicated as taking measurements of stream velocities or fault offsets. Earthcaches covers geologic topics such as: rock formation, mineralogy, earthquakes, fluvial processes, erosion, volcanology, and planetary science (among others).\nLocationless cache.\nOtherwise known as a Reverse cache, a locationless cache is similar to a scavenger hunt. A description is given for something to find, such as a one-room schoolhouse, and the finder locates an example of this object. The finder records the location using their GPS receiver and often takes a picture at the location showing the named object with their GPS receiver. Typically others are not allowed to log that same location as a find.\nSince 2005, all locationless caches have been archived and locked, meaning they are unable to be logged. However, with geocaching's 20th anniversary in 2020 Groundspeak decided to publish a special locationless cache for geocachers to \"find\" at various Mega- and Giga-Events around the world. The first locationless cache in 15 years (GC8FR0G) required finders to take a picture of themselves with the geocaching mascot, Signal the Frog, at Mega- and Giga-Events during 2020. The cache was made available to log starting January 1, 2020. However, because of the COVID-19 pandemic, nearly all planned Mega- and Giga-events were canceled for the year, including the planned 20th anniversary celebration event in Seattle, Washington. Therefore, Groundspeak decided to extend the deadline to log this geocache through January 1, 2023. With 22,500 finds it is the second most logged geocache in history.\nThe second published locationless cache since 2005 (GC8NEAT) required visitors to take a photo of them picking up trash and cleaning up their local area. Geocachers were able to log this cache from February 6, 2021, through December 31, 2022. It has been logged over 33,500 times and holds the title for the most \"found\" geocache. On August 17, 2022, Geocaching.com made available the third locationless cache to be logged since 2005 (GC9FAVE). Instead of finding Signal or picking up trash, this cache encouraged geocachers from around the world to share their favorite geocaching story. This geocache was archived and locked on January 1, 2024. In 2025, Geocaching.com announced the fourth locationless cache since 2005 (GCA2025). In honor of the 25-th anniversary of geocaching, geocachers were encouraged to take a photo next to a pre-existing number 25.\nWebcam cache.\nA type of virtual cache whose coordinates provide the location to a public webcam. The finder is required to capture an image of themselves through the webcam for verification of the find. New webcam caches are no longer allowed by Groundspeak as it is a legacy cache. Webcam caches are a category at Waymarking.com.\nAdventure Lab.\nA type of virtual cache that typically consists of a set of 5 waypoints, with each waypoint counting as a \"cache find\". The waypoints usually have an overall theme such showcasing the history of a small town and are often created as a walking tour of a city or park. An example would be Route 66 or the Lincoln Highway, which are a nationwide series of Adventure Lab sets of 10 that stretch the entire route across the United States.\nAdventure labs were first introduced in 2014 as a way to test market ideas through Groundspeak. Initially, geocachers would find a key word at a designated site where they could then enter it onto a website to claim \"credit\". Soon after, they were made available to \"find\" at select Mega-Events. In 2020, Groundspeak released the \"Adventure Lab\" app, separate from the geocaching app. The app made it possible to enter a geo-fence when, once inside, a question will appear that can be answered either in the form of a written answer or a multiple choice answer. This question can be answered at anytime once activated, however, some Adventure Labs must be completed sequentially implying that one must answer the question to move on to the next waypoint.\nMany Adventure Labs caches have a physical bonus cache associated with them that are listed as a \"mystery cache\". Coordinates to the bonus cache, if applicable, can be seen in the journal entries once a user has correctly answered the question at a waypoint.\nGeocachers can create their own Adventure Lab, but must first opt-in to receive an \"Adventure Lab credit\" which allows for the creation of 1 set of 5 waypoints, with each of the 5 waypoints counting towards a cache find. If selected, Adventure Labs can be created using the Adventure Lab builder. Adventure Labs, unlike all other geocaches, are not subject to review and are published at will by the creator. However, Adventure Labs can at anytime be archived by Groundspeak if they are in violation of terms of use. For example, placing an Adventure Lab in a place that requires people to pay a fee to visit such as airports or theme parks may get the Adventure permanently removed from the Adventure Lab app.\nEvent caches.\nThere are several kinds of events geocaches. While encouraged, events do not require visitors to sign their name a logbook to prove they attended an event. Attendees of event caches can log that they 'attended', which will increment their number of found caches. Event caches can be of the following types:\nTechnology.\nObtaining data.\nGPX files containing information such as a cache description and information about recent visitors to the cache are available from various listing sites. Geocachers may upload geocache data (also known as waypoints) from various websites in various formats, most commonly in file-type GPX, which uses XML. Some websites allow geocachers to search (build queries) for multiple caches within a geographic area based on criteria such as ZIP code or coordinates, downloading the results as an email attachment on a schedule. In recent years, Android and iPhone users can download apps such as GeoBeagle that allow them to use their 3G and GPS-enabled devices to actively search for and download new caches.\nConverting and filtering data.\nA variety of geocaching applications are available for geocache data management, file-type translation, and personalization. Geocaching software can assign special icons or search (filter) for caches based on certain criteria (e.g. distance from an assigned point, difficulty, date last found).\nPaperless geocaching means hunting a geocache without a physical printout of the cache description. Traditionally, this means that the seeker has an electronic means of viewing the cache information in the field, such as pre-downloading the information to a PDA or other electronic device. Various applications can directly upload and read GPX files without further conversion. Newer GPS devices released by Garmin, DeLorme, and Magellan have the ability to read GPX files directly, thus eliminating the need for a PDA. Other methods include viewing real-time information on a portable computer with internet access or with an Internet-enabled smart phone. The latest advancement of this practice involves installing dedicated applications on a smart phone with a built-in GPS receiver. Seekers can search for and download caches in their immediate vicinity directly to the application and use the on-board GPS receiver to find the cache.\nA more controversial version of paperless Caching involves mass-downloading only the coordinates and cache names (or waypoint IDs) for hundreds of caches into older receivers. This is a common practice of some cachers and has been used successfully for years. In many cases, however, the cache description and hint are never read by the seeker before hunting the cache. This means they are unaware of potential restrictions such as limited hunt times, park open/close times, off-limit areas, and suggested parking locations.\nMobile devices.\nThe website geocaching.com now sells mobile applications which allow users to view caches through a variety of different devices. Currently, the Android, iOS, and Windows Phone mobile platforms have applications in their respective stores. The apps also allow for a trial version with limited functionality. The site promotes mobile applications, and lists over two dozen applications (both mobile and browser/desktop based) that are using their proprietary but royalty-free public application programming interface (API). Developers at c:geo have criticized Groundspeak for being incompatible with open-source development.\nAdditionally, \"c:geo\" is a free opensource full function application for Android phones. This app includes similar features to the official Geocaching mobile application, such as: View caches on a live map (Google Maps or OpenStreetMap), navigation using a compass, map, or other applications, logging finds online and offline, etc.\nGeocaching enthusiasts have also made their own hand-held GPS devices using a Lego Mindstorms NXT GPS sensor.\nEthics.\nGeocache listing websites have their own guidelines for acceptable geocache publications. Government agencies and others responsible for public use of land often publish guidelines for geocaching, and a \"Geocacher's Creed\" posted on the Internet asks participants to \"avoid causing disruptions or public alarm\". Generally accepted rules are to not endanger others, to minimize the impact on nature, to respect private property, and to avoid public alarm.\nReception.\nThe reception from authorities and the general public outside geocache participants has been mixed.\nCachers have been approached by police and questioned when they were seen as acting suspiciously. Other times, investigation of a cache location after suspicious activity was reported has resulted in police and bomb squad discovery of the geocache, such as the evacuation of a busy street in Wetherby, Yorkshire, England in 2011, and a street in Alvaston, Derby in 2020.\nSchools have been evacuated when a cache has been seen by teachers or police, such as the case of Fairview High School in Boulder, Colorado in 2009. A number of caches have been destroyed by bomb squads. Diverse locations, from rural cemeteries to Disneyland, have been locked down as a result of such scares.\nThe placement of geocaches has occasional critics among some government personnel and the public at large, who consider it littering. Some geocachers act to mitigate this perception by picking up litter while they search for geocaches, a practice referred to in the community as \"Cache In Trash Out\". Events and caches are often organized revolving around this practice, with many areas seeing significant cleanup that would otherwise not take place, or would instead require federal, state, or local funds to accomplish. Geocachers are also encouraged to clean up after themselves by retrieving old containers once a cache has been removed from play.\nGeocaching is legal in most countries and is usually positively received when explained to law enforcement officials. However, certain types of placements can be problematic. Although generally disallowed, hiders could place caches on private property without adequate permission (intentionally or otherwise), which encourages cache finders to trespass. Historic buildings and structures have also been damaged by geocachers, who have wrongly believed the geocache can be/has been placed within, or on the roof of, the buildings.\nCaches might also be hidden in places where the act of searching can make a finder look suspicious (e.g., near schools, children's playgrounds, banks, courthouses, or in residential neighborhoods), or where the container placement could be mistaken for a drug stash or a bomb (especially in urban settings, under bridges, near banks, courthouses, or embassies). As a result, geocachers are strongly advised to label their geocaches when possible, so that they are not mistaken for a harmful object if discovered by non-geocachers.\nAs well as concerns about littering and bomb threats, some geocachers have hidden their caches in inappropriate locations, such as electrical boxes, which may encourage risky behavior, especially by children. Hides in these areas are discouraged, and cache listing websites enforce guidelines that disallow certain types of placements. However, as cache reviewers typically cannot see exactly where and how every cache is hidden, problematic hides can slip through. Ultimately it is also up to cache finders to use discretion when attempting to search for a cache, and report any problems.\nLaws and legislation.\nRegional rules for placement of caches have become complex. For example, in Virginia, the Virginia Department of Transportation and the Wildlife Management Agency now forbids the placement of geocaches on all land controlled by those agencies. Some cities, towns, and recreation areas allow geocaches with few or no restrictions, but others require compliance with lengthy permitting procedures.\nThe South Carolina House of Representatives passed Bill 3777 in 2005, stating, \"It is unlawful for a person to engage in the activity of Geocaching or letterboxing in a cemetery or in a historic or archaeological site or property publicly identified by a historical marker without the express written consent of the owner or entity which oversees that cemetery site or property.\" The bill was referred to committee on first reading in the Senate and has been there ever since.\nThe Illinois Department of Natural Resources requires geocachers who wish to place a geocache at any Illinois state park to submit the location on a USGS 7.5-minute topographical map, the name and contact information of the person(s) wishing to place the geocache, a list of the original items to be included in the geocache, and a picture of the container that is to be placed.\nIn April 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic, the township of Highlands East, Ontario, Canada temporarily banned geocaching, over concerns that geocache containers could not be properly disinfected between finds.\nNotable incidents.\nSeveral deaths have occurred during the course of Caching.\nThe death of a 21-year-old experienced cacher in December 2011 \"while attempting a Groundspeak Cache that does not look all that dangerous\" led to discussions of whether changes should be made, and whether cache owners or Groundspeak could be held liable. Groundspeak has since updated their geocaching.com terms of use agreement to specify that geocachers find geocaches at their own risk.\nIn 2008 two lost hikers on Mount Hood in Oregon, US stumbled across a geocache and phoned this information out to rescuers, allowing crews to locate and rescue them.\nThree adult geocachers, a 24-year-old woman and her parents, were trapped in a cave and rescued by firefighters in Rochester, New York, US while searching for a geocache in 2012. Rochester Fire Department spokesman Lt. Ted Kuppinger said, \"It's difficult, because you're invested in it, you want to find something like that, so people will probably try to push themselves more than they should, but you need to be prudent about what you're capable of doing.\"\nIn 2015 members of the public called the British coastguard to check on a group of geocachers who were spotted walking into the Severn Estuary off the coast of Clevedon, England, in search of clues to locate a multi-cache. Although they felt they were safe and able to return to land, they were considered to be in danger and were airlifted back to the shore.\nIn October 2016 four people discovered a crashed car at the bottom of a ravine in Benton County, Washington, US, while out geocaching. They spotted the driver still trapped inside and alerted emergency services, who rescued the driver.\nOn June 9, 2018, four people in Prague, Czech Republic were searching for a cache in a 4\u00a0km long tunnel when a storm surge carried them through the tunnel to its terminus at the Vltava river. Two of the geocachers died, while two others were rescued from the river.\nOn September 23, 2025, two people set up a cache under a picnic table outside of a church in Stephen, Minnesota. The church's pastor, believing the package it was inside of looked suspicious, called the police. Several nearby buildings were placed on lockdown and others were evacuated. The Grand Forks, North Dakota Bomb Squad was then called and the cache was blown up.\nWebsites and data ownership.\nNumerous websites list geocaches around the world. Geocaching websites vary in many ways, such as subscription options, activity levels, and volunteers available to check and ensure caches registered remain open for others.\nFirst page.\nThe first website to list geocaches was announced by Mike Teague on May 8, 2000. On September 2, 2000, Jeremy Irish emailed the gpsstash mailing list that he had registered the domain name geocaching.com and had set up his own Web site. He copied the caches from Mike Teague's database into his own. On September 6, Mike Teague announced that Jeremy Irish was taking over cache listings. As of 2012[ [update]], Teague had logged only 5 caches.\nGeocaching.com.\nThe largest site is Geocaching.com, owned by Groundspeak Inc., which began operating in late 2000. With a worldwide membership and a freemium business model, the website claims millions of caches and members in over 190 countries and all seven continents including Antarctica. Hides and events are reviewed by volunteer regional cache reviewers before publication. Free membership allows users access to coordinates, descriptions, and logs for some caches; for a subscription fee, users are allowed additional search tools, the ability to download large amounts of cache information onto their GPS at once, instant email notifications about new caches, and access to premium-member-only caches. Geocaching Headquarters are located in the Fremont neighborhood of Seattle, Washington, United States.\nOpencaching Network.\nThe Opencaching Network provides independent, non-commercial listing sites based in the cacher's country or region. The Opencaching Network lists the most types of caches, including traditional, virtual, moving, multi, quiz, webcam, BIT, guest book, USB, event, and MP3. The Opencaching Network is less restrictive than many sites, and does not charge for the use of the sites, the service being community-driven. Some (or all) listings may or may not be required to be reviewed by community volunteers before being published.\nAs opposed to Geocaching.com, cross-listing is permitted\u2014that is, listing caches on both Opencaching as another network, like Geocaching.com. Many of Opencaching's caches are unique to the Opencaching Network, however. Some of the functions on the Opencaching Network include the following:\nEach Opencaching Node uses a free shared API (called \"OKAPI\") for use by developers who want to create third-party applications that use the Opencaching Network's content.\nAt this time, the following Opencaching websites exist:\nThe main difference between Opencaching and traditional listing sites is that all services are open to the users at no cost. Generally, most geocaching services or websites offer some basic information for free, but users may have to pay for premium membership that allows access to more information or advanced searching capabilities. This is not the case with Opencaching; every geocache is listed and accessible to everyone for free.\nAdditionally Opencaching sites allow users to rate and report on existing geocaches. This allows users to see what other cachers think of the cache and it encourages participants to place higher-quality caches. The rating system also greatly reduces the problem of abandoned or unsatisfactory caches still being listed after repeated negative comments or posts in the cache logs.\nOpenCaching.com.\nOpenCaching.com (short: OX) was a site created and run by Garmin from 2010 to 2015, which had the stated aim of being as free and open as possible with no paid content. Caches were approved by a community process and coordinates were available without an account. The service closed on August 14, 2015.\nOther sites.\nIn many countries there are regional geocaching sites, but these mostly only compile lists of caches in the area from the three main sites. Many of them also accept unique listings of caches for their site; these listings tend to be less popular than the international sites, although occasionally the regional sites may have more caches than the international sites. There are some exceptions, such as how, in the territory of the former Soviet Union, the site Geocaching.su remains popular because it accepts listings in the Cyrillic script. Additional international sites include Geocaching.de, a German website, and Geocaching Australia, which accepts listings of cache types deprecated by geocaching.com, cache types such as TrigPoint and Moveable caches, as well as traditional geocache types.\nGPSgames.\nGPSgames.org was an online community dedicated to all kinds of games involving Global Positioning System receivers. GPSgames.org allowed traditional geocaches along with virtual, locationless, and traveler geocaches. \nThe site's geodashing game generated a large number of randomly positioned \"dashpoints\", requiring players to reach as many as possible, competing as individuals or teams.\nShutterspot, GeoVexilla, MinuteWar, GeoPoker, and GeoGolf were among the other GPS games available.\nGPSgames.org was 100% free since 2001, through donations. The site was retired on June 30, 2021.\nNaviCache.\nNavicache.com started as a regional listing service in 2001. While many of the website's listings have been posted to other sites, it also offers unique listings. The website lists nearly any type of geocache and does not charge to access any of the caches listed in its database. All submissions are reviewed and approved. In 2012 it was announced that Navicache was under transition to new owners, who said they \"plan to develop a site that geocachers want, with rules that geocachers think are suitable. Geocaching.com and OX are both backed by large enterprises, and while that means they have more funding and people, we're a much smaller team \u2013 so our advantage is the ability to be dynamic and listen to the users.\" However, as of 2021 the site is mostly dormant, and the most recent cache listing is from 2014.\nTerraCaching.\nTerracaching.com aims to provide high-quality caches made so by the difficulty of the hide or from the quality of the location. Membership is managed through a sponsorship system, and each cache is under continual peer review from other members. Terracaching.com embraces virtual caches alongside traditional or multi-stage caches and includes many locationless caches among the thousands of caches in its database. It is increasingly attracting members who like the point system. In Europe, TerraCaching is supported by Terracaching.eu. This site is translated in different European languages, has an extended FAQ and extra supporting tools for TerraCaching. TerraCaching strongly discourages caches that are listed on other sites (so-called double-listing).\nExtremcaching.\nExtremcaching is a German private database for alternative geocaches with a focus on T5 / climbing caches, night caches, and lost place caches.\nGeocaching Australia.\nGeocaching Australia is a community website for geocachers in Australia and New Zealand. Geocaching Australia also has many unique cache types such as Burke And Wills, Moveable_cache &amp; Podcache geocaches.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "12534", "revid": "29884708", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=12534", "title": "Geographical mile", "text": "Unit of length of approximately 1855.3 m\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Infobox/styles-images.css\" /&gt;\nThe geographical mile is an international unit of length determined by 1 minute of arc ( degree) along the Earth's equator. For the international ellipsoid 1924 this equalled 1855.4 metres. \"The American Practical Navigator\" 2017 defines the geographical mile as . Greater precision depends more on the choice of the Earth's radius of the used ellipsoid than on more careful measurement, since the radius of the geoid varies more than along the equator. In any ellipsoid, the length of a degree of longitude at the equator is exactly 60 geographical miles. The Earth's radius at the equator in the GRS80 ellipsoid is , which makes the geographical mile 1,855.3248 m. The rounding of the Earth's radius to metres in GRS80 has an effect of 0.0001 m.\nThe shape of the Earth is a slightly flattened sphere, which results in the Earth's circumference being 0.168% larger when measured around the equator as compared to through the poles. The geographical mile is slightly larger than the nautical mile (which was historically linked to the circumference measured through both poles); one geographic mile is equivalent to approximately .\nHistorical units.\nHistorically, certain nations used slightly different divisions to create their geographical miles.\nThe Portuguese system derived their miles () as one third of their league of three separate values. When each equatorial degree was divided into 18 leagues, the geographical mile was equal to degree or about ; when divided into 20 leagues, the geographical mile was equal to degree, approximating the values provided above; and when divided into 25 leagues, the geographical mile was equal to degree or about .\nThe geographical miles of the traditional Dutch (), German ( or ), and Danish systems () all approximated their much longer miles\u2014equivalent to English leagues\u2014by using a larger division of the equatorial degree. Instead of using one minute of arc, they all used four\u2014 degree\u2014to produce a distance now notionally equal to but actually differing slightly depending on official measurements and computations. (For example, the Danish unit was computed as equivalent to about by the astronomer Ole R\u00f8mer.) \nRelationship with the nautical mile.\nThe geographical mile is closely related to the nautical mile, which was originally determined as 1 minute of arc along a great circle of the Earth but is nowadays defined by treaty as exactly 1,852 m. The US National Institute of Standards and Technology notes that \"The international nautical mile of 1,852 meters (6,076.115\u00a049... feet) was adopted effective July 1, 1954, for use in the United States.

Because of this, a player has to create their superhero from scratch, not based on a pre-existing superhero. \nThe first step in character generation is to randomly determine via dice rolls the character's basic attributes of Ego, Strength, Dexterity and Vigor. The dice rolls also determine the character's superpowers. There is an opportunity for the player to modify abilities somewhat, but not to change the superpowers. A character can only keep their full set of powers if they can justify them all in a plausible origins story. \nDuring play, the player must keep track of the superhero's private life, what happens during leisure time and the work done while using the hero's secret identity. Characters are \"rated\" after each game and are more likely to succeed in future games if they behave in ways consistent with Comic Book tropes.\nPublication history.\n\"Golden Heroes\" was developed at University of Birmingham by Simon Burley and Peter Haines in 1981, who self-published their manuscript as a 60-page mimeographed book. Burley and Haines shopped the book to Games Workshop, who expanded the material to include Marvel characters in the hopes of acquiring a role-playing game license from Marvel Comics. When Marvel awarded the license to TSR instead, Games Workshop expunged the Marvel content and published the result as \"Golden Heroes\" in 1984. The box cover art by Alan Craddock is meant look like the cover of an American comic book of the time, complete with a fake bar code and a fake Comics Code Authority approval badge. Interior art was by a plethora of British artists, including Brian Bolland, Kevin Bulmer, Mike Collins, Declan Considine, Alan Davis, Kirk Etienne, Brett Ewins, Jon Glentoran, David Hine, Gary Mayes, and Brendan McCarthy, several of whom were working for the British comic book \"2000 AD\" at the time.\nThe following year, Games Workshop published two adventures and one supplement for \"Golden Heroes\": \nGames Workshop also published content for the game in their house magazine \"White Dwarf\", and produced a line of metal miniatures. \nTwenty years after Games Workshop let the \"Golden Heroes\" line of products lapse, one of the original creators, Simon Burley, resurrected the game as \"Squadron UK\" in 2006.\nReception.\nWriting in Issue 62 of \"White Dwarf\" (February 1985), Marcus L. Rowland noted \"As a late contender in the super RPG field, \"Golden Heroes\" faces severe opposition from established games. However, its quality, scope, and the fact that it is orientated towards British players are bound to make it successful, if there is a steady flow of supplements and scenarios.\" Rowland concluded by giving the game an overall rating of 10 out of 10.\nPete Tamlyn reviewed \"Golden Heroes\" for \"Imagine\" magazine, and stated that \"For younger players, and If you just want the Superhero game for light relief and one-off scenarios, then [\"Marvel Superheroes\"] is the best, but if you are planning to run an extended Superhero campaign then \"Golden Heroes\" wins hands down.\"\nQuentin Long reviewed \"Golden Heroes\" for \"Different Worlds\" magazine and stated that \"I don't like it. The good bits (as few as they are) are not enough to make up for all the bad bits. Buy it only if you're a rabid completist or if you enjoy tinkering with rules from obscure games.\"\nIn his 1990 book \"The Complete Guide to Role-Playing Games\", game critic Rick Swan was disappointed in the game, particularly the character generation system, pointing out \"basically [the player] is saddled with whatever powers the dice-rolls dictate, no matter how contradictory or silly. Because the random ability system freely mixes useless powers with god-like, there's only a remote chance that players will receive [player characters] of comparable talents.\" Swan was likewise dismayed by the combat system, calling it \"a hodge-podge of weapon classes, target ranges and power grades bordering on the incomprehensible.\" Swan also didn't like the extensive paperwork required to track a hero's private life. Swan concluded by giving the game a below average rating of 2 out of 4, saying, \"The rulebooks boast some nice artwork, and the thoughtful referee's tips are applicable to any comic-book RPG, but there's just not enough substance in \"Golden Heroes\" to recommend it over the competition.\" However, Swan found the two adventures released for \"Golden Heroes\" to be \"surprisingly good, particularly \"Queen Victoria &amp; The Holy Grail\", an exciting adventure with supernatural overtones.\" \nMore than ten years after its publication, Tony Johnston did a retrospective review of \"Golden Heroes\" for the British games magazine \"Arcane\", calling it \"A superb system, and one which some referees I know still use today, adapted for other games.\" That same year, \"Arcane\" held a reader poll to determine the fifty most popular role-playing games and \"Golden Heroes\" was ranked 41st. Editor Paul Pettengale commented: \"The gameplay reflects a refined approach to the superhero genre, and roleplaying tends to take priority over combat.\"\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Located on the Pearl River about northwest of Hong Kong and north of Macau, Guangzhou has a history of over 2,200 years and was a major terminus of the Silk Road. \nThe port of Guangzhou serves as transportation hub. Guangzhou is also one of China's three largest cities. For a long time, it was the only Chinese port accessible to most foreign traders. Guangzhou was captured by the British during the First Opium War and no longer enjoyed a monopoly after the war. Consequently it lost trade to other ports such as Hong Kong and Shanghai, but continued to serve as a major entrep\u00f4t. Following the Second Battle of Chuenpi in 1841, the Treaty of Nanking was signed between Sir Robert Peel on behalf of Queen Victoria and Lin Zexu on behalf of Emperor Xuanzong and ceded Hong Kong to the United Kingdom on 26 January 1841 after the agreement of the Convention of Chuenpi.\nGuangzhou is at the center of the Guangdong\u2013Hong Kong\u2013Macau Greater Bay Area, the most populous built-up metropolitan region in the world. The area extends into neighboring cities such as Foshan, Dongguan, Zhongshan, Shenzhen parts of Jiangmen and Huizhou, as well as Zhuhai and Macau, forming an urban agglomeration of about 70 million residents. It is also part of the Pearl River Delta Economic Zone. Administratively, the city holds subprovincial status and is one of China's nine National Central Cities. In the late 1990s and early 2000s, nationals of sub-Saharan Africa who had initially settled in the Middle East and Southeast Asia moved in unprecedented numbers to Guangzhou in response to the 1997/98 Asian financial crisis. The domestic migrant population from other provinces of China in Guangzhou was 40% of the city's total population in 2008. Guangzhou has one of the most expensive real estate markets in China. As of the 2020 census, the registered population of the city's expansive administrative area was 18,676,605 individuals (up 47 percent from the previous census in 2010), of whom 16,492,590 lived in 9 urban districts (all but Conghua and Zengcheng). Due to worldwide travel restrictions at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, Guangzhou Baiyun International Airport, the major airport of Guangzhou, briefly became the world's busiest airport by passenger traffic in 2020. Guangzhou is the fifth most populous city by urban resident population in China after Shanghai, Beijing, Shenzhen and Chongqing.\nIn modern commerce, Guangzhou is best known for its annual Canton Fair, the oldest and largest trade fair in China. For three consecutive years (2013\u20132015), Forbes ranked Guangzhou as the best commercial city in mainland China. Guangzhou is highly ranked as an Alpha (global first-tier) city together with San Francisco and Stockholm. It is a major Asia-Pacific finance hub, ranking 21st globally in the 2020 Global Financial Centres Index. Guangzhou also has the fifth largest number of skyscrapers in the world. As an important international city, Guangzhou has hosted numerous international and national sporting events, the most notable being the 2010 Asian Games, the 2010 Asian Para Games, and the 2019 FIBA Basketball World Cup. The city hosts 65 foreign representatives, making it the major city hosting the third most foreign representatives in China, after Beijing and Shanghai. As of 2020, Guangzhou ranked 10th in the world and 5th in China\u2014after Beijing, Shanghai, Hong Kong and Shenzhen\u2014for the number of billionaire residents by the Hurun Global Rich List. Guangzhou is one of the nation's leading hubs for academia and academic research, ranking 6th globally as well as 4th in the Asia-Pacific region, and is home to numerous Double First-Class Universities, including Sun Yat-sen University and SCUT.\nToponymy.\n is the official romanization of the Chinese name . The name of the city is taken from the ancient Gu\u01ceng Prefecture after it had become the prefecture's seat of government. The character \u5ee3 or \u5e7f means 'broad' or 'expansive'.\nBefore acquiring its current name, the town was known as Panyu (Puny\u00fc; \u756a\u79ba), a name still borne by one of Guangzhou's districts not far from the main city. The origin of the name is still uncertain, with 11 various explanations being offered, including that it may have referred to two local mountains. The city has also sometimes been known as Guangzhou\u00a0Fu or Guangfu after its status as the capital of a prefecture. From this latter name, Guangzhou was known to medieval Persians such as Al-Masudi and Ibn Khordadbeh as Khanfu (). Under the Southern Han, the city was renamed Xingwang Fu ().\nThe Chinese abbreviation for Guangzhou is \u7a57, pronounced in Cantonese and in Mandarin\u2014although the abbreviation on car license plates, as with the rest of the province, is \u7ca4), after its nickname \"City of Rice\" (\u7a57\u57ce). The city has long borne the nickname City of Rams (\u7f8a\u57ce) or City of the Five Rams (\u4e94\u7f8a\u57ce) from the five stones at the old Temple of the Five Immortals said to have been the sheep or goats ridden by the Taoist culture heroes credited with introducing rice cultivation to the area around the time of the city's foundation. The former name \"City of the Immortals\" (\u4ed9\u57ce/) came from the same story. The more recent City of Flowers (\u82b1\u57ce) is usually taken as a simple reference to the area's fine greenery.\nThe English name \"Canton\" derived from Portuguese , a blend of dialectal pronunciations of \"Guangdong\" (e.g., Cantonese \"Gwong2-dung1\"). Although it originally and chiefly applied to the walled city, it was occasionally conflated with Guangdong by some authors. It was adopted as the Postal Map Romanization of Guangzhou, and remained the official name until its name change to \"Guangzhou\". As an adjective, it is still used in describing the people, language, cuisine and culture of Guangzhou and the surrounding Liangguang region. The 19th-century name was \"Kwang-chow foo\".\nHistory.\nPrehistory.\nA settlement now known as Nanwucheng was present in the area by 1100 BC. Some traditional Chinese histories placed Nanwucheng's founding during the reign of King Nan of Zhou, emperor of Zhou from 314 to 256 BC. It was said to have consisted of little more than a stockade of bamboo and mud.\nNanyue.\nGuangzhou, then known as Panyu, was founded on the eastern bank of the Pearl River in 214 BC. Ships commanded by tradespersons arrived on the South China coast in the late antiquity. Surviving records from the Tang dynasty confirm, that the residents of Panyu observed a range of trade missions. Records on foreign trade ships reach upon til the late 20th century.\nPanyu was the seat of Qin Empire's Nanhai Commandery, and served as a base for the first invasion of the Baiyue lands in southern China. Legendary accounts claimed that the soldiers at Panyu were so vigilant that they did not remove their armor for three years. Upon the fall of the Qin, General Zhao Tuo established the kingdom of Nanyue and made Panyu its capital in 204 BC. It remained independent throughout the Chu-Han Contention, although Zhao negotiated recognition of his independence in exchange for his nominal submission to the Han in 196 BC. Archeological evidence shows that Panyu was an expansive commercial center: in addition to items from central China, archeologists have found remains originating from Southeast Asia, India, and even Africa. Zhao Tuo was succeeded by Zhao Mo and then Zhao Yingqi. Upon Zhao Yingqi's death in 115 BC, his younger son Zhao Xing was named as his successor in violation of Chinese primogeniture. By 113 BC, his Chinese mother, the Empress Dowager Jiu () had prevailed upon him to submit Nanyue as a formal part of the Han Empire. The native prime minister L\u00fc Jia () launched a coup, killing Han ambassadors along with the king, his mother, and their supporters. A successful ambush then annihilated a Han force which had been sent to arrest him. Emperor Wu of Han took offense and launched a massive riverine and seaborne war: six armies under Lu Bode and Yang Pu took Panyu and annexed Nanyue by the end of 111\u00a0BC.\nImperial China.\nIncorporated into the Han dynasty, Panyu became a provincial capital. In AD 226, it became the seat of Guang Prefecture, which gave it its modern name. The \"Old Book of Tang\" described Guangzhou as an important port in southern China. Direct routes connected the Middle East and China, as shown in the records of a Chinese prisoner returning home from Iraq twelve years after his capture at Talas. Relations were often strained: while China was undergoing the An Lushan Rebellion, Arab and Persian pirates sacked the city on 30 October 758 and in revenge thousands of Arabs and Persians were killed by Chinese rebels in the Yangzhou massacre (760). In the Guangzhou massacre about 200,000 Arab, Persian and other foreigners were killed by Chinese rebel Huang Chao in 878, along with the city's Jews, Christians, and Parsis. The port was closed for fifty years after its destruction.\nAmid the Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms that followed the collapse of the Tang dynasty, the Later Liang governor Liu Yan used his base at Panyu to establish a \"Great Yue\" or \"Southern Han\" empire, which lasted from 917 to 971. The region enjoyed considerable cultural and economic success in this period. From the 10th to 12th century, there are records that the large foreign communities were not exclusively men, but included \"Persian females\". According to Odoric of Pordenone, Guangzhou was as large as three Venices in terms of area, and rivaled all of Italy in the amount of crafts produced. He also noted the large amount of ginger available as well as large geese and snakes. Guangzhou was visited by the Moroccan traveler Ibn Battuta during his journey around the world in the 14th century. He detailed the process by which the Chinese constructed their large ships in the port's shipyards.\nShortly after the Hongwu Emperor's declaration of the Ming dynasty, he reversed his earlier support of foreign trade and imposed the first of a series of sea bans (). These banned private foreign trade upon penalty of death for the merchant and exile for his family and neighbors. Previous maritime intendancies of Guangzhou, Quanzhou, and Ningbo were closed in 1384 and legal trade became limited to the tribute delegations sent to or by official representatives of foreign governments.\nFollowing the Portuguese conquest of the Melaka Sultanate, Rafael Perestrello traveled to Guangzhou as a passenger on a native junk in 1516. His report induced Fern\u00e3o Pires de Andrade to sail to the city with eight ships the next year, but De Andrade's exploration was understood as spying and his brother Sim\u00e3o and others began attempting to monopolize trade, enslaving Chinese women and children, engaging in piracy, and fortifying the island of Tam\u00e3o. Rumors even circulated that Portuguese were eating the children. The Guangzhou administration was charged with driving them off: they bested the Portuguese at the Battle of Tunmen and in Xicao Bay; held a diplomatic mission hostage in a failed attempt to pressure the restoration of the sultan of Malacca, who had been accounted a Ming vassal; and, after placing them in cangues and keeping them for most of a year, ultimately executed 23 by lingchi. With the help of local pirates, the \"Folangji\" then carried out smuggling at Macao, Lampacau, and St John's Island (now Shangchuan), until Leonel de Sousa legalized their trade with bribes to Admiral Wang Bo () and the 1554 Luso-Chinese Accord. The Portuguese undertook not to raise fortifications and to pay customs dues; three years later, after providing the Chinese with assistance suppressing their former pirate allies, the Portuguese were permitted to warehouse their goods at Macau instead of Guangzhou itself.\nIn October 1646, the Longwu Emperor's brother, Zhu Yuyue fled by sea to Guangzhou, the last stronghold of the Ming empire. On December 11, he declared himself the Shaowu Emperor, borrowing his imperial regalia from local theater troupes. He led a successful offense against his cousin Zhu Youlang but was deposed and executed on January 20, 1647, when the Ming turncoat Li Chengdong () sacked the city on behalf of the Qing.\nThe Qing became somewhat more receptive to foreign trade after gaining control of Taiwan in 1683. The Portuguese from Macau and Spaniards from Manila returned, as did private Muslim, Armenian, and English traders. From 1699 to 1714, the French and British East India Companies sent a ship or two each year; the Austrian Ostend General India Co. arrived in 1717, the Dutch East India Co. in 1729, the Danish Asiatic Co. in 1731, and the Swedish East India Co. the next year. These were joined by the occasional Prussian or Trieste Company vessel. The first independent American ship arrived in 1784, and the first colonial Australian one in 1788. By that time, Guangzhou was one of the world's greatest ports, organized under the Canton System. The main exports were tea and porcelain. As a meeting place of merchants from all over the world, Guangzhou became a major contributor to the rise of the modern global economy. Guangzhou is the site of the Thirteen Factories, which were the only legal place to conduct foreign trade with China from 1757 to 1842.xviii\nIn the 19th century, most of the city's buildings were still only one or two stories. However, there were notable exceptions such as the Flower Pagoda of the Temple of the Six Banyan Trees, and the guard tower known as the Five-Story Pagoda. The subsequently urbanized northern hills were bare and covered with traditional graves. The brick city walls were about in circumference, high, and wide. Its eight main gates and two water gates all held guards during the day and were closed at night. The wall rose to incorporate a hill on its northern side and was surrounded on the other three by a moat which, along with the canals, functioned as the city's sewer, emptied daily by the river's tides. A partition wall with four gates divided the northern \"old town\" from the southern \"new town\" closer to the river; the suburb of Xiguan (Saikwan; \"West Gate\") stretched beyond and the boats of fishers, traders, and Tanka (\"boat people\") almost entirely concealed the riverbank for about . It was common for homes to have a storefront facing the street and to treat their courtyards as a kind of warehouse. The city was part of a network of signal towers so effective that messages could be relayed to Beijing\u2014about away\u2014in less than 24 hours.\nThe Canton System was maintained until the outbreak of the First Opium War in 1839. Following a series of battles in the Pearl River Delta, the British captured Canton on March 18, 1841. The Second Battle of Canton was fought two months later. Following the Qing's 1842 treaty with Great Britain, Guangzhou lost its privileged trade status as more and more treaty ports were opened to more and more countries, usually including extraterritorial enclaves. Amid the decline of Qing prestige and the chaos of the Red Turban Rebellion (1854\u20131856), the Punti and Hakka waged a series of clan wars from 1855 to 1867 in which one million people died. The foreign trade facilities were destroyed by local Chinese in the Arrow War (1856\u20131858). The international community relocated to the outskirts and most international trade moved through Shanghai.\nThe concession for the Guangzhou\u2013Hankou railway was awarded to the American China Development Company in 1898. It completed its branch line west to Foshan and Sanshui before being engulfed in a diplomatic crisis after a Belgian consortium bought a controlling interest and the Qing subsequently canceled its concession. J. P. Morgan was awarded millions in damages and the line to Wuchang was not completed until 1936 and the completion of a unified Beijing\u2013Guangzhou railway waited until the completion of Wuhan's Yangtze River Bridge in 1957.\nModern China.\nRevolutions.\nDuring the late Qing dynasty, Guangzhou was the site of revolutionary attempts such as the Uprisings of 1895 and 1911 that were the predecessors of the successful 1911 Revolution, which overthrew the Qing dynasty. The 72 revolutionaries whose bodies were found after the latter uprising are honored as the city's 72 Martyrs at the Huanghuagang (\"Yellow Flower Mound\") Mausoleum.\nRepublic of China.\nAfter the assassination of Song Jiaoren and Yuan Shikai's attempts to remove the Nationalist Party of China from power, the leader of Guangdong Hu Hanmin joined the 1913 Second Revolution against him but was forced to flee to Japan with Sun Yat-sen after its failure. The city came under national spotlight again in 1917, when Prime Minister Duan Qirui's abrogation of the constitution triggered the Constitutional Protection Movement. Sun Yat-sen came to head the Guangzhou Military Government supported by the members of the dissolved parliament and the Southwestern warlords. The Guangzhou government fell apart as the warlords withdrew their support. Sun fled to Shanghai in November 1918 until the Guangdong warlord Chen Jiongming restored him in October 1920 during the Yuegui Wars. On June 16, 1922, Sun was ousted in a coup and fled on the warship \"Yongfeng\" after Chen sided with the Zhili clique's Beijing government. In the following months Sun mounted a counterattack into Guangdong by rallying supporters from Yunnan and Guangxi, and in January established a government in the city for the third time.\nFrom 1923 to 1926, Sun Yat-sen and the Kuomintang (KMT) used the city as a base to prosecute a renewed revolution in China by conquering the warlords in the north. Although Sun was previously dependent on opportunistic warlords who hosted him in the city, with the leadership of Chiang Kai-shek, the KMT developed its own military power to serve its ambition. The Canton years saw the evolution of the KMT into a revolutionary movement with a strong military focus and ideological commitment, setting the tone of the KMT rule of China beyond 1927.\nIn 1924, the KMT made the momentous decision to ally with the Communist Party and the USSR. With Soviet help, KMT reorganized itself along the Leninist line and adopted a pro-labor and pro-peasant stance. The KMT\u2013CCP cooperation was confirmed in the 1st National Congress of the KMT and the communists were instructed to join the KMT. The allied government set up the Peasant Movement Training Institute in the city, of which Mao Zedong was a director for one term. Sun and his military commander Chiang used Soviet funds and weapons to build an armed force staffed by communist commissars, training its cadres in the Whampoa Military Academy. In August, the fledgling army suppressed the Canton Merchants' Corps Uprising. The next year the anti-imperialist May Thirtieth Movement swept the country, and the KMT government called for strikes in Canton and Hong Kong. The tensions of the massive strikes and protests led to the Shakee Massacre.\nAfter the death of Sun Yat-sen in 1925 the mood was changing in the party toward the communists. In August the left-wing KMT leader Liao Zhongkai was assassinated and the right-wing leader Hu Hanmin, the suspected mastermind, was exiled to the Soviet Union, leaving the pro-communist Wang Jingwei in charge. Opposing communist encroachment, the right-wing Western Hills Group vowed to expel the communists from the KMT. The Canton Coup on March 20, 1926, saw Chiang solidify his control over the Nationalists and their army against Wang Jingwei, the party's left wing, its Communist allies, and its Soviet advisors. By May, he had ended civilian control of the military and begun his Northern Expedition against the warlords of the north. Its success led to the split of the KMT between Wuhan and Nanking and the purge of the communists in the April 12 Incident. Immediately afterwards Canton joined the purge under the auspice of Li Jishen, resulting in the arrest of communists and the suspension of left wing KMT apparatuses and labor groups. Later in 1927 when Zhang Fakui, a general supportive of the Wuhan faction, seized Canton and installed Wang Jingwei's faction in the city, the communists saw an opening and launched the Guangzhou Uprising. Prominent communist military leaders Ye Ting and Ye Jianying led the failed defense of the city. Soon, control of the city reverted to Li Jishen.\nLi Jishen was deposed during a war between Chiang and the New Guangxi clique. By 1929, Chen Jitang had established himself as the powerholder of Guangdong. In 1931 he threw his weight behind the anti-Chiang schism by hosting a separate Nationalist government in Guangzhou. The opposition to Chiang included KMT leaders like Wang Jingwei, Sun Fo and others from diverse factions. The peace negotiations amid the armed standoff led to the 4th National Congress of Kuomintang being held separately by three factions in Nanjing, Shanghai, and Canton. Resigning all his posts, Chiang pulled off a political compromise that reunited all factions. While the intraparty division was resolved, Chen kept his power until he was defeated by Chiang in 1936. During World War II, the Canton Operation subjected the city to Japanese occupation by the end of December 1938.\nPeople's Republic of China.\nAmid the closing months before total Communist victory, Guangzhou briefly served as the capital of the Republican government. Guangzhou was captured on October 14, 1949. Amid a massive exodus to Hong Kong and Macau, defeated Nationalist forces blew up the Haizhu Bridge across the Pearl River in retreat. The Cultural Revolution had a large effect on the city, with many of its temples, churches and other monuments destroyed during this chaotic period.\nThe People's Republic of China initiated building projects including new housing on the banks of the Pearl River to adjust the city's boat people to life on land. Since the 1980s, the city's close proximity to Hong Kong and its ties to overseas Chinese made it one of the first beneficiaries of China's opening up under Deng Xiaoping. Beneficial tax reforms in the 1990s also helped the city's industrialization and economic development.\nThe municipality was expanded in the year 2000, with Huadu and Panyu joining the city as urban districts and Conghua and Zengcheng as more rural counties. The former districts of Dongshan and Fangcun were abolished in 2005, merged into Yuexiu and Liwan respectively. The city acquired Nansha and Luogang. The former was carved out of Panyu, the latter from parts of Baiyun, Tianhe, Zengcheng, and an exclave within Huangpu. The National People's Congress approved a development plan for the Pearl River Delta in January 2009; on March 19 of the same year, the Guangzhou and Foshan municipal governments agreed to establish a framework to merge the two cities. In 2014, Luogang merged into Huangpu and both Conghua and Zengcheng counties were upgraded to districts.\nOn 16 June 2022 an EF2 tornado struck the city, causing major power outages and knocking out power to the city's subway lines.\nGeography.\nThe old town of Guangzhou was near Baiyun Mountain on the east bank of the Pearl River (Zhujiang) about from its junction with the South China Sea and about below its head of navigation. It commanded the rich alluvial plain of the Pearl River Delta, with its connection to the sea protected at the Humen Strait. The present city spans on both sides of the river from 112\u00b0 57\u2032 to 114\u00b0 03\u2032 E longitude and 22\u00b0 26\u2032 to 23\u00b0 56\u2032 N latitude in south-central Guangdong. The Pearl is the 4th-largest river of China. Intertidal ecosystems exist on the tidal flat lining the river estuary, however, many of the tidal flats have been reclaimed for agriculture. Baiyun Mountain is now locally referred to as the city's \"lung\" ().\nThe elevation of the prefecture generally increases from southwest to northeast, with mountains forming the backbone of the city and the ocean comprising the front. Tiantang Peak is the highest point of elevation at above sea level.\nNatural resources.\nThere are 47 different types of minerals and also 820 ore fields in Guangzhou, including 18 large and medium-sized oil deposits. The major minerals are granite, cement limestone, ceramic clay, potassium, albite, salt mine, mirabilite, nepheline, syenite, fluorite, marble, mineral water, and geothermal mineral water. Since Guangzhou is located in the water-rich area of southern China, it has a wide water area with many rivers and water systems, accounting for 10% of the total land area. The rivers and streams improve the landscape and keep the ecological environment of the city stable.\nWater resources.\nThe main characteristics of Guangzhou's water resources are that there are relatively few local water resources and relatively abundant transit water resources. The city's water area is 74,400 hectares, accounting for 10.05% of the city's land area. The main rivers include Beijiang, Dongjiang North Mainstream, Zengjiang, Liuxi River, Baini River, Pearl River Guangzhou Reach, Shiqiao Waterway, and Shawan Waterway. Beijiang, The Dongjiang River flows through Guangzhou City and merges with the Pearl River to flow into the sea. The local average total water resources is 7.979 billion cubic meters, including 7.881 billion cubic meters of surface water and 1.487 billion cubic meters of groundwater. Calculated based on the amount of local water resources and the permanent population counted in the sixth census in 2010, there are 1.0601 million cubic meters of water resources per square kilometer, with an average of 628 cubic meters per capita, which is one-half of the country's per capita water resources. The amount of water resources for transit passengers is 186.024 billion cubic meters, which is 23 times the total local water resources. The passenger water resources are mainly concentrated in the southern Wanghe District and Zengcheng District. The passenger water resources diverted from the Xijiang and Beijiang Rivers into Guangzhou City are 159.15 billion cubic meters, and the passenger water resources diverted from the Dongjiang River into the north mainstream of the Dongjiang River are 14.203 billion cubic meters. meters and the water inflow from the upper reaches of the Zengjiang River is 2.828 billion cubic meters. The southern river network area is in the tidal influence area, with large runoff and a strong tidal effect. The three major entrances of the Pearl River, Humen, Jiaomen, and Hongqili, enter the Lingding Ocean and exit the South China Sea in the south of Guangzhou City. The annual high tide volume is 271 billion cubic meters and the annual ebb tide volume is 408.8 billion cubic meters. The annual runoff of the three major entrances is 137.7 billion cubic meters. Compared with meters, the annual tide can bring a large amount of water, part of which is freshwater resources that can be utilized.\nBiological Resources.\nCultivated crops in Guangzhou have the distinctive characteristics of the transition from the tropics to the subtropics, and it is one of the richest regions in China in terms of fruit tree resources, including three major categories of tropical, subtropical, and temperate zones, 41 families, 82 genera and 174 species, totaling more than 500 varieties (among which there are 55 major varieties of lychee). It is the center of origin and variety of lychee, longan, yellow skin, black (white) olive, and so on. Vegetables are known for their high quality and variety, with 15 major categories, 127 species, and more than 370 varieties. Flowers include fresh cut flowers (fresh cut flowers, fresh cut leaves, fresh cut branches), potted plants (potted flowers, bonsai, flower bed plants), ornamental seedlings, edible and medicinal flowers, industrial and other uses of flowers, lawns, seedlings, etc. More than 3,000 traditional varieties and in recent years the introduction of new varieties, development, and utilization. Grain, cash crops, livestock, poultry, aquatic products, wild animals, and a wide variety of famous and excellent varieties, including Zengcheng Simiao rice is the first protected variety in Guangzhou City to obtain geographical indications.\nMineral Resources.\nThe geological structure of Guangzhou City is quite complex, with good conditions for mineralization. Forty-seven kinds of minerals (including subspecies) have been discovered, with 820 mineral sites and 25 large and medium-sized mining areas. The main minerals are granite for construction, limestone for cement, ceramic clay, potassium, sodium feldspar, salt mines, manganese, nepheline orthoclase, fluorite, marble, mineral water, and thermal mineral water. Energy minerals and non-ferrous minerals in the area are in short supply, sporadically distributed, small in scale, and unstable in grade.\nClimate.\nDespite being located just south of the Tropic of Cancer, Guangzhou has a humid subtropical climate (K\u00f6ppen \"Cwa\") influenced by the East Asian monsoon. Summers are wet with high temperatures, high humidity, and a high heat index. Winters are mild and comparatively dry. Guangzhou has a lengthy monsoon season, spanning from April through September. Monthly averages range from in January to in July, while the annual mean is . Autumn, from October to December, is very moderate, cool and windy, and is the best travel time. The relative humidity is approximately 76 percent, whereas annual rainfall in the metropolitan area is over . With monthly percent possible sunshine ranging from 17 percent in March to 51 percent in October, the city receives 1,559 hours of bright sunshine annually, considerably less than nearby Shenzhen and Hong Kong. Extreme temperatures since 1951 have ranged from on 11 February 1957 and 23 December 1999 to on 1 July 2004, though an unofficial record low of , in which modern meteorologists believe it to be was recorded on 18 January 1893 and for the station that begun records in 1912 located in Huangpu District, an unofficial record low of was recorded on 8 December 1934. The last recorded snowfall in the city was on January 24, 2016, 87 years after the second last recorded snowfall.\nAdministrative divisions.\nGuangzhou is a sub-provincial city. It has direct jurisdiction over eleven districts:\nEconomy.\nGuangzhou is the main manufacturing hub of the Pearl River Delta, one of China's leading commercial and manufacturing regions. In 2021, its GDP reached \u00a52,823 billion (US$444.37 billion in nominal), making it the 2nd largest economy in the South-Central China region after Shenzhen. Guangzhou's GDP (nominal) was $444.37 billion in 2021, exceeding that Guangzhou's per capita was \u00a5151,162 ($23,794 in nominal). Guangzhou is considered one of the most prosperous cities in China. Guangzhou ranks 10th in the world and 5th in China (after Beijing, Shanghai, Hong Kong and Shenzhen) in terms of the number of billionaires according to the Hurun Global Rich List 2020. Guangzhou is projected to be among the world top 10 largest cities in terms of nominal GDP in 2035 (together with Shanghai, Beijing and Shenzhen in China) according to a study by Oxford Economics, and its nominal GDP per capita will reach above $42,000 in 2030. Guangzhou also ranks 21st globally (between Washington, D.C., and Amsterdam) and 8th in the whole Asia &amp; Oceania region (behind Shanghai, Tokyo, Hong Kong, Singapore, Beijing, Shenzhen and Dubai) in the 2020 Global Financial Centers Index (GFCI). Owing to rapid industrialization, it was once also considered a rather polluted city. After green urban planning was implemented, it is now one of the most livable cities in China.\nZhujiang New Town.\nZhujiang New Town is the central business district of Guangzhou in the 21st century. It covers 6.44\u00a0km2 in Tianhe District. Multiple financial institutions are headquartered in this area.\nCanton Fair.\nThe Canton Fair, formally the \"China Import and Export Fair\", is held every year in April and October by the Ministry of Trade. Inaugurated in the spring of 1957, the fair is a major event for the city. It is the trade fair with the longest history, highest level, and largest scale in China. From the 104th session onwards, the fair moved to the new Guangzhou International Convention and Exhibition Center () in Pazhou, from the older complex in Liuhua. The GICEC is served by two stations on Line 8, one station on Line 11 and three stations on Tram Line THZ1. Since the 104th session, the Canton Fair has been arranged in three phases instead of two phases.\nBusiness Environment.\nGuangzhou is a hub for international businesses. According to an article by China Briefing, over 30,000 foreign-invested companies had settled in Guangzhou by 2018, including 297 Fortune Global 500 companies with projects and 120 Fortune Global 500 companies with headquarters or regional headquarters in the city.\nDemographics.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Module:Historical populations/styles.css\"/&gt;\nThe 2010 census found Guangzhou's population to be 12.78 million. As of 2014[ [update]], it was estimated at 13,080,500, with 11,264,800 urban residents. Its population density is thus around 1,800 people per km2. The built-up area of the Guangzhou proper connects directly to several other cities. The built-up area of the Pearl River Delta Economic Zone covers around and has been estimated to house 22 million people, including Guangzhou's nine urban districts, Shenzhen (5.36m), Dongguan (3.22m), Zhongshan (3.12m), most of Foshan (2.2m), Jiangmen (1.82m), Zhuhai (890k), and Huizhou's Huiyang District (760k). The total population of this agglomeration is over 28 million after including the population of the adjacent Hong Kong Special Administrative Region. The area's fast-growing economy and high demand for labor has produced a huge \"floating population\" of migrant workers; thus, up to 10 million migrants reside in the area least six months each year. In 2008, about five million of Guangzhou's permanent residents were migrant workers.\nEthnicity and language.\nMost of Guangzhou's population is Han Chinese. Almost all Cantonese people speak Cantonese as their first language, while most migrants speak forms of Mandarin. In 2010, each language was the native tongue of roughly half of the city's population, although minor but substantial numbers speak other varieties as well. In 2018, He Huifeng of the \"South China Morning Post\" stated that younger residents have increasingly favored using Mandarin instead of Cantonese in their daily lives, causing their Cantonese-speaking grandparents and parents to use Mandarin to communicate with them. He Huifeng stated that factors included local authorities discouraging the use of Cantonese in schools and the rise in prestige of Mandarin-speaking Shenzhen. Jinan University released a survey result of the Guangzhou youths born in the year 2000 or after that were part of this educational study showed that 69% could still speak and understand Cantonese, 20% can understand Cantonese, but unable to speak it, and 11% completely had no knowledge of Cantonese. Jinan University's study of these Guangzhou youths also indicated when it came to the daily recreational use of Cantonese, roughly 40%-50% of them participated in these recreational functions with the usage of Cantonese with 51.4% of them in mobile games, 47% in Social Platforms, 44.1% in TV shows, and 39.8% in Books and Newspapers. Despite some decline in the use of Cantonese, it is faring better in survival, popularity, and prestige than other Chinese languages due to the historical pride in the language and culture, as well as the wide popularity and availability of mainstream Cantonese entertainment, which encourages locals to retain the Cantonese language. As of the 2020s, additional renewed efforts were introduced to preserve the local Cantonese language and culture with some limited Cantonese language classes now being taught in some schools as well as hosting Cantonese appreciation cultural events along with hosting activities that cater to the local Cantonese culture and language as well as many local Cantonese speaking families are now placing much stronger emphasis on their children to speak Cantonese to preserve the culture and language. In a 2018 report study by Shan Yunming and Li Sheng, the report showed that 90% of people living in Guangzhou are bilingual in both Cantonese and Mandarin, though fluency will vary depending on if they are locally born to the city and the surrounding Guangdong province or migrants from other provinces, which shows how much importance the Cantonese language still has in the city despite the strict policy rules from the government to be using Mandarin as the country's official language. Guangzhou has an even more unbalanced gender ratio than the rest of the country. While most areas of China have 112\u2013120 boys per 100 girls, the Guangdong province that houses Guangzhou has more than 130 boys for every 100 girls.\nGuangzhou also possesses a large resident population who are Hakka people. There are seven administrative districts in Guangzhou with a considerable Hakka population: Zengcheng District, Huadu District, Conghua District, Baiyun District, Tianhe District, Yuexiu District and Panyu District. It is estimated that in Zengcheng district and Huadu district of Guangzhou, Hakka speakers account for about 40 percent and a third of the district's population.\nRecent years have seen a huge influx of migrants, with up to 30 million additional migrants living in the Guangzhou area for at least six months out of every year with the majority being female migrants and many becoming local Guangzhou people. This huge influx of people from other areas, called the floating population, is due to the city's fast-growing economy and high labor demands. Guangzhou Mayor Wan Qingliang told an urban planning seminar that Guangzhou is facing a very serious population problem stating that, while the city had 10.33 million registered residents at the time with targets and scales of land use based on this number, the city actually had a population with migrants of nearly 15 million. According to the Guangzhou Academy of Social Sciences researcher Peng Peng, the city is almost at its maximum capacity of just 15 million, which means the city is facing a great strain, mostly due to a high population of unregistered people.\nAccording to the 2000 National Census, marriage is one of the top two reasons for permanent migration and is particularly important for women as 29.3% of the permanent female migrants migrate for marriage [Liang et al., 2004]. Many of the female economic migrants marry men from Guangzhou in hopes of a better life. but like elsewhere in the People's Republic of China, the household registration system (\"hukou\") limits migrants' access to residences, educational institutions and other public benefits. It has been noted that many women end up in prostitution. In May 2014, legally employed migrants in Guangzhou were permitted to receive a \"hukou\" card allowing them to marry and obtain permission for their pregnancies in the city, rather than having to return to their official hometowns as previously.\nHistorically, the Cantonese people have made up a sizable part of the 19th- and 20th-century Chinese diaspora; in fact, many overseas Chinese have ties to Guangzhou. This is particularly true in the United States, Canada, and Australia.\nDemographically, the only significant immigration into China has been by overseas Chinese, but Guangzhou sees many foreign tourists, workers, and residents from the usual locations such as the United States. Notably, it is also home to thousands of African immigrants, including people from Nigeria, Somalia, Angola and the Democratic Republic of Congo.\nMetropolitan area.\nThe encompassing metropolitan area was estimated by the OECD (Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development) to have, as of 2010[ [update]], a population of 25 million.\nDevelopment of Guangzhou.\nGong et al. 2018 report on the development of Guangzhou from 1990 until 2020, showing how in 1990, the developed residential districts were almost exclusively concentrated in a small part of western Guangzhou whereas other parts of Guangzhou had a smaller limited amount of developed residential communities being overwhelmingly surrounded by agricultural and forest lands. However, from 2005 until 2020, other parts of the city eventually began to develop more so residential communities and in the 2020 map report, it showed fully developed residential communities going from west to east of the city whereas the very southern part and large portions of northern Guangzhou still remain mainly agricultural and forest lands with very limited developed residential communities.\nTransportation.\nUrban mass transit.\nWhen the first line of the Guangzhou Metro opened in 1997, Guangzhou was the fourth city in Mainland China to have an underground railway system, behind Beijing, Tianjin, and Shanghai. As of 2025, the metro network is made up of nineteen lines, covering a total length of more than . It is the third busiest metro system in the world and the 3rd largest in terms of length. In addition to the metro system there is also the Haizhu Tram line which opened on December 31, 2014.\nThe Guangzhou Bus Rapid Transit (GBRT) system which was introduced in 2010 along Zhongshan Road. It has several connections to the metro and is the world's 2nd-largest bus rapid transit system with 1,000,000 passenger trips daily. It handles 26,900 pphpd during the peak hour a capacity second only to the TransMilenio BRT system in Bogota. The system averages one bus every 10 seconds or 350 per hour in a single direction and contains the world's longest BRT stations\u2014around including bridges.\nMotor transport.\nIn the 19th century, the city already had over 600 long, straight streets; these were mostly paved but still very narrow. In June 1919, work began on demolishing the city wall to make way for wider streets and the development of tramways. The demolition took three years in total.\nIn 2009, it was reported that all 9,424 buses and 17,695 taxis in Guangzhou would be operating on LPG-fuel by 2010 to promote clean energy for transport and improve the environment ahead of the 2010 Asian Games which were held in the city. At present, Guangzhou is the city that uses the most LPG-fueled vehicles in the world, and at the end of 2006, 6,500 buses and 16,000 taxis were using LPG, taking up 85 percent of all buses and taxis\nEffective January 1, 2007, the municipal government banned motorcycles in Guangdong's urban areas. Motorcycles found violating the ban are confiscated. The Guangzhou traffic bureau claimed to have reported reduced traffic problems and accidents in the downtown area since the ban.\nAirports.\nGuangzhou's main airport is the Baiyun International Airport in Baiyun District; it opened on August 5, 2004. This airport is the second busiest airport in terms of traffic movements in China. It replaced the old Baiyun International Airport, which was very close to the city center but failed to meet the city's rapidly growing air traffic demand. The old Baiyun International Airport was in operation for 72 years. Guangzhou Baiyun International Airport now has three runways, with two more planned. Terminal 2 opened on April 26, 2018. Another airport located in Zengcheng District is under planning.\nGuangzhou is also served by Hong Kong International Airport; ticketed passengers can take ferries from the Lianhuashan Ferry Terminal and Nansha Ferry Port in Nansha District to the HKIA Skypier. There are also coach bus services connecting Guangzhou with HKIA.\nRail.\nGuangzhou is the terminus of the Beijing\u2013Guangzhou, Guangzhou\u2013Shenzhen, Guangzhou\u2013Maoming and Guangzhou\u2013Meizhou\u2013Shantou conventional speed railways. In late 2009, the Wuhan\u2013Guangzhou high-speed railway started service, with multiple unit trains covering at a top speed of . In December 2014, the Guiyang\u2013Guangzhou high-speed railway and Nanning-Guangzhou railway began service with trains running at top speeds of and , respectively. The Guangdong Through Train departs from the Guangzhou East railway station and arrives at the Hung Hom station in Kowloon, Hong Kong. The route is approximately in length and the ride takes less than two hours. Frequent coach services are also provided with coaches departing every day from different locations (mostly major hotels) around the city. A number of regional railways radiating from Guangzhou started operating such as the Guangzhou\u2013Zhuhai intercity railway and the Guangzhou-Foshan-Zhaoqing intercity railway.\nWater transport.\nThere are daily high-speed catamaran services between Nansha Ferry Terminal and Lianhua Shan Ferry Terminal in Guangzhou and the Hong Kong China Ferry Terminal, as well as between Nansha Ferry Terminal and Macau Ferry Pier in Hong Kong.\nCulture.\nGuangzhou's culture is mainly Cantonese culture, which is a subset of the larger \"Southern\" or the \"Lingnan\" culture, followed by Hakka culture. Notable aspects of Cantonese cultural heritage include:\nThe Guangzhou Opera House and Symphony Orchestra also perform classical Western music and Chinese compositions in their style. Cantonese music is a traditional style of Chinese instrumental music, while Cantopop is the local form of pop music and rock-and-roll which developed from neighboring Hong Kong.\nCantonese language, Cantonese cuisine and Cantonese opera are the shared culture of the whole Guangdong region, not just the important cultural components of Guangzhou city. With a population of diverse background, the culture of Guangzhou also includes other categories, such as Hakka culture and language.\nIn the Hakka people inhabited areas of Guangzhou, Hakka culture has been well developed and preserved, and in the long history, the integration of Canton culture and Hakka culture has derived new cultural characteristics. Zengcheng, Guangzhou is a district with a history of more than 1800 years, with the harmonious coexistence of Canton culture and Hakka culture, the derived food culture has not only the non-heritage food such as Zhengguo Wonton, Lanxi Rice Noodle, and Goose Soup, but also the special food such as Yuecun Dace Fish Skin, Paitan Roasted Chicken, and Shitan Whole Cattle Banquet.\nReligions.\nBefore the postmodern era, Guangzhou had about 124 religious pavilions, halls, and temples. Today, in addition to the Buddhist Association, Guangzhou also has a Taoist Association, a Jewish community, as well as a history with Christianity, reintroduced to China by colonial powers.\nTaoism.\nTaoism and Chinese folk religion are still represented at a few of the city's temples. Among the most important is the Temple of the Five Immortals, dedicated to the Five Immortals credited with introducing rice cultivation at the foundation of the city. The five rams they rode were supposed to have turned into stones upon their departure and gave the city several of its nicknames. However, the temple has not been restored as a Taoist temple status yet. Other famous temples include the City God Temple of Guangzhou and Sanyuan Palace. During the Cultural Revolution, all Taoist temples and shrines were practically destroyed or damaged by the red guards. Only a handful of them like Sanyuan Palace were restored during the 1980s. Guangzhou, like most of southern China, is also notably observant and continues the practice of Chinese ancestral worship during major festive occasions like the Qing Ming Festival and Zhong Yuan Festival.\nBuddhism.\nBuddhism is the most prominent religion in Guangzhou. The Zhizhi Temple was founded in AD\u00a0233 from the estate of a Wu official; it is said to comprise the residence of Zhao Jiande, the last of the Nanyue kings, and has been known as the Guangxiao Temple (\"Temple of Bright Filial Piety\") since the Ming dynasty. The Buddhist missionary monk, Bodhidharma is traditionally said to have visited Panyu during the Liu Song or Liang dynasty (5th or 6th century). Around AD\u00a0520, Emperor Wu of the Liang ordered the construction of the Baozhuangyan Temple and the Xilai Monastery to store the relics of Cambodian Buddhist saints which had been brought to the city and to house the monks beginning to assemble there. The Baozhuangyan is now known as the Temple of the Six Banyan Trees, after a famous poem composed by Su Shi after a visit during the Northern Song. The Xilai Monastery was renamed as the Hualin Temple (\"Flowery Forest Temple\") after its reconstruction during the Qing dynasty.\nThe temples were badly damaged by both the Republican campaign to \"Promote Education with Temple Property\" () and the PRC's Cultural Revolution but have been renovated since the opening up that began in the 1980s. The Ocean Banner Temple on Henan Island, once famous in the west as the only tourist spot in Guangzhou accessible to foreigners, has been reopened as the Hoi Tong Monastery.\nChristianity.\nNestorian Christians first arrived in China via the overland Silk Road, but suffered during Emperor Wuzong's 845 persecution and were essentially extinct by the year 1000. The Qing-era ban on foreigners limited missionaries until it was abolished following the First Opium War, although the Protestant Robert Morrison was able to perform some work through his service with the British factory. The Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Guangzhou is housed at Guangzhou's Sacred Heart Cathedral, known locally as the \"Stone House\". A Gothic Revival edifice which was built by hand from 1861 to 1888 under French direction, its original Latin and French stained-glass windows were destroyed during the wars and amid the Cultural Revolution; they have since been replaced by English ones. The Canton Christian College (1888) and Hackett Medical College for Women (1902) were both founded by missionaries, they were known in Chinese as Lingnan University and later incorporated into Sun Yat-sen University. Since the opening up of China in the 1980s, there has been renewed interest in Christianity, but Guangzhou maintains pressure on underground churches which avoid registration with government officials. The Catholic archbishop Dominic Tang was imprisoned without trial for 22 years; however, his present successor is recognized by both the Vatican and China's Patriotic Church.\nIslam.\nGuangzhou has had ties with the Islamic world since the Tang dynasty. Relations were often strained: Arab and Persian pirates sacked the city on October 30, 758; the port was subsequently closed for fifty years. Their presence came to an end under the revenge of Chinese rebel Huang Chao in 878, along with that of the Jews, Christians, and Parsis. Nowadays, the city is home to halal restaurants. The city is renowned for the Huaisheng Mosque, built in 627 by Sa'd ibn Abi Waqqas, a Companion of the Prophet who came to China in the 620s.\nSports.\nThe 11,468 seat Guangzhou Gymnasium was a 2019 FIBA Basketball World Cup venue.\nFrom November 12 to 27, 2010, Guangzhou hosted the 16th Asian Games. The same year, it hosted the first Asian Para Games from December 12 to 19. Combined, these were the major sporting events the city ever hosted.\nGuangzhou also hosted the following major sporting events:\nCurrent professional sports clubs based in Guangzhou include:\nIn the 2010s, Guangzhou became a Chinese football powerhouse, having won eight national titles between 2011 and 2019. The team also won the AFC Champions League in 2013 and 2015. As a result, Guangzhou participated in the 2013 and 2015 FIFA Club World Cup, where it lost 3\u20130 in the semifinal stage against the 2012\u201313 UEFA Champions League winners Bayern Munich and the 2014\u201315 UEFA Champions League winners Barcelona, respectively.\nRestaurants.\nIn the 1990s the local press prolifically published reviews of restaurants in Guangzhou. The local newspapers introduced lifestyle pages and relied on infotainment to raise revenue.\nDestinations.\nEight Views.\nThe Eight Views of Ram City are Guangzhou's eight most famous tourist attractions. They have varied over time since the Song dynasty, with some being named or demoted by emperors. The following modern list was chosen through public appraisal in 2025:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nParks and gardens.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nTourist attractions.\nGuangzhou attracts more than 223 million visitors each year, and the total revenue of the tourism exceeded 400 billion in 2018. There are many tourist attractions, including:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nPedestrian streets.\nIn every district there are many shopping areas where people can walk on the sidewalks; however most of them are not set as pedestrian streets.\nThe popular pedestrian streets are:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nMalls and shopping centers.\nThere are many malls and shopping centers in Guangzhou. The majority of the new malls are located in the Tianhe district.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nMajor buildings.\n \n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nMedia.\nGuangzhou has two local radio stations: the provincial Radio Guangdong and the municipal Radio Guangzhou. Together they broadcast in more than a dozen channels. The primary language of both stations is Cantonese. Traditionally only one channel of Radio Guangdong is dedicated to Mandarin Chinese. However, in recent years there has been an increase in Mandarin programs on most Cantonese channels. Radio stations from cities around Guangzhou mainly broadcast in Cantonese and can be received in different parts of the city, depending on the radio stations' locations and transmission power. The Beijing-based China National Radio also broadcasts Mandarin programs in the city. Radio Guangdong has a 30-minute weekly English programs, \"Guangdong Today\", which is broadcast globally through the World Radio Network. Daily English news programs are also broadcast by Radio Guangdong.\nGuangzhou has some of the most notable Chinese-language newspapers and magazines in mainland China, most of which are published by three major newspaper groups in the city, the Guangzhou Daily Press Group, Nanfang Press Corporation, and the Yangcheng Evening News Group. The two leading newspapers of the city are \"Guangzhou Daily\" and \"Southern Metropolis Daily\". The former, with a circulation of 1.8 million, has been China's most successful newspaper for 14 years in terms of advertising revenue, while \"Southern Metropolis Daily\" is considered one of the most liberal newspapers in mainland China. In addition to Guangzhou's Chinese-language publications, there are a few English magazines and newspapers. The most successful is \"That's Guangzhou\", which started more than a decade ago and has since blossomed into \"That's PRD\", producing expatriate magazines in Beijing and Shanghai as well. It also produces \"In the Red\".\nEducation and research.\nThe Guangzhou Higher Education Mega Center, also known as Guangzhou University Town (), is a large tertiary education complex located in the southeast suburbs of Guangzhou. It occupies the entirety of Xiaoguwei Island in Panyu District, covering an area of about . The complex accommodates campuses from ten higher education institutions and can eventually accommodate up to 200,000 students, 20,000 teachers, and 50,000 staff.\nAs of June 2023, Guangzhou hosts 84 institutions of higher education (excluding adult colleges), ranking 2nd nationwide after Beijing and 1st in South China region. The city has many highly ranked educational institutions, with seven universities listed in 147 National Key Universities under the Double First-Class Construction, ranking fourth nationwide (after Beijing, Shanghai and Nanjing). Two reputable ones are Sun Yat-sen University and South China University of Technology, ranking 65 and 101-150 worldwide, respectively. Guangzhou is also an important hub for international students and it was ranked 110th globally by the QS Best Student Cities Rankings in 2023.\nGuangzhou is a major Asia-Pacific R&amp;D hub, ranking 6th globally, 4th in the Asia &amp; Oceania regions after (Beijing, Shanghai and Nanjing) and 1st in South Central China region. When compared to other countries in the region, Guangzhou ranked higher than India, securing fourth place in Asia and Oceania after China, Japan, and South Korea, according to the Nature Index for 2025. For instance, Guangzhou's share of the 2024 Nature Index is 1,820.05, with a count of 3,966, while India's share is 1,783.34, with 2,733 counts.\nThe Guangzhou Higher Education Mega Center's higher education campuses are as follows:\nGuangzhou's other fully accredited and degree-granting universities and colleges include:\nThe two main comprehensive libraries are Guangzhou Library and Sun Yat-sen Library of Guangdong Province. Guangzhou Library is a public library in Guangzhou. The library has moved to a new building in Zhujiang New Town, which fully opened on June 23, 2013. Sun Yat-sen Library of Guangdong Province has the largest collection of ancient books in Southern China.\nInternational relations.\nConsulates General/consulates.\nAs of April 2023, Guangzhou hosts 68 foreign consulates-general/consulates, excluding the Hong Kong and Macao trade office, making it one of the major cities to host more than 50 foreign representatives in China after Beijing and Shanghai.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nExternal links.\nstyle=\"width:100%\" class=\"wraplinks\""}
{"id": "12539", "revid": "50949313", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=12539", "title": "Genitive case", "text": "Grammatical case\nIn grammar, the genitive case (abbreviated gen) is the grammatical case that marks a word, usually a noun, as modifying another word, also usually a noun\u2014thus indicating an attributive relationship of one noun to the other noun. A genitive can also serve purposes indicating other relationships. For example, some verbs may feature arguments in the genitive case; and the genitive case may also have adverbial uses (see adverbial genitive).\nThe genitive construction includes the genitive case, but is a broader category. Placing a modifying noun in the genitive case is one way of indicating that it is related to a head noun, in a genitive construction. However, there are other ways to indicate a genitive construction. For example, many Afroasiatic languages place the head noun (rather than the modifying noun) in the construct state.\nPossessive grammatical constructions, including the possessive case, may be regarded as subsets of the genitive construction. For example, the genitive construction \"pack of dogs\" is similar, but not identical in meaning to the possessive case \"dogs' pack\" (and neither of these is entirely interchangeable with \"dog pack\", which is neither genitive nor possessive). Modern English is an example of a language that has a possessive case rather than a \"conventional\" genitive case. That is, Modern English indicates a genitive construction with either the possessive clitic suffix \"-'s\", or a prepositional genitive construction such as \"x of y\". However, some irregular English pronouns do have possessive forms which may more commonly be described as genitive (see English possessive). The names of the astronomical constellations have genitive forms which are used in star names, for example the star Mintaka in the constellation Orion (genitive Orionis) is also known as Delta Orionis or 34 Orionis.\nMany languages have a genitive case, including Albanian, Arabic, Armenian, Basque, Danish, Dutch, Estonian, Finnish, Georgian, German, Greek, Gothic, Hungarian, Icelandic, Irish, Kannada, Latin, Latvian, Lithuanian, Malayalam, Nepali, Romanian, Sanskrit, Scottish Gaelic, Swedish, Tamil, Telugu, all Slavic languages except Bulgarian and Macedonian, and most of the Turkic languages.\nFunctions.\nDepending on the language, specific varieties of genitive-noun\u2013main-noun relationships may include:\nDepending on the language, some of the relationships mentioned above have their own distinct cases different from the genitive.\nPossessive pronouns are distinct pronouns, found in Indo-European languages such as English, that function like pronouns inflected in the genitive. They are considered separate pronouns if contrasting to languages where pronouns are regularly inflected in the genitive. For example, English \"my\" is either a separate possessive adjective or an irregular genitive of \"I\", while in Finnish, for example, \"minun\" is regularly agglutinated from \"minu-\" \"I\" and \"-n\" (genitive).\nIn some languages, nouns in the genitive case also agree in case with the nouns they modify (that is, it is marked for two cases). This phenomenon is called suffixaufnahme.\nIn some languages, nouns in the genitive case may be found in inclusio \u2013 that is, between the main noun's article and the noun itself.\nEnglish.\nOld English had a genitive case, which has left its mark in modern English in the form of the possessive ending \"'s\" (now sometimes referred to as the \"Saxon genitive\"), as well as possessive adjective forms such as \"his\", \"their\", etc., and in certain words derived from adverbial genitives such as \"once\" and \"afterwards\". (Other Old English case markers have generally disappeared completely.) The modern English possessive forms are not normally considered to represent a grammatical case, although they are sometimes referred to as genitives or as belonging to a possessive case. One of the reasons that the status of \"'s\" as a case ending is often rejected is that it does not behave as such, but rather as a clitic marking that indicates that a dependency relationship exists between phrases. One can say \"the King's war\", but also \"the King of France's war\", where the genitive marker is attached to the full noun phrase \"the King of France\", whereas case markers are normally attached to the head of a phrase.\nIn languages having a true genitive case, such as Old English, this example may be expressed as \"\u00fees cynges wyrre of France\", literally \"the King's war of France\", with the \"'s\" attaching to \"the King\".\nFinnic genitives and accusatives.\nFinnic languages (Finnish, Estonian, etc.) have genitive cases.\nIn Finnish, prototypically the genitive is marked with \"-n\", e.g. \"maa\u00a0\u2013 maan\" \"country\u00a0\u2013 of the country\". The stem may change, however, with consonant gradation and other reasons. For example, in certain words ending in consonants, \"-e-\" is added, e.g. \"mies\u00a0\u2013 miehen\" \"man\u00a0\u2013 of the man\", and in some, but not all words ending in \"-i\", the \"-i\" is changed to an \"-e-\", to give \"-en\", e.g. \"lumi\u00a0\u2013 lumen\" \"snow\u00a0\u2013 of the snow\". The genitive is used extensively, with animate and inanimate possessors. In addition to the genitive, there is also a partitive case (marked \"-ta/-t\u00e4\" or \"-a/-\u00e4\") used for expressing that something is a part of a larger mass, e.g. \"joukko miehi\u00e4\" \"a group of men\".\nIn Estonian, the genitive marker \"-n\" has elided with respect to Finnish. Thus, the genitive always ends with a vowel, and the singular genitive is sometimes (in a subset of words ending with a vocal in nominative) identical in form to nominative. However, there are multiple strategies to form genitives from nominative forms ending in consonants, including addition of an unpredictable vowel, syncope, or even disfixation.\nIn Finnish, in addition to the uses mentioned above, there is a construct where the genitive is used to mark a surname. For example, \"Juhani Virtanen\" can be also expressed \"Virtasen Juhani\" (\"Juhani of the Virtanens\").\nA complication in Finnic languages is that the accusative case \"-(e)n\" is homophonic to the genitive case. This case does not indicate possession, but is a syntactic marker for the object, additionally indicating that the action is telic (completed). In Estonian, it is often said that only a \"genitive\" exists. However, the cases have completely different functions, and the form of the accusative has developed from *\"-(e)m\". (The same sound change has developed into a synchronic mutation of a final \"m\" into \"n\" in Finnish, e.g. genitive \"syd\u00e4men\" vs. nominative \"syd\u00e4n\".) This homophony has exceptions in Finnish, where a separate accusative \"-(e)t\" is found in pronouns, e.g. \"kenet\" \"who (telic object)\", vs. \"kenen\" \"whose\".\nA difference is also observed in some of the related S\u00e1mi languages, where the pronouns and the plural of nouns in the genitive and accusative are easily distinguishable from each other, e.g., \"ku\u00e4'c\u01e9\u01e9mi\" \"eagles' (genitive plural)\" and \"ku\u00e4'c\u01e9\u01e9mid\" \"eagles (accusative plural)\" in Skolt Sami.\nGerman.\nIt is also called \"second case\" in some German language educational sources in Chinese.\nConjugation.\nArticles.\n is used. See German articles.\nNouns.\nGerman uses for masculine and neutral nouns to label genitive case. For feminine, the noun itself does not change.\nSingular masculine nouns (and one neuter noun) of the weak declension are marked with an (or rarely ) ending in the genitive case:\nAdjectives.\nThe declension of adjectives in the genitive case is as follows:\nPersonal pronouns.\nThe genitive personal pronouns are quite rare and either very formal, literary or outdated. They are as follows (with comparison to the nominative pronouns):\nSome examples:\nRelative pronouns.\nUnlike the personal ones, the genitive relative pronouns are in regular use and are as follows (with comparison to the nominative relative pronouns):\nSome examples:\nUsage.\nNouns.\nThe genitive case is often used to show possession or the relation between nouns:\nA simple is added to the end of a name:\nPrepositions.\nThe genitive case is also commonly found after certain prepositions:\nAdjectives.\nThe genitive case can sometimes be found in connection with certain adjectives:\nVerbs.\nThe genitive case is occasionally found in connection with certain verbs (some of which require an accusative before the genitive); they are mostly either formal or legal:\nGreek.\nThe ablative case of Indo-European was absorbed into the genitive in Classical Greek. This added to the usages of the \"genitive proper\", the usages of the \"ablatival genitive\". The genitive occurs with verbs, adjectives, adverbs and prepositions. See also Genitive absolute.\nHungarian.\nThe Hungarian genitive is constructed using the suffix \"-\u00e9\".\nThe genitive \"-\u00e9\" suffix is only used with the predicate of a sentence: it serves the role of mine, yours, hers, etc. The possessed object is left in the nominative case. For example:\nIf the possessor is not the predicate of the sentence, the genitive is not used. Instead, the possessive suffixes (\"-(j)e\" or \"-(j)a\" in the third person singular, depending on vowel harmony) mark the possessed object. The possessor is left in the nominative if it directly precedes the possessed object (otherwise it takes a dative \"-nak/-nek\" suffix). For example: \nIn addition, the suffix \"-i\" ('of') is also used. For example:\nJapanese.\nJapanese construes the genitive by using the grammatical particle \"no\" \u306e. It can be used to show a number of relationships to the head noun. For example:\n\u732b\u306e\u624b \"neko-no te\" (\"cat's paw\")\n\u5b66\u751f\u306e\u4e00\u4eba \"gakusei-no hitori\" (\"one of the students\")\n\u91d1\u306e\u6307\u8f2a \"kin-no yubiwa\" (\"a ring of gold\")\n\u4eac\u90fd\u306e\u3069\u3053 \"Kyouto-no doko\" (\"where of (in) Kyoto\")\n\u5bcc\u58eb\u306e\u5c71 \"Fuji-no yama\" (\"the mountain of Fuji\" [Mt. Fuji])\nThe archaic genitive case particle \"-ga\" \uff5e\u304c is still retained in certain expressions, place names, and dialects. Possessive \"ga\" can also be written as a small ke (), for example in .\nTypically, languages have nominative case nouns converting into genitive case. It has been found, however, that the Kansai dialect of Japanese will in rare cases allow accusative case to convert to genitive, if specific conditions are met in the clause in which the conversion appears. This is referred to as \"Accusative-Genitive conversion.\"\nLatin.\nThe genitive is one of the cases of nouns and pronouns in Latin. Latin genitives still have certain modern scientific uses:\nIrish.\nThe Irish language also uses a genitive case (\"tuiseal ginideach\"). For example, in the phrase \"bean an t\u00ed\" (woman of the house), \"t\u00ed\" is the genitive case of \"teach\", meaning \"house\". Another example is \"barr an chnoic\", \"top of the hill\", where \"cnoc\" means \"hill\", but is changed to \"chnoic\", which also incorporates lenition.\nMandarin.\nIn Mandarin Chinese, the genitive case is made by use of the particle \u7684 (de).\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Interlinear/styles.css\" /&gt;\nHowever, about persons in relation to oneself, \u7684 is often dropped when the context allows for it to be easily understood.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Interlinear/styles.css\" /&gt;\nPersian.\nOld Persian had a true genitive case inherited from Proto-Indo-European. By the time of Middle Persian, the genitive case had been lost and replaced by an analytical construction which is now called Ez\u0101fe. This construction was inherited by New Persian, and was also later borrowed into numerous other Iranic, Turkic and Indo-Aryan languages of Western and South Asia.\nSemitic languages.\nGenitive case marking existed in Proto-Semitic, Akkadian, and Ugaritic. It indicated possession, and it is preserved today only in Arabic.\nNominative: \"\u0161arrum\" (king)\nGenitive: \"a\u0161\u0161at \u0161arrim\" (wife of king = king's wife)\nArabic.\nCalled \u0627\u0644\u0645\u062c\u0631\u0648\u0631 \"al-majr\u016br\" (meaning \"dragged\") or \u0627\u0644\u0645\u062e\u0641\u0648\u0636 \"al-makhf\u016b\u1e0d\" (meaning \"lowered\") in Arabic, the genitive case functions both as an indication of ownership (ex. the door of the house) and for nouns following a preposition.\nNominative: \u064c\u0628\u064a\u062a \"baytun\" (a house)\nGenitive: \u064d\u0628\u0627\u0628\u064f \u0628\u064a\u062a \"b\u0101bu baytin\" (door of a house) \u0650\u0628\u0627\u0628\u064f \u0627\u0644\u0628\u064a\u062a \"b\u0101bu l-bayti\" (door of the house)\nThe Arabic genitive marking also appears after prepositions.\ne.g. \u064d\u0628\u0627\u0628\u064c \u0644\u0628\u064a\u062a \"b\u0101bun li-baytin\" (a door for a house)\nThe Semitic genitive should not be confused with the pronominal possessive suffixes that exist in all the Semitic languages\ne.g. Arabic \u0628\u064a\u062a\u064a \"bayt-\u012b\" (my house) \u064e\u0643\u062a\u0627\u0628\u064f\u0643 \"kit\u0101bu-ka\" (your [masc.] book).\nSlavic languages.\nWith the exception of Bulgarian and Macedonian, all Slavic languages decline the nouns and adjectives in accordance with the genitive case using a variety of endings depending on the word's lexical category, its gender, number (singular or plural) and in some cases meaning. For instance, in Russian Broutona (lit. Broughton's) island name, its genitive/possessive case is created by adding \"a\" affix to the explorer's name.\nPossessives.\nTo indicate possession the ending of the noun indicating the possessor changes depending on the word's ending in the nominative case. \nFor example, to \"a, u, i\", or \"y\" in Polish, \"\u0430, \u044f, \u044b\", or \"\u0438\" in Russian, \"\u0430, \u044f, y, \u044e, \u0456, \u0438\" or \"\u0435\u0439\" in Ukrainian, and similar cases in other Slavic languages.\nNominative: (pol.) \"Oto Anton\" / (rus.) \"\u0412\u043e\u0442 \u0410\u043d\u0442\u043e\u043d\" / (ukr.) \"\u041e\u0441\u044c \u0410\u043d\u0442\u043e\u043d\" (\"Here is Anton\").\nGenitive: (pol.) \"Oto obiad Anton\u0430\" / (rus.) \"\u0412\u043e\u0442 \u043e\u0431\u0435\u0434 \u0410\u043d\u0442\u043e\u043d\u0430\" / (ukr.) \"\u041e\u0441\u044c o\u0431\u0456\u0434 \u0410\u043d\u0442\u043e\u043d\u0430\" (\"Here is Anton's lunch\").\nPossessives can also be formed by the construction (pol.) \"u [subject] jest [object]\" / (rus.) \"\u0423 [subject] \u0435\u0441\u0442\u044c [object]\"/ (ukr.) \"\u0443(\u0432) [subject] \u0454 [object]\"\nNominative: (pol.) \"Oto Anton\" / (rus.) \"\u0412\u043e\u0442 \u0410\u043d\u0442\u043e\u043d\" / (ukr.) \"\u041e\u0441\u044c \u0410\u043d\u0442\u043e\u043d\" (\"Here is Anton\").\nGenitive: (pol.) \"u Anton\u0430 jest obiad / (rus.) \"\u0423 \u0410\u043d\u0442\u043e\u043d\u0430 \u0435\u0441\u0442\u044c \u043e\u0431\u0435\u0434\" / (ukr.) \"\u0423(\u0412) \u0410\u043d\u0442\u043e\u043d\u0430 \u0454 \u043e\u0431\u0456\u0434\" (\"Anton has a lunch\", literally: \"(There) is a lunch at Anton's\").\nIn sentences where the possessor includes an associated pronoun, the pronoun also changes:\nNominative: (pol.)

(In the first case [subject] is Irene, and in the second case [subject] is virtual, it is \"the space\" at Irene's place, not Irene herself)\nGenitive: (rus.) \"\u0423 \u0418\u0440\u0435\u043d\u044b/\u041a\u043e\u0440\u043d\u0435\u043b\u0438\u0438 \u043d\u0435\u0442 \u043e\u0431\u0435\u0434\u0430\" (\"Irene/Kornelia does not have a lunch\", literally: \"(There) is no lunch at Irene's/Kornelia's\"). \nThe Russian word \"\u043d\u0435\u0442\" is a contraction of \"\u043d\u0435\" + \"\u0435\u0441\u0442\u044c\". \nIn Russian there is no distinction between [subject] not having an [object] and [object] not being present at [subject]'s.\nGenitive: (ukr.) \"\u0406\u0440\u0435\u043d\u0430/\u041a\u043e\u0440\u043d\u0435\u043b\u0456\u044f \u043d\u0435 \u043c\u0430\u0454 \u043e\u0431\u0456\u0434\u0443 (\"Irene does not have a lunch\") or (ukr.) \"y \u0406\u0440\u0435\u043d\u0438/\u041a\u043e\u0440\u043d\u0435\u043b\u0456\u0457 \u043d\u0435\u043c\u0430(\u0454) \u043e\u0431\u0456\u0434\u0443 (\"At Irene's does not have a lunch\") \nNote the difference between the spelling \"\u043d\u0435 \u043c\u0430\u0454 [object]\" and \"\u043d\u0435\u043c\u0430(\u0454) [object]\" in both cases.\nTo express negation.\nThe genitive case is also used in sentences expressing negation, even when no possessive relationship is involved. The ending of the subject noun changes just as it does in possessive sentences. The genitive, in this sense, can only be used to negate nominative, accusative and genitive sentences, and not other cases.\nNominative: (pol.) \"(Czy) Maria jest w domu?\" / (rus.) \"\u041c\u0430\u0440\u0438\u044f \u0434\u043e\u043c\u0430?\" / (\u0427\u0438) \u041c\u0430\u0440\u0456\u044f (\u0454) \u0432\u0434\u043e\u043c\u0430?

Some East Slavic languages ( e.g. Russian and Belarusian) employ either the accusative or genitive for negation, although the genitive is more commonly used. In Czech, Slovak and Serbo-Croatian, negating with the genitive case is perceived as rather archaic and the accusative is preferred, but genitive negation in these languages is still not uncommon, especially in music and literature.\nPartial direct object.\nThe genitive case is used with some verbs and mass nouns to indicate that the action covers only a part of the direct object (having a function of non-existing partitive case), whereas similar constructions using the Accusative case denote full coverage. Compare the sentences:\nGenitive: (pol.) \"Napi\u0142em si\u0119 wody\" / (rus.) \"\u042f \u043d\u0430\u043f\u0438\u043b\u0441\u044f \u0432\u043e\u0434\u044b\" / (ukr.) \"\u042f \u043d\u0430\u043f\u0438\u0432\u0441\u044f \u0432\u043e\u0434\u0438\" (\"I drank water,\" i.e. \"I drank some water, part of the water available\")\nAccusative: (pol.) \"Wypi\u0142em wod\u0119\" / (rus.) \"\u042f \u0432\u044b\u043f\u0438\u043b \u0432\u043e\u0434\u0443 / (ukr.) \"\u042f \u0432\u0438\u043f\u0438\u0432 \u0432\u043e\u0434\u0443 (\"I drank the water,\" i.e. \"I drank all the water, all the water in question\")\nIn Russian, special partitive case or sub-case is observed for some uncountable nouns which in some contexts have preferred alternative form on -\u0443/\u044e instead of standard genitive on -\u0430/\u044f: \u0432\u044b\u043f\u0438\u043b \u0447\u0430\u044e ('drank some tea'), but \u0441\u043e\u0440\u0442\u0430 \u0447\u0430\u044f ('sorts of tea').\nPrepositional constructions.\nThe genitive case is also used in many prepositional constructions. (Usually when some movement or change of state is involved, and when describing the source / destination of the movement. Sometimes also when describing the manner of acting.) \nTurkish.\nThe Turkish genitive, formed with a genitive suffix for the possessor, is used in combination with a possessive for the possessed entity, formed with a possessive suffix. For example, in \"my mother's mother\", the possessor is \"my mother\", and the possessed entity is \"[her] mother\". In Turkish:\nNominative: \"anne\" (\"mother\");\nFirst-person possessive: \"annem\" (\"my mother\");\nThird-person possessive: \"annesi\" (\"[someone]'s mother\"); \nGenitive of \"annem\": \"annemin\" (\"my mother's\");\nGenitive and possessive combined: \"annemin annesi\" (\"my mother's mother\", i.e., \"my maternal grandmother\").\nAlbanian.\nThe genitive in Albanian is formed with the help of clitics. For example:\nNominative: \"lib\u00ebr\" ('book'); \"vajz\u00eb\" ('girl'); \nGenitive: \"libri i vajz\u00ebs\" (the girl's book)\nIf the possessed object is masculine, the clitic is \"i\". If the possessed object is feminine, the clitic is \"e\". If the possessed object is plural, the clitic is \"e\" regardless of the gender.\nThe genitive is used with some prepositions: \"me an\u00eb\" ('by means of'), \"nga ana\" ('on behalf of', 'from the side of'), \"p\u00ebr arsye\" ('due to'), \"p\u00ebr shkak\" ('because of'), \"me p\u00ebrjashtim\" ('with the exception of'), \"n\u00eb vend\" ('instead of').\nArmenian.\nThe genitive in Armenian is generally formed by adding \"-\u056b\":\nNominative: \u0561\u0572\u057b\u056b\u056f ('girl'); \u0563\u056b\u0580\u0584 ('book');\nGenitive: \u0561\u0572\u057b\u056b\u056f\u056b \u0563\u056b\u0580\u0584\u0568 (\"the girl's book\").\nHowever, there are certain words that are not formed this way. For example, words with \u0578\u0582\u0576 change to \u0561\u0576:\nNominative: \u057f\u0578\u0582\u0576 ('house'), Genitive: \u057f\u0561\u0576 (\"house's\").\nDravidian languages.\nKannada.\nIn Kannada, the genitive case-endings are:\nfor masculine or feminine nouns ending in \"\u0c85\" (a): \u0ca8 (na)\nfor neuter nouns ending in \"\u0c85\" (a): \u0ca6 (da)\nfor all nouns ending in \"\u0c87\" (i), \"\u0c88\" (\u012b), \"\u0c8e\" (e), or \"\u0c8f\" (\u0113): \u0c85 (a)\nfor all nouns ending in \"\u0c89\" (u), \"\u0c8a\" (\u016b), \"\u0c8b\" (r\u0325), or \"\u0ce0\" (r\u0325\u0304): \u0c87\u0ca8 (ina)\nMost postpositions in Kannada take the genitive case.\nTamil.\nIn Tamil, the genitive case ending is the word \u0b89\u0b9f\u0bc8\u0baf or \u0b87\u0ba9\u0bcd, which signifies possession. Depending on the last letter of the noun, the genitive case endings may vary.\nIf the last letter is a consonant (\u0bae\u0bc6\u0baf\u0bcd \u0b8e\u0bb4\u0bc1\u0ba4\u0bcd\u0ba4\u0bc1), like \u0b95\u0bcd, \u0b99\u0bcd, \u0b9a\u0bcd, \u0b9e\u0bcd, \u0b9f\u0bcd, \u0ba3\u0bcd, \u0ba4\u0bcd, \u0ba8\u0bcd, \u0baa\u0bcd, \u0bae\u0bcd, \u0baf\u0bcd, \u0bb0\u0bcd, \u0bb2\u0bcd, \u0bb5\u0bcd, \u0bb4\u0bcd, then the suffix \u0b89\u0b9f\u0bc8\u0baf/\u0b87\u0ba9\u0bcd gets added. *Examples: His: \u0b85\u0bb5\u0ba9\u0bcd + \u0b89\u0b9f\u0bc8\u0baf = \u0b85\u0bb5\u0ba9\u0bc1\u0b9f\u0bc8\u0baf, Doctor's: \u0bae\u0bb0\u0bc1\u0ba4\u0bcd\u0ba4\u0bc1\u0bb5\u0bb0\u0bcd + \u0b89\u0b9f\u0bc8\u0baf = \u0bae\u0bb0\u0bc1\u0ba4\u0bcd\u0ba4\u0bc1\u0bb5\u0bb0\u0bc1\u0b9f\u0bc8\u0baf, \u0bae\u0bb0\u0bc1\u0ba4\u0bcd\u0ba4\u0bc1\u0bb5\u0bb0\u0bcd + \u0b87\u0ba9\u0bcd = \u0bae\u0bb0\u0bc1\u0ba4\u0bcd\u0ba4\u0bc1\u0bb5\u0bb0\u0bbf\u0ba9\u0bcd Kumar's: \u0b95\u0bc1\u0bae\u0bbe\u0bb0\u0bcd + \u0b89\u0b9f\u0bc8\u0baf = \u0b95\u0bc1\u0bae\u0bbe\u0bb0\u0bc1\u0b9f\u0bc8\u0baf, \u0b95\u0bc1\u0bae\u0bbe\u0bb0\u0bcd+ \u0b87\u0ba9\u0bcd = \u0b95\u0bc1\u0bae\u0bbe\u0bb0\u0bbf\u0ba9\u0bcd\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "12541", "revid": "40552684", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=12541", "title": "Gematria", "text": "Numerological practice of reading a word or phrase as a number\nIn numerology, gematria (; or , plural or , borrowed via Aramaic from ) is the practice of assigning a numerical value to a name, word, or phrase by reading it as a number, or sometimes by using an alphanumeric cipher. The letters of the alphabets involved have standard numerical values, but a word can yield several values if a cipher is used.\nAccording to Aristotle (384\u2013322 BCE), isopsephy, based on the Greek numerals developed in the city of Miletus in Anatolia, was part of the Pythagoreanism, which originated in the 6th century BCE. The first evidence of use of Hebrew letters as numbers dates to 78 BCE; gematria is still used in Jewish culture. Similar systems have been used in other languages and cultures, derived from or inspired by either Greek isopsephy or Hebrew gematria, and include Arabic abjad numerals and English gematria.\nThe most common form of Hebrew gematria is used in the Talmud and Midrash as in Jerusalem Talmud, Genesis Rabba 95:3, and elaborately in Rabbinic literature. It involves reading words and sentences as numbers and assigning numerical instead of phonetic values to each letter of the Hebrew alphabet. When read as numbers, they can be compared and contrasted with other words or phrases; cf. the Hebrew proverb (, lit.\u2009'wine entered, secret went out', i.e. ). The gematric value of ('wine') is 70 (=10; =10; =50) and this is also the gematric value of ('secret', =60; =6; =4)\u200e, cf. Babylonian Talmud, tractate Sanhedrin 38a.\nGematria sums can involve single words or lengthy strings of calculations. A short example of Hebrew numerology that uses gematria is the word , which is composed of two letters that (using the assignments in the table shown below) add up to 18. This has made 18 a \"lucky number\" among Jews. In early Jewish sources, the term can also refer to other forms of calculation or letter manipulation, for example atbash.\nEtymology.\nClassical scholars agree that the Hebrew word \"gematria\" derives from the Greek \u03b3\u03b5\u03c9\u03bc\u03b5\u03c4\u03c1\u03af\u03b1 \"ge\u014dmetri\u0101\", \"geometry\", though some scholars believe it derives from \u03b3\u03c1\u03b1\u03bc\u03bc\u03b1\u03c4\u03b5\u03b9\u03b1 \"grammateia\" \"knowledge of writing\". It is likely that both Greek words had an influence on the formation of the Hebrew word. Some hold it to derive from the order of the Greek alphabet, gamma being the third letter of the Greek alphabet (\"gamma tria\").\nThe word has been extant in English since at least the 17th century from translations of works by Giovanni Pico della Mirandola. It is largely used in Jewish texts, notably those associated with the Kabbalah. Neither the concept nor the term appears in the Hebrew Bible itself.\nHistory.\nThe first documented use of gematria is from an Assyrian inscription dating to the 8th century BCE, commissioned by Sargon II. In this inscription, Sargon II states: \"the king built the wall of Khorsabad 16,283 cubits long to correspond with the numerical value of his name.\"\nThe practice of using alphabetic letters to represent numbers developed in the Greek city of Miletus, and is thus known as the Milesian system. Early examples include vase graffiti dating to the 6th century BCE. Aristotle wrote that the Pythgoraean tradition, founded in the 6th century BCE by Pythagoras of Samos, practiced isopsephy, the Greek predecessor of gematria. Pythagoras was a contemporary of the philosophers Anaximander, Anaximenes, and the historian Hecataeus, all of whom lived in Miletus, across the sea from Samos. The Milesian system was in common use by the reign of Alexander the Great (336\u2013323 BCE) and was adopted by other cultures during the subsequent Hellenistic period. It was officially adopted in Egypt during the reign of Ptolemy II Philadelphus (284\u2013246 BCE).\nIn early biblical texts, numbers were written out in full using Hebrew number words. The first evidence of the use of Hebrew letters as numerals appears during the late Hellenistic period, in 78 BCE. Scholars have identified gematria in the Hebrew Bible, the canon of which was fixed during the Hasmonean dynasty (c.\u2009140 BCE to 37 BCE), though some scholars argue it was not fixed until the second century CE or even later. The Hasmonean king of Judea, Alexander Jannaeus (died 76 BCE) had coins inscribed in Aramaic with the Phoenician alphabet, marking the 20th and 25th years of his reign using the letters K and KE ( and ).\nSome old Mishnaic texts may preserve very early usage of this number system, but no surviving written documents exist, and some scholars believe these texts were passed down orally and during the early stages before the Bar Kochba rebellion were never written. Gematria is not known to be found in the Dead Sea scrolls, a vast body of texts from 100 BCE\u00a0\u2013 100 CE, or in any of the documents found from the Bar-Kochba revolt circa 150 CE.\nAccording to Proclus in his commentary on the \"Timaeus\" of Plato written in the 5th century, the author Theodorus Asaeus from a century earlier interpreted the word \"soul\" (\u03c8\u03c5\u03c7\u03ae) based on gematria and an inspection of the graphical aspects of the letters that make up the word. According to Proclus, Theodorus learned these methods from the writings of Numenius of Apamea and Amelius. Proclus rejects these methods by appealing to the arguments against them put forth by the Neoplatonic philosopher Iamblichus. The first argument was that some letters have the same numerical value but opposite meaning. His second argument was that the form of letters changes over the years, and so their graphical qualities cannot hold any deeper meaning. Finally, he puts forth the third argument that when one uses all sorts of methods as addition, subtraction, division, multiplication, and even ratios, the infinite ways in which these can be combined allow virtually any number to be produced to suit any purpose.\nSome scholars propose that at least two cases of gematria appear in the New Testament. According to one theory, the reference to the miraculous \"catch of 153 fish\" in John 21:11 is an application of gematria derived from the name of the spring called 'EGLaIM in Ezekiel 47:10. The appearance of this gematria in John 21:11 has been connected to one of the Dead Sea Scrolls, namely 4Q252, which also applies the same gematria of 153 derived from Ezekiel 47 to state that Noah arrived at Mount Ararat on the 153rd day after the beginning of the flood. Some historians see gematria behind the reference to the number of the name of the Beast in Revelation as 666, which corresponds to the numerical value of the Hebrew transliteration of the Greek name \"Neron Kaisar\", referring to the 1st century Roman emperor who persecuted the early Christians. Another possible influence on the use of 666 in Revelation goes back to reference to Solomon's intake of 666 talents of gold in 1 Kings 10:14.\nGematria makes several appearances in various Christian and Jewish texts written in the first centuries of the common era. One appearance of gematria in the early Christian period is in the Epistle of Barnabas 9:6\u20137, which dates to sometime between 70 and 132 CE. There, the 318 servants of Abraham in Genesis 14:14 is used to indicate that Abraham looked forward to the coming of Jesus as the numerical value of some of the letters in the Greek name for Jesus and the 't' representing a symbol for the cross also equaled 318. Another example is a Christian interpolation in the Sibylline Oracles, where the symbolic significance of the value of 888 (equal to the numerical value of \"Iesous\", the Latinized rendering of the Greek version of Jesus' name) is asserted. Irenaeus also heavily criticized the interpretation of letters by the Gnostic Marcus. Because of their association with Gnosticism and the criticisms of Irenaeus and Hippolytus of Rome and Epiphanius of Salamis, this form of interpretation never became popular in Christianity\u2014though it does appear in at least some texts. Another two examples can be found in 3 Baruch, a text that may have either been composed by a Jew or a Christian sometime between the 1st and 3rd centuries. In the first example, a snake is stated to consume a cubit of ocean every day, but is unable to ever finish consuming it, because the oceans are also refilled by 360 rivers. The number 360 is given because the numerical value of the Greek word for snake, \"\u03b4\u03c1\u03ac\u03ba\u03c9\u03bd\", when transliterated to Hebrew () is 360. In a second example, the number of giants stated to have died during the Deluge is 409,000. The Greek word for 'deluge', \"\u03ba\u03b1\u03c4\u03b1\u03ba\u03bb\u03c5\u03c3\u03bc\u03cc\u03c2\", has a numerical value of 409 when transliterated in Hebrew characters, thus leading the author of 3 Baruch to use it for the number of perished giants.\nGematria is often used in Rabbinic literature. One example is that the numerical value of \"The Satan\" () in Hebrew is 364, and so it was said that the Satan had authority to prosecute Israel for 364 days before his reign ended on the Day of Atonement, an idea which appears in Yoma 20a and Peskita 7a. Yoma 20a states: \"Rami bar \u1e24ama said: The numerological value of the letters that constitute the word HaSatan is three hundred and sixty four: Heh has a value of five, sin has a value of three hundred, tet has a value of nine, and nun has a value of fifty. Three hundred and sixty-four days of the solar year, which is three hundred and sixty-five days long, Satan has license to prosecute.\" Genesis 14:14 states that Abraham took 318 of his servants to help him rescue some of his kinsmen, which was taken in Peskita 70b to be a reference to Eleazar, whose name has a numerical value of 318.\nThe total value of the letters of the Islamic Basmala, i.e. the phrase \"Bismillah al-Rahman al-Rahim\" (\"In the name of God, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful\"), according to the standard Abjadi system of numerology, is 786. This number has therefore acquired a significance in folk Islam and Near Eastern folk magic and also appears in many instances of pop-culture, such as its appearance in the 2006 song '786 All is War' by the band Fun-Da-Mental. A recommendation of reciting the basmala 786 times in sequence is recorded in Al-Buni. S\u00fcndermann (2006) reports that a contemporary \"spiritual healer\" from Syria recommends the recitation of the basmala 786 times over a cup of water, which is then to be ingested as medicine. The use of gematria is still pervasive in many parts of Asia and Africa.\nMethods of Hebrew gematria.\nStandard encoding.\nIn standard gematria (\"mispar hechrechi\"), each letter is given a numerical value between 1 and 400, as shown in the following table. In \"mispar gadol\", the five final letters are given their own values, ranging from 500 to 900. It is possible that this well-known cipher was used to conceal other more hidden ciphers in Jewish texts. For instance, a scribe may discuss a sum using the 'standard gematria' cipher, but may intend the sum to be checked with a different secret cipher.\nA mathematical formula for finding a letter's corresponding number in \"mispar gadol\" is:\nformula_1\nwhere \"x\" is the position of the letter in the language letters index (regular order of letters), and the floor and modulo functions are used.\nVowels.\nThe value of the Hebrew vowels is not usually counted, but some lesser-known methods include the vowels as well. The most common vowel values are as follows (a less common alternative value, based on the digit sum, is given in parentheses):\nSometimes, the names of the vowels are spelled out and their gematria is calculated using standard methods.\nOther methods.\nThere are many different methods used to calculate the numerical value for the individual Hebrew/Aramaic words, phrases or whole sentences. Gematria is the 29th of 32 hermeneutical rules countenanced by the Rabbis of the Talmud for valid aggadic interpretation of the Torah. More advanced methods are usually used for the most significant Biblical verses, prayers, names of God, etc. These methods include:\nRelated transformations.\nWithin the wider topic of gematria are included the various alphabet transformations, where one letter is substituted by another based on a logical scheme:\nMost of the above-mentioned methods and ciphers are listed by Rabbi Moshe Cordevero.\nSome authors provide lists of as many as 231 various replacement ciphers, related to the 231 mystical Gates of the \"Sefer Yetzirah\".\nDozens of other far more advanced methods are used in Kabbalistic literature, without any particular names. In Ms. Oxford 1,822, one article lists 75 different forms of gematria. Some known methods are recursive in nature and are reminiscent of graph theory or make a lot of use of combinatorics. Rabbi Elazar Rokeach (born c. 1176 \u2013 died 1238) often used multiplication, instead of addition, for the above-mentioned methods. For example, spelling out the letters of a word and then multiplying the squares of each letter value in the resulting string produces very large numbers, in orders of trillions. The spelling process can be applied recursively, until a certain pattern (e.g., all the letters of the word \"Talmud\") is found; the gematria of the resulting string is then calculated. The same author also used the sums of all possible unique letter combinations, which add up to the value of a given letter. For example, the letter Hei, which has the standard value of 5, can be produced by combining formula_10, formula_11, formula_12, formula_13, formula_14, or formula_15, which adds up to formula_16. Sometimes combinations of repeating letters are not allowed (e.g., formula_15 is valid, but formula_12 is not). The original letter itself can also be viewed as a valid combination.\nVariant spellings of some letters can be used to produce sets of different numbers, which can be added up or analyzed separately. Many various complex formal systems and recursive algorithms, based on graph-like structural analysis of the letter names and their relations to each other, modular arithmetic, pattern search and other highly advanced techniques, are found in the \"Sefer ha-Malchut\" by Rabbi David ha-Levi of the Draa Valley, a Spanish-Moroccan Kabbalist of the 15th\u201316th century. Rabbi David ha-Levi's methods also consider the numerical values and other properties of the vowels.\nKabbalistic astrology uses some specific methods to determine the astrological influences on a particular person. According to one method, the gematria of the person's name is added to the gematria of his or her mother's name; the result is then divided by 7 and 12. The remainders signify a particular planet and Zodiac sign.\nSignificance.\nIn Jewish tradition, Gematria is often used to find hidden meanings within text, especially in the Talmud. These meanings are typically derived from significant numbers in Judaism, or from the equivalence of one word to another. In the latter case, such situations are used to connect the meaning and events associated with one word to those of the other. For example, Chassidim use the fact that Amalek (\u05e2\u05de\u05dc\u05e7) and the Hebrew word for doubt (\u05e1\u05e4\u05e7) have the same value as evidence that Amalek was a symbol of doubt within the Jewish people.\nTransliterated Hebrew.\nHistorically, hermetic and esoteric groups in the UK and France of the 19th and 20th centuries used a transliterated Hebrew cipher with the Latin alphabet. In particular, the transliterated cipher was taught to members of the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn. In 1887, Samuel Liddell MacGregor Mathers, who was one of the order's founders, published the transliterated cipher in \"The Kabbalah Unveiled\" in the Mathers table.\nAs a former member of the Golden Dawn, Aleister Crowley used the transliterated cipher extensively in his writings for his two magical orders the A\u2234A\u2234 and Ordo Templi Orientis (O.T.O). Many other occult authors belonging to various esoteric groups have either mentioned the cipher or published it in their books, including Paul Foster Case of the Builders of the Adytum (B.O.T.A).\nUse in non-Semitic languages.\nGreek.\nAccording to Aristotle (384\u2013322 BCE), isopsephy, an early Milesian system using the Greek alphabet, was part of the Pythagorean tradition, which originated in the 6th century BCE.\nPlato (c. 427\u2013347 BCE) offers a discussion in the \"Cratylus\", involving a view of words and names as referring (more or less accurately) to the \"essential nature\" of a person or object and that this view may have influenced\u2014and is central to\u2014isopsephy.\nA sample of graffiti at Pompeii (destroyed under volcanic ash in 79 CE) reads \"I love the girl whose name is phi mu epsilon (545)\".\nOther examples of use in Greek come primarily from the Christian literature. Davies and Allison state that, unlike rabbinic sources, isopsephy is always explicitly stated as being used.\nLatin.\nDuring the Renaissance, systems of gematria were devised for the Classical Latin alphabet. There were a number of variations of these which were popular in Europe.\nIn 1525, Christoph Rudolff included a Classical Latin gematria in his work \"Nimble and beautiful calculation via the artful rules of algebra [which] are so commonly called \"coss\"\":\n A=1 B=2 C=3 D=4 E=5 F=6 G=7 H=8 I=9 K=10 L=11 M=12\n N=13 O=14 P=15 Q=16 R=17 S=18 T=19 U=20 W=21 X=22 Y=23 Z=24\nAt the beginning of the \"Apocalypisis in Apocalypsin\" (1532), the German monk Michael Stifel (also known as Steifel) describes the natural order and trigonal number alphabets, claiming to have invented the latter. He used the trigonal alphabet to interpret the prophecy in the Biblical Book of Revelation, and predicted the world would end at 8am on October 19, 1533. The official Lutheran reaction to Steifel's prophecy shows that this type of activity was not welcome. Belief in the power of numbers was unacceptable in reformed circles, and gematria was not part of the reformation agenda.\nAn analogue of the Greek system of isopsephy using the Latin alphabet appeared in 1583, in the works of the French poet \u00c9tienne Tabourot. This cipher and variations of it were published or referred to in the major work of Italian Pietro Bongo \"Numerorum Mysteria,\" and a 1651 work by Georg Philipp Harsd\u00f6rffer, and by Athanasius Kircher in 1665, and in a 1683 volume of \"Cabbalologia\" by Johann Henning, where it was simply referred to as the \"1683 alphabet\". It was mentioned in the work of Johann Christoph M\u00e4nnling \"The European Helicon or Muse Mountain\", in 1704, and it was also called the \"Alphabetum Cabbalisticum Vulgare\" in \"Die verliebte und galante Welt\" by Christian Friedrich Hunold in 1707. It was used by Leo Tolstoy in his 1865 work \"War and Peace\" to identify Napoleon with the number of the Beast.\nEnglish.\nEnglish Qabalah refers to several different systems of mysticism related to Hermetic Qabalah that interpret the letters of the English alphabet via an assigned set of numerological significances. The first system of English gematria was used by the poet John Skelton in 1523 in his poem \"The Garland of Laurel\".\nThe Agrippa code was used with English and Latin. It was defined by Heinrich Cornelius Agrippa in 1532, in his work \"De Occulta Philosopha\". Agrippa based his system on the order of the Classical Latin alphabet using a ranked valuation as in isopsephy, appending the four additional letters in use at the time after Z, including J (600) and U (700), which were still considered letter variants. Agrippa was the mentor of English magician John Dee, who makes reference to the Agrippa code in Theorem XVI of his 1564 book, \"Monas Hieroglyphica\".\nAlthough Aleister Crowley, as a former Adept of the Golden Dawn, used a transliterated approach to gematria in his works, since Crowley's death a number of people have proposed numerical correspondences for English gematria in order to achieve a deeper understanding of Crowley's \"The Book of the Law\" (1904). One such system, the English Qaballa, was created by English magician James Lees on November 26, 1976. The founding of Lees' magical order in 1974 and his creation of EQ are chronicled in \"All This and a Book\" by Cath Thompson.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Known for their eclectic style that fused elements of rock, blues, jazz, folk, country, bluegrass, rock and roll, gospel, reggae, and world music with psychedelia, the band is famous for improvisation during their live performances, and for their devoted fan base, known as \"Deadheads\". According to the musician and writer Lenny Kaye, the music of the Grateful Dead \"touches on ground that most other groups don't even know exists\". For the range of their influences and the structure of their live performances, the Grateful Dead are considered \"the pioneering godfathers of the jam band world\".\nThe Grateful Dead was founded in the San Francisco Bay Area during the rise of the counterculture of the 1960s. The band's founding members were Jerry Garcia (lead guitar and vocals), Bob Weir (rhythm guitar and vocals), Ron \"Pigpen\" McKernan (keyboards, harmonica, and vocals), Phil Lesh (bass guitar and vocals), and Bill Kreutzmann (drums). Members of the Grateful Dead, originally known as the Warlocks, had played together in various Bay Area ensembles, including the traditional jug band Mother McCree's Uptown Jug Champions. Lesh was the last member to join the Warlocks before they changed their name to Grateful Dead, replacing Dana Morgan Jr., who had played bass for a few gigs. Drummer Mickey Hart and non-performing lyricist Robert Hunter joined in 1967. With the exception of McKernan, who died in 1973, and Hart, who left the band from 1971 to 1974, the core of the band stayed together for its entire 30-year history. Other official members of the band included Tom Constanten (keyboards from 1968 to 1970), John Perry Barlow (non-performing lyricist from 1971 to 1995), Keith Godchaux (keyboards and occasional vocals from 1971 to 1979), Donna Godchaux (vocals from 1972 to 1979), Brent Mydland (keyboards and vocals from 1979 to 1990), and Vince Welnick (keyboards and vocals from 1990 to 1995). Bruce Hornsby (accordion, piano, vocals) was a touring member from 1990 to 1992, as well as a guest with the band on occasion before and after the tours.\nAfter Garcia's death in 1995, former members of the band, along with other musicians, toured as the Other Ones in 1998, 2000, and 2002, and as the Dead in 2003, 2004, and 2009. In 2015, the four surviving core members marked the band's 50th anniversary in a in Santa Clara, California, and Chicago that were billed as their last performances together. There have also been several spin-offs featuring one or more core members, such as Dead &amp; Company, Furthur, the Rhythm Devils, Phil Lesh and Friends, RatDog, and Billy &amp; the Kids.\nDespite having only one Top-40 single in their 30-year career, \"Touch of Grey\" (1987), the Grateful Dead remained among the highest-grossing American touring acts for decades. They gained a committed fanbase by word of mouth and through the free exchange of their live recordings, encouraged by the band's allowance of taping. In 2024, they broke the record for most Top-40 albums on the \"Billboard\" 200 chart. \"Rolling Stone\" ranked the Grateful Dead number 57 on its 2011 list of the \"100 Greatest Artists of All Time\". The band was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1994, and a recording of their May 8, 1977, performance at Cornell University's Barton Hall was added to the National Recording Registry of the Library of Congress in 2012 for being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\". In 2024, Weir, Lesh, Kreutzmann, and Hart were recognized as part of the Kennedy Center Honors.\nFormation (1965\u20131966).\nThe Grateful Dead began their career as the Warlocks, a group formed in early 1965 from the remnants of a Palo Alto, California, jug band called Mother McCree's Uptown Jug Champions and members of the Wildwood Boys (Jerry Garcia, Ron \"Pigpen\" McKernan, David Nelson, Robert Hunter, and Norm Van Maastricht). As the Wildwood Boys they played regularly at The Tangent, a folk music coffeehouse operated by Stanford Medical Center doctors Stuart \"Stu\" Goldstein and David \"Dave\" Shoenstadt on University Avenue in Palo Alto (1963). As the Warlocks, the band's first show was at Magoo's Pizza Parlor, at 639 Santa Cruz Avenue in suburban Menlo Park, on May 5, 1965, now a cocktail bar. The band continued playing bar shows, like Frenchy's Bikini-A-Go-Go in Hayward and, importantly, five sets a night, five nights a week, for six weeks, at the \"In Room\" in Belmont as the Warlocks, but quickly changed the band's name after finding out that a different band known as the Warlocks had put out a record under that name. (The Velvet Underground also had to change its name from the Warlocks.) \nThe name \"Grateful Dead\" was chosen from a dictionary. According to Lesh, Garcia \"picked up an old \"Britannica World Language Dictionary\" ... [and] ... In that silvery elf-voice he said to me, 'Hey, man, how about the Grateful Dead?'\" The definition there was \"the soul of a dead person, or his angel, showing gratitude to someone who, as an act of charity, arranged their burial.\" According to Alan Trist, director of the Grateful Dead's music publisher company Ice Nine, Garcia found the name in the Funk &amp; Wagnalls \"Folklore Dictionary\", when his finger landed on that phrase while playing a game of Fictionary. In the Garcia biography \"Captain Trips\", author Sandy Troy states that the band was smoking the psychedelic DMT at the time. The motif of the \"grateful dead\" appears in folktales from a variety of cultures.\nThe first show under the name Grateful Dead was in San Jose on December 4, 1965, at one of Ken Kesey's Acid Tests. Scholar Michael Kaler has written that the Dead's participation in the Acid Tests was crucial both to the development of their improvisational vocabulary and to their bonding as a band, with the group having set out to foster an intra-band musical telepathy. Kaler has further pointed out that the Dead's pursuit of a new improvisatory rock language in 1965 chronologically coincided with that same goal's adoption by Jefferson Airplane, Pink Floyd and the Velvet Underground.\nEarlier demo tapes have survived, but the first of over 2,000 concerts known to have been recorded by the band's fans was a show at the Fillmore Auditorium in San Francisco on January 8, 1966. Later that month, the Grateful Dead played at the Trips Festival, a three-day psychedelic rock weekend party and event produced by Ken Kesey, Stewart Brand, and Ramon Sender, that, in conjunction with the Merry Pranksters, brought the nascent hippie movement together for the first time.\nOther supporting personnel who joined early included Rock Scully, who heard of the band from Kesey and signed on as manager after meeting them at the Big Beat Acid Test; Stewart Brand, \"with his side show of taped music and slides of Indian life, a multimedia presentation\" at the Big Beat and then, expanded, at the Trips Festival; and Owsley Stanley, the \"Acid King\" whose LSD supplied the Acid Tests and who, in early 1966, became the band's financial backer, renting them a house on the fringes of Watts, Los Angeles, and buying them sound equipment. \"We were living solely off of Owsley's good graces at that time. ... [His] trip was he wanted to design equipment for us, and we were going to have to be in sort of a lab situation for him to do it\", said Garcia.\nMain career (1967\u20131995).\nPigpen era (1967\u20131972).\nOne of the group's earliest major performances in 1967 was the Mantra-Rock Dance, a musical event held on January 29, 1967, at the Avalon Ballroom by the San Francisco Hare Krishna temple. The Grateful Dead performed at the event along with the Hare Krishna founder Bhaktivedanta Swami, poet Allen Ginsberg, bands Moby Grape and Big Brother and the Holding Company with Janis Joplin, donating proceeds to the temple. The band's first LP, \"The Grateful Dead\", was released on Warner Brothers in 1967.\nClassically trained trumpeter Phil Lesh performed on bass guitar. Bob Weir, the youngest original member of the group, played rhythm guitar. Ron \"Pigpen\" McKernan played keyboards, percussion, and harmonica until shortly before his death in 1973 at the age of 27. Garcia, Weir, and McKernan shared the lead vocal duties more or less equally; Lesh sang only a few leads, but his tenor was a key part of the band's three-part vocal harmonies. Bill Kreutzmann played drums, and in September 1967 was joined by a second drummer, New York City native Mickey Hart, who also played a wide variety of other percussion instruments.\nOn May 3, 1968, the band played a free concert at Columbia University during the anti\u2013Vietnam War student protests during which students occupied several campus buildings. In order to play, the band, equipment and all, had to be \"smuggled\" on campus in the back of a bread delivery truck. \"We were already jamming away before the security and police could stop us\", said Hart.\nTom \"TC\" Constanten was added as a second keyboardist from 1968 to 1970, to help Pigpen keep up with an increasingly psychedelic sound, while Pigpen transitioned into playing various percussion instruments and vocals. 1970 included tour dates in New Orleans, where the band performed at The Warehouse for two nights. On January 31, 1970, the local police raided their hotel on Bourbon Street and arrested and charged 19 people with possession of various drugs. The second night's concert was performed as scheduled after bail was posted. Eventually, the charges were dismissed, except those against sound engineer Owsley Stanley, who was already facing charges in California for manufacturing LSD. This event was later memorialized in the lyrics of \u201cTruckin'\", a single from \"American Beauty\" that reached number 64 on the charts.\nHart took time off from the band in February 1971, after his father, an accountant, absconded with much of the band's money; Kreutzmann was once again the sole percussionist, until Hart rejoined the Grateful Dead for good in October 1974. After Constanten's departure, Pigpen reclaimed his position as sole keyboardist. Less than a year later, in late 1971, Pigpen was joined by another keyboardist, Keith Godchaux, who played grand piano alongside Pigpen's Hammond B-3 organ. In early 1972, Keith's wife, Donna Jean Godchaux, joined the Grateful Dead as a backing vocalist.\nFollowing the Grateful Dead's \"Europe '72\" tour, Pigpen's health had deteriorated to the point that he could no longer tour with the band. His final concert appearance was June 17, 1972, at the Hollywood Bowl, in Los Angeles; he died on March 8, 1973, of complications from liver damage.\nGodchaux era (1972\u20131979).\nPigpen's death did not slow down the Grateful Dead. With the help of manager Ron Rakow, the band soon formed its own record label, Grateful Dead Records. Later that year, it released its next studio album, the jazz-influenced \"Wake of the Flood,\" which became their biggest commercial success thus far. Meanwhile, capitalizing on the album's success, the band soon went back to the studio, and in June 1974 released another album, \"From the Mars Hotel\". Not long after, the Dead decided to take a hiatus from live touring. The band travelled to Europe for a string of shows in September 1974, before performing a series of five concerts at the Winterland Ballroom in San Francisco in October 1974, and delved into various other projects. The Winterland concerts were filmed, and Garcia compiled the footage into \"The Grateful Dead Movie\", a feature-length concert film released in 1977.\nIn September 1975, the Dead released their eighth studio album, \"Blues for Allah\". The band resumed touring in June 1976, playing multiple dates in small theaters, rather than the stadium shows that had become common, and had exhausted them, in 1974. That same year, they signed with Arista Records, and the new contract produced \"Terrapin Station\" in July 1977. The band's tour in the spring of that year is held in high regard by its fans, and its concert of May 8 at Cornell University is often considered one of the best performances of its career. Their September 1977 concert at Raceway Park in Old Bridge Township, New Jersey was attended by 107,019 people and held the record for largest-ticketed concert in the United States by a single act for 47 years.\nKeith and Donna Jean Godchaux left the band in February 1979, citing artistic differences.\nMydland/Welnick era (1979\u20131995).\nFollowing the Godchauxs' departure, Brent Mydland joined as keyboardist and vocalist and was considered \"the perfect fit\". The Godchauxs then formed the Heart of Gold Band, before Keith died in a car accident in July 1980. Mydland was the keyboardist for the Grateful Dead for 11 years until his death by narcotics overdose in July 1990, becoming the third keyboardist to die.\nShortly after Mydland found his place in the early 1980s, Garcia's health began to decline. He became a frequent smoker of \"Persian\", a type of heroin, and he gained weight at a rapid pace. He lost his liveliness on stage, his voice was strained, and Deadheads worried for his health. After he began to curtail his opiate usage gradually in 1985, Garcia slipped into a diabetic coma for several days in July 1986, leading to the cancelation of all concerts in the fall of that year. Garcia recovered, and the band released \"In the Dark\" in July 1987, which became its best-selling studio album and produced its only top-40 single, \"Touch of Grey\". Also, that year, the group toured with Bob Dylan, as heard on the album \"Dylan &amp; the Dead\".\nMydland died in July 1990 and Vince Welnick, former keyboardist for the Tubes, joined as a band member, while Bruce Hornsby, who had a successful career with his band the Range, joined temporarily as a bridge to help Welnick learn songs. Both performed on keyboards and vocals\u2014Welnick until the band's end, and Hornsby mainly from 1990 to 1992.\nSaxophonist Branford Marsalis played five concerts with the band between 1990 and 1994. \nThe Grateful Dead performed its final concert on July 9, 1995, at Soldier Field in Chicago.\nAftermath (1995\u2013present).\nJerry Garcia died on August 9, 1995. A few months after Garcia's death, the remaining members of the Grateful Dead decided to disband. Since that time, there have been a number of reunions by the surviving members involving various combinations of musicians. Additionally, the former members have also begun or continued individual projects.\nIn 1998, Bob Weir, Phil Lesh, and Mickey Hart, along with several other musicians, formed a band called the Other Ones, and performed a number of concerts that year, releasing a live album, \"The Strange Remain\", the following year. In 2000, the Other Ones toured again, this time with Kreutzmann but without Lesh. After taking another year off, the band toured again in 2002 with Lesh. That year, the Other Ones then included all four living former Grateful Dead members who had been in the band for most or all of its history. At different times the shifting lineup of the Other Ones also included guitarists Mark Karan, Steve Kimock, and Jimmy Herring, keyboardists Bruce Hornsby, Jeff Chimenti, and Rob Barraco, saxophonist Dave Ellis, drummer John Molo, bassist Alphonso Johnson, and vocalist Susan Tedeschi.\nIn 2003, the Other Ones, still including Weir, Lesh, Hart, and Kreutzmann, changed their name to the Dead. The Dead toured the United States in 2003, 2004 and 2009. The band's lineups included Jimmy Herring and Warren Haynes on guitar, Jeff Chimenti and Rob Barraco on keyboards, and Joan Osborne on vocals. In 2008, members of the Dead played two concerts, called \"Deadheads for Obama\" and \"Change Rocks\".\nFollowing the 2009 Dead tour, Lesh and Weir formed the band Furthur, which debuted in September 2009. Joining Lesh and Weir in Furthur were Chimenti (keyboards), John Kadlecik (guitar), Joe Russo (drums), Jay Lane (drums), Sunshine Becker (vocals), and Zoe Ellis (vocals). Lane and Ellis left the band in 2010, and vocalist Jeff Pehrson joined later that year. Furthur disbanded in 2014.\nIn 2010, Hart and Kreutzmann re-formed the Rhythm Devils, and played a summer concert tour. In the fall of 2015, Hart, Kreutzmann and Weir teamed up with Chimenti, guitarist John Mayer, and bassist Oteil Burbridge to form a band called Dead &amp; Company. Mayer recounted that in 2011 he was listening to Pandora and happened upon the Grateful Dead song \"Althea\", and that soon Grateful Dead music was all he would listen to. Dead &amp; Company toured every year (except 2020), until announcing that their summer 2023 tour, which saw Kreutzmann replaced by Lane, would be their last. However, they later clarified that it was only their last \"tour\", and they continue to perform concerts.\nSince 1995, the former members of the Grateful Dead have also pursued solo music careers. Both Bob Weir &amp; RatDog and Phil Lesh and Friends have performed many concerts and released several albums. Mickey Hart and Bill Kreutzmann have also each released a few albums. Hart has toured with his world music percussion ensemble Planet Drum as well as the Mickey Hart Band. Kreutzmann has led several different bands, including BK3, 7 Walkers (with Papa Mali), and Billy &amp; the Kids. Donna Godchaux has returned to the music scene, with the Donna Jean Godchaux Band, and Tom Constanten also continues to write and perform music. All of these groups continue to play Grateful Dead music.\nIn May 2017, a four hour documentary film \"Long Strange Trip\" about the band was released theatrically and on Amazon Prime. Directed by Amir Bar-Lev and produced by Martin Scorsese and Justin Kreutzmann, while David Lemieux supervised the musical selection. Importantly, Weir, Hart, Kreutzmann, and Lesh agreed to new interviews for the film.\nBarlow died in 2018 and Hunter in 2019. Lesh died in 2024. Donna Jean Godchaux died in 2025.\n\"Fare Thee Well\".\nIn 2015, Weir, Lesh, Kreutzmann, and Hart reunited for five concerts called \"Fare Thee Well: Celebrating 50 Years of the Grateful Dead\". The shows were performed on June 27 and 28 at Levi's Stadium in Santa Clara, California, and on July 3, 4 and 5 at Soldier Field in Chicago. The band stated that this would be the final time that Weir, Lesh, Hart, and Kreutzmann would perform together. They were joined by Trey Anastasio of Phish on guitar, Jeff Chimenti on keyboards, and Bruce Hornsby on piano. Demand for tickets was very high. The concerts were simulcast via various media. The Chicago shows have been released as a box set of CDs and DVDs.\nMusical style.\nThe Grateful Dead formed during the era when bands such as the Beatles, the Beach Boys and the Rolling Stones were dominating the airwaves. \"The Beatles were why we turned from a jug band into a rock 'n' roll band\", said Bob Weir. \"What we saw them doing was impossibly attractive. I couldn't think of anything else more worth doing.\" Former folk-scene star Bob Dylan had recently put out a couple of records featuring electric instrumentation. Grateful Dead members have said that it was after attending a concert by the touring New York City band the Lovin' Spoonful that they decided to \"go electric\" and look for a \"dirtier\" sound. Jerry Garcia and Bob Weir (both of whom had been immersed in the American folk music revival of the late 1950s and early 1960s), were open-minded about the use of electric guitars.\nThe Grateful Dead's early music (in the mid-1960s) was part of the process of establishing what \"psychedelic music\" was, but theirs was essentially a \"street party\" form of it. They developed their \"psychedelic\" playing as a result of meeting Ken Kesey in Palo Alto, California, and subsequently becoming the house band for the Acid Tests he staged. They did not fit their music to an established category such as pop rock, blues, folk rock, or country &amp; western. Individual tunes within their repertoire could be identified under one of these stylistic labels, but overall their music drew on all of these genres and, more frequently, melded several of them. Bill Graham said of the Grateful Dead, \"They're not the best at what they do, they're the only ones that do what they do.\" Academics Paul Hegarty and Martin Halliwell argued that the Grateful Dead were \"not merely as precursors of prog but as essential developments of progressiveness in its early days\". Often (both in performance and on recording) the Dead left room for exploratory, spacey soundscapes.\nTheir live shows, fed by an improvisational approach to music, were different from most touring bands. While rock and roll bands often rehearse a standard set, played with minor variations, the Grateful Dead did not prepare in this way. Garcia stated in a 1966 interview, \"We don't make up our sets beforehand. We'd rather work off the tops of our heads than off a piece of paper.\" They maintained this approach throughout their career. For each performance, the band drew material from an active list of a hundred or so songs.\nThe 1969 live album \"Live/Dead\" did capture the band in-form, but commercial success did not come until \"Workingman's Dead\" and \"American Beauty\", both released in 1970. These records largely featured the band's laid-back acoustic musicianship and more traditional song structures. With their rootsy, eclectic stylings, particularly evident on the latter two albums, the band pioneered the hybrid Americana genre.\nInstrumentation and musicianship.\nAs the band and its sound matured over thirty years of touring, playing, and recording, each member's stylistic contribution became more defined, consistent, and identifiable. Garcia's lead lines were fluid, supple and spare, owing a great deal of their character to his experience playing Scruggs style banjo, an approach which often makes use of note syncopation, accenting, arpeggios, staccato chromatic runs, and the anticipation of the downbeat. \nGarcia had a distinctive sense of timing, often weaving in and out of the groove established by the rest of the band as if he were pushing the beat. His lead lines were also immensely influenced by jazz soloists: Garcia cited Miles Davis, Ornette Coleman, Bill Evans, Pat Martino, George Benson, Al Di Meola, Art Tatum, Duke Ellington, and Django Reinhardt as primary influences, and frequently utilized techniques common to country and blues music in songs that called back to those traditions. \nGarcia often switched scales in the midst of a solo depending upon the chord changes played underneath, though he nearly always finished phrases by landing on the chord-tones. Jerry most frequently played in the Mixolydian mode, though his solos and phrases often incorporated notes from the Dorian and major/minor pentatonic scales. Particularly in the late 1960s, Garcia occasionally incorporated melodic lines derived from Indian ragas into the band's extended, psychedelic improvisation, likely inspired by John Coltrane and other jazz artists' interest in the sitar music of Ravi Shankar.\nLesh was originally a classically trained trumpet player with an extensive background in music theory, but did not tend to play traditional blues-based bass forms. He often played more melodic, symphonic and complex lines, often sounding like a second lead guitar. In contrast to most bassists in popular music, Lesh often avoids playing the root of a chord on the downbeat, instead withholding as a means to build tension. Lesh also rarely repeats the same bassline, even from performance to performance of the same song, and often plays off of or around the other instruments with a syncopated, staccato bounce that contributes to the Dead's unique rhythmic character.\nWeir, too, was not a traditional rhythm guitarist, but tended to play unique inversions at the upper end of the Dead's sound. Weir modeled his style of playing after jazz pianist McCoy Tyner and attempted to replicate the interplay between John Coltrane and Tyner in his support, and occasional subversion, of the harmonic structure of Garcia's voice leadings. This would often influence the direction the band's improvisation would take on a given night. Weir and Garcia's respective positions as rhythm and lead guitarist were not always strictly adhered to, as Weir would often incorporate short melodic phrases into his playing to support Garcia and occasionally took solos, often played with a slide. Weir's playing is characterized by a \"spiky, staccato\" sound.\nThe band's two drummers, Mickey Hart and Bill Kreutzmann, developed a unique, complex interplay, balancing Kreutzmann's steady shuffle beat with Hart's interest in percussion styles outside the rock tradition. Kreuzmann has said, \"I like to establish a feeling and then add radical or oblique juxtapositions to that feeling.\" Hart incorporated an 11-count measure to his drumming, bringing a dimension to the band's sound that became an important part of its style. He had studied tabla drumming and incorporated rhythms and instruments from world music, and later electronic music, into the band's live performances.\nThe Dead's live performances featured multiple types of improvisation derived from a vast array of musical traditions. Not unlike many rock bands of their time, the majority of the Dead's songs feature a designated section in which an instrumental break occurs over the chord changes. These sections typically feature solos by Garcia that often originate as variations on the song's melody, but go on to create dynamic phrases that resolve by returning to the chord-tones. Not unlike traditional improvisational jazz, they may occasionally feature several solos by multiple instruments within an undecided number of bars, such as a keyboardist, before returning to the melody. At the same time, Dead shows almost always feature a more collective, modal approach to improvisation that typically occurs during segues between songs before the band modulates to a new tonal center. Some of the Dead's more extended jam vehicles, such as \"The Other One\", \"Dark Star\", and \"Playing in the Band\" almost exclusively make use of modulation between modes to accompany simple two-chord progressions.\nLyrical themes.\nFollowing the songwriting renaissance that defined the band's early 1970s period, as reflected in the albums \"Workingman's Dead\" and \"American Beauty,\" Robert Hunter, Jerry Garcia's primary lyrical partner, frequently made use of motifs common to American folklore including trains, guns, elements, traditional musical instruments, gambling, murder, animals, alcohol, descriptions of American geography, and religious symbolism to illustrate themes involving love and loss, life and death, beauty and horror, and chaos and order. Following in the footsteps of several American musical traditions, these songs are often confessional and feature narration from the perspective of an antihero. Critic Robert Christgau described them as \"American myths\" that later gave way to \"the old karma-go-round\". \nAn extremely common feature in both Robert Hunter's lyrics, as well as the band's visual iconography, is the presence of dualistic and opposing imagery illustrating the dynamic range of the human experience (Heaven and hell, law and crime, dark and light, etc.). Hunter and Garcia's earlier, more directly psychedelic-influenced compositions often make use of surreal imagery, nonsense, and whimsey reflective of traditions in English poetry. In a retrospective, \"The New Yorker\" described Hunter's verses as \"elliptical, by turns vivid and gnomic\", which were often \"hippie poetry about roses and bells and dew\". Grateful Dead biographer Dennis McNally has described Hunter's lyrics as creating \"a non-literal hyper-Americana\" weaving a psychedelic, kaleidoscopic tapestry in the hopes of elucidating America's national character. At least one of Hunter and Bob Weir's collaborations, \"Jack Straw\", was inspired by the work of John Steinbeck.\nInfluence and legacy.\nGrateful Dead have been called a \"symbol of the counterculture movement of the sixties\". Beginning in the early 1990s, a new generation of bands became inspired by the Grateful Dead's improvisational ethos and marketing strategy, and began to incorporate elements of the Grateful Dead's live performances into their own shows. These include the nightly alteration of setlists, frequent improvisation, the blending of genres, and the allowance of taping, which would often contribute to the development of a dedicated fanbase. Bands associated with the expansion of the \"jam scene\" include Phish, the String Cheese Incident, Widespread Panic, Blues Traveler, Moe, and the Disco Biscuits. Many of these groups began to look past the American roots music that the Grateful Dead drew inspiration from, and incorporated elements of progressive rock, hard rock, and electronica. At the same time, the Internet gained popularity and provided a medium for fans to discuss these bands and their performances and download MP3s. The Grateful Dead, as well as Phish, were one of the first bands to have a Usenet newsgroup.\nMerchandising and representation.\nHal Kant was an entertainment industry attorney who specialized in representing musical groups. He spent 35 years as principal lawyer and general counsel for the Grateful Dead, a position in the group that was so strong that his business cards with the band identified his role as \"Czar\".\nKant brought the band millions of dollars in revenue through his management of the band's intellectual property and merchandising rights. At Kant's recommendation, the group was one of the few rock 'n roll pioneers to retain ownership of their music masters and publishing rights.\nIn 2006, the Grateful Dead signed a ten-year licensing agreement with Rhino Entertainment to manage the band's business interests including the release of musical recordings, merchandising, and marketing. The band retained creative control and kept ownership of its music catalog.\nA Grateful Dead video game titled \"Grateful Dead Game\u00a0\u2013 The Epic Tour\" was released in April 2012 and was created by Curious Sense.\nIn November 2022, the children's book \"The ABCs of The Grateful Dead\" was released. Authorized by the group, it was written by Howie Abrams, illustrated by Michael \"Kaves\" McLeer, and published by Simon &amp; Schuster.\nSponsorship of 1992 Lithuanian Olympic basketball team.\nAfter Lithuania gained its independence from the USSR, the country announced its withdrawal from the 1992 Olympics due to the lack of any money to sponsor participants. But NBA star \u0160ar\u016bnas Mar\u010diulionis, a native Lithuanian basketball star, wanted to help his native team to compete. His efforts resulted in a call from representatives of the Grateful Dead who set up a meeting with the band members. The band agreed to fund transportation costs for the team (about $5,000) along with Grateful Dead designs for the team's jerseys and shorts. The Lithuanian basketball team won the bronze medal and the Lithuanian basketball/Grateful Dead T-shirts became part of pop culture, especially in Lithuania. The incident was covered by the documentary \"The Other Dream Team\".\nLive performances.\nThe Grateful Dead toured constantly throughout their career, playing more than 2,300 concerts. They promoted a sense of community among their fans, who became known as \"Deadheads\", many of whom followed their tours for months or years on end. Around concert venues, an impromptu communal marketplace known as \"Shakedown Street\" was created by Deadheads to serve as centers of activity where fans could buy and sell anything from grilled cheese sandwiches to homemade T-shirts and recordings of Grateful Dead concerts.\nIn their early career, the band also dedicated their time and talents to their community, the Haight-Ashbury area of San Francisco, making available free food, lodging, music, and health care to all. It has been said that the band performed \"more free concerts than any band in the history of music\".\nWith the exception of 1975, when the band was on hiatus and played only four concerts, Grateful Dead performed many concerts every year, from their formation in April 1965, until July 9, 1995. Initially all their shows were in California, principally in the San Francisco Bay Area and in or near Los Angeles. They also performed, in 1965 and 1966, with Ken Kesey and the Merry Pranksters, as the house band for the Acid Tests. \nIn 1967, they toured nationally, including their first performance in New York City. They appeared at the Monterey Pop Festival in 1967, the Woodstock Festival in 1969 and the Festival Express train tour across Canada in 1970. They were scheduled to appear as the final act at the infamous Altamont Free Concert on December 6, 1969, after the Rolling Stones but withdrew after security concerns. \"That's the way things went at Altamont\u2014so badly that the Grateful Dead, prime organizers and movers of the festival, didn't even get to play\", staff at \"Rolling Stone\" magazine wrote in a detailed narrative on the event.\nTheir first UK performance was at the Hollywood Music Festival in 1970. Their largest concert audience came in 1973 when they played, along with the Allman Brothers Band and the Band, before an estimated 600,000 people at the Summer Jam at Watkins Glen. They played to an estimated total of 25\u00a0million people, more than any other band, with audiences of up to 80,000 attending a single show. Many of these concerts were preserved in the band's tape vault, and several dozen have since been released on CD and as downloads. The Dead were known for the tremendous variation in their setlists from night to night\u2014the list of songs documented to have been played by the band exceeds 500. The band has released four concert videos under the name \"View from the Vault\". In 1978, they played three nights at the Great Pyramid of Giza in Egypt. \nIn the 1990s, the Grateful Dead earned a total of $285\u00a0million in revenue from their concert tours, the second-highest during the 1990s, with the Rolling Stones earning the most. This figure is representative of tour revenue through 1995, as touring stopped after the death of Jerry Garcia. \nIn a 1991 PBS documentary, segment host Buck Henry attended an August 1991 concert at Shoreline Amphitheatre and gleaned some information from some band members about the Grateful Dead phenomenon and its success. At the time, Jerry Garcia stated, \"We didn't really invent the Grateful Dead, the crowd invented the Grateful Dead, you know what I mean? We were sort of standing in line, and uh, it's gone way past our expectations, way past, so it's, we've been going along with it to see what it's gonna do next.\" Mickey Hart said, \"This is one of the last places in America that you can really have this kind of fun, you know, considering the political climate and so forth.\" Hart also stated that \"the transformative power of the Grateful Dead is really the essence of it; it's what it can do to your consciousness. We're more into \"transportation\" than we are into music, \"per se\", I mean, the business of the Grateful Dead is transportation.\" One of the band's largest concerts took place just months before Garcia's death, at their outdoor show with Bob Dylan in Highgate, Vermont, on June 15, 1995. The crowd was estimated to be over 90,000; overnight camping was allowed and about a third of the audience got in without having purchased a ticket.\nTheir numerous studio albums were generally collections of new songs that they had first played in concert. The band was also famous for its extended musical improvisations, having been described as having never played the same song the same way twice. Their concert sets often blended songs, one into the next, often for more than three songs at a time.\nConcert sound systems.\nThe Wall of Sound was a large sound system designed specifically for the band. The band was never satisfied with the house system anywhere they played. After the Monterey Pop Festival, the band's crew 'borrowed' some of the other performers' sound equipment and used it to host some free shows in San Francisco. In their early days, soundman Owsley \"Bear\" Stanley designed a public address (PA) and monitor system for them. Stanley was the Grateful Dead's soundman for many years; he was also one of the largest suppliers of LSD. \nStanley's sound systems were delicate and finicky, and frequently brought shows to a halt with technical breakdowns. After Stanley went to jail for manufacturing LSD in 1970, the group briefly used house PAs, but found them to be even less reliable than those built by their former soundman. On February 2, 1970, the group contacted Bob Heil to use his system. In 1971, the band purchased their first solid-state sound system from Alembic Studios. Because of this, Alembic would play an integral role in the research, development, and production of the Wall of Sound. The band also welcomed Dan Healy into the fold on a permanent basis that year. Healy would mix the Grateful Dead's live sound until 1993.\nFollowing Jerry Garcia's death and the band's breakup in 1995, their current sound system was inherited by Dave Matthews Band. Dave Matthews Band debuted the sound system April 30, 1996, at the first show of their 1996 tour in Richmond, Virginia.\nTapes.\nLike several other bands at the time, the Grateful Dead allowed their fans to record their shows. For many years the tapers set up their microphones wherever they could, and the eventual forest of microphones became a problem for the sound crew. Eventually, this was solved by having a dedicated taping section located behind the soundboard, which required a special \"tapers\" ticket. The band allowed sharing of their shows, as long as no profits were made on the sale of the tapes.\nOf the approximately 2,350 shows the Grateful Dead played, almost 2,200 were taped, and most of these are available online. The band began collecting and cataloging tapes early on and Dick Latvala was their keeper. \"Dick's Picks\" is named after Latvala. After his death in 1999, David Lemieux gradually took the post. Concert set lists from a subset of 1,590 Grateful Dead shows were used to perform a comparative analysis between how songs were played in concert and how they are listened online by Last.fm members. In their book \"Marketing Lessons from the Grateful Dead: What Every Business Can Learn From the Most Iconic Band in History\", David Meerman Scott and Brian Halligan identify the taper section as a crucial contributor to increasing the Grateful Dead's fan base.\nIconography.\nOver the years, a number of iconic images have come to be associated with the Grateful Dead. Many of these images originated as artwork for concert posters or album covers.\nThe skull and roses design was composed by Alton Kelley and Stanley Mouse, who added lettering and color, respectively, to a black and white drawing by Edmund Joseph Sullivan. Sullivan's drawing was an illustration for a 1913 edition of the \"Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam\". Earlier antecedents include the custom of exhibiting the relic skulls of Christian martyrs decorated with roses on their feast days. The rose is an attribute of Saint Valentine, who according to one legend, was martyred by decapitation. Accordingly, in Rome, at the church dedicated to him, the observance of his feast day included the display of his skull surrounded by roses. Kelley and Mouse's design originally appeared on a poster for the September 16 and 17, 1966, Dead shows at the Avalon Ballroom. Later, it was used as the cover for the album \"Grateful Dead\" (1971). The album is sometimes referred to as \"Skull and Roses\".\nAnother icon of the Dead is a skeleton dressed as a jester and holding a lute. This image was an airbrush painting, created by Stanley Mouse in 1972. It was originally used for the cover of \"The Grateful Dead Songbook\".\nA series of stylized bears who appear to be dancing was drawn by Bob Thomas as part of the back cover for the album \"History of the Grateful Dead, Volume One (Bear's Choice)\" (1973). Thomas reported that he based the bears on a lead sort from an unknown font. The bear is a reference to Owsley \"Bear\" Stanley, who recorded and produced the album. Bear himself wrote, \"the bears on the album cover are not really 'dancing'. I don't know why people think they are; their positions are quite obviously those of a high-stepping march.\"\nPerhaps the best-known Grateful Dead art icon is a red, white, and blue skull with a lightning bolt through it. The lightning bolt skull can be found on the cover of the album \"Steal Your Face\" (1976), and the image is sometimes known by that name. It was designed by Owsley Stanley and artist Bob Thomas, and was originally used as a logo to mark the band's equipment.\nThe two dancing terrapins first appeared on the cover of the album \"Terrapin Station\" (1977). They were drawn by Kelley and Mouse, based on a drawing by Heinrich Kley. Since then these turtles have become one of the Grateful Dead's most recognizable logos.\nThe Uncle Sam skeleton was devised by Gary Gutierrez as part of the animation for \"The Grateful Dead Movie\" (1977). The image combines the Grateful Dead skeleton motif with the character of Uncle Sam, a reference to the then-recently written song \"U.S. Blues\", which plays during the animation.\nDeadheads.\nFans and enthusiasts of the band are commonly referred to as Deadheads. While the origin of the term may be unclear, \"Dead Heads\" were made canon by the notice placed inside the \"Skull and Roses\" (1971) album by manager Jon McIntire:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;DEAD FREAKS UNITE: Who are you? Where are you? How are you?Send us your name and address and we'll keep you informed.Dead Heads, P.O. Box 1065, San Rafael, California 94901.\nAs each show featured a new setlist and a great deal of improvisation, Deadheads would often follow the band from city to city, attending many shows on a given tour. Many Deadheads speak of being drawn to the culture due to the sense of community that the band's shows tended to foster. Though Deadheads came from a wide array of demographics, many attempted to reproduce the aesthetics and values of the 1960s counterculture and were often stigmatized in the media. Because of the stereotyping of Deadheads as hippies, the band's shows became a common target for officials in the DEA and arrests at shows became common. \nAs a group, the Deadheads were considered very mellow. \"I'd rather work nine Grateful Dead concerts than one Oregon football game\", Police Det. Rick Raynor said. \"They don't get belligerent like they do at the games.\" Despite this reputation, in the mid-1990s, as the band's popularity grew, there were a series of minor scuffles occurring at shows that peaked with a large scale riot at the Deer Creek Music Center near Indianapolis in July 1995. This gate crashing incident caused the band to cancel the following night's show. Deadheads who appeared on the scene after the band's 1987 hit single \"Touch of Grey\", were often disparagingly referred to by older fans as \"Touchheads\". Beginning in the 1980s, a number of definable sects of Deadheads began to appear on the scene. These included the Wharf Rats, as well as the \"spinners\", named for whirling-style of dancing and their use of the band's music to facilitate mystical experiences.\nDeadheads, particularly those who collected tapes, were known for keeping close records of the band's setlists and for comparing various live versions of the band's songs, as reflected in publications such as the various editions of \"Deadbase\" and \"The Deadhead's Taping Compendium\". This practice continues into the 21st century on digital forums and websites such as the Internet Archive, which features live recordings of nearly every available Grateful Dead show and allows users to discuss and review the site's shows.\nThe band has a number of influential and celebrity fans, including politicians, businesspeople, journalists, and other musicians.\nDonation of archives to UC Santa Cruz.\nOn April 24, 2008, members Bob Weir and Mickey Hart, along with Nion McEvoy, CEO of Chronicle Books, UC Santa Cruz chancellor George R. Blumenthal, and UC Santa Cruz librarian Virginia Steel, held a press conference announcing UCSC's McHenry Library would be the permanent home of the Grateful Dead Archive, which includes a complete archival history from 1965 to the present. The archive includes correspondence, photographs, fliers, posters, and several other forms of memorabilia and records of the band. Also included are unreleased videos of interviews and TV appearances that will be installed for visitors to view, as well as stage backdrops and other props from the band's concerts.\nBlumenthal stated at the event, \"The Grateful Dead Archive represents one of the most significant popular cultural collections of the 20th century; UC Santa Cruz is honored to receive this invaluable gift. The Grateful Dead and UC Santa Cruz are both highly innovative institutions\u2014born the same year\u2014that continue to make a major, positive impact on the world.\" Guitarist Bob Weir stated \"We looked around, and UC Santa Cruz seems the best possible home. If you ever wrote the Grateful Dead a letter, you'll probably find it there!\"\nProfessor of music Fredric Lieberman was the key contact between the band and the university, who let the university know about the search for a home for the archive, and who had collaborated with Mickey Hart on three books in the past, \"Planet Drum\" (1990), \"Drumming at the Edge of Magic\" (1991), and \"Spirit into Sound\" (2006).\nThe first large-scale exhibition of materials from the Grateful Dead Archive was mounted at the New-York Historical Society in 2010.\nAwards.\nIn 2004, \"Rolling Stone\" ranked the Grateful Dead No.\u00a057 on their list of the 100 Greatest Artists of All Time.\nOn February 10, 2007, the Grateful Dead received a Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award. The award was accepted on behalf of the band by Mickey Hart and Bill Kreutzmann.\nIn 2011, a recording of the Grateful Dead's May 8, 1977, concert at Cornell University's Barton Hall was selected for induction into the National Recording Registry of the Library of Congress.\nTwelve members of the Grateful Dead (the eleven official performing members plus Robert Hunter) were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1994, and Bruce Hornsby was their presenter.\nIn 2024 the band was named as one of the recipients of the Kennedy Center Honors. The three living core members (Weir, Hart and Kreutzmann) received the award. As he was named a recipient prior to his death, Lesh received the award posthumously.\nMembers.\nFrequent collaborators.\nLead guitarist Jerry Garcia was often viewed both by the public and the media as the leader or primary spokesperson for the Grateful Dead, but was reluctant to be perceived that way, especially since he and the other group members saw themselves as equal participants and contributors to their collective musical and creative output. Garcia, a native of San Francisco, grew up in the Excelsior District. One of his main influences was bluegrass music, and he also performed\u2014on banjo, one of his other great instrumental loves, along with the pedal steel guitar\u2014in bluegrass bands, notably Old &amp; In the Way with mandolinist David Grisman.\nNed Lagin, a young MIT student and friend of the band, guested with them many times from 1970 through 1975, providing a second keyboard as well as synthesizers. Upon graduating from MIT, he began touring with the band fulltime in 1974, performing sets of electronic music with Phil Lesh, occasionally with Garcia and Kreutzmann, during the band's intermission. The \"Ned and Phil\" set became a regular fixture of that era, and was featured nearly every night during their Summer '74 and Europe '74 tours, as well as their five-night residency at the Winterland Ballroom during October 1974. Lagin is also featured in \"The Grateful Dead Movie\". During 1974 and 1975, he would also occasionally play entire sets with the band, usually on Garcia's side of the stage, before ending his touring relationship with the band and focusing on his solo music projects, such as his album \"Seastones\", which features several members of the Dead.\nBruce Hornsby never officially joined the band full-time because of his other commitments, but he did play keyboards at most Dead shows between September 1990 and March 1992, and sat in with the band over 100 times in all between 1988 and 1995. He added several Dead songs to his own live shows and Jerry Garcia referred to him as a \"floating member\" who could come and go as he pleased.\nRobert Hunter and John Perry Barlow were the band's primary lyricists, starting in 1967 and 1971, respectively, and continuing until the band's dissolution. Hunter collaborated mostly with Garcia and Barlow mostly with Weir, though each wrote with other band members as well. Both are listed as official members at Dead.net, the band's website, alongside the performing members. Barlow was the only member not inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.\nDiscography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

A groupoid can be seen as a:\nIn the presence of dependent typing, a category in general can be viewed as a typed monoid, and similarly, a groupoid can be viewed as simply a typed group. The morphisms take one from one object to another, and form a dependent family of types, thus morphisms might be typed &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;, &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;, say. Composition is then a total function: &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;, so that &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;.\nSpecial cases include:\nGroupoids are often used to reason about geometrical objects such as manifolds. Heinrich Brandt\u00a0(1927) introduced groupoids implicitly via Brandt semigroups.\nDefinitions.\nAlgebraic.\nA groupoid can be viewed as an algebraic structure consisting of a set with a binary partial function. Precisely, it is a non-empty set formula_1 with a unary operation &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;, and a partial function &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;. Here formula_2 is not a binary operation because it is not necessarily defined for all pairs of elements of &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;. The precise conditions under which formula_2 is defined are not articulated here and vary by situation.\nThe operations formula_4 and \u22121 have the following axiomatic properties: For all &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;, &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;, and formula_5 in &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;,\nTwo easy and convenient properties follow from these axioms:\nCategory-theoretic.\nA groupoid is a small category in which every morphism is an isomorphism, i.e., invertible. More explicitly, a groupoid formula_1 is a set formula_19 of \"objects\" with\nIf the requirement that inverses exist is removed while keeping everything else, this is then the definition of a category. Thus, a groupoid is a category in which every morphism has an inverse.\nIf \"f\" is an element of \"G\"(\"x\",\"y\"), then \"x\" is called the source of \"f\", written \"s\"(\"f\"), and \"y\" is called the target of \"f\", written \"t\"(\"f\").\nA groupoid \"G\" is sometimes denoted as &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;, where formula_26 is the set of all morphisms, and the two arrows formula_27 represent the source and the target.\nMore generally, one can consider a groupoid object in an arbitrary category admitting finite fiber products.\nComparing the definitions.\nThe algebraic and category-theoretic definitions are equivalent, as we now show. Given a groupoid in the category-theoretic sense, let \"G\" be the disjoint union of all of the sets \"G\"(\"x\",\"y\") (i.e. the sets of morphisms from \"x\" to \"y\"). Then formula_28 and formula_29 become partial operations on \"G\", and formula_29 will in fact be defined everywhere. We define \u2217 to be formula_28 and \u22121 to be &amp;NoBreak;}&amp;NoBreak;, which gives a groupoid in the algebraic sense. Explicit reference to \"G\"0 (and hence to &amp;NoBreak;}&amp;NoBreak;) can be dropped.\nConversely, given a groupoid \"G\" in the algebraic sense, define an equivalence relation formula_32 on its elements by\nformula_33 iff \"a\" \u2217 \"a\"\u22121 = \"b\" \u2217 \"b\"\u22121. Let \"G\"0 be the set of equivalence classes of &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;, i.e. &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;. Denote \"a\" \u2217 \"a\"\u22121 by formula_34 if formula_35 with &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;.\nNow define formula_36 as the set of all elements \"f\" such that formula_37 exists. Given formula_38 and &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;, their composite is defined as &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;. To see that this is well defined, observe that since formula_39 and formula_40 exist, so does &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;. The identity morphism on \"x\" is then &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;, and the category-theoretic inverse of \"f\" is \"f\"\u22121.\nSets in the definitions above may be replaced with classes, as is generally the case in category theory.\nVertex groups and orbits.\nGiven a groupoid \"G\", the vertex groups or isotropy groups or object groups in \"G\" are the subsets of the form \"G\"(\"x\",\"x\"), where \"x\" is any object of \"G\". It follows easily from the axioms above that these are indeed groups, as every pair of elements is composable and inverses are in the same vertex group.\nThe orbit of a groupoid \"G\" at a point formula_41 is given by the set formula_42 containing every point that can be joined to x by a morphism in G. If two points formula_43 and formula_44 are in the same orbits, their vertex groups formula_45 and formula_46 are isomorphic: if formula_47 is any morphism from formula_43 to &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;, then the isomorphism is given by the mapping &amp;NoBreak;}&amp;NoBreak;.\nOrbits form a partition of the set X, and a groupoid is called transitive if it has only one orbit (equivalently, if it is connected as a category). In that case, all the vertex groups are isomorphic (on the other hand, this is not a sufficient condition for transitivity; see the section below for counterexamples).\nSubgroupoids and morphisms.\nA subgroupoid of formula_49 is a subcategory formula_50 that is itself a groupoid. It is called wide or full if it is wide or full as a subcategory, i.e., respectively, if formula_51 or formula_52 for every &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;.\nA groupoid morphism is simply a functor between two (category-theoretic) groupoids.\nParticular kinds of morphisms of groupoids are of interest. A morphism formula_53 of groupoids is called a fibration if for each object formula_43 of formula_55 and each morphism formula_56 of formula_57 starting at formula_58 there is a morphism formula_59 of formula_55 starting at formula_43 such that &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;. A fibration is called a covering morphism or covering of groupoids if further such an formula_59 is unique. The covering morphisms of groupoids are especially useful because they can be used to model covering maps of spaces.\nIt is also true that the category of covering morphisms of a given groupoid formula_57 is equivalent to the category of actions of the groupoid formula_57 on sets.\nExamples.\nFundamental groupoid.\nGiven a topological space &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;, let formula_19 be the set &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;. The morphisms from the point formula_66 to the point formula_67 are equivalence classes of continuous paths from formula_66 to &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;, with two paths being equivalent if they are homotopic.\nTwo such morphisms are composed by first following the first path, then the second; the homotopy equivalence guarantees that this composition is associative. This groupoid is called the fundamental groupoid of &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;, denoted formula_69 (or sometimes, &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;). The usual fundamental group formula_70 is then the vertex group for the point &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;.\nThe orbits of the fundamental groupoid formula_69 are the path-connected components of &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;. Accordingly, the fundamental groupoid of a path-connected space is transitive, and we recover the known fact that the fundamental groups at any base point are isomorphic. Moreover, in this case, the fundamental groupoid and the fundamental groups are equivalent as categories (see the section below for the general theory).\nAn important extension of this idea is to consider the fundamental groupoid formula_72 where formula_73 is a chosen set of \"base points\". Here formula_72 is a (full) subgroupoid of &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;, where one considers only paths whose endpoints belong to &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;. The set formula_75 may be chosen according to the geometry of the situation at hand.\nEquivalence relation.\nIf formula_76 is a setoid, i.e. a set with an equivalence relation &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;, then a groupoid \"representing\" this equivalence relation can be formed as follows:\nThe vertex groups of this groupoid are always trivial; moreover, this groupoid is in general not transitive and its orbits are precisely the equivalence classes. There are two extreme examples:\n\u010cech groupoid.\nA \u010cech groupoidp.\u00a05 is a special kind of groupoid associated to an equivalence relation given by an open cover formula_94 of some manifold &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;. Its objects are given by the disjoint union\nformula_95\nand its arrows are the intersections formula_96\nThe source and target maps are then given by the induced mapsformula_97and the inclusion mapformula_98giving the structure of a groupoid. In fact, this can be further extended by settingformula_99as the formula_100-iterated fiber product where the formula_101 represents formula_100-tuples of composable arrows. The structure map of the fiber product is implicitly the target map, sinceformula_103is a cartesian diagram where the maps to formula_104 are the target maps. This construction can be seen as a model for some \u221e-groupoids. Also, another artifact of this construction is k-cocyclesformula_105for some constant sheaf of abelian groups can be represented as a functionformula_106giving an explicit representation of cohomology classes.\nGroup action.\nIf the group formula_1 acts on the set &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;, then we can form the action groupoid (or transformation groupoid) representing this group action as follows:\nMore explicitly, the \"action groupoid\" is a small category with formula_114 and formula_115 and with source and target maps formula_116 and &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;. It is often denoted formula_117 (or formula_118 for a right action). Multiplication (or composition) in the groupoid is then &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;, which is defined provided &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;.\nFor formula_43 in &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;, the vertex group consists of those formula_120 with &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;, which is just the isotropy subgroup at formula_43 for the given action (which is why vertex groups are also called isotropy groups). Similarly, the orbits of the action groupoid are the orbit of the group action, and the groupoid is transitive if and only if the group action is transitive.\nAnother way to describe formula_1-sets is the functor category &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;, where formula_123 is the groupoid (category) with one element and isomorphic to the group &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;. Indeed, every functor formula_124 of this category defines a set formula_125 and for every formula_112 in formula_1 (i.e. for every morphism in &amp;NoBreak;}&amp;NoBreak;) induces a bijection formula_128 : &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;. The categorical structure of the functor formula_124 assures us that formula_124 defines a formula_1-action on the set &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;. The (unique) representable functor formula_132 is the Cayley representation of &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;. In fact, this functor is isomorphic to formula_133 and so sends formula_134 to the set formula_135 which is by definition the \"set\" formula_1 and the morphism formula_112 of formula_123 (i.e. the element formula_112 of &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;) to the permutation formula_128 of the set &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;. We deduce from the Yoneda embedding that the group formula_1 is isomorphic to the group &amp;NoBreak;}&amp;NoBreak;, a subgroup of the group of permutations of &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;.\nFinite set.\nConsider the group action of formula_142 on the finite set formula_143 where 1 acts by taking each number to its negative, so formula_144 and &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;. The quotient groupoid formula_145 is the set of equivalence classes from this group action &amp;NoBreak;}&amp;NoBreak;, and formula_146 has a group action of formula_142 on it.\nQuotient variety.\nAny finite group formula_148 that maps to formula_149 gives a group action on the affine space formula_150 (since this is the group of automorphisms). Then, a quotient groupoid can be of the form &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;, which has one point with stabilizer formula_151 at the origin. Examples like these form the basis for the theory of orbifolds. Another commonly studied family of orbifolds are weighted projective spaces formula_152 and subspaces of them, such as Calabi\u2013Yau orbifolds.\nInertia groupoid.\nThe inertia groupoid of a groupoid is roughly a groupoid of loops in the given groupoid.\nFiber product of groupoids.\nGiven a diagram of groupoids with groupoid morphisms\n formula_153\nwhere formula_154 and &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;, we can form the groupoid formula_155 whose objects are triples &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;, where &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;, &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;, and formula_156 in &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;. Morphisms can be defined as a pair of morphisms formula_157 where formula_158 and \nformula_159 such that for triples &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;, there is a commutative diagram in formula_160 of &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;, formula_161 and the &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;.\nHomological algebra.\nA two term complex\n formula_162\nof objects in a concrete Abelian category can be used to form a groupoid. It has as objects the set formula_163 and as arrows the set &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;; the source morphism is just the projection onto formula_163 while the target morphism is the addition of projection onto formula_165 composed with formula_166 and projection onto &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;. That is, given &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;, we have\n formula_167\nOf course, if the abelian category is the category of coherent sheaves on a scheme, then this construction can be used to form a presheaf of groupoids.\nPuzzles.\nWhile puzzles such as the Rubik's Cube can be modeled using group theory (see Rubik's Cube group), certain puzzles are better modeled as groupoids.\nThe transformations of the fifteen puzzle form a groupoid (not a group, as not all moves can be composed). This groupoid acts on configurations.\nMathieu groupoid.\nThe Mathieu groupoid is a groupoid introduced by John Horton Conway acting on 13 points such that the elements fixing a point form a copy of the Mathieu group M12.\nRelation to groups.\nIf a groupoid has only one object, then the set of its morphisms forms a group. Using the algebraic definition, such a groupoid is literally just a group. Many concepts of group theory generalize to groupoids, with the notion of functor replacing that of group homomorphism.\nEvery transitive/connected groupoid - that is, as explained above, one in which any two objects are connected by at least one morphism - is isomorphic to an action groupoid (as defined above) &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;. By transitivity, there will only be one orbit under the action.\nNote that the isomorphism just mentioned is not unique, and there is no natural choice. Choosing such an isomorphism for a transitive groupoid essentially amounts to picking one object &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;, a group isomorphism formula_168 from formula_169 to &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;, and for each formula_43 other than &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;, a morphism in formula_1 from formula_172 to &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;.\nIf a groupoid is not transitive, then it is isomorphic to a disjoint union of groupoids of the above type, also called its connected components (possibly with different groups formula_1 and sets formula_76 for each connected component).\nIn category-theoretic terms, each connected component of a groupoid is equivalent (but not isomorphic) to a groupoid with a single object, that is, a single group. Thus any groupoid is equivalent to a multiset of unrelated groups. In other words, for equivalence instead of isomorphism, one does not need to specify the sets &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;, but only the groups &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;. For example,\nThe collapse of a groupoid into a mere collection of groups loses some information, even from a category-theoretic point of view, because it is not natural. Thus when groupoids arise in terms of other structures, as in the above examples, it can be helpful to maintain the entire groupoid. Otherwise, one must choose a way to view each formula_45 in terms of a single group, and this choice can be arbitrary. In the example from topology, one would have to make a coherent choice of paths (or equivalence classes of paths) from each point formula_66 to each point formula_67 in the same path-connected component.\nAs a more illuminating example, the classification of groupoids with one endomorphism does not reduce to purely group theoretic considerations. This is analogous to the fact that the classification of vector spaces with one endomorphism is nontrivial.\nMorphisms of groupoids come in more kinds than those of groups: we have, for example, fibrations, covering morphisms, universal morphisms, and quotient morphisms. Thus a subgroup formula_184 of a group formula_1 yields an action of formula_1 on the set of cosets of formula_184 in formula_1 and hence a covering morphism formula_66 from, say, formula_190 to &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;, where formula_190 is a groupoid with vertex groups isomorphic to &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;. In this way, presentations of the group formula_1 can be \"lifted\" to presentations of the groupoid &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;, and this is a useful way of obtaining information about presentations of the subgroup &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;.

Thus if formula_196 are just groups, then such arrows are the conjugacies of morphisms. The main result is that for any groupoids formula_197 there is a natural bijection\n formula_198\nThis result is of interest even if all the groupoids formula_197 are just groups.\nAnother important property of Grpd is that it is both complete and cocomplete.\nRelation to Cat.\nThe inclusion formula_200 has both a left and a right adjoint:\n formula_201\n formula_202\nHere, formula_203 denotes the localization of a category that inverts every morphism, and formula_204 denotes the subcategory of all isomorphisms.\nRelation to sSet.\nThe nerve functor formula_205 embeds Grpd as a full subcategory of the category of simplicial sets. The nerve of a groupoid is always a Kan complex.\nThe nerve has a left adjoint\n formula_206\nHere, formula_69 denotes the fundamental groupoid of the simplicial set &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;.\nGroupoids in Grpd.\nThere is an additional structure which can be derived from groupoids internal to the category of groupoids, double-groupoids. Because Grpd is a 2-category, these objects form a 2-category instead of a 1-category since there is extra structure. Essentially, these are groupoids formula_208 with functorsformula_209and an embedding given by an identity functorformula_210One way to think about these 2-groupoids is they contain objects, morphisms, and squares which can compose together vertically and horizontally. For example, given squaresformula_211 and formula_212with formula_213 the same morphism, they can be vertically conjoined giving a diagramformula_214which can be converted into another square by composing the vertical arrows. There is a similar composition law for horizontal attachments of squares.\nGroupoids with geometric structures.\nWhen studying geometrical objects, the arising groupoids often carry a topology, turning them into topological groupoids, or even some differentiable structure, turning them into Lie groupoids. These last objects can be also studied in terms of their associated Lie algebroids, in analogy to the relation between Lie groups and Lie algebras.\nGroupoids arising from geometry often possess further structures which interact with the groupoid multiplication. For instance, in Poisson geometry one has the notion of a symplectic groupoid, which is a Lie groupoid endowed with a compatible symplectic form. Similarly, one can have groupoids with a compatible Riemannian metric, or complex structure, etc.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It is mentioned in dance manuals from England, Portugal, France, Spain, Germany, and Italy.\nDance form.\nThe \"galliard\" is not an improvised dance, but rather, it consists of choreographed patterns of steps, which occupy one or more measures of music. In one measure, a galliard typically has five steps; in French such a basic step is called a \"cinq pas\" and in Italy, \"cinque passi\". This is sometimes written in English sources as \"sinkapace\". These steps are: right, left, right, left, cadence.\nThe galliard is an athletic dance, characterised by leaps, jumps, hops and other similar figures. The main feature that defines a galliard step is a large jump, after which the dancer lands with one leg ahead of the other. This jump is called a \"cadence,\" and the final landing is called the \"posture.\" The cadence is typically preceded by three quick hops with alternating feet. The sources generally describe movement patterns starting on the left foot, then repeating it starting with the right foot. A galliard pattern may also last twice as long, or more, which would involve 11 steps, or 17 steps.\nThe galliard was a favourite dance of Queen Elizabeth I of England, and although it is a relatively vigorous dance, in 1589 when the Queen was aged in her mid-fifties, John Stanhope of the Privy Chamber reported, \"the Queen is so well as I assure you, six or seven galliards in a morning, besides music and singing, is her ordinary exercise.\"\nWhile most commonly being an entire dance, the galliard's steps are used within many other forms of dance. For example, 16th-century Italian dances in Fabritio Caroso's (1581) and Cesare Negri's (1602) dance manuals often have a galliard section.\nOne special step used during a galliard is lavolta, a step which involves an intimate, close hold between a couple, with the woman being lifted into the air and the couple turning 270 degrees, within one six-beat measure. Lavolta was considered by some dancing masters as an inappropriate dance.\nAnother special step used during a galliard is the tassel kick (\"salto del fiocco\"). These steps are found in Negri's manual and involve a galliard step usually (though not always) ending with a spin. The easier steps involve single spins of 180 or 360 degrees; later, more difficult steps involve multiple sequential spins and spins of up to at least 540 degrees. During the spin, the dancer kicks out to touch a tassel suspended between knee and waist height.\nMusical form.\nMusical compositions in the galliard form appear to have been written and performed after the dance fell out of popular use. In musical compositions, the galliard often filled the role of an \"after dance\" written in 6, which followed and mimicked another piece (sometimes a pavane) written in 4. The distinctive 6 beats to the phrase can still be heard today in songs such as \"God Save the King\".\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "12545", "revid": "10531370", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=12545", "title": "General surgery", "text": "Medical specialty\nGeneral surgery is a surgical specialty that focuses on alimentary canal and abdominal contents including the esophagus, stomach, small intestine, large intestine, liver, pancreas, gallbladder, appendix and bile ducts, and often the thyroid gland. General surgeons also deal with diseases involving the skin, breast, soft tissue, trauma, peripheral artery disease and hernias and perform endoscopic as such as gastroscopy, colonoscopy and laparoscopic procedures.\nScope.\nGeneral surgeons may sub-specialise into one or more of the following disciplines:\nTrauma surgery.\nIn many parts of the world including North America, Australia and the United Kingdom, the overall responsibility for trauma care falls under the auspices of general surgery. Some general surgeons obtain advanced training in this field (most commonly surgical critical care) and specialty certification surgical critical care. General surgeons must be able to deal initially with almost any surgical emergency. Often, they are the first port of call to critically ill or gravely injured patients, and must perform a variety of procedures to stabilize such patients, such as thoracostomy, cricothyroidotomy, compartment fasciotomies and emergency laparotomy or thoracotomy to stanch bleeding. They are also called upon to staff surgical intensive care units or trauma intensive care units.\nAll general surgeons are trained in emergency surgery. Bleeding, infections, bowel obstructions and organ perforations are the main problems they deal with. Cholecystectomy, the surgical removal of the gallbladder, is one of the most common surgical procedures done worldwide. This is most often done electively, but the gallbladder can become acutely inflamed and require an emergency operation. Infections and rupture of the appendix and small bowel obstructions are other common emergencies.\nLaparoscopic surgery.\nThis is a relatively new specialty dealing with minimal access techniques using cameras and small instruments inserted through 3- to 15-mm incisions. Robotic surgery is now evolving from this concept (see below). Gallbladders, appendices, and colons can all be removed with this technique. Hernias are also able to be repaired laparoscopically. Bariatric surgery can be performed laparoscopically and there are benefits of doing so to reduce wound complications in obese patients. General surgeons that are trained today are expected to be proficient in laparoscopic procedures.\nColorectal surgery.\nGeneral surgeons treat a wide variety of major and minor colon and rectal diseases including inflammatory bowel diseases (such as ulcerative colitis or Crohn's disease), diverticulitis, colon and rectal cancer, gastrointestinal bleeding and hemorrhoids.\nUpper gastrointestinal surgery.\nGeneral surgeons can specialise in Upper Gastro-intestinal (or foregut) surgery, which includes the surgical treatment of diseases of the stomach and oesophagus, liver, pancreas and gallbladder. In the UK, Upper GI surgeons can subspecialise further as benign surgeons, dealing with hiatus hernias and gallbladder diseases, bariatric surgeons, providing surgical care for weight management and metabolic diseases, or oesophago-gastric surgeons, dealing with complex problems related to the upper gastrointestinal tract (the foregut), including cancer. Surgical care of complex liver and pancreatic problems (including liver cancer and pancreatic cancer) is undertaken by Hepatobiliary and Pancreatic Surgery sub-specialists.\nBreast surgery.\nGeneral surgeons perform a majority of all non-cosmetic breast surgery from lumpectomy to mastectomy, especially pertaining to the evaluation, diagnosis and treatment of breast cancer.\nVascular surgery.\nGeneral surgeons can perform vascular surgery if they receive special training and certification in vascular surgery. Otherwise, these procedures are typically performed by vascular surgery specialists. However, general surgeons are capable of treating minor vascular disorders.\nEndocrine surgery.\nGeneral surgeons are trained to remove all or part of the thyroid and parathyroid glands in the neck and the adrenal glands just above each kidney in the abdomen. In many communities, they are the only surgeon trained to do this. In communities that have a number of subspecialists, other subspecialty surgeons may assume responsibility for these procedures.\nTransplant surgery.\nResponsible for all aspects of pre-operative, operative, and post-operative care of abdominal organ transplant patients. Transplanted organs include liver, kidney, pancreas, and more rarely small bowel.\nSurgical oncology.\nSurgical oncologist refers to a general surgical oncologist (a specialty of a general surgeon), but thoracic surgical oncologists, gynecologist and so forth can all be considered surgeons who specialize in treating cancer patients. The importance of training surgeons who sub-specialize in cancer surgery lies in evidence, supported by a number of clinical trials, that outcomes in surgical cancer care are positively associated to surgeon volume (i.e., the more cancer cases a surgeon treats, the more proficient they become, and their patients experience improved survival rates as a result). This is another controversial point, but it is generally accepted, even as common sense, that a surgeon who performs a given operation more often, will achieve superior results when compared with a surgeon who rarely performs the same procedure. This is particularly true of complex cancer resections such as pancreaticoduodenectomy for pancreatic cancer, and gastrectomy with extended (D2) lymphadenectomy for gastric cancer. Surgical oncology is generally a 2-year fellowship following completion of a general surgery residency (5\u20137 years).\nCardiothoracic surgery.\nMost cardiothoracic surgeons in the U.S. (D.O. or M.D.) first complete a general surgery residency (typically 5\u20137 years), followed by a cardiothoracic surgery fellowship (typically 2\u20133 years). However, new programmes are currently offering cardiothoracic surgery as a residency (6\u20138 years).\nPediatric surgery.\nPediatric surgery is a subspecialty of general surgery. Pediatric surgeons do surgery on patients under age 18. Pediatric surgery is 5\u20137 years of residency and a 2\u20133 year fellowship.\nTrends.\nIn the 2000s, minimally invasive surgery became more prevalent. Considerable enthusiasm has been built around robot-assisted surgery (also known as \"robotic surgery\"), despite a lack of data suggesting it has significant benefits that justify its cost.\nTraining.\nIn Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and the United States general surgery is a five to seven year residency and follows completion of medical school, either MD, MBBS, MBChB, or DO degrees. In Australia and New Zealand, a residency leads to eligibility for Fellowship of the Royal Australasian College of Surgeons. In Canada, residency leads to eligibility for certification by and Fellowship of the Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Canada, while in the United States, completion of a residency in general surgery leads to eligibility for board certification by the American Board of Surgery or the American Osteopathic Board of Surgery which is also required upon completion of training for a general surgeon to have operating privileges at most hospitals in the United States.\nIn the United Kingdom, surgical trainees may apply to enter training after five years of medical school and two years of the Foundation Programme. During the two year core surgical training programme (\"phase 1\"), doctors are required to sit the Membership of the Royal College of Surgeons (MRCS) examination. On award of the MRCS by one of the four surgical colleges, surgeons may hold the title 'Mister' or 'Miss/Ms./Mrs' rather than doctor. This tradition dates back hundreds of years in the United Kingdom from when only physicians attended medical school and surgeons did not, but were rather associated with barbers in the Barber Surgeon's Guild. The tradition is also present in many Commonwealth countries including New Zealand and some states of Australia. After completion of phase 1 training, trainees may apply for a nationally awarded Higher Surgical Training (HST) programme, which lasts six years and is now divided into two further phases (phases 2 and 3). Trainees are expected to declare a sub-specialty before the end of phase 2, and training during phase 3 focuses on that sub-specialty. Before the end of HST, the examination for Fellowship of the Royal College of Surgeons (FRCS) must be taken in general surgery plus the subspeciality. Upon completion of training, the surgeon will be eligible for entry on the GMC Specialist Register. They may then apply to work both in the NHS and independent sector as a consultant surgeon, although many trainees complete further fellowships. The implementation of the European Working Time Directive limited UK surgical residents to an average 48-hour working week.\nIn India general surgery is a 3 year postgraduate medical degree referred as MS (General Surgery) and often is the foundation course for further super-specialisation such as Neurosurgery, Cardiothoracic surgery, plastic surgery, etc. In India qualified physicians may apply for the course after successful completion of MBBS from a NMC recognised institution, one year of mandatory internship and rural service bond (if any). The candidates applying for general surgery must clear for NEET (PG) or AIIMS INI-CET (for admission in institutions of national importance) and are granted admission on the basis of merit and reservation.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "12546", "revid": "14423536", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=12546", "title": "Gorilla", "text": "Genus of large African apes\nGorillas are large, primarily herbivorous, great apes that live in the tropical forests of equatorial Africa. The genus Gorilla is divided into two species: the eastern gorilla and the western gorilla, and either four or five subspecies. The DNA of gorillas is highly similar to that of humans, from 96 to 99% depending on what is included, and they are the next closest living relatives to humans after the bonobos and chimpanzees.\nGorillas are the largest living primates, reaching heights between , weights between , and arm spans up to , depending on species and sex. They tend to live in troops, with the leader being called a silverback. The eastern gorilla is distinguished from the western by darker fur colour and some other minor morphological differences. Gorillas tend to live 35\u201340 years in the wild.\nGorillas' natural habitats cover tropical or subtropical forests in Sub-Saharan Africa. Although their range covers a small percentage of Sub-Saharan Africa, gorillas cover a wide range of elevations. The mountain gorilla inhabits the Albertine Rift montane cloud forests of the Virunga Volcanoes, ranging in altitude from . Lowland gorillas live in dense forests and lowland swamps and marshes as low as sea level, with western lowland gorillas living in Central West African countries and eastern lowland gorillas living in the Democratic Republic of the Congo near its border with Rwanda.\nThere are thought to be around 316,000 western gorillas in the wild, and 5,000 eastern gorillas. Both species are classified as Critically Endangered by the IUCN; all subspecies are classified as Critically Endangered with the exception of the mountain gorilla, which is classified as Endangered. There are many threats to their survival, such as poaching, habitat destruction, and disease, which threaten the survival of the species. However, conservation efforts have been successful in some areas where they live.\nHistory and etymology.\nThe word \"gorilla\" comes from the history of Hanno the Navigator (c. 500 BC), a Carthaginian explorer on an expedition to the west African coast to the area that later became Sierra Leone. Members of the expedition encountered \"savage people, the greater part of whom were women, whose bodies were hairy, and whom our interpreters called Gorillae\". It is unknown whether what the explorers encountered were what we now call gorillas, another species of ape or monkeys, or humans. Skins of gorillai women, brought back by Hanno, are reputed to have been kept at Carthage until Rome destroyed the city 350 years later at the end of the Punic Wars, 146 BC.\nIn 1625 Andrew Battel mentioned the existence of the animal, under the name Pongo:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;This Pongo is in all proportion like a man, but... he is more like a Giant in stature, than a man: for he is very tall, [and] hath a man's face, hollow-eyed, with long haire vpon his browes. His face and eares are without haire, and his hands also. His bodie is full of haire, but not very thicke, and it is a dunnish colour. . . Hee goeth alwaies vpon his legs, and carrieth his hands clasped on the nape of his necke, when he goeth upon the ground... They goe many together, and kill many Negroes that trauaile in the Woods . . . Those Pongos are neuer taken aliue, because they are so strong, that ten men cannot hold one of them...\nA century and a half after Battel's story was published, one writer called Radermacher wrote that \"the large species, described by Buffon and other authors as of the size of a man, is held by many to be a Chimera.\"\nThe American physician and missionary Thomas Staughton Savage and naturalist Jeffries Wyman first described the western gorilla in 1847 from specimens obtained in Liberia. They called it \"Troglodytes gorilla\", using the then-current name of the chimpanzee genus. The species name was derived from grc \" \"\u0393\u03cc\u03c1\u03b9\u03bb\u03bb\u03b1\u03b9\" (gorillai)\"\u00a0'name of a tribe of hairy women', as described by Hanno.\nEvolution and classification.\nThe closest relatives of gorillas are the other two Homininae genera, chimpanzees and humans, all of them having diverged from a common ancestor about 7\u00a0million years ago. Human gene sequences differ only 1.6% on average from the sequences of corresponding gorilla genes, but there is further difference in how many copies each gene has.\nUntil recently, gorillas were considered to be a single species, with three subspecies: the western lowland gorilla, the eastern lowland gorilla and the mountain gorilla. There is now agreement that there are two species, each with two subspecies. More recently, a third subspecies has been claimed to exist in one of the species. The separate species and subspecies developed from a single type of gorilla during the Ice Age, when their forest habitats shrank and became isolated from each other. Primatologists continue to explore the relationships between various gorilla populations. The species and subspecies listed here are the ones upon which most scientists agree.\n!scope=\"col\" style=\"width:15%; min-width:180px;\"|Common name\n!scope=\"col\" style=\"width:25%;\"|Scientific name and subspecies\n!scope=\"col\" style=\"width:15%; min-width:180px;\"|Range\n!scope\n\"col\" style\n\"width:29%;\"\n!scope\n\"col\" style\n\"width:16%; min-width:112px;\"\n!scope=\"row\"|Eastern gorilla \n!scope=\"row\"|Western gorilla \nThe proposed third subspecies of \"Gorilla beringei\", which has not yet received a trinomen, is the Bwindi population of the mountain gorilla, sometimes called the Bwindi gorilla.\nSome variations that distinguish the classifications of gorilla include varying density, size, hair colour, length, culture, and facial widths. Population genetics of the lowland gorillas suggest that the western and eastern lowland populations diverged around 261 thousand years ago.\nCharacteristics.\nWild male gorillas weigh , while adult females weigh . Adult males are tall, with an arm span that stretches from . Female gorillas are shorter at , with smaller arm spans. Colin Groves (1970) calculated the average weight of 42 wild adult male gorillas at 144\u00a0kg, while Smith and Jungers (1997) found the average weight of 19 wild adult male gorillas to be 169\u00a0kg. Adult male gorillas are known as silverbacks for the characteristic silver hair on their backs, reaching to the hips. The tallest wild gorilla recorded was a silverback with an arm span of , a chest of , and a weight of , shot in Alimbongo, northern Kivu in May 1938. The heaviest wild gorilla recorded was a silverback shot in Ambam, Cameroon, which weighed . The tallest gorilla in captivity was Gust, a western lowland gorilla that was captured as a baby in Belgian Congo and spent his life at Antwerp Zoo. He was tall. Males in captivity can be overweight and reach weights up to .\nThe eastern gorilla is more darkly coloured than the western gorilla, with the mountain gorilla being the darkest of all. The mountain gorilla also has the thickest hair. The western lowland gorilla can be brown or greyish with a reddish forehead. In addition, gorillas that live in lowland forest are more slender and agile than the more bulky mountain gorillas. The eastern gorilla also has a longer face and broader chest than the western gorilla. Like humans, gorillas have individual fingerprints.\nTheir eye colour is dark brown, framed by a black ring around the iris. Gorilla facial structure is described as mandibular prognathism, that is, the mandible protrudes farther out than the maxilla. Adult males also have a prominent sagittal crest.\nGorillas move around by knuckle-walking, although they sometimes walk upright for short distances, typically while carrying food or in defensive situations. A 2018 study investigating the hand posture of 77 mountain gorillas at Bwindi Impenetrable National Park (8% of the population) found that knuckle walking was done only 60% of the time, and they also supported their weight on their fists, the backs of their hands/feet, and on their palms/soles (with the digits flexed). Such a range of hand postures was previously thought to have been used by only orangutans. Studies of gorilla handedness have yielded varying results, with some arguing for no preference for either hand, and others right-hand dominance for the general population.\nStudies have shown gorilla blood is not reactive to anti-A and anti-B monoclonal antibodies, which would, in humans, indicate type O blood. Due to novel sequences, though, it is different enough to not conform with the human ABO blood group system, into which the other great apes fit.\nA gorilla's lifespan is normally between 35 and 40 years, although zoo gorillas may live for 50 years or more in rare circumstances. At , Fatou is both the oldest living gorilla and oldest living female gorilla. The oldest male gorilla ever was Ozoum, who reached the final age of 61 years, 24 days. The oldest living male gorilla is Guhonda, aged .\nDistribution and habitat.\nGorillas have a patchy distribution. The range of the two species is separated by the Congo River and its tributaries. The western gorilla lives in west central Africa, while the eastern gorilla lives in east central Africa. Between the species, and even within the species, gorillas live in a variety of habitats and elevations. Gorilla habitat ranges from montane forest to swampland. Eastern gorillas inhabit montane and submontane forests between above sea level.\nMountain gorillas live in montane forests at the higher end of the elevation range, while eastern lowland gorillas live in submontane forests at the lower end. In addition, eastern lowland gorillas live in montane bamboo forests, as well as lowland forests ranging from in elevation. Western gorillas live in both lowland swamp forests and montane forests, at elevations ranging from sea level to . Western lowland gorillas live in swamp and lowland forests ranging up to , and Cross River gorillas live in low-lying and submontane forests ranging from .\nEcology.\nDiet and foraging.\nA gorilla's day is divided between rest periods and travel or feeding periods. Diets differ between and within species. Mountain gorillas mostly eat foliage, such as leaves, stems, pith, and shoots, while fruit makes up a very small part of their diets. Mountain gorilla food is widely distributed and neither individuals nor groups have to compete with one another. Their home ranges vary from , and their movements range around or less on an average day. Despite eating a few species in each habitat, mountain gorillas have flexible diets and can live in a variety of habitats.\nEastern lowland gorillas have more diverse diets, which vary seasonally. Leaves and pith are commonly eaten, but fruits can make up as much as 25% of their diets. Since fruit is less available, lowland gorillas must travel farther each day, and their home ranges vary from , with day ranges . Eastern lowland gorillas will also eat insects, preferably ants. Western lowland gorillas depend on fruits more than the others and they are more dispersed across their range. They travel even farther than the other gorilla subspecies, at per day on average, and have larger home ranges of . Western lowland gorillas have less access to terrestrial herbs, although they can access aquatic herbs in some areas. Termites and ants are also eaten.\nGorillas rarely drink water \"because they consume succulent vegetation that is comprisedof almost half water as well as morning dew\", although both mountain and lowland gorillas have been observed drinking.\nNesting.\nGorillas construct nests for daytime and night use. Nests tend to be simple aggregations of branches and leaves about in diameter and are constructed by individuals. Gorillas, unlike chimpanzees or orangutans, tend to sleep in nests on the ground. The young nest with their mothers, but construct nests after three years of age, initially close to those of their mothers. Gorilla nests are distributed arbitrarily and use of tree species for site and construction appears to be opportunistic. Nest-building by great apes is now considered to be not just animal architecture, but as an important instance of tool use.\nGorillas make a new nest to sleep on each day; even if remaining in the same place, they do not use the previous one. Usually, they are made an hour before dusk, to be ready to sleep when night falls. Gorillas sleep longer than humans, an average of 12 hours per day.\nInterspecies interactions.\nOne possible predator of gorillas is the leopard. Gorilla remains have been found in leopard scat, but this may be the result of scavenging. When the group is attacked by humans, leopards, or other gorillas, an individual silverback will protect the group, even at the cost of his own life. Gorillas do not appear to directly compete with chimpanzees in areas where they overlap. When fruit is abundant, gorilla and chimpanzee diets converge, but when fruit is scarce gorillas resort to vegetation. The two apes may also feed on different species, whether fruit or insects. Gorillas and chimpanzees may ignore or avoid each other when feeding on the same tree, but they have also been documented to form social bonds. Conversely, coalitions of chimpanzees have been observed attacking families of gorillas including silverbacks and killing infants.\nBehaviour.\nSocial structure.\nGorillas live in groups called troops. Troops tend to be made of one adult male or silverback, with a harem of multiple adult females and their offspring. However, multiple-male troops also exist. A silverback is typically more than 12 years of age, and is named for the distinctive patch of silver hair on his back, which comes with maturity. Silverbacks have large canine teeth that also come with maturity. Both males and females tend to emigrate from their natal groups. For mountain gorillas, females disperse from their natal troops more than males. Mountain gorillas and western lowland gorillas also commonly transfer to second new groups.\nMature males also tend to leave their groups and establish their own troops by attracting emigrating females. However, male mountain gorillas sometimes stay in their natal troops and become subordinate to the silverback. If the silverback dies, these males may be able to become dominant or mate with the females. This behaviour has not been observed in eastern lowland gorillas. In a single male group, when the silverback dies, the females and their offspring disperse and find a new troop. Without a silverback to protect them, the infants will likely fall victim to infanticide. Joining a new group is likely to be a tactic against this. However, while gorilla troops usually disband after the silverback dies, female eastern lowlands gorillas and their offspring have been recorded staying together until a new silverback transfers into the group. This likely serves as protection from leopards.\nThe silverback is the centre of the troop's attention, making all the decisions, mediating conflicts, determining the movements of the group, leading the others to feeding sites, and taking responsibility for the safety and well-being of the troop. Younger males subordinate to the silverback, known as blackbacks, may serve as backup protection. Blackbacks are aged between 8 and 12 years and lack the silver back hair. The bond that a silverback has with his females forms the core of gorilla social life. Bonds between them are maintained by grooming and staying close together. Females form strong relationships with males to gain mating opportunities and protection from predators and infanticidal outside males. However, aggressive behaviours between males and females do occur, but rarely lead to serious injury. Relationships between females may vary. Maternally related females in a troop tend to be friendly towards each other and associate closely. Otherwise, females have few friendly encounters and commonly act aggressively towards each other.\nFemales may fight for social access to males and a male may intervene. Male gorillas have weak social bonds, particularly in multiple-male groups with apparent dominance hierarchies and strong competition for mates. Males in all-male groups, though, tend to have friendly interactions and socialise through play, grooming, and staying together, and occasionally they even engage in homosexual interactions. Severe aggression is rare in stable groups, but when two mountain gorilla groups meet the two silverbacks can sometimes engage in a fight to the death, using their canines to cause deep, gaping injuries.\nReproduction and parenting.\nFemales mature at 10\u201312 years (earlier in captivity), and males at 11\u201313 years. A female's first ovulatory cycle occurs when she is six years of age, and is followed by a two-year period of adolescent infertility. The estrous cycle lasts 30\u201333 days, with outward ovulation signs subtle compared to those of chimpanzees. The gestation period lasts 8.5 months. Female mountain gorillas first give birth at 10 years of age and have four-year interbirth intervals. Males can be fertile before reaching adulthood. Gorillas mate year round.\nFemales will purse their lips and slowly approach a male while making eye contact. This serves to urge the male to mount her. If the male does not respond, then she will try to attract his attention by reaching towards him or slapping the ground. In multiple-male groups, solicitation indicates female preference, but females can be forced to mate with multiple males. Males incite copulation by approaching a female and displaying at her or touching her and giving a \"train grunt\". Copulation typically lasts 1\u20132 minutes, but can last as long as 20 minutes. Recently, gorillas have been observed engaging in face-to-face sex, a trait once considered unique to humans and bonobos.\nGorilla infants are vulnerable and dependent, thus mothers, their primary caregivers, are important to their survival. Male gorillas are not active in caring for the young, but they do play a role in socialising them to other youngsters. The silverback has a largely supportive relationship with the infants in his troop and shields them from aggression within the group. Infants remain in contact with their mothers for the first five months and mothers stay near the silverback for protection. Infants suckle at least once per hour and sleep with their mothers in the same nest.\nInfants begin to break contact with their mothers after five months, but only for a brief period each time. By 12 months old, infants move up to from their mothers. At around 18\u201321 months, the distance between mother and offspring increases and they regularly spend time away from each other. In addition, nursing decreases to once every two hours. Infants spend only half of their time with their mothers by 30 months. They enter their juvenile period at their third year, and this lasts until their sixth year. At this time, gorillas are weaned and they sleep in a separate nest from their mothers. After their offspring are weaned, females begin to ovulate and soon become pregnant again. The presence of play partners, including the silverback, minimizes conflicts in weaning between mother and offspring.\nCommunication.\nTwenty-five distinct vocalisations are recognised, many of which are used primarily for group communication within dense vegetation. Sounds classified as grunts and barks are heard most frequently while traveling, and indicate the whereabouts of individual group members. They may also be used during social interactions when discipline is required. Screams and roars signal alarm or warning, and are produced most often by silverbacks. Deep, rumbling belches suggest contentment and are heard frequently during feeding and resting periods. They are the most common form of intragroup communication.\nFor this reason, conflicts are most often resolved by displays and other threat behaviours that are intended to intimidate without becoming physical. As a result, fights do not occur very frequently. The ritualized charge display is unique to gorillas. The entire sequence has nine steps: (1) progressively quickening hooting, (2) symbolic feeding, (3) rising bipedally, (4) throwing vegetation, (5) chest-beating with cupped hands, (6) one leg kick, (7) sideways running, two-legged to four-legged, (8) slapping and tearing vegetation, and (9) thumping the ground with palms to end display.\nA gorilla's chest-beat may vary in frequency depending on its size. Smaller ones tend to have higher frequencies, while larger ones tend to be lower. They also do it the most when females are ready to mate.\nIntelligence.\nGorillas are considered highly intelligent. A few individuals in captivity, such as Koko, have been taught a subset of sign language. Like the other great apes, gorillas can laugh, grieve, have \"rich emotional lives\", develop strong family bonds, make and use tools, and think about the past and future. Some researchers believe gorillas have spiritual feelings or religious sentiments. They have been shown to have cultures in different areas revolving around different methods of food preparation, and will show individual colour preferences.\nTool use.\nThe following observations were made by a team led by Thomas Breuer of the Wildlife Conservation Society in September 2005. Gorillas are now known to use tools in the wild. A female gorilla in the Nouabal\u00e9-Ndoki National Park in the Republic of Congo was recorded using a stick as if to gauge the depth of water whilst crossing a swamp. A second female was seen using a tree stump as a bridge and also as a support whilst fishing in the swamp. This means all of the great apes are now known to use tools.\nIn September 2005, a two-and-a-half-year-old gorilla in the Republic of Congo was discovered using rocks to smash open palm nuts inside a game sanctuary. While this was the first such observation for a gorilla, over 40 years previously, chimpanzees had been seen using tools in the wild 'fishing' for termites. Nonhuman great apes are endowed with semiprecision grips, and have been able to use both simple tools and even weapons, such as improvising a club from a convenient fallen branch.\nScientific study.\nAmerican physician and missionary Thomas Staughton Savage obtained the first specimens (the skull and other bones) during his time in Liberia. The first scientific description of gorillas dates back to an article by Savage and the naturalist Jeffries Wyman in 1847 in \"Proceedings of the Boston Society of Natural History\", where \"Troglodytes gorilla\" is described, now known as the western gorilla. Other species of gorilla were described in the next few years.\nThe explorer Paul Du Chaillu was the first westerner to see a live gorilla during his travel through western equatorial Africa from 1856 to 1859. He brought dead specimens to the UK in 1861.\nThe first systematic study was not conducted until the 1920s, when Carl Akeley of the American Museum of Natural History traveled to Africa to hunt for an animal to be shot and stuffed. On his first trip, he was accompanied by his friends Mary Bradley, a mystery writer, her husband, and their young daughter Alice, who would later write science fiction under the pseudonym James Tiptree Jr. After their trip, Mary Bradley wrote \"On the Gorilla Trail\". She later became an advocate for the conservation of gorillas, and wrote several more books (mainly for children). In the late 1920s and early 1930s, Robert Yerkes and his wife Ava helped further the study of gorillas when they sent Harold Bigham to Africa. Yerkes also wrote a book in 1929 about the great apes.\nAfter World War II, George Schaller was one of the first researchers to go into the field and study primates. In 1959, he conducted a systematic study of the mountain gorilla in the wild and published his work. Years later, at the behest of Louis Leakey and the \"National Geographic\", Dian Fossey conducted a much longer and more comprehensive study of the mountain gorilla. When she published her work, many misconceptions and myths about gorillas were finally disproved, including the myth that gorillas are violent.\nWestern lowland gorillas (\"G. g. gorilla\") are believed to be one of the zoonotic origins of HIV/AIDS. The SIVgor Simian immunodeficiency virus that infects them is similar to a certain strain of HIV-1.\nGenome sequencing.\nThe gorilla became the next-to-last great ape genus to have its genome sequenced. The first gorilla genome was generated with short read and Sanger sequencing using DNA from a female western lowland gorilla named Kamilah. This gave scientists further insight into the evolution and origin of humans. Despite the chimpanzees being the closest extant relatives of humans, 15% of the human genome was found to be more like that of the gorilla. In addition, 30% of the gorilla genome \"is closer to human or chimpanzee than the latter are to each other; this is rarer around coding genes, indicating pervasive selection throughout great ape evolution, and has functional consequences in gene expression.\" Analysis of the gorilla genome has cast doubt on the idea that the rapid evolution of hearing genes gave rise to language in humans, as it also occurred in gorillas.\nCaptivity.\nGorillas became highly prized by western zoos since the 19th century, though the earliest attempts to keep them in captive facilities ended in their early death. In the late 1920s, the care of captive gorillas significantly improved. Colo (22 December 1956 \u2013 17 January 2017) of the Columbus Zoo and Aquarium was the first gorilla to be born in captivity.\nCaptive gorillas exhibit stereotypic behaviors, including eating such as regurgitation, reingestion and self-injurious or conspecific aggression, pacing, rocking, sucking of fingers or lip smacking, and overgrooming. Negative vigilance of visitor behaviors have been identified as starting, posturing and charging at visitors. Groups of bachelor gorillas containing young silverbacks have significantly higher levels of aggression and wounding rates than mixed age and sex groups.\nThe use of both internal and external privacy screens on exhibit windows has been shown to alleviate stresses from visual effects of high crowd densities, leading to decreased stereotypic behaviors in the gorillas. Playing naturalistic auditory stimuli as opposed to classical music, rock music, or no auditory enrichment (which allows for crowd noise, machinery, etc. to be heard) has been noted to reduce stress behavior as well. Enrichment modifications to feed and foraging, where clover-hay is added to an exhibit floor, decrease stereotypic activities while simultaneously increasing positive food-related behaviors.\nRecent research on captive gorilla welfare emphasizes a need to shift to individual assessments instead of a one-size-fits-all group approach to understanding how welfare increases or decreases based on a variety of factors. Individual characteristics such as age, sex, personality and individual histories are essential in understanding that stressors will affect each individual gorilla and their welfare differently.\nConservation status.\nAll species (and subspecies) of gorilla are listed as endangered or critically endangered on the IUCN Red List. All gorillas are listed in Appendix I of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES), meaning that international export/import of the species, including in parts and derivatives, is regulated. Around 316,000 western lowland gorillas are thought to exist in the wild, 4,000 in zoos, thanks to conservation; eastern lowland gorillas have a population of under 5,000 in the wild and 24 in zoos. Mountain gorillas are the most severely endangered, with an estimated population of about 880 left in the wild and none in zoos. Threats to gorilla survival include habitat destruction and poaching for the bushmeat trade. Gorillas are closely related to humans, and are susceptible to diseases that humans also get infected by. In 2004, a population of several hundred gorillas in the Odzala National Park, Republic of Congo was essentially wiped out by the Ebola virus. A 2006 study published in \"Science\" concluded more than 5,000 gorillas may have died in recent outbreaks of the Ebola virus in central Africa. The researchers indicated in conjunction with commercial hunting of these apes, the virus creates \"a recipe for rapid ecological extinction\". In captivity, it has also been observed that gorillas can also be infected with COVID-19.\nConservation efforts include the Great Apes Survival Project, a partnership between the United Nations Environment Programme and the UNESCO, and also an international treaty, the Agreement on the Conservation of Gorillas and Their Habitats, concluded under UNEP-administered Convention on Migratory Species. The Gorilla Agreement is the first legally binding instrument exclusively targeting gorilla conservation; it came into effect on 1 June 2008. Governments of countries where gorillas live placed a ban on their killing and trading, but weak law enforcement still poses a threat to them, since the governments rarely apprehend poachers, traders and consumers that rely on gorillas for profit.\nCultural significance.\nIn Cameroon's Lebialem highlands, folk stories connect people and gorillas via totems; a gorilla's death means the connected person will die also. This creates a local conservation ethic. Many different indigenous peoples interact with wild gorillas. Some have detailed knowledge; the Baka have words to distinguish at least ten types of gorilla individuals, by sex, age, and relationships. In 1861, alongside tales of hunting enormous gorillas, the traveller and anthropologist Paul Du Chaillu reported the Cameroonian story that a pregnant woman who sees a gorilla will give birth to one.\nIn 1911, the anthropologist Albert Jenks noted the Bulu people's knowledge of gorilla behaviour and ecology, and their gorilla stories. In one such story, \"The Gorilla and the Child\", a gorilla speaks to people, seeking help and trust, and stealing a baby; a man accidentally kills the baby while attacking the gorilla. Even far from where gorillas live, savannah tribes pursue \"cult-like worship\" of the apes. Some beliefs are widespread among indigenous peoples. The Fang name for gorilla is \"ngi\" while the Bulu name is \"njamong\"; the root \"ngi\" means fire, denoting a positive energy. From the Central African Republic to Cameroon and Gabon, stories of reincarnations as gorillas, totems, and transformations similar to those recorded by Du Chaillu are still told in the 21st century.\nSince gaining international attention, gorillas have been a recurring element of many aspects of popular culture and media. They were usually portrayed as murderous and aggressive. Inspired by Emmanuel Fr\u00e9miet's \"Gorilla Carrying off a Woman\", gorillas have been depicted kidnapping human women. This theme was used in films such as \"Ingagi\" (1930) and most notably \"King Kong\" (1933). The comedic play \"The Gorilla\", which debuted in 1925, featured an escaped gorilla taking a woman from her house. Several films would use the \"escaped gorilla\" trope including \"The Strange Case of Doctor Rx\" (1942), \"The Gorilla Man\" (1943), \"Gorilla at Large\" (1954) and the Disney cartoons \"The Gorilla Mystery\" (1930) and \"Donald Duck and the Gorilla\" (1944).\nGorillas have been used as opponents to jungle-themed heroes such as Tarzan and Sheena, Queen of the Jungle, as well as superheroes. The DC Comics supervillain Gorilla Grodd is an enemy of the Flash. Gorillas also serve as antagonists in the 1968 film \"Planet of the Apes\". More positive and sympathetic portrayals of gorillas include the films \"Son of Kong\" (1933), \"Mighty Joe Young\" (1949), \"Gorillas in the Mist\" (1988) and \"Instinct\" (1999) and the 1992 novel \"Ishmael\". Gorillas have been featured in video games as well, notably \"Donkey Kong\".\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nLiterature cited.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The first edition was published in 1989.\nContents.\n\"GURPS Supers\" is a supplement of rules for comic-book superhero characters and campaigns for \"GURPS\". The first edition book includes new combat rules, 24 superpowers, bionic superlimbs, gadgets and equipment, and rules for creating new powers, sample heroes and villains, and a briefly described campaign world. The second edition book is revised and corrected.\n\"GURPS Supers\" deals with super-powered characters in a modern-day setting, and contains all the necessary rules to create superheroes for the \"GURPS\" basic system. The book also contains suggestions for running a superhero campaign, and a detailed background setting with the UN controlling most superheroes.\nSetting.\nThe official \"house setting\" for \"GURPS Supers\" is the \"IST World\", described briefly in chapter 7 of \"GURPS Supers\" and later appearing in its own full-length supplement, \"GURPS International Super Teams\".\nSystem.\n\"GURPS Supers\" is a supplement for the GURPS roleplaying game and uses that basic rule system. The supplement offers additional rules and options for characters with superpowers.\nPlayers can choose from several different basic types of superhero characters that influence how the character's powers are selected. Players can select from a wide variety of powers and their modifications given in \"GURPS Supers\", augmented by those in the \"GURPS Basic\", plus any other GURPS book included by the campaign. The rules book included advice on creating superhero campaigns, and ways for the game master to customize the style of the campaign.\nAs part of the GURPS system, \"GURPS Supers\" allows the exchange of a player's characters between any of the numerous other genres supported by GURPS. \"GURPS Supers\" favors lower-powered heroes over higher-powered ones. Many of the superpowers unique to \"GURPS Supers\" appear as Advantages and Disadvantages in the GURPS 4e Basic Set.\nHistory.\n\"GURPS Supers\" was written by Loyd Blankenship, with a cover by Alan Gutierrez and Charlie Weidman, and was first published by Steve Jackson Games in 1988 as a 112-page book. \"GURPS Space\" was one of the broad genre books that was published after the \"GURPS Basic Set\".\nThe 2nd edition of \"GURPS Supers\" was published in 1990 and featured a cover by John Zeleznik.\nEarlier editions and supplements.\nThe first edition of \"GURPS Supers\" was printed in 1989, and the second edition was published in 1990. The first edition had groupings of character powers that were not used in the second edition. Both were based on the Third Edition of \"GURPS Basic\".\nThere were various aids, supplements and ready-made adventures available, including:\n4th Edition.\n\"GURPS Supers\" for 4e was published in 2007, one of several genre books published by Steve Jackson Games for the new edition.\nFor the 4th edition of GURPS, the majority of rules governing the creation of superhero characters are covered in the more generic \"GURPS Powers\". A PDF release by William H. Stoddard covers the genre specific information in a similar style to \"GURPS Fantasy\" and \"GURPS Space\" books for the fourth edition of GURPS.\nReception.\nIn the August 1989 edition of \"Games International\" (Issue #8), James Wallis liked the design and layout of the book, but pointed out that \"the rewriting of a large number of rules [...] shows that \"GURPS\" is not a truly generic rolegame and makes \"GURPS Supers\" substantially harder to learn\". He disliked the additional complexities around character generation, and was disturbed that the book did not spend much time on the creation of character background, saying this was a failure of the system to properly engage with the nature of comic books. He also commented that \"GURPS\" combat was frequently deadly, whereas in comic books combat is not usually lethal. Wallis concluded by giving this book a below average rating of only 2 out of 5: \"For my money, \"GURPS Supers\" is flawed [...] There is too much emphasis on rules changes; it fails as a superhero rolegame because of the overrealism of the \"GURPS\" rules, and it fails as a generic sourcebook because it is not generic\". \nIn the September 1996 edition of \"Dragon\" (Issue #233), Rick Swan compared the second edition of \"GURPS Supers\" to \"Champions\", and commented that \"\"GURPS Super\" takes a more realistic route, stressing personality over punch-outs. That's not to say it's stodgy; a typical chapter is titled 'Unnatural Multiple Limbs from Another World'. The Second Edition streamlines the occasionally awkward mechanics of the First Edition and adds some nifty new powers\". \nIn the May 1996 edition of \"Arcane\" (issue #6), Steve Faragher gave the second edition of \"GURPS Supers\" a below-average rating of only 6 out of 10, and called the background setting \"rather dull\", saying it is \"fine if you want to recreate a Saturday afternoon TV show, but not so great for a more fantastic, underground campaign of the \"Watchmen\" variety\". Faragher concluded that \"it's a competent enough set of rules - and one that's well presented - but \"GURPS Supers\" is not exactly compulsive playing material\".\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "12551", "revid": "3632083", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=12551", "title": "Gymnastics", "text": "Sport requiring strength and flexibility\nGymnastics is a group of sport that includes physical exercises requiring balance, strength, flexibility, agility, coordination, artistry and endurance. The movements involved in gymnastics contribute to the development of the arms, legs, shoulders, back, chest, and abdominal muscle groups. Gymnastics evolved from exercises used by the ancient Greeks that included skills for mounting and dismounting a horse.\nThe most common form of competitive gymnastics is artistic gymnastics (AG); for women, the events include floor, vault, uneven bars, and balance beam; for men, besides floor and vault, it includes rings, pommel horse, parallel bars, and horizontal bar.\nThe governing body for competition in gymnastics throughout the world is the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de Gymnastique (FIG). Eight sports are governed by the FIG, including gymnastics for all, men's and women's artistic gymnastics, rhythmic gymnastics (women's branch only), trampolining (including double mini-trampoline), tumbling, acrobatic, aerobic, parkour and para-gymnastics. Disciplines not currently recognized by FIG include wheel gymnastics, aesthetic group gymnastics, TeamGym, men's rhythmic gymnastics (both the Spanish form which is identical to the women's version and the Japanese version which is a different sport) and mallakhamba.\nParticipants in gymnastics-related sports include young children, recreational-level athletes, and competitive athletes at all skill levels.\nEtymology.\nThe word gymnastics derives from the common Greek adjective (), by way of the related verb (), whose meaning is to \"train naked\", \"train in gymnastic exercise\", generally \"to train, to exercise\". The verb had this meaning because athletes in ancient times exercised and competed without clothing.\nHistory.\nGymnastics can be traced to exercises performed in Ancient Greece, specifically in Sparta and Athens. Exercise of that time was documented by Philostratus' work \"Gymnastics: The Ethics of an Athletic Aesthetic\". The original term for the practice of gymnastics is from the related Greek verb (), which translates as \"to train naked or nude,\" because young men exercised without clothing. In ancient Greece, physical fitness was highly valued among both men and women. It was not until after the Romans conquered Greece in 146 BC that gymnastics became more formalized and was used to train men in warfare. On Philostratus' claim that gymnastics is a form of wisdom, comparable to philosophy, poetry, music, geometry, and astronomy, the people of Athens combined this more physical training with the education of the mind. At the Palestra, a physical education training center, the disciplines of educating the body and the mind were combined, allowing for a form of gymnastics that was more aesthetic and individual and that left behind the focus on strictness, discipline, the emphasis on defeating records, and a focus on strength.\nDon Francisco Amor\u00f3s y Ondeano\u2014a Spanish colonel born on 19 February 1770, in Valencia, who died on 8 August 1848, in Paris\u2014was the first person to introduce educative gymnastics in France. The German Friedrich Ludwig Jahn began the German gymnastics movement in 1811 in Berlin, which led to the invention of the parallel bars, rings, the horizontal bar, the pommel horse and the vault horse.\nGermans Charles Beck and Charles Follen and American John Neal brought the first wave of gymnastics to the United States in the 1820s. Beck opened the first gymnasium in the US in 1825 at the Round Hill School in Northampton, Massachusetts. Follen opened the first college gymnasium and the first public gymnasium in the US in 1826 at Harvard University and in Boston, Massachusetts, respectively. Neal was the first American to open a public gymnasium in the US, in Portland, Maine, in 1827. He also documented and promoted these early efforts in the \"American Journal of Education\" and \"The Yankee\", helping to establish the American branch of the movement.\nThe Federation of International Gymnastics (FIG) was founded in Liege in 1881. By the end of the nineteenth century, men's gymnastics competition was popular enough to be included in the first modern Olympic Games, in 1896. From then until the early 1950s, both national and international competitions involved a changing variety of exercises gathered under the rubric, \"gymnastics,\" which included, for example, synchronized team floor calisthenics, rope climbing, high jumping, running, and horizontal ladder. During the 1920s, women organized and participated in gymnastics events. Elin Falk revolutionized how gymnastics was taught in Swedish schools between 1910 and 1932. The first women's Olympic competition was limited, involving only synchronized calisthenics and track and field. These games were held in 1928 in Amsterdam.\nBy 1954, Olympic Games apparatus and events for men and women had been standardized in a modern format, and uniform grading structures (including a point system from 1 to 15) had been agreed upon. In 1930, the first UK mass movement organization of women in gymnastics, the Women's League of Health and Beauty, was founded by Mary Bagot Stack in London. At this time, Soviet gymnasts astounded the world with highly disciplined and difficult performances, setting a precedent that continues. Television has helped publicize and initiate a modern age of gymnastics. Both men's and women's gymnastics now attract considerable international interest, and excellent gymnasts can be found on every continent.\nIn 2006, a new points system for Artistic gymnastics was put into play. An A Score (or D score) is the difficulty score, which as of 2009 derives from the eight highest-scoring elements in a routine (excluding Vault), in addition to the points awarded for composition requirements; each vault has a difficulty score assigned by the FIG. The B Score (or E Score), is the score for execution and is given for how well the skills are performed.\nFIG-recognized disciplines.\nThe following disciplines are governed by FIG.\nArtistic gymnastics.\nArtistic gymnastics is usually divided into men's and women's gymnastics. Men compete on six events: floor exercise, pommel horse, still rings, vault, parallel bars, and horizontal bar, while women compete on four: vault, uneven bars, balance beam, and floor exercise. In some countries, women at one time competed on the rings, horizontal bar, and parallel bars (for example, in the 1950s in the USSR).\nIn 2006, FIG introduced a new point system for artistic gymnastics. Unlike the old code of points, in which there was a maximum 10.0 score, there are two separate scores that are added to produce the final score. The first is the execution score, which starts at 10 and has deductions taken for execution mistakes, and the second is the difficulty score, which is open-ended and based on what elements the gymnasts perform. It may be lower than the intended difficulty score if the gymnast does not perform or complete all the skills, or they do not connect a skill meant to be connected to another. Scoring for national developmental levels or outside of the FIG competition system may continue to use the 10.0 system; for example, US women's collegiate gymnastics still uses the 10.0 system.\nCompetitive events for women in artistic gymnastics.\nVault.\nIn the vaulting events, gymnasts sprint down a runway, to take off onto a vault board (or perform a roundoff or handspring entry onto a vault board). They then land momentarily inverted on the hands-on the vaulting horse or vaulting table (pre-flight segment) and propel themselves forward or backward off that platform to a two-footed landing (post-flight segment). The post-flight segment may include one or more saltos, or twisting movements. A round-off entry vault, called a Yurchenko, is a commonly performed vault in the higher levels of women's gymnastics. Other vaults include taking off from the vault board with both feet at the same time and either doing a front handspring or round-off onto the vaulting table.\nIn 2001, the traditional vaulting horse was replaced with a new apparatus, sometimes known as a tongue, horse, or vaulting table. The new apparatus is more stable, wider, and longer than the older vaulting horse, approximately in length and in width, giving gymnasts a larger blocking surface. This apparatus is thus considered safer than the vaulting horse used in the past. With the addition of this new, safer vaulting table, gymnasts are attempting more difficult vaults.\nUneven bars.\nOn the uneven bars, gymnasts perform a timed routine on two parallel horizontal bars set at different heights. These bars are made of fiberglass covered in wood laminate to prevent them from breaking. In the past, bars were made of wood, but the bars were prone to breaking, providing an incentive to switch to newer technologies. The height of the bars may be adjusted by to the size needed by individual gymnasts, although the distance between bars cannot be changed for individual gymnasts in elite competition. \nIn the past, the uneven parallel bars were closer together. The bars have been moved increasingly further apart, allowing gymnasts to perform swinging, circling, transitional, and release moves that may pass over, under, and between the two bars. At the elite level, movements must pass through the handstand. Gymnasts often mount the uneven bars using a springboard or a small mat, and they may use chalk (MgCO3) and grips (a leather strip with holes for fingers to protect hands and improve performance) when performing this event. The chalk helps take the moisture out of gymnasts' hands to decrease friction and prevent rips (tears to the skin of the hands); dowel grips help gymnasts grip the bar.\nBalance beam.\nThe gymnast performs a choreographed routine of up to 90 seconds in length consisting of leaps, acrobatic skills, somersaults, turns, and dance elements on a padded beam. The beam is above the ground, long, and wide. It can also be adjusted, to be raised higher or lower.\nFloor.\nThe event in gymnastics performed on the floor is called floor exercise. In the past, the floor exercise event was executed on the bare floor or mats such as wrestling mats. The floor event now occurs on a carpeted x square, usually consisting of hard foam over a layer of plywood, which is supported by springs generally called a spring floor. This provides a firm surface that provides extra bounce or spring when compressed, allowing gymnasts to achieve greater height and a softer landing after the composed skill. Gymnasts perform a choreographed routine to music (without words) for up to 90 seconds. The routine should consist of tumbling passes, series of jumps, leaps, dance elements, acrobatic skills, and turns, or pivots, on one foot. A gymnast can perform up to four tumbling passes, each of which usually includes at least one flight element without hand support.\nCompetitive events for men in artistic gymnastics.\nFloor.\nMale gymnasts also perform on a x spring floor. A series of tumbling passes are performed to demonstrate flexibility, strength, and balance. Strength skills include circles, scales, and press handstands. Men's floor routines usually have multiple passes that have to total between 60 and 70 seconds and are performed without music, unlike the women's event. Rules require that male gymnasts touch each corner of the floor at least once during their routine.\nPommel horse.\nThe pommel horse consists of a horizontal body with two pommels, or handles. Gymnasts perform by using their hands to support themselves on the horse. A typical pommel horse exercise involves both single-leg and double-leg work. Single-leg skills are generally found in the form of scissors, an element often done on the pommels. Double leg work, however, is the main staple of this event. The gymnast swings both legs in a circular motion (clockwise or counterclockwise depending on preference) and performs such skills on all parts of the apparatus. To make the exercise more challenging, gymnasts often include variations on a typical circling skill by turning (moores and spindles) or by straddling their legs (flares). Routines end when the gymnast performs a dismount, either by swinging his body over the horse or landing after a handstand variation.\nStill rings.\nThe rings are suspended on wire cable from a point from the floor. The gymnast grips the rings and must perform a routine demonstrating balance, strength, power, and dynamic motion while preventing the rings themselves from swinging. At least one static strength move is required, but some gymnasts may include two or three. A routine ends with a dismount.\nVault.\nGymnasts sprint down a runway, which is a maximum of runway in length, before hurdling onto a springboard. They then land momentarily inverted on the hands-on the vaulting horse or vaulting table (pre-flight segment) and propel themselves forward or backward off that platform to a two-footed landing (post-flight segment). In advanced gymnastics, multiple twists and somersaults may be added in the post-flight segment before landing. Successful vaults depend on the speed of the run, the length of the hurdle, the power the gymnast generates from the legs and shoulder girdle, the kinesthetic awareness in the air, how well they stuck the landing, and the speed of rotation in the case of more difficult and complex vaults.\nParallel bars.\nMen perform on two bars set in parallel by executing a series of swings, balances, and releases that require great strength and coordination. The width between the bars is adjustable depending upon the actual needs of the gymnasts, and the bars are usually high.\nHorizontal bar.\nA thick steel bar raised is raised the landing area. The gymnast holds on to the bar and performs giant swings or \"giants\" (forward or backward revolutions around the bar in the handstand position), release skills, twists, and changes of direction. By using the momentum from giants and then releasing at the proper point, enough height can be achieved for spectacular dismounts, such as a triple-back salto. Leather grips are usually used to help maintain a grip on the bar, and to prevent rips. While training for this event, straps are often used to ensure that the gymnasts do not fall off the bar as they are learning new skills.\nRhythmic gymnastics.\nAccording to FIG rules, only women compete in rhythmic gymnastics. This is a sport that combines elements of ballet, gymnastics, dance, and apparatus manipulation, with a much greater emphasis on the aesthetic rather than the acrobatic. Gymnasts compete either as individuals or in groups. Individuals perform four separate routines, each using one of the four apparatuses\u2014ball, ribbon, hoop, clubs, and formerly, rope\u2014on a floor area. Groups consist of five gymnasts who perform two routines together, one with five of the same apparatus and one with three of one apparatus and two of another; the FIG defines which apparatuses groups use each year.\nRoutines are given three sub-scores: difficulty, execution, and artistry. Difficulty is open-ended and based on the value given to the elements performed in the routine, and execution and artistry start at ten points and are lowered for specific mistakes made by the gymnasts. The three sub-scores are added together for the final score for each routine.\nInternational competitions are split between Juniors, under sixteen by their year of birth, and Seniors, for women sixteen and over. Gymnasts in Russia and Europe typically start training at a very young age and those at their peak are typically in their late teens (15\u201319) or early twenties. The largest events in the sport are the Olympic Games, World Championships, European Championships, World Cup and Grand Prix series. The first World Championships were held in 1963, and rhythmic gymnastics made its first appearance at the Olympics in 1984.\nMen's rhythmic gymnastics.\nThere are two versions of rhythmic gymnastics for men, neither of which is currently recognized by the FIG. One was developed in Japan in the 1940s and was originally practiced by both boys and girls for fitness, with women still occasionally participating on the club level today. Gymnasts either perform in groups with no apparatus, or individually with apparatus (stick, clubs, rope, or double rings). Unlike women's rhythmic gymnastics, it is performed on a sprung floor, and the gymnasts perform acrobatic moves and flips. The first World Championships was held in 2003. The other version was developed in Europe and uses generally the same rules as the women and the same set of apparatus. It is most prominent in Spain, which has held national men's competitions since 2009 and mixed-gender group competitions since 2021, and France. There currently is no World Championships for this form of Men's Rhythmic Gymnastics. \nTrampolining.\nTrampolining.\nTrampolining and tumbling consists of four events, individual and synchronized trampoline, double mini trampoline, and tumbling (also known as power tumbling or rod floor). Since 2000, individual trampoline has been included in the Olympic Games. The first World Championships were held in 1964.\nIndividual trampoline.\nIndividual routines in trampolining involve a build-up phase, during which the gymnast jumps repeatedly to achieve height, followed by a sequence of ten bounces without pause during which the gymnast performs a sequence of aerial skills. Routines are marked out of a maximum score of 10 points. Additional points (with no maximum at the highest levels of competition) can be earned depending on the difficulty of the moves and the length of time taken to complete the ten skills which is an indication of the average height of the jumps. In high level competitions, there are two preliminary routines, one which has only two moves scored for difficulty and one where the athlete is free to perform any routine. This is followed by a final routine, which is again optional (that is, the gymnast is allowed to perform whichever skills they choose). Some competitions restart the score from zero for the finals, while others add the final score to the preliminary results.\nSynchronized trampoline.\nSynchronized trampoline is similar except that both competitors must perform the routine together and marks are awarded for synchronization as well as the form and difficulty of the moves.\nDouble-mini trampoline.\nDouble mini trampoline involves a smaller trampoline with a run-up; two scoring moves are performed per routine. Moves cannot be repeated in the same order on the double-mini during a competition. Skills can be repeated if a skill is competed as a mounter in one routine and a dismount in another. The scores are marked in a similar manner to individual trampoline.\nTumbling.\nIn tumbling, athletes perform an explosive series of flips and twists down a sprung tumbling track. Scoring is similar to trampolining. Tumbling was originally contested as one of the events in Men's Artistic Gymnastics at the 1932 Summer Olympics, and in 1955 and 1959 at the Pan American Games. From 1974 to 1998 it was included as an event for both genders at the Acrobatic Gymnastics World Championships. The event has also been contested since 1976 at the Trampoline and Tumbling World Championships.\nTumbling is competed along a 25-metre sprung tack with a 10-metre run up. A tumbling pass or run is a combination of 8 skills, with an entry skill, normally a round-off, to whips (similar to a handspring without hand support) and into an end skill. Usually the end skill is the hardest skill of the pass. At the highest level, gymnasts perform transitional skills. These are skills which are not whips, but are double or triple somersaults (usually competed at the end of the run), but now competed in the middle of the run connected before and after by either a whip or a flick.\nCompetition is made up of a qualifying round and a finals round. There are two different types of competition in tumbling, individual and team. In the team event three gymnasts out of a team of four compete one run each, if one run fails the final member of the team is allowed to compete with the three highest scores being counted. In the individual event qualification, the competitor will compete two runs, one a straight pass (including double and triple somersaults) and a twisting pass (including full twisting whips and combination skills such as a full twisting double straight 'full in back'). In the final of the individual event, the competitor must compete two different runs which can be either twisting or straight but each run normally uses both types (using transition skills).\nAcrobatic gymnastics.\nAcrobatic gymnastics (formerly sport acrobatics), often referred to as acro, acrobatic sports or simply sports acro, is a group gymnastic discipline for both men and women. Acrobats perform to music in groups of two, three and four.\nThere are four international age categories: 11\u201316, 12\u201318, 13\u201319, and Senior (15+), which are used in the World Championships and many other events around the world, including the European Championships and the World Games.\nAll levels require a balance routine, which focuses on held balance skills, and a dynamic routine, which focuses on flipping elements; 12\u201318, 13\u201319, and Seniors are also required to perform a final (combined) routine.\nCurrently, acrobatic gymnastics scores are marked out of 30.00 for juniors, and they can be higher at the Senior FIG level based on difficulty:\nThere are five competitive event categories:\nThe World Championships have been held since 1974.\nAerobic gymnastics.\nAerobic gymnastics (formally sport aerobics) involves the performance of routines by individuals, pairs, trios, groups with 5 people, and aerobic dance and aerobic step (8 people). Strength, flexibility, and aerobic fitness rather than acrobatic or balance skills are emphasized. Seniors perform routines on a x floor, with a smaller x floor used for younger participants. Routines last 70\u201390 seconds depending on the age of the participants and the routine category. The World Championships have been held since 1995.\nThe events consist of:\nParkour.\nOn 28 January 2018, parkour, also known as freerunning, was given the go-ahead to begin development as a FIG sport. The FIG was planning to run World Cup competitions from 2018 onwards. The first Parkour World Championships were planned for 2020, but were delayed due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and instead took place from 15 to 16 October 2022 in Tokyo, Japan.\nThe events consist of:\nPara-gymnastics.\nPara-gymnastics, gymnastics for disabled athletes with para-athletics classifications, was recognized as a new FIG discipline in October 2024. As an FIG discipline, it currently only covers artistic gymnastics.\nOther disciplines.\nThe following disciplines are not currently recognized by the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de Gymnastique.\nAesthetic group gymnastics.\nAesthetic Group Gymnastics (AGG) was developed from the Finnish \"naisvoimistelu\". It differs from rhythmic gymnastics in that body movement is large and continuous and teams are larger, and athletes do not use apparatus in international AGG competitions. The sport requires physical qualities such as flexibility, balance, speed, strength, coordination and sense of rhythm where movements of the body are emphasized through the flow, expression and aesthetic appeal. A good performance is characterized by uniformity and simultaneity. The competition program consists of versatile and varied body movements, such as body waves, swings, balances, pivots, jumps and leaps, dance steps, and lifts. The International Federation of Aesthetic Group Gymnastics (IFAGG) was established in 2003. The first Aesthetic Group Gymnastics World Championships was held in 2000.\nTeamGym.\nTeamGym is a form of competition created by the European Union of Gymnastics, originally named EuroTeam. The first official competition was held in Finland in 1996. TeamGym events consist of three sections: women, men and mixed teams. Athletes compete in three different disciplines: floor, tumbling and trampette. Teams require effective teamwork and tumbling technique. There is no World Championships; however, there has been a European Championships held since 2010.\nWheel gymnastics.\nWheel gymnasts do exercises in a large wheel known as the Rh\u00f6nrad, gymnastics wheel, gym wheel, or German wheel. It has also been known as the ayro wheel, aero wheel, and Rhon rod.\nThere are four core categories of exercise: straight line, spiral, vault and cyr wheel. The first World Championships was held in 1995.\nMallakhamba.\nMallakhamba (Marathi: \u092e\u0932\u094d\u0932\u0916\u092e\u094d\u092c) is a traditional Indian sport in which a gymnast performs feats and poses in concert with a vertical wooden pole or rope. The word also refers to the pole used in the sport.\nMallakhamba derives from the terms \"malla\" which denotes a wrestler and \"khamba\" which means a pole. Mallakhamba can therefore be translated to English as \"pole gymnastics\". On 9 April 2013, the Indian state of Madhya Pradesh declared mallakhamba as the state sport. In February 2019 the first Mallahkhamb World Championship was held in Mumbai\nNon-competitive gymnastics.\nGeneral gymnastics, also known as \"gymnastics for all\", enables people of all ages and abilities to participate in performance groups of 6 to more than 150 athletes. Unlike other forms of gymnastics General Gymnastics is more of a sports program or performing art than a sport. Any \"event\" from any discipline of gymnastics can be performed and it's not uncommon to see for example still rings event followed by synchronized trampolone followed by step from aerobic gymnastics or even events not currently recognized in gymnastics like aerial silk. They can perform synchronized, choreographed routines. Troupes may consist of both genders and are separated into age divisions. The largest general gymnastics exhibition is the quadrennial World Gymnaestrada, which was first held in 1939. In 1984 gymnastics for all was officially recognized first as a sport program by the FIG (International Gymnastic Federation), and subsequently by national gymnastic federations worldwide with participants that now number 30 million. Non-competitive gymnastics is considered useful for its health benefits.\nScoring (code of points).\nAn artistic gymnast's score comes from deductions taken from the start value of a routine's elements. The start value of a routine is based on the difficulty of the elements the gymnast attempts and whether or not the gymnast meets composition requirements. The composition requirements are different for each apparatus. This score is called the D score. Deductions in execution and artistry are taken from a maximum of 10.0. This score is called the E score. The final score is calculated by adding the D and E score.\nThe current method of scoring, by adding D and E score to give the final score has been in place since 2006. The current method is called \"open-end\" scoring because there is no theoretical cap (although there is practical cap) to the D-score and hence the total possible score for a routine. Before 2006, a gymnast's final score is deducted from a possible maximum of 10 for a routine.\nA Code of Points or guidelines of scoring a routine's difficulty and execution is slightly revised for each quadrennium, or period of four years culminating in the Olympics year.\nFormer apparatus and events.\nRope climbing.\nGenerally, competitors climbed either a or an long, diameter natural fiber rope for speed, starting from a seated position on the floor and using only the hands and arms. Kicking the legs was normally permitted. Many gymnasts can do this in the straddle or pike position, which eliminates the help generated from the legs, though it can be done with legs as well.\nFlying rings.\nFlying rings was an event similar to still rings, but with the performer executing a series of stunts while swinging. It was a gymnastic event sanctioned by both the NCAA and the AAU until the early 1960s.\nClub swinging.\nClub swinging, a.k.a. Indian clubs, was an event in men's artistic gymnastics sometime up until the 1950s. It was similar to the clubs in both women's and men's rhythmic gymnastics, but much simpler, with few throws allowed. It was included in the 1904 and 1932 Summer Olympic Games.\nHealth and safety.\nGymnastics is one of the most dangerous sports, with a very high injury rate seen in girls age 11 to 18. \nSome gymnastic movements which were allowed in past competitions are now banned for safety reasons; for example, the Thomas salto, a twisting salto landed with a forward roll on the floor, was banned after several injuries. Elena Mukhina, the 1978 World all-around champion, broke her neck while practicing the skill in an exhausted state and became quadriplegic. The vaulting table replaced the old vaulting horse in the early 2000s and an additional mat was added around the springboard for safety reasons after several female gymnasts, such as Julissa Gomez, became paralyzed during vaulting attempts.\nLanding.\nIn a tumbling pass, dismount, or vault, landing is the final phase, following take-off and flight. This is a critical skill in terms of execution in competition scores, general performance, and injury occurrence. Without the necessary magnitude of energy dissipation during impact, the risk of sustaining injuries during somersaulting increases. These injuries commonly occur at the lower extremities such as cartilage lesions, ligament tears, and bone bruises/fractures. To avoid such injuries, and to receive a high-performance score, proper technique must be used by the gymnast. \"The subsequent ground contact or impact landing phase must be achieved using a safe, aesthetic, and well-executed double foot landing.\" A successful landing in gymnastics is classified as soft, meaning the knee and hip joints are at greater than 63 degrees of flexion.\nA higher flight phase results in a higher vertical ground reaction force. Vertical ground reaction force (vGRF) represents an external force which the gymnasts have to overcome with their muscle force and affects the gymnasts' linear and angular momentum. Another important variable that affects linear and angular momentum is the time the landing takes. Gymnasts can decrease the impact force by increasing the time taken to perform the landing. Gymnasts can achieve this by increasing hip, knee and ankle amplitude.\nPodium training.\nPodium training refers to the official practice session before a gymnastics competition begins. The purpose of this is to enable competing gymnasts to get a feel for the competition equipment inside the arena in which they will be competing, primarily for reasons of safety.\nPhysical injuries.\nCompared to athletes who play other sports, gymnasts are at higher than average risk of overuse injuries and injuries caused by early sports specialization among children and young adults. Gymnasts are at particular risk of foot and wrist injuries. Strength training can help prevent injuries.\nAbuse.\nThere have been recorded cases of emotional and sexual abuse in gymnastics in many different countries. The USA Gymnastics sex abuse scandal is considered one of the largest abuse scandals in sports history. In 2022, the Whyte Review was published, criticizing extensive abusive practices by British Gymnastics that included sexual and emotional abuse and excessive weight management of athletes.\nHeight concerns.\nGymnasts tend to have short stature, but it is unlikely that the sport affects their growth. Parents of gymnasts tend also to be shorter than average.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It was the only modern species in the genus Pinguinus. It was not closely related to the penguins of the Southern Hemisphere, which were named for their resemblance to this species.\nIt bred on rocky, remote islands with easy access to the ocean and a plentiful food supply, a rarity in nature that provided only a few breeding sites for the great auks. During the non-breeding season, the auk foraged in the waters of the North Atlantic, ranging as far south as northern Spain and along the coastlines of Canada, Greenland, Iceland, the Faroe Islands, Norway, Ireland, and Great Britain.\nThe bird was about tall and weighed about , making it the largest alcid to survive into the modern era, and the second-largest member of the alcid family overall (the prehistoric \"Miomancalla\" was larger). It had a black back and a white belly. The black beak was heavy and hooked, with grooves on its surface. During summer, great auk plumage showed a white patch over each eye. During winter, the great auk lost these patches, instead developing a white band stretching between the eyes. The wings were only long, rendering the bird flightless. Instead, the great auk was a powerful swimmer, a trait that it used in hunting. Its favourite prey were fish, including Atlantic menhaden and capelin, and crustaceans. Although agile in the water, it was clumsy on land. Great auk pairs mated for life. They nested in extremely dense and social colonies, laying one egg on bare rock. The egg was white with variable brown marbling. Both parents participated in the incubation of the egg for around six weeks before the young hatched. The young left the nest site after two to three weeks, although the parents continued to care for it.\nThe great auk was an important part of many Native American cultures, both as a food source and as a symbolic item. Many Maritime Archaic people were buried with great auk bones. One burial discovered included someone covered by more than 200 great auk beaks, which are presumed to be the remnants of a cloak made of great auks' skins. Early European explorers to the Americas used the great auk as a convenient food source or as fishing bait, reducing its numbers. The bird's down was in high demand in Europe, a factor that largely eliminated the European populations by the mid-16th century. Around the same time, nations such as Great Britain began to realize that the great auk was disappearing and it became the beneficiary of many early environmental laws, but despite that the great auk were still hunted.\nIts growing rarity increased interest from European museums and private collectors in obtaining skins and eggs of the bird. On 3 June 1844, the last two confirmed specimens were killed on Eldey, off the coast of Iceland, ending the last known breeding attempt. Later reports of roaming individuals being seen or caught are unconfirmed. A report of one great auk in 1852 is considered by some to be the last sighting of a member of the species. The great auk is mentioned in several novels, and the scientific journal of the American Ornithological Society was named \"The Auk\" (now \"Ornithology\") in honour of the bird until 2021.\nTaxonomy and evolution.\nAnalysis of mtDNA sequences has confirmed morphological and biogeographical studies suggesting that the razorbill is the closest living relative of the great auk. The great auk also was related closely to the little auk or dovekie, which underwent a radically different evolution compared to \"Pinguinus\". Due to its outward similarity to the razorbill (apart from flightlessness and size), the great auk often was placed in the genus \"Alca\", following Linnaeus.\nThe oldest known fossil records of the modern great auk are from the Boxgrove Palaeolithic site of England and Lower Town Hill Formation of Bermuda, both of which are dated to the Middle Pleistocene at least 400,000 years BP. The Pliocene sister species, \"Pinguinus alfrednewtoni\", and molecular evidence show that the three closely related genera diverged soon after their common ancestor, a bird probably similar to a stout Xantus's murrelet, had spread to the coasts of the Atlantic. Apparently, by that time, the murres, or Atlantic guillemots, already had split from the other Atlantic alcids. Razorbill-like birds were common in the Atlantic during the Pliocene, but the evolution of the little auk is sparsely documented. The molecular data are compatible with either possibility, but the weight of evidence suggests placing the great auk in a distinct genus. Some ornithologists still believe it is more appropriate to retain the species in the genus \"Alca\". It is the only recorded British bird made extinct in historic times.\nThe following cladogram shows the placement of the great auk among its closest relatives, based on a 2004 genetic study:\n\"Pinguinus alfrednewtoni\" was a larger, and also flightless, member of the genus \"Pinguinus\" that lived during the Early Pliocene. Known from bones found in the Yorktown Formation of the Lee Creek Mine in North Carolina, it is believed to have split, along with the great auk, from a common ancestor. \"Pinguinus alfrednewtoni\" lived in the western Atlantic, while the great auk lived in the eastern Atlantic. After the former died out following the Pliocene, the great auk took over its territory. The great auk was not related closely to the other extinct genera of flightless alcids, \"Mancalla\", \"Praemancalla\", and \"Alcodes\".\nEtymology.\nThe great auk was one of the 4,400 animal species formally described by Carl Linnaeus in his eighteenth-century work \"Systema Naturae\", in which it was given the binomial \"Alca impennis\". The name \"Alca\" is a Latin derivative of the Scandinavian word for razorbills and their relatives. The bird was known in literature even before this and was described by Charles d'Ecluse in 1605 as \"Mergus Americanus.\" This also included a woodcut which represents the oldest unambiguous visual depictions of the bird.\nThe species was not placed in its own scientific genus, \"Pinguinus\", until 1791. The generic name is derived from the Spanish, Portuguese and French name for the species, in turn from Latin meaning \"plump\", and the specific name, \"impennis\", is from Latin and refers to the lack of flight feathers, or \"pennae\".\nThe Irish name for the great auk is , meaning \"big seabird/auk\". The Basque name is ', meaning \"spearbill\". Its early French name was \"apponatz\", while modern French uses '. The Norse called the great auk \"geirfugl\", which means \"spearbird\". This has led to an alternative English common name for the bird, \"garefowl\" or \"gairfowl\".333 The Inuit name for the great auk was \"isarukitsok\", which meant \"little wing\".314\nThe word \"penguin\" first appears in the sixteenth century as a synonym for \"great auk\". Although the etymology is debated, the generic name \"penguin\" may be derived from the Welsh \"pen gwyn\" \"white head\", either because the birds lived in New Brunswick on White Head Island (Pen Gwyn in Welsh) or because the great auk had such large white circles on its head. When European explorers discovered what today are known as penguins in the Southern Hemisphere, they noticed their similar appearance to the great auk and named them after this bird, although biologically, they are not closely related.10 Whalers also lumped the northern and southern birds together under the common name \"woggins\".\nDescription.\nStanding about tall and weighing approximately as adult birds, the flightless great auk was the second-largest member of both its family and the order Charadriiformes overall, surpassed only by the mancalline \"Miomancalla\". It is, however, the largest species to survive into modern times. The great auks that lived farther north averaged larger in size than the more southerly members of the species. Males and females were similar in plumage, although there is evidence for differences in size, particularly in the bill and femur length.8 The back was primarily a glossy black, and the belly was white. The neck and legs were short, and the head and wings small. During summer, it developed a wide white eye patch over each eye, which had a hazel or chestnut iris.310 Auks are known for their close resemblance to penguins, their webbed feet and countershading are a result of convergent evolution in the water. During winter the great auk moulted and lost this eye patch, which was replaced with a wide white band and a grey line of feathers that stretched from the eye to the ear.8 During the summer, its chin and throat were blackish-brown and the inside of the mouth was yellow. In winter, the throat became white.8 Some individuals reportedly had grey plumage on their flanks, but the purpose, seasonal duration, and frequency of this variation is unknown. The bill was large at long and curved downward at the top;28 the bill also had deep white grooves in both the upper and lower mandibles, up to seven on the upper mandible and twelve on the lower mandible in summer, although there were fewer in winter.29 The wings were only in length and the longest wing feathers were only long.28 Its feet and short claws were black, while the webbed skin between the toes was brownish black. The legs were far back on the bird's body, which gave it powerful swimming and diving abilities.312\nHatchlings were described as grey and downy, but their exact appearance is unknown, since no skins exist today. Juvenile birds had fewer prominent grooves in their beaks than adults and they had mottled white and black necks, while the eye spot found in adults was not present; instead, a grey line ran through the eyes (which still had white eye rings) to just below the ears.\nGreat Auk calls included low croaking and a hoarse scream. A captive great auk was observed making a gurgling noise when anxious. It is not known what its other vocalizations were, but it is believed that they were similar to those of the razorbill, only louder and deeper.\nDistribution and habitat.\nThe great auk was found in the cold North Atlantic coastal waters along the coasts of Canada, the northeastern United States, Norway, Greenland, Iceland, the Faroe Islands, Ireland, Great Britain, France, and the Iberian Peninsula.5 Pleistocene fossils indicate the great auk also inhabited Southern France, Italy, and other coasts of the Mediterranean basin.314 It was common on the Grand Banks of Newfoundland. In recorded history, the great auk typically did not go farther south than Massachusetts Bay in the winter. Great auk bones have been found as far south as Florida, where it may have been present during four periods: approximately 1000 BC and 1000 AD, as well as during the fifteenth century and the seventeenth century. It has been suggested that some of the bones discovered in Florida may be the result of aboriginal trading. In the eastern Atlantic, the southernmost records of this species are two isolated bones, one from Madeira and another from the Neolithic site of El Harhoura 2 in Morocco.\nThe great auk left the North Atlantic waters for land only to breed, even roosting at sea when not breeding.29 The rookeries of the great auk were found from Baffin Bay to the Gulf of St. Lawrence, across the far northern Atlantic, including Iceland, and in Norway and the British Isles in Europe. For their nesting colonies the great auks required rocky islands with sloping shorelines that provided access to the sea. These were very limiting requirements and it is believed that the great auk never had more than 20 breeding colonies.312 The nesting sites also needed to be close to rich feeding areas and to be far enough from the mainland to discourage visitation by predators such as humans and polar bears. The localities of only seven former breeding colonies are known: Papa Westray in the Orkney Islands, St. Kilda off Scotland, Grimsey Island, Eldey Island, Geirfuglasker near Iceland, Funk Island near Newfoundland, and the Bird Rocks (Rochers-aux-Oiseaux) in the Gulf of St. Lawrence. Records suggest that this species may have bred on Cape Cod in Massachusetts.312 By the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, the breeding range of the great auk was restricted to Funk Island, Grimsey Island, Eldey Island, the Gulf of St. Lawrence, and the St. Kilda islands.30 Funk Island was the largest known breeding colony. After the chicks fledged, the great auk migrated north and south away from the breeding colonies and they tended to go southward during late autumn and winter.\nEcology and behaviour.\nThe great auk was never observed and described by modern scientists during its existence and is only known from the accounts of laymen, such as sailors, so its behaviour is not well known and difficult to reconstruct. Much may be inferred from its close, living relative, the razorbill, as well as from remaining soft tissue.\nGreat auks walked slowly and sometimes used their wings to help them traverse rough terrain. When they did run, it was awkwardly and with short steps in a straight line. They had few natural predators, mainly large marine mammals, such as the orca, and white-tailed eagles. Polar bears preyed on nesting colonies of the great auk.35 Based on observations by the Naturalist Otto Fabricius (the only scientist to make primary observations on the great auk), some auks were \"stupid and tame\" whilst others were difficult to approach which he suggested was related to the bird's age. Humans preyed upon them as food, for feathers, and as specimens for museums and private collections. Great auks reacted to noises, but were rarely frightened by the sight of something.315 They used their bills aggressively both in the dense nesting sites and when threatened or captured by humans. These birds are believed to have had a life span of approximately 20 to 25 years.313 During the winter, the great auk migrated south, either in pairs or in small groups, but never with the entire nesting colony.32\nThe great auk was generally an excellent swimmer, using its wings to propel itself underwater. While swimming, the head was held up but the neck was drawn in. This species was capable of banking, veering, and turning underwater.32 The great auk was known to dive to depths of and it has been claimed that the species was able to dive to depths of .311 To conserve energy, most dives were shallow. It also could hold its breath for 15 minutes, longer than a seal. Its ability to dive so deeply reduced competition with other alcid species. The great auk was capable of accelerating underwater, then shooting out of the water to land on a rocky ledge above the ocean's surface.32\nDiet.\nThis alcid typically fed in shoaling waters that were shallower than those frequented by other alcids, although after the breeding season, they had been sighted as far as from land. They are believed to have fed cooperatively in flocks. Their main food was fish, usually in length and weighing , but occasionally their prey was up to half the bird's own length. Based on remains associated with great auk bones found on Funk Island and on ecological and morphological considerations, it seems that Atlantic menhaden and capelin were their favoured prey. Other fish suggested as potential prey include lumpsuckers, shorthorn sculpins, cod, sand lance, as well as crustaceans.311 The young of the great auk are believed to have eaten plankton and, possibly, fish and crustaceans regurgitated by adults.313\nReproduction.\nHistorical descriptions of the great auk breeding behaviour are somewhat unreliable. Great Auks began pairing in early and mid-May. They are believed to have mated for life (although some theorize that great auks could have mated outside their pair, a trait seen in the razorbill).313 Once paired, they nested at the base of cliffs in colonies, likely where they copulated.28 Mated pairs had a social display in which they bobbed their heads and displayed their white eye patch, bill markings, and yellow mouth. These colonies were extremely crowded and dense, with some estimates stating that there was a nesting great auk for every of land. These colonies were very social. When the colonies included other species of alcid, the great auks were dominant due to their size.\nFemale great auks would lay only one egg each year, between late May and early June, although they could lay a replacement egg if the first one was lost.32 In years when there was a shortage of food, the great auks did not breed. A single egg was laid on bare ground up to from shore.33 The egg was ovate and elongate in shape, and it averaged in length and across at the widest point.35 The egg was yellowish white to light ochre with a varying pattern of black, brown, or greyish spots and lines that often were congregated on the large end. It is believed that the variation in the egg streaks enabled the parents to recognize their egg among those in the vast colony. The pair took turns incubating the egg in an upright position for the 39 to 44 days before the egg hatched, typically in June, although eggs could be present at the colonies as late as August.35\nThe parents also took turns feeding their chick. According to one account, the chick was covered with grey down.313 The young bird took only two or three weeks to mature enough to abandon the nest and land for the water, typically around the middle of July.35 The parents cared for their young after they fledged, and adults would be seen swimming with their young perched on their backs. Great auks matured sexually when they were four to seven years old.\nRelationship with humans.\nThe great auk was a food source for Neanderthals more than 100,000 years ago, as evidenced by well-cleaned bones found by their campfires. Images believed to depict the great auk also were carved into the walls of the El Pendo Cave in Camargo, Spain, and Paglicci, Italy, more than 35,000 years ago, and cave paintings 20,000 years old have been found in France's Grotte Cosquer.314\nNative Americans valued the great auk as a food source during the winter and as an important cultural symbol. Images of the great auk have been found in bone necklaces.36 A person buried at the Maritime Archaic site at Port au Choix, Newfoundland, dating to about 2000 BC, was found surrounded by more than 200 great auk beaks, which are believed to have been part of a suit made from their skins, with the heads left attached as decoration. Nearly half of the bird bones found in graves at this site were of the great auk, suggesting that it had great cultural significance for the Maritime Archaic people. The extinct Beothuks of Newfoundland made pudding out of the eggs of the great auk.313 The Dorset Eskimos also hunted it. The Saqqaq in Greenland overhunted the species, causing a local reduction in range.\nLater, European sailors used the great auks as a navigational beacon, as the presence of these birds signalled that the Grand Banks of Newfoundland were near.314\nThis species is estimated to have had a maximum population in the millions.313 The great auk was hunted on a significant scale for food, eggs, and its down feathers from at least the eighth century. Prior to that, hunting by local natives may be documented from Late Stone Age Scandinavia and eastern North America, as well as from early fifth century Labrador, where the bird seems to have occurred only as stragglers. Early explorers, including Jacques Cartier, and numerous ships attempting to find gold on Baffin Island were not provisioned with food for the journey home, and therefore, used great auks as both a convenient food source and bait for fishing. Reportedly, some of the later vessels anchored next to a colony and ran out planks to the land. The sailors then herded hundreds of great auks onto the ships, where they were slaughtered. Some authors have questioned the reports of this hunting method and whether it was successful. Great auk eggs were also a valued food source, as the eggs were three times the size of a murre's and had a large yolk. These sailors also introduced rats onto the islands which preyed upon nests.\nExtinction.\nThe Little Ice Age may have reduced the population of the great auk by exposing more of their breeding islands to predation by polar bears, but massive exploitation by humans for their down drastically reduced the population, with recent evidence indicating the latter alone is likely the primary driver of its extinction. By the mid-sixteenth century, the nesting colonies along the European side of the Atlantic were nearly all eliminated by humans killing this bird for its down, which was used to make pillows.40 In 1553, the great auk received its first official protection. In 1794, Great Britain banned the killing of this species for its feathers.330 In St. John's, those violating a 1775 law banning hunting the great auk for its feathers or eggs were publicly flogged, though hunting for use as fishing bait was still permitted. On the North American side, eider down initially was preferred, but once the eiders were nearly driven to extinction in the 1770s, down collectors switched to the great auk at the same time that hunting for food, fishing bait, and oil decreased.329\nThe great auk had disappeared from Funk Island by 1800. An account by Aaron Thomas of HMS \"Boston\" from 1794 described how the bird had been slaughtered systematically until then:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nWith its increasing rarity, specimens of the great auk and its eggs became collectible and highly prized by rich Europeans, and the loss of a large number of its eggs to collection contributed to the demise of the species. Eggers, individuals who visited the nesting sites of the great auk to collect their eggs, quickly realized that the birds did not all lay their eggs on the same day, so they could make return visits to the same breeding colony. Eggers only collected the eggs without embryos and typically, discarded the eggs with embryos growing inside them.35\nOn the islet of Stac an Armin, St. Kilda, Scotland, in July 1840, the last great auk seen in Britain was caught and killed. Three men from St. Kilda caught a single \"garefowl\", noticing its little wings and the large white spot on its head. They tied it up and kept it alive for three days, until a large storm arose. Believing that the bird was a witch and was causing the storm, they then killed it by beating it with a stick.\nThe last colony of great auks lived on Geirfuglasker (the \"Great Auk Rock\") off Iceland. This islet was a volcanic rock surrounded by cliffs that made it inaccessible to humans, but in 1830, the islet submerged after a volcanic eruption, and the birds moved to the nearby island of Eldey, which was accessible from a single side. When the colony was discovered in 1835, nearly fifty birds were present. Museums, desiring the skins of the great auk for preservation and display, quickly began collecting birds from the colony.43 The last pair, found incubating an egg, was killed there on 3 June 1844, on request from a merchant who wanted specimens.\nJ\u00f3n Brandsson and Sigur\u00f0ur \u00cdsleifsson, the men who had killed the last birds, were interviewed by great auk specialist John Wolley, and Sigur\u00f0ur described the act as follows:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nA later claim of a live individual sighted in 1852 on the Grand Banks of Newfoundland has been accepted by the International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources. \nAlleged sightings of the auk continued for decades after it was believed extinct. The last alleged sighting occurred in the Lofotens in 1927. Errol Fuller noted that several of the later sightings were hoaxes or misidentifications of penguins that had been released near Norway.\nThere is an ongoing discussion about the possibilities for reviving the great auk using its DNA from specimens collected. This possibility is controversial.\nPreserved specimens.\nToday, 78 skins of the great auk remain, mostly in museum collections, along with approximately 75 eggs and 24 complete skeletons. All but four of the surviving skins are in summer plumage, and only two of these are immature. No hatchling specimens exist. Each egg and skin has been assigned a number by specialists. Although thousands of isolated bones were collected from nineteenth century Funk Island to Neolithic middens, only a few complete skeletons exist. Natural mummies also are known from Funk Island, and the eyes and internal organs of the last two birds from 1844 are stored in the Zoological Museum, Copenhagen. The whereabouts of the skins from the last two individuals has been unknown for over 180 years, but that mystery has been fully resolved using DNA extracted from the organs of the last individuals and the skins of the candidate specimens suggested by Errol Fuller (those in \u00dcbersee-Museum Bremen, Royal Belgian Institute of Natural Sciences, Zoological Museum of Kiel University, Los Angeles County Museum of Natural History, and Landesmuseum Natur und Mensch Oldenburg) and the specimen in Cincinnati Museum of Natural History and Science. In 2017, a positive match was found between the organs from the male individual and the skin now in the Royal Belgian Institute of Natural Sciences in Brussels; no match was found between the female organs and a specimen from Fuller's list at the time, but authors speculated that the skin in Cincinnati Museum of Natural History and Science may be a potential candidate due to a common history with the Los Angeles specimen. In 2025, a positive match was found between the female organs and the skin in the Cincinnati Museum of Natural History and Science, confirming that the specimen was indeed that of the last female.\nFollowing the bird's extinction, remains of the great auk increased dramatically in value, and auctions of specimens created intense interest in Victorian Britain, where 15 specimens are now located, the largest number of any country. A specimen was bought in 1971 by the Icelandic Museum of National History for \u00a39000, which placed it in the Guinness Book of Records as the most expensive stuffed bird ever sold. The price of its eggs sometimes reached up to 11 times the amount earned by a skilled worker in a year.331 The present whereabouts of six of the eggs are unknown. Several other eggs have been destroyed accidentally. Two mounted skins were destroyed in the twentieth century, one in the Mainz Museum during the Second World War, and one in the Museu Bocage, Lisbon that was destroyed by a fire in 1978.\nCultural depictions.\nChildren's books.\nCharles Kingsley's \"The Water-Babies: A Fairy Tale for a Land-Baby\" (1863) features the last great auk (referred to in the book as a \"gairfowl\") telling the tale of the demise of her species. Different illustrations of the auk are included in the original 1863 version, the 1889 version illustrated by Linley Sambourne, 1916 by Frank A. Nankivell, and 1916 by Jessie Willcox Smith. Kingsley's auk implicates the \"nasty fellows\" who \"shot us so, and knocked us on the head, and took our eggs.\" While Kingsley portrays the extinction as sad, he provides his opinion that \"there are better things come in her place,\" namely human colonization of the islands for the cod fishing industry, which would serve to feed the poor. He concludes the discussion with a quote from Tennyson: \"The old order changeth, giving place to the new; And God fulfils Himself in many ways.\"\nEnid Blyton's \"The Island of Adventure\" (1944) sends one of the protagonists on a failed search for what he believes is a lost colony of the species.\nLiterature and journalism.\nThe great auk is also present in a wide variety of other works of fiction.\nIn the short story \"The Harbor-Master\" by Robert W. Chambers, the discovery and attempted recovery of the last known pair of great auks is central to the plot (which also involves a proto-Lovecraftian element of suspense). The story first appeared in \"Ainslee's Magazine\" (August 1898) and was slightly revised to become the first five chapters of Chambers' episodic novel \"In Search of the Unknown\", (Harper and Brothers Publishers, New York, 1904).\n\"Penguin Island\", a 1908 French satirical novel by the Nobel Prize winning author Anatole France, narrates the fictional history of a great auk population that is mistakenly baptized by a nearsighted missionary.\nIn his novel \"Ulysses\" (1922), James Joyce mentions the bird while the novel's main character is drifting into sleep. He associates the great auk with the mythical roc as a method of formally returning the main character to a sleepy land of fantasy and memory.\nW. S. Merwin mentions the great auk in a short litany of extinct animals in his poem \"For a Coming Extinction\", one of the poems from his 1967 collection, \"The Lice\".\n\"Night of the Auk\", a 1956 Broadway drama by Arch Oboler, depicts a group of astronauts returning from the Moon to discover that a full-blown nuclear war has broken out. Obeler draws a parallel between the anthropogenic extinction of the great auk and of the story's nuclear extinction of humankind.\nA great auk is collected by fictional naturalist Stephen Maturin in the Patrick O'Brian historical novel \"The Surgeon's Mate\" (1980). This work also details the harvesting of a colony of auks.\nFarley Mowat devotes the first section, \"Spearbill\", of his book \"Sea of Slaughter\" (1984) to the history of the great auk.\nElizabeth Kolbert's Pulitzer Prize-winning book, \"\" (2014), includes a chapter on the great auk.\nPerforming arts.\nThe great auk is the subject of a ballet, \"Still Life at the Penguin Caf\u00e9\" (1988), and a song, \"A Dream Too Far\", in the ecological musical \"Rockford's Rock Opera\" (2010).\nMascots.\nThe great auk is the mascot of the Archmere Academy in Claymont, Delaware, and the Adelaide University Choral Society (AUCS) in Australia.\nThe great auk was formerly the mascot of the Lindsay Frost campus of Sir Sandford Fleming College in Ontario. In 2012, the two separate sports programs of Fleming College were combined and the great auk mascot went extinct. The Lindsay Frost campus student owned bar, student centre, and lounge is still known as the Auk's Lodge.\nIt was also the mascot of the now ended Knowledge Masters educational competition.\nNames.\nThe scientific journal of the American Ornithologists' Union, \"Ornithology\", was named \"The Auk\" until 2021 in honour of this bird.\nAccording to Homer Hickam's memoir, \"Rocket Boys\", and its film production, \"October Sky\", the early rockets he and his friends built, were named \"Auk\".\nA cigarette company, the British Great Auk Cigarettes, was named after this bird.\nFine arts.\nWalton Ford, the American painter, has featured great auks in two paintings: \"The Witch of St. Kilda\" and \"Funk Island\". Replica skins and eggs were made and sold in the 1920s for collectors.\nThe English painter and writer Errol Fuller produced \"Last Stand\" for his monograph on the species.\nThe great auk also appeared on one stamp in a set of five depicting extinct birds issued by Cuba in 1974.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "12553", "revid": "22619", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=12553", "title": "Glorantha", "text": "Fantasy world created by Greg Stafford\nGlorantha is a fantasy world created by Greg Stafford.\nOverview.\nGlorantha was first introduced in the board game \"White Bear and Red Moon\" (1975) by Chaosium, and then in a number of other board, roleplaying and computer games, including \"RuneQuest\" and \"HeroQuest\". It was also used in several works of fiction and the computer strategy game \"King of Dragon Pass\". The Gloranthan world is characterised by its complex use of mythology, heavily influenced by the universalist approaches of Joseph Campbell and Mircea Eliade, its sword and sorcery ethos, its long and distinctive history as a setting for role-playing games, its community development and expansion, and its relative lack of Tolkienesque influence, which is uncommon among early American fantasy role-playing games.\nStafford first wrote about in Glorantha in 1966 as a way to deepen his own understanding of mythology. He founded the company Chaosium to publish the board wargame \"White Bear and Red Moon\" in 1975, which was set in Glorantha. Chaosium later published other games in the setting, including the critically acclaimed \"RuneQuest\". Various later editions of \"RuneQuest\", the narrative role-playing game \"HeroQuest\" (the first edition of which was published as \"Hero Wars\"), and the video game \"King of Dragon Pass\" were also set in Glorantha, as were several prominent fan efforts. Stafford has also explored the Gloranthan setting in the fantasy novel \"King of Sartar\" and a number of unfinished works published under the collective name of \"the Stafford Library\".\nIn Glorantha, magic operates from the everyday level of prayers and charms to the creation and maintenance of the world. Heroes make their way in the world, and may also venture into metaphysical realms to gain knowledge and power, at the risk of body and soul. In the more recent material, competing magical outlooks (such as theism, shamanism and mysticism) exist to explain the world. Within each metaphysical system, adherents may also compete, such as when theistic worshipers of rival gods battle each other. The world is flat, with a dome-like sky, and it has been shaped in large and small ways by the mythic actions of the gods. The 'historical' world of Glorantha is in a more or less fallen state, having recovered only partially from a universal battle against Chaos in the mythic Godtime.\nHumans are the dominant race, but other sentient beings abound. Some, such as the mystic dragonewts, are unique to Glorantha. Familiar nonhuman races, such as elves and dwarves, are distinct from their common, Tolkienesque portrayals.\nHistory of the Gloranthan game world.\nEarly development (1960s\u20131970s).\nGlorantha's origins lie in experiments with mythology, storytelling, recreation, and the blending of ancient societies. It is unlike its contemporary, \"Dungeons &amp; Dragons\" which has its roots in wargaming.\nStafford's first imaginings of Glorantha date back to 1966, when he began his studies at Beloit College, as a vehicle for him to deepen his own understanding of mythology by creating his own mythology. Stafford was greatly influenced by the ideas on the mythology of Joseph Campbell, and echoes of Campbell's work are to be found in many aspects of Glorantha; for instance, the story of the \"God Learners\" can be seen as an exercise on the implications of Campbell's idea of a unifying monomyth, and the story of Prince Argrath an exploration of Campbell's \"The Hero with a Thousand Faces\" (1949). More abstractly, Campbell's idea that myths are how we shape our lives deeply informs the picture of life in Glorantha throughout the game world's publication history.\nThe first game set in Glorantha was the board game \"White Bear and Red Moon\". The game details a time of constant war between the land of Sartar and the Lunar Empire during the reign of Argrath Dragontooth. Its board details an area called Dragon Pass, while the rulebook provides details of the warring factions, their lands, and leaders. In addition, it provides a large-scale map titled the Greater Lunar Empire, showing a larger world in which Dragon Pass is placed. The \"White Bear and Red Moon\" does not disclose the name of the world.\n\"Nomad Gods\", a second board game, published by Chaosium in 1978, and based on the raids and wars between the beast-riding, spirit-worshiping tribes of Prax, a cursed land located east of Dragon Pass. It also did not mention the world by name.\nIn 1978, after the publication of \"Nomad Gods\", and prior to the publication of \"RuneQuest\", the name Glorantha appeared in print for the first time. \"Wyrm's Footnotes\" #4 contained three articles on Glorantha and a map of the world itself.\nIn role-playing games (late 1970s \u2013 1990s).\nThe first edition of the role-playing game \"RuneQuest\" was released in 1978. Here, the world was referred to as \"Glorontha\". Several later editions were made; the second edition (\"RuneQuest 2\") in 1979 introduced many sophisticated game aids, such as \"Cults of Prax\" and \"Cults of Terror\", and polished campaign packs such as \"Griffin Mountain\". Using materials such as \"Cults of Prax\", players aligned their characters with any of a number of religions, grounding those characters in the political, cultural, and metaphysical conflicts of the setting. Each religion offered a distinct worldview and cultural outlook, none of which was considered objectively correct out-of-character. This approach of offering competing mythical histories and value systems continues in current Glorantha material. \"Cults of Terror\" focused on the worship of evil gods and adversaries, such as Vivamort, a vampire cult, and Lunar and Chaos cults.\nIn 1993, Stafford published his first major expansion of Gloranthan mythology, the novel \"King of Sartar\". This was a departure from previous Gloranthan material, which had all been targeted at a tabletop role-playing game audience.\nIn an attempt to leverage the power of a much bigger gaming company, a third edition of \"RuneQuest\", was published with Avalon Hill in 1984. The default setting for this edition was given as the \"Dark Ages of fantasy Europe\", but it also included a booklet allowing use in Glorantha. Later supplements such as \"Gods of Glorantha\" expanded religious aspects, while \"\" did the same for culture and geography.\nIn the mid-1990s, Avalon Hill began work on a fourth edition of \"RuneQuest\", subtitled \"Adventures in Glorantha\". Stafford did not approve of the project and it was canceled. \"RuneQuest\" did not prosper by its association with Avalon Hill, and the relationship between Chaosium, who held the rights to Glorantha, and Avalon Hill, who held the rights to \"RuneQuest\", broke down completely in 1995. Following the break with Chaosium, Avalon Hill began to assert their trademark to the RuneQuest name, began work on \"\". This was unrelated to Glorantha and the third edition rules. The project was canceled just before printing in 1998.\nDuring this period of breakdown, Glorantha continued to evolve. The advent of the Internet caused a boom in fan creations for Glorantha. This was supported by several unofficial business ventures, such as Reaching Moon Megacorp, and a lively convention scene. Loren Miller proposed his Maximum Game Fun principle as a basis for gaming in Glorantha; this soon became a game system in its own right. David Dunham proposed his \"PenDragon Pass\" system, a nearly freeform game system, and several ambitious freeform games were played at conventions. One such game, \"Home of the Bold\", hosted up to eighty participants.\nThe video game \"King of Dragon Pass\" was released by A Sharp in 1999. The player assumes the role of an Orlanthi hero who seeks to unite the clans and tribes of Dragon Pass into a single kingdom. The game features exceptional depth of coverage of the area of Dragon Pass, and featured the first compelling public view of Stafford's ideas about the hero's quest. Stafford was also self publishing additional material at this time about the history and mythology of Glorantha in non-game form in \"The Glorious (Re)Ascent of Yelm\".\n21st century.\nIn 2000, Issaries, Inc. published \"Hero Wars\", a new Gloranthan role-playing game unrelated to \"RuneQuest\". Its next iteration in 2003 was named \"HeroQuest\" and later in 2008, Moon Design Publications published an updated second edition. 2016 saw Moon Design publish \"HeroQuest Glorantha\", completely integrating Glorantha into the rules. 2006 saw \"RuneQuest\" licensed from Issaries by Mongoose Publishing with a second edition in 2010. In 2012, The Design Mechanism published the sixth edition of RuneQuest, with no Gloranthan content. Glorantha returned in 2018 with Chaosium publishing \"RuneQuest - Roleplaying in Glorantha\".\n\"Hero Wars\" and \"HeroQuest\".\nThe \"HeroQuest\" game system, written by Robin Laws in collaboration with Greg Stafford, is a complete departure from \"RuneQuest\". The former leverages quick contests and open, almost free-form style of skills and abilities to emulate a mythic structure of play, with rising and falling tensions that contrast with the more naturalistic focus taken by \"RuneQuest\". Owing to this approach, some \"RuneQuest\" fans found it difficult to adjust to \"HeroQuest\". A rewritten second edition was published in Spring 2009 by Moon Design Publications. It was supported with comprehensive Gloranthan sourcebooks \"Sartar: Kingdom of Heroes\" (2009), \"Sartar Companion\" (2010) and \"Pavis: Gateway to Adventure\" (2012).\n\"RuneQuest\".\nIn 2006, \"RuneQuest\" was licensed to Mongoose Publishing by Issaries. Their new edition of the rules, were not set in Glorantha, and required a further supplemement, \"Glorantha \u2013 The Second Age\" to play. Written by Robin Laws, it was set in the Second Age of Gloratha's history against the backdrop of The God Learner empire and the Empire of Wyrm's Friends. In this edition, Mongoose produced 17 supplements and adventures based in Glorantha, alongside their generic fantasy background.\nA second edition \"Mongoose RuneQuest II\" was published in January 2010, but Mongoose Publishing's licence for Gloranthan material lapsed in May 2011. The \"RuneQuest II\" game system has been retitled \"Legend\", and contains no Gloranthan material. A new company, The Design Mechanism, was formed by the authors of \"RuneQuest II\", and ownership of the Gloranthan supplements produced for the \"RuneQuest II\" line was transferred to them (PDF versions continued to be sold). There are close links between The Design Mechanism and Moon Design Publications, with The Design Mechanism founders writing material for both companies. Their new edition of the \"RuneQuest\" rules, \"RuneQuest: Sixth Edition\", did not have a Gloranthan setting.\nIn 2018 Chaosium published \"RuneQuest - Roleplaying in Glorantha\". Wholly set in Glorantha, it advanced the in-game date to 1625, and focuses once again on Dragon Pass. Along with its two slipcase companions, it provides a complete overview of this region. Again the village of Apple Lane in the homeland of Sartar is used as a starting adventure setting, but updated to the year 1625. Two further supplements concentrate on specific areas within Dragon Pass.\nThe World of Glorantha.\nThe Glorantha website introduces Glorantha as follows:\nGlorantha is an action-packed world of adventure. Gods and Goddesses struggle here, with nations of people nothing but their pawns. The stormy barbarians with their brutal but honest Storm God struggle against the Lunar Empire, led by the imperial Sun God and devious Moon Goddess.\nGlorantha is an exciting world of heroes. Legends are being made by great individuals, many who are not even human beings. Some work with the deities, other heroes and heroines fight against them.\nGlorantha is colorful and full of magic. Supernatural animals are found, ranging from unicorns to seven types of merfolk and the Goddess of Lions.\nGlorantha is immense. If explored, it has different worlds and dimensions, whole realms where Gods, spirits and sorcerous powers come from. Unlike many fantasy settings, Glorantha emphasises religion, myth and belief to a level rarely seen in role-playing or fantasy fiction elsewhere.\nGlorantha shares some fantasy tropes such as dwarves, elves, trolls, giants, but has developed them differently to the more conventional versions based on the work of Tolkien. Dwarves are literally made of stone and exist as manifest rigid inflexible laws of creation, while elves are intelligent, mobile plants. Glorantha is full of surprises.\nGlorantha is as deep as you want it to be, or not. Hackers and choppers have what they want, while scholars and mythologists have a vast playground of new stories, legends and myths to enjoy.\nIt has various cultures analogous to Earth spread over two major landmasses and a wide archipelago. The northern continent of Genertela has a caste society of roughly Vedic type to the west, an autocratic Oriental society to the east and a classical-style Bronze Age culture in the center. The southern continent of Pamaltela is analogous to Africa.\nCreatures of Glorantha.\nBroos are creatures of chaos. As they can successfully mate with anything, they have the body of a man and features of their animal parent, often deer, goats, antelope, cattle, and sheep. The animal parent normally dies when the child eats its way out of the host at full gestation. They worship Malia, the Mother of Disease, and Thed, the goddess of rape and mother of Chaos.\nScorpionmen are belligerent and resemble scorpion-human centaur. They are stupid, vicious and live in violent matriarchies with a religious emphasis on devouring. They are chaotic in nature.\nDucks or \"Durulz\" are flightless humanoid duck-like creatures who have arms rather than wings (or men cursed with feathers and webbed feet). They have unknown ancestry and may descend from cursed humans or cursed ducks. They reside around rivers, mainly in Sartar, and have an unexplained mystical affinity with Death.\nAldryami or Gloranthan elves, are plant people. They worship nature and the sun and Aldrya, deity of plants, specifically. In contrast to Tolkienesque elves, they are alien, physically plant-like and unfriendly to \"meat men\" (humans). Like many other fantasy fictional elf races, they are excellent archers.\nMostali are machine-like dwarves. They are xenophobic, orthodox and insular. They have invented iron, which has many extraordinary magical properties in Glorantha, contrasting to the primary metal used, bronze.\nUz, the trolls, are the race of darkness; large, intelligent, astoundingly omnivorous, with a very developed sonar-like sense (\"darksense\"). Their societies are matriarchal, and they worship, among others, a goddess of darkness called Kyger Litor, mother of the Trolls, and the more violent and sinister Zorak Zoran.\nDragonewts are a magical race made up of forms of neotenic dragons. They are engaged in a cycle of self-improving reincarnation. They are alien, with an incomprehensible mindset. They must have oral surgery in order to speak human languages.\nMultimedia Glorantha.\nGlorantha has been the background for a number of different media, and numerous pieces of myth and fiction created by the Glorantha community, featured in magazines such as \"Tales of the Reaching Moon\". Several hundred gaming miniatures by various licensees and about a dozen plush toys have also been produced at various times.\nFootnotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He died at the age of 53 while aboard United Airlines Flight 175, which was deliberately crashed into the South Tower of the World Trade Center in New York City during the September 11 attacks.\nHockey Career.\nBailey had a successful junior hockey career with the Edmonton Oil Kings, winning the Memorial Cup in 1966. After recording a 93 point year during the 1966\u201367 season he was selected by the Boston Bruins in the 1966 amateur draft. \nBailey then spent two seasons with the Bruins' minor league affiliate teams. During the 1968-69 season, he helped lead the Hershey Bears to the Calder Cup, leading the American Hockey League (AHL) in assists during the postseason with 10. He also made eight appearances for the Boston Bruins throughout the season.\nThe following year, he played 58 games for the 1969\u201370 Bruins team that won the Stanley Cup. Bailey broke his ankle in a game against the Philadelphia Flyers on March 7, 1970; not appearing in any postseason games resulted in him not getting his name engraved on the trophy.\nHowever, during the 1971\u201372 season, he appeared in 73 games for the Bruins. During the postseason, he broke a 5-5 tie with the game winning goal at 17:44 of the third period to give the Bruins a victory in Game 1 of the 1972 Stanley Cup Final versus the New York Rangers. Bailey and the Bruins went on to win the Stanley Cup. \nIn 1972\u201373, Bailey was dealt to the Detroit Red Wings, and after playing two seasons for them was traded to the St. Louis Blues.\nBaileys former teammate Gerry Cheevers once stated: \"You know, Ace was a great talent, \"The times when we'd scrimmage, and Bobby (Orr) decided he didn't want the puck, Ace had it most of the time.\" Bailey was remembered by his teammates for his wit and comradeship. He also was a fan favorite. \"I remember all the kids who used to come in for our morning skate,\" Cheevers said. \"Ace was always the guy playing with them on the ice \u2026 he loved 'em.\"\nBailey spent his final four seasons with the Washington Capitals, posting his best statistical season during the 1976-77 season, during which he scored 19 goals and 27 assists. After his time in Washington, he played one year in World Hockey Association. He then moved to the Central Hockey League as a player-assistant coach for the Houston Apollos for the 1979-80 season. The following year he was named head coach of the Wichita Thunder prior to the start of the 1980-81 season, and during that season he also played his final professional game.\nAfter two seasons coaching, he was named a pro scout for the Edmonton Oilers, and held the position until the 1993-94 season. Bailey earned five Stanley Cup rings, but his name was only engraved on the trophy once, alongside the 1989-90 team due to limits on the number of names that could be engraved on the Cup in each of those years.\nAt the time of his death, Bailey was the Los Angeles Kings' director of pro scouting.\nDeath and legacy.\nBailey died when the plane in which he was travelling, United Airlines Flight 175, was hijacked and deliberately crashed into the South Tower of the World Trade Center in New York City during the September 11 attacks. Bailey and amateur scout Mark Bavis were travelling from Boston to Los Angeles when the flight was hijacked. They had been in Manchester, New Hampshire, visiting the Los Angeles Kings' AHL affiliate, the Manchester Monarchs. Neither of their remains were ever recovered.\nBailey and Bavis are mentioned in the Boston-based Dropkick Murphys song \"Your Spirit's Alive.\" Denis Leary wore a Bailey memorial T-shirt as the character Tommy Gavin in the season 1 episode \" and the fourth-season episode \" of the TV series \"Rescue Me\". In his memory, the Los Angeles Kings named their new mascot \"Bailey\".\nBailey's family founded the Ace Bailey Children's Foundation in his memory. The foundation raises funds to benefit hospitalized children, infants and their families.\nAt the National September 11 Memorial, Bailey and Bavis are memorialized at the South Pool, on Panel S-3. On October 14, 2012, the Kings brought the Stanley Cup, which the team had just won in June, to the memorial and placed it on panels featuring Bailey and Bavis's names so that the families of Bailey and Bavis could \"[have] their day with the Stanley Cup\", continuing a hockey tradition whereby players and personnel of the reigning Cup champion team each get a personal day with the trophy.\nIn 2023, he was named one of the top 100 Bruins players of all time.\nFamily.\nBailey was not related to Hockey Hall of Famer Irvine Wallace \"Ace\" Bailey.

His most popular works were the two volumes of \"Capitalism and Schizophrenia\": \"Anti-Oedipus\" (1972) and \"A Thousand Plateaus\" (1980), both co-written with psychoanalyst F\u00e9lix Guattari. His metaphysical treatise \"Difference and Repetition\" (1968) is considered to be his \"magnum opus\".\nAn important part of Deleuze's oeuvre is devoted to the reading of other philosophers: the Stoics, Leibniz, Hume, Kant, Nietzsche, Spinoza, and Bergson. A. W. Moore, citing Bernard Williams's criteria for a great thinker, ranks Deleuze among the \"greatest philosophers\". Although he once characterized himself as a \"pure metaphysician\", his work has influenced a variety of disciplines across the humanities, including philosophy, art, and literary theory, as well as movements such as post-structuralism and postmodernism.\nLife.\nEarly life.\nGilles Deleuze was born into a middle-class family in Paris and lived there for most of his life. His mother was Odette Cama\u00fcer and his father, Louis, was an engineer. His initial schooling was undertaken during World War II, during which time he attended the Lyc\u00e9e Carnot. He also spent a year in \"kh\u00e2gne\" at the Lyc\u00e9e Henri IV. During the Nazi occupation of France, Deleuze's brother, three years his senior, Georges, was arrested for his participation in the French Resistance, and died while in transit to a concentration camp. In 1944, Deleuze went to study at the Sorbonne. His teachers there included several noted specialists in the history of philosophy, such as Georges Canguilhem, Jean Hyppolite, Ferdinand Alqui\u00e9, and Maurice de Gandillac. Deleuze's lifelong interest in the canonical figures of modern philosophy owed much to these teachers.\nCareer.\nDeleuze passed the agr\u00e9gation in philosophy in 1948, and taught at various lyc\u00e9es (Amiens, Orl\u00e9ans, Louis le Grand) until 1957, when he took up a position at the University of Paris. In 1953, he published his first monograph, \"Empiricism and Subjectivity\", on David Hume. This monograph was based on his 1947 DES (\"dipl\u00f4me d'\u00e9tudes sup\u00e9rieures\") thesis, roughly equivalent to an M.A. thesis, which was conducted under the direction of Jean Hyppolite and Georges Canguilhem. From 1960 to 1964, he held a research fellow position at the Centre National de Recherche Scientifique. During this time he published the seminal \"Nietzsche and Philosophy\" (1962) and befriended Michel Foucault. From 1964 to 1969, he was a professor at the University of Lyon. In 1968, Deleuze defended his two DrE dissertations amid the ongoing May 68 demonstrations; he later published his two dissertations under the titles \"Difference and Repetition\" (supervised by Gandillac) and \"Expressionism in Philosophy: Spinoza\" (supervised by Alqui\u00e9).\nIn 1969, he was appointed to the University of Paris VIII, an experimental school organized to implement educational reform. This new university drew a number of well-known academics, including Foucault (who suggested Deleuze's hiring) and the psychoanalyst F\u00e9lix Guattari. Deleuze taught at Paris VIII until his retirement in 1987.\nPersonal life.\nDeleuze's outlook on life was sympathetic to transcendental ideas, \"nature as god\" ethics, and the monist experience. Some of the important ideas he advocated for and found inspiration in include his personally coined expression pluralism = monism, as well as the concepts of Being and Univocity.\nHe married Denise Paul \"Fanny\" Grandjouan in 1956 and they had two children.\nAccording to James Miller, Deleuze portrayed little visible interest in actually \"doing\" many of the risky things he so vividly conjured up in his lectures and writing. Married, with two children, he outwardly lived the life of a conventional French professor. He kept his fingernails untrimmed because, as he once explained, he lacked \"normal protective fingerprints\", and therefore could not \"touch an object, particularly a piece of cloth, with the pads of my fingers without sharp pain\".\nWhen once asked to talk about his life, he replied: \"Academics' lives are seldom interesting.\" Deleuze concludes his reply to this critic thus:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;What do you know about me, given that I believe in secrecy?\u00a0... If I stick where I am, if I don't travel around, like anyone else I make my inner journeys that I can only measure by my emotions, and express very obliquely and circuitously in what I write.\u00a0... Arguments from one's own privileged experience are bad and reactionary arguments.\nDeath.\nDeleuze, who had suffered from respiratory ailments from a young age, developed tuberculosis in 1968 and underwent lung removal. Deleuze was an avid smoker. He suffered increasingly severe respiratory symptoms for the rest of his life. In the last years of his life, simple tasks such as writing required laborious effort. Overwhelmed by his respiratory problems, he died by suicide on 4 November 1995, throwing himself from the window of his apartment.\nBefore his death, Deleuze had announced his intention to write a book entitled \"La Grandeur de Marx\" (\"The Greatness of Marx\"), and left behind two chapters of an unfinished project entitled \"Ensembles and Multiplicities\" (these chapters have been published as the essays \"Immanence: A Life\" and \"The Actual and the Virtual\"). He is buried in the cemetery of the village of Saint-L\u00e9onard-de-Noblat.\nPhilosophy.\nDeleuze's works fall into two groups: on the one hand, monographs interpreting the work of other philosophers (Baruch Spinoza, Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz, David Hume, Immanuel Kant, Friedrich Nietzsche, Henri Bergson, Michel Foucault) and artists (Marcel Proust, Franz Kafka, Francis Bacon); on the other, eclectic philosophical tomes organized by concept (e.g., difference, sense, event, economy, cinema, desire, philosophy). However, both of these aspects are seen by his critics and analysts as often overlapping, in particular, due to his prose and the unique mapping of his books that allow for multifaceted readings.\nMetaphysics.\nDeleuze's main philosophical project in the works he wrote prior to his collaborations with Guattari can be summarized as an inversion of the traditional metaphysical relationship between identity and difference. Traditionally, difference is seen as derivative from identity: e.g., to say that \"X is different from Y\" assumes some X and Y with at least relatively stable identities (as in Plato's forms). On the contrary, Deleuze claims that all identities are effects of difference. Identities are neither logically nor metaphysically prior to difference, Deleuze argues, \"given that there exist differences of nature between things of the same genus.\" That is, not only are no two things ever the same, the categories used to identify individuals in the first place derive from differences. Apparent identities such as \"X\" are composed of endless series of differences, where \"X\" = \"the difference between x and xformula_1\", and \"xformula_1\" = \"the difference between...\", and so forth. Difference, in other words, goes all the way down. To confront reality honestly, Deleuze argues, beings must be grasped exactly as they are, and concepts of identity (forms, categories, resemblances, unities of apperception, predicates, etc.) fail to attain what he calls \"difference in itself.\" \"If philosophy has a positive and direct relation to things, it is only insofar as philosophy claims to grasp the thing itself, according to what it is, in its difference from everything it is not, in other words, in its \"internal difference\".\"\nLike Kant, Deleuze considers traditional notions of space and time as unifying forms imposed by the subject. He, therefore, concludes that pure difference is non-spatiotemporal; it is an idea, what Deleuze calls \"the virtual\". (The coinage refers to Proust's definition of what is constant in both the past and the present: \"real without being actual, ideal without being abstract.\") While Deleuze's virtual ideas superficially resemble Plato's forms and Kant's ideas of pure reason, they are not originals or models, nor do they transcend possible experience; instead they are the conditions of actual experience, the internal difference in itself. \"The concept they [the conditions] form is identical to its object.\" A Deleuzean idea or concept of difference is therefore not a wraith-like abstraction of an experienced thing, it is a real system of differential relations that creates actual spaces, times, and sensations.\nThus, Deleuze at times refers to his philosophy as a transcendental empiricism (), alluding to Kant. In Kant's transcendental idealism, experience only makes sense when organized by intuitions (namely, space and time) and concepts (such as causality). Assuming the content of these intuitions and concepts to be qualities of the world as it exists independently of human perceptual access, according to Kant, spawns seductive but senseless metaphysical beliefs (for example, extending the concept of causality beyond possible experience results in unverifiable speculation about a first cause). Deleuze inverts the Kantian arrangement: experience exceeds human concepts by presenting novelty, and this raw experience of difference actualizes an idea, unfettered by prior categories, forcing the invention of new ways of thinking (see \"Epistemology\").\nSimultaneously, Deleuze claims that being is univocal, i.e., that all of its senses are affirmed in one voice. Deleuze borrows the doctrine of \"ontological univocity\" from the medieval philosopher John Duns Scotus. In medieval disputes over the nature of God, many eminent theologians and philosophers (such as Thomas Aquinas) held that when one says that \"God is good\", God's goodness is only analogous to human goodness. Scotus argued to the contrary that when one says that \"God is good\", the goodness in question is exactly the same sort of goodness that is meant when one says \"Jane is good\". That is, God only differs from humans in degree, and properties such as goodness, power, reason, and so forth are univocally applied, regardless of whether one is talking about God, a person, or a flea.\nDeleuze adapts the doctrine of univocity to claim that being is, univocally, difference. \"With univocity, however, it is not the differences which are and must be: it is being which is Difference, in the sense that it is said of difference. Moreover, it is not we who are univocal in a Being which is not; it is we and our individuality which remains equivocal in and for a univocal Being.\" Here Deleuze at once echoes and inverts Spinoza, who maintained that everything that exists is a modification of the one substance, God or Nature. For Deleuze, there is no one substance, only an always-differentiating process, an origami cosmos, always folding, unfolding, refolding. Deleuze summarizes this ontology in the paradoxical formula \"pluralism = monism\".\n\"Difference and Repetition\" (1968) is Deleuze's most sustained and systematic attempt to work out the details of such a metaphysics, but his other works develop similar ideas. In \"Nietzsche and Philosophy\" (1962), for example, reality is a play of forces; in \"Anti-Oedipus\" (1972), a \"body without organs\"; in \"What is Philosophy?\" (1991), a \"plane of immanence\" or \"chaosmos\".\nEpistemology.\nDeleuze's unusual metaphysics entails an equally atypical epistemology, or what he calls a transformation of \"the image of thought\". According to Deleuze, the traditional image of thought, found in philosophers such as Aristotle, Ren\u00e9 Descartes, and Edmund Husserl, misconceives thinking as a mostly unproblematic business. Truth may be hard to discover\u2014it may require a life of pure theorizing, or rigorous computation, or systematic doubt\u2014but thinking is able, at least in principle, to correctly grasp facts, forms, ideas, etc. It may be practically impossible to attain a God's-eye, neutral point of view, but that is the ideal to approximate: a disinterested pursuit that results in a determinate, fixed truth; an orderly extension of common sense. Deleuze rejects this view as papering over the metaphysical flux, instead claiming that genuine thinking is a violent confrontation with reality, an involuntary rupture of established categories. Truth changes thought; it alters what people think is possible. By setting aside the assumption that thinking has a natural ability to recognize the truth, Deleuze says, people attain a \"thought without image\", a thought always determined by problems rather than solving them. \"All this, however, presupposes codes or axioms which do not result by chance, but which do not have an intrinsic rationality either. It's just like theology: everything about it is quite rational if you accept sin, the immaculate conception, and the incarnation. Reason is always a region carved out of the irrational\u2014not sheltered from the irrational at all, but traversed by it and only defined by a particular kind of relationship among irrational factors. Underneath all reason lies delirium, and drift.\"\n\"The Logic of Sense\", published in 1969, is one of Deleuze's most peculiar works in the field of epistemology. Michel Foucault, in his essay \"Theatrum Philosophicum\" about the book, attributed this to how he begins with his metaphysics but approaches it through language and truth; the book is focused on \"the simple condition that instead of denouncing metaphysics as the neglect of being, we force it to speak of extrabeing\". In it, he refers to epistemological paradoxes: in the first series, as he analyzes Lewis Carroll's \"Alice in Wonderland\", he remarks that \"the personal self requires God and the world in general. But when substantives and adjectives begin to dissolve, when the names of pause and rest are carried away by the verbs of pure becoming and slide into the language of events, all identity disappears from the self, the world, and God.\"\nDeleuze's peculiar readings of the history of philosophy stem from this unusual epistemological perspective. To read a philosopher is no longer to aim at finding a single, correct interpretation, but is instead to present a philosopher's attempt to grapple with the problematic nature of reality. \"Philosophers introduce new concepts, they explain them, but they don't tell us, not completely anyway, the problems to which those concepts are a response. [...] The history of philosophy, rather than repeating what a philosopher says, has to say what he must have taken for granted, what he didn't say but is nonetheless present in what he did say.\"\nLikewise, rather than seeing philosophy as a timeless pursuit of truth, reason, or universals, Deleuze defines philosophy as the creation of concepts. For Deleuze, concepts are not identity conditions or propositions, but metaphysical constructions that define a range of thinking, such as Plato's ideas, Descartes's \"cogito\", or Kant's doctrine of the faculties. A philosophical concept \"posits itself and its object at the same time as it is created.\" In Deleuze's view, then, philosophy more closely resembles practical or artistic production than it does an adjunct to a definitive scientific description of a pre-existing world (as in the tradition of John Locke or Willard Van Orman Quine).\nIn his later work (from roughly 1981 onward), Deleuze sharply distinguishes art, philosophy, and science as three distinct disciplines, each relating to reality in different ways. While philosophy creates concepts, the arts create novel qualitative combinations of sensation and feeling (what Deleuze calls \"percepts\" and \"affects\"), and the sciences create quantitative theories based on fixed points of reference such as the speed of light or absolute zero (which Deleuze calls \"functives\"). According to Deleuze, none of these disciplines enjoy primacy over the others: they are different ways of organizing the metaphysical flux, \"separate melodic lines in constant interplay with one another.\" For example, Deleuze does not treat cinema as an art representing an external reality, but as an ontological practice that creates different ways of organizing movement and time. Philosophy, science, and art are equally, and essentially, creative and practical. Hence, instead of asking traditional questions of identity such as \"is it true?\" or \"what is it?\", Deleuze proposes that inquiries should be functional or practical: \"what does it do?\" or \"how does it work?\"\nValues.\nIn ethics and politics Deleuze again echoes Spinoza, albeit in a sharply Nietzschean key. Following his rejection of any metaphysics based on identity, Deleuze criticizes the notion of an individual as an arresting or halting of differentiation (as the etymology of the word \"individual\" suggests). Guided by the naturalistic ethics of Spinoza and Nietzsche, Deleuze instead seeks to understand individuals and their moralities as products of the organization of pre-individual desires and powers. \nIn the two volumes of \"Capitalism and Schizophrenia\", \"Anti-Oedipus\" (1972) and \"A Thousand Plateaus\" (1980), Deleuze and Guattari describe history as a congealing and regimentation of \"desiring-production\" (a concept combining features of Freudian drives and Marxist labor) into the modern individual (typically neurotic and repressed), the nation-state (a society of continuous control), and capitalism (an anarchy domesticated into infantilizing commodification). Deleuze, following Karl Marx, welcomes capitalism's destruction of traditional social hierarchies as liberating but inveighs against its homogenization of all values to the aims of the market.\nThe first part of \"Capitalism and Schizophrenia\" undertakes a universal history and posits the existence of a separate socius (the social body that takes credit for production) for each mode of production: the earth for the tribe, the body of the despot for the empire, and capital for capitalism.\"\nIn his 1990 essay \"Postscript on the Societies of Control\" (\"Post-scriptum sur les soci\u00e9t\u00e9s de contr\u00f4le\"), Deleuze builds on Foucault's notion of the society of discipline to argue that society is undergoing a shift in structure and control. Where societies of discipline were characterized by discrete physical enclosures (such as schools, factories, prisons, office buildings, etc.), institutions and technologies introduced since World War II have dissolved the boundaries between these enclosures. As a result, social coercion and discipline have moved into the lives of individuals considered as \"masses, samples, data, markets, or 'banks'.\" The mechanisms of modern societies of control are described as continuous, following and tracking individuals throughout their existence via transaction records, mobile location tracking, and other personally identifiable information.\nBut how does Deleuze square his pessimistic diagnoses with his ethical naturalism? Deleuze claims that standards of value are internal or immanent: to live well is to fully express one's power, to go to the limits of one's potential, rather than to judge what exists by non-empirical, transcendent standards. Modern society still suppresses difference and alienates people from what they can do. To affirm reality, which is a flux of change and difference, established identities must be overturned and so become all that they can become\u2014though exactly what cannot be known in advance. The pinnacle of Deleuzean practice, then, is creativity. \"Herein, perhaps, lies the secret: to bring into existence and not to judge. If it is so disgusting to judge, it is not because everything is of equal value, but on the contrary, because what has value can be made or distinguished only by defying judgment. What expert judgment, in art, could ever bear on the work to come?\"\nDeleuze's interpretations.\nDeleuze's studies of individual philosophers and artists are purposely heterodox. Deleuze once famously described his method of interpreting philosophers as \"buggery (\"enculage\")\", as sneaking behind an author and producing an offspring which is recognizably his, yet also monstrous and different.\nThe various monographs thus are not attempts to present what Nietzsche or Spinoza strictly intended, but re-stagings of their ideas in different and unexpected ways. Deleuze's peculiar readings aim to enact the creativity he believes is the acme of philosophical practice. A parallel in painting Deleuze points to is Francis Bacon's \"Study after Vel\u00e1zquez\"\u2014it is quite beside the point to say that Bacon \"gets Velasquez wrong\". Similar considerations apply, in Deleuze's view, to his own uses of mathematical and scientific terms, \"pace\" critics such as Alan Sokal: \"I'm not saying that Resnais and Prigogine, or Godard and Thom, are doing the same thing. I'm pointing out, rather, that there are remarkable similarities between scientific creators of functions and cinematic creators of images. And the same goes for philosophical concepts, since there are distinct concepts of these spaces.\"\nSimilarities with Heidegger.\nFrom the 1930s onward, German philosopher Martin Heidegger wrote in a series of manuscripts and books on concepts of Difference, Identity, Representation, and Event; notably among these the \"Beitr\u00e4ge zur Philosophie\" \"(Vom Ereignis)\" (Written 1936-38; published posthumously 1989); none of the relevant texts were translated into French by Deleuze's death in 1995, excluding any strong possibility of appropriation. However, Heidegger's early work can be traced through mathematician Albert Lautman, who drew heavily from Heidegger's \"Sein und Zeit\" and \"Vom Wesen des Grundes\" (1928), which James Bahoh describes as having \"...decisive influence on the twentieth century mathematician and philosopher [...] whose theory of dialectical Ideas Deleuze appropriated and modified for his own use.\" The similarities between Heidegger's later, post-turn, 1930-1976 thought and Deleuze's early works in the 60s and 70s are generally described by Deleuze-scholar Daniel W. Smith in the following way: \"\"Difference and Repetition\" could be read as a response to \"Being and Time\" (for Deleuze, Being is difference, and time is repetition).\"Bahoh continues in saying that: \"...then \"Beitr\u00e4ge\" could be read as \"Difference and Repetition\"'s unknowing and anachronistic doppelg\u00e4nger.\" Deleuze and Heidegger's philosophy is considered to converge on the topics of Difference and the Event. Where, for Heidegger, an evental being is constituted in part by difference as \"...an essential dimension of the concept of event\"; for Deleuze, being is difference, and difference \"differentiates by way of events.\" In contrast to this, however, Jussi Backman argues that, for Heidegger, being is united only insofar as it consists of and \"is\" difference, or rather as the movement of difference, not too dissimilar to Deleuze's later claims:\"...the unity and univocity of being (in the sense of being), its 'selfsameness,' paradoxically consists exclusively in difference.\"This mutual apprehension of a differential, Evental ontology lead both thinkers into an extended critique of the representation characteristic to Platonic, Aristotelian, and Cartesian thought; as Joe Hughes states: \"\"Difference and Repetition\" is a detective novel. It tells the story of what some readers of Deleuze might consider a horrendous crime [...]: the birth of representation.\" Heidegger formed his critiques most decisively in the concept of the fourfold [\"German: das Geviert\"], a non-metaphysical grounding for the thing (as opposed to \"object\") as \"ungrounded, mediated, meaningful, and shared\" united in an \"event of appropriation\" [\"Ereignis\"]. This evental ontology continues in \"Identit\u00e4t und Differenz\", where the fundamental concept expressed in \"Difference and Repetition\", of dethroning the primacy of identity, can be seen throughout the text. Even in earlier Heideggerian texts such as \"Sein und Zeit\", however, the critique of representation is \"...cast in terms of the being of truth, or the processes of uncovering and covering (grounded in Dasein's existence) whereby beings come into and withdraw from phenomenal presence.\" In parallel, Deleuze's extended critique of representation (in the sense of detailing a \"genealogy\" of the antiquated beliefs as well) is given \"...in terms of being or becoming as difference and repetition, together with genetic processes of individuation whereby beings come to exist and pass out of existence.\" \nTime and space, for both thinkers, is also constituted in nearly identical ways. Time-space in the \"Beitr\u00e4ge\" and the three syntheses in \"Difference and Repetition\" both apprehend time as grounded in difference, whilst the distinction between the time-space of the world [Welt] and the time-space as the eventual production of such a time-space is mirrored by Deleuze's categorization between the temporality of what is actual and temporality of the virtual in the first and the second/third syntheses respectively. \nAnother parallel can be found in their utilization of so-called \"generative paradoxes,\" or rather problems whose fundamental problematic element is constantly outside the categorical grasp fond of formal, natural, and human sciences. For Heidegger, this is the Earth in the fourfold, something which has as one of its traits the behaviour of \"resisting articulation,\" what he characterizes as a \"strife\"; for Deleuze, a similar example can be spotted in the paradox of regress, or of indefinite proliferation in the \"Logic of Sense\".\nReception.\nIn the 1960s, Deleuze's portrayal of Nietzsche as a metaphysician of difference rather than a reactionary mystic contributed greatly to the plausibility and popularity of \"left-wing Nietzscheanism\" as an intellectual stance. His books \"Difference and Repetition\" (1968) and \"The Logic of Sense\" (1969) led Michel Foucault to declare that \"one day, perhaps, this century will be called Deleuzian.\" (Deleuze, for his part, said Foucault's comment was \"a joke meant to make people who like us laugh, and make everyone else livid.\") In the 1970s, the \"Anti-Oedipus\", written in a style by turns vulgar and esoteric, offering a sweeping analysis of the family, language, capitalism, and history via eclectic borrowings from primarily Marx, Freud, Lacan, and Nietzsche, but also featuring insights from dozens of other writers, was received as a theoretical embodiment of the anarchic spirit of May 1968. In 1994 and 1995, \"L'Ab\u00e9c\u00e9daire de Gilles Deleuze\", an eight-hour series of interviews between Deleuze and Claire Parnet, aired on France's Arte Channel.\nIn the 1980s and 1990s, almost all of Deleuze's books were translated into English. Deleuze's work is frequently cited in English-speaking academia (in 2007, e.g., he was the 11th most frequently cited author in English-speaking publications in the humanities, between Freud and Kant). In the English-speaking academy, Deleuze's work is typically classified as continental philosophy.\nHowever, some French and some Anglophone philosophers criticised Deleuze's work.\nAccording to Pascal Engel, Deleuze's metaphilosophical approach makes it impossible to reasonably disagree with a philosophical system, and so destroys meaning, truth, and philosophy itself. Engel summarizes Deleuze's metaphilosophy thus: \"When faced with a beautiful philosophical concept you should just sit back and admire it. You should not question it.\"\nAmerican philosopher Stanley Rosen objects to Deleuze's interpretation of Nietzsche's eternal return.\nVincent Descombes argues that Deleuze's account of a difference that is not derived from identity (in \"Nietzsche and Philosophy\") is incoherent.\nSlavoj \u017di\u017eek states that the Deleuze of \"Anti-Oedipus\" (\"arguably Deleuze's worst book\"), the \"political\" Deleuze under the \"'bad' influence\" of Guattari, ends up, despite protestations to the contrary, as \"the ideologist of late capitalism\".\nAllegations of idealism and negligence of material conditions.\nPeter Hallward argues that Deleuze's insistence that being is necessarily creative and always-differentiating entails that his philosophy can offer no insight into, and is supremely indifferent to, the material conditions of existence. Thus Hallward claims that Deleuze's thought is literally other-worldly, aiming only at a passive contemplation of the dissolution of all identity into the theophanic self-creation of nature.\nDescombes argues that his analysis of history in \"Anti-Oedipus\" is 'utter idealism', criticizing reality for falling short of a non-existent ideal of schizophrenic becoming.\n\u017di\u017eek claims that Deleuze's ontology oscillates between materialism and idealism.\nRelation with monism.\nAlain Badiou claims that Deleuze's metaphysics only apparently embraces plurality and diversity, remaining at bottom monist. Badiou further argues that, in practical matters, Deleuze's monism entails an ascetic, aristocratic fatalism akin to ancient Stoicism.\nAmerican philosopher Todd May argues that Deleuze's claim that difference is ontologically primary ultimately contradicts his embrace of immanence, i.e., his monism. However, May believes that Deleuze can discard the primacy-of-difference thesis, and accept a Wittgensteinian holism without significantly altering his practical philosophy.\nIt has more recently been argued by the Swedish philosopher Rafael Holmberg that Deleuze's criticism of the history of philosophy as the metaphysical priority of identity over difference is a false distinction, and that Deleuze inadvertently reaches conclusions akin to such idealist philosophers of identity as Schelling.\nSubjectivity and individuality.\nOther European philosophers have criticized Deleuze's theory of subjectivity. For example, Manfred Frank claims that Deleuze's theory of individuation as a process of bottomless differentiation fails to explain the unity of consciousness. \n\u017di\u017eek also calls Deleuze to task for allegedly reducing the subject to \"just another\" substance and thereby failing to grasp the nothingness that, according to Lacan and \u017di\u017eek, defines subjectivity. What remains worthwhile in Deleuze's oeuvre, \u017di\u017eek finds, are precisely Deleuze's engagements with virtuality as the product of negativity.\nScience wars.\nIn \"Fashionable Nonsense\" (1997), physicists Alan Sokal and Jean Bricmont accuse Deleuze of abusing mathematical and scientific terms, particularly by sliding between accepted technical meanings and his own idiosyncratic use of those terms in his works. Sokal and Bricmont state that they don't object to metaphorical reasoning, including with mathematical concepts, but mathematical and scientific terms are useful only insofar as they are precise. They give examples of mathematical concepts being \"abused\" by taking them out of their intended meaning, rendering the idea into normal language reduces it to truism or nonsense. In their opinion, Deleuze used mathematical concepts about which the typical reader might be not knowledgeable, and thus served to display erudition rather than enlightening the reader. Sokal and Bricmont state that they only deal with the \"abuse\" of mathematical and scientific concepts and explicitly suspend judgment about Deleuze's wider contributions.\nInfluence.\nOther scholars in continental philosophy, feminist studies and sexuality studies have taken Deleuze's analysis of the sexual dynamics of sadism and masochism with a level of uncritical celebration following the 1989 Zone Books translation of the 1967 booklet on Leopold von Sacher-Masoch, \"Le froid et le cruel\" (Coldness and Cruelty). As sexuality historian Alison M. Moore notes, Deleuze's own value placed on difference is poorly reflected in this booklet which fails to differentiate between Masoch's own view of his desire and that imposed upon him by the pathologizing forms of psychiatric thought prevailing in the late nineteenth century which produced the concept of 'masochism' (a term Masoch himself emphatically rejected).\nSmith, Protevi and Voss note \"Sokal and Bricmont\u2019s 1999 intimations\" underestimated Deleuze's awareness of mathematics and pointed out several \"positive views of Deleuze\u2019s use of mathematics as provocations for [...] his philosophical concepts\", and that Deleuze's epistemology and ontology can be \"brought together\" with dynamical systems theory, chaos theory, biology, and geography.\nBibliography.\nIn collaboration with F\u00e9lix Guattari\nIn collaboration with Michel Foucault\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The word is derived from the Greek \"\" (), literally 'milky', a reference to the Milky Way galaxy that contains the Solar System. Galaxies, averaging an estimated 100 million stars, range in size from dwarfs with less than a thousand stars, to the largest galaxies known \u2013 supergiants with one hundred trillion stars, each orbiting its galaxy's centre of mass. Most of the mass in a typical galaxy is in the form of dark matter, with only a few per cent of that mass visible in the form of stars and nebulae. Supermassive black holes are a common feature at the centres of galaxies.\nGalaxies are categorised according to their visual morphology as elliptical, spiral, or irregular. The Milky Way is an example of a spiral galaxy. It is estimated that there are between 200 billion () to 2 trillion galaxies in the observable universe. Most galaxies are 1,000 to 100,000 parsecs in diameter (approximately 3,000 to 300,000 light years) and are separated by distances in the order of millions of parsecs (or megaparsecs). For comparison, the Milky Way has a diameter of at least 26,800 parsecs (87,400 ly) and is separated from the Andromeda Galaxy, its nearest large neighbour, by just over 750,000 parsecs (2.5 million ly).\nThe space between galaxies is filled with a tenuous gas (the intergalactic medium) with an average density of less than one atom per cubic metre. Most galaxies are gravitationally organised into groups, clusters and superclusters. The Milky Way is part of the Local Group, which it dominates along with the Andromeda Galaxy. The group is part of the Virgo Supercluster. At the largest scale, these associations are generally arranged into sheets and filaments surrounded by immense voids. Both the Local Group and the Virgo Supercluster are contained in a much larger cosmic structure named Laniakea.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:TOC limit/styles.css\" /&gt;\nEtymology.\nThe word \"galaxy\" was borrowed via French and Medieval Latin from the Greek term for the Milky Way, \"\" () 'milky (circle)', named after its appearance as a milky band of light in the sky.\nIn the astronomical literature, the capitalised word \"Galaxy\" is often used to refer to the Milky Way galaxy, to distinguish it from the other galaxies in the universe. \nGalaxies were initially discovered telescopically and were known as \"spiral nebulae\". Most 18th- to 19th-century astronomers considered them as either unresolved star clusters or extragalactic nebulae, but their true composition and natures remained a mystery. Observations using larger telescopes of a few nearby bright galaxies, like the Andromeda Galaxy, began resolving them into huge conglomerations of stars, but based simply on the apparent faintness and sheer population of stars, the true distances of these objects placed them well beyond the Milky Way. For this reason they were popularly called \"island universes\". Harlow Shapley began to advocate for the term \"galaxy\" and against using \"universes\" and \"nebula\" for the objects but the very influential Edwin Hubble stuck to nebulae. The nomenclature did not fully change in until Hubble's death in 1953.\nNomenclature.\nMillions of galaxies have been catalogued, but only a few have well-established names, such as the Andromeda Galaxy, the Magellanic Clouds, the Whirlpool Galaxy, and the Sombrero Galaxy. Astronomers work with numbers from certain catalogues, such as the Messier catalogue, the NGC (New General Catalogue), the IC (Index Catalogue), the CGCG (Catalogue of Galaxies and of Clusters of Galaxies), the MCG (Morphological Catalogue of Galaxies), the UGC (Uppsala General Catalogue of Galaxies), and the PGC (Catalogue of Principal Galaxies, also known as LEDA). All the well-known galaxies appear in one or more of these catalogues but each time under a different number. For example, Messier 109 (or \"M109\") is a spiral galaxy having the number 109 in the catalogue of Messier. It also has the designations NGC 3992, UGC 6937, CGCG 269\u2013023, MCG +09-20-044, and PGC 37617 (or LEDA 37617), among others. Millions of fainter galaxies are known by their identifiers in sky surveys such as the Sloan Digital Sky Survey.\nObservation history.\nMilky Way.\nGreek philosopher Democritus (450\u2013370 BCE) proposed that the bright band on the night sky known as the Milky Way might consist of distant stars.\nAristotle (384\u2013322 BCE), however, believed the Milky Way was caused by \"the ignition of the fiery exhalation of some stars that were large, numerous and close together\" and that the \"ignition takes place in the upper part of the atmosphere, in the region of the World that is continuous with the heavenly motions.\" Neoplatonist philosopher Olympiodorus the Younger (c.\u2009495\u2013570 CE) was critical of this view, arguing that if the Milky Way was sublunary (situated between Earth and the Moon) it should appear different at different times and places on Earth, and that it should have parallax, which it did not. In his view, the Milky Way was celestial.\nAccording to Mohani Mohamed, Arabian astronomer Ibn al-Haytham (965\u20131037) made the first attempt at observing and measuring the Milky Way's parallax, and he thus \"determined that because the Milky Way had no parallax, it must be remote from the Earth, not belonging to the atmosphere\". Persian astronomer al-Biruni (973\u20131048) proposed the Milky Way galaxy was \"a collection of countless fragments of the nature of nebulous stars.\" Andalusian astronomer Avempace (d. 1138) proposed that it was composed of many stars that almost touched one another, and appeared to be a continuous image due to the effect of refraction from sublunary material, citing his observation of the conjunction of Jupiter and Mars as evidence of this occurring when two objects were near. In the 14th century, Syrian-born Ibn Qayyim al-Jawziyya proposed the Milky Way galaxy was \"a myriad of tiny stars packed together in the sphere of the fixed stars.\"\nActual proof of the Milky Way consisting of many stars came in 1610 when the Italian astronomer Galileo Galilei used a telescope to study it and discovered it was composed of a huge number of faint stars. In 1750, English astronomer Thomas Wright correctly speculated that it might be a rotating body of a huge number of stars held together by gravitational forces, akin to the Solar System but on a much larger scale, and that the resulting disk of stars could be seen as a band on the sky from a perspective inside it. In his 1755 treatise, Immanuel Kant elaborated on Wright's idea about the Milky Way's structure. \nThe first project to describe the shape of the Milky Way and the position of the Sun was undertaken by William Herschel in 1785 by counting the number of stars in different regions of the sky. He produced a diagram of the shape of the galaxy with the Solar System close to the center. Using a refined approach, Kapteyn in 1920 arrived at the picture of a small (diameter about 15\u00a0kiloparsecs) ellipsoid galaxy with the Sun close to the center. A different method by Harlow Shapley based on the cataloguing of globular clusters led to a radically different picture: a flat disk with diameter approximately 70\u00a0kiloparsecs and the Sun far from the centre. Both analyses failed to take into account the absorption of light by interstellar dust present in the galactic plane; but after Robert Julius Trumpler quantified this effect in 1930 by studying open clusters, the present picture of the Milky Way galaxy emerged.\nDistinction from other nebulae.\nA few galaxies outside the Milky Way are visible on a dark night to the unaided eye, including the Andromeda Galaxy, Large Magellanic Cloud, Small Magellanic Cloud, and the Triangulum Galaxy. In the 10th century, Persian astronomer Abd al-Rahman al-Sufi made the earliest recorded identification of the Andromeda Galaxy, describing it as a \"small cloud\". In 964, he apparently mentioned the Large Magellanic Cloud in his \"Book of Fixed Stars\", referring to \"Al Bakr of the southern Arabs\", since at a declination of about 70\u00b0 south it was not visible where he lived. It was not well known to Europeans until Magellan's voyage in the 16th century. The Andromeda Galaxy was later independently noted by Simon Marius in 1612.\nIn 1734, philosopher Emanuel Swedenborg in his \"Principia\" speculated that there might be other galaxies outside that were formed into galactic clusters that were minuscule parts of the universe that extended far beyond what could be seen. Swedenborg's views \"are remarkably close to the present-day views of the cosmos.\"\nIn 1745, Pierre Louis Maupertuis conjectured that some nebula-like objects were collections of stars with unique properties, including a glow exceeding the light its stars produced on their own, and repeated Johannes Hevelius's view that the bright spots were massive and flattened due to their rotation.\nIn 1750, Thomas Wright correctly speculated that the Milky Way was a flattened disk of stars, and that some of the nebulae visible in the night sky might be separate Milky Ways.\nToward the end of the 18th century, Charles Messier compiled a catalog containing the 109 brightest celestial objects having nebulous appearance. Subsequently, William Herschel assembled a catalog of 5,000 nebulae. In 1845, Lord Rosse examined the nebulae catalogued by Herschel and observed the spiral structure of Messier object M51, now known as the Whirlpool Galaxy.\nIn 1912, Vesto M. Slipher made spectrographic studies of the brightest spiral nebulae to determine their composition. Slipher discovered that the spiral nebulae have high Doppler shifts, indicating that they are moving at a rate exceeding the velocity of the stars he had measured. He found that the majority of these nebulae are moving away from us.\nIn 1917, Heber Doust Curtis observed nova S Andromedae within the \"Great Andromeda Nebula\", as the Andromeda Galaxy, Messier object M31, was then known. Searching the photographic record, he found 11 more novae. Curtis noticed that these novae were, on average, 10 magnitudes fainter than those that occurred within this galaxy. As a result, he was able to come up with a distance estimate of 150,000\u00a0parsecs. He became a proponent of the so-called \"island universes\" hypothesis, which holds that spiral nebulae are actually independent galaxies.\nIn 1920 a debate took place between Harlow Shapley and Heber Curtis, the Great Debate, concerning the nature of the Milky Way, spiral nebulae, and the dimensions of the universe. To support his claim that the Great Andromeda Nebula is an external galaxy, Curtis noted the appearance of dark lanes resembling the dust clouds in the Milky Way, as well as the significant Doppler shift.\nIn 1922, the Estonian astronomer Ernst \u00d6pik gave a distance determination that supported the theory that the Andromeda Nebula is indeed a distant extra-galactic object. Using the new 100-inch Mount Wilson telescope, Edwin Hubble was able to resolve the outer parts of some spiral nebulae as collections of individual stars and identified some Cepheid variables, thus allowing him to estimate the distance to the nebulae: they were far too distant to be part of the Milky Way. In 1926 Hubble produced a classification of galactic morphology that is used to this day.\nMulti-wavelength observation.\nAdvances in astronomy have always been driven by technology. After centuries of success in optical astronomy, recent decades have seen major progress in other regions of the electromagnetic spectrum.\nThe dust present in the interstellar medium is opaque to visual light. It is more transparent to far-infrared, which can be used to observe the interior regions of giant molecular clouds and galactic cores in great detail. Infrared is also used to observe distant, red-shifted galaxies that were formed much earlier. Water vapor and carbon dioxide absorb a number of useful portions of the infrared spectrum, so high-altitude or space-based telescopes are used for infrared astronomy.\nThe first non-visual study of galaxies, particularly active galaxies, was made using radio frequencies. The Earth's atmosphere is nearly transparent to radio between 5\u00a0MHz and 30\u00a0GHz. The ionosphere blocks signals below this range. Large radio interferometers have been used to map the active jets emitted from active nuclei.\nUltraviolet and X-ray telescopes can observe highly energetic galactic phenomena. Ultraviolet flares are sometimes observed when a star in a distant galaxy is torn apart from the tidal forces of a nearby black hole. The distribution of hot gas in galactic clusters can be mapped by X-rays. The existence of supermassive black holes at the cores of galaxies was confirmed through X-ray astronomy.\nModern research.\nIn 1944, Hendrik van de Hulst predicted that microwave radiation with wavelength of 21 cm would be detectable from interstellar atomic hydrogen gas; and in 1951 it was observed. This radiation is not affected by dust absorption, and so its Doppler shift can be used to map the motion of the gas in this galaxy. These observations led to the hypothesis of a rotating bar structure in the center of this galaxy. With improved radio telescopes, hydrogen gas could also be traced in other galaxies.\nIn the 1970s, Vera Rubin uncovered a discrepancy between observed galactic rotation speed and that predicted by the visible mass of stars and gas. Today, the galaxy rotation problem is thought to be explained by the presence of large quantities of unseen dark matter.\nBeginning in the 1990s, the Hubble Space Telescope yielded improved observations. Among other things, its data helped establish that the missing dark matter in this galaxy could not consist solely of inherently faint and small stars. The Hubble Deep Field, an extremely long exposure of a relatively empty part of the sky, provided evidence that there are about 125 billion () galaxies in the observable universe. Improved technology in detecting the spectra invisible to humans (radio telescopes, infrared cameras, and x-ray telescopes) allows detection of other galaxies that are not detected by Hubble. Particularly, surveys in the Zone of Avoidance (the region of sky blocked at visible-light wavelengths by the Milky Way) have revealed a number of new galaxies.\nA 2016 study published in \"The Astrophysical Journal,\" led by Christopher Conselice of the University of Nottingham, analyzed many sources of data to estimate that the observable universe (up to z=8) contained at least two trillion () galaxies, a factor of 10 more than are directly observed in Hubble images. However, later observations with the \"New Horizons\" space probe from outside the zodiacal light observed less cosmic optical light than Conselice while still suggesting that direct observations are missing galaxies.\nTypes and morphology.\nGalaxies come in three main types: ellipticals, spirals, and irregulars. A slightly more extensive description of galaxy types based on their appearance is given by the Hubble sequence. Since the Hubble sequence is entirely based upon visual morphological type (shape), it may miss certain important characteristics of galaxies such as star formation rate in starburst galaxies and activity in the cores of active galaxies.\nMany galaxies are thought to contain a supermassive black hole at their center. This includes the Milky Way, whose core region is called the Galactic Center.\nEllipticals.\nThe Hubble classification system rates elliptical galaxies on the basis of their ellipticity, ranging from E0, being nearly spherical, up to E7, which is highly elongated. These galaxies have an ellipsoidal profile, giving them an elliptical appearance regardless of the viewing angle. Their appearance shows little structure and they typically have relatively little interstellar matter. Consequently, these galaxies also have a low portion of open clusters and a reduced rate of new star formation. Instead, they are dominated by generally older, more evolved stars that are orbiting the common center of gravity in random directions. The stars contain low abundances of heavy elements because star formation ceases after the initial burst. In this sense they have some similarity to the much smaller globular clusters.\nType-cD galaxies.\nThe largest galaxies are the type-cD galaxies.\nFirst described in 1964 by a paper by Thomas A. Matthews and others, they are a subtype of the more general class of D galaxies, which are giant elliptical galaxies, except that they are much larger. They are popularly known as the supergiant elliptical galaxies and constitute the largest and most luminous galaxies known. These galaxies feature a central elliptical nucleus with an extensive, faint halo of stars extending to megaparsec scales. The profile of their surface brightnesses as a function of their radius (or distance from their cores) falls off more slowly than their smaller counterparts.\nThe formation of these cD galaxies remains an active area of research, but the leading model is that they are the result of the mergers of smaller galaxies in the environments of dense clusters, or even those outside of clusters with random overdensities. These processes are the mechanisms that drive the formation of fossil groups or fossil clusters, where a large, relatively isolated, supergiant elliptical resides in the middle of the cluster and are surrounded by an extensive cloud of X-rays as the residue of these galactic collisions. Another older model posits the phenomenon of cooling flow, where the heated gases in clusters collapses towards their centers as they cool, forming stars in the process, a phenomenon observed in clusters such as Perseus, and more recently in the Phoenix Cluster.\nShell galaxy.\nA shell galaxy is a type of elliptical galaxy where the stars in its halo are arranged in concentric shells. About one-tenth of elliptical galaxies have a shell-like structure, which has never been observed in spiral galaxies. These structures are thought to develop when a larger galaxy absorbs a smaller companion galaxy\u2014that as the two galaxy centers approach, they start to oscillate around a center point, and the oscillation creates gravitational ripples forming the shells of stars, similar to ripples spreading on water. For example, galaxy NGC 3923 has over 20 shells.\nSpirals.\nSpiral galaxies resemble spiraling pinwheels. Though the stars and other visible material contained in such a galaxy lie mostly on a plane, the majority of mass in spiral galaxies exists in a roughly spherical halo of dark matter which extends beyond the visible component, as demonstrated by the universal rotation curve concept.\nSpiral galaxies consist of a rotating disk of stars and interstellar medium, along with a central bulge of generally older stars. Extending outward from the bulge are relatively bright arms. In the Hubble classification scheme, spiral galaxies are listed as type \"S\", followed by a letter (\"a\", \"b\", or \"c\") which indicates the degree of tightness of the spiral arms and the size of the central bulge. An \"Sa\" galaxy has tightly wound, poorly defined arms and possesses a relatively large core region. At the other extreme, an \"Sc\" galaxy has open, well-defined arms and a small core region. A galaxy with poorly defined arms is sometimes referred to as a flocculent spiral galaxy; in contrast to the grand design spiral galaxy that has prominent and well-defined spiral arms. The speed in which a galaxy rotates is thought to correlate with the flatness of the disc as some spiral galaxies have thick bulges, while others are thin and dense.\nIn spiral galaxies, the spiral arms do have the shape of approximate logarithmic spirals, a pattern that can be theoretically shown to result from a disturbance in a uniformly rotating mass of stars. Like the stars, the spiral arms rotate around the center, but they do so with constant angular velocity. The spiral arms are thought to be areas of high-density matter, or \"density waves\". As stars move through an arm, the space velocity of each stellar system is modified by the gravitational force of the higher density. (The velocity returns to normal after the stars depart on the other side of the arm.) This effect is akin to a \"wave\" of slowdowns moving along a highway full of moving cars. The arms are visible because the high density facilitates star formation, and therefore they harbor many bright and young stars.\nBarred spiral galaxy.\nA majority of spiral galaxies, including the Milky Way galaxy, have a linear, bar-shaped band of stars that extends outward to either side of the core, then merges into the spiral arm structure. In the Hubble classification scheme, these are designated by an \"SB\", followed by a lower-case letter (\"a\", \"b\" or \"c\") which indicates the form of the spiral arms (in the same manner as the categorization of normal spiral galaxies). Bars are thought to be temporary structures that can occur as a result of a density wave radiating outward from the core, or else due to a tidal interaction with another galaxy. Many barred spiral galaxies are active, possibly as a result of gas being channeled into the core along the arms.\nOur own galaxy, the Milky Way, is a large disk-shaped barred-spiral galaxy about 30\u00a0kiloparsecs in diameter and a kiloparsec thick. It contains about two hundred billion (2\u00d71011) stars and has a total mass of about six hundred billion (6\u00d71011) times the mass of the Sun.\nSuper-luminous spiral.\nRecently, researchers described galaxies called super-luminous spirals. They are very large with an upward diameter of 437,000 light-years (compared to the Milky Way's 87,400 light-year diameter). With a mass of 340 billion solar masses, they generate a significant amount of ultraviolet and mid-infrared light. They are thought to have an increased star formation rate around 30 times faster than the Milky Way.\nDwarfs.\nDespite the prominence of large elliptical and spiral galaxies, most galaxies are dwarf galaxies. They are relatively small when compared with other galactic formations, being about one hundredth the size of the Milky Way, with only a few billion stars. Blue compact dwarf galaxies contains large clusters of young, hot, massive stars. Ultra-compact dwarf galaxies have been discovered that are only 100\u00a0parsecs across.\nMany dwarf galaxies may orbit a single larger galaxy; the Milky Way has at least a dozen such satellites, with an estimated 300\u2013500 yet to be discovered.\nMost of the information we have about dwarf galaxies come from observations of the Local Group, containing two spiral galaxies, the Milky Way and Andromeda, and many dwarf galaxies. These dwarf galaxies are classified as either irregular or dwarf elliptical/dwarf spheroidal galaxies.\nA study of 27 Milky Way neighbors found that in all dwarf galaxies, the central mass is approximately 10 million solar masses, regardless of whether it has thousands or millions of stars. This suggests that galaxies are largely formed by dark matter, and that the minimum size may indicate a form of warm dark matter incapable of gravitational coalescence on a smaller scale.\nVariants.\nInteracting.\nInteractions between galaxies are relatively frequent, and they can play an important role in galactic evolution. Near misses between galaxies result in warping distortions due to tidal interactions, and may cause some exchange of gas and dust.\nCollisions occur when two galaxies pass directly through each other and have sufficient relative momentum not to merge. The stars of interacting galaxies usually do not collide, but the gas and dust within the two forms interacts, sometimes triggering star formation. A collision can severely distort the galaxies' shapes, forming bars, rings or tail-like structures.\nAt the extreme of interactions are galactic mergers, where the galaxies' relative momentums are insufficient to allow them to pass through each other. Instead, they gradually merge to form a single, larger galaxy. Mergers can result in significant changes to the galaxies' original morphology. If one of the galaxies is much more massive than the other, the result is known as cannibalism, where the more massive larger galaxy remains relatively undisturbed, and the smaller one is torn apart. The Milky Way galaxy is currently in the process of cannibalizing the Sagittarius Dwarf Elliptical Galaxy and the Canis Major Dwarf Galaxy.\nStarburst.\nStars are created within galaxies from a reserve of cold gas that forms giant molecular clouds. Some galaxies have been observed to form stars at an exceptional rate, which is known as a \"starburst\". If they continue to do so, they would consume their reserve of gas in a time span less than the galaxy's lifespan. Hence starburst activity usually lasts only about ten million years, a relatively brief period in a galaxy's history. Starburst galaxies were more common during the universe's early history, but still contribute an estimated 15% to total star production.\nStarburst galaxies are characterized by dusty concentrations of gas and the appearance of newly formed stars, including massive stars that ionize the surrounding clouds to create H II regions. These stars produce supernova explosions, creating expanding remnants that interact powerfully with the surrounding gas. These outbursts trigger a chain reaction of star-building that spreads throughout the gaseous region. Only when the available gas is nearly consumed or dispersed does the activity end.\nStarbursts are often associated with merging or interacting galaxies. The prototype example of such a starburst-forming interaction is M82, which experienced a close encounter with the larger M81. Irregular galaxies often exhibit spaced knots of starburst activity.\nRadio galaxy.\nA radio galaxy is a galaxy with giant regions of radio emission extending well beyond its visible structure. These energetic radio lobes are powered by jets from its active galactic nucleus. Radio galaxies are classified according to their Fanaroff\u2013Riley classification. The FR I class have lower radio luminosity and exhibit structures which are more elongated; the FR II class are higher radio luminosity. The correlation of radio luminosity and structure suggests that the sources in these two types of galaxies may differ.\nRadio galaxies can also be classified as giant radio galaxies (GRGs), whose radio emissions can extend to scales of megaparsecs (3.26 million light-years). Alcyoneus is an FR II class low-excitation radio galaxy which has the largest observed radio emission, with lobed structures spanning 5 megaparsecs (16\u00d7106 ly). For comparison, another similarly sized giant radio galaxy is 3C 236, with lobes 15 million light-years across. It should however be noted that radio emissions are \"not\" always considered part of the main galaxy itself.\nA giant radio galaxy is a special class of objects characterized by the presence of radio lobes generated by relativistic jets powered by the central galaxy's supermassive black hole. Giant radio galaxies are different from ordinary radio galaxies in that they can extend to much larger scales, reaching upwards to several megaparsecs across, far larger than the diameters of their host galaxies.\nA \"normal\" radio galaxy do not have a source that is a supermassive black hole or monster neutron star; instead the source is synchrotron radiation from relativistic electrons accelerated by supernova. These sources are comparatively short lived, making the radio spectrum from normal radio galaxies an especially good way to study star formation.\nActive galaxy.\nSome observable galaxies are classified as \"active\" if they contain an active galactic nucleus (AGN). A significant portion of the galaxy's total energy output is emitted by the active nucleus instead of its stars, dust and interstellar medium. There are multiple classification and naming schemes for AGNs, but those in the lower ranges of luminosity are called Seyfert galaxies, while those with luminosities much greater than that of the host galaxy are known as quasi-stellar objects or quasars. Models of AGNs suggest that a significant fraction of their light is shifted to far-infrared frequencies because optical and UV emission in the nucleus is absorbed and remitted by dust and gas surrounding it.\nThe standard model for an active galactic nucleus is based on an accretion disc that forms around a supermassive black hole (SMBH) at the galaxy's core region. The radiation from an active galactic nucleus results from the gravitational energy of matter as it falls toward the black hole from the disc. The AGN's luminosity depends on the SMBH's mass and the rate at which matter falls onto it.\nIn about 10% of these galaxies, a diametrically opposed pair of energetic jets ejects particles from the galaxy core at velocities close to the speed of light. The mechanism for producing these jets is not well understood.\nSeyfert galaxy.\nSeyfert galaxies are one of the two largest groups of active galaxies, along with quasars. They have quasar-like nuclei (very luminous, distant and bright sources of electromagnetic radiation) with very high surface brightnesses; but unlike quasars, their host galaxies are clearly detectable. Seen through a telescope, a Seyfert galaxy appears like an ordinary galaxy with a bright star superimposed atop the core. Seyfert galaxies are divided into two principal subtypes based on the frequencies observed in their spectra.\nQuasar.\nQuasars are the most energetic and distant members of active galactic nuclei. Extremely luminous, they were first identified as high redshift sources of electromagnetic energy, including radio waves and visible light, that appeared more similar to stars than to extended sources similar to galaxies. Their luminosity can be 100 times that of the Milky Way. The nearest known quasar, Markarian 231, is about 581 million light-years from Earth, while others have been discovered as far away as UHZ1, roughly 13.2 billion light-years distant. Quasars are noteworthy for providing the first demonstration of the phenomenon that gravity can act as a lens for light.\nOther AGNs.\nBlazars are believed to be active galaxies with a relativistic jet pointed in the direction of Earth. A radio galaxy emits radio frequencies from relativistic jets. A unified model of these types of active galaxies explains their differences based on the observer's position.\nPossibly related to active galactic nuclei (as well as starburst regions) are low-ionization nuclear emission-line regions (LINERs). The emission from LINER-type galaxies is dominated by weakly ionized elements. The excitation sources for the weakly ionized lines include post-AGB stars, AGN, and shocks. Approximately one-third of nearby galaxies are classified as containing LINER nuclei.\nLuminous infrared galaxy.\nLuminous infrared galaxies (LIRGs) are galaxies with luminosities\u2014the measurement of electromagnetic power output\u2014above 1011 L\u2609 (solar luminosities). In most cases, most of their energy comes from large numbers of young stars which heat surrounding dust, which reradiates the energy in the infrared. Luminosity high enough to be a LIRG requires a star formation rate of at least 18\u00a0M\u2609\u00a0yr\u22121. Ultra-luminous infrared galaxies (ULIRGs) are at least ten times more luminous still and form stars at rates &gt;180\u00a0M\u2609\u00a0yr\u22121. Many LIRGs also emit radiation from an AGN. Infrared galaxies emit more energy in the infrared than all other wavelengths combined, with peak emission typically at wavelengths of 60 to 100 microns. LIRGs are believed to be created from the strong interaction and merger of spiral galaxies. While uncommon in the local universe, LIRGs and ULIRGS were more prevalent when the universe was younger.\nPhysical diameters.\nGalaxies do not have a definite boundary by their nature, and are characterized by a gradually decreasing stellar density as a function of increasing distance from their center, making measurements of their true extents difficult. Nevertheless, astronomers over the past few decades have made several criteria in defining the sizes of galaxies.\nAngular diameter.\nAs early as the time of Edwin Hubble in 1936, there have been attempts to characterize the diameters of galaxies. The earliest efforts were based on the observed angle subtended by the galaxy and its estimated distance, leading to an \"angular diameter\" (also called \"metric diameter\").\nIsophotal diameter.\nThe \"isophotal diameter\" is introduced as a conventional way of measuring a galaxy's size based on its apparent surface brightness. Isophotes are curves in a diagram - such as a picture of a galaxy - that adjoins points of equal brightnesses, and are useful in defining the extent of the galaxy. The apparent brightness flux of a galaxy is measured in units of magnitudes per square arcsecond (mag/arcsec2; sometimes expressed as \"mag arcsec\u22122\"), which defines the brightness depth of the isophote. To illustrate how this unit works, a typical galaxy has a brightness flux of 18 mag/arcsec2 at its central region. This brightness is equivalent to the light of an 18th magnitude hypothetical point object (like a star) being spread out evenly in a one square arcsecond area of the sky. The isophotal diameter is typically defined as the region enclosing all the light down to 25 mag/arcsec2 in the blue B-band, which is then referred to as the D25 standard.\nEffective radius (half-light) and its variations.\nThe half-light radius (also known as \"effective radius\"; R\"e\") is a measure that is based on the galaxy's overall brightness flux. This is the radius upon which half, or 50%, of the total brightness flux of the galaxy was emitted. This was first proposed by G\u00e9rard de Vaucouleurs in 1948. The choice of using 50% was arbitrary, but proved to be useful in further works by R. A. Fish in 1963, where he established a luminosity concentration law that relates the brightnesses of elliptical galaxies and their respective R\"e\", and by Jos\u00e9 Luis S\u00e9rsic in 1968 that defined a mass-radius relation in galaxies.\nIn defining R\"e\", it is necessary that the overall brightness flux galaxy should be captured, with a method employed by Bershady in 2000 suggesting to measure twice the size where the brightness flux of an arbitrarily chosen radius, defined as the local flux, divided by the overall average flux equals to 0.2. Using half-light radius allows a rough estimate of a galaxy's size, but is not particularly helpful in determining its morphology.\nVariations of this method exist. In particular, in the ESO-Uppsala Catalogue of Galaxies values of 50%, 70%, and 90% of the total blue light (the light detected through a B-band specific filter) had been used to calculate a galaxy's diameter.\nPetrosian magnitude.\nFirst described by Vahe Petrosian in 1976, a modified version of this method has been used by the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). This method employs a mathematical model on a galaxy whose radius is determined by the azimuthally (horizontal) averaged profile of its brightness flux. In particular, the SDSS employed the Petrosian magnitude in the R-band (658\u00a0nm, in the red part of the visible spectrum) to ensure that the brightness flux of a galaxy would be captured as much as possible while counteracting the effects of background noise. For a galaxy whose brightness profile is exponential, it is expected to capture all of its brightness flux, and 80% for galaxies that follow a profile that follows de Vaucouleurs's law.\nPetrosian magnitudes have the advantage of being redshift and distance independent, allowing the measurement of the galaxy's apparent size since the Petrosian radius is defined in terms of the galaxy's overall luminous flux.\nA critique of an earlier version of this method has been issued by the Infrared Processing and Analysis Center, with the method causing a magnitude of error (upwards to 10%) of the values than using isophotal diameter. The use of Petrosian magnitudes also have the disadvantage of missing most of the light outside the Petrosian aperture, which is defined relative to the galaxy's overall brightness profile, especially for elliptical galaxies, with higher signal-to-noise ratios on higher distances and redshifts. A correction for this method has been issued by Graham \"et al.\" in 2005, based on the assumption that galaxies follow S\u00e9rsic's law.\nNear-infrared method.\nThis method has been used by 2MASS as an adaptation from the previously used methods of isophotal measurement. Since 2MASS operates in the near infrared, which has the advantage of being able to recognize dimmer, cooler, and older stars, it has a different form of approach compared to other methods that normally use B-filter. The detail of the method used by 2MASS has been described thoroughly in a document by Jarrett \"et al.\", with the survey measuring several parameters.\nThe standard aperture ellipse (area of detection) is defined by the infrared isophote at the Ks band (roughly 2.2 \u03bcm wavelength) of 20 mag/arcsec2. Gathering the overall luminous flux of the galaxy has been employed by at least four methods: the first being a circular aperture extending 7 arcseconds from the center, an isophote at 20 mag/arcsec2, a \"total\" aperture defined by the radial light distribution that covers the supposed extent of the galaxy, and the Kron aperture (defined as 2.5 times the first-moment radius, an integration of the flux of the \"total\" aperture).\nLarger-scale structures.\nDeep-sky surveys show that galaxies are often found in groups and clusters. Solitary galaxies that have not significantly interacted with other galaxies of comparable mass in the past few billion years are relatively scarce. Only about 5% of the galaxies surveyed are isolated in this sense. However, they may have interacted and even merged with other galaxies in the past, and may still be orbited by smaller satellite galaxies.\nOn the largest scale, the universe is continually expanding, resulting in an average increase in the separation between individual galaxies (see Hubble's law). Associations of galaxies can overcome this expansion on a local scale through their mutual gravitational attraction. These associations formed early, as clumps of dark matter pulled their respective galaxies together. Nearby groups later merged to form larger-scale clusters. This ongoing merging process, as well as an influx of infalling gas, heats the intergalactic gas in a cluster to very high temperatures of 30\u2013100 megakelvins. About 70\u201380% of a cluster's mass is in the form of dark matter, with 10\u201330% consisting of this heated gas and the remaining few percent in the form of galaxies.\nMost galaxies are gravitationally bound to a number of other galaxies. These form a fractal-like hierarchical distribution of clustered structures, with the smallest such associations being termed groups. A group of galaxies is the most common type of galactic cluster; these formations contain the majority of galaxies (as well as most of the baryonic mass) in the universe. To remain gravitationally bound to such a group, each member galaxy must have a sufficiently low velocity to prevent it from escaping (see Virial theorem). If there is insufficient kinetic energy, however, the group may evolve into a smaller number of galaxies through mergers.\nClusters of galaxies consist of hundreds to thousands of galaxies bound together by gravity. Clusters of galaxies are often dominated by a single giant elliptical galaxy, known as the brightest cluster galaxy, which, over time, tidally destroys its satellite galaxies and adds their mass to its own.\nSuperclusters contain tens of thousands of galaxies, which are found in clusters, groups and sometimes individually. At the supercluster scale, galaxies are arranged into sheets and filaments surrounding vast empty voids. Above this scale, the universe appears to be the same in all directions (isotropic and homogeneous), though this notion has been challenged in recent years by numerous findings of large-scale structures that appear to be exceeding this scale. The Hercules\u2013Corona Borealis Great Wall, currently the largest structure in the universe found so far, is 10 billion light-years (three gigaparsecs) in length.\nThe Milky Way galaxy is a member of an association named the Local Group, a relatively small group of galaxies that has a diameter of approximately one\u00a0megaparsec. The Milky Way and the Andromeda Galaxy are the two brightest galaxies within the group; many of the other member galaxies are dwarf companions of these two. The Local Group itself is a part of a cloud-like structure within the Virgo Supercluster, a large, extended structure of groups and clusters of galaxies centered on the Virgo Cluster. In turn, the Virgo Supercluster is a portion of the Laniakea Supercluster.\nMagnetic fields.\nGalaxies have magnetic fields of their own. A galaxy's magnetic field influences its dynamics in multiple ways, including affecting the formation of spiral arms and transporting angular momentum in gas clouds. The latter effect is particularly important, as it is a necessary factor for the gravitational collapse of those clouds, and thus for star formation.\nThe typical average equipartition strength for spiral galaxies is about 10 \u03bcG (microgauss) or 1nT (nanotesla). By comparison, the Earth's magnetic field has an average strength of about 0.3 G (Gauss) or 30 \u03bcT (microtesla). Radio-faint galaxies like M 31 and M33, the Milky Way's neighbors, have weaker fields (about 5\u03bcG), while gas-rich galaxies with high star-formation rates, like M 51, M 83 and NGC 6946, have 15 \u03bcG on average. In prominent spiral arms, the field strength can be up to 25 \u03bcG, in regions where cold gas and dust are also concentrated. The strongest total equipartition fields (50\u2013100 \u03bcG) were found in starburst galaxies\u2014for example, in M 82 and the Antennae; and in nuclear starburst regions, such as the centers of NGC 1097 and other barred galaxies.\nFormation and evolution.\nFormation.\nCurrent models of the formation of galaxies in the early universe are based on the \u039bCDM model. About 300,000 years after the Big Bang, atoms of hydrogen and helium began to form, in an event called recombination. Nearly all the hydrogen was neutral (non-ionized) and readily absorbed light, and no stars had yet formed. As a result, this period has been called the \"dark ages\". It was from density fluctuations (or anisotropic irregularities) in this primordial matter that larger structures began to appear. As a result, masses of baryonic matter started to condense within cold dark matter halos. These primordial structures allowed gasses to condense in to protogalaxies, large scale gas clouds that were precursors to the first galaxies.\nAs gas falls in to the gravity of the dark matter halos, its pressure and temperature rise. To condense further, the gas must radiate energy. This process was slow in the early universe dominated by hydrogen atoms and molecules which are inefficient radiators compared to heavier elements. As clumps of gas aggregate forming rotating disks, temperatures and pressures continue to increase. Some places within the disk reach high enough density to form stars.\nOnce protogalaxies began to form and contract, the first halo stars, called Population III stars, appeared within them. These were composed of primordial gas, almost entirely of hydrogen and helium.\nEmission from the first stars heats the remaining gas helping to trigger additional star formation; the ultraviolet light emission from the first generation of stars re-ionized the surrounding neutral hydrogen in expanding spheres eventually reaching the entire universe, an event called reionization. The most massive stars collapse in violent supernova explosions releasing heavy elements (\"metals\") into the interstellar medium. This metal content is incorporated into population II stars.\nTheoretical models for early galaxy formation have been verified and informed by a large number and variety of sophisticated astronomical observations. The photometric observations generally need spectroscopic confirmation due the large number mechanisms that can introduce systematic errors. For example, a high redshift (z ~ 16) photometric observation by James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) was later corrected to be closer to z ~ 5.\nNevertheless, confirmed observations from the JWST and other observatories are accumulating, allowing systematic comparison of early galaxies to predictions of theory.\nEvidence for individual Population III stars in early galaxies is even more challenging. Even seemingly confirmed spectroscopic evidence may turn out to have other origins. For example, astronomers reported HeII emission evidence for Population III stars in the Cosmos Redshift 7 galaxy, with a redshift value of 6.60. Subsequent observations found metallic emission lines, OIII, inconsistent with an early-galaxy star.\nEvolution.\nOnce stars begin to form, emit radiation, and in some cases explode, the process of galaxy formation becomes very complex, involving interactions between the forces of gravity, radiation, and thermal energy. Many details are still poorly understood.\nWithin a billion years of a galaxy's formation, key structures begin to appear. Globular clusters, the central supermassive black hole, and a galactic bulge of metal-poor Population II stars form. The creation of a supermassive black hole appears to play a key role in actively regulating the growth of galaxies by limiting the total amount of additional matter added. During this early epoch, galaxies undergo a major burst of star formation.\nDuring the following two billion years, the accumulated matter settles into a galactic disc. A galaxy will continue to absorb infalling material from high-velocity clouds and dwarf galaxies throughout its life. This matter is mostly hydrogen and helium. The cycle of stellar birth and death slowly increases the abundance of heavy elements, eventually allowing the formation of planets.\nStar formation rates in galaxies depend upon their local environment. Isolated 'void' galaxies have highest rate per stellar mass, with 'field' galaxies associated with spiral galaxies having lower rates and galaxies in dense cluster having the lowest rates.\nThe evolution of galaxies can be significantly affected by interactions and collisions. Mergers of galaxies were common during the early epoch, and the majority of galaxies were peculiar in morphology. Given the distances between the stars, the great majority of stellar systems in colliding galaxies will be unaffected. However, gravitational stripping of the interstellar gas and dust that makes up the spiral arms produces a long train of stars known as tidal tails. Examples of these formations can be seen in NGC 4676 or the Antennae Galaxies.\nThe Milky Way galaxy and the nearby Andromeda Galaxy are moving toward each other at about 130\u00a0km/s, and\u2014depending upon the lateral movements\u2014the two might collide in about five to six billion years. Although the Milky Way has never collided with a galaxy as large as Andromeda before, it has collided and merged with other galaxies in the past. Cosmological simulations indicate that, 11 billion years ago, it merged with a particularly large galaxy that has been labeled the Kraken.\nSuch large-scale interactions are rare. As time passes, mergers of two systems of equal size become less common. Most bright galaxies have remained fundamentally unchanged for the last few billion years, and the net rate of star formation probably also peaked about ten billion years ago.\nFuture trends.\nSpiral galaxies, like the Milky Way, produce new generations of stars as long as they have dense molecular clouds of interstellar hydrogen in their spiral arms. Elliptical galaxies are largely devoid of this gas, and so form few new stars. The supply of star-forming material is finite; once stars have converted the available supply of hydrogen into heavier elements, new star formation will come to an end.\nThe current era of star formation is expected to continue for up to one hundred billion years, and then the \"stellar age\" will wind down after about ten trillion to one hundred trillion years (1013\u20131014\u00a0years), as the smallest, longest-lived stars in the visible universe, tiny red dwarfs, begin to fade. At the end of the stellar age, galaxies will be composed of compact objects: brown dwarfs, white dwarfs that are cooling or cold (\"black dwarfs\"), neutron stars, and black holes. Eventually, as a result of gravitational relaxation, all stars will either fall into central supermassive black holes or be flung into intergalactic space as a result of collisions.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Considered one of the greatest actors of his generation and a paragon of the New Hollywood movement, Hackman's mainstream acting career spanned over four decades. He received several accolades, including two Academy Awards, two British Academy Film Awards, and four Golden Globe Awards. \nHackman made his credited film debut in the drama \"Lilith\" (1964). He later won two Academy Awards, his first for Best Actor for his role as Jimmy \"Popeye\" Doyle in William Friedkin's action thriller \"The French Connection\" (1971) and his second for Best Supporting Actor for playing a villainous sheriff in Clint Eastwood's Western \"Unforgiven\" (1992). He was Oscar-nominated for playing Buck Barrow in the crime drama \"Bonnie and Clyde\" (1967), a college professor in the drama \"I Never Sang for My Father\" (1970) and an FBI agent in the historical drama \"Mississippi Burning\" (1988).\nHackman gained further fame for his portrayal of Lex Luthor in three of the \"Superman\" films from 1978 to 1987. He also acted in \"The Poseidon Adventure\" (1972), \"Scarecrow\" (1973), \"The Conversation\" (1974), \"Night Moves\" (1975), \"A Bridge Too Far\" (1977), \"Under Fire\" (1983), \"Hoosiers\" (1986), \"The Firm\" (1993), \"Wyatt Earp\" (1994), \"Crimson Tide\" (1995), \"The Quick and the Dead\" (1995), \"Get Shorty\" (1995), \"The Birdcage\" (1996), \"Absolute Power\" (1997), \"Antz\" (1998), \"Enemy of the State\" (1998), \"The Royal Tenenbaums\" (2001), and \"Runaway Jury\" (2003). He retired from acting after starring in \"Welcome to Mooseport\" (2004), venturing into writing novels and occasionally providing narration for television documentaries until 2017.\nEarly life and military service.\nEugene Allen Hackman was born on January 30, 1930, in San Bernardino, California, to Anna Lyda Elizabeth (n\u00e9e\u00a0Gray) and Eugene Ezra Hackman. He had a brother named Richard. Anna, an actress, painter, and pianist who worked as a waitress, was born in Sarnia, Ontario, Canada. The family moved frequently before eventually settling in Danville, Illinois, where they lived in the house of Anna's English-born mother, Beatrice. Eugene Sr. operated the printing press for the \"Commercial-News\", a local newspaper. Hackman later stated that he decided to become an actor at the age of 10. When Hackman was 13 years old, Eugene Sr. divorced Anna and left the family.\nHackman spent his sophomore year at Storm Lake High School in Storm Lake, Iowa. He left home at the age of 16, lied about his age to enlist in the U.S. Marine Corps, and served four and a half years as a field radio operator. Hackman was stationed in China (Qingdao and later in Shanghai) as part of Operation Beleaguer. He later stated that part of his role there was destroying Japanese military equipment so that Communist revolutionaries did not capture it. After the Communists conquered the mainland in 1949, he was reassigned to Hawaii and Japan. After his discharge in 1951, Hackman moved to New York City, where he worked at various jobs. In 1962, Anna died in a fire she had accidentally started while smoking. Hackman began a study of journalism and television production at the University of Illinois under the G.I. Bill but left without graduating and moved back to California.\nCareer.\n1956\u20131969: Career beginnings.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\nActing was something I wanted to do since I was 10 and saw my first movie, I was so captured by the action guys. Jimmy Cagney was my favorite. Without realizing it, I could see he had tremendous timing and vitality.\n\u2014Gene Hackman\nIn 1956, Hackman began pursuing an acting career. He joined the Pasadena Playhouse in California, where he befriended another aspiring actor, Dustin Hoffman. Already seen as outsiders by their classmates, Hackman and Hoffman were voted \"the least likely to succeed\",7 and Hackman got the lowest score the Pasadena Playhouse had yet given. Determined to prove them wrong, Hackman moved to New York City. A 2004 article in \"Vanity Fair\" described Hackman, Hoffman, and Robert Duvall as struggling California-born actors and close friends, sharing New York apartments in various two-person combinations in the 1960s.\nTo support himself between acting jobs, Hackman was working at a Howard Johnson's restaurant when he encountered an instructor from the Pasadena Playhouse, who said that his job proved that Hackman \"wouldn't amount to anything.\" A Marine officer who saw him as a doorman said, \"Hackman, you're a sorry son of a bitch.\" Rejection motivated Hackman, who said:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;It was more psychological warfare, because I wasn't going to let those fuckers get me down. I insisted with myself that I would continue to do whatever it took to get a job. It was like me against them, and in some way, unfortunately, I still feel that way. But I think if you're really interested in acting there is a part of you that relishes the struggle. It's a narcotic in the way that you are trained to do this work and nobody will let you do it, so you're a little bit nuts. You lie to people, you cheat, you do whatever it takes to get an audition, get a job.\nHackman began performing in several Off-Broadway plays, starting with \"Witness for the Prosecution\" in 1957 at the Gateway Playhouse in Bellport, New York, and including \"Come to the Palace of Sin\" in 1963. He got various bit roles, for example, in the film \"Mad Dog Coll\" and on multiple television series: \"Tallahassee 7000\", \"The United States Steel Hour\", \"Route 66\", \"Naked City\", \"The Defenders\", \"The DuPont Show of the Week\", \"East Side/West Side\", and \"Brenner\". In 1963, he made his Broadway debut in \"Children From Their Games\", which had only a short run, as did \"A Rainy Day in Newark\". However, \"Any Wednesday\" with actress Sandy Dennis was a huge Broadway success in 1964. This opened the door to film work. His first credited role was in \"Lilith\", with Jean Seberg and Warren Beatty in the leading roles.\nHackman returned to Broadway in \"Poor Richard\" (1964\u201365) by Jean Kerr, which ran for over a hundred performances. He continued to do television \u2013 \"The Trials of O'Brien\", \"Hawk\", and \"The F.B.I.\" \u2013 and had a small part as Dr. John Whipple in the epic film \"Hawaii.\" He had small roles in features like \"First to Fight\" (1967), \"A Covenant with Death\" (1967), and \"Banning\" (1967). Hackman was originally cast as Mr. Robinson in the 1967 Mike Nichols independent romantic comedy film \"The Graduate\", but Nichols fired him three weeks into rehearsal for being \"too young\" for the role; he was replaced by Murray Hamilton. Also in 1967, he appeared in an episode of the television series \"The Invaders\" entitled \"The Spores\" and as Buck Barrow in 1967's biographical crime drama \"Bonnie and Clyde\", which earned him an Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actor.\nA return to Broadway that same year, \"The Natural Look\", ran for just one performance. Additionally, he performed Off-Broadway in \"Fragments and The Basement\". Hackman was in episodes of \"Iron Horse\" (\"Leopards Try, But Leopards Can't\") and \"Insight\" (\"Confrontation\"). In 1968, he appeared in an episode of \"I Spy\", in the role of \"Hunter\", in the episode \"Happy Birthday... Everybody\". That same year, he starred in the \"CBS Playhouse\" episode \"My Father and My Mother\" and the dystopian television film \"Shadow on the Land\". In 1969, he played a ski coach in \"Downhill Racer\" and an astronaut in \"Marooned\". Also that year, he played a member of a barnstorming skydiving team that entertained mostly at county fairs, a film which also inspired many to pursue skydiving and has a cult-like status amongst skydivers as a result: \"The Gypsy Moths\". Hackman supported Jim Brown in two films, \"The Split\" (1968) and \"Riot\" (1969). Hackman nearly accepted the role of Mike Brady for the TV series \"The Brady Bunch\", but his agent advised that he decline it in exchange for a more promising role, which he did, but this story is said to have been exaggerated.\n1970\u20131979: Breakthrough and stardom.\nHackman was nominated for a second Oscar for an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for his role in the drama film \"I Never Sang for My Father\" (1970), directed by Gilbert Cates. Hackman acted opposite Melvyn Douglas, where they played father and son who are unable to communicate. Roger Ebert wrote of his performance, \"Much of the film is just between the two of them and the characters seem to work so well because Douglas and Hackman respond to each other in every shot; the effect is not of acting, but as if the story were happening right now while we see it.\" He starred in the drama \"Doctors' Wives\" (1971) and the western film \"The Hunting Party\" (1971). He won his first Academy Award for Best Actor for his performance as New York City Police Detective Jimmy \"Popeye\" Doyle in the crime drama \"The French Connection\" (1971), directed by William Friedkin. This film marked his graduation to stardom. Robert B. Frederick of \"Variety\" praised the performances of Hackman and Roy Scheider, writing, \"They are very believable as two hard-nosed narcotics officers\" who are also \"overworked, tired and mean\".\nAfter \"The French Connection\", Hackman starred in ten films (not including his cameo as a blind man in the Mel Brooks-directed satirical horror comedy film \"Young Frankenstein\" in 1974) over the next three years, making him the most prolific actor in Hollywood during that time frame. He followed \"The French Connection\" with leading roles in the drama \"Cisco Pike\" (1972), the action crime thriller \"Prime Cut\" (1972), and the disaster film \"The Poseidon Adventure\" (1972). He also starred in the road comedy-drama \"Scarecrow\" (1973) alongside Al Pacino, which was Hackman's favorite role of his career and won the Palme d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival. The following year, he starred as a surveillance expert in the neo-noir mystery thriller \"The Conversation\" (1974), directed by Francis Ford Coppola, which was nominated for several Oscars and also won the Palme d'Or at the Cannes. That same year, Hackman appeared in what would become one of his most famous comedic roles, as Harold the Blind Man in \"Young Frankenstein\". Hackman also appeared in the western \"Zandy's Bride\" (1974) and the neo-noir film \"Night Moves\" (1975) for director Arthur Penn.\nHackman played one of Teddy Roosevelt's former Rough Riders in the Western horse-race saga \"Bite the Bullet\" (1975). He reprised his Oscar-winning role as Doyle in the sequel \"French Connection II\" (1975), for which he was nominated for the BAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Leading Role and the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor in a Motion Picture \u2013 Drama. He co-starred with Burt Reynolds and Liza Minnelli in the musical \"Lucky Lady\" (1975), directed by Stanley Donen, a notorious flop. After making the neo-noir thriller \"The Domino Principle\" (1977) for Stanley Kramer, Hackman was part of an all-star cast in the war film \"A Bridge Too Far\" (1977), playing Polish General Stanis\u0142aw Sosabowski, and was an officer in the French Foreign Legion in \"March or Die\" (1977). Hackman showed a talent for both comedy and the \"slow burn\" as criminal mastermind Lex Luthor opposite Christopher Reeve in the leading role in the superhero film ' (1978). Ron Pennington of \"The Hollywood Reporter\" wrote of his performance, \"Hackman plays Lex Luthor, 'the greatest criminal mind of our time,' with an effective light touch, making him humorous but not out-and-out comical.\" He reprised the role for two of its sequels, \"Superman II\" (1980) and ' (1987).\n1980\u20131999: Established career and acclaim.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\nGene is someone who is a very intuitive and instinctive actor\u00a0... The brilliance of Gene Hackman is that he can look at a scene and he can cut through to what is necessary, and he does it with extraordinary economy \u2013 he's the quintessential movie actor. He's never showy \"ever\", but he's always right on.\n \u2014Alan Parkerdirector of \"Mississippi Burning\" (1988)\nHackman alternated between leading and supporting roles during the 1980s. He appeared opposite Barbra Streisand in \"All Night Long\" (1981) and supported Warren Beatty in \"Reds\" (1981). He played the lead in \"Eureka\" (1983) and a supporting role in \"Under Fire\" (1983). Hackman provided the voice of God in \"Two of a Kind\" (1983) and starred in \"Uncommon Valor\" (1983), \"Misunderstood\" (1984), \"Twice in a Lifetime\" (1985), \"Target\" (1985) for Arthur Penn, and \"Power\" (1986). Between 1985 and 1988, he starred in nine films, making him the busiest actor, alongside Steve Guttenberg. Hackman played a high school basketball coach in \"Hoosiers\" (1986), which a 2008 American Film Institute poll named the fourth-greatest sports film of all time. After \"\" (1987), he also voiced Nuclear Man (who was portrayed by Mark Pillow) and was in \"No Way Out\" (1987), \"Split Decisions\" (1988), \"Bat*21\" (1988), and \"Full Moon in Blue Water\" (1988).\nHackman acted opposite Gena Rowlands in the Woody Allen drama \"Another Woman\" (1988). Hackman starred in the Alan Parker-directed crime drama \"Mississippi Burning\" (1988), costarring Willem Dafoe, where they portrayed FBI agents investigating the murder of 3 civil rights student activists. He earned acclaim for the role, with Roger Ebert praising his performance for his subtlety. He was nominated for a second Academy Award for Best Actor, losing to Dustin Hoffman for \"Rain Man\". After this he appeared in \"The Package\" (1989). Hackman starred in \"Loose Cannons\" (1990) with Dan Aykroyd, and he had a supporting role in \"Postcards from the Edge\" (1990). He appeared with Anne Archer in \"Narrow Margin\" (1990), a remake of the 1952 film \"The Narrow Margin\". After \"Class Action\" (1991) and \"Company Business\" (1991), Hackman played the sadistic sheriff \"Little Bill\" Daggett in the Western \"Unforgiven\", directed by Clint Eastwood and written by David Webb Peoples. Hackman had pledged to avoid violent roles, but Eastwood convinced him to take the part, which earned him a second Oscar, this time for Best Supporting Actor. The film also won Best Picture.\nHackman returned to Broadway, starring in the 1992 Ariel Dorfman play \"Death and the Maiden\", acting opposite Glenn Close and Richard Dreyfus at the Brooks Atkinson Theater. In 1993, he appeared in \"\" as Brigadier General George Crook and co-starred with Tom Cruise as a corrupt lawyer in \"The Firm\", a legal thriller based on the John Grisham novel of the same name. Hackman would appear in two other films based on John Grisham novels, playing Sam Cayhall, a Klansman on death row, in \"The Chamber\" (1996), and jury consultant Rankin Fitch in \"Runaway Jury\" (2003). Other films Hackman appeared in during the 1990s include \"Wyatt Earp\" (1994) (as Nicholas Porter Earp, \"Wyatt Earp\"'s father), \"The Quick and the Dead\" (1995) opposite Sharon Stone, Leonardo DiCaprio, and Russell Crowe, and as submarine Captain Frank Ramsey alongside Denzel Washington in \"Crimson Tide\" (1995).\nHackman played film producer Harry Zimm alongside John Travolta in the comedy-drama \"Get Shorty\" (1995). In 1996, he took a comedic turn as conservative Senator Kevin Keeley in \"The Birdcage\" with Robin Williams and Nathan Lane. He co-starred with Hugh Grant in \"Extreme Measures\" (1996) and reunited with Clint Eastwood in \"Absolute Power\" (1997). Hackman did \"Twilight\" (1998) with Paul Newman for director Robert Benton, voiced the villain in the DreamWorks' animated film \"Antz\" (1998), and co-starred with Will Smith in \"Enemy of the State\" (1998), his character reminiscent of the one he had portrayed in \"The Conversation\".\n2000\u20132004: Final films and retirement.\nHackman co-starred with Morgan Freeman in \"Under Suspicion\" (2000), Keanu Reeves in \"The Replacements\" (2000), Owen Wilson in \"Behind Enemy Lines\" (2001), and Sigourney Weaver in \"Heartbreakers\" (2001) and appeared in the David Mamet crime thriller \"Heist\" (2001) as an aging professional thief of considerable skill who is forced into one final job. He made a cameo in \"The Mexican\" (2001). Hackman gained much critical acclaim playing against type as the head of an eccentric family in Wes Anderson's comedy film \"The Royal Tenenbaums\" (2001). Frank Scheck of \"The Hollywood Reporter\" wrote, \"Hackman is utter perfection as the misbegotten paterfamilias, conveying beautifully Royal's underlying decency and love for his family as well as his con-man slickness.\" For his performance, he received the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor in a Motion Picture Musical or Comedy.\nIn 2003, he also starred in another John Grisham legal drama, \"Runaway Jury\", at long last getting to make a picture with his long-time friend Dustin Hoffman. In 2004, Hackman appeared alongside Ray Romano in the comedy \"Welcome to Mooseport\", his final film acting role. Hackman was honored with the Cecil B. DeMille Award from the Golden Globe Awards for his \"outstanding contribution to the entertainment field\" in 2003. Michael Caine and Robin Williams presented him with the award.\nIn July 2004, Hackman gave a rare interview to Larry King, where he announced that he had no future film projects lined up and believed his acting career was over. In 2008, while promoting his third novel, he confirmed that he had retired from acting. That year, Hackman made his last televised appearance in \"Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives\", as Guy Fieri went to a Santa Fe diner where Hackman was eating. Speaking on his retirement in 2009, Hackman said, \"The straw that broke the camel's back was actually a stress test that I took in New York. The doctor advised me that my heart wasn't in the kind of shape that I should be putting it under any stress.\" When asked during a \"GQ\" magazine interview in 2011 if he would ever come out of retirement to do one more film, he said he might consider it \"if I could do it in my own house, maybe, without them disturbing anything and just one or two people.\"\nOther work.\nTogether with undersea archaeologist Daniel Lenihan, Hackman wrote three historical fiction novels: \"Wake of the Perdido Star\" (1999), a sea adventure of the 19th century; \"Justice for None\" (2004), a Depression-era tale of murder based on a real-life crime in his boyhood town of Danville; and \"Escape from Andersonville\" (2008), about a prison escape during the American Civil War. His first solo effort, a story of love and revenge set in the Old West titled \"Payback at Morning Peak\", was released in 2011. His final novel, \"Pursuit\", a police thriller, followed in 2013.\nAfter retiring from acting, Hackman narrated four episodes of the NFL Films sports documentary series \"\" in 2007. He later narrated two documentaries related to the United States Marine Corps: \"The Unknown Flag Raiser of Iwo Jima\" (2016)\"\" and \"We, the Marines\" (2017)\".\"\nPersonal life.\nMarriages and family.\nIn 1956, Hackman married Faye Maltese (1928\u20132017), with whom he had one son and two daughters: Christopher Allen, Elizabeth Jean, and Leslie Anne Hackman. He was often out on location making films while the children were growing up. The couple divorced in 1986, after three decades of marriage.\nOn December 1, 1991, Hackman married classical pianist Betsy Arakawa (1959\u20132025) after they had dated for seven years. They shared a Santa Fe, New Mexico, home, which \"Architectural Digest\" featured in 1990. At the time, the home blended Southwestern styles and was at the crest of a 12-acre hilltop, with a 360-degree view that stretched to the Jemez, Sangre de Cristo, and Sandia mountains.\nViews and interests.\nHackman was a supporter of the Democratic Party and said he was \"proud\" to be included on Nixon's Enemies List. However, he spoke fondly about Republican president Ronald Reagan.\nIn the late 1970s, Hackman competed in Sports Car Club of America races, driving an open-wheeled Formula Ford. In 1980, he won the Long Beach Toyota Pro/Celebrity Race. He also drove a Dan Gurney Team Toyota in the 24 Hours of Daytona Endurance Race in 1983.\nHackman was a fan of the Jacksonville Jaguars, an NFL football team based in Jacksonville, Florida, and regularly attended Jaguars games as a guest of former head coach Jack Del Rio. Their friendship went back to Del Rio's playing days at the University of Southern California.\nHackman was also interested in architecture and design. As of 1990, he had created ten homes, two of which were featured in \"Architectural Digest\". After a period of time, he moved on to another house restoration. \"I don't know what's wrong with me,\" he remarked. \"I guess I like the process, and when it's over, it's over.\" Hackman was an active cyclist well into his 90s.\nHealth.\nIn 1990, Hackman underwent an angioplasty. In 2012, Hackman was struck by a pickup truck while he was cycling in the Florida Keys. It was initially reported that he had suffered serious head trauma; however, his publicist stated that his injury was nothing more than \"bumps and bruises\". Hackman attended an event in Santa Fe in late 2022. He was last seen in public in March 2024. After his death, autopsy reports revealed Hackman had Alzheimer's disease, which contributed to his death.\nDeath.\nIn the final months of his life, Hackman's neighbors in Santa Fe, New Mexico, noticed that his health appeared to be declining, and he and Arakawa ceased communicating with family and friends. Arakawa \u2013 who was Hackman's sole caregiver \u2013 was last seen alive at a CVS Pharmacy on February 11, 2025, and returned to their gated community at 5:15\u00a0p.m. On February 12, Arakawa called a local private physician and made an appointment for that afternoon, complaining of respiratory issues, but did not show up. Arakawa died in their home a short time later from hantavirus pulmonary syndrome. Hackman did not seek help; authorities believe he was unable to comprehend her death due to Alzheimer's disease. Hackman died in the home around February 18, at which point his pacemaker recorded an abnormal rhythm. He died from severe heart disease, complicated by advanced Alzheimer's disease and kidney disease, at the age of 95.\nOn February 26, the bodies of Hackman, Arakawa, and one of their dogs were found. Their other two dogs were found alive in the home. Although foul play was not suspected, the deaths were deemed suspicious enough to warrant an investigation.\nHackman's estate requested that the courts block images and videos related to the investigation, such as police body camera footage. Arakawa's will stated that if they were to die within 90 days of each other, the proceeds would go to charity; Hackman's will, created in 1995, listed Arakawa as his sole inheritor. In October 2025, it was announced that Bonhams would auction off Hackman's personal belongings, including his art collection, personal artworks, scripts, film memorabilia, and three of his Golden Globe Awards trophies.\nTributes and legacy.\nNumerous members of the film industry paid tribute to Hackman following his death. Clint Eastwood, who directed Hackman in the films \"Unforgiven\" (1992) and \"Absolute Power\" (1997), wrote in a statement: \"There was no finer actor than Gene. Intense and instinctive. Never a false note. He was also a dear friend whom I will miss very much.\" Francis Ford Coppola, who directed him in \"The Conversation\" (1974), wrote: \"Gene Hackman [was] a great actor, inspiring and magnificent in his work and complexity. I mourn his loss, and celebrate his existence and contribution.\" \nMorgan Freeman paid tribute to Hackman at the 97th Academy Awards, saying, \"Like everyone who ever shared a scene with him, I learned he was a generous performer whose gifts elevated everyone's work\" and that he would be \"remembered [as someone who did good work] and so much more.\" Others who paid tribute included Dustin Hoffman, Glenn Close, Tom Hanks, Viola Davis, Bill Murray, Mel Brooks, Alec Baldwin, Gwyneth Paltrow, Barbra Streisand, Nathan Lane, Josh Brolin, John Cusack, Ben Stiller, Antonio Banderas, Hank Azaria, George Takei, and Jennifer Love Hewitt. \"The Guardian\" film critic Peter Bradshaw wrote that Hackman's death marked the end of American new wave cinema. He described Hackman as \"really a star; in fact the star of every scene he was in \u2013 that tough, wised-up, intelligent, but unhandsome face perpetually on the verge of coolly unconcerned derision, or creased in a heartbreakingly fatherly, pained smile.\"\nAwards and nominations.\nHackman received two Academy Awards, two British Academy Film Awards, four Golden Globe Awards, and one Screen Actors Guild Award. He was recognized by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences for the following performances:\nAsteroid 55397 Hackman, discovered by Roy Tucker in 2001, was named in his honor. The official was published by the Minor Planet Center on May 18, 2019 (M.P.C. 114954)."}

Mendel was born in a German-speaking family in the Silesian part of the Austrian Empire (today's Czech Republic) and gained posthumous recognition as the founder of the modern science of genetics. Though farmers had known for millennia that crossbreeding of animals and plants could favor certain desirable traits, Mendel's pea plant experiments conducted between 1856 and 1863 established many of the rules of heredity, now referred to as the laws of Mendelian inheritance.\nMendel worked with seven characteristics of pea plants: plant height, pod shape and color, seed shape and color, and flower position and color. Taking seed color as an example, Mendel showed that when a true-breeding yellow pea and a true-breeding green pea were cross-bred, their offspring always produced yellow seeds. However, in the next generation, the green peas reappeared at a ratio of 1 green to 3 yellow. To explain this phenomenon, Mendel coined the terms \"recessive\" and \"dominant\" in reference to certain traits. In the preceding example, the green trait, which seems to have vanished in the first filial generation, is recessive, and the yellow is dominant. He published his work in 1866, demonstrating the actions of invisible \"factors\"\u2014now called genes\u2014in predictably determining the traits of an organism. The actual genes were only discovered in a long process that ended in 2025 when the last three of the seven Mendel genes were identified in the pea genome.\nThe profound significance of Mendel's work was not recognized until the turn of the 20th century (more than three decades later) with the rediscovery of his laws. Erich von Tschermak, Hugo de Vries and Carl Correns independently verified several of Mendel's experimental findings in 1900, ushering in the modern age of genetics. \nEarly life and education.\nMendel was born into a German-speaking family in Heinzendorf bei Odrau, in Silesia, Austrian Empire (now Hyn\u010dice in the Czech Republic). He was the son of Anton and Rosine (Schwirtlich) Mendel and had one older sister, Veronika, and one younger, Theresia. They lived and worked on a farm which had been owned by the Mendel family for at least 130 years (the house where Mendel was born is now a museum devoted to Mendel). During his childhood, Mendel worked as a gardener and studied beekeeping. As a young man, he attended gymnasium in Troppau (). Due to illness, he had to take four months off during his gymnasium studies. From 1840 to 1843, he studied practical and theoretical philosophy and physics at the Philosophical Institute of the University of Olomouc (), taking another year off because of illness. He also struggled financially to pay for his studies, and Theresia gave him her dowry. Later he helped support her three sons, two of whom became doctors.\nHe became a monk partly because it enabled him to obtain an education without paying for it himself. As the son of a struggling farmer, the monastic life, in his words, spared him the \"perpetual anxiety about a means of livelihood.\" Born Johann Mendel, he was given the name \"Gregor\" ( in Czech) when he joined the Order of Saint Augustine.\nAcademic career.\nWhen Mendel entered the Faculty of Philosophy, the Department of Natural History and Agriculture was headed by Johann Karl Nestler, who conducted extensive research on hereditary traits of plants and animals, especially sheep. Upon recommendation of his physics teacher Friedrich Franz, Mendel entered the Augustinian St Thomas's Abbey in Brno and began his training as a Catholic priest. Mendel worked as a substitute high school teacher. In 1850, he failed his exams' oral part, the last of three parts, to become a certified high school teacher. In 1851, he was sent to the University of Vienna to study under the sponsorship of Abbot Cyril Franti\u0161ek Napp so that he could get a more formal education. At Vienna, his professor of physics was Christian Doppler. Mendel returned to his abbey in 1853 as a teacher, principally of physics. In 1854 he met Aleksander Zawadzki who encouraged his research in Brno. In 1856, he took the exam to become a certified teacher and again failed the oral part. In the summer of 1862, he joined an organised group tour to Paris and London, where he visited the International Exhibition and major scientific sites, a trip that may have influenced the final stage of his hybridisation research. In 1867, he succeeded Napp as abbot of the monastery.\nAfter he was elevated as abbot in 1868, his scientific work largely ended, as Mendel became overburdened with administrative responsibilities, especially a dispute with the civil government over its attempt to impose special taxes on religious institutions. Mendel died on 6 January 1884, at the age of 61, in Brno, from chronic nephritis. Czech composer Leo\u0161 Jan\u00e1\u010dek played the organ at his funeral. After his death, the succeeding abbot burned all papers in Mendel's collection, to mark an end to the disputes over taxation. The exhumation of Mendel's corpse in 2021 delivered some physiognomic details like body height (). His genome was analysed, revealing that Mendel was predisposed to heart problems.\nContributions.\nExperiments on plant hybridization.\nMendel, known as the \"father of modern genetics,\" chose to study variation in plants in his monastery's experimental garden. Mendel was assisted in his experimental design by Aleksander Zawadzki while his superior abbot Napp wrote to discourage him, saying that the Bishop giggled when informed of the detailed genealogies of peas.\nAfter initial experiments with pea plants, Mendel settled on studying seven traits that seemed to be inherited independently of other traits: seed shape, flower color, seed coat tint, pod shape, unripe pod color, flower location, and plant height. He first focused on seed shape, which was either angular or round. Between 1856 and 1863 Mendel cultivated and tested some 28,000 plants, the majority of which were pea plants (\"Pisum sativum\"). This study showed that, when true-breeding different varieties were crossed to each other (e.g., tall plants fertilized by short plants), in the second generation, one in four pea plants had purebred recessive traits, two out of four were hybrids, and one out of four were purebred dominant. His experiments led him to make two generalizations, the Law of Segregation and the Law of Independent Assortment, which later came to be known as Mendel's Laws of Inheritance.\nInitial reception of Mendel's work.\nMendel presented his paper, (\"Experiments on Plant Hybridization\"), at two meetings of the Natural History Society of Brno in Moravia on 8 February and 8 March 1865. It generated a few favorable reports in local newspapers, but was ignored by the scientific community. When Mendel's paper was published in 1866 in , it was seen as essentially about hybridization rather than inheritance, had little impact, and was cited only about three times over the next thirty-five years. His paper was criticized then but is now considered a seminal work. Notably, Charles Darwin was not aware of Mendel's paper, and it is envisaged that if he had been aware of it, genetics as it exists now might have taken hold much earlier. Mendel's scientific biography thus provides an example of the failure of obscure, highly original innovators to receive the attention they deserve.\nRediscovery of Mendel's work.\nAbout forty scientists listened to Mendel's two groundbreaking lectures, but it would appear that they failed to understand the implications of his work. Later, he also carried on a correspondence with Carl N\u00e4geli, one of the leading biologists of the time, but N\u00e4geli also failed to appreciate Mendel's discoveries. At times, Mendel must have entertained doubts about his work, but not always: \"My time will come,\" he reportedly told a friend, Gustav von Niessl.\nDuring Mendel's lifetime, most biologists held the idea that all characteristics were passed to the next generation through blending inheritance (indeed, many effectively are), in which the traits from each parent are averaged. Instances of this phenomenon are now explained by the action of multiple genes with quantitative effects. Charles Darwin tried unsuccessfully to explain inheritance through a theory of pangenesis. It was not until the early 20th century that the importance of Mendel's ideas was realized.\nBy 1900, research aimed at finding a successful theory of discontinuous inheritance rather than blending inheritance led to independent duplication of his work by Hugo de Vries and Carl Correns and the rediscovery of Mendel's writings and laws. Both acknowledged Mendel's priority, and it is thought probable that de Vries did not understand the results he had found until after reading Mendel. Though Erich von Tschermak was originally also credited with rediscovery, this is no longer accepted because he did not understand Mendel's laws. Though de Vries later lost interest in Mendelism, other biologists started to establish modern genetics as a science. All three of these researchers, each from a different country, published their rediscovery of Mendel's work within a two-month span in the spring of 1900.\nMendel's results were quickly replicated, and genetic linkage quickly worked out. Biologists flocked to the theory; even though it was not yet applicable to many phenomena, it sought to give a genotypic understanding of heredity, which they felt was lacking in previous studies of heredity, which had focused on phenotypic approaches. Most prominent of these previous approaches was the biometric school of Karl Pearson and W. F. R. Weldon, which was based heavily on statistical studies of phenotype variation. The strongest opposition to this school came from William Bateson, who perhaps did the most in the early days of publicising the benefits of Mendel's theory (the word \"genetics\", and much of the discipline's other terminology, originated with Bateson). This debate between the biometricians and the Mendelians was extremely vigorous in the first two decades of the 20th century, with the biometricians claiming statistical and mathematical rigor, whereas the Mendelians claimed a better understanding of biology. Modern genetics shows that Mendelian heredity is, in fact, an inherently biological process, though not all genes of Mendel's experiments are yet understood.\nUltimately, the two approaches were combined, especially by work conducted by R. A. Fisher as early as 1918. The combination, in the 1930s and 1940s, of Mendelian genetics with Darwin's theory of natural selection resulted in the modern synthesis of evolutionary biology.\nIn the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China, Mendelian genetics was rejected in favor of Lamarckism under the state policy of Lysenkoism, leading to imprisonment and even execution of Mendelian geneticists as well as massive famines in both of those countries.\nModern analysis of the genes causing Mendel's pea phenotypes.\nMendel postulated that seven \"factors\" determine the features he studied in peas. These factors are called \"genes\" today, but the nature of these genes remained mysterious for more than a century. The effort to identify these genes lasted until 2025 when the last 3 genes were discovered. The seven genes are as follows (genes are abbreviated PsXYZ for \"Pisum sativum\", the scientific name of the pea): the \"wrinkled\" phenotype of peas (wild-type round) is caused by an insertion in the PsSBE1 gene. The \"yellow\" phenotype (wild-type: green) is caused by an insertion or mutation in the PsSGR gene. The \"white\" phenotype of the flower color (wild-type: \"purple\") is caused by a deletion in the PsbHLH gene. The \"dwarf\" phenotype is caused by the PsGA3ox1 gene while the pod color phenotype (\"yellow\" vs. \"green\") is caused by the PsChlG gene. Finally, the pod shape is determined by the PsCLE41 gene which causes the \"constricted\" or \"inflated\" phenotypes and the PsCIK2/3 gene causes the \"terminal\" and \"axial\" flower position.\nOther experiments.\nMendel also experimented with hawkweed (\"Hieracium\"). He published a report on his work with hawkweed, a group of plants of great interest to scientists at the time because of their diversity. However, the results of Mendel's inheritance study in hawkweeds were unlike those for peas; the first generation was very variable, and many of their offspring were identical to the maternal parent. In his correspondence with Carl N\u00e4geli he discussed his results but was unable to explain them. It was not appreciated until the end of the nineteenth century that many hawkweed species were apomictic, producing most of their seeds through an asexual process.\nMendel appears to have kept animals at the monastery, breeding bees in custom-designed bee hives. None of his results on bees survived, except for a passing mention in the reports of the Moravian Apiculture Society. All that is known definitely is that he used Cyprian and Carniolan bees, which were particularly aggressive, to the annoyance of other monks and visitors of the monastery, such that he was asked to get rid of them. Mendel, on the other hand, was fond of his bees and referred to them as \"my dearest little animals\".\nAfter his death, Mendel's colleagues remembered that he bred mice, crossing varieties of different size, although Mendel has left no record of any such work. A persistent myth has developed that Mendel turned his attention to plants only after Napp declared it unseemly for a celibate priest to closely observe rodent sex. In a 2022 biography, Daniel Fairbanks argued that Napp could hardly have given such a pronouncement, as Napp personally oversaw sheep breeding on the monastery's extensive agricultural estate. \nMendel also studied astronomy and meteorology, founding the 'Austrian Meteorological Society' in 1865. The majority of his published works were related to meteorology.\nHe also described novel plant species, and these are denoted with the botanical author abbreviation \"Mendel\".\nMendelian paradox.\nIn 1936, Ronald Fisher, a prominent statistician and population geneticist, reconstructed Mendel's experiments, analyzed results from the F2 (second filial) generation, and found the ratio of dominant to recessive phenotypes (e.g., yellow versus green peas; round versus wrinkled peas) to be implausibly and consistently too close to the expected ratio of 3 to 1. Fisher asserted that \"the data of most, if not all, of the experiments have been falsified to agree closely with Mendel's expectations\". Mendel's alleged observations, according to Fisher, were \"abominable,\" \"shocking,\" and \"cooked.\"\nOther scholars agree with Fisher that Mendel's various observations come uncomfortably close to Mendel's expectations. A. W. F. Edwards, for instance, remarks: \"One can applaud the lucky gambler; but when he is lucky again tomorrow, and the next day, and the following day, one is entitled to become a little suspicious\". Three other lines of evidence likewise lend support to the assertion that Mendel's results are indeed too good to be true.\nFisher's analysis gave rise to the Mendelian paradox: Mendel's reported data are, statistically speaking, too good to be true, yet \"everything we know about Mendel suggests that he was unlikely to engage in either deliberate fraud or in an unconscious adjustment of his observations\". Several writers have attempted to resolve this paradox.\nOne attempted explanation invokes confirmation bias. Fisher accused Mendel's experiments as \"biased strongly in the direction of agreement with expectation[...] to give the theory the benefit of the doubt\". In a 2004 article, J.W. Porteous concluded that Mendel's observations were indeed implausible. An explanation for Mendel's results based on tetrad pollen has been proposed, but reproduction of the experiments showed no evidence that the tetrad-pollen model explains any of the bias.\nAnother attempt to resolve the Mendelian paradox notes that a conflict may sometimes arise between the moral imperative of a bias-free recounting of one's factual observations and the even more important imperative of advancing scientific knowledge. Mendel might have felt compelled \"to simplify his data to meet real, or feared editorial objections.\" Such an action could be justified on moral grounds (and hence provide a resolution to the Mendelian paradox) since the alternative\u2014refusing to comply\u2014might have hindered the growth of scientific knowledge. Similarly, like so many other obscure innovators of science, Mendel, a little-known innovator of working-class background, had to \"break through the cognitive paradigms and social prejudices\" of his audience. If such a breakthrough \"could be best achieved by deliberately omitting some observations from his report and adjusting others to make them more palatable to his audience, such actions could be justified on moral grounds.\"\nDaniel L. Hartl and Daniel J. Fairbanks reject outright Fisher's statistical argument, suggesting that Fisher incorrectly interpreted Mendel's experiments. They find it likely that Mendel scored more than ten progeny and that the results matched the expectation. They conclude: \"Fisher's allegation of deliberate falsification can finally be put to rest, because on closer analysis it has proved to be unsupported by convincing evidence\". In 2008 Hartl and Fairbanks (with Allan Franklin and AWF Edwards) wrote a comprehensive book in which they concluded that there were no reasons to assert Mendel fabricated his results, nor that Fisher deliberately tried to diminish Mendel's legacy. Reassessment of Fisher's statistical analysis, according to these authors, also disproves the notion of confirmation bias in Mendel's results.\nCommemoration.\nMount Mendel in New Zealand's Paparoa Range was named after him in 1970 by the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research. In celebration of his 200th birthday, Mendel's body was exhumed and his DNA sequenced.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "12564", "revid": "1304880970", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=12564", "title": "Grappling", "text": "Range of techniques used in many disciplines, styles and martial arts\nGrappling is a fighting technique based on throws, trips, sweeps, clinch fighting, ground fighting and submission holds.\nGrappling contests often involve takedowns and ground control, and may end when a contestant concedes defeat. Should there be no winner after the match time-limit has lapsed, competition judges will determine the winner based on who exerted more control.\nGrappling most commonly does not include striking or the use of weapons. However, some fighting styles or martial arts known especially for their grappling techniques teach tactics that include strikes and weapons either alongside grappling or combined with it.\nHistory.\nGrappling appears in the earliest combat systems. In Mesopotamia and Ancient Egypt, depictions of wrestlers in grappling poses appear on tombs and artifacts dating back to 2000 BCE.\nThe Greeks formalized grappling in the sport of p\u00e1le, a key part of the Olympic pentathlon, and developed a hybrid striking-grappling art called pankration. The Romans adopted and adapted these techniques into their own wrestling styles.\nIn India, kushti (traditional wrestling) dates back thousands of years. In East Asia, shuai jiao, jujutsu, and later judo (developed in the 1880s) emphasized leverage, throws and submissions.\nDuring the Middle Ages, grappling was part of European knightly combat and included in manuals of historical European martial arts. It was used in both armored and unarmored fighting.\nGrappling evolved into competitive sports, such as freestyle wrestling, Greco-Roman wrestling, and Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu. Today, grappling is a core skill in mixed martial arts and law enforcement training.\nTypes of technique.\nGrappling techniques can be broadly subdivided into clinch fighting; takedowns and throws; submission holds and pinning or controlling techniques; and sweeps, reversals, turnovers, and escapes.\nUse.\nThe degree to which grappling is utilized in different fighting systems varies. Some systems, such as amateur wrestling, pehlwani, judo and Brazilian jiu-jitsu are exclusively grappling arts and do not allow striking. Some other grappling arts allow some limited forms of striking, for example in sumo and in combat jiu jitsu it is possible to strike with open hands (slapping). Many combat sports, such as shooto and mixed martial arts competitions, use both grappling and striking extensively as part of the sport.\nGrappling is not allowed in some martial arts and combat sports, usually for the sake of focusing on other aspects of combat such as punching, kicking or m\u00eal\u00e9e weapons. Opponents in these types of matches, however, still grapple with each other occasionally when fatigued or in pain; when either occurs, the referee will step in and restart the match, sometimes giving a warning to one or both of the fighters. Examples of these include boxing, kickboxing, taekwondo, karate, and fencing. While prolonged grappling in Muay Thai will result in a separation of the competitors, the art extensively uses the clinch hold known as a double collar tie.\nGrappling techniques and defenses to grappling techniques are also considered important in self-defense applications and in law enforcement. The most common grappling techniques taught for self-defense are escapes from holds and application of pain compliance techniques.\nGrappling can be trained for self-defense, sport, and mixed martial arts (MMA) competition.\nStand-up grappling.\nStand-up grappling is arguably an integral part of all grappling and clinch fighting arts, considering that two combatants generally start fighting from a stand-up position. The aim of stand-up grappling varies according to the martial arts or combat sports in question. Defensive stand-up grappling concerns itself with pain-compliance holds and escapes from possible grappling holds applied by an opponent, while offensive grappling techniques include submission holds, trapping, takedowns and throws, all of which can be used to inflict serious damage, or to move the fight to the ground. Stand-up grappling can also be used both offensively and defensively simultaneously with striking, either to trap an opponent's arms while striking, prevent the opponent from obtaining sufficient distance to strike effectively, or to bring the opponent close to apply, for instance, knee strikes.\nIn combat sports, stand-up grappling usually revolves around successful takedowns and throws. Grappling is a major part of combat glima and L\u00f8se-tak sport glima, and the fight continues on the ground if both combatants end up there. In other martial sports such as MMA, the fight may continue on the ground.\nGround grappling.\nGround grappling refers to all the grappling techniques that are applied while the grapplers are no longer in a standing position. A large part of most martial arts and combat sports which feature ground grappling is positioning and obtaining a dominant position. A dominant position (usually on top) allows the dominant grappler a variety of options, including: attempting to escape by standing up, obtaining a pin or hold-down to control and exhaust the opponent, executing a submission hold, or striking the opponent. The bottom grappler is, on the other hand, concerned with escaping the situation and improving their position, typically by using a sweep or reversal. In some disciplines, especially those where the guard is used, the bottom grappler may also be able to finish the fight from the bottom by a submission hold. Some people feel more confident on the bottom because of the large number of submissions that can be accomplished from having the opponent in full-guard.\nApplications.\nWhen unskilled fighters get embroiled in combat, a common reaction is to grab the opponent in an attempt to slow the situation down by holding them still, resulting in an unsystematic struggle that relies on brute force. A skilled fighter, in contrast, can perform takedowns as a way of progressing to a superior position such as a Mount (grappling) or side control, or using clinch holds and ground positions to set up strikes, choke holds, and joint locks. A grappler who has been taken down to the ground can use defensive positions such as the Guard (grappling), which protects against being mounted or attacked. If a grappler is strong and can utilize leverage well, a takedown or throw itself can be a fight-ending maneuver; the impact can render an opponent unconscious. On the other hand, grappling also offers the possibility of controlling an opponent without injuring them. For this reason, most police staff receive some training in grappling. Likewise, grappling sports have been devised so that their participants can compete using full physical effort without injuring their opponents.\nGrappling is called \"dumog\" in Eskrima. The term \"chin na\" in Chinese martial arts deals with the use of grappling to achieve submission or incapacitation of the opponent (these may involve the use of acupressure points). Some Chinese martial arts, aikido, some eskrima systems, the Viking martial art of glima, as well as medieval and Renaissance European martial arts, practice grappling while one or both participants is armed. Their practice is significantly more dangerous than unarmed grappling and generally requires a great deal of training.\nTypes of grappling.\nThere are many different regional styles of grappling around the world that are practiced within a limited geographic area or country. Several martial arts and fighting disciplines employ grappling techniques, such as judo, Brazilian jiu-jitsu, Cornish wrestling, catch wrestling, shoot wrestling, submission grappling, sambo, hapkido and several types of wrestling including freestyle and Greco-Roman have gained global popularity. Judo, Freestyle Wrestling, and Greco-Roman Wrestling are Olympic Sports while Grappling, Brazilian Jiu-jitsu and Sambo have their own World Championship Competitions. Other known grappling-oriented systems are sumo, shuai jiao, malla-yuddha and aikido.\nIn these arts, the object is either to take down and pin the opponent, or to catch the adversary in a specialized chokehold or joint lock which forces them to submit and admit defeat or be rendered helpless (unconscious or broken limbs). There are two forms of dress for grappling that dictate pace and style of action: with a jacket, such as a \"gi\" or kurtka, and without (No-Gi). The jacket, or \"gi\", form most often utilizes grips on the cloth to control the opponent's body, while the \"no-\"gi\"\" form emphasizes body control of the torso and head using only the natural holds provided by the body. The use of a jacket is compulsory in judo competition, sambo competition, and most Brazilian jiu-jitsu competition, as well as a variety of folk wrestling styles around the world. Jackets are not used in many forms of wrestling, such as Olympic Freestyle, Greco-Roman wrestling and Grappling.\nGrappling techniques are also used in mixed martial arts along with striking techniques. Strikes can be used to set up grappling techniques and vice versa.\nADCC.\nThe ADCC Submission Fighting World Championship is the most prestigious submission grappling tournament in the world and is held biannually.\nMundials.\nThe World Jiu-Jitsu Championship, also commonly called the Mundials (Portuguese for \"Worlds\"), is the most prestigious jacketed full range (takedown, position, and submission inclusive) grappling tournament in the world. The event also hosts a non-jacketed division (no gi), but that sub-event is not as prestigious as ADCC in terms of pure non-jacketed competition.\nUnited World Wrestling.\nUnited World Wrestling (UWW) is the international governing body for the sport of wrestling. It presides over international competitions for various forms of wrestling, including Grappling for men and women. The flagship Grappling's event of UWW is the Grappling World Championships. See more FILA grappling\nNAGA.\nThe North American Grappling Association (NAGA) is an organization started in 1995 that holds submission grappling and Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu tournaments throughout North America and Europe. NAGA is the largest submission grappling association in the world with over 175,000 participants worldwide, including some of the top submission grapplers and MMA fighters in the world. NAGA grappling tournaments consist of gi and no-gi divisions. No-Gi competitors compete under rules drafted by NAGA. Gi competitors compete under standardized Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu rules.

Since the university's founding, two of its economics professors have received the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economics: James M. Buchanan in 1986 and Vernon L. Smith in 2002.\nHistory.\n20th century.\nIn 1949, the University of Virginia created an extension center to serve mid-career working professionals and non-traditional students near urban centers in the Northern Virginia suburbs of Washington, D.C. The extension center offered both for credit and non-credit informal classes in the evenings at various pre-existing venues. The first for credit classes offered were: \"Government in the Far East, Introduction to International Politics, English Composition, Principles of Economics, Mathematical Analysis, Introduction to Mathematical Statistics, and Principles of Lip Reading.\" By the end of 1952, enrollment was 1,192 students.\nA resolution of the Virginia General Assembly in January 1956 changed the extension center into University College, the Northern Virginia branch of the University of Virginia. John Norville Gibson Finley served as director. Seventeen freshmen students attended classes at University College in a small renovated elementary school building in Bailey's Crossroads starting in September 1957. In 1958 University College became George Mason College.\nThe City of Fairfax purchased and donated of land just south of the city limits to the University of Virginia for the college's new site, which is now referred to as the Fairfax Campus. In 1959, the Board of Visitors of the University of Virginia selected a permanent name for the college: George Mason College of the University of Virginia. The Fairfax campus construction planning that began in early 1960 showed visible results when the development of the first of Fairfax Campus began in 1962. In the Fall of 1964 the new campus welcomed 356 students.\nIn 1966, in the Virginia General Assembly, Alexandria delegate James M. Thomson, with the backing of the University of Virginia, introduced a bill in the General Assembly to make George Mason College a four-year institution under the University of Virginia's direction. The measure, known as H 33, passed the Assembly easily and was approved on March 1, 1966, making George Mason College a degree-granting institution. During that same year, the local jurisdictions of Fairfax County, Arlington County, and the cities of Alexandria and Falls Church agreed to appropriate $3 million to purchase land adjacent to Mason to provide for a Fairfax Campus with the intention that the institution would expand into a regional university of major proportions, including the granting of graduate degrees.\nIn 1972, Virginia separated George Mason College from the University of Virginia in Charlottesville and renamed it George Mason University.\nIn 1978, George W. Johnson was appointed to serve as the fourth president. Under his eighteen-year tenure, the university expanded both its physical size and program offerings at a tremendous rate. Shortly before Johnson's inauguration in April 1979, Mason acquired the School of Law and the new Arlington Campus. The university also became a doctoral institution. Toward the end of Johnson's term, Mason would be deep in planning for a third campus in Prince William County at Manassas. Major campus facilities, such as Student Union Building II, EagleBank Arena, Center for the Arts, and the Johnson Learning Center, were all constructed over the course of Johnson's eighteen years as University President. Enrollment once again more than doubled from 10,767 during the fall of 1978 to 24,368 in the spring of 1996.\nIn 1996, Alan Merten, dean of the Samuel Curtis Johnson Graduate School of Management at Cornell University was appointed the university's president. He believed that the university's location made it responsible for both contributing to and drawing from its surrounding communities\u2014local, national, and global. George Mason was becoming recognized and acclaimed in all of these spheres. During Merten's tenure, the university hosted the World Congress of Information Technology in 1998, celebrated a second Nobel Memorial Prize-winning faculty member in 2002, and cheered the Men's basketball team in their NCAA Final Four appearance in 2006. Enrollment increased from just over 24,000 students in 1996 to approximately 33,000 during the spring semester of 2012, making Mason Virginia's largest public university.\n21st century.\nFollowing Merten's retirement in 2012, \u00c1ngel Cabrera was appointed the university's sixth president on July 1, 2012.\nIn a resolution on August 17, 2012, the board asked Cabrera to create a new strategic vision that would help Mason remain relevant and competitive in the future. The drafting of the Vision for Mason, from conception to official outline, created a new mission statement that defines the university.\nOn March 25, 2013, Cabrera held a press conference to announce the university's decision to leave the Colonial Athletic Association to join the Atlantic 10 Conference (A-10). The announcement came just days after the Board of Visitors' approval of the university's vision document that Cabrera had overseen. Mason began competition in the A-10 during the 2013\u20132014 academic year. \"The Chronicle of Higher Education\" listed Mason as one of the \"Great Colleges to Work For\" from 2010 to 2014. \"The Washington Post\" listed Mason as one of the \"Top Workplaces\" in 2014.\nThe WorldatWork Alliance for Work-Life Progress awarded Mason the Seal of Distinction in 2015. The AARP listed Mason as one of the Best Employers for Workers Over 50 in 2013. Phi Beta Kappa established a chapter at the university in 2013.\nIn 2018, a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit revealed that conservative donors, including the Charles Koch Foundation and Federalist Society, were given direct influence over faculty hiring decisions at the university's law and economics schools. GMU President \u00c1ngel Cabrera acknowledged that the revelations raised questions about the university's academic integrity and pledged to prohibit donors from sitting on faculty selection committees in the future.\nCabrera resigned his position on July 31, 2019, to become president of Georgia Tech. Following Cabrera's resignation, Anne B. Holton served as interim president until June 30, 2020.\nOn February 24, 2020, the Board of Visitors appointed Gregory Washington as the university's eighth president, and he assumed that role on July 1, 2020. Washington is the university's first African-American president.\nOn March 23, 2020, George Mason shifted to exclusively online instruction during the COVID-19 pandemic. Hybrid instruction occurred during the Fall 2020, Spring 2021, and Fall 2021 semesters during which the university offered a combination of online and in-person instruction.\nMild unrest occurred on George Mason's campus in the aftermath of the October 7, 2023 attack of Hamas on Israel and the resulting war. Statements denouncing antisemitism and Islamophobia were made by the Office of the President. An encampment on nearby George Washington University's campus was organized in part by George Mason students.\nIn August of 2025, the Department of Education found that university President, Gregory Washington, had unlawfully discriminated when hiring employees in the name of \"diversity, equity and inclusion.\"\nCampuses.\nGeorge Mason University has four campuses in the United States, each of which is located in Virginia. Three are in the Northern Virginia suburbs of the Washington metropolitan area, and one is in Virginia's Blue Ridge Mountains. The university also has one campus in South Korea, in the Songdo International Business District of Incheon. Between 2005 and 2009 the university had a campus at Ras al-Khaimah, United Arab Emirates. The Blue Ridge campus, just outside Front Royal, is run in cooperation with the Smithsonian Institution.\nFairfax.\nThe university's primary Fairfax Campus is situated on in central Fairfax County. The campus lies just south of the City of Fairfax, and approximately from Washington, D.C.. The City of Fairfax covers a small piece of the university grounds. \nNotable buildings include the student union building, the Johnson Center; the Center for the Arts, a 2,000-seat concert hall; the Long and Kimmy Nguyen Engineering Building; Exploratory Hall for science, new in 2013; an astronomy observatory and telescope; the Art and Design Building; the newly expanded Fenwick Library, the Krasnow Institute; and three fully appointed gyms and an aquatic center for student use. The stadiums for indoor and outdoor track and field, baseball, softball, tennis, soccer and lacrosse are also on the Fairfax campus, as is Masonvale, a housing community for faculty, staff and graduate students.\nGeorge Mason statue and Enslaved People of George Mason Memorial.\nThe bronze statue of George Mason on campus was created by Wendy M. Ross and dedicated on April 12, 1996. The 7 foot statue shows George Mason presenting his first draft of the Virginia Declaration of Rights which was later the basis for the U.S. Constitution's Bill of Rights. Beside Mason is a model of a writing table that is still in the study of Gunston Hall, Mason's Virginia estate. The books on the table, volumes of Hume, Locke, and Rousseau, represent influences in his thought.\nIn 2021, an Enslaved People of George Mason Monument designed by Perkins &amp; Will was installed near the George Mason Statue. The memorial includes panels describing the lives of two of the enslaved at Gunston Hall: Penny, who was gifted by Mason to his daughter, and James, Mason's personal attendant.\nArlington.\nThe Arlington Campus, named Mason Square in 2022, is situated on in Virginia Square, an urban environment on the edge of Arlington County, Virginia's Clarendon business district and from downtown Washington, D.C. The campus was founded in 1979 with the acquisition of a law school. In 1998, Hazel Hall opened to house the Antonin Scalia Law School; subsequent development created Van Metre Hall (formerly Founders Hall), home of the Schar School of Policy and Government, the Center for Regional Analysis, and the graduate-level administrative offices for the School of Business. Vernon Smith Hall houses the Jimmy and Rosalynn Carter School for Peace and Conflict Resolution, the Mercatus Center, and the Institute for Humane Studies. The campus also houses the 300-seat Van Metre Hall Auditorium. A new building, Fuse at Mason Square, is scheduled to be completed in 2025.\nTransportation.\nThe campus is served by the Washington Metro's Orange and Silver lines at the Virginia Square\u2013GMU station, a campus shuttle service, and Metrobus, Arlington Transit (ART), and OmniRide buses.\nScience and Technology campus.\nThe Science and Technology campus opened on August 25, 1997, as the Prince William campus in Manassas, Virginia, on of land, some still currently undeveloped. More than 4,000 students are enrolled in classes in bioinformatics, biotechnology, information technology, and forensic biosciences educational and research programs. There are undergraduate programs in health, fitness and recreation. There are graduate programs in exercise, fitness, health, geographic information systems, and facility management. Much of the research takes place in the high-security Biomedical Research Laboratory. The 1,123-seat Merchant Hall and the 300-seat Verizon Auditorium in the Hylton Performing Arts Center opened in 2010.\nThe 110,000-square-foot Freedom Aquatic and Fitness Center is operated by the Mason Enterprise Center. The Mason Center for Team and Organizational Learning stylized as EDGE is an experiential education facility open to the public. The Sports Medicine Assessment Research and Testing lab stylized as SMART Lab is located within the Freedom center. The SMART Lab is most known for its concussion research. On April 23, 2015, the campus was renamed to the Science and Technology Campus.\nIn 2019, the university engaged in a feasibility study of creating a medical school at the Prince William Campus.\nSmithsonian-Mason School of Conservation.\nThe campus in Front Royal, Virginia, is a collaboration between the Smithsonian Institution and the university. Open to students in August 2012 after breaking ground on the project on June 29, 2011, the primary focus of the campus is global conservation training. The Volgenau Academic Center includes three teaching laboratories, four classrooms, and 18 offices. Shenandoah National Park is visible from the dining facility's indoor and outdoor seating. Living quarters include 60 double occupancy rooms, an exercise facility, and study space.\nMason Korea.\nOpened in March 2014, Mason Korea is located in the Songdo International Business District in South Korea, a site designed for 850,000 people. It is located from Seoul and a two-hour flight from China and Japan, and is connected to the Seoul Metropolitan Subway.\nThe Commonwealth of Virginia considers the Songdo campus legally no different from any other Mason campus: &lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nMason Korea's first commencement class graduated in December 2017.\nStudents can take seven bachelor's degree courses in Mason Korea.\nStudents from Mason Korea earn the same diploma as home campus students, with English as the language of instruction.\nAcademics.\nMason offers undergraduate, graduate master's, law, and doctoral degrees with an emphasis on combining modern practice-based professional education with a comprehensive traditional liberal arts curriculum. The student-faculty ratio is 17:1; 58 percent of undergraduate classes have fewer than 30 students and 30 percent of undergraduate classes have fewer than 20 students.\nRankings.\nIn 2024, \"U.S. News &amp; World Report\" ranked George Mason tied at #109 out of 436 National Universities, tied at #52 in Top Public Schools, #156 in Best Value Schools, tied at #98 in Best Undergraduate Engineering Programs at schools where doctorate not offered, tied at #114 in Nursing, tied at #93 in Economics, tied at #20 in Co-ops/Internships, tied at #70 in Best Colleges for Veterans, #25 in Most Innovative Schools, and tied at #82 in Top Performers on Social Mobility.\nUndergraduate admissions.\nIn 2024, the university accepted 90% of its undergraduate applicants, and did not consider high school class rank or require standardized test scores for admission. Those admitted had an average 3.68 high school GPA. For those submitting scores the average student had an SAT score of 1250 (38% submitting scores) or an average ACT score of 28 (3% submitting scores).\nStudent statistics.\nBetween 2009 and 2013, George Mason saw a 21% increase in the number of applications, has enrolled 4% more new degree-seeking students, and has seen the percentage of undergraduate and graduate applications accepted each decrease by 4%. Law applications accepted increased by 10%. Mason enrolled 33,917 students for fall 2013, up 956 (+3%) from fall 2012.

As of 2023, the university enrolled 40,185 students, making it the largest university by head count in Virginia.\nResearch.\nGeorge Mason University hosts $149 million in sponsored research projects annually, as of 2019. In 2016, Mason was classified among \"R1: Doctoral Universities \u2013 Very high research activity\". Mason moved into this classification based on a review of its 2013\u20132014 data that was performed by the Center for Postsecondary Research at Indiana University.\nThe research is focused on health, sustainability and security. In health, researchers focus is on wellness, disease prevention, advanced diagnostics and biomedical analytics. Sustainability research examines climate change, natural disaster forecasting, and risk assessment. Mason's security experts study domestic and international security as well as cyber security.\nCenters and institutes.\nThe university is home to numerous research centers and institutes.&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nStudent life and community relations.\nTraditions.\nStudents have often decorated the George Mason statue on the Fairfax campus for events. Some have rubbed the statue toe to bring good luck. Many pose with the statue for graduation photographs. Between 1988 and 1990 Anthony Maiello wrote the original \"George Mason Fight Song\", which was edited by Michael Nickens in 2009.\nEach spring, student organizations at Mason compete to paint one of the 38 benches located on the Quad in front of Fenwick Library. For years, student organizations have painted those benches that line the walkway to gain recognition for their group. With more than 300 student organizations, there is much competition to paint the benches. Painting takes place in the spring.\nHousing.\nGeorge Mason University has around 40 residence halls in the Fairfax campus, 22 of which are used specifically for freshmen. Many halls are named after famous Virginia regions and terms.\nStudent organizations.\nStudent organizations may have academic, social, athletic, religious/irreligious, career, or other focus. The university recognizes 500 such groups.\nMason sponsors several student-run media outlets through the Office of Student Media.\nGreek life.\nMason recognizes 42 fraternities and sororities, with a total Greek population of about 1,800. Mason does not have a traditional \"Greek Row\" of housing specifically for fraternities, although recruitment, charitable events\u2014including a spring Greek Week\u2014and other chapter activities take place on the Fairfax Campus.\nAthletics.\nDivision I teams.\nThe George Mason Patriots are the athletic teams of George Mason University located in Fairfax, Virginia.

The university is also ranked No. 8 in the nation for Freedom of Speech and protecting rights enshrined in the First Amendment to the United States Constitution according to the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression (FIRE), FIRE also posits that the majority viewpoint of the student body leans politically liberal in the sense of modern liberalism in the United States, although the political ideologies of libertarianism in the United States and conservatism in the United States are also visible on campus with the university stating that it strives for \"comprehensive ideological balance,\" evidence including but not limited to the university being \"home to both the Antonin Scalia Law School and the Jimmy and Rosalynn Carter School for Peace and Conflict Resolution,\" named after a conservative U.S. Supreme Court Justice (Antonin Scalia) politically appointed by Republican Party U.S. President and a liberal U.S. President (Jimmy Carter) and First Lady (Rosalynn Carter) who were members of the Democratic Party, respectively.\nDemographics.\nAccording to the U.S. Department of Education College Scorecard, 44% of students have taken on federal student loans, and in terms of socioeconomic diversity, 28% of students have received Pell grants reserved for low-income students. Among undergraduate students, 80% of students are enrolled full-time while 20% are enrolled part-time\nIn terms of ethnic and racial demographics: American Indian/Alaska Native people make up 0% of the student body and 0% of the full-time staff; Asian people make up 22% of the student body and 14% of the full-time staff; Black people make up 11% of the student body and 5% of the full-time staff; Hispanic and Latino people make up 17% of the student population and 3% of the full-time staff; Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander people make up 0% of the student body and 0% of the full-time staff; non-resident alien people make up 5% of the student body and 8% of the full-time staff; people of two or more races/multiracial people make up 5% of the student body and 2% of the full-time staff; people of an Unknown ethno-racial demographic make up 3% of the student body and 3% of the full-time staff; and White people make up 36% of the student body and 65% of the full-time staff.\nKoch Foundation funding and Economics Department.\nGeorge Mason University has been subject to controversy surrounding donations from the Charles Koch Foundation, in particular to the College of Humanities and Social Sciences' Department of Economics, which was seen as being allegedly influenced by libertarian political thought, evidenced by the political activities of the Koch brothers. University documents revealed that the Koch brothers were given the ability to pick candidates as a condition of monetary donations. George Mason University altered its donor rules following the controversy.\nLaw school.\nThe naming of the Antonin Scalia Law School after the late conservative United States Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia, the hiring of conservative United States Supreme Court Justices Bret Kavanaugh, Neil Gorsuch, and Clarence Thomas as professors, the allegedly \"lavish treatments,\" speaking gigs, and \"all-expenses-paid\" travel arrangements they received, its close ties with the Federalist Society for Law and Public Policy Studies, and the extensive provision of professional development and continuing education programs, as well as speaking engagements for sitting judges of lower and appellate divisions \u2013 in particular dealing with the topic of law and economics \u2013 has brought on controversy on the university itself, the Supreme Court of the United States, and the Federal Judiciary of the United States as a whole over the overt conservative political influence taking place at the law school and the university's growing influence over the U.S. judicial system. The law school had also received some controversy due to its relationship with the overtly libertarian university-affiliated Mercatus Center think tank which is known to have received donations from a conservative political donor group known as The 85 Fund-Judicial Education Project headed by conservative legal activist Leonard Leo.\nPublic policy school.\nGeorge Mason University's public policy school and political science department, the Schar School of Policy and Government, was the subject of some controversy over its relationship with former US intelligence agency personnel. In particular, the 2009 hiring of General Michael Hayden, former director of the Central Intelligence Agency and the National Security Agency (NSA), and of Robert Deitz, former general counsel of the NSA, were controversial due to Hayden's and Deitz's intelligence careers which involved lawful but unpopular use of mass surveillance.\nHistorical hoaxes.\nThe George Mason University's historical hoaxes were a group of internet hoaxes and disinformation campaigns created by students as part of a class project for a course on \"Lying about the Past\" taught by history professor T. Mills Kelly, with the goal of creating an Internet deception that affected news media platforms.\nSexual misconduct.\nIn 2016 a male student won an appeal overturning his suspension for sexual assault.\nThe Title IX process (which investigates sex discrimination) at George Mason University has continued to be subject to controversy. Following the hiring of Brett Kavanaugh as a visiting professor in the law school in 2019, students circulated a petition demanding not only the removal of Kavanaugh, but to increase the number of Title IX Coordinators on campus. The petition received 10,000 signatures and resulted in approval for funding for two more Title IX Coordinator positions.\nIn 2018, Peter Pober was alleged to have committed sexual misconduct during his tenure as a Competitive Speech coach. He retired while being investigated for misconduct.\nDepartment of Education and Department of Justice investigations.\nIn July 2025, the US Department of Education announced two investigations of the university, one concerning \"allegations that it failed to respond effectively to a pervasively hostile environment for Jewish students and faculty from October 2023 through the 2024-2025 academic year,\" and another \"based on a complaint filed with OCR by multiple professors at GMU who allege that the university illegally uses race and other immutable characteristics in university policies, including hiring and promotion.\"\nOn July 17, 2025, the US Department of Justice (DOJ) announced an investigation into possible discriminatory hiring and promotion practices at GMU. In their letter to the university, the DOJ made several claims regarding racial or gender-oriented hiring preferences. GMU's president, Gregory Washington, responded to the announcement the following day with a public statement providing context on some of the accusations and a statement that they intend to cooperate fully and had already removed some of the policies in question. They also state that they had been obeying the current state laws on the matter at the time the messages and posts in the DOJ letter were made.\nOn July 21, 2025, the DOJ announced a second investigation, this time into admissions procedures and awarding of student benefits and scholarships and their compliance with federal non-discrimination laws. The second investigation's letter to the University makes no specific accusations about admissions practices or student treatment, instead listing this investigation as a compliance check, but GMU's public response mentions allegations of non-compliance with these policies and DOJ concerns over the university response to anti-semitism on campus.\nOn July 25, 2025, the Department of Justice stated its plans to review a resolution by the Faculty Senate which had quoted from the university's 2023 strategic plan.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "12569", "revid": "34459122", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=12569", "title": "Grammar", "text": "Structural rules of a language\nIn linguistics, grammar is the set of rules for how a natural language is structured, as demonstrated by its speakers or writers. Grammar rules may concern the use of clauses, phrases, and words. The term may also refer to the study of such rules, a subject that includes phonology, morphology, and syntax, together with phonetics, semantics, and pragmatics. There are, broadly speaking, two different ways to study grammar: traditional grammar and theoretical grammar.\nFluency in a particular language variety involves a speaker internalizing these rules, many or most of which are acquired by observing other speakers, as opposed to intentional study or instruction. Much of this internalization occurs during early childhood; learning a language later in life usually involves more direct instruction. The term \"grammar\" can also describe the linguistic behaviour of groups of speakers and writers rather than individuals. Differences in scale are important to this meaning: for example, English grammar could describe those rules followed by every one of the language's speakers. At smaller scales, it may refer to rules shared by smaller groups of speakers.\nA description, study, or analysis of such rules may also be known as a grammar, or as a grammar book. A reference work describing the grammar of a language is called a \"reference grammar\" or simply a \"grammar\". A fully revealed grammar, which describes the grammatical constructions of a particular speech type in great detail is called descriptive grammar. This kind of linguistic description contrasts with linguistic prescription, a plan to marginalize some constructions while codifying others, either absolutely or in the framework of a standard language. The word \"grammar\" often has divergent meanings when used in contexts outside linguistics. It may be used more broadly to include orthographic conventions of written language, such as spelling and punctuation, which are not typically considered part of grammar by linguists; that is, the conventions used for writing a language. It may also be used more narrowly to refer to a set of prescriptive norms only, excluding the aspects of a language's grammar which do not change or are clearly acceptable (or not) without the need for discussions.\nEtymology.\nThe word \"grammar\" is derived from Greek (\"grammatik\u1e15 t\u00e9chn\u0113\"), which means \"art of letters\", from (\"gr\u00e1mma\"), \"letter\", itself from (\"gr\u00e1phein\"), \"to draw, to write\". The same Greek root also appears in the words \"graphics\", \"grapheme\", and \"photograph\".\nHistory.\nThe first systematic grammar of Sanskrit originated in Iron Age India, with Yaska (6th century BC), P\u0101\u1e47ini (6th\u20135th century BC) and his commentators Pingala (c.\u2009200 BC), Katyayana, and Patanjali (2nd century BC). Tolk\u0101ppiyam, the earliest Tamil grammar, is mostly dated to before the 5th century AD. The Babylonians also made some early attempts at language description.\nGrammar appeared as a discipline in Hellenism from the 3rd century BC forward with authors such as Rhyanus and Aristarchus of Samothrace. The oldest known grammar handbook is the \"Art of Grammar\" (), a succinct guide to speaking and writing clearly and effectively, written by the ancient Greek scholar Dionysius Thrax (c.\u2009170\u00a0\u2013 c.\u200990 BC), a student of Aristarchus of Samothrace who founded a school on the Greek island of Rhodes. Dionysius Thrax's grammar book remained the primary grammar textbook for Greek schoolboys until as late as the twelfth century AD. The Romans based their grammatical writings on it and its basic format remains the basis for grammar guides in many languages even today. Latin grammar developed by following Greek models from the 1st century BC, due to the work of authors such as Orbilius Pupillus, Remmius Palaemon, Marcus Valerius Probus, Verrius Flaccus, and Aemilius Asper.\nThe grammar of Irish originated in the 7th century with Auraicept na n-\u00c9ces. Arabic grammar emerged with Abu al-Aswad al-Du'ali in the 7th century. The first treatises on Hebrew grammar appeared in the High Middle Ages, in the context of Midrash (exegesis of the Hebrew Bible). The Karaite tradition originated in Abbasid Baghdad. The \"Diqduq\" (10th century) is one of the earliest grammatical commentaries on the Hebrew Bible. Ibn Barun in the 12th century, compares the Hebrew language with Arabic in the Islamic grammatical tradition.\nBelonging to the \"trivium\" of the seven liberal arts, grammar was taught as a core discipline throughout the Middle Ages, following the influence of authors from Late Antiquity, such as Priscian. Treatment of vernaculars began gradually during the High Middle Ages, with isolated works such as the First Grammatical Treatise, but became influential only in the Renaissance and Baroque periods. In 1486, Antonio de Nebrija published \"Las introduciones Latinas contrapuesto el romance al Latin\", and the first Spanish grammar, \"Gram\u00e1tica de la lengua castellana\", in 1492. During the 16th-century Italian Renaissance, the \"Questione della lingua\" was the discussion on the status and ideal form of the Italian language, initiated by Dante's \"de vulgari eloquentia\" (Pietro Bembo, \"Prose della volgar lingua\" Venice 1525). The first grammar of Slovene was written in 1583 by Adam Bohori\u010d, and \"Grammatica Germanicae Linguae\", the first grammar of German, was published in 1578.\nGrammars of some languages began to be compiled for the purposes of evangelism and Bible translation from the 16th century onward, such as \"Grammatica o Arte de la Lengua General de Los Indios de Los Reynos del Per\u00fa\" (1560), a Quechua grammar by Fray Domingo de Santo Tom\u00e1s.\nFrom the latter part of the 18th century, grammar came to be understood as a subfield of the emerging discipline of modern linguistics. The \"Deutsche Grammatik\" of Jacob Grimm was first published in the 1810s. The \"Comparative Grammar\" of Franz Bopp, the starting point of modern comparative linguistics, came out in 1833.\nTheoretical frameworks.\nFrameworks of grammar which seek to give a precise scientific theory of the syntactic rules of grammar and their function have been developed in theoretical linguistics.\nParse trees are commonly used by such frameworks to depict their rules. There are various alternative schemes for some grammar:\nDevelopment.\nGrammars evolve through usage. Historically, with the advent of written representations, formal rules about language usage tend to appear also, although such rules tend to describe writing conventions more accurately than conventions of speech. Formal grammars are codifications of usage which are developed by repeated documentation and observation over time. As rules are established and developed, the prescriptive concept of grammatical correctness can arise. This often produces a discrepancy between contemporary usage and that which has been accepted, over time, as being standard or \"correct\". Linguists tend to view prescriptive grammar as having little justification beyond their authors' aesthetic tastes, although style guides may give useful advice about \"standard language employment\" based on descriptions of usage in contemporary writings of the same language. Linguistic prescriptions also form part of the explanation for variation in speech, particularly variation in the speech of an individual speaker (for example, why some speakers say \"I didn't do nothing\", some say \"I didn't do anything\", and some say one or the other depending on social context).\nThe formal study of grammar is an important part of children's schooling from a young age through advanced learning, though the rules taught in schools are not a \"grammar\" in the sense that most linguists use, particularly as they are prescriptive in intent rather than descriptive.\nConstructed languages (also called \"planned languages\" or \"conlangs\") are more common in the modern day, although still extremely uncommon compared to natural languages. Many have been designed to aid human communication (for example, naturalistic Interlingua, schematic Esperanto, and the highly logical Lojban). Each of these languages has its own grammar.\nSyntax refers to the linguistic structure above the word level (for example, how sentences are formed)\u00a0\u2013 though without taking into account intonation, which is the domain of phonology. Morphology, by contrast, refers to the structure at and below the word level (for example, how compound words are formed), but above the level of individual sounds, which, like intonation, are in the domain of phonology. However, no clear line can be drawn between syntax and morphology. Analytic languages use syntax to convey information that is encoded by inflection in synthetic languages. In other words, word order is not significant, and morphology is highly significant in a purely synthetic language, whereas morphology is not significant and syntax is highly significant in an analytic language. For example, Chinese and Afrikaans are highly analytic, thus meaning is very context-dependent. (Both have some inflections, and both have had more in the past; thus, they are becoming even less synthetic and more \"purely\" analytic over time.) Latin, which is highly synthetic, uses affixes and inflections to convey the same information that Chinese does with syntax. Because Latin words are quite (though not totally) self-contained, an intelligible Latin sentence can be made from elements that are arranged almost arbitrarily. Latin has a complex affixation and simple syntax, whereas Chinese has the opposite.\nEducation.\nPrescriptive grammar is taught in primary and secondary school. The term \"grammar school\" historically referred to a school (attached to a cathedral or monastery) that teaches Latin grammar to future priests and monks. It originally referred to a school that taught students how to read, scan, interpret, and declaim Greek and Latin poets (including Homer, Virgil, Euripides, and others). These should not be mistaken for the related, albeit distinct, modern British grammar schools.\nA standard language is a dialect that is promoted above other dialects in writing, education, and, broadly speaking, in the public sphere; it contrasts with vernacular dialects, which may be the objects of study in academic, descriptive linguistics but which are rarely taught prescriptively. The standardized \"first language\" taught in primary education may be subject to political controversy because it may sometimes establish a standard defining nationality or ethnicity.\nRecently, efforts have begun to update grammar instruction in primary and secondary education. The main focus has been to prevent the use of outdated prescriptive rules in favor of setting norms based on earlier descriptive research and to change perceptions about the relative \"correctness\" of prescribed standard forms in comparison to non-standard dialects. A series of metastudies have found that the explicit teaching of grammatical parts of speech and syntax has little or no effect on the improvement of student writing quality in elementary school, middle school or high school; other methods of writing instruction had far greater positive effect, including strategy instruction, collaborative writing, summary writing, process instruction, sentence combining and inquiry projects.\nThe preeminence of Parisian French has reigned largely unchallenged throughout the history of modern French literature. Standard Italian is based on the speech of Florence rather than the capital because of its influence on early literature. Likewise, standard Spanish is not based on the speech of Madrid but on that of educated speakers from more northern areas such as Castile and Le\u00f3n (see \"Gram\u00e1tica de la lengua castellana\"). In Argentina and Uruguay the Spanish standard is based on the local dialects of Buenos Aires and Montevideo (Rioplatense Spanish). Portuguese has, for now, two official standards, Brazilian Portuguese and European Portuguese.\nThe Serbian variant of Serbo-Croatian is likewise divided; Serbia and the Republika Srpska of Bosnia and Herzegovina use their own distinct normative subvarieties, with differences in yat reflexes. The existence and codification of a distinct Montenegrin standard is a matter of controversy, some treat Montenegrin as a separate standard lect, and some think that it should be considered another form of Serbian.\nNorwegian has two standards, \"Bokm\u00e5l\" and \"Nynorsk\", the choice between which is subject to controversy: Each Norwegian municipality can either declare one as its official language or it can remain \"language neutral\". Nynorsk is backed by 27 percent of municipalities. The main language used in primary schools, chosen by referendum within the local school district, normally follows the official language of its municipality. Standard German emerged from the standardized chancellery use of High German in the 16th and 17th centuries. Until about 1800, it was almost exclusively a written language, but now it is so widely spoken that most of the former German dialects are nearly extinct.\nStandard Chinese has official status as the standard spoken form of the Chinese language in the People's Republic of China (PRC), the Republic of China (ROC), and the Republic of Singapore. Pronunciation of Standard Chinese is based on the local accent of Mandarin Chinese from Luanping, Chengde in Hebei Province near Beijing, while grammar and syntax are based on modern vernacular written Chinese.\nModern Standard Arabic is directly based on Classical Arabic, the language of the Qur'an. The Hindustani language has two standards, Hindi and Urdu.\nIn the United States, the Society for the Promotion of Good Grammar designated 4 March as National Grammar Day in 2008.\nGrammar instructions also differs between first-language (L1) and second-language (L2) learners, especially in academic writing. First-language (L1) are those composing in their native language, while second-language (L2) writers are writing in language they learned after childhood. Research shows that L2 learners face additional challenges when revising grammar, as they must manage both language acquisition and writing development at the same time. According to Ester Odilia Breuer, revision in L2 writing is cognitively demanding and occurs not only after writing, but also during the planning and drafting stages. She argues that L2 writers often reorganize ideas and revise structure while composing, unlike L1 writers who may rely more on intuition and automatic grammar use.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The prefix \"giga\" means 109 in the International System of Units (SI). Therefore, one gigabyte is one billion bytes. The unit symbol for the gigabyte is GB.\nThis definition is used in all contexts of science (especially data science), engineering, business, and many areas of computing, including storage capacities of hard drives, solid-state drives, and tapes, as well as data transmission speeds. The term is also used in some fields of computer science and information technology to denote (10243 or 230) bytes, however, particularly for sizes of RAM. Thus, some usage of \"gigabyte\" has been ambiguous. To resolve this difficulty, IEC 80000-13 clarifies that a \"gigabyte\" (GB) is 109 bytes and specifies the term \"gibibyte\" (GiB) to denote 230 bytes. These differences are still readily seen, for example, when a 400\u00a0GB drive's capacity is displayed by Microsoft Windows as 372\u00a0GB instead of 372\u00a0GiB. Analogously, a memory module that is labeled as having the size \"\" has one gibibyte () of storage capacity.\nIn response to litigation over whether the makers of electronic storage devices must conform to Microsoft Windows' use of a binary definition of \"GB\" instead of the metric/decimal definition, the United States District Court for the Northern District of California rejected that argument, ruling that \"the U.S. Congress has deemed the decimal definition of gigabyte to be the 'preferred' one for the purposes of 'U.S. trade and commerce.'\"\nDefinition.\nThe term \"gigabyte\" has a standard definition of 10003 bytes, as well as a discouraged meaning of 10243 bytes. The latter binary usage originated as compromise technical jargon for byte multiples that needed to be expressed in a power of 2, but lacked a convenient name. As 1024 (210) is approximately 1000 (103), roughly corresponding to SI multiples, it was used for binary multiples as well.\nIn 1998 the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) published standards for binary prefixes, requiring that the gigabyte strictly denote 10003 bytes and gibibyte denote 10243 bytes. By the end of 2007, the IEC Standard had been adopted by the IEEE, EU, and NIST, and in 2009 it was incorporated in the International System of Quantities. Nevertheless, the term gigabyte continues to be widely used with the following two different meanings:\nBase 10 (decimal).\nBased on powers of 10, this definition uses the prefix giga- as defined in the International System of Units (SI). This is the recommended definition by the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC). This definition is used in networking contexts and most storage media, particularly hard drives, flash-based storage, and DVDs, and is also consistent with the other uses of the SI prefix in computing, such as CPU clock speeds or measures of performance. The file manager of Mac OS X version 10.6 and later versions are a notable example of this usage in software, which report files sizes in decimal units.\nBase 2 (binary).\nThe binary definition uses powers of the base 2, as does the architectural principle of binary computers.\nThis usage is widely promulgated by some operating systems, such as Microsoft Windows in reference to computer memory (e.g., RAM). This definition is synonymous with the unambiguous unit gibibyte.\nConsumer confusion.\nSince the first disk drive, the IBM 350, disk drive manufacturers expressed hard drive capacities using decimal prefixes. With the advent of gigabyte-range drive capacities, manufacturers labelled many consumer hard drive, solid-state drive and USB flash drive capacities in certain size classes expressed in decimal gigabytes, such as \"500 GB\". The exact capacity of a given drive model is usually slightly larger than the class designation. Practically all manufacturers of hard disk drives and flash-memory disk devices continue to define one gigabyte as , which is displayed on the packaging. Some operating systems such as Mac OS X, iOS, Android, Ubuntu, and Debian express hard drive capacity or file size using decimal multipliers, while others such as Microsoft Windows (including Windows Phone) report file size using binary multipliers. This discrepancy causes confusion, as a disk with an advertised capacity of, for example, 400 GB (meaning , equal to 372\u00a0GiB) might be reported by the operating system as \"372 GB\".\nFor RAM, the JEDEC memory standards use \"IEEE 100\" nomenclature which quote the gigabyte as (230 bytes).\nThe difference between units based on decimal and binary prefixes increases as a semi-logarithmic (linear-log) function\u2014for example, the decimal kilobyte value is nearly 98% of the kibibyte, a megabyte is under 96% of a mebibyte, and a gigabyte is just over 93% of a gibibyte value. This means that a 300\u00a0GB (279\u00a0GiB) hard disk might be indicated variously as \"300 GB\", \"279\u00a0GB\" or \"279 GiB\", depending on the operating system. As storage sizes increase and larger units are used, these differences become more pronounced.\nUS lawsuits.\nA lawsuit decided in 2019 that arose from alleged breach of contract and other claims over the binary and decimal definitions used for \"gigabyte\" have ended in favour of the manufacturers, with courts holding that the legal definition of gigabyte or GB is 1\u00a0GB = 1,000,000,000 (109) bytes (the decimal definition). Specifically, the courts held that \"the U.S. Congress has deemed the decimal definition of gigabyte to be the 'preferred' one for the purposes of 'U.S. trade and commerce' ... The California Legislature has likewise adopted the decimal system for all 'transactions in this state'.\"\nEarlier lawsuits had ended in settlement with no court ruling on the question, such as a lawsuit against drive manufacturer Western Digital. Western Digital settled the challenge and added explicit disclaimers to products that the usable capacity may differ from the advertised capacity.\nSeagate was sued on similar grounds and also settled.\nOther contexts.\nBecause of their physical design, the capacity of modern computer random-access memory devices, such as DIMM modules, is always a multiple of a power of 1024. It is thus convenient to use prefixes denoting powers of 1024, known as binary prefixes, in describing them. For example, a memory capacity of (10243 B) is conveniently expressed as 1\u00a0GiB rather than as 1.074\u00a0GB. The former specification is, however, often quoted as \"1\u00a0GB\" when applied to random-access memory.\nSoftware allocates memory in varying degrees of granularity as needed to fulfill data structure requirements and binary multiples are usually not required. Other computer capacities and rates, like storage hardware size, data transfer rates, clock speeds, operations per second, etc. are usually presented in decimal units. For example, the manufacturer of a \"300\u00a0GB\" hard drive is claiming a capacity of , not 300\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010243 (which would be ) bytes.\nUnicode character.\nThe \"gigabyte\" symbol is encoded by Unicode at code point .\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

They form the densest part of the large-scale structure of the Universe. In models for the gravitational formation of structure with cold dark matter, the smallest structures collapse first and eventually build the largest structures, clusters of galaxies. Clusters are then formed relatively recently between 10 billion years ago and now. Groups and clusters may contain ten to thousands of individual galaxies. The clusters themselves are often associated with larger, non-gravitationally bound, groups called superclusters.\nGroups of galaxies.\nGroups of galaxies are the smallest aggregates of galaxies. They typically contain no more than 50 galaxies in a diameter of 1 to 2 megaparsecs (Mpc)(see 1022 m for distance comparisons). Their mass is approximately 1013 solar masses. The spread of velocities for the individual galaxies is about 150\u00a0km/s. However, this definition should be used as a guide only, as larger and more massive galaxy systems are sometimes classified as galaxy groups. Groups are the most common structures of galaxies in the universe, comprising at least 50% of the galaxies in the local universe. Groups have a mass range between those of the very large elliptical galaxies and clusters of galaxies.\nOur own galaxy, the Milky Way, is contained in the Local Group of more than 54 galaxies.\nIn July 2017 S. Paul, R. S. John et al. defined clear distinguishing parameters for classifying galaxy aggregations as 'galaxy groups' and 'clusters' on the basis of scaling laws that they followed. According to this paper, galaxy aggregations less massive than 8 \u00d7 1013 solar masses are classified as galaxy groups.\nClusters of galaxies.\nClusters are larger than groups, although there is no sharp dividing line between the two. When observed visually, clusters appear to be collections of galaxies held together by mutual gravitational attraction. However, their velocities are too large for them to remain gravitationally bound by their mutual attractions, implying the presence of either an additional invisible mass component, or an additional attractive force besides gravity. X-ray studies have revealed the presence of large amounts of intergalactic gas known as the intracluster medium. This gas is very hot, between 107K and 108K, and hence emits X-rays in the form of bremsstrahlung and atomic line emission.\nThe total mass of the gas is greater than that of the galaxies by roughly a factor of two. However, this is still not enough mass to keep the galaxies in the cluster. Since this gas is in approximate hydrostatic equilibrium with the overall cluster gravitational field, the total mass distribution can be determined. It turns out the total mass deduced from this measurement is approximately six times larger than the mass of the galaxies or the hot gas. The missing component is known as dark matter and its nature is unknown. In a typical cluster perhaps only 5% of the total mass is in the form of galaxies, maybe 10% in the form of hot X-ray emitting gas and the remainder is dark matter. Brownstein and Moffat use a theory of modified gravity to explain X-ray cluster masses without dark matter. Observations of the Bullet Cluster are the strongest evidence for the existence of dark matter; however, Brownstein and Moffat have shown that their modified gravity theory can also account for the properties of the cluster.\nObservational methods.\nClusters of galaxies have been found in surveys by a number of observational techniques and have been studied in detail using many methods:\nTemperature and density.\nClusters of galaxies are the most recent and most massive objects to have arisen in the hierarchical structure formation of the Universe and the study of clusters tells one about the way galaxies form and evolve. Clusters have two important properties: their masses are large enough to retain any energetic gas ejected from member galaxies and the thermal energy of the gas within the cluster is observable within the X-Ray bandpass. The observed state of gas within a cluster is determined by a combination of shock heating during accretion, radiative cooling, and thermal feedback triggered by that cooling. The density, temperature, and substructure of the intracluster X-Ray gas therefore represents the entire thermal history of cluster formation. To better understand this thermal history one needs to study the entropy of the gas because entropy is the quantity most directly changed by increasing or decreasing the thermal energy of intracluster gas.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Its name is Latin for the crane, a type of bird. It is one of twelve constellations conceived by Petrus Plancius from the observations of Pieter Dirkszoon Keyser and Frederick de Houtman. Grus first appeared on a celestial globe published in 1598 in Amsterdam by Plancius and Jodocus Hondius and was depicted in Johann Bayer's star atlas \"Uranometria\" of 1603. French explorer and astronomer Nicolas-Louis de Lacaille gave Bayer designations to its stars in 1756, some of which had been previously considered part of the neighbouring constellation Piscis Austrinus. The constellations Grus, Pavo, Phoenix and Tucana are collectively known as the \"Southern Birds\".\nThe constellation's brightest star, Alpha Gruis, is also known as Alnair and appears as a 1.7-magnitude blue-white star. Beta Gruis is a red giant variable star with a minimum magnitude of 2.3 and a maximum magnitude of 2.0. Six star systems have been found to have planets: the red dwarf Gliese 832 is one of the closest stars to Earth to have a planetary system. Another\u2014WASP-95\u2014has a planet that orbits every two days. Deep-sky objects found in Grus include the planetary nebula IC 5148, also known as the Spare Tyre Nebula, and a group of four interacting galaxies known as the Grus Quartet.\nHistory.\nThe stars that form Grus were originally considered part of the neighbouring constellation Piscis Austrinus (the southern fish), with Gamma Gruis seen as part of the fish's tail. The stars were first defined as a separate constellation by the astronomer Petrus Plancius, who created twelve new constellations based on the observations of the southern sky by the Dutch explorers Pieter Dirkszoon Keyser and Frederick de Houtman, who had sailed on the first Dutch trading expedition, known as the \"Eerste Schipvaart\", to the East Indies. Grus first appeared on a 35-centimetre-diameter celestial globe published in 1598 in Amsterdam by Plancius with Jodocus Hondius. Its first depiction in a celestial atlas was in the German cartographer Johann Bayer's \"Uranometria\" of 1603. De Houtman included it in his southern star catalogue the same year under the Dutch name \"Den Reygher\", \"The Heron\", but Bayer followed Plancius and Hondius in using Grus.\nAn alternative name for the constellation, \"Phoenicopterus\" (Latin \"flamingo\"), was used briefly during the early 17th century, seen in the 1605 work \"Cosmographiae Generalis\" by Paul Merula of Leiden University and a c. 1625 globe by Dutch globe maker Pieter van den Keere. Astronomer Ian Ridpath has reported the symbolism likely came from Plancius originally, who had worked with both of these people. Grus and the nearby constellations Phoenix, Tucana and Pavo are collectively called the \"Southern Birds\".\nThe stars that correspond to Grus were generally too far south to be seen from China. In Chinese astronomy, Gamma and Lambda Gruis may have been included in the tub-shaped asterism \"B\u00e0iji\u00f9\", along with stars from Piscis Austrinus. In Central Australia, the Arrernte and Luritja people living on a mission in Hermannsburg viewed the sky as divided between them, east of the Milky Way representing Arrernte camps and west denoting Luritja camps. Alpha and Beta Gruis, along with Fomalhaut, Alpha Pavonis and the stars of Musca, were all claimed by the Arrernte.\nCharacteristics.\nGrus is bordered by Piscis Austrinus to the north, Sculptor to the northeast, Phoenix to the east, Tucana to the south, Indus to the southwest, and Microscopium to the west. Bayer straightened the tail of Piscis Austrinus to make way for Grus in his \"Uranometria\". Covering 366 square degrees, it ranks 45th of the 88 modern constellations in size and covers 0.887% of the night sky. The three-letter abbreviation for the constellation, as adopted by the International Astronomical Union in 1922, is \"Gru\". The official constellation boundaries, as set by Belgian astronomer Eug\u00e8ne Delporte in 1930, are defined as a polygon of 6 segments. In the equatorial coordinate system, the right ascension coordinates of these borders lie between 21h 27.4m and 23h 27.1m, while the declination coordinates are between \u221236.31\u00b0 and \u221256.39\u00b0. Grus is located too far south to be seen by observers in the British Isles and the northern United States, though it can easily be seen from Florida or San Diego; the whole constellation is visible to observers south of latitude 33\u00b0N.\nFeatures.\nStars.\nKeyser and de Houtman assigned twelve stars to the constellation. Bayer depicted Grus on his chart, but did not assign its stars Bayer designations. French explorer and astronomer Nicolas-Louis de Lacaille labelled them Alpha to Phi in 1756 with some omissions. In 1879, American astronomer Benjamin Gould added Kappa, Nu, Omicron and Xi, which had all been catalogued by Lacaille but not given Bayer designations. Lacaille considered them too faint, while Gould thought otherwise. Xi Gruis had originally been placed in Microscopium. Conversely, Gould dropped Lacaille's Sigma as he thought it was too dim.\nGrus has several bright stars. Marking the left wing is Alpha Gruis, a blue-white star of spectral type B6V and apparent magnitude 1.7, around 101 light-years from Earth. Its traditional name, Alnair, means \"the bright one\" and refers to its status as the brightest star in Grus (although the Arabians saw it as the brightest star in the Fish's tail, as Grus was then depicted).http:// Alnair is around 380 times as luminous and has over 3 times the diameter of the Sun. Lying 5 degrees west of Alnair, denoting the Crane's heart is Beta Gruis (the proper name is Tiaki), a red giant of spectral type M5III. It has a diameter of 0.8 astronomical units (AU) (if placed in the Solar System it would extend to the orbit of Venus) located around 170 light-years from Earth. It is a variable star with a minimum magnitude of 2.3 and a maximum magnitude of 2.0. An imaginary line drawn from the Great Square of Pegasus through Fomalhaut will lead to Alnair and Beta Gruis.\nLying in the northwest corner of the constellation and marking the crane's eye is Gamma Gruis, a blue-white subgiant of spectral type B8III and magnitude 3.0 lying around 211 light-years from Earth. Also known as Al Dhanab, it has finished fusing its core hydrogen and has begun cooling and expanding, which will see it transform into a red giant.\nThere are several double stars visible to the naked eye in Grus. Forming a triangle with Alnair and Beta, Delta Gruis is an optical double whose components\u2014Delta1 and Delta2\u2014are separated by 45 arcseconds. Delta1 is a yellow giant of spectral type G7III and magnitude 4.0, 309 light-years from Earth, and may have its own magnitude 12 orange dwarf companion. Delta2 is a red giant of spectral type M4.5III and semiregular variable that ranges between magnitudes 3.99 and 4.2, located 325 light-years from Earth. It has around 3 times the mass and 135 times the diameter of the Sun. Mu Gruis, composed of Mu1 and Mu2, is also an optical double\u2014both stars are yellow giants of spectral type G8III around 2.5 times as massive as the Sun with surface temperatures of around 4900 K. Mu1 is the brighter of the two at magnitude 4.8 located around 275 light-years from Earth, while Mu2 the dimmer at magnitude 5.11 lies 265 light-years distant from Earth. Pi Gruis, an optical double with a variable component, is composed of Pi1 Gruis and Pi2. Pi1 is a semi-regular red giant of spectral type S5, ranging from magnitude 5.31 to 7.01 over a period of 191 days, and is around 532 light-years from Earth. One of the brightest S-class stars to Earth viewers, it has a companion star of apparent magnitude 10.9 with sunlike properties, being a yellow main sequence star of spectral type G0V. The pair make up a likely binary system. Pi2 is a giant star of spectral type F3III-IV located around 130 light-years from Earth, and is often brighter than its companion at magnitude 5.6. Marking the right wing is Theta Gruis, yet another double star, lying 5 degrees east of Delta1 and Delta2.\nRZ Gruis is a binary system of apparent magnitude 12.3 with occasional dimming to 13.4, whose components\u2014a white dwarf and main sequence star\u2014are thought to orbit each other roughly every 8.5 to 10 hours. It belongs to the UX Ursae Majoris subgroup of cataclysmic variable star systems, where material from the donor star is drawn to the white dwarf where it forms an accretion disc that remains bright and outshines the two component stars. The system is poorly understood, though the donor star has been calculated to be of spectral type F5V. These stars have spectra very similar to novae that have returned to quiescence after outbursts, yet they have not been observed to have erupted themselves. The American Association of Variable Star Observers recommends watching them for future events. CE Gruis (also known as Grus V-1) is a faint (magnitude 18\u201321) star system also composed of a white dwarf and donor star; in this case the two are so close they are tidally locked. Known as polars, material from the donor star does not form an accretion disc around the white dwarf, but rather streams directly onto it.\nSix star systems are thought to have planetary systems. Tau1 Gruis is a yellow star of magnitude 6.0 located around 106 light-years away. It may be a main sequence star or be just beginning to depart from the sequence as it expands and cools. In 2002 the star was found to have a planetary companion. HD 215456, HD 213240 and WASP-95 are yellow sunlike stars discovered to have two planets, a planet and a remote red dwarf, and a hot Jupiter, respectively; this last\u2014WASP-95b\u2014completes an orbit round its sun in a mere two days. Gliese 832 is a red dwarf of spectral type M1.5V and apparent magnitude 8.66 located only 16.1 light-years distant; hence it is one of the nearest stars to the Solar System. A Jupiter-like planet\u2014Gliese 832 b\u2014orbiting the red dwarf over a period of 9.4\u00b10.4 years was discovered in 2008. WISE 2220\u22123628 is a brown dwarf of spectral type Y, and hence one of the coolest star-like objects known. It has been calculated as being around 26 light-years distant from Earth.\nIn July 2019, astronomers reported finding a star, S5-HVS1, traveling , faster that any other star detected so far. The star is in the Grus constellation in the southern sky, and about 29,000 light-years from Earth, and may have been propelled out of the Milky Way galaxy after interacting with Sagittarius A*, the supermassive black hole at the center of the galaxy.\nDeep-sky objects.\nNicknamed the spare-tyre nebula, IC 5148 is a planetary nebula located around 1 degree west of Lambda Gruis. Around 3000 light-years distant, it is expanding at 50 kilometres a second, one of the fastest rates of expansion of all planetary nebulae.\nNortheast of Theta Gruis are four interacting galaxies known as the Grus Quartet. These galaxies are NGC 7552, NGC 7590, NGC 7599, and NGC 7582. The latter three galaxies occupy an area of sky only 10 arcminutes across and are sometimes referred to as the \"Grus Triplet,\" although all four are part of a larger loose group of galaxies called the IC 1459 Grus Group. NGC 7552 and 7582 are exhibiting high starburst activity; this is thought to have arisen because of the tidal forces from interacting. Located on the border of Grus with Piscis Austrinus, IC 1459 is a peculiar E3 giant elliptical galaxy. It has a fast counterrotating stellar core, and shells and ripples in its outer region. The galaxy has an apparent magnitude of 11.9 and is around 80 million light-years distant.\nNGC 7424 is a barred spiral galaxy with an apparent magnitude of 10.4. located around 4 degrees west of the Grus Triplet. Approximately 37.5 million light-years distant, it is about 100,000 light-years in diameter, has well defined spiral arms and is thought to resemble the Milky Way. Two ultraluminous X-ray sources and one supernova have been observed in NGC 7424. SN 2001ig was discovered in 2001 and classified as a Type IIb supernova, one that initially showed a weak hydrogen line in its spectrum, but this emission later became undetectable and was replaced by lines of oxygen, magnesium and calcium, as well as other features that resembled the spectrum of a Type Ib supernova. A massive star of spectral type F, A or B is thought to be the surviving binary companion to SN 2001ig, which was believed to have been a Wolf\u2013Rayet star.\nLocated near Alnair is NGC 7213, a face-on type 1 Seyfert galaxy located approximately 71.7 million light-years from Earth. It has an apparent magnitude of 12.1.

{"id": "12576", "revid": "199747", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=12576", "title": "Galba", "text": "Roman emperor from AD 68 to 69\nGalba ( ; born Servius Sulpicius Galba; 24 December 3 BC \u2013 15 January AD 69) was Roman emperor, ruling for 7 months from 8 June AD 68 to 15 January 69. He was the first emperor in the Year of the Four Emperors and assumed the throne following Emperor Nero's suicide.\nBorn into a wealthy family, Galba held at various times the positions of praetor, consul, and governor of the provinces of Gallia Aquitania, Germania Superior, and Africa during the first half of the first century AD. He retired from his positions during the latter part of Claudius' reign (with the advent of Agrippina the Younger), but Nero later granted him the governorship of Hispania. Taking advantage of the defeat of Vindex's rebellion and Nero's suicide, he became emperor with the support of the Praetorian Guard.\nGalba's physical weakness and general apathy led to his rule being dominated by favorites. Unable to gain popularity with the people or maintain the support of the Praetorian Guard, Galba was murdered on the orders of Otho, who became emperor in his place.\nOrigins and family life.\nGalba was not related to any of the emperors of the Julio-Claudian dynasty, but he was a member of a distinguished noble family. The origin of the cognomen Galba is uncertain. Suetonius offers a number of possible explanations; the first member of the gens Sulpicia to bear the name might have gotten the name from the term \"galba\", which the Romans used to describe the Gauls, or after an insect called \"galbae\". One of Galba's ancestors had been consul in 200 BC, and another of his ancestors was consul in 144 BC; the later emperor's father and brother, both named Gaius, would hold the office in 5 BC and AD 22 respectively. \nGalba's grandfather was a historian and his son was a barrister whose first marriage was to Mummia Achaica, granddaughter of Quintus Lutatius Catulus and great-granddaughter of Lucius Mummius Achaicus; Galba prided himself on his descent from his great-grandfather Catulus. According to Suetonius, he fabricated a genealogy of paternal descent from the god Jupiter and maternal descent from the legendary Pasipha\u00eb, wife of Minos. Reportedly, Galba was distantly related to Livia to whom he had much respect and in turn by whom he was advanced in his career; in her will she left him fifty million sesterces; Emperor Tiberius however cheated Galba by reducing the amount to five hundred thousand sesterces and never even paid Galba the reduced amount.\nServius Sulpicius Galba was born near Terracina on 24 December 3 BC. His elder brother Gaius fled from Rome and committed suicide because the emperor Tiberius would not allow him to control a Roman province. Livia Ocellina became the second wife of Galba's father, whom she may have married because of his wealth; he was short and hunchbacked. Ocellina adopted Galba, and he took the name \"Lucius Livius Ocella Sulpicius Galba\", although he probably kept his original name in unofficial context, as evidenced by the fact that he reverted to it upon his accession as emperor. Galba preferred males over females in terms of sexual attraction; according to Suetonius, he \"preferred full-grown, strong men\". Nevertheless, he married a woman named Aemilia Lepida and had two sons. Aemilia and their sons died during the early years of the reign of Claudius (r. 41\u201354). Galba would remain a widower for the rest of his life.\nPublic service.\nGalba became praetor in about 30, then governor of Aquitania for about a year, then consul in 33. In 39 the emperor Caligula learned of a plot against himself in which Gnaeus Cornelius Lentulus Gaetulicus, the general of the legions of Germania Superior, was an important figure; Caligula installed Galba in the post held by Gaetulicus. According to one report Galba ran alongside Caligula's chariot for twenty miles. As commander of the legions of Germania Superior, Galba gained a reputation as a disciplinarian. Suetonius writes that Galba was advised to take the throne following the assassination of Caligula in 41, but loyally served Caligula's uncle and successor Claudius (r. 41\u201354); this story may simply be fictional. Galba was appointed as governor of Africa in 44 or 45. He retired at an uncertain time during the reign of Claudius, possibly in 49. He was recalled in 59 or 60 by the emperor Nero (r. 54\u201368) to govern Hispania.\nA rebellion against Nero was orchestrated by Gaius Julius Vindex in Gaul on the anniversary of the death of Nero's mother, Agrippina the Younger, in 68. Shortly afterwards Galba, in rebellion against Nero, rejected the title \"General of Caesar\" in favor of \"General of The Senate and People of Rome\". He was supported by the imperial official Tigellinus. At midnight on 8 June, another imperial official, Nymphidius Sabinus, falsely announced to the Praetorian Guard that Nero had fled to Egypt, and the Senate proclaimed Galba emperor. Nero then committed assisted suicide with help from his secretary.\nEmperor.\nRule (June 68-January 69).\nUpon becoming emperor, Galba was faced by the rebellion of Nymphidius Sabinus, who had his own aspirations for the imperial throne. However, Sabinus was killed by the Praetorians before he could take the throne. While Galba was arriving to Rome with the Lusitanian governor Marcus Salvius Otho, his army was attacked by a legion that had been organized by Nero; a number of Galba's troops were killed in the fighting. Galba, who suffered from chronic gout by the time he came to the throne, was advised by a corrupt group which included the general Titus Vinius, commander of one of the legions in Hispania; the praetorian prefect Cornelius Laco; and Icelus, a freedman of Galba. Galba seized the property of Roman citizens, dismissed his Germanic bodyguards, and did not pay the Praetorians and the soldiers who fought against Vindex. These actions caused him to become unpopular.\nSuetonius wrote the following descriptions of Galba's character and physical description:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Even before he reached middle life, he persisted in keeping up an old and forgotten custom of his country, which survived only in his own household, of having his freedmen and slaves appear before him twice a day in a body, greeting him in the morning and bidding him farewell at evening, one by one.&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;His double reputation for cruelty and avarice had gone before him; men said that he had punished the cities of the Spanish and Gallic provinces which had hesitated about taking sides with him by heavier taxes and some even by the razing of their walls, putting to death the governors and imperial deputies along with their wives and children. Further, that he had melted down a golden crown of fifteen pounds weight, which the people of Tarraco had taken from their ancient temple of Jupiter and presented to him, with orders that the three ounces which were found lacking be exacted from them. This reputation was confirmed and even augmented immediately on his arrival in the city. For having compelled some marines whom Nero had made regular soldiers to return to their former position as rowers, upon their refusing and obstinately demanding an eagle and standards, he not only dispersed them by a cavalry charge, but even decimated them. He also disbanded a cohort of Germans, whom the previous Caesars had made their body-guard and had found absolutely faithful in many emergencies, and sent them back to their native country without any rewards, alleging that they were more favourably inclined towards Gnaeus Dolabella, near whose gardens they had their camp. The following tales too were told in mockery of him, whether truly or falsely: that when an unusually elegant dinner was set before him, he groaned aloud; that when his duly appointed steward presented his expense account, he handed him a dish of beans in return for his industry and carefulness; and that when the flute player Canus greatly pleased him, he presented him with five denarii, which he took from his own purse with his own hand.&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Accordingly, his coming was not so welcome as it might have been, and this was apparent at the first performance in the theatre; for when the actors of an Atellan farce began the familiar lines \"Here comes Onesimus from his farm\" all the spectators at once finished the song in chorus and repeated it several times with appropriate gestures, beginning with that verse.\nThus his popularity and prestige were greater when he won, than while he ruled the empire, though he gave many proofs of being an excellent prince; but he was by no means so much loved for those qualities as he was hated for his acts of the opposite character.\u2014\u200a\nParticularly bad was his becoming under the influence of Vinius, Laco and Icelus: \n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;...To these brigands, each with his different vice, he so entrusted and handed himself over as their tool, that his conduct was far from consistent; for now he was more exacting and niggardly, and now more extravagant and reckless than became a prince chosen by the people and of his time of life.\nHe condemned to death distinguished men of both orders on trivial suspicions without a trial. He rarely granted Roman citizenship, and the privileges of threefold paternity to hardly one or two, and even to those only for a fixed and limited time. When the jurors petitioned that a sixth division be added to their number, he not only refused, but even deprived them of the privilege granted by Claudius, of not being summoned for court duty in winter and at the beginning of the year.\u2014\u200a\nIn regard to his appointment of Vitellius to Germania Inferior:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Galba surprised everyone by sending him to Lower Germany. Some think that it was due to Titus Vinius, who had great influence at the time, and whose friendship Vitellius had long since won through their common support of the Blues. But since Galba openly declared that no men were less to be feared than those who thought of nothing but eating, and that Vitellius's bottomless gullet might be filled from the resources of the province, it is clear to anyone that he was chosen rather through contempt than favour.\u2014\u200a\nFurther on his physical appearance and end of reign:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;He was of average height, very bald, with blue eyes and a hooked nose. His hands and feet were so distorted by gout that he could not endure a shoe for long, unroll a book, or even hold one. The flesh on his right side too had grown out and hung down to such an extent, that it could with difficulty be held in place by a bandage. It is said that he was a heavy eater and in winter time was in the habit of taking food even before daylight, while at dinner he helped himself so lavishly that he would have the leavings which remained in a heap before him passed along and distributed among the attendants who waited on him... He met his end in the seventy-third year of his age and the seventh month of his reign. The senate, as soon as it was allowed to do so, voted him a statue standing upon a column adorned with the beaks of ships, in the part of the Forum where he was slain; but Vespasian annulled this decree, believing that Galba had sent assassins from Spain to Judaea, to take his life.\u2014\u200a\nTacitus comments on the character of Galba: \"He seemed too great to be a subject so long as he was subject, and all would have agreed that he was equal to the imperial office if he had never held it.\"\nSuetonius went on to say that Galba was visited by the Roman Goddess Fortuna in his dreams twice; on the latter occasion she \"withdrew her support\". This happened right before his later downfall.\nMutiny on the frontier and assassination.\nOn 1 January 69, the day Galba and Vinius took the office of consul, the fourth and twenty-second legions of Germania Superior refused to swear loyalty to Galba. They toppled his statues, demanding that a new emperor be chosen. On the following day, the soldiers of Germania Inferior also refused to swear their loyalty and proclaimed the governor of the province, Aulus Vitellius, as emperor. Galba tried to ensure his authority as emperor was recognised by adopting the nobleman Lucius Calpurnius Piso Licinianus as his successor. Nevertheless, Galba was killed by the Praetorians on 15 January. Otho was angry that he had been passed over for adoption, and organised a conspiracy with a small number of Praetorian Guards to murder the aged emperor and elevate himself. The soldiery in the capital, composed not just of Praetorians but of Galba's legion from Hispania and several detachments of men from the Roman fleet, Illyria, Britannia, and Germania, were angered at not having received a donative. They also resented Galba's purges of their officers and fellow soldiers (this was especially true of the men from the fleet). Many in the Praetorian Guard were shaken by the recent murder of their Prefect Nymphidius Sabinus \u2013 some of the waverers were convinced to come over to Otho's side out of fear Galba might yet take revenge on them for their connection to Sabinus.\nAccording to Suetonius, Galba put on a linen corset although remarking it was little protection against so many swords; when a soldier claimed to have killed Otho, Galba snapped \"On what authority?\". He was lured out to the scene of his assassination in the Forum by a false report of the conspirators. Galba either tried to buy his life with a promise of the withheld bounty or asked that he be beheaded. The only help for him was a centurion in the Praetorian Guard named Sempronius Densus, who was killed trying to defend Galba with a pugio; one hundred and twenty persons later petitioned Otho that they had killed Galba; they would be executed by Vitellius. A company of Germanic soldiers to whom he had once done a kindness rushed to help him; however they took a wrong turn and arrived too late. He was killed near the Lacus Curtius. Vinius tried to run away, calling out that Otho had not ordered him killed, but was run through with a spear. Laco was banished to an island where he was later murdered by soldiers of Otho. Icelus was publicly executed. Piso was also killed; his head along with Galba's and Vinius' were placed on poles and Otho was then acclaimed as emperor. Galba's head was brought by a soldier to Otho's camp where camp boys mocked it on a lance \u2013 Galba had angered them previously by remarking his vigor was still unimpeded. Vinius' head was sold to his daughter for 2500 drachmas; Piso's head was given to his wife. Galba's head was bought for 100 gold pieces by a freeman who threw it at Sessorium where his master Patrobius Neronianus had been killed by Galba. The body of Galba was taken up by Priscus Helvidius with the permission of Otho; at night Galba's steward Argivus took both the head and body to a tomb in Galba's private gardens on the Aurelian Way.&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography.\nAncient sources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nModern sources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It has the symbol G.\n\"Giga-\" is derived from the Greek word (\"g\u00edgas\"), meaning \"giant\". The \"Oxford English Dictionary\" reports the earliest written use of \"giga\" in this sense to be in the Reports of the IUPAC 14th Conf\u00e9rence Internationale de Chimie in 1947: \"The following prefixes to abbreviations for the names of units should be used: G giga 109\u00d7.\" However, it was already used in 1932 by the German organization \"Verband deutscher Elektrotechniker\".\nWhen referring to information units in computing, such as gigabyte, giga may sometimes mean (230); this causes ambiguity. Standards organizations discourage this and use giga- to refer to 109 in this context too. \"Gigabit\" is only rarely used with the binary interpretation of the prefix. The binary prefix gibi has been adopted for 230, while reserving \"giga\" exclusively for the metric definition.\nPronunciation.\nIn English, the prefix \"giga\" can be pronounced (a hard \"g\" as in \"giggle\"), or (a soft \"g\" as in \"gigantic\", which shares \"giga\"'s Ancient Greek root). A prominent example of this latter pronunciation is found in the pronunciation of \"gigawatts\" in the 1985 film \"Back to the Future\".\nAccording to the American writer Kevin Self, a German committee member of the International Electrotechnical Commission proposed \"giga\" as a prefix for 109 in the 1920s, drawing on a verse (evidently \"Anto-logie\") by the German humorous poet Christian Morgenstern that appeared in the third (1908) edition of his (Gallows Songs). This suggests that a hard German was originally intended as the pronunciation. Self was unable to ascertain when the (soft \"g\") pronunciation came into occasional use, but claimed that as of 1995 it had returned to (hard \"g\").\nIn 1998, a poll by the phonetician John C. Wells found that 84% of Britons preferred the pronunciation of \"gigabyte\" starting with (as in \"gig\"), 9% with (as in \"jig\"), 6% with (\"guy\"), and 1% with (as in \"giant\").\nBinary prefix.\nThe notation represents 1,000,000,000 bytes or, in deprecated usage, 1,073,741,824 (230) bytes.

{"id": "12578", "revid": "125972", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=12578", "title": "George Stephenson", "text": "British mechanical and civil engineer (1781\u20131848)\n \nGeorge Stephenson (9 June 1781 \u2013 12 August 1848) was a British civil engineer and mechanical engineer. Renowned as the \"Father of Railways\", Stephenson was considered by the Victorians as a great example of diligent application and thirst for improvement. His chosen rail gauge, sometimes called \"Stephenson gauge\", was the basis for the standard gauge used by most of the world's railways.\nPioneered by Stephenson, rail transport was one of the most important technological inventions of the 19th century and a key component of the Industrial Revolution. Built by George and his son Robert's company Robert Stephenson and Company, the \"Locomotion\" No. 1 was the first steam locomotive to carry passengers on a public rail line, the Stockton and Darlington Railway in 1825. George also built the first public inter-city railway line in the world to use locomotives, the Liverpool and Manchester Railway, which opened in 1830. Following this, according to \"Encyclopedia Britannica\", \"Stephenson continued as the chief guide of the revolutionary transportation medium, solving problems of roadway construction, bridge design, and locomotive and rolling-stock manufacture. He built many other railways in the Midlands, and he acted as consultant on many railroad projects at home and abroad.\"\nChildhood.\nGeorge Stephenson was born on 9 June 1781 in Wylam, Northumberland, which is 9 miles (15\u00a0km) west of Newcastle upon Tyne. He was the second child of Robert and Mabel Stephenson, neither of whom could read or write. Robert was the fireman for Wylam Colliery pumping engine, earning a very low wage, so there was no money for schooling. At 17, Stephenson became an engineman at Water Row Pit in Newburn nearby. George realised the value of education and paid to study at night school to learn reading, writing and arithmetic \u2013 he was illiterate until the age of 18.\nIn 1801 he began work at Black Callerton Colliery south of Ponteland as a 'brakesman', controlling the winding gear at the pit. In 1802 he married Frances Henderson and moved to Willington Quay, east of Newcastle. There he worked as a brakesman while they lived in one room of a cottage. George made shoes and mended clocks to supplement his income.\nTheir first child Robert was born in 1803, and in 1804 they moved to Dial Cottage at West Moor, near Killingworth where George worked as a brakesman at Killingworth Pit. Their second child, a daughter, was born in July 1805. She was named Frances after her mother. The child died after just three weeks and was buried in St Bartholomew's Church, Long Benton north of Newcastle.\nIn 1806 George's wife Frances died of consumption, which would nowadays be termed as tuberculosis. She was buried in the same churchyard as their daughter on 16 May 1806, though the location of the grave is lost.\nGeorge decided to find work in Scotland and left Robert with a local woman while he went to work in Montrose in Scotland. After a few months he returned, probably because his father had been blinded in a mining accident. He moved back into a cottage at West Moor and his unmarried sister Eleanor moved in to look after Robert. In 1811 the pumping engine at High Pit, Killingworth was not working properly and Stephenson offered to improve it. He did so with such success that he was promoted to enginewright for the collieries at Killingworth, responsible for maintaining and repairing all the colliery engines. He became an expert in steam-driven machinery.\nEarly projects.\nThe Safety Lamp.\nIn 1815, aware of the explosions often caused in mines by naked flames, Stephenson began to experiment with a safety lamp that would burn in a gaseous atmosphere without causing an explosion. At the same time, the eminent scientist and Cornishman Humphry Davy was also looking at the problem. Despite his lack of scientific knowledge, Stephenson, by trial and error, devised a lamp in which the air entered via tiny holes, through which the flames of the lamp could not pass.\nA month before Davy presented his design to the Royal Society, Stephenson demonstrated his own lamp to two witnesses by taking it down Killingworth Colliery and holding it in front of a fissure from which firedamp was issuing. The two designs differed; Davy's lamp was surrounded by a screen of gauze, whereas Stephenson's prototype lamp had a perforated plate containing a glass cylinder. For his invention Davy was awarded \u00a32000, whilst Stephenson was accused of stealing the idea from Davy, because he was not seen as an adequate scientist who could have produced the lamp by any approved scientific method.\nStephenson, having come from the North-East, spoke with a broad Northumberland accent and not the 'Language of Parliament,' which made him seem lowly. Realizing this, he made a point of educating his son Robert in a private school, where he was taught to speak in Standard English with a Received Pronunciation accent. It was due to this, in their future dealings with Parliament, that it became clear that the authorities preferred Robert to his father.\nA local committee of enquiry gathered in support of Stephenson, exonerated him, proved he had been working separately to create the 'Geordie Lamp', and awarded him \u00a31,000, but Davy and his supporters refused to accept their findings, and would not see how an uneducated man such as Stephenson could come up with the solution he had. In 1833 a House of Commons committee found that Stephenson had equal claim to having invented the safety lamp. Davy went to his grave believing that Stephenson had stolen his idea. The Stephenson lamp was used almost exclusively in North East England, whereas the Davy lamp was used everywhere else. The experience gave Stephenson a lifelong distrust of London-based, theoretical, scientific experts.\nIn his book \"George and Robert Stephenson\", the author L.T.C. Rolt relates that opinion varied about the two lamps' efficiency: that the Davy Lamp gave more light, but the Geordie Lamp was thought to be safer in a more gaseous atmosphere. He made reference to an incident at Oaks Colliery in Barnsley where both lamps were in use. Following a sudden strong influx of gas the tops of all the Davy Lamps became red hot (which had in the past caused an explosion, and in so doing risked another), whilst all the Geordie Lamps simply went out.\nThere is a theory that it was Stephenson who indirectly gave the name of \"Geordies\" to the people of the North East of England. By this theory, the name of the Geordie Lamp attached to the North East pit men themselves. By 1866 any native of Newcastle upon Tyne could be called a Geordie.\nLocomotives.\nCornishman Richard Trevithick is credited with steam engine research and development, leading to what has been variously described as \"the first steam-powered passenger vehicle\", or \"his first high-pressure steam locomotive\", in both cases referring to his unveiling and testing of the \"Puffing Devil\" (or simply, \"Puffer\") on 24 December 1801. This was a result of his refinements of the steam engine of James Watt toward \"strong [high pressure] steam\", Watt believing this direction of development too dangerous. Evident from both accounts is that this first strong steam \"locomotive\" operated without tracks, because it was three years later that Trevithick was successful in producing a steam engine that operated on rails. Later, he visited Tyneside and built an engine there for a mine-owner. Several local men were inspired by this, and designed their own engines.\nStephenson designed his first locomotive in 1814, a travelling engine designed for hauling coal on the Killingworth wagonway named \"Bl\u00fccher\" after the Prussian general Gebhard Leberecht von Bl\u00fccher (It was suggested the name sprang from Bl\u00fccher's rapid march of his army in support of Wellington at Waterloo). \"Bl\u00fccher\" was modelled on Matthew Murray's locomotive \"Willington\", which George studied at Kenton and Coxlodge colliery on Tyneside, and was constructed in the colliery workshop behind Stephenson's home, Dial Cottage, on Great Lime Road. The locomotive could haul 30 tons of coal up a hill at , and was the first successful flanged-wheel adhesion locomotive: its traction depended on contact between its flanged wheels and the rail.\nAltogether, Stephenson is said to have produced 16 locomotives at Killingworth, although it has not proved possible to produce a convincing list of all 16. Of those identified, most were built for use at Killingworth or for the Hetton colliery railway. A six-wheeled locomotive was built for the Kilmarnock and Troon Railway in 1817 but was withdrawn from service because of damage to the cast-iron rails. Another locomotive was supplied to Scott's Pit railroad at Llansamlet, near Swansea, in 1819 but it too was withdrawn, apparently because it was under-boilered and again caused damage to the track.\nThe new engines were too heavy to run on wooden rails or plate-way, and iron edge rails were in their infancy, with cast iron exhibiting excessive brittleness. Together with William Losh, Stephenson improved the design of cast-iron edge rails to reduce breakage; rails were briefly made by Losh, Wilson and Bell at their Walker ironworks.\nAccording to Rolt, Stephenson managed to solve the problem caused by the weight of the engine on the primitive rails. He experimented with a steam spring (to 'cushion' the weight using steam pressure acting on pistons to support the locomotive frame), but soon followed the practice of 'distributing' weight by using a number of wheels or bogies. For the Stockton and Darlington Railway Stephenson used wrought-iron malleable rails that he had found satisfactory, notwithstanding the financial loss he suffered by not using his own patented design.\nHetton Railway.\nStephenson was hired to build the eight-mile (13-km) Hetton colliery railway in 1820. He used a combination of gravity on downward inclines and locomotives for level and upward stretches. This, the first railway using no animal power, opened in 1822. This line used a gauge of which Stephenson had used before at the Killingworth wagonway.\nOther locomotives include:\nThe First Railways.\nStockton and Darlington Railway.\nIn 1821, a parliamentary bill was passed to allow the building of the Stockton and Darlington Railway (S&amp;DR). The railway connected collieries near Bishop Auckland to the River Tees at Stockton, passing through Darlington on the way. The original plan was to use horses to draw coal carts on metal rails, but after company director Edward Pease met Stephenson, he agreed to change the plans. Stephenson surveyed the line in 1821, and assisted by his 18-year-old son Robert, construction began the same year.\nA manufacturer was needed to provide the locomotives for the line. Pease and Stephenson had jointly established a company in Newcastle to manufacture locomotives. It was set up as Robert Stephenson and Company, and George's son Robert was the managing director. A fourth partner was Michael Longridge of Bedlington Ironworks. On an early trade card, Robert Stephenson &amp; Co was described as \"Engineers, Millwrights &amp; Machinists, Brass &amp; Iron Founders\". In September 1825, the works at Forth Street, Newcastle, completed the first locomotive for the railway: originally named \"Active\", it was renamed \"Locomotion\" and was followed by \"Hope\", \"Diligence\" and \"Black Diamond\". The Stockton and Darlington Railway opened on 27 September 1825. Driven by Stephenson, \"Locomotion\" hauled an 80-ton load of coal and flour in two hours, reaching a speed of on one stretch. The first purpose-built passenger car, \"Experiment\", was attached and carried dignitaries on the opening journey. It was the first time passenger traffic had been run on a steam locomotive railway.\nThe rails used for the line were wrought-iron, produced by John Birkinshaw at the Bedlington Ironworks. Wrought-iron rails could be produced in longer lengths than cast-iron and were less liable to crack under the weight of heavy locomotives. William Losh of Walker Ironworks thought he had an agreement with Stephenson to supply cast-iron rails, and Stephenson's decision caused a permanent rift between them. The gauge Stephenson chose for the line was which subsequently was adopted as the standard gauge for railways, not only in Britain, but throughout the world.\nLiverpool and Manchester Railway.\nStephenson had ascertained by experiments at Killingworth that half the power of the locomotive was consumed by a gradient as little as 1 in 260. He concluded that railways should be kept as level as possible. He used this knowledge while working on the Bolton and Leigh Railway, and the Liverpool and Manchester Railway (L&amp;MR), executing a series of difficult cuttings, embankments and stone viaducts to level their routes. Defective surveying of the original route of the L&amp;MR caused by hostility from some affected landowners meant Stephenson encountered difficulty during Parliamentary scrutiny of the original bill, especially under cross-examination by Edward Hall Alderson. The bill was rejected and a revised bill for a new alignment was submitted and passed in a subsequent session. The revised alignment presented the problem of crossing Chat Moss, an apparently bottomless peat bog, which Stephenson overcame by unusual means, effectively floating the line across it. The method he used was similar to that used by John Metcalf who constructed many miles of road across marshes in the Pennines, laying a foundation of heather and branches, which became bound together by the weight of the passing coaches, with a layer of stones on top.\nAs the L&amp;MR approached completion in 1829, its directors arranged a competition to decide who would build its locomotives, and the Rainhill Trials were run in October 1829. Entries could weigh no more than six tons and had to travel along the track for a total distance of . Stephenson's entry was \"Rocket\", and its performance in winning the contest made it famous. George's son Robert had been working in South America from 1824 to 1827 and returned to run the Forth Street Works while George was in Liverpool overseeing the construction of the line. Robert was responsible for the detailed design of \"Rocket\", although he was in constant postal communication with his father, who made many suggestions. One significant innovation, suggested by Henry Booth, treasurer of the L&amp;MR, was the use of a fire-tube boiler, invented by French engineer Marc Seguin, that gave improved heat exchange.\nThe opening ceremony of the L&amp;MR, on 15 September 1830, drew luminaries from the government and industry, including the Prime Minister, the Duke of Wellington. The day started with a procession of eight trains setting out from Liverpool. The parade was led by \"Northumbrian\" driven by George Stephenson, and included \"Phoenix\" driven by his son Robert, \"North Star\" driven by his brother Robert and \"Rocket\" driven by assistant engineer Joseph Locke. The day was marred by the death of William Huskisson, the Member of Parliament for Liverpool, who was struck by \"Rocket\". Stephenson evacuated the injured Huskisson to Eccles with a train, but he died from his injuries. Despite the tragedy, the railway was a resounding success. Stephenson became famous, and was offered the position of chief engineer for a wide variety of other railways.\nStephenson's skew arch bridge.\n1830 also saw the grand opening of the skew bridge in Rainhill over the Liverpool and Manchester Railway. The bridge was the first to cross any railway at an angle. It required the structure to be constructed as two flat planes (overlapping in this case by ) between which the stonework forms a parallelogram shape when viewed from above. It has the effect of flattening the arch and the solution is to lay the bricks forming the arch at an angle to the abutments (the piers on which the arches rest). The technique, which results in a spiral effect in the arch masonry, provides extra strength in the arch to compensate for the angled abutments.\nThe bridge is still in use at Rainhill station, and carries traffic on the A57 (Warrington Road). The bridge is a listed structure.\nLater life.\nLife at Alton Grange.\nGeorge Stephenson moved to the parish of Alton Grange (now part of Ravenstone) in Leicestershire in 1830, originally to consult on the Leicester and Swannington Railway, a line primarily proposed to take coal from the western coal fields of the county to Leicester. The promoters of the line Mr William Stenson and Mr John Ellis, had difficulties in raising the necessary capital as the majority of local wealth had been invested in canals. Realising the potential and need for the rail link Stephenson himself invested \u00a32,500 and raised the remaining capital through his network of connections in Liverpool. His son Robert was made chief engineer with the first part of the line opening in 1832.\nDuring this same period the Snibston estate in Leicestershire came up for auction, it lay adjoining the proposed Swannington to Leicester route and was believed to contain valuable coal reserves. Stephenson realising the financial potential of the site, given its proximity to the proposed rail link and the fact that the manufacturing town of Leicester was then being supplied coal by canal from Derbyshire, bought the estate.\nEmploying a previously used method of mining in the midlands called tubbing to access the deep coal seams, his success could not have been greater. Stephenson's coal mine delivered the first rail cars of coal into Leicester dramatically reducing the price of coal and saving the city some \u00a340,000 per annum.\nStephenson remained at Alton Grange until 1838 before moving to Tapton House in Derbyshire.\nLater career.\nThe next ten years were the busiest of Stephenson's life as he was besieged with requests from railway promoters. Many of the first American railroad builders came to Newcastle to learn from Stephenson and the first dozen or so locomotives utilised there were purchased from the Stephenson shops. Stephenson's conservative views on the capabilities of locomotives meant he favoured circuitous routes and civil engineering that were more costly than his successors thought necessary. For example, rather than the West Coast Main Line taking the direct route favoured by Joseph Locke over Shap between Lancaster and Carlisle, Stephenson was in favour of a longer sea-level route via Ulverston and Whitehaven. Locke's route was built.\nStephenson tended to be more casual in estimating costs and paperwork in general. He worked with Joseph Locke on the Grand Junction Railway with half of the line allocated to each man. Stephenson's estimates and organising ability proved inferior to those of Locke and the board's dissatisfaction led to Stephenson's resignation causing a rift between them which was never healed.\nDespite Stephenson's loss of some routes to competitors due to his caution, he was offered more work than he could cope with, and was unable to accept all that was offered. He worked on the North Midland line from Derby to Leeds, the York and North Midland line from Normanton to York, the Manchester and Leeds, the Birmingham and Derby, the Sheffield and Rotherham among many others.\nStephenson became a reassuring name rather than a cutting-edge technical adviser. He was the first president of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers on its formation in 1847. By this time he had settled into semi-retirement, supervising his mining interests in Derbyshire \u2013 tunnelling for the North Midland Railway revealed coal seams, and Stephenson put money into their exploitation.\nPersonal life.\nGeorge first courted Elizabeth (Betty) Hindmarsh, a farmer's daughter from Black Callerton, whom he met secretly in her orchard. Her father refused marriage because of Stephenson's lowly status as a miner. George next paid attention to Anne Henderson where he lodged with her family, but she rejected him and he transferred his attentions to her sister Frances (Fanny), who was nine years his senior. George and Fanny married at Newburn Church on 28 November 1802. They had two children Robert (1803) and Fanny (1805) but the latter died within months. George's wife died, probably of tuberculosis, the year after. While George was working in Scotland, Robert was brought up by a succession of neighbours and then by George's unmarried sister Eleanor (Nelly), who lived with them in Killingworth on George's return.\nOn 29 March 1820, George (now considerably wealthier) married Betty Hindmarsh at Newburn. The marriage seems to have been happy, but there were no children and Betty died on 3 August 1845.\nOn 11 January 1848, at St Chad's Church in Shrewsbury, Shropshire, George married for the third time, to Ellen Gregory, another farmer's daughter originally from Bakewell in Derbyshire, who had been his housekeeper. Seven months after his wedding, George contracted pleurisy and died, aged 67, at noon on Saturday 12 August 1848 at Tapton House in Chesterfield, Derbyshire. He was buried at Holy Trinity Church, Chesterfield, alongside his second wife.\nDescribed by Rolt as a generous man, Stephenson financially supported the wives and families of several who had died in his employment, due to accident or misadventure, some within his family, and some not. He was also a keen gardener throughout his life; during his last years at Tapton House, he built hothouses in the estate gardens, growing exotic fruits and vegetables in a 'not too friendly' rivalry with Joseph Paxton, head gardener at nearby Chatsworth House, twice beating the master of the craft.\nDescendants.\nGeorge Stephenson had two children. His son Robert was born on 16 October 1803. Robert married Frances Sanderson, daughter of a City of London professional John Sanderson, on 17 June 1829. Robert died in 1859 having no children. Robert Stephenson expanded on the work of his father and became a major railway engineer himself. Abroad, Robert was involved in the Alexandria\u2013Cairo railway that later connected with the Suez Canal. George Stephenson's daughter was born in 1805 but died within weeks of her birth. Descendants of the wider Stephenson family continue to live in Wylam (Stephenson's birthplace) today. Also relatives connected by his marriage live in Derbyshire. Some descendants later emigrated to Perth, Australia, and Minnesota, with later generations remaining to this day.\nThis Stephenson engineering family is not to be confused with the lighthouse-building engineering family of Robert Stevenson, which was active in the same era. Note the spelling difference.\nLegacy.\nInfluence.\nBritain led the world in the development of railways which acted as a stimulus for the Industrial Revolution by facilitating the transport of raw materials and manufactured goods. George Stephenson, with his work on the Stockton and Darlington Railway and the Liverpool and Manchester Railway, paved the way for the railway engineers who followed, such as his son Robert, his assistant Joseph Locke who carried out much work on his own account and Isambard Kingdom Brunel. Stephenson was farsighted in realising that the individual lines being built would eventually be joined, and would need to have the same gauge. The standard gauge used throughout much of the world is due to him. In 2002, Stephenson was named in the BBC's television show and list of the \"100 Greatest Britons\" following a UK-wide vote, placing at no. 65.\nThe Victorian self-help advocate Samuel Smiles had published his first biography of George Stephenson in 1857, and although attacked as biased in the favour of George at the expense of his rivals as well as his son, it was popular and 250,000 copies were sold by 1904. The Band of Hope were selling biographies of George in 1859 at a penny a sheet, and at one point there was a suggestion to move George's body to Westminster Abbey. The centenary of George's birth was celebrated in 1881 at Crystal Palace by 15,000 people, and it was George who was featured on the reverse of the Series E five pound note issued by the Bank of England between 1990 and 2003. The Stephenson Railway Museum in North Shields is named after George and Robert Stephenson.\nMemorials.\nGeorge Stephenson's Birthplace is an 18th-century historic house museum in the village of Wylam, Northumberland, England, and is operated by the National Trust. Dial Cottage at West Moor, his home from 1804, remains but the museum that once operated there has closed.\nIn 1862, a memorial to Stephenson by John Graham Lough was erected close to Newcastle Central Station, in his hometown of Newcastle upon Tyne. The memorial shows a bronze statue of Stephenson on a grit-stone base, with four further bronze figures (an engineer, blacksmith, miner, and plate-layer) at the four corners of the base. The statue is Grade II listed.\nChesterfield Museum in Chesterfield, Derbyshire, has a gallery of Stephenson memorabilia, including straight thick glass tubes he invented for growing straight cucumbers. The museum is in the Stephenson Memorial Hall, not far from both Stephenson's final home at Tapton House and Holy Trinity Church within which is his vault. In Liverpool, where he lived at 34 Upper Parliament Street, a City of Liverpool Heritage Plaque is situated next to the front door. A bronze statue of Stephenson was unveiled at Chesterfield railway station (in the town where Stephenson spent the last ten years of his life) on 28 October 2005, marking the completion of improvements to the station. At the event a full-size working replica of the \"Rocket\" was on show, which then spent two days on public display at the Chesterfield Market Festival. \nStephenson College at Durham University, founded in 2001 on Queen's Campus in Stockton-on-Tees but relocated to Durham in 2018, is named after him. Also named after him and his son is George Stephenson High School in Killingworth, Stephenson Memorial Primary School in Howdon, the Stephenson Railway Museum in North Shields, the Stephenson Locomotive Society, the Stephenson Centre, an SEBD Unit of Beaumont Hill School in Darlington, and the Stephenson Building, home of the school of engineering at Newcastle University. His last home in Tapton, Chesterfield is now part of Chesterfield College and is called Tapton House Campus. A statue of Stephenson is located at the Oxford University Museum of Natural History.\nFrom 1990 until 2003, Stephenson's portrait appeared on the reverse of Series E \u00a35 notes issued by the Bank of England. Stephenson's face is shown alongside an engraving of the \"Rocket\" steam engine and the Skerne Bridge on the Stockton to Darlington Railway.\nStephenson's profile is carved in the facade of Lisbon's Victorian railway station. North-western Milan has the street Via Giorgio Stephenson in his honour. A large statue of Stephenson \u2013 paired with one of James Watt \u2013 adorns the main fa\u00e7ade of Budapest Keleti station.\nIn popular culture.\nStephenson was portrayed by actor Gawn Grainger on television in the 1985 \"Doctor Who\" serial \"The Mark of the Rani\".\nHarry Turtledove's alternate history short story \"The Iron Elephant\" depicts a race between a newly invented steam engine and a mammoth-drawn train in 1782. A station master called George Stephenson features as a minor character alongside an American steam engineer called Richard Trevithick, likely indicating that they were analogous rather than historical characters.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFootnotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The word \"grapheme\" is derived from Ancient Greek's ('write'), and the suffix \"-eme\" (by analogy with \"phoneme\" and other emic units). The study of graphemes is called \"graphemics\". The concept of a grapheme is abstract; it is similar to the notion of a character in computing. (A specific geometric shape that represents any particular grapheme in a given typeface is called a glyph.) In orthographic and linguistic notation, a particular glyph (character) is represented as a grapheme (is used in its graphemic sense) by enclosing it within angle brackets: e.g. \u27e8a\u27e9. \nConceptualization.\nThere are two main opposing grapheme concepts.\nIn the so-called \"referential conception\", graphemes are interpreted as the smallest units of writing that correspond with sounds (more accurately phonemes). In this concept, the \"sh\" in the written English word \"shake\" would be a grapheme because it represents the phoneme /\u0283/. This referential concept is linked to the \"dependency hypothesis\" that claims that writing merely depicts speech.\nBy contrast, the \"analogical concept\" defines graphemes analogously to phonemes, i.e. via written minimal pairs such as \"shake\" vs. \"snake\". In this example, \"h\" and \"n\" are graphemes because they distinguish two words. This analogical concept is associated with the autonomy hypothesis which holds that writing is a system in its own right and should be studied independently from speech. Both concepts have weaknesses.\nSome models adhere to both concepts simultaneously by including two individual units, which are given names such as \"phonological-fit grapheme\" for the grapheme according to the referential concept (\"sh\" in \"shake\"), and \"graphemic grapheme\" for the grapheme according to the analogical conception (\"h\" in \"shake\").\nIn newer concepts, in which the grapheme is interpreted semiotically as a dyadic linguistic sign, it is defined as a minimal unit of writing that is both lexically distinctive and correspondent to a linguistic unit (phoneme, syllable, or morpheme).\nNotation.\nGraphemes are often notated within angle brackets: e.g. \u27e8a\u27e9. This is analogous to the slash notation used for phonemes. Analogous to the square bracket notation used for phones, glyphs are sometimes denoted with vertical lines, e.g. |\u0251|.\nGlyphs.\nIn the same way that the surface forms of phonemes are speech sounds or phones (and different phones representing the same phoneme are called allophones), the surface forms of graphemes are glyphs (sometimes \"graphs\"), namely concrete written representations of symbols (and different glyphs representing the same grapheme are called allographs).\nThus, a grapheme can be regarded as an abstraction of a collection of glyphs that are all functionally equivalent.\nFor example, in written English (or other languages using the Latin alphabet), there are two different physical representations of the lowercase Latin letter \"a\": \"a\" and \"\u0251\". Since, however, the substitution of either of them for the other cannot change the meaning of a word, they are considered to be allographs of the same grapheme, which can be written \u27e8a\u27e9. Similarly, the grapheme corresponding to \"Arabic numeral zero\" has a unique semantic identity and Unicode value but exhibits variation in the form of slashed zero. Italic and bold face forms are also allographic, as is the variation seen in serif (as in Times New Roman) versus sans-serif (as in Helvetica) forms.\nThere is some disagreement as to whether capital and lower case letters are allographs or distinct graphemes. Capitals are generally found in certain triggering contexts that do not change the meaning of a word: a proper name, for example, or at the beginning of a sentence, or all caps in a newspaper headline. In other contexts, capitalization can determine meaning: compare, for example Polish and polish: the former is a language, the latter is for shining shoes.\nSome linguists consider digraphs like the \u27e8sh\u27e9 in \"ship\" to be distinct graphemes, but these are generally analyzed as sequences of graphemes. Non-stylistic ligatures, however, such as \u27e8\u00e6\u27e9, are distinct graphemes, as are various letters with distinctive diacritics, such as \u27e8\u00e7\u27e9.\nIdentical glyphs may not always represent the same grapheme. For example, the three letters \u27e8A\u27e9, \u27e8\u0410\u27e9 and \u27e8\u0391\u27e9 appear identical but each has a different meaning: in order, they are the Latin letter A, the Cyrillic letter Az\u01d4/\u0410\u0437\u044a and the Greek letter Alpha. Each has its own code point in Unicode: , and .\nTypes of grapheme.\nThe principal types of graphemes are logograms (more accurately termed morphograms), which represent words or morphemes (for example Chinese characters, the ampersand \"&amp;\" representing the word \"and\", Arabic numerals); syllabic characters, representing syllables (as in Japanese kana); and alphabetic letters, corresponding roughly to phonemes (see next section). For a full discussion of the different types, see .\nThere are additional graphemic components used in writing, such as punctuation marks, mathematical symbols, word dividers such as the space, and other . Ancient logographic scripts often used silent determinatives to disambiguate the meaning of a neighboring (non-silent) word.\nRelationship with phonemes.\nAs mentioned in the previous section, in languages that use alphabetic writing systems, many of the graphemes stand in principle for the phonemes (significant sounds) of the language. In practice, however, the orthographies of such languages entail at least a certain amount of deviation from the ideal of exact grapheme\u2013phoneme correspondence. A phoneme may be represented by a multigraph (sequence of more than one grapheme), as the digraph \"sh\" represents a single sound in English (and sometimes a single grapheme may represent more than one phoneme, as with the Russian letter \u044f or the Spanish c). Some graphemes may not represent any sound at all (like the \"b\" in English \"debt\" or the \"h\" in all Spanish words containing the said letter), and often the rules of correspondence between graphemes and phonemes become complex or irregular, particularly as a result of historical sound changes that are not necessarily reflected in spelling. \"Shallow\" orthographies such as those of standard Spanish and Finnish have relatively regular (though not always one-to-one) correspondence between graphemes and phonemes, while those of French and English have much less regular correspondence, and are known as deep orthographies.\nMultigraphs representing a single phoneme are normally treated as combinations of separate letters, not as graphemes in their own right. However, in some languages a multigraph may be treated as a single unit for the purposes of collation; for example, in a Czech dictionary, the section for words that start with \u27e8ch\u27e9 comes after that for \u27e8h\u27e9.

{"id": "12581", "revid": "134766", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=12581", "title": "Glass", "text": "Transparent non-crystalline solid material\nGlass is an amorphous (non-crystalline) solid. Because it is often transparent and chemically inert, glass has found widespread practical, technological, and decorative use in window panes, tableware, and optics. Some common objects made of glass are named after the material, e.g., a \"glass\" for drinking, \"glasses\" for vision correction, and a \"magnifying glass\".\nGlass is most often formed by rapid cooling (quenching) of the molten form. Some glasses such as volcanic glass are naturally occurring, and obsidian has been used to make arrowheads and knives since the Stone Age. Archaeological evidence suggests glassmaking dates back to at least 3600 BC in Mesopotamia, Egypt, or Syria. The earliest known glass objects were beads, perhaps created accidentally during metalworking or the production of faience, which is a form of pottery using lead glazes.\nDue to its ease of formability into any shape, glass has been traditionally used for vessels, such as bowls, vases, bottles, jars and drinking glasses. Soda\u2013lime glass, containing around 70% silica, accounts for around 90% of modern manufactured glass. Glass can be coloured by adding metal salts or painted and printed with vitreous enamels, leading to its use in stained glass windows and other glass art objects.\nThe refractive, reflective and transmission properties of glass make glass suitable for manufacturing optical lenses, prisms, and optoelectronics materials. Extruded glass fibres have applications as optical fibres in communications networks, thermal insulating material when matted as glass wool to trap air, or in glass-fibre reinforced plastic (fibreglass).\nMicroscopic structure.\nThe standard definition of a \"glass\" (or vitreous solid) is a non-crystalline solid formed by rapid melt quenching. However, the term \"glass\" is often defined in a broader sense, to describe any non-crystalline (amorphous) solid that exhibits a glass transition when heated towards the liquid state.\nGlass is an amorphous solid. Although the atomic-scale structure of glass shares characteristics of the structure of a supercooled liquid, glass exhibits all the mechanical properties of a solid. As in other amorphous solids, the atomic structure of a glass lacks the long-range periodicity observed in crystalline solids. Due to chemical bonding constraints, glasses do possess a high degree of short-range order with respect to local atomic polyhedra. The notion that glass flows to an appreciable extent over extended periods well below the glass transition temperature is not supported by empirical research or theoretical analysis (see viscosity in solids). Though atomic motion at glass surfaces can be observed, and viscosity on the order of 1017\u20131018\u00a0Pa\u00b7s can be measured in glass, such a high value reinforces the fact that glass would not change shape appreciably over even large periods of time.\nFormation from a supercooled liquid.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Unsolved/styles.css\" /&gt;\nUnsolved problem in physics\nWhat is the nature of the transition between a fluid or regular solid and a glassy phase?\n\"The deepest and most interesting unsolved problem in solid state theory is probably the theory of the nature of glass and the glass transition.\" \u2014P.W. Anderson \nMore unsolved problems in physics\nFor melt quenching, if the cooling is sufficiently rapid (relative to the characteristic crystallization time) then crystallization is prevented and instead, the disordered atomic configuration of the supercooled liquid is frozen into the solid state at Tg. The ability of a material to form glass during rapid cooling is known as its glass-forming ability. This ability can be predicted by the rigidity theory. Generally, a glass exists in a structurally metastable state with respect to its crystalline form, although in certain circumstances, for example in atactic polymers, there is no crystalline analogue of the amorphous phase.\nGlass is sometimes considered to be a liquid due to its lack of a first-order phase transition\nwhere certain thermodynamic variables such as volume, entropy and enthalpy are discontinuous through the glass transition range. The glass transition may be described as analogous to a second-order phase transition where the intensive thermodynamic variables such as the thermal expansivity and heat capacity are discontinuous. However, the equilibrium theory of phase transformations does not hold for glass, and hence the glass transition cannot be classed as one of the classical equilibrium phase transformations in solids.\nOccurrence in nature.\nGlass can form naturally from volcanic magma. Obsidian is a common volcanic glass with high silica (SiO2) content formed when felsic lava extruded from a volcano cools rapidly. Impactite is a form of glass formed by the impact of a meteorite, where Moldavite (found in central and eastern Europe), and Libyan desert glass (found in areas in the eastern Sahara, the deserts of eastern Libya and western Egypt) are notable examples. Vitrification of quartz can also occur when lightning strikes sand, forming hollow, branching rootlike structures called fulgurites. Trinitite is a glassy residue formed from the desert floor sand at the Trinity nuclear bomb test site. Edeowie glass, found in South Australia, is proposed to originate from Pleistocene grassland fires, lightning strikes, or hypervelocity impact by one or several asteroids or comets.\nHistory.\nNaturally occurring obsidian glass was used by Stone Age societies as it fractures along very sharp edges, making it ideal for cutting tools and weapons.\nGlassmaking dates back at least 6000 years, long before humans had discovered how to smelt iron. Archaeological evidence suggests that the first true synthetic glass was made in Lebanon and the coastal north Syria, Mesopotamia or ancient Egypt. The earliest known glass objects, of the mid-third millennium BC, were beads, perhaps initially created as accidental by-products of metalworking (slags) or during the production of faience, a pre-glass vitreous material made by a process similar to glazing.\nEarly glass was rarely transparent and often contained impurities and imperfections, and is technically faience rather than true glass, which did not appear until the 15th century BC. However, red-orange glass beads excavated from the Indus Valley Civilization dated before 1700 BC (possibly as early as 1900 BC) predate sustained glass production, which appeared around 1600 BC in Mesopotamia and 1500 BC in Egypt.\nDuring the Late Bronze Age, there was a rapid growth in glassmaking technology in Egypt and Western Asia. Archaeological finds from this period include coloured glass ingots, vessels, and beads.\nMuch early glass production relied on grinding techniques borrowed from stoneworking, such as grinding and carving glass in a cold state.\nThe term \"glass\" has its origins in the late Roman Empire, in the Roman glass making centre at Trier (located in current-day Germany) where the late-Latin term \"glesum\" originated, likely from a Germanic word for a transparent, lustrous substance. Glass objects have been recovered across the Roman Empire in domestic, funerary, and industrial contexts, as well as trade items in marketplaces in distant provinces. Examples of Roman glass have been found outside of the former Roman Empire in China, the Baltics, the Middle East, and India. The Romans perfected cameo glass, produced by etching and carving through fused layers of different colours to produce a design in relief on the glass object.\nIn post-classical West Africa, Benin was a manufacturer of glass and glass beads.\nGlass was used extensively in Europe during the Middle Ages. Anglo-Saxon glass has been found across England during archaeological excavations of both settlement and cemetery sites. From the 10th century onwards, glass was employed in stained glass windows of churches and cathedrals, with famous examples at Chartres Cathedral and the Basilica of Saint-Denis. By the 14th century, architects were designing buildings with walls of stained glass such as Sainte-Chapelle, Paris, (1203\u20131248) and the East end of Gloucester Cathedral. With the change in architectural style during the Renaissance period in Europe, the use of large stained glass windows became much less prevalent, although stained glass had a major revival with Gothic Revival architecture in the 19th century.\nDuring the 13th century, the island of Murano, Venice, became a centre for glass making, building on medieval techniques to produce colourful ornamental pieces in large quantities. Murano glass makers developed the exceptionally clear colourless glass cristallo, so called for its resemblance to natural crystal, which was extensively used for windows, mirrors, ships' lanterns, and lenses. In the 13th, 14th, and 15th centuries, enamelling and gilding on glass vessels were perfected in Egypt and Syria. Towards the end of the 17th century, Bohemia became an important region for glass production, remaining so until the start of the 20th century. By the 17th century, glass in the Venetian tradition was also being produced in England. In about 1675, George Ravenscroft invented lead crystal glass, with cut glass becoming fashionable in the 18th century. Ornamental glass objects became an important art medium during the Art Nouveau period in the late 19th century.\nThroughout the 20th century, new mass production techniques led to the widespread availability of glass in much larger amounts, making it practical as a building material and enabling new applications of glass. In the 1920s a mould-etch process was developed, in which art was etched directly into the mould so that each cast piece emerged from the mould with the image already on the surface of the glass. This reduced manufacturing costs and, combined with a wider use of coloured glass, led to cheap glassware in the 1930s, which later became known as Depression glass. In the 1950s, Pilkington Bros., England, developed the float glass process, producing high-quality distortion-free flat sheets of glass by floating on molten tin. Modern multi-story buildings are frequently constructed with curtain walls made almost entirely of glass. Laminated glass has been widely applied to vehicles for windscreens. Optical glass for spectacles has been used since the Middle Ages. The production of lenses has become increasingly proficient, aiding astronomers as well as having other applications in medicine and science. Glass is also employed as the aperture cover in many solar energy collectors.\nIn the 21st century, glass manufacturers have developed different brands of chemically strengthened glass for widespread application in touchscreens for smartphones, tablet computers, and many other types of information appliances. These include Gorilla Glass, developed and manufactured by Corning, AGC Inc.'s Dragontrail and Schott AG's Xensation.\nPhysical properties.\nOptical.\nGlass is in widespread use in optical systems due to its ability to refract, reflect, and transmit light following geometrical optics. The most common and oldest applications of glass in optics are as lenses, windows, mirrors, and prisms. The key optical properties refractive index, dispersion, and transmission, of glass are strongly dependent on chemical composition and, to a lesser degree, its thermal history. Optical glass typically has a refractive index of 1.4 to 2.4, and an Abbe number (which characterises dispersion) of 15 to 100. The refractive index may be modified by high-density (refractive index increases) or low-density (refractive index decreases) additives.\nGlass transparency results from the absence of grain boundaries which diffusely scatter light in polycrystalline materials. Semi-opacity due to crystallization may be induced in many glasses by maintaining them for a long period at a temperature just insufficient to cause fusion. In this way, the crystalline, devitrified material, known as R\u00e9aumur's glass porcelain is produced. Although generally transparent to visible light, glasses may be opaque to other wavelengths of light. While silicate glasses are generally opaque to infrared wavelengths with a transmission cut-off at 4 \u03bcm, heavy-metal fluoride and chalcogenide glasses are transparent to infrared wavelengths of 7 to 18 \u03bcm. The addition of metallic oxides results in different coloured glasses as the metallic ions will absorb wavelengths of light corresponding to specific colours.\nOther.\nIn the manufacturing process, glasses can be poured, formed, extruded and moulded into forms ranging from flat sheets to highly intricate shapes. The finished product is brittle but can be laminated or tempered to enhance durability. Glass is typically inert, resistant to chemical attack, and can mostly withstand the action of water, making it an ideal material for the manufacture of containers for foodstuffs and most chemicals. Nevertheless, although usually highly resistant to chemical attack, glass will corrode or dissolve under some conditions. The materials that make up a particular glass composition affect how quickly the glass corrodes. Glasses containing a high proportion of alkali or alkaline earth elements are more susceptible to corrosion than other glass compositions.\nThe density of glass varies with chemical composition with values ranging from for fused silica to for dense flint glass. Glass is stronger than most metals, with a theoretical tensile strength for pure, flawless glass estimated at due to its ability to undergo reversible compression without fracture. However, the presence of scratches, bubbles, and other microscopic flaws lead to a typical range of in most commercial glasses. Several processes such as toughening can increase the strength of glass. Carefully drawn flawless glass fibres can be produced with a strength of up to .\nReputed flow.\nThe observation that old windows are sometimes found to be thicker at the bottom than at the top is often offered as supporting evidence for the view that glass flows over a timescale of centuries, the assumption being that the glass has exhibited the liquid property of flowing from one shape to another. This assumption is incorrect, as once solidified, glass stops flowing. The sags and ripples observed in old glass were already there the day it was made; manufacturing processes used in the past produced sheets with imperfect surfaces and non-uniform thickness (the near-perfect float glass used today only became widespread in the 1960s).\nA 2017 study computed the rate of flow of the medieval glass used in Westminster Abbey from the year 1268. The study found that the room temperature viscosity of this glass was roughly 1024Pa\u00b7s which is about 1016 times less viscous than a previous estimate made in 1998, which focused on soda-lime silicate glass. Even with this lower viscosity, the study authors calculated that the maximum flow rate of medieval glass is 1 nm per billion years, making it impossible to observe in a human timescale.\nTypes.\nSilicate glasses.\nSilicon dioxide (SiO2) is a common fundamental constituent of glass. Fused quartz is a glass made from chemically pure silica. It has very low thermal expansion and excellent resistance to thermal shock, being able to survive immersion in water while red hot, resists high temperatures (1000\u20131500\u00a0\u00b0C) and chemical weathering, and is very hard. It is also transparent to a wider spectral range than ordinary glass, extending from the visible further into both the UV and IR ranges, and is sometimes used where transparency to these wavelengths is necessary. Fused quartz is used for high-temperature applications such as furnace tubes, lighting tubes, melting crucibles, etc. However, its high melting temperature (1723\u00a0\u00b0C) and viscosity make it difficult to work with. Therefore, normally, other substances (fluxes) are added to lower the melting temperature and simplify glass processing.\nSoda\u2013lime glass.\nSodium carbonate (Na2CO3, \"soda\") is a common additive and acts to lower the glass-transition temperature. However, sodium silicate is water-soluble, so lime (CaO, calcium oxide, generally obtained from limestone), along with magnesium oxide (MgO), and aluminium oxide (Al2O3), are commonly added to improve chemical durability. Soda\u2013lime glasses (Na2O) + lime (CaO) + magnesia (MgO) + alumina (Al2O3) account for over 75% of manufactured glass, containing about 70 to 74% silica by weight. Soda\u2013lime\u2013silicate glass is transparent, easily formed, and most suitable for window glass and tableware. However, it has a high thermal expansion and poor resistance to heat. Soda\u2013lime glass is typically used for windows, bottles, light bulbs, and jars.\nBorosilicate glass.\nBorosilicate glasses (e.g. Pyrex, Duran) typically contain 5\u201313% boron trioxide (B2O3). Borosilicate glasses have fairly low coefficients of thermal expansion (7740 Pyrex CTE is 3.25\u00d710-6/\u00b0C as compared to about 9\u00d710-6/\u00b0C for a typical soda\u2013lime glass). They are, therefore, less subject to stress caused by thermal expansion and thus less vulnerable to cracking from thermal shock. They are commonly used for e.g. labware, household cookware, and sealed beam car head lamps.\nLead glass.\nThe addition of lead(II) oxide into silicate glass lowers the melting point and viscosity of the melt. The high density of lead glass (silica + lead oxide (PbO) + potassium oxide (K2O) + soda (Na2O) + zinc oxide (ZnO) + alumina) results in a high electron density, and hence high refractive index, making the look of glassware more brilliant and causing noticeably more specular reflection and increased optical dispersion. Lead glass has a high elasticity, making the glassware more workable and giving rise to a clear \"ring\" sound when struck. However, lead glass cannot withstand high temperatures well. Lead oxide also facilitates the solubility of other metal oxides and is used in coloured glass. The viscosity decrease of lead glass melt is very significant (roughly 100 times in comparison with soda glass); this allows easier removal of bubbles and working at lower temperatures, hence its frequent use as an additive in vitreous enamels and glass solders. The high ionic radius of the Pb2+ ion renders it highly immobile and hinders the movement of other ions; lead glasses therefore have high electrical resistance, about two orders of magnitude higher than soda\u2013lime glass (108.5 vs 106.5\u00a0\u03a9\u22c5cm, DC at 250\u00a0\u00b0C).\nAluminosilicate glass.\nAluminosilicate glass typically contains 5\u201310% alumina (Al2O3). Aluminosilicate glass tends to be more difficult to melt and shape compared to borosilicate compositions but has excellent thermal resistance and durability. Aluminosilicate glass is extensively used for fibreglass, used for making glass-reinforced plastics (boats, fishing rods, etc.), top-of-stove cookware, and halogen bulb glass.\nOther oxide additives.\nThe addition of barium also increases the refractive index. Thorium oxide gives glass a high refractive index and low dispersion and was formerly used in producing high-quality lenses, but due to its radioactivity has been replaced by lanthanum oxide in modern eyeglasses. Iron can be incorporated into glass to absorb infrared radiation, for example in heat-absorbing filters for movie projectors, while cerium(IV) oxide can be used for glass that absorbs ultraviolet wavelengths. Fluorine lowers the dielectric constant of glass. Fluorine is highly electronegative and lowers the polarizability of the material. Fluoride silicate glasses are used in the manufacture of integrated circuits as an insulator.\nGlass-ceramics.\nGlass-ceramic materials contain both non-crystalline glass and crystalline ceramic phases. They are formed by controlled nucleation and partial crystallisation of a base glass by heat treatment. Crystalline grains are often embedded within a non-crystalline intergranular phase of grain boundaries. Glass-ceramics exhibit advantageous thermal, chemical, biological, and dielectric properties as compared to metals or organic polymers.\nThe most commercially important property of glass-ceramics is their imperviousness to thermal shock. Thus, glass-ceramics have become extremely useful for countertop cooking and industrial processes. The negative thermal expansion coefficient (CTE) of the crystalline ceramic phase can be balanced with the positive CTE of the glassy phase. At a certain point (~70% crystalline) the glass-ceramic has a net CTE near zero. This type of glass-ceramic exhibits excellent mechanical properties and can sustain repeated and quick temperature changes up to 1000\u00a0\u00b0C.\nFibreglass.\nFibreglass (also called glass fibre reinforced plastic, GRP) is a composite material made by reinforcing a plastic resin with glass fibres. It is made by melting glass and stretching the glass into fibres. These fibres are woven together into a cloth and left to set in a plastic resin.\nFibreglass has the properties of being lightweight and corrosion resistant and is a good insulator enabling its use as building insulation material and for electronic housing for consumer products. Fibreglass was originally used in the United Kingdom and United States during World War II to manufacture radomes. Uses of fibreglass include building and construction materials, boat hulls, car body parts, and aerospace composite materials.\nGlass-fibre wool is an excellent thermal and sound insulation material, commonly used in buildings (e.g. attic and cavity wall insulation), and plumbing (e.g. pipe insulation), and soundproofing. It is produced by forcing molten glass through a fine mesh by centripetal force and breaking the extruded glass fibres into short lengths using a stream of high-velocity air. The fibres are bonded with an adhesive spray and the resulting wool mat is cut and packed in rolls or panels.\nNon-silicate glasses.\nBesides common silica-based glasses many other inorganic and organic materials may also form glasses, including metals, aluminates, phosphates, borates, chalcogenides, fluorides, germanates (glasses based on GeO2), tellurites (glasses based on TeO2), antimonates (glasses based on Sb2O3), arsenates (glasses based on As2O3), titanates (glasses based on TiO2), tantalates (glasses based on Ta2O5), nitrates, carbonates, plastics, acrylic, and many other substances. Some of these glasses (e.g. Germanium dioxide (GeO2, Germania), in many respects a structural analogue of silica, fluoride, aluminate, phosphate, borate, and chalcogenide glasses) have physicochemical properties useful for their application in fibre-optic waveguides in communication networks and other specialised technological applications.\nSilica-free glasses may often have poor glass-forming tendencies. Novel techniques, including containerless processing by aerodynamic levitation (cooling the melt whilst it floats on a gas stream) or splat quenching (pressing the melt between two metal anvils or rollers), may be used to increase the cooling rate or to reduce crystal nucleation triggers.\nAmorphous metals.\nIn the past, small batches of amorphous metals with high surface area configurations (ribbons, wires, films, etc.) have been produced through the implementation of extremely rapid rates of cooling. Amorphous metal wires have been produced by sputtering molten metal onto a spinning metal disk.\nSeveral alloys have been produced in layers with thicknesses exceeding 1 millimetre. These are known as bulk metallic glasses (BMG). Liquidmetal Technologies sells several zirconium-based BMGs.\nBatches of amorphous steel have also been produced that demonstrate mechanical properties far exceeding those found in conventional steel alloys.\nExperimental evidence indicates that the system Al-Fe-Si may undergo a \"first-order transition\" to an amorphous form (dubbed \"q-glass\") on rapid cooling from the melt. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images indicate that q-glass nucleates from the melt as discrete particles with uniform spherical growth in all directions. While x-ray diffraction reveals the isotropic nature of q-glass, a nucleation barrier exists implying an interfacial discontinuity (or internal surface) between the glass and melt phases.\nPolymers.\nImportant polymer glasses include amorphous and glassy pharmaceutical compounds. These are useful because the solubility of the compound is greatly increased when it is amorphous compared to the same crystalline composition. Many emerging pharmaceuticals are practically insoluble in their crystalline forms. Many polymer thermoplastics familiar to everyday use are glasses. For many applications, like glass bottles or eyewear, polymer glasses (acrylic glass, polycarbonate or polyethylene terephthalate) are a lighter alternative to traditional glass.\nMolecular liquids and molten salts.\nMolecular liquids, electrolytes, molten salts, and aqueous solutions are mixtures of different molecules or ions that do not form a covalent network but interact only through weak van der Waals forces or transient hydrogen bonds. In a mixture of three or more ionic species of dissimilar size and shape, crystallization can be so difficult that the liquid can easily be supercooled into a glass. Examples include LiCl:\"R\"H2O (a solution of lithium chloride salt and water molecules) in the composition range 4&lt;\"R\"&lt;8. sugar glass, or Ca0.4K0.6(NO3)1.4. Glass electrolytes in the form of Ba-doped Li-glass and Ba-doped Na-glass have been proposed as solutions to problems identified with organic liquid electrolytes used in modern lithium-ion battery cells.\nProduction.\nFollowing the glass batch preparation and mixing, the raw materials are transported to the furnace. Soda\u2013lime glass for mass production is melted in glass-melting furnaces. Smaller-scale furnaces for speciality glasses include electric melters, pot furnaces, and day tanks.\nAfter melting, homogenization and refining (removal of bubbles), the glass is . This may be achieved manually by glassblowing, which involves gathering a mass of hot semi-molten glass, inflating it into a bubble using a hollow blowpipe, and forming it into the required shape by blowing, swinging, rolling, or moulding. While hot, the glass can be worked using hand tools, cut with shears, and additional parts such as handles or feet attached by welding.\nFlat glass for windows and similar applications is formed by the float glass process, developed between 1953 and 1957 by Sir Alastair Pilkington and Kenneth Bickerstaff of the UK's Pilkington Brothers, who created a continuous ribbon of glass using a molten tin bath on which the molten glass flows unhindered under the influence of gravity. The top surface of the glass is subjected to nitrogen under pressure to obtain a polished finish. Container glass for common bottles and jars is formed by blowing and pressing methods. This glass is often slightly modified chemically (with more alumina and calcium oxide) for greater water resistance.\nOnce the desired form is obtained, glass is usually annealed for the removal of stresses and to increase the glass's hardness and durability. Surface treatments, coatings or lamination may follow to improve the chemical durability (glass container coatings, glass container internal treatment), strength (toughened glass, bulletproof glass, windshields), or optical properties (insulated glazing, anti-reflective coating).\nNew chemical glass compositions or new treatment techniques can be initially investigated in small-scale laboratory experiments. The raw materials for laboratory-scale glass melts are often different from those used in mass production because the cost factor has a low priority. In the laboratory mostly pure chemicals are used. Care must be taken that the raw materials have not reacted with moisture or other chemicals in the environment (such as alkali or alkaline earth metal oxides and hydroxides, or boron oxide), or that the impurities are quantified (loss on ignition). Evaporation losses during glass melting should be considered during the selection of the raw materials, e.g., sodium selenite may be preferred over easily evaporating selenium dioxide (SeO2). Also, more readily reacting raw materials may be preferred over relatively inert ones, such as aluminium hydroxide (Al(OH)3) over alumina (Al2O3). Usually, the melts are carried out in platinum crucibles to reduce contamination from the crucible material. Glass homogeneity is achieved by homogenizing the raw materials mixture (glass batch), stirring the melt, and crushing and re-melting the first melt. The obtained glass is usually annealed to prevent breakage during processing.\nColour.\nColour in glass may be obtained by addition of homogenously distributed electrically charged ions (or colour centres). While ordinary soda\u2013lime glass appears colourless in thin section, iron(II) oxide (FeO) impurities produce a green tint in thick sections. Manganese dioxide (MnO2), which gives glass a purple colour, may be added to remove the green tint given by FeO. FeO and chromium(III) oxide (Cr2O3) additives are used in the production of green bottles. Iron (III) oxide, on the other-hand, produces yellow or yellow-brown glass. Low concentrations (0.025 to 0.1%) of cobalt oxide (CoO) produce rich, deep blue cobalt glass. Chromium is a very powerful colouring agent, yielding dark green.\nSulphur combined with carbon and iron salts produces amber glass ranging from yellowish to almost black. A glass melt can also acquire an amber colour from a reducing combustion atmosphere. Cadmium sulfide produces imperial red, and combined with selenium can produce shades of yellow, orange, and red. Addition of copper(II) oxide (CuO) produces a turquoise colour in glass, in contrast to copper(I) oxide (Cu2O) which gives a dull red-brown colour.\nUses.\nArchitecture and windows.\nSoda\u2013lime sheet glass is typically used as a transparent glazing material, typically as windows in external walls of buildings. Float or rolled sheet glass products are cut to size either by scoring and snapping the material, laser cutting, water jets, or diamond-bladed saw. The glass may be thermally or chemically tempered (strengthened) for safety and bent or curved during heating. Surface coatings may be added for specific functions such as scratch resistance, blocking specific wavelengths of light (e.g. infrared or ultraviolet), dirt-repellence (e.g. self-cleaning glass), or switchable electrochromic coatings.\nStructural glazing systems represent one of the most significant architectural innovations of modern times, where glass buildings now often dominate the skylines of many modern cities. These systems use stainless steel fittings countersunk into recesses in the corners of the glass panels allowing strengthened panes to appear unsupported creating a flush exterior. Structural glazing systems have their roots in iron and glass conservatories of the nineteenth century\nTableware.\nGlass is an essential component of tableware and is typically used for water, beer and wine drinking glasses. Wine glasses are typically stemware, i.e. goblets formed from a bowl, stem, and foot. Lead crystal glass may be cut and polished to produce decorative drinking glasses with gleaming facets. Other uses of glass in tableware include decanters, jugs, plates, and bowls.\nPackaging.\nThe inert and impermeable nature of glass makes it a stable and widely used material for food and drink packaging as glass bottles and jars. Most container glass is soda\u2013lime glass, produced by blowing and pressing techniques. Container glass has a lower magnesium oxide and sodium oxide content than flat glass, and a higher silica, calcium oxide, and aluminium oxide content. Its higher content of water-insoluble oxides imparts slightly higher chemical durability against water, which is advantageous for storing beverages and food. Glass packaging is sustainable, readily recycled, reusable and refillable.\nFor electronics applications, glass can be used as a substrate in the manufacture of integrated passive devices, thin-film bulk acoustic resonators, and as a hermetic sealing material in device packaging, including very thin solely glass based encapsulation of integrated circuits and other semiconductors in high manufacturing volumes.\nLaboratories.\nGlass is an important material in scientific laboratories for the manufacture of experimental apparatus because it is relatively cheap, readily formed into required shapes for experiment, easy to keep clean, can withstand heat and cold treatment, is generally non-reactive with many reagents, and its transparency allows for the observation of chemical reactions and processes. Laboratory glassware applications include flasks, Petri dishes, test tubes, pipettes, graduated cylinders, glass-lined metallic containers for chemical processing, fractionation columns, glass pipes, Schlenk lines, gauges, and thermometers. Although most standard laboratory glassware has been mass-produced since the 1920s, scientists still employ skilled glassblowers to manufacture bespoke glass apparatus for their experimental requirements.\nOptics.\nGlass is a ubiquitous material in optics because of its ability to refract, reflect, and transmit light. These and other optical properties can be controlled by varying chemical compositions, thermal treatment, and manufacturing techniques. The many applications of glass in optics include glasses for eyesight correction, imaging optics (e.g. lenses and mirrors in telescopes, microscopes, and cameras), fibre optics in telecommunications technology, and integrated optics. Microlenses and gradient-index optics (where the refractive index is non-uniform) find application in e.g. reading optical discs, laser printers, photocopiers, and laser diodes.\nModern glass art.\nThe 19th century saw a revival in ancient glassmaking techniques including cameo glass, achieved for the first time since the Roman Empire, initially mostly for pieces in a neo-classical style. The Art Nouveau movement made great use of glass, with Ren\u00e9 Lalique, \u00c9mile Gall\u00e9, and Daum of Nancy in the first French wave of the movement, producing coloured vases and similar pieces, often in cameo glass or lustre glass techniques.\nLouis Comfort Tiffany in America specialised in stained glass, both secular and religious, in panels and his famous lamps. The early 20th century saw the large-scale factory production of glass art by firms such as Waterford and Lalique. Small studios may hand-produce glass artworks. Techniques for producing glass art include blowing, kiln-casting, fusing, slumping, p\u00e2te de verre, flame-working, hot-sculpting and cold-working. Cold work includes traditional stained glass work and other methods of shaping glass at room temperature. Objects made out of glass include vessels, paperweights, marbles, beads, sculptures and installation art.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "12582", "revid": "38912470", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=12582", "title": "Gel electrophoresis", "text": "Method for separation and analysis of biomolecules\nGel electrophoresis is an electrophoresis method for separation and analysis of biomacromolecules (DNA, RNA, proteins, etc.) and their fragments, based on their size and charge through a gel. It is used in clinical chemistry to separate proteins by charge or size (IEF agarose, essentially size independent) and in biochemistry and molecular biology to separate a mixed population of DNA and RNA fragments by length, to estimate the size of DNA and RNA fragments, or to separate proteins by charge.\nNucleic acid molecules are separated by applying an electric field to move the negatively charged molecules through a gel matrix of agarose, polyacrylamide, or other substances. Shorter molecules move faster and migrate farther than longer ones because shorter molecules migrate more easily through the pores of the gel. This phenomenon is called sieving. Proteins are separated by the charge in agarose because the pores of the gel are too large to sieve proteins. Gel electrophoresis can also be used for the separation of nanoparticles.\nGel electrophoresis uses a gel as an anticonvective medium or sieving medium during electrophoresis. Gels suppress the thermal convection caused by the application of the electric field and can also serve to maintain the finished separation so that a post-electrophoresis stain can be applied. DNA gel electrophoresis is usually performed for analytical purposes, often after amplification of DNA via polymerase chain reaction (PCR), but may be used as a preparative technique for other methods such as mass spectrometry, RFLP, PCR, cloning, DNA sequencing, or Southern blotting for further characterization.\nPhysical basis.\nElectrophoresis is a process that enables the sorting of molecules based on charge, size, or shape. Using an electric field, molecules such as DNA can be made to move through a gel made of agarose or polyacrylamide. The electric field consists of a negative charge at one end which pushes the molecules through the gel and a positive charge at the other end that pulls the molecules through the gel. The molecules being sorted are dispensed into a well in the gel material. The gel is placed in an electrophoresis chamber, which is then connected to a power source. When the electric field is applied, the larger molecules move more slowly through the gel while the smaller molecules move faster. The different sized molecules form distinct bands on the gel.\nThe term \"gel\" in this instance refers to the matrix used to contain, then separate the target molecules. In most cases, the gel is a crosslinked polymer whose composition and porosity are chosen based on the specific weight and composition of the target to be analyzed. When separating proteins or small nucleic acids (DNA, RNA, or oligonucleotides), the gel is usually composed of different concentrations of acrylamide and a cross-linker, producing different sized mesh networks of polyacrylamide. When separating larger nucleic acids (greater than a few hundred bases), the preferred matrix is purified agarose. In both cases, the gel forms a solid yet porous matrix. Acrylamide, in contrast to polyacrylamide, is a neurotoxin and must be handled using appropriate safety precautions to avoid poisoning. Agarose is composed of long unbranched chains of uncharged carbohydrates without cross-links, resulting in a gel with large pores allowing for the separation of macromolecules and macromolecular complexes.\nElectrophoresis refers to the electromotive force (EMF) that is used to move the molecules through the gel matrix. By placing the molecules in wells in the gel and applying an electric field, the molecules will move through the matrix at different rates, determined largely by their mass when the charge-to-mass ratio (Z) of all species is uniform. However, when charges are not uniform, the electrical field generated by the electrophoresis procedure will cause the molecules to migrate differentially according to charge. Species that are net positively charged will migrate towards the cathode (which is negatively charged because this is an electrolytic rather than galvanic cell), whereas species that are net negatively charged will migrate towards the positively charged anode. Mass remains a factor in the speed with which these non-uniformly charged molecules migrate through the matrix toward their respective electrodes.\nIf several samples have been loaded into adjacent wells in the gel, they will run parallel in individual lanes. Depending on the number of different molecules, each lane shows the separation of the components from the original mixture as one or more distinct bands, one band per component. Incomplete separation of the components can lead to overlapping bands, or indistinguishable smears representing multiple unresolved components. Bands in different lanes that end up at the same distance from the top contain molecules that passed through the gel at the same speed, which usually means they are approximately the same size. There are molecular weight size markers available that contain a mixture of molecules of known sizes. If such a marker was run on one lane in the gel parallel to the unknown samples, the bands observed can be compared to those of the unknown to determine their size. The distance a band travels is approximately inversely proportional to the logarithm of the size of the molecule. (Equivalently, the distance traveled is inversely proportional to the log of the samples's molecular weight).\nThere are limits to electrophoretic techniques. Since passing a current through a gel causes heating, gels may melt during electrophoresis. Electrophoresis is performed in buffer solutions to reduce pH changes due to the electric field, which is important because the charge of DNA and RNA depends on pH, but running for too long can exhaust the buffering capacity of the solution. There are also limitations in determining the molecular weight by SDS-PAGE, especially when trying to find the MW of an unknown protein. Certain biological variables are difficult or impossible to minimize and can affect electrophoretic migration. Such factors include protein structure, post-translational modifications, and amino acid composition. For example, tropomyosin is an acidic protein that migrates abnormally on SDS-PAGE gels. This is because the acidic residues are repelled by the negatively charged SDS, leading to an inaccurate mass-to-charge ratio and migration. Further, different preparations of genetic material may not migrate consistently with each other, for morphological or other reasons.\nTypes of gel.\nThe types of gel most typically used are agarose and polyacrylamide gels. Each type of gel is well-suited to different types and sizes of the analyte. Polyacrylamide gels are usually used for proteins and have very high resolving power for small fragments of DNA (5-500 bp). Agarose gels, on the other hand, have lower resolving power for DNA but a greater range of separation, and are therefore usually used for DNA fragments of 50\u201320,000 bp in size. (The resolution of over 6 Mb is possible with pulsed field gel electrophoresis (PFGE).) Polyacrylamide gels are run in a vertical configuration while agarose gels are typically run horizontally in a submarine mode. They also differ in their casting methodology, as agarose sets thermally, while polyacrylamide forms in a chemical polymerization reaction.\nAgarose.\nAgarose gels are made from the natural polysaccharide polymers extracted from seaweed.\nAgarose gels are easily cast and handled compared to other matrices because the gel setting is a physical rather than chemical change. Samples are also easily recovered. After the experiment is finished, the resulting gel can be stored in a plastic bag in a refrigerator.\nAgarose gels do not have a uniform pore size, but are optimal for electrophoresis of proteins that are larger than 200 kDa. Agarose gel electrophoresis can also be used for the separation of DNA fragments ranging from 50 base pair to several megabases (millions of bases), the largest of which require specialized apparatus. The distance between DNA bands of different lengths is influenced by the percent agarose in the gel, with higher percentages requiring longer run times, sometimes days. Instead high percentage agarose gels should be run with a pulsed field electrophoresis (PFE), or field inversion electrophoresis.\n\"Most agarose gels are made with between 0.7% (good separation or resolution of large 5\u201310kb DNA fragments) and 2% (good resolution for small 0.2\u20131kb fragments) agarose dissolved in electrophoresis buffer. Up to 3% can be used for separating very tiny fragments but a vertical polyacrylamide gel is more appropriate in this case. Low percentage gels are very weak and may break when you try to lift them. High percentage gels are often brittle and do not set evenly. 1% gels are common for many applications.\"\nPolyacrylamide.\nPolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) is used for separating proteins ranging in size from 5 to 2,000 kDa due to the uniform pore size provided by the polyacrylamide gel. Pore size is controlled by modulating the concentrations of acrylamide and bis-acrylamide powder and by the polymerization time used in creating a gel. Care must be used when creating this type of gel, as acrylamide is a potent neurotoxin in its liquid and powdered forms.\nTraditional DNA sequencing techniques such as Maxam-Gilbert or Sanger methods used polyacrylamide gels to separate DNA fragments differing by a single base-pair in length so the sequence could be read. Most modern DNA separation methods now use agarose gels, except for particularly small DNA fragments. It is currently most often used in the field of immunology and protein analysis, often used to separate different proteins or isoforms of the same protein into separate bands. These can be transferred onto a nitrocellulose or PVDF membrane to be probed with antibodies and corresponding markers, such as in a western blot.\nTypically resolving gels are made in 4%, 6%, 8%, 10%, 12% or 15% T. Stacking gel (5% T) is poured on top of the resolving gel and a gel comb (which forms the wells and defines the lanes where proteins, sample buffer, and ladders will be placed) is inserted. The percentage chosen depends on the size of the protein that one wishes to identify or probe in the sample. The smaller the known weight, the higher the percentage that should be used. Changes in the buffer system of the gel can help to further resolve proteins of very small sizes.\nStarch.\nPartially hydrolysed potato starch makes for another non-toxic medium for protein electrophoresis. The gels are slightly more opaque than acrylamide or agarose. Non-denatured proteins can be separated according to charge and size. They are visualised using Napthal Black or Amido Black staining. Typical starch gel concentrations are 5% to 10%.\nGel conditions.\nDenaturing.\nDenaturing gels are run under conditions that disrupt the natural structure of the analyte, causing it to unfold into a linear chain. Thus, the mobility of each macromolecule depends only on its linear length and its mass-to-charge ratio. Thus, the secondary, tertiary, and quaternary levels of biomolecular structure are disrupted, leaving only the primary structure to be analyzed.\nNucleic acids are often denatured by including urea in the buffer, while proteins are denatured using sodium dodecyl sulfate, usually as part of the SDS-PAGE process. For full denaturation of proteins, it is also necessary to reduce the covalent disulfide bonds that stabilize their tertiary and quaternary structure, a method called reducing PAGE. Reducing conditions are usually maintained by the addition of beta-mercaptoethanol or dithiothreitol. For a general analysis of protein samples, reducing PAGE is the most common form of protein electrophoresis.\nDenaturing conditions are necessary for proper estimation of molecular weight of RNA. RNA is able to form more intramolecular interactions than DNA which may result in change of its electrophoretic mobility. Urea, DMSO and glyoxal are the most often used denaturing agents to disrupt RNA structure. Originally, highly toxic methylmercury hydroxide was often used in denaturing RNA electrophoresis, but it may be method of choice for some samples.\nDenaturing gel electrophoresis is used in the DNA and RNA banding pattern-based methods temperature gradient gel electrophoresis (TGGE) and denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE).\nNative.\nNative gels are run in non-denaturing conditions so that the analyte's natural structure is maintained. This allows the physical size of the folded or assembled complex to affect the mobility, allowing for analysis of all four levels of the biomolecular structure. For biological samples, detergents are used only to the extent that they are necessary to lyse lipid membranes in the cell. Complexes remain \u2014for the most part\u2014 associated and folded as they would be in the cell. One downside, however, is that complexes may not separate cleanly or predictably, as it is difficult to predict how the molecule's shape and size will affect its mobility. These effects have been successfully addressed by preparative native PAGE.\nUnlike denaturing methods, native gel electrophoresis does not use a charged denaturing agent. The molecules being separated (usually proteins, peptides, or nucleic acids), therefore differ not only in molecular mass and intrinsic charge, but also the cross-sectional area, and thus, experience different electrophoretic forces dependent on the shape of the overall structure. For proteins, since they remain in the native state, they may be visualized not only by general protein staining reagents but also by specific enzyme-linked staining.\nA specific experiment example of an application of native gel electrophoresis is to check for enzymatic activity to verify the presence of the enzyme in the sample during protein purification. For example, for the protein alkaline phosphatase, the staining solution is a mixture of 4-chloro-2-2 methylbenzenediazonium salt with 3-phospho-2-naphthoic acid-2'-4'-dimethyl aniline in Tris buffer. This stain is commercially sold as a kit for staining gels. If the protein is present, the mechanism of the reaction takes place in the following order: it starts with the de-phosphorylation of 3-phospho-2-naphthoic acid-2'-4'-dimethyl aniline by alkaline phosphatase (water is needed for the reaction). The phosphate group is released and replaced by an alcohol group from water. The electrophile 4- chloro-2-2 methylbenzenediazonium (\"Fast Red TR Diazonium\" salt) displaces the alcohol group forming the final product \"Red Azo\" dye. As its name implies, this is the final visible-red product of the reaction. In undergraduate academic experimentation of protein purification, the gel is usually run next to commercial purified samples to visualize the results and conclude whether or not purification was successful.\nNative gel electrophoresis is typically used in proteomics and metallomics. However, native PAGE is also used to scan genes (DNA) for unknown mutations as in single-strand conformation polymorphism.\nBuffers.\nBuffers in gel electrophoresis are used to provide ions that carry a current and to maintain the pH at a relatively constant value.\nThese buffers have plenty of ions in them, which is necessary for the passage of electricity through them. Something like distilled water or benzene contains few ions, which is not ideal for the use in electrophoresis. There are a number of buffers used for electrophoresis. The most common being, for nucleic acids Tris/Acetate/EDTA (TAE), Tris/Borate/EDTA (TBE). Many other buffers have been proposed, e.g. lithium borate (LB), (which is rarely used based on Pubmed citations), isoelectric histidine, pK matched Good's buffers, etc.; in most cases the purported rationale is lower current (less heat) matched ion mobilities, which leads to longer buffer life. Borate is problematic as borate can polymerize or interact with cis diols such as those found in RNA. TAE has the lowest buffering capacity, but provides the best resolution for larger DNA. This means a lower voltage and more time, but a better product. LB is relatively new and is ineffective in resolving fragments larger than 5 kbp; However, with its low conductivity, a much higher voltage could be used (up to 35 V/cm), which means a shorter analysis time for routine electrophoresis. As low as one base pair size difference could be resolved in 3% agarose gel with an extremely low conductivity medium (1 mM Lithium borate).\nMost SDS-PAGE protein separations are performed using a \"discontinuous\" (or DISC) buffer system that significantly enhances the sharpness of the bands within the gel. During electrophoresis in a discontinuous gel system, an ion gradient is formed in the early stage of electrophoresis that causes all of the proteins to focus on a single sharp band in a process called isotachophoresis. Separation of the proteins by size is achieved in the lower, \"resolving\" region of the gel. The resolving gel typically has a much smaller pore size, which leads to a sieving effect that now determines the electrophoretic mobility of the proteins.\nVisualization.\nAfter the electrophoresis is complete, the molecules in the gel can be stained to make them visible. DNA may be visualized using ethidium bromide which, when intercalated into DNA, fluoresce under ultraviolet light, while protein may be visualised using silver stain or Coomassie brilliant blue dye. Other methods may also be used to visualize the separation of the mixture's components on the gel. If the molecules to be separated contain radioactivity, for example in a DNA sequencing gel, an autoradiogram can be recorded of the gel. Photographs can be taken of gels, often using a gel doc system. Gels are then commonly labelled for presentation and scientific records on the popular figure-creation website, https://.\nDownstream processing.\nAfter separation, an additional separation method may then be used, such as isoelectric focusing or SDS-PAGE. The gel will then be physically cut, and the protein complexes extracted from each portion separately. Each extract may then be analysed, such as by peptide mass fingerprinting or de novo peptide sequencing after in-gel digestion. This can provide a great deal of information about the identities of the proteins in a complex.\nApplications.\nGel electrophoresis is used in forensics, molecular biology, genetics, microbiology and biochemistry. The results can be analyzed quantitatively by visualizing the gel with UV light and a gel imaging device. The image is recorded with a computer-operated camera, and the intensity of the band or spot of interest is measured and compared against standard or markers loaded on the same gel. The measurement and analysis are mostly done with specialized software.\nDepending on the type of analysis being performed, other techniques are often implemented in conjunction with the results of gel electrophoresis, providing a wide range of field-specific applications.\nNucleic acids.\nIn the case of nucleic acids, the direction of migration, from negative to positive electrodes, is due to the naturally occurring negative charge carried by their sugar-phosphate backbone.\nDouble-stranded DNA fragments naturally behave as long rods, so their migration through the gel is relative to their size or, for cyclic fragments, their radius of gyration. Circular DNA such as plasmids, however, may show multiple bands, the speed of migration may depend on whether it is relaxed or supercoiled. Single-stranded DNA or RNA tends to fold up into molecules with complex shapes and migrate through the gel in a complicated manner based on their tertiary structure. Therefore, agents that disrupt the hydrogen bonds, such as sodium hydroxide or formamide, are used to denature the nucleic acids and cause them to behave as long rods again.\nGel electrophoresis of large DNA or RNA is usually done by agarose gel electrophoresis. See the \"chain termination method\" page for an example of a polyacrylamide DNA sequencing gel. Characterization through ligand interaction of nucleic acids or fragments may be performed by mobility shift affinity electrophoresis.\nElectrophoresis of RNA samples can be used to check for genomic DNA contamination and also for RNA degradation. RNA from eukaryotic organisms shows distinct bands of 28s and 18s rRNA, the 28s band being approximately twice as intense as the 18s band. Degraded RNA has less sharply defined bands, has a smeared appearance, and the intensity ratio is less than 2:1.\nProteins.\nProteins, unlike nucleic acids, can have varying charges and complex shapes, therefore they may not migrate into the polyacrylamide gel at similar rates, or all when placing a negative to positive EMF on the sample. Proteins, therefore, are usually denatured in the presence of a detergent such as sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) that coats the proteins with a negative charge. Generally, the amount of SDS bound is relative to the size of the protein (usually 1.4g SDS per gram of protein), so that the resulting denatured proteins have an overall negative charge, and all the proteins have a similar charge-to-mass ratio. Since denatured proteins act like long rods instead of having a complex tertiary shape, the rate at which the resulting SDS coated proteins migrate in the gel is relative only to their size and not their charge or shape.\nProteins are usually analyzed by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), by blue native or clear native PAGE, by preparative native gel electrophoresis (QPNC-PAGE), or by 2-D electrophoresis.\nCharacterization through ligand interaction may be performed by electroblotting or by affinity electrophoresis in agarose or by capillary electrophoresis as for estimation of binding constants and determination of structural features like glycan content through lectin binding.\nNanoparticles.\nA novel application for gel electrophoresis is the separation or characterization of metal or metal oxide nanoparticles (e.g. Au, Ag, ZnO, SiO2) regarding the size, shape, or surface chemistry of the nanoparticles. The scope is to obtain a more homogeneous sample (e.g. narrower particle size distribution), which then can be used in further products/processes (e.g. self-assembly processes). For the separation of nanoparticles within a gel, the key parameter is the ratio of the particle size to the mesh size, whereby two migration mechanisms were identified: the unrestricted mechanism, where the particle size \u00ab mesh size, and the restricted mechanism, where particle size is similar to mesh size.\nHistory.\nA 1959 book on electrophoresis by Milan Bier cites references from the 1800s. However, Oliver Smithies made significant contributions. Bier states: \"The method of Smithies ... is finding wide application because of its unique separatory power.\" Taken in context, Bier clearly implies that Smithies' method is an improvement.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "12583", "revid": "48643156", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=12583", "title": "Gary Lineker", "text": "English footballer (born 1960)\nGary Winston Lineker (born 30 November 1960) is an English sports broadcaster and former professional footballer who played as a striker. Regarded as one of the best players of his generation and one of England's greatest players, Lineker is the only player to have been the top goalscorer in England with three clubs: Leicester City, Everton and Tottenham Hotspur. He also played for Barcelona in Spain, and won 80 caps for England. His media career began with the BBC, where he presented the flagship football programme \"Match of the Day\" from 1999 until 2025, the longest tenure of any \"MOTD\" presenter. Lineker was also the BBC's lead presenter for live football matches, including coverage of international tournaments such as the FIFA World Cup. He has also worked for Al Jazeera Sports, Eredivisie Live, NBC Sports Network, and BT Sport's coverage of the UEFA Champions League.\nLineker began his football career at Leicester City in 1978, and finished as the First Division's joint top goalscorer in 1984\u201385. He then moved to league champions Everton, where he won both the PFA Players' Player of the Year and FWA Footballer of the Year awards in his debut season, before moving to Spanish club Barcelona, where he won the 1987\u201388 Copa del Rey and the 1989 European Cup Winners' Cup. He joined Tottenham Hotspur in 1989, and won his second FWA Footballer of the Year and the FA Cup, his only major trophy in English football. Lineker's final club was Nagoya Grampus Eight; he retired in 1994 after two seasons at the Japanese side.\nLineker made his England debut in 1984, earning 80 caps and scoring 48 goals over an eight-year international career, which made him England's second-highest goalscorer on his retirement. He remains England's fourth-highest scorer, behind Harry Kane, Wayne Rooney and Bobby Charlton, and his goals-to-games ratio remains one of the best for the country. His six goals in the 1986 World Cup made him the tournament's top scorer, receiving the Golden Boot, and he came second in the 1986 Ballon d'Or. Lineker was again integral to England's progress to the semi-finals of the 1990 World Cup, scoring another four goals. He still holds England's record for goals in the World Cup.\nLineker never received a yellow or red card during his career, and he also never won a top-flight league title. He was honoured in 1990 with the FIFA Fair Play Award. In a senior career which spanned 16 years and 654 competitive games, Lineker scored a total of 331 goals, including 283 goals at club level. After his retirement from football he was inducted into the English Football Hall of Fame. A keen supporter of Leicester City, he led a consortium in 2002 that invested in his old club, saving it from bankruptcy, and was appointed honorary vice-president.\nEarly life.\nGary Winston Lineker was born on 30 November 1960 in Leicester, the son of Margaret P. (Abbs) and Barry Lineker. He was given his middle name in honour of Winston Churchill, with whom he shares a birthday. He has one brother, Wayne, who is two years his junior. Lineker grew up with his family in the city, playing football with Wayne. Their father was a greengrocer, as were their grandfather William and great-grandfather George, in Leicester. Barry Lineker ran Lineker's fruit and veg stall in Leicester Market, and as a child and a young player Gary regularly helped out on the stall. Lineker, who is white, received racial abuse as a child for his dark features.\nLineker first attended Caldecote Road School (Caldecote Juniors), Braunstone in Leicester (east of the Meridian Centre). He then went to the City of Leicester Boys' Grammar School (now City of Leicester College) on Downing Drive in Evington, owing to his preference for football rather than rugby, which was the main sport of most schools near his home. Lineker was equally talented at both football and cricket. From the ages of 11 to 16 he captained the Leicestershire Schools cricket team, and had felt that he had a higher chance of succeeding at it rather than football. He later stated on \"They Think It's All Over\" that as a teenager he idolised former England captain David Gower, who was playing for Leicestershire at the time. During his youth he played for Aylestone Park Youth, later becoming the club's president.\nLineker left school with four O Levels. One of his teachers wrote on his report card that he \"concentrates too much on football\" and that he would \"never make a living at that\". He then joined the youth academy at Leicester City in 1976.\nClub career.\nLeicester City.\nLineker began his career at his hometown club Leicester City after leaving school in 1977, turning professional in the 1978\u201379 season and making his senior debut on New Year's Day 1979 in a 2\u20130 win at Filbert Street over Oldham Athletic in the Second Division. He earned a Second Division title medal a year later with 19 appearances, but played just nine league games in 1980\u201381 as Leicester went straight back down.\nLineker became a regular player in 1981\u201382, scoring 19 goals in all competitions that season. Although Leicester missed out on promotion, they reached the semi-finals of the FA Cup, and clinched promotion a year later as Lineker scored 26 times in the Second Division. In 1983\u201384, he enjoyed regular First Division action for the first time and was the division's second-highest scorer with 22 goals, although Leicester finished in 15th place. He was the First Division's joint top scorer in 1984\u201385 with 24 goals, and was enjoying a prolific partnership with Alan Smith. By this stage he was attracting the attention of bigger clubs, and a move from Filbert Street was looking certain.\nEverton.\nIn the 1985 close season, defending league champions Everton signed Lineker for \u00a3800,000; he scored 40 goals in 57 games for his new team in the 1985\u201386 season. Lineker's first game for Everton happened to be away to Leicester City; at half time, he walked into the Leicester dressing room by mistake. He was again the First Division's leading goalscorer, this time with 30 goals (including three hat-tricks), and helped Everton finish second in the league. While at Everton, they reached the FA Cup final for the third consecutive year but lost 3\u20131 to Liverpool, despite Lineker giving them an early lead when he outpaced Alan Hansen to score. Liverpool had also pipped Everton to the title by just two points. \"I was only on Merseyside a short time, nine or 10 months in total really, but it was still a happy time personally, while professionally it was one of the most successful periods of my career\", he says. \"I still have an affinity towards Everton.\"\nLineker scored three hat-tricks for Everton; at home to Birmingham City in a 4\u20131 league win on 31 August 1985, at home to Manchester City in a 4\u20130 win on 11 February 1986, and then in the penultimate league game of the season on 3 May 1986, when they kept their title hopes alive with a 6\u20131 home win over Southampton. On his final league appearance, he scored twice in a 3\u20131 home win over West Ham United whose own title hopes had just disappeared. Lineker and his colleagues were denied title glory as Liverpool also won their final league game of the season at Chelsea. Lineker has said since retiring from football that this Everton team was the best club side he ever played in.\nBarcelona.\nAfter winning the Golden Boot at the 1986 World Cup in Mexico there were many courters for Lineker across Europe. Barcelona at the time were managed by fellow Englishman Terry Venables, who had arrived in 1984, and who had already brought in Scottish striker Steve Archibald to great effect, and was to also bring in Manchester United and Wales striker Mark Hughes. Lineker was signed by Barcelona for \u00a32.8\u00a0million. Barcelona would give Lineker his first chance of European football, as Leicester had never qualified for Europe while he played for them, and Everton were denied a place in the European Cup for 1985\u201386 due to the ban on English clubs in European competitions following the Heysel disaster.\nBarcelona had won the '84-85 La Liga title in Venables first season at the club, and the 1986 Copa de la Liga the following season but had lost 2 other finals, so there was great anticipation of success at the Camp Nou for Lineker. He made his Barcelona debut against Racing Santander, scoring twice. Barcelona led the league for much of the '86-87 season, until a pair of losses against Real Zaragoza and Sporting Gijon gave advantage to Real Madrid. Two further losses to the same team cemented Barcelona's second place finish. Lineker ultimately had scored 20 goals in 40 league games during his first season, including a hat-trick in a 3\u20132 win over archrivals Real Madrid to make him somewhat of a cult hero. However the club had crashed out of the Copa del Rey at the first hurdle, and suffered a shock defeat to Dundee United in the '87 UEFA Cup where Lineker hadn't scored any goals in 8 appearances.\nFor the '87-88 season hopes were still high for the club, but following three back to back losses at the start of the season Terry Venables was fired and Luis Aragon\u00e9s brought in to replace him as manager. Linekers form remained strong, and he helped the club recover some form and scored a double against Real Madrid in a 4-1 win in the December, but he finished the season with only 16 goals in 35 league games as the club finished 6th, however he had contributed a little more to the cup efforts as the club won the 1988 Copa del Rey, but failed again at the Quarter Finals of the UEFA Cup.\nIn the summer, the club endured a tumultuous off season that culminated in the \"Hesperia Mutiny\" that saw a large number of players and coaches fired after protesting pay and conditions at the club. In the aftermath Barcelona moved to sign former player for the club during their last most successful era, and current Ajax manager Johan Cruyff. The club set about rebuilding its team, retaining only a skeleton of the squad that had finished '87-88 in 6th place - including Lineker. The impact of Cruyff was immediate. Barcelona became a much more attacking side, and finished the season '88-89 season in a much improved 2nd place. However Lineker lost his favoured position at centre forward to new signing Julio Salinas, and saw himself pushed out wide right for most of the season resulting in both the lowest goal output (6) and appearances (26) in the league of Lineker's career as a starter. The club won 1989 European Cup Winners' Cup final where Lineker fared better than previous seasons, scoring four times in 8 outings.\nAs the season came to an end, Barcelona was seeking to raise much needed funds for Cruyff and to free up the \"foreigner\" spot in the squad to continue his rebuilding project at the club, while Lineker was desperate to find first team opportunities in his favoured position.\nWith 42 goals in 103 La Liga appearances, Lineker had become the highest scoring British player in the competition's history, this was later surpassed by Gareth Bale in March 2016.\nTottenham Hotspur.\nManchester United manager Alex Ferguson attempted to sign Lineker to partner his ex-Barcelona teammate Mark Hughes in attack, but Lineker instead signed for Tottenham Hotspur in July 1989 for \u00a31.1\u00a0million. Over three seasons, he scored 67 goals in 105 league games and won the FA Cup while playing for the club. He finished as top scorer in the First Division in the 1989\u201390 season, scoring 24 goals as Spurs finished third.\nLineker finally collected an English trophy when he won the 1991 FA Cup final with Spurs, who beat Nottingham Forest 2\u20131. This was despite Lineker having a goal controversially disallowed for offside and also having a penalty saved by goalkeeper Mark Crossley. Lineker had contributed to Tottenham's run to the final. In the semi-final he scored twice in a 3\u20131 win over North London rivals Arsenal.\nLineker was the top division's second-highest goalscorer in 1991\u201392 with 28 goals from 35 games, behind Ian Wright, who scored 29 times in 42 games. Despite Lineker's personal performance, Tottenham finished this final pre-Premier League season in 15th place. His last goal in English football came on the last day of the season in a 3\u20131 defeat to Manchester United at Old Trafford.\nNagoya Grampus Eight.\nIn November 1991, Lineker accepted an offer of a two-year contract from J1 League club Nagoya Grampus Eight. The transfer fee paid to Tottenham Hotspur was \u00a32\u00a0million. He officially joined Nagoya Grampus Eight after playing his final game for Spurs on 2 May 1992, when he scored the consolation goal in a 3\u20131 defeat by Manchester United on the last day of the season. Shortly before accepting the offer from Nagoya Grampus Eight, Tottenham had rejected an offer from ambitious Second Division club Blackburn Rovers, who had recently been taken over by steel baron Jack Walker.\nHaving scored nine goals in 23 appearances over two injury-impacted seasons for Nagoya Grampus Eight, he announced his retirement from playing in September 1994. The English national media had previously reported that he would be returning to England to complete his playing career at Middlesbrough or Southampton.\nInternational career.\nLineker was capped once by the England B national team, playing in a 2\u20130 home win over New Zealand's B team on 13 November 1984. He first played for the full England team against Scotland in 1984. He played five games in the 1986 World Cup and was top scorer of the tournament with six goals, winning the Golden Boot, making him the first English player to have done so. He scored the second quickest hat-trick ever at a FIFA World Cup tournament against Poland, the second English player to score a hat-trick at a World Cup, and scored two goals against Paraguay in the second round. He played most of the tournament wearing a lightweight cast on his forearm. He scored for England in the World Cup quarter-final against Argentina, but the game ended in defeat as Diego Maradona scored twice for the opposition (the first goal being the \"Hand of God\" handball, and the second being the \"Goal of the Century\"). In 1988, Lineker played in Euro 88, but failed to score as England lost all three Group games. It was later established that he had been suffering from hepatitis.\nIn the 1990 World Cup, he scored four goals to help England reach the semi-finals. He was unwell during the tournament, and accidentally defecated in his shorts during the opening group game against the Republic of Ireland. After Andreas Brehme sent England 1\u20130 down in the semi-final, Lineker received a pass from Paul Parker and escaped two West German defenders on his way to scoring the equaliser, but the West Germans triumphed in the penalty shoot-out and went on to win the trophy. Later he said: \"Football is a simple game; 22 men chase a ball for 90 minutes and at the end, the Germans win.\" Lineker's equaliser appears in the popular England national team anthem, \"Three Lions\", with the lyric \"When Lineker scored\".\nHe retired from international football with eighty caps and 48 goals, one fewer goal than Sir Bobby Charlton's England record (which Charlton accrued over 106 caps). In what proved to be his last England match, against Sweden at Euro 92, he was substituted by England coach Graham Taylor in favour of Arsenal striker Alan Smith, ultimately denying him the chance to equal \u2014 or even better \u2014 Charlton's record. He had earlier missed a penalty that would have brought him level, in a pre-tournament friendly against Brazil. He was visibly upset at the decision, not looking at Taylor as he took the bench.\nHe scored four goals in an England match on two occasions and is one of very few players never to have been given a yellow card or a red card in any type of game.\nMedia career.\nSports presenting.\nFollowing retirement from professional football, Lineker developed a career in the media, initially on the BBC for Radio 5 Live and as a football pundit. He appeared as a team captain on the sports game show \"They Think It's All Over\" from 1995 to 2003. He also presented \"Grandstand\" in the London studio while presenter Des Lynam was in Aintree when the Grand National was abandoned because of a bomb alert at the racecourse in 1997. In 1999, he replaced Lynam as the BBC's lead presenter for football coverage, including its flagship football television programme \"Match of the Day\", becoming BBC Sport's highest paid presenter. Following the departure of Steve Rider from the BBC in 2005, Lineker, who is a keen recreational golfer with a handicap of four, became the new presenter for the corporation's golf coverage. Despite receiving some criticism from his peers, he continued to front the BBC's coverage of the Masters and The Open.\nIn 2005, Lineker was sued for defamation by Australian footballer Harry Kewell over comments Lineker had made writing in his column in \"The Sunday Telegraph\" about Kewell's transfer from Leeds United to Liverpool. However, the jury was unable to reach a verdict. It became known during the case that the article had actually been ghost-written by a journalist at \"The Sunday Telegraph\" following a telephone interview with Lineker.\nIn May 2010, Lineker resigned from his role as columnist for \"The Mail on Sunday\" in protest over the sting operation against Lord Triesman that reportedly jeopardised England's bid to host the 2018 World Cup. Triesman resigned as chairman of the bid and the FA on 16 May 2010 after the publication of a secret recording of a conversation between the peer and a former ministerial aide, during which he claimed that Spain and Russia were planning to bribe referees at the World Cup in South Africa. Lineker then began working as an anchor for the English language football coverage for Al Jazeera Sport, which is broadcast throughout most of the Middle East. He left the Qatar-based network in 2012.\nLineker was the lead presenter of the BBC's coverage of the London 2012 Olympic Games, presenting the evening action each day. This was a role he also took for the Glasgow 2014 Commonwealth Games.\nIn 2013, Lineker began working for NBCSN as part of their Premier League coverage and contributing to the US version of \"Match of the Day\". On 9 June 2015, Lineker was unveiled as the lead presenter of BT Sport's Champions League coverage. On 13 August 2016, Lineker presented the first \"Match of the Day\" of the 2016\u201317 season wearing only boxer shorts. Believing it would simply not happen, he had promised in a tweet from December 2015 that if Leicester City won the Premier League, he would \"present \"Match of the Day\" in just my undies\".\nAs of July 2025, Lineker is the highest-paid BBC presenter, and has been for eight years running, receiving payments of \u00a31.75\u20131.76 million each year between 2016 and 2020, approximately \u00a31.35 million in 2020\u201321, and between \u00a31,350,000 - \u00a31,354,999 in 2024\u201325. His pay has been criticised by Julian Knight, chair of the parliamentary Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Committee, and former BBC presenter Esther Rantzen. The BBC's Director General, Tim Davie, stated that Lineker's pay was justified \"because of the value of analysis to the viewing audience\".\nIn March 2023, Lineker was required to step back from presenting on the BBC for three days due to a controversy over his criticism of the British government's immigration policy on Twitter.\nBBC exit.\nOn 11 November 2024, it was announced that Lineker would be stepping down from presenting \"Match of the Day\" following the conclusion of the 2024\u201325 Premier League season in May 2025. Having been previously announced as leaving the BBC after covering the 2025\u201326 FA Cup and the 2026 World Cup, in May 2025 it was announced that Lineker would leave the BBC completely at the end of the season following further controversy regarding his usage of social media, including sharing a post about Zionism that included an illustration of a rat, historically used as an antisemitic insult. Lineker said he did not see the image, and \"would never consciously repost anything antisemitic\" and added: \"However, I recognise the error and upset that I caused, and reiterate how sorry I am. Stepping back now feels like the responsible course of action.\" He presented his final \"Match of the Day\" on 25 May 2025.\nWalkers advertisements.\nLineker has appeared in television advertisements for the Leicester-based snack company Walkers. Originally signing a \u00a3200,000 deal in 1994, his first advertisement was 1995's \"Welcome Home\" (Lineker had recently returned to England having played in Japan). Walkers temporarily named their salt and vinegar crisps after Lineker, labelling them 'Salt &amp; Lineker', in the late 1990s. In 2000, Lineker's Walkers advertisements were ranked ninth in Channel 4's poll of \"The 100 Greatest TV Ads\".\nOther media appearances.\nIn the 1980s, Gremlin Graphics released three computer games bearing Lineker's name: \"Gary Lineker's Superstar Soccer\", \"Gary Lineker's Superskills\" and \"Gary Lineker's Hot Shot!\" (released in Germany as \"Litti's Hot Shot!\").\nLineker participated in Prince Edward's charity television special \"The Grand Knockout Tournament\" in 1987. He also appeared in the 1991 play \"An Evening with Gary Lineker\" by Arthur Smith and Chris England, which was adapted for television in 1994. He presented a seven-part TV series for the BBC in 1998 (directed by Lloyd Stanton) called \"Gary Lineker's Golden Boots\", with other football celebrities. It was an extensive history of the World Cup focusing on the 'Golden Boots' (top scorers).\nIn 2006, Lineker took on an acting role as the voice of \"Underground Ernie\" on the BBC's children's channel, CBeebies. In December 2008, Lineker appeared on the ITV1 television programme \"Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?\" where he and English rugby union player Austin Healey won \u00a350,000 for the Nicholls Spinal Injury Foundation. In 2009, Lineker and his wife Danielle hosted a series of the BBC's \"Northern Exposure\", following on from Laurence Llewelyn-Bowen from the previous year in visiting and showcasing locations throughout Northern Ireland.\nLineker has made a number of cameo appearances in TV shows and movies, such as the 2002 film \"Bend It Like Beckham,\" the 2014 BBC TV film \"Marvellous\", and a number of appearances in the Apple TV+ football comedy TV series \"Ted Lasso\". In 2013, Lineker participated in the genealogical programme \"Who Do You Think You Are?\" during which he discovered an ancestor who was a poacher, and another who was a legal clerk. In 2021, Lineker started hosting the ITV game show \"Sitting on a Fortune\".\nGoalhanger Films and Podcasts.\nIn May 2014, Lineker established his own production company Goalhanger Films Ltd. with former ITV Controller Tony Pastor. During the 2014 FIFA World Cup, Lineker presented several short videos produced by Goalhanger Films on YouTube with the title \"Blahzil\". In May 2015, the company produced a 60-minute-long documentary presented by Lineker titled \"Gary Lineker on the Road to FA Cup Glory\" for the BBC.\nHe also operates Goalhanger Podcasts, which produces \"Leading\", \"The Rest is History\", \"The Rest is Politics\" and his own podcast, \"The Rest is Football\", which he hosts with Alan Shearer and Micah Richards.\nBaller League UK.\nIn November 2024, it was announced that Lineker would manage one of the 12 teams in the Baller League UK, a six-a-side football league.\nPersonal life.\nLineker married Michelle Cockayne in July 1986, in Knighton, Leicester. They have four sons. In May 2006, Cockayne filed for divorce on the grounds of Lineker's alleged \"unreasonable behaviour\", with documents submitted to the court claiming that his actions in their marriage had caused her \"stress and anxiety\". The couple subsequently stated that the situation was amicable.\nIn November 1991, Lineker's eldest son survived a rare form of leukaemia whilst he was a baby, and was treated at Great Ormond Street Hospital in London. Lineker now supports children's cancer charity CLIC Sargent and has appeared in promotional clips encouraging people to give blood. Lineker has been actively involved with other cancer charities such as Leukaemia Busters, where between 1994 and 2005 Gary and Michelle were the charity's patrons. He has also been involved with the Fight for Life and Cancer Research UK charities.\nLineker was made a freeman of the City of Leicester in 1995 and he has been referred to as \"Leicester's favourite son\".\nIn October 2002, Lineker backed a \u00a35\u00a0million bid to rescue his former club Leicester City, which had recently gone into administration, describing his involvement as \"charity\" rather than an \"ego trip\". He stated that he would invest a six-figure sum and that other members of his consortium would invest a similar amount. Lineker met with fans' groups to persuade them to try and raise money to rescue his former club. The club was eventually saved from liquidation. He is now honorary Vice President of Leicester City.\nLineker married Danielle Bux on 2 September 2009, in Ravello, Italy. On 13 January 2016, Lineker and Bux announced they were divorcing, after six years of marriage, the reason given being Gary not wanting more children.\nLineker lives in Barnes, London.\nIn 1985, Lineker was best man at snooker player Willie Thorne's wedding and their close friendship was the subject of the VHS production, \"Best of Friends \u2013 The Official Story of Gary Lineker &amp; Willie Thorne\".\nIn November 2017, Lineker was named in the Paradise Papers in connection with a tax avoidance scheme relating to property owned in Barbados and a company set up in the British Virgin Islands.\nLineker speaks fluent Spanish, which he learnt during his time playing for FC Barcelona, and is an advocate for the teaching of foreign languages in schools.\nIn April 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic, Lineker announced that he was donating \u00a3140,000 to the British Red Cross towards research into the virus.\nOn 28 March 2023, he won an appeal against HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) over a bill that totalled \u00a34.9 million. HMRC had pursued him over taxes on income from the BBC and BT Sport, from 2013\u201314 to 2017\u201318, on the grounds he was an employee of both organisations at the time. A judge ruled he was a freelancer and had contracts with both broadcasters.\nPolitical views.\nLineker has been noted for political views which he shares on Twitter. In December 2016, he was described by Angus Harrison of Vice News as \"the British Left's Loudest Voice\" for being \"both staunchly liberal and resolutely unafraid of making his views known\". Using a football analogy, Lineker defined his ideological position as \"I make more runs to the left than the right, but never felt comfortable on the wing\". After the 2017 United Kingdom general election, in which Theresa May led the Conservatives and Jeremy Corbyn led Labour, Lineker wrote \"Anyone else feel politically homeless? Everything seems far right or way left. Something sensibly centrist might appeal?\"\nLineker endorsed a Remain vote in the 2016 United Kingdom European Union membership referendum. In July 2018, he announced his support for People's Vote, a campaign group calling for a public vote on the final Brexit deal between the UK and the European Union (EU).\nOn 18 October 2016, Lineker tweeted a rebuttal to a statement made by MP David Davies where Davies suggested refugees entering the UK should undergo dental checks to verify their age: \"The treatment by some towards these young refugees is hideously racist and utterly heartless. What's happening to our country?\" This led \"The Sun\" to call for Lineker's sacking from \"Match of the Day\", accusing him of breaching BBC impartiality guidelines.\nIn December 2018, Lineker was criticised by the BBC's cricket correspondent Jonathan Agnew for expressing his political views on Twitter. Agnew said, \"You are the face of BBC Sport. Please observe BBC editorial guidelines and keep your political views, whatever they are and whatever the subject, to yourself. I'd be sacked if I followed your example.\" A BBC spokesperson said, \"Gary is not involved in any news or political output for the BBC and as such, any expression of his personal political views does not affect the BBC's impartiality.\"\nIn October 2022, a complaint about a tweet from Lineker that referred to donations to the Conservative Party was upheld by the BBC, on the grounds that it breached social media use guidelines and failed to meet editorial standards of impartiality. During the 2022 World Cup, Qatari lawyer Hassan Al-Thawadi criticised Lineker for covering human rights violations in Qatar by stating that he did not talk about such issues with other host countries. In response, Lineker countered on \"The News Agents\" podcast that he covered issues in other host countries, and characterised the United States, one of the countries co-hosting the 2026 World Cup, as an \"extraordinarily racist country\". His statements on the United States were criticised by Culture Secretary Michelle Donelan in January 2023, who said they were \"very derogatory questionable comments\".\n2023 controversy and suspension from \"Match of the Day\".\nIn March 2023, Lineker criticised the British government's asylum policy via Twitter. Commenting on a video message by the Home Secretary, Suella Braverman, about stopping migrants crossing the English Channel in small boats, he said the message was \"beyond awful\" and called the government's policy \"an immeasurably cruel policy directed at the most vulnerable people in language that is not dissimilar to that used by Germany in the 30s\". The comments received condemnation from some Conservative politicians, including Braverman herself, and a spokesperson for Labour leader Keir Starmer said comparisons with 1930s Germany \"aren't always the best way\" to make an argument. Lineker received support from other political figures, including Baron Dubs, Alastair Campbell, and Angela Rayner. A BBC source said the corporation was taking the matter \"seriously\" and expected to have a \"frank conversation\" with Lineker. The BBC's culture and media editor Katie Razzall wrote, \"As the UK's most scrutinised media organisation in increasingly polarised times, to say Gary Lineker's recent tweets cause difficulty for the BBC is an understatement.\" Lineker said he stood by his comments and did not fear suspension from his BBC work.\nOn 10 March, the BBC said Lineker would step back from his job on \"Match of the Day\" because it considered \"his recent social media activity to be a breach of our guidelines\". It added it had \"decided Lineker will not present \"Match of the Day\" until there's an agreed and clear position on his use of social media\". Lineker's BBC Sport colleagues Ian Wright, Alan Shearer, Steve Wilson, Conor McNamara, Robyn Cowen, Steven Wyeth, Alex Scott, Jason Mohammad, Mark Chapman, Jermaine Jenas, Dion Dublin and Jermain Defoe all pulled out of their respective roles in BBC programmes in the next hours in solidarity with him. As a result, the broadcaster was forced to reduce its sports-related schedules for 11 and 12 March, with \"Match of the Day\" going ahead without any hosts or studio presentation, thus featuring only match footage. It also affected the BBC World Service's English-language programme \"Sportsworld\", which was not aired on that day and was instead replaced with alternative programming. The BBC and Lineker issued coordinated statements on 13 March. Lineker's suspension was ended and the BBC announced it would initiate an independent review of its social media guidelines and how they apply to freelancers outside news. The BBC's director-general, Tim Davie, stated that Lineker had agreed to abide by the corporation's editorial guidelines until the review into them has been completed.\nSince the controversy, Lineker has continued to use Twitter to comment on political issues. On 21 November 2023, he tweeted: \"Worth 13 minutes of anyone's time.\" The tweet was accompanied by a link to an interview between Owen Jones and Raz Segal, in which Segal stated that Israel's actions in the Gaza war were \"a textbook case of genocide\". Lineker's tweet was interpreted by some to be an endorsement of Segal's views.\nIn December 2023, Lineker signed an open letter criticising the government's proposal to send asylum seekers to Rwanda. Defence Secretary Grant Shapps, Conservative Party deputy chairman Lee Anderson, and Jonathan Gullis accused him of violating impartiality and lodged a complaint with the BBC.\nCareer statistics.\nClub.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nInternational.\nLineker earned his first cap for England in 1984 against Scotland during the 1983\u201384 British Home Championship. He played his last game for England in a 2\u20131 loss against Sweden in a Euro 1992 group stage match. He almost equalled the England goalscoring record, held at the time by Bobby Charlton, in a pre-tournament friendly against Brazil, but he missed a penalty kick, leaving him one goal short of Charlton's total, which was overtaken by Wayne Rooney in 2015.\n\"Scores and results list England's goal tally first, score column indicates score after each Lineker goal\".\nHonours.\nLeicester City\nEverton\nBarcelona\nTottenham Hotspur\nIndividual\nFellowships.\nLineker is a Visiting Fellow of Lady Margaret Hall, University of Oxford, appointed 2020.\nHonours and awards.\nIn 1992, he received an Honorary Master of Arts award from Loughborough University.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "12584", "revid": "2051880", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=12584", "title": "Golgi apparatus", "text": "Cell organelle that packages proteins for export\nThe Golgi apparatus (), also known as the Golgi complex, Golgi body, or simply the Golgi, is an organelle found in most eukaryotic cells. Part of the endomembrane system in the cytoplasm, it packages proteins into membrane-bound vesicles inside the cell before the vesicles are sent to their destination. It resides at the intersection of the secretory, lysosomal, and endocytic pathways. It is of particular importance in processing proteins for secretion, containing a set of glycosylation enzymes that attach various sugar monomers to proteins as the proteins move through the apparatus.\nThe Golgi apparatus was identified in 1898 by the Italian biologist and pathologist Camillo Golgi. The organelle was later named after him in the 1910s.\nDiscovery.\nBecause of its large size and distinctive structure, the Golgi apparatus was one of the first organelles to be discovered and observed in detail. It was discovered in 1898 by Italian physician Camillo Golgi during an investigation of the nervous system. After first observing it under his microscope, he termed the structure as \"apparato reticolare interno\" (\"internal reticular apparatus\"). Some doubted the discovery at first, arguing that the appearance of the structure was merely an optical illusion created by Golgi's observation technique. With the development of modern microscopes in the twentieth century, the discovery was confirmed. Early references to the Golgi apparatus referred to it by various names, including the Golgi\u2013Holmgren apparatus, Golgi\u2013Holmgren ducts, and Golgi\u2013Kopsch apparatus. The term Golgi apparatus was used in 1910 and first appeared in scientific literature in 1913, while \"Golgi complex\" was introduced in 1956.\nSubcellular localization.\nThe subcellular localization of the Golgi apparatus varies among eukaryotes. In mammals, a single Golgi apparatus is usually located near the cell nucleus, close to the centrosome. Tubular connections are responsible for linking the stacks together. Localization and tubular connections of the Golgi apparatus are dependent on microtubules. In experiments, it is seen that as microtubules are depolymerized, the Golgi apparatuses lose mutual connections and become individual stacks throughout the cytoplasm. In yeast, multiple Golgi apparatuses are scattered throughout the cytoplasm (as observed in \"Saccharomyces cerevisiae\"). In plants, Golgi stacks are not concentrated at the centrosomal region and do not form Golgi ribbons. Organization of the plant Golgi depends on actin cables and not microtubules. The common feature among Golgi is that they are adjacent to endoplasmic reticulum (ER) exit sites.\nStructure.\nIn most eukaryotes, the Golgi apparatus is made up of a series of compartments and is a collection of fused, flattened membrane-enclosed disks known as cisternae (singular: \"cisterna\", also called \"dictyosomes\"), originating from vesicular clusters that bud off the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). A mammalian cell typically contains 40 to 100 stacks of cisternae. Between four and eight cisternae are usually present in a stack; however, in some protists, as many as sixty cisternae have been observed. This collection of cisternae is broken down into \"cis\", medial, and \"trans\" compartments, making up two main networks: the cis Golgi network (CGN) and the trans Golgi network (TGN). The CGN is the first cisternal structure, and the TGN is the final, from which proteins are packaged into vesicles destined to lysosomes, secretory vesicles, or the cell surface. The TGN is usually positioned adjacent to the stack, but can also be separate from it. The TGN may act as an early endosome in yeast and plants.\nThere are structural and organizational differences in the Golgi apparatus among eukaryotes. In some yeasts, Golgi stacking is not observed. \"Pichia pastoris\" does have stacked Golgi, while \"Saccharomyces cerevisiae\" does not. In plants, the individual stacks of the Golgi apparatus seem to operate independently.\nThe Golgi apparatus tends to be larger and more numerous in cells that synthesize and secrete large amounts of substances; for example, the antibody-secreting plasma B cells of the immune system have prominent Golgi complexes.\nIn all eukaryotes, each cisternal stack has a \"cis\" entry face and a \"trans\" exit face. These faces are characterized by unique morphology and biochemistry. Within individual stacks are assortments of enzymes responsible for selectively modifying protein cargo. These modifications influence the fate of the protein. The compartmentalization of the Golgi apparatus is advantageous for separating enzymes, thereby maintaining consecutive and selective processing steps: enzymes catalyzing early modifications are gathered in the \"cis\" face cisternae, and enzymes catalyzing later modifications are found in \"trans\" face cisternae of the Golgi stacks.\nFunction.\nThe Golgi apparatus is a major collection and dispatch station of protein products received from the endoplasmic reticulum. Proteins synthesized in the ER are packaged into vesicles, which then fuse with the Golgi apparatus. These cargo proteins are modified and destined for secretion via exocytosis or for use in the cell.\nIn this respect, the Golgi can be thought of as similar to a post office: it packages and labels items which it then sends to different parts of the cell or to the extracellular space. The Golgi apparatus is also involved in lipid transport and lysosome formation.\nThe structure and function of the Golgi apparatus are intimately linked. Individual stacks have different assortments of enzymes, allowing for progressive processing of cargo proteins as they travel from the cisternae to the trans Golgi face. Enzymatic reactions within the Golgi stacks occur exclusively near its membrane surfaces, where enzymes are anchored. This feature is in contrast to the ER, which has soluble proteins and enzymes in its lumen. Much of the enzymatic processing is post-translational modification of proteins. For example, phosphorylation of oligosaccharides on lysosomal proteins occurs in the early CGN. \"Cis\" cisterna are associated with the removal of mannose residues. Removal of mannose residues and addition of N-acetylglucosamine occur in medial cisternae. Addition of galactose and sialic acid occurs in the \"trans\" cisternae. Sulfation of tyrosines and carbohydrates occurs within the TGN. Other general post-translational modifications of proteins include the addition of carbohydrates (glycosylation) and phosphates (phosphorylation). Protein modifications may form a signal sequence that determines the final destination of the protein. For example, the Golgi apparatus adds a mannose-6-phosphate label to proteins destined for lysosomes. Another important function of the Golgi apparatus is in the formation of proteoglycans. Enzymes in the Golgi append proteins to glycosaminoglycans, thus creating proteoglycans. Glycosaminoglycans are long unbranched polysaccharide molecules present in the extracellular matrix of animals.\nVesicular transport.\nThe vesicles that leave the rough endoplasmic reticulum are transported to the \"cis\" face of the Golgi apparatus, where they fuse with the Golgi membrane and empty their contents into the lumen. Once inside the lumen, the molecules are modified, then sorted for transport to their next destinations.\nThose proteins destined for areas of the cell other than either the endoplasmic reticulum or the Golgi apparatus are moved through the Golgi cisternae towards the \"trans\" face, to a complex network of membranes and associated vesicles known as the \"trans-Golgi network\" (TGN). This area of the Golgi is the point at which proteins are sorted and shipped to their intended destinations by their placement into one of at least three different types of vesicles, depending upon the signal sequence they carry.\nCurrent models of vesicular transport and trafficking.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Unsolved/styles.css\" /&gt;\nUnsolved problem in biology\nIn cell theory, what is the exact transport mechanism by which proteins travel through the Golgi apparatus?\nMore unsolved problems in biology\nModel 5: Stable compartments as cisternal model progenitors.\nThough there are multiple models that attempt to explain vesicular traffic throughout the Golgi, no individual model can independently explain all observations of the Golgi apparatus. Currently, the cisternal progression/maturation model is the most accepted among scientists, accommodating many observations across eukaryotes. The other models are still important in framing questions and guiding future experimentation. Among the fundamental unanswered questions are the directionality of COPI vesicles and role of Rab GTPases in modulating protein cargo traffic.\nBrefeldin A.\nBrefeldin A (BFA) is a fungal metabolite used experimentally to disrupt the secretion pathway as a method of testing Golgi function. BFA blocks the activation of some ADP-ribosylation factors (ARFs). ARFs are small GTPases which regulate vesicular trafficking through the binding of COPs to endosomes and the Golgi. BFA inhibits the function of several guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) that mediate GTP-binding of ARFs. Treatment of cells with BFA thus disrupts the secretion pathway, promoting disassembly of the Golgi apparatus and distributing Golgi proteins to the endosomes and ER.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

She was a pioneer of computer programming. Hopper was the first to devise the theory of machine-independent programming languages, and used this theory to develop the FLOW-MATIC programming language and COBOL, an early high-level programming language still in use today. She was also one of the first programmers on the Harvard Mark I computer. She is credited with writing the first computer manual, \"A Manual of Operation for the Automatic Sequence Controlled Calculator.\"\nBefore joining the Navy, Hopper earned a Ph.D. in both mathematics and mathematical physics from Yale University and was a professor of mathematics at Vassar College. She left her position at Vassar to join the United States Navy Reserve during World War II. Hopper began her computing career in 1944 as a member of the Harvard Mark I team, led by Howard H. Aiken. In 1949, she joined the Eckert\u2013Mauchly Computer Corporation and was part of the team that developed the UNIVAC I computer. At Eckert\u2013Mauchly she managed the development of one of the first COBOL compilers.\nShe believed that programming should be simplified with an English-based computer programming language. Her compiler converted English terms into machine code understood by computers. By 1952, Hopper had finished her program linker (originally called a compiler), which was written for the A-0 System. In 1954, Eckert\u2013Mauchly chose Hopper to lead their department for automatic programming, and she led the release of some of the first compiled languages like FLOW-MATIC. In 1959, she participated in the CODASYL consortium, helping to create a machine-independent programming language called COBOL, which was based on English words. Hopper promoted the use of the language throughout the 60s.\nThe U.S. Navy guided-missile destroyer was named for her, as was the Cray XE6 \"Hopper\" supercomputer at NERSC, and the Nvidia GPU architecture \"Hopper\". During her lifetime, Hopper was awarded 40 honorary degrees from universities across the world. A college at Yale University was renamed in her honor. In 1991, she received the National Medal of Technology. On November 22, 2016, she was posthumously awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom by President Barack Obama. In 2024, the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) dedicated a marker in honor of Grace Hopper at the University of Pennsylvania for her role in inventing the A-0 compiler during her time as a Lecturer in the School of Engineering, citing her inspirational impact on young engineers.\nEarly life and education.\nGrace Brewster Murray was born in New York City. She was the eldest of three children. Her parents, Walter Fletcher Murray and Mary Campbell Van Horne, were of Scottish and Dutch descent, and attended West End Collegiate Church. Her great-grandfather, Alexander Wilson Russell, an admiral in the US Navy, fought in the Battle of Mobile Bay during the Civil War.\nGrace was very curious as a child; this was a lifelong trait. At the age of seven, she decided to determine how an alarm clock worked and dismantled seven alarm clocks before her mother realized what she was doing (she was then limited to one clock). Later in life, she was known for keeping a clock that ran backward; she explained, \"Humans are allergic to change. They love to say, 'We've always done it this way.' I try to fight that. That's why I have a clock on my wall that runs counterclockwise.\" For her preparatory school education, she attended the Hartridge School in Plainfield, New Jersey. Grace was initially rejected for early admission to Vassar College at age 16 (because her test scores in Latin were too low), but she was admitted the next year. She graduated Phi Beta Kappa from Vassar in 1928 with a bachelor's degree in mathematics and physics and earned her master's degree at Yale University in 1930.\nIn 1930, Grace Murray married New York University professor Vincent Foster Hopper (1906\u20131976); they divorced in 1945. She did not marry again and retained his surname.\nIn 1934, Hopper earned a Ph.D. in mathematics from Yale under the direction of \u00d8ystein Ore. Her dissertation, \"New Types of Irreducibility Criteria\", was published that year. She began teaching mathematics at Vassar in 1931, and was promoted to associate professor in 1941.\nCareer.\nWorld War II.\nHopper tried to be commissioned in the Navy early in World War II, however she was turned down. At age 34, she was too old to enlist and her weight-to-height ratio was too low. She was also denied on the basis that her job as a mathematician and mathematics professor at Vassar College was valuable to the war effort. During the war in 1943, Hopper obtained a leave of absence from Vassar and was sworn into the United States Navy Reserve; she was one of many women who volunteered to serve in the WAVES.\nShe had to get an exemption to be commissioned; she was below the Navy minimum weight of . She reported in December and trained at the Naval Reserve Midshipmen's School at Smith College in Northampton, Massachusetts. Hopper graduated first in her class in 1944, and was assigned to the Bureau of Ships Computation Project at Harvard University as a lieutenant, junior grade. She served on the Mark I computer programming staff headed by Howard H. Aiken.\nHopper and Aiken co-authored three papers on the Mark I, also known as the Automatic Sequence Controlled Calculator. Hopper's request to transfer to the regular Navy, out of WAVES, at the end of the war was denied due to being two years older than the cutoff age of 38. She continued to serve in the Navy Reserve. Hopper remained at the Harvard Computation Lab until 1949, turning down a full professorship at Vassar in favor of working as a research fellow under a Navy contract at Harvard.\nUNIVAC.\nIn 1949, Hopper became an employee of the Eckert\u2013Mauchly Computer Corporation as a senior mathematician and joined the team developing the UNIVAC I. Hopper also served as UNIVAC director of Automatic Programming Development for Remington Rand. The UNIVAC was the first known large-scale electronic computer to be on the market in 1951.\nWhen Hopper recommended the development of a new programming language that would use entirely English words, she \"was told very quickly that [she] couldn't do this because computers didn't understand English.\" Still, she persisted. \"It's much easier for most people to write an English statement than it is to use symbols\", she explained. \"So I decided data processors ought to be able to write their programs in English, and the computers would translate them into machine code.\"\nHer idea was not accepted for three years. In the meantime, she published her first paper on the subject, compilers, in 1952. In the early 1950s, the company was taken over by the Remington Rand corporation, and it was while she was working for them that her original compiler work was done. The program was known as the A compiler and its first version was A-0.\nIn 1952, she had an operational link-loader, which at the time was referred to as a compiler. She later said that \"Nobody believed that\", and that she \"had a running compiler and nobody would touch it. They told me computers could only do arithmetic.\"\nIn 1954 Hopper was named the company's first director of automatic programming. Beginning in 1954, Hopper's work was influenced by the Laning and Zierler system, which was the first compiler to accept algebraic notation as input. Her department released some of the first compiler-based programming languages, including MATH-MATIC and FLOW-MATIC.\nHopper said that her compiler A-0, \"translated mathematical notation into machine code. Manipulating symbols was fine for mathematicians but it was no good for data processors who were not symbol manipulators. Very few people are really symbol manipulators. If they are, they become professional mathematicians, not data processors. It's much easier for most people to write an English statement than it is to use symbols. So I decided data processors ought to be able to write their programs in English, and the computers would translate them into machine code. That was the beginning of COBOL, a computer language for data processors. I could say 'Subtract income tax from pay' instead of trying to write that in octal code or using all kinds of symbols. COBOL is the major language used today in data processing.\"\nCOBOL.\nIn the spring of 1959, computer experts from industry and government were brought together in a two-day conference known as the Conference on Data Systems Languages (CODASYL). Hopper served as a technical consultant to the committee, and many of her former employees served on the short-term committee that defined the new language COBOL (an acronym for COmmon Business-Oriented Language). The new language extended Hopper's FLOW-MATIC language with some ideas from the IBM equivalent, COMTRAN. Hopper's belief that programs should be written in a language that was close to English (rather than in machine code or in languages close to machine code, such as assembly languages) was captured in the new business language, and COBOL went on to be the most ubiquitous business language to date. Among the members of the committee that worked on COBOL was Mount Holyoke College alumna Jean E. Sammet.\nFrom 1967 to 1977, Hopper served as the director of the Navy Programming Languages Group in the Navy's Office of Information Systems Planning and was promoted to the rank of captain in 1973. She developed validation software for COBOL and its compiler as part of a COBOL standardization program for the entire Navy.\nStandards.\nIn the 1970s, Hopper advocated for the Defense Department to replace large, centralized systems with networks of small, distributed computers. Any user on any computer node could access common databases on the network. She developed the implementation of standards for testing computer systems and components, most significantly for early programming languages such as FORTRAN and COBOL. The Navy tests for conformance to these standards led to significant convergence among the programming language dialects of the major computer vendors. In the 1980s, these tests (and their official administration) were assumed by the National Bureau of Standards (NBS), known today as the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST).\nRetirement.\nIn accordance with Navy attrition regulations, Hopper retired from the Naval Reserve with the rank of commander at age 60 at the end of 1966.&lt;ref name=\"urlAttrition/Retirement\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; She was recalled to active duty in August 1967 for a six-month period that turned into an indefinite assignment. She again retired in 1971 but was again asked to return to active duty in 1972. She was promoted to captain in 1973 by Admiral Elmo R. Zumwalt Jr.\nAfter Republican Representative Philip Crane saw her on a March 1983 segment of \"60 Minutes\", he championed a joint resolution to promote Hopper to commodore on the retired list; the resolution was referred to, but not reported out of, the Senate Armed Services Committee. Hopper was instead promoted to commodore on December 15, 1983, via the Appointments Clause by President Ronald Reagan. She remained on active duty for several years beyond mandatory retirement by special approval of Congress. Effective November 8, 1985, the rank of commodore was renamed rear admiral (lower half) and Hopper became one of the Navy's few female admirals.\nAfter a career that spanned more than 42 years, Hopper retired from the Navy on August 14, 1986. At the time, she was the oldest serving member of the Navy. At a celebration held in Boston on the to commemorate her retirement, Hopper was awarded the Defense Distinguished Service Medal, the highest non-combat decoration awarded by the Department of Defense.\nAt the time of her retirement, she was the oldest active-duty commissioned officer in the United States Navy (79 years, eight months and five days), and had her retirement ceremony aboard the oldest commissioned ship in the United States Navy (188 years, 9 months, 23 days).\nPost-retirement.\nAfter her retirement from the Navy, Hopper was hired as a senior consultant to Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC). Hopper was initially offered a position by Rita Yavinsky, but she insisted on going through the typical formal interview process. She then proposed in jest that she would be willing to accept a position which made her available on alternating Thursdays, exhibited at their museum of computing as a pioneer, in exchange for a generous salary and unlimited expense account. Instead, she was hired as a full-time Principal Corporate Consulting Engineer, a tech-track SVP-equivalent. In this position, Hopper represented the company at industry forums, serving on various industry committees, along with other obligations. She retained that position until her death at age 85 in 1992.\nAt DEC Hopper served primarily as a goodwill ambassador. She lectured widely about the early days of computing, her career, and on efforts that computer vendors could take to make life easier for their users. She visited most of Digital's engineering facilities, where she generally received a standing ovation at the conclusion of her remarks. Although no longer a serving officer, she always wore her Navy full dress uniform to these lectures contrary to U.S. Department of Defense policy. In 2016 Hopper received the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the nation's highest civilian honor, in recognition of her remarkable contributions to the field of computer science.\n\"The most important thing I've accomplished, other than building the compiler,\" she said, \"is training young people. They come to me, you know, and say, 'Do you think we can do this?' I say, 'Try it.' And I back 'em up. They need that. I keep track of them as they get older and I stir 'em up at intervals so they don't forget to take chances.\"\nAnecdotes.\nThroughout much of her later career, Hopper was much in demand as a speaker at various computer-related events. She was well known for her lively and irreverent speaking style, as well as a rich treasury of early war stories. She also received the nickname \"Grandma COBOL\".\nWhile Hopper was working on a Mark II Computer at Harvard University in 1947, her associates discovered a moth that was stuck in a relay and impeding the operation of the computer. Upon extraction, the insect was affixed to a log sheet for that day with the notation, \"First actual case of bug being found\". While neither she nor her crew members mentioned the exact phrase, \"debugging\", in their log entries, the case is held as a historical instance of \"debugging\" a computer and Hopper is credited with popularizing the term in computing. For many decades, the term \"bug\" for a malfunction had been in use in several fields before being applied to computers. The remains of the moth can be found taped into the group's log book at the Smithsonian Institution's National Museum of American History in Washington, D.C.\nHopper became known for her \"nanoseconds\" visual aid. People (such as generals and admirals) used to ask her why satellite communication took so long. She started handing out pieces of wire that were just under one foot long\u2014\u2014the distance that light travels in one nanosecond. She gave these pieces of wire the metonym \"nanoseconds\". She was careful to tell her audience that the length of her nanoseconds was actually the maximum distance the signals would travel in a vacuum in a nanosecond, and that signals would travel more slowly through the actual wires that were her teaching aids. Later she used the same pieces of wire to illustrate why computers had to be small to be fast.

The GNU Manifesto was published in March 1985 in \"Dr. Dobb's Journal of Software Tools\". It is held in high regard within the free software movement as a fundamental philosophical source.\nThe full text is included with GNU software such as Emacs, and is publicly available.\nBackground.\nSome parts of the \"GNU Manifesto\" began as an announcement of the GNU Project posted by Richard Stallman on September 27, 1983, in form of an email on Usenet newsgroups. The project's aim was to give computer users freedom and control over their computers by collaboratively developing and providing software that is based on Stallman's idea of software freedom (although the written definition had not existed until February 1986). The manifesto was written as a way to familiarize more people with these concepts, and to find more support in form of work, money, programs and hardware.\nThe \"GNU Manifesto\" possessed its name and full written form in 1985 but was updated in minor ways in 1987.\nSummary.\nThe \"GNU Manifesto\" opens with an explanation of what the GNU Project is, and what is the current, at the time, progress in creation of the GNU operating system. The system, although based on, and compatible with Unix, is meant by the author to have many improvements over it, which are listed in detail in the manifesto.\nOne of the major driving points behind the GNU project, according to Stallman, was the rapid (at the time) trend toward Unix and its various components becoming proprietary (i.e. closed-source and non-libre) software.\nThe manifesto lays a philosophical basis for launching the project, and importance of bringing it to fruition \u2014 proprietary software is a way to divide users, who are no longer able to help each other. Stallman refuses to write proprietary software as a sign of solidarity with them.\nThe author provides many reasons for why the project and software freedom is beneficial to users, although he agrees that its wide adoption will make the work of programmers less profitable.\nA large part of the \"GNU Manifesto\" is focused on rebutting possible objections to GNU Project's goals. They include the programmer's need to make a living, the issue of advertising and distributing free software, and the perceived need of a profit incentive.\nInspired by GNU Manifesto.\nThroughout history, the \"GNU Manifesto\" has inspired various other UNIX-related manifestos. Based on it, 10 years later, a popular magazine Linux Focus released its manifesto. 20 years later, a popular illustrations publisher has published their Linux developer manifesto.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

GDP is often used to measure the economic activity of a country or region. The major components of GDP are consumption, government spending, net exports (exports minus imports), and investment. Changing any of these factors can increase the size of the economy. For example, population growth through mass immigration can raise consumption and demand for public services, thereby contributing to GDP growth. However, GDP is not a measure of overall standard of living or well-being, as it does not account for how income is distributed among the population. A country may rank high in GDP but still experience jobless growth depending on its planned economic structure and strategies. Dividing total GDP by the population gives an idealized rough measure of GDP per capita. Several national and international economic organizations, such as the OECD and the International Monetary Fund, maintain their own definitions of GDP.\nGDP is often used as a metric for international comparisons as well as a broad measure of economic progress. It serves as a statistical indicator of national development and progress. Total GDP can also be broken down into the contribution of each industry or sector of the economy. Nominal GDP is useful when comparing national economies on the international market using current exchange rate. To compare economies over time inflation can be adjusted by comparing real instead of nominal values. For cross-country comparisons, GDP figures are often adjusted for differences in the cost of living using purchasing power parity (PPP). GDP per capita at purchasing power parity can be useful for comparing living standards between nations. \nGDP has been criticized for leaving out key externalities, such as resource extraction, environmental impact and unpaid domestic work. Alternative economic indicators such as doughnut economics use other measures, such as the Human Development Index or Better Life Index, as better approaches to measuring the effect of the economy on human development and well being.\nHistory.\nSir William Petty came up with a concept of GDP, to calculate the tax burden, and argue landlords were unfairly taxed during warfare between the Dutch and the English between 1652 and 1674. Charles Davenant developed the method further in 1695.\nThe modern concept of GDP was first developed by Simon Kuznets for a 1934 U.S. Congress report, where he warned against its use as a measure of welfare (see below under \"limitations and criticisms\"). After the Bretton Woods Conference in 1944, GDP became the main tool for measuring a country's economy. At that time gross national product (GNP) was the preferred estimate, which differed from GDP in that it measured production by a country's citizens at home and abroad rather than its \"resident institutional units\" (see OECD definition above). The switch from GNP to GDP in the United States occurred in 1991. The role that measurements of GDP played in World War II was crucial to the subsequent political acceptance of GDP values as indicators of national development and progress. A crucial role was played here by the U.S. Department of Commerce under Milton Gilbert where ideas from Kuznets were embedded into institutions.\nThe history of the concept of GDP should be distinguished from the history of changes in many ways of estimating it. The value added by firms is relatively easy to calculate from their accounts, but the value added by the public sector, by financial industries, and by intangible asset creation is more complex. These activities are increasingly important in developed economies, and the international conventions governing their estimation and their inclusion or exclusion in GDP regularly change in an attempt to keep up with industrial advances. In the words of one academic economist, \"The actual number for GDP is, therefore, the product of a vast patchwork of statistics and a complicated set of processes carried out on the raw data to fit them to the conceptual framework.\"\nChina officially adopted GDP in 1993 as its indicator of economic performance. Previously, China had relied on a Marxist-inspired national accounting system.\nDetermining gross domestic product (GDP).\nGDP can be determined in three ways, all of which should, theoretically, give the same result. They are the production (or output or value added) approach, the income approach, and the speculated expenditure approach. It is representative of the total output and income within an economy.\nThe most direct of the three is the production approach, which sums the outputs of every class of enterprise to arrive at the total. The expenditure approach works on the principle that all of the products must be bought by somebody, therefore the value of the total product must be equal to people's total expenditures in buying things. The income approach works on the principle that the incomes of the productive factors (\"producers\", colloquially) must be equal to the value of their product, and determines GDP by finding the sum of all producers' incomes.\nProduction approach.\nAlso known as the Value Added Approach, it calculates how much value is contributed at each stage of production.\nThis approach mirrors the OECD (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development) definition given above.\nGross value added = gross value of output \u2013 value of intermediate consumption.\nValue of output = value of the total sales of goods and services plus the value of changes in the inventory.\nThe sum of the gross value added in the various economic activities is known as \"GDP at factor cost\".\nGDP at factor cost plus indirect taxes less subsidies on products = \"GDP at producer price\".\nFor measuring the output of domestic product, economic activities (i.e. industries) are classified into various sectors. After classifying economic activities, the output of each sector is calculated by any of the following two methods:\nThe value of output of all sectors is then added to get the gross value of output at factor cost. Subtracting each sector's intermediate consumption from gross output value gives the GVA (=GDP) at factor cost. Adding indirect tax minus subsidies to GVA (GDP) at factor cost gives the \"GVA (GDP) at producer prices\".\nIncome approach.\nThe second way of estimating GDP is to use \"the sum of primary incomes distributed by resident producer units\".\nIf GDP is calculated this way it is sometimes called gross domestic income (GDI), or GDP (I). GDI should provide the same amount as the expenditure method described later. By definition, GDI is equal to GDP. In practice, however, measurement errors will make the two figures slightly off when reported by national statistical agencies.\nThis method measures GDP by adding incomes that firms pay households for factors of production they hire \u2013 wages for labour, interest for capital, rent for land and profits for entrepreneurship.\nThe US \"National Income and Product Accounts\" divide incomes into five categories:\nThese five income components sum to net domestic income at factor cost.\nTwo adjustments must be made to get GDP:\nTotal income can be subdivided according to various schemes, leading to various formulae for GDP measured by the income approach. A common one is:\n GDP = Compensation of employeesCOE + gross operating surplusGOS + gross mixed incomeGMI + taxes less subsidies on production and importsTP&amp;M \u2212 SP&amp;M\nThe sum of COE, GOS and GMI is called total factor income; it is the income of all of the factors of production in society. It measures the value of GDP at factor (basic) prices. The difference between basic prices and final prices (those used in the expenditure calculation) is the total taxes and subsidies that the government has levied or paid on that production. So adding taxes less subsidies on production and imports converts GDP(I) at factor cost to GDP(I) at final prices.\nTotal factor income is also sometimes expressed as:\n \"Total factor income\" = \"employee compensation\" + \"corporate profits\" + \"proprietor's income\" + \"rental income\" + \"net interest\"\nExpenditure approach.\nThe third way to estimate GDP is to calculate the sum of the final uses of goods and services (all uses except intermediate consumption) measured in purchasers' prices.\nMarket goods that are produced are purchased by someone. In the case where a good is produced and unsold, the standard accounting convention is that the producer has bought the good from themselves. Therefore, measuring the total expenditure used to buy things is a way of measuring production. This is known as the expenditure method of calculating GDP.\nComponents of GDP by expenditure.\nGDP (Y) is the sum of consumption (C), investment (I), government expenditures (G) and net exports (X \u2212 M).\n Y = C + I + G + (X \u2212 M)\nHere is a description of each GDP component:\nC, I, and G are expenditures on final goods and services; expenditures on intermediate goods and services do not count. (Intermediate goods and services are those used by businesses to produce other goods and services within the accounting year.) So for example if a car manufacturer buys auto parts, assembles the car and sells it, only the final car sold is counted towards the GDP. Meanwhile, if a person buys replacement auto parts to install them on their car, those are counted towards the GDP.\nAccording to the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis, which is responsible for calculating the national accounts in the United States, \"In general, the source data for the expenditures components are considered more reliable than those for the income components [see income method, above].\"\nEncyclopedia Britannica records an alternate way of measuring exports minus imports: notating it as the single variable NX.\nNominal GDP and real GDP.\nThe raw GDP figure given by the equations above is called the nominal, historical, or current GDP. When comparing GDP figures from one year to another, compensating for changes in the value of money\u2014for the effects of inflation or deflation is desirable. To make it more meaningful for year-to-year comparisons, a nominal GDP may be multiplied by the ratio between the value of money in the year the GDP was measured and the value of money in a base year.\nFor example, suppose a country's GDP in 1990 was and its GDP in 2000 was . Suppose also that inflation had halved the value of its currency over that period. To meaningfully compare its GDP in 2000 to its GDP in 1990, we could multiply the GDP in 2000 by one-half, to make it relative to 1990 as a base year. The result would be that the GDP in 2000 equals \u00d7 &lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;1\u20442 = , \"in 1990 monetary terms.\" We would see that the country's GDP had realistically increased 50 percent over that period, not 200 percent, as it might appear from the raw GDP data. The GDP adjusted for changes in money value in this way is called the real GDP.\nThe factor used to convert GDP from current to constant values in this way is called the \"GDP deflator\". Unlike consumer price index, which measures inflation or deflation in the price of household consumer goods, the GDP deflator measures changes in the prices of all domestically produced goods and services in an economy including investment goods and government services, as well as household consumption goods.\nNational measurement.\nWithin each country GDP is normally measured by a national government statistical agency, as private sector organizations normally do not have access to the information required (especially information on expenditure and production by governments).\nInternational standards.\nThe international standard for measuring GDP is contained in the book \"System of National Accounts\" (2008), which was prepared by representatives of the International Monetary Fund, European Union, Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, United Nations and World Bank. The publication is normally referred to as SNA2008 to distinguish it from the previous edition published in 1993 (SNA93) or 1968 (called SNA68)\nSNA2008 provides a set of rules and procedures for the measurement of national accounts. The standards are designed to be flexible, to allow for differences in local statistical needs and conditions.\nProblems with GDP data.\nA peer-reviewed study published in the \"Journal of Political Economy\" in October 2022 found signs of manipulation of economic growth statistics in the majority of countries. According to the study, this mainly applied to countries that were governed semi-authoritarian/authoritarian or did not have a functioning separation of powers. The study took the annual growth in the brightness of lights at night, as measured by satellites, and compared it to officially reported economic growth. Authoritarian states had consistently higher reported growth in GDP than their growth in night lights would suggest. An effect that also cannot be explained by different economic structures, sector composition or other factors. Incorrect growth statistics can also falsify indicators such as GDP or GDP per capita.\nIt has been suggested that countries that have authoritarian governments, such as the People's Republic of China, and Russia, inflate their GDP figures.\nCorporate havens can have a distorted GDP.\nLists of countries by GDP.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nEconomic growth.\nReal GDP can be used to calculate the GDP growth rate, which indicates how much a country's production has increased (or decreased, if the growth rate is negative) compared to the previous year, typically expressed as percentage change. The economic growth can be expressed as:\nRelation to gross national income.\nGDP can be contrasted with the gross national income (GNI) also known as gross national product (GNP). The difference is that GDP defines its scope according to location, while GNI defines its scope according to ownership. In a global context, world GDP and world GNI are, therefore, equivalent terms.\nGDP is a product produced within a country's borders; GNI is product produced by enterprises owned by a country's citizens. The two would be the same if all of the productive enterprises in a country were owned by its own citizens and those citizens did not own productive enterprises in any other countries. In practice, however, foreign ownership makes GDP and GNI non-identical. Production within a country's borders, but by an enterprise owned by somebody outside the country, counts as part of its GDP but not its GNI; on the other hand, production by an enterprise located outside the country, but owned by one of its citizens, counts as part of its GNI but not its GDP.\nFor example, the GNI of the US is the value of output produced by American-owned firms, regardless of where the firms are located. \nGross national income (GNI) equals GDP plus income receipts from the rest of the world minus income payments to the rest of the world.\nIn 1991, the United States switched from using GNP to using GDP as its primary measure of production. The relationship between United States GDP and GNP is shown in table 1.7.5 of the \"National Income and Product Accounts\".\nOther examples that amplify differences between GDP and GNI can be found by comparing indicators of developed and developing countries. The GDP of Japan for 2020 was 5.05559 trillion. Predictably, as a developed country, Japan has a higher GNI of 5.16915 trillion for the same year, an increase of 113.560 million. This is indicative of the production level in the country being higher than that of national production. On the other hand, the case with Armenia is the opposite with its GNI in 2023 being lower than its GDP by 3.85 billion. This shows countries that receive investments and foreign aid from abroad.\nLimitations and criticisms.\nSimon Kuznets, the economist who developed the first comprehensive set of measures of national income, stated in his second report to the U.S. Congress in 1937, in a section titled \"Uses and Abuses of National Income Measurements\":\n The valuable capacity of the human mind to simplify a complex situation in a compact characterization becomes dangerous when not controlled in terms of definitely stated criteria. With quantitative measurements especially, the definiteness of the result suggests, often misleadingly, a precision and simplicity in the outlines of the object measured. Measurements of national income are subject to this type of illusion and resulting abuse, especially since they deal with matters that are the center of conflict of opposing social groups where the effectiveness of an argument is often contingent upon oversimplification. [...]\nAll these qualifications upon estimates of national income as an index of productivity are just as important when income measurements are interpreted from the point of view of economic welfare. But in the latter case additional difficulties will be suggested to anyone who wants to penetrate below the surface of total figures and market values. Economic welfare cannot be adequately measured unless the personal distribution of income is known. And no income measurement undertakes to estimate the reverse side of income, that is, the intensity and unpleasantness of effort going into the earning of income. The welfare of a nation can, therefore, scarcely be inferred from a measurement of national income as defined above. In 1962, Kuznets stated:Distinctions must be kept in mind between quantity and quality of growth, between costs and returns, and between the short and long run. Goals for more growth should specify more growth of what and for what.\nGDP as initially defined includes spending on goods and services that would shrink if underlying problems were solved or reduced - for example, medical care, crime-fighting, and the military. During World War II, Kuznets came to argue that military spending should be excluded during peacetime. This idea did not become popular; these activities are tracked because they fit into macroeconomic models (e.g. military spending uses up capital and labor).\nEver since the development of GDP, multiple observers have pointed out limitations of using GDP as the overarching measure of economic and social progress. Furthermore, the GDP does not consider human health nor the educational aspect of a population.\nInstances of GDP measures have been considered numbers that are artificial constructs. American politician Robert F. Kennedy criticized GDP (or GNI), listing many examples of bad things it does count and good things it does not count:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Gross National Product counts air pollution and cigarette advertising, and ambulances to clear our highways of carnage. It counts special locks for our doors and the jails for the people who break them. It counts the destruction of the redwood and the loss of our natural wonder in chaotic sprawl. It counts napalm and counts nuclear warheads and armored cars for the police to fight the riots in our cities. It counts Whitman's rifle and Speck's knife, and the television programs which glorify violence in order to sell toys to our children. Yet the gross national product does not allow for the health of our children, the quality of their education or the joy of their play. It does not include the beauty of our poetry or the strength of our marriages, the intelligence of our public debate or the integrity of our public officials. It measures neither our wit nor our courage, neither our wisdom nor our learning, neither our compassion nor our devotion to our country, it measures everything in short, except that which makes life worthwhile. And it can tell us everything about America except why we are proud that we are Americans.\nDeficit spending.\nDeficit spending increases GDP in case of positive fiscal multipliers. GDP as a metric can incentivize politicians to overspend. Counterfactual GDP under a balanced budget scenario can be estimated.\nIf a country becomes increasingly in debt, and spends large amounts of income on debt interest expense, will be reflected in a decreased GNI but not a decreased GDP. Similarly, if a country sells off its resources to entities outside their country this will also be reflected over time in decreased GNI, but not decreased GDP. This would make the use of GDP more attractive for politicians in countries with increasing national debt and decreasing assets.\nUnpaid work.\nGDP excludes the value of household and other unpaid work. Some, including Martha Nussbaum, argue that this value should be included in measuring GDP, as household labor is largely a substitute for goods and services that would otherwise be purchased with money. Even under conservative estimates, the value of unpaid labor in Australia has been calculated to be over 50% of the country's GDP. A later study analyzed this value in other countries, with results ranging from a low of about 15% in Canada (using conservative estimates) to high of nearly 70% in the United Kingdom (using more liberal estimates). For the United States, the value was estimated to be between about 20% on the low end to nearly 50% on the high end, depending on the methodology being used. Because many public policies are shaped by GDP calculations and by the related field of national accounts, public policy might differ if unpaid work were included in total GDP. Some economists have advocated for changes in the way public policies are formed and implemented.\nSome have pointed out that GDP did not adapt to sociotechnical changes to give a more accurate picture of the modern economy and does not encapsulate the value of new activities such as delivering price-free information and entertainment on social media. In 2017 Diane Coyle explained that GDP excludes much unpaid work, writing that \"many people contribute free digital work such as writing open-source software that can substitute for marketed equivalents, and it clearly has great economic value despite a price of zero\", which constitutes a common criticism \"of the reliance on GDP as the measure of economic success\" especially after the emergence of the digital economy. A 2025 study in the \"American Economic Journal\" devised a new GDP measurement (GDP-B) that accounts for the welfare value of new goods and free goods.\nIn 2019, Erik Brynjolfsson and Avinash Collis argued that GDP does not reflect the growing value of many digital goods because they have zero price. Along with several coauthors, they proposed an alternative approach, https://, which is based on measuring the \"benefits\" of goods and services, rather than their price or cost.\nHealth.\nIn 2013 scientists reported that large improvements in health only lead to modest long-term increases in GDP per capita. After developing an abstract metric similar to GDP, the Center for Partnership Studies highlighted that GDP \"and other metrics that reflect and perpetuate them\" may not be useful for facilitating the production of products and provision of services that are useful \u2013 or comparatively more useful \u2013 to society, and instead may \"actually encourage, rather than discourage, destructive activities\". The number of obese adults was approximately 600\u00a0million (12%) in 2015.\nEnvironment.\nMany environmentalists argue that GDP is a poor measure of social progress because it does not take into account harm to the environment.\nIn the language of economics, everything comes down to its monetary value. In essence, GDP rewards behaviors that are detrimental to the environment. GDP also does not capture certain phenomena impacting citizens' well-being. For example, traffic jams could cause GDP to increase as there is a higher consumption of gasoline, however, GDP fails to consider citizens' well-being in terms of the quality of air due to air pollution from the traffic jams. Various alternatives have been developed(see below).\nA 2020 study found that \"poor regions' GDP grows faster by attracting more polluting production after connection to China's expressway system. GDP may not be a tool capable of recognizing how much natural capital agents of the economy are building or protecting.\nIn 2020 scientists, as part of a World Scientists' Warning to Humanity-associated series, warned that worldwide growth in affluence in terms of GDP-metrics has increased resource use and pollutant emissions with affluent citizens of the world \u2013 in terms of e.g. resource-intensive consumption \u2013 being responsible for most negative environmental impacts and central to a transition to safer, sustainable conditions. They summarised evidence, presented solution approaches and stated that far-reaching lifestyle changes need to complement technological advancements and that existing societies, economies and cultures incite consumption expansion and that the structural imperative for growth in competitive market economies inhibits societal change. Sarah Arnold, Senior Economist at the New Economics Foundation (NEF) stated that \"GDP includes activities that are detrimental to our economy and society in the long term, such as deforestation, strip mining, overfishing and so on\". The number of trees that are net lost annually is estimated to be approximately 10\u00a0billion. The global average annual deforested land in the 2015\u20132020 demi-decade was 10\u00a0million hectares and the average annual net forest area loss in the 2000\u20132010 decade 4.7\u00a0million hectares, according to the Global Forest Resources Assessment 2020. According to one study, depending on the level of wealth inequality, higher GDP-growth can be associated with more deforestation. In 2019 \"agriculture and agribusiness\" accounted for 24% of the GDP of Brazil, where a large share of annual net tropical forest loss occurred and is associated with sizable portions of this economic activity domain.\nSteve Cohen of the Earth Institute elucidated that while GDP does not distinguish between different activities (or lifestyles), \"all consumption behaviors are not created equal and do not have the same impact on environmental sustainability\". Johan Rockstr\u00f6m, director of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research, noted that \"it's difficult to see if the current G.D.P.-based model of economic growth can go hand-in-hand with rapid cutting of emissions\", which nations have agreed to attempt under the Paris Agreement in order to mitigate real-world impacts of climate change.\nIn 1989, John B. Cobb and Herman Daly introduced Index of Sustainable Economic Welfare (ISEW) by taking into account other factors such as consumption of nonrenewable resources and degradation of the environment. ISEW is roughly defined as: personal consumption + public non-defensive expenditures \u2212 private defensive expenditures + capital formation + services from domestic labour \u2212 costs of environmental degradation \u2212 depreciation of natural capital.\nIn 2005, Med Jones, an American Economist, at the International Institute of Management, introduced the first secular Gross National Happiness Index a.k.a. Gross National Well-being framework and Index to complement GDP economics with additional seven dimensions, including environment, education, and government, work, social and health (mental and physical) indicators. The proposal was inspired by the King of Bhutan's GNH philosophy.\nIn 2019, Serge Pierre Besanger published a \"GDP 3.0\" proposal which combines an expanded GNI formula which he calls GNIX, with a Palma ratio and a set of environmental metrics based on the Daly Rule.\nThe UK's Natural Capital Committee highlighted the shortcomings of GDP in its advice to the UK Government in 2013, pointing out that GDP \"focuses on flows, not stocks. As a result, an economy can run down its assets yet, at the same time, record high levels of GDP growth, until a point is reached where the depleted assets act as a check on future growth\". They then went on to say that \"it is apparent that the recorded GDP growth rate overstates the sustainable growth rate. Broader measures of wellbeing and wealth are needed for this and there is a danger that short-term decisions based solely on what is currently measured by national accounts may prove to be costly in the long-term\".\nChina launched the Gross Ecosystem Product (GEP) in 2020. It measures the contribution of ecosystems to the economy, including by regulating climate. It spread widely across the country. The first province to issue local rules about GEP was Zhejiang , and a year later it has already decided the fate of a project in the Deqing region. For example, the GEP of Chengtian Radon Spring Nature Reserve has been calculated as US$43 million.\nGDP per capita.\nGDP changes with population change. GDP adjusted for population is called \"Per-capita GDP\" or \"GDP per person\". This measures the average production of a person in the country. The major advantage of GDP per capita as an indicator of the standard of living is that it is measured frequently, widely, and consistently. It is measured frequently in that most countries provide information on GDP every quarter, allowing trends to be seen quickly. It is measured widely in that some measure of GDP is available for almost every country in the world, allowing inter-country comparisons. It is measured consistently in that the technical definition of GDP is relatively consistent among countries.\nIt can be argued that GDP per capita is an indicator of standard of living. As a result, GDP per capita as a standard of living is a continued usage because most people have a fairly accurate idea of what it is and know it is tough to come up with quantitative measures for such constructs as happiness, quality of life, and well-being. From the perspective of environmental, social and governance (ESG) measures, GDP per capita trends can be influenced by factors such as gender parity and elements of regulatory quality. The change in number of MSMEs (Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises) in the Philippines from 2008 through 2021 would be an example of elements such as the per capita gross domestic product and unemployment rate having significant effect on a developing country with mixed economy.\nLists of countries by GDP per capita.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nStandard of living.\nAlthough a high or rising level of GDP per capita is often associated with increased economic and social progress, the opposite sometimes occurs. For example, Jean Dr\u00e8ze and Amartya Sen have pointed out that an increase in GDP or in GDP growth does not necessarily lead to a higher standard of living, particularly in areas such as healthcare and education. Another important area that does not necessarily improve along with GDP is political liberty, which is most notable in China, where GDP growth is strong yet political liberties are heavily restricted. GDP does not account for the distribution of income among the residents of a country, because GDP is merely an aggregate measure. An economy may be highly developed or growing rapidly, but also contain a wide gap between the rich and the poor in a society. These inequalities often occur on the lines of race, ethnicity, gender, religion, or other minority status within countries. This can lead to misleading characterizations of economic well-being if the income distribution is heavily skewed toward the high end, as the poorer residents will not directly benefit from the overall level of wealth and income generated in their country (their purchasing power can decline, even as the mean GDP per capita rises). GDP per capita measures (like aggregate GDP measures) do not account for income distribution (and tend to overstate the average income per capita). For example, South Africa during apartheid ranked high in terms of GDP per capita, but the benefits of this immense wealth and income were not shared equally among its citizens. The United Nations has aimed in its Sustainable Development Goals, amongst other global initiatives, to address wealth inequality.\nGDP does not include several factors that influence the standard of living. In particular, it fails to account for:\nIn the 1980s, Amartya Sen and Martha Nussbaum developed the capability approach, which focuses on the functional capabilities enjoyed by people within a country, rather than the aggregate GDP within a country.

{"id": "12598", "revid": "51025196", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=12598", "title": "Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel", "text": "German philosopher (1770\u20131831)\nGeorg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel (27 August 1770 \u2013 14 November 1831) was a German philosopher and a major figure in the tradition of German idealism. His influence on Western philosophy extends across a wide range of topics\u2014from metaphysical issues in epistemology and ontology, to political philosophy, to the philosophy of art and religion.\nHegel was born in Stuttgart. His life spanned the transitional period between the Enlightenment and the Romantic movement. His thought was shaped by the French Revolution and the Napoleonic wars, events which he interpreted from a philosophical perspective. His academic career culminated in his appointment to the chair of philosophy at the University of Berlin, where he remained a prominent intellectual figure until his death.\nThroughout his work, Hegel strove to correct what he argued were untenable dualisms common in modern philosophy. His principal achievement was the development of a comprehensive philosophical system, often termed absolute idealism, to account for reality as a unified whole. Central to this system is the concept of \"spirit\" (\"Geist\"), which Hegel presented as humankind coming to know itself through a historical process of rational development. Hegel's characteristic procedure, often termed dialectical or speculative, assesses concepts and forms of consciousness according to their own internal criteria, revealing their contradictions and one-sidedness. This leads to their resolution in a higher, more comprehensive unity which both cancels and preserves the initial stage. His major works, including the \"Phenomenology of Spirit\" (1807) and the \"Science of Logic\" (1812\u20131816), detail this systematic vision. In his political philosophy, he famously asserted that \"world history is progress in the consciousness of freedom.\"\nHegel's influence has been profound and divisive. After his death, his followers split into rival \"Right\" and \"Left\" Hegelian camps. The Left, including Ludwig Feuerbach and Karl Marx, adapted his dialectical method for their materialist critiques of religion and society. In the twentieth century, his thought was further developed in traditions such as French Hegelianism and critical theory, and became a major point of reference for existentialism.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:TOC limit/styles.css\" /&gt;\nLife.\nFormative years.\nStuttgart, T\u00fcbingen, Berne, Frankfurt (1770\u20131800).\n Hegel was born on 27 August 1770 in Stuttgart, capital of the Duchy of W\u00fcrttemberg in the Holy Roman Empire (now southwestern Germany). Christened Georg Wilhelm Friedrich, he was known as Wilhelm to his close family. His father, Georg Ludwig Hegel (1733\u20131799), was secretary to the revenue office at the court of Karl Eugen, Duke of W\u00fcrttemberg. Hegel's mother, Maria Magdalena Louisa Hegel, n\u00e9e Fromm (1741\u20131783), was the daughter of a lawyer at the High Court of Justice at the W\u00fcrttemberg court Ludwig Albrecht Fromm (1696\u20131758). She died of bilious fever when Hegel was thirteen. Hegel and his father also caught the disease but narrowly survived. Hegel had a sister, Chistiane Luise (1773\u20131832); and a brother, Georg Ludwig (1776\u20131812), who perished as an officer during Napoleon's 1812 Russian campaign. At the age of three, Hegel went to the German School. When he entered the Latin School two years later, he already knew the first declension, having been taught it by his mother. In 1776, he entered Stuttgart's Eberhard-Ludwigs-Gymnasium and during his adolescence read voraciously, copying lengthy extracts in his diary. Authors he read include the poet Friedrich Gottlieb Klopstock and writers associated with the Enlightenment, such as Christian Garve and Gotthold Ephraim Lessing. Hegel's first biographer, Karl Rosenkranz, described in 1844 the young Hegel's education there by saying that it \"belonged entirely to the Enlightenment with respect to principle, and entirely to classical antiquity with respect to curriculum.\" His studies at the \"Gymnasium\" concluded with his graduation speech, \"The abortive state of art and scholarship in Turkey.\"\nAt the age of eighteen, Hegel entered the T\u00fcbinger Stift, a Protestant seminary attached to the University of T\u00fcbingen, where he had as roommates the poet and philosopher Friedrich H\u00f6lderlin and the future philosopher Friedrich Schelling. Sharing a dislike for what they regarded as the restrictive environment of the Seminary, the three became close friends and mutually influenced each other's ideas. (It is mostly likely that Hegel attended the \"Stift\" because it was state-funded, for he had \"a profound distaste for the study of orthodox theology\" and never wanted to become a minister.) All three greatly admired Hellenic civilization, and Hegel additionally steeped himself in Jean-Jacques Rousseau and Lessing during this time. They watched the unfolding of the French Revolution with shared enthusiasm. Although the violence of the 1793 Reign of Terror dampened Hegel's hopes, he continued to identify with the moderate Girondin faction and never lost his commitment to the principles of 1789, which he expressed by drinking a toast to the storming of the Bastille every fourteenth of July. Schelling and H\u00f6lderlin immersed themselves in theoretical debates on Kantian philosophy, from which Hegel remained aloof. Hegel, at this time, envisaged his future as that of a \"Popularphilosoph\" (a \"man of letters\") who serves to make the abstruse ideas of philosophers accessible to a wider public; his own felt need to engage critically with the central ideas of Kantianism would not come until 1800.\nHaving received his theological certificate from the T\u00fcbingen Seminary, Hegel became \"Hofmeister\" (house tutor) to an aristocratic family in Berne (1793\u20131796). During this period, he composed the text which has become known as the \"Life of Jesus\" and a book-length manuscript titled \"The Positivity of the Christian Religion.\" His relations with his employers becoming strained, Hegel accepted an offer mediated by H\u00f6lderlin to take up a similar position with a wine merchant's family in Frankfurt in 1797. There, H\u00f6lderlin exerted an important influence on Hegel's thought. In Berne, Hegel's writings had been sharply critical of orthodox Christianity, but in Frankfurt, under the influence of early Romanticism, he underwent a sort of reversal, exploring, in particular, the mystical experience of love as the true essence of religion. Also in 1797, the unpublished and unsigned manuscript of \"The Oldest Systematic Program of German Idealism\" was written. It was written in Hegel's hand, but may have been authored by Hegel, Schelling, or H\u00f6lderlin. While in Frankfurt, Hegel composed the essay \"Fragments on Religion and Love.\" In 1799, he wrote another essay titled \"The Spirit of Christianity and Its Fate\", unpublished during his lifetime.\nCareer years.\nJena, Bamberg, Nuremberg (1801\u20131816).\nIn 1801, Hegel came to Jena at the encouragement of Schelling, who held the position of Extraordinary Professor at the University of Jena. Hegel secured a position at the University of Jena as a \"Privatdozent\" (unsalaried lecturer) after submitting the inaugural dissertation \"De Orbitis Planetarum\", in which he briefly criticized mathematical arguments that assert that there must exist a planet between Mars and Jupiter. Later in the year, Hegel's essay \"The Difference Between Fichte's and Schelling's System of Philosophy\" was completed. He lectured on \"Logic and Metaphysics\" and gave lectures with Schelling on an \"Introduction to the Idea and Limits of True Philosophy\" and facilitated a \"philosophical disputorium.\" In 1802, Schelling and Hegel founded the journal \"Kritische Journal der Philosophie\" (\"Critical Journal of Philosophy\") to which they contributed until the collaboration ended when Schelling left for W\u00fcrzburg in 1803. In 1805, the university promoted Hegel to the unsalaried position of extraordinary professor after he wrote a letter to the poet and minister of culture Johann Wolfgang von Goethe protesting the promotion of his philosophical adversary Jakob Friedrich Fries ahead of him. Hegel attempted to enlist the help of the poet and translator Johann Heinrich Vo\u00df to obtain a post at the renascent University of Heidelberg, but he failed. To his chagrin, Fries was, in the same year, made ordinary professor (salaried). The following February marked the birth of Hegel's illegitimate son, Georg Ludwig Friedrich Fischer (1807\u20131831), as the result of an affair with Hegel's landlady Christiana Burkhardt n\u00e9e Fischer. With his finances drying up quickly, Hegel was under great pressure to deliver his book, the long-promised introduction to his philosophical system. Hegel was putting the finishing touches to it, \"The Phenomenology of Spirit\", as Napoleon engaged Prussian troops on 14 October 1806 in the Battle of Jena on a plateau outside the city. On the day before the battle, Napoleon entered the city of Jena. Hegel recounted his impressions in a letter to his friend Friedrich Immanuel Niethammer:\nI saw the Emperor \u2013 this world-soul [\"Weltseele\"] \u2013 riding out of the city on reconnaissance. It is indeed a wonderful sensation to see such an individual, who, concentrated here at a single point, astride a horse, reaches out over the world and masters it. \nHegel biographer Terry Pinkard notes that Hegel's comment to Niethammer \"is all the more striking since he had already composed the crucial section of the \"Phenomenology\" in which he remarked that the Revolution had now officially passed to another land (Germany) that would complete 'in thought' what the Revolution had only partially accomplished in practice.\" Although Napoleon had spared the University of Jena from much of the destruction of the surrounding city, few students returned after the battle and enrollment suffered, making Hegel's financial prospects even worse. Hegel traveled in the winter to Bamberg and stayed with Niethammer to oversee the proofs of the \"Phenomenology\", which was being printed there. Although Hegel tried to obtain another professorship, even writing Goethe in an attempt to help secure a permanent position replacing a professor of botany, he was unable to find a permanent position. In 1807, he had to move to Bamberg since his savings and the payment from the \"Phenomenology\" were exhausted and he needed money to support his illegitimate son Ludwig. There, he became the editor of the local newspaper, \"Bamberger Zeitung\", a position he obtained with the help of Niethammer. Ludwig Fischer and his mother stayed behind in Jena.\nIn Bamberg, as editor of the \"Bamberger Zeitung\", which was a pro-French newspaper, Hegel extolled the virtues of Napoleon and often editorialized the Prussian accounts of the war. Being the editor of a local newspaper, Hegel also became an important person in Bamberg social life, often visiting with the local official Johann Heinrich Liebeskind, and becoming involved in local gossip and pursued his passions for cards, fine eating, and the local Bamberg beer. However, Hegel bore contempt for what he saw as \"old Bavaria\", frequently referring to it as \"Barbaria\" and dreaded that \"hometowns\" like Bamberg would lose their autonomy under the new Bavarian state. After being investigated in September 1808 by the Bavarian state for potentially violating security measures by publishing French troop movements, Hegel wrote to Niethammer, now a high official in Munich, pleading for Niethammer's help in securing a teaching position. With the help of Niethammer, Hegel was appointed headmaster of a \"gymnasium\" in Nuremberg in November 1808, a post he held until 1816. While in Nuremberg, Hegel adapted his recently published \"Phenomenology of Spirit\" for use in the classroom. Part of his remit was to teach a class called \"Introduction to Knowledge of the Universal Coherence of the Sciences.\" In 1811, Hegel married Marie Helena Susanna von Tucher (1791\u20131855), the eldest daughter of a Senator. This period saw the publication of his second major work, the \"Science of Logic\" (\"Wissenschaft der Logik\"; 3 vols., 1812, 1813 and 1816), and the birth of two sons, Karl Friedrich Wilhelm (1813\u20131901) and Immanuel Thomas Christian (1814\u20131891).\nHeidelberg, Berlin (1816\u20131831).\nHaving received offers of a post from the Universities of Erlangen, Berlin and Heidelberg, Hegel chose Heidelberg, where he moved in 1816. Soon after, his illegitimate son Ludwig Fischer (now ten years old) joined the Hegel household in April 1817, having spent time in an orphanage after the death of his mother Christiana Burkhardt. In 1817, Hegel published \"Encyclopaedia of the Philosophical Sciences in Basic Outline\" as a summary of his philosophy for students attending his lectures at Heidelberg. It is also while in Heidelberg that Hegel first lectured on the philosophy of art. In 1818, Hegel accepted the renewed offer of the chair of philosophy at the University of Berlin, which had remained vacant since Johann Gottlieb Fichte's death in 1814. Here, Hegel published his \"Elements of the Philosophy of Right\" (1821). Hegel devoted himself primarily to delivering lectures; his lectures on the philosophy of fine art, the philosophy of religion, the philosophy of history, and the history of philosophy were published posthumously from students' notes. In spite of his notoriously terrible delivery, his fame spread and his lectures attracted students from all over Germany and beyond. Meanwhile, Hegel and his pupils, such as Leopold von Henning, Friedrich Wilhelm Carov\u00e9, were harassed and put under the surveillance of Prince Sayn-Wittgenstein, the interior minister of Prussia and his reactionary circles in the Prussian court. In the remainder of his career, he made two trips to Weimar, where he met with Goethe for the last time, and to Brussels, the Northern Netherlands, Leipzig, Vienna, Prague, and Paris.\nDuring the last ten years of his life, Hegel did not publish another book but thoroughly revised the \"Encyclopedia\" (second edition, 1827; third, 1830). In his political philosophy, he criticized Karl Ludwig von Haller's reactionary work, which claimed that laws were not necessary. A number of other works on the philosophy of history, religion, aesthetics and the history of philosophy were compiled from the lecture notes of his students and published posthumously.\nHegel was appointed University Rector of the university in October 1829, but his term ended in September 1830. Hegel was deeply disturbed by the riots for reform in Berlin in that year. In 1831 Frederick William III decorated him with the Order of the Red Eagle, 3rd Class for his service to the Prussian state. In August 1831, a cholera epidemic reached Berlin and Hegel left the city, taking up lodgings in Kreuzberg. Now in a weak state of health, Hegel seldom went out. As the new semester began in October, Hegel returned to Berlin in the mistaken belief that the epidemic had largely subsided. By 14 November, Hegel was dead. The physicians pronounced the cause of death as cholera, but it is likely he died from another gastrointestinal disease. Heinrich Heine wrote that Hegel's last words were, \"There was only one man who ever understood me, and even he didn't understand me.\" Some have described these words as apocryphal. He was buried on 16 November. In accordance with his wishes, Hegel was buried in the Dorotheenstadt cemetery next to Fichte and Karl Wilhelm Ferdinand Solger.\nHegel's illegitimate son, Ludwig Fischer, had died shortly before while serving with the Dutch army in Batavia and the news of his death never reached his father. Early the following year, Hegel's sister Christiane died by suicide by drowning. Hegel's two remaining sons \u2013 Karl, who became a historian; and Immanuel, who followed a theological path \u2013 lived long and safeguarded their father's manuscripts and letters, and produced editions of his works.\nInfluences.\nAs H. S. Harris recounts, when Hegel entered the T\u00fcbingen seminary in 1788, \"he was a typical product of the German Enlightenment \u2013 an enthusiastic reader of Rousseau and Lessing, acquainted with Kant (at least at second hand), but perhaps more deeply devoted to the classics than to any thing modern.\" During this early period of his life \"the Greeks \u2013 especially Plato \u2013 came first.\" Although he later elevated Aristotle above Plato, Hegel never abandoned his love of ancient philosophy, the imprint of which is everywhere in his thought.\nHegel's concern with various forms of cultural unity (Judaic, Greek, medieval, and modern) during this early period would remain with him throughout his career. In this way, he was also a typical product of early German Romanticism. \"Unity of life\" was the phrase used by Hegel and his generation to express their concept of the highest good. It encompasses unity \"with oneself, with others, and with nature. The main threat to such unity consists in division (\"Entzweiung\") or alienation (\"Entfremdung\").\"\nIn this respect, Hegel was particularly taken with the phenomenon of \"love\" as a kind of \"unity-in-difference,\" this both in the ancient articulation provided by Plato and in the Christian religion's doctrine of \"agape\", which Hegel at this time viewed as \"already 'grounded on universal Reason.'\" This interest, as well as his theological training, would continue to mark his thought, even as it developed in a more theoretical or metaphysical direction.\nAccording to Glenn Alexander Magee, Hegel's thought (in particular, the tripartite structure of his system) also owes much to the hermetic tradition, in particular, the work of Jakob B\u00f6hme. The conviction that philosophy must take the form of a system Hegel owed, most particularly, to his T\u00fcbingen roommates, Schelling and H\u00f6lderlin.\nHegel also read widely and was much influenced by Adam Smith and other theorists of the political economy.\nIt was Kant's critical philosophy that provided what Hegel took as the definitive modern articulation of the divisions that must be overcome. This led to his engagement with the philosophical programs of Fichte and Schelling, as well as his attention to Spinoza and the pantheism controversy. The influence of Johann Gottfried von Herder, however, would lead Hegel to a qualified rejection of the universality claimed by the Kantian program in favor of a more culturally, linguistically, and historically informed account of reason.\n\"The Phenomenology of Spirit\".\n\"The Phenomenology of Spirit\" was published in 1807. This is the first time that, at the age of thirty-six, Hegel lays out \"his own distinctive approach\" and adopts an \"outlook that is recognizably 'Hegelian' to the philosophical problems of post-Kantian philosophy\". Yet, the book was poorly understood even by Hegel's contemporaries and received mostly negative reviews. To this day, the \"Phenomenology\" is infamous for, among other things, its conceptual and allusive density, idiosyncratic terminology, and confusing transitions. Its most comprehensive commentary, scholar H. S. Harris's two-volume \"Hegel's Ladder\" (\"The Pilgrimage of Reason\" and \"The Odyssey of Spirit\"), runs more than three times the length of the text itself.\nThe fourth chapter of the \"Phenomenology\" includes Hegel's first presentation of the lord-bondsman dialectic, the section of the book that has been most influential in general culture. What is at stake in the conflict Hegel presents is the practical (not theoretical) recognition or acknowledgement [\"Anerkennung\", \"anerkennen\"] of the universality \u2013 i.e., personhood, humanity \u2013 of each of two opposed self-consciousnesses. What the readers learn, but what the self-consciousnesses described do not yet realize, is that recognition can only be successful and actual as reciprocal or mutual. This is the case for the simple reason that the recognition of someone you do not recognize as properly human cannot count as genuine recognition. Hegel can also be seen here as criticizing the individualist worldview of people and society as a collection of atomized individuals, instead taking a holistic view of human self-consciousness as requiring the recognition of others, and people's view of themselves as being shaped by the views of others.\nHegel describes the \"Phenomenology\" as both the \"introduction\" to his philosophical system and also as the \"first part\" of that system as the \"science of the experience of consciousness.\" Yet it has long been controversial in both respects; indeed, Hegel's own attitude changed throughout his life.\nNevertheless, however complicated the details, the basic strategy by which it attempts to make good on its introductory claim is not difficult to state. Beginning with only the most basic \"certainties of consciousness itself,\" \"the most immediate of which is the certainty that \"I\" am conscious of \"this\" object, \"here\" and \"now\",\" Hegel aims to show that these \"certainties of natural consciousness\" have as their consequence the standpoint of speculative logic.\nThis does not, however, make the \"Phenomenology\" a \"Bildungsroman\". It is not the consciousness under observation that learns from its experience. Only \"we,\" the phenomenological observers, are in a position to profit from Hegel's logical reconstruction of the science of experience.\nThe ensuing dialectic is long and hard. It is described by Hegel himself as a \"path of despair,\" in which self-consciousness finds itself to be, over and again, in error. It is the self-concept of consciousness itself that is tested in the domain of experience, and where that concept is not adequate, self-consciousness \"suffers this violence at its own hands, and brings to ruin its own restricted satisfaction.\" For, as Hegel points out, one cannot learn how to swim without getting into the water. By progressively testing its concept of knowledge in this way, by \"making experience his standard of knowledge, Hegel is embarking upon nothing less than a \"transcendental deduction\" of metaphysics.\"\nIn the course of its dialectic, the \"Phenomenology\" purports to demonstrate that \u2013 because consciousness always includes self-consciousness \u2013 there are no 'given' objects of direct awareness not already mediated by thought. Further analysis of the structure of self-consciousness reveals that both the social and conceptual stability of the experiential world depend upon networks of reciprocal recognition. Failures of recognition, then, demand reflection upon the past as a way \"to understand what is required of us at the present.\" For Hegel, this ultimately involves rethinking an interpretation of \"religion as the collective reflection of the modern community on what ultimately counts for it.\" He contends, finally, that this \"historically, socially construed philosophical account of that whole process\" elucidates the genesis of a distinctly \"modern\" standpoint.\nAnother way of putting this is to say that the \"Phenomenology\" takes up Kant's philosophical project of investigating the capacities and limits of reason. Under the influence of Herder, however, Hegel proceeds historically, instead of altogether a priori. Yet, although proceeding historically, Hegel resists the relativistic consequences of Herder's own thought. In the words of one scholar, \"It is Hegel's insight that reason itself has a history, that what counts as reason is the result of a development. This is something that Kant never imagines and that Herder only glimpses.\"\n\"The Phenomenology of Spirit\" shows that the search for an externally objective criterion of truth is a fool's errand. The constraints on knowledge are necessarily internal to spirit itself. Yet, although theories and self-conceptions may always be reevaluated, renegotiated, and revised, this is not a merely imaginative exercise. Claims to knowledge must always prove their own adequacy in real historical experience.\nAlthough Hegel seemed during his Berlin years to have abandoned \"The Phenomenology of Spirit\", at the time of his unexpected death, he was in fact making plans to revise and republish it. As Hegel was no longer in need of money or credentials, H. S. Harris argues that \"the only rational conclusion that can be drawn from his decision to republish the book\u2026 is that he still regarded the 'science of experience' as a valid project in itself\" and one for which later system has no equivalent. There is, however, no scholarly consensus about the \"Phenomenology\" with respect to either of the systematic roles asserted by Hegel at the time of its publication.\nPhilosophical system.\nHegel's philosophical system is divided into three parts: the science of logic, the philosophy of nature, and the philosophy of spirit (the latter two of which together constitute the real philosophy). This structure is adopted from Proclus's Neoplatonic triad of \"'remaining-procession-return' and from the Christian Trinity.\" Although evident in draft writings dating back as early as 1805, the system was not completed in published form until the 1817 \"Encyclopedia\" (1st ed.).\nHistorian of philosophy Frederick C. Beiser argues that the position of the logic with respect to the real philosophy is best understood in terms of Hegel's appropriation of Aristotle's distinction between \"the order of explanation\" and \"the order of being.\" To Beiser, Hegel is neither a Platonist who believes in abstract logical entities, nor a nominalist according to whom the particular is first in the orders of explanation and being alike. Rather, Hegel is a holist. For Hegel, the universal is always first in the order of explanation even if what is naturally particular is first in the order of being. With respect to the system as a whole, that universal is supplied by the logic.\nScholar Michael J. Inwood states, \"The logical idea is non-temporal and therefore does not exist at any time apart from its manifestations.\" To ask \"when\" it divides into nature and spirit is analogous to asking \"when\" 12 divides into 5 and 7. The question does not have an answer because it is predicated upon a fundamental misunderstanding of its terms. The task of the logic (at this high systemic level) is to articulate what Hegel calls \"the identity of identity and non-identity\" of nature and spirit. Put another way, it aims to overcome subject-object dualism. This is to say that, among other things, Hegel's philosophical project endeavors to provide the metaphysical basis for an account of spirit that is continuous with, yet distinct from, the \"merely\" natural world \u2013 without thereby reducing either term to the other.\nFurthermore, the final sections of Hegel's \"Encyclopedia\" suggest that to give priority to any one of its three parts is to have an interpretation that is \"one-sided,\" incomplete or otherwise inaccurate. As Hegel declares, \"The true is the whole.\"\n\"Science of Logic\".\nHegel's concept of logic differs greatly from that of the ordinary English sense of the term. This can be seen, for instance, in such metaphysical definitions of logic as \"the science of \"things\" grasped in [the] \"thoughts\" that used to be taken to express the \"essentialities\" of the \"things\".\" As explains, Hegel's logic is a continuation of Kant's distinctive logical program. Its occasional engagement with the familiar Aristotelian conception of logic is only incidental to Hegel's project. Twentieth-century developments by such logicians as Frege and Russell likewise remain logics of formal validity and so are likewise irrelevant to Hegel's project, which aspires to provide a metaphysical logic of truth.\nThere are two texts of Hegel's \"Logic\". The first, \"The Science of Logic\" (1812, 1813, 1816; bk.I revised 1831), is sometimes also called the \"Greater Logic.\" The second is the first volume of Hegel's \"Encyclopedia\" and is sometimes known as the \"Lesser Logic.\" The \"Encyclopedia\" Logic is an abbreviated or condensed presentation of the same dialectic. Hegel composed it for use with students in the lecture hall, not as a substitute for its proper, book-length exposition.\nHegel presents logic as a presuppositionless science that investigates the most fundamental thought-determinations [\"Denkbestimmungen\"], or categories, and so constitutes the basis of philosophy. In putting something into question, one already presupposes logic; in this regard, it is the only field of inquiry that must constantly reflect upon its own mode of functioning. \"The Science of Logic\" is Hegel's attempt to meet this foundational demand. As he puts it, \"\"logic\" coincides with \"metaphysics\".\" In the words of scholar Glenn Alexander Magee, the logic provides \"an account of pure categories or ideas which are timelessly true\" and which make up \"the formal structure of reality itself\".\nThis is not, however, a return to the Leibnizian-Wolffian rationalism critiqued by Kant, which is a criticism Hegel accepts. Hegel rejects any form of metaphysics as speculation about the transcendent. His procedure, an appropriation of Aristotle's concept of form, is fully immanent. More generally, Hegel agrees with Kant's rejection of all forms of dogmatism and also agrees that any future metaphysics must pass the test of criticism.\nPhilosopher B\u00e9atrice Longuenesse holds that this project may be understood, on analogy to Kant, as \"inseparably a metaphysical and a transcendental deduction of the categories of metaphysics.\" This approach insists, and claims to demonstrate, that the insights of logic cannot be judged by standards external to thought itself, that is, that \"thought... is not the mirror of nature.\" Yet, she argues, this does not imply that these standards are arbitrary or subjective. Hegel's translator and scholar of German idealism George di Giovanni likewise interprets the \"Logic\" as (drawing upon, yet also in opposition to, Kant) \"immanently\" transcendental; its categories, according to Hegel, are built into \"life itself\", and define what it is to be \"an object in general.\"\nBooks one and two of the \"Logic\" are the doctrines of \"Being\" and \"Essence.\" Together they comprise the Objective Logic, which is largely occupied with overcoming the assumptions of traditional metaphysics. Book three is the final part of the \"Logic\". It discusses the doctrine of \"the Concept,\" which is concerned with reintegrating those categories of objectivity into a thoroughly idealistic account of reality. Simplifying greatly, Being describes its concepts just as they appear, Essence attempts to explain them with reference to opposites, and the Concept explains and unites them both in terms of an internal teleology. The categories of Being \"pass over\" from one to the next as denoting thought-determinations only extrinsically connected to one another. The categories of Essence reciprocally \"shine\" into one another. Finally, in the Concept, thought has shown itself to be fully self-referential, and so its categories organically \"develop\" from one to the next.\nIn Hegel's technical sense of the term, the concept (\"Begriff\", sometimes also rendered \"notion,\" capitalized by some translators but not others) is not a psychological concept. When deployed with the definitive article (\"the\") and sometimes modified by the term \"logical,\" Hegel is referring to the intelligible structure of reality as articulated in the Subjective Logic. (When used in the plural, however, Hegel's sense is much closer to the ordinary dictionary sense of the term.)\nHegel's inquiry into thought is concerned to systematize thought's own internal self-differentiation, that is, how pure concepts (logical categories) differ from one another in their various relations of implication and interdependence. For instance, in the opening dialectic of the \"Logic\", Hegel claims to display that the thought of \"\"being, pure being\" \u2013 without further determination\" is indistinguishable from the concept of \"nothing\", and that, in this \"passing back and forth\" of being and nothing, \"\"each\" immediately \"vanishes in its opposite.\"\" This movement is neither one concept nor the other, but the category of \"becoming\". There is not a difference here to which one can \"refer,\" only a dialectic that one can observe and describe.\nThe final category of the \"Logic\" is \"the idea.\" As with \"the concept\", the sense of this term for Hegel is not psychological. Rather, following Kant in \"The Critique of Pure Reason\", Hegel's usage harks back to the Greek \"eidos\", Plato's concept of form that is fully existent and universal: \"Hegel's \"Idee\" (like Plato's idea) is the product of an attempt to fuse ontology, epistemology, evaluation, etc., into a single set of concepts.\"\nThe \"Logic\" accommodates within itself the necessity of the realm of natural-spiritual \"contingency\", that which cannot be determined in advance: \"To go further, it must abandon thinking altogether and let itself go, opening itself to that which is other than thought in pure receptivity.\" Simply put, logic realizes itself only in the domain of nature and spirit, in which it attains its \"verification.\" Hence the conclusion of the \"Science of Logic\" with \"the idea \"freely discharging\" [entl\u00e4\u00dft] itself\" into \"objectivity and external life\" \u2013 and, so too, the systematic transition to the \"Realphilosophie\".\nPhilosophy of the real.\nIn contrast to the first, logical part of Hegel's system, the second, real-philosophical part \u2013 the philosophy of nature and of spirit \u2013 is an ongoing project with respect to its historical content, which continues to change and develop. For instance, although Hegel regards \"the basic structure\" of the philosophy of nature as complete, he was \"aware that science is not 'finished' and will continue to make new discoveries\". Philosophy is, as Hegel puts it, \"\"its own time comprehended in thoughts\".\"\nHe expands upon this definition:\nA further word on the subject of \"issuing instructions\" on how the world ought to be: philosophy, at any rate, always comes too late to perform this function. As the \"thought\" of the world, it appears only at a time when actuality has gone through its formative process and attained its completed state [\"sich fertig gemacht\"]. This lesson of the concept is necessarily also apparent from history, namely that it is only when actuality [\"Wirklichkeit\"] has reached maturity that the ideal appears opposite the real and reconstructs this real world, which it has grasped in its substance, in the shape of an intellectual realm. When philosophy paints its gray in gray, a shape of life has grown old, and it cannot be rejuvenated, but only recognized, by the gray in gray of philosophy; the owl of Minerva begins its flight only with the onset of dusk.\nThis frequently has been read as an expression of the impotence of philosophy, political or otherwise, and a rationalization of the status quo. Scholar Allegra de Laurentiis, however, points out that the German expression \"sich fertig machen\", translated as \"getting ready\" or \"to get ready\", does not only imply completion, but also preparedness. This additional meaning is important because it better reflects Hegel's Aristotelian concept of actuality. He characterizes actuality as being-at-work-staying-itself that can never be once-and-for-all completed or finished.\nHegel describes the relationship between the logical and the real-philosophical parts of his system in this way: \"If philosophy does not stand above its time in content, it does so in form, because, as the thought and knowledge of that which is the substantial spirit of its time, it makes that spirit its object.\"\nThis is to say that what makes the philosophy of the real \"scientific\" in Hegel's technical sense is the systematically coherent logical form it uncovers in its natural-historical material \u2013 and so also displays in its presentation.\n\"The Philosophy of Nature\".\nThe philosophy of nature organizes the contingent material of the natural sciences systematically. As part of the philosophy of the real, in no way does it presume to \"tell nature what it must be like.\" Historically, various interpreters have questioned Hegel's understanding of the natural sciences of his time. However, this claim has been largely refuted by recent scholarship.\nOne of the very few ways in which the philosophy of nature might correct claims made by the natural sciences themselves is to combat reductive explanations; that is, to discredit accounts employing categories not adequate to the complexity of the phenomena they purport to explain, as for instance, attempting to explain life in strictly chemical terms.\nAlthough Hegel and other \"Naturphilosophen\" aim to revive a teleological understanding of nature, they argue that their strictly \"internal\" or \"immanent\" concept of teleology is \"limited to the ends observable within nature itself.\" Hence, they claim, it does not violate the Kantian critique. Even more strongly, Hegel and Schelling claim that Kant's restriction of teleology to regulative status effectively undermines his own critical project of explaining the possibility of knowledge. Their argument is that \"only under the assumption that \"there is\" an organism is it possible to explain the \"actual interaction\" between the subjective and the objective, the ideal and the real.\" Hence, the organism must be acknowledged to have constitutive status.\nIntroducing Hegel's philosophy of nature for a 21st-century audience, Dieter Wandschneider observes that \"contemporary philosophy of science\" has lost sight of \"the ontological issue at stake, namely, the question of an intrinsically lawful nature\": \"Consider, for example, the problem of what constitutes a law of nature. This problem is central to our understanding of nature. Yet philosophy of science has not provided a definitive response to it up to now. Nor can we expect to have such an answer from that quarter in future.\" It is back to Hegel that Wandschneider would direct philosophers of science for guidance in the philosophy of nature.\nRecent scholars have also argued that Hegel's approach to the philosophy of nature provides valuable resources for theorizing and confronting recent environmental challenges entirely unforeseen by Hegel. These philosophers point to such aspects of his philosophy as its distinctive metaphysical grounding and the continuity of its conception of the nature-spirit relationship.\n\"The Philosophy of Spirit\".\nThe German \"Geist\" has a wide range of meanings. In its most general Hegelian sense, however, \"\"Geist\" denotes the human mind and its products, in contrast to nature and also the logical idea.\" (Some older translations render it as \"mind,\" rather than \"spirit.\")\nAs is especially evident in the Anthropology, Hegel's concept of spirit is an appropriation and transformation of the self-referential Aristotelian concept of \"energeia\". Spirit is not something above or otherwise external to nature. It is \"the highest organization and development\" of nature's powers.\nAccording to Hegel, \"the \"essence\" of spirit is \"freedom\".\" The \"Encyclopedia\" Philosophy of Spirit charts the progressively determinate stages of this freedom until spirit fulfills the Delphic imperative with which Hegel begins: \"\"Know thyself\".\"\nAs becomes clear, Hegel's concept of freedom is not (or not merely) the capacity for arbitrary choice, but has as its \"core notion\" that \"something, especially a person, is free if and only if, it is independent and self-determining, not determined by or dependent upon something other than itself.\" It is, in other words, (at least predominantly, dialectically) an account of what Isaiah Berlin would later term positive liberty.\nSubjective spirit.\nStanding at the transition from nature to spirit, the role of the Philosophy of Subjective Spirit is to analyze \"the elements necessary for or presupposed by such relations [of objective spirit], namely, the structures characteristic of and necessary to the individual rational agent.\" It does this by elaborating \"the fundamental nature of the biological/spiritual human individual along with the cognitive and the practical prerequisites of human social interaction.\"\nThis section, particularly its first part, contains various comments that were commonplace in Hegel's day and can now be recognized as openly racist, such as unfounded claims about the \"naturally\" lower intellectual and emotional development of Black people. In his perspective, these racial differences are related to \"climate\": according to Hegel, it is not racial characteristics, but the climactic conditions in which a people lives that variously limit or enable its capacity for free self-determination. He believes that race is not destiny: any group could, in principle, improve and transform its condition by migrating to friendlier climes.\nHegel divides his philosophy of the subjective spirit into three parts: anthropology, phenomenology, and psychology. Anthropology \"deals with 'soul', which is spirit still mired in nature: all that within us which precedes our self-conscious mind or intellect.\" In the section \"Phenomenology\", Hegel examines the relation between consciousness and its object and the emergence of intersubjective rationality. Psychology \"deals with a great deal that would be categorized as epistemology (or 'theory of knowledge') today. Hegel discusses, among other things, the nature of attention, memory, imagination and judgement.\"\nThroughout this section, but especially in the Anthropology, Hegel appropriates and develops Aristotle's hylomorphic approach to what is today theorized as the mind\u2013body problem: \"The solution to the mind\u2013body problem [according to this theory] hinges upon recognizing that mind does not act upon the body as cause of effects but rather acts upon itself as an embodied living subjectivity. As such, mind develops itself, progressively attaining more and more of a self-determined character.\"\nIts final section, Free Spirit, develops the concept of \"free will\", which is foundational for Hegel's philosophy of right.\nObjective spirit.\nIn the broadest terms, Hegel's philosophy of objective spirit \"is his social philosophy, his philosophy of how the human spirit objectifies itself in its social and historical activities and productions.\" Or, put differently, it is an account of the institutionalization of freedom. Besier declares this a rare instance of unanimity in Hegel scholarship: \"all scholars agree there is no more important concept in Hegel's political theory than freedom.\" This is because it is the foundation of right, the essence of spirit, and the \"telos\" of history.\nThis part of Hegel's philosophy is presented first in his 1817 \"Encyclopedia\" (revised 1827 and 1830) and then at greater length in the 1821 \"Elements of the Philosophy of Right, or Natural Law and Political Science in Outline\" (like the \"Encyclopedia\", intended as a textbook), upon which he also frequently lectured. Its final part, the philosophy of world history, was additionally elaborated in Hegel's lectures on the subject.\nHegel's \"Elements of the Philosophy of Right\" has been controversial from the date of its original publication. It is not, however, a straightforward defense of the autocratic Prussian state, as some have alleged, but is rather a defense of \"Prussia as it was to have become under [proposed] reform administrations.\"\nThe German \"Recht\" in Hegel's title does not have a direct English equivalent (though it does correspond to the Latin \"ius\" and the French \"droit\"). As a first approximation, Michael Inwood distinguishes three senses:\nBeiser observes that Hegel's theory is \"his attempt to rehabilitate the natural law tradition while taking into account the criticisms of the historical school.\" He adds that \"without a sound interpretation of Hegel's theory of natural law, we have very little understanding of the very foundation of his social and political thought.\" Consistent with Beiser's position, scholar Adriaan T. Peperzak documents Hegel's arguments against social contract theory and stresses the metaphysical foundations of Hegel's philosophy of right.\nObserving that \"analyzing the structure of Hegel's argument in the \"Philosophy of Right\" shows that achieving political autonomy is fundamental to Hegel's analysis of the state and government,\" philosopher Kenneth R. Westphal provides this brief outline:\nHegel describes the state of his time, a constitutional monarchy, as rationally embodying three cooperative and mutually inclusive elements. These elements are \"democracy (rule of the many, who are involved in legislation), aristocracy (rule of the few, who apply, concretize, and execute the laws), and monarchy (rule of the one, who heads and encompasses all power).\" It is what Aristotle called a \"mixed\" form of government, which is designed to include what is best of each of the three classical forms. The division of powers \"prevents an single power from dominating others.\" Hegel is particularly concerned to bind the monarch to the constitution, limiting his authority so that he can do little more than to declare of what his ministers have already decided that it is to be so.\nThe relation of Hegel's philosophy of right to modern liberalism is complex. He sees liberalism as a valuable and characteristic expression of the modern world. However, it carries the danger within itself to undermine its own values. This self-destructive tendency may be avoided by measuring \"the subjective goals of individuals by a larger objective and collective good.\" Moral values, then, have only a \"limited place in the total scheme of things.\" Yet, although it is not without reason that Hegel is widely regarded as a major proponent of what Isaiah Berlin would later term positive liberty, he was just as \"unwavering and unequivocal\" in his defense of negative liberty.\nIf Hegel's ideal sovereign is much weaker than was typical in monarchies his time, so too is his democratic element much weaker than is typical in democracies of modern times. Although he insists upon the importance of public participation, Hegel severely limits suffrage and follows the English bicameral model, in which only members of the lower house, that of commoners and bourgeoisie, are elected officials. Nobles in the upper house, like the monarch, inherit their positions.\nThe final part of the Philosophy of Objective Spirit is entitled \"World History.\" In this section, Hegel argues that \"this immanent principle [the Stoic \"logos\"] produces with logical inevitability an expansion of the species' capacities for self determination ('freedom') and a deepening of its self understanding ('self-knowing').\" In Hegel's own words: \"World history is progress in the consciousness of freedom \u2013 a progress that we must comprehend conceptually.\"\nAbsolute spirit.\nHegel's use of the term \"absolute\" is easily misunderstood. Inwood, however, clarifies: derived from the Latin \"absolutus\", it means \"not dependent on, conditional on, relative to or restricted by anything else; self-contained, perfect, complete.\" For Hegel, this means that absolute knowing can only denote \"an 'absolute relation' in which the ground of experience and the experiencing agent are one and the same: the object known is explicitly the subject who knows.\" That is, the only \"thing\" (which is really an activity) that is truly absolute is that which is entirely self-conditioned, and, according to Hegel, this only occurs when spirit takes itself up as its own object. The final section of his Philosophy of Spirit presents the three modes of such absolute knowing: art, religion, and philosophy.\nIt is with reference to different modalities of consciousness \u2013 intuition, representation, and comprehending thinking \u2013 that Hegel distinguishes the three modes of absolute knowing. Frederick Beiser summarizes: \"art, religion and philosophy all have the same object, the absolute or truth itself; but they consist in different forms of knowledge of it. Art presents the absolute in the form of immediate intuition (\"Anschauung\"); religion presents it in the form of representation (\"Vorstellung\"); and philosophy presents it in the form of concepts (\"Begriffe\").\"\nThe German philosopher R\u00fcdiger Bubner additionally clarifies that the increase in conceptual transparency according to which these spheres are systematically ordered is not hierarchical in any evaluative sense.\nAlthough Hegel's discussion of absolute spirit in the \"Encyclopedia\" is quite brief, he develops his account at length in lectures on the philosophy of fine art, the philosophy of religion, and the history of philosophy.\nPhilosophy of art.\nIn the \"Phenomenology\", and even in the 1817 edition of the \"Encyclopedia\", Hegel discusses art only as it figures in what he terms the \"Art-Religion\" of the ancient Greeks. In 1818, however, Hegel begins lecturing on the philosophy of art as an explicitly autonomous domain.\nAlthough H. G. Hotho titled his edition of the Lectures \"Vorlesungen \u00fcber die \u00c4sthetik\" [\"Lectures on Aesthetics\"], Hegel directly states that his topic is not \"the spacious realm of the beautiful,\" but \"art, or, rather, fine art.\" He doubles down on this in the next paragraph by explicitly distinguishing his project from the broader philosophical projects pursued under the heading of \"aesthetics\" by Christian Wolff and Alexander Gottlieb Baumgarten.\nSome critics \u2013 most canonically, Benedetto Croce, in 1907 \u2013 have attributed to Hegel some form of the thesis that art is \"dead.\" Hegel, however, never said any such thing, nor can such a view be plausibly attributed to him. Indeed, one commentator places that debate in perspective with the observation that Hegel's claim that \"art no longer serves our highest aims\" is \"radical not for the suggestion that art now fails to do so but for the suggestion that it ever did.\"\nHegel's detailed and systematic treatment of the various arts over such a great span has even led art historian Ernst Gombrich to present Hegel as \"the father of art history.\" For most of their history, Hegel's \"Lectures\" were largely ignored by philosophers and received most of their attention from literary critics and art historians.\nThe more narrowly conceptual project of the philosophy of art, however, is to articulate and defend \"the \"autonomy\" of art, making possible an account of the \"special individuality\" distinguishing works of aesthetic worth.\"\nAccording to Hegel, \"'artistic beauty reveals absolute truth through perception.' He holds that the best art conveys metaphysical knowledge by revealing, through sense perception, what is unconditionally true,'\" that is, \"what his metaphysical theory affirms to be unconditional or absolute.\" So, while Hegel \"ennobles art insofar as it conveys metaphysical knowledge,\" \"he tempers his assessment in view of his belief that art's sensory media can never adequately convey what completely transcends the contingency of sensation.\" This is why, according to Hegel, art can only be one of three mutually complementary modes of absolute spirit.\nChristianity.\nAlthough his understanding of Christianity evolved over time, Hegel identified as a Lutheran his entire life. One constant was his profound appreciation for the Christian insight into the intrinsic worth and freedom of every individual.\nEarly Romantic writings.\nHegel's earliest writings on Christianity date between 1783 and 1800. He was still working out his ideas at this time, and everything from this period was abandoned as fragments or unfinished drafts. Hegel was very much dissatisfied with the dogmatism and positivity of the Christian religion, to which he opposed the spontaneous religion of the Greeks. In \"The Spirit of Christianity\", he proposes a sort of resolution by aligning the universality of Kantian moral philosophy with the universality of the teachings of Jesus; in paraphrase: \"The moral principle of the Gospel is charity, or love, and love is the beauty of the heart, a spiritual beauty which combines the Greek Soul and Kant's Moral Reason.\" Although he did not return to this Romantic formulation, the unification of Greek and Christian thought would remain a preoccupation throughout his life.\n\"The Phenomenology of Spirit\".\nReligion is a major theme throughout the 1807 \"Phenomenology of Spirit\" well before it emerges as the explicit topic of the penultimate Religion chapter. This is seen most directly in the metaphysical \"unhappiness\" of the Augustinian consciousness in chapter IV and in Hegel's depiction of the struggle of the Church of the Faithful with Enlightenment \"philosophes\" in chapter VI.\nHegel's proper account of Christianity, however, is to be found in the final section of the \"Phenomenology\" just prior to the closing chapter, Absolute Knowing. It is presented under the heading The Revelatory Religion [\"die offenbare Religion\"]. By means of philosophical exposition of Christian doctrines such as Incarnation and Resurrection, Hegel claims to demonstrate or to make \"manifest\" the conceptual truth of Christianity, and so to overcome what has only been positively revealed [\"ge\u00f6ffenbarte\"] by explication of its underlying, revelatory truth.\nThe heart of Hegel's interpretation of Christianity can be seen in his interpretation of the Trinity. God the Father must give Himself existence as finitely human Son, the death of whom discloses His essential being as Spirit \u2013 and, crucially, according to Hegel, his [Hegel's] own philosophical \"concept\" of spirit makes transparent what is only obscurely \"represented\" in the Christian concept of the Trinity. And so it makes manifest the philosophical \"truth\" of religion, which now is \"known\".\nIn an essay on the \"Phenomenology\", George di Giovanni contrasts Kant's rational faith with Hegel's rational religion. On his view, the modern role of religion consists in \"expressing and nurturing spirit in its most individual forms\" rather than in explaining reality. There is no longer any place for faith in opposition to knowledge. Instead, faith assumes such forms as the trust placed \"in individuals close to us, or in the time and place in which we happen to live.\"\nIn other words, according to Hegel's philosophical interpretation, Christianity does not require faith in any doctrine that is not fully justified by reason. What is left, then, is the religious community, free to minister to individual needs and to celebrate the absolute freedom of spirit.\nThe Berlin lectures.\nHegel's \"Encyclopedia\" includes a section on the Revealed Religion, but it is quite short. It is his Berlin Lectures that contain his next presentation of Christianity, which he variously refers to as the \"consummate\", \"absolute\", or \"revelatory\" religion (all equivalent terms in this context). Transcripts of three of Hegel's four courses have been preserved, and they show him to be continually adjusting his emphases and exposition. The interpretation of Christianity that he advances, however, is still very much that which he presented in the \"Phenomenology\" \u2013 only now he is able to expound at greater length and with greater clarity upon what he had covered earlier in such a condensed fashion.\nIssues of interpretation.\nWalter Jaeschke questions whether Luther would have recognized Hegel's claim to Protestantism. Hegel embraces the doctrine of the priesthood of all believers with his concept of spirit, but rejects the core Lutheran doctrines of \"sola gratia\" and \"sola scriptura\". Instead, he affirms as the \"fundamental principle\" of Protestantism \"the obstinacy that does honor to mankind, to refuse to recognize in conviction anything not ratified by thought.\" On similar grounds, Frederick Beiser, while acknowledging Hegel's apparently sincere profession of Lutheranism, describes Hegel's theology as effectively \"the very opposite of Luther's.\"\nDiscussing the \"Hegel Renaissance\" in late 20th-century Anglo-American philosophy, Beiser expresses surprise \u2013 given today's highly secular academic culture \u2013 at such a surge of interest in Hegel. For, according to Hegel, the divine is the centerpoint of philosophy. Hegel's concept of God differs from theistic conceptions found in orthodox Christianity and from deistic conceptions suggested by eighteenth-century philosophers. Nonetheless, Hegel conceptualizes God as the infinite or absolute, in agreement with the classical definition given by St. Anselm as \"that of which nothing greater can be conceived.\"\nJust how to most properly characterize Hegel's distinctive articulation of Christianity was a matter of intense debate even in his own life and, among his students, after his death. So it is likely to remain. Neither theistic, nor deistic, Hegel's god can only be articulated in the philosophical terms of the concept of spirit or his own distinctive logical vocabulary. Nevertheless, Hegel everywhere insists that his is the Christian God.\nPhilosophy of history.\n\"History\", Frederick Beiser writes, \"is central to Hegel's conception of philosophy\". Philosophy is only possible \"if it is historical, only if the philosopher is aware of the origins, context, and development of his doctrines.\" In this 1993 essay \"Hegel's Historicism\", Beiser declares this to be \"nothing less than a revolution in the history of philosophy.\" In a 2011 monograph, however, Beiser excludes Hegel from his treatment of the German historicist tradition for the reason that Hegel is more interested in the philosophy of history than in the epistemological project of justifying its status as a science. Moreover, against the relativistic implications of historicism narrowly construed, Hegel's metaphysics of spirit supplies a \"telos\", internal to history itself, in terms of which progress can be measured and assessed. This is the self-consciousness of freedom. The more that awareness of this essential freedom of spirit permeates a culture, the more advanced Hegel claims it to be.\nBecause freedom, according to Hegel, is the essence of spirit, the developing self-awareness of this is just as much a development in truth as it is in political life. Thinking presupposes an \"instinctive belief\" in truth, and the history of philosophy, as recounted by Hegel, is a progressive sequence of \"system-identifying\" concepts of truth.\nWhether or not Hegel is a historicist simply depends upon how one defines the term. The importance of history in Hegel's philosophy, however, cannot be denied.\nGerman has two words for \"history\", \"Historie\" and \"Geschichte\". The first refers to \"the narrative organization of empirical material\". The second \"includes an account of the underlying developmental logic (the 'intrinsic ground') of deeds and events\". Only the latter procedure can supply a properly universal or philosophical history, and this is the procedure Hegel adopts in all of his historical writings. According to Hegel, humans are distinctly historical creatures because, not only do they exist in time, they also internalize temporal events so that they become, in a profound sense, part of what and who people are, \"integral to humanity's self-understanding and self-knowledge.\" This is why the history of philosophy, for instance, is integral to philosophy itself, it being literally impossible for early philosophers to think what later philosophers, afforded all the riches of their predecessors, could think \u2013 and perhaps, with this distance, work through more thoroughly or consistently. From a later perspective, for instance, it becomes apparent that the concept of personhood includes the implication of universality such as renders contradictory any interpretation or implementation that extends it to some people, but not to others.\nIn the Introduction to his \"Lectures on the Philosophy of World History\", simplifying his own account, Hegel divides human history into three epochs. In what he calls the \"Oriental\" world, \"one\" person (the pharaoh or emperor) was free. In the Greco-Roman world, \"some\" people (moneyed citizens) were free. In the \"Germanic\" world (that is, European Christendom) \"all\" persons are free.\nIn his discussion of the ancient world, Hegel provides a heavily qualified defense of slavery. As he puts it elsewhere, \"slavery occurs in a transitional phase between the natural human existence and the truly ethical condition; it occurs in a world where a wrong is still right. Here, the wrong \"is valid\", so that the position it occupies is a necessary one.\" Hegel is clear, however, that there is an unconditional moral demand to reject the institution of slavery, and that slavery is incompatible with the rational state and the essential freedom of every individual.\nSome commentators \u2013 most notably, Alexandre Koj\u00e8ve and Francis Fukuyama \u2013 have understood Hegel to claim that, having achieved a fully universal concept of freedom, history is complete, that it has reached its conclusion. Against this, however, it can be objected that freedom may yet be expanded in terms both of its \"scope\" and its \"content\". Since Hegel's day, the scope of the concept of freedom has been expanded to acknowledge the rightful inclusion of women, formerly enslaved or colonized peoples, the mentally ill, and those who do not conform to conservative norms with respect to sexual preference or gender identity, among others. As to the content of freedom, the United Nations' International Bill of Human Rights (for example)_ expands the concept of freedom beyond what Hegel himself articulates. Additionally, although Hegel consistently presents his philosophical histories as East-to-West narratives, scholars such as J. M. Fritzman argue that, not only is this prejudice quite incidental to the substance of Hegel's philosophical position, but that \u2013 with India now the world's largest democracy, for instance, or with South Africa's mighty efforts to transcend apartheid \u2013 the movement of freedom back to the East may already have begun.\nDialectics, speculation, idealism.\nHegel is often credited with proceeding according to a \"dialectical method\"; in point of fact, however, Hegel characterizes his philosophy as \"speculative\" (\"spekulativ\"), rather than dialectical, and uses the term \"dialectical\" only \"quite rarely\". This is because, although \"\"Dialektik\" sometimes stands for the entire movement of the self-articulation of meaning or thought, this term refers more specifically to the self-negation of the determinations of the understanding (\"Verstand\"), when they are thought through in their fixedness and opposition.\"\nBy contrast, \"Hegel describes correct thinking as the methodical interplay of three moments[:] \n(a) abstract and intellectual (\"verst\u00e4ndig\"), \n(b) dialectical or negatively rational (\"negativvern\u00fcnftig\"), and \n(c) speculative or positively rational (\"positivvern\u00fcnftig\").\"\nFor example, self-consciousness is \"the concept that consciousness has of itself. Thus in this case concept and referent coincide:... 'self-consciousness' refers to mind's taking on the self-contradictory (and thus also self-negating) role of being subject and object of one and the same act of cognition \u2013 simultaneously and in the same respect.\" Hence it is a speculative concept.\nAccording to Beiser, \"if Hegel has any methodology at all, it appears to be an anti-methodology, a method to suspend all methods.\" Hegel's term \"dialectic\" must be understood with reference to the \"concept\" of the object of investigation. What must be grasped is \"the 'self-organization' of the subject matter, its 'inner necessity' and 'inherent movement.'\" Hegel renounces all external methods such as could be \"applied\" to some subject matter.\nThe dialectical character of Hegel's speculative procedure often makes his position on any given issue quite difficult to characterize. Instead of seeking to answer a question or solve a problem directly, he frequently recasts it by showing, for instance, \"how the dichotomy underlying the dispute is false, and that it is therefore possible to integrate elements from both positions.\" Speculative thought preserves what is true from apparently opposing theories in a process that Hegel terms \"sublation\".\nTo \"sublate\" (\"aufheben\") has three main senses:\nHegel generally uses the term in all three senses, with particular emphasis on the second and third, in which apparent contradictions are speculatively overcome. His word for what is sublated is \"moment\" (\"das Moment\", in the neuter), which denotes \"an essential feature or aspect of a whole conceived as a static system, and an essential phase in a whole conceived as a dialectical movement or process.\" (When Hegel describes something as \"contradictory,\" what he means is that it is not independently self-sustaining on its own terms, and so it can only be comprehended [\"begreifen\"] as a moment of a larger whole.)\nAccording to Hegel, to think of the finite as a moment of the whole, rather than an independently self-determined existent, is what it means to grasp it as idealized (\"das Ideelle\"). Idealism, then, \"is the doctrine that finite entities are ideal (\"ideell\"): they depend not on themselves for their existence but on some larger self-sustaining entity [i.e., the whole] that underlies or embraces them.\"\nThe pronoun-expressions \u2013 moment, sublate, and idealize \u2013 are characteristic of Hegel's account of idealism. They can be understood as stages of thought in which the \"object is conceptually present first in mere adumbration, then according to circumstances both internal and external to it, and finally standing completely on its own.\" This phenomenological and conceptual analysis distinguishes Hegel's idealism from Kant's transcendental idealism and Berkeley's mentalistic idealism. In contrast to those positions, Hegel's idealism is entirely compatible with realism and non-mechanistic naturalism. This position rejects empiricism as an a priori account of knowledge, but it is in no way opposed to the philosophical legitimacy of empirical knowledge. Hegel's idealistic contention, which he claims to demonstrate, is that \"being itself\" is rational.\nAlthough it is not incorrect to refer to Hegel's philosophy as \"absolute idealism\", this term was at the time more associated with Schelling, and Hegel himself is documented as employing it with reference to his own philosophy only three times.\nAccording to Hegel, \"every philosophy is essentially idealism.\" This claim is based on the assumption, which Hegel claims to demonstrate, that conceptualization is present at all cognitive levels. For to completely deny this would undermine trust in the conceptual capacities necessary for objective knowledge\u2014and so would lead to total skepticism. Hence, according to Robert Stern, Hegel's idealism, \"amounts to a form of \"conceptual realism\", understood as 'the belief that concepts are part of the structure of reality.'\"\nThesis\u2013antithesis\u2013synthesis.\nThis terminology, largely developed earlier by Fichte, was spread by Heinrich Moritz Chalyb\u00e4us in accounts of Hegel's philosophy that have since been broadly discredited. Walter Kaufmann, for instance, reports:\nFichte introduced into German philosophy the three-step of thesis, antithesis, and synthesis, using these three terms. Schelling took up this terminology. \"Hegel did not.\" He never once used these three terms together to designate three stages in an argument or account in any of his books. And they do not help us understand his \"Phenomenology\", his \"Logic\", or his philosophy of history; they impede any open-minded comprehension of what he does by forcing it into a scheme which was available to him and which he deliberately spurned.\nMore modestly, it has been said that this account is \"only a partial comprehension that requires correction\". What it gets right is that, according to Hegel, \"truth emerges from error\" in the course of historical development in a way that implies a \"holism in which partial truths are progressively corrected so that their one-sidedness is overcome.\" What it distorts is that such a description is possible only after the process has unfolded. The \"thesis\" and \"antithesis\" are not \"alien\" to one another. Inasmuch as there can be said to be such a \"dialectical method,\" it is not an external one such as could be \"applied\" to some subject matter.\nSimilarly, Stephen Houlgate argues that, in whatever limited sense Hegel might be said to have a \"method\", it is a strictly \"immanent\" method; that is, it emerges from thoughtful immersion in the subject-matter itself. If this leads to dialectics, that is only because there is a contradiction in the object itself, not because of any external methodological procedure.\nLegacy.\nHegel's influence on subsequent philosophical developments has been enormous. In late nineteenth- and early twentieth-century England, a school known as British idealism propounded a version of absolute idealism through direct engagement with Hegel's texts. Prominent members included J. M. E. McTaggart, R. G. Collingwood, and G. R. G. Mure. Separately, some philosophers such as Marx, Dewey, Derrida, Adorno, and Gadamer have selectively developed Hegelian ideas into their own philosophical programs. Others have developed their positions in opposition to Hegel's system. These include, for instance, such diverse philosophers as Schopenhauer, Kierkegaard, Russell, G. E. Moore, and Foucault. In theology, Hegel's influence marks the work of Karl Barth and Dietrich Bonhoeffer. These names, however, constitute only a small sample of some of the more important figures who have developed their thought in engagement with the philosophy of Hegel.\n\"Right\" vs. \"Left\" Hegelianism.\nSome historians present Hegel's early influence in Germanic philosophy as divided into two opposing camps, right and left. The Right Hegelians, the allegedly direct disciples of Hegel at the Friedrich-Wilhelms-Universit\u00e4t, advocated a Protestant orthodoxy and the political conservatism of the post-Napoleon Restoration period. The Left Hegelians, also known as the Young Hegelians, interpreted Hegel in a revolutionary sense, leading to an advocation of atheism in religion and liberal democracy in politics. Recent studies, however, have questioned this paradigm.\nThe Right Hegelians \"were quickly forgotten\" and \"are today mainly known only to specialists\"; the Left Hegelians, by contrast, \"included some of the most important thinkers of the period,\" and \"through their emphasis on practice, some of these thinkers have remained exceedingly influential,\" primarily through the Marxist tradition.\nAmong the first followers to take an expressly critical view of Hegel's system were those in the 19th-century German group known as the Young Hegelians, which included Feuerbach, Marx, Engels, and their followers. The primary thrust of their criticism is concisely expressed in the eleventh of Marx's \"Theses on Feuerbach\" from his 1845 \"German Ideology\": \"The philosophers have only \"interpreted\" the world, in various ways; the point, however, is to \"change\" it.\"\nIn the twentieth century, a Hegelian-inflected interpretation of Marx was further developed in the work of critical theorists of the Frankfurt School. This was due to (a) the rediscovery and re-evaluation of Hegel as a possible philosophical progenitor of Marxism by philosophically oriented Marxists; (b) a resurgence of Hegel's historical perspective; and (c) an increasing recognition of the importance of his dialectical method. Gy\u00f6rgy Luk\u00e1cs' \"History and Class Consciousness\" (1923), in particular, helped to reintroduce Hegel into the Marxist canon.\nIn France.\nIt has become commonplace to identify \"French Hegel\" with the lectures of Alexandre Koj\u00e8ve, who emphasized the master\u2013servant [\"Herrschaft und Knechtschaft\"] dialectic (which he mistranslated as master-slave [\"ma\u00eetre et l'esclave\"]) and Hegel's philosophy of history. This perspective, however, overlooks over sixty years of French writing on Hegel, according to which Hegelianism was identified with the \"system\" presented in the \"Encyclopedia\". The later reading, drawing instead upon the \"Phenomenology of Spirit\", was in many ways a reaction against the earlier. After 1945, \"this 'dramatic' Hegelianism, which centered on the theme of historical becoming through conflict, [came] to be seen as compatible with existentialism and Marxism.\"\nBy confining the dialectic to history, the dominant French readings of Jean Wahl, Alexandre Koj\u00e8ve, and Jean Hyppolite effectively presented Hegel as providing \"a philosophical anthropology instead of a general metaphysics.\" This reading took the topic of \"desire\" as its focal point of intervention. A major theme was that \"a reason that seeks to be all-inclusive falsifies reality by suppressing or repressing its 'other.'\" Although it cannot be attributed entirely to Koj\u00e8ve, this reading of Hegel shaped the thought and interpretations of thinkers such as Jean-Paul Sartre, Maurice Merleau-Ponty, Claude L\u00e9vi-Strauss, Jacques Lacan, and Georges Bataille.\nKoj\u00e8ve's interpretation of the \"master\u2013slave dialectic\" as the basic model of historical development also influenced the feminism of Simone de Beauvoir and the anti-racist and anti-colonial work of Frantz Fanon.\nAmerican pragmatism.\nAs documented by Richard J. Bernstein, the influence of Hegel on American Pragmatism can be divided into three moments: the late nineteenth century, the mid-twentieth, and the present. The first is to be found in early issues of \"The Journal of Speculative Philosophy\" (founded 1867). The second is evident in the acknowledged influence upon major figures including John Dewey, Charles Peirce, and William James.\nAs Dewey himself describes the attraction, \"There were, however, also 'subjective' reasons for the appeal that Hegel's thought made to me; it supplied a demand for unification that was doubtless an intense emotional craving, and yet was a hunger that only an intellectualized subject-matter could satisfy.\" Dewey accepted much of Hegel's account of history and society, but rejected his conception of Hegel's account of absolute knowing.\nTwo philosophers, John McDowell and Robert Brandom (sometimes referred to as the \"Pittsburgh Hegelians\"), constitute, per Bernstein, the third moment of Hegel's influence on pragmatism. However, while openly acknowledging the influence, neither claims to explicate Hegel's views according to his own self-understanding. In addition, each is avowedly influenced by Wilfrid Sellars. McDowell is particularly interested in dispelling the \"myth of the given,\" the dichotomy between concept and intuition, whereas Brandom is concerned mostly to develop Hegel's social account of reason-giving and normative implication. These appropriations of Hegel's thought are two among several \"non-metaphysical\" readings.\nPublications and other writings.\nPublished articles are in quotes; book titles are italicized.\nBern, 1793\u201396\nFrankfurt am Main, 1797\u20131800\nJena, 1801\u201307\nBamberg, 1807\u201308\nNuremberg, 1808\u201316\nHeidelberg, 1816\u201318\nBerlin, 1818\u201331\nNotes.\nExplanatory notes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\nPrimary.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSecondary.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

If the network is one-dimensional, and the chain of nodes is connected to form a circular loop, the resulting topology is known as a ring. Network systems such as FDDI use two counter-rotating token-passing rings to achieve high reliability and performance. In general, when an \"n\"-dimensional grid network is connected circularly in more than one dimension, the resulting network topology is a torus, and the network is called \"toroidal\".
