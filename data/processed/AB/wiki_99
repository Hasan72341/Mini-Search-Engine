Systems of notation generally represent the elements of a piece of music that are considered important for its performance in the context of a given musical tradition. The process of interpreting musical notation is often referred to as reading music.\nDistinct methods of notation have been invented throughout history by various cultures. Much information about ancient music notation is fragmentary. Even in the same time frames, different styles of music and different cultures use different music notation methods.\nFor example, classical performers most often use sheet music using staves, time signatures, key signatures, and noteheads for writing and deciphering pieces. But even so, there are far more systems than just that. For instance, in professional country music, the Nashville Number System is the main method, and for string instruments such as guitar, it is quite common for tablature to be used by players.\nMusical notation uses ancient and modern symbols made upon any media such as stone, clay tablets, papyrus, parchment or manuscript paper; printed using a printing press (c.\u20091400), a computer printer (c.\u20091980) or other printing or modern copying technology.\nAlthough many ancient cultures used symbols to represent melodies and rhythms, none of them were particularly comprehensive, which has limited today's understanding of their music. The direct ancestor of the modern Western system of notation emerged in medieval Europe, in the context of the Christian Church's attempts to standardize the performance of plainsong melodies so that chants could be standardized across different areas. Notation developed further during the Renaissance and Baroque music eras. In the Classical period (1750\u20131820) and the Romantic music era (1820\u20131900), notation continued to develop as the technology for musical instruments advanced. In the contemporary classical music of the 20th and 21st centuries, music notation has evolved further, with the introduction of graphical notation by some modern composers and the use, since the 1980s, of computer-based scorewriter programs for notating music. Music notation has been adapted to many kinds of music, including classical music, popular music, and traditional music.\nHistory.\nAncient Near East.\nThe earliest form of musical notation can be found in a cuneiform tablet that was created at Nippur, in Babylonia (today's Iraq), in about 1400 BCE. The tablet represents fragmentary instructions for performing music, showing it was composed in harmonies of thirds using a diatonic scale.\nA tablet from about 1250 BCE shows a more developed form of notation. Although the interpretation of the notation system is still controversial, it is clear that the notation indicates the names of strings on a lyre, the tuning of which is described in other tablets. Research indicates these notations had dual purposes for liturgical and secular musical pieces since music was essential in both religious ceremonies and courtly activities. Although they are fragmentary, these tablets represent the earliest notated melodies found anywhere in the world.\nAncient Greece.\nAncient Greek musical notation was in use from at least the 6th century BCE until approximately the 4th century CE; only one complete composition (Seikilos epitaph) and a number of fragments using this notation survive.\nThe notation for sung music consists of letter symbols for the pitches, placed above text syllables. Rhythm is indicated in a rudimentary way only, with long and short symbols. The Seikilos epitaph has been variously dated between the 2nd century BCE to the 2nd century CE.\nThree hymns by Mesomedes of Crete exist in manuscript. The Delphic Hymns, dated to the 2nd century BCE also use this notation, but they are not completely preserved.\nAncient Greek notation appears to have fallen out of use around the time of the decline of the Western Roman Empire.\nByzantine Empire.\nByzantine music once included music for court ceremonies, but has only survived as vocal church music within various Orthodox traditions of monodic (monophonic) chant written down in Byzantine round notation (see Macarie's \"anastasimatarion\" with the Greek text translated into Romanian and transliterated into its corresponding Cyrillic script).\nSince the 6th century, Greek theoretical categories (\"melos\", \"genos\", \"harmonia\", \"systema\") played a key role in the understanding and transmission of Byzantine music, The tradition of Damascus, especially, had a strong impact on the pre-Islamic Near East comparable to that of Persian music. The earliest evidence are papyrus fragments of Greek \"tropologia\". These fragments present the hymn text following a modal signature or key (like \"\" for \"echos plagios protos\" or \"\" for \"echos devteros\").\nUnlike Western notation, Byzantine neumes used since the 10th century were always related to modal steps (same modal degree, one degree lower, two degrees higher, etc.) in relation to such a clef or modal key (modal signatures). Originally this key or the incipit of a common melody was enough to indicate a certain melodic model given within the echos. Next to ekphonetic notation, only used in lectionaries to indicate formulas used during scriptural lessons, melodic notation developed not earlier than between the 9th and the 10th century, when a \"theta\" (), \"oxeia\" () or \"diple\" () were written under a certain syllable of the text whenever a longer melisma was expected. This primitive form was called \"theta\" or \"diple notation\".\nThe evolution of this notation can be observed in Greek monastic chant books like those of the \"sticherarion\" and the \"heirmologion\". Chartres notation was used on Mount Athos and Constantinople, and Coislin notation was used within the patriarchates of Jerusalem and Alexandria, while another gestic notation was originally used for the \"asmatikon\" (choir book) and \"kontakarion\" (book of the soloist or monophonaris) of the Constantinopolitan cathedral rite. The earliest books which have survived, are \"kondakars\" in Slavonic translation which already show a notation system known as Kondakarian notation. Like the Greek alphabet, notational signs are ordered left to right (though the direction could be adapted, like in certain Syriac manuscripts). The question of rhythm was entirely based on \"cheironomia\" (the interpretation of so-called great signs which derived from different chant books). These great signs () indicated well-known melodic phrases given by gestures of the choirleaders of the cathedral rite. They existed once as part of an oral tradition, developed into Kondakarian notation and were integrated, during the 13th century, into Byzantine round notation as a kind of universal notation system.\nToday, the main difference between Western and Eastern neumes is that Eastern notation symbols are \"differential\" rather than absolute, i.e., they indicate pitch steps (rising, falling or at the same step), and the musicians must deduce the specific intervals based on the musical context and their current pitch. These step symbols themselves, or better \"phonic neumes\", resemble brush strokes and are colloquially called \"g\u00e1ntzoi\" ('hooks') in modern Greek.\nNotes as pitch classes or modal keys (usually memorised by modal signatures) are represented in written form only between these neumes (in manuscripts usually written in red ink). In modern notation they simply serve as optional reminders, with modal and tempo directions added when necessary. In Papadic notation medial signatures usually meant a temporary change into another \"echos\".\nThe so-called \"great signs\" were once related to cheironomic signs; according to modern interpretations they are understood as embellishments and microtonal attractions (pitch changes smaller than a semitone), both essential in Byzantine chant.\nSince Chrysanthos of Madytos there are seven standard note names used for \"solf\u00e8ge\" (\"parallag\u0113\") \"p\u00e1, v\u00fa, gh\u00e1, dhi, k\u00e9, z\u014d, n\u0113\", while the older practice still used the four \"enechemata\" or intonation formulas of the four echoi given by the modal signatures, the authentic or \"kyrioi\" in ascending direction, and the plagal or \"plagioi\" in descending direction (Papadic Octoechos). With exception of \"v\u00fa and z\u014d,\" they do roughly correspond to Western solmization syllables as \"re, mi, fa, sol, la, si, do\". Byzantine music uses the eight natural, non-tempered scales whose elements were identified by \"\u0112khoi\", \"sounds\", exclusively, and therefore the absolute pitch of each note may slightly vary each time, depending on the particular \"\u0112khos\" used. Byzantine notation is still used in many Orthodox Churches. Sometimes cantors also use transcriptions into Western or Kievan staff notation while adding non-notatable embellishment material from memory and \"sliding\" into the natural scales from experience. However, even in modern neume editions since the reform of Chrysanthos, many details rely on oral tradition passed down by traditional masters.\n13th-century Near East.\nIn 1252, Safi al-Din al-Urmawi developed a form of musical notation where rhythms were represented by geometric shapes. Many subsequent scholars of rhythm have sought to develop graphical geometrical notations. For example, a similar geometric system was published in 1987 by Kjell Gustafson, whose method represents a rhythm as a two-dimensional graph. Rhythmic notation during its early stages developed Eastern musical traditions while simultaneously establishing concepts that Western music used to build its notation systems later on.\nEarly Europe.\nThe scholar and music theorist Isidore of Seville, while writing in the early 7th century, wrote that \"unless sounds are held by the memory of man, they perish, because they cannot be written down.\" By the middle of the 9th century, however, a form of neumatic notation began to develop in monasteries in Europe as a mnemonic device for Gregorian chant, using symbols known as neumes; the earliest surviving musical notation of this type is in the \"Musica Disciplina\" of Aurelian of R\u00e9\u00f4me, from about 850. There are scattered survivals from the Iberian Peninsula before this time, of a type of notation known as Visigothic neumes, but its few surviving fragments have not yet been deciphered. The problem with this notation was that it only showed melodic contours and consequently the music could not be read by someone who did not know the music already.\nNotation had developed far enough to notate melody, but there was still no system for notating rhythm. A mid-13th-century treatise, \"De Mensurabili Musica\", explains a set of six rhythmic modes that were in use at the time, although it is not clear how they were formed. These rhythmic modes were all in triple time and rather limited the rhythm in chant to six different repeating patterns. This was a flaw seen by German music theorist Franco of Cologne and summarised as part of his treatise \"Ars Cantus Mensurabilis\" (the art of measured chant, or mensural notation). He suggested that individual notes could have their own rhythms represented by the shape of the note. Not until the 14th century did something like the present system of fixed note lengths arise. The use of regular measures (bars) became commonplace by the end of the 17th century.\nThe founder of what is now considered the standard music staff was Guido d'Arezzo, an Italian Benedictine monk who lived from about 991 until after 1033. He taught the use of solmization syllables based on a hymn to Saint John the Baptist, which begins \"Ut queant laxis\" and was written by the Lombard historian Paul the Deacon. The first stanza is:\nGuido used the first syllable of each line, \"Ut\", \"Re\", \"Mi\", \"Fa\", \"Sol\", \"La\", and \"Si\", to read notated music in terms of hexachords; they were not note names, and each could, depending on context, be applied to any note. In the 17th century, \"Ut\" was changed in most countries except France to the easily singable, open syllable Do, believed to have been taken either from the name of the Italian theorist Giovanni Battista Doni, or from the Latin word \"Dominus\", meaning \"Lord\".\nChristian monks developed the first forms of modern European musical notation in order to standardize liturgy throughout the worldwide Church, and an enormous body of religious music has been composed for it through the ages. This led directly to the emergence and development of European classical music, and its many derivatives. The Baroque style, which encompassed music, art, and architecture, was particularly encouraged by the post-Reformation Catholic Church as such forms offered a means of religious expression that was stirring and emotional, intended to stimulate religious fervor.\nModern staff notation.\nModern music notation is used by musicians of many different genres throughout the world. The staff (or stave, in British English) consists of 5 parallel horizontal lines that act as a framework upon which pitches are indicated by placing oval note-heads on (i.e. crossing) the staff lines, between the lines (\"i.e.\" in the spaces) or above and below the staff using small additional lines called ledger lines. Notation is read from left to right, which makes setting music for right-to-left scripts difficult. The pitch of a note is indicated by the vertical position of the note-head within the staff, and can be modified by accidentals. The duration (note length or note value) is indicated by the form of the note-head or with the addition of a note-stem plus beams or flags. A stemless hollow oval is a whole note or semibreve, a hollow rectangle or stemless hollow oval with one or two vertical lines on both sides is a double whole note or breve. A stemmed hollow oval is a half note or minim. Solid ovals always use stems, and can indicate quarter notes (crotchets) or, with added beams or flags, smaller subdivisions. Additional symbols such as dots and ties can lengthen the duration of a note.\nA staff of written music generally begins with a clef, which indicates the pitch-range of the staff. The treble clef or G clef was originally a letter G and it identifies the second line up on the five-line staff as the note G above middle C. The bass clef or F clef identifies the second line down as the note F below middle C. While the treble and bass clef are the most widely used, other clefs, which identify middle C, are used for some instruments, such as the alto clef (for viola and alto trombone) and the tenor clef (used for some cello, bassoon, tenor trombone, and double bass music). Some instruments use mainly one clef, such as violin and flute which use treble clef, and double bass and tuba which use bass clef. Some instruments, such as piano and pipe organ, regularly use both treble and bass clefs.\nFollowing the clef, the key signature is a group of 0 to 7 sharp (\u266f) or flat (\u266d) signs placed on the staff to indicate the key of the piece or song by specifying that certain notes are sharp or flat throughout the piece, unless otherwise indicated with accidentals added before certain notes. When a flat (\u266d) sign is placed before a note, the pitch of the note is lowered by one semitone. Similarly, a sharp sign (\u266f) raises the pitch by one semitone. For example, a sharp on the note D would raise it to D\u266f while a flat would lower it to D\u266d. Double sharps and double flats are less common, but they are used. A double sharp is placed before a note to make it two semitones higher, a double flat makes it two semitones lower. A natural sign placed before a note renders that note in its \"natural\" form, which means that any sharp or flat applied to that note from the key signature or an accidental is cancelled. Sometimes a courtesy accidental is used in music where it is not technically required, to remind the musician of what pitch is required.\nFollowing the key signature is the time signature. The time signature typically consists of two numbers, with one of the most common being . The top \"4\" indicates that there are four beats per measure (also called bar). The bottom \"4\" indicates that each of those beats are quarter notes. Measures divide the piece into groups of beats, and the time signatures specify those groupings. is used so often that it is also called \"common time\", and it may be indicated with rather than numbers. Other frequently used time signatures are (three beats per bar, with each beat being a quarter note); (two beats per bar, with each beat being a quarter note); (six beats per bar, with each beat being an eighth note) and (twelve beats per bar, with each beat being an eighth note; in practice, the eighth notes are typically put into four groups of three eighth notes. is a compound time type of time signature). Many other time signatures exist, such as or .\nMany short classical music pieces from the Classical era and songs from traditional music and popular music are in one time signature for much or all of the piece. Music from the Romantic era and later, particularly contemporary classical music and rock music genres such as progressive rock and the hardcore punk subgenre mathcore, may use mixed meter; songs or pieces change from one meter to another, for example alternating between bars of and .\nDirections to the player regarding matters such as tempo (e.g., \"andante\") and dynamics (e.g., \"forte\") appear above or below the staff. Terms indicating the musical expression or \"feel\" of a song or piece are indicated at the beginning of the piece and at any points where the mood changes (e.g., \"gelassen\") For vocal music, lyrics are written near the pitches of the melody. For short pauses (breaths), retakes (retakes are indicated with a ' mark) are added.\nIn music for ensembles, a \"score\" shows music for all players together, with the staves for the different instruments and/or voices stacked vertically. The conductor uses the score while leading an orchestra, concert band, choir or other large ensemble. Individual performers in an ensemble play from \"parts\" which contain only the music played by an individual musician. A score can be constructed from a complete set of parts and vice versa. The process was laborious and time consuming when parts were hand-copied from the score, but since the development of scorewriter computer software in the 1980s, a score stored electronically can have parts automatically prepared by the program and printed out quickly and inexpensively using a computer printer.\nIn various countries.\nKorea.\n\"Jeongganbo\" is a traditional musical notation system created during the time of Sejong the Great. It was the first East Asian system to represent rhythm, pitch, and time. Among various kinds of Korean traditional music, \"Jeong-gan-bo\" targets a particular genre, \"Jeong-ak\" ().\n\"Jeong-gan-bo\" specifies the pitch by writing the note's name down in a box called \"jeong-gan\". One \"jeong-gan\" is one beat each, and it can be split into two, three or more to hold half beats, quarter beats, and more.\nAlso, there are many markings indicating things such as ornaments. Most of these were later created by Ki-su Kim.\nIndia.\nThe \"Samaveda\" text (1200 BCE \u2013 1000 BCE) contains what are probably the world's oldest surviving melodies. The musical notation is written usually immediately above, sometimes within, the line of \"Samaveda\" text, either in syllabic or numerical form depending on the Samavedic \"Sakha\" (school). The Indian scholar and musical theorist Pingala (c. 200 BCE), in his \"Chanda Sutra\", used marks denoting long and short syllables to indicate meters in Sanskrit poetry.\nA rock inscription circa 7th\u20138th century CE at Kudumiyanmalai, Tamil Nadu contains an early example of a musical notation. It was first identified and published by archaeologist/epigraphist D. R. Bhandarkar. Written in the \"Pallava-grantha\" script of the 7th century, it contains 38 horizontal lines of notation inscribed on a rectangular rock face (dimensions of around 13 by 14 feet). Each line of the notation contains 64 characters (characters representing musical notes), written in groups of four notes. The basic characters for the seven notes, \"sa\", \"ri\", \"ga\", \"ma\", \"pa\", \"dha\", \"ni\", are seen to be suffixed with the vowels \"a\", \"i\", \"u\", \"e\". For example, in the place of \"sa\", any one of \"sa\", \"si\", \"su\" or \"se\" is used. Similarly, in place of \"ri\", any one of \"ra\", \"ri\", \"ru\" or \"re\" is used. Horizontal lines divide the notation into 7 sections. Each section contains 4 to 7 lines of notation, with a title indicating its musical 'mode'. These modes may have been popular from at least the 6th century CE and were incorporated into the Indian \"raga\" system that developed later. But some of the unusual features seen in this notation have been given several non-conclusive interpretations by scholars.\nIn the notation of Indian \"r\u0101ga\", a solfege-like system called \"sargam\" is used. As in Western solfege, there are names for the seven basic pitches of a major scale (\"Shadja\", \"Rishabha\", \"Gandhara\", \"Madhyama\", \"Panchama\", \"Dhaivata\" and \"Nishada\", usually shortened to \"Sa\", \"Re\", \"Ga\", \"Ma\", \"Pa\", \"Dha\", \"Ni\"). The tonic of any scale is named \"Sa\", and the dominant \"Pa\". \"Sa\" is fixed in any scale, and \"Pa\" is fixed at a fifth above it (a Pythagorean fifth rather than an equal-tempered fifth). These two notes are known as \"achala swar\" ('fixed notes').\nEach of the other five notes, \"Re\", \"Ga\", \"Ma\", \"Dha\" and \"Ni\", can take a 'regular' (\"shuddha\") pitch, which is equivalent to its pitch in a standard major scale (thus, \"shuddha Re\", the second degree of the scale, is a whole-step higher than \"Sa\"), or an altered pitch, either a half-step above or half-step below the shuddha pitch. \"Re\", \"Ga\", \"Dha\" and \"Ni\" all have altered partners that are a half-step lower (\"komal\" or \"flat\") (thus, \"komal Re\" is a half-step higher than \"Sa\").\n\"Ma\" has an altered partner that is a half-step higher (\"teevra\" or \"sharp\") (thus, \"teevra Ma\" is an augmented fourth above \"Sa\"). \"Re\", \"Ga\", \"Ma\", \"Dha\" and \"Ni\" are called ('movable notes'). In the written system of Indian notation devised by Ravi Shankar, the pitches are represented by Western letters. Capital letters are used for the \"achala swar\", and for the higher variety of all the \"vikrut swar\". Lowercase letters are used for the lower variety of the \"vikrut swar\".\nOther systems exist for non-twelve-tone equal temperament and non-Western music, such as the Indian \"Swaralipi\".\nRussia.\nZnamenny Chant is a singing tradition used in the Russian Orthodox Church which uses a \"hook and banner\" notation. Znamenny Chant is unison, melismatic liturgical singing that has its own specific notation, called the \"stolp\" notation. The symbols used in the \"stolp\" notation are called ' (, 'hooks') or ' (, 'banners'). Often the names of the signs are used to refer to the \"stolp\" notation. \"Znamenny\" melodies are part of a system, consisting of Eight Modes (intonation structures; called \"glasy\"); the melodies are characterized by fluency and well-balancedness. There exist several types of Znamenny Chant: the so-called \"Stolpovoy\", \"Malyj\" (Little) and \"Bolshoy\" (Great) Znamenny Chant. Ruthenian Chant (\"Prostopinije\") is sometimes considered a sub-division of the Znamenny Chant tradition, with the Muscovite Chant (Znamenny Chant proper) being the second branch of the same musical continuum.\nZnamenny Chants are not written with notes (the so-called linear notation), but with special signs, called \"Znam\u00ebna\" (Russian for \"marks\", \"banners\") or \"Kryuki\" (\"hooks\"), as some shapes of these signs resemble hooks. Each sign may include the following components: a large black hook or a black stroke, several smaller black 'points' and 'commas' and lines near the hook or crossing the hook. Some signs may mean only one note, some 2 to 4 notes, and some a whole melody of more than 10 notes with a complicated rhythmic structure. The \"stolp\" notation was developed in Kievan Rus' as an East Slavic refinement of the Byzantine neumatic musical notation.\nThe most notable feature of this notation system is that it records transitions of the melody, rather than notes. The signs also represent the mood and indicate how this part of melody is to be sung (tempo, strength, devotion, meekness, etc.). Every sign has its own name and also features as a spiritual symbol. For example, there is a specific sign, called \"little dove\" (Russian: \u0433\u043e\u043b\u0443\u0431\u0447\u0438\u043a (\"golubchik\")), which represents two rising sounds, but which is also a symbol of the Holy Ghost. Gradually, the system became more and more complicated. This system was also ambiguous, so that almost no one, except the most trained and educated singers, could sing an unknown melody at sight. The signs only helped to reproduce the melody, not coding it in an unambiguous way.\nChina.\nThe earliest known examples of text referring to music in China are inscriptions on musical instruments found in the Tomb of the Marquis Yi of Zeng (d. 433 BCE). Sets of 41 chimestones and 65 bells bore lengthy inscriptions concerning pitches, scales, and transposition. The bells still sound the pitches that their inscriptions refer to. Although no notated musical compositions were found, the inscriptions indicate that the system was sufficiently advanced to allow for musical notation. Two systems of pitch nomenclature existed, one for relative pitch and one for absolute pitch. For relative pitch, a solmization system was used.\n\"Gongche\" notation used Chinese characters for the names of the scale.\nJapan.\nJapanese music is highly diversified, and therefore requires various systems of notation. In Japanese \"shakuhachi\" music, for example, glissandos and timbres are often more significant than distinct pitches, whereas \"taiko\" notation focuses on discrete strokes.\nRyukyuan sanshin music uses \"kunkunshi\", a notation system of kanji with each character corresponding to a finger position on a particular string.\nIndonesia.\nNotation plays a relatively minor role in the oral traditions of Indonesia. However, in Java and Bali, several systems were developed starting in the late 19th century, initially for archival purposes. Today the most widespread are cipher notations (\"not \"angka\"\" in the broadest sense) in which the pitches are represented with the numbers 1 to 7, with 1 corresponding to either the highest note of a particular octave, as in Sundanese gamelan, or the lowest, as in the \"kepatihan\" notation of Javanese gamelan.\nNotes in the ranges outside the central octave are represented with one or more dots above or below each number. For the most part, these cipher notations are mainly used to notate the skeletal melody (the \"balungan\") and vocal parts (\"gerongan\"), although transcriptions of the elaborative instrument variations are sometimes used for analysis and teaching. Drum parts are notated with a system of symbols largely based on letters representing the vocables used to learn and remember drumming patterns; these symbols are typically laid out in a grid underneath the skeletal melody for a specific or generic piece.\nThe symbols used for drum notation (as well as the vocables represented) are highly variable from place to place and performer to performer. In addition to these current systems, two older notations used a kind of staff: the Solonese script could capture the flexible rhythms of the \"pesinden\" with a squiggle on a horizontal staff, while in Yogyakarta, a ladder-like vertical staff allowed notation of the \"balungan\" by dots and also included important drum strokes. In Bali, there are a few books published of \"Gamelan gender wayang\" pieces employing alphabetical notation in the old Balinese script.\nComposers and scholars both Indonesian and foreign have also mapped the \"slendro\" and \"pelog\" tuning systems of gamelan onto the Western staff, with and without various symbols for microtones. The Dutch composer Ton de Leeuw also invented a three-line staff for his composition \"Gending\". However, these systems do not enjoy widespread use.\nIn the second half of the twentieth century, Indonesian musicians and scholars extended cipher notation to other oral traditions, and a diatonic scale cipher notation has become common for notating Western-related genres (church hymns, popular songs, and so forth). Unlike the cipher notation for gamelan music, which uses a \"fixed-Do\" (that is, 1 always corresponds to the same pitch, within the natural variability of gamelan tuning), Indonesian diatonic cipher notation is \"movable-Do\" notation, so scores must indicate which pitch corresponds to the number 1 (for example, \"1=C\").\nJudea.\nAncient Jewish texts include a series of marks assigning musical cantillation notes. Known in Hebrew as \"Ta'amim\" and Yiddish as Trope, there are records of these marks from the 6th and 7th centuries, having been passed down as a tradition for Jewish prayers and texts. Traditionally a series of marks written above and around the accompanying Hebrew texts, Trope marks represent a short musical motif. Throughout the Jewish diaspora there are variations in the accompanying melodies. There are three main systems of Hebrew cantillation: the Babylonian System, the Palestinian System, and the Tiberian System.\nOther systems and practices.\nCipher notation.\nCipher notation systems assigning Arabic numerals to the major scale degrees have been used at least since the Iberian organ tablatures of the 16th-century and include such exotic adaptations as \"Siffernotskrift\". The one most widely in use today is the Chinese \"Jianpu\", discussed in the main article. Numerals can also be assigned to different scale systems, as in the Javanese \"kepatihan\" notation described above.\nSolf\u00e8ge.\nSolf\u00e8ge is a way of assigning syllables to names of the musical scale. In order, they are today: \"Do\", \"Re\", \"Mi\", \"Fa\", \"Sol\", \"La\", \"Ti\", \"Do'\" (for the octave). The classic variation is: \"Do\", \"Re\", \"Mi\", \"Fa\", \"Sol\", \"La\", \"Si\", \"Do'\". The first Western system of functional names for the musical notes was introduced by Guido of Arezzo (c. 991 \u2013 after 1033), using the beginning syllables of the first six musical lines of the Latin hymn \"Ut queant laxis\". The original sequence was \"Ut\", \"Re\", \"Mi\", \"Fa\", \"Sol\", \"La\", where each verse started a scale note higher. \"Ut\" later became \"Do\". The equivalent syllables used in Indian music are: \"Sa\", \"Re\", \"Ga\", \"Ma\", \"Pa\", \"Dha\", \"Ni\". See also: solf\u00e8ge, sargam, Kod\u00e1ly hand signs.\nTonic sol-fa is a type of notation using the initial letters of solf\u00e8ge.\nLetter notation.\nThe notes of the 12-tone scale can be written by their letter names A\u2013G, possibly with a trailing accidental, such as A\u266f or B\u266d.\nABC.\nABC notation is a compact format using plain text characters, readable by computers and by humans. More than 100,000 tunes are now transcribed in this format.\nTablature.\nTablature was first used in the Middle Ages for organ music and later in the Renaissance for lute music. In most lute tablatures, a staff is used, but instead of pitch values, the lines of the staff represent the strings of the instrument. The frets to finger are written on each line, indicated by letters or numbers. Rhythm is written separately with one or another variation of standard note values indicating the duration of the fastest moving part. Few seem to have remarked on the fact that tablature combines in one notation system both the physical and technical requirements of play (the lines and symbols on them and in relation to each other representing the actual performance actions) with the unfolding of the music itself (the lines of tablature taken horizontally represent the actual temporal unfolding of the music). In later periods, lute and guitar music was written with standard notation. Tablature caught interest again in the late 20th century for popular guitar music and other fretted instruments, being easy to transcribe and share over the internet in ASCII format.\nPiano-roll-based notations.\nSome chromatic systems have been created taking advantage of the layout of black and white keys of the standard piano keyboard. The \"staff\" is most widely referred to as \"piano roll\", created by extending the black and white piano keys.\nKlavar notation.\n (sometimes shortened to klavar) is a music notation system that was introduced in 1931 by the Dutchman Cornelis Pot. The name means \"keyboard writing\" in Esperanto. It differs from conventional music notation in a number of ways and is intended to be easily readable. Many klavar readers are from the Netherlands.\nChromatic staff notations.\nOver the past three centuries, hundreds of music notation systems have been proposed as alternatives to traditional Western music notation. Many of these systems seek to improve upon traditional notation by using a \"chromatic staff\" in which each of the 12 pitch classes has its own unique place on the staff. An example is Jacques-Daniel Rochat's \"Dodeka\" music notation. These notation systems do not require the use of standard key signatures, accidentals, or clef signs. They also represent interval relationships more consistently and accurately than traditional notation, e.g. major 3rds appear wider than minor 3rds. Many of these systems are described and illustrated in Gardner Read's \"Source Book of Proposed Music Notation Reforms\".\nGraphic notation.\nThe term \"graphic notation\" refers to the contemporary use of non-traditional symbols and text to convey information about the performance of a piece of music. Composers such as Johanna Beyer, Christian Wolff, Carmen Barradas, Earle Brown, Yoko Ono, Anthony Braxton, John Cage, Morton Feldman, Cathy Berberian, Graciela Castillo, Krzysztof Penderecki, Cornelius Cardew, Pauline Oliveros and Roger Reynolds are among the early generation of composers who innovated forms of graphic notation beginning in the mid-twentieth century. The book \"Notations\", edited by John Cage and Alison Knowles and published by Something Else Press in 1969, compiles many examples of this kind of notation.\nSimplified music notation.\nSimplified music notation is an alternative form of musical notation designed to make sight-reading easier. It is based on classical staff notation, but incorporates sharps and flats into the shape of the note heads. Notes such as double sharps and double flats are written at the pitch they are actually played at, but preceded by symbols called \"history signs\" that show they have been transposed.\nModified Stave Notation.\nModified Stave Notation (MSN) is an alternative way of notating music for people who cannot easily read ordinary musical notation even if it is enlarged.\nParsons code.\nParsons code is used to encode music so that it can be easily searched.\nBraille music.\nBraille music is a complete, well developed, and internationally accepted musical notation system that has symbols and notational conventions quite independent of print music notation. It is linear in nature, similar to a printed language and different from the two-dimensional nature of standard printed music notation. To a degree, Braille music resembles musical markup languages such as MusicXML or NIFF.\nInteger notation.\nIn integer notation, or the integer model of pitch, all pitch classes and intervals between pitch classes are designated using the numbers 0 through 11.\nRap notation.\nThe standard form of rap notation is the \"flow diagram\", where rappers line up their lyrics underneath \"beat numbers\". Hip-hop scholars also make use of the same flow diagrams that rappers use: the books \"How to Rap\" and \"How to Rap 2\" extensively use the diagrams to explain rap's triplets, flams, rests, rhyme schemes, runs of rhyme, and breaking rhyme patterns, among other techniques. Similar systems are used by musicologists Adam Krims in his book \"Rap Music and the Poetics of Identity\" and Kyle Adams in his work on rap's flow. As rap usually revolves around a strong 4/4 beat, with certain syllables aligned to the beat, all the notational systems have a similar structure: they all have four beat numbers at the top of the diagram, so that syllables can be written in-line with the beat.\nTin Whistle Fingering Charts.\nIt is used for six-hole woodwind instruments, basically for Irish folk songs. Tin whistle tabs are particularly useful for those unfamiliar with sheet music notation.\nMusic notation on computers.\nUnicode.\nThe Musical Symbols Unicode block encodes an extensive system of formal musical notation.\nThe Miscellaneous Symbols block has a few of the more common symbols:\nThe Miscellaneous Symbols and Pictographs block has three emoji that may include depictions of musical notes:\nSoftware.\nVarious computer programs have been developed for creating music notation (called \"scorewriters\" or \"music notation software\"). Music may also be stored in various digital file formats for purposes other than graphic notation output.\nPerspectives of musical notation in composition and musical performance.\nAccording to Philip Tagg and Richard Middleton, musicology and to a degree European-influenced musical practice suffer from a \"notational centricity\", a methodology slanted by the characteristics of notation. A variety of 20th- and 21st-century composers have dealt with this problem, either by adapting standard Western musical notation or by using graphic notation. These include George Crumb, Luciano Berio, Krzysztof Penderecki, Earl Brown, John Cage, Witold Lutoslawski, and others.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;"}
{"id": "20202", "revid": "44106950", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20202", "title": "Meir Kahane", "text": "American and Israeli politician (1932\u20131990)\nMeir David HaKohen Kahane ( ; ; born Martin David Kahane; August 1, 1932 \u2013 November 5, 1990) was an Israeli Orthodox ordained rabbi, writer and ultra-nationalist politician. He was the founder of the Israeli political party Kach, whose ideology continues to influence militant and far-right political groups active today in Israel. Kahane was convicted of multiple acts of terrorism in the United States and in Israel.\nBorn in 1932 in Brooklyn, New York City, to an Orthodox Jewish family, Kahane received his education there, starting with Jewish scripture studies, and eventually gaining an M.A. in International Relations from New York University. In 1968, he founded the Jewish Defense League (JDL) in New York City, whose self-described purpose was to fight anti-Semitism. Several JDL members, including Kahane, were subsequently convicted of acts related to domestic terrorism, including leading the attack on the Soviet United Nations mission in 1975. Later that same year, Kahane was convicted of conspiring to kidnap a Soviet diplomat, bomb the Iraqi embassy in Washington, and ship arms abroad from Israel. He consequently served a one year imprisonment, albeit in a hotel. \nIn 1971, Kahane moved to Israel and became a citizen, where he initiated protests calling for the expulsion of both Palestinian citizens of Israel and Palestinians of the Israeli-occupied territories, which led to his arrest dozens of times. In the same year, he founded Kach, a political party that initially failed to gain any seats in the Knesset. In 1980, Kahane was arrested for the 62nd time since his emigration, and he was jailed for six months for planning armed attacks against Palestinians. Kahane was held in prison in Ramla, where he wrote the book \"They Must Go\". In the 1984 elections, his Kach party gained one seat in the Knesset, which was taken by Kahane, but he was later barred from running in 1988. In 1990, he was giving a speech to an audience of Orthodox Jews from Brooklyn, urging American Jews to emigrate to Israel, when he was assassinated by El Sayyid Nosair, an Egyptian-American national. Kahane was buried in West Jerusalem.\nDuring his lifetime Kahane publicized his Kahanism ideology throughout the United States. In Israel, he proposed enforcing \"halakha\" (Jewish law) as codified by Maimonides and hoped that Israel would eventually adopt it as state law. While serving in the Knesset in the mid-1980s Kahane proposed numerous laws, none of which passed, to emphasize Judaism in public schools, reduce Israel's bureaucracy, forbid sexual relations between Jews and non-Jews, separate Jewish and Arab neighborhoods, and end cultural meetings between Jewish and Arab students. He went so far as to demand that non-Jews in Israel either become slaves or face deportation. He also popularized the slogan \"For Every Jew a .22.\" He supported the restriction of Israel's democracy to its Jewish citizens, and endorsed the annexation of the Israeli-occupied Palestinian territories of the West Bank and Gaza Strip.\nPersonal life.\nMeir Kahane was born in Brooklyn, New York, to an Orthodox Jewish family. Kahane was a member of an established rabbinic family, including his father, who was head of the Flatbush Board of Rabbis. His father, Yechezkel Shragei (Charles) Kahane (1905\u20131978), was the rabbi of a large synagogue in Brooklyn, author of the interpretive Torah translation \"Torah Yesharah\", and a strong supporter of the Revisionist Zionist movement. Kahane's grandfather was Nachman Kahane (1869\u20131937), a leading rabbinic scholar in Safed, who was the son of Baruch David Kahane (1850\u20131925), the author of \"Hibat ha-Eretz\", and a disciple of Chaim Halberstam of Sanz. Baruch David was a direct descendant of Simcha Rappaport (1650\u20131718), of the Rappaport rabbinic family, who were allegedly able to trace their ancestry back to Eleazar ben Azariah, a 1st-century sage in the Land of Israel. Baruch David immigrated to Ottoman Palestine from Poland in 1873. Kahane's father was born in Safed while his mother Sonia was born in Latvia. An uncle of Kahane's was killed in Safed during the 1929 Palestine riots.\nAs a teenager, Kahane became an ardent admirer of Eri Jabotinsky and Peter Bergson, who were frequent guests in his parents' home. He joined the Betar (Brit Trumpeldor) youth wing of Revisionist Zionism. He was active in protests against Ernest Bevin, the British Foreign Secretary who maintained restrictions on the emigration of Jews, even Holocaust survivors, to Palestine after the end of the Second World War. In 1949, Kahane was arrested for throwing eggs and tomatoes at Bevin, who was disembarking at Pier 90 on a visit to New York. A photo of his arrest appeared in the \"New York Daily News\". In 1954, he became the Mazkir (Secretary) of Greater New York City's 16 Bnei Akiva chapters.\nKahane's formal education included Yeshiva of Flatbush for elementary school and Brooklyn Talmudical Academy for high school. Kahane received his rabbinical ordination from the Mir Yeshiva in Brooklyn, where he was especially admired by the head Rabbi Abraham Kalmanowitz. He was fully conversant in the Tanakh (Jewish Bible), the Talmud, the Midrash and Jewish law. Subsequently, Kahane earned a B.A. in political science from Brooklyn College in 1954, a Bachelor of Law \u2013 LL.B. from New York Law School, and an M.A. in International Relations from New York University.\nIn 1956, Kahane married Libby Blum, with whom he had four children: Tzipporah, Tova, Baruch, and Binyamin. Binyamin became an Orthodox Jewish scholar, rabbi, and far-right political leader aligned with Kahane's political movement, and was later killed in 2000.\nIn 1966, Kahane, under the alias of Michael King and while already married, had an affair and became engaged to marry the 21-year-old model Gloria Jean D'Argenio (who used the stage name Estelle Donna Evans). Kahane sent a letter to D'Argenio in which he unilaterally ended their relationship. D'Argenio was never aware of Kahane's real identity and at the time she received the letter, she had been expecting him to marry her in two days and had recently learned she was pregnant by him. Upon receiving the letter, D'Argenio jumped off the Queensboro Bridge and died of her injuries the next day. In 2008, Kahane's wife dismissed the incident as lacking proof.\nAfter D'Argenio's death, Kahane started the Estelle Donna Evans Foundation in her name. Kahane claimed D'Argenio had been his former secretary in his failed consulting operation, had died of cancer, and that her \"well-to-do\" family had endowed the foundation. In reality, the money was used to fund the JDL, including supplies for bombings and Kahane's lavish travel.\nEarly career.\nPulpit rabbi.\nIn 1958, Kahane became the rabbi of the Howard Beach Jewish Center in Queens, New York City. Although the synagogue was originally Conservative, rather than strictly Orthodox, the board of directors agreed to Kahane's conditions, which included resigning from the Conservative movement's United Synagogue of America, installing a partition separating men and women during prayer, instituting traditional prayers, and maintaining a kosher kitchen. At the Jewish Center, Kahane influenced many of the synagogue's youngsters to adopt a more observant lifestyle, which often troubled parents. He trained Arlo Guthrie for his bar mitzvah. When his contract was not renewed, he soon published an article entitled \"End of the Miracle of Howard Beach\". That was Kahane's first article in \"The Jewish Press\", an American Orthodox Jewish weekly for which he would continue to write for the rest of his life. Kahane also used the pen name David Sinai, and the pseudonyms Michael King, David Borac, and Martin Keene.\nInfiltrating the John Birch Society.\nIn the late 1950s and the early 1960s, Kahane's life of secrecy and his strong anticommunism landed him a position as a consultant with the FBI. According to his wife, Libby, his assignment was to infiltrate the anticommunist John Birch Society and report his findings to the FBI.\nCollaboration with Joseph Churba.\nAt some time in the late 1950s, Kahane assumed the persona of a Gentile, along with the pseudonym Michael King. Kahane began openly expressing his anticommunism. He and Joseph Churba created the July Fourth Movement, which was formed to counteract widespread opposition towards U.S. involvement in the Vietnam War. Subsequently, they coauthored the book \"The Jewish Stake in Vietnam\", an attempt to convince American Jews of the \"evil of Communism\". The introduction states that, \"All Americans have a stake in this grim war against Communism... It is vital that Jews realize the threat to their very survival [should Communism succeed].\" Churba had a major falling out with Kahane over the use of paramilitary activities, and they parted ways permanently. Churba went on to pursue his own career, joining the U.S. Air Force, writing many books on the Middle East, and eventually becoming one of Ronald Reagan's consultants. Kahane chose to fight for Jewish rights, and was willing to use extreme measures. He even attempted to acquire and grow biological weapons to use on a Soviet military installation. He began using the phrase \"Never again\" and conceived the Jewish Star and fist insignia, a symbol resembling that of the Black Panther Party. However, Kahane himself opposed the Black Panthers, claiming they had supported anti-Jewish riots in Massachusetts and had left-wing views.\nJewish Defense League.\nKahane founded the Jewish Defense League (JDL) in New York City in 1968. Its self-described purpose was to protect Jews from local manifestations of anti-Semitism. Kahane encouraged Jews to take up firearms, through his slogan \"every Jew a .22\". \nThe JDL said it was committed to five fundamental principles:\nKahane's wife Libby stated that the JDL favored \"civil rights for blacks, but opposed black anti-Semites\" and Kahane himself stated that the JDL was \"not against any race, creed, or color. We are against anyone who is against the Jews.\" In 1971, the JDL formed an alliance with a black rights group in what Kahane termed \"a turning point in Black-Jewish relations\". The Anti-Defamation League claimed that Kahane \"preached a radical form of Jewish nationalism which reflected racism, violence and political extremism\" that was replicated by Irv Rubin, the JDL's successor to Kahane.\nTerrorism and convictions.\nA number of the JDL's members and leaders, including Kahane, were convicted of acts related to domestic terrorism. In 1971, Kahane was sentenced to a suspended five-year prison sentence and fined $5,000 for conspiring to manufacture explosives. In 1975, Kahane was arrested for leading the attack on the Soviet United Nations mission and injuring two officers, but he was released after being given summonses for disorderly conduct. Later the same year, Kahane was accused of conspiring to kidnap a Soviet diplomat, bomb the Iraqi embassy in Washington, and ship arms abroad from Israel. He was convicted of violating his probation for the 1971 bombing conviction and was sentenced to one year in prison. However, he served most of it in a hotel, with frequent unsupervised absences, because of a concession over the provision of kosher food.\nIn a 1984 interview with \"Washington Post\" correspondent Carla Hall, Kahane admitted that the JDL \"bombed the Russian [Soviet] mission in New York, the Russian cultural mission here [Washington] in 1971, the Soviet trade offices\".\nEmigration to Israel.\nIn September 1971, Kahane moved to Israel. At the time, he declared that he would focus on Jewish education. He later began gathering lists of Palestinian citizens of the State of Israel who were willing to emigrate for compensation, and eventually, he initiated protests that advocated the expulsion of Palestinian citizens of Israel, and Palestinians of the Israeli-occupied territories. In 1972, Jewish Defense League leaflets were distributed in Hebron, calling for the mayor to stand trial for the 1929 Hebron massacre. Kahane was arrested dozens of times by Israeli law enforcement. In 1971, he founded Kach, a political party that ran for the Knesset, the Israeli Parliament, during the 1973 general elections under the name \"The League List\". It won 12,811 votes (0.82%), just 2,857 (0.18%) short of the electoral threshold at the time (1%) for winning a Knesset seat. The party was even less successful in the 1977 elections, winning only 4,836 votes.\nIn 1980, Kahane was arrested for the 62nd time since his emigration, and he was jailed for six months after a detention order that was based on allegations of him planning armed attacks against Palestinians in response to the killings of Jewish settlers. Kahane was held in prison in Ramla, where he wrote the book \"They Must Go\". Kahane was banned from entering the UK in 1981.\nIn 1981, Kahane's party again ran for the Knesset during the 1981 elections, but it did not win a seat and received only 5,128 votes. In 1984, the Israeli Central Elections Committee banned him from being a candidate on the grounds that Kach was a racist party, but the Supreme Court of Israel overturned the ban on the grounds that the committee was not authorized to ban Kahane's candidacy. The Supreme Court suggested that the Knesset pass a law excluding racist parties from future elections. The Knesset responded in 1985 by amending the \"Basic Law: Knesset\" to include a prohibition (paragraph 7a) against the registration of parties that explicitly or implicitly incite racism.\nKnesset.\nIn the 1984 legislative elections, Kahane's Kach party received 25,907 votes (1.2%), gaining one seat in the Knesset, which was taken by Kahane. He refused to take the standard oath of office and insisted on adding a Biblical verse from Psalms to indicate that national laws were overruled by the Torah if they conflict. Kahane's legislative proposals focused on Jewish education, an open economy, transferring the Arab population out of the Land of Israel, revoking Israeli citizenship from non-Jews, and banning Jewish-Gentile marriages and sexual relations.\nWhile his popularity in Israel grew, Kahane was boycotted in the Knesset, where his speeches were often made to an empty assembly except for the duty chairman and the transcriptionist. The Knesset revoked his Parliamentary immunity to prevent his freedom of movement in areas where his inflammatory rhetoric could cause harm. Kahane's legislative proposals and motions of no-confidence against the government were ignored or rejected. Kahane often pejoratively called other Knesset members \"Hellenists,\" a reference to Jews who assimilated into Greek culture after Judea's occupation by Alexander the Great.\nIn 1987, Kahane opened a yeshiva (\"HaRaayon HaYehudi\") with funding from US supporters to teach \"the Authentic Jewish Idea\". Despite the boycott, his popularity grew among the Israeli public, especially for working-class Sephardi Jews. Polls showed that Kach would have likely received anywhere from four to twelve seats in the coming November 1988 elections.\nIn 1985, the Knesset passed an amendment to the Basic Law of Israel, barring political parties that incited to racism. The Central Elections Committee banned Kahane a second time, and he appealed to the Israeli Supreme Court. However, the Supreme Court this time ruled in favor of the committee, disqualifying Kach from running in the 1988 legislative elections. Kahane was thus the first candidate in Israel to be barred from election for racism. Shaul Magid writes that \"This law was clearly legislated for Kahane and KACH alone; it was never successfully invoked again.\" The law was criticized as being anti-democratic by the well-known lawyer and professor Alan Dershowitz.\nAfter Kahane's election to the Knesset in 1984, the United States government attempted to revoke his U.S. citizenship, an action which Kahane successfully challenged in court. However, in 1987, the Knesset passed a law declaring that a Knesset member could only be an Israeli citizen. To remain eligible for office, Kahane renounced his United States citizenship, but after being banned from the Knesset for his politics, he again filed suit to get his U.S. citizenship reinstated based on the argument that he was compelled to relinquish it by the Knesset. The court rejected this argument, but he was permitted to continue traveling to the United States.\nAssassination.\nIn November 1990, Kahane gave a speech to an audience of mostly Orthodox Jews from Brooklyn, in which he warned American Jews to emigrate to Israel before it was \"too late\". As a crowd gathered around Kahane in the second-floor lecture hall in Midtown Manhattan's New York Marriott East Side, Kahane was assassinated by El Sayyid Nosair, an Egyptian-born U.S. citizen. He was initially charged and acquitted of the murder. Nosair was later convicted of the murder in a U.S. district court for his involvement in the 1993 World Trade Center bombing. Prosecutors were able to try Nosair again for the murder because the federal indictment included the killing as part of the alleged terrorist conspiracy. He was sentenced to life imprisonment and later made a confession to federal agents.\nKahane was buried on Har HaMenuchot, in Jerusalem. He was eulogized by supporters in both the U.S. and in Israel, including Rabbi Moshe Tendler and the Sephardic Chief Rabbi of Israel, Mordechai Eliyahu, who spoke of how little the people understood of Kahane's true value.\nA few hours after news of the assassination of Kahane reached Israel, two elderly Palestinians, Mohammed Ali (73) and Mariam Suleiman Hassan (71), were gunned down in an incident ascribed to Kach militants. Noam Federman was quoted as saying that the slayings had been committed as revenge by Kahane supporters, and that more violence was in the pipeline.\nIdeology.\nKahane argued that there was a glory in Jewish destiny, which came through the observance of the Torah and \"halakha\" (Jewish law). He observed, \"Democracy and Judaism are not the same thing.\" Kahane was of the view a Jewish state and a Western democracy were incompatible, since Western democracy is religion-blind, and a Jewish state is religion-oriented by its very name. He feared non-Jewish citizens becoming a majority and voting against the Jewish character of the state: \"The question is as follows: if the Arabs settle among us and make enough children to become a majority, will Israel continue to be a Jewish state? Do we have to accept that the Arab majority will decide?\" He also said that \"you cannot have Zionism and democracy at the same ... Western democracy has to be ruled out. For me, that's cut and dried: There's no question of setting up democracy in Israel, because democracy means equal rights for all, irrespective of racial or religious origins.\"\nKahane proposed an \"exchange of populations\" that would continue the Jewish exodus from Arab lands: \"A total of some 750,000 Jews fled Arab lands since 1948. Surely it is time for Jews, worried over the huge growth of Arabs in Israel, to consider finishing the exchange of populations that began 35 years ago.\" Kahane proposed a $40,000 compensation plan for Arabs who would leave voluntarily, and forcible expulsion for those who \"don't want to leave\". He encouraged retaliatory violence against Arabs who attacked Jews: \"I approve of anybody who commits such acts of violence. Really, I don't think that we can sit back and watch Arabs throwing rocks at buses whenever they feel like it. They must understand that a bomb thrown at a Jewish bus is going to mean a bomb thrown at an Arab bus.\"\nIn some of his writings, Kahane argued that Israel should never start a war for territory but that if a war were launched against Israel, Biblical territory should be annexed. However, in an interview, he defined Israel's \"minimal borders\" as follows: \"The southern boundary goes up to El Arish, which takes in all of northern Sinai, including Yamit. To the east, the frontier runs along the western part of the East Bank of the Jordan River, hence part of what is now Jordan. Eretz Yisrael also includes part of Lebanon and certain parts of Syria, and part of Iraq, all the way to the Euphrates River.\" When critics suggested that following Kahane's plans would mean a perpetual war between Jews and Arabs, Kahane responded, \"There will be a perpetual war. With or without Kahane.\"\nLegacy.\n The prosecution argued that Arab MK Haneen Zoabi should be banned for denying the Jewish people's existence, and she was banned by the Central Elections Committee, which uses the Kahane precedent. A week later, the ruling was unanimously overturned by the Supreme Court. Attempts to ban the Strong Israel and Balad political parties by using the Kahane precedent were also overturned.\nFollowing Kahane's death, no leader emerged to replace him in the movement. However, the idea of transferring populations, attributed mainly to Kahane, was subsequently incorporated into the political platform of several parties in Israel, such as Moledet (applying to Arab non-citizen residents of the West Bank) and Yisrael Beiteinu (in the form of population exchange). Two small Kahanist factions later emerged; one under the name \"Kach\", and the other under the name \"Kahane Chai\" (Hebrew: \u05db\u05d4\u05e0\u05d0 \u05d7\u05d9, literally \"Kahane lives [on]\"), the second one being led by his younger son, Binyamin Ze'ev Kahane. Neither one was permitted to participate in the Knesset elections by the Central Elections Committee.\nIn 1994, following the Cave of the Patriarchs massacre that saw Kach supporter Baruch Goldstein indiscriminately kill 29 Palestinian Muslim worshippers in Hebron, the Israeli government declared both parties to be terrorist organizations. The US State Department also added Kach and Kahane Chai to its list of Foreign Terrorist Organizations.\nIn the 2003 Knesset elections, Herut, which had split off from the National Union list, ran with Michael Kleiner and former Kach activist Baruch Marzel taking the top two spots on the list. The joint effort narrowly missed the 1.5% barrier. In the following 2006 elections, the Jewish National Front, led by Baruch Marzel, fared better, but it also failed to pass the minimum threshold. A follower of Kahane who was involved with Kach for many years, Michael Ben-Ari, was elected to the Knesset in the 2009 elections on renewed National Union list. He stood again in the 2013 elections as the second candidate on the list of Otzma LeYisrael, but the party failed to pass the minimum threshold.\nIn 2007, the FBI released over a thousand documents relating to its daily surveillance of Kahane from the early 1960s.\nIn 2015, Kahane's grandson, Meir Ettinger, was detained by Israeli law enforcement. He was the alleged leader of the radical Jewish group \"The Revolt\". In an online \"manifesto\" echoing some of his grandfather's teachings, Ettinger promotes the \"dispossession of gentiles\" who live in Israel and the establishment of a new \"kingdom of Israel\", a theocracy ruled according to the Halacha. Ettinger's writings condemned Israel's government, mainstream rabbis, and the IDF, and also have denounced Christian churches as \"idolatry\".\nLibby Kahane, his widow, published the first volume of a biography \"Rabbi Meir Kahane: His Life and Thought Vol. One: 1932\u20131975\" around 2008. A contributor to \"Haaretz\" said the book \"lacks serious analysis\", \"ignores important unflattering details\" and \"serves as an apologetic\". In 2016, Libby Kahane claimed that modern Jewish extremists in Israel do not follow the ideology of her late husband. She justified that claim by arguing that, unlike modern Jewish extremists, Rabbi Kahane had a more mature approach that did not encourage illegal activities.\nIn 2017, \"The Forward\" reported that some of Kahane's followers were aligning themselves with white nationalists and the alt-right. Other Kahanists declared that such moves did not reflect Kahane's teachings, and they supported that declaration by arguing that Kahane worked together with African Americans.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\nFor supplementary information and insights:"}
{"id": "20203", "revid": "27015025", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20203", "title": "Marietta Alboni", "text": "Italian opera singer (1826\u20131894)\nMaria Anna Marzia (called Marietta) Alboni (6 March 1826 \u2013 23 June 1894) was an Italian contralto opera singer. She is considered \"one of the greatest contraltos in operatic history\".\nBiography.\nAlboni was born at Citt\u00e0 di Castello, in Umbria. She became a pupil of Antonio Bagioli of Cesena, Emilia\u2013Romagna, and later of the composer Gioachino Rossini, when he was 'perpetual honorary adviser' in (and then the principal of) the Liceo Musicale, now Conservatorio Giovanni Battista Martini, in Bologna. Rossini tested the humble thirteen-year-old girl himself, had her admitted to the school with special treatment, and even procured her an early engagement to tour his \"Stabat Mater\" around Northern Italy, so that she could pay for her studies. After she achieved her diploma and made a modest debut in Bologna, in 1842, as \"Climene\" in Pacini's \"Saffo\", she obtained a triennial engagement thanks to Rossini's influence on the impresario Bartolomeo Merelli, Intendant at both Milan's Teatro alla Scala and Vienna's Imperial K\u00e4rntnertortheater. The favourable contract was signed by Rossini himself, \"on behalf of Eustachio Alboni\", father of Marietta, who was still a minor. The singer remained, throughout her life, deeply grateful to her ancient \"maestro\", nearly a second father to her.\nHer debut at Teatro alla Scala took place in December 1842 as \"Neocle\" in the Italian version of \"Le si\u00e8ge de Corinthe\", which was followed by roles in operas by Marliani, Donizetti (as \"Maffio Orsini\" and \"Leonora\" in the Scala premiere of an Italian version of \"La favorite\"), Salvi and Pacini. In the season 1844\u20131845 she was engaged in the Saint Petersburg Imperial Bolshoi Kamenny Theatre; later, in 1846\u201347, she toured the principal cities of Central Europe, finally reaching London and Paris, where she settled permanently. In London, \"she appeared in leading roles by Rossini and Donizetti (where she outshone Giulia Grisi and Jenny Lind) and also sang Cherubino (performing with Henriette Sontag)\". For the 1848 London run of \"Les Huguenots\", Meyerbeer transposed the role of the page \"Urbain\" 'from soprano to contralto and composed the aria \"Non! \u2013 non, non, non, non, non! Vous n'avez jamais, je gage\" in Act 2' for her. On 28 August 1848, she sang at a concert in Manchester's Concert Hall, sharing the stage with Lorenzo Salvi and Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Chopin. She toured the United States in 1852\u201353, appearing there with Camilla Urso.\nIn 1853 she wed a nobleman, Count Carlo Pepoli, of the Papal States, but she kept her maiden name for the stage. In 1863 she had to retire the first time on account of her husband's serious mental illness. He died in 1867. A year later, in 1868, Alboni would take part in the funeral of her beloved master and friend, Rossini, in the \u00c9glise de la Sainte-Trinit\u00e9. There she sang, alongside Adelina Patti, the leading soprano of the time, a stanza of \"Dies irae\", \"Liber scriptum\", adjusted to the music of the duet \"Quis est Homo\" from Rossini's own \"Stabat Mater\". Out of deference to her master, she also accepted to resume her singing career mainly in order to tour the orchestral version of the \"Petite messe solennelle\" around Europe. Rossini had once expressed his hope that she would take upon herself to perform it when he was dead. He had said that he had composed it, and especially the new section \"O salutaris\", just having her voice in mind.\nIn 1872 she permanently retired from the stage with four performances of \"Fidalma\" in Cimarosa's \"Il matrimonio segreto\", at the Paris Th\u00e9\u00e2tre des Italiens but, in fact, she never gave up singing in private and in benefit concerts. When in 1887 the French and Italian Governments agreed upon moving the mortal remains of Rossini into the Basilica di Santa Croce in Florence, Alboni, then a sixty-one-year-old lady living in seclusion, wrote to the Italian Foreign Minister, Di Robilant, proposing that the \"Petite Messe Solennelle\", \"the last musical composition by Rossini\", be performed in Santa Croce the day of the funeral, and \"demanding the honour, as an Italian and a pupil of the immortal Maestro,\" of singing it herself in her \"dear and beloved homeland\". Her wish, however, never came true and she was just given the chance of being present at the exhumation ceremony in Paris. The Paris correspondent of the Rome newspaper \"Il Fanfulla\" wrote on the occasion: \"photographers snapped in the same shot the greatest performer of \"Cenerentola\" and \"Semiramide\", and what is left of the man who wrote these masterpieces\".\nIn 1877 she had remarried\u2014to a French military officer named Charles Zieger. She died at Ville-d'Avray, near Paris, in her \"Villa La Cenerentola\", and was buried at P\u00e8re Lachaise Cemetery. Always engaged in charity (often in memory of Maestro Rossini), she left nearly all her estate to the poor of Paris. In her will she wrote that by singing she had earned all her fortune, and on singing she would pass away, with the sweet thought that she had employed it to encourage and to console.\nArtistic features.\nAlboni's voice, an exceptionally fine contralto with a seamless compass of two and one-half octaves, extending as high as the soprano range, was said to possess at once power, sweetness, fullness, and extraordinary flexibility. She had no peers in passages requiring a sensitive delivery and semi-religious calmness, owing to the moving quality of her velvety tone. She possessed vivacity, grace, and charm as an actress of the \"com\u00e9dienne\" type; but she was not a natural \"trag\u00e9dienne\", and her attempt at the strongly dramatic part of Norma was sometimes reported to have turned out a failure. Nevertheless, she scored a real triumph in 1850, when she made her operatic debut at the Paris Op\u00e9ra performing the tragic role of \"Fid\u00e8s\" in Meyerbeer's \"Le proph\u00e8te\", which had been created the year before by no less than Pauline Viardot. Furthermore, she was able to cope with such dramatic roles as \"Azucena\" and \"Ulrica\" in Verdi's \"Il trovatore\" and \"Un ballo in maschera\", and even with the baritone role of \"Don Carlo\" in \"Ernani\" (London, 1847).\nRepertoire.\nThe following list of the roles performed by Marietta Alboni was drawn up by Arthur Pougin and published in his biography of the singer. It is reported here with the addition of further works and characters according to the sources stated in footnotes. \nReferences.\nNotes\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources"}
{"id": "20204", "revid": "28481209", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20204", "title": "Manatee", "text": "Genus of mammals\nManatees (, family Trichechidae, genus Trichechus) are large, fully aquatic, mostly herbivorous marine mammals sometimes known as sea cows. There are three accepted living species of Trichechidae, representing three of the four living species in the order Sirenia: the Amazonian manatee (\"Trichechus inunguis\"), the West Indian manatee (\"Trichechus manatus\"), and the West African manatee (\"Trichechus senegalensis\"). They measure up to long, weigh as much as , and have paddle-like tails.\nManatees are herbivores and eat over 60 different freshwater and saltwater plants. Manatees inhabit the shallow, marshy coastal areas and rivers of the Caribbean Sea, the Gulf of Mexico, the Amazon basin, and West Africa.\nThe main causes of death for manatees are human-related issues, such as habitat destruction and human objects. Their slow-moving, curious nature has led to violent collisions with propeller-driven boats and ships. Some manatees have been found with over 50 scars on them from propeller blades. Natural causes of death include adverse temperatures, predation by crocodiles on young, and disease.\nEtymology.\nThe etymology of the name is unclear, with connections having been made to Latin \"hand\" and to the term \"manaty\" \"breast\" from the Carib language of native South Americans. The Carib term may refer to the mammary glands of the manatee, which are located on their chests under their armpits. The term \"sea cow\" is a reference to the species' slow, peaceful, herbivorous nature, reminiscent of that of bovines. \"Lamantin\" (from French ) was commonly used as an alternative name until the 20th century.\nTaxonomy.\nManatees are three of the four living species in the order Sirenia. The fourth is the Eastern Hemisphere's dugong. The Sirenia are thought to have evolved from four-legged land mammals more than 60 million years ago, with the closest living relatives being the Proboscidea (elephants) and Hyracoidea (hyraxes).\nDescription.\nManatees weigh , and average in length, sometimes growing to and and females tend to be larger and heavier than males. At birth, baby manatees weigh about each. The female manatee has two teats, one under each flipper, a characteristic that was used to make early links between the manatee and elephants.\nThe lids of manatees' small, widely spaced eyes close in a circular manner. The manatee has a large, flexible, prehensile upper lip, used to gather food and eat and for social interaction and communication. Manatees have shorter snouts than their fellow sirenians, the dugongs.\nManatee adults have no incisor or canine teeth, just a set of cheek teeth, which are not clearly differentiated into molars and premolars. These teeth are repeatedly replaced throughout life, with new teeth growing at the rear as older teeth fall out from farther forward in the mouth, somewhat as elephants' teeth do. At any time, a manatee typically has no more than six teeth in each jaw of its mouth.\nThe manatee's tail is paddle-shaped, and is the clearest visible difference between manatees and dugongs; a dugong tail is fluked, similar in shape to that of a whale.\nThe manatee is unusual among mammals in having just six cervical vertebrae, a number that may be due to mutations in the homeotic genes. All other mammals have seven cervical vertebrae, other than the two-toed and three-toed sloths.\nLike the horse, the manatee has a simple stomach, but a large cecum, in which it can digest tough plant matter. Generally, the intestines are about 45 meters, unusually long for an animal of the manatee's size.\nEvolution.\nFossil remains of manatee ancestors - also known as sirenians - date back to the Early Eocene. It is thought that they reached the isolated area of the South American continent and became known as Trichechidae. In the Late Miocene, trichechids were likely restricted in South American coastal rivers and they fed on many freshwater plants. Dugongs inhabited the West Atlantic and Caribbean waters and fed on seagrass meadows instead. As the sea grasses began to grow, manatees adapted to the changing environment by growing supernumerary molars. Sea levels lowered and increased erosion and silt runoff was caused by glaciation. This increased the tooth wear of the bottom-feeding manatees.\nBehavior.\nApart from mothers with their young, or males following a receptive female, manatees are generally solitary animals. Manatees spend approximately 50% of the day sleeping submerged, surfacing for air regularly at intervals of less than 20 minutes. The remainder of the time is mostly spent grazing in shallow waters at depths of . The Florida subspecies (\"T. m. latirostris\") has been known to live up to 60 years.\nLocomotion.\nGenerally, manatees swim at about . However, they have been known to swim at up to in short bursts.\nIntelligence and learning.\nManatees are capable of understanding discrimination tasks and show signs of complex associative learning. They also have good long-term memory. They demonstrate discrimination and task-learning abilities similar to dolphins and pinnipeds in acoustic and visual studies. Social interactions between manatees are highly complex and intricate, which may indicate higher intelligence than previously thought, although they remain poorly understood by science.\nReproduction.\nManatees typically breed once every two years; generally only a single calf is born. Gestation lasts about 12 months and to wean the calf takes a further 12 to 18 months, although females may have more than one estrous cycle per year.\nCommunication.\nManatees emit a wide range of sounds used in communication, especially between cows and their calves. Their ears are large internally but the external openings are small, and they are located four inches behind each eye. Adults communicate to maintain contact and during sexual and play behaviors. Taste and smell, in addition to sight, sound, and touch, may also be forms of communication.\nDiet.\nManatees are herbivores and eat over 60 different freshwater (e.g., floating hyacinth, pickerel weed, alligator weed, water lettuce, hydrilla, water celery, musk grass, mangrove leaves) and saltwater plants (e.g., sea grasses, shoal grass, manatee grass, turtle grass, widgeon grass, sea clover, and marine algae). Using their divided upper lip, an adult manatee will commonly eat up to 10%\u201315% of their body weight (about 50\u00a0kg) per day. Consuming such an amount requires the manatee to graze for up to seven hours a day. To be able to cope with the high levels of cellulose in their plant based diet, manatees utilize hindgut fermentation to help with the digestion process. Manatees have been known to eat small numbers of fish from nets.\nFeeding behavior.\nManatees use their flippers to \"walk\" along the bottom whilst they dig for plants and roots in the substrate. When plants are detected, the flippers are used to scoop the vegetation toward the manatee's lips. The manatee has prehensile lips; the upper lip pad is split into left and right sides which can move independently. The lips use seven muscles to manipulate and tear at plants. Manatees use their lips and front flippers to move the plants into the mouth. The manatee does not have front teeth, however, behind the lips, on the roof of the mouth, there are dense, ridged pads. These horny ridges, and the manatee's lower jaw, tear through ingested plant material.\nDentition.\nManatees have four rows of teeth. There are 6 to 8 high-crowned, open-rooted molars located along each side of the upper and lower jaw giving a total of 24 to 32 flat, rough-textured teeth. Eating gritty vegetation abrades the teeth, particularly the enamel crown; however, research indicates that the enamel structure in manatee molars is weak. To compensate for this, manatee teeth are continually replaced. When anterior molars wear down, they are shed. Posterior molars erupt at the back of the row and slowly move forward to replace these like enamel crowns on a conveyor belt, similarly to elephants. This process continues throughout the manatee's lifetime. The rate at which the teeth migrate forward depends on how quickly the anterior teeth abrade. Some studies indicate that the rate is about 1\u00a0cm/month although other studies indicate 0.1\u00a0cm/month.\nEcology.\nRange and habitat.\nManatees inhabit the shallow, marshy coastal areas and rivers of the Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico (\"T. manatus\", West Indian manatee), the Amazon basin (\"T. inunguis\", Amazonian manatee), and West Africa (\"T. senegalensis\", West African manatee).\nWest Indian manatees prefer warmer temperatures and are known to congregate in shallow waters. They frequently migrate through brackish water estuaries to freshwater springs. They cannot survive below 15\u00a0\u00b0C (60\u00a0\u00b0F). Their natural source for warmth during winter is warm, spring-fed rivers.\nWest Indian.\nThe coast of the state of Georgia is usually the northernmost range of the West Indian manatees because their low metabolic rate does not protect them in cold water. Prolonged exposure to water below 20\u00a0\u00b0C (68\u00a0\u00b0F)\u00a0can cause \"cold stress syndrome\" and death.\nWest Indian manatees can move freely between fresh water and salt water. However, studies suggest that they are susceptible to dehydration if freshwater is not available for an extended period of time.\nManatees can travel hundreds of miles annually, and have been seen as far north as Cape Cod, and in 1995 and again in 2006, one was seen in New York City and Rhode Island's Narragansett Bay. A manatee was spotted in the Wolf River harbor near the Mississippi River in downtown Memphis in 2006, and was later found dead downriver in McKellar Lake. Another manatee was found dead on a New Jersey beach in February 2020, considered especially unusual given the time of year. At the time of the manatee's discovery, the water temperature in the area was below 6.5\u00a0\u00b0C (43.7\u00a0\u00b0F).\nThe West Indian manatee migrates into Florida rivers\u2014such as the Crystal, the Homosassa, and the Chassahowitzka rivers, whose headsprings are 22\u00a0\u00b0C (72\u00a0\u00b0F) all year. Between November and March each year, about 600 West Indian manatees gather in the rivers in Citrus County, Florida such as the Crystal River National Wildlife Refuge.\nIn winter, manatees often gather near the warm-water outflows of power plants along the Florida coast, instead of migrating south as they once did. Some conservationists are concerned that these manatees have become too reliant on these artificially warmed areas. \nAccurate population estimates of the West Indian manatee in Florida are difficult. They have been called scientifically weak because they vary widely from year to year, with most areas showing decreases, and little strong evidence of increases except in two areas. Manatee counts are highly variable without an accurate way to estimate numbers. In Florida in 1996, a winter survey found 2,639 manatees; in 1997, a January survey found 2,229, and a February survey found 1,706. A statewide synoptic survey in January 2010 found 5,067 manatees living in Florida, the highest number recorded to that time.\nAs of January 2016, the USFWS estimates the range-wide West Indian manatee population to be at least 13,000; as of January 2018, at least 6,100 are estimated to be in Florida.\nPopulation viability studies conducted in 1997 found that decreasing adult survival and eventual extinction were probable future outcomes for Florida manatees unless they received more protection. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service proposed downgrading the manatee's status from endangered to threatened in January 2016 after more than 40 years.\nThere is a small population of the subspecies Antillean manatee (\"T. m. manatus\") found in Mexico's Caribbean coastal area. The best estimate for this population is 200-250. As of 2022, a new manatee habitat was discovered by Klaus Thymann within the cenotes of Sian Ka'an Biosphere Reserve on the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula. The explorer and his team documented the discovery with a 12-minute film that is available on the interactive streaming platform WaterBear. The discovery got picked up by the New Scientist in 2024, who featured in a 10-minute short film.\nAmazonian.\nThe freshwater Amazonian manatee (\"T. inunguis\") inhabits the Central Amazon Basin in Brazil, eastern Per\u00fa, southeastern Colombia, but not Ecuador. It is the only exclusively freshwater manatee, and is also the smallest. Since they are unable to reduce peripheral heat loss, it is found primarily in tropical waters.\nWest African.\nThey are found in coastal marine and estuarine habitats, and in freshwater river systems along the west coast of Africa from the Senegal River south to the Cuanza River in Angola. They live as far upriver on the Niger River as Koulikoro in Mali, from the coast.\nPredation.\nIn relation to the threat posed by humans, predation does not present a significant threat to manatees. When threatened, the manatee's response is to dive as deeply as it can, suggesting that threats have most frequently come from land dwellers such as humans rather than from other water-dwelling creatures such as caimans or sharks.\nRelation to humans.\nThreats.\nThe main causes of death for manatees are human-related issues, such as habitat destruction and human objects. Natural causes of death include adverse temperatures, predation by crocodiles on young, and disease.\nShip strikes.\nTheir slow-moving, curious nature, coupled with dense coastal development, has led to many violent collisions with propeller-driven boats and ships, leading frequently to maiming, disfigurement, and even death. As a result, a large proportion of manatees exhibit spiral cutting propeller scars on their backs, usually caused by larger vessels that do not have skegs in front of the propellers like the smaller outboard and inboard-outboard recreational boats have. They are now even identified by humans based on their scar patterns. Many manatees have been cut in two by large vessels like ships and tug boats, even in the highly populated lower St. Johns River's narrow channels. Some are concerned that the current situation is inhumane, with upwards of 50 scars and disfigurements from vessel strikes on a single manatee. Often, the lacerations lead to infections, which can prove fatal. Internal injuries stemming from being trapped between hulls and docks and impacts have also been fatal. Testing and studies from the 2000s and 2010s suggested that manatees may be able to hear speed boats and other watercraft approaching, due to the frequency the boat makes. However, a manatee may not be able to hear the approaching boats when they are performing day-to-day activities or distractions. The manatee has a tested frequency range of 8 to 32 kilohertz.\nManatees hear on a higher frequency than would be expected for such large marine mammals. Many large boats emit very low frequencies, which confuse the manatee and explain their lack of awareness around boats. The Lloyd's mirror effect results in low frequency propeller sounds not being discernible near the surface, where most accidents occur. Research indicates that when a boat has a higher frequency the manatees rapidly swim away from danger.\nIn 2003, a population model was released by the United States Geological Survey that predicted an extremely grave situation confronting the manatee in both the Southwest and Atlantic regions where the vast majority of manatees are found. It states,\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nAccording to marine mammal veterinarians:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nThese veterinarians go on to state:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;[T]he overwhelming documentation of gruesome wounding of manatees leaves no room for denial. Minimization of this injury is \"explicit\" in the Recovery Plan, several state statutes, and federal laws, and \"implicit\" in our society's ethical and moral standards.\nOne quarter of annual manatee deaths in Florida are caused by boat collisions with manatees. In 2009, of the 429 Florida manatees recorded dead, 97 were killed by commercial and recreational vessels, which broke the earlier record number of 95 set in 2002.\nRed tide.\nAnother cause of manatee deaths are red tides, a term used for the proliferation, or \"blooms\", of the microscopic marine algae \"Karenia brevis\". This dinoflagellate produces brevetoxins that can have toxic effects on the central nervous system of animals.\nIn 1996, a red tide was responsible for 151 manatee deaths in Florida. The bloom was present from early March to the end of April and killed approximately 15% of the known population of manatees along South Florida's western coast. Other blooms in 1982 and 2005 resulted in 37 and 44 deaths respectively, and a red tide killed 123 manatees between November 2022 and June 2023.\nStarvation.\nIn 2021 a massive die-off of seagrass along the Atlantic coast of Florida left manatees without enough food to eat, and they began dying at high rates. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service responded with a feeding program that distributing 3,000 pounds (1,361\u00a0kg) of lettuce per day to the manatee population.\nAdditional threats.\nManatees can also be crushed and isolated in water control structures (navigation locks, floodgates, etc.) and are occasionally killed by entanglement in fishing gear, such as crab pot float lines, box traps, and shark nets.\nWhile humans are allowed to swim with manatees in one area of Florida, there have been numerous charges of people harassing and disturbing the manatees. According to the United States Fish and Wildlife Service, approximately 99 manatee deaths each year are related to human activities. In January 2016, there were 43 manatee deaths in Florida alone.\nConservation.\nAll three species of manatee are listed by the World Conservation Union as vulnerable to extinction. However, The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) does not consider the West Indian manatee to be \"endangered\" anymore, having downgraded its status to \"threatened\" as of March 2017. They cite improvements to habitat conditions, population growth and reductions of threats as reasoning for the change. The reclassification was met with controversy, with Florida congressman Vern Buchanan and groups such as the Save the Manatee Club and the Center for Biological Diversity expressing concerns that the change would have a detrimental effect on conservation efforts. The new classification will not affect current federal protections. West Indian manatees were originally classified as endangered with the 1967 class of endangered species.\nManatee deaths in the state of Florida nearly doubled in 2021 from 637 (2020) to 1100. Although this number decreased to 800 in 2022, it is likely that current rate of development in Florida, climate change, and decreasing water quality, habitat range, and genetic diversity among this population may lead to reconsideration of the West Indian Manatee as an endangered species. Manatee population in the United States reached a low in the 1970s, during which only a few hundred individuals lived in the nation. As of February 2016, 6,250 manatees were reported swimming in Florida's springs. It is illegal under federal and Florida law to injure or harm a manatee.\nAlso in Florida, due to extensive destruction of their habitat, manatees rely on the warm waters created by a major power plant's hot water effluent streams to survive during the cold winter months. Manatee reliance on these effluent streams is such that the streams are protected under federal environmental legislation. Researchers have theorized that the prevalence of manatee sightings near this power plant is contributing to \"collective inattention\" to industrialization and development as ongoing causes of manatee habitat destruction. \u00a0\nThere are many conservation programs that have been created to help manatees. Save the Manatee Club is a non-profit group and membership organization that works to protect manatees and their aquatic ecosystems. Founded by Bob Graham, former Florida governor, and singer/songwriter Jimmy Buffett, this is today's leading manatee conservation club.\nThe MV \"Freedom Star\" and MV \"Liberty Star\", ships used by NASA to tow Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Boosters back to Kennedy Space Center, were propelled only by water jets to protect the endangered manatee population that inhabits regions of the Banana River where the ships are based.\nBrazil outlawed hunting in 1973 in an effort to preserve the species. Deaths by boat strikes are still common. Although countries are protecting Amazonian manatees in the locations where they are endangered, as of 1994 there were no enforced laws, and the manatees were still being captured throughout their range.\nCaptivity.\nThere are a number of manatee rehabilitation centers in the United States. These include three government-run critical care facilities in Florida at Lowry Park Zoo, Miami Seaquarium, and SeaWorld Orlando. After initial treatment at these facilities, the manatees are transferred to rehabilitation facilities before release. These include the Cincinnati Zoo and Botanical Garden, Columbus Zoo and Aquarium, Epcot's The Seas, South Florida Museum, and Homosassa Springs Wildlife State Park.\nThe Columbus Zoo was a founding member of the Manatee Rehabilitation Partnership in 2001. Since 1999, the zoo's Manatee Bay facility has helped rehabilitate 20 manatees. The Cincinnati Zoo has rehabilitated and released more than a dozen manatees since 1999.\nManatees can also be viewed in a number of European zoos, such as the Tierpark Berlin and the Nuremberg Zoo in Germany, in ZooParc de Beauval in France, the Aquarium of Genoa in Italy and the Royal Burgers' Zoo in Arnhem, the Netherlands, where manatees have parented offspring. The River Safari at Singapore features seven of them.\nThe oldest manatee in captivity was Snooty, at the South Florida Museum's Parker Manatee Aquarium in Bradenton, Florida. Born at the Miami Aquarium and Tackle Company on July 21, 1948, Snooty was one of the first recorded captive manatee births. Raised entirely in captivity, Snooty was never to be released into the wild. As such he was the only manatee at the aquarium, and one of only a few captive manatees in the United States that was allowed to interact with human handlers. That made him uniquely suitable for manatee research and education.\nSnooty died suddenly two days after his 69th birthday, July 23, 2017, when he was found in an underwater area only used to access plumbing for the exhibit life support system. The South Florida Museum's initial press release stated, \"Early indications are that an access panel door that is normally bolted shut had somehow been knocked loose and that Snooty was able to swim in.\"\nGuyana.\nSince the 19th century, Georgetown, Guyana has kept West Indian manatees in its botanical garden, and later, its national park.\nIn the 1910s and again in the 1950s, sugar estates in Guyana used manatees to keep their irrigation canals weed-free.\nBetween the 1950s and 1970s, the Georgetown water treatment plant used manatees in their storage canals for the same purpose.\nCulture.\nThe manatee has been linked to folklore on mermaids. In West African folklore, they were considered sacred and thought to have been once human. Killing one was taboo and required penance. In the cosmogony of the Serer people of Senegal, Gambia, and Mauritania, the cayman and the manatee holds great significance in Serer mythology. The cayman is believed to hold the secrets of the past whilst the manatee holds the secrets of the future.\nIn the novel \"Moby-Dick\", Herman Melville distinguishes manatees (\"Lamatins\", cf. \"lamantins\") from small whales; stating, \"I am aware that down to the present time, the fish styled Lamatins and Dugongs (Pig-fish and Sow-fish of the Coffins of Nantucket) are included by many naturalists among the whales. But as these pig-fish are a noisy, contemptible set, mostly lurking in the mouths of rivers, and feeding on wet hay, and especially as they do not spout, I deny their credentials as whales; and have presented them with their passports to quit the Kingdom of Cetology.\"\nA manatee called Wardell appears in the \"\" video game. He is part of a paid downloadable content expansion, managing and selling furniture to the player.\nIn Rudyard Kipling's \"The White Seal\" (one of the stories in \"The Jungle Book\"), Sea Cow, about whom the story says that he has only six cervical vertebrae, is a manatee.\nThe manatees Friends West Indian Manatee, Dugong, and Steller's Sea Cow appear in multiple \"Kemono Friends\" games, including the app version of Kemono Friends 3.\nIn the Neapolitan region of Italy, a culinary legend exists around the consumption of manatees during World War II. In the story, when Naples and Salerno surrended to the Allies in 1943, the cities, lacking food supplies thanked the Allied generals by serving manatee from the aquarium. When this was revealed, the popular reaction was not shock, but questions over how it was prepared, to which the answer was \"aglio-olio [garlic and olive oil], of course, with a little parsley.\" \nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "20205", "revid": "40943757", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20205", "title": "Marsupial", "text": "Infraclass of mammals in the clade Metatheria\nMarsupials are a diverse group of mammals belonging to the infraclass Marsupialia. They are natively found in Australasia, Wallacea, and the Americas. One of marsupials' unique features is their reproductive strategy: the young are born in a relatively undeveloped state and then nurtured within a pouch on their mother's abdomen.\nExtant marsupials encompass many species, including kangaroos, koalas, opossums, possums, Tasmanian devils, wombats, wallabies, and bandicoots.\nMarsupials constitute a clade stemming from the last common ancestor of extant Metatheria, which encompasses all mammals more closely related to marsupials than to placentals. The evolutionary split between placentals and marsupials occurred 125\u2013160 million years ago in the Middle Jurassic\u2013Early Cretaceous period.\nPresently, close to 70% of the 334 extant marsupial species are concentrated on the Australian continent, including mainland Australia, Tasmania, New Guinea, and nearby islands. The remaining 30% are distributed across the Americas, primarily in South America, with thirteen species in Central America and a single species, the Virginia opossum, inhabiting North America north of Mexico.\nMarsupial sizes range from a few grams in the long-tailed planigale, to several tons in the extinct \"Diprotodon\".\nThe word \"marsupial\" comes from \"marsupium\", the technical term for the abdominal pouch. It, in turn, is borrowed from the Latin and ultimately from the ancient Greek , meaning \"pouch\".\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:TOC limit/styles.css\" /&gt;\nAnatomy.\nMarsupials have typical mammalian characteristics, e.g., mammary glands, three middle ear bones (and ears that usually have tragi, varying in hearing thresholds), true hair and bone structure. However, striking differences including anatomical features separate them from eutherians.\nMost female marsupials have a front pouch, which contains multiple nursing teats. Marsupials have other common structural features. Ossified patellae are absent in most modern marsupials (with exceptions) and epipubic bones are present. Marsupials (and monotremes) also lack a gross communication (corpus callosum) between the right and left brain hemispheres.\nSkull and teeth.\nMarsupials exhibit distinct cranial features compared to placentals. Generally, their skulls are relatively small and compact. Notably, they possess frontal holes known as foramen lacrimale situated at the front of the orbit. Marsupials have enlarged cheekbones that extend further to the rear, and their lower jaw's angular extension (\"processus angularis\") is bent toward the center. The hard palate of marsupials contains more openings than that of placentals.\nTeeth differ significantly. Most Australian marsupials outside the order Diprotodontia have a varying number of incisors between their upper and lower jaws. Early marsupials had a dental formula of 5.1.3.4/4.1.3.4 per quadrant, consisting of five (maxillary) or four (mandibular) incisors, one canine, three premolars, and four molars, totaling 50 teeth. While some taxa, like the opossum, retain this original tooth count, others have reduced numbers.\nFor instance, members of the Macropodidae family, including kangaroos and wallabies, have a dental formula of 3/1 \u2013 (0 or 1)/0 \u2013 2/2 \u2013 4/4. Many marsupials typically have between 40 and 50 teeth, more than most placentals. In marsupials, the second set of teeth only grows in at the site of the third premolar and posteriorly; all teeth anterior to this erupt initially as permanent teeth.\nTorso.\nFew general characteristics describe their skeleton. In addition to unique details in the construction of the ankle, epipubic bones (\"ossa epubica\") are observed projecting forward from the pubic bone of the pelvis. Since these are present in males and pouchless species, it is believed that they originally had nothing to do with reproduction, but served in the muscular approach to the movement of the hind limbs. This could be explained by an original feature of mammals, as these epipubic bones are also found in monotremes. Marsupial reproductive organs differ from placentals. For them, the reproductive tract is doubled. Females have two uteri and two vaginas, and before birth, a birth canal forms between them, the median vagina. In most species, males have a split or double penis lying in front of the scrotum, which is not homologous to the placental scrota.\nA pouch is present in most species. Many marsupials have a permanent bag, while in others such as the shrew opossum the pouch develops during gestation, where the young are hidden only by skin folds or in the maternal fur. The arrangement of the pouch is variable to allow the offspring to receive maximum protection. Locomotive kangaroos have a pouch opening at the front, while many others that walk or climb on all fours open in the back. Usually, only females have a pouch, but the male water opossum has a pouch that protects his genitalia while swimming or running.\nGeneral and convergences.\nMarsupials have adapted to many habitats, reflected in the wide variety in their build. The largest living marsupial, the red kangaroo, grows up to in height and in weight. Extinct genera, such as \"Diprotodon\", were significantly larger and heavier. The smallest marsupials are the marsupial mice, which reach only in body length.\nSome species resemble placentals and are examples of convergent evolution. This convergence is evident in both brain evolution and behaviour. The extinct thylacine strongly resembled the placental wolf, hence one of its nicknames \"Tasmanian wolf\". The ability to glide evolved in both marsupials (as with sugar gliders) and some placentals (as with flying squirrels), which developed independently. Other groups such as the kangaroo, however, do not have clear placental counterparts, though they share similarities in lifestyle and ecological niches with ruminants.\nBody temperature.\nMarsupials, along with monotremes (platypuses and echidnas), typically have lower body temperatures than similarly sized placentals (eutherians), with the averages being for marsupials and for placentals. Some species will bask to conserve energy \nReproductive system.\nMarsupials' reproductive systems differ markedly from those of placentals. During embryonic development, a choriovitelline placenta forms in all marsupials. In bandicoots, an additional chorioallantoic placenta forms, although it lacks the chorionic villi found in eutherian placentas.\nBoth sexes possess a cloaca, although modified by connecting to a urogenital sac and having a separate anal region in most species. The bladder of marsupials functions as a site to concentrate urine and empties into the common urogenital sinus in both females and males.\nMales.\nMost male marsupials, except for macropods and marsupial moles, have a bifurcated penis, separated into two columns, so that the penis has two ends corresponding to the females' two vaginas. The penis is used only during copulation, and is separate from the urinary tract. It curves forward when erect, and when not erect, it is retracted into the body in an S-shaped curve. Neither marsupials nor monotremes possess a baculum. The shape of the glans penis varies among marsupial species.\nThe shape of the urethral grooves of the males' genitalia is used to distinguish between \"Monodelphis brevicaudata\", \"M. domestica\", and \"M. americana\". The grooves form two channels that form the ventral and dorsal folds of the erectile tissue. Several species of dasyurid marsupials can also be distinguished by their penis morphology. Marsupials' only accessory sex glands are the prostate and bulbourethral glands. Male marsupials have one to three pairs of bulbourethral glands. Ampullae of vas deferens, seminal vesicles or coagulating glands are not present. The prostate is proportionally larger in marsupials than in placentals. During the breeding season, the male tammar wallaby's prostate and bulbourethral gland enlarge. However, the weight of the testes does not vary seasonally.\nFemales.\nFemale marsupials have two lateral vaginas, which lead to separate uteri, both accessed through the same orifice. A third canal, the median vagina, is used for birth. This canal can be transitory or permanent. Some marsupial species store sperm in the oviduct after mating.\nMarsupials give birth very early in gestation; after birth, newborns crawl up their mothers' bodies and attach themselves to a teat, which is located on the underside of the mother, either inside a pouch called the marsupium, or externally. Mothers often lick their fur to leave a trail of scent for the newborn to follow to increase their chances of reaching the marsupium. There they remain for several weeks. Offspring eventually leave the marsupium for short periods, returning to it for warmth, protection, and nourishment.\nEarly development.\nGestation differs between marsupials and placentals. Key aspects of the first stages of placental embryo development, such as the inner cell mass and the process of compaction, are not found in marsupials. The cleavage stages of marsupial development vary among groups and aspects of marsupial early development are not yet fully understood.\nMarsupials have a short gestation period \u2013 typically between 12 and 33 days, but as low as 10 days in the case of the stripe-faced dunnart and as long as 38 days for the long-nosed potoroo. The baby (joey) is born in a fetal state, equivalent to an 8\u201312 week human fetus, blind, furless, and small in comparison to placental newborns: sizes range from 4\u2013800g+. A newborn can be categorized in one of three grades of development. The least developed are found in dasyurids, intermediates are found in didelphids and peramelids, and the most developed are macropods. The newborn crawls across its mother's fur to reach the pouch, where it latches onto a teat. It does not emerge for several months, during which time it relies on its mother's milk for essential nutrients, growth factors and immunological defence. Genes expressed in the eutherian placenta needed for the later stages of fetal development are expressed in females in their mammary glands during lactation. After this period, the joey spends increasing periods out of the pouch, feeding and learning survival skills. However, it returns to the pouch to sleep, and if danger threatens, it seeks refuge in its mother's pouch.\nAn early birth removes a developing marsupial from its mother's body much sooner than in placentals; thus marsupials lack a complex placenta to protect the embryo from its mother's immune system. Though early birth puts the newborn at greater environmental risk, it significantly reduces the dangers associated with long pregnancies, as the fetus cannot compromise the mother in bad seasons. Marsupials are altricial animals, needing intensive care following birth (cf. precocial). Newborns lack histologically mature immune tissues and are highly reliant on their mother's immune system for immunological protection.\nNewborns front limbs and facial structures are much more developed than the rest of their bodies at birth. This requirement has been argued to have limited the range of locomotor adaptations in marsupials compared to placentals. Marsupials must develop grasping forepaws early, complicating the evolutive transition from these limbs into hooves, wings, or flippers. However, several marsupials do possess atypical forelimb morphologies, such as the hooved forelimbs of the pig-footed bandicoot, suggesting that the range of forelimb specialization is not as limited as assumed.\nJoeys stay in the pouch for up to a year or until the next joey arrives. Joeys are unable to regulate their body temperature and rely upon an external heat source. Until the joey is well-furred and old enough to leave the pouch, a pouch temperature of must be constantly maintained.\nJoeys are born with \"oral shields\", soft tissue that reduces the mouth opening to a round hole just large enough to accept the teat. Once inside the mouth, a bulbous swelling on the end of the teat attaches it to the offspring till it has grown large enough to let go. In species without pouches or with rudimentary pouches these are more developed than in forms with well-developed pouches, implying an increased role in ensuring that the young remain attached to the teat.\nRange.\nIn Australasia, marsupials are found in Australia, Tasmania and New Guinea; throughout the Maluku Islands, Timor and Sulawesi to the west of New Guinea, and in the Bismarck Archipelago (including the Admiralty Islands) and Solomon Islands to the east of New Guinea.\nIn the Americas, marsupials are found throughout South America, excluding the central/southern Andes and parts of Patagonia; and through Central America and south-central Mexico, with a single species (the Virginia opossum \"Didelphis virginiana\") widespread in the eastern United States and along the Pacific coast.\nInteraction with Europeans.\nEuropeans' first encounter with a marsupial was the common opossum. Vicente Y\u00e1\u00f1ez Pinz\u00f3n, commander of the \"Ni\u00f1a\" on Christopher Columbus' first voyage in the late fifteenth century, collected a female opossum with young in her pouch off the South American coast. He presented them to the Spanish monarchs, though by then the young were lost and the female had died. The animal was noted for its strange pouch or \"second belly\".\nThe Portuguese first described Australasian marsupials: Ant\u00f3nio Galv\u00e3o, a Portuguese administrator in Ternate (1536\u20131540), wrote a detailed account of the northern common cuscus (\"Phalanger orientalis\"):\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Some animals resemble ferrets, only a little bigger. They are called Kusus. They have a long tail with which they hang from the trees in which they live continuously, winding it once or twice around a branch. On their belly they have a pocket like an intermediate balcony; as soon as they give birth to a young one, they grow it inside there at a teat until it does not need nursing anymore. As soon as she has borne and nourished it, the mother becomes pregnant again.\nIn the 17th century, more accounts of marsupials emerged. A 1606 record of an animal killed on the southern coast of New Guinea, described it as \"in the shape of a dog, smaller than a greyhound\", with a snakelike \"bare scaly tail\" and hanging testicles. The meat tasted like venison, and the stomach contained ginger leaves. This description appears to closely resemble the dusky pademelon (\"Thylogale brunii\"), the earliest European record of a member of the Macropodidae.\nTaxonomy.\nMarsupials are taxonomically identified as members of mammalian infraclass Marsupialia, first described as a family under the order Pollicata by German zoologist Johann Karl Wilhelm Illiger in his 1811 work \"Prodromus Systematis Mammalium et Avium\". However, James Rennie, author of \"The Natural History of Monkeys, Opossums and Lemurs\" (1838), pointed out that the placement of five different groups of mammals \u2013 monkeys, lemurs, tarsiers, aye-ayes and marsupials (with the exception of kangaroos, which were placed under the order Salientia) \u2013 under a single order (Pollicata) did not appear to have a strong justification. In 1816, French zoologist George Cuvier classified all marsupials under Marsupialia. In 1997, researcher J. A. W. Kirsch and others accorded infraclass rank to Marsupialia.\nClassification.\nWith seven living orders in total, Marsupialia is further divided as follows:\u2020 \u2013 Extinct\nEvolutionary history.\nComprising over 300 extant species, several attempts have been made to accurately interpret the phylogenetic relationships among the different marsupial orders. Studies differ on whether Didelphimorphia or Paucituberculata is a sister group to all other marsupials. Though the order Microbiotheria (which has only one species, the monito del monte) is found in South America, morphological similarities suggest it is closely related to Australian marsupials. Molecular analyses in 2010 and 2011 identified Microbiotheria as a sister group to all Australian marsupials. However, the relations among the four Australidelphid orders are not as well understood.\nDNA evidence supports a South American origin for marsupials, with Australian marsupials arising from a single Gondwanan migration of marsupials from South America, across the Antarctic land bridge, to Australia. There are many small arboreal species in each group. The term \"opossum\" is used to refer to American species (though \"possum\" is a common abbreviation), while similar Australian species are properly called \"possums\".\nThe relationships among the three extant divisions of mammals (monotremes, marsupials, and placentals) were long a matter of debate among taxonomists. Most morphological evidence comparing traits such as number and arrangement of teeth and structure of the reproductive and waste elimination systems as well as most genetic and molecular evidence favors a closer evolutionary relationship between the marsupials and placentals than either has with the monotremes.\nThe ancestors of marsupials, part of a larger group called metatherians, probably split from those of placentals (eutherians) during the mid-Jurassic period, though no fossil evidence of metatherians themselves are known from this time. From DNA and protein analyses, the time of divergence of the two lineages has been estimated to be around 100 to 120 mya. Fossil metatherians are distinguished from eutherians by the form of their teeth; metatherians possess four pairs of molar teeth in each jaw, whereas eutherian mammals (including true placentals) never have more than three pairs. Using this criterion, the earliest known metatherian was thought to be \"Sinodelphys szalayi\", which lived in China around 125 mya. However \"Sinodelphys\" was later reinterpreted as an early member of Eutheria. The unequivocal oldest known metatherians are now 110 million years old fossils from western North America. Metatherians were widespread in North America and Asia during the Late Cretaceous, but suffered a severe decline during the end-Cretaceous extinction event.\nCladogram from Wilson et al. (2016)\nIn 2022, a study provided strong evidence that the earliest known marsupial was \"Deltatheridium\" known from specimens from the Campanian age of the Late Cretaceous in Mongolia. This study placed both \"Deltatheridium\" and \"Pucadelphys\" as sister taxa to the modern large American opossums.\nMarsupials spread to South America from North America during the Paleocene, possibly via the Aves Ridge. Northern Hemisphere metatherians, which were of low morphological and species diversity compared to contemporary placental mammals, eventually became extinct during the Miocene epoch.\nIn South America, the opossums evolved and developed a strong presence, and the Paleogene also saw the evolution of shrew opossums (Paucituberculata) alongside non-marsupial metatherian predators such as the borhyaenids and the saber-toothed \"Thylacosmilus\". South American niches for mammalian carnivores were dominated by these marsupial and sparassodont metatherians, which seem to have competitively excluded South American placentals from evolving carnivory. While placental predators were absent, the metatherians did have to contend with avian (terror bird) and terrestrial crocodylomorph competition. Marsupials were excluded in turn from large herbivore niches in South America by the presence of native placental ungulates (now extinct) and xenarthrans (whose largest forms are also extinct). South America and Antarctica remained connected until 35 mya, as shown by the unique fossils found there. North and South America were disconnected until about three million years ago, when the Isthmus of Panama formed. This led to the Great American Interchange. Sparassodonts disappeared for unclear reasons \u2013 again, this has classically assumed as competition from carnivoran placentals, but the last sparassodonts co-existed with a few small carnivorans like procyonids and canines, and disappeared long before the arrival of macropredatory forms like felines, while didelphimorphs (opossums) invaded Central America, with the Virginia opossum reaching as far north as Canada.\nMarsupials reached Australia via the Antarctic Land Bridge during the Early Eocene, around 50 mya, shortly after Australia had split off. This suggests a single dispersion event of just one species, most likely a relative to South America's monito del monte (a microbiothere, the only New World australidelphian). This progenitor may have rafted across the widening, but still narrow, gap between Australia and Antarctica. The journey must not have been easy; South American ungulate and xenarthran remains have been found in Antarctica, but these groups did not reach Australia.\nIn Australia, marsupials radiated into the wide variety seen today, including not only omnivorous and carnivorous forms such as were present in South America, but also into large herbivores. Modern marsupials appear to have reached the islands of New Guinea and Sulawesi relatively recently via Australia. A 2010 analysis of retroposon insertion sites in the nuclear DNA of a variety of marsupials has confirmed all living marsupials have South American ancestors. The branching sequence of marsupial orders indicated by the study puts Didelphimorphia in the most basal position, followed by Paucituberculata, then Microbiotheria, and ending with the radiation of Australian marsupials. This indicates that Australidelphia arose in South America, and reached Australia after Microbiotheria split off.\nIn Australia, terrestrial placentals disappeared early in the Cenozoic (their most recent known fossils being 55 million-year-old teeth resembling those of condylarths) for reasons that are not clear, allowing marsupials to dominate the Australian ecosystem. Extant native Australian terrestrial placentals (such as hopping mice) are relatively recent immigrants, arriving via island hopping from Southeast Asia.\nGenetic analysis suggests a divergence date between the marsupials and the placentals at https://\u00a0million years ago. The ancestral number of chromosomes has been estimated to be 2n = 14.\nA recent hypothesis suggests that South American microbiotheres resulted from a back-dispersal from eastern Gondwana. This interpretation is based on new cranial and post-cranial marsupial fossils of \"Djarthia murgonensis\" from the early Eocene Tingamarra Local Fauna in Australia that indicate this species is the most plesiomorphic ancestor, the oldest unequivocal australidelphian, and may be the ancestral morphotype of the Australian marsupial radiation.\nIn 2023, imaging of a partial skeleton found in Australia by paleontologists from Flinders University led to the identification of \"Ambulator keanei\", the first long-distance walker in Australia.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "20206", "revid": "44238690", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20206", "title": "Manchester", "text": "City and metropolitan borough in England\nManchester () is a city in Greater Manchester, England. It had a population of over 589,000 in 2024. It is bordered by the Cheshire Plain to the south, the Pennines to the north and east, and the neighbouring city of Salford to the west. The two cities and the surrounding towns form one of the United Kingdom's most populous conurbations, the Greater Manchester Built-up Area, which has a population of 2.87million.\nThe history of Manchester began with the civilian settlement associated with the Roman fort (\"castra\") of \"Mamucium\" or \"Mancunium\", established in about AD 79 on a sandstone bluff near the confluence of the rivers Medlock and Irwell. Historically part of Lancashire, areas of Cheshire south of the River Mersey were incorporated into Manchester in the 20th century, including Wythenshawe in 1931. Throughout the Middle Ages Manchester remained a manorial township, but began to expand significantly around the turn of the 19th century. Manchester's unplanned urbanisation was brought on by a boom in textile manufacture during the Industrial Revolution, and resulted in it becoming the world's first industrialised city. Manchester attained city status in 1853. The Manchester Ship Canal opened in 1894, creating the Port of Manchester and linking the city to the Irish Sea, to the west. Its fortune declined after the Second World War, owing to deindustrialisation, and the IRA bombing in 1996 led to extensive investment and regeneration. Following considerable redevelopment, Manchester was the host city for the 2002 Commonwealth Games.\nThe city is notable for its architecture, its musical exports, its links to media, its links to scientific and engineering, its various sports clubs and its transport connections. The world's first inter-city passenger railway station was Manchester Liverpool Road; it was at the University of Manchester that Ernest Rutherford first split the atom; Frederic C. Williams, Tom Kilburn and Geoff Tootill developed the world's first stored-program computer in 1948; and Andre Geim and Konstantin Novoselov isolated the first graphene in 2004.\nToponymy.\nThe name \"Manchester\" originates from ', the Latin name for the city, or its variant '; its citizens are still referred to as Mancunians (). These names are generally thought to represent a Latinised version of an older Brittonic name. It is generally accepted that the etymology of the Brittonic name is from *\"-\", which means 'breast', in reference to a breast-shaped hill on which the city was built. However, more recent work suggests that the name could have instead come from the Brittonic *', which means 'mother', in reference to a local river goddess. Both possible roots remain extant in Celtic languages today, with ' meaning 'breast' in Irish but the same word meaning 'mother' in Welsh. The suffix \"-chester\" is from Old English ' ('Roman fortification', itself a loanword from Latin ', 'fort; fortified town'), and was first used after the end of Roman rule in Britain to describe places with former links to the Roman military.\nNicknames for the city that originated from its role in the Industrial Revolution include \"warehouse city\" and \"cottonopolis\". The city is widely known as 'the capital of the North' and is part of an ongoing dispute with the larger city of Birmingham as to which one is to be considered the unofficial second city of the United Kingdom. The city is also infrequently referred to as 'Manny', especially by non-Mancunians, which is considered offensive by some residents of the city. The phrase was particularly popularised by rapper Bugzy Malone's use of the phrase \"putting Manny on the map\".\nAlthough the name Manchester only officially applies to the metropolitan borough within the metropolitan county of Greater Manchester, it has been informally applied to various other areas over the years; examples include the \"Manchester City Zone\", \"Manchester post town\", and the \"Manchester Congestion Charge\", none of which simply cover the official confines of the city.\nHistory.\nBefore 1066: Early history.\nThe first major Celtic tribe in what is now Northern England were the Brigantes; they had a stronghold in the locality at a sandstone outcrop on which Manchester Cathedral now stands, opposite the bank of the River Irwell. Their territory extended across the fertile lowland of what is now Salford and Stretford. In 79 AD, following their conquest of Britain, the Roman general Agricola ordered the construction of a fort named Mamucium to ensure that Roman interests in Deva Victrix (now Chester) and Eboracum (now York) were protected from the Brigantes whose land they had occupied. Central Manchester has remained a continuously populated settlement since this time.\nA fragment of foundations of the final version of the Mamucium fort is visible in Castlefield today. The Roman habitation of Manchester probably ended around the 3rd century; its civilian settlement appears to have been abandoned by the mid-3rd century, although the fort may have supported a small garrison until the late 3rd or early 4th century. The fort was first investigated by archaeologists in 1906, and opened to the public in 1984.\n1066\u20131800: Before industrialisation.\nAfter the Roman withdrawal and subsequent Anglo-Saxon settlement, the centre of the town moved to the confluence of the rivers Irwell and Irk by the Norman Conquest in 1066. In the Normans' Harrying of the North, much of the area surrounding Manchester was destroyed. The Domesday Book (1086) records Manchester as located within the hundred of Salford, as well as being held as tenant in chief by a Norman named Roger of Poitou. The town was later held by the Grelley family, who were the lords of the manor and residents of Manchester Castle before a manor house was built for them in 1215. By 1421, Thomas de la Warre had founded and constructed a collegiate church for the parish, which would later become Manchester Cathedral; other church buildings have since become Chetham's School of Music and Chetham's Library. The latter opened in 1653 and is still open to the public, which makes it the oldest free public reference library in the United Kingdom.\nManchester is mentioned as having a market in 1282. Around the 14th century, Manchester received an influx of Flemish weavers, which have sometimes been credited as the foundation of the region's textile industry. Manchester became an important centre for the manufacture and trade of woollens and linen, and by about 1540 had expanded to become, in the words of John Leland, \"the fairest, best builded, quickest, and most populous town of all Lancashire\". The cathedral and Chetham's buildings are the only prominent survivors of Manchester at the time that Leland described it.\nDuring the English Civil War, Manchester strongly favoured the Parliamentarians who were led by Oliver Cromwell. He gave the town the right to elect its own Member of Parliament; Charles Worsley was elected to the seat but only sat for a year. He was later appointed as the Major-General for Lancashire, Cheshire and Staffordshire during the Rule of the Major-Generals. He was a diligent puritan, who forcibly shut down ale houses operating in the town and banned the celebration of Christmas.\nSignificant quantities of cotton began to be used after about 1600, firstly in linen and cotton fustians, but by around 1750 pure cotton fabrics were being produced and cotton had overtaken wool in importance. The Irwell and Mersey were made navigable by 1736, opening a route from Manchester to the sea docks on the Mersey. The Bridgewater Canal, Britain's first wholly artificial waterway, was opened in 1761, bringing coal from mines at Worsley to central Manchester. The canal was extended to the Mersey at Runcorn by 1776. The combination of competition and improved efficiency halved the cost of coal and halved the transport cost of raw cotton. Manchester became the dominant marketplace for textiles produced in the surrounding towns. A commodities exchange, opened in 1729, and numerous large warehouses, aided commerce. In 1780, Richard Arkwright began construction of Manchester's first cotton mill. Manchester exported its cotton goods to Africa as a way of paying for slaves to be purchased for the transatlantic slave trade. Manchester's relation to the slave trade and its reliance on the British Empire for its expansion forms a complex and controversial part of its history; historian Eric Williams, said it was a \"tremendous dependence on the triangular trade that made Manchester\".\n1800\u20131880: Industrialisation.\nManchester was one of the centres of textile manufacture during the Industrial Revolution. The great majority of cotton spinning took place in the towns of south Lancashire and north Cheshire, and Manchester was for a time the most productive centre of cotton processing. This caused the rapid expansion of the town that would lead to it become the world's first industrialised city. Manchester also became known as the world's largest marketplace for cotton goods, because of which it was dubbed \"Cottonopolis\" and \"Warehouse City\" during the Victorian era. Brought on by the Industrial Revolution, the unplanned urban expansion of Manchester reached \"an astonishing rate\" around the turn of the 19th century as people flocked to the city from all other parts of the British Isles looking for work.&lt; The city quickly developed a wide range of industries, such that urbanist Peter Hall described the city by 1835 as \"without challenge the first and greatest industrial city in the world\". Engineering firms initially made machines for the cotton trade, before subsequently diversifying into general manufacture. Similarly, the chemical industry started by producing bleaches and dyes, but expanded into other areas. Commerce was supported by financial service industries such as banking and insurance. In 1803, John Dalton formulated his atomic theory in Manchester while he was a teacher in the city.\nA centre of industrial capitalism, Manchester was once the scene of bread and labour riots, as well as calls for greater political recognition by the city's working and non-titled classes. On 16 August 1819, large crowds of working-class people protested in St Peter's Square, Manchester; estimates of the crowd range between 30,000\u2013150,000 contemporaneously and 50,000\u201380,000 by modern critics. When ordered to disperse the peaceful crowd, the soldiers instead charged and attacked them on horseback, killing at least 18 and injuring more than 700. The event was given the name 'Peterloo' as a portmanteau of Peter's Square and Waterloo (after the battle).\nThe political landscape of early industrial Manchester contained capitalist and communist schools of thought alike. The city was the home of, and eponymous to, Manchester Liberalism, and it was also the centre of the Anti-Corn Law League after 1838. Manchester has an equally notable place in the history of left-wing politics; the city is the subject of Friedrich Engels' work \"The Condition of the Working Class in England in 1844.\" Engels spent much of his life in and around Manchester, and when Karl Marx visited Manchester, they met at Chetham's Library in the city. The economics books that Marx was reading at the time can still be seen at the library, as can the window seat where Marx and Engels would meet. The first Trades Union Congress was held in Manchester at the Mechanics' Institute on David Street between 2 and 6 June 1868. Manchester was an equally important centre of the Labour Party, the Suffragette Movement, and the Chartist Movement.\nTrade, and feeding the growing population, required a large transport and distribution infrastructure: the canal system was extended, and Manchester became one end of the world's first intercity passenger railway \u2013 the Liverpool and Manchester Railway \u2013 in 1830. Competition between the various forms of transport helped to keep costs down. The number of cotton mills in Manchester itself peaked at 108 in 1853, after which the number began to decline and Manchester had been surpassed as the largest centre of cotton spinning by Bolton by the 1850s and Oldham by the 1860s. However, this period of decline coincided with the rise of the city as the financial centre of the region. In 1878 the General Post Office (the forerunner of British Telecom) provided its first telephones to a firm in Manchester.\n1880\u20131939: Impacts of industrialisation.\nSome critics see Manchester in the late 1800s as a place rife with opportunities: there were new industrial processes being developed; the city had become known for its experimental ways of thinking, with the Manchester School promoting free trade and \"laissez-faire\"; there was the advent of new classes or groups in society and new religious sects; and the city was also experimenting with new forms of labour organisation. These factors led it to attract educated visitors from all parts of Britain and Europe. A saying capturing this sense of innovation survives today: \"What Manchester does today, the rest of the world does tomorrow.\" Manchester's golden age is often dated as the last quarter of the 19th century, with many of its grand public buildings, for example Manchester Town Hall, dating from the period. The city's cosmopolitan atmosphere also contributed to a vibrant culture, which included the Hall\u00e9 Orchestra. In 1889, when county councils were created in England, the municipal borough became a county borough which gave it even greater autonomy.\nOthers interpret the newly industrialised Manchester as a site of widespread poverty and squalor. Historian Simon Schama noted that \"Manchester was the very best and the very worst taken to terrifying extremes, a new kind of city in the world; the chimneys of industrial suburbs greeting you with columns of smoke\". An American visitor taken to Manchester's blackspots reported that he saw \"wretched, defrauded, oppressed, crushed human nature, lying and bleeding fragments\".\nThe Manchester Ship Canal was built between 1888 and 1894, in some sections by canalisation of the Rivers Irwell and Mersey, running from Salford to Eastham Locks on the tidal Mersey. This enabled oceangoing ships to sail right into the Port of Manchester. On the canal's banks, just outside the borough, the world's first industrial estate was created at Trafford Park.\nManchester continued to process cotton, and in 1913, 65% of the world's cotton was processed in the area. The First World War interrupted access to the export markets; combined with increased cotton processing in other parts of the world, this led to the rapid decline of the textile industry within the city. Furthermore, industry and employment suffered greatly as a result of the Great Depression, particularly due to its effect on the value of British exports. However, Manchester also saw a cultural revolution in the 1930s as locals tried to use greater creativity and local pride to counteract the effect of the status of the economy; this included the first formation of the British High Street, and embarking on infrastructure projects such as the Manchester Central Library.\n1939\u20131945: Second World War.\nLike most of the UK, the Manchester area was mobilised extensively during the Second World War. For example, casting and machining expertise at Beyer, Peacock &amp; Company's locomotive works in Gorton was switched to bomb making; Dunlop's rubber works in Chorlton-on-Medlock made barrage balloons; and just outside the city in Trafford Park, engineers Metropolitan-Vickers made Avro Manchester and Avro Lancaster bombers and Ford built the Rolls-Royce Merlin engines to power them. Manchester was thus the target of bombing by the Luftwaffe, and by late 1940 air raids were taking place against non-military targets.\nThe biggest air raids on the city during the war took place during the Christmas Blitz on the nights of 22\u201323 and 24\u201325 December 1940, when an estimated of high explosives plus over 37,000 incendiary bombs were dropped. A large part of the historic city centre was destroyed, including 165 warehouses, 200 business premises, and 150 offices. 376 were killed and 30,000 houses were damaged. Manchester Cathedral, Royal Exchange and Free Trade Hall were among the buildings seriously damaged, with the restoration of the cathedral taking 20 years. In total, 589 civilians were recorded to have died as a result of enemy action within the Manchester County Borough.\n1945\u20132000: Decline and regeneration.\nCotton processing and trading continued to decline in peacetime, and the exchange closed in 1968. By 1963 the port of Manchester was the UK's third largest, and employed over 3,000 men, but the canal was unable to handle the increasingly large container ships. Traffic declined, and the port closed in 1982. Heavy industry suffered a downturn from the 1960s and was greatly reduced under the economic policies followed by Margaret Thatcher's government after 1979. Manchester lost 150,000 jobs in manufacturing between 1961 and 1983. Regeneration began in the late 1980s, with initiatives such as the Metrolink, the Bridgewater Concert Hall, the Manchester Arena, and (in Salford) the rebranding of the port as Salford Quays. Two bids to host the Olympic Games were part of a process to raise the international profile of the city.\nOn 15 June 1996, the Provisional Irish Republican Army (IRA) set off a lorry bomb in Corporation Street in the city centre. The largest to be detonated on British soil, the bomb injured over 200 people, heavily damaged nearby buildings, and broke windows away. Although no one was killed by the explosion, it was one of the most expensive man-made disasters in history: the cost of the immediate damage was initially estimated at \u00a350million (equivalent to \u00a3 in 2023), but this was quickly revised upwards. The final insurance pay-out was over \u00a3400million (equivalent to \u00a3 in 2023); many affected businesses never recovered from the loss of trade. However, it is also credited as helping to drive the regeneration of the city.\n2000\u2013present: Modern day.\nSpurred by the investment after the 1996 bombing and aided by the XVII Commonwealth Games, the city centre has undergone extensive regeneration. The Printworks had been closed by Robert Maxwell after he had bought it, but it was redeveloped by architects RTKL Associates following the 1996 IRA bombing and reopened as a leisure centre and cinema. The Corn Exchange was also heavily damaged in the 1996 IRA bombing, before being reopened as the Triangle Shopping Centre; it was then redeveloped by the Norwich Property Trust and opened under its current name in 2012. Manchester Arndale is the UK's largest city-centre shopping centre.\nLarge city sections from the 1960s have been demolished, re-developed or modernised with the use of glass and steel. Old mills have been converted into apartments. Hulme has undergone extensive regeneration, with million-pound loft-house apartments being developed. The 47-storey, Beetham Tower was the tallest UK building outside of London and the highest residential accommodation in Europe when completed in 2006. It was surpassed in 2018 by the South Tower of the Deansgate Square project, also in Manchester. In January 2007, the independent Casino Advisory Panel licensed Manchester to build the UK's only supercasino, but plans were abandoned in February 2008.\nOn 22 May 2017, an Islamist terrorist carried out a suicide bombing outside the Manchester Arena, shortly after an Ariana Grande concert. The explosion killed 23 people (including the perpetrator) and injured over 800. It was the deadliest terrorist attack and first suicide bombing in Britain since the 7 July 2005 London bombings. It caused worldwide condemnation and changed the UK's threat level to \"critical\" for the first time since 2007. On 2 October 2025, another terrorist attack occurred outside the Heaton Park Hebrew Congregation synagogue. A 35-year-old drove a car into pedestrians and then began stabbing worshippers. Two British men were killed, and three others were seriously injured; the assailant was shot dead by armed police. Following the terrorist attack, Prime Minister Keir Starmer, Deputy Prime Minister David Lammy, and Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood addressed growing concerns over the rise in antisemitic incidents in Manchester and across the UK, which have increased since pro-Palestinian protests and marches began taking place regularly in British cities.\nGovernment.\nThe City of Manchester is governed by Manchester City Council. The Greater Manchester Combined Authority, with a directly elected mayor, has responsibilities for economic strategy and transport, amongst other areas, on a Greater Manchester-wide basis. Manchester has been a member of the English Core Cities Group since its inception in 1995. The town of Manchester was granted a charter by Thomas Grelley in 1301 but lost its borough status in a court case of 1359. Until the 19th century local government was largely in the hands of manorial courts, the last of which was dissolved in 1846.\nIn 1792, Commissioners \u2013 usually known as \"Police Commissioners\" \u2013 were established for the social improvement of Manchester. Manchester regained its borough status in 1838 and comprised the townships of Beswick, Cheetham Hill, Chorlton upon Medlock and Hulme. By 1846, with increasing population and greater industrialisation, the Borough Council had taken over the powers of the \"Police Commissioners\". In 1853, Manchester was granted city status.\nIn 1885, Bradford, Harpurhey, Rusholme and parts of Moss Side and Withington townships became part of the City of Manchester. In 1889, the city became a county borough, as did many larger Lancashire towns, and therefore not governed by Lancashire County Council. Between 1890 and 1933, more areas were added to the city, which had been administered by Lancashire County Council, including former villages such as Burnage, Chorlton-cum-Hardy, Didsbury, Fallowfield, Levenshulme, Longsight, and Withington. In 1931, the Cheshire civil parishes of Baguley, Northenden and Northen Etchells from the south of the River Mersey were added. In 1974, by way of the Local Government Act 1972, the City of Manchester became a metropolitan district of the metropolitan county of Greater Manchester. That year, Ringway, the village where Manchester Airport is located, was added to the city.\nIn November 2014, it was announced that Greater Manchester would have a directly elected mayor with fiscal control over health, transport, housing and police in ten local authorities which form the Greater Manchester Combined Authority. Andy Burnham was elected as the first Mayor of Greater Manchester in the 2017 election with 63% of the vote. He was re-elected in the 2021 and 2024 elections. As Mayor of Greater Manchester, Burnham is responsible for a budget of \u00a32.6bn in 2024. Of this, \u00a31.51bn is spent on policing and transport. The role of Mayor of Greater Manchester is the most powerful mayoral role in the country; he is the police and crime commissioner for Greater Manchester \"ex officio\" and is responsible for some housing, education, and welfare policies.\nGeography.\nAt , northwest of London, Manchester lies in a bowl-shaped land area bordered to the north and east by the Pennines, an upland chain that runs the length of northern England, and to the south by the Cheshire Plain. Manchester is north-east of Liverpool and north-west of Sheffield, making the city the halfway point between the two. The city centre is on the east bank of the River Irwell, near its confluences with the Rivers Medlock and Irk, and is relatively low-lying, being between above sea level.\nThe River Mersey flows through the south of Manchester. Much of the inner city, especially in the south, is flat, offering extensive views from many highrise buildings in the city of the foothills and moors of the Pennines, which can often be capped with snow in the winter months. Manchester's geographic features were highly influential in its early development as the world's first industrial city. These features are its climate, its proximity to a seaport at Liverpool, the availability of waterpower from its rivers, and its nearby coal reserves.\nFor purposes of the Office for National Statistics, Manchester forms the most populous settlement within the Greater Manchester Urban Area, the United Kingdom's second-largest conurbation. There is a mix of high-density urban and suburban locations. The largest open space in the city, at around , is Heaton Park. Manchester is contiguous on all sides with several large settlements, except for a small section along its southern boundary with Cheshire. The M60 and M56 motorways pass through Northenden and Wythenshawe respectively in the south of Manchester. Heavy rail lines enter the city from all directions, the principal destination being Manchester Piccadilly station, the city's largest railway terminus, and the second-busiest in Great Britain outside of London.\nManchester lies at the centre of the North West Green Belt. This reduces urban sprawl, prevents towns in the conurbation from further convergence, protects the identity of outlying communities, and preserves nearby countryside. It is achieved by restricting inappropriate development within the designated areas and imposing stricter conditions on permitted building. Being highly urban, the borough contains limited protected greenfield land with minimal development opportunities.\nClimate.\nManchester has a temperate oceanic climate (K\u00f6ppen: \"Cfb\"), like much of the British Isles, with warm summers and cold winters compared to other parts of the UK. Summer daytime temperatures regularly top , quite often reaching on sunny days during July and August. In more recent years, temperatures have occasionally reached over . There is regular but generally light precipitation throughout the year. The city's average annual rainfall is compared to a UK average of . Its mean rain days are 140.4 per annum, compared to the UK average of 154.4.\nManchester has a relatively high humidity level, and this, along with abundant soft water, was one factor that led to advancement of the textile industry in the area. Snowfalls are not common in the city because of the urban warming effect. The West Pennine Moors to the north-west, South Pennines to the north-east and Peak District to the east receive more snow, which can close roads leading out of the city. They include the A62 via Oldham and Standedge, the A57, Snake Pass, towards Sheffield, and the Pennine section of the M62. The lowest temperature ever recorded in Manchester was on 7 January 2010. The highest temperature recorded in Manchester is on 19 July 2022, during the 2022 European Heatwave.\nDemographics.\nIn the 2021 United Kingdom census, the population of the City of Manchester was 552,000, compared to 503,100 in the 2011 United Kingdom census. This was an increase of 9.7%. It was slower than the increase between 2001 and 2021 of 20.8%, which was the largest in the United Kingdom outside of London. The growth was higher than the forecasted rate of growth of 5.8%. In Manchester in 2021, 43.5% of people had never married, 37% of people were married, 12.24% of people were separated or divorced, and 7.26% of people were widowed. Compared to the national average for 2021, Manchester has a higher proportion of people who have never married, those who are divorced, and those who are widowed, but a lower proportion of those who are married.\nAccording to the Greater Manchester Combined Authority, the population of Greater Manchester in 2021 was 2,867,769, an increase of 6.9% from 2011. Since 1991, the City of Manchester has grown faster than other major cities in England, growing by 36.3%. Salford, another city in Greater Manchester, saw the highest growth in England across the 2010s with a 15.4% increase. In 2012, 6,547,000 people lived within of Manchester and 11,694,000 within .\nOf the increase in Greater Manchester's population between 2011 and 2021, three quarters was as a result of migration to the city. One quarter was as a result of the birth rate being higher than the mortality rate. Between the beginning of July 2011 and end of June 2012, births exceeded deaths by 4,800. Manchester and Greater Manchester have younger populations than the average for England: nationally, 82.6% of people are below the age of 65 compared to 91.2% for the City of Manchester and 85.1% for Greater Manchester. Greater Manchester Combined Authority's analysis of the 2021 census noticed the rising number of 0\u201315 year olds was a large drive for the increasing population change within the City of Manchester.\nThe Manchester Larger Urban Zone, a Eurostat measure of the functional city-region approximated to local government districts, had a population of 2,539,100 in 2004. Since Brexit the UK has no longer provided data to Eurostat, and thus it no longer defines Manchester as a Large Urban Zone. In 2024 a partial deal for GDP data was reached between the Office for National Statistics and Eurostat, but the latter's website does not mention any plans for data sharing in regards to urban population.\nReligion.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Pie chart/styles.css\"/&gt;\nSince the 2001 census, the proportion of Christians in Manchester has fallen by 22% from 62.4% to 48.7% in 2011. The proportion of those with no religious affiliation rose by 58.1% from 16% to 25.3%. The proportion of Muslims increased by 73.6%, from 9.1% to 15.8%. The size of the Jewish population in Greater Manchester is the largest in Britain outside London.\nEthnicity.\nIn terms of ethnic composition, the City of Manchester has the highest non-white proportion of any district in Greater Manchester. The 2021 census showed that 56.8% of the population was White. 48.7% were White British, 1.7% White Irish, 0.1% Gypsy or Irish Traveller, 6.2% Other White. The size of mixed European and British ethnic groups is unclear. There are reportedly over 25,000 people in Greater Manchester of at least partial Italian descent alone, which represents 5.5% of the population of Greater Manchester.\nIn 2021, 5.2% were mixed race (1.8% White and Black Caribbean, 1.1% White and Black African, 1.1% White and Asian, 1.2% other mixed), 20.9% Asian (2.7% Indian,11.9% Pakistani, 1.8% Bangladeshi, 2.3% Chinese, 2.2% other Asian), 12% Black (8.7% African, 1.9% Caribbean, 1.4% other Black), 2.7% Arab and 2.4% of other ethnic heritage.\nMoss Side, Longsight, Cheetham Hill, and Rusholme are population centres for ethnic minorities. Manchester's Irish Festival, including a St Patrick's Day parade, is one of Europe's largest. There is a well-established Chinatown in the city, which attracts large numbers of Chinese students who, in attending the local universities, contribute to Manchester having the third-largest Chinese population in Europe.\nEthnicity of Manchester, from 1971 to 2021:\nEthnicity of school pupils\nEconomy.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Table alignment/tables.css\" /&gt;\nMacroeconomic wealth.\nThe Office for National Statistics does not produce economic data for the City of Manchester alone; instead it groups the city with Salford, Stockport, Tameside, and Trafford in an area named Greater Manchester South. In 2023, the area had a GVA of \u00a334.8billion. The economy grew relatively strongly between 2002 and 2012, when growth was 2.3% above the national average.\nIt is ranked as a Beta\u2013 (beta minus) city by the Globalization and World Cities Research Network in their 2024 rankings, placing it second for UK cities behind London, which is A++ (the highest ranking). Below Manchester are Bristol and Birmingham in the Gamma category. As the UK economy continues to recover from its 2008\u20132010 downturn, Manchester compares favourably according to recent figures. In 2012 it showed the strongest annual growth in business stock (5%) of all core cities.\nThe decade between 2015 and 2025 saw the economy of the United Kingdom significantly affected by the country's withdrawal from the European Union (Brexit) and by the COVID-19 pandemic. These events impacted Manchester, with estimates showing a decline in economic output from COVID in the region of 9\u201310%, and with only 1% of firms in the city reporting a positive impact from Brexit, with 60% reporting a neutral or negative impact. The years since 2021 have seen some recovery, with forecasts for 2025\u201328 suggesting that growth in the region will reach 2.4% annually, exceeding the expected national growth rate of 1.6%.\nIndividual wealth.\nManchester is a city of contrast, where some of the country's most deprived and most affluent neighbourhoods can be found. As of the 2019 Indices of Multiple Deprivation, Manchester is the second most deprived local authority by rank, the sixth by score, and fifth by the proportion of Lower Layer Super Output Areas (LLSOAs) that are deprived, with 43% of its LLOAs falling among the top 10% of areas nationally by the extent of deprivation. By final ranking it is only beaten by Blackpool, which is also in Lancashire. As of the 2021 census, 53.5% of the over-16 population is in employment, 5.7% are unemployed while actively seeking work, and 40.8% are economically inactive.\nOn the other hand, Greater Manchester is home to more multi-millionaires than anywhere outside London, with the City of Manchester taking up most of the tally. In 2013 Manchester was ranked 6th in the UK for quality of life, according to a rating of the UK's 12 largest cities. Women fare better in Manchester than the rest of the country in comparative pay with men. The per hours-worked gender pay gap is 3.3% compared with 11.1% for Britain. 37% of the working-age population in Manchester have degree-level qualifications, as opposed to an average of 33% across other core cities, although its schools under-perform slightly compared with the national average.\nBusiness wealth.\nManchester's civic leadership has a reputation for business acumen. It owns two of the country's four busiest airports and uses its earnings to fund local projects. Meanwhile, KPMG's competitive alternative report found that in 2012 Manchester had the 9th lowest tax cost of any industrialised city in the world, and fiscal devolution has come earlier to Manchester than to any other British city: it can keep half the extra taxes it gets from transport investment. KPMG's competitive alternative report also found that Manchester was Europe's most affordable city featured, ranking slightly better than the Dutch cities of Rotterdam and Amsterdam, which all have a cost-of-living index of less than 95.\nManchester has the largest UK office market outside London, according to GVA Grimley, with a quarterly office uptake (averaged over 2010\u20132014) of some \u2013 equivalent to the quarterly office uptake of Leeds, Liverpool and Newcastle combined and more than the nearest rival, Birmingham. The strong office market in Manchester has been partly attributed to \"northshoring\" (from offshoring), which entails the relocation or alternative creation of jobs away from the overheated South to areas where office space is possibly cheaper and the workforce market less saturated.\nArchitecture.\nManchester's buildings display a variety of architectural styles, ranging from Victorian to contemporary architecture. The widespread use of red brick characterises the city, much of the architecture of which harks back to its days as a global centre for the cotton trade. Just outside the immediate city centre are a large number of former cotton mills, some of which have been left virtually untouched since their closure, while many have been redeveloped as apartment buildings and office space. Manchester Town Hall, in Albert Square, was built in the Gothic revival style.\nManchester also has a number of skyscrapers built in the 1960s and 1970s, the tallest being the CIS Tower near Manchester Victoria station until the Beetham Tower was completed in 2006. The latter exemplifies a new surge in high-rise building. It includes a Hilton hotel, a restaurant and apartments. The largest skyscraper is now Deansgate Square South Tower, at . The Green Building, opposite Oxford Road station, is an eco-friendly housing project, while the recently completed One Angel Square, is one of the most sustainable large buildings in the world.\nLandmarks.\nTwo large squares hold many of Manchester's public monuments. Albert Square has monuments to Prince Albert, Bishop James Fraser, Oliver Heywood, William Gladstone and John Bright. Piccadilly Gardens has monuments dedicated to Queen Victoria, Robert Peel, James Watt and the Duke of Wellington. The cenotaph in St Peter's Square is Manchester's main memorial to its war dead. Designed by Edwin Lutyens, it echoes the original on Whitehall in London. The Alan Turing Memorial in Sackville Park commemorates his role as the father of modern computing. A larger-than-life statue of Abraham Lincoln by George Gray Barnard in the eponymous Lincoln Square (having stood for many years in Platt Fields) was presented to the city by Mr and Mrs Charles Phelps Taft of Cincinnati, Ohio, to mark the part Lancashire played in the cotton famine and American Civil War of 1861\u20131865.\nAdjacent to Manchester Airport is the Runway Visitor Park, an aviation centre which is the site of G-BOAC, one of the twenty Concorde aircraft built. The aircraft was the flagship of British Airways' fleet because BOAC was the initials of the British Overseas Airways Corporation. Other aircraft on display at the park, which also has a view of Manchester Airport's runways, are a BAE Systems Nimrod MRA4, a Hawker Siddeley Trident, a McDonnell Douglas DC-10, and a British Aerospace 146.\nHeaton Park in the north of the city borough is one of the largest municipal parks in Europe, covering of parkland. The city has 135 parks, gardens, and open spaces. Manchester has six designated local nature reserves: Chorlton Water Park, Blackley Forest, Clayton Vale and Chorlton Ees, Ivy Green, Boggart Hole Clough and Highfield Country Park.\nTransport.\nRail.\nManchester Liverpool Road was the world's first purpose-built passenger and goods railway station and served as the Manchester terminus on the Liverpool and Manchester Railway, which was the first inter-city passenger railway in the world. The station opened with the railway in 1830 and closed in 1975. The station buildings are still extant, and since 1983 they have been part of the site of the Science and Industry Museum.\nTwo of the city's four main line terminus stations did not survive the 1960s: Manchester Central, originally part of the Cheshire Lines Committee, and Manchester Exchange, originally part of the London and North Western Railway, both closed to passengers in 1969. Manchester Mayfield station closed to passenger services in 1960, before being redeveloped as a parcel depot which opened in 1970 and closed in 1986. In August 2025, Manchester City Council approved the regeneration of Mayfield Park, which includes the station, into a housing estate.\nToday, the city is well served by its rail network although it is now working to capacity, and is at the centre of an extensive county-wide railway network, including the West Coast Main Line, with two mainline stations: Manchester Piccadilly and Manchester Victoria. The Manchester station group \u2013 comprising Manchester Piccadilly, Manchester Victoria, Manchester Oxford Road and Deansgate \u2013 is the third busiest in the UK, with 44.9million passengers recorded in 2017/2018. The High Speed 2 link to Birmingham and London was also planned, which would have included a tunnel under Manchester on the final approach into an upgraded Piccadilly station, however this was cancelled by Prime Minister Rishi Sunak in October 2023.\nRecent improvements in Manchester as part of the Northern Hub in the 2010s have been numerous electrification schemes into and through Manchester, redevelopment of Victoria station and construction of the Ordsall Chord directly linking Victoria and Piccadilly. Work on two new through platforms at Piccadilly and an extensive upgrade at Oxford Road had not commenced as of 2019. Manchester city centre, specifically the Castlefield Corridor, suffers from constrained rail capacity that frequently leads to delays and cancellations \u2013 a 2018 report found that all three major Manchester stations are among the top ten worst stations in the United Kingdom for punctuality, with Oxford Road deemed the worst in the country.\nMetrolink.\nManchester became the first city in the UK to acquire a modern light rail tram system when the Manchester Metrolink opened in 1992. In 2023\u20132024, 42million passenger journeys were made on the system. The present system mostly runs on former commuter rail lines converted for light rail use, and crosses the city centre via on-street tram lines. The network consists of eight lines with 99 stops. A new line to the Trafford Centre opened in 2020. Manchester city centre is also serviced by over a dozen heavy and light rail-based park and ride sites.\nBus.\nThe city has one of the most extensive bus networks outside London. Before the launch of Bee Network, there were over 50 bus companies operating in the Greater Manchester region radiating from the city. In 2011, 80% of public transport journeys in Greater Manchester were made by bus, amounting to 220million passenger journeys each year. After deregulation in 1986, the bus system was taken over by GM Buses, which after privatisation was split into GM Buses North and GM Buses South. Later these were taken over by First Greater Manchester and Stagecoach Manchester. Much of the First Greater Manchester business was sold to Diamond North West and Go North West in 2019. Go North West operate a three-route zero-fare Manchester Metroshuttle, which carries 2.8million commuters a year around Manchester's business districts. . Metroshuttle was later rebranded to Free bus, with its number of routes reduced to two. Stagecoach Manchester is the Stagecoach Group's largest subsidiary and also the largest bus operator in Greater Manchester, operating around 690 buses. It is also the current operator of Free bus since the rollout of Trenche 2 Bee Network.\nAir.\nManchester Airport is the third busiest in the United Kingdom, with over double the number of annual passengers of the next busiest non-London airport. Services cover many destinations in Europe, North America, the Caribbean, Africa, the Middle East, and Asia (with more destinations from Manchester than any other airport in Britain). It is the only airport in the UK outside London to have two fully-operational runways.\nThe airport has the highest rating available: \"\"Category 10\", encompassing an elite group of airports able to handle \"Code F\"\" aircraft, including the Airbus A380. From September 2010 the airport became one of only 17 airports in the world and one of only three UK airports alongside Heathrow Airport and Gatwick Airport to operate the Airbus A380.\nA smaller Manchester Barton Aerodrome exists to the west of Manchester city centre. It was Manchester's first municipal airport and became the site of the first air traffic control tower in the UK, and the first municipal airfield in the UK to be licensed by the Air Ministry. Today, private charter flights and general aviation use City. It also has a flight school, and both the Greater Manchester Police Air Support Unit and the North West Air Ambulance have helicopters based there.\nCanal.\nAn extensive canal network passes through Manchester including the Ashton Canal, Rochdale Canal and Bridgewater Canal \u2013 all of which end in Manchester city centre. The canals are still maintained, though now largely repurposed for leisure use. The Manchester Ship Canal, which was built to carry freight from the Industrial Revolution onward, ends in neighbouring Salford before linking with the River Irwell which runs through the north of the city.\nCycling.\nCycling for transportation and leisure enjoys popularity in Manchester and the city also plays a major role in British cycle racing. As of 2023, 2% of journeys in Manchester are made by bicycle, with cycle routes being integrated into Manchester's multimodal Bee Network alongside walking, train, tram, and bus routes.\nCulture.\nMusic.\nBands that have emerged from the Manchester music scene include Van der Graaf Generator, Oasis, the Smiths, Joy Division and its successor group New Order, Buzzcocks, the Stone Roses, the Fall, the Durutti Column, 10cc, Godley &amp; Creme, the Verve, Elbow, Doves, the Charlatans, M People, the 1975, Simply Red, Blossoms, Take That, Dutch Uncles, Everything Everything, the Courteeners, Pale Waves, and the Outfield. Manchester was credited as the main driving force behind British indie music of the 1980s led by the Smiths, later including the Stone Roses, Happy Mondays, Inspiral Carpets, and James. The later groups came from what became known as the \"Madchester\" scene that also centred on The Ha\u00e7ienda nightclub developed by the founder of Factory Records, Tony Wilson. Although from southern England, the Chemical Brothers subsequently formed in Manchester. Former Smiths frontman Morrissey, whose lyrics often refer to Manchester, later found international success as a solo artist. Manchester acts of the 1960s include the Hollies, Herman's Hermits, and Davy Jones of the Monkees, and the earlier Bee Gees, who grew up in Chorlton. Rap artists from Manchester include Bugzy Malone, Aitch, and Meekz.\nBrass band music, a tradition in the north of England, is important to Manchester's musical heritage; some of the UK's leading bands, such as the CWS Manchester Band and the Fairey Band, are from Manchester and surrounding areas, and the Whit Friday brass-band contest takes place annually in the neighbouring areas of Saddleworth and Tameside.\nManchester's main pop music venue is Manchester Arena, voted \"International Venue of the Year\" in 2007. With over 21,000 seats, it is the second largest arena of its type in Europe. In terms of concertgoers, as of 2008[ [update]] it is the busiest indoor arena in the world, ahead of Madison Square Garden in New York and The O2 Arena in London, which are second and third busiest. Other venues include Manchester Apollo, Albert Hall, Victoria Warehouse, Manchester Academy and the Co-op Live arena, the latter being the largest indoor arena in the UK by capacity, and the third largest in the world. Smaller venues include the Band on the Wall, the Night and Day Caf\u00e9, the Ruby Lounge, The Deaf Institute, and Gorilla. Manchester also has the most indie and rock music events outside London.\nManchester has two symphony orchestras, The Hall\u00e9 and the BBC Philharmonic, and a chamber orchestra, the Manchester Camerata. In the 1950s, the city was home to a so-called \"Manchester School\" of classical composers, which comprised Harrison Birtwistle, Peter Maxwell Davies, David Ellis and Alexander Goehr. Manchester is a centre for musical education: the Royal Northern College of Music and Chetham's School of Music. Forerunners of the RNCM were the Northern School of Music (founded 1920) and the Royal Manchester College of Music (founded 1893), which merged in 1973. One of the earliest instructors and classical music pianists/conductors at the RNCM, shortly after its founding, was the Russian-born Arthur Friedheim, (1859\u20131932), who later had the music library at the famed Peabody Institute conservatory of music in Baltimore, Maryland, named after him. The main classical music venue was the Free Trade Hall on Peter Street until the opening in 1996 of the 2,500 seat Bridgewater Hall.\nPerforming arts.\nManchester is a significant cultural centre for theatre and the performing arts, with a number of large venues. Significant theatres include: the Manchester Opera House, which features large-scale touring shows and West End productions; the Palace Theatre, which despite near-closure in the 1970s is now one of the most successful in the country; and the Royal Exchange Theatre in Manchester's former cotton exchange, which is the largest theatre in the round in the UK. Smaller venues include the Contact Theatre and Z-arts in Hulme. The Dancehouse on Oxford Road is dedicated to dance productions. In 2014, HOME, a new custom-built arts complex opened. Housing two theatre spaces, five cinemas and an art exhibition space, it replaced the Cornerhouse and The Library Theatre.\nSince 2007, the city has hosted the Manchester International Festival, a biennial international arts festival with a focus on original work, which has included major new commissions by artists, including Bj\u00f6rk. In 2023, the festival, operated by Factory International, was given a permanent home in Aviva Studios, a purpose-built multi-million pound venue designed by Rem Koolhaas from the Office for Metropolitan Architecture.\nMuseums and galleries.\nManchester's museums celebrate Manchester's Roman history, rich industrial heritage and its role in the Industrial Revolution, the textile industry, the Trade Union movement, women's suffrage and football. A reconstructed part of the Roman fort of Mamucium is open to the public in Castlefield.\nThe Science and Industry Museum, housed in the former Liverpool Road railway station, has a large collection of steam locomotives, industrial machinery, aircraft and a replica of the world's first stored computer program (known as the Manchester Baby). The Museum of Transport displays a collection of historic buses and trams. Trafford Park in the neighbouring borough of Trafford is home to Imperial War Museum North. The Manchester Museum opened to the public in the 1880s, has notable Egyptology and natural history collections. Other local exhibition spaces and museums include the National Football Museum at Urbis, Castlefield Gallery, the Manchester Costume Gallery at Platt Fields Park, the People's History Museum and the Manchester Jewish Museum.\nThe municipally owned Manchester Art Gallery in Mosley Street houses a permanent collection of European painting and one of Britain's main collections of Pre-Raphaelite paintings. In the south of the city, the Whitworth Art Gallery displays modern art, sculpture and textiles and was voted Museum of the Year in 2015. The work of Stretford-born painter L. S. Lowry, known for \"matchstick\" paintings of industrial Manchester and Salford, can be seen in the City and Whitworth Manchester galleries, and at the Lowry art centre in Salford Quays (in the neighbouring borough of Salford), which devotes a large permanent exhibition to his works.\nLiterature.\nManchester is a UNESCO City of Literature known for a \"radical literary history\". Manchester in the 19th century featured in works highlighting the changes that industrialisation had brought. They include Elizabeth Gaskell's novel \"Mary Barton: A Tale of Manchester Life\" (1848), and Letitia Landon's poetical illustration \"Manchester\" to a vista over the city by G. Pickering in Fisher's Drawing Room Scrap Book, 1835, which records the rapid growth of the city and its cultural importance.\n\"The Condition of the Working Class in England in 1844\" was written about and in the city by Friedrich Engels while resident. Manchester was also the meeting place of Engels and Karl Marx, where the two began writing \"The Communist Manifesto\" in Chetham's Library \u2013 founded in 1653 and claiming to be the oldest public library in the English-speaking world. Elsewhere in the city, the John Rylands Library holds an extensive collection of early printing, and the Rylands Library Papyrus P52, believed to be the earliest extant New Testament text, is on permanent display.\nThe novel \"Hard Times\" by Charles Dickens is reputed to have been set in Manchester and Preston. Similarly, the novel \"Jane Eyre\" was first written by Charlotte Bront\u00eb in 1846, while she was staying in her lodgings in Hulme. She was accompanying her father Patrick, who was convalescing in the city after cataract surgery. She probably envisioned Manchester Cathedral churchyard as the burial place for Jane's parents and the birthplace of Jane herself.\nGaskell penned all her novels but \"Mary Barton\" at her home in 84 Plymouth Grove, Manchester. Her house would often host influential authors of the time, such as Dickens, Bront\u00eb, Harriet Beecher Stowe and Charles Eliot Norton. It has been open to the public as a literary museum since 2014. Isabella Banks was also born in the city; she is most well known for her 1876 novel \"The Manchester Man\". Anglo-American author Frances Hodgson Burnett was born in the city's Cheetham Hill district in 1849. Anthony Burgess is among the 20th-century writers who lived in Manchester. During his time in the city he wrote the dystopian satire \"A Clockwork Orange\" in 1962. Dame Carol Ann Duffy, Poet Laureate from 2009 to 2019, moved to the city in 1996 and lives in West Didsbury, a village contiguous within the city.\nNightlife.\nThe night-time economy of Manchester has expanded significantly since about 1993, with investment from breweries in bars, public houses and clubs, along with active support from the local authorities. The more than 500 licensed premises in the city centre have a capacity to deal with more than visitors, with 110,000\u2013130,000 people visiting on a typical weekend night, making Manchester the most popular city for events at 79 per thousand people. The night-time economy has a value of about \u00a3100million, and supports 12,000 jobs. In 2024, Manchester was voted the 8th best city in the world for nightlife, with voters praising its variety and inclusivity for different tastes and backgrounds.\nThe Madchester scene of the 1980s, from which groups including the Stone Roses, the Happy Mondays, Inspiral Carpets, 808 State, James and the Charlatans emerged, was based around clubs such as The Ha\u00e7ienda. The period was the subject of the movie \"24 Hour Party People\". Many of the big clubs suffered problems with organised crime at that time; Dave Haslam describes one where staff were so intimidated that free admission and drinks were demanded (and given) and drugs were openly dealt. Following a series of drug-related violent incidents, The Ha\u00e7ienda closed in 1997.\nGay village.\nPublic houses in the Canal Street area have had an LGBTQ+ clientele since at least 1940, and now form the centre of Manchester's LGBTQ+ community. Since the opening of new bars and clubs, the area attracts 20,000 visitors each weekend and has hosted a popular festival, Manchester Pride, each August since 1985, when it was backed by newly elected councillors on Manchester City Council. Despite its high attendance, Manchester Pride has also received criticism from within the LGBT community dating as far back as 2007, due to its choice around where it spends the revenue it earns.\nCanal Street is now described as the centre of Manchester's gay village, and the surrounding area has been described as the most successful of its kind in Europe. However, critics of the area have described it as a \"gay ghetto\" and that its general popularity has led to a decreased focus on LGBTQ rights and inclusion.\nEducation.\nSchooling.\nOne of Manchester's notable secondary schools is Manchester Grammar School, established in 1515. Its previous premises are now used by Chetham's School of Music. In 2019, the Manchester Local Education Authority (LEA) was ranked second to last out of Greater Manchester's ten LEAs and 140th out of 151 in the country LEAs based on the percentage of pupils attaining grades 4 or above in English and mathematics GCSEs (General Certificate of Secondary Education) with 56.2% compared with the national average of 64.9%. Of the 63 secondary schools in the LEA, four had 80% or more pupils achieving Grade 4 or above in English and maths GCSEs: Manchester High School for Girls, The King David High School, Manchester Islamic High School for Girls, and Kassim Darwish Grammar School for Boys.\nHigher education.\nThere are three universities in the City of Manchester: the University of Manchester, Manchester Metropolitan University and the Royal Northern College of Music. The three universities are grouped around Oxford Road on the southern side of the city centre, which forms Europe's largest urban higher-education precinct. Together they have a combined population of over 80,000 students as of 2022. There are also two other universities in the wider Manchester region, the University of Salford and the University of Greater Manchester (formerly the University of Bolton). The total student population of these five institutions exceed 100,000.\nThe University of Manchester is the second largest full-time non-collegiate university in the United Kingdom, and was created in 2004 through the merger of Victoria University of Manchester (founded 1904) and the University of Manchester Institute of Science and Technology (founded 1956); the idea of a joint university had developed from the Mechanics' Institute, founded in 1824. The University of Manchester also includes the Manchester Business School, which offered the first Master of Business Administration course in the UK in 1965.\nAccording to the \"Complete University Guide\", the University of Manchester ranks at number 28 in the United Kingdom, Manchester Metropolitan University ranks at 50, and the University of Greater Manchester comes 102 out of 130 universities. \"The Guardian University Guide\" ranks the three as 31, 57, and 32 respectively; \"The Times Good University Guide\" ranks them as 27, 119, and 46 respectively. The University of Manchester is also one of the 24 universities that form the Russell Group, having been a founding member in 1994. The university has been the site of a number of important scientific developments. Ernest Rutherford led a team which first discovered the nuclear atom and inaugurated the beginnings of nuclear physics in 1919; Frederic C. Williams, Tom Kilburn and Geoff Tootill developed the world's first Stored-program computer, the Manchester Baby, in 1948; and Andre Geim and Konstantin Novoselov first isolated graphene in 2004.\nManchester Metropolitan University was formed as Manchester Polytechnic on the merger of three colleges in 1970. It gained university status in 1992, and in the same year absorbed Crewe and Alsager College of Higher Education in South Cheshire. The Cheshire campus permanently closed in 2019. The University of Law, the largest provider of vocation legal training in Europe, has a campus in the city.\nSport.\nTwo Premier League football clubs bear the city's name \u2013 Manchester City and Manchester United. Manchester City's home is the City of Manchester Stadium in east Manchester, built for the 2002 Commonwealth Games and then reconfigured as a football ground in 2003. Manchester United, despite originating in Manchester, have been based in the neighbouring borough of Trafford since 1910. Their stadium Old Trafford is adjacent to Lancashire County Cricket Club ground, also called Old Trafford. The cricket club has strong association with Manchester due to proximity to the city and Manchester historically being part of Lancashire.\nSporting facilities built for the 2002 Commonwealth Games include the City of Manchester Stadium, National Squash Centre and Manchester Aquatics Centre. Manchester has competed twice to host the Olympic Games, beaten by Atlanta for 1996 and Sydney for 2000. The National Cycling Centre includes a velodrome, BMX Arena and Mountainbike trials, and is the home of British Cycling, UCI ProTeam Team Sky and Sky Track Cycling. The Manchester Velodrome, built as a part of the bid for the 2000 games, has become a catalyst for British success in cycling.\nThe velodrome hosted the UCI Track Cycling World Championships for a record third time in 2008. The National Indoor BMX Arena (2,000 capacity) adjacent to the velodrome opened in 2011. The Manchester Arena hosted the FINA World Swimming Championships in 2008. Manchester hosted the 2008 World Squash Championships, the 2010 World Lacrosse Championship, the 2013 Ashes series, the 2013 Rugby League World Cup, the 2015 Rugby World Cup, the 2019 Ashes series, and the 2019 Cricket World Cup.\nMedia.\nPrint.\n\"The Guardian\" newspaper was founded in the city in 1821 as \"The Manchester Guardian\". Until 2008, its head office was still in the city, though many of its management functions were moved to London in 1964. For many years most national newspapers had offices in Manchester: \"The Daily Telegraph\", \"Daily Express\", \"Daily Mail\", \"Daily Mirror\", \"The Sun\". At its height, 1,500 journalists were employed, earning the city the nickname \"second Fleet Street\". In the 1980s the titles closed their northern offices and centred their operations in London.\nAn attempt to launch a Northern daily newspaper, the \"North West Times\", employing journalists made redundant by other titles, closed in 1988. Another attempt was made with the \"North West Enquirer\", which hoped to provide a true \"regional\" newspaper for the North West, much in the same vein as the \"Yorkshire Post\" does for Yorkshire or \"The Northern Echo\" does for the North East; it folded in October 2006.\nThe main regional newspaper in the city is the \"Manchester Evening News\", which was for over 80 years the sister publication of \"The Manchester Guardian\". The \"Manchester Evening News\" has the largest circulation of a UK regional evening newspaper and is distributed free of charge in the city centre on Thursdays and Fridays, but paid for in the suburbs. Despite its title, it is available all day. Several local weekly free papers are distributed by the MEN group. The \"Metro North West\" is available free at Metrolink stops, rail stations and other busy locations.\nTelevision.\nManchester has been a centre of television broadcasting since the 1950s, with a number of television studios that have been in operation around the city. The ITV franchise Granada Television has been based in Manchester since 1954. Now based at MediaCityUK, the company's former headquarters at Granada Studios on Quay Street with its distinctive illuminated sign were a prominent landmark on the Manchester skyline for several decades. Granada produces \"Coronation Street\", local news and programmes for North West England. Although its influence has waned, Granada had been described as \"the best commercial television company in the world\". The Manchester television channel, Channel M, owned by the Guardian Media Group operated from 2000, but closed in 2012. Manchester is also covered by an internet television channel called Manchester TV.\nWith the growth in regional television in the 1950s, Manchester became one of the BBC's three main centres in England. In 1954, the BBC opened its first regional BBC Television studio outside London, Dickenson Road Studios, in a converted Methodist chapel in Rusholme. The first edition of \"Top of the Pops\" was broadcast here on New Year's Day 1964. From 1975, BBC programmes including \"Mastermind\" and \"Real Story\" were made at New Broadcasting House on Oxford Road. \"Cutting It\" and \"The Street\" were set in Manchester, as was \"Life on Mars\". Manchester was the regional base for BBC One North West Region programmes before it relocated to MediaCityUK in nearby Salford Quays.\nRadio.\nAs of 2016, Manchester has 10 licensed radio stations, which is the joint-fourth highest in the UK; the city is beaten only by London, Glasgow, and Birmingham, and ties with Cardiff and Edinburgh. Local radio stations include BBC Radio Manchester, Hits Radio Manchester, Capital Manchester and Lancashire, Greatest Hits Radio Manchester &amp; The North West, Heart North West, Smooth North West, Gold, Radio X and NMFM (North Manchester FM).\nStudent radio stations include Fuse FM at the University of Manchester and MMU Radio at the Manchester Metropolitan University. A community radio network is coordinated by Radio Regen, with stations covering Ardwick, Longsight and Levenshulme (All FM 96.9) and Wythenshawe (Wythenshawe FM 97.2). Defunct radio stations include Sunset 102, which became Kiss 102, then Galaxy Manchester, and KFM which became Signal Cheshire (later Imagine FM). Pirate radio played a significant role in the city's alternative rock culture during the 1960s and 1970s, as it allowed young people to listen to broadcasts that fell outside of the cultural standard.\nInternational relations.\nManchester is home to the largest group of consulates in England outside London. The expansion of international trade links during the Industrial Revolution led to the introduction of the first consuls in the 1820s and since then over 800, from all parts of the world, have been based in Manchester. Manchester hosts consular services for most of the north of England.\nSister cities.\nManchester is twinned with:\nGreater Manchester is twinned with Osaka, Japan since 2025 and also cooperates with numerous other cities.\nFriendship agreements.\nIn addition to its sister cities, Manchester has friendly relations with:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nDiplomatic missions.\nManchester has the following consulate-generals, the largest in England outside of London. Manchester formally had an Australian consulate (closed 2001), an Iranian consulate (closed 1987), and a US consulate (closed 1963). The current consulate-generals in Manchester, unless otherwise noted, are:\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The first woman to be appointed as a lecturer in archaeology in the United Kingdom, she worked at University College London (UCL) from 1898 to 1935. She was president of the Folklore Society from 1953 to 1955, and published widely.\nBorn to a wealthy middle-class English family in Calcutta, British India, Murray divided her youth between India, Britain, and Germany, training as both a nurse and a social worker. Moving to London, in 1894 she began studying Egyptology at UCL, developing a friendship with department head Flinders Petrie, who encouraged her early academic publications and appointed her junior lecturer in 1898. In 1902\u20131903, she took part in Petrie's excavations at Abydos, Egypt, there discovering the Osireion temple, and the following season investigated the Saqqara cemetery, both of which established her reputation in Egyptology. Supplementing her UCL wage by giving public classes and lectures at the British Museum and Manchester Museum, it was at the latter in 1908 that she led the unwrapping of Khnum-nakht, one of the mummies recovered from the Tomb of two Brothers\u00a0\u2013 the first time that a woman had publicly unwrapped a mummy. Recognising that British Egyptomania reflected the existence of widespread public interest in Ancient Egypt, Murray wrote several books on Egyptology targeted at a general audience.\nMurray became closely involved in the first-wave feminist movement, joining the Women's Social and Political Union and devoting much time to improving women's status at UCL. Unable to return to Egypt due to the First World War, she focused her research on the witch-cult hypothesis, the theory that the witch trials of Early Modern Christendom were an attempt to extinguish a surviving pre-Christian, pagan religion devoted to a Horned God. Although later academically discredited, the theory gained widespread attention and proved a significant influence on the emerging new religious movement of Wicca. From 1921 to 1931, she undertook excavations of prehistoric sites on Malta and Menorca and developed her interest in folkloristics. Awarded an honorary doctorate in 1927, she was appointed assistant professor in 1928 and retired from UCL in 1935. That year she visited Palestine to aid Petrie's excavation of Tall al-Ajjul and in 1937 she led a small excavation at Petra, Jordan. Taking on the presidency of the Folklore Society in later life, she lectured at such institutions as the University of Cambridge and City Literary Institute, and continued to publish until her death.\nMurray's work in Egyptology and archaeology was widely acclaimed and earned her the nickname of \"The Grand Old Woman of Egyptology\", although after her death many of her contributions to the field were overshadowed by those of Petrie. Conversely, Murray's work in folkloristics and the history of witchcraft has been academically discredited and her methods in these areas heavily criticised. The influence of her witch-cult theory in both religion and literature has been examined by scholars, and she herself has been dubbed the \"Grandmother of Wicca\".\nEarly life.\nYouth: 1863\u20131893.\nMargaret Murray was born on 13 July 1863 in Calcutta, then a major military city and the capital of British India. She lived in the city with her parents James and Margaret Murray, an older sister named Mary, and her paternal grandmother and great-grandmother. James Murray, born in India of Anglo-Irish descent, was a businessman and manager of the Serampore paper mills who was thrice elected President of the Calcutta Chamber of Commerce. Margaret (n\u00e9e Carr) had moved to India from Britain in 1857 to work as a missionary, preaching Christianity and educating Indian women. She continued with this work after marrying James and giving birth to her two daughters.\nAlthough most of their lives were spent in the European area of Calcutta, which was walled off from the Indian sectors of the city, Murray encountered members of Indian society through her family's employment of ten Indian servants and through childhood holidays to Mussoorie. The historian Amara Thornton has suggested that Murray's Indian childhood exerted an influence over her throughout her life, expressing the view that Murray could be seen as having a hybrid transnational identity that was both British and Indian. During her childhood, Murray received no formal education, and in later life expressed pride that she had never had to sit an exam before entering university. \nIn 1870, Margaret and her sister Mary were sent to Britain, moving in with their uncle John, a vicar, and his wife Harriet at their home in Lambourn, Berkshire. Although John provided them with a strongly Christian education and a belief in the inferiority of women, both of which she would reject, he awakened Murray's interest in archaeology through taking her to see local monuments. In 1873, the girls' mother arrived in Europe and took them with her to Bonn in Germany, where they both became fluent in German. In 1875 they returned to Calcutta, staying there until 1877. They then moved with their parents back to England, where they settled in Sydenham, London. There, they spent much time visiting The Crystal Palace, while their father worked at his firm's London office. \nIn 1880, they returned to Calcutta, where Margaret remained for the next seven years. She became a nurse at the Calcutta General Hospital, which was run by the Sisters of the Anglican Sisterhood of Clower, and there was involved with the hospital's attempts to deal with a cholera outbreak. In 1881, at age 18, Margaret heard about James Murray (no relation) and his \"general appeal to English speakers around the world to read their local books and send him words and quotations\" for entry into the OED. She had a routine of taking a book onto the roof in the cool early-morning air. She began with William L'Isle's edition of Aelfric's \"Saxon Treatise concerning the Old and New Testament\", from which she submitted 300 entries to Murray. She continued as a volunteer until 1888, submitting a total of 5,000 entries.\nIn 1887, she returned to England, moving to Rugby, Warwickshire, where her uncle John, now widowed, had moved. She took up employment as a social worker dealing with local underprivileged people. When her father retired to England, she moved into his house in Bushey Heath, Hertfordshire, living with him until his death in 1891. In 1893 she travelled to Madras, Tamil Nadu, where her sister had moved to with her new husband.\nLater in 1893, Murray received her first introduction to Egyptology when her elder sister, Mary, alerted her to an advertisement in \"The Times\" for classes in Egyptian hieroglyphs taught by Flinders Petrie, Murray's future mentor. Reflecting upon this in her autobiography, Murray notes it was her sister's insistence on attending these classes, largely spurred on by her own inability to do so, which set her down the path of her Egyptological career. \nEarly years at University College London: 1894\u20131905.\nEncouraged by her mother and sister, Murray decided to enrol at the newly opened department of Egyptology at University College London (UCL). At the time of Murray's enrolment, Egyptology was not a formally trained degree, with the exception of the University of Oxford, which offered Middle Egyptian amongst a trio of \"Oriental languages\". Having been founded by an endowment from Amelia Edwards, one of the co-founders of the Egypt Exploration Fund (EEF), the department was run by the pioneering early archaeologist Sir William Flinders Petrie, and based in the Edwards Library of UCL's South Cloisters. Murray began her studies at UCL at age 30 in January 1894, as part of a class composed largely of other women and older men. She took courses in the Ancient Egyptian and Coptic languages which were taught by Francis Llewellyn Griffith and Walter Ewing Crum respectively. \nMurray soon got to know Petrie, becoming his copyist and illustrator and producing the drawings for the published report on his excavations at Qift, \"Koptos\". In turn, he aided and encouraged her to write her first research paper, \"The Descent of Property in the Early Periods of Egyptian History\", which was published in the \"Proceedings of the Society for Biblical Archaeology\" in 1895. Becoming Petrie's \"de facto\" though unofficial assistant, Murray began to give some of the linguistic lessons in Griffith's absence. In 1898 she was appointed to the position of junior lecturer, responsible for teaching the linguistic courses at the Egyptology department; this made her the first female lecturer in archaeology in the United Kingdom. In this capacity, she spent two days a week at UCL, devoting the other days to caring for her ailing mother. As time went on, she came to teach courses on Ancient Egyptian history, religion, and language. \nAmong Murray's students\u00a0\u2013 to whom she referred as \"the Gang\"\u00a0\u2013 were several who went on to produce noted contributions to Egyptology, including Reginald Engelbach, Georgina Aitken, Guy Brunton, and Myrtle Broome. She supplemented her UCL salary by teaching evening classes in Egyptology at the British Museum.\nAt this point, Murray had no experience in field archaeology, and so during the 1902\u20131903 field season, she travelled to Egypt to join Petrie's excavations at Abydos. Petrie and his wife, Hilda Petrie, had been excavating at the site since 1899, having taken over the archaeological investigation from French Coptic scholar \u00c9mile Am\u00e9lineau. Murray at first joined as site nurse, but was subsequently taught how to excavate by Petrie and given a senior position.\nThis led to issues with some of the male excavators, who disliked the idea of taking orders from a woman. This experience, coupled with discussions with other female excavators (some of whom were active in the feminist movement), led Murray to adopt openly feminist viewpoints. While excavating at Abydos, Murray uncovered the Osireion, a temple devoted to the god Osiris which had been constructed by order of Pharaoh Seti I during the period of the New Kingdom. She published her site report as \"The Osireion at Abydos\" in 1904; in the report, she examined the inscriptions that had been discovered at the site to discern the purpose and use of the building.\nDuring the 1903\u20131904 field season, Murray returned to Egypt, and at Petrie's instruction began her investigations at the Saqqara cemetery near Cairo, which dated from the period of the Old Kingdom. Murray did not have legal permission to excavate the site, and instead spent her time transcribing the inscriptions from ten of the tombs that had been excavated in the 1860s by Auguste Mariette. She published her findings in 1905 as \"Saqqara Mastabas I\", although would not publish translations of the inscriptions until 1937 as \"Saqqara Mastabas II\". Both \"The Osireion at Abydos\" and \"Saqqara Mastabas I\" proved to be very influential in the Egyptological community, with Petrie recognising Murray's contribution to his own career.\nFeminism, the First World War, and folklore: 1905\u20131920.\nOn returning to London, Murray took an active role in the feminist movement, volunteering and financially donating to the cause and taking part in feminist demonstrations, protests, and marches. Joining the Women's Social and Political Union, she was present at large marches like the Mud March of 1907 and the Women's Coronation Procession of June 1911. She concealed the militancy of her actions in order to retain the image of respectability within academia. Murray also pushed the professional boundaries for women throughout her own career, and mentored other women in archaeology and throughout academia. As women could not use the men's common room, she successfully campaigned for UCL to open a common room for women, and later ensured that a larger, better-equipped room was converted for the purpose; it was later renamed the Margaret Murray Room. At UCL, she became a friend of fellow female lecturer Winifred Smith, and together they campaigned to improve the status and recognition of women in the university, with Murray becoming particularly annoyed at female staff who were afraid of upsetting or offending the male university establishment with their demands. Feeling that students should get nutritious yet affordable lunches, for many years she sat on the UCL Refectory Committee. She took on an unofficial administrative role within the Egyptology Department, and was largely responsible for introduction of a formal certificate in Egyptian archaeology in 1910.\nVarious museums around the United Kingdom invited Murray to advise them on their Egyptological collections, resulting in her cataloguing the Egyptian artefacts owned by the Dublin National Museum, the National Museum of Antiquities in Edinburgh, and the Society of Antiquaries of Scotland, being elected a Fellow of the latter in thanks.\nPetrie had established connections with the Egyptological wing of Manchester Museum in Manchester, and it was there that many of his finds had been housed. Murray thus often travelled to the museum to catalogue these artefacts, and during the 1906\u201307 school year regularly lectured there. \nIn 1907, Petrie excavated the Tomb of the Two Brothers, a Middle Kingdom burial of two Egyptian priests, Nakht-ankh and Khnum-nakht, and it was decided that Murray would carry out the public unwrapping of the latter's mummified body. Taking place at the museum in May 1908, it represented the first time that a woman had led a public mummy unwrapping and was attended by over 500 onlookers, attracting press attention. Murray was particularly keen to emphasise the importance that the unwrapping would have for the scholarly understanding of the Middle Kingdom and its burial practices, and lashed out against members of the public who saw it as immoral; she declared that \"every vestige of ancient remains must be carefully studied and recorded without sentimentality and without fear of the outcry of the ignorant\". She subsequently published a book about her analysis of the two bodies, \"The Tomb of the Two Brothers\", which remained a key publication on Middle Kingdom mummification practices into the 21st century.\nMurray was dedicated to public education, hoping to infuse Egyptomania with solid scholarship about Ancient Egypt, and to this end authored a series of books aimed at a general audience. In 1905 she published \"Elementary Egyptian Grammar\" which was followed in 1911 by \"Elementary Coptic (Sahidic) Grammar\". In 1913, she published \"Ancient Egyptian Legends\" for John Murray's \"The Wisdom of the East\" series. She was particularly pleased with the increased public interest in Egyptology that followed Howard Carter's discovery of the tomb of Pharaoh Tutankhamun in 1922. From at least 1911 until his death in 1940, Murray was a close friend of the anthropologist Charles Gabriel Seligman of the London School of Economics, and together they co-authored a variety of papers on Egyptology that were aimed at an anthropological audience. Many of these dealt with subjects that Egyptological journals would not publish, such as the \"Sa\" sign for the uterus, and thus were published in \"Man\", the journal of the Royal Anthropological Institute. It was at Seligman's recommendation that she was invited to become a member of the Institute in 1916.\nIn 1914, Petrie launched the academic journal \"Ancient Egypt\", published through his own British School of Archaeology in Egypt (BSAE), which was based at UCL. Given that he was often away from London excavating in Egypt, Murray was left to operate as \"de facto\" editor much of the time. She also published many research articles in the journal and authored many of its book reviews, particularly of the German-language publications which Petrie could not read.\nThe outbreak of the First World War in 1914, in which the United Kingdom went to war against Germany and the Ottoman Empire, meant that Petrie and other staff members were unable to return to Egypt for excavation. Instead, Petrie and Murray spent much of the time reorganising the artefact collections that they had attained over the past decades. To aid Britain's war effort, Murray enrolled as a volunteer nurse in the Volunteer Air Detachment of the College Women's Union Society, and for several weeks was posted to Saint-Malo in France. \nAfter being taken ill herself, she was sent to recuperate in Glastonbury, Somerset, where she became interested in Glastonbury Abbey and the folklore surrounding it which connected it to the legendary figure of King Arthur and to the idea that the Holy Grail had been brought there by Joseph of Aramathea. Pursuing this interest, she published the paper \"Egyptian Elements in the Grail Romance\" in the journal \"Ancient Egypt\", although few agreed with her conclusions and it was criticised for making unsubstantiated leaps with the evidence by the likes of Jessie Weston.\nLater life.\nWitch-cult, Malta, and Menorca: 1921\u20131935.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\nWhen I suddenly realised that the so-called Devil was simply a disguised man I was startled, almost alarmed, by the way the recorded facts fell into place, and showed that the witches were members of an old and primitive form of religion, and the records had been made by members of a new and persecuting form.\nMargaret Murray, 1963.\nMurray's interest in folklore led her to develop an interest in the witch trials of Early Modern Europe. In 1917, she published a paper in \"Folklore\", the journal of the Folklore Society, in which she first articulated her version of the witch-cult theory, arguing that the witches persecuted in European history were actually followers of \"a definite religion with beliefs, ritual, and organization as highly developed as that of any cult in the end\". She followed this up with papers on the subject in the journals \"Man\" and the \"Scottish Historical Review\". She articulated these views more fully in her 1921 book \"The Witch-Cult in Western Europe\", published by Oxford University Press after receiving a positive peer review by Henry Balfour, and which received both criticism and support on publication. Many reviews in academic journals were critical, with historians claiming that she had distorted and misinterpreted the contemporary records that she was using, but the book was nevertheless influential.\nAs a result of her work in this area, she was invited to provide the entry on \"witchcraft\" for the fourteenth edition of the \"Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica\" in 1929. She used the opportunity to propagate her own witch-cult theory, failing to mention the alternate theories proposed by other academics. Her entry would be included in the encyclopedia until 1969, becoming readily accessible to the public, and it was for this reason that her ideas on the subject had such a significant impact. It received a particularly enthusiastic reception by occultists such as Dion Fortune, Lewis Spence, Ralph Shirley, and J. W. Brodie Innes, perhaps because its claims regarding an ancient secret society chimed with similar claims common among various occult groups. Murray joined the Folklore Society in February 1927, and was elected to the society's council a month later, although she stood down in 1929. Murray reiterated her witch-cult theory in her 1933 book, \"The God of the Witches\", which was aimed at a wider, non-academic audience. In this book, she cut out or toned down what she saw as the more unpleasant aspects of the witch-cult, such as animal and child sacrifice, and began describing the religion in more positive terms as \"the Old Religion\".\nAt UCL, Murray was promoted to lecturer in 1921 and to senior lecturer in 1922. From 1921 to 1927, she led archaeological excavations on Malta, assisted by Edith Guest and Gertrude Caton Thompson. She excavated the Bronze Age megalithic monuments of Santa Sofia, Santa Maria tal-Bakkari, G\u0127ar Dalam, and Bor\u0121 in-Nadur, all of which were threatened by the construction of a new aerodrome. In this she was funded by the Percy Sladen Memorial Fund. Her resulting three-volume excavation report came to be seen as an important publication within the field of Maltese archaeology. During the excavations, she had taken an interest in the island's folklore, resulting in the 1932 publication of her book \"Maltese Folktales\", much of which was a translation of earlier stories collected by Manuel Magri and her friend Liza Galea. In 1932 Murray returned to Malta to aid in the cataloguing of the Bronze Age pottery collection held in Malta Museum, resulting in another publication, \"Corpus of the Bronze Age Pottery of Malta\".\nOn the basis of her work in Malta, Louis Clarke, the curator of the Cambridge Museum of Ethnology and Anthropology, invited her to lead excavations on the island of Menorca from 1930 to 1931. With the aid of Guest, she excavated the talaiotic sites of Trepuc\u00f3 and Sa Torreta de Tramuntana, resulting in the publication of \"Cambridge Excavations in Minorca\". Murray also continued to publish works on Egyptology for a general audience, such as \"Egyptian Sculpture\" (1930) and \"Egyptian Temples\" (1931), which received largely positive reviews. In the summer of 1925 she led a team of volunteers to excavate Homestead Moat in Whomerle Wood near to Stevenage, Hertfordshire; she did not publish an excavation report and did not mention the event in her autobiography, with her motives for carrying out the excavation remaining unclear.\nIn 1924, UCL promoted Murray to the position of assistant professor, and, in 1927, she was awarded an honorary doctorate for her career in Egyptology. That year, Murray was tasked with guiding Mary of Teck, the Queen consort, around the Egyptology department during the latter's visit to UCL. The pressures of teaching had eased by this point, allowing Murray to spend more time travelling internationally; in 1920 she returned to Egypt and in 1929 visited South Africa, where she attended the meeting of the British Association for the Advancement of Science, whose theme was the prehistory of southern Africa. In the early 1930s she travelled to the Soviet Union, where she visited museums in Leningrad, Moscow, Kharkiv, and Kyiv, and then in late 1935 she undertook a lecture tour of Norway, Sweden, Finland, and Estonia.\nAlthough having reached legal retirement age in 1927, and thus unable to be offered another five-year contract, Murray was reappointed on an annual basis each year until 1935. At this point, she retired, expressing the opinion that she was glad to leave UCL, for reasons that she did not make clear. In 1933, Petrie had retired from UCL and moved to Jerusalem in Mandatory Palestine with his wife; Murray therefore took over as editor of the \"Ancient Egypt\" journal, renaming it \"Ancient Egypt and the East\" to reflect its increasing research interest in the ancient societies that surrounded and interacted with Egypt. The journal folded in 1935, perhaps due to Murray's retirement. Murray then spent some time in Jerusalem, where she aided the Petries in their excavation at Tall al-Ajjul, a Bronze Age mound south of Gaza.\nPetra, Cambridge, and London: 1935\u20131953.\nDuring Murray's 1935 trip to Palestine, she visited Petra in neighbouring Jordan. Intrigued by the site, in March and April 1937 she returned in order to carry out a small excavation in several cave dwellings at the site, subsequently writing both an excavation report and a guidebook on Petra. Back in England, from 1934 to 1940, Murray aided the cataloguing of Egyptian antiquities at Girton College, Cambridge, and also gave lectures in Egyptology at the university until 1942. Her interest in folklore more broadly continued and she wrote the introduction to \"Lincolnshire Folklore\" by Ethel Rudkin, in which she discussed how superior women were as folklorists to men.\nDuring the Second World War, Murray evaded the Blitz of London by moving to Cambridge, where she volunteered for a group (probably the Army Bureau of Current Affairs or The British Way and Purpose) who educated military personnel to prepare them for post-war life. Based in the city, she embarked on research into the town's Early Modern history, examining documents stored in local parish churches, Downing College, and Ely Cathedral; she never published her findings. In 1945, she briefly became involved in the \"Who put Bella in the Wych Elm?\" murder case.\nAfter the war ended she returned to London, settling into a bedsit room in Endsleigh Street, which was close to University College London (UCL) and the Institute of Archaeology (then an independent institution, now part of UCL); she continued her involvement with the former and made use of the latter's library. On most days, she visited the British Museum in order to consult their library, and twice a week she taught adult education classes on Ancient Egyptian history and religion at the City Literary Institute; upon her retirement from this position she nominated her former pupil, Veronica Seton-Williams, to replace her.\nMurray's interest in popularising Egyptology among the wider public continued; in 1949 she published \"Ancient Egyptian Religious Poetry\", her second work for John Murray's \"The Wisdom of the East\" series. That year she also published \"The Splendour That Was Egypt\", in which she collated many of her UCL lectures. The book adopted a diffusionist perspective that argued that Egypt influenced Greco-Roman society and thus modern Western society. This was seen as a compromise between Petrie's belief that other societies influenced the emergence of Egyptian civilisation and Grafton Elliot Smith's highly unorthodox and heavily criticised hyperdiffusionist view that Egypt was the source of all global civilisation. The book received a mixed reception from the archaeological community.\nFinal years: 1953\u20131963.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\n[I] went to her hundredth birthday party where she sat enthroned\u2014no other word for it\u2014surrounded by family and friends. A distant cousin\u2014what we would have called an elderly lady of eighty\u2014was bringing greetings from even more distant relatives in Australia and suddenly forgot, as happens to many people half her age and a third of the age of Ma Murray, one name. \"How stupid of me, Cousin Margaret\", she said, \"how stupid the name has quite gone out of my head.\" Ma Murray focused her eyes on this old lady twenty years her junior\u2014cold eyes in which feeling seemed extinguished in the neutrality of eternity\u2014and said gently and kindly, \"Not stupidity, my dear. Not stupidity:\njust mental laziness.\"\n Glyn Daniel, 1964\nIn 1953, Murray was appointed to the presidency of the Folklore Society following the resignation of former president Allan Gomme. The Society had initially approached John Mavrogordato for the post, but he had declined, with Murray accepting the nomination several months later. Murray remained president for two terms, until 1955. In her 1954 presidential address, \"England as a Field for Folklore Research\", she lamented what she saw as the English people's disinterest in their own folklore in favour of that from other nations. For the autumn 1961 issue of \"Folklore\", the society published a \"festschrift\" to Murray to commemorate her 98th birthday. The issue contained contributions from various scholars paying tribute to her \u2013 with papers dealing with archaeology, fairies, Near Eastern religious symbols, Greek folk songs \u2013 but notably not about witchcraft, potentially because no other folklorists were willing to defend her witch-cult theory.\nIn May 1957, Murray had championed the archaeologist T. C. Lethbridge's controversial claims that he had discovered three pre-Christian chalk hill figures on Wandlebury Hill in the Gog Magog Hills, Cambridgeshire. Privately she expressed concern about the reality of the figures. Lethbridge subsequently authored a book championing her witch-cult theory in which he sought the cult's origins in pre-Christian culture. In 1960, she donated her collection of papers\u00a0\u2013 including correspondences with a wide range of individuals across the country\u00a0\u2013 to the Folklore Society Archive, where it is now known as \"the Murray Collection\".\nCrippled with arthritis, Murray had moved into a home in North Finchley, north London, where she was cared for by a retired couple who were trained nurses; from here she occasionally took taxis into central London to visit the UCL library.\nAmid failing health, in 1962 Murray moved into the Queen Victoria Memorial Hospital, Welwyn, Hertfordshire, where she could receive 24-hour care; she lived here for the final 18 months of her life. To mark her hundredth birthday, on 13 July 1963 a group of her friends, former students, and doctors gathered for a party at nearby Ayot St. Lawrence. Two days later, her doctor drove her to UCL for a second birthday party, again attended by many of her friends, colleagues, and former students; it was the last time that she visited the university. In \"Man\", the journal of the Royal Anthropological Institute, it was noted that Murray was \"the only Fellow of the Institute to [reach their centenary] within living memory, if not in its whole history\". That year she published two books; one was \"The Genesis of Religion\", in which she argued that humanity's first deities had been goddesses rather than male gods. The second was her autobiography, \"My First Hundred Years\", which received predominantly positive reviews. She died on 13 November 1963, and her body was cremated.\nMurray's witch-cult hypotheses.\nThe later folklorists Caroline Oates and Juliette Wood have suggested that Murray was best known for her witch-cult theory, with biographer Margaret S. Drower expressing the view that it was her work on this subject which \"perhaps more than any other, made her known to the general public\". It has been claimed that Murray's was the \"first feminist study of the witch trials\", as well as being the first to have actually \"empowered the witches\" by giving the (largely female) accused both free will and a voice distinct from that of their interrogators. The theory was faulty, in part because all of her academic training was in Egyptology, with no background knowledge in European history, but also because she exhibited a \"tendency to generalize wildly on the basis of very slender evidence\". \nOates and Wood, however, noted that Murray's interpretations of the evidence fit within wider perspectives on the past that existed at the time, stating that \"Murray was far from isolated in her method of reading ancient ritual origins into later myths\". In particular, her approach was influenced by the work of the anthropologist James Frazer, who had argued for the existence of a pervasive dying-and-resurrecting god myth, and she was also influenced by the interpretative approaches of E. O. James, Karl Pearson, Herbert Fleure, and Harold Peake.\nArgument.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\nThe extreme negative and positive reactions to \"The Witch-Cult in Western Europe\", as well as its legacy in religion and literature, register as responses to its fantastical form and content and especially to its implication of an alternate, woman-centered history of Western religion. At least one contemporary review turns Murray's suggestion of continuity between the premodern witches and contemporary women back on her in an ad hominem attack.\nMimi Winick, 2015.\nIn \"The Witch-Cult in Western Europe\", Murray stated that she had restricted her research to Great Britain, although made some recourse to sources from France, Flanders, and New England. She drew a division between what she termed \"Operative Witchcraft\", which referred to the performance of spells with any purpose, and \"Ritual Witchcraft\", by which she meant \"the ancient religion of Western Europe\", a fertility-based faith that she also termed \"the Dianic cult\". She claimed that the cult had \"very probably\" once been devoted to the worship of both a male deity and a \"Mother Goddess\" but that \"at the time when the cult is recorded the worship of the male deity appears to have superseded that of the female\". In her argument, Murray claimed that the figure referred to as the Devil in the trial accounts was the witches' god, \"manifest and incarnate\", to whom the witches offered their prayers. She claimed that at the witches' meetings, the god would be personified, usually by a man or at times by a woman or an animal; when a human personified this entity, Murray claimed that they were usually dressed plainly, though they appeared in full costume for the witches' Sabbaths.\nMembers joined the cult either as children or adults through what Murray called \"admission ceremonies\"; Murray asserted that applicants had to agree to join of their own free will, and agree to devote themselves to the service of their deity. She also claimed that in some cases, these individuals had to sign a covenant or were baptised into the faith. At the same time, she claimed that the religion was largely passed down hereditary lines. Murray described the religion as being divided into covens containing thirteen members, led by a coven officer who was often termed the \"Devil\" in the trial accounts, but who was accountable to a \"Grand Master\". According to Murray, the records of the coven were kept in a secret book, with the coven also disciplining its members, to the extent of executing those deemed traitors.\nDescribing this witch-cult as \"a joyous religion\", she claimed that the two primary festivals that it celebrated were on May Eve and November Eve, although that other dates of religious observation were 1 February and 1 August, the winter and summer solstices, and Easter. She asserted that the \"General Meeting of all members of the religion\" were known as Sabbaths, while the more private ritual meetings were known as Esbats. The Esbats, Murray claimed, were nocturnal rites that began at midnight, and were \"primarily for business, whereas the Sabbath was purely religious\". At the former, magical rites were performed both for malevolent and benevolent ends. She asserted the Sabbath ceremonies involved the witches paying homage to the deity, renewing their \"vows of fidelity and obedience\" to him, and providing him with accounts of all the magical actions that they had conducted since the previous Sabbath. Once this business had been concluded, admissions to the cult or marriages were conducted, ceremonies and fertility rites took place, and then the Sabbath ended with feasting and dancing.\nDeeming Ritual Witchcraft to be \"a fertility cult\", she asserted that many of its rites were designed to ensure fertility and rain-making. She claimed that there were four types of sacrifice performed by the witches: blood-sacrifice, in which the neophyte writes their name in blood; the sacrifice of animals; the sacrifice of a non-Christian child to procure magical powers; and the sacrifice of the witches' god by fire to ensure fertility.\nShe interpreted accounts of witches shapeshifting into various animals as being representative of a rite in which the witches dressed as specific animals which they took to be sacred. She asserted that accounts of familiars were based on the witches' use of animals, which she divided into \"divining familiars\" used in divination and \"domestic familiars\" used in other magic rites.\nMurray asserted that a pre-Christian fertility-based religion had survived the Christianization process in Britain, although that it came to be \"practised only in certain places and among certain classes of the community\". She believed that folkloric stories of fairies in Britain were based on a surviving race of dwarfs, who continued to live on the island up until the Early Modern period. She asserted that this race followed the same pagan religion as the witches, thus explaining the folkloric connection between the two. In the appendices to the book, she also alleged that Joan of Arc and Gilles de Rais were members of the witch-cult and were executed for it, a claim which has been refuted by historians, especially in the case of Joan of Arc.\nThe later historian Ronald Hutton commented that \"The Witch-Cult in Western Europe\" \"rested upon a small amount of archival research, with extensive use of printed trial records in 19th-century editions, plus early modern pamphlets and works of demonology\". He also noted that the book's tone was generally \"dry and clinical, and every assertion was meticulously footnoted to a source, with lavish quotation\". It was not a bestseller; in its first thirty years, only 2,020 copies were sold. However, it led many people to treat Murray as an authority on the subject; in 1929, she was invited to provide the entry on \"Witchcraft\" for the \"Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica\", and used it to present her interpretation of the subject as if it were universally accepted in scholarship. It remained in the encyclopedia until being replaced in 1969.\nMurray followed \"The Witch-Cult in Western Europe\" with \"The God of the Witches\", published by the popular press Sampson Low in 1931; although similar in content, unlike her previous volume it was aimed at a mass market audience. The tone of the book also differed strongly from its predecessor, containing \"emotionally inflated [language] and coloured with religious phraseology\" and repeatedly referring to the witch-cult as \"the Old Religion\". In this book she also \"cut out or toned down\" many of the claims made in her previous volume which would have painted the cult in a bad light, such as those which discussed sex and the sacrifice of animals and children.\nIn this book she began to refer to the witches' deity as the Horned God, and asserted that it was an entity who had been worshipped in Europe since the Palaeolithic.\nShe further asserted that in the Bronze Age, the worship of the deity could be found throughout Europe, Asia, and parts of Africa, claiming that the depiction of various horned figures from these societies proved that. Among the evidence cited were the horned figures found at Mohenjo-Daro, which are often interpreted as depictions of Pashupati, as well as the deities Osiris and Amon in Egypt and the Minotaur of Minoan Crete. Within continental Europe, she claimed that the Horned God was represented by Pan in Greece, Cernunnos in Gaul, and in various Scandinavian rock carvings. Claiming that this divinity had been declared the Devil by the Christian authorities, she nevertheless asserted that his worship was testified in officially Christian societies right through to the Modern period, citing folkloric practices such as the Dorset Ooser and the Puck Fair as evidence of his veneration.\nIn 1954, she published \"The Divine King in England\", in which she greatly extended on the theory, taking influence from Frazer's \"The Golden Bough\", an anthropological book that made the claim that societies all over the world sacrificed their kings to the deities of nature. In her book, she claimed that this practice had continued into medieval England, and that, for instance, the death of William II was really a ritual sacrifice.\nNo academic took the book seriously, and it was ignored by many of her supporters.\nAcademic reception.\nEarly support.\nUpon initial publication, Murray's thesis gained a favourable reception from many readers, including some significant scholars, albeit none who were experts in the witch trials. Historians of Early Modern Britain like George Norman Clark and Christopher Hill incorporated her theories into their work, although the latter subsequently distanced himself from the theory. For the 1961 reprint of \"The Witch-Cult in Western Europe\", the Medieval historian Steven Runciman provided a foreword in which he accepted that some of Murray's \"minor details may be open to criticism\", but in which he was otherwise supportive of her thesis. Her theories were recapitulated by Arno Runeberg in his 1947 book \"Witches, Demons and Fertility Magic\" as well as Pennethorne Hughes in his 1952 book \"Witches\". As a result, the Canadian historian Elliot Rose, writing in 1962, claimed that the Murrayite interpretations of the witch trials \"seem to hold, at the time of writing, an almost undisputed sway at the higher intellectual levels\", being widely accepted among \"educated people\".\nRose suggested that the reason that Murray's theory gained such support was partly because of her \"imposing credentials\" as a member of staff at UCL, a position that lent her theory greater legitimacy in the eyes of many readers. He further suggested that the Murrayite view was attractive to many as it confirmed \"the general picture of pre-Christian Europe a reader of Frazer or [Robert] Graves would be familiar with\". Similarly, Hutton suggested that the cause of the Murrayite theory's popularity was because it \"appealed to so many of the emotional impulses of the age\", including \"the notion of the English countryside as a timeless place full of ancient secrets\", the literary popularity of Pan, the widespread belief that the majority of British had remained pagan long after the process of Christianisation, and the idea that folk customs represented pagan survivals. At the same time, Hutton suggested, it seemed more plausible to many than the previously dominant rationalist idea that the witch trials were the result of mass delusion. \nRelated to this, the folklorist Jacqueline Simpson suggested that part of the Murrayite theory's appeal was that it appeared to give a \"sensible, demystifying, liberating approach to a longstanding but sterile argument\" between the rationalists who denied that there had been any witches and those, like Montague Summers, who insisted that there had been a real Satanic conspiracy against Christendom in the Early Modern period replete with witches with supernatural powers. \"How refreshing\", noted the historian Hilda Ellis Davidson, \"and exciting her first book was at that period. A new approach, and such a surprising one.\"\nEarly criticism.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSurely, discussion of what confessedly is so unripe is premature. When Miss Murray has broadened her study to all the lands where she can find the \"cult\"; when she has dealt with documents worthier the name of records than the chapbooks and the formless reports that have to serve us for the British trials; when she has traced back witch-sabbath and questionary through the centuries of witch and heretic hunting that precede the British; when she has trusted herself to study the work of other students and fairly to weigh their conclusions against her own in the light of the further evidence they may adduce: then perhaps she may have modified her views. Whether she changes or confirms them, she will then have earned the right to a hearing.\nGeorge L. Burr, 1922.\nMurray's theories never received support from experts in the Early Modern witch trials, and from her early publications onward many of her ideas were challenged by those who highlighted her \"factual errors and methodological failings\". Indeed, the majority of scholarly reviews of her work produced during the 1920s and 1930s were largely critical. George L. Burr reviewed both of her initial books on the witch-cult for the \"American Historical Review\". He stated that she was not acquainted with the \"careful general histories by modern scholars\" and criticised her for assuming that the trial accounts accurately reflected the accused witches' genuine experiences of witchcraft, regardless of whether those confessions had been obtained through torture and coercion. He also charged her with selectively using the evidence to serve her interpretation, for instance by omitting any supernatural or miraculous events that appear in the trial accounts. W. R. Halliday was highly critical in his review for \"Folklore\", as was E. M. Loeb in his review for \"American Anthropologist\".\nSoon after, one of the foremost specialists of the trial records, L'Estrange Ewen, brought out a series of books which rejected Murray's interpretation.\nRose suggested that Murray's books on the witch-cult \"contain an incredible number of minor errors of fact or of calculation and several inconsistencies of reasoning\". He accepted that her case \"could, perhaps, still be proved by somebody else, though I very much doubt it\". Highlighting that there is a gap of about a thousand years between the Christianisation of Britain and the start of the witch trials there, he argues that there is no evidence for the existence of the witch-cult anywhere in the intervening period. He further criticises Murray for treating pre-Christian Britain as a socially and culturally monolithic entity, whereas in reality, it contained a diverse array of societies and religious beliefs. He also challenges Murray's claim that the majority of Britons in the Middle Ages remained pagan as \"a view grounded on ignorance alone\".\nMurray did not respond directly to the criticisms of her work, but reacted to her critics in a hostile manner; in later life she asserted that she eventually ceased reading reviews of her work, and believed that her critics were simply acting out of their own Christian prejudices to non-Christian religion.\nSimpson noted that despite these critical reviews, within the field of British folkloristics, Murray's theories were permitted \"to pass unapproved but unchallenged, either out of politeness or because nobody was really interested enough to research the topic\". As evidence, she noted that no substantial research articles on the subject of witchcraft were published in \"Folklore\" between Murray's in 1917 and Rossell Hope Robbins's in 1963. She highlighted that when regional studies of British folklore were published in this period by folklorists like Theo Brown, Ruth Tongue, or Enid Porter, none adopted the Murrayite framework for interpreting witchcraft beliefs, thus evidencing her claim that Murray's theories were widely ignored by scholars of folkloristics.\nAcademic rejection.\nMurray's work was increasingly criticised following her death in 1963, with the definitive academic rejection of the Murrayite witch-cult theory occurring during the 1970s. During these decades, a variety of scholars across Europe and North America \u2013 such as Alan Macfarlane, Erik Midelfort, William Monter, Robert Muchembled, Gerhard Schormann, Bente Alver and Bengt Ankarloo \u2013 published in-depth studies of the archival records from the witch trials, leaving no doubt that those tried for witchcraft were not practitioners of a surviving pre-Christian religion.\nIn 1971, the English historian Keith Thomas stated that on the basis of this research, there was \"very little evidence to suggest that the accused witches were either devil-worshippers or members of a pagan fertility cult\". He stated that Murray's conclusions were \"almost totally groundless\" because she ignored the systematic study of the trial accounts provided by Ewen and instead used sources very selectively to argue her point.\nIn 1975, the historian Norman Cohn commented that Murray's \"knowledge of European history, even of English history, was superficial and her grasp of historical method was non-existent\", adding that her ideas were \"firmly set in an exaggerated and distorted version of the Frazerian mould\". That same year, the historian of religion Mircea Eliade described Murray's work as \"hopelessly inadequate\", containing \"numberless and appalling errors\". In 1996, the feminist historian Diane Purkiss stated that although Murray's thesis was \"intrinsically improbable\" and commanded \"little or no allegiance within the modern academy\", she felt that male scholars like Thomas, Cohn, and Macfarlane had unfairly adopted an androcentric approach by which they contrasted their own, male and methodologically sound interpretation against Murray's \"feminised belief\" about the witch-cult.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\n That this \"old religion\" persisted secretly, without leaving any evidence, is, of course, possible, just as it is possible that below the surface of the moon lie extensive deposits of Stilton cheese. Anything is possible. But it is nonsense to assert the existence of something for which no evidence exists. The Murrayites ask us to swallow a most peculiar sandwich: a large piece of the wrong evidence between two thick slices of no evidence at all.\nJeffrey B. Russell and Brooks Alexander, 2007.\nHutton stated that Murray had treated her source material with \"reckless abandon\", in that she had taken \"vivid details of alleged witch practices\" from \"sources scattered across a great extent of space and time\" and then declared them to be normative of the cult as a whole. Simpson outlined how Murray had selected her use of evidence very specifically, particularly by ignoring and/or rationalising any accounts of supernatural or miraculous events in the trial records, thereby distorting the events that she was describing. Thus, Simpson pointed out, Murray rationalised claims that the cloven-hoofed Devil appeared at the witches' Sabbath by stating that he was a man with a special kind of shoe, and similarly asserted that witches' claims to have flown through the air on broomsticks were actually based on their practice of either hopping along on broomsticks or smearing hallucinogenic salves onto themselves. Concurring with this assessment, the historian Jeffrey Burton Russell, writing with the independent author Brooks Alexander, stated that \"Murray's use of sources, in general, is appalling\". The pair went on to claim that \"today, scholars are agreed that Murray was more than just wrong \u2013 she was completely and embarrassingly wrong on nearly all of her basic premises\".\nThe Italian historian Carlo Ginzburg has been cited as being willing to give \"some slight support\" to Murray's theory. Ginzburg stated that although her thesis had been \"formulated in a wholly uncritical way\" and contained \"serious defects\", it did contain \"a kernel of truth\". He stated his opinion that she was right in claiming that European witchcraft had \"roots in an ancient fertility cult\", something that he argued was vindicated by his work researching the , an agrarian visionary tradition recorded in the Friuli district of Northeastern Italy during the 16th and 17th centuries. Several historians and folklorists have pointed out that Ginzburg's arguments are very different to Murray's: whereas Murray argued for the existence of a pre-Christian witches' cult whose members physically met during the witches' Sabbaths, Ginzburg argued that some of the European visionary traditions that were conflated with witchcraft in the Early Modern period had their origins in pre-Christian fertility religions. Moreover, other historians have expressed criticism of Ginzburg's interpretation of the ; Cohn stated that there was \"nothing whatsoever\" in the source material to justify the idea that the were the \"survival of an age-old fertility cult\". Echoing these views, Hutton commented that Ginzburg's claim that the 's visionary traditions were a survival from pre-Christian practices was an idea resting on \"imperfect material and conceptual foundations\". He added that Ginzburg's \"assumption\" that \"what was being dreamed about in the sixteenth century had in fact been acted out in religious ceremonies\" dating to \"pagan times\", was entirely \"an inference of his own\" and not one supported by the documentary evidence.\nPersonal life.\nOn researching the history of UCL's Egyptology department, the historian Rosalind M. Janssen stated that Murray was \"remembered with gratitude and immense affection by all her former students. A wise and witty teacher, two generations of Egyptologists have forever been in her debt.\" Alongside teaching them, Murray was known to socialise with her UCL students outside of class hours. \nArchaeologist Ralph Merrifield, who knew Murray through the Folklore Society, described her as a \"diminutive and kindly scholar, who radiated intelligence and strength of character into extreme old age\". Davidson, who also knew Murray through the Society, noted that at their meetings \"she would sit near the front, a bent and seemingly guileless old lady dozing peacefully, and then in the middle of a discussion would suddenly intervene with a relevant and penetrating comment which showed that she had missed not one word of the argument\". The later folklorist Juliette Wood noted that many members of the Folklore Society \"remember her fondly\", adding that Murray had been \"especially keen to encourage younger researchers, even those who disagreed with her ideas\".\nOne of Murray's friends in the Society, E. O. James, described her as a \"mine of information and a perpetual inspiration ever ready to impart her vast and varied stores of specialised knowledge without reserve, or, be it said, much if any regard for the generally accepted opinions and conclusions of the experts!\" Davidson described her as being \"not at all assertive[...] [she] never thrust her ideas on anyone. [In relation to her witch-cult theory,] she behaved in fact rather like someone who was a fully convinced member of some unusual religious sect, or perhaps, of the Freemasons, but never on any account got into arguments about it in public.\" The archaeologist Glyn Daniel observed that Murray remained mentally alert into her old age, commenting that \"her vigour and forthrightness and ruthless energy never deserted her\".\nMurray never married, instead devoting her life to her work, and for this reason, Hutton drew comparisons between her and two other prominent female British scholars of the period, Jane Harrison and Jessie Weston. Murray's biographer Kathleen L. Sheppard stated that she was deeply committed to public outreach, particularly when it came to Egyptology, and that as such she \"wanted to change the means by which the public obtained knowledge about Egypt's history: she wished to throw open the doors to the scientific laboratory and invite the public in\". She considered travel to be one of her favourite activities, although due to restraints on her time and finances she was unable to do this regularly; her salary remained small and the revenue from her books was meagre.\nRaised a devout Christian by her mother, Murray had initially become a Sunday School teacher to preach the faith, but after entering the academic profession she rejected religion, gaining a reputation among other members of the Folklore Society as a noted sceptic and a rationalist. She was openly critical of organised religion, although continued to maintain a personal belief in a God of some sort, relating in her autobiography that she believed in \"an unseen over-ruling Power\", \"which science calls Nature and religion calls God\".\nShe was also a believer and a practitioner of magic, performing curses against those she felt deserved it; in one case she cursed a fellow academic, Jaroslav \u010cern\u00fd, when she felt that his promotion to the position of Professor of Egyptology over her friend Walter Bryan Emery was unworthy. Her curse entailed mixing up ingredients in a frying pan, and was undertaken in the presence of two colleagues. In another instance, she was said to have created a wax image of Kaiser Wilhelm II and then melted it during the First World War. Ruth Whitehouse argues that, given Murray's lack of mention of such incidents in her autobiography and generally rational approach, a \"spirit of mischief\" as opposed to \"a real belief in the efficacy of the spells\" may have motivated her practice of magic.\nLegacy.\nIn academia.\nHutton noted that Murray was one of the earliest women to \"make a serious impact upon the world of professional scholarship\", and the archaeologist Niall Finneran described her as \"one of the greatest characters of post-war British archaeology\". Upon her death, Daniel referred to her as \"the Grand Old Woman of Egyptology\", with Hutton noting that Egyptology represented \"the core of her academic career\". In 2014, Thornton referred to her as \"one of Britain's most famous Egyptologists\". \nHowever, according to the archaeologist Ruth Whitehouse, Murray's contributions to archaeology and Egyptology were often overlooked as her work was overshadowed by that of Petrie, to the extent that she was often thought of primarily as one of Petrie's assistants rather than as a scholar in her own right. By her retirement she had come to be highly regarded within the discipline, although, according to Whitehouse, Murray's reputation declined following her death, something that Whitehouse attributed to the rejection of her witch-cult theory and the general erasure of women archaeologists from the discipline's male-dominated history.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\nNo British folklorist can remember Dr Margaret Murray without embarrassment and a sense of paradox. She is one of the few folklorists whose name became widely known to the public, but among scholars, her reputation is deservedly low; her theory that witches were members of a huge secret society preserving a prehistoric fertility cult through the centuries is now seen to be based on deeply flawed\nmethods and illogical arguments. The fact that, in her old age and after three increasingly eccentric books, she was made President of the Folklore Society, must certainly have harmed the reputation of the Society and possibly the status of folkloristics in this country; it helps to explain the mistrust some historians still feel towards our discipline.\nJacqueline Simpson, 1994.\nIn his obituary for Murray in \"Folklore\", James noted that her death was \"an event of unusual interest and importance in the annals of the Folk-Lore Society in particular as well as in the wider sphere in which her influence was felt in so many directions and\ndisciplines\". However, later academic folklorists, such as Simpson and Wood, have cited Murray and her witch-cult theory as an embarrassment to their field, and to the Folklore Society specifically. Simpson suggested that Murray's position as President of the Society was a causal factor in the mistrustful attitude that many historians held toward folkloristics as an academic discipline, as they erroneously came to believe that all folklorists endorsed Murray's ideas. Similarly, Catherine Noble stated that \"Murray caused considerable damage to the study of witchcraft\".\nIn 1935, UCL introduced the Margaret Murray Prize, awarded to the student who is deemed to have produced the best dissertation in Egyptology; it continued to be presented annually into the 21st century. In 1969, UCL named one of their common rooms in her honour, but it was converted into an office in 1989. \nIn June 1983, Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother visited the room and there was gifted a copy of Murray's \"My First Hundred Years\". UCL also hold two busts of Murray, one kept in the Petrie Museum and the other in the library of the UCL Institute of Archaeology. This sculpture was commissioned by one of her students, Violet MacDermot, and produced by the artist Stephen Rickard. UCL also possess a watercolour painting of Murray by Winifred Brunton; formerly exhibited in the Petrie Gallery, it was later placed into the Art Collection stores.\nIn 2013, on the 150th anniversary of Murray's birth and the 50th of her death, the UCL Institute of Archaeology's Ruth Whitehouse described Murray as \"a remarkable woman\" whose life was \"well worth celebrating, both in the archaeological world at large and especially in UCL\".\nThe historian of archaeology Rosalind M. Janssen titled her study of Egyptology at UCL \"The First Hundred Years\" \"as a tribute\" to Murray. Murray's friend Margaret Stefana Drower authored a short biography of her, which was included as a chapter in the 2004 edited volume on \"Breaking Ground: Pioneering Women Archaeologists\". In 2013, Lexington Books published \"The Life of Margaret Alice Murray: A Woman's Work in Archaeology\", a biography of Murray authored by Kathleen L. Sheppard, then an assistant professor at Missouri University of Science and Technology; the book was based upon Sheppard's doctoral dissertation produced at the University of Oklahoma. Although characterising it as being \"written in a clear and engaging manner\", one reviewer noted that Sheppard's book focuses on Murray the \"scientist\" and as such neglects to discuss Murray's involvement in magical practices and her relationship with Wicca.\nIn Wicca.\nMurray's witch-cult theories provided the blueprint for the contemporary Pagan religion of Wicca, with Murray being referred to as the \"Grandmother of Wicca\". The Pagan studies scholar Ethan Doyle White stated that it was the theory which \"formed the historical narrative around which Wicca built itself\", for on its emergence in England during the 1940s and 1950s, Wicca claimed to be the survival of this witch-cult. Wicca's theological structure, revolving around a Horned God and Mother Goddess, was adopted from Murray's ideas about the ancient witch-cult, and Wiccan groups were named \"covens\" and their meetings termed \"esbats\", both words that Murray had popularised. As with Murray's witch-cult, Wicca's practitioners entered via an initiation ceremony; Murray's claims that witches wrote down their spells in a book may have been an influence on Wicca's Book of Shadows. Wicca's early system of seasonal festivities were also based on Murray's framework.\nNoting that there is no evidence of Wicca existing before the publication of Murray's books, Merrifield commented that for those in 20th century Britain who wished to form their own witches' covens, \"Murray may have seemed the ideal fairy godmother, and her theory became the pumpkin coach that could transport them into the realm of fantasy for which they longed\". The historian Philip Heselton suggested that the New Forest coven \u2013 the oldest alleged Wiccan group \u2013 was founded \"circa\" 1935 by esotericists aware of Murray's theory and who may have believed themselves to be reincarnated witch-cult members. It was Gerald Gardner, who claimed to be an initiate of the New Forest coven, who established the tradition of Gardnerian Wicca and popularised the religion; according to Simpson, Gardner was the only member of the Folklore Society to \"wholeheartedly\" accept Murray's witch-cult hypothesis. The duo knew each other, with Murray writing the foreword to Gardner's 1954 book \"Witchcraft Today\", although in that foreword she did not explicitly specify whether she believed Gardner's claim that he had discovered a survival of her witch-cult. In 2005, Noble suggested that \"Murray's name might be all but forgotten today if it were not for Gerald Gardner\".\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\nAs the religion [of Wicca] emerged, many practitioners saw those who suffered in the [witch trials of the Early Modern] as their forebears, thus adopting the Murrayite witch-cult hypothesis which provided Wicca with a history stretching back far into the reaches of the ancient past. As historians challenged and demolished this theory in the 1960s and 1970s, many Wiccans were shocked. Some accepted that the theory was not actually legitimate, instead portraying the Murrayite story as a mythical history for the Craft and seeking to emphasise the religion's other historical antecessors. Other practitioners however vehemently defended Murray's hypothesis against academic critique, viewing it as a significant article of faith.\nEthan Doyle White, 2016.\nMurray's witch-cult theories were likely also a core influence on the non-Gardnerian Wiccan traditions that were established in Britain and Australia between 1930 and 1970 by the likes of Bob Clay-Egerton, Robert Cochrane, Charles Cardell, and Rosaleen Norton.\nThe prominent Wiccan Doreen Valiente eagerly searched for what she believed were other surviving remnants of the Murrayite witch-cult around Britain. Valiente remained committed to a belief in Murray's witch-cult after its academic rejection, and she described Murray as \"a remarkable woman\". \nIn San Francisco during the late 1960s, Murray's writings were among the sources used by Aidan A. Kelly in the creation of his Wiccan tradition, the New Reformed Orthodox Order of the Golden Dawn. In Los Angeles during the early 1970s, they were used by Zsuzsanna Budapest when she was establishing her feminist-oriented tradition of Dianic Wicca. The Murrayite witch-cult theory also provided the basis for the ideas espoused in \"Witchcraft and the Gay Counterculture\", a 1978 book written by the American gay liberation activist Arthur Evans.\nMembers of the Wiccan community gradually became aware of academia's rejection of the witch-cult theory. Accordingly, belief in its literal truth declined during the 1980s and 1990s, with many Wiccans instead coming to view it as a myth that conveyed metaphorical or symbolic truths. Others insisted that the historical origins of the religion did not matter and that instead Wicca was legitimated by the spiritual experiences it gave to its participants. In response, Hutton authored \"The Triumph of the Moon\", a historical study exploring Wicca's early development; on publication in 1999 the book exerted a strong impact on the British Pagan community, further eroding belief in the Murrayite theory among Wiccans. Conversely, other practitioners clung on to the theory, treating it as an important article of faith and rejecting post-Murrayite scholarship on European witchcraft. Several prominent practitioners continued to insist that Wicca was a religion with origins stretching back to the Palaeolithic, but others rejected the validity of historical scholarship and emphasised intuition and emotion as the arbiter of truth. A few \"counter-revisionist\" Wiccans \u2013 among them Donald H. Frew, Jani Farrell-Roberts, and Ben Whitmore \u2013 published critiques in which they attacked post-Murrayite scholarship on matters of detail, but none defended Murray's original hypothesis completely.\nIn literature.\nSimpson noted that the publication of the Murray thesis in the \"Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica\" made it accessible to \"journalists, film-makers popular novelists and thriller writers\", who adopted it \"enthusiastically\". It influenced the work of Aldous Huxley and Robert Graves. Murray's ideas shaped the depiction of paganism in the work of historical novelist Rosemary Sutcliff. Murray's ideas about religion can also be discerned in the fictions of another British historical novelist, Henry Treece. It was also an influence on the American horror author H. P. Lovecraft, who cited \"The Witch-Cult in Western Europe\" in his writings about the fictional cult of Cthulhu. Another horror writer, Dennis Wheatley, incorporated Murray's ideas about witchcraft into his novel \"The Devil Rides Out\" and cited Murray's work in his non-fiction book on the occult, \"The Devil and all his Works\". \nThe author Sylvia Townsend Warner cited Murray's work on the witch-cult as an influence on her 1926 novel \"Lolly Willowes\", and sent a copy of her book to Murray in appreciation, with the two meeting for lunch shortly after. There was nevertheless some difference in their depictions of the witch-cult; whereas Murray had depicted an organised pre-Christian cult, Warner depicted a vague family tradition that was explicitly Satanic.\nIn 1927, Warner lectured on the subject of witchcraft, exhibiting a strong influence from Murray's work. Analysing the relationship between Murray and Warner, the English literature scholar Mimi Winick characterised both as being \"engaged in imagining new possibilities for women in modernity\".\nThe fantasy novel Lammas Night is based on the same idea of the role of the royal family.\nBibliography.\nA bibliography of Murray's published work was published in \"Folklore\" by Wilfrid Bonser in 1961, her friend Drower produced a posthumous limited bibliography in 2004, and another limited bibliography appeared in Kathleen L. Sheppard's 2013 biography of her.\nReferences.\nFootnotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Its height, as of 2014[ [update]], is listed as . It is situated in the Southern Alps, the mountain range that runs the length of the South Island. A popular tourist destination, it is also a favourite challenge for mountaineers. Aoraki / Mount Cook consists of three summits: from south to north, the Low Peak (), the Middle Peak () and the High Peak. The summits lie slightly south and east of the main divide of the Southern Alps, with the Tasman Glacier to the east and the Hooker Glacier to the southwest. Mount Cook is ranked 10th in the world by topographic isolation.\nLocation.\nThe mountain is in the Aoraki / Mount Cook National Park, in the Canterbury Region. The park was established in 1953 and along with Westland Tai Poutini National Park, Mount Aspiring National Park and Fiordland National Park forms one of the UNESCO World Heritage Sites. The park contains more than 140 peaks standing over and 72 named glaciers, which cover 40 percent of its .\nThe peak is located at the northern end of the Mount Cook Range, where it meets with the main spine of the Main Divide, forming a massif between the Hooker Valley to the southwest and the Tasman Valley east of the mountain. These two valleys provide the closest easily accessible view points of Aoraki / Mount Cook. A lookout point at the end of the Hooker Valley Track located only from the peak has views of the entire mountainside.\nThe settlement of Mount Cook Village, also referred to as \"Aoraki / Mount Cook\", is a tourist centre and base camp for the mountain. It is from the end of the Tasman Glacier and south of Aoraki / Mount Cook's summit.\nOn clear days, Aoraki / Mount Cook is visible from the West Coast as far north as Greymouth, some away, and from most of State Highway 80 along Lake Pukaki and State Highway 6 south of Lake Pukaki. The near horizontal ridge connecting the mountain's three summits forms a distinctive blocky shape when viewed from an eastern or western direction.\nAnother popular view point is from Lake Matheson on the West Coast, described as the \"view of views\", where on calm days, the peaks of Aoraki / Mount Cook and Mt Tasman are reflected in Lake Matheson.\nLocal climate.\nAoraki / Mount Cook receives substantial orographic precipitation throughout the year, as breezy, moisture-laden westerly winds dominate all year-round, bringing rainclouds from the Tasman Sea with them.\nAnnual precipitation around the mountain ranges varies greatly as the local climate is dominated by the eastward movement of depressions and anticyclones from across the Tasman Sea. The Aoraki / Mount Cook massif is a major obstacle to the prevailing westerly winds as they push depressions and associated cold fronts of moist air from the subtropics in the northwest against the mountain range. As the air rises towards the peaks, it expands and cools, and forms clouds. Rain and snowfall are often heaviest around the level and can last for several days if the front is slow-moving.\nAs a result of the local weather patterns, the western slopes of Aoraki / Mount Cook can receive well over of annual precipitation, whereas the nearby Mount Cook Village, only south of the mountain, receives of rain or snowfall.\nWhile the weather on the eastern side of the mountain is generally better, rain or snow can quickly become widespread on that side as well if the wind turns to the south or southeast. This brings with it a rapid drop in temperature and poor visibility, adding to the difficult climbing conditions on Aoraki / Mount Cook.\nTemperatures at the mountain's base in the Hooker Valley around range from to , and generally fall just over 1\u00a0\u00b0C (1.8\u00a0\u00b0F) for every of altitude.\nFrom about and higher, semi-permanent snow and ice fields exist during winter. Winter and spring are usually less settled than summer and autumn. Anticyclones often bring days of settled weather in summer, or clear cold conditions in winter with severe frost.\nNaming and European discovery.\nIn the traditions of the Ng\u0101i Tahu iwi an early name for the South Island is ' ('Aoraki's Canoe'). In the past many believed it meant \"Cloud Piercer\", a romantic rendering of the name's components: ' (world, daytime, cloud, etc.) and ' or ' (day, sky, weather, etc.). Historically, the M\u0101ori name has been spelt \"\", using the northern dialect.\nAoraki / Mount Cook became known to M\u0101ori after their arrival in New Zealand some time around the 14th century CE. The first Europeans who may have seen Aoraki / Mount Cook were members of Abel Tasman's crew, who saw a \"large land uplifted high\" (probably some part of the Southern Alps) while off the west coast of the South Island, just north of present-day Greymouth on 13 December 1642 during Tasman's first Pacific voyage. The English name of \"Mount Cook\" was given to the mountain in 1851 by Captain John Lort Stokes to honour Captain James Cook who surveyed and circumnavigated the islands of New Zealand in 1770. Captain Cook did not sight the mountain during his exploration.\nFollowing the settlement between Ng\u0101i Tahu and the Crown in 1998, a number of South Island place names were amended to incorporate their M\u0101ori names by the Ng\u0101i Tahu Claims Settlement Act 1998. The name of the mountain was officially changed from Mount Cook to Aoraki/Mount Cook to incorporate its historic M\u0101ori name. It is the only one of these names where the M\u0101ori name precedes the English. Under the settlement the Crown agreed to return title of Aoraki / Mount Cook to Ng\u0101i Tahu, who would then formally gift it back to the nation. Neither transfer has yet occurred, and Ng\u0101i Tahu can decide when this will happen.\nGeology.\nThe Southern Alps in the South Island were formed by tectonic uplifting and pressure as the Pacific and Indo-Australian Plates collided along the island's western coast. The uplifting continues, raising Aoraki / Mount Cook an average of each year. However, erosive forces are also powerful shapers of the mountains. The severe weather is due to the mountain's jutting into powerful westerly winds of the Roaring Forties which run around approximately 45\u00b0S latitude, south of both Africa and Australia. The Southern Alps are the first obstacle the winds encounter after South America, having moved east across the Southern Ocean.\nThe height of Aoraki / Mount Cook was established in 1881 by G. J. Roberts (from the west side) and in 1889 by T. N. Brodrick (from the Canterbury side). Their measurements agreed closely at . The height was reduced by when approximately 12\u201314 million cubic metres of rock and ice fell off the northern peak on 14 December 1991. Two decades of erosion of the ice cap exposed after this collapse reduced the height by another 30\u00a0m to 3,724\u00a0m.\nAoraki / Mount Cook lies in the centre of the distinctive Alpine Fault, a 650\u00a0km long active fault in the Southern Alps. It is responsible for the uplift of Aoraki / Mount Cook and is believed to move every 100 to 300 years. It last moved in 1717.\nSurrounding forests and glaciers.\nThe average annual rainfall in the surrounding lowlands, in particular to the west, is around . This very high rainfall leads to temperate rainforests in these coastal lowlands and a reliable source of snow in the mountains to keep the glaciers flowing. These include the Tasman Glacier to the east of the mountain and the smaller Hooker Glacier immediately to its south.\nThe vegetation in the valleys to the east, in particular the Tasman Valley, is noticeably less lush than that on the western slopes of the mountain. Forest would normally grow to about 1,300\u00a0m in this area, but a lack of soil due to scree, rock falls and the effects of glaciation prevent this in most localities around the mountain. Snow tussock and other alpine plants cling to as high as 1,900\u00a0m.\nAbove the snowline, only lichen can be found amongst the rock, snowfields and ice that dominate the highest parts of Aoraki / Mount Cook.\nClimbing history.\nThe first recorded attempt on the summit was made by the Irishman Rev. William S. Green, the Swiss hotelier Emil Boss, and the Swiss mountain guide Ulrich Kaufmann on 2 March 1882 via the Tasman and Linda Glaciers. They came within a few feet of the top, as did the 1890 ascent attempt by Mannering and Dixon.\nThe first known ascent was on 25 December 1894, when New Zealanders Tom Fyfe, John Michael (Jack) Clarke and George Graham reached the summit via the Hooker Valley and the north ridge. Despite an earlier failed attempt on 20 December, the local climbers were spurred on by their desire for the first ascent to be made by New Zealand mountaineers amid reports that the American mountaineer Edward FitzGerald had his eye on the summit.&lt;ref name=\"Aoraki/Mt Cook\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The party reached the summit at approximately 1:30pm after bounding up the last leg of the mountain full of excitement at reaching the top. The route they had successfully traversed was not repeated again until the 100th ascent over 60 years later in 1955.\nSwiss guide Matthias Zurbriggen of FitzGerald's party made the second ascent on 14 March 1895 from the Tasman Glacier side, via the ridge that now bears his name. This is credited as the first solo ascent, although Zurbriggen was accompanied part of the way up the ridge by J Adamson. After Zurbriggen's ascent it was another ten years before the mountain was climbed again. In February 1905 Jack Clarke with four others completed the third ascent following Zurbriggen's route. Clarke therefore became the first person to do a repeat ascent.\nThe first woman to ascend the mountain was Australian Freda Du Faur on 3 December 1910. Local guide George Bannister, a nephew of another guide, Butler Te Koeti of Ng\u0101i Tahu, was the first M\u0101ori to successfully scale the peak in 1912.\nA traverse of the three peaks was first accomplished in 1913 by Freda Du Faur and guides Alec and Peter Graham. This 'grand traverse' was repeated in January 1916 by Conrad Kain, guiding the 57-year-old Jane Thomson, considered at the time \"a marvellous feat unequalled for daring in the annals of the Southern Alps\".\nSir Edmund Hillary made his first ascent in January 1948. In February 1948 with Ruth Adams, Harry Ayres and Mick Sullivan, Hillary made the first ascent of the South Ridge to the Low Peak. To celebrate the life of Hillary the South Ridge was renamed as Hillary Ridge in August 2011.\nAoraki / Mount Cook is a technically challenging mountain with a high level of glaciation. Its level of difficulty is often underestimated and can change dramatically depending on weather, snow and ice conditions. The climb crosses large crevasses, and involves risks of ice and rock falls, avalanches and rapidly changing weather conditions.\nSince the early 20th century, around 80 people have died attempting to climb the mountain, making it New Zealand's deadliest peak. The climbing season traditionally runs from November to February, and hardly a season goes by without at least one fatality.\nM\u0101ori history, legends and traditions.\nAccording to M\u0101ori legend, Aoraki was a young boy who, along with his three brothers, were the sons of Rakinui, the Sky Father. On their voyage around the Papat\u016b\u0101nuku, the Earth Mother, their canoe became stranded on a reef and tilted. Aoraki and his brothers climbed onto the top side of their canoe. However, the south wind froze them and turned them to stone. Their canoe became the Te Waka o Aoraki, the South Island, and their prows, the Marlborough Sounds. Aoraki, the tallest, became the highest peak, and his brothers created the K\u0101 Tiritiri o te Moana, the Southern Alps.\nNg\u0101i Tahu, the main iwi (tribe) of New Zealand's southern region, consider Aoraki as the most sacred of the ancestors that they had descended from. Aoraki brings the iwi with its sense of community and purpose, and remains the physical form of Aoraki and the link between the worlds of the supernatural and nature.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Its specification is publicly documented and there are free software reference implementations available.\nMNG is closely related to the PNG image format. When PNG development started in early 1995, developers decided not to incorporate support for animation, because the majority of the PNG developers felt that overloading a single file type with both still and animation features is a bad design, both for users (who have no simple way of determining to which class a given image file belongs) and for web servers (which should use a MIME type starting with codice_1 for stills and codice_2 for animations\u2014GIF notwithstanding), but work soon started on MNG as an animation-supporting version of PNG. Version 1.0 of the MNG specification was released on 31 January 2001.\nFile support.\nSupport.\nGwenview has native MNG support. GIMP can export images as MNG files. Imagemagick can create a MNG file from a series of PNG files. With the MNG plugin, Irfanview can read a MNG file. If MPlayer is linked against libmng, it and all its graphical front-ends like Gnome MPlayer can display MNG files.\nMozilla browsers and Netscape 6.0, 6.01 and 7.0 included native support for MNG until the code was removed in 2003 due to code size and little actual usage, causing complaints on the Mozilla development site. Mozilla later added support for APNG as a simpler alternative. Similarly, early versions of the Konqueror browser included MNG support but it was later dropped. MNG support was never included in Google Chrome, Internet Explorer, Opera, or Safari.\nServer support.\nWeb servers are generally not pre-configured to support MNG files.\nThe MNG developers had hoped that MNG would replace GIF for animated images on the World Wide Web, just as PNG had done for still images. However, with the expiration of LZW patents and existence of other alternative file formats such as APNG, Flash, and SVG, web usage of MNG was far less than its developers had expected.\nTechnical details.\nThe structure of MNG files is essentially the same as that of PNG files, differing only in the slightly different signature (codice_3 in hexadecimal, where codice_4 is ASCII for \"MNG\" \u2013 see Portable Network Graphics: File header) and the use of a much greater variety of chunks to support all the animation features that it provides. Images to be used in the animation are stored in the MNG file as encapsulated PNG or JNG images.\nTo allow applications to include some level of MNG support without having to implement the entire MNG specification, two reduced-complexity versions of MNG are also defined: MNG-LC (low complexity) and MNG-VLC (very low complexity). These reduced specifications are conceptually similar to the \"SVG Basic\" and \"SVG Tiny\" subsets offered in the SVG standard.\nMNG does not have a registered MIME media type, but codice_5 or codice_6 can be used.\nMNG animations may be included in HTML pages using the codice_7 or codice_8 tag.\nSaving a file as MNG can be either lossy or lossless, depending on whether its frames are encoded in PNG (lossless) or JNG (lossy).\nAlternatives.\nMost modern web browsers support animations in APNG, SVG, WebP, and WebM. As of \u00a02024[ [update]] only Apple Safari supports HEIF and JPEG XL. Internet Explorer only supported GIF, CSS, and Flash animations.\nThe most common alternatives to MNG have been Animated GIF and \u2013 until it was deprecated in 2017 \u2013 Adobe Flash. GIF images are restricted to 256 colors with limited compression, but the format is supported in all graphical web browsers and is still widely used. \nAnimations can also be generated ad hoc in a browser with the CSS 3 features animations, transitions, and sprites, or with the web animations API of JavaScript, by specifying frames or motions of still images or rendered shapes. Ad-hoc animations can be resource-intensive, and they generally cannot be saved in a portable file or posted on imageboards.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

His parents, Isom and Mary, had both been slaves and as was common after the Civil War, they continued working on the same plantation, now as sharecroppers, for the same owner.\nJohn taught himself to play guitar at the age of nine. To earn extra money, his mother took in boarders. One of them, William Henry Carson, who played a guitar and was a friend of John's mother, often stayed at the Hurt home while courting a woman who lived nearby. When no one was around, John would play Carson's guitar. As a youth, he played old-time music for friends and at dances or at the local general store. His syncopated playing style was ideal for dancing.\nHe worked as a farmhand and sharecropper, sometimes working for the railroad into the 1920s. On occasion, a medicine show came through the area. Hurt recalled that one wanted to hire him: \"One of them wanted me, but I said no because I just never wanted to get away from home.\"\nFirst recordings.\nIn 1923, he played with the fiddle player Willie Narmour as a substitute for Narmour's regular partner, Shell Smith. When Narmour won first place in a fiddle contest in 1928 and got a chance to record for Okeh Records, he recommended Hurt, who by that time had a good reputation, to Okeh producer Tommy Rockwell. After auditioning \"Monday Morning Blues\" at his home, Hurt took part in two recording sessions where he recorded 20 songs, in Memphis and New York City. While in Memphis, he recalled seeing \"many, many blues singers ... Lonnie Johnson, Blind Lemon Jefferson, Bessie Smith, and lots, lots more.\" Hurt described his first recording session:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;... a great big hall with only the three of us in it: me, the man [Rockwell], and the engineer. It was really something. I sat on a chair, and they pushed the microphone right up to my mouth and told me that I couldn't move after they had found the right position. I had to keep my head absolutely still. Oh, I was nervous, and my neck was sore for days after.\nThe records sold modestly well, not only with the black community but also among southern whites. Hurt attempted further negotiations with Okeh to record again but Okeh declined since his record sales were only modest. Okeh went out of business during the Great Depression, and Hurt returned to Avalon and obscurity, working as a sharecropper and playing at local parties and dances.\nRediscovery and death.\nIn 1952, musicologist Harry Smith included John's version of \"Frankie and Johnny\" and \"Spike Driver Blues\" in his seminal collection \"The Anthology of American Folk Music\" which generated considerable interest in locating him. When a copy of his \"Avalon Blues\" was discovered in 1963, it led musicologist Dick Spottswood to locate Avalon, Mississippi on a map and ask his friend, Tom Hoskins, who was traveling that way, to enquire after Hurt.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\nAvalon, my home town, always on my mind / Avalon, my home town.\nMississippi John Hurt, \"Avalon Blues\"\nUpon locating Hurt, Hoskins persuaded him to perform several songs, to ensure that he was genuine. Hoskins was convinced and, seeing that Hurt's guitar playing skills were still intact, encouraged him to move to Washington, D.C., and perform for a broader audience. Early in 1963 Hurt recorded an album, \"Folk Songs and Blues\", that was released in August 1963 through Piedmont Records.\nThis added to the American folk music revival which was blooming at that time and inspired the search for and the rediscovery of many other bluesmen of Hurt's era such as Son House, Skip James, Bukka White, Mance Lipscomb and Lightnin' Hopkins. Hurt performed on the festival, university and coffeehouse concert circuits with other Delta blues musicians who were brought out of retirement. His performances in 1963 at the Newport Folk Festival and the Philadelphia Folk Festival caused his star to rise. In 1964, he recorded live for radio station WTBS-FM In Cambridge, Massachusetts as did Skip James.\nFor three years, Hurt performed extensively at colleges, concert halls, and coffeehouses, appearing on \"The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson\", on Pete Seeger's public TV show, \"Rainbow Quest\" alongside Sonny Terry and Brownie McGhee and Hedy West and had a write up in \"Time\". He also recorded three albums for Vanguard Records. Much of his repertoire was also recorded for the Library of Congress. His fans particularly liked the ragtime songs \"Salty Dog\", \"Candy Man\" and the blues ballads \"Spike Driver Blues\" (a variant of \"John Henry\") and \"Frankie\".\nHurt's influence spanned several music genres including blues, spirituals, country, bluegrass, folk, and contemporary rock and roll. A soft-spoken man, his nature reflected his work which was a mellow mix of country, blues, and old-time music.\nMississippi John Hurt made his last recordings at a hotel in New York City in February and July of that year though they were not released until 1972 on the Vanguard LP \"Last Sessions\". He died of a heart attack on November 2, 1966 at a hospital in Grenada, Mississippi.\nSeveral record labels recorded his songs. They have been covered by Bob Dylan, Dave Van Ronk, Jerry Garcia, Beck, Doc Watson, John McCutcheon, Taj Mahal, Bruce Cockburn, David Johansen, Bill Morrissey, Gillian Welch, The Be Good Tanyas, Josh Ritter, Chris Smither, Guthrie Thomas, Parsonsfield, and Rory Block among others.\nStyle.\nHurt used a syncopated finger picking style of guitar playing that he taught himself. He was influenced by few other musicians, among them was Rufus Hanks, an elderly, unrecorded blues singer from the Avalon area who played twelve-string guitar and harmonica.\nAccording to the music critic Robert Christgau, \"the school of John Fahey proceeded from his finger picking and while he's not the only quietly conversational singer in the modern folk tradition, no one else has talked the blues with such delicacy or restraint.\"\nTributes.\nThere was a memorial and museum dedicated to Hurt in Avalon, Mississippi, parallel to Rural Route 2, the rural road he grew up on. On February 20, 2024, it was destroyed in a fire the day after being made a National Landmark. Arson is not suspected.\nThe folk-rock band The Lovin' Spoonful took their name from a recurring phrase in Hurt's song \"Coffee Blues\".\nThe singer-songwriter Tom Paxton, who met Hurt and played on the same bill with him at the Gaslight in Greenwich Village around 1963, wrote and recorded a song about him in 1977, \"Did You Hear John Hurt?\".\nThe first track of John Fahey's 1968 solo acoustic guitar album \"Requia\" is \"Requiem for John Hurt\". Fahey's posthumous live album, \"The Great Santa Barbara Oil Slick\", also features a version of the piece, entitled \"Requiem for Mississippi John Hurt\".\nNorman Greenbaum's eclectic minor hit, \"Gondoliers, Shakespeares, Overseers, Playboys And Bums\" refers to Mississippi John Hurt singing the blues.\nThe British folk and blues artist Wizz Jones recorded a tribute song, \"Mississippi John\", for his 1977 album \"Magical Flight\".\nThe Delta blues artist Rory Block recorded the album \"Avalon: A Tribute to Mississippi John Hurt\", released in 2013 as part of her \"Mentor Series\".\nThe New England singer-songwriter Bill Morrissey released the Grammy-nominated album \"Songs of Mississippi John Hurt\" in 1999.\nIn 2017, Hurt's life story was told in the documentary series \"American Epic\". The film featured footage of Hurt performing and being interviewed, and improved restorations of his 1920s recordings. Director Bernard MacMahon stated that Hurt \"was the inspiration for \"American Epic\"\". Hurt's life was profiled in the accompanying book, \"\".\nIn 2023, \"Rolling Stone\" ranked Hurt at number 159 on its list of the 200 Greatest Singers of All Time.\nIn 2019 the Killer Blues Headstone Project placed a stone for Hurt at the family plot in Avalon.\nDiscography.\nStefan Wirtz's in depth, illustrated discography \nDixon, Robert M., Goodrich, John W. and Rye, Howard - \"Blues and Gospel Records, 1890-1943\", Fourth Edition \nAllMusic discography \nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "20216", "revid": "24902", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20216", "title": "Moravia", "text": "Historical region in the Czech Republic\nMoravia is a historical region in the east of the Czech Republic and one of three historical Czech lands, with Bohemia and Czech Silesia.\nThe medieval and early modern Margraviate of Moravia was a crown land of the Lands of the Bohemian Crown from 1348 to 1918, an imperial state of the Holy Roman Empire from 1004 to 1806, a crown land of the Austrian Empire from 1804 to 1867, and a part of Austria-Hungary from 1867 to 1918. Moravia was one of the five lands of Czechoslovakia founded in 1918. In 1928 it was merged with Czech Silesia, and then dissolved in 1948 during the abolition of the land system following the communist coup d'\u00e9tat.\nIts area of 22,623.41\u00a0km2 is home to about 3.0 million of the Czech Republic's 10.9 million inhabitants. The people are historically named Moravians, a subgroup of Czechs, the other group being called Bohemians. The land takes its name from the Morava river, which runs from its north to south, being its principal watercourse. Moravia's largest city and historical capital is Brno. Before being sacked by the Swedish army during the Thirty Years' War, Olomouc served as the Moravian capital, and it is still the seat of the Archdiocese of Olomouc. Until the expulsions after 1945, significant parts of Moravia were German speaking.\nToponymy.\nThe region and former margraviate of Moravia, \"Morava\", in Czech, is named after its principal river Morava.\nThe German name for Moravia is \"M\u00e4hren\", from the river's German name \"March\". This could have a different etymology, as \"march\" is a term used in the medieval times for an outlying territory, a border or a frontier (cf. English \"march\"). In Latin, the name Moravia was used.\nGeography.\nMoravia occupies most of the eastern part of the Czech Republic. Moravian territory is naturally strongly determined, in fact, as the Morava river basin, with strong effect of mountains in the west (\"de facto\" main European continental divide) and partly in the east, where all the rivers rise.\nMoravia occupies an exceptional position in Central Europe. All the highlands in the west and east of this part of Europe run west\u2013east, and therefore form a kind of filter, making north\u2013south or south\u2013north movement more difficult. Only Moravia with the depression of the westernmost Outer Subcarpathia, wide, between the Bohemian Massif and the Outer Western Carpathians (gripping the meridian at a constant angle of 30\u00b0), provides a comfortable connection between the Danubian and Polish regions, and this area is thus of great importance in terms of the possible migration routes of large mammals \u2013 both as regards periodically recurring seasonal migrations triggered by climatic oscillations in the prehistory, when permanent settlement started.\nMoravia borders Bohemia in the west, Lower Austria in the southwest, Slovakia in the southeast, Poland for a short distance in the north, and Czech Silesia in the northeast. Its natural boundary is formed by the Sudetes mountains in the north, the Carpathians in the east and the Bohemian-Moravian Highlands in the west (the border runs from Kr\u00e1lick\u00fd Sn\u011b\u017en\u00edk in the north, over Such\u00fd vrch, across the Upper Svratka Highlands and Javo\u0159ice Highlands to a tripoint near Slavonice in the south). The Thaya river meanders along the border with Austria, and the tripoint of Moravia, Austria and Slovakia is at the confluence of the Thaya and Morava rivers. The northeast border with Silesia runs partly along the Moravice, Oder and Ostravice rivers. Between 1782 and 1850, Moravia (also thus known as \"Moravia-Silesia\") also included a small portion of the former province of Silesia \u2013 the Austrian Silesia. (When Frederick the Great annexed most of ancient Silesia (the land of upper and middle Oder river) to Prussia, Silesia's southernmost part remained with the Habsburgs.)\nToday Moravia includes the South Moravian and Zl\u00edn regions, the vast majority of the Olomouc Region, the southeastern half of the Vyso\u010dina Region and parts of the Moravian-Silesian, Pardubice and South Bohemian regions.\nGeologically, Moravia covers an area between the Bohemian Massif and the Carpathians (from northwest to southeast), and between the Danube basin and the North European Plain (from south to northeast). Its core geomorphological features are three wide valleys, namely the Dyje-Svratka Valley (\"Dyjsko-svrateck\u00fd \u00faval\"), the Upper Morava Valley (\"Hornomoravsk\u00fd \u00faval\") and the Lower Morava Valley (\"Dolnomoravsk\u00fd \u00faval\"). The first two form the westernmost part of the Outer Subcarpathia; the last is the northernmost part of the Vienna Basin. The valleys surround the low range of Central Moravian Carpathians. The highest mountains of Moravia are situated on its northern border in Hrub\u00fd Jesen\u00edk; the highest peak is Prad\u011bd (1491\u00a0m). Second highest is the massif of Kr\u00e1lick\u00fd Sn\u011b\u017en\u00edk (1424\u00a0m) the third are the Moravian-Silesian Beskids at the extreme east, with Smrk (1278\u00a0m), and then south from here Javorn\u00edky (1072). The White Carpathians along the southeastern border rise up to 970\u00a0m at Velk\u00e1 Javo\u0159ina. The Bohemian-Moravian Highlands on the west reach 837\u00a0m at Javo\u0159ice.\nThe river system of Moravia is very cohesive, as the region's border closely follows the watershed of the Morava river, and thus almost the entire area is drained exclusively by a single stream. Easily the Morava's biggest tributaries are Thaya (Dyje) from the right (or west) and Be\u010dva (east). The Morava and the Thaya meet at the southernmost and lowest (148\u00a0m) point of Moravia. Small peripheral parts of Moravia belong to the catchment areas of Elbe, V\u00e1h and especially Oder (the northeast). The watershed line running along Moravia's border from west to north and east is part of the European Watershed. For centuries, there have been plans to build a waterway across Moravia to join the Danube and Oder river systems, using the natural route through the Moravian Gate.\nHistory.\nPre-history.\nEvidence of the presence of members of the human genus, \"Homo\", dates back more than 600,000 years in the paleontological area of Str\u00e1nsk\u00e1 sk\u00e1la.\nAttracted by suitable living conditions, early modern humans had settled in the region by the Paleolithic period. The P\u0159edmost\u00ed archeological (Cro-Magnon) site in Moravia is dated to between 27,000 and 24,000 years old. Caves in Moravian Karst were used by mammoth hunters. Venus of Doln\u00ed V\u011bstonice, the oldest ceramic figure in the world, was found in the excavation of Doln\u00ed V\u011bstonice by Karel Absolon. In November 2024 a new discovery was made on the outskirts of Brno, where bones of at least three mammoths were found along with other animals and human stone tools dating back 15,000 years.\nBronze Age.\nDuring the Bronze Age, people of various cultures settled in Moravia. Notably the Nitra culture which emerged from the tradition of the Neolithic Corded Ware culture and was spread in western Slovakia (hence the name, derived from Slovak river Nitra), eastern Moravia and southern Poland. The largest burial site (400 graves) of Nitra culture in Moravia was discovered in Hole\u0161ov in the 1960s.\nThe most recent discovery unearthed 2 settlements and two burial grounds (with total 130 graves) near Olomouc, one of them of the Nitra culture dating between the years 2100-1800 BC and was published in October 2024. This discovery adds up to other Bronze Age discoveries such as a sword found near the city of P\u0159erov, the sword was called \u2018the Excalibur of the Late Bronze Age\u2019.\nRoman era.\nAround 60 BC, the Celtic Volcae people withdrew from the region and were succeeded by the Germanic Quadi. Some of the events of the Marcomannic Wars took place in Moravia in AD 169\u2013180. After the war exposed the weakness of Rome's northern frontier, half of the Roman legions (16 out of 33) were stationed along the Danube. In response to increasing numbers of Germanic settlers in frontier regions like Pannonia, Dacia, Rome established two new frontier provinces on the left shore of the Danube, Marcomannia and Sarmatia, including today's Moravia and western Slovakia.\nIn the 2nd century AD, a Roman fortress stood on the vineyards hill known as and (\"hillfort\"), situated above the former village Mu\u0161ov and above today's beach resort at Pasohl\u00e1vky. During the reign of the Emperor Marcus Aurelius, the 10th Legion was assigned to control the Germanic tribes who had been defeated in the Marcomannic Wars. In 1927, the archeologist Gnirs, with the support of president Tom\u00e1\u0161 Garrigue Masaryk, began research on the site, located 80\u00a0km from Vindobona and 22\u00a0km to the south of Brno. The researchers found remnants of two masonry buildings, a \"praetorium\" and a \"balneum\" (\"bath\"), including a \"hypocaustum\". The discovery of bricks with the stamp of the Legio X Gemina and coins from the period of the emperors Antoninus Pius, Marcus Aurelius and Commodus facilitated dating of the locality.\nAncient Moravia.\nA variety of Germanic and major Slavic tribes crossed through Moravia during the Migration Period before Slavs established themselves in the 6th century AD. At the end of the 8th century, the Moravian Principality came into being in present-day south-eastern Moravia, Z\u00e1horie in south-western Slovakia and parts of Lower Austria. In 833 AD, this became the state of Great Moravia with the conquest of the Principality of Nitra (present-day Slovakia). Their first king was Mojm\u00edr I (ruled 830\u2013846). Louis the German invaded Moravia and replaced Mojm\u00edr I with his nephew Rastiz who became St. Rastislav. St. Rastislav (846\u2013870) tried to emancipate his land from the Carolingian influence, so he sent envoys to Rome to get missionaries to come. When Rome refused he turned to Constantinople to the Byzantine emperor Michael. The result was the mission of Saints Cyril and Methodius who translated liturgical books into Slavonic, which had lately been elevated by the Pope to the same level as Latin and Greek. Methodius became the first Moravian archbishop, the first archbishop in Slavic world, but after his death the German influence again prevailed and the disciples of Methodius were forced to flee. Great Moravia reached its greatest territorial extent in the 890s under Svatopluk I. At this time, the empire encompassed the territory of the present-day Czech Republic and Slovakia, the western part of present Hungary (Pannonia), as well as Lusatia in present-day Germany and Silesia and the upper Vistula basin in southern Poland. After Svatopluk's death in 895, the Bohemian princes defected to become vassals of the East Frankish ruler Arnulf of Carinthia, and the Moravian state ceased to exist after being overrun by invading Magyars in 907.\nUnion with Bohemia.\nFollowing the defeat of the Magyars by Emperor Otto I at the Battle of Lechfeld in 955, Otto's ally Boleslaus I, the P\u0159emyslid ruler of Bohemia, took control over Moravia. Boles\u0142aw I Chrobry of Poland annexed Moravia in 999, and ruled it until 1019, when the P\u0159emyslid prince Bretislaus recaptured it. Upon his father's death in 1034, Bretislaus became the ruler of Bohemia. In 1055, he decreed that Bohemia and Moravia would be inherited together by primogeniture, although he also provided that his younger sons should govern parts (quarters) of Moravia as vassals to his oldest son.\nThroughout the P\u0159emyslid era, junior princes often ruled all or part of Moravia from Olomouc, Brno or Znojmo, with varying degrees of autonomy from the ruler of Bohemia. Dukes of Olomouc often acted as the \"right hand\" of Prague dukes and kings, while Dukes of Brno and especially those of Znojmo were much more insubordinate. Moravia reached its height of autonomy in 1182, when Emperor Frederick I elevated Conrad II Otto of Znojmo to the status of a margrave, immediately subject to the emperor, independent of Bohemia. This status was short-lived: in 1186, Conrad Otto was forced to obey the supreme rule of Bohemian duke Frederick. Three years later, Conrad Otto succeeded to Frederick as Duke of Bohemia and subsequently canceled his margrave title. Nevertheless, the margrave title was restored in 1197 when Vladislaus III of Bohemia resolved the succession dispute between him and his brother Ottokar by abdicating from the Bohemian throne and accepting Moravia as a vassal land of Bohemian (i.e., Prague) rulers. Vladislaus gradually established this land as Margraviate, slightly administratively different from Bohemia. After the Battle of Legnica, the Mongols carried their raids into Moravia.\nThe main line of the P\u0159emyslid dynasty became extinct in 1306, and in 1310 John of Luxembourg became Margrave of Moravia and King of Bohemia. In 1333, he made his son Charles the next Margrave of Moravia (later in 1346, Charles also became the King of Bohemia). In 1349, Charles gave Moravia to his younger brother John Henry who ruled in the margraviate until his death in 1375, after him Moravia was ruled by his oldest son Jobst of Moravia who was in 1410 elected the Holy Roman King but died in 1411 (he is buried with his father in the Church of St. Thomas in Brno \u2013 the Moravian capital from which they both ruled). Moravia and Bohemia remained within the Luxembourg dynasty of Holy Roman kings and emperors (except during the Hussite wars), until inherited by Albert II of Habsburg in 1437.\nAfter his death followed the interregnum until 1453; land (as the rest of lands of the Bohemian Crown) was administered by the landfriedens (\"landfr\u00fddy\"). The rule of young Ladislaus the Posthumous subsisted only less than five years and subsequently (1458) the Hussite George of Pod\u011bbrady was elected as the king. He again reunited all Czech lands (then Bohemia, Moravia, Silesia, Upper &amp; Lower Lusatia) into one-man ruled state. In 1466, Pope Paul II excommunicated George and forbade all Catholics (i.e. about 15% of population) from continuing to serve him. The Hungarian crusade followed and in 1469 Matthias Corvinus conquered Moravia and proclaimed himself (with assistance of rebelling Bohemian nobility) as the king of Bohemia.\nThe subsequent 21-year period of a divided kingdom was decisive for the rising awareness of a specific Moravian identity, distinct from that of Bohemia. Although Moravia was reunited with Bohemia in 1490 when Vladislaus Jagiellon, king of Bohemia, also became king of Hungary, some attachment to Moravian \"freedoms\" and resistance to government by Prague continued until the end of independence in 1620. In 1526, Vladislaus' son Louis died in battle and the Habsburg Ferdinand I was elected as his successor.\nHabsburg rule (1526\u20131918).\nAfter the death of King Louis II of Hungary and Bohemia in 1526, Ferdinand I of Austria was elected King of Bohemia and thus ruler of the Crown of Bohemia (including Moravia). The epoch 1526\u20131620 was marked by increasing animosity between Catholic Habsburg kings (emperors) and the Protestant Moravian nobility (and other Crowns') estates. Moravia, like Bohemia, was a Habsburg possession until the end of World War I. In 1573 the Jesuit University of Olomouc was established; this was the first university in Moravia. The establishment of a special papal seminary, Collegium Nordicum, made the University a centre of the Catholic Reformation and effort to revive Catholicism in Central and Northern Europe. The second largest group of students were from Scandinavia.\nBrno and Olomouc served as Moravia's capitals until 1641. As the only city to successfully resist the Swedish invasion, Brno become the sole capital following the capture of Olomouc. The Margraviate of Moravia had, from 1348 in Olomouc and Brno, its own Diet, or parliament, \"zemsk\u00fd sn\u011bm\" (\"Landtag\" in German), whose deputies from 1905 onward were elected separately from the ethnically separate German and Czech constituencies. The oldest surviving theatre building in Central Europe, the Reduta Theatre, was established in 17th-century Moravia.\nFrom 1599 to 1711, Moravia was frequently subjected to raids by the Ottoman Empire and its vassals (especially the Tatars and Transylvania). Overall, hundreds of thousands were enslaved whilst tens of thousands were killed.\nIn 1740, Moravia was invaded by Prussian forces under Frederick the Great, and Olomouc was forced to surrender on 27 December 1741. A few months later, the Prussians were repelled, mainly because of their unsuccessful siege of Brno in 1742. In 1758, Olomouc was besieged by Prussians again, but this time its defenders forced the Prussians to withdraw following the Battle of Domstadtl. In 1777, a new Moravian bishopric was established in Brno, and the Olomouc bishopric was elevated to an archbishopric. In 1782, the Margraviate of Moravia was merged with Austrian Silesia into \"Moravia-Silesia\", with Brno as its capital. Moravia became a separate crown land of Austria again in 1849, and then became part of Cisleithanian Austria-Hungary after 1867. According to Austro-Hungarian census of 1910 the proportion of Czechs in the population of Moravia at the time (2,622,000) was 71.8%, while the proportion of Germans was 27.6%.\n20th century.\nFollowing the break-up of the Austro-Hungarian Empire in 1918, Moravia became part of Czechoslovakia. As one of the five lands of Czechoslovakia, it had restricted autonomy. In 1928 Moravia ceased to exist as a territorial unity and was merged with Czech Silesia into the Moravian-Silesian Land (yet with the natural dominance of Moravia). By the Munich Agreement (1938), the southwestern and northern peripheries of Moravia, which had a German-speaking majority, were annexed by Nazi Germany, and during the German occupation of Czechoslovakia (1939\u20131945), the remnant of Moravia was an administrative unit within the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia.\nDuring World War II, the Germans operated multiple forced labour camps in the region, including several subcamps of the Stalag VIII-B/344 prisoner-of-war camp for Allied POWs, a subcamp of the Auschwitz concentration camp in Brno for mostly Polish prisoners, and a subcamp of the Gross-Rosen concentration camp in B\u00edl\u00e1 Voda for Jewish women. The occupiers also established several POW camps, including Heilag VIII-H, Oflag VIII-F and Oflag VIII-H, for French, British, Belgian and other Allied POWs in the region.\nIn 1945 after the Allied defeat of Germany and the end of World War II, the German minority was expelled to Germany and Austria in accordance with the Potsdam Agreement. The Moravian-Silesian Land was restored with Moravia as part of it and towns and villages that were left by the former German inhabitants, were re-settled by Czechs, Slovaks and reemigrants. In 1949 the territorial division of Czechoslovakia was radically changed, as the Moravian-Silesian Land was abolished and Lands were replaced by \"kraje\" (regions), whose borders substantially differ from the historical Bohemian-Moravian border, so Moravia politically ceased to exist after more than 1100 years (833\u20131949) of its history. Although another administrative reform in 1960 implemented (among others) the North Moravian and the South Moravian regions (\"Severomoravsk\u00fd\" and \"Jihomoravsk\u00fd kraj\"), with capitals in Ostrava and Brno respectively, their joint area was only roughly alike the historical state and, chiefly, there was no land or federal autonomy, unlike Slovakia.\nAfter the fall of the Soviet Union and the whole Eastern Bloc, the Czechoslovak Federal Assembly condemned the cancellation of Moravian-Silesian land and expressed \"firm conviction that this injustice will be corrected\" in 1990. However, after the breakup of Czechoslovakia into Czech Republic and Slovakia in 1993, Moravian area remained integral to the Czech territory, and the latest administrative division of Czech Republic (introduced in 2000) is similar to the administrative division of 1949. Nevertheless, the federalist or separatist movement in Moravia is completely marginal.\nThe centuries-lasting historical Bohemian-Moravian border has been preserved up to now only by the Czech Roman Catholic Administration, as the Ecclesiastical Province of Moravia corresponds with the former Moravian-Silesian Land. The popular perception of the Bohemian-Moravian border's location is distorted by the memory of the 1960 regions (whose boundaries are still partly in use).\nEconomy.\nAn area in South Moravia, around Hodon\u00edn and B\u0159eclav, is part of the Viennese Basin. Petroleum and lignite are found there in abundance. The main economic centres of Moravia are Brno, Olomouc, Zl\u00edn, and Ostrava lying directly on the Moravian\u2013Silesian border. As well as agriculture in general, Moravia is noted for its viticulture; it contains 94% of the Czech Republic's vineyards and is at the centre of the country's wine industry. Wallachia has at least a 400-year-old tradition of slivovitz making.\nThe Czech automotive industry also played a significant role in Moravia's economy in the 20th century; the factories of Wikov in Prost\u011bjov and Tatra in Kop\u0159ivnice produced many automobiles.\nMoravia is also the centre of the Czech firearm industry, as the vast majority of Czech firearms manufacturers (e.g. CZUB, Zbrojovka Brno, Czech Small Arms, Czech Weapons, ZVI, Great Gun) are found in Moravia. Almost all the well-known Czech sporting, self-defence, military, and hunting firearms are made in Moravia. Meopta rifle scopes are of Moravian origin. The original Bren gun was conceived here, as were the assault rifles the CZ-805 BREN and Sa vz. 58, and the handguns CZ 75 and ZVI Kevin (also known as the \"Micro Desert Eagle\").\nThe Zl\u00edn Region hosts several aircraft manufacturers, namely Let Kunovice (also known as Aircraft Industries, a.s.), ZLIN AIRCRAFT a.s. Otrokovice (formerly known under the name Moravan Otrokovice), Evektor-Aerotechnik, and Czech Sport Aircraft. Sport aircraft are also manufactured in Jihlava by Jihlavan Airplanes/Skyleader.\nAircraft production in the region started in the 1930s; after a period of low production post-1989, there have been signs of recovery post-2010, and production is expected to grow from 2013 onwards.\nCompanies with operations in Brno include Gen Digital, which maintains one of its headquarters there and continues to use the brand AVG Technologies, as well as Kyndryl (Client Innovation Centre), AT&amp;T, and Honeywell (Global Design Center). Other significant companies include Siemens, Red Hat (Czech headquarters), and an office of Zebra Technologies.\nIn recent years, Brno's economy has seen growth in the quaternary sector, focusing on science, research, and education. Notable projects include AdMaS (Advanced Materials, Structures, and Technologies) and CETOCOEN (Center for Research on Toxic Substances in the Environment).\nMachinery industry.\nThe machinery industry has been the most important industrial sector in the region, especially in South Moravia, for many decades. The main centres of machinery production are Brno (Zbrojovka Brno, Zetor, Prvn\u00ed brn\u011bnsk\u00e1 stroj\u00edrna, Siemens), Blansko (\u010cKD Blansko, Metra), Ku\u0159im (TOS Ku\u0159im), Boskovice (Minerva, Novibra) and B\u0159eclav (Otis Elevator Company). A number of other, smaller machinery and machine parts factories, companies, and workshops are spread over Moravia.\nElectrical industry.\nThe beginnings of the electrical industry in Moravia date back to 1918. The biggest centres of electrical production are Brno (VUES, ZPA Brno, EM Brno), Dr\u00e1sov, Fren\u0161t\u00e1t pod Radho\u0161t\u011bm, and Mohelnice (currently Siemens).\nPeople.\nThe Moravians are generally a Slavic ethnic group who speak various (generally more archaic) dialects of Czech. Before the expulsion of Germans from Moravia the Moravian German minority also referred to themselves as \"Moravians\" (\"M\u00e4hrer\"). Those expelled and their descendants continue to identify as Moravian.\n Some Moravians assert that Moravian is a language distinct from Czech; however, their position is not widely supported by academics and the public. Some Moravians identify as an ethnically distinct group; the majority consider themselves to be ethnically Czech. In the census of 1991 (the first census in history in which respondents were allowed to claim Moravian nationality), 1,362,000 (13.2%) of the Czech population identified as being of Moravian nationality (or ethnicity). In some parts of Moravia (mostly in the centre and south), majority of the population identified as Moravians, rather than Czechs. In the census of 2001, the number of Moravians had decreased to 380,000 (3.7% of the country's population). In the census of 2011, this number rose to 522,474 (4.9% of the Czech population).\nMoravia historically had a large minority of ethnic Germans, some of whom had arrived as early as the 13th century at the behest of the P\u0159emyslid dynasty. Germans continued to come to Moravia in waves, culminating in the 18th century. They lived in the main city centres and in the countryside along the border with Austria (stretching up to Brno) and along the border with Silesia at Jesen\u00edky, and also in two language islands, around Jihlava and around Moravsk\u00e1 T\u0159ebov\u00e1. After World War II, the Czechoslovak government almost fully expelled them in retaliation for their support of Nazi Germany's invasion and dismemberment of Czechoslovakia (1938\u20131939) and subsequent German war crimes (1938\u20131945) towards the Czech, Moravian, and Jewish populations.\nMoravians.\nNotable people from Moravia include:\nEthnographic regions.\nMoravia can be divided on dialectal and lore basis into several ethnographic regions of comparable significance. In this sense, it is more heterogenous than Bohemia. Significant parts of Moravia, usually those formerly inhabited by the German speakers, are dialectally indifferent, as they have been resettled by people from various Czech (and Slovak) regions.\nThe principal cultural regions of Moravia are:\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "20217", "revid": "47988270", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20217", "title": "Murray Rothbard", "text": "American economist (1926\u20131995)\nMurray Newton Rothbard (; March 2, 1926\u00a0\u2013 January 7, 1995) was an American economist of the Austrian School, economic historian, political theorist, and activist. Rothbard was a central figure in the 20th-century American libertarian movement, particularly its right-wing strands, and was a founder and leading theoretician of anarcho-capitalism. He wrote over twenty books on political theory, history, economics, and other subjects.\nRothbard argued that all services provided by the \"monopoly system of the corporate state\" could be provided more efficiently by the private sector and wrote that the state is \"the organization of robbery systematized and writ large\". He called fractional-reserve banking a form of fraud and opposed central banking. He categorically opposed all military, political, and economic interventionism in the affairs of other nations.\nRothbard followed Ludwig von Mises\u2019 praxeology, a deductive method that interprets economic behavior as purposeful human action. Rothbard taught economics at a Wall Street division of New York University, later at Brooklyn Polytechnic, and after 1986 in an endowed position at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas. Partnering with the oil billionaire Charles Koch, Rothbard was a founder of the Cato Institute and the Center for Libertarian Studies in the 1970s. He broke with Cato and Koch, and in 1982 joined Lew Rockwell and Burton Blumert to establish the Mises Institute in Alabama.\nWhile he was a right-libertarian, Rothbard was a critic of Milton Friedman, Ayn Rand, and Adam Smith. Rothbard opposed egalitarianism and the civil rights movement, and blamed women's voting and activism for the growth of the welfare state. Later in his career, Rothbard advocated a libertarian alliance with paleoconservatism (which he called paleolibertarianism), favoring right-wing populism and describing David Duke and Joseph McCarthy as models for political strategy. In the 2010s, he received renewed attention as an influence on the alt-right.\nLife and work.\nEducation.\nRothbard's parents were David and Rae Rothbard, Jewish immigrants to the United States from Poland and Russia, respectively. David was a chemist. Rothbard attended Birch Wathen Lenox School, a private school in New York City. Rothbard later said he much preferred Birch Wathen to the \"debasing and egalitarian public school system\" he had attended in the Bronx.\nRothbard wrote of having grown up as a \"right-winger\" (adherent of the \"Old Right\") among friends and neighbors who were \"communists or fellow-travelers\". He was a member of the New York Young Republican Club in his youth. Rothbard described his father as an individualist who embraced minimal government, free enterprise, private property and \"a determination to rise by one's own merits ... [A]ll socialism seemed to me monstrously coercive and abhorrent.\" In 1952, his father was trapped during a labor strike at the Tide Water Oil Refinery in New Jersey, which he managed, confirming their dislike of organized labor.\nRothbard attended Columbia University, receiving a Bachelor of Arts degree in mathematics in 1945 and a PhD in economics in 1956. His first political activism came in 1948, on behalf of the segregationist South Carolinian Strom Thurmond's presidential campaign. In the 1948 presidential election, Rothbard, \"as a Jewish student at Columbia, horrified his peers by organizing a Students for Strom Thurmond chapter, so staunchly did he believe in states' rights\", according to \"The American Conservative\". The delay in receiving his PhD was due in part to conflict with his advisor, Joseph Dorfman, and in part to Arthur Burns's rejecting his dissertation. Burns was a longtime friend of the Rothbard family and their neighbor at their Manhattan apartment building. It was only after Burns went on leave from the Columbia faculty to head President Eisenhower's Council of Economic Advisers that Rothbard's thesis was accepted, and he received his doctorate. Rothbard later said that all his fellow students were extreme leftists and that he was one of only two Republicans at Columbia at the time.4\nMarriage, Volker Fund, and academia.\nDuring the 1940s, Rothbard vetted articles for Leonard Read at the Foundation for Economic Education think tank, became acquainted with Frank Chodorov, and read widely in libertarian-oriented works by Albert Jay Nock, Garet Garrett, Isabel Paterson, H. L. Mencken, and Austrian School economist Ludwig von Mises.46 Rothbard was greatly influenced by reading Mises's book \"Human Action\" in 1949. In the 1950s, when Mises was teaching in the Wall Street division of the New York University Stern School of Business, Rothbard attended his unofficial seminar. Rothbard wanted to promote libertarian activism; by the mid-1950s, he helped form the Circle Bastiat, a libertarian and anarchist social group in New York City. He also joined the Mont Pelerin Society in the 1950s.\nRothbard attracted the attention of the William Volker Fund, a group that provided financial backing to promote right-wing ideologies in the 1950s and early 1960s. The Volker Fund paid Rothbard to write a textbook to explain \"Human Action\" in a form that could be used to introduce college undergraduates to Mises's views; a sample chapter he wrote on money and credit won Mises's approval. For ten years, the Volker Fund paid him a retainer as a \"senior analyst\".54 As Rothbard continued his work, he enlarged the project. The result was his book \"Man, Economy, and State\", published in 1962. Upon its publication, Mises praised Rothbard's work effusively.14 In contrast to Mises, who considered security the primary justification for the state, Rothbard in the 1950s began to argue for a privatized market for the military, police and judiciary. Rothbard's 1963 book \"America's Great Depression\" blamed government policy failures for the Great Depression, and challenged the widely held view that capitalism is unstable.\nIn 1953, Rothbard married JoAnn Beatrice Schumacher (1928\u20131999), whom he called Joey, in New York City.124 She was a historian, Rothbard's personal editor, and a close adviser as well as hostess of his Rothbard Salon. They enjoyed a loving marriage, and Rothbard often called her \"the indispensable framework\" of his life and achievements. According to her, the Volker Fund's patronage allowed Rothbard to work from home as a freelance theorist and pundit for the first 15 years of their marriage.\nThe Volker Fund collapsed in 1962, leading Rothbard to seek employment at various New York academic institutions. He was offered a part-time position teaching economics to engineering students at Brooklyn Polytechnic Institute in 1966 at age 40. The institution had no economics department or economics majors, and Rothbard derided its social science department as \"Marxist\". Justin Raimondo, his biographer, writes that Rothbard liked teaching at Brooklyn Polytechnic because working only two days a week gave him the freedom to contribute to developments in libertarian politics. Rothbard continued in this role until 1986. Then 60 years old, Rothbard left Brooklyn Polytechnic Institute for the Lee Business School at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas (UNLV), where he held the title of S.J. Hall Distinguished Professor of Economics, a chair endowed by a libertarian businessman.\nAccording to Rothbard's friend, colleague, and fellow Misesian economist Hans-Hermann Hoppe, Rothbard led a \"fringe existence\" in academia, but he was able to attract a large number of \"students and disciples\" through his writings, thereby becoming \"the creator and one of the principal agents of the contemporary libertarian movement\". Libertarian economist Jeffrey Herbener, who called Rothbard his friend and \"intellectual mentor\", said in a memoriam that Rothbard received \"only ostracism\" from mainstream academia. Rothbard kept his position at UNLV from 1986 until his death.\nOld Right.\nThroughout his life, Rothbard engaged in a number of different political movements to promote Old Right and libertarian principles. George Hawley writes that \"unfortunately for Rothbard, the Old Right was ending as an intellectual and political force just as he was maturing as an intellectual\", with the militantly anticommunist conservative movement exemplified by William F. Buckley Jr. supplanting the Old Right's isolationism.\nRothbard was an admirer of Senator Joseph McCarthy\u2014not for McCarthy's Cold War views, but for his demagoguery, which Rothbard credited for disrupting the establishment consensus of what Rothbard called \"corporate liberalism\". Rothbard contributed many articles to Buckley's \"National Review\", but his relations with Buckley and the magazine soured as he criticized the conservative movement for militarism. Specifically, Rothbard opposed how such militarism could justify and expand the state's power.\nRothbard befriended the Holocaust denier Harry Elmer Barnes in 1959. In a 1966 issue of Robert LeFevre's \"Rampart Journal of Individualist Thought\" devoted to historical revisionism, Rothbard argued that Western democracies had been to blame for starting World War I, World War II, and the Cold War. Rothbard published works by Barnes in his journals before and after Barnes died in 1968, including posthumously in the Cato Institute's journal.\nConflict with Ayn Rand.\nIn 1954, Rothbard, along with several other attendees of Mises's seminar, joined the circle of novelist Ayn Rand, the founder of Objectivism. He soon parted from her, writing, among other things, that her ideas were not as original as she proclaimed but similar to those of Aristotle, Thomas Aquinas, and Herbert Spencer. In 1958, after the publication of Rand's novel \"Atlas Shrugged\", Rothbard wrote her a \"fan letter\", calling the book \"an infinite treasure house\" and \"not merely the greatest novel ever written, [but] one of the very greatest books ever written, fiction or nonfiction.\" He also wrote: \"[Y]ou introduced me to the whole field of natural rights and natural law philosophy,\" prompting him to learn \"the glorious natural rights tradition.\" Rothbard rejoined Rand's circle for a few months but soon broke with Rand again over various differences, including his defense of his interpretation of anarchism.\nRothbard later satirized Rand's acolytes in his unpublished one-act farce \"Mozart Was a Red\" and his essay \"The Sociology of the Ayn Rand Cult\".184 He characterized Rand's circle as a \"dogmatic, personality cult\". His play parodies Rand (through the character Carson Sand) and her friends and is set during a visit from Keith Hackley, a fan of Sand's novel \"The Brow of Zeus\" (a play on \"Atlas Shrugged\").\nNew Left outreach.\nBy the late 1960s, according to \"The American Conservative\", Rothbard's \"long and winding yet somehow consistent road had taken him from anti-New Deal and anti-interventionist Robert A. Taft supporter into friendship with the quasi-pacifist Nebraska Republican Congressman Howard Buffett (father of Warren Buffett) then over to the League of (Adlai) Stevensonian Democrats and, by 1968, into tentative comradeship with the anarchist factions of the New Left.\" Rothbard joined the Peace and Freedom Party and contributed writing to the New Left journal \"Ramparts\".\nRothbard later criticized the New Left for supporting a \"People's Republic\"-style Egalitarianism as a Revolt Against Nature and Other Essays . It was during this phase that he associated with Karl Hess (a former Barry Goldwater speechwriter who had rejected conservatism) and founded \"\" with Leonard Liggio and George Resch. Raimondo described Rothbard during this time as \"a man of the Old Culture: he believed that it was possible to be a revolutionary, an anarchist, \"and\" lead a bourgeois life\", and wrote that the \"respectably dressed, if a bit rumpled\" Rothbard was \"immune to the blandishments of sixties youth culture\". During this time, Rothbard proposed that black Americans should embrace racial separatism and secession. He was frustrated that blacks and whites in the New Left instead decided to work together for egalitarian goals. In the 1970s, Rothbard turned sharply against the left and described state-enforced equality as evil.\nLibertarianism and Cato Institute.\nFrom 1969 to 1984, Rothbard edited \"The Libertarian Forum\", also initially with Hess (although Hess's involvement ended in 1971). Despite its small readership, it engaged conservatives associated with the \"National Review\" in nationwide debate. Rothbard rejected the view that Ronald Reagan's 1980 presidential election was a victory for libertarian principles, and he attacked Reagan's economic program in a series of \"Libertarian Forum\" articles. In 1982, Rothbard called Reagan's claims of spending cuts a \"fraud\" and a \"hoax\" and accused Reaganites of doctoring the economic statistics to give a false impression that their policies successfully reduced inflation and unemployment. He further criticized the \"myths of Reaganomics\" in 1987.\nRothbard criticized the \"frenzied nihilism\" of left-wing libertarians but also criticized right-wing libertarians who were content to rely only on education to bring down the state; he believed that libertarians should adopt any moral tactic available to them to bring about liberty. Imbibing Randolph Bourne's idea that \"war is the health of the state\", Rothbard opposed all wars in his lifetime and engaged in anti-war activism.\nDuring the 1970s and 1980s, Rothbard was active in the Libertarian Party. He was frequently involved in the party's internal politics. Rothbard founded the Center for Libertarian Studies in 1976 and the \"Journal of Libertarian Studies\" in 1977. He was one of the founders of the Cato Institute in 1977 (whose funding by Charles Koch was a major infusion of money for libertarianism) and \"came up with the idea of naming this libertarian think tank after \"Cato's Letters\", a powerful series of British newspaper essays by John Trenchard and Thomas Gordon which played a decisive influence upon America's Founding Fathers in fomenting the Revolution\".\nFrom 1978 to 1983, Rothbard was associated with the Libertarian Party Radical Caucus, allying himself with Justin Raimondo, Eric Garris and Williamson Evers. He opposed the \"low-tax liberalism\" espoused by 1980 Libertarian Party presidential candidate Ed Clark and Cato Institute president Edward H Crane III. According to Charles Burris, \"Rothbard and Crane became bitter rivals after disputes emerging from the 1980 LP presidential campaign of Ed Clark carried over to strategic direction and management of Cato\".\nJanek Wasserman wrote, \"The tempestuous tale of the Rothbard-Koch-Cato relationship has been told and retold because of its floridness.\" Rothbard sought to cultivate radical anarcho-capitalists, while Crane and Koch wanted a more reformist approach to influence government and gain political power. Rothbard was removed from Cato's board in 1981. Wasserman described the split as \"the first of many examples of Austrian and libertarian schisms in the United States\".\nMises Institute.\nIn 1982, following his split with the Cato Institute, Rothbard co-founded the Ludwig von Mises Institute in Auburn, Alabama, (with Lew Rockwell and Burton Blumert) and was vice president of academic affairs until 1995. Rothbard also founded the institute's \"Review of Austrian Economics\", a heterodox economics journal later renamed the \"Quarterly Journal of Austrian Economics\", in 1987. Rothbard \"worked closely with Lew Rockwell (joined later by his long-time friend Blumert) in nurturing the Mises Institute and the publication, \"The Rothbard-Rockwell Report\"; which after Rothbard's 1995 death evolved into the website, \"LewRockwell.com\"\", according to the website.\nRothbard and other Mises Institute scholars criticized libertarian groups funded by the Koch brothers, referring to them as the \"Kochtopus\". In contrast to some other libertarian groups, the Mises Institute \"pushed more politically marginal positions like the virtues of secession, the need for a return to the gold standard, and opposition to racial integration\", according to historian Quinn Slobodian. Rothbard split with the Radical Caucus at the 1983 national convention over cultural issues and aligned himself with what he called the \"right-wing populist\" wing of the party, notably Lew Rockwell and Ron Paul, who ran for president on the Libertarian Party ticket in 1988.\nPaleolibertarianism.\nIn 1989, Rothbard left the Libertarian Party and began building bridges to the post-Cold War anti-interventionist right, calling himself a paleolibertarian, a conservative reaction against the cultural liberalism of mainstream libertarianism. Paleolibertarianism sought to appeal to disaffected working-class whites through a synthesis of cultural conservatism and libertarian economics. According to \"Reason\", Rothbard advocated right-wing populism in part because he was frustrated that mainstream thinkers were not adopting the libertarian view and suggested that former Ku Klux Klan Grand Wizard David Duke, as well as Wisconsin Senator Joseph McCarthy, were models for an \"Outreach to the Rednecks\" effort that a broad libertarian/paleoconservative coalition could use. Working together, the coalition would expose the \"unholy alliance of 'corporate liberal' Big Business and media elites, who, through big government, have privileged and caused to rise up a parasitic Underclass\". Rothbard blamed this \"underclass\" for \"looting and oppressing the bulk of the middle and working classes in America\". Regarding Duke's political program, Rothbard asserted that there was \"nothing\" in it that \"could not also be embraced by paleoconservatives or paleolibertarians; lower taxes, dismantling the bureaucracy, slashing the welfare system, attacking affirmative action and racial set-asides, calling for equal rights for all Americans, including whites\". He also praised the \"racialist science\" in Charles Murray's controversial book \"The Bell Curve\".\nRothbard co-founded and became a key figure in the John Randolph Club, which was an alliance between the Mises Institute and the paleoconservative Rockford Institute. He supported the presidential campaign of Pat Buchanan in 1992, writing that \"with Pat Buchanan as our leader, we shall break the clock of social democracy\". When Buchanan dropped out of the Republican primary race, Rothbard then shifted his interest and support to Ross Perot, who Rothbard wrote had \"brought an excitement, a verve, a sense of dynamics and of open possibilities to what had threatened to be a dreary race\". Rothbard eventually withdrew his support from Perot, and endorsed George H. W. Bush in the 1992 election. Like Buchanan, Rothbard opposed the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA); however, he had become disillusioned with Buchanan by 1995, believing that the latter's \"commitment to protectionism was mutating into an all-round faith in economic planning and the nation state\".\nPersonal life.\nJoey Rothbard said in a memoriam that her husband had a happy and bright spirit and that Rothbard, a night owl, \"managed to make a living for 40 years without having to get up before noon. This was important to him.\" She said Rothbard would begin every day with a phone conversation with his colleague Lew Rockwell: \"Gales of laughter would shake the house or apartment, as they checked in with each other. Murray thought it was the best possible way to start a day\".\nRothbard was irreligious and agnostic about God, describing himself as a \"mixture of an agnostic and a Reform Jew\". Despite identifying as an agnostic and an atheist, he was critical of the \"left-libertarian hostility to religion\". In Rothbard's later years, many of his friends anticipated that he would convert to Catholicism, but he never did.\nDeath.\nRothbard died of a heart attack on January 7, 1995, in St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital Center in Manhattan, at the age of 68. \"The New York Times\" obituary called Rothbard \"an economist and social philosopher who fiercely defended individual freedom against government intervention\". Lew Rockwell, president of the Mises Institute, told \"The New York Times\" that Rothbard was \"the founder of right-wing anarchism\". William F. Buckley Jr. wrote a critical obituary in the \"National Review\", criticizing Rothbard's \"defective judgment\" and views on the Cold War. Hoppe, Rockwell, and Rothbard's other colleagues at the Mises Institute took a different view, arguing that he was one of the most important philosophers in history.\nViews.\nAustrian economics.\nRothbard was an advocate and practitioner of the Austrian School tradition of his teacher Ludwig von Mises. Like Mises, Rothbard rejected the application of the scientific method to economics and dismissed econometrics, empirical and statistical analysis, and other tools of mainstream social science as outside the field (economic history might use those tools, but not Economics proper). He instead embraced praxeology, the strictly \"a priori\" methodology of Mises. Praxeology conceives of economic laws as akin to geometric or mathematical axioms: fixed, unchanging, objective, and discernible through logical reasoning.\nAccording to Misesian economist Hans-Hermann Hoppe, eschewing the scientific method and empiricism distinguishes the Misesian approach \"from all other current economic schools\", which dismiss the Misesian approach as \"dogmatic and unscientific.\" Mark Skousen of Chapman University and the Foundation for Economic Education, a critic of mainstream economics, praises Rothbard as brilliant, his writing style persuasive, his economic arguments nuanced and logically rigorous and his Misesian methodology sound. But Skousen concedes that Rothbard was effectively \"outside the discipline\" of mainstream economics and that his work \"fell on deaf ears\" outside his ideological circles. Rothbard wrote extensively on Austrian business cycle theory and, as part of this approach, strongly opposed central banking, fiat money, and fractional-reserve banking, advocating a gold standard and a 100% reserve requirement for banks.\nPolemics against mainstream economics.\nRothbard wrote a series of polemics in which he deprecated a number of leading modern economists. He vilified Adam Smith, calling him a \"shameless plagiarist\" who set economics off track, ultimately leading to the rise of Marxism. Rothbard praised Smith's contemporaries, including Richard Cantillon, Anne Robert Jacques Turgot and \u00c9tienne Bonnot de Condillac, for developing the subjective theory of value. In response to Rothbard's charge that Smith's \"The Wealth of Nations\" was largely plagiarized, David D. Friedman castigated Rothbard's scholarship and character, saying that he \"was [either] deliberately dishonest or never really read the book he was criticizing\". Tony Endres called Rothbard's treatment of Smith a \"travesty\".\nRothbard was equally scathing in his criticism of John Maynard Keynes, calling him weak on economic theory and a shallow political opportunist. Rothbard also wrote more generally that Keynesian-style governmental regulation of money and credit created a \"dismal monetary and banking situation\". He called John Stuart Mill a \"wooly man of mush\" and speculated that Mill's \"soft\" personality led his economic thought astray. Rothbard was critical of monetarist economist Milton Friedman. In his polemic \"Milton Friedman Unraveled\", he called Friedman a \"statist\", a \"favorite of the establishment\", a friend of and an \"apologist\" for Richard Nixon, and a \"pernicious influence\" on public policy. Rothbard said that libertarians should scorn rather than celebrate Friedman's academic prestige and political influence. Noting that Rothbard has \"been nasty to me and my work\", Friedman responded to Rothbard's criticism by calling him a \"cult builder and a dogmatist\".\nIn a memorial volume published by the Mises Institute, Rothbard's prot\u00e9g\u00e9 and libertarian theorist Hans-Hermann Hoppe wrote that \"Man, Economy, and State\" \"presented a blistering refutation of all variants of mathematical economics\" and included it among Rothbard's \"almost mind-boggling achievements\". Hoppe lamented that, like Mises, Rothbard died without winning the Nobel Prize and, while acknowledging that Rothbard and his work were largely ignored by academia, called him an \"intellectual giant\" comparable to Aristotle, John Locke, and Immanuel Kant.\nDisputes with other Austrian economists.\nGeorgetown Professor Randy Barnett says, regarding Rothbard's \"insistence on complete ideological purity\", that \"[a]lmost every intellectual who entered his orbit was eventually spun off, or self-emancipated, for some deviation or another. For this reason, the circle around Rothbard was always small.\" Although he self-identified as an Austrian economist, Rothbard's methodology was at odds with that of many other Austrians. In 1956, Rothbard deprecated the views of Austrian economist Fritz Machlup, stating that Machlup was no praxeologist and calling him instead a \"positivist\" who failed to represent the views of Ludwig von Mises. Rothbard noted that, in fact, Machlup shared the opposing positivist view associated with economist Milton Friedman. Mises and Machlup had been colleagues in 1920s Vienna before each relocated to the United States, and Mises later urged his American protege Israel Kirzner to pursue his PhD studies with Machlup at Johns Hopkins University.\nAccording to libertarian economists Tyler Cowen and Richard Fink, Rothbard wrote that the term \"evenly rotating economy\" (ERE) could be used to analyze complexity in a world of change. Mises introduced ERE as an alternative nomenclature for the mainstream economic method of static equilibrium and general equilibrium analysis. Cowen and Fink found \"serious inconsistencies in both the nature of the ERE and its suggested uses\". With the sole exception of Rothbard, no other economist adopted Mises' term, and the concept continued to be called \"equilibrium analysis\".\nIn a 2011 article critical of Rothbard's \"reflexive opposition\" to inflation, \"The Economist\" noted that his views were increasingly gaining influence among politicians and laypeople on the right. The article contrasted Rothbard's categorical rejection of inflationary policies with the monetary views of \"sophisticated Austrian-school monetary economists such as George Selgin and Lawrence H. White\", [who] follow Hayek in treating stability of nominal spending as a monetary ideal\u2014a position \"not all that different from Mr [Scott] Sumner's\". According to economist Peter Boettke, Rothbard is better described as a property rights economist than as an Austrian economist. In 1988, Boettke noted that Rothbard \"vehemently attacked all of the books of the younger Austrians\".\nEthics.\nAlthough Rothbard adopted Ludwig von Mises' deductive methodology for his social theory and economics, he parted with Mises on the question of ethics. Specifically, he rejected Mises' conviction that ethical values remain subjective and opposed utilitarianism in favor of principle-based, natural law reasoning. In defense of his free-market views, Mises employed utilitarian economic arguments to contend that interventionist policies worsened society. Rothbard countered that interventionist policies do, in fact, benefit some people, including certain government employees and beneficiaries of social programs. Therefore, unlike Mises, Rothbard argued for an objective, natural-law basis for the free market. He called this principle \"self-ownership\", loosely basing the idea on the writings of John Locke and also borrowing concepts from classical liberalism and the anti-imperialism of the Old Right.134\nRothbard accepted the labor theory of property for original appropriation but rejected the Lockean proviso, arguing that if an individual mixes his labor with unowned land, then he becomes the proper owner eternally and that after that time, it is private property which may change hands only by trade or gift. Rothbard was a strong critic of egalitarianism. The title essay of Rothbard's 1974 book \"Egalitarianism as a Revolt Against Nature and Other Essays\" held: \"Equality is not in the natural order of things, and the crusade to make everyone equal in every respect (except before the law) is certain to have disastrous consequences.\" In it, Rothbard wrote: \"At the heart of the egalitarian left is the pathological belief that there is no structure of reality; that all the world is a tabula rasa that can be changed at any moment in any desired direction by the mere exercise of human will.\" Noam Chomsky critiqued Rothbard's ideal society as \"a world so full of hate that no human being would want to live in it... First of all, it couldn't function for a second\u2014and if it could, all you'd want to do is get out, or commit suicide or something.\" The philosopher James. W. Child has even questioned whether Rothbard and other \nsimilar libertarians can sustain a standard of fraud.\nAnarcho-capitalism.\nAccording to anarcho-capitalists, various theorists have espoused legal philosophies similar to anarcho-capitalism; however, Rothbard was credited with coining the terms \"anarcho-capitalist\" and \"anarch-capitalism\" in 1971 (though \"anarchocapitalism [sic]\" had been attested earliest in Karl Hess's 1969 essay \"The Death of Politics\"). He synthesized elements from the Austrian School of economics, classical liberalism and 19th-century American individualist anarchists into a right-wing form of anarchism. According to his prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Hans-Hermann Hoppe, \"[t]here would be no anarcho-capitalist movement to speak of without Rothbard\". Lew Rockwell in a memoriam called Rothbard the \"conscience\" of all the various strains of what he described as \"libertarian anarchism\", and said their advocates had often been personally inspired by his example.\nDuring his years at graduate school in the late 1940s, Rothbard considered whether strict adherence to libertarian and \"laissez-faire\" principles required the abolition of the state altogether. He visited Baldy Harper, a founder of the Foundation for Economic Education, who doubted the need for any government whatsoever. Rothbard said that during this period, he was influenced by 19th-century American individualist anarchists like Lysander Spooner and Benjamin Tucker and the Belgian economist Gustave de Molinari who wrote about how such a system could work. Thus, he \"combined the \"laissez-faire\" economics of Mises with the absolutist views of human rights and rejection of the state\" from individualist anarchists. Edward Stringham opined that: \"In the late 1940s, Murray Rothbard decided that that [sic] private-property anarchism was the logical conclusion of free-market thinking [...].\"\nRothbard began to consider himself a \"private property anarchist\" and published works about private property anarchism in 1954; later, in 1971, he began to use \"anarcho-capitalist\" to describe his political ideology. In his anarcho-capitalist model, the system of private property is upheld by private firms, such as hypothesized protection agencies, which compete in a free market and are voluntarily supported by consumers who choose to use their protective and judicial services. Anarcho-capitalists describe this as \"the end of the state monopoly on force\". In this way, Rothbard differed from Mises, who favored a state to uphold markets.\nIn an unpublished article, Rothbard wrote that economically speaking, individualist anarchism differs from anarcho-capitalism and jokingly pondered whether libertarians should adopt the term nonarchist. Rothbard concluded the article by affirming that he is neither an anarchist nor an \"artist\" but a middle-of-the-roader on the archy question. In \"Man, Economy, and State\", Rothbard divides the various kinds of state intervention into three categories: \"autistic intervention\" (interference with private non-economic activities), \"binary intervention\", (exchange between individuals and the state); and \"triangular intervention\" (state-mandated exchange between individuals). Sanford Ikeda wrote that Rothbard's typology \"eliminates the gaps and inconsistencies that appear in Mises's original formulation\". Rothbard writes in \"Power and Market\" that the role of the economist in a free market is limited, but it is much larger in a government that solicits economic policy recommendations. Rothbard argues that self-interest, therefore, prejudices the views of many economists in favor of increased government intervention.\nRace, gender, and civil rights.\nMichael O'Malley, associate professor of history at George Mason University, describes Rothbard's tone toward the civil rights movement and the women's suffrage movement as \"contemptuous and hostile\". Rothbard criticized women's rights activists, attributing the growth of the welfare state to politically active spinsters \"whose busybody inclinations were not fettered by the responsibilities of home and hearth\". Rothbard argued that varieties of progressivism during the Progressive Era and after, which he regarded as a noxious influence on the United States, was spearheaded by a coalition of Yankee Protestants (people from the six New England states and upstate New York who were Protestants of English descent), Jewish women and \"lesbian spinsters\".\nRothbard, still on the theme of feminism, wrote that \"too many American men live in a matriarchy, dominated first by Momism, then by female teachers, and then by their wives\", and that women were advantaged because they were supported by their husbands. Rothbard's negative view of feminism can also be found in the 1991 article \"The Great Thomas &amp; Hill Show: Stopping The Monstrous Regiment\", where he wrote \"At the risk of alienating my atheist libertarian friends, I think it increasingly clear that conservatives are right: that some religion is going to be dominant in every society. And that if Christianity, for example, is scorned and tossed out, some horrendous form of religion is going to take its place: whether it be Communism, New Age occultism, feminism, or Left-Puritanism. There is no getting around this basic truth of human nature.\"\nRothbard called for the elimination of \"the entire 'civil rights' structure,\" which he said \"tramples on the property rights of every American.\" He consistently favored repeal of the 1964 Civil Rights Act, including Title VII regarding employment discrimination, and called for overturning the \"Brown v. Board of Education\" decision on the grounds that state-mandated integration of schools violated libertarian principles. In an essay called \"Right-wing Populism\", Rothbard proposed a set of measures to \"reach out\" to the \"middle and working classes\", which included urging the police to crack down on \"street criminals\", writing that \"cops must be unleashed\" and \"allowed to administer instant punishment, subject of course to liability when they are in error\". He also advocated that the police \"clear the streets of bums and vagrants.\"\nRothbard held strong opinions about many leaders of the civil rights movement. He considered black separatist Malcolm X to be a \"great black leader\" and integrationist Martin Luther King Jr. to be favored by whites because he \"was the major restraining force on the developing Negro revolution\".167 Jacob Jensen writes that Rothbard's commentary from the 1960s, approving of both \"black power\" and \"white power\" in separated communities, amounted to support for racial segregation. In 1993, Rothbard rejected the vision of a \"separate black nation\", asking, \"Does anyone really believe that ... New Africa would be content to strike out on its own, with no massive \"foreign aid\" from the U.S.A.?\" Rothbard also suggested that opposition to Martin Luther King Jr., whom he demeaned as a \"coercive integrationist\", should be a litmus test for members of his \"paleolibertarian\" political movement.\nRothbard is described by the historian John P. Jackson Jr. as espousing antisemitism despite Rothbard's own background as a secular Jew. One former student described Rothbard as privately using the anti-Jewish slur \"kikes\" repeatedly. Rothbard also befriended the Holocaust deniers Willis Carto and Harry Elmer Barnes.\nViews on war.\nLike Randolph Bourne, Rothbard believed that \"war is the health of the state\". According to David Gordon, this was the reason for Rothbard's opposition to aggressive foreign policy. Rothbard believed that stopping new wars was necessary and that knowing how the government had led citizens into earlier wars was important. Two essays expanded on these views: \"War, Peace, and the State\" and \"Anatomy of the State\". Rothbard used insights from Vilfredo Pareto, Gaetano Mosca, and Robert Michels to build a model of state personnel, goals, and ideology.\nRothbard's colleague Joseph Stromberg notes that Rothbard made two exceptions to his general condemnation of war: \"the American Revolution and the War for Southern Independence, as viewed from the Confederate side\", referring to the American Civil War. Rothbard condemned the \"Northern war against slavery\", saying it was inspired by \"fanatical\" religious faith and characterized by \"a cheerful willingness to uproot institutions, to commit mayhem and mass murder, to plunder and loot and destroy, all in the name of high moral principle\". He celebrated Jefferson Davis, Robert E. Lee, and other prominent Confederates as heroes while denouncing Abraham Lincoln, Ulysses S. Grant, and other Union leaders, who he said had \"opened the Pandora's Box of genocide and the extermination of civilians\". Rothbard saw secession movements as a tool for undermining and disintegrating the state, according to historian Quinn Slobodian, who wrote that \"Rothbard's life was marked by a search for signs of potential secession\" and that \"When he found them, he did his best to deepen them.\"\nHistorical revisionism.\nRothbard embraced \"historical revisionism\" as an antidote to what he perceived to be the dominant influence exerted by corrupt \"court intellectuals\" over mainstream historical narratives. His friend Harry Elmer Barnes, the Holocaust-denying historian, used similar language, \"court historians\". Rothbard wrote that these mainstream intellectuals distorted the historical record in favor of \"the state\" in exchange for \"wealth, power, and prestige\" from the state.15 Rothbard characterized the revisionist task as \"penetrating the fog of lies and deception of the State and its Court Intellectuals, and to present to the public the true history\".\nRothbard worked with antisemitic writers in developing an isolationist revisionist history of World War II. He was influenced by and called a champion of Barnes. Rothbard favorably cited Barnes' view that \"the murder of Germans and Japanese was the overriding aim of World War II\". In an obituary for Barnes, Rothbard wrote: \"Our entry into World War II was the crucial act in foisting a permanent militarization upon the economy and society, in bringing to the country a permanent garrison state, an overweening military\u2013industrial complex, a permanent system of conscription. It was the crucial act in creating a mixed economy run by Big Government, a system of state monopoly capitalism run by the central government in collaboration with Big Business and Big Unionism.\" Besides broadly supporting his historical views, Rothbard promoted Barnes as an influence for future revisionists.\nRothbard's endorsement of World War II revisionism and his association with Barnes and other Holocaust deniers have drawn criticism. Kevin D. Williamson wrote an opinion piece published by \"National Review\" which condemned Rothbard for \"making common cause with the 'revisionist' historians of the Third Reich\", a term he used to describe American Holocaust deniers associated with Rothbard, such as James J. Martin of the Institute for Historical Review. The piece also characterized \"Rothbard and his faction\" as being \"culpably indulgent\" of Holocaust denial, the view which \"specifically denies that the Holocaust actually happened or holds that it was in some way exaggerated\". In an article for Rothbard's 50th birthday, Rothbard's friend and Buffalo State College historian Ralph Raico stated that Rothbard \"is the main reason that revisionism has become a crucial part of the whole libertarian position\".\nMiddle East conflict.\nRothbard's \"The Libertarian Forum\" blamed the Middle East conflict on Israeli aggression \"fueled by American arms and money\". Rothbard warned that the Middle East conflict would draw the United States into a world war. He was anti-Zionist and opposed United States involvement in the Middle East. Rothbard said the Camp David Accords betrayed Palestinian aspirations and opposed Israel's 1982 invasion of Lebanon.\nIn his essay, \"War Guilt in the Middle East\", Rothbard wrote that Israel refused \"to let these refugees return and reclaim the property taken from them,\" and took negative views of a two-state solution for the Israeli\u2013Palestinian conflict. He wrote: \"On the one hand there are the Palestinian Arabs, who have tilled the soil or otherwise used the land of Palestine for centuries; and on the other, there are a group of external fanatics, who come from all over the world, and who claim the entire land area as 'given' to them as a collective religion or tribe at some remote or legendary time in the past. There is no way the two claims can be resolved to the satisfaction of both parties. There can be no genuine settlement, no 'peace' in the face of this irrepressible conflict; there can only be either a war to the death, or an uneasy practical compromise which can satisfy no one.\"\nChildren's rights and parental obligations.\nIn the \"Ethics of Liberty\", Rothbard explores issues regarding children's rights regarding self-ownership and contract. These include support for a woman's right to abortion, condemnation of parents showing aggression towards children and opposition to the state forcing parents to care for children. He also holds children have the right to run away from parents and seek new guardians as soon as they are able to choose to do so. He argued that parents have the right to put a child out for adoption or sell the rights to the child in a voluntary contract in what Rothbard suggests will be a \"flourishing free market in children\". He believes that selling children as consumer goods in accord with market forces\u2014while \"superficially monstrous\"\u2014will benefit \"everyone\" involved in the market: \"the natural parents, the children, and the foster parents purchasing\".\nIn Rothbard's view of parenthood, \"the parent should not have a legal obligation to feed, clothe, or educate his children, since such obligations would entail positive acts coerced upon the parent and depriving the parent of his rights.\" Thus, Rothbard stated that parents should have the legal right to let any infant die by starvation and should be free to engage in other forms of child neglect. However, according to Rothbard, \"the purely free society will have a flourishing free market in children\". In a fully libertarian society, he wrote, \"the existence of a free baby market will bring such 'neglect' down to a minimum\". Economist Gene Callahan of Cardiff University, formerly a scholar at the Rothbard-affiliated Mises Institute, wrote that Rothbard allowed \"the logical elegance of his legal theory\" to \"trump any arguments based on the moral reprehensibility of a parent idly watching her six-month-old child slowly starve to death in its crib\".\nRetributive theory of criminal justice.\nIn \"The Ethics of Liberty\", Rothbard advocates for a \"frankly retributive theory of punishment\" or a system of \"a tooth (or two teeth) for a tooth\". Rothbard emphasizes that all punishment must be proportional, stating that \"the criminal, or invader, loses his rights to the extent that he deprived another man of his\". Applying his retributive theory, Rothbard states that a thief \"must pay double the extent of theft\". Rothbard gives the example of a thief who stole $15,000 and says he must return the stolen money and provide the victim an additional $15,000, money to which the thief has forfeited his right. The thief would be \"put in a [temporary] state of enslavement to his victim\" if he is unable to pay him immediately. Rothbard also applies his theory to justify beating and torturing violent criminals, although the beatings are required to be proportional to the crime.\nTorture of criminal suspects.\nIn chapter twelve of \"Ethics\", Rothbard turns his attention to suspects arrested by the police. He argues that police should be able to torture certain types of criminal suspects, including accused murderers, for information related to their alleged crimes. Writes Rothbard: \"Suppose ... police beat and torture a suspected murderer to find information (not to wring a confession, since obviously a coerced confession could never be considered valid). If the suspect turns out to be guilty, then the police should be exonerated, for then they have only ladled out to the murderer a parcel of what he deserves in return; his rights had already been forfeited by more than that extent. But if the suspect is not convicted, then that means that the police have beaten and tortured an innocent man, and that they in turn must be put into the dock for criminal assault\". Gene Callahan examines this position and concludes that Rothbard rejects the widely held belief that torture is inherently wrong, no matter who the victim. Callahan goes on to state that Rothbard's scheme gives the police a strong motive to frame the suspect after having tortured him or her.\nScience and scientism.\nIn an essay condemning \"scientism in the study of man\", Rothbard rejected the application of causal determinism to human beings, arguing that the actions of human beings\u2014as opposed to those of everything else in nature\u2014are not determined by prior causes, but by \"free will\". He argued that \"determinism as applied to man, is a self-contradictory thesis, since the man who employs it relies implicitly on the existence of free will\". Rothbard opposed what he considered the overspecialization of the academy and sought to fuse the disciplines of economics, history, ethics and political science to create a \"science of liberty\". Rothbard described the moral basis for his anarcho-capitalist position in two of his books: \"For a New Liberty\", published in 1973; and \"The Ethics of Liberty\", published in 1982. In his \"Power and Market\" (1970), Rothbard describes how a stateless economy might function.\n https:// published in Auburn, AL: Ludwig von Mises Institute (2004). . https://\n Republished, Auburn, AL: Ludwig von Mises Institute (2004). .\n 5th ed. published in Auburn, AL: Ludwig von Mises Institute (2005). .\n Republished, Auburn, AL: Ludwig von Mises Institute (2004). .\n Republished in Auburn, AL: Ludwig von Mises Institute (2009). .\n 2nd ed., Auburn, AL: Ludwig von Mises Institute (2000). .\n Republished, Auburn, AL: Ludwig von Mises Institute (2012). .\n Reprinted as \"Economic Controversies\".

With a career spanning over seven decades, he is known as a writer and director of a variety of successful broad farces and parodies. A recipient of numerous accolades, he is one of 27 entertainers to win the EGOT, which includes an Emmy, a Grammy, an Oscar, and a Tony. He received a Kennedy Center Honor in 2009, a Hollywood Walk of Fame star in 2010, the AFI Life Achievement Award in 2013, a British Film Institute Fellowship in 2015, a National Medal of Arts in 2016, a BAFTA Fellowship in 2017, and the Honorary Academy Award in 2024.\nBrooks began his career as a comic and a writer for Sid Caesar's variety show \"Your Show of Shows\" (1950\u20131954). There he worked with Neil Simon, Woody Allen, Larry Gelbart, and Carl Reiner. With Reiner, he co-created the comedy sketch \"The 2000 Year Old Man\" and released several comedy albums, starting with \"2000 Year Old Man\" in 1960. Brooks received five nominations for the Grammy Award for Best Comedy Album finally winning in 1999. With Buck Henry, he created the hit satirical spy NBC television comedy series \"Get Smart\" (1965\u20131970).\nBrooks won the Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay for \"The Producers\" (1967). He then rose to prominence directing a string of successful comedy films such as \"The Twelve Chairs\" (1970), \"Blazing Saddles\" (1974), \"Young Frankenstein\" (1974), \"Silent Movie\" (1976), and \"High Anxiety\" (1977). Later Brooks made \"History of the World, Part I\" (1981), \"Spaceballs\" (1987), \"Life Stinks\" (1991), ' (1993), and ' (1995). A musical adaptation of his first film, \"The Producers\", ran on Broadway from 2001 to 2007 and earned Brooks three Tony Awards. The project was remade into a musical film in 2005. He wrote and produced the Hulu series \"History of the World, Part II\" (2023).\nBrooks was married to actress Anne Bancroft from 1964 until her death in 2005. Their son Max Brooks is an actor and author, known for his novel \"\" (2006). In 2021, Mel Brooks published his memoir titled \"All About Me!\". Three of his films are included on the American Film Institute's list of the top 100 comedy films of the past 100 years (1900\u20132000), all of which were ranked in the top 15: \"Blazing Saddles\" at number 6, \"The Producers\" at number 11, and \"Young Frankenstein\" at number 13.\nEarly life and education.\nBrooks was born Melvin James Kaminsky ()&lt;ref name=\"independent.co.uk/a6759956\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; on a tenement kitchen table on June 28, 1926, in 515 Powell Street in Brownsville, Brooklyn. to Katie (n\u00e9e\u00a0Brookman; ) and Max Kaminsky (), He grew up in Williamsburg on 365 South 3rd Street. His father's family were German Jews from Danzig (present-day Gda\u0144sk, Poland). His mother was a Ukrainian Jewish immigrant from Kyiv, in the Pale of Settlement of the Russian Empire (present-day Ukraine). His parents married in 1916. He had three older brothers: Irving, Lenny, and Bernie. His father died of tuberculosis of the kidney at 34 when Brooks was two years old. He has said of his father's death, \"There's an outrage there. I may be angry at God, or at the world, for that. And I'm sure a lot of my comedy is based on anger and hostility. Growing up in Williamsburg, I learned to clothe it in comedy to spare myself problems\u2014like a punch in the face.\"\nBrooks was a small, sickly boy who often was bullied and teased by his classmates because of his size.&lt;ref name=\"brookslyn/Adelina1980/Brooks\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; At age nine, he saw \"Anything Goes\" with William Gaxton, Ethel Merman and Victor Moore at the Alvin Theater.&lt;ref name=\"cnn/mel-brooks-qa\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; After the show, he told his uncle that he was not going to work in the garment district like everyone else but instead wanted to go into show business.\nWhen Brooks was 14 he gained employment as a pool-side tummler (entertainer) at the Butler Lodge, a second-rate Borscht Belt hotel, where he met 18-year-old Sid Caesar. Brooks kept his guests amused with his crazy antics. In a \"Playboy\" interview, he explained that one day he stood at the edge of a diving board wearing a derby and a large alpaca overcoat with two suitcases full of rocks, and then announced: \"Business is terrible! I can't go on!\" before jumping, fully clothed into the pool.&lt;ref name=\"nydailynews/brooks-book-20190331\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;\nHe was taught by Buddy Rich, who had also grown up in Williamsburg, how to play the drums, and started to earn money as a musician when he was 14. During his time as a drummer, he was given his first opportunity as a comedian at the age of 16, filling in for an ill MC. During his teens, he changed his name to Melvin Brooks,&lt;ref name=\"theguardian/2021/dec/04/mel-brooks\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; influenced by his mother's maiden name Brookman, after being confused with trumpeter Max Kaminsky. Brooks graduated from Eastern District High School in Williamsburg in January 1944&lt;ref name=\"americanfilm/2013/6/cover\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; and intended to follow his older brother and enroll in Brooklyn College to study psychology.\n1944\u20131946: World War II service.\nIn early 1944, in his senior year in high school, Brooks was recruited to take the Army General Classification Test, a Stanford\u2013Binet-type IQ test.&lt;ref name=\"historynet/mel-brooks\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; He received high scores and was sent to the Army Specialized Training Program at the Virginia Military Institute to be taught electrical engineering, horse riding, and saber fighting.&lt;ref name=\"defense.gov/2882521\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In 1944, Brooks was drafted into the Army. Twelve weeks later, when he turned 18, he officially joined the United States Army at the Fort Dix, New Jersey, induction center, and was sent to the Field Artillery Replacement Training Center at Fort Sill, Oklahoma for basic training and radio operator training.\nBrooks was then sent back to Fort Dix for overseas assignment. Brooks says he boarded at the Brooklyn Navy Yard around February 15, 1945. A reporter for the United States Department of Defense writes that Brooks arrived in France in November 1944, and later in Belgium, serving with the 78th\u00a0Infantry Division as a forward artillery observer. In December 1944, a short while later, Brooks was transferred to the 1104th\u00a0Engineer Combat Battalion as a combat engineer, participating in the Battle of the Bulge. Of his experience there, Brooks noted: Along the roadside, you'd see bodies wrapped up in mattress covers and stacked in a ditch, and those would be Americans, that could be me. I sang all the time ... I never wanted to think about it ... Death is the enemy of everyone, and even though you hate Nazis, death is more of an enemy than a German soldier.&lt;ref name=\"Variety/Christon/Producers\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; \nStationed in Saarbr\u00fccken and Baumholder, the battalion was responsible for clearing booby-trapped buildings and defusing land mines as the Allies advanced into Nazi Germany. Brooks was tasked with land mine location; defusing was done by a specialist. Brooks has stated that when he heard Germans singing over loudspeakers, he responded by singing American-Jewish singer Al Jolson's hit \"Toot, Toot, Tootsie (Goo' Bye!)\" into a bullhorn.&lt;ref name=\"military.com/veteran-brooks\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Brooks spent time in the stockade after taking an anti-Semitic heckler's helmet off and smashing him in the head with his mess kit.&lt;ref name=\"cbsnews/brooks-anti-semitism\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; His unit constructed the first Bailey bridge over the Roer River, later building bridges over the Rhine river. In April 1945, Brooks's unit conducted its last reconnaissance missions in the Harz mountains, Germany.\nWith the end of the war in Europe, Brooks joined the Special Services as a comic touring Army bases and he was made acting corporal, put in charge of entertainment at Wiesbaden, and performed at Fort Dix.&lt;ref name=\"1975/brooks-playboy\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In June 1946, Brooks was honorably discharged from the Army as a corporal.\nCareer.\n1949\u20131959: Early work and breakthrough.\nAfter the war, Brooks's mother had secured him a job as a clerk at the Brooklyn Navy Yard, but Brooks \"got into a taxi and ordered the driver to take him to the Catskills\", where he started working in various Borscht Belt resorts and nightclubs in the Catskill Mountains as a drummer and pianist. When a regular comic at one of the clubs was too sick to perform, Brooks started working as a stand-up comic, telling jokes and doing movie-star impressions. He also began acting in summer stock in Red Bank, New Jersey, and did some radio work. He eventually worked his way up to the comically aggressive job of tummler at Grossinger's, one of the Borscht Belt's most famous resorts.\nIn the years after the war, Brooks's hero was comedian Sid Caesar. Back in New York, Brooks would slink&lt;ref name=\"thecjn.ca/brooks\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; around trying to catch Caesar in between meetings to pitch him joke ideas. Eventually Caesar cracked and paid Brooks a little cash to throw him gags...At 24, Brooks got his break as a full-time writer.\nBrooks found more rewarding work behind the scenes, becoming a comedy writer for television. In 1949, his friend Sid Caesar hired him to write jokes for the DuMont/NBC series \"The Admiral Broadway Revue\", paying him, off-the-books, $50 a week. In 1950, Caesar created the innovative variety comedy series \"Your Show of Shows\" and hired Brooks as a writer along with Carl Reiner, Neil Simon, Danny Simon, and head writer Mel Tolkin. The writing staff proved widely influential. Reiner, as creator of \"The Dick Van Dyke Show\", based Morey Amsterdam's character Buddy Sorell on Brooks. Likewise, the film \"My Favorite Year\" (1982) is loosely based on Brooks's experiences as a writer on the show including an encounter with the actor Errol Flynn. Neil Simon's play \"Laughter on the 23rd Floor\" (1993) is also loosely based on the production of the show, and the character Ira Stone is based on Brooks. \"Your Show of Shows\" ended in 1954 when performer Imogene Coca left to host her own show.\nCaesar then created \"Caesar's Hour\" with most of the same cast and writers, including Brooks and adding Woody Allen and Larry Gelbart. It ran from 1954 until 1957. Brooks told \"The New York Times\", \"When I was a fledgling comedy writer working for Sid Caesar on \"Your Show of Shows\", our head writer was Mel Tolkin... I really looked up to him. (By the way, I was 5-foot-7 and he was six feet tall.) He was a bona fide intellectual, thoroughly steeped in the traditions of great Russian literature. One day he handed me a book. He said to me, 'Mel, you're an animal from Brooklyn, but I think you have the beginnings of something called a mind.' The book was \"Dead Souls\" by the magnificent genius Nikolai Gogol. It was a revelation. I'd never read anything like it. It was hysterically funny and incredibly moving at the same time... It was a life-changing gift, and I still read it once a year to remind myself of what great comic writing can be.\"\n1958\u20131969: Rise to prominence.\nBrooks and co-writer Reiner had become close friends and began to casually improvise comedy routines when they were not working. In October 1959, for a Random House book launch of Moss Hart's autobiography, \"Act One\", at \"Mamma Leone's\", Mel Tolkin (standing in for Carl Reiner) and Mel Brooks performed, and it was later recalled by Kenneth Tynan.&lt;ref name=\"newyorker/1978/10/30/mel-brooks\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Reiner played the straight-man interviewer and set Brooks up as anything from a Tibetan monk to an astronaut. As Reiner explained: \"In the evening, we'd go to a party and I'd pick a character for him to play. I never told him what it was going to be.\"\nOn one of these occasions, Reiner's suggestion concerned a 2000-year-old man who had witnessed the crucifixion of Jesus Christ (who \"came in the store but never bought anything\"), had been married several hundred times and had \"over forty-two thousand children, and not one comes to visit me\". At first Brooks and Reiner only performed the routine for friends but, by the late 1950s, it gained a reputation in New York City. Kenneth Tynan saw the comedy duo perform at a party in 1959 and wrote that Brooks \"was the most original comic improvisor I had ever seen\".\nIn 1960, Brooks, without his family, moved from New York to Hollywood, returning in 1961. He and Reiner began performing the \"2000 Year Old Man\" act on \"The Steve Allen Show\". Their performances led to the release of the comedy album \"2000 Years with Carl Reiner and Mel Brooks\" that sold over a million copies in 1961. They eventually expanded their routine with two more albums in 1961 and 1962, a revival in 1973, a 1975 animated TV special, and a reunion album in 1998.\nAt one point, when Brooks had financial and career struggles, the record sales from the 2000 Year Old Man were his chief source of income. Brooks adapted the 2000 Year Old Man character to create the 2500-Year-Old Brewmaster for Ballantine Beer in the 1960s. Interviewed by Dick Cavett in a series of ads, the Brewmaster (in a German accent, as opposed to the 2000 Year Old Man's Yiddish accent) said he was inside the original Trojan horse and \"could've used a six-pack of fresh air\".&lt;ref name=\"1966/brooks-playboy\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;\nBrooks was involved in the creation of the Broadway musical \"All American\" which debuted on Broadway in 1962. He wrote the play with lyrics by Lee Adams and music by Charles Strouse. It starred Ray Bolger as a southern science professor at a large university who uses the principles of engineering on the college's football team and the team begins to win games. It was directed by Joshua Logan, who script-doctored the second act and added a gay subtext to the plot. It ran for 80 performances and received two Tony Award nominations. The animated short film \"The Critic\" (1963), a satire of Norman McLaren's abstract animation, was conceived by Brooks and directed by Ernest Pintoff. Brooks supplied running commentary as the baffled moviegoer trying to make sense of the obscure visuals. It won the Academy Award for Animated Short Film.\nWith comedy writer Buck Henry, Brooks created a TV comedy show titled \"Get Smart,\" about a bumbling James Bond\u2013inspired spy. Brooks said, \"I was sick of looking at all those nice sensible situation comedies. They were such distortions of life... I wanted to do a crazy, unreal comic-strip kind of thing about something besides a family. No one had ever done a show about an idiot before. I decided to be the first.\" Starring Don Adams as Maxwell Smart, Agent 86, the series ran from 1965 until 1970, although Brooks had little involvement after the first season. It was highly rated for most of its production and won seven Primetime Emmy Awards, including Outstanding Comedy Series in 1968 and 1969.\nDuring a press conference for \"All American\", a reporter asked, \"What are you going to do next?\" and Brooks replied, \"Springtime for Hitler,\" perhaps riffing on \"Springtime for Henry\". For several years, Brooks toyed with a bizarre and unconventional idea about a musical comedy of Adolf Hitler. He explored the idea as a novel and a play before finally writing a script. He eventually found two producers to fund it, Joseph E. Levine and Sidney Glazier, and made his first feature film, \"The Producers\" (1968).\n\"The Producers\" was so brazen in its satire that major studios would not touch it, nor would many exhibitors. Brooks finally found an independent distributor who released it as an art film, a specialized attraction. At the 41st Academy Awards, Brooks won the Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay for the film over fellow writers Stanley Kubrick and John Cassavetes. \"The Producers\" became a smash underground hit, first on the nationwide college circuit, then in revivals and on home video. It premiered to a limited audience in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania on November 22, 1967, before achieving a wide release in 1968.\nPeter Sellers personally championed the film, paying out of pocket to take out full-page ads in \"Variety\" and \"The New York Times\". Brooks, along with his collaborator Thomas Meehan, later adapted it into a musical, which was hugely successful on Broadway and received an unprecedented 12 Tony awards. In 2000, Roger Ebert included \"The Producers\" in his canon of Great Movies, and remembered being in an elevator with Brooks and Anne Bancroft shortly after the movie was released: \"A woman got on the elevator, recognized him and said, 'I have to tell you, Mr. Brooks, that your movie is vulgar.' Brooks smiled benevolently. 'Lady', he said, 'it rose below vulgarity.'\"\n1970\u20131979: Career stardom.\nWith the moderate financial success of the film \"The Producers\", Glazier financed Brooks's next film, \"The Twelve Chairs\" (1970). Loosely based on Ilf and Petrov's 1928 Russian novel of the same name about greedy materialism in post-revolutionary Russia, it stars Ron Moody, Frank Langella, and Dom DeLuise as three men individually searching for a fortune in diamonds hidden in a set of 12 antique chairs. Brooks makes a cameo appearance as an alcoholic ex-serf who \"yearns for the regular beatings of yesteryear\". The film was shot in Yugoslavia with a budget of $1.5 million. It received poor reviews and was not financially successful.\nBrooks then wrote an adaptation of Oliver Goldsmith's \"She Stoops to Conquer\", but was unable to sell the idea to any studio and believed that his career was over. In 1972, he met agent David Begelman, who helped him set up a deal with Warner Bros. to hire Brooks (as well as Richard Pryor, Andrew Bergman, Norman Steinberg, and Alan Uger) as a script doctor for an unproduced script called \"Tex-X\". Eventually, Brooks was hired as director for what became \"Blazing Saddles\" (1974), his third film.\n\"Blazing Saddles\" starred Cleavon Little, Gene Wilder, Harvey Korman, Slim Pickens, Madeline Kahn, Alex Karras, and Brooks himself, with cameos by Dom DeLuise and Count Basie. It had music by Brooks and John Morris, and a modest budget of $2.6 million. A satire on the Western film genre, it references older films such as \"Destry Rides Again\" (1939), \"The Treasure of the Sierra Madre\" (1948), \"High Noon\" (1952) and \"Once Upon a Time in the West\" (1968). In a surreal sequence towards the end, it references the extravagant musicals of Busby Berkeley.\nDespite mixed reviews, \"Blazing Saddles\" was a success with younger audiences. It became the second-highest US grossing film of 1974, grossing $119.5 million in the United States and Canada. It was nominated for three Academy Awards: Best Supporting Actress (for Madeline Kahn), Best Film Editing, and Best Original Song. It won the Writers Guild of America Award for Best Comedy \u2013 Written Directly for the Screen. In 2006, it was deemed \"culturally, historically or aesthetically significant\" by the Library of Congress and selected for preservation in the National Film Registry. Brooks has said that the film \"has to do with love more than anything else. I mean when that black guy rides into that Old Western town and even a little old lady says 'Up yours, nigger!', you know that his heart is broken. So it's really the story of that heart being mended.\" Brooks described the film as \"a Jewish western with a black hero\".\nWhen Gene Wilder replaced Gig Young as the Waco Kid, he did so only when Brooks agreed that his next film would be a script&lt;ref name=\"vulture/funny-man-highlights\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; that Wilder had been working on: a spoof of the Universal series of \"Frankenstein\" films from several decades earlier. After the filming of \"Blazing Saddles\" was completed, Wilder and Brooks began writing the script for \"Young Frankenstein\" and shot it in the spring of 1974. It starred Wilder, Marty Feldman, Peter Boyle, Teri Garr, Madeline Kahn, Cloris Leachman and Kenneth Mars, with Gene Hackman in a cameo role. Brooks's voice can be heard three times: as the wolf howl when the characters are on their way to the castle; as the voice of Victor Frankenstein, when the characters discover the laboratory; and as the sound of a cat when Gene Wilder accidentally throws a dart out of the window in a scene with Kenneth Mars. Composer John Morris again provided the score, and Universal monsters special effects veteran Kenneth Strickfaden worked on the film.\n\"Young Frankenstein\" was the third-highest-grossing film domestically of 1974, just behind \"Blazing Saddles\" with a gross of $86 million. It also received two Academy Award nominations for Best Adapted Screenplay and Best Sound. It received some of the best reviews of Brooks's career. Even notoriously hard-to-please critic Pauline Kael liked it, saying: \"Brooks makes a leap up as a director because, although the comedy doesn't build, he carries the story through\u00a0... [He] even has a satisfying windup, which makes this just about the only comedy of recent years that doesn't collapse.\" In 1975, at the height of his movie career, Brooks tried TV again with \"When Things Were Rotten\", a Robin Hood parody that lasted only 13 episodes. Nearly 20 years later, in response to the 1991 hit film ', Brooks mounted another Robin Hood parody, ' (1993). It resurrected several pieces of dialogue from his TV series, and from earlier Brooks films.\nAfter his two hit films Brooks got a call from Ron Clark who had an audacious idea: the first feature-length silent comedy in four decades. \"Silent Movie\" (1976) was written by Brooks and Clark, and starred Brooks in his first leading role, with Dom DeLuise, Marty Feldman, Sid Caesar, Bernadette Peters, and in cameo roles playing themselves: Paul Newman, Burt Reynolds, James Caan, Liza Minnelli, Anne Bancroft, and the mime Marcel Marceau, who uttered the film's only word of audible dialogue: \"Non!\" It is an homage to silent comedians Charlie Chaplin and Buster Keaton, among others. It was not as successful as Brooks's previous two films but did gross $36 million. Later that year, he was named fifth on the Top Ten Money Making Stars Poll. Reviews were generally favorable; Roger Ebert praised it as \"not only funny, but fun. It's clear at almost every moment that the filmmakers had a ball making it.\" Regarding the film's inside jokes, Ebert wrote that \"the thing about Brooks's inside jokes is that their outsides are funny, too.\"\n\"High Anxiety\" (1977), Brooks's parody of Freudian psychoanalysis, as well as the films of Alfred Hitchcock, was written by Brooks, Ron Clark, Rudy De Luca, and Barry Levinson, and was the first movie Brooks produced himself. Starring Brooks, Madeline Kahn, Cloris Leachman, Harvey Korman, Ron Carey, Howard Morris, and Dick Van Patten, it satirizes such Hitchcock films as \"Vertigo\", \"Spellbound\", \"Psycho\", \"The Birds\", \"North by Northwest\", \"Dial M for Murder\" and \"Suspicion\". Brooks plays Professor Richard H. (Harpo) Thorndyke, a Nobel Prize\u2013winning psychologist who suffers from \"high anxiety\".\n1980\u20132001: Established career.\nBy 1980, Gene Siskel and Roger Ebert had referred to Mel Brooks and Woody Allen as \"the two most successful comedy directors in the world today\u00a0... America's two funniest filmmakers\". Released that year was the dramatic film \"The Elephant Man\" directed by David Lynch and produced by Brooks. Knowing that anyone seeing a poster reading \"Mel Brooks presents \"The Elephant Man\"\" would expect a comedy, he set up the company Brooksfilms. It has since produced a number of non-comedy films, including \"Frances\" (1982), \"The Fly\" (1986), and \"84 Charing Cross Road\" (1987) starring Anthony Hopkins and Anne Bancroft\u2014as well as comedies, including Richard Benjamin's \"My Favorite Year\" (1982), partially based on Mel Brooks's real life. Brooks sought to purchase the rights to \"84 Charing Cross Road\" for his wife, Anne Bancroft, for many years. He also produced the comedy \"Fatso\" (1980) that Bancroft directed.\nIn 1981, Brooks joked that the only genres that he hadn't spoofed were historical epics and Biblical spectacles. \"History of the World Part I\" was a tongue-in-cheek look at human culture from the Dawn of Man to the French Revolution. Written, produced and directed by Brooks, with narration by Orson Welles, it was another modest financial hit, earning $31 million. It received mixed critical reviews. Critic Pauline Kael, who for years had been critical of Brooks, said, \"Either you get stuck thinking about the bad taste or you let yourself laugh at the obscenity in the humor as you do Bu\u00f1uel's perverse dirty jokes.\"\nBrooks produced and starred in (but did not write or direct) a remake of Ernst Lubitsch's 1942 film \"To Be or Not to Be\". His 1983 version was directed by Alan Johnson and starred Brooks, Anne Bancroft, Charles Durning, Tim Matheson, Jose Ferrer and Christopher Lloyd. It generated international publicity by featuring a controversial song on its soundtrack\u2014\"To Be or Not to Be (The Hitler Rap)\"\u2014satirizing German society in the 1940s, with Brooks playing Hitler.\nThe second movie Brooks directed in the 1980s was \"Spaceballs\" (1987), a parody of science fiction, mainly \"Star Wars\". It starred Bill Pullman, John Candy, Rick Moranis, Daphne Zuniga, Dick Van Patten, Joan Rivers, Dom DeLuise, and Brooks.\nIn 1989, Brooks (with co-executive producer Alan Spencer) made another attempt at television success with the sitcom \"The Nutt House\", featuring Brooks regulars Harvey Korman and Cloris Leachman. It was originally broadcast on NBC, but the network aired only five of the eleven produced episodes before canceling the series. During the next decade, Brooks directed \"Life Stinks\" (1991), ' (1993), and ' (1995). \"People\" magazine wrote, \"Anyone in a mood for a hearty laugh couldn't do better than \"Robin Hood: Men in Tights\", which gave fans a parody of Robin Hood, especially \"\".\" Like Brooks's other films, it is filled with one-liners and the occasional breaking of the fourth wall. \"Robin Hood: Men in Tights\" was Brooks's second time exploring the life of Robin Hood (the first, as mentioned above, being his 1975 TV show \"When Things Were Rotten\"). \"Life Stinks\" was a financial and critical failure, but is notable as the only film Brooks directed that is neither a parody nor a film about other films or theater. (\"The Twelve Chairs\" was a parody of the original novel.)\n2001\u2013present.\nBrooks created the musical adaptation of his film \"The Producers\" on the Broadway in 2001. The production starring Nathan Lane and Matthew Broderick received critical acclaim and was a significant box office success. \"The New York Times\" theatre critic Ben Brantley praised the production writing, \"Mr. Brooks has taken what could have been overblown camp into a far warmer realm in which affection always outweighs irony.\" The production broke the Tony Award record with 12 wins, a record previously held for 37 years by \"Hello, Dolly!\" with 10 wins including the Tony Award for Best Musical. It led to a 2005 big-screen version of the Broadway adaptation/remake with Lane, Broderick, Gary Beach, and Roger Bart reprising their stage roles, and new cast members Uma Thurman and Will Ferrell.\nIn early April 2006, Brooks began composing the score to a Broadway musical adaptation of \"Young Frankenstein\", which he says is \"perhaps the best movie [he] ever made\". The world premiere was at Seattle's Paramount Theater, between August 7, 2007, and September 1, 2007, after which it opened on Broadway at the former Lyric Theater (then the Hilton Theatre), New York, on October 11, 2007. It earned mixed reviews from the critics. In the 2000s, Brooks worked on an animated series sequel to \"Spaceballs\" called \"\", which premiered on September 21, 2008, on G4 TV.\nBrooks has voiced vocal roles for animation. He voiced Bigweld, the master inventor, in the animated film \"Robots\" (2005), and in the later animated film \"Mr. Peabody &amp; Sherman\" (2014) he had a cameo appearance as Albert Einstein. He voiced Dracula's father, Vlad, in \"Hotel Transylvania 2\" (2015) and \"\" (2018). Brooks joked about the concept of a musical adaptation of \"Blazing Saddles\" in the final number in \"Young Frankenstein\", in which the full company sings, \"next year, \"Blazing Saddles\"!\" In 2010, Brooks confirmed this, saying that the musical could be finished within a year; however, no creative team or plan has been announced.\nIn 2021, at age 95, Brooks published a memoir titled \"All About Me!\". On October 18, 2021, it was announced that Brooks would write and produce \"History of the World, Part II\", a follow-up TV series on Hulu to his 1981 movie. He received a nomination for Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Character Voice-Over Performance for his role as the narrator in the series.\nIn June 2025, Brooks announced \"Spaceballs 2\" was being produced with a release date targeted for 2027. The same month, it was announced that Brooks would be executive-producing \"Very Young Frankenstein\", a television project, for FX.\nActing credits and accolades.\nBrooks is one of the few people who have received an Oscar, an Emmy, a Tony, and a Grammy. He won his first Grammy for Best Spoken Comedy Album in 1999 for his recording of \"The 2000 Year Old Man in the Year 2000\" with Carl Reiner. His two other Grammys came in 2002 for Best Musical Show Album for the cast album of \"The Producers\" and for Best Long Form Music Video for the DVD \"Recording the Producers: A Musical Romp with Mel Brooks\".\nHe won his first of four Emmy awards in 1967 for Outstanding Writing Achievement in Variety for a Sid Caesar special, and won Emmys in 1997, 1998, and 1999 for Outstanding Guest Actor in a Comedy Series for his role of Uncle Phil on \"Mad About You\". He won his Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay (Oscar) in 1968 for \"The Producers\". He won his three Tony awards in 2001 for his work on the musical \"The Producers\", for Best Musical, Best Original Musical Score, and Best Book of a Musical.\nBrooks also won a Hugo Award and Nebula Award for \"Young Frankenstein\". In a 2005 poll by Channel 4 to find \"The Comedian's Comedian\", he was voted No. 50 of the top 50 comedy acts ever by fellow comedians and comedy insiders. The American Film Institute (AFI) lists three of Brooks's films on its AFI's 100 Years...100 Laughs list: \"Blazing Saddles\" (#6), \"The Producers\" (#11), and \"Young Frankenstein\" (#13).\nIn December 2009, Brooks was one of five recipients of the 2009 Kennedy Center Honors at the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington, DC. He was inducted into the Hollywood Walk of Fame in April 2010, with a motion pictures star located at 6712 Hollywood Boulevard. American Masters produced a biography on Brooks which premiered in May 2013, on PBS.\nThe AFI presented Brooks with its highest tribute, the AFI Life Achievement Award, in June 2013.&lt;ref name=\"youtube/AFI/Brooks\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014 Brooks was honored in a handprint and footprint ceremony at TCL Chinese Theatre. His concrete handprints include a six-fingered left hand as he wore a prosthetic finger when making his prints. In March 2015, he received a British Film Institute Fellowship from the British Film Institute.\nPersonal life.\nMarriages and family.\nBrooks met Florence Baum, a dancer in \"Gentlemen Prefer Blondes\", on Broadway.&lt;ref name=\"actorsequity/News/2011-01\"&gt;\n&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=\"ibdb/98609\"&gt;\n&lt;/ref&gt; They were married from 1953 until their divorce in 1962. They had three children. After earning a salary of $5,000 a week on \"Your Show of Shows\" and \"Caesar's Hour\", his salary dropped to $85 a week as a freelance writer. For five years he had few gigs, and was living in Greenwich Village on Perry Street in a fourth-floor walk-up.&lt;ref name=\"vanityfair/making-producers\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In 1960, to escape his situation, Brooks moved in with a friend, in Los Angeles.&lt;ref name=\"grunge/363048\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In 1961, after his return to New York, he found that Baum had begun suing him for legal separation. \"Marriage Is a Dirty Rotten Fraud\"&lt;ref name=\"archives.nypl/22177#c1030225\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; was an autobiographical script based on his marriage. By 1966, Brooks was \"living in a fairly old but comfortable New York town house\".\nBrooks married actress Anne Bancroft in 1964, and they remained together for 41 years until her death in 2005. They met at a rehearsal for the \"Perry Como Variety Show\" in 1961, and were married three years later on August 5, 1964, at the Manhattan Marriage Bureau. Their son, Max Brooks, was born in 1972. In 2010, Brooks credited Bancroft as \"the guiding force\" behind his involvement in developing \"The Producers\" and \"Young Frankenstein\" for the musical theater, saying of his first meeting with her: \"From that day, until her death\u00a0... we were glued together.\" He has remained single since she died, stating in 2023 that \"Once you are married to Anne Bancroft, others don't seem to be appealing\".\nAccording to actor David DeLuise on \"Wizards of Waverly Pod\", Brooks is his godfather; DeLuise's father, Dom DeLuise, was a frequent co-star of Brooks in his earlier career.\nInterests.\nBrooks is a voracious reader; in a profile for \"The New Yorker\", Kenneth Tynan describes \"Brooks the secret connoisseur, worshiper of good writing, and expert on the Russian classics, with special reverence to Gogol, Turgenev, Dostoevski, and Tolstoy.\" In \"The Producers\", Bialystock refers to Bloom as \"Prince Myshkin\", a character from Dostoevsky's \"The Idiot\", and the name Leo Bloom is a reference to Leopold Bloom, hero of Joyce's \"Ulysses\".\nReligious beliefs.\nRegarding religion, Brooks stated, \"I'm rather secular. I'm basically Jewish. But I think I'm Jewish not because of the Jewish religion at all. I think it's the relationship with the people and the pride I have. The tribe surviving so many misfortunes, and being so brave and contributing so much knowledge to the world and showing courage\".\nBrooks has consistently expressed pride in his Jewish identity. In 2021, Brooks told NPR's Terry Gross: \"I love being a Jew, I love Jewish humor...\"\nOn Jewish cinema, Brooks said, \"They can be anything and anywhere ... if there's a tribal thing, like, the 'please God, protect us' feeling ... we don't know where and how it's gonna come out. \"Avatar\" was a Jewish movie ... these people on the run, chasing\u2014and being pursued\".\nPolitics.\nBrooks endorsed Joe Biden in the 2020 presidential election in his first-ever public endorsement of a political candidate. He endorsed Kamala Harris in the 2024 presidential election.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nExternal links.\nInterviews"}
{"id": "20219", "revid": "34669967", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20219", "title": "Mycoplasma genitalium", "text": "Species of bacterium\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Taxobox/core/styles.css\" /&gt;\nMycoplasma genitalium (also known as MG\",\" Mgen, or since 2018, Mycoplasmoides genitalium) is a sexually transmitted, small pathogenic bacterium that lives on the mucous epithelial cells of the urinary and genital tracts in humans. Medical journals in 2007 and 2015 reported that Mgen is becoming more common. Resistance to multiple antibiotics, including the macrolide azithromycin, until recently the most reliable treatment, is becoming prevalent. The bacterium was first isolated from the urogenital tract of humans in 1981 and was identified as a new species of \"Mycoplasma\" in 1983. It increases the risk of HIV spread in men and women, with higher occurrences in those previously treated with azithromycin antibiotics.\nSymptoms of infection.\nMgen is a bacterium recognized for causing urethritis in both men and women along with cervicitis and pelvic inflammation in women. It presents clinically similar symptoms to that of \"Chlamydia trachomatis\" infection and has shown higher incidence rates, compared to both \"Chlamydia trachomatis\" and \"Neisseria gonorrhoeae\" infections in some populations.\nInfection with Mgen can be symptomatic or asymptomatic. Both men and women may experience inflammation in the urethra (urethritis), characterized by mucopurulent discharge in the urinary tract, and burning while urinating. In women, it causes cervicitis and pelvic inflammatory diseases (PID), including endometritis and salpingitis. Women may also experience bleeding after sex and it is also linked with tubal factor infertility. For men, the most common signs are painful urination or a watery discharge from the penis.\nThere is a consistent association of \"M. genitalium\" infection and female reproductive tract syndromes. \"M. genitalium\" infection was significantly associated with increased risk of preterm birth, spontaneous abortion, cervicitis, and pelvic inflammatory disease. In addition, this pathogen may latently infect the chorionic villi tissues of pregnant women, thereby impacting pregnancy outcome. Infertility risk is also strongly associated with infection with \"M. genitalium\", although evidence suggests it is not associated with male infertility. When \"M. genitalium\" is a co-infectious agent risk associations are stronger and statistically significant.\nPolymerase chain reaction analyses indicated that it is a cause of acute non-gonococcal urethritis (NGU) and probably chronic NGU. It is strongly associated with persistent and recurring non-gonococcal urethritis (NGU), responsible for 15 percent to 20 percent of symptomatic NGU cases in men. Unlike other mycoplasmas, the infection is not associated with bacterial vaginosis. It is highly associated with the intensity of HIV infection. Some scientists are performing research to determine if Mgen could play a role in the development of prostate and ovarian cancers and lymphomas in some individuals. These studies have yet to find conclusive evidence to suggest a link.\nGenome.\nThe genome of \"M. genitalium\" strain G37T consists in one circular DNA molecule of 580,070 base pairs. Scott N. Peterson and his team at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill reported the first genetic map using pulsed-field gel electrophoresis in 1991. They performed an initial study of the genome using sequencing in 1993, by which they found 100,993 nucleotides and 390 protein-coding genes. Collaborating with researchers at The Institute for Genomic Research (TIGR; now the J. Craig Venter Institute), which included Craig Venter, they completed the genome sequence in 1995 using shotgun sequencing. Only 470 predicted coding regions were identified in 1995, including genes required for DNA replication, transcription and translation, DNA repair, cellular transport, and energy metabolism. It was the second complete bacterial genome ever sequenced, after \"Haemophilus influenzae\". Later data from KEGG reports 476 protein-coding genes and 43 RNA genes, totaling 519. It is unclear where the \"525\" gene count for the G37T stems from and what gene calling procedure was used. The current genome annotation in the Uniprot reference proteome lists 483 proteins.\nGene and protein function annotation.\nIn the original genome sequence, 374 of the 470 predicted proteins had at least a \"putative\" function assigned. 96 genes had no matches to any known proteins in other organisms. In 2025, 30 years after the genome was published, 26 proteins are still annotated (in Uniprot) as \"probable\" (e.g. rbgA/MG442 is probably the ribosome biogenesis GTPase A) and 28 proteins are annotated as \"putative\" (e.g. MG125 is a Putative phosphatase [EC 3.1.3.-]). 146 proteins remain annotated as \"uncharacterized\", with about a dozen having some predicted function. The function of more than 100 proteins thus appears to remain largely mysterious.\nIn 2006, the team at the J. Craig Venter Institute reported that only 382 genes are essential for biological functions. The small genome of \"M. genitalium\" made it the organism of choice in The Minimal Genome Project, a study to find the smallest set of genetic material necessary to sustain life.\nVariation across genomes.\nThere is limited divergence among clinical strains of \"M. genitalium\". All strains retain the small genome size.\nDiagnosis.\nRecent research shows that prevalence of Mgen is currently higher than other commonly occurring sexually transmitted infections (STIs). Mgen is a fastidious organism with prolonged growth durations. This makes detection of the pathogen in clinical specimens and subsequent isolation extremely difficult. Lacking a cell wall, Mycoplasma remains unaffected by commonly used antibiotics. The absence of specific serological assays leaves nucleic acid amplification tests (NAAT) as the only viable option for detection of Mgen DNA or RNA. However, samples with positive NAAT for the pathogen should be tested for macrolide resistance mutations, which are strongly correlated to azithromycin treatment failures, owing to rapid rates of mutation of the pathogen. Mutations in the 23S rRNA gene of Mgen have been linked with clinical treatment failure and high level in vitro macrolide resistance. Macrolide resistance mediating mutations have been observed in 20-50% of cases in the UK, Denmark, Sweden, Australia, and Japan. Resistance is also developing towards the second-line antimicrobials like fluoroquinolone.\nAccording to the European guidelines, the indication for commencement of diagnosis for Mgen infection are:\nScreening for Mgen with a combination of detection and macrolide resistance mutations will provide the adequate information required to develop personalised antimicrobial treatments, in order to optimise patient management and control the spread of antimicrobial resistance (AMR).\nDetection of resistance.\nOwing to the widespread macrolide resistance, samples that are positive for Mgen should ideally be followed up with an assay capable of detecting mutations that mediate antimicrobial resistance. The European Guideline on Mgen infections recommend complementing the molecular detection of Mgen with an assay capable of detecting macrolide resistance-associated mutations. Furthermore, molecular assays for quinolone resistance-associated mutations are available at specialised laboratories in suspected treatment failure due to treatment with moxifloxacin.\nTreatment.\nThe U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends a step-wise treatment approach for \"Mycoplasma genitalium\" with doxycycline for seven days followed immediately by a seven-day course of moxifloxacin as the preferred therapy due to high rates of macrolide resistance. If resistance assay testing is available, and the Mgen is sensitive to macrolides, the CDC recommends a seven-day course of doxycycline followed by a four-day course of azithromycin. Although the majority of \"M. genitalium\" strains are sensitive to moxifloxacin, resistance has been reported, and potential for serious, adverse side effects should be considered with this regimen. Floroquinolones, including moxifloxacin, have been associated with disabling and potentially irreversible serious adverse reactions that have occurred together including:\nand other serious side effects detailed in the FDA black box warning. Moxifloxacin/Avelox should be reserved for use when patients have no other treatment options.\nIn settings without access to resistance testing, or if moxifloxacin cannot be used, the CDC recommends as an alternative regimen: seven days of doxycycline followed by the four-day course of azithromycin, with a test of cure 21 days after treatment being required due to the high rate of macrolide resistance. Beta lactam antibiotics are not effective against Mgen as the organism lacks a cell wall.\nIn the UK the British Association for Sexual Health and HIV (BASHH) guidelines for treatment are:\nTreatment of \"Mycoplasma genitalium\" infections is becoming increasingly difficult due to rapidly growing antimicrobial resistance. Diagnosis and treatment is further hampered by the fact that \"Mycoplasma genitalium\" infections are not routinely tested. Studies have demonstrated that a 5-day course of azithromycin has a superior cure rate compared to a single, larger dose. Further, a single dose of azithromycin can lead to the bacteria becoming resistant to azithromycin. Among Swedish patients, doxycycline was shown to be relatively ineffective (with a cure rate of 48% for women and 38% for men); and treatment with a single dose of azithromycin is not prescribed due to it inducing antimicrobial resistance. The five-day treatment with azithromycin showed no development of antimicrobial resistance. Based on these findings, UK doctors are moving to the 5-day azithromycin regimen. Doxycycline is also still used, and moxifloxacin is used as a second-line treatment in case doxycyline and azithromycin are not able to eradicate the infection.\nIn patients where doxycycline, azithromycin and moxifloxacin all failed, pristinamycin has been shown to still be able to eradicate the infection.\nHistory.\n\"Mycoplasma genitalium\" was originally isolated in 1980 from urethral specimens of two male patients with non-gonococcal urethritis in the genitourinary medicine (GUM) clinic at St Mary's Hospital, Paddington, London. It was reported in 1981 by a team led by Joseph G. Tully. Under electron microscopy, it appears as a flask-shaped cell with a narrow terminal portion that is crucial for its attachment to the host cell surfaces. The bacterial cell is slightly elongated, somewhat like a vase, and measures 0.6\u20130.7 \u03bcm in length, 0.3\u20130.4 \u03bcm at the broadest region, and 0.06\u20130.08 \u03bcm at the tip. The base is broad while the tip is stretched into a narrow neck, which terminates with a cap. The terminal region has a specialised region called nap, which is absent in other mycoplasmas. Serological tests indicated that the bacterium was not related to known species of \"Mycoplasma\". The comparison of genome sequences with other urinogenital bacteria, such as \"M. hominis\" and \"Ureaplasma parvum\", revealed that \"M. genitalium\" is significantly different, especially in the energy-generating pathways, although it shared a core genome of ~250 protein-encoding genes.\nIn 2018, Gupta et al. proposed to change the name of \"Mycoplasma genitalium\" to \"Mycoplasmoides genitalium\" on phylogenetic grounds, reflecting the existing knowledge that \"M. genitalium\" is not very related to other \"Mycoplasma\". The change became correct name under the International Code of Nomenclature of Prokaryotes (ICNP, \"Code\") with Validation List 184, published by the ICSP (\"Committee\"). Mycoplasmaologists working in the field generally oppose this renaming. In 2019, they published an opinion paper arguing that even though the phylogenetic methods are valid, Gupta's renaming scheme causes too many changes, which is impractical and confusing. They cite some essential principles of the Code, such as \"no unnecessary new names\", \"aim at stability of names\", and \"avoid or reject the use of names which may cause error or confusion\". However, the 2019 argument for preserving old names was rejected by the Committee in Opinion 122 of 2022, where it was ruled that the argument incorrectly cited the Code. The Opinion emphasizes that use of an older validly published name remains acceptable under the Code.\nSynthetic genome.\nOn 6 October 2007, Craig Venter announced that a team of scientists led by Nobel laureate Hamilton Smith at the J. Craig Venter Institute had successfully constructed synthetic DNA with which they planned to make the first synthetic genome. Reporting in \"The Guardian\", Venter said that they had stitched together a DNA strand containing 381 genes, consisting of 580,000 base pairs, based on the genome of \"M. genitalium\". On 24 January 2008, they announced the successful creation of a synthetic bacterium, which they named \"Mycoplasma genitalium\" JCVI-1.0 (the name of the strain indicating J. Craig Venter Institute with its specimen number). They synthesised and assembled the complete 582,970-base pair genome of the bacterium. The final stages of synthesis involved cloning the DNA into the bacterium \"E. coli\" for nucleotide production and sequencing. This produced large fragments of approximately 144,000 base pairs or 1/4th of the whole genome. Finally, the products were cloned inside the yeast \"Saccharomyces cerevisiae\" to synthesize the 580,000 base pairs. The molecular size of the synthetic bacterial genome is 360,110 kilodaltons (kDa). Printed in 10-point font, the letters of the genome cover 147 pages.\nOn 20 July 2012, Stanford University and the J. Craig Venter Institute announced successful simulation of the complete life cycle of a \"Mycoplasma genitalium\" cell, in the journal \"Cell\". The entire organism is modeled in terms of its molecular components, integrating all cellular processes into a single model. Using object oriented programming to model the interactions of 28 categories of molecules, including DNA, RNA, proteins, and metabolites, and running on a 128 computer Linux cluster, the simulation takes 10 hours for a single \"M. genitalium\" cell to divide once\u2014about the same time the actual cell takes\u2014and generates half a gigabyte of data.\nResearch.\nThe discovery of Protein M, a protein produced by \"M. genitalium\", was announced in February 2014. The protein was identified during investigations on the origin of multiple myeloma, a B-cell hematologic neoplasm. To understand the long-term \"Mycoplasma\" infection, it was found that antibodies from multiple myeloma patients' blood were recognised by \"M. genitalium\". The antibody reactivity was due to a protein, designated Protein M, that is chemically responsive to all types of human and nonhuman antibodies available. The protein is about 50 kDa in size, and composed of 556 amino acids.\nMgen evolved from a gram-positive ancestor that was clostridium-like but has lost the genes to code for the enzymes involved in de novo nucleic acid synthesis, amino acid synthesis, and synthesis of fatty acids. This means that Mgen needs the host's growth factors to keep reproducing. Although Mgen has abilities that help it adhere to cells, it is still unknown how the bacteria can maintain an infection inside the epithelial cells of the ectocervix and vagina when shedding of the apical layer of cells occur. The organism's ability to have adhesion to host cells relies of two proteins, P110 and P140. Adhesion is an important step in beginning an infection in a cell and Mgen can adhere to spermatozoa, erythrocytes, and epithelial cells. The terminal organelle relies on these proteins as well because without them the organelle was not present. The segmented pair plates of Mgen is a core of dense electrons which is anchored to the cell membrane. The end of this core is in contact with the wheel complex and the wheel complex contains the proteins MG219, MG200, MG386, and MG491 which aid in the gliding motility of the bacteria. Although Mgen lacks secreted virulence factors, the protein MG186 degrades host nucleic acids due to it being a calcium-dependent membrane-associated nuclease.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

On 1 February 1979, he murdered journalist Abdi \u0130pek\u00e7i, known for his leftist views, and was imprisoned, but escaped. He travelled illegally to Vatican City on 13 May 1981, and attempted to assassinate Pope John Paul II on the same day. However, the assassination attempt failed, and he was captured and imprisoned by the Italian police.\nAfter being imprisoned for 19 years in Italy where he was visited by the Pope, he was deported to Turkey, where he served a ten-year sentence. A\u011fca was released from prison on 18 January 2010. He described himself as a mercenary with no political orientation, although he is known to have been a member of the fascist, Turkish ultra-nationalist Grey Wolves, as well as the state-sponsored Counter-Guerrilla.\nIn 2014, thirty-three years after his crime, A\u011fca visited Vatican City to lay white roses on the tomb of the recently canonized John Paul II, and said he wanted to meet Pope Francis, a request that was denied.\nEarly life.\nMehmet Ali A\u011fca was born on 9 January 1958 in Hekimhan in a poor Turkish peasant family.\nAs a youth, he became a petty criminal and a member of numerous street gangs in his hometown. He became a smuggler between Turkey and Bulgaria. He claims to have received two months of training in weaponry and terrorist tactics in Syria as a member of the Marxist Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP) paid for by the Communist Bulgarian government, although the PFLP has denied this.\nGrey Wolves involvement.\nAfter training, A\u011fca went to work for the ultranationalist Turkish organization Grey Wolves. On 1 February 1979, in Istanbul, under orders from the Grey Wolves, he murdered Abdi \u0130pek\u00e7i, editor of the major Turkish newspaper \"Milliyet\". After being denounced by an informant, he was caught and sentenced to life in prison. After serving six months, he escaped with the help of Abdullah \u00c7atl\u0131, second-in-command of the Grey Wolves, and fled to Bulgaria, which was a base of operations for the Turkish mafia. According to investigative journalist Lucy Komisar, A\u011fca had worked on \u0130pek\u00e7i's assassination with \u00c7atl\u0131, who then reportedly helped organize A\u011fca's escape from an Istanbul military prison. According to Komisar, some have suggested \u00c7atl\u0131 was even involved in the Pope's assassination attempt. According to Reuters, A\u011fca had escaped with suspected help from sympathizers in the security services. Komisar added that at the scene of the Mercedes-Benz crash where \u00c7atl\u0131 died, he was found with a passport under the name of \"Mehmet \u00d6zbay\"\u00a0\u2014 an alias also used by A\u011fca.\nAttempted assassination of Pope John Paul II.\nIn 1979 \"The New York Times\" reported that A\u011fca, whom it called \"the self-confessed killer of an Istanbul newspaperman\", had described the Pope as \"the masked leader of the Crusades\" and threatened to shoot him if he did not cancel his planned visit to Turkey, which went ahead in late November 1979. The paper also said (on 28 November 1979) that the killing would be in revenge for the then still ongoing attack on the Grand Mosque in Mecca, which had begun on 20 November, and which he blamed on the United States or Israel.\nBeginning in August 1980, A\u011fca began criss-crossing the Mediterranean region. According to his later testimony, he met with three accomplices in Rome, one a fellow Turk and the other two Bulgarians. The operation was commanded by Zilo Vassilev, the Bulgarian military attach\u00e9 in Italy. He said that he was assigned this mission by Turkish mafioso Bekir \u00c7elenk in Bulgaria. \"Le Monde diplomatique\", however, has alleged that the assassination attempt was organized by Abdullah \u00c7atl\u0131 \"in exchange for the sum of 3 million marks\", paid by Bekir \u00c7elenk to the Grey Wolves.\nAccording to A\u011fca, the plan was for him and the back-up gunman Oral \u00c7elik to open fire in St. Peter's Square and escape to the Bulgarian embassy under the cover of the panic generated by a small explosion. On 13 May they sat in the Square, writing postcards and waiting for the Pope to arrive. When the Pope passed them, A\u011fca fired several shots and wounded him, but was grabbed by spectators and Vatican security chief Camillo Cibin. This prevented him from finishing the assassination or escaping. Two bullets hit John Paul II, one of them lodging in his lower intestine, the other hitting his left hand. Two bystanders were also hit. \u00c7elik panicked and fled without setting off his bomb or opening fire. The Pope survived the assassination attempt.\nPrison time, release, and rearrest.\nA\u011fca was sentenced on 23 July 1981 to life imprisonment in Italy for the assassination attempt. Following his shooting, Pope John Paul II asked people to \"pray for my brother (A\u011fca), whom I have sincerely forgiven.\" In 1983, the Pope and A\u011fca met and spoke privately at the prison where A\u011fca was being held. The Pope was also in touch with A\u011fca's family over the years, meeting his mother in 1987 and his brother a decade later. After he was imprisoned, A\u011fca announced that he had left Islam and converted to Christianity.\nA\u011fca's release was requested in the summer of 1983 by the alleged kidnappers of Emanuela Orlandi, the young daughter of a Vatican employee, who mysteriously disappeared in Rome in June of that year. On 9 June 1997, Air Malta Flight 830 was hijacked by two men. After landing in Cologne, the hijackers demanded the release of A\u011fca. He was not released and the hijackers surrendered. After serving almost 20 years of a life sentence in prison in Italy, at the request of Pope John Paul II, A\u011fca was pardoned by the then Italian president Carlo Azeglio Ciampi in June 2000 and deported to Turkey.\nFollowing his extradition, he was imprisoned for the 1979 murder of Abdi \u0130pek\u00e7i and for two bank raids carried out in the 1970s. A\u011fca was arrested on 25 June and incarcerated in the Maltepe Military Prison. He fled to Bulgaria on 25 November and was sentenced to death \"in absentia\". A\u011fca was extradited to Turkey in 2000 by benefiting from the Conditional Amnesty Law. This consideration granted to A\u011fca elicited strong reactions. Both cases were merged and tried before the Kad\u0131k\u00f6y 1st High Criminal Court. The single trial concerned the hijacking of Cengiz Aydos's taxi in 1979, robbing the Y\u0131ld\u0131r\u0131m jewellery store in K\u0131z\u0131ltoprak on 22 March 1979 and stealing money from the Fruko soda storage on 4 April 1979. On 18 January 2000, the judges dismissed the charges because of the statute of limitations on the case filed for the jewellery store robbery and for \"breach of the Firearms Act\" (law no. 6136). For embezzlement and money theft A\u011fca was sentenced to 36 years of imprisonment. A\u011fca's lawyers applied for his release under Law no. 4516 on Parole and Deferral of Penalties in December 2000. Their request was denied by the 1st High Criminal Court of Kartal. The lawyers filed an appeal against this decision, but the appeals court upheld the ruling. A\u011fca's life sentence was reduced to 10 years under a Turkish law that shortened prison sentences if served in a foreign prison. The money-laundering conviction and 36-year sentence were overturned because of the statute of limitations for robbery, which was seven years under Turkish law.\nIn early February 2005, during the Pope's final illness, A\u011fca sent a letter to the Pope wishing him well and also warning him that the world would end soon. When the Pope died on 2 April 2005, A\u011fca's brother Adnan gave an interview in which he said that A\u011fca and his entire family were grieving, and that the Pope had been a great friend to them.\nA\u011fca was released on parole on 12 January 2006. Mustafa Demirba\u011f, his lawyer, explained his release as a combination of amnesty and penal reform: an amnesty in 2000 deducted 10 years from his time, the court then deducted his 20 years in the Italian prison based on a new article in the penal code, and so he became eligible for parole for good behaviour. However, a report from the French AFP news agency stated that \"The Turkish judicial authorities still haven't explained exactly which legal resources he had access to\", and former Minister of Justice Hikmet Sami T\u00fcrk, in government at the time of A\u011fca's extradition, claimed that, from a legal viewpoint, his release was a \"serious mistake\" at best, and that he should have not been freed before 2012. However, on 20 January 2006, the Turkish Supreme Court ruled that his time served in Italy could not be deducted from his Turkish sentence and he was again imprisoned.\nLater developments and release.\nOn 2 May 2008, A\u011fca asked to be awarded Polish citizenship as he wished to spend the final years of his life in Poland, Pope John Paul II's country of birth. A\u011fca stated that upon his release he wanted to visit Pope John Paul II's tomb and partner with Dan Brown on writing a book.\nA\u011fca was released from jail on 18 January 2010. He was transferred to a military hospital in order to assess if, at 52, he was still fit for compulsory military service. The military found him unfit for military service for having \"antisocial personality disorder\". In a statement, he announced: \"I will meet you in the next three days. In the name of God Almighty, I proclaim the end of the world in this century. All the world will be destroyed, every human being will die. I am not God, I am not son of God, I am Christ eternal.\"\nA\u011fca visited the tomb of John Paul II on 27 December 2014. He desired to become a Catholic priest in 2016 and go to F\u00e1tima, Portugal to celebrate the 100th anniversary of the Marian apparitions there (Our Lady of F\u00e1tima).\nIn November 2025, A\u011fca visited Iznik in an attempt to meet with Pope Leo XIV ahead of the latter's visit but was removed by authorities.\nClaims of external involvement in the assassination attempt.\nIn November 2010, A\u011fca accused Cardinal Agostino Casaroli of being the mastermind behind the assassination attempt on John Paul II. It has also been alleged that the Soviet Union's KGB ordered the assassination, because of John Paul II's support for the Solidarity labor movement in Poland. A\u011fca stated this during one of his interrogations before trial.\nWhen A\u011fca published his memoirs in 2013, his story changed completely, writing that the Iranian government and Ayatollah Khomeini ordered the assassination attempt on John Paul II. According to this new version of the events, A\u011fca received instructions and training in weapons and explosives in Iran, from Mohsen Rezai, under the orders of Ayatollah Jaffar Subhani and Ayatollah Khomeini. In his book, A\u011fca acknowledges that he lied previously about the Bulgarian and Soviet connection. He stayed in Sofia for about a month but was not in contact with any Bulgarian or other intelligence officers. In transit from Turkey to Western Europe, he was delayed in Sofia because his fake Indian passport was of such poor quality that on several occasions he had to bribe officials who became suspicious. So, he waited to receive a much better-quality Turkish passport from the Grey Wolves: a genuine passport issued by the Turkish government to another person, Faruk Faruk \u00d6zg\u00fcn, only the photo of \u00d6zg\u00fcn was replaced by a photo of A\u011fca.\nWhen Pope John Paul II visited him in prison in Italy, on 27 December 1983 (two and a half years after the assassination attempt), A\u011fca recalls in his memoirs he kissed the hand of the Pope, having kissed three years earlier the hand of Khomeini in Iran, and when asked, he told John Paul II that Ruhollah Khomeini ordered the assassination. The claim was subsequently dismissed by the Vatican as a lie.\nA\u011fca's shooting of the Pope and possible KGB involvement is featured in Tom Clancy's 2002 novel \"Red Rabbit\" and Frederick Forsyth's novel \"The Fourth Protocol\". He has also been mentioned in the book \"The Third Revelation\" by Ralph McInerny, and was portrayed by actors Christopher Bucholz in the RAI production \"Attentato al papa\", Sebastian Knapp in the ABC TV biopic movie ', Massimiliano Ubaldi in CBS's TV miniseries \"Pope John Paul II\" (both 2005) and Alkis Zanis in the 2006 Canadian TV sequel '.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "20224", "revid": "36452830", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20224", "title": "Mummy", "text": "Preserved dead human or animal\nA mummy is a dead human or an animal whose soft tissues and organs have been preserved by either intentional or accidental exposure to chemicals, extreme cold, very low humidity, or lack of air, so that the recovered body does not decay further if kept in cool and dry conditions. Some authorities restrict the use of the term to bodies deliberately embalmed with chemicals, but the use of the word to cover accidentally desiccated bodies goes back to at least the early 17th century.\nMummies of humans and animals have been found on every continent, both as a result of natural preservation through unusual conditions, and as cultural artifacts. Over one million animal mummies have been found in Egypt, many of which are cats. Many of the Egyptian animal mummies are sacred ibis, and radiocarbon dating suggests the Egyptian ibis mummies that have been analyzed were from a time frame that falls between approximately 450 and 250 BC.\nThe earliest discovered evidence of deliberate mummification in human cultures now extends to approximately 10,000 B.C. and is documented to have existed across Southeast Asia, China, New Guinea, and Australia in burials discovered there, and is prompting research to cultures documented to 20,000 years ago for evidence of use of the same mummification methods. \nIn addition to the mummies of ancient Egypt, deliberate mummification was a feature of several ancient cultures in areas of America and Asia with very dry climates. The Spirit Cave mummies of Fallon, Nevada, in North America were accurately dated at more than 9,400 years old. Before this discovery, the oldest known deliberate mummy was a child, one of the Chinchorro mummies found in the Camarones Valley, Chile, which dates around 5050 B.C. The oldest known naturally mummified human corpse is a severed head dated as 6,000 years old, found in 1936 at the in Argentina.\nEtymology and meaning.\nThe English word \"mummy\" is derived from medieval Latin \"Mumia\", a borrowing of the medieval Arabic word \"m\u016bmiya\" (\u0645\u0648\u0645\u064a\u0627\u0621) which meant an embalmed corpse, as well as the bituminous embalming substance. This word was borrowed from Persian where it meant asphalt, and is derived from the word \"m\u016bm\" meaning wax. The meaning of \"corpse preserved by desiccation\" developed post-medievally. The Medieval English term \"mummy\" was defined as \"medical preparation of the substance of mummies\", rather than the entire corpse, with Richard Hakluyt in 1599 AD complaining that \"these dead bodies are the Mummy which the Phisistians and Apothecaries doe against our willes make us to swallow\". These substances were called mummia.\nThe Oxford English Dictionary defines a mummy as \"the body of a human being or animal embalmed (according to the ancient Egyptian or some analogous method) as a preparation for burial\", citing sources from 1615 AD onward. However, Chamber's \"Cyclop\u00e6dia\" and the Victorian zoologist Francis Trevelyan Buckland define a mummy as follows: \"A human or animal body desiccated by exposure to sun or air. Also applied to the frozen carcase of an animal imbedded in prehistoric snow\".\nWasps of the genus \"Aleiodes\" are known as \"mummy wasps\" because they wrap their caterpillar prey as \"mummies\".\nHistory of mummy studies.\nWhile interest in the study of mummies dates as far back as Ptolemaic Greece, most structured scientific study began at the beginning of the 20th century. Prior to this, many rediscovered mummies were sold as curiosities or for use in pseudoscientific novelties such as mummia. The first modern scientific examinations of mummies began in 1901, conducted by professors at the English-language Government School of Medicine in Cairo, Egypt. The first X-ray of a mummy came in 1903, when professors Grafton Elliot Smith and Howard Carter used the only X-ray machine in Cairo at the time to examine the mummified body of Thutmose IV. British chemist Alfred Lucas applied chemical analyses to Egyptian mummies during this same period, which returned many results about the types of substances used in embalming. Lucas also made significant contributions to the analysis of Tutankhamun in 1922.\nPathological study of mummies saw varying levels of popularity throughout the 20th century. In 1992, the First World Congress on Mummy Studies was held in Puerto de la Cruz on Tenerife in the Canary Islands. More than 300 scientists attended the Congress to share nearly 100 years of collected data on mummies. The information presented at the meeting triggered a new surge of interest in the subject, with one of the major results being the integration of biomedical and bioarchaeological information on mummies with existing databases. This was not possible prior to the Congress due to the unique and highly specialized techniques required to gather such data.\nIn more recent years, CT scanning has become an invaluable tool in the study of mummification by allowing researchers to digitally \"unwrap\" mummies without risking damage to the body. The level of detail in such scans is so intricate that small linens used in tiny areas such as the nostrils can be digitally reconstructed in 3-D. Such modelling has been utilized to perform digital autopsies on mummies to determine the cause of death and lifestyle, such as in the case of Tutankhamun.\nTypes.\nMummies are typically divided into one of two distinct categories: anthropogenic or spontaneous. Anthropogenic mummies were deliberately created by the living for any number of reasons, the most common being for religious purposes. Spontaneous mummies, such as \u00d6tzi and the Maronite mummies, were created unintentionally due to natural conditions such as extremely dry heat or cold, or acidic and anaerobic conditions such as those found in bogs. While most individual mummies exclusively belong to one category or the other, there are examples of both types being connected to a single culture, such as those from the ancient Egyptian culture and the Andean cultures of South America. Some of the later well-preserved corpses of the mummification were found under Christian churches, such as the mummified vicar Nicolaus Rungius found under the St. Michael Church in Keminmaa, Finland. There are also cases that fall outside of these categories.\nEgyptian mummies.\nUntil recently, it was believed that the earliest ancient Egyptian mummies were created naturally due to the environment in which they were buried. In 2014, an 11-year study by the University of York, Macquarie University and the University of Oxford suggested that artificial mummification occurred 1,500 years earlier than first thought. This was confirmed in 2018, when tests on a 5,600-year-old mummy in Turin revealed that it had been deliberately mummified using linen wrappings and embalming oils made from conifer resin and aromatic plant extracts.\nThe preservation of the dead had a profound effect on ancient Egyptian religion. Mummification was an integral part of the rituals for the dead beginning as early as the 2nd dynasty (about 2800 BC). Egyptians saw the preservation of the body after death as an important step to living well in the afterlife. As Egypt gained more prosperity, burial practices became a status symbol for the wealthy as well. This cultural hierarchy led to the creation of elaborate tombs, and more sophisticated methods of embalming.\nBy the 4th dynasty (about 2600 BC) Egyptian embalmers began to achieve \"true mummification\" through a process of evisceration. Much of this early experimentation with mummification in Egypt is unknown.\nThe few documents that directly describe the mummification process date to the Greco-Roman period. The majority of the papyri that have survived only describe the ceremonial rituals involved in embalming, not the actual surgical processes involved. A text known as \"The Ritual of Embalming\" does describe some of the practical logistics of embalming; however, there are only two known copies and each is incomplete. With regards to mummification shown in images, there are apparently also very few. The tomb of Tjay, designated TT23, is one of only two known which show the wrapping of a mummy (Riggs 2014).\nAnother text that describes the processes being used in the latter periods is Herodotus' Histories. Written in Book 2 of the \"Histories\" is one of the most detailed descriptions of the Egyptian mummification process, including the mention of using natron in order to dehydrate corpses for preservation. However, these descriptions are short and fairly vague, leaving scholars to infer the majority of the techniques that were used by studying mummies that have been unearthed.\nBy utilizing current advancements in technology, scientists have been able to uncover a plethora of new information about the techniques used in mummification. A series of CT scans performed on a 2,400-year-old mummy in 2008 revealed a tool that was left inside the cranial cavity of the skull. The tool was a rod, made of an organic material, that was used to break apart the brain to allow it to drain out of the nose. This discovery helped to dispel the claim within Herodotus' works that the rod had been a hook made of iron. Earlier experimentation in 1994 by researchers Bob Brier and Ronald Wade supported these findings. While attempting to replicate Egyptian mummification, Brier and Wade discovered that removal of the brain was much easier when the brain was liquefied and allowed to drain with the help of gravity, as opposed to trying to pull the organ out piece by piece with a hook.\nThrough various methods of study over many decades, modern Egyptologists now have an accurate understanding of how mummification was achieved in ancient Egypt. The first and most important step was to halt the process of decomposition, by removing the internal organs and washing out the body with a mix of spices and palm wine. The only organ left behind was the heart, as tradition held the heart was the seat of thought and feeling and would therefore still be needed in the afterlife. After cleansing, the body was then dried out with natron inside the empty body cavity as well as outside on the skin. The internal organs were also dried and either sealed in individual jars, or wrapped to be replaced within the body. This process typically took forty days.\nAfter dehydration, the mummy was wrapped in many layers of linen cloth. Within the layers, Egyptian priests placed small amulets to guard the decedent from evil. Once the mummy was completely wrapped, it was coated in resin in order to keep the threat of moist air away. The resin was also applied to the coffin in order to seal it. The mummy was then sealed within its tomb, alongside the worldly goods that were believed to help aid it in the afterlife.\n\"Aspergillus niger\", a hardy species of fungus capable of living in a variety of environments, has been found in the mummies of ancient Egyptian tombs and can be inhaled when they are disturbed.\nMummification and rank.\nMummification is one of the defining customs in ancient Egyptian society for people today. The practice of preserving the human body is believed to be a quintessential feature of Egyptian life. Yet even mummification has a history of development and was accessible to different ranks of society in different ways during different periods. There were at least three different processes of mummification according to Herodotus. They range from \"the most perfect\" to the method employed by the \"poorer classes\".\n\"Most perfect\" method.\nThe most expensive process was to preserve the body by dehydration and protect against pests, such as insects. Almost all of the actions Herodotus described served one of these two functions.\nFirst, the brain was removed from the cranium through the nose; the gray matter was discarded. Modern mummy excavations have shown that instead of an iron hook inserted through the nose as Herodotus claims, a rod was used to liquefy the brain via the cranium, which then drained out the nose by gravity. The embalmers then rinsed the skull with certain drugs that mostly cleared any residue of brain tissue and also had the effect of killing bacteria. Next, the embalmers made an incision along the flank with a sharp blade fashioned from an Ethiopian stone and removed the contents of the abdomen. Herodotus does not discuss the separate preservation of these organs and their placement either in special jars or back in the cavity, a process that was part of the most expensive embalming, according to archaeological evidence.\nThe abdominal cavity was then rinsed with palm wine and an infusion of crushed, fragrant herbs and spices; the cavity was then filled with spices including myrrh, cassia, and, Herodotus notes, \"every other sort of spice except frankincense\", also to preserve the person.\nThe body was further dehydrated by placing it in natron, a naturally occurring salt, for 70 days. Herodotus insists that the body did not stay in the natron longer than 70 days. Any shorter time and the body would not be completely dehydrated; any longer, and the body would be too stiff to move into position for wrapping. The embalmers then washed the body again and wrapped it with linen bandages. The bandages were covered with a gum that modern research has shown is both a waterproofing agent and an antimicrobial agent.\nAt this point, the body was given back to the family. These \"perfect\" mummies were then placed in human-shaped wooden cases. Wealthy people placed these wooden cases in stone sarcophagi that provided further protection. The family placed the sarcophagus in the tomb upright against the wall, according to Herodotus.\nAvoiding expense.\nThe second process that Herodotus describes was used by middle-class people or people who \"wish to avoid expense\". In this method, an oil derived from cedar trees was injected with a syringe into the abdomen. A rectal plug prevented the oil from escaping. This oil probably had the dual purpose of liquefying the internal organs but also of disinfecting the abdominal cavity. (By liquefying the organs, the family avoided the expense of canopic jars and separate preservation.) The body was then placed in natron for seventy days. At the end of this time, the body was removed and the cedar oil, now containing the liquefied organs, was drained through the rectum. With the body dehydrated, it could be returned to the family. Herodotus does not describe the process of burial of such mummies, but they were perhaps placed in a shaft tomb. Poorer people used coffins fashioned from terracotta.\nInexpensive method.\nThe third and least expensive method the embalmers offered was to clear the intestines with an unnamed liquid, injected as an enema. The body was then placed in natron for seventy days and returned to the family. Herodotus gives no further details.\nChristian mummies.\nIn Christian tradition, some bodies of saints are naturally conserved and venerated.\nMummification in other cultures.\nAfrica.\nIn addition to the mummies of Egypt, there have been instances of mummies being discovered in other areas of the African continent. The bodies show a mix of anthropogenic and spontaneous mummification, with some being thousands of years old.\nCanary Islands.\nThe mummies of the Canary Islands belong to the indigenous Guanche people and date to the time before 14th-century Spanish explorers settled in the area. All deceased people within the Guanche culture were mummified during this time, though the level of care taken with embalming and burial varied depending on individual social status. Embalming was carried out by specialized groups, organized according to gender, who were considered unclean by the rest of the community. The techniques for embalming were similar to those of the ancient Egyptians, involving evisceration, preservation, and stuffing of the evacuated bodily cavities, then wrapping the body in animal skins. Despite the successful techniques utilized by the Guanche, very few mummies remain due to looting and desecration.\nLibya.\nThe mummified remains of an infant were discovered during an expedition by archaeologist Fabrizio Mori to Libya during the winter of 1958\u20131959 in the natural cave structure of Uan Muhuggiag. After curious deposits and cave paintings were discovered on the surfaces of the cave, expedition leaders decided to excavate. Uncovered alongside fragmented animal bone tools was the mummified body of an infant, wrapped in animal skin and wearing a necklace made of ostrich egg shell beads. Professor Tongiorgi of the University of Pisa radiocarbon-dated the infant to between 5,000 and 8,000 years old. A long incision located on the right abdominal wall, and the absence of internal organs, indicated that the body had been eviscerated post-mortem, possibly in an effort to preserve the remains. A bundle of herbs found within the body cavity also supported this conclusion. Further research revealed that the child had been around 30 months old at the time of death, though sex could not be determined due to poor preservation of the sex organs.\nSouth Africa.\nThe first mummy to be discovered in South Africa was found in the Baviaanskloof Wilderness Area by Dr. Johan Binneman in 1999. Nicknamed Moses, the mummy was estimated to be around 2,000 years old. After being linked to the indigenous Khoi culture of the region, the National Council of Khoi Chiefs of South Africa began to make legal demands that the mummy be returned shortly after the body was moved to the Albany Museum in Grahamstown.\nAsia.\nThe mummies of Asia are usually considered to be accidental. The decedents were buried in just the right place where the environment could act as an agent for preservation. This is particularly common in the desert areas of the Tarim Basin and Iran. Mummies have been discovered in more humid Asian climates; however, these are subject to rapid decay after being removed from the grave.\nChina.\nMummies from various dynasties throughout China's history have been discovered in several locations across the country. They are almost exclusively considered to be unintentional mummifications. Many areas in which mummies have been uncovered are difficult for preservation, due to their warm, moist climates. This makes the recovery of mummies a challenge, as exposure to the outside world can cause the bodies to decay in a matter of hours.\nAn example of a Chinese mummy that was preserved despite being buried in an environment not conducive to mummification is Xin Zhui. Also known as Lady Dai, she was discovered in the early 1970s at the Mawangdui archaeological site in Changsha. She was the wife of the Marquis of Dai during the Han dynasty, who was also buried with her alongside another young man often considered to be a very close relative. However, Xin Zhui's body was the only one of the three to be mummified. Her corpse was so well-preserved that surgeons from the Hunan Provincial Medical Institute were able to perform an autopsy. The exact reason why her body was so completely preserved has yet to be determined.\nAmong the mummies discovered in China are those termed Tarim mummies because of their discovery in the Tarim Basin. The dry desert climate of the basin proved to be an excellent agent for desiccation. For this reason, over 200 Tarim mummies, which are over 4,000 years old, were excavated from a cemetery in the present-day Xinjiang region. The mummies were found buried in upside-down boats with hundreds of 13-foot-long wooden poles in the place of tombstones. DNA sequence data shows that the mummies had Haplogroup R1a (Y-DNA) characteristic of western Eurasia in the area of East-Central Europe, Central Asia and the Indus Valley. This has created a stir in the Turkic-speaking Uighur population of the region, who claim the area has always belonged to their culture, while it was not until the 10th century that Uighurs are said by scholars to have moved to the region from Central Asia. American Sinologist Victor H. Mair claims that \"the earliest mummies in the Tarim Basin were exclusively Caucasoid, or Europoid\" with \"east Asian migrants arriving in the eastern portions of the Tarim Basin around 3,000 years ago\", while Mair also notes that it was not until 842 that the Uighur peoples settled in the area. Other mummified remains have been recovered from around the Tarim Basin at sites including Q\u00e4wrighul, Yanghai, Shengjindian, Shanpula (Sampul), Zaghunluq, and Qizilchoqa.\nIran.\nAs of 2012, at least eight mummified human remains have been recovered from the Douzlakh Salt Mine at Chehr Abad in northwestern Iran. Due to their salt preservation, these bodies are collectively known as Saltmen. Carbon-14 testing conducted in 2008 dated three of the bodies to around 400 BC. Later isotopic research on the other mummies returned similar dates, however, many of these individuals were found to be from a region that is not closely associated with the mine. It was during this time that researchers determined the mine suffered a major collapse, which likely caused the death of the miners. Since there is significant archaeological data that indicates the area was not actively inhabited during this time period, current consensus holds that the accident occurred during a brief period of temporary mining activity.\nLebanon.\nIn 1990, a team of speleologists uncovered eight mummies, dating back to around 1283 AD, during a rescue excavation in the e 'Asi al-Hadath cave in the Qadisha Valley of Lebanon. The well-preserved spontaneous mummies, including an infant named dubbed Yasmine, offer insights into Maronite villagers' lives during the Mamluk era. The grotto's high altitude and dry conditions naturally mummified the bodies. The discovery provides historical context, aligning with documented Mamluk raids in the region. Artifacts, including pottery with inscriptions, manuscripts, and clothing, suggest a Maronite community, and the mummies' burial practices parallel present-day Lebanese customs. The remains were called \"Maronite mummies\" because the individuals found in the 'Asi-al Hadath cave were believed to be Maronites, an indigenous Christian community in the region. Some of the mummies have been transferred to the National Museum of Beirut.\nKorea.\nMummies have been discovered in Korea that have been dated to around the 15th to 19th centuries, during the Joseon period. This is thought to be because of the rise of Neo-Confucianism in Korea, which prescribed certain burial practices that created conditions favorable to mummification. However, this mummification was likely unintentional, and even culturally seen as ominous and undesirable.\nMummification likely occurred due to a number of factors. One such factor was the airtight seal (especially as the Korean climate is unfavorable to mummification) around the bodies, which was achieved using a mix of lime, clay, and sand. Recreations of the sealing process found that chemical reactions with the lime possibly caused a high and prolonged release of heat, which killed bacteria in the bodies. In addition, a large amount of clothing was usually placed inside tombs, which led to a shortage of oxygen inside. Mummies buried using the lime mixture sealing technique reportedly have especially excellently preserved soft skin and hair, which has enabled medical and genetic studies to be performed. Insights have been offered into the lifestyles and pathologies of Korean people during this period. Specific diseases for each individual have been identified.\nPhilippines.\nPhilippine mummies, or Kabayan Mummies, are common in Igorot, specifically Ibaloi, culture. The mummies date back as far as 200 BC and up to the 19th century. They are named for the Kabayan region where they predominantly are found.\nSiberia.\nIn 1993, a team of Russian archaeologists led by Dr. Natalia Polosmak discovered the Siberian Ice Maiden, a Scytho-Siberian woman, on the Ukok Plateau in the Altai Mountains near the Mongolian border. The mummy was naturally frozen due to the severe climatic conditions of the Siberian steppe. Also known as Princess Ukok, the mummy was dressed in finely detailed clothing and wore an elaborate headdress and jewelry. Alongside her body were buried six decorated horses and a symbolic meal for her last journey. Her left arm and hand were tattooed with animal style figures, including a highly stylized deer.\nThe Ice Maiden has been a source of some recent controversy. The mummy's skin has suffered some slight decay, and the tattoos have faded since the excavation. Some residents of the Altai Republic, formed after the breakup of the Soviet Union, have requested the return of the Ice Maiden, who is currently stored in Novosibirsk in Siberia.\nAnother Siberian mummy, a man, was discovered much earlier in 1929. His skin was also marked with tattoos of two monsters resembling griffins, which decorated his chest, and three partially obliterated images which seem to represent two deer and a mountain goat on his left arm.\nEurope.\nThe European continent is home to a diverse spectrum of spontaneous and anthropogenic mummies. Some of the best-preserved mummies have come from bogs located across the region. The Capuchin monks that inhabited the area left behind hundreds of intentionally-preserved bodies that have provided insight into the customs and cultures of people from various eras. One of the oldest mummies (nicknamed \u00d6tzi) was discovered on this continent. New mummies continue to be uncovered in Europe well into the 21st century.\nBog bodies.\nGreat Britain, Ireland, Germany, the Netherlands, Sweden, and Denmark have produced a number of bog bodies, mummies of people deposited in sphagnum bogs, apparently as a result of murder or ritual sacrifices. In such cases, the acidity of the water, low temperature and lack of oxygen combined to tan the body's skin and soft tissues. The skeleton typically disintegrates over time. Such mummies are remarkably well preserved on emerging from the bog, with skin and internal organs intact; it is even possible to determine the decedent's last meal by examining stomach contents. The Haraldsk\u00e6r Woman was discovered by labourers in a bog in Jutland in 1835. She was erroneously identified as an early medieval Danish queen, and for that reason was placed in a royal sarcophagus at the Saint Nicolai Church, Vejle, where she currently remains. Another bog body, also from Denmark, known as the Tollund Man was discovered in 1950. The corpse was noted for its excellent preservation of the face and feet, which appeared as if the man had recently died. Only the head of Tollund Man remains, due to the decomposition of the rest of his body, which was not preserved along with the head.\nCzech Republic.\nThe majority of mummies recovered in the Czech Republic come from underground crypts. While there is some evidence of deliberate mummification, most sources state that desiccation occurred naturally due to unique conditions within the crypts.\nThe Capuchin Crypt in Brno contains three hundred years of mummified remains directly below the main altar. Beginning in the 18th century when the crypt was opened, and continuing until the practice was discontinued in 1787, the Capuchin friars of the monastery would lay the deceased on a pillow of bricks on the ground. The unique air quality and topsoil within the crypt naturally preserved the bodies over time.\nApproximately fifty mummies were discovered in an abandoned crypt beneath the Church of St. Procopius of S\u00e1zava in Vamberk in the mid-1980s. Workers digging a trench accidentally broke into the crypt, which began to fill with waste water. The mummies quickly began to deteriorate, though thirty-four were able to be rescued and stored temporarily at the District Museum of the Orlick\u00e9 Mountains until they could be returned to the monastery in 2000. The mummies range in age and social status at time of death, with at least two children and one priest. The majority of the Vamberk mummies date from the 18th century.\nThe Klatovy catacombs currently house an exhibition of Jesuit mummies, alongside some aristocrats, that were originally interred between 1674 and 1783. In the early 1930s, the mummies were accidentally damaged during repairs, resulting in the loss of 140 bodies. The newly updated airing system preserves the thirty-eight bodies that are currently on display.\nDenmark.\nApart from several bog bodies, Denmark has also yielded several other mummies, such as the three Borum Esh\u00f8j mummies, the Skrydstrup Woman and the Egtved Girl, who were all found inside burial mounds, or tumuli.\nIn 1875, the Borum Esh\u00f8j grave mound was uncovered, which had been built around three coffins, which belonged to a middle aged man and woman as well as a man in his early twenties. Through examination, the woman was discovered to be around 50\u201360 years old. She was found with several artifacts made of bronze, consisting of buttons, a belt plate, and rings, showing she was of higher class. All of the hair had been removed from the skull later when farmers had dug through the casket. Her original hairstyle is unknown. The two men wore kilts, and the younger man wore a sheath which contained a bronze dagger. All three mummies were dated to 1351\u20131345 BC.\nThe Skrydstrup Woman was unearthed from a tumulus in Southern Jutland, in 1935. Carbon-14 dating showed that she had died around 1300 BC; examination also revealed that she was around 18\u201319 years old at the time of death, and that she had been buried in the summertime. Her hair had been drawn up in an elaborate hairstyle, which was then covered by a horse hair hairnet made by the sprang technique. She was wearing a blouse and a necklace as well as two golden earrings, showing she was of higher class.\nThe Egtved Girl, dated to 1370 BC, was also found inside a sealed coffin within a tumulus, in 1921. She was wearing a bodice and a skirt, including a belt and bronze bracelets. Found with the girl, at her feet, were the cremated remains of a child and, by her head, a box containing some bronze pins, a hairnet, and an awl.\nHungary.\nIn 1994, 265 mummified bodies were found in the crypt of a Dominican church in V\u00e1c, Hungary from the 1729\u20131838 period. The discovery proved to be scientifically important, and by 2006 an exhibition was established in the Museum of Natural History in Budapest. Unique to the Hungarian mummies are their elaborately decorated coffins, with no two being exactly alike.\nItaly.\nThe varied geography and climatology of Italy has led to many cases of spontaneous mummification. Italian mummies display the same diversity, with a conglomeration of natural and intentional mummification spread across many centuries and cultures.\nThe oldest natural mummy in Europe was discovered in 1991 in the \u00d6tztal Alps on the Austrian-Italian border. Nicknamed \u00d6tzi, the mummy is a 5,300-year-old male believed to be a member of the Tamins-Carasso-Isera cultural group of South Tyrol. Despite his age, a recent DNA study conducted by Walther Parson of Innsbruck Medical University revealed \u00d6tzi has 19 living genetic relatives.\nThe Capuchin Catacombs of Palermo were built in the 16th century by the friars of Palermo's Capuchin monastery. Originally intended to hold the deliberately mummified remains of dead friars, interment in the catacombs became a status symbol for the local population in the following centuries. Burials continued until the 1920s, with one of the final burials being that of Rosalia Lombardo. In all, the catacombs host nearly 8000 mummies.\nThe most recent discovery of mummies in Italy came in 2010, when sixty mummified human remains were found in the crypt of the Conversion of St Paul church in Roccapelago di Pievepelago, Italy. Built in the 15th century as a cannon hold and later converted in the 16th century, the crypt had been sealed once it had reached capacity, leaving the bodies to be protected and preserved. The crypt was reopened during restoration work on the church, revealing the diverse array of mummies inside. The bodies were quickly moved to a museum for further study.\nNorth America.\nThe mummies of North America are often steeped in controversy, as many of these bodies have been linked to still-existing native cultures. While the mummies provide a wealth of historically significant data, native cultures and tradition often demands the remains be returned to their original resting places. This has led to many legal actions by Native American councils, leading to most museums keeping mummified remains out of the public eye.\nCanada.\nKw\u00e4day D\u00e4n Ts'\u00ecnchi (\"Long ago person found\" in the Southern Tutchone language of the Champagne and Aishihik First Nations), was found in August 1999 by three First Nations hunters at the edge of a glacier in Tatshenshini-Alsek Provincial Park, British Columbia, Canada. According to the Kw\u00e4day D\u00e4n Ts'\u00ecnchi Project, the remains are the oldest well preserved mummy discovered in North America. (The Spirit Cave mummy although not well preserved, is much older.) Initial radiocarbon tests date the mummy to around 550 years-old.\nGreenland.\nIn 1972, eight remarkably preserved mummies were discovered at an abandoned Inuit settlement called Qilakitsoq, in Greenland. The \"Greenland Mummies\" consisted of a six-month-old baby, a four-year-old boy, and six women of various ages, who died around 500 years ago. Their bodies were naturally mummified by the sub-zero temperatures and dry winds in the cave in which they were found.\nMexico.\nIntentional mummification in pre-Columbian Mexico was practiced by the Aztec culture. These bodies are collectively known as Aztec mummies. Genuine Aztec mummies were \"bundled\" in a woven wrap and often had their faces covered by a ceremonial mask. Public knowledge of Aztec mummies increased due to traveling exhibits and museums in the 19th and 20th centuries, though these bodies were typically naturally desiccated remains and not actually the mummies associated with Aztec culture.\nNatural mummification has been known to occur in several places in Mexico; this includes the mummies of Guanajuato. A collection of these mummies, most of which date to the late 19th century, have been on display at \"El Museo de las Momias\" in the city of Guanajuato since 1970. The museum claims to have the smallest mummy in the world on display (a mummified fetus). It was thought that minerals in the soil had the preserving effect, however it may rather be due to the warm, arid climate. Mexican mummies are also on display in the small town of Encarnaci\u00f3n de D\u00edaz, Jalisco.\nUnited States.\nSpirit Cave Man was discovered in 1940 during salvage work prior to guano mining activity that was scheduled to begin in the area. The mummy is a middle-aged male, found completely dressed and lying on a blanket made of animal skin. Radiocarbon tests in the 1990s dated the mummy to being nearly 9,000 years old. The remains were held at the Nevada State Museum, though the local Native American community began petitioning to have the remains returned and reburied in 1995. When the Bureau of Land Management did not repatriate the mummy in 2000, the Fallon Paiute-Shoshone Tribe sued under the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act. After DNA sequencing determined that the remains were in fact related to modern Native Americans, they were repatriated to the tribe in 2016.\nOceania.\nMummies from Oceania are not limited only to Australia. Discoveries of mummified remains have also been located in New Guinea, New Zealand, and the Torres Strait, though these mummies have been historically harder to examine and classify. Prior to the 20th century, most literature on mummification in the region was either silent or anecdotal. However, the boom of interest generated by the scientific study of Egyptian mummification lead to more concentrated study of mummies in other cultures, including those of Oceania.\nAustralia.\nThe aboriginal mummification traditions found in Australia are thought be related to those found in the Torres Strait islands, the inhabitants of which achieved a high level of sophisticated mummification techniques. Australian mummies lack some of the technical ability of the Torres Strait mummies, however much of the ritual aspects of the mummification process are similar. Full-body mummification was achieved by these cultures, but not the level of artistic preservation as found on smaller islands. The reason for this seems to be for easier transport of bodies by more nomadic tribes.\nNew Guinea.\nUntil the mid-twentieth century, the Angu (or Anga) people of Papua New Guinea practiced mummification by smoking the bodies of the dead. Sites of their preserved mummies exist in the Morobe Province.\nTorres Strait.\nThe mummies of the Torres Strait have a considerably higher level of preservation technique as well as creativity compared to those found on Australia. The process began with removal of viscera, after which the bodies were set in a seated position on a platform and either left to dry in the sun or smoked over a fire in order to aid in desiccation. In the case of smoking, some tribes would collect the fat that drained from the body to mix with ocher to create red paint that would then be smeared back on the skin of the mummy. The mummies remained on the platforms, decorated with the clothing and jewelry they wore in life, before being buried.\nNew Zealand.\nSome M\u0101ori tribes from New Zealand would keep mummified heads as trophies from tribal warfare. They are also known as Mokomokai. In the 19th century, many of the trophies were acquired by Europeans who found the tattooed skin to be a phenomenal curiosity. Westerners began to offer valuable commodities in exchange for the uniquely tattooed mummified heads. The heads were later put on display in museums, 16 of them in France alone. In 2010, at a ceremony in the H\u00f4tel de Ville in Rouen, Rouen City Council returned one of the heads to New Zealand, despite earlier protests by the Culture Ministry of France.\nThere is also evidence that some M\u0101ori tribes may have practiced full-body mummification, though the practice is not thought to have been widespread. The discussion of M\u0101ori mummification has been historically controversial, with some experts in past decades claiming that such mummies have never existed.\nThe historical significance of full-body mummification within M\u0101ori culture is acknowledged by science, although there is still debate as to the nature of their exact mummification processes. Some mummies appear to have been spontaneously created by the natural environment, while others exhibit signs of direct human involvement. Generally, modern consensus tends to agree that there could have been a mixture of both types of mummification, similar to that of the Ancient Egyptian culture.\nSouth America.\nThe South American continent contains some of the oldest mummies in the world, both deliberate and accidental. The bodies were preserved by the best agent for mummification: the environment. The Pacific coastal desert in Peru and Chile is one of the driest areas in the world and the dryness facilitated mummification. Rather than developing elaborate processes such as later-dynasty ancient Egyptians, the early South Americans often left their dead in naturally dry or frozen areas, though some did perform surgical preparation when mummification was intentional. Some of the reasons for intentional mummification in South America include memorialization, immortalization, and religious offerings. A large number of mummified bodies have been found in pre-Columbian cemeteries scattered around Peru. The bodies had often been wrapped for burial in finely-woven textiles.\nChauchilla Cemetery.\nChauchilla Cemetery is a cemetery that contains prehispanic mummified human remains and archeological artifacts, located south of the city of Nazca in Peru.\nChinchorro mummies.\nThe Chinchorro mummies are the oldest intentionally prepared mummified bodies ever found. Beginning in 5th millennium BC and continuing for an estimated 3,500 years, all human burials within the Chinchorro culture were prepared for mummification. The bodies were carefully prepared, beginning with removal of the internal organs and skin, before being left in the hot, dry climate of the Atacama Desert, which aided in desiccation. A large number of Chinchorro mummies were also prepared by skilled artisans to be preserved in a more artistic fashion, though the purpose of this practice is widely debated.\nInca mummies.\nSeveral naturally-preserved, unintentional mummies dating from the Incan period (1438\u20131532 AD) have been found in the colder regions of Argentina, Chile, and Peru. These are collectively known as \"ice mummies\". The first Incan ice mummy was discovered in 1954 atop El Plomo Peak in Chile, after an eruption of the nearby volcano Sabancaya melted away ice that covered the body. The Mummy of El Plomo was a male child who was presumed to be wealthy due to his well-fed bodily characteristics. He was considered to be the most well-preserved ice mummy in the world until the discovery of Mummy Juanita in 1995.\nMummy Juanita was discovered near the summit of Ampato in the Peruvian section of the Andes mountains by archaeologist Johan Reinhard. Her body had been so thoroughly frozen that it had not been desiccated; much of her skin, muscle tissue, and internal organs retained their original structure. She is believed to be a ritual sacrifice, due to the close proximity of her body to the Incan capital of Cusco, as well as the fact she was wearing highly intricate clothing to indicate her special social status. Several Incan ceremonial artifacts and temporary shelters uncovered in the surrounding area seem to support this theory.\nMore evidence that the Inca left sacrificial victims to die in the elements, and later be unintentionally preserved, came in 1999 with the discovery of the Llullaillaco mummies on the border of Argentina and Chile. The three mummies are children, two girls and one boy, who are thought to be sacrifices associated with the ancient ritual of \"qhapaq hucha\". Recent biochemical analysis of the mummies has revealed that the victims had consumed increasing quantities of alcohol and coca, possibly in the form of chicha, in the months leading up to sacrifice. The dominant theory for the drugging reasons that, alongside ritual uses, the substances probably made the children more docile. Chewed coca leaves found inside the eldest child's mouth upon her discovery in 1999 supports this theory.\nThe bodies of Inca emperors and wives were mummified after death. In 1533, the Spanish conquistadors of the Inca Empire viewed the mummies in the Inca capital of Cuzco. The mummies were displayed, often in lifelike positions, in the palaces of the deceased emperors and had a retinue of servants to care for them. The Spanish were impressed with the quality of the mummification which involved removal of the organs, embalming, and freeze-drying.\nThe population revered the mummies of the Inca emperors. This reverence seemed idolatry to the Roman Catholic Spanish and in 1550 they confiscated the mummies. The mummies were taken to Lima where they were displayed in the San Andres Hospital. The mummies deteriorated in the humid climate of Lima and eventually they were either buried or destroyed by the Spanish.\nAn attempt to find the mummies of the Inca emperors beneath the San Andres hospital in 2001 was unsuccessful. The archaeologists found a crypt, but it was empty. Possibly the mummies had been removed when the building was repaired after an earthquake.\nSelf-mummification.\nMonks whose bodies remain incorrupt without any traces of deliberate mummification are venerated by some Buddhists who believe they successfully were able to mortify their flesh to death. Self-mummification was practiced until the late 1800s in Japan and has been outlawed since the early 1900s.\nMany Mahayana Buddhist monks were reported to know their time of death and left their last testaments and their students accordingly buried them sitting in lotus position, put into a vessel with drying agents (such as wood, paper, or lime) and surrounded by bricks, to be exhumed later, usually after three years. The preserved bodies would then be decorated with paint and adorned with gold.\nBodies purported to be those of self-mummified monks are exhibited in several Japanese shrines, and it has been claimed that the monks, prior to their death, stuck to a sparse diet made up of salt, nuts, seeds, roots, pine bark, and tea.\nModern mummies.\nJeremy Bentham.\nIn the 1830s, Jeremy Bentham, the founder of utilitarianism, left instructions to be followed upon his death which led to the creation of a sort of modern-day mummy. He asked that his body be displayed to illustrate how the \"horror at dissection originates in ignorance\"; once so displayed and lectured about, he asked that his body parts be preserved, including his skeleton (minus his skull, which despite being mis-preserved, was displayed beneath his feet until theft required it to be stored elsewhere), which were to be dressed in the clothes he usually wore and \"seated in a Chair usually occupied by me when living in the attitude in which I am sitting when engaged in thought\". His body, outfitted with a wax head created because of problems preparing it as Bentham requested, is on open display in the University College London.\nVladimir Lenin.\nDuring the early 20th century, the Russian movement of Cosmism, as represented by Nikolai Fyodorovich Fyodorov, envisioned scientific resurrection of dead people. The idea was so popular that, after Vladimir Lenin's death, Leonid Krasin and Alexander Bogdanov suggested to cryonically preserve his body and brain in order to revive him in the future. Necessary equipment was purchased abroad, but for a variety of reasons the plan was not realized. Instead his body was embalmed and placed on permanent exhibition in the Lenin Mausoleum in Moscow, where it is displayed to this day. The mausoleum itself was modeled by Alexey Shchusev on the Pyramid of Djoser and the Tomb of Cyrus.\nGottfried Knoche.\nIn late 19th-century Venezuela, a German-born doctor named Gottfried Knoche conducted experiments in mummification at his laboratory in the forest near La Guaira. He developed an embalming fluid (based on an aluminium chloride compound) that mummified corpses without having to remove the internal organs. The formula for his fluid was never revealed and has not been discovered. Most of the several dozen mummies created with the fluid (including himself and his immediate family) have been lost or were severely damaged by vandals and looters.\nSummum.\nIn 1975, an esoteric organization by the name of Summum introduced \"Modern Mummification\", a service that utilizes modern techniques along with aspects of ancient methods of mummification. The first person to formally undergo Summum's process of modern mummification was the founder of Summum, Summum Bonum Amen Ra, who died in January 2008. Summum is currently considered to be the only \"commercial mummification business\" in the world.\nAlan Billis.\nIn 2010, a team led by forensic archaeologist Stephen Buckley mummified Alan Billis using techniques based on 19 years of research of 18th-dynasty Egyptian mummification. The process was filmed for television, for the documentary \"Mummifying Alan: Egypt's Last Secret\". Billis made the decision to allow his body to be mummified after being diagnosed with terminal cancer in 2009. His body currently resides at London's Gordon Museum.\nAm\u00e9lie of Leuchtenberg.\nAm\u00e9lie of Leuchtenberg (1812\u20131873) was Empress of Brazil as the wife of Emperor Pedro I (also King of Portugal as Pedro IV). Between February and September 2012, researchers at the University of S\u00e3o Paulo in Brazil exhumed her remains, as well as those of her husband and his first wife, Maria Leopoldina. They were surprised to find that the body of Am\u00e9lie had been mummified. Skin, hair and internal organs were preserved. Examinations at the Hospital das Cl\u00ednicas found an incision in the empress' jugular vein. Aromatics such as camphor and myrrh were injected into the incision during the embalming process. \"It certainly helped to nullify the decomposition\", said Brazilian forensic archaeologist Valdirene Ambiel, responsible for the research. She added that another contributing factor was the casket, saying it was so hermetically sealed that there were no micro-organisms in it. Before the reinterment, scientists reembalmed Am\u00e9lie's mummified body using a method similar to the first one.\nThe remains of Am\u00e9lie, Pedro I, and Maria Leopoldina are interred in the Monument to the Independence of Brazil in S\u00e3o Paulo.\nPlastination.\nPlastination is a technique used in anatomy to conserve bodies or body parts. The water and fat are replaced by certain plastics, yielding specimens that can be touched, do not smell or decay, and even retain most microscopic properties of the original sample.\nThe technique was invented by Gunther von Hagens when working at the anatomical institute of the Heidelberg University in 1978. Von Hagens has patented the technique in several countries and is heavily involved in its promotion, especially as the creator and director of the Body Worlds traveling exhibitions, exhibiting plastinated human bodies internationally. He also founded and directs the Institute for Plastination in Heidelberg.\nMore than 40 institutions worldwide have facilities for plastination, mainly for medical research and study, and most affiliated to the International Society for Plastination.\nTreatment of ancient mummies in modern times.\nIn the Middle Ages, based on a mistranslation from the Arabic term for bitumen, it was thought that mummies possessed healing properties. As a result, it became common practice to grind Egyptian mummies into a powder to be sold and used as medicine. Francis Bacon and Robert Boyle recommended them for healing bruises and preventing bleeding. \nWhen actual mummies became unavailable, the sun-desiccated corpses of criminals, slaves and people who committed suicide were substituted by some merchants. The trade in mummies seems to have been disapproved of by Turkish authorities who ruled Egypt \u2013 several Egyptians were imprisoned for boiling mummies to make oil in 1424. However, mummies were in high demand in Europe and it was possible to buy them for the right amount of money. John Snaderson, an English tradesman who visited Egypt in the 16th century shipped six hundred pounds of mummy back to England.\nThe practice developed into a wide-scale business that flourished until the late 16th century. As recently as two centuries ago, mummies were still believed to have medicinal properties to stop bleeding, and were sold as pharmaceuticals in powdered form as in mellified man. Artists also made use of Egyptian mummies; a brownish pigment known as mummy brown, based on \"mummia\" (sometimes called alternatively \"caput mortuum\", Latin for \"death's head\"), which was originally obtained by grinding human and animal Egyptian mummies. It was most popular in the 17th century, but was discontinued in the early 19th century when its composition became generally known to artists who replaced the said pigment by a totally different blend -but keeping the original name, mummia or mummy brown-yielding a similar tint and based on ground minerals (oxides and fired earths) and or blends of powdered gums and oleoresins (such as myrrh and frankincense) as well as ground bitumen. These blends appeared on the market as forgeries of powdered mummy pigment but were ultimately considered as acceptable replacements, once antique mummies were no longer permitted to be destroyed. In 1890, about 180,000 mummified cats were excavated and shipped from Egypt to England to be processed for use in fertilizer.\nDuring the 19th century, following the discovery of the first tombs and artifacts in Egypt, egyptology became popular in Europe, especially in Victorian England. European aristocrats would occasionally entertain themselves by purchasing mummies, having them unwrapped, and holding observation sessions. The pioneer of this kind of entertainment in Britain was Thomas Pettigrew known as \"Mummy\" Pettigrew due to his work. Such unrolling sessions destroyed hundreds of mummies, because the exposure to the air caused them to disintegrate.\nWhile mummies were used in medicine, some researchers have brought into question these other uses such as making paper and paint, fueling locomotives and fertilizing land. The use of mummies as fuel for locomotives was documented by Mark Twain, likely humorously, but the truth of the story remains debatable. During the American Civil War, mummy-wrapping linens were said to have been used to manufacture paper. Evidence for the reality of these claims is still equivocal. Researcher Ben Radford reports that, in her book \"The Mummy Congress\", Heather Pringle writes: \"No mummy expert has ever been able to authenticate the story ... Twain seems to be the only published source \u2013 and a rather suspect one at that\". Pringle also writes that there is no evidence for the \"mummy paper\" either. Radford says that many journalists have not done a good job with their research, and while it is true that mummies were often not shown respect in the 1800s, there is no evidence for this rumor.\nIn popular culture.\nA 2023 report by \"CNN\" revealed that a number of museums in Britain were rethinking how they described their displays of ancient Egyptian human remains, known as \"mummies\", in order to emphasize that these individuals were once living people. The museums started using terms such as \"mummified person\" or the individual's name instead of \"mummy\". The shift in language was also intended to distance the display of mummies from their depiction in popular culture, which often \"undermined their humanity\" by depicting them as supernatural monsters and perpetuating the notion of a \"mummy's curse\". The change in language is part of a larger effort by museums to address historical bias and reflect on the way they represent the past to audiences. The British Museum, for example, has not banned the use of the term \"mummy\" in its displays, but has started to use alternative terminology such as \"mummified remains\" and including the individual's name when known.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\nBooks.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nTV and video.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "20226", "revid": "16477971", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20226", "title": "Melilla", "text": "Spanish autonomous city on the north-west coast of Africa\nMelilla (, ; ) is an autonomous city of Spain on the North African coast. It lies on the eastern side of the Cape Three Forks, bordering Morocco and facing the Mediterranean Sea. It has an area of . It was part of the Province of M\u00e1laga until 14 March 1995, when the Statute of Autonomy of Melilla was passed.\nMelilla is one of the special territories of the member states of the European Union. Movements to and from the rest of the EU and Melilla are subject to specific rules, provided for \"inter alia\" in the Accession Agreement of Spain to the Schengen Convention.\nAs of 2019, Melilla had a population of 86,487. The population is chiefly divided between people of Iberian and Riffian extraction. There are also small numbers of Sephardic Jews and Sindhi Hindus. Melilla features a diglossia between the official Spanish and Tarifit.\nLike the autonomous city of Ceuta and Spain's other territories in Africa, Melilla is subject to an irredentist claim by Morocco.\nName.\nBorrowed from Spanish, the English name \"Melilla\" is pronounced or to approximate the sound of the Spanish double L, properly in most standard Spanish dialects. The name is attested from the 9th century, deriving from Arabic (, ) of uncertain etymology. The name has been related to honey (; ; , ) since Melilla was a notable site for beekeeping in antiquity, a bee appearing prominently on the city's bronze coinage under Mauretanian rule. Alternatively, it has been taken from words meaning \"discord\", \"fever\", or a medieval Arab figure. The placename perhaps comes from the Amazigh root M\u00b7L (meaning 'white'), producing the Amazigh \"mlilet\" and which results in the local () via /l/\u2192 [r] and /lt/ \u2192 [\u010d] changes.\nHistory.\nAntiquity and Middle Ages.\nMelilla was a Phoenician and later Punic trade establishment under variations of the name Rusadir (, r\u0161\u02bedr), taken from the Phoenician name of the nearby Cape Three Forks. After Carthage's defeat in the Punic Wars, the city fell under the control of the Roman client state Mauretania. After its annexation under Caligula, Claudius organized it as part of the province of Mauretania Tingitana. Pliny mentions it as a native hillfort and port (). It was made a Roman colony in AD 46, after which it was sometimes referenced as Flavia. Rusaddir was said to have once been the seat of a bishop, but there is no record of any bishop of the purported see and it is not included in the Catholic Church's list of modern titular sees.\nThe political history is similar to that of towns in the region of the Moroccan Rif and southern Spain. Melilla was progressively ruled by the Vandals, Byzantines, and the Visigoths. In the early 6th century, it was the main port of the Mauro-Roman Kingdom. After the Islamic conquest of North Africa, it fell under the Umayyads, Cordobans, Idrisids, Almoravids, Almohads, Marinids, and Wattasids.\nEarly Modern period.\nDuring the 15th century, the city declined, like most Mediterranean cities of the Kingdom of Fez, eclipsed by those on the Atlantic. After the Catholic Monarchs' conquest of the Nasrid Kingdom of Granada in 1492, their Secretary Hernando de Zafra gathered intelligence about the sorry state of the North African coast with territorial expansion in mind. He sent agents to investigate, and subsequently reported to the Catholic Monarchs that, as of 1494, locals had expelled the authority of the Sultan of Fez and had offered to pledge loyalty. While the 1494 Treaty of Tordesillas put Melilla and Cazaza, until then reserved to the Portuguese, under the sphere of Castile, the conquest of the city had to wait, delayed by the French occupation of Naples.\nThe Duke of Medina Sidonia, Juan Alfonso P\u00e9rez de Guzm\u00e1n, advocated seizing Melilla, to be headed by Pedro de Estopi\u00f1\u00e1n, and the Catholic Monarchs, Isabella I of Castile and Ferdinand II of Aragon, endorsed the initiative and provided the assistance of artillery officer Francisco Ram\u00edrez de Madrid. Melilla was occupied on 17 September 1497, virtually without violence as it was on the border between the Kingdom of Tlemcen and the Kingdom of Fez, and as a result had been fought over many times and left abandoned. No large-scale expansion into the Kingdom of Fez ensued, and, barring the enterprises of the Cardinal Cisneros along the Algerian coast in Mers El K\u00e9bir and Oran, and the rock of Badis in the territorial scope of the Kingdom of Fez, the Hispanic monarchy's imperial impetus was eventually directed elsewhere, to the Italian Wars against France, and, especially after 1519, to the newly discovered continent across the Atlantic.\nMelilla was initially jointly administered by the House of Medina Sidonia and the Crown, and a 1498 settlement required the former to station a 700-man garrison in Melilla and the latter to provide the city with a number of maraved\u00edes and wheat \"fanegas\". The Crown's interest in Melilla decreased during the reign of Charles V. During the 16th century, soldiers stationed in Melilla were badly remunerated, leading to many desertions. The Duke of Medina Sidonia relinquished responsibility over the garrison of the place on 7 June 1556.\nDuring the late 17th century, \nAlaouite sultan Ismail Ibn Sharif attempted to conquer the \"presidio\", taking the outer fortifications in the 1680s and further unsuccessfully besieging Melilla in the 1690s.\nOne Spanish officer reflected, \"an hour in Melilla, from the point of view of merit, was worth more than thirty years of service to Spain.\"\nLate Modern period.\nThe current limits of the Spanish territory around the Melilla fortress were fixed by treaties with Morocco in 1859, 1860, 1861, and 1894. In the late 19th century, as Spanish influence expanded in this area, the Crown authorized Melilla as the only centre of trade on the Rif coast between Tetuan and the Algerian border. The value of trade increased, with goat skins, eggs and beeswax the principal exports, and cotton goods, tea, sugar and candles the chief imports.\nMelilla's civil population in 1860 still amounted to only 375 estimated inhabitants. In a 1866 Hispano-Moroccan arrangement signed in Fes, both parties agreed to allow for the installment of a customs office near the border with Melilla, to be operated by Moroccan officials. The Treaty of Peace with Morocco that followed the 1859\u201360 War entailed the acquisition of a new perimeter for Melilla, bringing its area to that where the 12\u00a0km2 the autonomous city currently stands. Following the declaration of Melilla as a free port in 1863, the population began to increase, chiefly with Sephardi Jews fleeing from Tetouan who fostered trade in and out of the city. The first Jews from Tetouan probably arrived in 1864, and the first rabbi arrived in 1867 and began to operate the first synagogue, located in the Calle de San Miguel. Many Jews arrived fleeing from persecution in Morocco instigated by Roghi Bu Hamara. Following the 1868 lifting of the veto of emigration to Melilla from Peninsular Spain, the population further increased with Spaniards. The Jewish population, who also progressively acquired Spanish citizenship, increased to 572 in 1893. The economic opportunities created in Melilla henceforth favoured the installment of a Berber population.\nThe first body of local government was the \"junta de arbitrios\" created in 1879, in which the military enjoy preponderance. The Pol\u00edgono excepcional de Tiro, the first neighborhood outside the walled core (Melilla la Vieja), began construction in 1888.\nIn 1893, Riffian tribesmen launched the First Melillan campaign to try to conquer the city; the Spanish government sent 25,000 soldiers to defend it against them. The conflict was also known as the \"Margallo War\", after Spanish General Juan Garc\u00eda y Margallo, Governor of Melilla, who was killed in the battle. The new 1894 agreement with Morocco that followed the conflict increased trade with the hinterland, bringing the economic prosperity of the city to a new level. The total population of Melilla amounted to 10,004 inhabitants in 1896.\nThe turn of the new century saw attempts by France (based in French Algeria) to profit from their newly acquired sphere of influence in Morocco to counter Melilla's trading prowess by fostering trade links with the Algerian cities of Ghazaouet and Oran. Melilla began to suffer from this, to which the instability brought by revolts against Muley Abdel Aziz in the hinterland also added, although after 1905 Sultan pretender El Rogui (Bou Hmara) carried out a defusing policy in the area that favoured Spain. The French occupation of Oujda in 1907 compromised the Melillan trade with that city, and the enduring instability in the Rif still threatened Melilla. Between 1909 and 1945, the \"modernista\" (Art Nouveau) style was prevalent in local architecture, making Melilla's streets a \"true museum of \"modernista\"-style architecture\", second only to Barcelona, mainly stemming from the work of architect Enrique Nieto.\nMining companies began to enter the hinterland of Melilla by 1908. A Spanish company, the Compa\u00f1\u00eda Espa\u00f1ola de las Minas del Rif, was constituted in July 1908, shared by Clemente Fern\u00e1ndez, Enrique Macpherson, the Count of Romanones, the Duke of Tovar and Juan Antonio G\u00fcell, who appointed Miguel Villanueva as chairman. Thus two mining companies under the protection of Bou Hmara started mining lead and iron 20 kilometers (12.4 miles) from Melilla. They started to construct a railway between the port and the mines. In October of that year, Bou Hmara's vassals revolted against him and raided the mines, which remained closed until June 1909. By July the workmen were again attacked and several were killed. Severe fighting between the Spaniards and the tribesmen followed, in the Second Melillan campaign that took place in the vicinity of Melilla.\nIn 1910, the Spaniards restarted the mines and undertook harbor works at Mar Chica, but hostilities broke out again in 1911. On 22 July 1921, the Berbers under the leadership of Abd el Krim inflicted a grave defeat on the Spanish at the Battle of Annual. The Spanish retreated to Melilla, leaving most of the protectorate under the control of the Republic of the Rif.\nA royal decree pursuing the creation of an \"ayuntamiento\" in Melilla was signed on 13 December 1918 but the regulation did not come into force, and thus the existing government body, the , remained in force.\nA \"junta municipal\" with a rather civil composition was created in 1927; on 10 April 1930, an \"ayuntamiento\" featuring the same membership as the junta was created, equalling to the same municipal regime as the rest of Spain on 14 April 1931, with the arrival of the first democratically elected municipal corporation on the wake of the proclamation of the Second Republic.\nThe city was used as one of the staging grounds for the July 1936 military coup d'\u00e9tat that started the Spanish Civil War.\nIn the context of the passing of the Ley de Extranjer\u00eda in 1986, and following social mobilization from the Berber community, conditions for citizenship acquisition were flexibilised and allowed for the naturalisation of a substantial number of inhabitants, until then born in Melilla but without Spanish citizenship.\nAutonomy and late 20th, 21st century.\nIn 1995, Melilla \u2014until then just another municipality of M\u00e1laga\u2014 became an autonomous city, as their Statute of Autonomy was passed.\nOn 6 November 2007, King Juan Carlos and Queen Sof\u00eda visited Melilla and Ceuta, sparking enthusiasm from the local population and protests from the Moroccan government, which led to a brief diplomatic conflict. It was the first time a Spanish head of state had visited the two African exclaves since 1927.\nMelilla, together with Ceuta, declared the Muslim holiday of Eid al-Adha \u2014Feast of the Sacrifice\u2014 an official public holiday from 2010 onward. It is the first time a non-Christian religious festival has been officially celebrated in Spain since the Reconquista.\nIn 2018, Morocco decided to close the customs office near Melilla, the first time since mid-19th century, without any consultation with Spain. The customs office was expected to reopen in January 2023.\nAs of February 2025, trade was still tentative and limited.\nMelilla was the location of the last public statue in Spain to commemorate former dictator Francisco Franco following Spain's Historical Memory Law, passed in 2007, which included provision to the removal of any artefacts which celebrated the Franco regime from all public buildings and spaces. Nonetheless, the statue remained on the Cuesta de la Florentina street until its final removal in 2021.\nGeography.\nLocation.\nMelilla is in northwest Africa, on the shores of the Alboran Sea, a marginal sea of the Mediterranean, the latter's westernmost portion. The city is arranged in a wide semicircle around the beach and the Port of Melilla, on the eastern side of the peninsula of Cape Tres Forcas, at the foot of Mount Gurug\u00fa and around the mouth of the R\u00edo de Oro intermittent water stream, above sea level. The urban nucleus was originally a fortress, Melilla la Vieja, built on a peninsular mound about in height.\nThe Moroccan settlement of Beni Ansar lies immediately south of Melilla. The nearest Moroccan city is Nador, and the ports of Melilla and Nador are within the same bay; nearby is the Bou Areg Lagoon.\nClimate.\nMelilla has a hot Mediterranean climate on the border with a hot Semi-arid climate, influenced by its proximity to the sea, rendering much cooler summers and more precipitation than inland areas deeper into Africa. The climate, in general, is similar to the southern coast of peninsular Spain and the northern coast of Morocco, with relatively small temperature differences between seasons. Minimum temperatures have never been below during 1991-2020 period, and only 2.2 days per year have maximum temperature above .\nGovernment and administration.\nSelf-government institutions.\nThe government bodies stipulated in the Statute of Autonomy are the Assembly of Melilla, the President of Melilla and the Council of Government. The assembly is a 25-member body whose members are elected through universal suffrage every 4 years in closed party lists following the schedule of local elections at the national level. Its members are called \"local deputies\" but they rather enjoy the status of \"concejales\" (municipal councillors). Unlike regional legislatures (and akin to municipal councils), the assembly does not enjoy right of initiative for primary legislation.\nThe president of Melilla (who, often addressed as Mayor-President, also exerts the roles of Mayor, president of the Assembly, president of the Council of Government and representative of the city) is invested by the Assembly. After local elections, the president is invested through a qualified majority from among the leaders of the election lists, or, failing to achieve the former, the leader of the most voted list at the election is invested to the office. In case of a motion of no confidence the president can only be ousted with a qualified majority voting for an alternative assembly member.\nThe Council of Government is the traditional collegiate executive body for parliamentary systems. Unlike the municipal government boards in the standard \"ayuntamientos\", the members of the Council of Government (including the vice-presidents) do not need to be members of the assembly.\nMelilla is the city in Spain with the highest proportion of postal voting; vote buying (via mail-in ballots) is widely reported to be a common practice in the poor neighborhoods of Melilla. Court cases in this matter had involved the PP, the CPM and the PSOE.\nOn 15 June 2019, following the May 2019 Melilla Assembly election, the regionalist and left-leaning party of Muslim and Amazigh persuasion Coalition for Melilla (CPM, 8 seats), the Spanish Socialist Workers' Party (PSOE, 4 seats) and Citizens\u2013Party of the Citizenry (Cs, 1 seat) voted in favour of the Cs' candidate (Eduardo de Castro) as the Presidency of the Autonomous City, ousting Juan Jos\u00e9 Imbroda, from the People's Party (PP, 10 seats), who had been in office since 2000.\nMelilla also maintains a local police force known as Policia Local de Melilla (Ciudad Autonoma de Melilla - Policia Local).\nAdministrative subdivisions.\nMelilla is subdivided into eight districts (\"distritos\"), which are further subdivided into neighbourhoods (\"barrios\"):\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nEconomy.\nThe gross domestic product (GDP) of the autonomous community was 1.6 billion euros in 2018, accounting for 0.1% of Spanish economic output. GDP per capita adjusted for purchasing power was 19,900 euros or 66% of the EU27 average in the same year. Melilla was the NUTS2 region with the lowest GDP per capita in Spain.\nMelilla does not participate in the European Union Customs Union (EUCU). There is no VAT (IVA) tax, but a local reduced-rate tax called IPSI is rendered. Preserving the status of a free port, imports are free of tariffs and the only tax concerning them is the IPSI. However, exports to the Customs Union (including Peninsular Spain) are subject to the correspondent customs tariff and are taxed with the correspondent VAT. There are some special manufacturing taxes regarding electricity and transport, as well as complementary charges on tobacco and oil and fuel products.\nThe principal industry is fishing. Cross-border commerce (legal or smuggled) and Spanish and European grants and wages are the other income sources.\nMelilla is regularly connected to the Iberian peninsula by air and sea traffic. It is also economically connected to Morocco, as most of its fruit and vegetables are imported across the border. Moroccans in the city's hinterland are attracted to it, as 36,000 Moroccans cross the border daily to work, shop or trade goods. The port of Melilla offers several daily connections to Almer\u00eda and M\u00e1laga. Melilla Airport offers daily flights to Almer\u00eda, M\u00e1laga and Madrid. Air Europa and Iberia operate in Melilla's airport.\nMany people travelling between Europe and Morocco use the ferry links to Melilla, both for passengers and for freight. Because of this, the port and related companies form an important economic driver for the city.\nTourism.\nIn order to boost growth and as a measure to promote tourism in the Autonomous City of Melilla, the Tourist Board has developed a Regulatory Decree for bonuses for Tourist Packages to Melilla.\nThe Tourist Package consists of the application of discounts on return tickets by plane or boat provided that they include accommodation during the stay in Melilla in one of the types of tourist accommodations or at the home of a resident of the city and do not exceed, between the round trip dates, ten days.\nWater supply.\nMelilla's water supply primarily came from a network of dug wells (which by the turn of the 21st century suffered from overexploitation and had also experienced a degradation of the water quality and the intrusion of seawater), as well as the capture of the R\u00edo de Oro's underflow. Seeking to address the water supply problem, works for the construction of a desalination plant in the Aguad\u00fa cliffs, projected to produce a day, started in November 2003. The plant entered operation in March 2007. Its daily operation is partially funded by the central government. Relative to the Spanish average (and similarly to the Canary and Balearic Islands), the city's population spends a comparatively larger amount of money on bottled water.\nFunded by the European Regional Development Fund and the Confederaci\u00f3n Hidrogr\u00e1fica del Guadalquivir, works for the expansion of the plant's production capabilities up to a day started by September 2020.\nArchitecture.\nThe dome of the Chapel of Santiago, built in the mid-16th century by Miguel de Perea with help from Sancho de Escalante, is a rare instance of Gothic architecture in the African continent.\nParallel to the urban development of Melilla in the early 20th century, the new architectural style of \"modernismo\" (irradiated from Barcelona and associated to the bourgeois class) was imported to the city, granting it a \"modernista\" architectural character, primarily through the works of the prolific Catalan architect Enrique Nieto.\nAccordingly, Melilla has the second most important concentration of \"Modernista\" works in Spain after Barcelona, Mainly concentrated in the city's ensanche. Nieto was in charge of designing the main Synagogue, the Central Mosque and various Catholic Churches.\nDemographics.\nReligion.\nMelilla has been praised as an example of multiculturalism, being a small city in which one can find Christians, Muslims, Jews, Hindus, and Buddhists represented.\nJudaism.\nPercentagewise, Melilla may be the most Jewish city in Spain with around 1,000 Jews still living in the city, down from 7,000 around the year 1930, which is mainly due to economic reasons resulting in moving to the Spanish mainland, Israel or elsewhere. Melilla plays an important part in the history of Jews in Spain, having been exempt from the expulsion of Jews from Spain. The expelled Spanish Jews were Sephardic Jews and subsequently found a new home in neighboring Morocco, including Melilla. Especially during the second half of the 19th century, many of the expelled Sephardic Jews moved from northern Morocco to Melilla. The first ones were traders from the Moroccan cities who came for economic and safety reasons. Later, impoverished Jews from the rural Riffian areas joined, also because of safety reasons. Thus, Melilla's special geographical and political situation has made the city the oldest and one of the most important centers of Sephardic Judaism in today's Spain, traditional home of the Sephards.\nChristianity.\nAccording to the Spanish Center for Sociological Research, Roman Catholicism is the largest religion in Melilla. In 2019, the proportion of Melillans that identify themselves as Roman Catholic was 65.0% (31.7% define themselves as not practising, while 33.3% as practising). 30% identify as followers of other faiths, 2.7% identify as non-believers, and 2.3% identify as atheists.\nThe Roman Catholic churches in Melilla belong to the Diocese of M\u00e1laga.\nIslam.\nSome sources indicate that Muslims account for roughly half the population in Melilla, which is in conflict with the Spanish Center for Sociological Research reported numbers.\nHinduism.\nThere is a small, autonomous, and commercially important Hindu community present in Melilla, which has fallen over the past decades as its members move to the Spanish mainland. It numbers about 100 members today.\nLanguage.\nMelilla features a diglossia, with Spanish as the first and official language and Tarifit as the second language, with limited written codification, and usage restricted to family and domestic relations and oral speech.\nThe population can be thus divided into monolingual Spanish speakers of European ethnic origin (without competence in any other language than those formally taught at school); those descended from Tamazight-speaking parents, usually bilingual in Spanish and Tamazight; and Moroccan immigrants and cross-border workers, with a generally dominant Tamazight language (with some also competent in Arabic) and a L2 competence in Spanish. The Spanish spoken in Melilla is similar to the Andalusian variety from C\u00e1diz, whereas the Berber variant spoken in Melilla is the Tarifit, common with the neighbouring Nador area. Rather than Berber (), Berber speakers in Melilla use either the glotonym , or, in Spanish, for their language.\nThe first attempt to legislate a degree of recognition for Berber in Melilla was in 1994, in the context of the elaboration of the Statute of Autonomy, by mentioning the promotion of the linguistic and cultural pluralism (without explicitly mentioning the Berber language). The initiative went nowhere, voted down by PP and PSOE. Reasons cited for not recognizing Tamazight are related to the argument that the variety is not standardized.\nBorder security.\nDefence and Civil Guard.\nThe defence of the enclave is the responsibility of the Spanish Armed Forces' General Command of Melilla. The Spanish Army's combat components of the command include:\nThe command also includes its headquarters battalion as well as logistics elements.\nIn addition to the defence of Melilla, the garrison is also responsible for the defence of islands and rock formations claimed by Spain off the coast of Morocco. Units of the garrison are deployed to these rock formations to secure them against Moroccan incursions and did so notably during the Perejil Island crisis in 2002. To enhance coastal security, the Spanish Navy based a dedicated patrol boat (\"Isla Pinto\") in Melilla from mid-2023. Melilla itself is about distant from the main Spanish naval base at Rota on the Spanish mainland while the Spanish Air Force's Mor\u00f3n Air Base is within proximity.\nThe Civil Guard is responsible for border security and protects both the territory's fortified land border against frequent, and sometimes significant, migrant incursions.\nTrans-border relations.\nMelilla forms a sort of trans-border urban conurbation with limited integration together with the neighbouring Moroccan settlements, located at one of the ends of a linear succession of urban sprawl spanning southward in Morocco along the R19 road from Beni Ensar down to Nador and Selouane. The urban system features a high degree of hierarchization, specialization and division of labour, with Melilla as chief provider of services, finance and trade; Nador as an eminently industrial city whereas the rest of Moroccan settlements found themselves in a subordinate role, presenting agro-town features and operating as providers of workforce.\nThe asymmetry, as reflected for example in the provision of healthcare, has fostered situations such as the large-scale use of the Melillan health services by Moroccan citizens, with Melilla attending a number of urgencies more than four times the standard for its population in 2018. In order to satisfy the workforce needs of Melilla (mainly in areas such as domestic service, construction and cross-border bale workers, often under informal contracts), Moroccan inhabitants of the province of Nador were granted exemptions from visa requirements to enter the autonomous city. This development in turn induced a strong flux of internal migration from other Moroccan provinces to Nador, in order to acquire the aforementioned exemption.\nThe 'fluid' trans-border relations between Melilla and its surroundings are however not free from conflict, as they are contingent upon the 'tense' trans-national relations between Morocco and Spain.\nBorder securitization.\nFollowing the increasing influx of Algerian and sub-Saharan irregular migrants into Ceuta and Melilla in the early 1990s, a process of border fortification in both cities ensued after 1995 to reduce the border's permeability, a target attained to some degree by 1999, although peak level of fortification was reached in 2005.\nMelilla's border with Morocco is secured by the Melilla border fence, a tall double fence with watch towers; yet migrants (in groups of tens or sometimes hundreds) storm the fence and manage to cross it from time to time. Since 2005, at least 14 migrants have died trying to cross the fence. The Melilla migrant reception centre was built with a capacity of 480. In 2020 works to remove the barbed wire from the top of the fence (meanwhile raising its height up to more than in the stretches most susceptible to breaches) were commissioned to Tragsa.\nIn June 2022, at least 23 sub-Saharan migrants and two Moroccan security personnel were killed when around 2,000 migrants stormed the border. The death toll has been estimated to be as high as 37 by certain NGOs. Around 200 Spanish and Moroccan law enforcement officers and at least 76 migrants were injured. Hundreds of migrants succeeded in breaching the fence, and 133 made it across the border. Widely circulated footage showed dozens of motionless migrants piled together. It was the worst such incident in Melilla's history. The United Nations, the African Union and a number of human rights groups condemned what they deemed excessive force used by Moroccan and Spanish border guards, although no lethal weapons were employed, and the deaths were later attributed to \"mechanical asphyxiation\".\nMorocco has been paid tens of million euros by both Spain and the European Union to outsource the EU migration control. Besides the double fence in the Spanish side of the border, there is an additional high fence entirely made of razor wire lying on the Moroccan side as well as a moat in between.\nTransportation.\nMelilla Airport is serviced by Air Nostrum, flying to the Spanish cities of M\u00e1laga, Madrid, Barcelona, Las Palmas de Gran Canaria, Palma de Mallorca, Granada, Badajoz, Sevilla and Almer\u00eda. In April 2013, a local enterprise set up Melilla Airlines, flying from the city to M\u00e1laga. The city is linked to M\u00e1laga, Almer\u00eda and Motril by ferry.\nThree roads connect Melilla and Morocco but require clearance through border checkpoints.\nSport.\nMelilla is a surfing destination. The city's football club, UD Melilla, plays in the third tier of Spanish football, the Segunda Divisi\u00f3n B. The club was founded in 1943 and since 1945 have played at the 12,000-seater Estadio Municipal \u00c1lvarez Claro. Until the other club was dissolved in 2012, UD Melilla played the Ceuta-Melilla derby against AD Ceuta. The clubs travelled to each other via the Spanish mainland to avoid entering Morocco. The second-highest ranked club in the city are Casino del Real CF of the fourth-tier Tercera Divisi\u00f3n. The football's governing institution is the Melilla Football Federation.\nDispute with Morocco.\nThe Moroccan government has repeatedly called for Spain to transfer the sovereignty of Melilla, Ceuta and the \"plazas de soberan\u00eda\" to Morocco, with Spain's refusal to do so serving as a major source of tension in Morocco\u2013Spain relations. In Morocco, Ceuta is frequently referred to as the \"occupied Sebtah\", and the Moroccan government has argued that the city, along with other Spanish territories in the region, are colonies. One of the major arguments used by Morocco in their attempts to acquire sovereignty over Melilla refers to the geographical position of the city, as Melilla is an exclave surrounded by Moroccan territory and the Mediterranean Sea and has no territorial continuity with the rest of Spain. This argument was originally developed by one of the founders of the Moroccan Istiqlal Party, Alal-El Faasi, who openly advocated for Morocco to invade and occupy Melilla and other North African territories under Spanish rule. Spain, in line with the majority of nations in the rest of the world, has never recognized Morocco's claim over Melilla. The official position of the Spanish government is that Melilla is an integral part of Spain, and has been since the 16th century, centuries prior to Morocco's independence from Spain and France in 1956. The majority of Melilla's population support continued Spanish sovereignty and are opposed to Moroccan control over the territory.\nIn 1986, Spain joined NATO. However, Melilla is not under NATO protection since Article 6 of the North Atlantic Treaty limits such coverage to Europe and North America and islands north of the Tropic of Cancer. However, French Algeria was explicitly included in the treaty upon France's entry. Legal experts have claimed that other articles of the treaty could cover Spanish territories in North Africa but this interpretation has not been tested in practice. During the 2022 Madrid summit, the issue of the protection of Melilla was raised by Spain, with NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg stating: \"On which territories NATO protects and Ceuta and Melilla, NATO is there to protect all Allies against any threats. At the end of the day, it will always be a political decision to invoke Article 5, but rest assured NATO is there to protect and defend all Allies\". On 21 December 2020, following statements made by Moroccan Prime Minister Saadeddine Othmani that Melilla is \"Moroccan as the Sahara\", the Spanish government summoned the Moroccan ambassador, Karima Benyaich, to convey that Spain expects all its partners to respect the sovereignty and territorial integrity of its territory in Africa and asked for an explanation for Othmani's words.\nTwin towns \u2013 sister cities.\nMelilla is twinned with:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Made with durum wheat, macaroni is commonly cut in short lengths; curved macaroni may be referred to as \"elbow macaroni\". Some home machines can make macaroni shapes but, like most pasta, macaroni is usually made commercially by large-scale extrusion. The common curved shape is created by different speeds of extrusion on opposite sides of the pasta tube as it comes out of the machine.\nThe word \"macaroni\" is often used synonymously with elbow-shaped macaroni, as it is the variety most often used in macaroni and cheese recipes. In Italy and other countries, the noun \"maccheroni\" can refer to straight, tubular, square-ended \"pasta corta\" (lit.\u2009'short pasta') or to long pasta dishes, as in \"maccheroni alla chitarra\", which is prepared with long pasta such as spaghetti. In the United States, federal regulations define three shapes of dried pasta (macaroni, spaghetti, and vermicelli) as falling under the label of \"macaroni product\".\nEtymology.\nIn Italian, \"maccheroni\" refers to elongated pasta, not necessarily in tubular form. This general meaning is still retained outside Rome and in different languages which borrowed the word.\n\"Maccheroni\" comes from Italian \"maccheroni\" (), plural form of \"maccherone\". The academic consensus supports the position that the word is derived from the Greek \u03bc\u03b1\u03ba\u03b1\u03c1\u03af\u03b1 (\"makar\u00eda\"), In turn, that comes from \u03bc\u03ac\u03ba\u03b1\u03c1\u03b5\u03c2 (\"m\u00e1kares\"), meaning the 'blessed ones, blessed dead', the plural of \u03bc\u03ac\u03ba\u03b1\u03c1 (\"m\u00e1kar\"), which means 'blessed, happy'; \u03bc\u03b1\u03ba\u03ac\u03c1\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2 (\"mak\u00e1rios\", from \u03bc\u03ac\u03ba\u03b1\u03c1 (m\u00e1kar) + -\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2 (-\"ios\", adjective suffix)) and \u039c\u03b1\u03ba\u03ac\u03c1\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2 (\"Mak\u00e1rios\"), 'Makarios' (Latinized form: Macarius), are derived terms. The many varieties sometimes differ from each other because of the texture of each pasta: rigatoni and \"tortiglioni\", for example, have ridges down their lengths, while \"chifferi\", \"lumache\", \"lumaconi\", \"pipe\", \"pipette\", etc. refer to elbow-shaped pasta similar to macaroni in North American culture.\nHowever, the Italian linguist G. Alessio argues that the word can have two origins. The first is the Medieval Greek \u03bc\u03b1\u03ba\u03b1\u03c1\u03ce\u03bd\u03b5\u03b9\u03b1 (\"makar\u1e53neia\"), 'dirge' (stated in sec. XIII by James of Bulgaria), which would mean 'funeral meal' and then 'food to serve' during this office (see modern Eastern Thrace's \u03bc\u03b1\u03c7\u03b1\u03c1\u03c9\u03bd\u03b9\u03ac (\"makhar\u014dni\u00e1\")\u2014\"machar\u014dnia\" in the sense of 'rice-based dish served at the funeral'), in which case, the term would be composed of the double root of \u03bc\u03b1\u03ba\u03ac\u03c1\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2 (\"mak\u00e1rios\"), 'blessed', and \u03b1\u1f30\u03c9\u03bd\u03af\u03c9\u03c2 (\"ai\u014dn\u00ed\u014ds\"), 'eternally'. The second is the Greek \u03bc\u03b1\u03ba\u03b1\u03c1\u03af\u03b1 (\"makar\u00eda\"), 'barley broth', which would have added the suffix \"-one\".\nIn his book \"Delizia! The Epic History of Italians and their Food\" (2007), John Dickie instead says that the word macaroni, and its earlier variants such as \"maccheroni\", \"comes from \"maccare\", meaning to pound or crush\".\nThe word first appears in English as \"makerouns\" in the 1390 \"The Forme of Cury\", which records the earliest recipe for macaroni and cheese.\nOutside Italy.\nAs is the case with dishes made with other types of pasta, macaroni and cheese is a popular dish and is often made with elbow macaroni. This is called macaroni cheese in the United Kingdom. A similar dish, \u00c4lplermagronen, with a base of cream and cheese originated in Switzerland in the 19th century. In Great Britain, particularly Scotland, macaroni cheese is a popular filling for pies, often consumed as a takeaway food or at football grounds. A sweet macaroni, known as macaroni pudding, containing milk and sugar (and rather similar to a rice pudding), was also popular with the British during the Victorian era. A popular canned variety is still manufactured by Ambrosia and sold in UK supermarkets.\nIn areas with large populations open to Western cultural influence such as Hong Kong, Macao, Malaysia, and Singapore, the local Chinese have adopted macaroni as an ingredient for Chinese-style Western cuisine. In Hong Kong's \"cha chaan teng\" ('tea restaurants') and Southeast Asia's \"kopi tiam\" ('coffee shops'), macaroni is cooked in water and then rinsed to remove starch, and served in clear broth with ham or frankfurter sausages, peas, black mushrooms, and optionally eggs, reminiscent of noodle soup dishes. This is often a course for breakfast or light lunch fare. Macaroni has also been incorporated into Malay Malaysian cuisine, where it is stir-fried akin to mee goreng using Asian seasoning similar to said noodle dish (i.e. shallots, oyster sauce, and chili paste).\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

This pre-mRNA usually still contains introns, regions that will not go on to code for the final amino acid sequence. These are removed in the process of RNA splicing, leaving only exons, regions that will encode the protein. This exon sequence constitutes mature mRNA. Mature mRNA is then read by the ribosome, and the ribosome creates the protein utilizing amino acids carried by transfer RNA (tRNA). This process is known as translation. All of these processes form part of the central dogma of molecular biology, which describes the flow of genetic information in a biological system.\nAs in DNA, genetic information in mRNA is contained in the sequence of nucleotides, which are arranged into codons consisting of three ribonucleotides each. Each codon codes for a specific amino acid, except the stop codons, which terminate protein synthesis. The translation of codons into amino acids requires two other types of RNA: transfer RNA, which recognizes the codon and provides the corresponding amino acid, and ribosomal RNA (rRNA), the central component of the ribosome's protein-manufacturing machinery.\nThe concept of mRNA was developed by Sydney Brenner and Francis Crick in 1960 during a conversation with Fran\u00e7ois Jacob. In 1961, mRNA was identified and described independently by one team consisting of Brenner, Jacob, and Matthew Meselson, and another team led by James Watson. While analyzing the data in preparation for publication, Jacob and Jacques Monod coined the name \"messenger RNA\".\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:TOC limit/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSynthesis.\nThe brief existence of an mRNA molecule begins with transcription, and ultimately ends in degradation. During its life, an mRNA molecule may also be processed, edited, and transported prior to translation. Eukaryotic mRNA molecules often require extensive processing and transport, while prokaryotic mRNA molecules do not. A molecule of eukaryotic mRNA and the proteins surrounding it are together called a messenger RNP.\nTranscription.\nTranscription is when RNA is copied from DNA in the nucleus. During transcription, RNA polymerase makes a copy of a gene from the DNA to mRNA as needed. This process differs slightly in eukaryotes and prokaryotes. One notable difference is that prokaryotic RNA polymerase associates with DNA-processing enzymes during transcription so that processing can proceed during transcription. Therefore, this causes the new mRNA strand to become double stranded by producing a complementary strand known as the tRNA strand, which when combined are unable to form structures from base-pairing. Moreover, the template for mRNA is the complementary strand of tRNA, which is identical in sequence to the anticodon sequence that the DNA binds to. The short-lived, unprocessed or partially processed product is termed \"precursor mRNA\", or \"pre-mRNA\"; once completely processed, it is termed \"mature mRNA\".\nUracil substitution for thymine.\nmRNA uses uracil (U) instead of thymine (T) in DNA. uracil (U) is the complementary base to adenine (A) during transcription instead of thymine (T). Thus, when using a template strand of DNA to build RNA, thymine is replaced with uracil. This substitution allows the mRNA to carry the appropriate genetic information from DNA to the ribosome for translation. Regarding the natural history, uracil came first then thymine; evidence suggests that RNA came before DNA in evolution. The RNA World hypothesis proposes that life began with RNA molecules, before the emergence of DNA genomes and coded proteins. In DNA, the evolutionary substitution of thymine for uracil may have increased DNA stability and improved the efficiency of DNA replication.\nEukaryotic pre-mRNA processing.\nProcessing of mRNA differs greatly among eukaryotes, bacteria, and archaea. Non-eukaryotic mRNA is, in essence, mature upon transcription and requires no processing, except in rare cases. Eukaryotic pre-mRNA, however, requires several processing steps before its transport to the cytoplasm and its translation by the ribosome.\nSplicing.\nThe extensive processing of eukaryotic pre-mRNA that leads to the mature mRNA is the RNA splicing, a mechanism by which introns or outrons (non-coding regions) are removed and exons (coding regions) are joined.\n5' cap addition.\nA \"5' cap\" (also termed an RNA cap, an RNA 7-methylguanosine cap, or an RNA m7G cap) is a modified guanine nucleotide that has been added to the \"front\" or 5' end of a eukaryotic messenger RNA shortly after the start of transcription. The 5' cap consists of a terminal 7-methylguanosine residue that is linked through a 5'-5'-triphosphate bond to the first transcribed nucleotide. Its presence is critical for recognition by the ribosome and protection from RNases.\nCap addition is coupled to transcription, and occurs co-transcriptionally, such that each influences the other. Shortly after the start of transcription, the 5' end of the mRNA being synthesized is bound by a cap-synthesizing complex associated with RNA polymerase. This enzymatic complex catalyzes the chemical reactions that are required for mRNA capping. Synthesis proceeds as a multi-step biochemical reaction.\nEditing.\nIn some instances, an mRNA will be edited, changing the nucleotide composition of that mRNA. An example in humans is the apolipoprotein B mRNA, which is edited in some tissues, but not others. The editing creates an early stop codon, which, upon translation, produces a shorter protein. Another well-defined example is A-to-I (adenosine to inosine) editing, which is carried out by double-strand specific adenosine-to inosine editing (ADAR) enzymes. This can occur in both the open reading frame and untranslated regions, altering the structural properties of the mRNA. Although essential for development, the exact role of this editing is not fully understood \nPolyadenylation.\nPolyadenylation is the covalent linkage of a polyadenylyl moiety to a messenger RNA molecule. In eukaryotic organisms most messenger RNA (mRNA) molecules are polyadenylated at the 3' end, but recent studies have shown that short stretches of uridine (oligouridylation) are also common. The poly(A) tail and the protein bound to it aid in protecting mRNA from degradation by exonucleases. Polyadenylation is also important for transcription termination, export of the mRNA from the nucleus, and translation. mRNA can also be polyadenylated in prokaryotic organisms, where poly(A) tails act to facilitate, rather than impede, exonucleolytic degradation.\nPolyadenylation occurs during and/or immediately after transcription of DNA into RNA. After transcription has been terminated, the mRNA chain is cleaved through the action of an endonuclease complex associated with RNA polymerase. After the mRNA has been cleaved, around 250 adenosine residues are added to the free 3' end at the cleavage site. This reaction is catalyzed by polyadenylate polymerase. Just as in alternative splicing, there can be more than one polyadenylation variant of an mRNA.\nPolyadenylation site mutations also occur. The primary RNA transcript of a gene is cleaved at the poly-A addition site, and 100\u2013200 A's are added to the 3' end of the RNA. If this site is altered, an abnormally long and unstable mRNA construct will be formed.\nTransport.\nAnother difference between eukaryotes and prokaryotes is mRNA transport. Because eukaryotic transcription and translation is compartmentally separated, eukaryotic mRNAs must be exported from the nucleus to the cytoplasm\u2014a process that may be regulated by different signaling pathways. Mature mRNAs are recognized by their processed modifications and then exported through the nuclear pore by binding to the cap-binding proteins CBP20 and CBP80, as well as the transcription/export complex (TREX). Multiple mRNA export pathways have been identified in eukaryotes.\nIn spatially complex cells, some mRNAs are transported to particular subcellular destinations. In mature neurons, certain mRNA are transported from the soma to dendrites. One site of mRNA translation is at polyribosomes selectively localized beneath synapses. The mRNA for Arc/Arg3.1 is induced by synaptic activity and localizes selectively near active synapses based on signals generated by NMDA receptors. Other mRNAs also move into dendrites in response to external stimuli, such as \u03b2-actin mRNA. For export from the nucleus, actin mRNA associates with ZBP1 and later with 40S subunit. The complex is bound by a motor protein and is transported to the target location (neurite extension) along the cytoskeleton. Eventually ZBP1 is phosphorylated by Src in order for translation to be initiated. In developing neurons, mRNAs are also transported into growing axons and especially growth cones. Many mRNAs are marked with so-called \"zip codes\", which target their transport to a specific location. mRNAs can also transfer between mammalian cells through structures called tunneling nanotubes.\nTranslation.\nBecause prokaryotic mRNA does not need to be processed or transported, translation by the ribosome can begin immediately after the end of transcription. Therefore, it can be said that prokaryotic translation is \"coupled\" to transcription and occurs \"co-transcriptionally\".\nEukaryotic mRNA that has been processed and transported to the cytoplasm (i.e., mature mRNA) can then be translated by the ribosome. Translation may occur at ribosomes free-floating in the cytoplasm, or directed to the endoplasmic reticulum by the signal recognition particle. Therefore, unlike in prokaryotes, eukaryotic translation \"is not\" directly coupled to transcription. It is even possible in some contexts that reduced mRNA levels are accompanied by increased protein levels, as has been observed for mRNA/protein levels of EEF1A1 in breast cancer.\nStructure.\nCoding regions.\nCoding regions are composed of codons, which are decoded and translated into proteins by the ribosome; in eukaryotes usually into one and in prokaryotes usually into several. Coding regions begin with the start codon and end with a stop codon. In general, the start codon is an AUG triplet and the stop codon is UAG (\"amber\"), UAA (\"ochre\"), or UGA (\"opal\"). The coding regions tend to be stabilised by internal base pairs; this impedes degradation. In addition to being protein-coding, portions of coding regions may serve as regulatory sequences in the pre-mRNA as exonic splicing enhancers or exonic splicing silencers.\nUntranslated regions.\nUntranslated regions (UTRs) are sections of the mRNA before the start codon and after the stop codon that are not translated, termed the five prime untranslated region (5' UTR) and three prime untranslated region (3' UTR), respectively. These regions are transcribed with the coding region and thus are exonic as they are present in the mature mRNA. Several roles in gene expression have been attributed to the untranslated regions, including mRNA stability, mRNA localization, and translational efficiency. The ability of a UTR to perform these functions depends on the sequence of the UTR and can differ between mRNAs. Genetic variants in 3' UTR have also been implicated in disease susceptibility because of the change in RNA structure and protein translation.\nThe stability of mRNAs may be controlled by the 5' UTR and/or 3' UTR due to varying affinity for RNA degrading enzymes called ribonucleases and for ancillary proteins that can promote or inhibit RNA degradation. (See also, C-rich stability element.)\nTranslational efficiency, including sometimes the complete inhibition of translation, can be controlled by UTRs. Proteins that bind to either the 3' or 5' UTR may affect translation by influencing the ribosome's ability to bind to the mRNA. MicroRNAs bound to the 3' UTR also may affect translational efficiency or mRNA stability.\nCytoplasmic localization of mRNA is thought to be a function of the 3' UTR. Proteins that are needed in a particular region of the cell can also be translated there; in such a case, the 3' UTR may contain sequences that allow the transcript to be localized to this region for translation.\nSome of the elements contained in untranslated regions form a characteristic secondary structure when transcribed into RNA. These structural mRNA elements are involved in regulating the mRNA. Some, such as the SECIS element, are targets for proteins to bind. One class of mRNA element, the riboswitches, directly bind small molecules, changing their fold to modify levels of transcription or translation. In these cases, the mRNA regulates itself.\nPoly(A) tail.\nThe 3' poly(A) tail is a long sequence of adenine nucleotides (often several hundred) added to the 3' end of the pre-mRNA. This tail promotes export from the nucleus and translation, and protects the mRNA from degradation.\nMonocistronic versus polycistronic mRNA.\nAn mRNA molecule is said to be monocistronic when it contains the genetic information to translate only a single protein chain (polypeptide). This is the case for most of the eukaryotic mRNAs. On the other hand, polycistronic mRNA carries several open reading frames (ORFs), each of which is translated into a polypeptide. These polypeptides usually have a related function (they often are the subunits composing a final complex protein) and their coding sequence is grouped and regulated together in a regulatory region, containing a promoter and an operator. Most of the mRNA found in bacteria and archaea is polycistronic, as is the human mitochondrial genome. Dicistronic or bicistronic mRNA encodes only two proteins.\nmRNA circularization.\nIn eukaryotes mRNA molecules form circular structures due to an interaction between the eIF4E and poly(A)-binding protein, which both bind to eIF4G, forming an mRNA-protein-mRNA bridge. Circularization is thought to promote cycling of ribosomes on the mRNA leading to time-efficient translation, and may also function to ensure only intact mRNA are translated (partially degraded mRNA characteristically have no m7G cap, or no poly-A tail).\nOther mechanisms for circularization exist, particularly in virus mRNA. Poliovirus mRNA uses a cloverleaf section towards its 5' end to bind PCBP2, which binds poly(A)-binding protein, forming the familiar mRNA-protein-mRNA circle. Barley yellow dwarf virus has binding between mRNA segments on its 5' end and 3' end (called kissing stem loops), circularizing the mRNA without any proteins involved.\nRNA virus genomes (the + strands of which are translated as mRNA) are also commonly circularized. During genome replication the circularization acts to enhance genome replication speeds, cycling viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase much the same as the ribosome is hypothesized to cycle.\nDegradation.\nDifferent mRNAs within the same cell have distinct lifetimes (stabilities). In bacterial cells, individual mRNAs can survive from seconds to more than an hour. However, the lifetime averages between 1 and 3 minutes, making bacterial mRNA much less stable than eukaryotic mRNA. In mammalian cells, mRNA lifetimes range from several minutes to days. The greater the stability of an mRNA the more protein may be produced from that mRNA. The limited lifetime of mRNA enables a cell to alter protein synthesis rapidly in response to its changing needs. There are many mechanisms that lead to the destruction of an mRNA, some of which are described below.\nProkaryotic mRNA degradation.\nIn general, in prokaryotes the lifetime of mRNA is much shorter than in eukaryotes. Prokaryotes degrade messages by using a combination of ribonucleases, including endonucleases, 3' exonucleases, and 5' exonucleases. In some instances, small RNA molecules (sRNA) tens to hundreds of nucleotides long can stimulate the degradation of specific mRNAs by base-pairing with complementary sequences and facilitating ribonuclease cleavage by RNase III. It was recently shown that bacteria also have a sort of 5' cap consisting of a triphosphate on the 5' end. Removal of two of the phosphates leaves a 5' monophosphate, causing the message to be destroyed by the exonuclease RNase J, which degrades 5' to 3'.\nEukaryotic mRNA turnover.\nInside eukaryotic cells, there is a balance between the processes of translation and mRNA decay. Messages that are being actively translated are bound by ribosomes, the eukaryotic initiation factors eIF-4E and eIF-4G, and poly(A)-binding protein. eIF-4E and eIF-4G block the decapping enzyme (DCP2), and poly(A)-binding protein blocks the exosome complex, protecting the ends of the message. The balance between translation and decay is reflected in the size and abundance of cytoplasmic structures known as P-bodies. The poly(A) tail of the mRNA is shortened by specialized exonucleases that are targeted to specific messenger RNAs by a combination of cis-regulatory sequences on the RNA and trans-acting RNA-binding proteins. Poly(A) tail removal is thought to disrupt the circular structure of the message and destabilize the cap binding complex. The message is then subject to degradation by either the exosome complex or the decapping complex. In this way, translationally inactive messages can be destroyed quickly, while active messages remain intact. The mechanism by which translation stops and the message is handed-off to decay complexes is not understood in detail. The majority of mRNA decay was believed to be cytoplasmic; however, recently, a novel mRNA decay pathway was described, which starts in the nucleus.\nAU-rich element decay.\nThe presence of AU-rich elements in some mammalian mRNAs tends to destabilize those transcripts through the action of cellular proteins that bind these sequences and stimulate poly(A) tail removal. Loss of the poly(A) tail is thought to promote mRNA degradation by facilitating attack by both the exosome complex and the decapping complex. Rapid mRNA degradation via AU-rich elements is a critical mechanism for preventing the overproduction of potent cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF). AU-rich elements also regulate the biosynthesis of proto-oncogenic transcription factors like c-Jun and c-Fos.\nNonsense-mediated decay.\nEukaryotic messages are subject to surveillance by nonsense-mediated decay (NMD), which checks for the presence of premature stop codons (nonsense codons) in the message. These can arise via incomplete splicing, V(D)J recombination in the adaptive immune system, mutations in DNA, transcription errors, leaky scanning by the ribosome causing a frame shift, and other causes. Detection of a premature stop codon triggers mRNA degradation by 5' decapping, 3' poly(A) tail removal, or endonucleolytic cleavage.\nSmall interfering RNA (siRNA).\nIn metazoans, small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) processed by Dicer are incorporated into a complex known as the RNA-induced silencing complex or RISC. This complex contains an endonuclease that cleaves perfectly complementary messages to which the siRNA binds. The resulting mRNA fragments are then destroyed by exonucleases. siRNA is commonly used in laboratories to block the function of genes in cell culture. It is thought to be part of the innate immune system as a defense against double-stranded RNA viruses.\nMicroRNA (miRNA).\nMicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small RNAs that typically are partially complementary to sequences in metazoan messenger RNAs. Binding of a miRNA to a message can repress translation of that message and accelerate poly(A) tail removal, thereby hastening mRNA degradation. The mechanism of action of miRNAs is the subject of active research.\nOther decay mechanisms.\nThere are other ways by which messages can be degraded, including non-stop decay and silencing by Piwi-interacting RNA (piRNA), among others.\nApplications.\nThe administration of a nucleoside-modified messenger RNA sequence can cause a cell to make a protein, which in turn could directly treat a disease or could function as a vaccine; more indirectly the protein could drive an endogenous stem cell to differentiate in a desired way.\nThe primary challenges of RNA therapy center on delivering the RNA to the appropriate cells. Challenges include the fact that naked RNA sequences naturally degrade after preparation; they may trigger the body's immune system to attack them as an invader; and they are impermeable to the cell membrane. Once within the cell, they must then leave the cell's transport mechanism to take action within the cytoplasm, which houses the necessary ribosomes.\nOvercoming these challenges, mRNA as a therapeutic was first put forward in 1989 \"after the development of a broadly applicable in vitro transfection technique.\" In the 1990s, mRNA vaccines for personalized cancer have been developed, relying on non-nucleoside modified mRNA. mRNA based therapies continue to be investigated as a method of treatment or therapy for both cancer as well as auto-immune, metabolic, and respiratory inflammatory diseases. Gene editing therapies such as CRISPR may also benefit from using mRNA to induce cells to make the desired Cas protein.\nSince the 2010s, RNA vaccines and other RNA therapeutics have been considered to be \"a new class of drugs\". The first mRNA-based vaccines received restricted authorization and were rolled out across the world during the COVID-19 pandemic by Pfizer\u2013BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine and Moderna, for example.\nThe 2023 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine was awarded to Katalin Karik\u00f3 and Drew Weissman for the development of effective mRNA vaccines against COVID-19. New approaches to modulate RNA levels as a therapeutics include the use of antisense oligonucleotides, including for neurodevelopment diseases associated with high mortality.\nHistory.\nSeveral molecular biology studies during the 1950s indicated that RNA played some kind of role in protein synthesis, but that role was not clearly understood. For instance, in one of the earliest reports, Jacques Monod and his team showed that RNA synthesis was necessary for protein synthesis, specifically during the production of the enzyme \u03b2-galactosidase in the bacterium \"E. coli\". Arthur Pardee also found similar RNA accumulation in 1954\".\" In 1953, Alfred Hershey, June Dixon, and Martha Chase described a certain cytosine-containing DNA (indicating it was RNA) that disappeared quickly after its synthesis in \"E. coli\". In hindsight, this may have been one of the first observations of the existence of mRNA but it was not recognized at the time as such.\nThe idea of mRNA was first conceived by Sydney Brenner and Francis Crick on 15 April 1960 at King's College, Cambridge, while Fran\u00e7ois Jacob was telling them about a recent experiment conducted by Arthur Pardee, himself, and Monod (the so-called PaJaMo experiment, which did not prove mRNA existed but suggested the possibility of its existence). With Crick's encouragement, Brenner and Jacob immediately set out to test this new hypothesis, and they contacted Matthew Meselson at the California Institute of Technology for assistance. During the summer of 1960, Brenner, Jacob, and Meselson conducted an experiment in Meselson's laboratory at Caltech which was the first to prove the existence of mRNA. That fall, Jacob and Monod coined the name \"messenger RNA\" and developed the first theoretical framework to explain its function.\nIn February 1961, James Watson revealed that his Harvard-based research group had been right behind them with a series of experiments whose results pointed in roughly the same direction. Brenner and the others agreed to Watson's request to delay publication of their research findings. As a result, the Brenner and Watson articles were published simultaneously in the same issue of \"Nature\" in May 1961, while that same month, Jacob and Monod published their theoretical framework for mRNA in the \"Journal of Molecular Biology\".\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Mount Saint Vincent offers undergraduate Arts, Science, Education, and Professional Studies undergraduate programs. The Mount has 13 graduate degrees in Applied Human Nutrition, School Psychology, Child and Youth Study, Education, Family Studies and Gerontology, Public Relations and Women's Studies. The Mount offers a doctorate program and a Ph.D. in Educational Studies through a joint initiative with St. Francis Xavier University and Acadia University. The Mount offers over 190 courses, ten undergraduate degree programs, and four online graduate degree programs.\nThe university attracts many students partly because of its small class sizes, specialty programs, and location. The Mount has Canada Research Chairs in Gender Identity and Social Practices as well as Food Security and Policy Change. This institution is unique nationwide as it has a Chair in learning disabilities, a Master of Public Relations program, a Bachelor of Science in Communication Studies, and numerous other programs, faculty, and research initiatives.\nHistory.\nEstablished by the Sisters of Charity of Saint Vincent de Paul (Halifax) as a women's college in 1873, the Mount was one of the few institutions of higher education for women in Canada at a time when women could not vote. The original purpose of the academy was to train novices and young sisters as teachers. Still, the Sisters also recognized a need to educate other young women. Over the ensuing years, the order developed a convent, schools, an orphanage, and health care facilities throughout the Halifax area and across North America. \nThe Sisters of Charity Halifax, also staffed the Shubenacadie Residential School in Nova Scotia, which was open from 1930 to 1967, and the Cranbrook Residential School in British Columbia, which was open from 1890 to 1970. In October 2021, then-MSVU President Dr. Ramona Lumpkin apologized on behalf of the university to the survivors, their families and communities, as well as all Indigenous peoples, for the university\u2019s role in the tragedy of residential schools in Canada.\nArchitect Charles Welsford West designed the Romanesque chapel and annex (1903\u201305) at Mount St. Vincent Academy (now the University). He was the Architect of Nova Scotia Public Works &amp; Mines 1932\u20131950.\nBy 1912, the Sisters of Charity of Saint Vincent de Paul (Halifax) recognized the need to offer more significant opportunities through university education. They adopted a plan to establish a college for young women. Two years later, in 1914, the Sisters partnered with Dalhousie University, enabling Mount Saint Vincent to offer the first two years of a bachelor's degree program to be credited toward a Dalhousie degree.\nIn 1925, the Nova Scotia Legislature awarded the Mount the right to grant degrees, making it the only independent women's college in the British Commonwealth. By 1951, degrees were offered in Arts, Secretarial Science, Music, Home Economics, Library Science, Nursing and Education.\nA new charter was granted in 1966, and the College became Mount Saint Vincent University, establishing a board of governors and senate. This was also a period of tremendous growth\u2013 with enrolment increases, new construction, and new agreements. In 1967, the Mount began admitting male students. The university continued to evolve with the expansion of programs during the 1970s and entered into several new fields, including Child Study, Public Relations, Gerontology, Tourism and Hospitality Management, Cooperative Education, and Distance Education. In July 1988, the Sisters of Charity of Saint Vincent de Paul (Halifax) officially transferred ownership of the institution to the Board of Governors.\nCaritas Day.\nAfter a fire in 1951 burned down Mount Saint Vincent's only building, the people of Halifax came together to support students by providing alternative accommodations for their classes. In recognition of the generosity of their community, the Sisters of Charity established a memorial holiday in appreciation of their gesture. Caritas Day, named after the Christian virtue of charity, takes place on the last Wednesday of January of each year. No classes are held on this day, and students are encouraged to volunteer their time instead. Caritas Day is an opportunity for students and faculty alike to connect with the Sisters of Charity and come together outside of class in a personally and academically beneficial setting.\nPrograms.\nMount Saint Vincent University offers over 40 undergraduate arts, sciences, and professional studies degrees. Professional studies programs include Applied Human Nutrition, Business Administration, Child and Youth Study, Family Studies and Gerontology, Information Technology, Public Relations, Non-profit Leadership, and Tourism and Hospitality Management. All undergraduate programs are work-experience eligible, meaning any Mount student can participate in a work placement (practicum, co-op, internship) as part of their program.\nThe Mount also offers diplomas in Business Administration and tourism and hospitality Management and certificates in Accounting, Business Administration, Marketing, Proficiency in French, and Non-profit Leadership.\nFollowing the consolidation of post-secondary programs across Nova Scotia in the 1990s, the Mount became home to the only education program in the Halifax area. The faculty of Education is home to the only school psychology graduate program in Atlantic Canada. Graduates of this program are eligible to become registered psychologists in Nova Scotia and several other provinces in Canada.\nThe Mount houses 16 research centres and institutes.\nThe Department of Applied Human Nutrition has an accredited dietetic program. The University is accredited by a professional organization such as the Dietitians of Canada, and the university's graduates may subsequently become registered dietitians.\nMount Saint Vincent University is the only university in Canada to offer a Master of Public Relations program (MPR). The MPR program graduated its first class in October 2009. The Canadian Public Relations Society (CPRS) recognizes MSVU's MPR program for excellence in PR education in its Pathways to the Profession guide.\nSupport services.\nAcademic programs are supported by a wide variety of electronic and print research resources in the MSVU Library. Research services include drop-in reference assistance, research appointments, and classroom workshops.\nJanuary 2019 marked the 40th anniversary of the Mount's co-operative education program. It is the longest-standing nationally accredited co-op program in the Maritime Provinces, offering an optional co-op program in 1979 for students in the Bachelor of Business Administration program. Four decades later, more than 8,000 Business Administration, Public Relations, and Tourism &amp; Hospitality Management students have taken their learning from the classroom to the workplace, completing paid work terms in industries related to their field of study (today, co-op is a required part of the Public Relations and Tourism &amp; Hospitality Management degrees). Since 2014, the Mount Co-op Office has also enabled experiential opportunities for Arts and Science students through an Arts &amp; Science Internship Program.\nMount Saint Vincent University is home to the Centre for Women in Business, a not-for-profit university business development centre (UBDC), dedicated to assisting with entrepreneurial activities within and throughout Nova Scotia. Founded in 1992 by the University's Department of Business &amp; Tourism, this remains the only UBDC in Canada with a primary focus on women. The Centre has served more than 7500 clients over the past 18 years.\nArt Gallery.\nThe Mount Saint Vincent University Art Gallery is located on the first floor of Seton Academic Centre. It opened in 1971 as a resource for Mount Saint Vincent, the communities served by the university, artists, Metro Halifax residents, and the art public. Admission is always free of charge.\nMSVU Art Gallery reflects the University's educational aims by devoting a significant part of its activities to the representation of women as cultural subjects and producers. Its exhibitions explore various forms of cultural production, highlighting the achievements of Nova Scotian artists and themes relevant to academic programs offered by the university.\nWikuom.\nThe Mount was the first Nova Scotia university to add a wikuom to its campus facilities. First raised on June 12, 2017, the wikuom is a welcoming traditional Mi'kmaq space where Indigenous and non-Indigenous communities can gather and learn together.\nThe Mount is also home to the Aboriginal Student Centre (ASC), which is home to ASC staff who provide academic advising, counseling, and other support services to students. The ASC hosts several events, including the Mount's Mid-Winter Feast, Blanket Exercises, Cultural Workshops, Mini-Mount Camps, and more.\nAthletics.\nHome to the Mystics, the Mount competes in the Atlantic Colleges Athletic Association (ACAA) in Women's &amp; Men's Basketball, Women's &amp; Men's Soccer, Cross Country and Women's Volleyball. The Mystics hold championship titles in all sports, making them the most acclaimed team of the ACAA division.\nNotable alumni.\nNotable graduates of the Mount include:\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

They are used to demonstrate that two phones represent two separate phonemes in the language.\nMany phonologists in the middle part of the 20th century had a strong interest in developing techniques for discovering the phonemes of unknown languages, and in some cases, they set up writing systems for the languages. The major work of Kenneth Pike on the subject is \"Phonemics: a technique for reducing languages to writing\". The minimal pair was an essential tool in the discovery process and was found by substitution or commutation tests.\nAs an example for English vowels, the pair \"let\" + \"lit\" can be used to demonstrate that the phones (in let) and (in lit) actually represent distinct phonemes and . An example for English consonants is the minimal pair of \"pat\" + \"bat\". The following table shows other pairs demonstrating the existence of various distinct phonemes in English. All of the possible minimal pairs for any language may be set out in the same way.\nPhonemic differentiation may vary between different dialects of a language so a particular minimal pair in one accent may be a pair of homophones in another. That means not that one of the phonemes is absent in the homonym accent but only that it is not contrastive in the same range of contexts.\nTypes.\nIn addition to the minimal pairs of vowels and consonants provided above, others may be found:\nQuantity.\nMany languages show contrasts between long and short vowels and consonants. A distinctive difference in length is attributed by some phonologists to a unit called a chroneme. Thus, Italian has the following minimal pair that is based on long and short :\nHowever, in such a case it is not easy to decide whether a long vowel or consonant should be treated as having an added chroneme or simply as a geminate sound with phonemes.\nClassical Latin, German, some Italian dialects, almost all Uralic languages, Thai, and many other languages also have distinctive length in vowels. An example is the \"c\u016d/c\u016b\" minimal pair in the Italian dialect that is spoken near Palmi (Calabria, Italy):\nSyntactic gemination.\nIn some languages like Italian, word-initial consonants are geminated after certain vowel-final words in the same prosodic unit. Sometimes, the phenomenon can create some syntactic-gemination-minimal-pairs:\nIn the example, the graphical accent on \"d\u00e0\" is just a diacritical mark that does not change the pronunciation of the word itself. However, in some specific areas, like Tuscany, both phrases are pronounced and so can be distinguished only from the context.\nTone.\nMinimal pairs for tone contrasts in tone languages can be established; some writers refer to that as a contrast involving a toneme. For example, Kono, of Sierra Leone, distinguishes high tone and low tone on syllables:\nStress.\nLanguages in which stress may occur in different positions within the word often have contrasts that can be shown in minimal pairs, as in Greek and Spanish:\nIn English stress can determine the part of speech of a word: \"insult\" as a noun is while as a verb it is . In certain cases it can also differentiate two words: \"below\" vs \"billow\" .\nJuncture.\nAnglophones can distinguish between, for example, \"great ape\" and \"grey tape\", but phonemically, the two phrases are identical: . The difference between the two phrases, which constitute a minimal pair, is said to be one of juncture. At the word boundary, a \"plus juncture\" /+/ has been posited and said to be the factor conditioning allophones to allow distinctivity: in this example, the phrase \"great ape\" has an diphthong shortened by pre-fortis clipping and, since it is not syllable-initial, a with little aspiration (variously , , , , etc., depending on dialect); meanwhile in \"grey tape\", the has its full length and the is aspirated .\nOnly languages with allophonic differences associated with grammatical boundaries may have juncture as a phonological element. There is disagreement over whether or not French has phonological juncture: it seems likely that the difference between, for example, \" (some little holes) and \" (some little wheels), phonemically both , is only perceptible in slow, careful speech.\nMinimal sets.\nThe principle of a simple binary opposition between the two members of a minimal pair may be extended to cover a minimal set in which a number of words differ from one another in terms of one phone in a particular position in the word. For example, the vowels , , , , of Swahili are shown to be distinct by the following set of words:\n\"pata\" 'hinge', \"peta\" 'bend', \"pita\" 'pass', \"pota\" 'twist', \"puta\" 'thrash'. However, establishing such sets is not always straightforward\u200a and may require very complex study of multiple oppositions as expounded by, for example, Nikolai Trubetzkoy.\nTeaching.\nMinimal pairs were an important part of the theory of pronunciation teaching during its development in the period of structuralist linguistics, particularly in the 1940s and 1950s, and minimal pair drills were widely used to train students to discriminate among the phonemes of the target language. These drills took the form of minimal pair word drills and minimal pair sentence drills. For example, if the focus of a lesson was on the distinction /\u026a/ versus /\u025b/, learners might be asked to signal which sound they heard as the teacher pronounced lists of words with these phonemes such as \"lid/led\", \"tin/ten\", or \"slipped/slept\". Minimal pair sentence drills consisted of paired sentences such as \"He slipped on the floor/He slept on the floor.\" Again, learners would be asked to distinguish which of the sentences they heard as the teacher read them aloud. Another use of minimal pair drills was in pair work. Here, one member of the pair would be responsible for listening to the other member read the minimal pair word or sentence aloud and would be tasked with identifying which phoneme was being produced. In this form of classroom practice, both the skills of perception and production were practiced. Later writers have criticized the approach as being artificial and lacking in relevance to language learners' needs. However, even today minimal pair listening and production drills remain a common tool for the teaching of segmental differences.\nSome writers have claimed that learners are likely not to hear differences between phones if the difference is not a phonemic one. One of the objectives of contrastive analysis of languages' sound systems was to identify points of likely difficulty for language learners that would arise from differences in phoneme inventories between the native language and the target language. However, experimental evidence for this claim is hard to find, and the claim should be treated with caution.\nIn sign languages.\nIn the past, signs were considered holistic forms without internal structure. However, the discovery in the mid-20th century that minimal pairs also exist in sign languages showed that sign languages have sublexical structure. Signs consist of phonemes, which are specifications for location, movement, handshape, orientation, and non-manual elements. When signs differ in only one of these specifications, they form a minimal pair. For instance, the German Sign Language signs shoes and socks are identical in form apart from their handshapes.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;"}

It typically includes onions, carrots, celery, potatoes, cabbage, tomatoes, often legumes, such as beans, chickpeas or fava beans, and sometimes pasta or rice, and is characterized by the mixture of different vegetables and not very fine pieces (otherwise it is called ). Minestrone is traditionally made without meat, but it has no precise recipe and can be made with many different ingredients.\nEtymology.\nThe word \"minestrone\", meaning a thick vegetable soup, is attested in English from 1871. It is from Italian \"minestrone\", the augmentative form of \"minestra\", 'soup', or more literally 'that which is served', from \"minestrare\", 'to serve', and cognate with \"administer\" as in 'to administer a remedy'.\nBecause of its unique origins and the absence of a fixed recipe, minestrone varies widely across Italy depending on traditional cooking times, ingredients, and season. It ranges from a thick and dense texture with very boiled-down vegetables to a more brothy soup with large quantities of diced and lightly cooked vegetables; it may also include meats.\nIn modern Italian, there are three words corresponding to the English word \"soup\": \"zuppa\", which is used in the sense of tomato soup, or fish soup; \"minestra\", which is used in the sense of a more substantial soup such as a vegetable soup, and also for \"dry\" soups, namely pasta dishes; and \"minestrone\", which means a very substantial or large soup or stew, although the meaning has now come to be associated with this particular dish.\nHistory.\nSome of the earliest origins of minestrone pre-date the expansion of the Latin tribes of Rome into what became the Roman Kingdom (later Roman Republic and Empire), when the local diet was \"vegetarian by necessity\" and consisted mostly of vegetables, such as onions, lentils, cabbage, garlic, fava beans, mushrooms, carrots, asparagus, and turnips.\nDuring this time, the main dish of a meal would have been \"pulte\", a simple but filling porridge of spelt flour cooked in salt water, to which whatever vegetables that were available would have been added.\nIt was not until the 2nd century BC, when Rome had conquered Italy and monopolized the commercial and road networks, that a huge diversity of products flooded the capital and began to change their diet, and by association, the diet of Italy, most notably with the more frequent inclusion of meats, including as a stock for soups.\nSpelt flour was also removed from soups, as bread had been introduced into the Roman diet by the Greeks, and \"pulte\" became a meal largely for the poor.\nThe ancient Romans recognized the health benefits of a simple or \"frugal\" diet (from the Latin \"fruges\", the common name given to cereals, vegetables and legumes) and thick vegetable soups and vegetables remained a staple.\nMarcus Apicius's ancient cookbook \"De Re Coquinaria\" described \"polus\", a Roman soup dating back to 30 AD made of farro, chickpeas, and fava beans, with onions, garlic, lard, and greens thrown in.\nAs eating habits and ingredients changed in Italy, so did minestrone. Apicius updates the \"pultes\" and \"pulticulae\" with fancy trimmings such as cooked brains and wine. After the introduction of tomatoes to Italy from the New World in the 15th century, the plant was included as an ingredient in minestrone.\nThe tradition of not losing rural roots continues today, and minestrone is now known in Italy as belonging to the style of cooking called \"cucina povera\" ('cuisine of the poor'), meaning dishes that have rustic, rural roots, as opposed to \"cucina nobile\" ('cuisine of the nobles'), or the cooking style of the aristocracy and nobles.\nRegional variations.\n\"Minestrone alla genovese\" is a variant typical of Liguria which makes greater use of herbs, including pesto.\n\"Imbakbaka\" or \"mbakbaka\" is a type of stew in Libya made with pasta, chickpeas, bzar spice, and meat. It originated through Italian colonization.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Sister-inline/styles.css\"/&gt; Media related to at Wikimedia Commons\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It was discovered by Gerard Kuiper on 16 February 1948 at McDonald Observatory in Texas, and named after Miranda from William Shakespeare's play \"The Tempest\". Like the other large moons of Uranus, Miranda orbits close to its planet's equatorial plane. Because Uranus orbits the Sun on its side, Miranda's orbit is nearly perpendicular to the ecliptic and shares Uranus's extreme seasonal cycle.\nAt just in diameter, Miranda is one of the smallest closely observed objects in the Solar System that might be in hydrostatic equilibrium (spherical under its own gravity), and its total surface area is roughly equal to that of the U.S. state of Texas. The only close-up images of Miranda are from the \"Voyager 2\" probe, which made observations of Miranda during its Uranus flyby in January 1986. During the flyby, Miranda's southern hemisphere pointed towards the Sun, so only that part was studied.\nMiranda probably formed from an accretion disc that surrounded the planet shortly after its formation and, like other large moons, it is likely differentiated, with an inner core of rock surrounded by a mantle of ice. Miranda has one of the most extreme and varied topographies of any object in the Solar System, including Verona Rupes, a roughly scarp that may be the highest cliff in the Solar System, and chevron-shaped tectonic features called \"coronae\". The origin and evolution of this varied geology, the most of any Uranian satellite, are still not fully understood, and multiple hypotheses exist regarding Miranda's evolution.\nDiscovery and name.\nMiranda was discovered on 16 February 1948 by planetary astronomer Gerard Kuiper using the McDonald Observatory's Otto Struve Telescope. Its motion around Uranus was confirmed on 1 March 1948. It was the first satellite of Uranus discovered in nearly 100 years. Kuiper elected to name the object \"Miranda\" after the character in Shakespeare's \"The Tempest\", because the four previously discovered moons of Uranus, Ariel, Umbriel, Titania, and Oberon, had all been named after characters of Shakespeare or Alexander Pope. However, the previous moons had been named specifically after fairies, whereas Miranda was a human. Subsequently discovered satellites of Uranus were named after characters from Shakespeare and Pope, whether fairies or not. The moon is also designated Uranus V.\nPlanetary moons other than Earth's were never given symbols in the astronomical literature. Denis Moskowitz, a software engineer who designed most of the dwarf planet symbols, proposed an M (the initial of Miranda) combined with the low globe of J\u00e9r\u00f4me Lalande's Uranus symbol as the symbol of Miranda (). This symbol is not widely used.\nOrbit.\nOf Uranus's five round satellites, Miranda orbits closest to it, at roughly 129\u00a0000\u00a0km from the surface; about a quarter again as far as its most distant ring. It is the round moon that has the smallest orbit around a major planet. Its orbital period is 34 hours and, like that of the Moon, is synchronous with its rotation period, which means it always shows the same face to Uranus, a condition known as tidal locking. Miranda's orbital inclination (4.34\u00b0) is unusually high for a body so close to its planet \u2013 roughly ten times that of the other major Uranian satellites, and 73 times that of Oberon. The reason for this is still uncertain; there are no mean-motion resonances between the moons that could explain it, leading to the hypothesis that the moons occasionally pass through secondary resonances, which at some point in the past led to Miranda being locked for a time into a 3:1 resonance with Umbriel, before chaotic behaviour induced by the secondary resonances moved it out again. In the Uranian system, due to the planet's lesser degree of oblateness and the larger relative size of its satellites, escape from a mean-motion resonance is much easier than for satellites of Jupiter or Saturn.\nObservation and exploration.\nMiranda's apparent magnitude is +16.6, making it invisible to many amateur telescopes. Virtually all known information regarding its geology and geography was obtained during the flyby of Uranus made by \"Voyager 2\" on 25 January 1986, The closest approach of \"Voyager 2\" to Miranda was \u2014significantly less than the distances to all other Uranian moons. Of all the Uranian satellites, Miranda had the most visible surface. The discovery team had expected Miranda to resemble Mimas, and found themselves at a loss to explain the moon's unique geography in the 24-hour window before releasing the images to the press. In 2017, as part of its Planetary Science Decadal Survey, NASA evaluated the possibility of an orbiter to return to Uranus some time in the 2020s. Uranus was the preferred destination over Neptune due to favourable planetary alignments meaning shorter flight times.\nComposition and internal structure.\nAt 1.15\u00a0g/cm3, Miranda is the least dense of Uranus's round satellites. That density suggests a composition of more than 60% water ice. Miranda's surface may be mostly water ice, though it is far rockier than its corresponding satellites in the Saturn system, indicating that heat from radioactive decay may have led to internal differentiation, allowing silicate rock and organic compounds to settle in its interior. Miranda is too small for any internal heat to have been retained over the age of the Solar System. Miranda is the least spherical of Uranus's satellites, with an equatorial diameter 3% wider than its polar diameter. Only water has been detected so far on Miranda's surface, though it has been speculated that methane, ammonia, carbon monoxide or nitrogen may also exist at 3% concentrations. These bulk properties are similar to Saturn's moon Mimas, though Mimas is smaller, less dense, and more oblate. In 2024, Strom et al. conducted geological mapping of Miranda's southern hemisphere based on spatially resolved images from the Voyager 2 fly-by, followed by comparison of the observed geological features to modelling of tidal stress in natural satellites. This study suggested that Miranda might have had a liquid ocean of about 100 km thickness beneath the surface within the last 100-500 million years.\nPrecisely how a body as small as Miranda could have enough internal energy to produce the myriad geological features seen on its surface has not been established with certainty, though the currently favoured hypothesis is that it was driven by tidal heating during a past time when it was in 3:1 orbital resonance with Umbriel. The resonance would have increased Miranda's orbital eccentricity to 0.1, and generated tidal friction due to the varying tidal forces from Uranus. As Miranda approached Uranus, tidal force increased; as it retreated, tidal force decreased, causing flexing that would have warmed Miranda's interior by 20 K, enough to trigger melting. The period of tidal flexing could have lasted for up to 100 million years. Also, if clathrate existed within Miranda, as has been hypothesised for the satellites of Uranus, it may have acted as an insulator, since it has a lower conductivity than water, increasing Miranda's temperature still further. Miranda may have also once been in a 5:3 orbital resonance with Ariel, which would have also contributed to its internal heating. However, the maximum heating attributable to the resonance with Umbriel was likely about three times greater.\nGeography.\nMiranda has a unique surface. Among the geological structures that cover it are fractures, faults, valleys, craters, ridges, gorges, depressions, cliffs, and terraces. This moon is a mosaic of highly varied zones. Some areas are older and darker. As such, they bear numerous impact craters, as is expected of a small inert body. Other regions are made of rectangular or ovoid strips. They feature complex sets of parallel ridges and rupes (fault scarps) as well as numerous outcrops of bright and dark materials, suggesting an exotic composition. This moon is most likely composed only of water ice on the surface, as well as silicate rocks and other more or less buried organic compounds.\nRegiones.\nThe regiones identified on the images taken by the \"Voyager 2\" probe are named \"Mantua Regio\", \"Ephesus Regio\", \"Sicilia Regio\", and \"Dunsinane Regio\". They designate major regions of Miranda where hilly terrain and plains follow one another, more or less dominated by ancient impact craters. Normal faults also mark these ancient regions. Some escarpments are as old as the formation of the regions while others are much more recent and appear to have formed after the coronae. These faults are accompanied by grabens characteristic of ancient tectonic activity. The surface of these regions is fairly uniformly dark. However, the cliffs bordering certain impact craters reveal, at depth, the presence of much more luminous material.\nCoronae.\nMiranda is one of very few objects in the Solar system to have crowns (also called coronae). The three known coronae observed on Miranda are named Inverness Corona near the south pole, Arden Corona at the apex of the moon's orbital motion, and Elsinore Corona at the antapex. The highest albedo contrasts on Miranda's surface occur within the Inverness and Arden coronae.\nInverness Corona.\nInverness Corona is a trapezoidal region of approximately on a side which lies near the south pole. This region is characterized by a central geological structure which takes the shape of a luminous chevron, a surface with a relatively high albedo, and a series of gorges which extend northwards from a point near the pole. At a latitude of around \u221255\u00b0, north-south oriented gorges tend to intersect with others, which follow an east-west direction. The outer boundary of Inverness, as well as its internal patterns of ridges and bands of contrasting albedos, form numerous salient angles. It is bounded on three sides (south, east and north) by a complex system of faults. The nature of the west coast is less clear, but may also be tectonic. Within the crown, the surface is dominated by parallel gorges spaced a few kilometers apart. The low number of impact craters indicates that Inverness is the youngest among the three coronae observed on the surface of Miranda.\nArden Corona.\nArden Corona, present in the front hemisphere of Miranda, extends over approximately from east to west. The other dimension, however, remains unknown because the terrain extended beyond the terminator (on the hemisphere plunged into night) when \"Voyager 2\" photographed it. The outer margin of this corona forms parallel and dark bands which surround in gentle curves a more clearly rectangular core at least wide. The overall effect has been described as an ovoid of lines. The interior and belt of Arden show very different morphologies. The interior topography appears regular and soft. It is also characterized by a mottled pattern resulting from large patches of relatively bright material scattered over a generally dark surface. The stratigraphic relationship between the light and dark marks could not be determined from the images provided by \"Voyager 2\". The area at the margin of Arden is characterized by concentric albedo bands which extend from the western end of the crown where they intersect crateriform terrain (near 40\u00b0 longitude) and on the side east, where they extend beyond the, in the northern hemisphere (near 110\u00b0 longitude). The contrasting albedo bands are composed of outer fault scarp faces. This succession of escarpments gradually pushes the land into a deep hollow along the border between Arden and the crateriform terrain called Mantua Regio. Arden was formed during a geological episode which preceded the formation of Inverness but which is contemporary with the formation of Elsinore.\nElsinore Corona.\nElsinore Corona is the third corona, which was observed in the rear hemisphere of Miranda, along the terminator. It is broadly similar to Arden in size and internal structure. They both have an outer belt about wide, which wraps around an inner core. The topography of the core of Elsinore consists of a complex set of intersections of troughs and bumps which are truncated by this outer belt which is marked by roughly concentric linear ridges. The troughs also include small segments of rolling, cratered terrain. Elsinore also presents segments of furrows, called \"\"sulcus\", comparable to those observed on Ganymede.\nRupes.\nMiranda also features enormous escarpments that can be traced across the moon. Some of them are older than the coronae, others younger. The most spectacular fault system begins at a deep valley visible at the terminator.\nThis network of faults begins on the northwest side of Inverness where it forms a deep gorge on the outer edge of the ovoid which surrounds the crown. This geological formation is named \"Argier Rupes\"\".\nThe most impressive fault then extends to the terminator, extending from the top of the central \"chevron\" of Inverness. Near the terminator, a gigantic luminous cliff, named Verona Rupes, forms complex grabens. The fault is approximately wide, the graben at the bright edge is 10 to deep. The height of the sheer cliff is 5 to . Although it could not be observed by the \"Voyager 2\" probe on the face immersed in the polar night of Miranda, it is probable that this geological structure extends beyond the terminator in the northern hemisphere.\nImpact craters.\nDuring the close flyby of \"Voyager 2\" in January 1986, only the craters on the southern hemisphere of Miranda could be observed. They generally had diameters of over , representing the limit of resolution of the digital images transmitted by the probe during its flight. These craters have very varied morphologies. Some have well-defined borders and are sometimes surrounded by ejecta deposits characteristic of impact craters. Others are very degraded and sometimes barely recognizable, as their topography has been altered. The age of a crater does not give an indication of the date of formation of the terrain it marked. On the other hand, this date depends on the number of craters present on a site, regardless of their age. The more impact craters a terrain has, the older it is. Scientists use these as \"planetary chronometers\"; they count observed craters to date the formation of the terrain of inert natural satellites devoid of atmospheres, such as Callisto.\nNo multiple ring crater, nor any complex crater with a central peak, has been observed on Miranda. Simple craters, that is to say whose cavity is bowl-shaped, and transitional craters (with a flat bottom) are the norm, with their diameter not correlated to their shape. Thus simple craters of more than are observed while elsewhere transitional craters of have been identified. Ejecta deposits are rare, and are never associated with craters larger than in diameter. The ejecta that sometimes surround craters with a diameter less than appear systematically brighter than the material surrounding them. On the other hand, ejecta associated with craters of size between and are generally darker than what surrounds them (the albedo of the ejecta is lower than that of the matter surrounding them). Finally, some ejecta deposits, associated with diameters of all sizes, have an albedo comparable to that of the material on which they rest.\nIn regiones.\nIn some regiones, and particularly in those of the visible part of the anti-Uranian hemisphere (which continually turns its back on the planet), craters are very frequent. They are sometimes stuck to each other with very little space between each one. Elsewhere, craters are less frequent and are separated by large, weakly undulated surfaces. The rim of many craters is surrounded by luminous material while streaks of dark material are observed on the walls which surround the bottom of the craters. In Matuna Regio, between the craters Truncilo and Fransesco, there is a gigantic circular geological structure of in diameter which could be a basin impact very significantly degraded. These findings suggest that these regions contain a shiny material at shallow depth, while a layer of dark material (or a material which darkens upon contact with the external environment) is present, at greater depth.\nIn coronae.\nCraters are statistically up to ten times less numerous in the coronae than in the anti-Uranian regions, which indicates that these formations are younger.\nThe density of impact craters could be established for different areas of Inverness, and made it possible to establish the age of each. Considering these measurements, the entire geological formation was formed in a relative unit of time. However, other observations make it possible to establish that the youngest zone, within this crown, is the one which separates the \"chevron\", from Argier Rupes.\nThe density of impact craters in the core and in the Arden belt is statistically similar. The two distinct parts of this formation must therefore have been part of a common geological episode. Nevertheless, the superposition of craters on bands of the central core of Arden indicates that its formation preceded that of the scarps which surround it. The data from the impact craters can be interpreted as follows: the interior and marginal zones of the corona, including most of the albedo bands, were formed during the same period of time. Their formation was followed by later tectonic developments which produced the high-relief fault scarps observed along the edge of the crown near longitude 110\u00b0.\nThe density of impact craters seems the same in the structure surrounding Elsinore as in its central core. The two zones of the crown seem to have formed during the same geological period, but other geological elements suggest that the perimeter of Elsinore is younger than its core.\nOther observations.\nThe number of craters should be higher in the hemisphere at the apex of the orbital movement than at the antapex. However, it is the anti-Uranian hemisphere which is densest in craters. This situation could be explained by a past event having caused a reorientation of Miranda's axis of rotation by 90\u00b0 compared to that which is currently known. In this case, the paleoapex hemisphere of the moon would have become the current anti-Uranian hemisphere. However, the count of impact craters being limited to the southern hemisphere only, illuminated during the passage of the Voyager 2 probe, it is possible that Miranda has experienced a more complex reorientation and that its paleoapex is located somewhere in the northern hemisphere, which has not yet been photographed.\nOrigin and formation.\nSeveral scenarios are proposed to explain its formation and geological evolution. One of them postulates that it would result from the accretion of a disk of gas and dust called a \"subnebula\". This sub-nebula either existed around Uranus for some period of time after its formation, or was created following a cosmic impact which would have given its great obliquity to the axis of rotation of Uranus. However, this relatively small moon has areas that are surprisingly young compared to the geological time scale. It seems that the most recent geological formations only date back a few hundred million years. However, thermal models applicable to moons the size of Miranda predict rapid cooling and the absence of geological evolution following its accretion from the subnebula. Geological activity over such a long period cannot be justified either by the heat resulting from the initial accretion, nor by the heat generated by the fission of radioactive materials involved in the formation.\nMiranda has the youngest surface among those of the satellites of the Uranian system, which indicates that its geography has undergone the most important evolutions. This geography would be explained by a complex geological history including a still unknown combination of different astronomical phenomena. Among these phenomena would be tidal forces, mechanisms of orbital resonances, processes of partial differentiation, or even movements of convection.\nThe geological patchwork could be partly the result of a catastrophic collision with an impactor. This event may have completely dislocated Miranda. The different pieces would then have re-assembled, then gradually reorganized in the spherical form that the \"Voyager 2\" probe photographed. Some scientists even speak of several cycles of collision and re-accretion of the moon. This geological hypothesis was depreciated in 2011 in favor of hypotheses involving Uranian tidal forces. These would have pulled and turned the materials present under Inverness and Arden to create fault scarps. The stretching and distortion caused by Uranus's gravity, which alone could have provided the heat source necessary to power these uprisings.\nThe oldest known regions on the surface of Miranda are cratered plains such as Sicilia Regio and Ephesus Regio. The formation of these terrains follows the accretion of the moon then its cooling. The bottoms of the oldest craters are thus partially covered with material from the depths of the moon referred to as endogenous resurfacing, which was a surprising observation. The geological youth of Miranda demonstrates that a heat source then took over from the initial heat provided by the accretion of the moon. The most satisfactory explanation for the origin of the heat which animated the moon is the one which also explains the volcanism on Io: a situation of orbital resonance now on Miranda and the important phenomenon of tidal forces generated by Uranus.\nAfter this first geological epoch, Miranda experienced a period of cooling which generated an overall extension of its core and produced fragments and cracks of its mantle on the surface, in the form of grabens. It is indeed possible that Miranda, Ariel, and Umbriel participated in several important resonances involving the pairs Miranda/Ariel, Ariel/Umbriel, and Miranda/Umbriel. Unlike those observed on Jupiter's moon Io, these orbital resonance phenomena between Miranda and Ariel could not lead to a stable capture of the small moon. Instead of being captured, Miranda's orbital resonance with Ariel and Umbriel may have led to the increase in its eccentricity and orbital inclination. By successively escaping several orbital resonances, Miranda alternated phases of heating and cooling. Thus all the known grabens of Miranda were not formed during this second geological episode.\nA third major geological epoch occurs with the orbital reorientation of Miranda and the formation of Elsinore and Arden coronae. A singular volcanic event, made of flows of solid materials, could then to have taken place, within the coronae in formation. Another explanation proposed for the formation of these two coronae would be the product of a diapir which would have formed in the heart of the moon. On this occasion Miranda would have at least partially differentiated. Considering the size and position of these coronae, it is possible that their formation contributed to changing the moment of inertia of the moon. This could have caused a 90\u00b0 reorientation of Miranda. Doubt remains as to the concomitant existence of these two formations. It is possible that at this time, the moon was distorted to the point that its asphericity and eccentricity temporarily caused it to undergo a chaotic rotational movement, such as that observed on Hyperion. If Miranda's orbital reorientation occurred before the two coronae formed on the surface, then Elsinore would be older than Arden. Chaotic movement phenomena generated by the entry into 3:1 resonance between the orbit of Miranda and that of Umbriel could have contributed to an increase in Miranda's orbital inclination greater than 3\u00b0.\nA final geological episode consists of the formation of Inverness which seems to have induced surface tensions which gave rise to the creation of additional grabens including Verona Rupes and Argier Rupes. Following this new cooling of Miranda, its total volume could have increased by 4%. It is probable that these different geological episodes followed one another without interruption.\nUltimately, Miranda's geological history may have spanned a period of more than 3 billion years. It would have started 3.5 billion years ago with the appearance of heavily cratered regions and ended a few hundred million years ago, with the formation of the coronae.\nThe phenomena of orbital resonances, and mainly that associated with Umbriel, but also, to a lesser extent, that of Ariel, would have had a significant impact on the orbital eccentricity of Miranda, and would also have contributed to the internal heating and geological activity of the moon. The whole would have induced convection movements in its substrate and allowed the start of planetary differentiation. At the same time, these phenomena would have only slightly disturbed the orbits of the other moons involved, which are more massive than Miranda. However, Miranda's surface may appear too tortured to be the sole product of orbital resonance phenomena.\nAfter Miranda escaped from this resonance with Umbriel, through a mechanism that likely moved the moon into its current, abnormally high orbital tilt, the eccentricity would have been reduced. The tidal forces would then have erased the eccentricity and the temperature at the heart of the moon. This would have allowed it to regain a spherical shape, without allowing it to erase the impressive geological artifacts such as Verona Rupes. This eccentricity being the source of the tidal forces, its reduction would have deactivated the heat source which fueled the ancient geological activity of Miranda, making it a cold and inert moon.\nReferences.\nSources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Trends in the planet's portrayal have largely been influenced by advances in planetary science. It became the most popular celestial object in fiction in the late 1800s, when it became clear that there was no life on the Moon. The predominant genre depicting Mars at the time was utopian fiction. Around the same time, the mistaken belief that there are canals on Mars emerged and made its way into fiction, popularized by Percival Lowell's speculations of an ancient civilization having constructed them. \"The War of the Worlds\", H. G. Wells's novel about an alien invasion of Earth by sinister Martians, was published in 1897 and went on to have a major influence on the science fiction genre.\nLife on Mars appeared frequently in fiction throughout the first half of the 1900s. Apart from enlightened as in the utopian works from the turn of the century, or evil as in the works inspired by Wells, intelligent and human-like Martians began to be depicted as decadent, a portrayal that was popularized by Edgar Rice Burroughs in the \"Barsoom\" series and adopted by Leigh Brackett among others. More exotic lifeforms appeared in stories like Stanley G. Weinbaum's \"A Martian Odyssey\".\nThe theme of colonizing Mars replaced stories about native inhabitants of the planet in the second half of the 1900s following emerging evidence of the planet being inhospitable to life, eventually confirmed by data from Mars exploration probes. A significant minority of works persisted in portraying Mars in a nostalgic way that was by then scientifically outdated, including Ray Bradbury's \"The Martian Chronicles\".\nTerraforming Mars to enable human habitation has been another major theme, especially in the final quarter of the century, the most prominent example being Kim Stanley Robinson's \"Mars\" trilogy. Stories of the first human mission to Mars appeared throughout the 1990s in response to the Space Exploration Initiative, and near-future exploration and settlement became increasingly common themes following the launches of other Mars exploration probes in the latter half of the decade. In the year 2000, science fiction scholar Gary Westfahl estimated the total number of works of fiction dealing with Mars up to that point to exceed five thousand, and the planet has continued to make frequent appearances across several genres and forms of media since. In contrast, the moons of Mars\u2014Phobos and Deimos\u2014have made only sporadic appearances in fiction.\nEarly depictions.\nBefore the 1800s, Mars did not get much attention in fiction writing as a primary setting, though it did appear in some stories visiting multiple locations in the Solar System. The first fictional tour of the planets, the 1656 work \"Itinerarium exstaticum\" by Athanasius Kircher, portrays Mars as a volcanic wasteland. It also appears briefly in the 1686 work \"Entretiens sur la pluralit\u00e9 des mondes\" (\"Conversations on the Plurality of Worlds\") by Bernard Le Bovier de Fontenelle but is largely dismissed as uninteresting due to its presumed similarity to Earth. Mars is home to spirits in several works of the mid-1700s. In the anonymously published 1755 work \"A Voyage to the World in the Centre of the Earth\", it is a heavenly place where, among others, Alexander the Great enjoys a second life. In the 1758 work \"De Telluribus in Mundo Nostro Solari\" (\"Concerning the Earths in Our Solar System\") by Emanuel Swedenborg, the planet is inhabited by beings characterized by honesty and moral virtue. In the 1765 novel \"Voyage de Milord C\u00e9ton dans les sept plan\u00e8tes\" (\"The Voyages of Lord Seaton to the Seven Planets\") by Marie-Anne de Roumier-Robert, reincarnated soldiers roam a war-torn landscape. It later appeared alongside the other planets throughout the 1800s. In the anonymously published 1839 novel \"A Fantastical Excursion into the Planets\", it is divided between the Roman gods Mars and Vulcan. In the anonymously published 1873 novel \"A Narrative of the Travels and Adventures of Paul Aermont among the Planets\", it is culturally rather similar to Earth\u2014unlike the other planets. In the 1883 novel \"Aleriel, or A Voyage to Other Worlds\" by W. S. Lach-Szyrma, a visitor from Venus relates the details of Martian society to Earthlings. The first work of science fiction set primarily on Mars was the 1880 novel \"Across the Zodiac\" by Percy Greg.\nMars became the most popular extraterrestrial location in fiction in the late 1800s as it became clear that the Moon was devoid of life. A recurring theme in this time period was that of reincarnation on Mars, reflecting an upswing in interest in the paranormal in general and in relation to Mars in particular. Humans are reborn on Mars in the 1889 novel \"Uranie\" by Camille Flammarion as a form of afterlife, the 1896 novel \"Daybreak: The Story of an Old World\" by James Cowan depicts Jesus reincarnated there, and the protagonist of the 1903 novel \"The Certainty of a Future Life in Mars\" by Louis Pope Gratacap receives a message in Morse code from his deceased father on Mars. Other supernatural phenomena include telepathy in Greg's \"Across the Zodiac\" and precognition in the 1886 short story \"The Blindman's World\" by Edward Bellamy. \nSeveral recurring tropes were introduced during this time. One of them is Mars having a different local name such as Glintan in the 1889 novel \"Mr. Stranger's Sealed Packet\" by Hugh MacColl, Oron in the 1892 novel \"Messages from Mars, By Aid of the Telescope Plant\" by Robert D. Braine, and Barsoom in the 1912 novel \"A Princess of Mars\" by Edgar Rice Burroughs. This carried on in later works such as the 1938 novel \"Out of the Silent Planet\" by C. S. Lewis, which calls the planet Malacandra. Several stories also depict Martians speaking Earth languages and provide explanations of varying levels of preposterousness. In the 1899 novel \"Pharaoh's Broker\" by Ellsworth Douglass, Martians speak Hebrew as Mars goes through the same historical phases as Earth with a delay of a few thousand years, here corresponding to the captivity of the Israelites in Biblical Egypt. In the 1901 novel \"A Honeymoon in Space\" by George Griffith, they speak English because they acknowledge it as the \"most convenient\" language of all. In the 1920 novel \"A Trip to Mars\" by Marcianus Rossi, the Martians speak Latin as a result of having been taught the language by a Roman who was flung into space by the eruption of Mount Vesuvius in the year 79. Martians were often portrayed as existing within a racial hierarchy: the 1894 novel \"Journey to Mars\" by Gustavus W. Pope features Martians with different skin colours (red, blue, and yellow) subject to strict anti-miscegenation laws, Rossi's \"A Trip to Mars\" sees one portion of the Martian population described as \"our inferior race, the same as your terrestrian negroes\", and Burroughs's \"Barsoom\" series has red, green, yellow, and black Martians, a white race\u2014responsible for the previous advanced civilization on Mars\u2014having become extinct.\nMeans of travel.\nThe question of how humans would get to Mars was addressed in several ways: when not travelling there via spaceship as in the 1911 novel ' by Mark Wicks, they might use a flying carpet as in the 1905 novel ' by Edwin Lester Arnold, a balloon as in \"A Narrative of the Travels and Adventures of Paul Aermont among the Planets\", or an \"aeroplane\" as in the 1893 novel \"Unveiling a Parallel: A Romance\" by Alice Ilgenfritz Jones and Ella Robinson Merchant (writing jointly as \"Two Women of the West\"). They might also visit in a dream as in the 1899 play \"A Message from Mars\" by Richard Ganthony, teleport via astral projection as in Burroughs's \"A Princess of Mars\", or use a long-range communication device while staying on Earth as in Braine's \"Messages from Mars, By Aid of the Telescope Plant\" and the 1894 novel \"W nieznane \u015bwiaty\" (\"To the Unknown Worlds\") by Polish science fiction writer W\u0142adys\u0142aw Umi\u0144ski. Anti-gravity is employed in several works including Greg's \"Across the Zodiac\", MacColl's \"Mr. Stranger's Sealed Packet\", and the 1890 novel \"A Plunge into Space\" by Robert Cromie. Occasionally, the method of transport is not addressed at all. Some stories take the opposite approach of having Martians come to Earth; examples include the 1891 novel \"\" by Thomas Blot (pseudonym of William Simpson) and the 1893 novel \"A Cityless and Countryless World\" by Henry Olerich.\nCanals.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\nA clement twilight zone on a synchronously rotating Mercury, a swamp-and-jungle Venus, and a canal-infested Mars, while all classic science-fiction devices, are all, in fact, based upon earlier misapprehensions by planetary scientists. \nCarl Sagan, 1978 \nDuring the opposition of Mars in 1877, Italian astronomer Giovanni Schiaparelli announced the discovery of linear structures he dubbed (literally \"channels\", but widely translated as \"canals\") on the Martian surface. These were generally interpreted\u2014by those who accepted their disputed existence\u2014as waterways, and they made their earliest appearance in fiction in the anonymously published 1883 novel \"Politics and Life in Mars\", where the Martians live in the water. Schiaparelli's observations, and perhaps the translation of as \"canals\" rather than \"channels\", inspired Percival Lowell to speculate that these were artificial constructs and write a series of non-fiction books\u2014\"Mars\" in 1895, \"Mars and Its Canals\" in 1906, and \"Mars as the Abode of Life\" in 1908\u2014popularizing the idea. Lowell posited that Mars was home to an ancient and advanced but dying or already dead Martian civilization who had constructed these vast canals for irrigation to survive on an increasingly arid planet, and this became an enduring vision of Mars that influenced writers across several decades. Science fiction scholar Gary Westfahl, drawing from the catalogue of early science fiction works compiled by E. F. Bleiler and Richard Bleiler in the reference works ' from 1990 and ' from 1998, concludes that Lowell thus \"effectively set the boundaries for subsequent narratives about an inhabited Mars\".\nCanals became a feature of romantic portrayals of Mars such as Burroughs's \"Barsoom\" series. Early works that did not depict any waterways on Mars typically explained the appearance of straight lines on the surface in some other way, such as simooms or large tracts of vegetation. Although they quickly fell out of favour as a serious scientific theory, largely as a result of higher-quality telescopic observations by astronomers such as E. M. Antoniadi failing to detect them, canals continued to make sporadic appearances in fiction for a while in works such as the 1936 novel \"Planet Plane\" by John Wyndham, the 1938 novel \"Out of the Silent Planet\" by C. S. Lewis, and the 1949 novel \"Red Planet\" by Robert A. Heinlein. Said Lewis in response to criticism from biologist J. B. S. Haldane, \"The canals in Mars are there not because I believe in them but because they are part of the popular tradition.\" Eventually, the flyby of Mars by Mariner 4 in 1965 conclusively determined that the canals were mere optical illusions.\nUtopias.\nBecause early versions of the nebular hypothesis of Solar System formation held that the planets were formed sequentially starting at the outermost planets, some authors envisioned Mars as an older and more mature world than the Earth, and it became the setting for many utopian works of fiction. This genre made up the majority of stories about Mars in the late 1800s and continued to be represented through the early 1900s. The earliest of these works was the 1880 novel \"Across the Zodiac\" by Percy Greg. The 1887 novel \"\" by William James Roe portrays a Martian society where everyone ages backwards. The 1890 novel \"A Plunge into Space\" by Robert Cromie depicts a society that is so advanced that life there has become dull and, as a result, the humans who visit succumb to boredom and leave ahead of schedule\u2014to the approval of the Martians, who have come to view them as a corrupting influence. The 1892 novel \"Messages from Mars, By Aid of the Telescope Plant\" by Robert D. Braine is unusual in portraying a completely rural Martian utopia without any cities. An early work of feminist science fiction, Jones's and Merchant's 1893 novel \"Unveiling a Parallel: A Romance\", depicts a man from Earth visiting two egalitarian societies on Mars: one where women have adopted male vices and one where equality has brought out everyone's best qualities. The 1897 novel \"Auf zwei Planeten\" (\"Two Planets\") by German science fiction pioneer Kurd Lasswitz contrasts a utopian society on Mars with that society's colonialist actions on Earth. The book was translated into several languages and was highly influential in Continental Europe, including inspiring rocket scientist Wernher von Braun, but did not receive a translation into English until the 1970s, which limited its impact in the Anglosphere. The 1910 novel \"The Man from Mars, Or Service for Service's Sake\" by Henry Wallace Dowding portrays a civilization on Mars based on a variation on Christianity where woman was created first, in contrast to the conventional Genesis creation narrative. Hugo Gernsback depicted a science-based utopia on Mars in the 1915\u20131917 serial \"Baron M\u00fcnchhausen's New Scientific Adventures\", but by and large, World War I spelled the end for utopian Martian fiction.\nIn Russian science fiction, Mars became the setting for socialist utopias and revolutions. The 1908 novel \"Red Star\" (\"\u041a\u0440\u0430\u0441\u043d\u0430\u044f \u0437\u0432\u0435\u0437\u0434\u0430\") by Alexander Bogdanov is the primary example of this, and inspired many others. \"Red Star\" portrays a socialist society on Mars from the perspective of a Russian Bolshevik invited there, where the struggle between classes has been replaced with a common struggle against the harshness of nature. The 1913 prequel \"Engineer Menni\" (\"\u0418\u043d\u0436\u0435\u043d\u0435\u0440 \u041c\u044d\u043d\u043d\u0438\"), also by Bogdanov, is set several centuries earlier and serves as an origin story for the Martian society by detailing the events of the revolution that brought it about. Another prominent example is the 1922 novel \"Aelita\" (\"\u0410\u044d\u043b\u0438\u0442\u0430\") by Aleksey Nikolayevich Tolstoy\u2014along with its 1924 film adaptation, the earliest Soviet science fiction film\u2014which adapts the story of the 1905 Russian Revolution to the Martian surface. \"Red Star\" and \"Aelita\" are in some ways opposites. \"Red Star\", written between the failed revolution in 1905 and the successful 1917 Russian Revolution, sees Mars as a socialist utopia from which Earth can learn, whereas in \"Aelita\" the socialist revolution is instead exported from the early Soviet Russia to Mars. \"Red Star\" depicts a utopia on Mars, in contrast to the dystopia initially found on Mars in \"Aelita\"\u2014though both are technocracies. \"Red Star\" is a sincere and idealistic work of traditional utopian fiction, whereas \"Aelita\" is a parody.\n\"The War of the Worlds\".\nThe 1897 novel \"The War of the Worlds\" by H. G. Wells, which depicts an alien invasion of Earth by Martians in search of resources, represented a turning point in Mars fiction. Rather than being portrayed as essentially human, Wells's Martians have a completely inhuman appearance and cannot be communicated with. Rather than being noble creatures to emulate, the Martians dispassionately kill and exploit the Earthlings like livestock\u2014a critique of contemporary British colonialism in general and its devastating effects on the Aboriginal Tasmanians in particular. The novel set the tone for the majority of the science-fictional depictions of Mars in the decades that followed in portraying the Martians as malevolent and Mars as a dying world. Beyond Martian fiction, the novel had a large influence on the broader science fiction genre, and inspired rocket scientist Robert H. Goddard. According to science fiction essayist Bud Webster, \"It's impossible to overstate the importance of \"The War of the Worlds\" and the influence it's had over the years.\" \nAn unauthorized sequel\u2014\"Edison's Conquest of Mars\" by Garrett P. Serviss\u2014was released in 1898, as was a parody by Charles L. Graves and E. V. Lucas titled \"The War of the Wenuses\". Wells's story gained further notoriety in 1938 when a radio adaptation by Orson Welles in the style of a news broadcast was mistaken for a real newscast by some listeners in the US, leading to panic; less famously, a 1949 broadcast in Quito, Ecuador, also resulted in a riot. Several sequels and adaptations by other authors have been written since, including the 1950 Superman comic book story \"Black Magic on Mars\" by Alvin Schwartz and Wayne Boring where Orson Welles tries to warn Earth of an impending Martian invasion but is dismissed, the 1968 novel \"The Second Invasion from Mars\" (\"\u0412\u0442\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0435 \u043d\u0430\u0448\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0438\u0435 \u043c\u0430\u0440\u0441\u0438\u0430\u043d\") by Soviet science fiction writers Arkady and Boris Strugatsky where the Martians forgo military conquest in favour of infiltration, the 1975 novel \"Sherlock Holmes's War of the Worlds\" by Manly Wade Wellman and Wade Wellman and the 1976 novel \"The Second War of the Worlds\" by George H. Smith which both combine Wells's story with Arthur Conan Doyle's Sherlock Holmes characters, the 1976 novel \"The Space Machine\" by Christopher Priest which combines the story of \"The War of the Worlds\" with that of Wells's 1895 novel \"The Time Machine\", the 2002 short story \"Ulla, Ulla\" by Eric Brown which reframes the invasion as a desperate escape by a peaceful race from a dying world, and the 2005 novel \"The Martian War\" by Kevin J. Anderson where Wells himself goes to Mars and instigates a slave uprising. The authorized 2017 sequel novel \"The Massacre of Mankind\" by Stephen Baxter is set in 1920 in an alternate timeline where the events of the original novel caused World War I never to happen by making Britain war-weary and isolationist, and the Martians attack yet again after inoculating themselves against the microbes that were their downfall the first time.\nLife on Mars.\nThe term \"Martians\" typically refers to inhabitants of Mars that are similar to humans in terms of having such things as language and civilization, though it is also occasionally used to refer to extraterrestrials in general. These inhabitants of Mars have variously been depicted as enlightened, evil, and decadent; in keeping with the conception of Mars as an older civilization than Earth, Westfahl refers to these as \"good parents\", \"bad parents\", and \"dependent parents\", respectively.\nMartians have also been equated with humans in different ways. Humans are revealed to be the descendants of Martians in several stories including the 1954 short story \"Survey Team\" by Philip K. Dick. Conversely, Martians are the descendants of humans from Earth in some works such as the 1889 novel \"Mr. Stranger's Sealed Packet\" by Hugh MacColl, where a close approach between Mars and Earth in the past allowed some humans to get to Mars, and Tolstoy's \"Aelita\" where they are descended from inhabitants of the lost civilization of Atlantis. Human settlers take on the new identity of Martians in the 1946 short story \"The Million Year Picnic\" by Ray Bradbury (later included in the 1950 fix-up novel \"The Martian Chronicles\"), and this theme of \"becoming Martians\" came to be a recurring motif in Martian fiction toward the end of the century.\nEnlightened.\nThe portrayal of Martians as superior to Earthlings appeared throughout the utopian fiction of the late 1800s. In-depth treatment of the nuances of the concept was pioneered by Kurd Lasswitz with the 1897 novel \"Auf zwei Planeten\", wherein the Martians visit Earth to share their more advanced knowledge with humans and gradually end up acting as an occupying colonial power. Martians sharing wisdom or knowledge with humans is a recurring element in these stories, and some works such as the 1952 novel \"David Starr, Space Ranger\" by Isaac Asimov depict Martians sharing their advanced technology with the inhabitants of Earth. Several depictions of enlightened Martians have a religious dimension: in the 1938 novel \"Out of the Silent Planet\" by C. S. Lewis, Martians are depicted as Christian beings free from original sin, the Martian Klaatu who visits Earth in the 1951 film \"The Day the Earth Stood Still\" is a Christ figure, and the 1961 novel \"Stranger in a Strange Land\" by Robert A. Heinlein revolves around a human raised by Martians who brings a religion based on their ideals to Earth as a prophet. In comic books, the superhero Martian Manhunter first appeared in 1955. In the 1956 novel \"No Man Friday\" by Rex Gordon, an astronaut stranded on Mars encounters pacifist Martians and feels compelled to omit the human history of warfare lest they think of humans as savage creatures akin to cannibals. On television, the 1963\u20131966 sitcom \"My Favorite Martian\"\u2014later adapted to children's animation in 1973 and to film in 1999\u2014portrayed a Martian comedically; the contemporaneous science fiction anthology series \"The Twilight Zone\" and \"The Outer Limits\" also occasionally featured Martian characters, such as in \"Mr. Dingle, the Strong\" where they find disappointment in human lack of altruism and \"Controlled Experiment\" where murder is a foreign concept to them.\nEvil.\nThere is a long tradition of portraying Martians as warlike, perhaps inspired by the planet's association with the Roman god of war. The seminal depiction of Martians as evil creatures was the 1897 novel \"The War of the Worlds\" by H. G. Wells, wherein the Martians attack Earth. This characterization dominated the pulp era of science fiction, appearing in works such as the 1928 short story \"The Menace of Mars\" by Clare Winger Harris, the 1931 short story \"Monsters of Mars\" by Edmond Hamilton, and the 1935 short story \"Mars Colonizes\" by Miles J. Breuer. It quickly became regarded as a clich\u00e9 and inspired a kind of countermovement that portrayed Martians as meek in works like the 1933 short story \"The Forgotten Man of Space\" by P. Schuyler Miller and the 1934 short story \"Old Faithful\" by Raymond Z. Gallun. The 1946 novel \"The Man from Mars\" by Polish science fiction writer Stanis\u0142aw Lem likewise depicts a Martian mistreated by humans.\nOutside of the pulps, the alien invasion theme pioneered by Wells appeared in Olaf Stapledon's 1930 novel \"Last and First Men\"\u2014with the twist that the invading Martians are cloud-borne and microscopic, and neither aliens nor humans recognize the other as a sentient species. In film, this theme gained popularity in 1953 with the releases of \"The War of the Worlds\" and \"Invaders from Mars\"; later films about Martian invasions of Earth include the 1954 film \"Devil Girl from Mars\", the 1962 film \"The Day Mars Invaded Earth\", a 1986 remake of \"Invaders from Mars\" and three different adaptations of \"The War of the Worlds\" in 2005. Martians attacking humans who come to Mars appear in the 1948 short story \"Mars Is Heaven!\" by Ray Bradbury (later revised and included in \"The Martian Chronicles\" as \"The Third Expedition\"), where they use telepathic abilities to impersonate the humans' deceased loved ones before killing them. Comical portrayals of evil Martians appear in the 1954 novel \"Martians, Go Home\" by Fredric Brown, where they are little green men who wreak havoc by exposing secrets and lies; in the form of the cartoon character Marvin the Martian introduced in the 1948 short film \"Haredevil Hare\", who seeks to destroy Earth to get a better view of Venus; and in the 1996 film \"Mars Attacks!\", a pastiche of 1950s alien invasion films.\nDecadent.\nThe conception of Martians as decadent was largely derived from Percival Lowell's vision of Mars. The first appearance of Martians characterized by decadence in a work of fiction was in the 1905 novel ' by Edwin Lester Arnold\u2014variously considered one of the earliest examples of, or an important precursor to, the planetary romance subgenre. The idea was developed further and popularized by Edgar Rice Burroughs in the 1912\u20131943 \"Barsoom\" series starting with \"A Princess of Mars\". Burroughs presents a Mars in need of human intervention to regain its vitality, a place where violence has replaced sexual desire. Science fiction critic Robert Crossley, in the 2011 non-fiction book ', identifies Burroughs's work as the archetypal example of what he dubs \"masculinist fantasies\", where \"male travelers \"expect\" to find princesses on Mars and devote much of their time either to courting or to protecting them\". This version of Mars also functions as a kind of stand-in for the bygone American frontier, where protagonist John Carter\u2014a Confederate veteran of the American Civil War who is made superhumanly strong by the lower gravity of Mars\u2014encounters indigenous Martians representing Native Americans.\nBurroughs's vision of Mars would go on to have an influence approaching but not quite reaching Wells's, inspiring the works of many other authors\u2014for instance, C. L. Moore's stories about Northwest Smith starting with the 1933 short story \"Shambleau\". Another author who followed Burroughs's lead in the decadent portrayal of Mars and its inhabitants\u2014while updating the politics to reflect shifting attitudes toward colonialism and imperialism in the intervening years\u2014was Leigh Brackett, the \"Queen of the Planetary Romance\". Brackett's works in this vein include the 1940 short story \"Martian Quest\" and the 1944 novel \"Shadow Over Mars\", as well as the stories about Eric John Stark including the 1949 short story \"Queen of the Martian Catacombs\" and the 1951 short story \"Black Amazon of Mars\" (later expanded into the 1964 novels \"The Secret of Sinharat\" and \"People of the Talisman\", respectively).\nDecadent Martians appeared in many other stories as well. The 1933 novel \"Cat Country\" (\"\u8c93\u57ce\u8a18\") by Chinese science fiction writer Lao She portrays feline Martians overcome by vices such as opium addiction and corruption as a vehicle for satire of contemporary Chinese society. In the 1950 film \"Rocketship X-M\", Martians are depicted as disfigured cavepeople inhabiting a barren wasteland, descendants of the few survivors of a nuclear holocaust; in the 1963 novel \"The Man Who Fell to Earth\" by Walter Tevis a survivor of nuclear holocaust on Mars comes to Earth for refuge but finds it to be similarly corrupt and degenerate. Inverting the premise of Heinlein's \"Stranger in a Strange Land\", the 1963 short story \"A Rose for Ecclesiastes\" by Roger Zelazny sees decadent Martians visited by a preacher from Earth.\nPast and non-humanoid life.\nIn some stories where Mars is not inhabited by humanoid lifeforms, it was in the past or is inhabited by other types of life. The ruins of extinct Martian civilizations are depicted in the 1943 short story \"Lost Art\" by George O. Smith where their perpetual motion machine is recreated and the 1957 short story \"Omnilingual\" by H. Beam Piper in which scientists attempt to decipher their fifty-thousand-year-old language; the 1933 novel \"The Outlaws of Mars\" by Otis Adelbert Kline and the 1949 novel \"The Sword of Rhiannon\" by Leigh Brackett employ time travel to set stories in the past when Mars was still alive.\nThe 1934 short story \"A Martian Odyssey\" by Stanley G. Weinbaum contains what Webster describes as \"the first really alien aliens\" in science fiction, in contrast to previous depictions of Martians as monsters or essentially human. The story broke new ground in portraying an entire Martian ecosystem wholly unlike that of Earth\u2014inhabited by species that are alien in anatomy and inscrutable in behaviour\u2014and in depicting extraterrestrial life that is non-human and intelligent without being hostile. In particular, one Martian creature called Tweel is found to be intelligent but have thought processes that are utterly inhuman. This creates an impenetrable language barrier between the alien and the human it encounters, and they are limited to communicating through the universal language of mathematics. Asimov would later say that this story met the challenge science fiction editor John W. Campbell made to science fiction writers in the 1940s: to write a creature who thinks at least as well as humans, yet not \"like\" humans.\nThree different species of intelligent lifeforms appear on Mars in C. S. Lewis's 1938 novel \"Out of the Silent Planet\", only one of which is humanoid. In the 1943 short story \"The Cave\" by P. Schuyler Miller, lifeforms endure on Mars long after the civilization that used to exist there has driven itself to extinction through ecological collapse. The 1951 novel \"The Sands of Mars\" by Arthur C. Clarke features some indigenous life in the form of oxygen-producing plants and Martian creatures resembling Earth marsupials, but otherwise depicts a mostly desolate environment\u2014reflecting then-emerging data about the scarcity of life-sustaining resources on Mars. Other novels of the 1950s likewise limited themselves to rudimentary lifeforms such as lichens and tumbleweed that could conceivably exist in the absence of any appreciable atmosphere or quantities of water.\nLifeless Mars.\nIn light of the \"Mariner\" and \"Viking\" probes to Mars between 1965 and 1976 revealing the planet's inhospitable conditions, almost all fiction started to portray Mars as a lifeless world. The disappointment of finding Mars to be hostile to life is reflected in the 1970 novel \"Die Erde ist nah\" (\"The Earth Is Near\") by Czech science fiction writer Lud\u011bk Pe\u0161ek, which depicts the members of an astrobiological expedition on Mars driven to despair by the realization that their search for life there is futile. A handful of authors still found ways to place life on the red planet: microbial life exists on Mars in the 1977 novel \"The Martian Inca\" by Ian Watson, and intelligent life is found in hibernation there in the 1977 short story \"In the Hall of the Martian Kings\" by John Varley. By the turn of the millennium, the idea of microbial life on Mars gained popularity, appearing in the 1999 novel \"The Martian Race\" by Gregory Benford and the 2001 novel \"The Secret of Life\" by Paul J. McAuley.\nHuman survival.\nAs stories about an inhabited Mars fell out of favour in the mid-1900s amid mounting evidence of the planet's inhospitable nature, they were replaced by stories about enduring the harsh conditions of the planet. Themes in this tradition include colonization, terraforming, and pure survival stories.\nColonization.\nThe colonization of Mars became a major theme in science fiction in the 1950s. The central piece of Martian fiction in this era was Ray Bradbury's 1950 fix-up novel \"The Martian Chronicles\", which contains a series of loosely connected stories depicting the first few decades of human efforts to colonize Mars. Unlike later works on this theme, \"The Martian Chronicles\" makes no attempt at realism (Mars has a breathable atmosphere, for instance, even though spectrographic analysis had at that time revealed no detectable amounts of oxygen); Bradbury said that \"Mars is a mirror, not a crystal\", a vehicle for social commentary rather than attempts to predict the future. Contemporary issues touched upon in the book include McCarthyism in \"Usher II\", racial segregation and lynching in the United States in \"Way in the Middle of the Air\", and nuclear anxiety throughout. There are also several allusions to the European colonization of the Americas: the first few missions to Mars in the book encounter Martians, with direct references to both Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s and the Trail of Tears, but the indigenous population soon goes extinct due to chickenpox in a parallel to the virgin soil epidemics that devastated Native American populations as a result of the Columbian exchange.\nThe majority of works about colonizing Mars endeavoured to portray the challenges of doing so realistically. The hostile environment of the planet is countered by the colonists bringing life-support systems in works like the 1951 novel \"The Sands of Mars\" by Arthur C. Clarke and the 1966 short story \"We Can Remember It for You Wholesale\" by Philip K. Dick, the early colonists during the centuries-long terraforming process in the 1953 short story \"Crucifixus Etiam\" by Walter M. Miller Jr. are dependent on a machine that oxygenates their blood from the thin atmosphere, and the scarcity of oxygen even after generations of terraforming forces the colonists to live in a domed city in the 1953 novel \"Police Your Planet\" by Lester del Rey. In the 1955 fix-up novel \"Alien Dust\" by Edwin Charles Tubb, colonists are unable to return to a life on Earth because inhaling the Martian dust has given them pneumoconiosis and the lower gravity has atrophied their muscles. The 1952 novel \"Outpost Mars\" by Cyril Judd (joint pseudonym of Cyril M. Kornbluth and Judith Merril) revolves around an attempt at making a Mars colony economically sustainable by way of resource extraction.\nMars colonies seeking independence from or outright revolting against Earth is a recurring motif; in del Rey's \"Police Your Planet\" a revolution is precipitated by Earth using unrest against the colony's corrupt mayor as a pretext for bringing Mars under firmer Terran control, and in Tubb's \"Alien Dust\" the colonists threaten Earth with nuclear weapons unless their demands for necessary resources are met. In the 1952 short story \"The Martian Way\" by Isaac Asimov, Martian colonists extract water from the rings of Saturn so as not to depend on importing water from Earth. Besides direct conflicts with Earth, Mars colonies get other kinds of unfavourable treatment in several works. Mars is a dilapidated colony and neglected in favour of locations outside of the Solar System in the 1967 novel \"Born Under Mars\" by John Brunner, a place where political dissidents and criminals are exiled in \"Police Your Planet\", and the site of an outright prison colony in the 1966 novel \"Farewell, Earth's Bliss\" by David G. Compton. The vision of Mars as a prison colony recurs in Japanese science fiction author Moto Hagio's 1978\u20131979 manga series \"Star Red\" (\"\u30b9\u30bf\u30fc\u30fb\u30ec\u30c3\u30c9\"), a homage to Bradbury's \"The Martian Chronicles\". The independence theme was adopted by on-screen portrayals of Mars colonies in the 1990s in works like the 1990 film \"Total Recall\" (a loose adaptation of Dick's \"We Can Remember It for You Wholesale\") and the 1994\u20131998 television series \"Babylon 5\", now both in terms of Earth-based governments and\u2014likely inspired by the emergence of Reaganomics\u2014especially corporations.\nTerraforming.\nClarke's \"The Sands of Mars\" features one of the earliest depictions of terraforming Mars to make it more hospitable to human life; in the novel, the atmosphere of Mars is made breathable by plants that release oxygen from minerals in the Martian soil, and the climate is improved by creating an artificial sun. The theme appeared occasionally in other 1950s works like the aforementioned \"Crucifixus Etiam\" and \"Police Your Planet\", but largely fell out of favour in the 1960s as the scale of the associated challenges became apparent. By the 1970s, Martian literature as a whole had mostly succumbed to the discouragement of finding the planet's conditions to be so hostile, and stories set on Mars became much less common than they had been in previous decades.\nA resurgence of popularity of the terraforming theme began to emerge in the late 1970s in light of data from the \"Viking\" probes suggesting that there might be substantial quantities of non-liquid and sub-surface water on Mars; among the earliest such works are the 1977 novel \"The Martian Inca\" by Ian Watson and the 1978 novel \"A Double Shadow\" by Frederick Turner. Works depicting the terraforming of Mars continued to appear throughout the 1980s. The 1984 novel \"The Greening of Mars\" by James Lovelock and Michael Allaby, a study on how Mars might be settled and terraformed presented in the form of a fiction narrative, was influential on science and fiction alike. Kim Stanley Robinson was an early prolific writer on the subject with the 1982 short story \"Exploring Fossil Canyon\", the 1984 novel \"Icehenge\", and the 1985 short story \"Green Mars\". Turner revisited the concept in 1988 with \"Genesis\", a 10,000-line epic poem written in iambic pentameter, and Ian McDonald combined terraforming with magical realism in the 1988 novel \"Desolation Road\".\nBy the 1990s, terraforming had become the predominant theme in Martian fiction. Several methods for accomplishing it were depicted, including ancient alien artefacts in the 1990 film \"Total Recall\" and the 1997 novel \"Mars Underground\" by William Kenneth Hartmann, utilizing indigenous animal lifeforms in the 1991 novel \"Martian Rainbow\" by Robert L. Forward, and relocating the entire planet to a new solar system in the 1993 novel \"Moving Mars\" by Greg Bear. The 1993 novel \"Red Dust\" by Paul J. McAuley portrays Mars in the process of reverting to its natural state after an abandoned attempt at terraforming it. With a Mars settled primarily by China, \"Red Dust\" also belongs to a tradition of portraying a multicultural Mars that developed parallel to the rise to prominence of the terraforming theme. Other such works include the 1989 novel \"Crescent in the Sky\" by Donald Moffitt, where Arabs apply their experience with surviving in desert conditions to living in their new caliphate on a partially terraformed Mars, and the 1991 novel \"The Martian Viking\" by Tim Sullivan where Mars is terraformed by Geats led by Hygelac.\nThe most prominent work of fiction dealing with the subject of terraforming Mars is the \"Mars\" trilogy by Kim Stanley Robinson (consisting of the novels \"Red Mars\" from 1992, \"Green Mars\" from 1993, and \"Blue Mars\" from 1996), a hard science fiction story of a United Nations project wherein 100 carefully selected scientists are sent to Mars to start the first settlement there. The series explores in depth the practical and ideological considerations involved, the principal one being whether to turn Mars \"Green\" by terraforming or keep it in its pristine \"Red\" state. Other major topics besides the ethics of terraforming include the social and economic organization of the emerging Martian society and its political relationship to Earth and the multinational economic interests that finance the mission, revisiting the earlier themes of Mars as a setting for utopia\u2014albeit in this case one in the making rather than a pre-existing one\u2014and Martian struggle for independence from Earth. \nAlternatives to terraforming have also been explored. The opposite approach of modifying humans to adapt them to the existing environment, known as pantropy, appears in the 1976 novel \"Man Plus\" by Frederik Pohl but has otherwise been sparsely depicted. The conflict between pantropy and terraforming is explored in the 1994 novel \"Climbing Olympus\" by Kevin J. Anderson, as the humans that have been \"areoformed\" to survive on Mars do not wish the planet to be altered to accommodate unmodified humans at their expense. Other works where terraforming is eschewed in favour of alternatives include the 1996 novel \"River of Dust\" by Alexander Jablokov, where the settlers create a liveable environment by burrowing underground, and the 1999 novel \"\" by Brian Aldiss and Roger Penrose where environmental preservation is prioritized and humans live in domed cities.\nRobinsonades.\nMartian robinsonades\u2014stories of astronauts stranded on Mars\u2014emerged in the 1950s with works such as the 1952 novel \"Marooned on Mars\" by Lester del Rey, the 1956 novel \"No Man Friday\" by Rex Gordon, and the 1959 short story \"The Man Who Lost the Sea\" by Theodore Sturgeon. Crossley writes that \"No Man Friday\" is in some respects an \"anti-robinsonade\", inasmuch as it rejects the underlying colonialist attitudes and portrays the Martians as more advanced than humans rather than less. Robinsonades remained popular throughout the 1960s; examples include the 1966 novel \"Welcome to Mars\" by James Blish and the 1964 film \"Robinson Crusoe on Mars\", the latter being significantly if unofficially based on \"No Man Friday\". The subgenre was later revisited with the 2011 novel \"The Martian\" by Andy Weir and its 2015 film adaptation, in which an astronaut accidentally left behind by the third mission to Mars uses the resources available to him to survive until such a time that he can be rescued.\nNostalgic depictions.\nAlthough most stories by the middle of the 1900s acknowledged that advances in planetary science had rendered previous notions about the conditions of Mars obsolete and portrayed the planet accordingly, some continued to depict a romantic version of Mars rather than a realistic one. Besides the stories of Ray Bradbury's 1950 fix-up novel \"The Martian Chronicles\", another early example of this was Robert A. Heinlein's 1949 novel \"Red Planet\" where Mars has a breathable (albeit thin) atmosphere, a diverse ecosystem including sentient Martians, and Lowellian canals. Martian canals remained a prominent symbol of this more traditional vision of Mars, appearing both in lighthearted works like the 1954 novel \"Martians, Go Home\" by Fredric Brown and more serious ones like the 1963 novel \"The Man Who Fell to Earth\" by Walter Tevis and the 1964 novel \"Martian Time-Slip\" by Philip K. Dick. Some works attempted to reconcile both visions of Mars, one example being the 1952 novel \"Marooned on Mars\" by Lester del Rey where the presumed canals turn out to be rows of vegetables and the only animal life is primitive.\nAs the Space Age commenced the divide between portraying Mars as it was and as it had previously been imagined deepened, and the discoveries made by Mariner 4 in 1965 solidified it. Some authors simply ignored the scientific findings, such as Lin Carter who included intelligent Martians in the 1973 novel \"The Man Who Loved Mars\", and Leigh Brackett who declared in the foreword to \"The Coming of the Terrans\" (a 1967 collection of earlier short stories) that \"in the affairs of men and Martians, mere fact runs a poor second to Truth, which is mighty and shall prevail\". Others were cognizant of them and used workarounds: Frank Herbert invented the fictional extrasolar Mars-like planet Arrakis for the 1965 novel \"Dune\" rather than setting the story on Mars, Robert F. Young set the 1979 short story \"The First Mars Mission\" in 1957 so as not to have to take the findings of Mariner 4 into account, and Colin Greenland set the 1993 novel \"Harm's Way\" in the 1800s with corresponding scientific concepts like the luminiferous aether. The 1965 novel \"The Alternate Martians\" by A. Bertram Chandler is based on the premise that the depictions of Mars that appear in older stories are not incorrect but reflect alternative universes; the book is dedicated to \"the Mars that used to be, but never was\". The urge to recapture the romantic vision of Mars is reflected as part of the story in the 1968 novel \"Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?\" by Philip K. Dick, where the people living on a desolate Mars enjoy reading old stories about the lifeful Mars that never was, as well as in the 1989 novel \"The Barsoom Project\" by Steven Barnes and Larry Niven, where the fantastical version of Mars is recreated as an amusement park.\nFollowing the arrival of the \"Viking\" probes in 1976, the so-called \"Face on Mars\" superseded the Martian canals as the most central symbol of nostalgic depictions of Mars. The \"Face\" is a rock formation in the Cydonia region of Mars first photographed by the \"Viking 1\" orbiter under conditions that made it resemble a human face; higher-quality photographs taken by subsequent probes under different lighting conditions revealed this to be a case of pareidolia. It was popularized by Richard C. Hoagland, who interpreted it as an artificial construction by intelligent extraterrestrials, and has appeared in works of fiction including the 1992 novel \"Labyrinth of Night\" by Allen Steele, the 1995 short story \"The Great Martian Pyramid Hoax\" by Jerry Oltion, and the 1998 novel \"Semper Mars\" by Ian Douglas. Outside of literature, it has made appearances in the 1993 episode \"Space\" of \"The X-Files\", the 2000 film \"Mission to Mars\", and the 2002 episode \"Where the Buggalo Roam\" of the animated television show \"Futurama\".\nDeliberately nostalgic homages to older works have continued to appear through the turn of the millennium. In the 1999 novel \"Rainbow Mars\" by Larry Niven, a time traveller goes to visit Mars's past but instead appears in the parallel universe of Mars's fictional past and encounters the creations of science fiction authors such as H. G. Wells and Edgar Rice Burroughs. Stories collected in Peter Crowther's 2002 anthology \"Mars Probes\" pay tribute to the works of Stanley G. Weinbaum and Leigh Brackett, among others. The 2013 anthology \"Old Mars\" edited by George R. R. Martin and Gardner Dozois consists of newly written stories in the planetary romance style of older stories whose visions of Mars are now outdated; Martin compared it to the common practice of setting Westerns in a romanticized version of the Old West rather than a more realistic one.\nFirst landings and near-future human presence.\nStories about the first human mission to Mars became popular after US president George H. W. Bush announced the Space Exploration Initiative in 1989, which proposed to accomplish this feat by 2019, though the concept had earlier appeared indirectly in the 1977 film \"Capricorn One\", wherein NASA fakes the Mars landing. Among these are the 1992 novel \"Beachhead\" by Jack Williamson and the 1992 novel \"Mars\" in Ben Bova's \"Grand Tour\" series, both of which emphasize the barrenness of the Martian landscape upon arrival and contrast it with a desire to find beauty there. The idea was spoofed in the 1990 novel \"Voyage to the Red Planet\" by Terry Bisson, which posits that a mission like that could only get funding by being turned into a movie. Stephen Baxter's 1996 novel \"Voyage\" depicts an alternate history where US president John F. Kennedy was not assassinated in 1963, ultimately leading to the first Mars landing happening in 1986. The 1999 novel \"The Martian Race\" by Gregory Benford adapts the Mars Direct proposal by aerospace engineer Robert Zubrin to fiction by depicting a private sector competition to conduct the first crewed Mars landing with a large monetary reward attached. Zubrin would later write a story of his own along the same lines: the 2001 novel \"First Landing\". In a variation on the theme, Ian McDonald's 2002 short story \"The Old Cosmonaut and the Construction Worker Dream of Mars\" (included in the aforementioned anthology \"Mars Probes\") portrays the lingering yearning for Mars in a future where the intended first Mars landing was cancelled and the era of space exploration has come to an end without the dream of a human mission to Mars ever being realized.\nBeyond the events of the first crewed landing on Mars, this time period also saw an increase in portrayals of the early stages of exploration and settlement happening in the near future, especially following the 1996 launches of the \"Mars Pathfinder\" and \"Mars Global Surveyor\" probes. In the 1991 novel \"Red Genesis\" by S. C. Sykes, settlement of Mars begins in 2015, though the bulk of the narrative is set decades later and focuses on the social\u2014rather than technical\u2014challenges of the project. The 1997 novel \"Mars Underground\" by William K. Hartmann also deals with the early efforts of establishing a permanent human presence on the red planet. The members of the third human mission to Mars are forced to trek across the planet's surface in the 2000 novel \"Mars Crossing\" by Geoffrey A. Landis to reach a return vehicle from a previous mission after theirs is damaged beyond repair.\nIn the new millennium.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\n[Mars] offers an accessible and somewhat-known-but-somewhat-mysterious setting for all kinds of imaginative storylines. For this reason, video games love using Mars-related maps or themes \u2013 colonisation, space travel, dying and dystopian societies, scientific research settlements gone wrong, cosmic war, aliens, the unknown.\nNicky Jenner, \"4th Rock from the Sun: The Story of Mars\"\nIn the year 2000, Westfahl estimated the total number of works of fiction dealing with Mars up to that point to exceed five thousand. Depictions of Mars have remained common since then, though without a clear overarching trend\u2014rather, says \"The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction\", Mars fiction has \"ramified in several directions\". Monster movies set on Mars have appeared throughout this time period including the 2001 film \"Ghosts of Mars\", the 2005 film \"Doom\" (based on the video game franchise), and the 2013 film \"The Last Days on Mars\". In the 2003 novel \"Ilium\" by Dan Simmons and its 2005 sequel \"Olympos\", the Trojan War is reenacted on Mars, and the 2011 animated film \"Mars Needs Moms\" revisits the older theme of evil Martians coming to Earth, though with more modest ambitions than launching an all-out invasion. The 2011\u20132021 novel series \"The Expanse\" by James S. A. Corey (joint pseudonym of Daniel Abraham and Ty Franck), starting with \"Leviathan Wakes\", is a space opera set in part on Mars that was originally based on a role-playing game and later adapted to a television series starting in 2015. Tom Chmielewski's 2014 novel \"Lunar Dust, Martian Sands\" is a piece of noir fiction set partially on Mars. \"The Martian\"\u2014book and film\u2014is hard science fiction; the film adaptation was described by the production team as being \"as much science fact as science fiction\". The 100th anniversary of Burroughs's \"A Princess of Mars\" in 2012 saw the release of both the film adaptation \"John Carter\" and an anthology of new \"Barsoom\" fiction: \"\" edited by John Joseph Adams. In Polish science fiction, Rafa\u0142 Kosik's 2003 novel \"Mars\" depicts people migrating to Mars to escape an Earth ravaged by overpopulation, and an anthology of short stories titled \"Mars: Antologia polskiej fantastyki\" (\"Mars: An Anthology of Polish Fantasy\") was published in 2021. Mars has also made frequent appearances in video games; examples include the 2001 game \"Red Faction\" which is set on Mars and the 2014 game \"Destiny\" where Mars is an unlockable setting. In addition, Mars continues to make regular appearances in stories where it is not the main focus, such as Joe Haldeman's 2008 novel \"Marsbound\". Says Crossley, \"Where imagined Mars will go as the twenty-first century unfolds cannot be prophesied, because\u2014undoubtedly\u2014improbable, original, and masterful talents will work new variations on the matter of Mars.\"\nMoons.\nMars has two small moons, Phobos and Deimos, which were both discovered by Asaph Hall in 1877. The first appearance of the moons of Mars in fiction predates their discovery by a century and a half; the satirical 1726 novel \"Gulliver's Travels\" by Jonathan Swift includes a mention that the advanced astronomers of Laputa have discovered two Martian moons. The 1752 work \"Microm\u00e9gas\" by Voltaire likewise mentions two moons of Mars; astronomy historian William Sheehan surmises that Voltaire was inspired by Swift. German astronomer Eberhard Christian Kindermann, mistakenly believing that he had discovered a Martian moon, described a fictional voyage to it in the 1744 story \"Die Geschwinde Reise\" (\"The Speedy Journey\").\nThe moons' small sizes have made them unpopular settings in science fiction, with some exceptions such as the 1955 novel \"Phobos, the Robot Planet\" by Paul Capon and the 2001 short story \"Romance with Phobic Variations\" by Tom Purdom in the case of Phobos, and the 1936 short story \"Crystals of Madness\" by D. L. James in the case of Deimos. Phobos is turned into a small star to provide heat and light to Mars in the 1951 novel \"The Sands of Mars\" by Arthur C. Clarke. The moons are revealed to be alien spacecraft in the 1955 juvenile novel \"The Secret of the Martian Moons\" by Donald A. Wollheim.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The fruit has red and green skin, a tart flavor, and tender white flesh, which ripens in late September. An all-purpose apple, the McIntosh may be eaten raw, cooked, or used to make apple sauce.\nJohn McIntosh discovered the original McIntosh sapling on his Dundela farm in Upper Canada in 1811. He and his wife cultivated it, and the family started grafting the tree and selling the fruit in 1835. In 1870, it entered commercial production, and became common in Ontario, Quebec, New England, and New York after 1900. While still produced in large quantities, the fruit's popularity fell in the early 21st century in the face of competition from varieties such as the Ambrosia, Gala, and Honeycrisp. \nJef Raskin, an employee at Apple Computer, named the Macintosh computer line\u2014later abbreviated to \"Mac\" in 1999\u2014after the cultivar.\nDescription.\nThe McIntosh, or McIntosh Red (nicknamed the \"Mac\"), is the most popular apple cultivar in eastern Canada and the northeastern United States. It also sells well in Eastern Europe.\nA spreading tree that is moderately vigorous, the McIntosh bears annually or in alternate years. The tree is hardy to at least USDA Hardiness zone 4a, or . 50% or more of its flowers die at or below.\nThe McIntosh apple is a small to medium-sized round fruit with a short stem. It has a red and green skin that is thick, tender, and easy to peel. Its white flesh is sometime tinged with green or pink and is juicy, tender, and firm, soon becoming soft. The flesh is easily bruised.\nThe McIntosh is a general-purpose apple; it is suitable both for eating raw and for cooking. It is used primarily for dessert, and requires less time to cook than most cultivars. It is usually blended when used for juice or cider. It could also be used to make apple sauce and apple pie.\nThe fruit grows best in cool areas where nights are cold and autumn days are clear; otherwise, it suffers from poor colour and soft flesh, and tends to fall from the tree before harvest. It stores for two to three months in air, but is prone to scald, flesh softening, chilling sensitivity, and coprinus rot. It can become mealy when stored at temperatures below . The fruit is optimally stored in a controlled atmosphere in which temperatures are between , and air content is 1.5\u20134.5% oxygen and 1\u20135% carbon dioxide; under such conditions, the McIntosh will keep for five to eight months.\nCultivation.\nThe McIntosh is most commonly cultivated in Canada, the United States, and Eastern Europe. As of the 2020s, most of Canada's McIntosh came from Quebec and Ontario.38 South of the border, more than two thirds of McIntosh apples were harvested in New York State.20 It is one of the top five apple cultivars used in cloning, and research indicates the McIntosh combines well for winter hardiness.\nIf unsprayed, the McIntosh succumbs easily to apple scab, which may lead to entire crops being unmarketable. It has generally low susceptibility to fire blight, powdery mildew, cedar-apple rust, quince rust, and hawthorn rust. It is susceptible to fungal diseases such as \"Nectria\" canker, brown rot, black rot, race 1 of apple rust (but resists race 2). Furthermore, it is moderately resistant to \"Pezicula\" bark rot and \"Alternaria\" leaf blotch, and resists brown leaf spots well.\nThe McIntosh is harvested in the middle of September, roughly at the same time as the Gala and Honeycrisp.\nThe McIntosh is one of the most common cultivars used in apple breeding; a 1996 study found that the McIntosh was a parent in 101 of 439 cultivars selected, more than any other founding clone. It was used in over half of the Canadian cultivars selected, and was used extensively in the United States and Eastern Europe as well. But rarely was it used elsewhere. Offspring of the McIntosh include: the Macoun (with the Jersey Black), the Spartan, the Cortland (with the Ben Davis); the Empire (with the Red Delicious); the Jonamac, the Jersey Mac, the Lobo, the Melba, the Summered, the Tydeman's Red, and possibly the Paula Red.\nHistory.\nApple trees were introduced to Canada at the Habitation at Port-Royal as early as 1606 by French settlers. Following its introduction, apple cultivation spread inland.\nThe McIntosh's discoverer, John McIntosh (1777\u00a0\u2013\u00a0c.\u20091845\u201346), left his native Mohawk Valley home in New York State in 1796 to follow his love, Dolly Irwin, who had been taken to Upper Canada by her Loyalist parents. She had died by the time he found her, but he settled as a farmer in Upper Canada. He married Hannah Doran in 1801, and they farmed along the Saint Lawrence River until 1811, when McIntosh exchanged the land he had with his brother-in-law Edward Doran for a plot in Dundela.\nWhile clearing the overgrown plot, McIntosh discovered some apple seedlings on his farm. Since the crabapple was the only native apple in North America before European settlement, it must have had European origins. The Snow Apple (or Fameuse) had been popular in Lower Canada before that time; the seedlings may have sprouted from discarded fruit. Fall St Lawrence and Alexander have also been proposed, but the parentage remains unknown. He transplanted the seedlings next to his house. One of the seedlings bore particularly good fruit. The McIntosh grandchildren dubbed the fruit it produced \"Granny's apple\", as they often saw their grandmother taking care of the tree in the orchard. McIntosh was selling seedlings from the tree by 1820, but they did not produce fruit of the quality of the original.\nJohn McIntosh's son Allan (1815\u20131899) learned grafting about 1835; with this cloning, the McIntoshes could maintain the distinctive properties of the fruit of the original tree. Allan and brother Sandy (1825\u20131906), nicknamed \"Sandy the Grafter\", increased production and promotion of the cultivar. Earliest sales were in 1835, and in 1836 the cultivar was renamed the \"McIntosh Red\"; it entered commercial production in 1870. The apple became popular after 1900, when the first sprays for apple scab were developed. A house fire damaged the original McIntosh tree in 1894; it last produced fruit in 1908, and died and fell over in 1910.\nHorticulturist William Tyrrell Macoun of the Central Experimental Farm in Ottawa is credited with popularizing the McIntosh in Canada, praising it as \"one of the finest appearing and best dessert apples\" available at the time. The Macoun, a hybrid of the McIntosh and Jersey Black grown by the Agricultural Experiment Station in Geneva, New York, was named for him in 1923.\nThe original tree discovered by John McIntosh bore fruit for more than ninety years, and died in 1910. Horticulturalists from the Upper Canada Village heritage park saved cuttings from the last known first-generation McIntosh graft before it died in 2011 for producing clones.\nPopularity and sales.\nDuring the twentieth century, the McIntosh was the most popular cultivar in Eastern Canada and New England; it was also widely sold in the United Kingdom. The McIntosh made up 40% of the Canadian apple market by the 1960s; and at least thirty varieties of McIntosh hybrid were known by 1970. However, its market share declined to 28% in 2014 and is expected to continue to do so, in part due to production cost and in part due to consumers favoring sweeter, crisper, and less tart apple varieties. Its popularity has also waned in the face of competition from imports; in the first decade of the 21st century, the Gala (imported from Chile or the United States) accounted for 33% of the apple market in Ontario to the McIntosh's 12%, and the Northern Spy had become the preferred apple for pies. Production remained important to Ontario, however, as of McIntosh apples were produced in 2010. In Nova Scotia, apple orchardists reinvigorated their businesses during the late 2000s by replacing McIntosh and Cortland with newer varieties that brought in more money per bin, namely the Ambrosia, Gala, and especially the Honeycrisp. In Quebec, about two fifths of all apples harvested were McIntosh, as of 2020. Production remained relatively high in part because many orchardists were at the end of their careers with no successors, and as such were not keen to replace the McIntosh with newer varieties. A significant portion of McIntosh apples harvested in Quebec was sent for processing while the average retail price of a McIntosh was only a third that of a Honeycrisp. Nevertheless, the McIntosh is unlikely to disappear in the foreseeable future due to persistent residual demand for legacy varieties, which do not require royalties for cultivation and sales, unlike the newer managed varieties.\nIn the United States, the McIntosh was one of the most produced apples during the twentieth century, behind only the Red Delicious and the Golden Delicious. In the Northeastern United States, the McIntosh replaced many Baldwin trees that were killed in a severe winter in 1933\u201334. The McIntosh become the second most popular variety in the 1970s, after the Red Delicious. According to the US Apple Association, it remains one of the nine most popular apple cultivars in that country, as of 2025. By the 2020s, however, total production of the McIntosh, measured in bushels, has fallen behind that of a new variety, the Cosmic Crisp. Even in New York, which has traditionally favoured the McIntosh, production has fallen from about a quarter of the state's total volume in the 1980s to about 14 percent in the 2020s. The decline of older varieties like the McIntosh and Red Delicious follows the advent of newer varieties like the Honeycrisp, offering consumers sweeter and more complex tastes. They also risk becoming mere commodities\u2014that is, common and cheap products\u2014making it them less profitable for farmers and distributors.\nDescendant cultivars.\nO.P. = Open Pollinated\nCultural significance.\nThe McIntosh has been designated the national apple of Canada. A popular subscription funded a plaque placed from the original McIntosh tree in 1912. The Ontario Archaeological and Historic Sites Board replaced the plaque with a more descriptive one in 1962, and the Historic Sites and Monuments Board of Canada put up another in a park nearby in 2001, by a painted mural commemorating the fruit.\nApple Inc. employee Jef Raskin named the Macintosh line of personal computers after the McIntosh. He deliberately misspelled the name to avoid conflict with the hi-fi equipment manufacturer McIntosh Laboratory. Apple's attempt in 1982 to trademark the name Macintosh was nevertheless denied due to the phonetic similarity between Apple's product and the name of the hi-fi manufacturer. Apple licensed the rights to the name in 1983, and bought the trademark in 1986.\nIn 1995, the Royal Canadian Mint commissioned Toronto artist Roger Hill to design a commemorative silver dollar for release in 1996. Mint engraver Sheldon Beveridge engraved the image of a group of three McIntoshes and a McIntosh blossom, which adorn one side with a ribbon naming the variety. An inscription on the edge reads \"1796 Canada Dollar 1996\". Issued sheathed in a silver cardboard sleeve in a black leatherette case, 133,779 pieces of the proof were sold, as well as 58,834 pieces of the uncirculated version in a plastic capsule and silver sleeve.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nWorks cited.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The blade is typically long and usually under thick. In the Spanish language, the word is possibly a diminutive form of the word \"macho\", which was used to refer to sledgehammers. Alternatively, its origin may be \"machaera\", the name given by the Greeks and Romans to the falcata. It is the origin of the English language equivalent term \"matchet\", though this is rarely used. In much of the English-speaking Caribbean, such as Jamaica, Barbados, Guyana, Grenada, and Trinidad and Tobago, the term \"cutlass\" is used for these agricultural tools.\nUses.\nAgriculture.\nIn various tropical and subtropical countries, the machete is frequently used to cut through rainforest undergrowth and for agricultural purposes (e.g. cutting sugar cane). Besides this, in Latin America a common use is for such household tasks as cutting large foodstuffs into pieces\u2014much as a cleaver is used\u2014or to perform crude cutting tasks, such as making simple wooden handles for other tools. It is common to see people using machetes for other jobs, such as splitting open coconuts, yard work, removing small branches and plants, chopping animals' food, and clearing bushes.\nMachetes are often considered tools and used by adults. However, many hunter\u2013gatherer societies and cultures surviving through subsistence agriculture begin teaching babies to use sharp tools, including machetes, before their first birthdays.\nWarfare.\nPeople in uprisings sometimes use these weapons. For example, the Boricua Popular Army are unofficially called \"macheteros\" because of the machete-wielding laborers of sugar cane fields of past Puerto Rico.\nMany of the killings in the 1994 Rwandan genocide were performed with machetes, and they were the primary weapon used by the Interahamwe militias there. Machetes were also a distinctive tool and weapon of the Haitian \"Tonton Macoute\".\nIn 1762, the British captured Havana in a lengthy siege during the Seven Years' War. Volunteer militiamen led by Pepe Antonio, a Guanabacoa councilman, were issued with machetes during the unsuccessful defense of the city. The machete was also the most iconic weapon during the independence wars in Cuba, although it saw limited battlefield use. Carlos Manuel de C\u00e9spedes, owner of the sugar refinery \"La Demajagua\" near Manzanillo, freed his slaves on 10 October 1868. He proceeded to lead them, armed with machetes, in revolt against the Spanish government. The first cavalry charge using machetes as the primary weapon was carried out on 4 November 1868 by M\u00e1ximo G\u00f3mez, a sergeant born in the Dominican Republic, who later became the general in chief of the Cuban Army.\nThe machete is a common side arm and tool for many ethnic groups in West Africa. Machetes in this role are referenced in Chinua Achebe's \"Things Fall Apart\".\nSome countries have a name for the blow of a machete; the Spanish \"machetazo\" is sometimes used in English. In the British Virgin Islands, Grenada, Jamaica, Saint Kitts and Nevis, Barbados, Saint Lucia, and Trinidad and Tobago, the word \"planass\" means to hit someone with the flat of the blade of a machete or cutlass. To strike with the sharpened edge is to \"chop\". Throughout the English-speaking islands of the Caribbean, the term \"cutlass\" refers to a laborers' cutting tool.\nThe Brazilian Army's Instruction Center on Jungle Warfare developed a machete-style knife with a blade in length and a very pronounced clip point. This machete is issued with a Bowie knife and a sharpening stone in the scabbard, collectively called a \"jungle kit\" (\"Conjunto de Selva\" in Portuguese); it is manufactured by Ind\u00fastria de Material B\u00e9lico do Brasil (IMBEL).\nThe machete was used as a weapon during the Mau Mau rebellion, in the Rwandan Genocide, and in South Africa, particularly in the 1980s and early 1990s when the former province of Natal was wracked by conflict between the African National Congress and the Zulu-nationalist Inkatha Freedom Party.\nManufacture.\nGood machetes rely on the materials used and the shape. In the past, the most famous manufacturer of machetes in Latin America and the Spanish-speaking Caribbean was Collins Company of Collinsville, Connecticut. The company was founded as Collins &amp; Company in 1826 by Samuel W. Collins to make axes. Its first machetes were sold in 1845 and became so famous that a machete was called . In the English-speaking Caribbean, Robert Mole &amp; Sons of Birmingham, England, was long considered the manufacturer of agricultural cutlasses of the best quality. Some Robert Mole blades survive as souvenirs of travellers to Trinidad, Jamaica, and, less commonly, St. Lucia.\nColombia is the largest exporter of machetes worldwide.\nCultural influence.\nThe flag of Angola features a machete, along with a cog-wheel as communist symbols.\nThe emblem of Iran features a machete, along with four crescents and shaddah.\nThe southern Brazilian state of Rio Grande do Sul has a dance called the \"dan\u00e7a dos fac\u00f5es\" (machetes' dance) in which the dancers, who are usually men, bang their machetes against various surfaces while dancing, simulating a battle. \"Maculel\u00ea\", an Afro-Brazilian dance and martial art, can also be performed with \"fac\u00f5es\". This practice began in the city of Santo Amaro, Bahia, in the northeastern part of the country.\nIn the Jalisco region of Mexico, Los Machetes is a popular folk dance. This dance tells the story of cutting down sugar cane during the harvest. Los Machetes was created by Mexican farm workers who spent a great amount of time perfecting the use of the tool, the machete, for harvesting. Traditionally, real machetes are used while performing this dance.\nSimilar tools.\nThe panga or \"tapanga\" is a variant used in East and Southern Africa. This name may be of Swahili etymology; not to be confused with the panga fish. The \"panga\" blade broadens on the backside and has a length of . The upper inclined portion of the blade may be sharpened.\nIn the Philippines, the various indigenous swords and knives (known under the general term bolo) are commonly incorrectly described as a type of machete (as \"bolo machete\"). But bolos are unrelated to the machete. They are pre-colonial and hand-forged (unlike mass-produced machetes), with distinct types that differ by ethnic group. The most obvious difference is the shape of the cutting edge, which is typically curved in bolos and more or less straight in machetes. Bolos are also usually shorter than machetes, at around long, and are adapted to a wider range of uses.\nOther similar tools include the \"parang\" and the \"golok\" (from Malaysia and Indonesia); however, these tend to have shorter, thicker blades with a primary grind, and are more effective on woody vegetation.\nThe tsakat is a similar tool used in Armenia for clearing land of vegetation.\nOther similar tools include:\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "20264", "revid": "22604547", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20264", "title": "Mushroom", "text": "Spore-bearing fruiting body of a fungus\nA mushroom is the fleshy, spore-bearing fruiting body of a fungus, typically produced above ground on soil or another food source. A toadstool generally refers to a poisonous mushroom.\nThe standard for the name \"mushroom\" is the cultivated white button mushroom, \"Agaricus bisporus\"; hence, the word \"mushroom\" is most often applied to those fungi (Basidiomycota, Agaricomycetes) that have a stem (stipe), a cap (pileus), and gills (lamellae, sing. lamella) on the underside of the cap. \"Mushroom\" also describes a variety of other gilled fungi, with or without stems; therefore the term is used to describe the fleshy fruiting bodies of some Ascomycota. The gills produce microscopic spores which help the fungus spread across the ground or its occupant surface.\nForms deviating from the standard morphology usually have more specific names, such as \"bolete\", \"truffle\", \"puffball\", \"stinkhorn\", and \"morel\", and gilled mushrooms themselves are often called \"agarics\" in reference to their similarity to \"Agaricus\" or their order Agaricales.\nEtymology.\nThe terms \"mushroom\" and \"toadstool\" go back centuries and were never precisely defined, nor was there consensus on application. During the 15th and 16th centuries, the terms \"mushrom, mushrum, muscheron, mousheroms, mussheron, or musserouns\" were used.\nThe term \"mushroom\" and its variations may have been derived from the French word \"mousseron\" in reference to moss (\"mousse\"). Delineation between edible and poisonous fungi is not clear-cut, so a \"mushroom\" may be edible, poisonous, or unpalatable. The word \"toadstool\" appeared first in 14th-century England as a reference for a \"stool\" for toads, possibly implying an inedible poisonous fungus, an association it carries in modern terminology.\nIdentification.\nIdentifying what is and is not a mushroom requires a basic understanding of their macroscopic structure. Most are basidiomycetes and gilled. Their spores, called basidiospores, are produced on the gills and fall in a fine rain of powder from under the caps as a result. At the microscopic level, the basidiospores are shot off basidia and then fall between the gills in the dead air space. As a result, for most mushrooms, if the cap is cut off and placed gill-side-down overnight, a powdery impression reflecting the shape of the gills (or pores, or spines, etc.) is formed (when the fruit body is sporulating). The color of the powdery print, called a spore print, is useful in both classifying and identifying mushrooms. Spore print colors include white (most common), brown, black, purple-brown, pink, yellow, and creamy, but almost never blue, green, or red.\nWhile modern identification of mushrooms is quickly becoming molecular, the standard methods for identification are still used by most and have developed into a fine art harking back to medieval times and the Victorian era, combined with microscopic examination. The presence of juices upon breaking, bruising-reactions, odors, tastes, shades of color, habitat, habit, and season are all considered by both amateur and professional mycologists. Tasting and smelling mushrooms carries its own hazards because of poisons and allergens. Chemical tests are also used for some genera.\nIn general, identification to genus can often be accomplished in the field using a local field guide. Identification to species, however, requires more effort. A mushroom develops from a button stage into a mature structure, and only the latter can provide certain characteristics needed for the identification of the species. However, over-mature specimens lose features and cease producing spores. Many novices have mistaken humid water marks on paper for white spore prints, or discolored paper from oozing liquids on lamella edges for colored spored prints.\nClassification.\nTypical mushrooms are the fruit bodies of members of the order Agaricales, whose type genus is \"Agaricus\" and type species is the field mushroom, \"Agaricus campestris\". However in modern molecularly defined classifications, not all members of the order Agaricales produce mushroom fruit bodies, and many other gilled fungi, collectively called mushrooms, occur in other orders of the class Agaricomycetes. For example, chanterelles are in the Cantharellales, false chanterelles such as \"Gomphus\" are in the Gomphales, milk-cap mushrooms (\"Lactarius\", \"Lactifluus\") and russulas (\"Russula\"), as well as \"Lentinellus\", are in the Russulales, while the tough, leathery genera \"Lentinus\" and \"Panus\" are among the Polyporales, but \"Neolentinus\" is in the Gloeophyllales, and the little pin-mushroom genus, \"Rickenella\", along with similar genera, are in the Hymenochaetales.\nWithin the main body of mushrooms, in the Agaricales, are common fungi like the common fairy-ring mushroom, shiitake, enoki, oyster mushrooms, fly agarics and other Amanitas, magic mushrooms like species of \"Psilocybe\", paddy straw mushrooms, shaggy manes, etc.\nAn atypical mushroom is the lobster mushroom, which is a fruit body of a \"Russula\" or \"Lactarius\" mushroom that has been deformed by the parasitic fungus \"Hypomyces lactifluorum\". This gives the affected mushroom an unusual shape and red color that resembles that of a boiled lobster.\nOther mushrooms are not gilled, so the term \"mushroom\" is loosely used, and giving a full account of their classifications is difficult. Some have pores underneath (and are usually called boletes), others have spines, such as the hedgehog mushroom and other tooth fungi, and so on. \"Mushroom\" has been used for polypores, puffballs, jelly fungi, coral fungi, bracket fungi, stinkhorns, and cup fungi. Thus, the term is more one of common application to macroscopic fungal fruiting bodies than one having precise taxonomic meaning. Approximately 14,000 species of mushrooms are described.\nMorphology.\nA mushroom develops from a nodule, or pinhead, less than two millimeters in diameter, called a primordium, which is typically found on or near the surface of the substrate. It is formed within the mycelium, the mass of threadlike hyphae that make up the fungus. The primordium enlarges into a roundish structure of interwoven hyphae roughly resembling an egg, called a \"button\". The button has a cottony roll of mycelium, the universal veil, that surrounds the developing fruit body. As the egg expands, the universal veil ruptures and may remain as a cup, or volva, at the base of the stalk, or as warts or volval patches on the cap. Many mushrooms lack a universal veil, therefore they do not have either a volva or volval patches. Often, a second layer of tissue, the partial veil, covers the blade-like gills that bear spores. As the cap expands the veil breaks, and remnants of the partial veil may remain as a ring, or annulus, around the middle of the stalk or as fragments hanging from the margin of the cap. The ring may be skirt-like as in some species of \"Amanita\", collar-like as in many species of \"Lepiota\", or merely the faint remnants of a cortina (a partial veil composed of filaments resembling a spiderweb), which is typical of the genus \"Cortinarius\". Mushrooms lacking partial veils do not form an annulus.\nThe stalk (also called the stipe, or stem) may be central and support the cap in the middle, or it may be off-center or lateral, as in species of \"Pleurotus\" and \"Panus\". In other mushrooms, a stalk may be absent, as in the polypores that form shelf-like brackets. Puffballs lack a stalk, but may have a supporting base. Other mushrooms including truffles, jellies, earthstars, and bird's nests usually do not have stalks, and a specialized mycological vocabulary exists to describe their parts.\nThe way the gills attach to the top of the stalk is an important feature of mushroom morphology. Mushrooms in the genera \"Agaricus\", \"Amanita\", \"Lepiota\" and \"Pluteus\", among others, have free gills that do not extend to the top of the stalk. Others have decurrent gills that extend down the stalk, as in the genera \"Omphalotus\" and \"Pleurotus\". There are a great number of variations between the extremes of free and decurrent, collectively called attached gills. Finer distinctions are often made to distinguish the types of attached gills: adnate gills, which adjoin squarely to the stalk; notched gills, which are notched where they join the top of the stalk; adnexed gills, which curve upward to meet the stalk, and so on. These distinctions between attached gills are sometimes difficult to interpret, since gill attachment may change as the mushroom matures, or with different environmental conditions.\nMicroscopic features.\nA hymenium is a layer of microscopic spore-bearing cells that covers the surface of gills. In the nongilled mushrooms, the hymenium lines the inner surfaces of the tubes of boletes and polypores, or covers the teeth of spine fungi and the branches of corals. In the Ascomycota, spores develop within microscopic elongated, sac-like cells called asci, which typically contain eight spores in each ascus. The Discomycetes, which contain the cup, sponge, brain, and some club-like fungi, develop an exposed layer of asci, as on the inner surfaces of cup fungi or within the pits of morels. The Pyrenomycetes, tiny dark-colored fungi that live on a wide range of substrates including soil, dung, leaf litter, and decaying wood, as well as other fungi, produce minute, flask-shaped structures called perithecia, within which the asci develop.\nIn the basidiomycetes, usually four spores develop on the tips of thin projections called sterigmata, which extend from club-shaped cells called a basidia. The fertile portion of the Gasteromycetes, called a gleba, may become powdery as in the puffballs or slimy as in the stinkhorns. Interspersed among the asci are threadlike sterile cells called paraphyses. Similar structures called cystidia often occur within the hymenium of the Basidiomycota. Many types of cystidia exist, and assessing their presence, shape, and size is often used to verify the identification of a mushroom.\nThe most important microscopic feature for identification of mushrooms is the spores. Their color, shape, size, attachment, ornamentation, and reaction to chemical tests often can be the crux of an identification. A spore often has a protrusion at one end, called an apiculus, which is the point of attachment to the basidium, termed the apical germ pore, from which the hypha emerges when the spore germinates.\nGrowth.\nMany species of mushrooms seemingly appear overnight, growing or expanding rapidly. This phenomenon is the source of several common expressions in the English language including \"to mushroom\" or \"mushrooming\" (expanding rapidly in size or scope) and \"to pop up like a mushroom\" (to appear unexpectedly and quickly). In reality, all species of mushrooms take several days to form primordial mushroom fruit bodies, though they do expand rapidly by the absorption of fluids.\nThe cultivated mushroom, as well as the common field mushroom, initially form a minute fruiting body, referred to as the pin stage because of their small size. Slightly expanded, they are called buttons, once again because of the relative size and shape. Once such stages are formed, the mushroom can rapidly pull in water from its mycelium and expand, mainly by inflating preformed cells that took several days to form in the primordia.\nSimilarly, there are other mushrooms, like \"Parasola plicatilis\" (formerly \"Coprinus plicatlis\"), that grow rapidly overnight and may disappear by late afternoon on a hot day after rainfall. The primordia form at ground level in lawns in humid spaces under the thatch and after heavy rainfall or in dewy conditions balloon to full size in a few hours, release spores, and then collapse.\nNot all mushrooms expand overnight; some grow very slowly and add tissue to their fruiting bodies by growing from the edges of the colony or by inserting hyphae. For example, \"Pleurotus nebrodensis\" grows slowly, and because of this combined with human collection, it is now critically endangered.\nThough mushroom fruiting bodies are short-lived, the underlying mycelium can itself be long-lived and massive. A colony of \"Armillaria solidipes\" (formerly known as \"Armillaria ostoyae\") in Malheur National Forest in the United States is estimated to be 2,400 years old, possibly older, and spans an estimated . Most of the fungus is underground and in decaying wood or dying tree roots in the form of white mycelia combined with black shoelace-like rhizomorphs that bridge colonized separated woody substrates.\nNutrition.\nRaw brown mushrooms are 92% water, 4% carbohydrates, 2% protein and less than 1% fat. In a amount, raw mushrooms provide 22 calories and are a rich source (20% or more of the Daily Value, DV) of B\u00a0vitamins, such as riboflavin, niacin and pantothenic acid, selenium (37%\u00a0DV) and copper (25%\u00a0DV), and a moderate source (10\u201319%\u00a0DV) of phosphorus, zinc and potassium. They have minimal or no vitamin\u00a0C and sodium content.\nVitamin D.\nThe vitamin D content of a mushroom depends on postharvest handling, in particular the unintended exposure to sunlight. The US Department of Agriculture provided evidence that UV-exposed mushrooms contain substantial amounts of vitamin D. When exposed to ultraviolet (UV) light, even after harvesting, ergosterol in mushrooms is converted to vitamin D2, a process now used intentionally to supply fresh vitamin D mushrooms for the functional food grocery market. In a comprehensive safety assessment of producing vitamin D in fresh mushrooms, researchers showed that artificial UV light technologies were equally effective for vitamin D production as in mushrooms exposed to natural sunlight, and that UV light has a long record of safe use for production of vitamin D in food.\nHuman use.\nEdible mushrooms.\nMushrooms are used extensively in cooking, in many cuisines (notably Chinese, Korean, European, and Japanese). Humans have valued them as food since antiquity.\nMost mushrooms sold in supermarkets have been commercially grown on mushroom farms. The most common of these, \"Agaricus bisporus\", is considered safe for most people to eat because it is grown in controlled, sterilized environments. Several varieties of \"A.\u00a0bisporus\" are grown commercially, including whites, crimini, and portobello. Other cultivated species available at many grocers include \"Hericium erinaceus\", shiitake, maitake (hen-of-the-woods), \"Pleurotus\", and enoki. In recent years, increasing affluence in developing countries has led to a considerable growth in interest in mushroom cultivation, which is now seen as a potentially important economic activity for small farmers.\nChina is a major edible mushroom producer. The country produces about half of all cultivated mushrooms, and around of mushrooms are consumed per person per year by 1.4\u00a0billion people. In 2014, Poland was the world's largest mushroom exporter, reporting an estimated annually.\nSeparating edible from poisonous species requires meticulous attention to detail; there is no single trait by which all toxic mushrooms can be identified, nor one by which all edible mushrooms can be identified. People who collect mushrooms for consumption are known as mycophagists, and the act of collecting them for such is known as mushroom hunting, or simply \"mushrooming\". Even edible mushrooms may produce allergic reactions in susceptible individuals, from a mild asthmatic response to severe anaphylactic shock. Even the cultivated \"A.\u00a0bisporus\" contains small amounts of hydrazines, the most abundant of which is agaritine (a mycotoxin and carcinogen). However, the hydrazines are destroyed by moderate heat when cooking.\nA number of species of mushrooms are poisonous; although some resemble certain edible species, consuming them could be fatal. Eating mushrooms gathered in the wild is risky and should only be undertaken by individuals knowledgeable in mushroom identification. Common best practice is for wild mushroom pickers to focus on collecting a small number of visually distinctive, edible mushroom species that cannot be easily confused with poisonous varieties. Common mushroom hunting advice is that if a mushroom cannot be positively identified, it should be considered poisonous and not eaten.\nToxic mushrooms.\nMany mushroom species produce secondary metabolites that can be toxic, mind-altering, antibiotic, antiviral, or bioluminescent. Although there are only a small number of deadly species, several others can cause particularly severe and unpleasant symptoms. Toxicity likely plays a role in protecting the function of the basidiocarp: the mycelium has expended considerable energy and protoplasmic material to develop a structure to efficiently distribute its spores. One defense against consumption and premature destruction is the evolution of chemicals that render the mushroom inedible, either causing the consumer to vomit the meal (see emetics), or to learn to avoid consumption altogether. In addition, due to the propensity of mushrooms to absorb heavy metals, including those that are radioactive, as late as 2008, European mushrooms may have included toxicity from the 1986 Chernobyl disaster and continued to be studied.\nPsychoactive mushrooms.\nMushrooms with psychoactive properties have long played a role in various native medicine traditions in cultures all around the world. They have been used as sacrament in rituals aimed at mental and physical healing, and to facilitate visionary states. One such ritual is the \"velada\" ceremony. A practitioner of traditional mushroom use is the \"shaman\" or \"curandera\" (priest-healer).\nPsilocybin mushrooms, also referred to as psychedelic mushrooms, possess psychedelic properties. Commonly known as \"magic mushrooms\" or \"'shrooms\", they are openly available in smart shops in many parts of the world, or on the black market in those countries which have outlawed their sale. Psilocybin mushrooms have been reported to facilitate profound and life-changing insights often described as mystical experiences. Recent scientific work has supported these claims, as well as the long-lasting effects of such induced spiritual experiences.\nPsilocybin, a naturally occurring chemical in certain psychedelic mushrooms such as \"Psilocybe cubensis\", is being studied for its ability to help people suffering from psychological disorders, such as obsessive\u2013compulsive disorder. Minute amounts have been reported to stop cluster and migraine headaches. A double-blind study, done by Johns Hopkins Hospital, showed psychedelic mushrooms could provide people an experience with substantial personal meaning and spiritual significance. In the study, one third of the subjects reported ingestion of psychedelic mushrooms was the single most spiritually significant event of their lives. Over two-thirds reported it among their five most meaningful and spiritually significant events. On the other hand, one-third of the subjects reported extreme anxiety. However the anxiety went away after a short period of time. Psilocybin mushrooms have also shown to be successful in treating addiction, specifically with alcohol and cigarettes.\nA few species in the genus \"Amanita\", most recognizably \"A. muscaria\", but also \"A. pantherina\", among others, contain the psychoactive compound muscimol. The muscimol-containing chemotaxonomic group of \"Amanitas\" contains no amatoxins or phallotoxins, and as such are not hepatoxic, though if not properly cured will be non-lethally neurotoxic due to the presence of ibotenic acid. The \"Amanita\" intoxication is similar to Z-drugs in that it includes CNS depressant and sedative-hypnotic effects, but also dissociation and delirium in high doses.\nA third type of hallucinogenic mushroom is hallucinogenic bolete mushrooms such as \"Lanmaoa asiatica\", which are said to cause people to experience Lilliputian hallucinations. These mushrooms have unknown constituents and an unknown mechanism of action, but appear to be distinct in their properties and effects from other hallucinogenic mushrooms and are currently being researched.\nFolk medicine.\nSome mushrooms are used in folk medicine. In a few countries, extracts, such as polysaccharide-K, schizophyllan, polysaccharide peptide, or lentinan, are government-registered adjuvant cancer therapies, but clinical evidence for efficacy and safety of these extracts in humans has not been confirmed. Although some mushroom species or their extracts may be consumed for therapeutic effects, some regulatory agencies, such as the US Food and Drug Administration, regard such use as a dietary supplement, which does not have government approval or common clinical use as a prescription drug.\nOther uses.\nMushrooms can be used for dyeing wool and other natural fibers. The chromophores of mushroom dyes are organic compounds and produce strong and vivid colors, and all colors of the spectrum can be achieved with mushroom dyes. Before the invention of synthetic dyes, mushrooms were the source of many textile dyes.\nSome fungi, types of polypores loosely called mushrooms, have been used as fire starters (known as tinder fungi).\nMushrooms and other fungi play a role in the development of new biological remediation techniques (e.g., using mycorrhizae to spur plant growth) and filtration technologies (e.g. using fungi to lower bacterial levels in contaminated water).\nThere is an ongoing research in the field of genetic engineering aimed towards creation of the enhanced qualities of mushrooms for such domains as nutritional value enhancement, as well as medical use.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

A mainframe computer is large but not as large as a supercomputer and has more processing power than some other classes of computers, such as minicomputers, workstations, and personal computers. Most large-scale computer-system architectures were established in the 1960s, but they continue to evolve. Mainframe computers are often used as servers.\nThe term \"mainframe\" was derived from the large cabinet, called a \"main frame\", that housed the central processing unit and main memory of early computers. Later, the term \"mainframe\" was used to distinguish high-end commercial computers from less powerful machines.\nDesign.\nModern mainframe design is characterized less by raw computational speed and more by:\nThe high stability and reliability of mainframes enable these machines to run uninterrupted for very long periods of time, with mean time between failures (MTBF) measured in decades.\nMainframes have high availability, one of the primary reasons for their longevity, since they are typically used in applications where downtime would be costly or catastrophic. The term reliability, availability and serviceability (RAS) is a defining characteristic of mainframe computers. Proper planning and implementation are required to realize these features. In addition, mainframes are more secure than other computer types: the NIST vulnerabilities database, US-CERT, rates traditional mainframes such as IBM Z (previously called z Systems, System z, and zSeries), Unisys Dorado, and Unisys Libra as among the most secure, with vulnerabilities in the low single digits, as compared to thousands for Windows, UNIX, and Linux. Software upgrades usually require setting up the operating system or portions thereof, and are non disruptive only when using virtualizing facilities such as IBM z/OS and Parallel Sysplex, or Unisys XPCL, which support workload sharing so that one system can take over another's application while it is being refreshed.\nIn the late 1950s, mainframes had only a rudimentary interactive interface (the console) and used sets of punched cards, paper tape, or magnetic tape to transfer data and programs. They operated in batch mode to support back office functions such as payroll and customer billing, most of which were based on repeated tape-based sorting and merging operations followed by line printing to preprinted continuous stationery. When interactive user terminals were introduced, they were used almost exclusively for applications (e.g. airline booking) rather than program development. However, in 1961 the first academic, general-purpose timesharing system that supported software development, CTSS, was released at MIT on an IBM 709, later 7090 and 7094. Typewriter and Teletype devices were common control consoles for system operators through the early 1970s, although ultimately supplanted by keyboard/display devices.\nBy the early 1970s, many mainframes acquired interactive user terminals operating as timesharing computers, supporting hundreds of users simultaneously along with batch processing. Users gained access through keyboard/typewriter terminals and later character-mode text terminal CRT displays with integral keyboards, or finally from personal computers equipped with terminal emulation software. By the 1980s, many mainframes supported general purpose graphic display terminals, and terminal emulation, but not graphical user interfaces. This form of end-user computing became obsolete in the 1990s due to the advent of personal computers provided with GUIs. After 2000, modern mainframes partially or entirely phased out classic \"green screen\" and color display terminal access for end-users in favour of Web-style user interfaces.\nThe infrastructure requirements were drastically reduced during the mid-1990s, when CMOS mainframe designs replaced the older bipolar technology. IBM claimed that its newer mainframes reduced data center energy costs for power and cooling, and reduced physical space requirements compared to server farms.\nCharacteristics.\nModern mainframes can run multiple different instances of operating systems at the same time. This technique of virtual machines allows applications to run as if they were on physically distinct computers. In this role, a single mainframe can replace higher-functioning hardware services available to conventional servers. While mainframes pioneered this capability, virtualization is now available on most families of computer systems, though not always to the same degree or level of sophistication.\nMainframes can add or hot swap system capacity without disrupting system function, with specificity and granularity to a level of sophistication not usually available with most server solutions. Modern mainframes, notably the IBM Z servers, offer two levels of virtualization: logical partitions (LPARs, via the PR/SM facility) and virtual machines (via the z/VM operating system). Many mainframe customers run two machines: one in their primary data center and one in their backup data center\u2014fully active, partially active, or on standby\u2014in case there is a catastrophe affecting the first building. Test, development, training, and production workload for applications and databases can run on a single machine, except for extremely large demands where the capacity of one machine might be limiting. Such a two-mainframe installation can support continuous business service, avoiding both planned and unplanned outages. In practice, many customers use multiple mainframes linked either by Parallel Sysplex and shared DASD (in IBM's case), or with shared, geographically dispersed storage provided by EMC or Hitachi.\nMainframes are designed to handle very high volume input and output (I/O) and emphasize throughput computing. Since the late 1950s, mainframe designs have included subsidiary hardware (called \"channels\" or \"peripheral processors\") which manage the I/O devices, leaving the CPU free to deal only with high-speed memory. It is common in mainframe shops to deal with massive databases and files. Gigabyte to terabyte-size record files are not unusual. Compared to a typical PC, mainframes commonly have hundreds to thousands of times as much data storage online, and can access it reasonably quickly. Other server families also offload I/O processing and emphasize throughput computing.\nMainframe return on investment (ROI), like any other computing platform, is dependent on its ability to scale, support mixed workloads, reduce labor costs, deliver uninterrupted service for critical business applications, and several other risk-adjusted cost factors.\nMainframes also have execution integrity characteristics for fault tolerant computing. For example, z900, z990, System z9, and System z10 servers effectively execute result-oriented instructions twice, compare results, arbitrate between any differences (through instruction retry and failure isolation), then shift workloads \"in flight\" to functioning processors, including spares, without any impact to operating systems, applications, or users. This hardware-level feature, also found in HP's NonStop systems, is known as lock-stepping, because both processors take their \"steps\" (i.e. instructions) together. Not all applications absolutely need the assured integrity that these systems provide, but many do, such as financial transaction processing.\nCurrent market.\nIBM, with the IBM Z series, continues to be a major manufacturer in the mainframe market. In 2000, Hitachi co-developed the zSeries z900 with IBM to share expenses, and the latest Hitachi AP10000 models are made by IBM. Unisys manufactures ClearPath Libra mainframes, based on earlier Burroughs MCP products and ClearPath Dorado mainframes based on Sperry Univac OS 1100 product lines. Hewlett Packard Enterprise sells its unique NonStop systems, which it acquired with Tandem Computers and which some analysts classify as mainframes. Groupe Bull's GCOS, Stratus OpenVOS, Fujitsu (formerly Siemens) BS2000, and Fujitsu-ICL VME mainframes are still available in Europe, and Fujitsu (formerly Amdahl) GS21 mainframes globally. NEC with ACOS and Hitachi with AP10000-VOS3 still maintain mainframe businesses in the Japanese market.\nThe amount of vendor investment in mainframe development varies with market share. Fujitsu and Hitachi both continue to use custom S/390-compatible processors, as well as other CPUs (including POWER and Xeon) for lower-end systems. Bull uses a mixture of Itanium and Xeon processors. NEC uses Xeon processors for its low-end ACOS-2 line, but develops the custom NOAH-6 processor for its high-end ACOS-4 series. IBM also develops custom processors in-house, such as the Telum. Unisys produces code compatible mainframe systems that range from laptops to cabinet-sized mainframes that use homegrown CPUs as well as Xeon processors. Furthermore, there exists a market for software applications to manage the performance of mainframe implementations. In addition to IBM, significant market competitors include BMC and Precisely; former competitors include Compuware and CA Technologies.\nHistory.\nSeveral manufacturers and their successors produced mainframe computers from the 1950s until the early 21st century, with gradually decreasing numbers and a gradual transition to simulation on Intel chips rather than proprietary hardware. The US group of manufacturers was first known as \"IBM and the Seven Dwarfs\": usually Burroughs, UNIVAC, NCR, Control Data, Honeywell, General Electric and RCA, although some lists varied. Later, with the departure of General Electric and RCA, it was referred to as IBM and the BUNCH. IBM's dominance grew out of their 700/7000 series and, later, the development of the 360 series mainframes. The latter architecture has continued to evolve into their current zSeries mainframes which, along with the then Burroughs and Sperry (now Unisys) MCP-based and OS1100 mainframes, are among the few mainframe architectures still extant that can trace their roots to this early period. While IBM's zSeries can still run 24-bit System/360 code, the 64-bit IBM Z CMOS servers have nothing physically in common with the older systems. Notable manufacturers outside the US were Siemens and Telefunken in Germany, ICL in the United Kingdom, Olivetti in Italy, and Fujitsu, Hitachi, Oki, and NEC in Japan. The Soviet Union and Warsaw Pact countries manufactured close copies of IBM mainframes during the Cold War; the BESM series and Strela are examples of independently designed Soviet computers. Elwro in Poland was another Eastern Bloc manufacturer, producing the ODRA, R-32 and R-34 mainframes.\nShrinking demand and tough competition started a shakeout in the market in the early 1970s\u2014RCA sold out to UNIVAC and GE sold its business to Honeywell; between 1986 and 1990 Honeywell was bought out by Bull; UNIVAC became a division of Sperry, which later merged with Burroughs to form Unisys Corporation in 1986.\nIn 1984, estimated sales of desktop computers ($11.6 billion) exceeded mainframe computers ($11.4 billion) for the first time. IBM received the vast majority of mainframe revenue. During the 1980s, minicomputer-based systems grew more sophisticated and were able to displace the lower end of the mainframes. These computers, sometimes called \"departmental computers\", were typified by the Digital Equipment Corporation VAX series.\nIn 1991, AT&amp;T Corporation briefly owned NCR. During the same period, companies found that servers based on microcomputer designs could be deployed at a fraction of the acquisition price and offer local users much greater control over their own systems given the IT policies and practices at that time. Terminals used for interacting with mainframe systems were gradually replaced by personal computers. Consequently, demand plummeted and new mainframe installations were restricted mainly to financial services and government. In the early 1990s, there was a rough consensus among industry analysts that the mainframe was a dying market as mainframe platforms were increasingly replaced by personal computer networks. \"InfoWorld\"'s Stewart Alsop infamously predicted that the last mainframe would be unplugged in 1996; in 1993, he cited Cheryl Currid, a computer industry analyst as saying that the last mainframe \"will stop working on December 31, 1999\", a reference to the anticipated Year 2000 problem (Y2K).\nThat trend started to turn around in the late 1990s as corporations found new uses for their existing mainframes and as the price of data networking collapsed in most parts of the world, encouraging trends toward more centralized computing. The growth of e-business also dramatically increased the number of back-end transactions processed by mainframe software as well as the size and throughput of databases. Batch processing, such as billing, became even more important (and larger) with the growth of e-business, and mainframes are particularly adept at large-scale batch computing. Another factor currently increasing mainframe use is the development of the Linux operating system, which arrived on IBM mainframe systems in 1999. Linux allows users to take advantage of open source software combined with mainframe hardware RAS. Rapid expansion and development in emerging markets, particularly People's Republic of China, is also spurring major mainframe investments to solve exceptionally difficult computing problems, e.g. providing unified, extremely high volume online transaction processing databases for 1 billion consumers across multiple industries (banking, insurance, credit reporting, government services, etc.) In late 2000, IBM introduced 64-bit z/Architecture, acquired numerous software companies such as Cognos and introduced those software products to the mainframe. IBM's quarterly and annual reports in the 2000s usually reported increasing mainframe revenues and capacity shipments. However, IBM's mainframe hardware business has not been immune to the recent overall downturn in the server hardware market or to model cycle effects. For example, in the 4th quarter of 2009, IBM's System z hardware revenues decreased by 27% year over year. But MIPS (millions of instructions per second) shipments increased 4% per year over the past two years. Alsop had himself photographed in 2000, symbolically eating his own words (\"death to the mainframe\").\nIn 2012, NASA powered down its last mainframe, an IBM System z9. However, IBM's successor to the z9, the z10, led a New York Times reporter to state four years earlier that \"mainframe technology\u2014hardware, software and services\u2014remains a large and lucrative business for I.B.M., and mainframes are still the back-office engines behind the world's financial markets and much of global commerce\". As of 2010[ [update]], while mainframe technology represented less than 3% of IBM's revenues, it \"continue[d] to play an outsized role in Big Blue's results\".\nIBM has continued to launch new generations of mainframes: the IBM z13 in 2015, the z14 in 2017, the z15 in 2019, and the z16 in 2022, the latter featuring among other things an \"integrated on-chip AI accelerator\" and the new Telum microprocessor.\nDifferences from supercomputers.\nA supercomputer is a computer at the leading edge of data processing capability, with respect to calculation speed. Supercomputers are used for scientific and engineering problems (high-performance computing) which crunch numbers and data, while mainframes focus on transaction processing. The differences are:\nMainframes and supercomputers cannot always be clearly distinguished; up until the early 1990s, many supercomputers were based on a mainframe architecture with supercomputing extensions. An example of such a system is the HITAC S-3800, which was instruction-set compatible with IBM System/370 mainframes, and could run the Hitachi VOS3 operating system (a fork of IBM MVS). The S-3800 therefore can be seen as being both simultaneously a supercomputer and also an IBM-compatible mainframe.\nIn 2007, an amalgamation of the different technologies and architectures for supercomputers and mainframes has led to a so-called gameframe.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It features calculation or computation capabilities, graphing tools, pivot tables, and a macro programming language called Visual Basic for Applications (VBA). \nExcel forms part of the Microsoft 365 and Microsoft Office suites of software and has been developed since 1985.\nFeatures.\nBasic operation.\nMicrosoft Excel has the basic features of all spreadsheets, using a grid of \"cells\" arranged in numbered \"rows\" and letter-named \"columns\" to organize data manipulations like arithmetic operations. It has a battery of supplied functions to answer statistical, engineering, and financial needs. In addition, it can display data as line graphs, histograms and charts, and with a very limited three-dimensional graphical display. It allows sectioning of data to view its dependencies on various factors for different perspectives (using \"pivot tables\" and the \"scenario manager\"). A PivotTable is a tool for data analysis. It does this by simplifying large data sets via PivotTable fields. It has a programming aspect, \"Visual Basic for Applications\", allowing the user to employ a wide variety of numerical methods, for example, for solving differential equations of mathematical physics, and then reporting the results back to the spreadsheet. It also has a variety of interactive features allowing user interfaces that can completely hide the spreadsheet from the user, so the spreadsheet presents itself as a so-called \"application\", or \"decision support system\" (DSS), via a custom-designed user interface, for example, a stock analyzer, or in general, as a design tool that asks the user questions and provides answers and reports. In a more elaborate realization, an Excel application can automatically poll external databases and measuring instruments using an update schedule, analyze the results, make a Word report or PowerPoint slide show, and email these presentations on a regular basis to a list of participants.\nMicrosoft allows for a number of optional command-line switches to control the manner in which Excel starts.\nFunctions.\nExcel 2016 has 484 functions. Of these, 360 existed prior to Excel 2010. Microsoft classifies these functions into 14 categories. Of the 484 current functions, 386 may be called from VBA as methods of the object \"WorksheetFunction\" and 44 have the same names as VBA functions.\nWith the introduction of LAMBDA, Excel became Turing complete.\nMacro programming.\nVBA programming.\nThe Windows version of Excel supports programming through Microsoft's Visual Basic for Applications (VBA), which is a dialect of Visual Basic. Programming with VBA allows spreadsheet manipulation that is awkward or impossible with standard spreadsheet techniques. Programmers may write code directly using the Visual Basic Editor (VBE), which includes a window for writing code, debugging code, and code module organization environment. The user can implement numerical methods as well as automating tasks such as formatting or data organization in VBA and guide the calculation using any desired intermediate results reported back to the spreadsheet.\nVBA was removed from Mac Excel 2008, as the developers did not believe that a timely release would allow porting the VBA engine natively to Mac OS X. VBA was restored in the next version, Mac Excel 2011, although the build lacks support for ActiveX objects, impacting some high level developer tools.\nA common and easy way to generate VBA code is by using the Macro Recorder. The Macro Recorder records actions of the user and generates VBA code in the form of a macro. These actions can then be repeated automatically by running the macro. The macros can also be linked to different trigger types like keyboard shortcuts, a command button or a graphic. The actions in the macro can be executed from these trigger types or from the generic toolbar options. The VBA code of the macro can also be edited in the VBE. Certain features such as loop functions and screen prompt by their own properties, and some graphical display items, cannot be recorded but must be entered into the VBA module directly by the programmer. Advanced users can employ user prompts to create an interactive program, or react to events such as sheets being loaded or changed.\nMacro Recorded code may not be compatible with Excel versions. Some code that is used in Excel 2010 cannot be used in Excel 2003. Making a Macro that changes the cell colors and making changes to other aspects of cells may not be backward compatible.\nVBA code interacts with the spreadsheet through the Excel \"Object Model\", a vocabulary identifying spreadsheet objects, and a set of supplied functions or \"methods\" that enable reading and writing to the spreadsheet and interaction with its users (for example, through custom toolbars or \"command bars\" and \"message boxes\"). User-created VBA subroutines execute these actions and operate like macros generated using the macro recorder, but are more flexible and efficient.\nHistory.\nFrom its first version Excel supported end-user programming of macros (automation of repetitive tasks) and user-defined functions (extension of Excel's built-in function library). In early versions of Excel, these programs were written in a macro language whose statements had formula syntax and resided in the cells of special-purpose macro sheets (stored with file extension .XLM in Windows.) XLM was the default macro language for Excel through Excel 4.0. Beginning with version 5.0 Excel recorded macros in VBA by default but with version 5.0 XLM recording was still allowed as an option. After version 5.0 that option was discontinued. All versions of Excel, including Excel 2021, are capable of running an XLM macro, though Microsoft discourages their use.\nPython programming.\nIn 2023, Microsoft announced Excel would support the Python programming language directly. As of 2025, Python in Excel is available to Enterprise and Business users (with some exceptions, and is in preview for Family, Personal, and Education users).\nCharts.\nExcel supports charts, graphs, or histograms generated from specified groups of cells. It also supports Pivot Charts that allow for a chart to be linked directly to a Pivot table. This allows the chart to be refreshed with the Pivot Table. The generated graphic component can either be embedded within the current sheet or added as a separate object.\nThese displays are dynamically updated if the content of cells changes. For example, suppose that the important design requirements are displayed visually; then, in response to a user's change in trial values for parameters, the curves describing the design change shape, and their points of intersection shift, assisting the selection of the best design.\nAdd-ins.\nAdditional features are available using add-ins. Several are provided with Excel, including:\nData storage and communication.\nNumber of rows and columns.\nVersions of Excel up to 7.0 had a limitation in the size of their data sets of 16K (214 = ) rows. Versions 8.0 through 11.0 could handle 64K (216 = ) rows and 256 columns (28 as label 'IV'). Version 12.0 onwards, including the current Version 16.x, can handle over 1M (220 = ) rows, and (214, labeled as column 'XFD') columns.\nFile formats.\nUp until the 2007 version, Microsoft Excel used a proprietary binary file format called Excel Binary File Format (.XLS) as its primary format. Excel 2007 uses Office Open XML as its primary file format, an XML-based format that followed after a previous XML-based format called \"XML Spreadsheet\" (\"XMLSS\"), first introduced in Excel 2002.\nAlthough supporting and encouraging the use of new XML-based formats as replacements, Excel 2007 remained backwards-compatible with the traditional, binary formats. In addition, most versions of Microsoft Excel can read CSV, DBF, SYLK, DIF, and other legacy formats. Support for some older file formats was removed in Excel 2007. The file formats were mainly from DOS-based programs.\nBinary.\nOpenOffice.org has created documentation of the Excel format. Two epochs of the format exist: the 97-2003 OLE format, and the older stream format. Microsoft has made the Excel binary format specification available to freely download.\nXML Spreadsheet.\nThe \"XML Spreadsheet\" format introduced in Excel 2002 is a simple, XML based format missing some more advanced features like storage of VBA macros. Though the intended file extension for this format is \".xml\", the program also correctly handles XML files with \".xls\" extension. This feature is widely used by third-party applications (e.g. \"MySQL Query Browser\") to offer \"export to Excel\" capabilities without implementing binary file format. The following example will be correctly opened by Excel if saved either as \"Book1.xml\" or \"Book1.xls\":\n&lt;?xml version=\"1.0\"?&gt;\n&lt;Workbook xmlns=\"urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:spreadsheet\"\n xmlns:o=\"urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office\"\n xmlns:x=\"urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:excel\"\n xmlns:ss=\"urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:spreadsheet\"\n xmlns:html=\"http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40\"&gt;\n &lt;Worksheet ss:Name=\"Sheet1\"&gt;\n &lt;Table ss:ExpandedColumnCount=\"2\" ss:ExpandedRowCount=\"2\" x:FullColumns=\"1\" x:FullRows=\"1\"&gt;\n &lt;Row&gt;\n &lt;Cell&gt;&lt;Data ss:Type=\"String\"&gt;Name&lt;/Data&gt;&lt;/Cell&gt;\n &lt;Cell&gt;&lt;Data ss:Type=\"String\"&gt;Example&lt;/Data&gt;&lt;/Cell&gt;\n &lt;/Row&gt;\n &lt;Row&gt;\n &lt;Cell&gt;&lt;Data ss:Type=\"String\"&gt;Value&lt;/Data&gt;&lt;/Cell&gt;\n &lt;Cell&gt;&lt;Data ss:Type=\"Number\"&gt;123&lt;/Data&gt;&lt;/Cell&gt;\n &lt;/Row&gt;\n &lt;/Table&gt;\n &lt;/Worksheet&gt;\n&lt;/Workbook&gt;\nCurrent file extensions.\nMicrosoft Excel 2007, along with the other products in the Microsoft Office 2007 suite, introduced new file formats. The first of these (.xlsx) is defined in the Office Open XML (OOXML) specification.\nUsing other Windows applications.\nWindows applications such as Microsoft Access and Microsoft Word, as well as Excel can communicate with each other and use each other's capabilities. The most common is Dynamic Data Exchange: although strongly deprecated by Microsoft, this is a common method to send data between applications running on Windows, with official MS publications referring to it as \"the protocol from hell\". As the name suggests, it allows applications to supply data to others for calculation and display. It is very common in financial markets, being used to connect to important financial data services such as Bloomberg and Reuters.\nOLE Object Linking and Embedding allows a Windows application to control another to enable it to format or calculate data. This may take on the form of \"embedding\" where an application uses another to handle a task that it is more suited to, for example a PowerPoint presentation may be embedded in an Excel spreadsheet or vice versa.\nUsing external data.\nExcel users can access external data sources via Microsoft Office features such as (for example) connections built with the Office Data Connection file format. Excel files themselves may be updated using a Microsoft supplied ODBC driver.\nExcel can accept data in real-time through several programming interfaces, which allow it to communicate with many data sources such as Bloomberg and Reuters (through addins such as Power Plus Pro).\nAlternatively, Microsoft Query provides ODBC-based browsing within Microsoft Excel.\nExport and migration of spreadsheets.\nProgrammers have produced APIs to open Excel spreadsheets in a variety of applications and environments other than Microsoft Excel. These include opening Excel documents on the web using either ActiveX controls, or plugins like the Adobe Flash Player. The Apache POI open-source project provides Java libraries for reading and writing Excel spreadsheet files.\nPassword protection.\nMicrosoft Excel protection offers several types of passwords:\nAll passwords except \"password to open a document\" can be removed instantly regardless of the Microsoft Excel version used to create the document. These types of passwords are used primarily for shared work on a document. Such password-protected documents are not encrypted, and data sources from a set password are saved in a document's header. \"Password to protect workbook\" is an exception \u2013 when it is set, a document is encrypted with the standard password \"VelvetSweatshop\", but since it is known to the public, it actually does not add any extra protection to the document. The only type of password that can prevent a trespasser from gaining access to a document is the \"password to open a document\". The cryptographic strength of this kind of protection depends strongly on the Microsoft Excel version that was used to create the document.\nIn \"Microsoft Excel 95\" and earlier versions, the password to open is converted to a 16-bit key that can be instantly cracked. In \"Excel 97/2000\" the password is converted to a 40-bit key, which can also be cracked very quickly using modern equipment. As regards services that use rainbow tables (e.g. Password-Find), it takes up to several seconds to remove protection. In addition, password-cracking programs can brute-force attack passwords at a rate of hundreds of thousands of passwords a second, which not only lets them decrypt a document but also find the original password.\nIn \"Excel 2003/XP\" the encryption is slightly better \u2013 a user can choose any encryption algorithm that is available in the system (see Cryptographic Service Provider). Due to the CSP, an \"Excel\" file cannot be decrypted, and thus the \"password to open\" cannot be removed, though the brute-force attack speed remains quite high. Nevertheless, the older \"Excel 97/2000\" algorithm is set by the default. Therefore, users who do not change the default settings lack reliable protection of their documents.\nThe situation changed fundamentally in \"Excel 2007\", where the modern AES algorithm with a key of 128 bits started being used for decryption, and a 50,000-fold use of the hash function SHA1 reduced the speed of brute-force attacks down to hundreds of passwords per second. In \"Excel 2010\", the strength of the protection by the default was increased two times due to the use of a 100,000-fold SHA1 to convert a password to a key.\nOther platforms.\nExcel for mobile.\nExcel Mobile is a spreadsheet program that can edit XLSX files. It can edit and format text in cells, calculate formulas, search within the spreadsheet, sort rows and columns, freeze panes, filter the columns, add comments, and create charts. It cannot add columns or rows except at the edge of the document, rearrange columns or rows, delete rows or columns, or add spreadsheet tabs. The 2007 version has the ability to use a full-screen mode to deal with limited screen resolution, as well as split panes to view different parts of a worksheet at one time. Protection settings, zoom settings, autofilter settings, certain chart formatting, hidden sheets, and other features are not supported on Excel Mobile, and will be modified upon opening and saving a workbook. In 2015, Excel Mobile became available for Windows 10 and Windows 10 Mobile on Windows Store.\nExcel for the web.\nExcel for the web is a free lightweight version of Microsoft Excel available as part of Office on the web, which also includes web versions of Microsoft Word and Microsoft PowerPoint.\nExcel for the web can display most of the features available in the desktop versions of Excel, although it may not be able to insert or edit them. Certain data connections are not accessible on Excel for the web, including with charts that may use these external connections. Excel for the web also cannot display legacy features, such as Excel 4.0 macros or Excel 5.0 dialog sheets. There are also small differences between how some of the Excel functions work.\nMicrosoft Excel Viewer.\nMicrosoft Excel Viewer was a freeware program for Microsoft Windows for viewing and printing spreadsheet documents created by Excel. Microsoft retired the viewer in April 2018 with the last security update released in February 2019 for Excel Viewer 2007 (SP3).\nThe first version released by Microsoft was Excel 97 Viewer. Excel 97 Viewer was supported in Windows CE for Handheld PCs. In October 2004, Microsoft released Excel Viewer 2003. In September 2007, Microsoft released Excel Viewer 2003 Service Pack 3 (SP3). In January 2008, Microsoft released Excel Viewer 2007 (featuring a non-collapsible Ribbon interface). In April 2009, Microsoft released Excel Viewer 2007 Service Pack 2 (SP2). In October 2011, Microsoft released Excel Viewer 2007 Service Pack 3 (SP3).\nMicrosoft advises those who wish to view and print Excel files for free to use the Excel Mobile application for Windows 10 and for Windows 7 and Windows 8 to upload the file to OneDrive and use Excel for the web with a Microsoft account to open them in a browser.\nLimitations and errors.\nIn addition to issues with spreadsheets in general, other problems specific to Excel include numeric precision, misleading statistics functions, mod function errors, date limitations and more.\nNumeric precision.\nDespite the use of 15-figure precision, Excel can display many more figures (up to thirty) upon user request. But the displayed figures are \"not\" those actually used in its computations, and so, for example, the difference of two numbers may differ from the difference of their displayed values. Although such departures are usually beyond the 15th decimal, exceptions do occur, especially for very large or very small numbers. Serious errors can occur if decisions are made based upon automated comparisons of numbers (for example, using the Excel \"If\" function), as equality of two numbers can be unpredictable.\nIn the figure, the fraction 1/9000 is displayed in Excel. Although this number has a decimal representation that is an infinite string of ones, Excel displays only the leading 15 figures. In the second line, the number one is added to the fraction, and again Excel displays only 15 figures. In the third line, one is subtracted from the sum using Excel. Because the sum in the second line has only eleven 1's after the decimal, the difference when 1 is subtracted from this displayed value is three 0's followed by a string of eleven 1's. However, the difference reported by Excel in the third line is three 0's followed by a string of \"thirteen\" 1's and two extra erroneous digits. This is because Excel calculates with about half a digit more than it displays.\nExcel works with a modified 1985 version of the IEEE 754 specification. Excel's implementation involves conversions between binary and decimal representations, leading to accuracy that is on average better than one would expect from simple fifteen digit precision, but that can be worse. See the main article for details.\nBesides accuracy in user computations, the question of accuracy in Excel-provided functions may be raised. Particularly in the arena of statistical functions, Excel has been criticized for sacrificing accuracy for speed of calculation.\nAs many calculations in Excel are executed using VBA, an additional issue is the accuracy of VBA, which varies with variable type and user-requested precision.\nStatistical functions.\nThe accuracy and convenience of statistical tools in Excel has been criticized, as mishandling situations when data is missing, as returning incorrect values due to inept handling of round-off and large numbers, as only selectively updating calculations on a spreadsheet when some cell values are changed, and as having a limited set of statistical tools. Microsoft has announced that some of these issues are addressed in Excel 2010.\nExcel MOD function error.\nExcel has issues with modulo operations. In the case of excessively large results, Excel will return the error warning &lt;samp style=\"padding-left:0.4em; padding-right:0.4em; color:var( --color-subtle, #666666); \" &gt;#NUM!&lt;/samp&gt; instead of an answer.\nFictional leap day in 1900.\nExcel includes February 29, 1900, incorrectly treating 1900 as a leap year, even though e.g. 2100 is correctly treated as a non-leap year. Thus, a formula counting dates between (for example) February 1, 1900 and March 1, 1900 will return an incorrect result. The bug originated from Lotus 1-2-3, where it was deliberately implemented to save computer memory, and was also intentionally implemented in Excel for the purpose of bug compatibility. This legacy has later been carried over into Office Open XML file format.\nDate range.\nExcel supports dates with years in the range 1900\u20139999, except that December 31, 1899, can be entered as 0 and is displayed as 0-jan-1900.\nConverting a fraction of a day into hours, minutes and days by treating it as a moment on the day January 1, 1900, does not work for a negative fraction.\nConversion problems.\nIf text is entered that happens to be in a form that Excel interprets as a date, the text can be unintentionally changed to a standard date format. A similar problem occurs when a text happens to be in the form of a floating-point notation of a number. In these cases the original exact text cannot be recovered from the result. Formatting the cell as TEXT before entering ambiguous text prevents Excel from converting it.\nThis issue has caused a well known problem in the analysis of DNA, for example in bioinformatics. As first reported in 2004, genetic scientists found that Excel automatically and incorrectly converts certain gene names into dates. A follow-up study in 2016 found many peer reviewed scientific journal papers had been affected and that \"Of the selected journals, the proportion of published articles with Excel files containing gene lists that are affected by gene name errors is 19.6%.\" Excel parses the copied and pasted data and sometimes changes them depending on what it thinks they are. For example, MARCH1 (Membrane Associated Ring-CH-type finger 1) gets converted to the date March 1 (1-Mar) and SEPT2 (Septin 2) is converted into September 2 (2-Sep) etc. While some secondary news sources reported this as a fault with Excel, the original authors of the 2016 paper placed the blame with the researchers misusing Excel.\nIn August 2020 the HUGO Gene Nomenclature Committee (HGNC) published new guidelines in the journal Nature regarding gene naming in order to avoid issues with \"symbols that affect data handling and retrieval.\" As of 2020[ [update]], 27 genes had been renamed, including changing MARCH1 to MARCHF1 and SEPT1 to SEPTIN1 in order to avoid accidental conversion of the gene names into dates.\nIn October 2023, Microsoft introduced a settings option that allows the conversion to be disabled.\nErrors with large strings.\nThe following functions return incorrect results when passed a string longer than 255 characters:\nFilenames.\nMicrosoft Excel will not open two documents with the same name and instead will display the following error:\n A document with the name '%s' is already open. You cannot open two documents with the same name, even if the documents are in different folders. To open the second document, either close the document that is currently open, or rename one of the documents.\nThe reason is for calculation ambiguity with linked cells. If there is a cell , and there are two books named \"Book1\" open, there is no way to tell which one the user means.\nVersions.\nEarly history.\nIn 1982, Microsoft launched its first spreadsheet program, Multiplan, which gained popularity on CP/M systems. However, Multiplan struggled to compete on MS-DOS systems, losing market share to Lotus 1-2-3, which became the dominant spreadsheet program by 1983, surpassing both Multiplan and the earlier VisiCalc.\nTo address Multiplan's falling marketshare, Microsoft began developing a new, advanced spreadsheet program in 1983, codenamed \"Odyssey.\" The project was led by Jabe Blumenthal, who worked on its design, and Doug Klunder, the primary developer of Multiplan. Originally intended for IBM PCs running CP/M and MS-DOS, the project shifted focus in early 1984 when Lotus began developing Jazz, an integrated program for the Apple Macintosh, and Lotus 1-2-3 maintained its dominance on IBM PCs. In March 1984, Bill Gates redirected Odyssey's development to the Macintosh platform, which required supporting the system's 512 KB memory. This decision delayed the project by nine months, after which Klunder temporarily left Microsoft to work growing lettuce, and the project then was led by Philip Florence, a former developer at Wang Laboratories. After Florence had a heart attack, Klunder returned to finish the project.\nOn May 2, 1985, Steve Jobs of Apple Computer and Bill Gates held a joint press conference at Tavern on the Green in New York City to publicly announce Excel for Apple's Macintosh platform. Following the announcement, the software was officially released for sale on September 30, 1985. The first Windows version, Excel 2.05, followed on November 19, 1987, designed to align with the Macintosh version 2.2. A 1990 American Institute of Certified Public Accountants member survey found that 2% of respondents used Excel as their spreadsheet, 3% as their database, and 8% for graphics. Lotus was slow to bring 1-2-3 to Windows and by the early 1990s, Excel had started to outsell 1-2-3 and helped Microsoft achieve its position as a leading PC software developer. This accomplishment solidified Microsoft as a valid competitor and showed its future in developing GUI software. Microsoft maintained its advantage with regular new releases, every two years or so.\nMicrosoft Windows.\nExcel 2.0 is the first version of Excel for the Intel platform. Versions prior to 2.0 were only available on the Apple Macintosh.\nExcel 2.0 (1987).\nThe first Windows version was labeled \"2\" to correspond to the Mac version. It was announced on October 6, 1987, and released on November 19. This included a runtime version of Windows.\n\"BYTE\" in 1989 listed Excel for Windows as among the \"Distinction\" winners of the BYTE Awards. The magazine stated that the port of the \"extraordinary\" Macintosh version \"shines\", with a user interface as good as or better than the original.\nExcel 3.0 (1990).\nIncluded toolbars, drawing capabilities, outlining, add-in support, 3D charts, and many more new features.\nExcel 4.0 (1992).\nIncluded with Microsoft Office 3.0, this version introduced auto-fill.\nAlso, an easter egg in Excel 4.0 reveals a hidden animation of a dancing set of numbers 1 through 3, representing Lotus 1\u20132\u20133, which is then crushed by an Excel logo.\nExcel 5.0 (1993).\nWith version 5.0, included in Microsoft Office 4.2 and 4.3, Excel included Visual Basic for Applications (VBA), a programming language based on Visual Basic which adds the ability to automate tasks in Excel and to provide user-defined functions (UDF) for use in worksheets. VBA includes a fully featured integrated development environment (IDE). Macro recording can produce VBA code replicating user actions, thus allowing simple automation of regular tasks. VBA allows the creation of forms and in\u2011worksheet controls to communicate with the user. The language supports use (but not creation) of ActiveX (COM) DLL's; later versions add support for class modules allowing the use of basic object-oriented programming techniques.\nThe automation functionality provided by VBA made Excel a target for macro viruses. This caused serious problems until antivirus products began to detect these viruses. Microsoft belatedly took steps to prevent the misuse by adding the ability to disable macros completely, to enable macros when opening a workbook or to trust all macros signed using a trusted certificate.\nVersions 5.0 to 9.0 of Excel contain various Easter eggs, including a \"Hall of Tortured Souls\", a \"Doom\"-like minigame, although since version\u00a010 Microsoft has taken measures to eliminate such undocumented features from their products.\n5.0 was released in a 16-bit x86 version for Windows 3.1 and later in a 32-bit version for NT 3.51 (x86/Alpha/PowerPC)\nExcel 95 (v7.0).\nReleased in 1995 with Microsoft Office for Windows 95, this is the first major version after Excel 5.0, as there is no Excel 6.0 with all of the Office applications standardizing on the same major version number.\nInternal rewrite to 32-bits. Almost no external changes, but faster and more stable.\nExcel 95 contained a hidden \"Doom\"-like mini-game called \"The Hall of Tortured Souls\", a series of rooms featuring the names and faces of the developers as an Easter egg.\nExcel 97 (v8.0).\nIncluded in Office 97 (for x86 and Alpha). This was a major upgrade that introduced the paper clip office assistant and featured standard VBA used instead of internal Excel Basic. It introduced the now-removed Natural Language labels.\nThis version of Excel includes a flight simulator as an Easter egg.\nExcel 2000 (v9.0).\nIncluded in Office 2000. This was a minor upgrade but introduced an upgrade to the clipboard where it can hold multiple objects at once. The Office Assistant, whose frequent unsolicited appearance in Excel 97 had annoyed many users, became less intrusive.\nA small 3-D game called \"Dev Hunter\" (inspired by Spy Hunter) was included as an Easter egg.\nExcel 2002 (v10.0).\nIncluded in Office XP with minor enhancements over the previous version.\nExcel 2003 (v11.0).\nIncluded in Office 2003 with minor enhancements over the previous version.\nExcel 2007 (v12.0).\nIncluded in Office 2007. This release was a major upgrade from the previous version. Similar to other updated Office products, Excel in 2007 used the new Ribbon menu system. This was different from what users were used to, and was met with mixed reactions. One study reported fairly good acceptance by users except for highly experienced users and users of word processing applications with a classical WIMP interface, but was less convinced in terms of efficiency and organization. However, an online survey reported that a majority of respondents had a negative opinion of the change, with advanced users being \"somewhat more negative\" than intermediate users, and users reporting a self-estimated reduction in productivity.\nAdded functionality included Tables, and the SmartArt set of editable business diagrams. Also added was an improved management of named variables through the \"Name Manager\", and much-improved flexibility in formatting graphs, which allow (\"x, y\") coordinate labeling and lines of arbitrary weight. Several improvements to pivot tables were introduced.\nAlso like other office products, the Office Open XML file formats were introduced, including \".xlsm\" for a workbook with macros and \".xlsx\" for a workbook without macros.\nSpecifically, many of the size limitations of previous versions were greatly increased. To illustrate, the number of rows was now 1,048,576 (220) and the columns was 16,384 (214; the far-right column is XFD). This changes what is a valid \"A1\" reference versus a named range. This version made more extensive use of multiple cores for the calculation of spreadsheets; however, VBA macros are not handled in parallel and XLL add\u2011ins were only executed in parallel if they were thread-safe and this was indicated at registration.\nExcel 2010 (v14.0).\nIncluded in Office 2010, this is the next major version after v12.0, as version number 13 was skipped.\nMinor enhancements and 64-bit support, including the following:\nExcel 2013 (v15.0).\nIncluded in Office 2013, along with a lot of new tools included in this release:\nExcel 2016 (v16.0).\nIncluded in Office 2016, along with a lot of new tools included in this release:\nExcel 2019, Excel 2021, Excel 2024, Office 365 and subsequent (v16.0).\nMicrosoft no longer releases Office or Excel in distinctive versions. Instead, features are introduced automatically over time. The version number remains 16.0. Thereafter only the approximate dates when features appear can now be given. New features include:\nMicrosoft Office 2024 (the fourth perpetual release of Office 16.0) for the Microsoft Windows and macOS was released on October 1, 2024.\nSummary.\nLegend:UnsupportedSupportedLatest versionPreview versionFuture version&lt;templatestyles src=\"Version/styles.css\" /&gt;\nImpact.\nExcel offers many user interface tweaks over the earliest electronic spreadsheets; however, the essence remains the same as in the original spreadsheet software, VisiCalc: the program displays cells organized in rows and columns, and each cell may contain data or a formula, with relative or absolute references to other cells.\nExcel 2.0 for Windows, which was modeled after its Mac GUI-based counterpart, indirectly expanded the installed base of the then-nascent Windows environment. Excel 2.0 was released a month before Windows 2.0, and the installed base of Windows was so low at that point in 1987 that Microsoft had to bundle a runtime version of Windows 1.0 with Excel 2.0. Unlike Microsoft Word, there never was a DOS version of Excel.\nExcel became the first spreadsheet to allow the user to define the appearance of spreadsheets (fonts, character attributes, and cell appearance). It also introduced intelligent cell re-computation, where only cells dependent on the cell being modified are updated (previous spreadsheet programs recomputed everything all the time or waited for a specific user command). Excel introduced auto-fill, the ability to drag and expand the selection box to automatically copy a cell or row contents to adjacent cells or rows, adjusting the copies intelligently by automatically incrementing cell references or contents. Excel also introduced extensive graphing capabilities.\nExcel holds a central place in modern office work: a 2022 survey found that two-thirds of office workers use Excel at least once per hour, spending 38% of their total working time inside the program. It is estimated between 750 million and 1.2 billion users access Excel each month.\nSecurity.\nBecause Excel is widely used, it has been attacked by hackers. While Excel is not directly exposed to the Internet, if an attacker can get a victim to open a file in Excel, and there is an appropriate security bug in Excel, then the attacker can gain control of the victim's computer. UK's GCHQ has a tool named TORNADO ALLEY with this purpose.\nGames.\nBesides the easter eggs, numerous games have been created or recreated in Excel, such as \"Tetris\", \"2048\", \"Scrabble\", \"Yahtzee\", \"Angry Birds\", \"Pac-Man\", \"Civilization\", \"Monopoly\", \"Battleship\", Blackjack, \"Space Invaders\", and others.\nIn 2020, Excel became an esport with the advent of the Financial Modeling World Cup.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "20269", "revid": "473822", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20269", "title": "Michael Hutchence", "text": "Australian singer (1960\u20131997)\nMichael Kelland John Hutchence (22 January 1960\u00a0\u2013 22 November 1997) was an Australian singer and songwriter. He was the co-founder, lead singer and lyricist of the rock band INXS from 1977 until his death in 1997. The band sold over 50 million records worldwide, making them one of Australia's highest-selling music acts of all time. They were inducted into the ARIA Hall of Fame in 2001.\nHutchence was also a member of the short-lived band Max Q and recorded some solo material, alongside acting in films such as \"Dogs in Space\" (1986) and \"Frankenstein Unbound\" (1990). He was known for his string of love affairs with actresses, models and singers and his private life was often covered in the international press. He had a daughter, Tiger Hutchence-Geldof, with British television presenter Paula Yates. Hutchence died by suicide in a Sydney hotel room on 22 November 1997 at the age of 37.\nEarly life.\nMichael Hutchence was born in the Crows Nest suburb of Sydney on 22 January 1960, the son of make-up artist Patricia Glassop and businessman Kelland Frank \"Kell\" Hutchence. He had an elder half-sister named Tina. His paternal grandparents were an English couple who had relocated to Sydney in 1922, while his maternal grandfather was from County Cork, Ireland.\nFollowing Kell's business interests, the Hutchence family moved to Brisbane, where Hutchence's younger brother Rhett was born. They later left Australia for Hong Kong. During the early years in Hong Kong, both boys attended Glenealy Junior School and Beacon Hill School. Hutchence showed promise as a swimmer before badly breaking his arm. He then began to show interest in poetry and performed his first song in a local toy store commercial. He later attended King George V School during his early teens. The family returned to Sydney in 1972, buying a house in Belrose.\nHutchence attended Davidson High School, where he met and befriended Andrew Farriss. Around this time, the two spent a lot of time jamming with Farriss's brothers Tim and Jon in the garage. Farriss convinced Hutchence to join his band, Doctor Dolphin, alongside their classmates Kent Kerny and Neil Sanders. Bassist Garry Beers and drummer Geoff Kennelly from nearby Forest High School completed the line-up.\nHutchence's parents separated when he was 15 and he lived with his mother and half-sister in California for a short time in 1976. He later returned to Sydney with them. In 1977, a new band called the Farriss Brothers was formed with Andrew on keyboards, Tim on lead guitar and Jon on drums. Hutchence joined on vocals and Beers on bass, while Kirk Pengilly joined on guitar and saxophone. The band made their debut on 16 August 1977 at a venue in Whale Beach.\nCareer.\nEarly career.\nHutchence, the Farriss brothers, Kerny, Sanders, Beers and Kennelly briefly performed as the Vegetables, singing \"We Are the Vegetables\". Ten months later, they returned to Sydney and recorded a set of demos. The Farriss Brothers regularly supported hard rockers Midnight Oil on the pub rock circuit, and were renamed as INXS in 1979. Their first performance under the new name was on 1 September at the Oceanview Hotel in Toukley. In May 1980, the group released their first single, \"Simple Simon\"/\"We Are the Vegetables\", which was followed by the debut album \"INXS\" in October. Their first Top\u00a040 Australian hit on the Kent Music Report Singles Chart, \"Just Keep Walking\", was released in September 1980. Hutchence became the main spokesman for the band, and co-wrote almost all of the band's songs with Andrew Farriss.\nAccording to Hutchence, most of the songs on the band's second album, \"Underneath the Colours\", were written within a fairly short space of time: \"Most bands shudder at the prospect of having 20 years to write their first album and four days to write their second. For us, though, it was good. It left less room for us to go off on all sorts of tangents.\" Soon after recording sessions for \"Underneath the Colours\" \u2013 produced by Richard Clapton \u2013 had finished, band members started work on outside projects. Hutchence recorded \"Speed Kills\", written by Don Walker of hard rockers Cold Chisel, for the soundtrack to the 1982 film \"Freedom\", directed by Scott Hicks. It was Hutchence's first solo single and was released by WEA in April 1982.\nStardom and acting career.\nIn March 1985, after Hutchence and INXS recorded their album \"The Swing\" (1984), WEA released the Australian version of \"Dekadance\" as a limited edition cassette only EP of six tracks including remixes from the album. The cassette also included a cover version of Nancy Sinatra and Lee Hazlewood's hit \"Jackson\", which Hutchence sang as a duet with Jenny Morris, a backing singer for \"The Swing\" sessions. The EP reached No\u00a02 on the Kent Music Report Albums Chart. Hutchence provided vocals for new wave band Beargarden's 1985 single release.\nOn 19 May 1984, INXS won seven awards at the \"Countdown\" Music and Video Awards ceremony, including Best Songwriter for Hutchence and Andrew, and Most Popular Male for Hutchence. They performed \"Burn for You\" dressed in Akubras (a brand of hats) and Drizabones (a brand of outdoor coats/oilskin jackets) followed by Hutchence and Morris singing \"Jackson\" to close.\nIn 1986, Hutchence played Sam, the male lead in the Australian film \"Dogs in Space\", directed by long-time INXS music video collaborator Richard Lowenstein. Hutchence provided four songs to the film's soundtrack. Also working on the film and its soundtrack, as music director, was Ollie Olsen (ex-Whirlywirld).\nLate in 1986, before commencing work on a new INXS album and while supposedly taking an eight-month break, the band's management decided to stage the Australian Made tour as a series of major outdoor concerts across the country. The roster featured INXS, Jimmy Barnes (Cold Chisel), Models, Divinyls, Mental as Anything, the Triffids and I'm Talking. To promote the tour, Hutchence and Barnes shared vocals on the Easybeats cover \"Good Times\" and \"Laying Down the Law\", which Barnes co-wrote with Beers, Andrew Farriss, Jon Farriss, Hutchence and Pengilly. \"Good Times\" was used as the theme for the concert series of 1986\u20131987. It peaked at No.\u00a02 on the Australian charts, and months later was featured in the Joel Schumacher film \"The Lost Boys\" and its soundtrack, allowing it to peak at No.\u00a047 in the US on 1 August 1987. Divinyls' lead singer Chrissy Amphlett enjoyed the tour and reconnected with Hutchence, stating that \"[he] was a sweet man, who said in one interview that he wanted me to have his baby\". In 1987, Hutchence provided vocals for Richard Clapton's album \"Glory Road\", which was produced by Jon Farriss.\nINXS released \"Kick\" in October 1987, and the album provided the band with worldwide popularity. \"Kick\" peaked at No.\u00a01 in Australia, No.\u00a03 on the US \"Billboard\" 200, No.\u00a09 in UK, and No.\u00a015 in Austria. The band's most successful studio album, \"Kick\" has been certified six times platinum by the RIAA and spawned four US top 10 singles (\"New Sensation\", \"Never Tear Us Apart\", \"Devil Inside\" and \"Need You Tonight\", the last reaching the top of the US \"Billboard\" singles charts). According to \"1001 Songs: The Great Songs of All Time and the Artists, Stories and Secrets Behind Them\", the single \"Need You Tonight\" is not lyrically complex; it is Hutchence's performance where \"he sings in kittenish whisper, gently drawing back with the incredible lust of a tiger hunting in the night\" that makes the song \"as sexy and funky as any white rock group has ever been\". In September 1988, the band swept the MTV Video Music Awards with the video for \"Need You Tonight/Mediate\" winning in five categories.\nIn 1989, Hutchence collaborated further with Olsen for the Max Q project and was joined by members of Olsen's previous groups including Whirlywirld, No and Orchestra of Skin and Bone. They released a self-titled album and three singles, \"Way of the World\", \"Sometimes\" and \"Monday Night by Satellite\". Max Q disbanded in 1990. \"Max Q\" showed Hutchence exploring the darker side of his music and, with Olsen, he created \"one of the most innovative dance music albums of the decade\". Hutchence wrote most of the music and provided \"an extraordinary performance\u00a0... it was one of the most significant statements Hutchence was to make\". In 1990, Hutchence portrayed nineteenth-century Romantic poet Percy Shelley in Roger Corman's film version of \"Frankenstein Unbound\", which was based on a science fiction time travel story of the same name written by Brian Aldiss.\nIn 1990, INXS released \"X\", which spawned more international hits such as \"Suicide Blonde\" and \"Disappear\" (both Top 10 in the US). \"Suicide Blonde\" peaked at No.\u00a02 in Australia and No.\u00a011 in the UK. Hutchence, with Andrew Farriss, wrote the song after Hutchence's then-girlfriend, Kylie Minogue, used the phrase \"suicide blonde\" to describe her look during her 1989 film \"The Delinquents\"; the film depicted Minogue in a platinum blonde wig. Hutchence won Best International Artist at the 1991 BRIT Awards with INXS winning the related group award. Hutchence provided vocals for pub rockers Noiseworks' album \"Love Versus Money\" (1991). \"Welcome to Wherever You Are\" was released by INXS in August 1992. It received good critical reviews and went to No.\u00a01 in the UK.\nLater career.\nHutchence and INXS faced reduced commercial success with \"Full Moon, Dirty Hearts\", especially in the US. The band took time off to rest and be with their families, while Hutchence remained in the public eye through his romances. He commenced work on a self-titled solo album in the mid-1990s. After a period of inactivity and releases that received lukewarm reviews, INXS recorded the band's 10th official album, \"Elegantly Wasted\", in 1996.\nArtistry.\nHutchence was a baritone. His vocal range spanned from the bass B1 to the high tenor F#5. In 2013, \"News.com.au\" ranked Hutchence fourth in a list of the 15 greatest Australian singers of all time. \"Billboard\" described Hutchence as \"charismatic\" with a \"seductive purr and [a] lithe, magnetic stage presence\". Paul Donoughue, of Australia's ABC, wrote that Hutchence had \"a phenomenal voice \u2014 moody, sexual, and dynamic, able to shift effortlessly from fragile to cocksure\". Reviewing an INXS concert, Dave Simpson of \"The Guardian\" wrote that \"Watching Hutchence, hair flailing, crotch thrusting, a mischievous smile forever creeping across his leathery face, I realised that here was a man born to be onstage, living and loving every minute, an explosion of sexual energy.\" Hutchence biographer Toby Creswell asserted that \"Hutchence was, without question, one of the truly great frontmen \u2014 he expressed the music in a dynamic way that few others could.\"\nPersonal life.\nAccording to \"People\", Hutchence's \"public brawls and onetime open drug use\" led London tabloids to dub him the \"wild man of rock\". Between 1982 and 1987, he dated Australian film producer Michele Bennett, with whom he shared a flat in Paddington along with New Zealand-Australian singer Jenny Morris, who was INXS's backing vocalist. Bennett inspired INXS's 1988 hit song \"Never Tear Us Apart\", and introduced Hutchence to Australian filmmaker Richard Lowenstein, who ended up directing several music videos for INXS, including the one for \"Never Tear Us Apart\". According to Hutchence's sister, Tina, Bennett was the only woman that Hutchence said he had considered marrying. \nLowenstein, who was close friends with Hutchence, also said that he believed that Bennett was the only woman that Hutchence would marry; \"I always felt that, after everything, he'd go back and marry Michele and have a baby with her,\" he told \"The Independent\" in 1998. Bennett and Hutchence remained close friends after the end of their relationship and she was described as Hutchence's \"first real love\", his \"closest friend and confidante\".\nHe was romantically linked to Australian singer and actress Kylie Minogue between 1989 and 1991, American singer Belinda Carlisle, Danish model Helena Christensen between 1991 and 1995, and Australian actress Kym Wilson.\nIn August 1992, Hutchence and Christensen were riding their bicycles at night in Copenhagen when he refused to move for a taxi. They were eating pizza when, unbeknown to him, the taxi tried to get through the narrow street but \"didn't beep its horn or anything\". The taxi driver assaulted Hutchence, causing him to fall backwards and hit his head on the pavement; he suffered a fractured skull. Hutchence did not immediately seek medical assistance for the injury and waited several days before seeing a doctor. He was left with brain damage and almost completely lost his sense of smell, as well as losing a significant amount of his sense of taste. The injury led to periods of depression and increased levels of aggression, and he had still not fully recovered after two weeks in a Copenhagen hospital. According to INXS bandmate Beers, Hutchence brandished a knife and threatened to kill him during the 1993 recording of \"Full Moon, Dirty Hearts\". Beers recalled, \"Over those six weeks, Michael threatened or physically confronted nearly every member of the band.\"\nIn the mid-1990s, Hutchence became romantically involved with British television presenter Paula Yates. They met in 1985, during an interview for the British TV program \"The Tube\". Yates interviewed him again in 1994 for her \"Big Breakfast\" show, and their affair was soon uncovered by the British press. At the time, Yates was married to the Boomtown Rats singer and Live Aid organiser Bob Geldof. Media scrutiny was intense, and Hutchence assaulted a photographer who had followed them. Yates's separation from Geldof in February 1995 sparked a public and at times bitter custody battle over their daughters. Yates and Geldof divorced in May 1996.\nOn 22 July 1996, Yates gave birth to her daughter with Hutchence, Heavenly Hiraani Tiger Lily Hutchence, who was born in the bathroom of their London home while Hutchence helped with the delivery. In September 1996, Yates and Hutchence made headlines when they were arrested for suspicion of drug possession after the family nanny reportedly found a small amount of opium in a shoebox underneath their bed. The case was dropped due to lack of evidence. Yates died on 17 September 2000 of an accidental heroin overdose; she was discovered in the presence of her and Hutchence's then four-year-old daughter. Soon after Yates's death, Geldof assumed foster custody of their daughter so that she could be brought up with her three older half-sisters, Fifi, Peaches and Pixie. In 2007, their daughter was adopted by Geldof, who legally changed her surname, despite opposition from Hutchence's mother and sister. Her full legal name became Heavenly Hiraani Tiger Lily Hutchence-Geldof.\nDeath.\nOn 22 November 1997, at the age of 37, Hutchence was found dead in his room at the Ritz-Carlton hotel in the Double Bay suburb of Sydney. His cause of death was recorded as suicide by hanging. Actress Kym Wilson, who visited Hutchence in his hotel room the previous evening, was the last person to see him alive.\nEarlier that year, Hutchence and INXS had started a world tour to support the April 1997 release of \"Elegantly Wasted\". The final 20th anniversary tour was to occur in Australia in November and December. During the tour, Paula Yates planned to visit Hutchence with their daughter and Yates's three other children, but Bob Geldof had taken legal action to prevent the visit.\nGeldof and Yates each gave police statements concerning the phone calls they exchanged with Hutchence on the morning of his death, but did not volunteer their phone records. Yates's statement on 26 November indicated that she had informed Hutchence of the Geldof girls' custody hearing being adjourned until 17 December, which meant that Yates would not be able to bring their daughter and the Geldof girls to Australia for a visit as previously intended. According to Yates, Hutchence \"was frightened and couldn't stand a minute more without his baby ... [he] was terribly upset and he said 'I don't know how I'll live without seeing Tiger'.\" She indicated that Hutchence said he was going to call Geldof \"to let the girls come to Australia\".\nGeldof's police statements and evidence to the coroner indicated he did receive a call from Hutchence, who was \"hectoring and abusive and threatening\" during their phone conversation. The occupant in the room next to Hutchence's heard a loud male voice and swearing at about 5:00\u00a0am; the coroner was satisfied that this was Hutchence arguing with Geldof.\nAt 9:54\u00a0am on 22 November, Hutchence spoke with a former girlfriend, Michele Bennett, who was the last person that he called on the morning of his death. According to Bennett, Hutchence was crying, sounded upset, said he could not sleep and told her he needed to see her. Bennett arrived at his hotel room door at about 10:40\u00a0am, but there was no response, so she thought he had fallen asleep and wrote him a note and left it at reception. Hutchence's body was discovered by a hotel maid at 11:50\u00a0am. Police reported that Hutchence was found \"in a kneeling position facing the door. He had used his snakeskin belt to tie a knot on the automatic door closer at the top of the door, and had strained his head forward into the loop so hard that the buckle had broken.\"\nFollowing Hutchence's death, some of his friends, relatives and doctors provided statements to the police. Bennett, who made her phone records available to the detectives without them requesting it, said on her police statement that Hutchence had never expressed previous suicidal inclinations. Hutchence's mother, Patricia Glassop, said that he was in a depressed state. On 17 October 1997, Hutchence consulted a London psychiatrist, Mark Collins, in regard to a minor depression that he was experiencing. Dr. Collins stated that there was no hint of suicidal thinking by Hutchence. Hutchence was prescribed Prozac for the first time in December 1995 by Dr. J. Borham, a London medical practitioner, to treat a depressive problem. He was prescribed Prozac for the last time on 1 November 1997, three weeks before his death. \nOn 6 February 1998, after an autopsy and coronial inquest, New South Wales's state coroner, Derrick Hand, presented his report. The report ruled that Hutchence's death was suicide while depressed and under the influence of alcohol and other drugs. \"An analysis report of Hutchence's blood [indicated] the presence of alcohol, cocaine, Prozac and prescription drugs.\" In producing his coroner's report, Hand had specifically considered the suggestions of accidental death (coupled with the fact that Hutchence left no suicide note), but had discounted them based on substantial evidence presented to the contrary. In a 1999 interview on \"60 Minutes\" (and in a documentary film on Channel 4), Yates claimed that Hutchence's death might have resulted from autoerotic asphyxiation; this claim contradicted her previous statements to police investigators and the coroner.\nWhile researching for his 2019 documentary \"\", director Richard Lowenstein found six or seven interviews where Hutchence mentioned suicide, stating things such as: \"no one minds if you kill yourself\". Lowenstein also found stick figures that Hutchence had made of himself with a noose around his neck in his diaries from the 1980s. Lowenstein had access to Hutchence's full autopsy report and said there was no evidence of autoerotic asphyxiation in it. Hutchence's body being found naked also contributed to the myth created by Yates and spread by British tabloids that his death was the result from autoerotic asphyxiation. But his sister Tina said in her 2000 book \"Just a Man: The Real Michael Hutchence\" that he had the habit of sleeping naked since his teens. Lowenstein stated in a 2019 interview that Hutchence would often lounge naked in his hotel room, even when Lowenstein visited him. \"Unfortunately, Michael dying from autoerotic asphyxiation was a rumour spread after he died for certain people wanting to hide that he wasn't depressed, that he was more than happy. The press went berserk, but there was absolutely no evidence. [...] It just didn't add up. He's ringing his longtime girlfriend, Michele (Bennett), 20 minutes before (his death). You don't ring someone crying, balling your eyes out and then go off and have some autoeroticism 20 minutes later when she's banging on the door and you're not alive anymore. I don't think that's possible\", he said. Lowenstein also asked all of Hutchence's girlfriends if he liked being strangled or tied up, but all of them said \"no\".\nFuneral and memorial.\nOn 27 November 1997, Hutchence's funeral was held at St Andrew's Cathedral in Sydney and was attended by 600 people, including his family, bandmates, Paula Yates and their daughter, Hutchence's favourite singer, Tom Jones, and former girlfriends Kylie Minogue and Helena Christensen. The funeral was broadcast live on Australian television. His casket was carried out of the cathedral by members of INXS and his younger brother, Rhett; \"Never Tear Us Apart\" was played in the background. Nick Cave, a friend of Hutchence, performed his 1997 song \"Into My Arms\" during the funeral and requested that television cameras be switched off. Hutchence's parents asked that in lieu of flowers, donations should be sent to UNICEF and the Starlight Foundation. Rhett claimed in his 2004 book, \"Total XS\", that on the previous day at the funeral home, Yates had put a gram of heroin into Michael's pocket.\nHutchence was cremated and his ashes were divided into thirds between his parents, his siblings, and Yates and their daughter, following a battle between his family and Yates that started over Hutchence's wish to be cremated. The portion that went to his mother was buried at Forest Lawn Memorial Park in Hollywood Hills, California. The portion that went to his father was scattered into Sydney Harbour, in Rose Bay, on what would have been Hutchence's 38th birthday on 22 January 1998, and a tombstone was placed at Northern Suburbs Memorial Gardens in North Ryde, Sydney. Yates kept her portion of Hutchence's ashes in a cushion she slept with.\nLegacy.\nAfter Hutchence's death, INXS continued recording and performing until 2012. According to the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), INXS have sold 15\u00a0million units in the United States alone. As of 2018, INXS have sold over 50 million records worldwide. INXS were inducted into the ARIA Hall of Fame in 2001.\nHutchence's solo album, \"Michael Hutchence\", was released in October 1999. He had started on the album in 1995, recording songs in between INXS sessions; he had last worked on it three days before his death. The last song he recorded was \"Possibilities\". The album includes \"Slide Away\", a duet with U2's Bono; Bono's vocals were recorded after Hutchence's death. The 1999 movie \"Limp\" includes a cameo by Hutchence.\nOn 18 June 2000, Hutchence's mother Patricia Glassop and his sister Tina Hutchence released their book \"Just a Man: The Real Michael Hutchence\", which has been described as \"an odd biography\u00a0... [that] combines the basic facts of Hutchence's early life\u00a0... with an almost too-intimate view of the authors' feelings\".\nOn 20 August 2005, Melbourne's \"The Age\" reported on the disposition of Hutchence's estate and assets, which, although estimated at between $10\u00a0million and $20\u00a0million, amounted to virtually nothing. The remainder of his estate had reportedly been sold off or swallowed in legal fees.\nA documentary about Hutchence, \"Michael Hutchence: The Last Rockstar\", aired on Australia's Seven Network in 2017. In 2019, \"\"\u2014another documentary about Hutchence's life directed by Richard Lowenstein\u2014was released.\nDiscography.\nCountdown Australian Music Awards.\n\"Countdown\" was an Australian pop music TV series on national broadcaster ABC-TV from 1974 to 1987, it presented music awards from 1979 to 1987, initially in conjunction with magazine \"TV Week\". The TV Week / Countdown Awards were a combination of popular-voted and peer-voted awards.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Awards table/styles.css\" /&gt;\n! scope=\"col\" | Year\n! scope=\"col\" | Nominee / work\n! scope=\"col\" | Award\n! scope=\"col\" | Result\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "20270", "revid": "50629428", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20270", "title": "Motorola 68000", "text": "Microprocessor\nThe Motorola 68000 (sometimes shortened to Motorola 68k or m68k and usually pronounced \"sixty-eight-thousand\") is a 16/32-bit complex instruction set computer (CISC) microprocessor, introduced in 1979 by Motorola Semiconductor Products Sector.\nThe design implements a 32-bit instruction set, with 32-bit registers and a 16-bit internal data bus. The address bus is 24 bits and does not use memory segmentation, which made it easier to program for. Internally, it uses a 16-bit data arithmetic logic unit (ALU) and two 16-bit arithmetic units used mostly for addresses, and has a 16-bit external data bus. For this reason, Motorola termed it a 16/32-bit processor.\nAs one of the first widely available processors with a 32-bit instruction set, large unsegmented address space, and relatively high speed for the era, the 68k was a popular design through the 1980s. It was widely used in a new generation of personal computers with graphical user interfaces, including the Macintosh 128K, Amiga, Atari ST, and X68000, as well as video game consoles such as the Sega Genesis/Mega Drive console. Several arcade game systems also used the 68000.\nLater processors in the Motorola 68000 series, beginning with the Motorola 68020, use full 32-bit ALUs and have full 32-bit address and data buses, speeding up 32-bit operations and allowing 32-bit addressing, rather than the 24-bit addressing of the 68000 and 68010 or the 31-bit addressing of the Motorola 68012. The original 68k is generally software forward-compatible with the rest of the line despite being limited to a 16-bit wide external bus.\nAlthough the processors are no longer in production, functionally-identical clones and reproductions of the 68000 are still actively made.\nDevelopment.\n6800.\nMotorola's first widely produced microprocessor was the 6800, introduced in early 1974 and available in quantity late that year. The company set itself the goal of selling 25,000 units by September 1976, a goal they did meet. Although a capable design, it was eclipsed by more powerful designs, such as the Zilog Z80, and less expensive designs, such as the MOS Technology 6502. By late 1976, the sales book was flat and the division was only saved by a project for General Motors that turned into a huge product line for engine control and other tasks.\nMoving to 16-bit.\nBy the time the 6800 was introduced, a small number of 16-bit designs had come to market. These were generally modeled on minicomputer platforms like the Data General Nova or PDP-11. Based on the semiconductor manufacturing processes of the era, these were often multi-chip solutions like the National Semiconductor IMP-16, or the single-chip PACE that had issues with speed.\nWith the sales prospects for the 6800 dimming, but still cash-flush from the engine control sales, in late 1976 Colin Crook, Operations Manager, began considering how to successfully win future sales. They were aware that Intel was working on a 16-bit extension of their 8080 series, which would emerge as the Intel 8086, and had heard rumors of a 16-bit Zilog Z80, which became the Z8000. These would use new design techniques that would eliminate the problems seen in earlier 16-bit systems.\nMotorola knew that if they launched a product similar to the 8086, within 10% of its capabilities, Intel would outperform them in the market. In order to compete, they set themselves the goal of being two times as powerful at the same cost, or one-half the cost with the same performance. Crook decided that they would attack the high-end of the market with the most powerful processor on the market. Another 16-bit would not do, their design would have to be bigger, and that meant having some 32-bit features. Crook had decided on this approach by the end of 1976.\nMACSS.\nCrook formed the Motorola Advanced Computer System on Silicon (MACSS) project to build the design and hired Tom Gunter to be its principal architect. Gunter began forming his team in January 1977. The performance goal was set at 1 million instructions per second (MIPS). They wanted the design to not only win back microcomputer vendors like Apple Computer and Tandy, but also minicomputer companies like NCR and AT&amp;T.\nThe team decided to abandon an attempt at backward compatibility with the 6800, as they felt the 8-bit designs were too limited to be the basis for new designs. The new system was influenced by the PDP-11, the most popular minicomputer design of the era. At the time, a key concept in minis was the concept of an orthogonal instruction set, in which every operation was allowed to work on any sort of data. To feed the correct data into the internal units, MACSS made extensive use of microcode, essentially small programs in read only memory that gathered up the required data, performed the operations and wrote out the results. MACSS was among the first to use this technique in a microprocessor.\nThere was a large amount of support hardware for the 6800 that would remain useful, things like UARTs and similar interfacing systems. For this reason, the new design retained a bus protocol compatibility mode for existing 6800 peripheral devices.\nA chip with 32 data and 32 addressing pins would require 64 pins, plus more for power and other features. At the time, 64-pin dual inline package (DIP)s were \"large, heavy-cost\" systems and \"just terrible\", making that the largest they could consider. To make it fit, Crook selected a hybrid design, with a 32-bit instruction set architecture (ISA) but 16-bit components implementing it, like the arithmetic logic unit (ALU). The external interface was reduced to 16 data pins and 24 for addresses, allowing it all to fit in a 64-pin package. This became known as the \"Texas Cockroach\".\nBy the mid-1970s, Motorola's MOS design techniques had become less advanced than their competition, and their fabrication lines at times struggled with low yields. By the late-1970s, the company had entered a technology exchange program with Hitachi, dramatically improving their production capabilities. As part of this, a new fab named MOS-8 was built using the latest 5-inch wafer sizes and Intel's HMOS process with a 3.5\u00a0\u03bcm feature size. This was an investment aimed at catching the competition: even upstart semiconductor companies such as Zilog and MOS Technology had introduced CPUs fabricated on depletion-mode NMOS logic before Motorola did. In fact, Motorola may have substantially lagged contemporaries in phasing out enhancement mode and metal gate, with Gunter recollecting that the 68000 itself had to succeed despite initially adopting a metal-gate design. Though the point about playing catch-up is clear, this could not have been an entirely accurate summary because Motorola's 1976 datasheets, predating the inception of the MACCS project, denote the majority of its 6800 family in silicon-gate. Indeed, Gunter's own 1979 article introducing the 68000 highlighted it as a silicon-gate depletion-mode HMOS design. Whatever the degree of Motorola's process and manufacturing deficits in the early days, the team was undeterred and would not compromise in its pursuit of a microprocessor with industry-leading performance.\nSampling and production.\nFormally introduced in September 1979, initial samples were released in February 1980, with production chips available over the counter in November. Initial speed grades were 4, 6, and 8\u00a0MHz. 10\u00a0MHz chips became available during 1981, and 12.5\u00a0MHz chips by June 1982. The 16.67\u00a0MHz \"12F\" version of the MC68000, the fastest version of the original HMOS chip, was not produced until the late 1980s.\nBy the start of 1981, the 68k was winning orders in the high end, and Gunter began to approach Apple to win their business. At that time, the 68k sold for about $125 in quantity. In meetings with Steve Jobs, Jobs talked about using the 68k in the Apple Lisa, but stated \"the real future is in this product that I'm personally doing. If you want this business, you got to commit that you'll sell it for $15.\" Motorola countered by offering to sell it at $55 at first, then step down to $35, and so on. Jobs agreed, and the Macintosh moved from the 6809 to the 68k. The average price eventually reached $14.76.\nVariants.\nIn 1982, the 68000 received a minor update to its instruction set architecture (ISA) to support virtual memory and to conform to the Popek and Goldberg virtualization requirements. The updated chip is called the 68010. It also adds a new \"loop mode\" which speeds up small loops, and increases overall performance by about 10% at the same clock speeds. A further extended version, which exposes 31\u00a0bits of the address bus, was also produced in small quantities as the 68012.\nTo support lower-cost systems and control applications with smaller memory sizes, Motorola introduced the 8-bit compatible 68008, also in 1982. This is a 68000 with an 8-bit data bus and a smaller (20-bit) address bus. After 1982, Motorola devoted more attention to the 68020 and 88000 projects.\nSecond-sourcing.\nSeveral other companies were second-source manufacturers of the HMOS 68000. These included Hitachi (HD68000), who shrank the feature size to 2.7\u00a0\u03bcm for their 12.5\u00a0MHz version, Mostek (MK68000), Rockwell (R68000), Signetics (SCN68000), Thomson/SGS-Thomson (originally EF68000 and later TS68000), and Toshiba (TMP68000). Toshiba was also a second-source maker of the CMOS 68HC000 (TMP68HC000).\nEncrypted variants of the 68000 such as the Hitachi FD1089 and FD1094 store decryption keys for opcodes and opcode data in battery-backed memory. These were used in certain Sega arcade systems (including System 16 games) to prevent piracy and illegal bootleg games.\nCMOS versions.\nThe 68HC000, the first CMOS version of the 68000, was designed by Hitachi and jointly introduced in 1985. Motorola offered it as the MC68HC000 while Hitachi offered it as the HD68HC000. The 68HC000 offers speeds of 8\u201320\u00a0MHz. Aside from using CMOS circuitry, it behaved identically to the HMOS 68000, but the change to CMOS greatly reduced its power consumption. The original HMOS 68000 consumed around 1.35\u00a0watts at an ambient temperature of 25\u00a0\u00b0C, regardless of clock speed, while the 68HC000 consumed only 0.13\u00a0watts at 8\u00a0MHz and 0.38\u00a0watts at 20\u00a0MHz. (Unlike CMOS circuits, HMOS still draws power when idle, so power consumption varies little with clock rate.) Apple selected the 68HC000 for use in the Macintosh Portable and PowerBook 100.\nMotorola replaced the 68008 with the 68HC001 in 1990. It resembles the 68HC000 in most respects, but its data bus can operate in either 16-bit or 8-bit mode, depending on the value of an input pin at reset. Thus, like the 68008, it can be used in systems with cheaper 8-bit memories.\nThe later evolution of the 68000 focused on more modern embedded control applications and on-chip peripherals. The 68EC000 chip and SCM68000 core removed the M6800 peripheral bus, as well as excluding the MOVE from SR instruction from user mode programs, making the 68EC000 and 68SEC000 the only 68000 CPUs not 100% object code compatible with previous 68000 CPUs when run in User Mode. When run in Supervisor Mode, there is no difference. The latter method was done so that the 68EC000 and SCM68000 can meet Popek and Goldberg virtualization requirements, and was also later implemented into its successor, the 68010. In 1996, Motorola updated the standalone core with fully static circuitry, drawing only 2\u00a0\u03bcW in low-power mode; this became known as the 68SEC000.\nMotorola ceased production of the HMOS 68000 as well as the 68008, 68010, 68330, and 68340 on June 1, 1996, but its spin-off company Freescale Semiconductor (merged with NXP) was still producing the 68HC000, 68HC001, 68EC000 and 68SEC000, as well as the 68302 and 68306 microcontrollers and later versions of the DragonBall family. The 68000's architectural descendants, the 680x0, CPU32, and Coldfire families, were also still in production. More recently, with the Sendai fab closure in 2010, all 68HC000, 68020, 68030 and 68882 parts have been discontinued, leaving only the 68SEC000 in production until it too was discontinued. The only 68000-based processors in production was the 68302 as well as other variants in the 683xx family such as the 68331 and 68332 (which are derived from the 68000), although the 68302 stopped production in 2025, leaving only the 68331 and 68332 as the remaining members of the 683xx family in production.\nIn 2024, Rochester Electronics was given a license by NXP to continue producing the 68HC000 alongside other members of the 68000 family; both the physical design and test programs were transferred from NXP to Rochester in order to continue providing an authorized source to the market. The 68HC000 processors provided by Rochester Electronics uses a clone of the J82M mask set manufactured by Tohoku Semiconductor Corporation (TSC) in Japan at the TSC6 wafer fab, which was the last mask set used by Motorola for the 68HC000 to replace the previous E72N and G73K mask sets manufactured in the United States.\nAs a microcontroller core.\nSince being succeeded by \"true\" 32-bit microprocessors, the 68000 is used as the core of many microcontrollers. In 1989, Motorola introduced the 68302 communications processor. This processor was formerly supplied by Freescale and NXP after Motorola spun off its semiconductor business in 2004.\nApplications.\nIBM considered the 68000 for the IBM PC but chose the Intel 8088; however, IBM Instruments briefly sold the 68000-based IBM System 9000 laboratory computer systems. The 68k instruction set is particularly well suited to implement Unix, and the 68000 and its successors became the dominant CPUs for Unix-based workstations including Sun workstations and Apollo/Domain workstations.\nIn 1981, Motorola introduced the Motorola 68000 Educational Computer Board, a single-board computer for educational and training purposes which in addition to the 68000 itself contained memory, I/O devices, programmable timer and wire-wrap area for custom circuitry. The board remained in use in US colleges as a tool for learning assembly programming until the early 1990s.\nAt its introduction, the 68000 was first used in high-priced systems, including multiuser microcomputers like the WICAT 150, early Alpha Microsystems computers, Sage II / IV, Tandy 6000 / TRS-80 Model 16, and ; single-user workstations such as Hewlett-Packard's HP 9000 Series 200 systems, the first Apollo/Domain systems, Sun Microsystems' Sun-1, and the Corvus Concept; and graphics terminals like Digital Equipment Corporation's VAXstation 100 and Silicon Graphics' IRIS 1000 and 1200. Unix systems rapidly moved to the more capable later generations of the 68k line, which remained popular in that market throughout the 1980s.\nBy the mid-1980s, falling production cost made the 68000 viable for use in personal computers starting with the Apple Lisa and Macintosh, and followed by the Amiga, Atari ST, and X68000.\nThe Sinclair QL microcomputer, along with its derivatives, such as the ICL One Per Desk business terminal, was the most commercially important utilisation of the 68008. Helix Systems (in Missouri, United States) designed an extension to the SWTPC SS-50 bus, the SS-64, and produced systems built around the 68008 processor. 68000 and 68008 second processors were released for the BBC Micro in 1984 and 1985 respectively, and according to Steve Furber contributed to Acorn developing the ARM.\nWhile the adoption of RISC and x86 displaced the 68000 series as desktop/workstation CPU, the processor found substantial use in embedded applications. By the early 1990s, quantities of 68000 CPUs could be purchased for less than 30\u00a0USD per part.\nThe 68000 also saw great success as an embedded controller. As early as 1981, laser printers such as the Imagen Imprint-10 were controlled by external boards equipped with the 68000. The first HP LaserJet, introduced in 1984, came with a built-in 8\u00a0MHz 68000. Other printer manufacturers adopted the 68000, including Apple with its introduction of the LaserWriter in 1985, the first PostScript laser printer. The 68000 continued to be widely used in printers throughout the rest of the 1980s, persisting well into the 1990s in low-end printers.\nThe 68000 was successful in the field of industrial control systems. Among the systems benefited from having a 68000 or derivative as their microprocessor were families of programmable logic controllers (PLCs) manufactured by Allen-Bradley, Texas Instruments and subsequently, following the acquisition of that division of TI, by Siemens. Users of such systems do not accept product obsolescence at the same rate as domestic users, and it is entirely likely that despite having been installed over 20 years ago, many 68000-based controllers will continue in reliable service well into the 21st century.\nIn a number of digital oscilloscopes from the 80s, the 68000 has been used as a waveform display processor; some models including the LeCroy 9400/9400A also use the 68000 as a waveform math processor (including addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division of two waveforms/references/waveform memories), and some digital oscilloscopes using the 68000 (including the 9400/9400A) can also perform fast Fourier transform functions on a waveform.\nThe 683XX microcontrollers, based on the 68000 architecture, are used in networking and telecom equipment, television set-top boxes, laboratory and medical instruments, and even handheld calculators. The MC68302 and its derivatives have been used in many telecom products from Cisco, 3com, Ascend, Marconi, Cyclades and others. Past models of the Palm PDAs and the Handspring Visor used the DragonBall, a derivative of the 68000. AlphaSmart used the DragonBall family in later versions of its portable word processors. Texas Instruments used the 68000 in its high-end graphing calculators, the TI-89 and TI-92 series and Voyage 200.\nA modified version of the 68000 formed the basis of the IBM XT/370 hardware emulator of the System 370 processor.\nVideo games.\nVideo game manufacturers used the 68000 as the backbone of many arcade games and home game consoles: Atari's \"Food Fight\", from 1983, was one of the first 68000-based arcade games. Others included Sega's System 16, Capcom's CP System and CP System II, and SNK's Neo Geo. By the late 1980s, the 68000 was inexpensive enough to power home game consoles, such as Sega's Genesis console, and also the Sega CD attachment for it (a Sega CD system has three CPUs, two of them 68000s). The 68000 is also used as the main CPU of Sega's Pico, a young children's educational game console. The multi-processor Atari Jaguar console from 1993 used the 68000 as a support chip, however, due to familiarity, some developers used it as the primary processor. Sega's Saturn console from 1994 used the 68000 as a sound co-processor. In October 1995, the 68000 made it into Sega's Genesis Nomad, a handheld game console, as its CPU.\nCertain arcade games (such as \"Steel Gunner\" and others based on Namco System 2) use a dual 68000 CPU configuration, and systems with a triple 68000 CPU configuration also exist (such as \"Galaxy Force\" and others based on the Sega Y Board), along with a quad 68000 CPU configuration, which has been used by Jaleco (one 68000 for sound has a lower clock rate compared to the other 68000 CPUs) for games such as \"Big Run\" and \"Cisco Heat\"; another, fifth 68000 (at a different clock rate than the other 68000 CPUs) was used in the Jaleco arcade game \"Wild Pilot\" for input/output (I/O) processing.\nArchitecture.\nAddress bus.\nThe 68000 has a 24-bit external address bus and two byte-select signals \"replaced\" A0. These 24 lines can therefore address 16 MB of physical memory with byte resolution. Address storage and computation uses 32 bits internally; however, the 8 high-order address bits are ignored due to the physical lack of device pins. This allows it to run software written for a logically flat 32-bit address space, while accessing only a 24-bit physical address space. Motorola's intent with the internal 32-bit address space was forward compatibility, making it feasible to write 68000 software that would take full advantage of later 32-bit implementations of the 68000 instruction set.\nHowever, this did not prevent programmers from writing forward incompatible software. \"24-bit\" software that discarded the upper address byte, or used it for purposes other than addressing, could fail on 32-bit 68000 implementations. For example, early (pre-7.0) versions of Apple's Mac OS used the high byte of memory-block master pointers to hold flags such as \"locked\" and \"purgeable\". Later versions of the OS moved the flags to a nearby location, and Apple began shipping computers which had \"32-bit clean\" ROMs beginning with the release of the 1989 Mac IIci.\nThe 68000 family stores multi-byte integers in memory in big-endian order.\nInternal registers.\nThe CPU has eight 32-bit general-purpose data registers (D0-D7), and eight address registers (A0-A7). The last address register is the stack pointer, and assemblers accept the label SP as equivalent to A7. This was a good number of registers at the time in many ways. It was small enough to allow the 68000 to respond quickly to interrupts (even in the worst case where all 8 data registers D0\u2013D7 and 7 address registers A0\u2013A6 needed to be saved, 15 registers in total), and yet large enough to make most calculations fast, because they could be done entirely within the processor without keeping any partial results in memory. (Note that an exception routine in supervisor mode can also save the user stack pointer A7, which would total 8 address registers. However, the dual stack pointer (A7 and supervisor-mode A7') design of the 68000 makes this normally unnecessary, except when a task switch is performed in a multitasking system.)\nHaving the two types of registers allows the condition codes to remain unchanged when manipulating address registers. Also by splitting the 16 registers into two different types, they can be encoded by only three bits.\nStatus register.\nThe 68000 has a 16-bit status register. The upper 8 bits is the system byte, and modification of it is privileged. The lower 8 bits is the user byte, also known as the condition code register (CCR), and modification of it is not privileged. The 68000 comparison, arithmetic, and logic operations modify condition codes to record their results for use by later conditional jumps. The condition code bits are \"carry\" (C), \"overflow\" (V), \"zero\" (Z), \"negative\" (N) and \"extend\" (X). The \"extend\" (X) flag deserves special mention, because it is separate from the carry flag. This permits the extra bit from arithmetic, logic, and shift operations to be separated from the carry multiprecision arithmetic.\nInstruction set.\nThe designers attempted to make the assembly language orthogonal. That is, instructions are divided into operations and address modes, and almost all address modes are available for almost all instructions. There are 56 instructions and a minimum instruction size of 16 bits. Many instructions and addressing modes are longer to include more address or mode bits.\nPrivilege levels.\nThe CPU, and later the whole family, implements two levels of privilege. User mode gives access to everything except privileged instructions such as interrupt level controls. Supervisor privilege gives access to everything. An interrupt always becomes supervisory. The supervisor bit is stored in the status register, and is visible to user programs.\nAn advantage of this system is that the supervisor level has a separate stack pointer. This permits a multitasking system to use very small stacks for tasks, because the designers do not have to allocate the memory required to hold the stack frames of a maximum stack-up of interrupts.\nInterrupts.\nThe CPU recognizes seven interrupt levels. Levels 1 through 5 are strictly prioritized. That is, a higher-numbered interrupt can always interrupt a lower-numbered interrupt. In the status register, a privileged instruction allows setting the current minimum interrupt level, blocking lower or equal priority interrupts. For example, if the interrupt level in the status register is set to 3, higher levels from 4 to 7 can cause an exception. Level 7 is a level triggered non-maskable interrupt (NMI). Level 1 can be interrupted by any higher level. Level 0 means no interrupt. The level is stored in the status register, and is visible to user-level programs.\nHardware interrupts are signalled to the CPU using three inputs that encode the highest pending interrupt priority. A separate encoder is usually required to encode the interrupts, though for systems that do not require more than three hardware interrupts it is possible to connect the interrupt signals directly to the encoded inputs at the cost of more software complexity. The interrupt controller can be as simple as a 74LS148 priority encoder, or may be part of a very large-scale integration (VLSI) peripheral chip such as the MC68901 Multi-Function Peripheral (used in the Atari ST range of computers and X68000), which also provides a UART, timer, and parallel I/O.\nThe \"exception table\" (interrupt vector table interrupt vector addresses) is fixed at addresses 0 through 1023, permitting 256 32-bit vectors. The first vector (RESET) consists of two vectors, namely the starting stack address, and the starting code address. Vectors 3 through 15 are used to report various errors: bus error, address error, illegal instruction, zero division, CHK and CHK2 vector, privilege violation (to block privilege escalation), and some reserved vectors that became line 1010 emulator, line 1111 emulator, and hardware breakpoint. Vector 24 starts the real interrupts: spurious interrupt (no hardware acknowledgement), and level 1 through level 7 autovectors, then the 16\u00a0TRAP vectors, then some more reserved vectors, then the user defined vectors.\nSince the starting code address vector must always be valid on reset, systems commonly included some nonvolatile memory (e.g. ROM) starting at address zero to contain the vectors and bootstrap code. However, for a general purpose system it is desirable for the operating system to be able to change the vectors at runtime. This was often accomplished by either pointing the vectors in ROM to a jump table in RAM, or through use of bank switching to allow the ROM to be replaced by RAM at runtime.\nThe 68000 does not meet the Popek and Goldberg virtualization requirements for full processor virtualization because it has a single unprivileged instruction, \"MOVE from SR\", which allows user-mode software read-only access to a small amount of privileged state. The 68EC000 and 68SEC000, which are later derivatives of the 68000, do meet the requirements as the \"MOVE from SR\" instruction is privileged. The same change was introduced on the 68010 and later CPUs.\nThe 68000 is also unable to easily support virtual memory, which requires the ability to trap and recover from a failed memory access. The 68000 does provide a bus error exception which can be used to trap, but it does not save enough processor state to resume the faulted instruction once the operating system has handled the exception. Several companies did succeed in making 68000-based Unix workstations with virtual memory that worked by using two 68000 chips running in parallel on different phased clocks. When the \"leading\" 68000 encountered a bad memory access, extra hardware would interrupt the \"main\" 68000 to prevent it from also encountering the bad memory access. This interrupt routine would handle the virtual memory functions and restart the \"leading\" 68000 in the correct state to continue properly synchronized operation when the \"main\" 68000 returned from the interrupt.\nThese problems were fixed in the next major revision of the 68k architecture with the release of the MC68010. The Bus Error and Address Error exceptions push a large amount of internal state onto the supervisor stack in order to facilitate recovery, and the \"MOVE from SR\" instruction was made privileged. A new unprivileged \"MOVE from CCR\" instruction is provided for use in its place by user mode software; an operating system can trap and emulate user mode \"MOVE from SR\" instructions if desired.\nInstruction set details.\nThe standard addressing modes are:\nPlus: access to the status register, and, in later models, other special registers.\nMost instructions have variants that operate on 8-bit bytes, 16-bit words, and 32-bit longs; assembler languages use dot-letter suffixes \".b\", \".w\", and \".l\" after the instruction mnemonic to indicate the variant.\nLike many CPUs of its era the cycle timing of some instructions varied depending on the source operand(s). For example, the unsigned multiply instruction takes (38+2n) clock cycles to complete where 'n' is equal to the number of bits set in the operand. To create a function that took a fixed cycle count required the addition of extra code after the multiply instruction. This would typically consume extra cycles for each bit that wasn't set in the original multiplication operand.\nMost instructions are dyadic, that is, the operation has a source, and a destination, and the destination is changed. Notable instructions are:\n68EC000.\nThe 68EC000 is a low-cost version of the 68000 with a slightly different pinout, designed for embedded controller applications. The 68EC000 can have either a 8-bit or 16-bit data bus, switchable at reset. The processors also have some minor changes to confirm to the Popek and Goldberg virtualization requirements, which includes the MOVE from SR instruction being privileged.\nThe processors are available in a variety of speeds including 8 and 16\u00a0MHz configurations, producing 2,100 and 4,376\u00a0Dhrystones each. These processors have no floating-point unit, and it is difficult to implement an FPU coprocessor (MC68881/2) with one because the EC series lacks necessary coprocessor instructions.\nThe 68EC000 was used as a controller in many audio applications, including Ensoniq musical instruments and sound cards, where it was part of the MIDI synthesizer. On Ensoniq sound boards, the controller provided several advantages compared to competitors without a CPU on board. The processor allowed the board to be configured to perform various audio tasks, such as MPU-401 MIDI synthesis or MT-32 emulation, without the use of a terminate-and-stay-resident program. This improved software compatibility, lowered CPU usage, and eliminated host system memory usage.\nThe Motorola 68EC000 core was later used in the m68k-based DragonBall processors from Motorola/Freescale.\nIt also was used as a sound controller in the Sega Saturn game console and as a controller for the HP JetDirect Ethernet controller boards for the mid-1990s HP LaserJet printers.\nExample code.\nThe 68000 assembly code below is for a subroutine named , which copies a null-terminated string of 8-bit characters to a destination string, converting all alphabetic characters to lower case.\nThe subroutine establishes a call frame using register A6 as the frame pointer. This kind of calling convention supports reentrant and recursive code and is typically used by languages like C and C++. The subroutine then retrieves the parameters passed to it ( and ) from the stack. It then loops, reading an ASCII character (one byte) from the string, checking whether it is a capital alphabetic character, and if so, converting it into a lower-case character, otherwise leaving it as it is, then writing the character into the string. Finally, it checks whether the character was a null character; if not, it repeats the loop, otherwise it restores the previous stack frame (and A6 register) and returns. Note that the string pointers (registers A0 and A1) are auto-incremented in each iteration of the loop.\nIn contrast, the code below is for a stand-alone function, even on the most restrictive version of AMS for the TI-89 series of calculators, being kernel-independent, with no values looked up in tables, files or libraries when executing, no system calls, no exception processing, minimal registers to be used, nor the need to save any. It is valid for historical Julian dates from 1 March 1 AD, or for Gregorian ones. In less than two dozen operations it calculates a day number compatible with ISO 8601 when called with three inputs stored at their corresponding LOCATIONS:\n ; WDN, an address - for storing result d0\n ; FLAG, 0 or 2 - to choose between Julian or Gregorian, respectively\n ; DATE, year0mda - date stamp as binary word&amp;byte&amp;byte in basic ISO-format\n ;(YEAR, year ~ YEAR=DATE due to big-endianness)\n \n ;\n ; Apply step 1 - Lachman's congruence\n \n \n ;\n ; Apply step 2 - Finding spqr as the year of the Julian leap day preceding DATE\n \n \n \n \n ; (Apply step 0 - Gregorian adjustment)\n \n \n \n \n ;\n \n ; Days of the week correspond to day numbers of the week as:\n ; Sun=0 Mon=1 Tue=2 Wed=3 Thu=4 Fri=5 Sat=6\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Minicomputers are small relative to earlier and bigger machines.\nThe class formed a distinct group with its own software architectures and operating systems. Minis were designed for control, instrumentation, human interaction, and communication switching, as distinct from calculation and record keeping. Many were sold indirectly to original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) for final end-use application. During the two-decade lifetime of the minicomputer class (1965\u20131985), almost 100 minicomputer vendor companies formed. Only a half-dozen remained by the mid-1980s.\nWhen single-chip MOSFET CPU microprocessors appeared in the 1970s, the definition of \"minicomputer\" subtly shifted: the word came to mean a machine in the middle range of the computing spectrum, between mainframe computers and microcomputers. The easily-misunderstood term \"minicomputer\" is less often applied to later like systems; a near-synonymous (IBM-adjacent) expert term for this class of system is \"midrange computer\".\nHistory.\nDefinition.\nThe term \"minicomputer\" developed in the 1960s to describe the smaller computers that became possible with the use of transistors and core memory technologies, minimal instruction sets and less expensive peripherals such as the ubiquitous Teletype Model\u00a033 ASR. They usually took up one or a few 19-inch rack cabinets, compared with the large mainframes that could fill a room. Later minicomputers tended to be more compact, and while still distinct in terms of architecture and function, some models eventually shrank to a similar size as large microcomputers.\nIn terms of relative computing power compared to contemporary mainframes, small systems that were similar to minicomputers had been available from the 1950s. In particular, there was an entire class of compact vacuum tube-based drum machines, such as the UNIVAC 1101 (1950), and the Bendix G-15 and LGP-30 (both 1956), all of which shared some features of the minicomputer class. Similar models using magnetic delay-line memory followed in the early 1960s. These machines, however, were essentially designed as small mainframes, using a custom chassis and often supporting only peripherals from the same company. In contrast, the machines that became known as minicomputers were often designed to fit into a standard chassis and deliberately designed to use common devices such as the ASR\u00a033.\nAnother common difference was that most small machines before the 1970s were not \"general purpose\", in that they were designed for a specific role such as engineering,13 process control or accounting. On these machines, programming was generally carried out in their custom machine language, or even hard-coded into a plugboard, although some used a form of \"BASIC\". DEC wrote, regarding their PDP-5, that it was \"the world\u2019s first commercially produced minicomputer\". It meets most definitions of \"mini\" in terms of power and size, but was designed and built to be used as an instrumentation system in labs, not as a general-purpose computer. Many similar examples of small special-purpose machines exist from the early 1960s, including the UK Ferranti Argus and Soviet UM-1NKh.\nThe CDC 160, circa 1960, is sometimes pointed to as an early example of a minicomputer, as it was small, transistorized and (relatively) inexpensive. However, its basic price of $100,000 () and custom desk-like chassis places it within the \"small system\" or \"midrange computer\" category as opposed to the more modern use of the term minicomputer. Nevertheless, the CDC 160 remains a strong contender for the term \"first minicomputer\", provided the earlier drum machines, e.g. SEA CAB 500, are excluded as non-transistorized.\n1960s and 1970s success.\nMost computing histories point to the 1964 introduction of Digital Equipment Corporation's (DEC) Programmed Data Processor (PDP) series, with the 12-bit PDP-8 as the first minicomputer. Some of this is no doubt due to DEC's widespread use of the term starting in the mid-1960s. Smaller systems, including those from DEC such as the PDP-5 and LINC, had existed prior to this point, but it was the PDP-8 combination of small size, general purpose orientation and low price that puts it firmly within the modern definition. Its introductory price of $18,500 () places it in an entirely different market segment than earlier examples such as the CDC 160.\nIn contemporary terms, the PDP-8 was a runaway success, ultimately selling 50,000 examples. Follow-on versions using small scale integrated circuits further lowered the cost and size of the system. Its success led to widespread imitation, and the creation of an entire industry of minicomputer companies along Massachusetts Route 128, including Data General, Wang Laboratories and Prime Computer. Other popular minis from the era were the HP 2100, Honeywell 316 and TI-990.\nEarly minis had a variety of word sizes, with DEC's 12 and 18-bit systems being typical examples. The introduction and standardization of the 7-bit ASCII character set led to the move to 16-bit systems, with the late-1969 Data General Nova being a notable entry in this space. By the early 1970s, most minis were 16-bit, including DEC's PDP-11. For a time, \"minicomputer\" was almost synonymous with \"16-bit\", as the larger mainframe machines almost always used 32-bit or larger word sizes.\nIn a 1970 survey, \"The New York Times\" suggested a consensus definition of a minicomputer as a machine costing less than US$ (), with an input-output device such as a teleprinter and at least four thousand words of memory, that is capable of running programs in a higher level language, such as Fortran or BASIC. The typical customer was a department in a large company, at which the finance department's mainframe was too busy to serve others.12\nAs integrated circuit design improved, especially with the introduction of the 7400-series integrated circuits, minicomputers became smaller, easier to manufacture, and as a result, less expensive. They were used in manufacturing process control, telephone switching and to control laboratory equipment. In the 1970s, they were the hardware that was used to launch the computer-aided design (CAD) industry and other similar industries where a small dedicated system was needed.\nThe boom in worldwide seismic exploration for oil and gas in the early 1970s saw the widespread use of minicomputers in dedicated processing centres close to the data collection crews. Raytheon Data Systems RDS 704 and later RDS 500 were predominantly the systems of choice for nearly all the geophysical exploration as well as oil companies.\nAt the launch of the MITS Altair 8800 in 1975, \"Radio Electronics\" magazine referred to the system as a \"minicomputer\", although the term microcomputer soon became usual for personal computers based on single-chip microprocessors. At the time, microcomputers were 8-bit single-user, relatively simple machines running simple program-launcher operating systems such as CP/M or MS-DOS, while minis were much more powerful systems that ran full multi-user, multitasking operating systems, such as VMS and Unix.\nThe Tandem Computers NonStop product line shipped its first fully fault-tolerant cluster computer in 1976.\nAround the same time, minis began to move upward in size. Although several 24 and 32-bit minis had entered the market earlier, it was DEC's 1977 VAX, which they referred to as a superminicomputer, or supermini, that caused the mini market to move en-masse to 32-bit architectures. This provided ample headroom even as single-chip 16-bit microprocessors such as the TMS 9900 and Zilog Z8000 appeared in the later 1970s. Most mini vendors introduced their own single-chip processors based on their own architecture and used these mostly in low-cost offerings while concentrating on their 32-bit systems. Examples include the Intersil 6100 single-chip PDP-8, DEC T-11 PDP-11, microNOVA and Fairchild 9440 Nova, and TMS9900 TI-990.\nMid-1980s and 1990s decline.\nMinicomputer companies historically competed on the price and speed of their computers, instead of marketing and advertising. By the early 1980s, the 16-bit minicomputer market had all but disappeared as newer 32-bit microprocessors began to improve in performance. Those customers who required more performance than these offered had generally already moved to 32-bit systems by this time. But it was not long before this market also began to come under threat; the Motorola 68000 offered a significant percentage of the performance of a typical mini in a desktop platform. True 32-bit processors such as the National Semiconductor NS32016, Motorola 68020 and Intel 80386 soon followed. By the mid-1980s, high-end microcomputers offered CPU performance equal to low-end and mid-range minis, and the new RISC approach promised performance levels well beyond the fastest minis, and even high-end mainframes.\nAll that really separated micros from the mini market was storage and memory capacity. Both of these began to be addressed through the later 1980s; 1 MB of RAM became typical by around 1987, desktop hard drives rapidly pushed past the 100 MB range by 1990, and the introduction of inexpensive and easily deployable local area network (LAN) systems provided solutions for those looking for multi-user systems. The introduction of workstations opened new markets for graphics-based systems that the terminal-oriented minis could not even address. Minis remained a force for those using existing software products or those who required high-performance multitasking, but the introduction of newer operating systems based on Unix began to yield highly practical replacements for these roles as well. For computational science, clusters of commodity PCs largely replaced minicomputers.\nMini vendors began to rapidly disappear through this period. Data General responded to the changing market by focusing entirely on the high-performance file server market, embracing a role within large LANs that appeared resilient. This did not last; Novell NetWare rapidly pushed such solutions into niche roles, and later versions of Microsoft Windows did the same to Novell. DEC decided to move into the large-computer space instead, introducing the VAX 9000 mainframe in 1989, but it was a flop in the market and disappeared after almost no sales. The company then attempted to enter the workstation and server markets with the DEC Alpha, but was too late to save the company, and they eventually sold their remains to Compaq in 1998. By the end of the decade all of the classic vendors were gone; Data General, Prime, Computervision, Honeywell, and Wang, failed, merged, or were bought out.\nToday, only a few proprietary minicomputer architectures survive. The IBM System/38 operating system, which introduced many advanced concepts, lives on with IBM's AS/400. Great efforts were made by IBM to enable programs originally written for the IBM System/34 and System/36 to be moved to the AS/400. After being rebranded multiple times, the AS/400 platform was replaced by IBM Power Systems running IBM i. In contrast, competing proprietary computing architectures from the early 1980s, such as DEC's VAX, Wang VS, and Hewlett-Packard's HP 3000 have long been discontinued without a compatible upgrade path. OpenVMS was ported to HP Alpha and Intel IA-64 (Itanium) CPU architectures, and now runs on x86-64 processors.\nTandem Computers, which specialized in reliable large-scale computing, was acquired by Compaq in 1997, and in 2001 the combined entity merged with Hewlett-Packard. The NonStop Kernel-based NonStop product line was re-ported from MIPS processors to Itanium-based processors branded as 'HP Integrity NonStop Servers'. As in the earlier migration from stack machines to MIPS microprocessors, all customer software was carried forward without source changes. The NSK operating system, now termed NonStop OS, continues as the base software environment for the NonStop Servers, and has been extended to include support for Java and integration with popular development tools such as Visual Studio and Eclipse. Later, Hewlett-Packard would split into HP and Hewlett-Packard Enterprise. The NonStop products and the DEC products would then be sold by HPE.\nIndustrial impact and heritage.\nDatabase software is an example of an area where a variety of companies emerged that built turnkey systems around minicomputers with specialized software and, in many cases, custom peripherals that addressed specialized problems such as computer-aided design, computer-aided manufacturing, process control, manufacturing resource planning, and so on. Many if not most minicomputers were sold through these original equipment manufacturers and value-added resellers.\nSeveral pioneering computer companies first built minicomputers, such as DEC, Data General, and Hewlett-Packard (HP) (who later referred to its HP 3000 minicomputers as \"servers\" rather than \"minicomputers\"). And although today's PCs and servers are clearly microcomputers physically, architecturally their CPUs and operating systems have developed largely by integrating features from minicomputers.\nIn the software context, the relatively simple OSs for early microcomputers were usually inspired by minicomputer OSs (such as CP/M's similarity to Digital's single user OS/8 and RT-11 and multi-user RSTS time-sharing system). Also, the multiuser OSs of today are often either inspired by, or directly descended from, minicomputer OSs. Unix was originally a minicomputer OS, while the Windows NT kernel, the foundation for all current versions of Microsoft Windows, borrowed design ideas liberally from VMS. Many of the first generation of PC programmers were educated on minicomputer systems.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Most APCs and IFVs are fully tracked or are all-wheel drive vehicles (6\u00d76 or 8\u00d78), for mobility across rough ground. Some militaries distinguish between mechanized and armored (or armoured) infantry, designating troops carried by APCs as mechanized and those in IFVs as armored.\nThe support weapons for mechanized infantry are also provided with motorized transport, or they are built directly into combat vehicles to keep pace with the mechanized infantry in combat. For units equipped with most types of APC or any type of IFV, fire support weapons, such as machine guns, autocannons, small-bore direct-fire howitzers, and anti-tank guided missiles are often mounted directly on the infantry's own transport vehicles.\nCompared with \"light\" truck-mobile infantry, mechanized infantry can maintain rapid tactical movement and, if mounted in IFVs, have more integral firepower. They require more combat supplies (ammunition and especially fuel) and ordnance supplies (spare vehicle components), and a comparatively larger proportion of manpower is required to crew and maintain the vehicles. For example, most APCs mount a section of seven or eight infantrymen but have a crew of two. Most IFVs carry only six or seven infantry but require a crew of three. To be effective in the field, mechanized units also require many mechanics, with specialized maintenance and recovery vehicles and equipment.\nHistory.\nAs early as 1915 the British instigated a tracked vehicle that could carry 50 equipped troops under armour but the project got no further than trials before cancellation. Some of the first mechanized infantry were German assault teams mounted on A7V tanks during World War I. The vehicles were extra-large to let them carry sizeable assault teams and would regularly carry infantry on board in addition to their already large crews that were trained as stormtroopers. All machine-gun-armed A7V tanks carried two small flamethrowers for their dismounts to use. A7V tank would often carry a second officer to lead the assault team.\nDuring the Battle of St. Quentin in late March 1918, A7Vs were accompanied by twenty stormtroopers from Rohr Assault Battalion, but it is unspecified if they were acting as dismounts or were accompanying the tanks on foot. During the battle, tank crews were reported to have dismounted and attacked enemy positions with grenades and flamethrowers on numerous occasions.\nAnother example is the capture of Villers-Bretonneux, in which A7Vs suppressed the defenders with machine gun fire and assault teams dismounted to attack them with grenades.\nThe British heavy tank design was given an extended hull to cross wide German trenches. This Mark V** had space for fourteen troops. The Mark IX tank based on the Mark V was designed solely for carrying troops with space for 30 but the war ended before the order was complete and they could be used.\nTowards the end of World War I, all the armies involved were faced with the problem of maintaining the momentum of an attack. Tanks, artillery, or infiltration tactics could all be used to break through an enemy defense, but almost all offensives launched in 1918 ground to a halt after a few days. The following infantry quickly became exhausted, and artillery, supplies and fresh formations could not be brought forward over the battlefields quickly enough to maintain the pressure on the regrouping enemy forces.\nIt was widely acknowledged that cavalry was too vulnerable to be used on most European battlefields, but many armies continued to deploy them. Motorized infantry could maintain rapid movement, but their trucks required either a good road network or firm open terrain, such as desert. They were unable to traverse a battlefield obstructed by craters, barbed wire, and trenches. Tracked or all-wheel drive vehicles were to be the solution.\nFollowing the war, development of mechanized forces was largely theoretical for some time, but many nations began rearming in the 1930s. The British Army had established an Experimental Mechanized Force in 1927, but it failed to pursue that line because of budget constraints and the prior need to garrison the frontiers of the British Empire.\nAlthough some proponents of mobile warfare, such as J. F. C. Fuller, advocated building \"tank fleets\", other, such as Heinz Guderian in Germany, Adna R. Chaffee Jr. in the United States, and Mikhail Tukhachevsky in the Soviet Union, recognized that tank units required close support from infantry and other arms and that such supporting arms needed to maintain the same pace as the tanks.\nAs the Germans rearmed in the 1930s, they equipped some infantry units in their new Panzer divisions with the half-track Sd.Kfz. 251, which could keep up with tanks on most terrain. The French Army also created \"light mechanized\" (\"l\u00e9g\u00e8re m\u00e9canis\u00e9e\") divisions in which some of the infantry units possessed small tracked carriers. Together with the motorization of the other infantry and support units, this gave both armies highly mobile combined-arms formations. The German doctrine was to use them to exploit breakthroughs in \"Blitzkrieg\" offensives, whereas the French envisaged them being used to shift reserves rapidly in a defensive battle.\nWorld War II.\nAs World War II progressed, most major armies integrated tanks or assault guns with mechanized infantry, as well as other supporting arms, such as artillery and combat engineers, as combined arms units.\nAllied armored formations included a mechanized infantry element for combined arms teamwork. For example, US armored divisions had a balance of three battalions each of tanks, armored infantry, and self-propelled artillery. The US armored infantry was fully equipped with M2 and M3 halftracks. In the British and Commonwealth armies, \"Type A armoured brigades,\" intended for independent operations or to form part of armored divisions, had a \"motor infantry\" battalion mounted in Universal Carriers or later in lend-lease halftracks. \"Type B\" brigades lacked a motor infantry component and were subordinated to infantry formations.\nThe Canadian Army and, subsequently the British Army, used expedients such as the Kangaroo APC, usually for specific operations rather than to create permanent mechanized infantry formations. The first such operation was Operation Totalize in the Battle of Normandy, which failed to achieve its ultimate objectives but showed that mechanized infantry could incur far fewer casualties than dismounted troops in set-piece operations.\nThe German Army, having introduced mechanized infantry in its \"Panzer\" divisions, later named them units. In the middle of the war, it created entire mechanized infantry divisions and named divisions.\nBecause the German economy could not produce adequate numbers of its half-track APC, barely a quarter or a third of the infantry in Panzer or divisions were mechanized, except in a few favored formations. The rest were moved by truck. However, most German reconnaissance units in such formations were also primarily mechanized infantry and could undertake infantry missions when it was needed. The Allies generally used jeeps, armored cars, or light tanks for reconnaissance.\nThe Red Army began the war while still in the process of reorganizing its armored and mechanized formations, most of which were destroyed during the first months of the German Invasion of the Soviet Union. About a year later, the Soviets recreated division-sized mechanized infantry units, termed mechanized corps, usually with one tank brigade and three mechanized infantry brigades, with motorized supporting arms. They were generally used in the exploitation phase of offensives, as part of the prewar Soviet concept of deep operations.\nThe Soviet Army also created several cavalry mechanized groups in which tanks, mechanized infantry and horsed cavalry were mixed. They were also used in the exploitation and pursuit phases of offensives. Red Army mechanized infantry were generally carried on tanks or trucks, with only a few dedicated lend-lease half-track APCs.\nThe New Zealand Army ultimately fielded a division of a roughly similar composition to a Soviet mechanized corps, which fought in the Italian Campaign, but it had little scope for mobile operations until near the end of the war.\nThe Romanian Army fielded a mixed assortment of vehicles. These amounted to 126 French-designed Renault UE Chenillettes which were licence-built locally, 34 captured and refurbished Soviet armored tractors, 27 German-made armored half-tracks of the Sd.Kfz. 250 and Sd.Kfz. 251 types, over 200 Czechoslovak Tatra, Praga and Skoda trucks (the Tatra trucks were a model which was specifically built for the Romanian Army) as well as 300 German Horch 901 4x4 field cars. Sd.Kfz. 8 and Sd.Kfz. 9 half-tracks were also acquired, as well as nine vehicles of the Sd.Kfz. 10 type and 100 RSO/01 fully tracked tractors. The Romanians also produced five prototypes of an indigenous artillery tractor.\nCold War.\nOn July 9, 1945, Decree of the State Defence Committee No. GKO-9488ss, \"On the Resupply of Armored and Mechanized Forces of the Red Army\" was issued. It ordered the creation of mechanised divisions from many rifle divisions, included in the Armored and Mechanised Troops. In some cases, cavalry divisions and airborne divisions also became mechanised divisions The Soviet \"motorised rifle troops\" officially appeared in accordance with the Directive of the Minister of Defense of the USSR No. org. / 3/62540 of February 27, 1957. This directive ordered part of the mechanized divisions and all rifle units and formations reorganized into 'motorised rifle' in the period 1957 to 1964. Creation of the motorised rifle troops was facilitated by large-scale mechanisation of the whole Soviet Ground Forces.\nThis became possible due to the increase in the production of armored personnel carriers, self-propelled guns and so on. For example, in the period before the formation and in the initial period of the formation of the \"motorized rifle troops\":\nOne or two motorised rifle regiments were also present in each tank division, and many tank regiments included one motorised rifle battalion.\nAfter 1945, the Soviet Armed Forces and NATO further developed the equipment and doctrine for mechanized infantry. With the exception of airborne formations, the Red Army mechanized all its infantry formations. Initially, wheeled APCs, like the BTR-152, were used, some of which lacked overhead protection and were therefore vulnerable to artillery fire. It still gave the Soviet Army greater strategic flexibility because of the large land area and the long borders of the Soviet Union and its allies in the Warsaw Pact. Armored vehicles meant infantry were capable of overcoming water barriers and having means of protection against Weapons of Mass Destruction.\nThe US Army established the basic configuration of the tracked APC with the M75 and M59 before it adopted the lighter M113, which could be carried by Lockheed C-130 Hercules and other transport aircraft. The vehicle gave infantry the same mobility as tanks but with much less effective armor protection (it still had nuclear, biological, and chemical protection).\nIn the Vietnam War, the M113 was often fitted with extra armament and used as an \"ad hoc\" infantry fighting vehicle. Early operations by the Army of the Republic of Vietnam using the vehicle showed that troops were far more effective while they were mounted in the vehicles than when they dismounted. American doctrine subsequently emphasized mounted tactics. The Americans ultimately deployed a mechanized brigade and ten mechanized battalions to Vietnam.\nThe \"motorized rifle troops\" of the Soviet Armed Forces were the world's first infantry units that adopted a new class of combat vehicles in 1966 \u2013 Infantry fighting vehicles. BMP-1 began entering service in 1966. In the Federal Republic of Germany, an approximate analogue, the Marder, appeared only in 1970. Unlike the APC, which was intended merely to transport the infantry from place to place under armor, the IFV had heavy firepower that could support infantry. The Infantry fighting vehicle concept was subsequently copied by almost all countries of the world.\nThe introduction of the BMP-1 prompted the development of similar vehicles in Western armies, such as the West German Marder and American M2 Bradley. Many IFVs were also equipped with firing ports from which their infantry could fire their weapons from inside, but they were generally not successful and have been dropped from modern IFVs.\nSoviet organization led to different tactics between the \"light\" and the \"heavy\" varieties of mechanized infantry. In the Soviet Army, a first-line \"motor rifle\" division from the 1970s onward usually had two regiments equipped with wheeled BTR-60 APCs and one with the tracked BMP-1 IFV. The \"light\" regiments were intended to make dismounted attacks on the division's flanks, while the BMP-equipped \"heavy\" regiment remained mounted and supported the division's tank regiment on the main axis of advance. Both types of infantry regiment still were officially titled \"motor rifle\" units.\nA line of development in the Soviet Armed Forces from the 1980s was the provision of specialized IFVs for use by the Russian Airborne Troops. The first of them was the BMD-1, which had the same firepower as the BMP-1 but could be carried in or even parachuted from the standard Soviet transport aircraft. That made airborne formations into mechanized infantry at the cost of reducing their \"bayonet\" strength, as the BMD could carry only three or at most four paratroopers in addition to its three-man crew. They were used in that role in the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in 1979.\nPresent day.\nAt present, almost all infantry units from industrialized nations are provided with some type of motor transport. Infantry units equipped with IFVs rather than lighter vehicles are commonly designated as \"heavy\", indicating more combat power but also more costly long-range transportation requirements. In Operation Desert Shield, during the buildup phase of the First Gulf War, the U.S. Army was concerned about the lack of mobility, protection and firepower offered by existing rapid deployment (i.e., airborne) formations; and also about the slowness of deploying regular armored units. The experience led the U.S. Army to form combat brigades based on the Stryker wheeled IFV.\nIn the British Army, \"heavy\" units equipped with the Warrior IFV are described as \"armoured infantry\", and units with the Bulldog APC as \"mechanised infantry\". This convention is becoming widespread; for example the French Army has \"\"motoris\u00e9es\" units equipped with the wheeled VAB and \"m\u00e9canis\u00e9es\"\" units with the tracked AMX-10P.\nThe transport and other logistic requirements have led many armies to adopt wheeled APCs when their existing stocks of tracked APCs require replacement. An example is the Canadian Army, which has used the LAV III wheeled IFV in fighting in Afghanistan. The Italian, Spanish and Swedish armies are adopting (and exporting) new indigenous-produced tracked IFVs. The Swedish CV90 IFV in particular has been adopted by several armies.\nA recent trend seen in the Israel Defense Forces and the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation is the development and introduction of exceptionally well-armored APCs (HAPC), such as the IDF Achzarit, that are converted from obsolete main battle tanks (such as the Soviet T-55). Such vehicles are usually expedients, and lack of space prevents the armament of an IFV being carried in addition to an infantry section or squad. In the Russian Army, such vehicles were introduced for fighting in urban areas, where the risk from short range infantry anti-tank weapons, such as the RPG-7, is highest, after Russian tank and motor infantry units suffered heavy losses fighting Chechen troops in Grozny during the First Chechen War in 1995.\nMany APCs and IFVs currently under development are intended for rapid deployment by aircraft. New technologies that promise reduction in weight, such as electric drive, may be incorporated. However, facing a similar threat in post-invasion Iraq to that which prompted the Russians to convert tanks to APCs, the occupying armies have found it necessary to apply extra armor to existing APCs and IFVs, which adds to the overall size and weight. Some of the latest designs (such as the German Puma) are intended to allow a light, basic model vehicle, which is air-transportable, to be fitted in the field with additional protection, thereby ensuring both strategic flexibility and survivability.\nMedium mechanized forces.\nIn the late Cold War and early 21st century, various countries developed medium infantry forces armed with armored vehicles, which typically consisted of wheeled armored personnel carriers, infantry fighting vehicles, and assault guns. Medium mechanized forces are characterized by having more strategic air and road mobility than heavier, tank-based armored forces while offering better armor protection for the formation than the lighter motorized infantry formation, in which vehicles were considered \"battle taxis\" due to poor protection. The earliest experiment was the short-lived Soviet Light Motor Rifle Division in 1987, which consisted of wheeled BTR platforms for its primary armament. In the 1990s, the United States explored Stryker Brigade Combat Team (SBCT) formation and doctrines, which was a medium mechanized infantry formation with all-wheeled platforms centered around Stryker armored personnel carrier. In the early 21st century, China reformed its ground forces with the concept called Medium Combined Arms Brigade (CA-BDE), armed with Type 08 universal wheeled platform. A similar trend of adopting the medium mechanized forces was observed in European countries, including the Italian, Polish, and French armed forces.\nCombined arms operations.\nIt is generally accepted that single weapons system types are much less effective without the support of the full combined arms team; the pre-World War II notion of \"tank fleets\" has proven to be as unsound as the World War I idea of unsupported infantry attacks. Though many nations' armored formations included an organic mechanized infantry component at the start of World War II, the proportion of mechanized infantry in such combined arms formations was increased by most armies as the war progressed.\nThe lesson was re-learned, first by the Pakistani Army in the 1965 war with India, where the nation fielded two different types of armored divisions: one which was almost exclusively armor (the 1st), while another was more balanced (the 6th). The latter division showed itself to be far more combat-capable than the former.\nHaving achieved spectacular successes in the offensive with tank-heavy formations during the Six-Day War, the Israel Defense Forces found in the Yom Kippur War of 1973 that a doctrine that relied primarily on tanks and aircraft had proven inadequate. As a makeshift remedy, paratroopers were provided with motorized transport and used as mechanized infantry in coordination with the armor.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It is possible that \"Malachi\" is not a proper name, because it means \"messenger\"; it has been assumed to be a pseudonym. According to Jewish tradition, the real identity of Malachi is Ezra the scribe.\nSome scholars argue that the Book of Malachi is the result of multiple stages of redaction; most of its text originated in the Persian period, with the oldest stratum from around 500 BCE and redactions into the Hellenistic period.\nIdentity.\nThe editors of the 1906 \"Jewish Encyclopedia\" implied that Malachi, also known as Malachias, prophesied after Haggai and Zechariah and speculated that he delivered his prophecies about 420 BC, after the second return of Nehemiah from Persia, or possibly before his return. The Talmud and the Aramaic Targum of Yonathan ben Uzziel identify Ezra as the same person as Malachi. This is the traditional view held by most Jews and some Christians, including Jerome. This identification is plausible, because \"Malachi\" reprimands the people for the same things Ezra did, such as marrying foreign pagan women. Malachi also focuses extensively on corrupt priests who Ezra, a priest himself who exhorted the people to follow the law, despised. According to Josephus, Ezra died and was buried \"in a magnificent manner in Jerusalem\". If the tradition that Ezra wrote under the name \"Malachi\" is correct, then Josephus meant that he was buried in the Tomb of the Prophets, the traditional resting place of Malachi. This would also explain why Ezra does not refer to a prophet named Malachi, while he did refer to other prophets such as Haggai and Zechariah. \nOther potential identities includes Zerubbabel and Nehemiah; others suggest that Malachi was a separate person altogether, possibly a Levite and a member of the Great Assembly.\nName.\nBecause the name \"Malachi\" does not occur elsewhere in the Hebrew Bible, some scholars doubt whether it is intended to be the personal name of the prophet. The form \"mal'akhi\" (literally \"my \"malakh\"\") signifies \"my messenger\"; it occurs in Malachi 3:1 (compare to Malachi 2:7, but this form would hardly be appropriate as a proper name without some additional syllable such as Yah, whence \"mal'akhiah\", i.e. \"messenger of Yah\". In the Book of Haggai, Haggai is designated the \"messenger of the LORD.\" The non-canonical superscriptions prefixed to the book, in both the Septuagint and the Vulgate, warrant the supposition that Malachi's full name ended with the syllable -yah. The Septuagint translates the last clause of Malachi 1:1, \"by the hand of his messenger\", and the Targum reads, \"by the hand of my angel, whose name is called Ezra the scribe\". G.G. Cameron suggests that the termination of the word \"Malachi\" is adjectival, and equivalent to the Latin \"angelicus\", signifying \"one charged with a message or mission\" (a missionary).\nDate.\nOpinions vary as to the prophet's exact date, but nearly all scholars agree that Malachi prophesied during the Persian period, and after the reconstruction and dedication of the Second Temple in 516 BC. More specifically, Malachi probably lived and labored during the times of Ezra and Nehemiah. The abuses which Malachi mentions in his writings correspond so exactly with those which Nehemiah found on his second visit to Jerusalem in 432 BC that it seems reasonably certain that he prophesied concurrently with Nehemiah or shortly after. Bergstein suggests that he died in 312 BC.\nMessage.\nAccording to W. Gunther Plaut:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Malachi describes a priesthood that is forgetful of its duties, a Temple that is underfunded because the people have lost interest in it, and a society in which Jewish men divorce their Jewish wives to marry out of the faith.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He graduated at University College London in 1986. In 1994, he moved to the United States, where he lives near Boston, Massachusetts in the suburb of Melrose.\nFowler started working with software in the early 1980s. Out of university in 1986 he started working in software development for Coopers &amp; Lybrand until 1991. In 2000 he joined ThoughtWorks, a systems integration and consulting company, where he was Chief Scientist.\nFowler has written nine books on the topic of software development. He is a member of the \"Agile Alliance\" and helped create the Manifesto for Agile Software Development in 2001, along with 16 fellow signatories. He maintains a \"bliki\", a mix of blog and wiki. He popularised the term Dependency Injection as a form of Inversion of Control.\nDomain-specific languages.\nIn his book, \"Domain-specific languages\", Fowler discusses Domain-specific languages, DSL. DSLs are said to be defined by being composable programming languages, with their focus on an individual domain and having limited expressiveness. It is argued that DSLs can increase productivity by removing the requirement of the programmer to understand a full programming language, providing a means of communication with domain experts, and separate the manner of execution of a task from the definition of a task itself. These benefits are set against the cost of learning a new language and building the tools for this language, siloing that results for different languages and the abstractions used in DSLs not being suitable for a task.\nFowler introduces the concept of internal (or embedded) and external DSL, an internal DSL being a DSL that is a subset of another language and can be executed by the tools for this outer language. Ruby and Lisp are given as an example of languages where internal DSLs are common. He also introduces the idea of Semantic Model which defines the execution of a DSL. Various examples of DSLs are presented including graphviz, a language for specifying graphs to be rendered; JMock, a java mocking framework; CSS, a language to specify stylistic elements of a website; HQL, an object relational mapper in Java; XAML, a language used to specify and change graphical user interfaces; FIT, a language to express testing scenarios; and make, a tool to build software\nThe book discusses implementing an external DSL using tools like parsers, lexers, abstract syntax trees and code generation referred to as \"syntax-driven translation\" This is contrasted with \"delimiter-driven translation\" which is said to be simpler but less powerful. Here the language is simple enough to be interpreted by splitting on delimiters and switching logic based on individual entries.\nWays of implementing internal DSLs is discussed, with attention paid to nested function calls, sequences of function calls, or method chaining amongst other methods.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "20287", "revid": "7903804", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20287", "title": "Microsoft Word", "text": "Word processor\n Microsoft Word is a word processing program developed by Microsoft. It was first released on October 25, 1983, under the original name Multi-Tool Word for Xenix systems. Subsequent versions were later written for several other platforms including IBM PCs running DOS (1983), Apple Macintosh running the Classic Mac OS (1985), AT&amp;T UNIX PC (1985), Atari ST (1988), OS/2 (1989), Microsoft Windows (1989), SCO Unix (1990), Handheld PC (1996), Pocket PC (2000), macOS (2001), Web browsers (2010), iOS (2014), and Android (2015).\nMicrosoft Word has been the \"de facto\" standard word processing software since the 1990s when it eclipsed WordPerfect. Commercial versions of Word are licensed as a standalone product or as a component of Microsoft Office, which can be purchased with a perpetual license, as part of the Microsoft 365 suite as a subscription, or as a one-time purchase with Office 2024.\nHistory.\nIn 1981, Microsoft hired Charles Simonyi, the primary developer of Bravo, the first GUI word processor, which was developed at Xerox PARC. Simonyi started work on a word processor called \"Multi-Tool Word\" and soon hired Richard Brodie, a former Xerox intern, who became the primary software engineer.\nMicrosoft announced Multi-Tool Word for Xenix and MS-DOS in 1983. Its name was soon simplified to \"Microsoft Word\". Free demonstration copies of the application were bundled with the November 1983 issue of \"PC World\", making it the first to be distributed on-disk with a magazine. That year Microsoft demonstrated Word running on Windows.\nUnlike most MS-DOS programs at the time, Microsoft Word was designed to be used with a mouse. Advertisements depicted the Microsoft Mouse and described Word as a WYSIWYG (What You See Is What You Get), windowed word processor with the ability to undo and display bold, italic, and underlined text, although it could not render fonts. It was not initially popular, since its user interface was different from the leading word processor at the time, WordStar. However, Microsoft steadily improved the product, releasing versions 2.0 through 5.0 over the next six years. In 1985, Microsoft ported Word to the classic Mac OS (known as Macintosh System Software at the time). This was made easier by Word for DOS having been designed for use with high-resolution displays and laser printers, even though none were yet available to the general public. It was also notable for its very fast cut-and-paste function and unlimited number of undo operations, which are due to its usage of the piece table data structure.\nFollowing the precedents of LisaWrite and MacWrite, Word for Mac OS added true WYSIWYG features. It fulfilled a need for a word processor that was more capable than MacWrite. After its release, Word for Mac OS's sales were higher than its MS-DOS counterpart for at least four years.\nThe second release of Word for Mac OS, shipped in 1987, was named Word 3.0 to synchronize its version number with Word for DOS; this was Microsoft's first attempt to synchronize version numbers across platforms. Word 3.0 included numerous internal enhancements and new features, including the first implementation of the Rich Text Format (RTF) specification, but was plagued with bugs. Within a few months, Word 3.0 was superseded by a more stable Word 3.01, which was mailed free to all registered users of 3.0. After MacWrite Pro was discontinued in the mid-1990s, Word for Mac OS never had any serious rivals. Word 5.1 for Mac OS, released in 1992, was a very popular word processor owing to its elegance, relative ease of use, and feature set. Many users say it is the best version of Word for Mac OS ever created.\nIn 1986, an agreement between Atari and Microsoft brought Word to the Atari ST under the name \"Microsoft Write\". The Atari ST version was a port of Word 1.05 for the Mac OS and was never updated.\nThe first version of Word for Windows was released in 1989. With the release of Windows 3.0 the following year, sales began to pick up and Microsoft soon became the market leader for word processors for IBM PC-compatible computers. In 1991, Microsoft capitalized on Word for Windows' increasing popularity by releasing a version of Word for DOS, version 5.5, that replaced its unique user interface with an interface similar to a Windows application. When Microsoft became aware of the Year 2000 problem, it made Microsoft Word 5.5 for DOS available for free downloads. As of February\u00a02021[ [update]], it is still available for download from Microsoft's website.\nIn 1991, Microsoft embarked on a project code-named Pyramid to completely rewrite Microsoft Word from the ground up. Both the Windows and Mac OS versions would start from the same code base. It was abandoned when it was determined that it would take the development team too long to rewrite and then catch up with all the new capabilities that could have been added at the same time without a rewrite. Instead, the next versions of Word for Windows and Mac OS, dubbed version 6.0, both started from the code base of Word for Windows 2.0.\nWith the release of Word 6.0 in 1993, Microsoft again attempted to synchronize the version numbers and coordinate product naming across platforms, this time across DOS, Mac OS, and Windows (this was the last version of Word for DOS). It introduced AutoCorrect, which automatically fixed certain typing errors, and AutoFormat, which could reformat many parts of a document at once. While the Windows version received favorable reviews (e.g., from \"InfoWorld\"), the Mac OS version was widely derided. Many accused it of being slow, clumsy, and memory intensive, and its user interface differed significantly from Word 5.1. In response to user requests, Microsoft offered Word 5 again, after it had been discontinued. Subsequent versions of Word for macOS are no longer direct ports of Word for Windows, instead featuring a mixture of ported code and native code.\nFile formats.\nFilename extensions.\nMicrosoft Word's native file formats are denoted either by a codice_1 or codice_2 filename extension.\nAlthough the codice_1 extension has been used in many different versions of Word, it actually encompasses four distinct file formats:\nThe newer codice_2 extension signifies the Office Open XML international standard for Office documents and is used by default by Word 2007 and later for Windows as well as Word 2008 and later for macOS.\nBinary formats (Word 97\u20132007).\nDuring the late 1990s and early 2000s, the default Word document format (.DOC) became a \"de facto\" standard of document file formats for Microsoft Office users. There are different versions of \"Word Document Format\" used by default in Word 97\u20132007. Each binary word file is a Compound File, a hierarchical file system within a file. According to Joel Spolsky, Word Binary File Format is extremely complex mainly because its developers had to accommodate an overwhelming number of features and prioritize performance over anything else.\nAs with all OLE Compound Files, Word Binary Format consists of \"storages\", which are analogous to computer folders, and \"streams\", which are similar to computer files. Each storage may contain streams or other storage. Each Word Binary File must contain a stream called the \"WordDocument\" stream and this stream must start with a File Information Block (FIB). FIB serves as the first point of reference for locating everything else, such as where the text in a Word document starts, ends, what version of Word created the document and other attributes.\nWord 2007 and later continue to support the DOC file format, although it is no longer the default.\nXML Document (Word 2003).\nThe .docx XML format introduced in Word 2003 was a simple, XML-based format called WordProcessingML or WordML.\nThe Microsoft Office XML formats are XML-based document formats (or XML schemas) introduced in versions of Microsoft Office prior to Office 2007. Microsoft Office XP introduced a new XML format for storing Excel spreadsheets and Office 2003 added an XML-based format for Word documents.\nThese formats were succeeded by Office Open XML (ECMA-376) in Microsoft Office 2007.\nCross-version compatibility.\nOpening a Word Document file in a version of Word other than the one with which it was created can cause an incorrect display of the document. The document formats of the various versions change in subtle and not-so-subtle ways (such as changing the font or the handling of more complex tasks like footnotes). Formatting created in newer versions does not always survive when viewed in older versions of the program, nearly always because that capability does not exist in the previous version. Rich Text Format (RTF), an early effort to create a format for interchanging formatted text between applications, is an optional format for Word that retains most formatting and all content of the original document.\nThird-party formats.\nPlugins permitting the Windows versions of Word to read and write formats it does not natively support, such as international standard OpenDocument format (ODF) (ISO/IEC 26300:2006), are available. Up until the release of Service Pack 2 (SP2) for Office 2007, Word did not natively support reading or writing ODF documents without a plugin, namely the SUN ODF Plugin or the OpenXML/ODF Translator. With SP2 installed, ODF format 1.1 documents can be read and saved like any other supported format in addition to those already available in Word 2007. The implementation faces substantial criticism, and the ODF Alliance and others have claimed that the third-party plugins provide better support. Microsoft later declared that the ODF support has some limitations.\nIn October 2005, one year before the Microsoft Office 2007 suite was released, Microsoft declared that there was insufficient demand from Microsoft customers for the international standard OpenDocument format support and that therefore it would not be included in Microsoft Office 2007. This statement was repeated in the following months. As an answer, on October 20, 2005, an online petition was created to demand ODF support from Microsoft.\nIn May 2006, the ODF plugin for Microsoft Office was released by the OpenDocument Foundation. Microsoft declared that it had no relationship with the developers of the plugin.\nIn July 2006, Microsoft announced the creation of the Open XML Translator project \u2013 tools to build a technical bridge between the Microsoft Office Open XML Formats and the OpenDocument Format (ODF). This work was started in response to government requests for interoperability with ODF. The goal of the project was not to add ODF support to Microsoft Office, but only to create a plugin and an external toolset. In February 2007, this project released a first version of the ODF plugin for Microsoft Word.\nIn February 2007, Sun released an initial version of its ODF plugin for Microsoft Office. Version 1.0 was released in July 2007.\nMicrosoft Word 2007 (Service Pack 1) supports (for output only) PDF and XPS formats, but only after manual installation of the Microsoft \"Save as PDF or XPS\" add-on. On later releases, this was offered by default.\nFeatures.\nAmong its features, Word includes a built-in spell checker, a thesaurus, a dictionary, and utilities for manipulating and editing text. It supports creating tables. Depending on the version, it can perform simple and complex calculations, and supports formatting formulas and equations.\nThe following are some aspects of its feature set.\nTemplates.\nSeveral later versions of Word include the ability for users to create their own formatting templates, allowing them to define a file in which: the title, heading, paragraph, and other element designs differ from the standard Word templates. Users can find how to do this under the Help section located near the top right corner (Word 2013 on Windows 8).\nFor example, Normal.dotm is the master template from which all Word documents are created. It determines the margin defaults as well as the layout of the text and font defaults. Although Normal.dotm is already set with certain defaults, the user can change it to new defaults. This will change other documents which were created using the template. It was previously Normal.dot.\nImage formats.\nWord can import and display images in common bitmap formats such as JPG and GIF. It can also be used to create and display simple line art. Microsoft Word added support for the common SVG vector image format in 2017 for Office 365 ProPlus subscribers and this functionality was also included in the Office 2019 release.\nWordArt.\nWordArt enables drawing text in a Microsoft Word document such as a title, watermark, or other text, with graphical effects such as skewing, shadowing, rotating, stretching in a variety of shapes and colors, and even including three-dimensional effects. Users can apply formatting effects such as shadow, bevel, glow, and reflection to their document text as easily as applying bold or underline. Users can also spell-check text that uses visual effects and add text effects to paragraph styles.\nMacros.\nA macro is a rule of pattern that specifies how a certain input sequence (often a sequence of characters) should be mapped to an output sequence according to a defined process. Frequently used or repetitive sequences of keystrokes and mouse movements can be automated. Like other Microsoft Office documents, Word files can include advanced macros and even embedded programs. The language was originally WordBasic, but changed to Visual Basic for Applications as of Word 97.\nThis extensive functionality can also be used to run and propagate viruses in documents. The tendency for people to exchange Word documents via email, USB flash drives, and floppy disks made this an especially attractive vector in 1999. A prominent example was the Melissa virus, but countless others have existed.\nThese macro viruses were the only known cross-platform threats between Windows and Macintosh computers and they were the only infection vectors to affect any macOS system up until the advent of video codec trojans in 2007. Microsoft released patches for Word X and Word 2004 that effectively eliminated the macro problem on the Mac by 2006.\nWord's macro security setting, which regulates when macros may execute, can be adjusted by the user, but in the most recent versions of Word, it is set to HIGH by default, generally reducing the risk from macro-based viruses, which have become uncommon.\nLayout issues.\nBefore Word 2010 (Word 14) for Windows, the program was unable to correctly handle ligatures defined in OpenType fonts. Those ligature glyphs with Unicode codepoints may be inserted manually, but are not recognized by Word for what they are, breaking spell checking, while custom ligatures present in the font are not accessible at all. Since Word 2010, the program now has advanced typesetting features which can be enabled, OpenType ligatures, kerning and hyphenation (previous versions already had the latter two features). Other layout deficiencies of Word include the inability to set crop marks or thin spaces. Various third-party workaround utilities have been developed.\nIn Word 2004 for Mac OS X, support of complex scripts was inferior even to Word 97 and Word 2004 did not support Apple Advanced Typography features like ligatures or glyph variants.\nIssues with technical documents.\nMicrosoft Word is only partially suitable for some kinds of technical writing, specifically, that which requires mathematical equations, figure placement, table placement and cross-references to any of these items. The usual workaround for equations is to use a third-party equation typesetter. Figures and tables must be placed manually; there is an anchor mechanism but it is not designed for fully automatic figure placement, and editing text after placing figures and tables often requires re-placing those items by moving the anchor point, and even then the placement options are limited. This problem is deeply baked into Word's structure since 1985, as it does not know where page breaks will occur until the document is printed.\nBullets and numbering.\nMicrosoft Word supports bullet lists and numbered lists. It also features a numbering system that helps add correct numbers to pages, chapters, headers, footnotes, and entries of tables of content; these numbers automatically change to correct ones as new items are added or existing items are deleted. Bullets and numbering can be applied directly to paragraphs and converted to lists. Word 97 through 2003, however, had problems adding correct numbers to numbered lists. In particular, a second irrelevant numbered list might have not started with number one but instead resumed numbering after the last numbered list. Although Word 97 supported a hidden marker that said the list numbering must restart afterward, the command to insert this marker (Restart Numbering command) was only added in Word 2003. However, if one were to cut the first item of the listed and paste it as another item (e.g. fifth), then the restart marker would have moved with it and the list would have restarted in the middle instead of at the top.\nWord continues to default to non-Unicode characters and non-hierarchical bulleting, despite user preference for PowerPoint-style symbol hierarchies (e.g., filled circle/emdash/filled square/endash/emptied circle) and universal compatibility.\nAutoSummarize.\nAvailable in certain versions of Word (e.g., Word 2007), AutoSummarize highlights passages or phrases that it considers valuable and can be a quick way of generating a crude abstract or an executive summary. The amount of text to be retained can be specified by the user as a percentage of the current amount of text.\nAccording to Ron Fein of the Word 97 team, AutoSummarize cuts wordy copy to the bone by counting words and ranking sentences. First, AutoSummarize identifies the most common words in the document (barring \"a\" and \"the\" and the like) and assigns a \"score\" to each word \u2013 the more frequently a word is used, the higher the score. Then, it \"averages\" each sentence by adding the scores of its words and dividing the sum by the number of words in the sentence \u2013 the higher the average, the higher the rank of the sentence. \"It's like the ratio of wheat to chaff,\" explains Fein.\nAutoSummarize was removed from Microsoft Word for Mac OS X 2011, although it was present in Word for Mac 2008. AutoSummarize was removed from the Office 2010 release version (14) as well.\nSpike.\nSpike is a specialized cut command in Microsoft Word. It is named after an implement in restaurants on which receipts are impaled, and similarly sequentially stores data to be pasted and adds them together to the document when the second function step, or paste, is performed. Spiking (CONTROL\u2013F3) performs a cut function, which can be immediately undone to simulate a \"copy\" command, while the pasting function (SHIFT\u2013CONTROL\u2013F3) will also clear the data from the spike, although this can be avoided by using alternatives to the three-key shortcut. \nHidden text.\nWord supports marking selected text as \"hidden\". Hidden text is text that is stored in the document but is not displayed. For example, pages containing large amounts of markup language text can be made visually more readable during the editing process.\nPassword protection.\nThree password types can be set in Microsoft Word:\nThe second and third password types were developed by Microsoft for convenient shared use of documents rather than for their protection. There is no encryption of documents that are protected by such passwords and the Microsoft Office protection system saves a hash sum of a password in a document's header where it can be easily accessed and removed by the specialized software. \"Password to open a document\" offers much tougher protection that had been steadily enhanced in the subsequent editions of Microsoft Office.\n\"Word 95\" and all the preceding editions had the weakest protection that utilized a conversion of a password to a 16-bit key.\nKey length in \"Word 97\" and \"2000\" was strengthened up to 40 bit. However, modern cracking software allows removing such a password very quickly \u2013 a persistent cracking process takes one week at most. Use of rainbow tables reduces password removal time to several seconds. Some password recovery software can not only remove a password but also find an actual password that was used by a user to encrypt the document using the brute-force attack approach. Statistically, the possibility of recovering the password depends on the password strength.\nWord's 2003/XP version default protection remained the same but an option that allowed advanced users to choose a Cryptographic Service Provider was added. If a strong CSP is chosen, guaranteed document decryption becomes unavailable and, therefore, a password can't be removed from the document. Nonetheless, a password can be fairly quickly picked with a brute-force attack, because its speed is still high regardless of the CSP selected. Moreover, since the CSPs are not active by default, their use is limited to advanced users only.\nWord 2007 offers significantly more secure document protection which utilizes the modern Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) that converts a password to a 128-bit key using a SHA-1 hash function 50,000 times. It makes password removal impossible (as of today, no computer that can pick the key in a reasonable amount of time exists) and drastically slows the brute-force attack speed down to several hundreds of passwords per second.\nWord's 2010 protection algorithm was not changed apart from the increasing number of SHA-1 conversions up to 100,000 times and consequently, the brute-force attack speed decreased two times more.\nVersions and platforms.\nWord for Windows.\nWord for Windows is available stand-alone or as part of the Microsoft Office suite. Word contains rudimentary desktop publishing capabilities and is the most widely used word processing program on the market. Word files are commonly used as the format for sending text documents via e-mail because almost every user with a computer can read a Word document by using the Word application, a Word viewer or a word processor that imports the Word format (see Microsoft Word Viewer).\nWord 6 for Windows NT was the first 32-bit version of the product, released with Microsoft Office for Windows NT around the same time as Windows 95. It was a straightforward port of Word 6.0. Starting with Word 95, each release of Word was named after the year of its release, instead of its version number.\nWord 2007 introduced a redesigned user interface that emphasized the most common controls, dividing them into tabs, and adding specific options depending on the context, such as selecting an image or editing a table. This user interface, called Ribbon, was included in Excel, PowerPoint and Access 2007, and would be later introduced to other Office applications with Office 2010 and Windows applications such as Paint and WordPad with Windows 7, respectively.\nThe redesigned interface also includes a toolbar that appears when selecting text, with options for formatting included.\nWord 2007 also included the option to save documents as Adobe Acrobat or XPS files, and upload Word documents like blog posts on services such as WordPress.\nWord 2010 allows the customization of the Ribbon, adds a Backstage view for file management, has improved document navigation, allows creation and embedding of screenshots, and integrates with online services such as Microsoft OneDrive.\nWord 2019 added a dictation function.\nWord 2021 added co-authoring, a visual refresh on the start experience and tabs, automatic cloud saving, dark mode, line focus, an updated draw tab, and support for ODF 1.3.\nMicrosoft Word 2024 (Fourth perpetual release of Office 16) for the Microsoft Windows and MacOS was released on October 1, 2024.\nWord for Mac.\nThe Mac was introduced on January 24, 1984, and Microsoft introduced Word 1.0 for Mac a year later, on January 18, 1985. The DOS, Mac, and Windows versions are quite different from each other. Only the Mac version was WYSIWYG and used a graphical user interface, far ahead of the other platforms. Each platform restarted its version numbering at \"1.0\". There was no version 2 on the Mac, but version 3 came out on January 31, 1987, as described above. Word 4.0 came out on November 6, 1990, and added automatic linking with Excel, the ability to flow text around graphics, and a WYSIWYG page view editing mode. Word 5.1 for Mac, released in 1992 ran on the original 68000 CPU and was the last to be specifically designed as a Macintosh application. The later Word 6 was a Windows port and poorly received. Word 5.1 continued to run well until the last classic Mac OS. Many people continue to run Word 5.1 to this day under an emulated Mac classic system for some of its excellent features, such as document generation and renumbering, or to access their old files.\nIn 1997, Microsoft formed the Macintosh Business Unit as an independent group within Microsoft focused on writing software for the classic Mac OS. Its first version of Word, Word 98, was released with Office 98 Macintosh Edition. Document compatibility reached parity with Word 97, and it included features from Word 97 for Windows, including spell and grammar checking with squiggles. Users could choose the menus and keyboard shortcuts to be similar to either Word 97 for Windows or Word 5 for Mac.\nWord 2001, released in 2000, added a few new features, including the Office Clipboard, which allowed users to copy and paste multiple items. It was the last version to run on the classic Mac OS and, on Mac OS X, it could only run within the Classic Environment. Word X, released in 2001, was the first version to run natively on, and to require, Mac OS X, and introduced non-contiguous text selection.\nWord 2004 was released in May 2004. It included a new Notebook Layout view for taking notes either by typing or by voice. Other features, such as tracking changes, were made more similar with Office for Windows.\nWord 2008, released on January 15, 2008, included a Ribbon-like feature, called the Elements Gallery, that can be used to select page layouts and insert custom diagrams and images. It also included a new view focused on publishing layout, integrated bibliography management, and native support for the new Office Open XML format. It was the first version to run natively on Intel-based Macs.\nWord 2011, released in October 2010, replaced the Elements Gallery in favor of a Ribbon user interface that is much more similar to Office for Windows, and includes a full-screen mode that allows users to focus on reading and writing documents, and support for Office Web Apps.\nMicrosoft Office 2016 for Mac (2015)\nMicrosoft Office 2019 for Mac (2018)\nWord 2021 added real-time co-authoring, automatic cloud saving, dark mode, immersive reader enhancements, line focus, a visual refresh, the ability to save pictures in SVG format, and a new Sketched style outline.\nWord 2024, released on September 16, 2024, included Word session recovery, support for ODF 1.4, new theme and color palette and ability for easier collaboration. Even though collaboration features were also available in Microsoft Word 2021 as part of post release update, they were not available in Word LTSC 2021 or Word LTSC 2024.\nWrite for Atari ST.\nMicrosoft Write for the Atari ST is the Atari version of Microsoft Word 1.05 released for the Apple Macintosh while sharing the same name as the Microsoft Write program included in Windows during the 80s and early 90s. While the program was announced in 1986, various delays caused the program to arrive in 1988. Microsoft Write for Atari ST and Microsoft Word for Windows would both make their debut at the 1988 COMDEX in Atlanta, Georgia alongside their respective booths.\nLike the Mac version, the Atari version features WYSIWYG form (via GDOS) and used a graphical user interface (via GEM).\nMicrosoft Write was one of the first Atari word processors that utilizes the GDOS (Graphics Device Operating System) part of GEM (Graphics Environment Manager) allowing the word processor to display and print graphic fonts &amp; styles making it a multifont word processor for the Atari ST (a 2nd disk drive was required to run both Microsoft Write and GDOS). Microsoft Write was packaged with GDOS 1.1 and the drivers for the Atari XMM804 dot matrix printer along with 3rd party printers like Epson FX-80 and Star Micronics NB-15 on 4 diskettes (3\u00bd inch format).\nAccompanying the retail packaging was a 206-page slip-cased user's manual that was divided into 3 sections: Learning Write, Using Write and Write Reference. In addition, Microsoft Write also featured a \"Help Screen\" tool to help a user explore the advanced features of the word processor that earned high praise for its form and presentation.\nWrite for Macintosh.\nIn October 1987, Microsoft released Microsoft Write for Macintosh. Write is a version of Microsoft Word with limited features that Microsoft hoped would replace aging MacWrite in the Macintosh word processor market. Write was priced well below Word, though at the time MacWrite was included with new Macintoshes. Write is best described as Word locked in \"Short Menus\" mode, and as such it used the same file format so that users could exchange files with absolutely no conversion necessary. Write did not sell well and was discontinued before the System 7 era. Microsoft Write was part of a short-lived trend for \"lightweight\" Macintosh word processors initiated by the introduction of the Macintosh Portable and early PowerBook systems. Others included LetterPerfect and Nisus Compact.\nWord on mobile platforms.\nThe first mobile versions of Word were released with Windows CE in 1996 on Handheld PCs and later also on Pocket PCs.\nThe modern Word Mobile supports basic formatting, such as bolding, changing font size, and changing colors (from red, yellow, or green). It can add comments, but can't edit documents with tracked changes. It can't open password-protected documents; change the typeface, text alignment, or style (normal, heading 1); insert responsive checkboxes; insert pictures; or undo.\nWord Mobile is neither able to display nor insert footnotes, endnotes, page footers, page breaks, certain indentation of lists, and certain fonts while working on a document, but retains them if the original document has them. Word Mobile can insert lists, but doesn't allow to set custom bullet symbols and customize list numbering. In addition to the features of the 2013 version, the 2007 version on Windows Mobile also has the ability to save documents in the Rich Text Format and open legacy PSW (Pocket Word). Furthermore, it includes a spell checker, word count tool, and a \"Find and Replace\" command. In 2015, Word Mobile became available for Windows 10 and Windows 10 Mobile on Windows Store. Support for the Windows 10 Mobile version ended on January 12, 2021.\nWord for iOS was released on March 27, 2014 and for Android was released on January 29, 2015.\nWord for the web.\nWord for the web is a free lightweight version of Microsoft Word available as part of Office on the web, which also includes web versions of Microsoft Excel and Microsoft PowerPoint.\nWord for the web lacks some Ribbon tabs, such as Design and Mailings. Mailings allows users to print envelopes and labels and manage mail merge printing of Word documents. Word for the web is not able to edit certain objects, such as: equations, shapes, text boxes or drawings, but a placeholder may be present in the document. Certain advanced features like table sorting or columns will not be displayed but are preserved as they were in the document. Other views available in the Word desktop app (Outline, Draft, Web Layout, and Full-Screen Reading) are not available, nor are side-by-side viewing, split windows, and the ruler.\nReception.\nInitial releases of Word were met with criticism. Byte in 1984 criticized the documentation for Word 1.1 and 2.0 for DOS, calling it \"a complete farce\". It called the software \"clever, put together well and performs some extraordinary feats\", but concluded that \"especially when operated with the mouse, has many more limitations than benefits... extremely frustrating to learn and operate efficiently\". \"PC Magazine\"'s review was very mixed, stating: \"I've run into weird word processors before, but this is the first time one's nearly knocked me down for the count\" but acknowledging that Word's innovations were the first that caused the reviewer to consider abandoning WordStar. While the review cited an excellent WYSIWYG display, sophisticated print formatting, windows, and footnoting as merits, it criticized many small flaws, very slow performance, and \"documentation produced by Madame Sadie's Pain Palace\". It concluded that Word was \"two releases away from potential greatness\".\n\"Compute!'s Apple Applications\" in 1987 stated that \"despite a certain awkwardness\", Word 3.01 \"will likely become the major Macintosh word processor\" with \"far too many features to list here\". While criticizing the lack of true WYSIWYG, the magazine concluded that \"\"Word\" is marvelous. It's like a Mozart or Edison, whose occasional gaucherie we excuse because of his great gifts\".\n\"Compute!\" in 1989 stated that Word 5.0's integration of text and graphics made it \"a solid engine for basic desktop publishing\". The magazine approved of improvements to text mode, described the $75 price for upgrading from an earlier version as \"the deal of the decade\" and concluded that \"as a high-octane word processor, \"Word\" is worth a look\".\nComputer Intelligence estimated in 1987 that Microsoft had only 4% of the Fortune 1000 PC word processor market, but during the first quarter of 1996, Word accounted for 80% of the worldwide word processor market.\nIn 2013, Microsoft added Word to the new Office 365 product, where Microsoft has combined their most popular software, which is a cloud based computing software that is subscription-based to compete with Google Docs.\nRelease history.\nLegend:UnsupportedSupportedLatest versionPreview versionFuture version&lt;templatestyles src=\"Version/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "20288", "revid": "48232572", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20288", "title": "Microsoft Office", "text": "Suite of office software\n \n \nMicrosoft Office, MS Office, or simply Office, is an office suite and (formerly) a family of client software, server software, and services developed by Microsoft. The first version of the Office suite, announced by Bill Gates on August 1, 1988, at COMDEX, contained Microsoft Word, Microsoft Excel, and Microsoft PowerPoint, all three of which remain core products in Office. Over time, the Office suite has grown substantially, adding programs such as OneNote and Outlook; the suite has also been made highly extensible with the use of the VBA scripting language.\nThe suite currently includes a word processor (Word), a spreadsheet program (Excel), a presentation program (PowerPoint), a note-taking program (OneNote), and an email client (Outlook); the Windows version also includes a database management system (Access). Microsoft Office previously offered desktop, mobile, and web applications; out of these, only the desktop suite is still maintained.\nSince Office 2013, Microsoft has promoted Microsoft 365 (formerly Office 365) as the primary means of obtaining Microsoft Office: it allows the use of the software and other services on a subscription business model, and users receive feature updates to the software for the lifetime of the subscription, including new features and cloud computing integration that are not necessarily included in the \"on-premises\" releases of Office sold under conventional license terms. In 2017, revenue from Office 365 overtook conventional license sales. \nMicrosoft continues to sell the perpetually-licensed Office suite, the latest version of which is Office 2024.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:TOC limit/styles.css\" /&gt;\nOffice for the web.\nOffice for the web was a free web version of Microsoft Office that included three web applications: Word, Excel and PowerPoint. The offering also included Outlook.com, OneNote and OneDrive; these are accessible through a unified app switcher. Users can install the on-premises version of this service, called Office Online Server, in private clouds in conjunction with SharePoint, Microsoft Exchange Server and Microsoft Lync Server.\nWord, Excel, and PowerPoint for the web could natively open, edit, and save Office Open XML files (docx, xlsx, pptx) as well as OpenDocument files (odt, ods, odp). They could also open files with legacy Office formats (doc, xls, ppt), but these were converted to the newer formats once edited. Password-encrypted Office files could not be opened. Files with macros could be opened in the browser apps, but the macros could not be accessed or executed. In July 2013, Word gained the ability to render PDF documents or convert them to Microsoft Word documents, although the formatting of the document may have deviated from the original. In November 2013, the apps started supporting real-time co-authoring and autosaving files.\nOffice for the web lacked a number of the advanced features present in the full desktop versions of Office, including the programs Access and Publisher. However, users were able to select the command \"Open in desktop app\"; this brought up the document in the desktop version of Office on their computer or device to utilize the advanced features there.\nThe Personal edition of Office for the web was available to the general public free of charge with a Microsoft account through the Office.com website, which superseded SkyDrive (now OneDrive) and Office Live Workspace. Enterprise-managed versions were available through Office 365. In February 2013, the ability to view and edit files on SkyDrive without signing in was added. The service could also be installed privately in enterprise environments as a SharePoint app, or through Office Web Apps Server. Microsoft also offered other web apps in the Office suite, such as the Outlook Web App (formerly Outlook Web Access), Lync Web App (formerly Office Communicator Web Access), Project Web App (formerly Project Web Access). Additionally, Microsoft offers a service under the name of Online Doc Viewer to view Office documents on a website via Office on the web.\nIn 2017, Office for the web was replaced by Microsoft 365; the service, including the former Word, Excel, and PowerPoint web applications, is no longer accessible.\nCommon features.\nMost versions of Microsoft Office (including Office 97 and later) use their own widget set and do not exactly match the native operating system. This is most apparent in Microsoft Office XP and 2003, where the standard menus were replaced with a colored, flat-looking, shadowed menu style.\nThe user interface of a particular version of Microsoft Office often heavily influences a subsequent version of Microsoft Windows. E.g.:-\nUsers of Microsoft Office may access external data via connection-specifications saved in Office Data Connection (.odc) files.\nOffice, on all platforms, supports editing both server files (in real time) and offline files (manually saved) in recent years. The support for editing server files (in real time) was originally introduced (in its current form) after the introduction of OneDrive (formerly SkyDrive). But, older versions of Office also have the ability to edit server files (notably Office 2007).\nBoth Windows and Office used service packs to update software. Office had non-cumulative service releases, which were discontinued after Office 2000 Service Release 1. Now, Windows and Office have shifted to predictable (monthly, semi-annual and annual) release schemes to update software.\nPast versions of Office often contained Easter eggs. For example, Excel 97 contained a reasonably functional flight-simulator.\nFile formats and metadata.\nMicrosoft Office prior to Office 2007 used proprietary file formats based on the OLE Compound File Binary Format. This forced users who share data to adopt the same software platform. In 2008, Microsoft made the entire documentation for the binary Office formats freely available for download and granted any possible patents rights for use or implementations of those binary format for free under the Open Specification Promise. Previously, Microsoft had supplied such documentation freely but only on request.\nStarting with Office 2007, the default file format has been a version of Office Open XML, though different from the one standardized and published by Ecma International and by ISO/IEC. Microsoft has granted patent rights to the formats technology under the Open Specification Promise and has made available free downloadable converters for previous versions of Microsoft Office including Office 2003, Office XP, Office 2000 and Office 2004 for Mac OS X. Third-party implementations of Office Open XML exist on the Windows platform (LibreOffice, all platforms), macOS platform (iWork '08, NeoOffice, LibreOffice) and Linux (LibreOffice and OpenOffice.org 3.0). In addition, Office 2010, Service Pack 2 for Office 2007, and Office 2016 for Mac supports the OpenDocument Format (ODF) for opening and saving documents \u2013 only the old ODF 1.0 (2006 ISO/IEC standard) is supported, not the 1.2 version (2015 ISO/IEC standard).\nMicrosoft provides the ability to remove metadata from Office documents. This was in response to highly publicized incidents where sensitive data about a document was leaked via its metadata. Metadata removal was first available in 2004, when Microsoft released a tool called \"Remove Hidden Data Add-in for Office 2003/XP\" for this purpose. It was directly integrated into Office 2007 in a feature called the \"Document Inspector\".\nExtensibility.\nA major feature of the Office suite is the ability for users and third-party companies to write add-ins (plug-ins) that extend the capabilities of an application by adding custom commands and specialized features. One of the new features is the Office Store. Plugins and other tools can be downloaded by users. Developers can make money by selling their applications in the Office Store. The revenue is divided between the developer and Microsoft where the developer gets 80% of the money. Developers are able to share applications with all Office users.\nThe app travels with the document, and it is for the developer to decide what the recipient will see when they open it. The recipient will either have the option to download the app from the Office Store for free, start a free trial or be directed to payment.\nWith Office's cloud abilities, IT departments can create a set of apps for their business employees in order to increase their productivity. When employees go to the Office Store, they'll see their company's apps under \"My Organization\". The apps that employees have personally downloaded will appear under \"My Apps\". Developers can use web technologies like HTML5, XML, CSS3, JavaScript, and APIs for building the apps.\nAn application for Office is a webpage that is hosted inside an Office client application. Users can use apps to amplify the functionality of a document, email message, meeting request, or appointment. Apps can run in multiple environments and by multiple clients, including rich Office desktop clients, Office Web Apps, mobile browsers, and also on-premises and in the cloud. The type of add-ins supported differ by Office versions:\nPassword protection.\nMicrosoft Office has a security feature that allows users to encrypt Office (Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Access, Skype Business) documents with a user-provided password. The password can contain up to 255 characters and uses AES 128-bit advanced encryption by default. Passwords can also be used to restrict modification of the entire document, worksheet or presentation. Due to lack of document encryption, though, these passwords can be removed using a third-party cracking software.\nSupport policies.\nApproach.\nAll versions of Microsoft Office products from Office 2000 to Office 2016 are eligible for ten years of support following their release, during which Microsoft releases security updates for the product version and provides paid technical support. The ten-year period is divided into two five-year phases: The mainstream phase and the extended phase. During the mainstream phase, Microsoft may provide limited complimentary technical support and release non-security updates or change the design of the product. During the extended phase, said services stop. Office 2019 only receives 5 years of mainstream and 2 years of extended support and Office 2021 only gets 5 years of mainstream support.\nPlatforms.\nMicrosoft supports Office for the Windows and macOS platforms, as well as mobile versions for Windows Phone, Android and iOS platforms. Beginning with Mac Office 4.2, the macOS and Windows versions of Office share the same file format, and are interoperable. Visual Basic for Applications support was dropped in Microsoft Office 2008 for Mac, then reintroduced in Office for Mac 2011.\nMicrosoft tried in the mid-1990s to port Office to RISC processors such as NEC/MIPS and IBM/PowerPC, but they met problems such as memory access being hampered by data structure alignment requirements. Microsoft Word 97 and Excel 97, however, did ship for the DEC Alpha platform. Difficulties in porting Office may have been a factor in discontinuing Windows NT on non-Intel platforms.\nPricing model and editions.\nThe Microsoft Office applications and suites are sold via retail channels, and volume licensing for larger organizations (also including the \"Home Use Program\". allowing users at participating organizations to buy low-cost licenses for use on their personal devices as part of their employer's volume license agreement).\nIn 2010, Microsoft introduced a software as a service platform known as Office 365, to provide cloud-hosted versions of Office's server software, including Exchange e-mail and SharePoint, on a subscription basis (competing in particular with Google Apps). Following the release of Office 2013, Microsoft began to offer Office 365 plans for the consumer market, with access to Microsoft Office software on multiple devices with free feature updates over the life of the subscription, as well as other services such as OneDrive storage.\nMicrosoft has since promoted Office 365 as the primary means of purchasing Microsoft Office. Although there are still \"on-premises\" releases roughly every three years, Microsoft marketing emphasizes that they do not receive new features or access to new cloud-based services as they are released unlike Office 365, as well as other benefits for consumer and business markets. Office 365 revenue overtook traditional license sales for Office in 2017.\nEditions.\nMicrosoft Office is available in several editions, which regroup a given number of applications for a specific price. Primarily, Microsoft sells Office as Microsoft 365. The editions are as follows:\nMicrosoft sells Office for a one-time purchase as Home &amp; Student and Home &amp; Business, however, these editions do not receive major updates.\nEducation pricing.\nPost-secondary students may obtain the university edition of Microsoft Office 365 subscription. It is limited to one user and two devices, plus the subscription price is valid for four years instead of just one. Apart from this, the university edition is identical in features to the Home Premium version. This marks the first time Microsoft does not offer physical or permanent software at academic pricing, in contrast to the university versions of Office 2010 and Office 2011. In addition, students eligible for DreamSpark program may receive select standalone Microsoft Office apps free of charge.\nCriticism.\nData formats.\nMicrosoft Office has been criticized in the past for using proprietary file formats rather than open standards, which forces users who share data into adopting the same software platform. However, on February 15, 2008, Microsoft made the entire documentation for the binary Office formats freely available under the Open Specification Promise. Also, Office Open XML, the document format for the latest versions of Office for Windows and Mac, has been standardized under both Ecma International and ISO. Ecma International has published the Office Open XML specification free of copyrights and Microsoft has granted patent rights to the formats technology under the Open Specification Promise and has made available free downloadable converters for previous versions of Microsoft Office including Office 2003, Office XP, Office 2000 and Office 2004 for the Mac. Third-party implementations of Office Open XML exist on the Mac platform (iWork 08) and Linux (OpenOffice.org 2.3 \u2013 Novell Edition only).\nUnicode and bi-directional texts.\nAnother point of criticism Microsoft Office has faced was the lack of support in its Mac versions for Unicode and Bidirectional text languages, notably Arabic and Hebrew. This issue, which had existed since the first release in 1989, was addressed in the 2016 version.\nPrivacy.\nOn November 13, 2018, a report initiated by the Government of the Netherlands concluded that Microsoft Office 2016 and Office 365 do not comply with GDPR, the European law which regulates data protection and privacy for all citizens in and outside the EU and EFTA region. The investigation was initiated by the observation that Microsoft does not reveal or share publicly any data collected about users of its software. In addition, the company does not provide users of its (Office) software an option to turn off diagnostic and telemetry data sent back to the company. Researchers found that most of the data that the Microsoft software collects and \"sends home\" is diagnostics. Researchers also observed that Microsoft \"seemingly tried to make the system GDPR compliant by storing Office documents on servers based in the EU\". However, they discovered the software packages collected additional data that contained private user information, some of which was stored on servers located in the US. The Netherlands Ministry of Justice hired Privacy Company to probe and evaluate the use of Microsoft Office products in the public sector. \"Microsoft systematically collects data on a large scale about the individual use of Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and Outlook. Covertly, without informing people\", researchers of the Privacy Company stated in their blog post. \"Microsoft does not offer any choice with regard to the amount of data, or possibility to switch off the collection, or ability to see what data are collected, because the data stream is encoded.\"\nThe researchers commented that there is no need for Microsoft to store information such as IPs and email addresses, which are collected automatically by the software. \"Microsoft should not store these transient, functional data, unless the retention is strictly necessary, for example, for security purposes\", the researchers conclude in the final report by the Netherlands Ministry of Justice.\nAs a result of this in-depth study and its conclusions, the Netherlands regulatory body concluded that Microsoft has violated GDPR \"on many counts\" including \"lack of transparency and purpose limitation, and the lack of a legal ground for the processing.\" Microsoft has provided the Dutch authorities with an \"improvement plan\" that should satisfy Dutch regulators that it \"would end all violations\". The Dutch regulatory body is monitoring the situation and states that \"If progress is deemed insufficient or if the improvements offered are unsatisfactory, SLM Microsoft Rijk will reconsider its position and may ask the Dutch Data Protection Authority to carry out a prior consultation and to impose enforcement measures.\" When asked for a response by an IT professional publication, a Microsoft spokesperson stated: \"We are committed to our customers\u2019 privacy, putting them in control of their data and ensuring that Office ProPlus and other Microsoft products and services comply with GDPR and other applicable laws. We appreciate the opportunity to discuss our diagnostic data handling practices in Office ProPlus with the Dutch Ministry of Justice and look forward to a successful resolution of any concerns.\" The user privacy data issue affects ProPlus subscriptions of Microsoft Office 2016 and Microsoft Office 365, including the online version of Microsoft Office 365.\nHistory of releases.\nLegend:UnsupportedSupportedLatest versionPreview versionFuture version&lt;templatestyles src=\"Version/styles.css\" /&gt;\nVersion history.\nWindows versions.\nMicrosoft Office for Windows.\nMicrosoft Office for Windows started in October 1990 as a bundle of three applications designed for Microsoft Windows 3.0: Microsoft Word for Windows 1.1, Microsoft Excel for Windows 2.0, and Microsoft PowerPoint for Windows 2.0.\nMicrosoft Office for Windows 1.5 updated the suite with Microsoft Excel 3.0.\nVersion 1.6 added Microsoft Mail for PC Networks 2.1 to the bundle.\nMicrosoft Office 3.0.\nMicrosoft Office 3.0, also called Microsoft Office 92, was released on August 30, 1992, and contained Word 2.0, Excel 4.0, PowerPoint 3.0 and Mail 3.0. It was the first version of Office also released on CD-ROM. In 1993, Microsoft Office Professional was released, which added Microsoft Access 1.1.\nMicrosoft Office 4.x.\nMicrosoft Office 4.0 was released containing Word 6.0, Excel 4.0a, PowerPoint 3.0 and Mail in 1993. Word's version number jumped from 2.0 to 6.0 so that it would have the same version number as the MS-DOS and Macintosh versions (Excel and PowerPoint were already numbered the same as the Macintosh versions).\nMicrosoft Office 4.2 for Windows NT was released in 1994 for i386, Alpha, MIPS and PowerPC architectures, containing Word 6.0 and Excel 5.0 (both 32-bit), PowerPoint 4.0 (16-bit), and Microsoft Office Manager 4.2 (the precursor to the Office Shortcut Bar)).\nMicrosoft Office 95.\nMicrosoft Office 95 was released on August 24, 1995. Software version numbers were altered again to create parity across the suite\u00a0\u2013 every program was called version 7.0 meaning all but Word missed out versions. Office 95 included new components to the suite such as Schedule+ and Binder. Office for Windows 95 was designed as a fully 32-bit version to match Windows 95 although some apps not bundled as part of the suite at that time - Publisher for Windows 95 and Project 95 had some 16-bit components even though their main program executable was 32-bit.\nOffice 95 was available in two versions, Office 95 Standard and Office 95 Professional. The standard version consisted of Word 7.0, Excel 7.0, PowerPoint 7.0, and Schedule+ 7.0. The professional edition contained all of the items in the standard version plus Access 7.0. If the professional version was purchased in CD-ROM form, it also included Bookshelf.\nThe logo used in Office 95 returns in Office 97, 2000 and XP. Microsoft Office 98 Macintosh Edition also uses a similar logo.\nMicrosoft Office 97.\nMicrosoft Office 97 (Office 8.0) included hundreds of new features and improvements, such as introducing command bars, a paradigm in which menus and toolbars were made more similar in capability and visual design. Office 97 also featured Natural Language Systems and grammar checking. Office 97 featured new components to the suite including FrontPage 97, Expedia Streets 98 (in Small Business Edition), and Internet Explorer 3.0 &amp; 4.0.\nOffice 97 was the first version of Office to include the Office Assistant. In Brazil, it was also the first version to introduce the Registration Wizard, a precursor to Microsoft Product Activation. With this release, the accompanying apps, Project 98 and Publisher 98 also transitioned to fully 32-bit versions. Exchange Server, a mail server and calendaring server developed by Microsoft, is the server for Outlook after discontinuing Exchange Client.\nMicrosoft Office 2000.\nMicrosoft Office 2000 (Office 9.0) introduced adaptive menus, where little-used options were hidden from the user. It also introduced a new security feature, built around digital signatures, to diminish the threat of macro viruses. The Microsoft Script Editor, an optional tool that can edit script code, was also introduced in Office 2000. Office 2000 automatically trusts macros (written in VBA 6) that were digitally signed from authors who have been previously designated as trusted. Office 2000 also introduces PhotoDraw, a raster and vector imaging program, as well as Web Components, Visio, and Vizact.\nThe Registration Wizard, a precursor to Microsoft Product Activation, remained in Brazil and was also extended to Australia and New Zealand, though not for volume-licensed editions. Academic software in the United States and Canada also featured the Registration Wizard.\nMicrosoft Office XP.\nMicrosoft Office XP (Office 10.0 or Office 2002) was released in conjunction with Windows XP, and was a major upgrade with numerous enhancements and changes over Office 2000. Office XP introduced the Safe Mode feature, which allows applications such as Outlook to boot when it might otherwise fail by bypassing a corrupted registry or a faulty add-in. Smart tag is a technology introduced with Office XP in Word and Excel and discontinued in Office 2010.\nOffice XP also introduces new components including Document Imaging, Document Scanning, Clip Organizer, MapPoint, and Data Analyzer. Binder was replaced by Unbind, a program that can extract the contents of a Binder file. Unbind can be installed from the Office XP CD-ROM.\nOffice XP includes integrated voice command and text dictation capabilities, as well as handwriting recognition. It was the first version to require Microsoft Product Activation worldwide and in all editions as an anti-piracy measure, which attracted widespread controversy. Product Activation remained absent from Office for Mac releases until it was introduced in Office 2011 for Mac.\nMicrosoft Office 2003.\nMicrosoft Office 2003 (Office 11.0) was released in 2003. It featured a new logo. Two new applications made their debut in Office 2003: Microsoft InfoPath and OneNote. It is the first version to use new, more colorful icons. Outlook 2003 provides improved functionality in many areas, including Kerberos authentication, RPC over HTTP, Cached Exchange Mode, and an improved junk mail filter.\nOffice 2003 introduces three new programs to the Office product lineup: InfoPath, a program for designing, filling, and submitting electronic structured data forms; OneNote, a note-taking program for creating and organizing diagrams, graphics, handwritten notes, recorded audio, and text; and the Picture Manager graphics software which can open, manage, and share digital images.\nSharePoint, a web collaboration platform codenamed as Office Server, has integration and compatibility with Office 2003 and so on.\nMicrosoft Office 2007.\nMicrosoft Office 2007 (Office 12.0) was released in 2007. Office 2007's new features include a new graphical user interface called the Fluent User Interface, replacing the menus and toolbars that have been the cornerstone of Office since its inception with a tabbed toolbar, known as the Ribbon; new XML-based file formats called Office Open XML; and the inclusion of Groove, a collaborative software application.\nWhile Microsoft removed Data Analyzer, FrontPage, Vizact, and Schedule+ from Office 2007; they also added Communicator, Groove, SharePoint Designer, and Office Customization Tool (OCT) to the suite.\nMicrosoft Office 2010.\nMicrosoft Office 2010 (Office 14.0, Microsoft skipped 13.0 due to fear of 13) was finalized on April 15, 2010, and made available to consumers on June 15, 2010. The main features of Office 2010 include the backstage file menu, new collaboration tools, a customizable ribbon, protected view and a navigation panel. Office Communicator, an instant messaging and videotelephony application, was renamed into Lync 2010.\nThis is the first version to ship in 32-bit and 64-bit variants. Microsoft Office 2010 featured a new logo, which resembled the 2007 logo, except in gold, and with a modification in shape. Microsoft released Service Pack 1 for Office 2010 on June 28, 2011 and Service Pack 2 on July 16, 2013. Office Online was first released online along with SkyDrive, an online storing service.\nMicrosoft Office 2013.\nA technical preview of Microsoft Office 2013 (Build 15.0.3612.1010) was released on January 30, 2012, and a Customer Preview version was made available to consumers on July 16, 2012. It sports a revamped application interface; the interface is based on Metro, the interface of Windows Phone and Windows 8. Microsoft Outlook has received the most pronounced changes so far; for example, the Metro interface provides a new visualization for scheduled tasks. PowerPoint includes more templates and transition effects, and OneNote includes a new splash screen.\nOn May 16, 2011, new images of Office 15 were revealed, showing Excel with a tool for filtering data in a timeline, the ability to convert Roman numerals to Arabic numerals, and the integration of advanced trigonometric functions. In Word, the capability of inserting video and audio online as well as the broadcasting of documents on the Web were implemented. Microsoft has promised support for Office Open XML Strict starting with version 15, a format Microsoft has submitted to the ISO for interoperability with other office suites, and to aid adoption in the public sector. This version can read and write ODF 1.2 (Windows only).\nOn October 24, 2012, Office 2013 Professional Plus was released to manufacturing and was made available to TechNet and MSDN subscribers for download. On November 15, 2012, the 60-day trial version was released for public download. Office 2013 was released to general availability on January 29, 2013. Service Pack 1 for Office 2013 was released on February 25, 2014. Some applications were completely removed from the entire suite including SharePoint Workspace, Clip Organizer, and Office Picture Manager.\nMicrosoft Office 2016.\nOn January 22, 2015, the Microsoft Office blog announced that the next version of the suite for Windows desktop, Office 2016, was in development. On May 4, 2015, a public preview of Microsoft Office 2016 was released. Office 2016 was released for Mac OS X on July 9, 2015 and for Windows on September 22, 2015.\nUsers who had the Professional Plus 2016 subscription have the new Skype for Business app. Microsoft Teams, a team collaboration program meant to rival Slack, was released as a separate product for business and enterprise users.\nMicrosoft Office 2019.\nOn September 26, 2017, Microsoft announced that the next version of the suite for Windows desktop, Office 2019, was in development. On April 27, 2018, Microsoft released Office 2019 Commercial Preview for Windows 10. It was released to general availability for Windows 10 and for macOS on September 24, 2018.\nMicrosoft Office 2021.\nOn February 18, 2021, Microsoft announced that the next version of the suite for Windows desktop, Office 2021, was in development. This new version will be supported for five years and was released on October 5, 2021.\nMicrosoft Office 2024.\nOn November 14, 2023, Microsoft announced Office 2024, expected to be rolled out in the second half of 2024. The announcement was a reversal of their decision to discontinue the Office brand in January 2023. Like its predecessors, Office 2024 can be purchased under a perpetual license for the desktop. Office 2024 was released for customers under an LTSC contract on September 16, 2024. The consumer version of Office 2024 was released on October 1, 2024. Like its predecessors, Office 2024 is also available in a macOS variant.\nMac versions.\nPrior to packaging its various office-type Mac OS software applications into Office, Microsoft released Mac versions of Word 1.0 in 1984, the first year of the Macintosh computer; Excel 1.0 in 1985; and PowerPoint 1.0 in 1987. Microsoft does not include its Access database application in Office for Mac.\nMicrosoft has noted that some features are added to Office for Mac before they appear in Windows versions, such as Office for Mac 2001's Office Project Gallery and PowerPoint Movie feature, which allows users to save presentations as QuickTime movies. However, Microsoft Office for Mac has been long criticized for its lack of support of Unicode and for its lack of support for right-to-left languages, notably Arabic, Hebrew and Persian.\nEarly Office for Mac releases (1989\u20131994).\nMicrosoft Office for Mac was introduced for Mac OS in 1989, before Office was released for Windows. It included Word 4.0, Excel 2.2, PowerPoint 2.01, and Mail 1.37. It was originally a limited-time promotion but later became a regular product. With the release of Office on CD-ROM later that year, Microsoft became the first major Mac publisher to put its applications on CD-ROM.\nMicrosoft Office 1.5 for Mac was released in 1991 and included the updated Excel 3.0, the first application to support Apple's System 7 operating system.\nMicrosoft Office 3.0 for Mac was released in 1992 and included Word 5.0, Excel 4.0, PowerPoint 3.0 and Mail Client. Excel 4.0 was the first application to support new AppleScript.\nMicrosoft Office 4.2 for Mac was released in 1994. (Version 4.0 was skipped to synchronize version numbers with Office for Windows) Version 4.2 included Word 6.0, Excel 5.0, PowerPoint 4.0 and Mail 3.2. It was the first Office suite for Power Macintosh. Its user interface was identical to Office 4.2 for Windows leading many customers to comment that it wasn't Mac-like enough. The final release for Mac 68K was Office 4.2.1, which updated Word to version 6.0.1, somewhat improving performance.\nMicrosoft Office 98 Macintosh Edition.\nMicrosoft Office 98 Macintosh Edition was unveiled at MacWorld Expo/San Francisco in 1998. It introduced the Internet Explorer 4.0 web browser and Outlook Express, an Internet e-mail client and usenet newsgroup reader. Office 98 was re-engineered by Microsoft's Macintosh Business Unit to satisfy customers' desire for software they felt was more Mac-like. It included drag\u2013and-drop installation, self-repairing applications and Quick Thesaurus, before such features were available in Office for Windows. It also was the first version to support QuickTime movies.\nMicrosoft Office 2001 and v. X.\nMicrosoft Office 2001 was launched in 2000 as the last Office suite for the classic Mac OS. It required a PowerPC processor. This version introduced Entourage, an e-mail client that included information management tools such as a calendar, an address book, task lists and notes.\nMicrosoft Office v. X was released in 2001 and was the first version of Microsoft Office for Mac OS X. Support for Office v. X ended on January 9, 2007, after the release of the final update, 10.1.9 Office v.X includes Word X, Excel X, PowerPoint X, Entourage X, MSN Messenger for Mac and Windows Media Player 9 for Mac; it was the last version of Office for Mac to include Internet Explorer for Mac.\nOffice 2004.\nMicrosoft Office 2004 for Mac was released on May 11, 2004. It includes Microsoft Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Entourage and Virtual PC. It is the final version of Office to be built exclusively for PowerPC and to officially support G3 processors, as its sequel lists a G4, G5, or Intel processor as a requirement. It was notable for supporting Visual Basic for Applications (VBA), which is unavailable in Office 2008. This led Microsoft to extend support for Office 2004 from October 13, 2009, to January 10, 2012. VBA functionality was reintroduced in Office 2011, which is only compatible with Intel processors.\nOffice 2008.\nMicrosoft Office 2008 for Mac was released on January 15, 2008. It was the only Office for Mac suite to be compiled as a universal binary, being the first to feature native Intel support and the last to feature PowerPC support for G4 and G5 processors, although the suite is unofficially compatible with G3 processors. New features include native Office Open XML file format support, which debuted in Office 2007 for Windows, and stronger Microsoft Office password protection employing AES-128 and SHA-1. Benchmarks suggested that compared to its predecessor, Office 2008 ran at similar speeds on Intel machines and slower speeds on PowerPC machines. Office 2008 also lacked Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) support, leaving it with only 15 months of additional mainstream support compared to its predecessor. Nevertheless, five months after it was released, Microsoft said that Office 2008 was \"selling faster than any previous version of Office for Mac in the past 19 years\" and affirmed \"its commitment to future products for the Mac.\"\nOffice 2011.\nMicrosoft Office for Mac 2011 was released on October 26, 2010. It is the first version of Office for Mac to be compiled exclusively for Intel processors, dropping support for the PowerPC architecture. It features an OS X version of Outlook to replace the Entourage email client. This version of Outlook is intended to make the OS X version of Office work better with Microsoft's Exchange server and with those using Office for Windows. Office 2011 includes a Mac-based Ribbon similar to Office for Windows.\nOneNote and Outlook release (2014).\nMicrosoft OneNote for Mac was released on March 17, 2014. It marks the company's first release of the note-taking software on the Mac. It is available as a free download to all users of the Mac App Store in OS X Mavericks.\nMicrosoft Outlook 2016 for Mac debuted on October 31, 2014. It requires a paid Office 365 subscription, meaning that traditional Office 2011 retail or volume licenses cannot activate this version of Outlook. On that day, Microsoft confirmed that it would release the next version of Office for Mac in late 2015.\nDespite dropping support for older versions of OS X and only keeping support for 64-bit-only versions of OS X, these versions of OneNote and Outlook are 32-bit applications like their predecessors.\nOffice 2016.\nThe first Preview version of Microsoft Office 2016 for Mac was released on March 5, 2015. On July 9, 2015, Microsoft released the final version of Microsoft Office 2016 for Mac which includes Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook and OneNote. It was immediately made available for Office 365 subscribers with either a Home, Personal, Business, Business Premium, E3 or ProPlus subscription. A non\u2013Office 365 edition of Office 2016 was made available as a one-time purchase option on September 22, 2015.\nOffice 2024.\nMicrosoft Office 2024 (Fourth perpetual release of Office 16) for the Microsoft Windows and MacOS was released on October 1, 2024.\nMobile versions.\nOffice Mobile for iPhone was released on June 14, 2013, in the United States. Support for 135 markets and 27 languages was rolled out over a few days. It requires iOS 8 or later. Although the app also works on iPad devices, excluding the first generation, it is designed for a small screen. Office Mobile was released for Android phones on July 31, 2013, in the United States. Support for 117 markets and 33 languages was added gradually over several weeks. It is supported on Android 4.0 and later.\nOffice Mobile is or was also available, though no longer supported, on Windows Mobile, Windows Phone and Symbian. Windows RT devices (such as Microsoft Surface) were bundled with \"Office RT\", a port of the PC version of Office 2013 to ARM architecture. The applications contain most of the functionality available in their versions for Intel-compatible PCs, but some features have been removed.\nEarly Office Mobile releases.\nOriginally called Office Mobile which was shipped initially as \"Pocket Office\", was released by Microsoft with the Windows CE 1.0 operating system in 1996. This release was specifically for the Handheld PC hardware platform, as Windows Mobile Smartphone and Pocket PC hardware specifications had not yet been released. It consisted of Pocket Word and Pocket Excel; PowerPoint, Access, and Outlook were added later. With steady updates throughout subsequent releases of Windows Mobile, Office Mobile was rebranded as its current name after the release of the Windows Mobile 5.0 operating system. This release of Office Mobile also included PowerPoint Mobile for the first time. Accompanying the release of Microsoft OneNote 2007, a new optional addition to the Office Mobile line of programs was released as OneNote Mobile. With the release of Windows Mobile 6 Standard, Office Mobile became available for the Smartphone hardware platform, but unlike Office Mobile for the Professional and Classic versions of Windows Mobile, creation of new documents is not an added feature. A popular workaround is to create a new blank document in a desktop version of Office, synchronize it to the device, and then edit and save on the Windows Mobile device.\nIn June 2007, Microsoft announced a new version of the office suite, Office Mobile 2007. It became available as \"Office Mobile 6.1\" on September 26, 2007, as a free upgrade download to current Windows Mobile 5.0 and 6 users. However, \"Office Mobile 6.1 Upgrade\" is not compatible with Windows Mobile 5.0 powered devices running builds earlier than 14847. It is a pre-installed feature in subsequent releases of Windows Mobile 6 devices. Office Mobile 6.1 is compatible with the Office Open XML specification like its desktop counterpart.\nOn August 12, 2009, it was announced that Office Mobile would also be released for the Symbian platform as a joint agreement between Microsoft and Nokia. It was the first time Microsoft would develop Office mobile applications for another smartphone platform. The first application to appear on Nokia Eseries smartphones was Microsoft Office Communicator. In February 2012, Microsoft released OneNote, Lync 2010, Document Connection and PowerPoint Broadcast for Symbian. In April, Word Mobile, PowerPoint Mobile and Excel Mobile joined the Office Suite.\nOn October 21, 2010, Microsoft debuted Office Mobile 2010 with the release of Windows Phone 7. In Windows Phone, users can access and edit documents directly off of their SkyDrive or Office 365 accounts in a dedicated Office hub. The Office Hub, which is preinstalled into the operating system, contains Word, PowerPoint and Excel. The operating system also includes OneNote, although not as a part of the Office Hub. Lync is not included, but can be downloaded as standalone app from the Windows Phone Store free of charge.\nIn October 2012, Microsoft released a new version of Microsoft Office Mobile for Windows Phone 8 and Windows Phone 7.8.\nOffice for Android, iOS and Windows 10 Mobile.\nOffice Mobile was released for iPhone on June 14, 2013, and for Android phones on July 31, 2013.\nIn March 2014, Microsoft released Office Lens, a scanner app that enhances photos. Photos are then attached to an Office document. Office Lens is an app in the Windows Phone store, as well as built into the camera functionality in the OneNote apps for iOS and Windows 8.\nOn March 27, 2014, Microsoft launched Office for iPad, the first dedicated version of Office for tablet computers. In addition, Microsoft made the Android and iOS versions of Office Mobile free for 'home use' on phones, although the company still requires an Office 365 subscription for using Office Mobile for business use. On November 6, 2014, Office was subsequently made free for personal use on the iPad in addition to phones. As part of this announcement, Microsoft also split up its single \"Office suite\" app on iPhones into separate, standalone apps for Word, Excel and PowerPoint, released a revamped version of Office Mobile for iPhone, added direct integration with Dropbox, and previewed future versions of Office for other platforms.\nOffice for Android tablets was released on January 29, 2015, following a successful two-month preview period. These apps allow users to edit and create documents for free on devices with screen sizes of 10.1 inches or less, though as with the iPad versions, an Office 365 subscription is required to unlock premium features and for commercial use of the apps. Tablets with screen sizes larger than 10.1 inches are also supported, but, as was originally the case with the iPad version, are restricted to viewing documents only unless a valid Office 365 subscription is used to enable editing and document creation.\nOn January 21, 2015, during the \"Windows 10: The Next Chapter\" press event, Microsoft unveiled Office for Windows 10, Windows Runtime ports of the Android and iOS versions of the Office Mobile suite. Optimized for smartphones and tablets, they are universal apps that can run on both Windows and Windows for phones, and share similar underlying code. A simplified version of Outlook was also added to the suite. They will be bundled with Windows 10 mobile devices, and available from the Windows Store for the PC version of Windows 10. Although the preview versions were free for most editing, the release versions will require an Office 365 subscription on larger tablets (screen size larger than 10.1 inches) and desktops for editing, as with large Android tablets. Smaller tablets and phones will have most editing features for free.\nOn June 24, 2015, Microsoft released Word, Excel and PowerPoint as standalone apps on Google Play for Android phones, following a one-month preview. These apps have also been bundled with Android devices from major OEMs, as a result of Microsoft tying distribution of them and Skype to patent-licensing agreements related to the Android platform. The Android version is also supported on certain ChromeOS machines.\nOn February 19, 2020, Microsoft announced a new unified Office mobile app for Android and iOS. This app combines Word, Excel, and PowerPoint into a single app and introduces new capabilities as making quick notes, signing PDFs, scanning QR codes, and transferring files.\nOnline versions.\nOffice Web Apps was first revealed in October 2008 at PDC 2008 in Los Angeles. Chris Capossela, senior vice president of Microsoft business division, introduced Office Web Apps as lightweight versions of Word, Excel, PowerPoint and OneNote that allow people to create, edit and collaborate on Office documents through a web browser. According to Capossela, Office Web Apps was to become available as a part of Office Live Workspace. Office Web Apps was announced to be powered by AJAX as well as Silverlight; however, the latter is optional and its availability will only \"enhance the user experience, resulting in sharper images and improved rendering.\" Microsoft's Business Division President Stephen Elop stated during PDC 2008 that \"a technology preview of Office Web Apps would become available later in 2008\". However, the Technical Preview of Office Web Apps was not released until 2009.\nOn July 13, 2009, Microsoft announced at its Worldwide Partners Conference 2009 in New Orleans that Microsoft Office 2010 reached its \"Technical Preview\" development milestone and features of Office Web Apps were demonstrated to the public for the first time. Additionally, Microsoft announced that Office Web Apps would be made available to consumers online and free of charge, while Microsoft Software Assurance customers will have the option of running them on premises. Office 2010 beta testers were not given access to Office Web Apps at this date, and it was announced that it would be available for testers during August 2009. However, in August 2009, a Microsoft spokesperson stated that there had been a delay in the release of Office Web Apps Technical Preview and it would not be available by the end of August.\nMicrosoft officially released the Technical Preview of Office Web Apps on September 17, 2009. Office Web Apps was made available to selected testers via its OneDrive (at the time Skydrive) service. The final version of Office Web Apps was made available to the public via Windows Live Office on June 7, 2010.\nOn October 22, 2012, Microsoft announced the release of new features including co-authoring, performance improvements and touch support.\nOn November 6, 2013, Microsoft announced further new features including \"real-time\" co-authoring and an Auto-Save feature in Word (replacing the save button).\nIn February 2014, Office Web Apps were re-branded Office Online and incorporated into other Microsoft web services, including Calendar, OneDrive, Outlook.com, and People. Microsoft had previously attempted to unify its online services suite (including Microsoft Passport, Hotmail, MSN Messenger, and later SkyDrive) under a brand known as Windows Live, first launched in 2005. However, with the impending launch of Windows 8 and its increased use of cloud services, Microsoft dropped the Windows Live brand to emphasize that these services would now be built directly into Windows and not merely be a \"bolted on\" add-on. Critics had criticized the Windows Live brand for having no clear vision, as it was being applied to an increasingly broad array of unrelated services. At the same time, Windows Live Hotmail was re-launched as Outlook.com (sharing its name with the Microsoft Outlook personal information manager).\nIn July 2019, Microsoft announced that they were retiring the \"Online\" branding for Office Online. The product is now Office, and may be referred to as \"Office for the web\" or \"Office in a browser\".\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "20289", "revid": "91088", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20289", "title": "MultiMate", "text": "Word processing software\nMultiMate was a word processor developed by Multimate International for IBM PC MS-DOS computers in the early 1980s.\nHistory.\nWith 1,000 computers, Connecticut Mutual Life Insurance was one of the first large-volume customers for the IBM PC. Disliking existing software, it hired W. H. Jones &amp; Associates to write a word processor for the computer that would not require retraining its employees, already familiar with Wang word processors. W. H. Jones' head Will Jones and five other developers created the software, delivering a beta in 90 days. W. H. Jones retained the right to sell the program elsewhere, and WordMate appeared in December 1982. The company renamed itself to SoftWord Systems, then Multimate International, while renaming WordMate to MultiMate. Advertisements stated that MultiMate \"mimic[ked] the features and functions of a dedicated system\", and that it was \"modeled after the Wang word processor\". Like Connecticut Mutual, many customers purchased it because of the similarity with the Wang system.\nMultiMate was not marketed heavily to end-users, but was quickly popular with insurance companies, law firms, other business computer users and US government agencies and the military. While the Wang WP keyboard differs from the original PC keyboard, MultiMate compensated by providing a large plastic template that clips on the PC keyboard, and stick-on labels for the fronts of the PC keys. The template and labels color-code the combination keystrokes using the SHIFT, ALT and CTRL keys with all 10 of the PC's function keys and many of the character keys. Like Wang systems, MultiMate controls most editing operations with function keys, assigning four functions to each of the 10 function keys, which IBM initially located at the left side of the keyboard in two vertical rows. It also provides a \"document summary\" screen for each document, another Wang feature, which allows more sophisticated document-management than the brief file names allowed by MS-DOS and PC DOS. As function selection through key-controlled screen-top drop-down menus was popularized by other programs, MultiMate added menus.\nMultiMate's popularity rapidly grew. In January 1983 some employees were paid late because of slow sales, but two months later revenue grew 25-fold after good reviews appeared in magazines. The company's fiscal 1984 sales were $15 million or more, and by early 1985 MultiMate's installed base in companies was as large as former market leader WordStar's. Jones sold the company to Ashton-Tate in December 1985 for about $20 million. An Ashton-Tate press release called the acquisition \"the largest ever in the microcomputer software industry\".\nOther MultiMate products included foreign language versions of the software (e.g., \"MultiTexto\" in Spanish), a hardware interface card for file-transfer with Wang systems, a keyboard with extra function keys, and versions of MultiMate for different PC clone MS-DOS computers and PC networks from Novell, 3COM and IBM (Token Ring). Early attempts to create a MultiMate Data Manager and List Manager in-house never reached the market.\nMultimate International developed the core word processing software and utilities (file conversion, printer drivers), but purchased and adapted sub-programs for spelling and grammar checking, list management, outlining and print-time incorporation of graphics in word processing documents (MultiMate GraphLink). In addition to rebranding such externally developed programs, Multimate rewrote the documentation for each program and adapted the program interfaces to more closely resemble the word processor. The last version of MultiMate was packaged with many of these add-on programs under the product name \"MultiMate Advantage\" to compete with other word processor software, especially IBM DisplayWrite for DOS\u2014which Multimate International developers saw as their main competition in the business market\u2014and to a lesser extent WordPerfect, the DOS incarnation of Microsoft Word, and the Samna word processor, which had its roots in another office word processing computer.\nOne of the first \"clone\" versions of MultiMate was bundled with an early portable PC made by Corona. Other versions were written to match PCs by Radio Shack, Texas Instruments, Toshiba, the early Grid laptop and the IBM PC Junior.\nThe detailed MultiMate word processor documentation, which quickly grew to three volumes, gives the product a solid \"office product\" feel, using high-quality paper with its main reference section presented in a padded binder with fold-out easel. (A company legend was that the MultiMate user manual was written first, by an experienced Wang WP manager, then the programmers were told to write software to match it, which is how the Wang WP was created.)\nEarly releases of MultiMate gave users unlimited access to a toll-free support number and a promise of low-cost upgrades, which contributed to its dedicated user population. Support policies later were brought in line with Ashton-Tate's standard practices.\nMultiMate supports a variety of PC clones and hundreds of computer printers, each of which requires its own printer driver. The company's printer support is very strong with daisy-wheel and dot-matrix printers, but less so with PostScript fonts and laser printers.\nAshton-Tate never released a Windows version. It discontinued MultiMate's development efforts on VMS and Unix platforms and closed a development group in Dublin, Ireland. The product was dropped after the Ashton-Tate itself was purchased by Borland.\nReception.\n\"PC Magazine\" in February 1983 stated that MultiMate \"virtually remakes your computer into a Wang-like dedicated word processor\", and that it was \"very fast, easy to learn, and capable\" with many features. The review noted the application's inability to use more than 128K of RAM, but praised the documentation and built-in help, and stated that many commands required half the keystrokes of the WordStar equivalent. The review concluded \"MultiMate stands head and shoulders above many if not most [IBM PC word processors] ... an impressive entrant\". The magazine reported in March 1984 that version 3.2 was noticeably slower than 3.11, which the company attributed to additional safeguarding of data.\n\"BYTE\" in November 1984 was less positive. When evaluating MultiMate 3.11 and Leading Edge Word Processor, the magazine cited \"irritating inconsistencies\" in 3.11's user interface and documentation, a bug that \"can wreck your files\", and other flaws. The reviewer, an author of books on MultiMate and WordStar, concluded that both MultiMate and Leading Edge Word Processor were easy for novices to learn and had many features to avoid loss of data, but unsuitable for complex projects because of \"hard to decipher, awkward, and sometimes dangerous\" procedures. A separate review in the magazine described version 3.20 as being \"very safe\" because of many backups and safeguards and praised the formatting features, customization ability, and quality of the (very busy) toll-free help line. The review called MultiMate \"the klunkiest package\" of five tested word processors, because of the overemphasis on safety, criticized the built-in help and slow performance, and reported being unable to use the spell checker because of its poor quality. The reviewer mentioned that MultiMate version 3.30 was already shipping when the article went to press.\n\"Multimate Advantage II \"has finally caught up with mainstream microprocessor word processing programs\", John V. Lombardi of \"InfoWorld\" said in July 1987. He approved of its mail merge abilities, printer support, and documentation, but criticized its pagination, lack of indexing, and inability to handle documents larger than 128K. Lombardi concluded that MultiMate was \"a very good product, and much improved over its earlier versions\", below WordPerfect in functionality, but equal to Samna IV and superior to Officewriter 5.\nComputer Intelligence estimated in 1987 that Ashton-Tate had 17% of the Fortune 1000 PC word processor market, second to IBM and MicroPro at 25% each. A 1990 American Institute of Certified Public Accountants member survey found that 5% of respondents used MultiMate as their word processor.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "20290", "revid": "27823944", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20290", "title": "Mohammad Najibullah", "text": "Leader of Afghanistan from 1986 to 1992\nMohammad Najibullah Ahmadzai (Pashto; Dari: \u0645\u062d\u0645\u062f \u0646\u062c\u064a\u0628 \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647 \u0627\u062d\u0645\u062f\u0632\u06cc, 6 August 1947 \u2013 27 September 1996) was an Afghan military officer and politician who served as the fifth president of Afghanistan from 1987 until his resignation in April 1992, shortly after the Afghan mujahideen's takeover of Kabul. He was also the General Secretary of the People's Democratic Party of Afghanistan (PDPA) from 1986 to 1992. After a failed attempt to flee to India, Najibullah remained in Kabul, and lived in the United Nations headquarters until his assassination during the Taliban's first capture of Kabul in 1996.\nA graduate of Kabul University, Najibullah held different careers under the People's Democratic Party of Afghanistan (PDPA). Following the Saur Revolution and the establishment of the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan, Najibullah was a low-profile bureaucrat. He was sent into exile as Ambassador to Iran during Hafizullah Amin's rise to power. He returned to Afghanistan following the Soviet intervention which toppled Amin's rule and placed Babrak Karmal as head of the state, the party and the government. During Karmal's rule, Najibullah became head of the KHAD, the Afghan equivalent of the Soviet KGB. He was a member of the Parcham faction led by Karmal. During Najibullah's tenure as KHAD head, it became one of the most brutally efficient governmental organs. Because of this, he gained the attention of several leading Soviet officials, such as Yuri Andropov, Dmitriy Ustinov and Boris Ponomarev. In 1981, Najibullah was appointed to the PDPA Politburo. In 1985, Najibullah stepped down as the state security minister to focus on PDPA politics; he had been appointed to the PDPA Secretariat. Soviet General Secretary Mikhail Gorbachev, also the last Soviet leader, was able to get Karmal to step down as PDPA General Secretary in 1986, and replace him with Najibullah. For a number of months, Najibullah was locked in a power struggle against Karmal, who still retained his post of Chairman of the Revolutionary Council. Najibullah accused Karmal of trying to wreck his policy of National Reconciliation, a series of efforts by Najibullah to end the conflict.\nDuring his tenure as leader of Afghanistan, the Soviets began their withdrawal, and from 1989 until 1992, his government tried to solve the ongoing civil war without Soviet troops on the ground. While direct Soviet assistance ended with the withdrawal, the Soviet Union still supported Najibullah with economic and military aid, while Pakistan and the United States continued their support for the mujahideen. Throughout his tenure, he tried to build support for his government via the National Reconciliation reforms by distancing from socialism in favor of Afghan nationalism, abolishing the one-party state and letting non-communists join the government. He remained open to dialogue with the mujahideen and other groups, made Islam an official religion, and invited exiled businessmen back to re-take their properties. In the 1990 constitution, all references to communism were removed and Islam became the state religion. For various reasons, such changes did not win Najibullah any significant support. Following the August Coup in Moscow and the dissolution of the Soviet Union in December 1991, Najibullah was left without foreign aid. This, coupled with the internal collapse of his government (following the defection of general Abdul Rashid Dostum), led to his resignation in April 1992. In 1996, he was tortured and killed by the Taliban.\nIn 2017, the pro-Najibullah Watan Party was created as a continuation of Najibullah's party. Najibullah\u2019s legacy remains mixed as supporters laud him for his democratic efforts while critics cite the various human rights abuses during his tenure as head of the KHAD as well as alleged corruption under his government.\nEarly life and career.\nNajibullah was born on 6 August 1947 in the city of Gardez in the Paktia Province of the Kingdom of Afghanistan. His ancestral village of Najibqilla is located between the towns of Gardez and Said Karam, in an area known as Mehlan. He belonged to the Ahmadzai clan (Khel) of the Ghilji tribe of Pashtuns.\nNajibullah was educated at Habibia High School in Kabul, at St. Joseph's Higher Secondary School in Baramulla, Jammu and Kashmir, India, and at Kabul University where he began studying in 1964 and completed his Bachelor of Medicine, Bachelor of Surgery (MBBS) in 1975; however, he never practiced medicine. \nIn 1965, during his study in Kabul, Najibullah joined the Parcham (Banner) faction of the People's Democratic Party of Afghanistan (PDPA) and was twice imprisoned for political activities. He served as Babrak Karmal's close associate and bodyguard during the latter's tenure in the lower house of parliament (1965\u20131973).\nIn 1977, Najibullah was elected to the Central Committee. On 27 April 1978, the PDPA took power in Afghanistan (Saur Revolution), with Najibullah a member of the ruling Revolutionary Council; however, the Khalq (People's) faction of the PDPA gained supremacy over his own Parcham (Banner) faction, and after a brief stint as Ambassador to Iran, he was dismissed from government and went into exile in Europe, until the Soviet Union intervened in 1979 and supported a Parcham-dominated government.\nUnder Karmal: 1979\u20131986.\nMinister of State Security: 1980\u20131985.\nIn 1980, Najibullah was appointed the head of KHAD, the Afghan equivalent to the Soviet KGB, and was promoted to the rank of Major General. He was appointed following lobbying from the Soviets, including Yuri Andropov, then KGB Chairman. During his six years as head of KHAD he had two to four deputies under his command, who in turn were responsible for an estimated 12 departments. According to evidence, Najibullah was dependent on his family and his professional network, and more often than not appointed people he knew to top positions within the KHAD. In June 1981, Najibullah, along with Mohammad Aslam Watanjar, a former tank commander and the then Minister of Communications and Major General Mohammad Rafi, the Minister of Defence were appointed to the PDPA Politburo.\nUnder Najibullah, KHAD's personnel increased from 120 to 25,000 to 30,000. KHAD employees were amongst the best-paid government bureaucrats in communist Afghanistan, and because of it, the political indoctrination of KHAD officials was a top priority. During a PDPA conference, Najibullah, talking about the indoctrination programme of KHAD officials, said \"a weapon in one hand, a book in the other.\" Counter-insurgency activities launched by KHAD reached its peak under Najibullah. He reported directly to the Soviet KGB, and a big part of KHAD's budget came from the Soviet Union itself. As the head of KHAD, Najibullah was also involved in the planning of the hijacking of Pakistan International Airlines Flight 326 with Murtaza Bhutto.\nAs time would show, Najibullah was very efficient, and during his tenure as leader of KHAD, thousands were arrested, tortured, and executed. KHAD targeted anti-communist citizens, political opponents, and educated members of society. It was this efficiency which made him interesting to the Soviets. Because of this, KHAD became known for its ruthlessness. During his ascension to power, several Afghan politicians did not want Najibullah to succeed Babrak Karmal because Najibullah was known for exploiting his powers for his own benefit. Additionally, during his period as KHAD chief, the Pul-i Charki had become the home of several Khalqist politicians. Another problem was that Najibullah allowed graft, theft, bribery and corruption on a scale not seen previously. As would later be proven by the power struggle he had with Karmal after becoming PDPA General Secretary, despite Najibullah heading the KHAD for five years, Karmal still had sizeable support in the parcham faction leading to Najibullah relying more on Khalqists.\nRise to power: 1985\u20131986.\nHe was appointed to the PDPA Secretariat in November 1985. Najibullah's ascent to power was proven by turning KHAD from a government organ to a ministry in January 1986. With the situation in Afghanistan deteriorating, and the Soviet leadership looking for ways to withdraw, Mikhail Gorbachev wanted Karmal to resign as PDPA General Secretary. The question of who was to succeed Karmal was hotly debated, but Gorbachev supported Najibullah. Yuri Andropov, Boris Ponomarev and Dmitriy Ustinov all thought highly of Najibullah, and negotiations of who would succeed Karmal might have begun as early as 1983. Despite this, Najibullah was not the only choice the Soviets had. A GRU report argued that he was a Pashtun nationalist, a stance which could decrease the regime's popularity even more. The GRU preferred Assadullah Sarwari, earlier head of ASGA, the pre-KHAD secret police, who they believed would be better able to balance between the Pashtuns, Tajiks and Uzbeks. Another viable candidate was Abdul Qadir, who had been a participant in the Saur Revolution. Najibullah succeeded Karmal as PDPA General Secretary on 4 May 1986 at the 18th PDPA meeting, but Karmal still retained his post as Chairman of the Presidium of the Revolutionary Council.\nOn 15 May, Najibullah announced that a collective leadership had been established, which was led by himself consisted of himself as head of party, Karmal as head of state and Sultan Ali Keshtmand as Chairman of the Council of Ministers. When Najibullah took the office of PDPA General Secretary, Karmal still had enough support in the party to disgrace Najibullah. Karmal went as far as to spread rumours that Najibullah's rule was little more than an interregnum, and that he would soon be reappointed to the general secretaryship. As it turned out, Karmal's power base during this period was KHAD. The Soviet leadership wanted to ease Karmal out of politics, but when Najibullah began to complain that he was hampering his plans of National Reconciliation, the Soviet Politburo decided to remove Karmal; this motion was supported by Andrei Gromyko, Yuli Vorontsov, Eduard Shevardnadze, Anatoly Dobrynin and Viktor Chebrikov. A meeting in the PDPA in November relieved Karmal of his Revolutionary Council chairmanship, and he was exiled to Moscow where he was given a state-owned apartment and a dacha. In his position as Revolutionary Council chairman Karmal was succeeded by Haji Mohammad Chamkani, who was not a member of the PDPA.\nIn 1986, there were more than 100,000 political prisoners and there had been more than 16,500 extrajudicial executions. Its main objectives were the opponents of communism and the most educated classes in society.\nLeader: 1986\u20131992.\nNational Reconciliation.\nIn September 1986, the National Compromise Commission (NCC) was established on the orders of Najibullah. The NCC's goal was to contact counter-revolutionaries \"in order to complete the Saur Revolution in its new phase.\" Allegedly, an estimated 40,000 rebels were contacted by the government. At the end of 1986, Najibullah called for a six-months ceasefire and talks between the various opposition forces, this was part of his policy of National Reconciliation. The discussions, if fruitful, would lead to the establishment of a coalition government and be the end of the PDPA's monopoly of power. The programme failed, but the government was able to recruit disillusioned mujahideen fighters as government militias. A number of prominent Mujahideen commanders defected to the government, such as Ismatullah Muslim in Kandahar, Fazal Ahmad in Herat, and Juma Khan in Andarab with a large number of their followers in exchange for cash. Many more Mujahideen joined the government\u2019s tribal militias, some of them being incorporated into the Afghan Army as divisions. In many ways, the National Reconciliation led to an increasing number of urban dwellers to support his rule, and the stabilisation of the Afghan Armed Forces.\nIn September 1986, a new constitution was written, which was adopted on 29 November 1987. The constitution weakened the powers of the head of state by cancelling his absolute veto. The reason for this move, according to Najibullah, was the need for real-power sharing. On 13 July 1987, the official name of Afghanistan was changed from the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan to Republic of Afghanistan, and in June 1988 the Revolutionary Council, whose members were elected by the party leadership, was replaced by a National Assembly, an organ in which members were to be elected by the people. The PDPA's socialist stance was denied even more than previously, in 1989 the Minister of Higher Education began to work on the \"de-Sovietisation\" of universities, and in 1990 it was even announced by a party member that all PDPA members were Muslims and that the party had abandoned Marxism. Many parts of the Afghan government's economic monopoly was also broken, this had more to do with the tight situation than any ideological conviction. Abdul Hakim Misaq, the Mayor of Kabul, even stated that traffickers of stolen goods would not be prosecuted by law as long as their goods were given to the market. Yuli Vorontsov, on Gorbachev's orders, was able to get an agreement with the PDPA leadership to offer the posts of Gossoviet chairman (the state planning organ), the Council of Ministers chairmanship (head of government), ministries of defence, state security, communications, finance, presidencies of banks and the Supreme Court. The PDPA still demanded it held on to all deputy ministers, retained its majority in the state bureaucracy and that it retained all its provincial governors. The government was not willing to concede all of these positions, and when the offer was broadcast, the ministries of defence and state security.\nElections: 1987 and 1988.\nLocal elections were held in 1987. It began when the government introduced a law permitting the formation of other political parties, announced that it would be prepared to share power with representatives of opposition groups in the event of a coalition government, and issued a new constitution providing for a new bicameral National Assembly (Meli Shura), consisting of a Senate (Sena) and a House of Representatives (Wolesi Jirga), and a president to be indirectly elected to a 7-year term. The new political parties had to oppose colonialism, imperialism, neo-colonialism, Zionism, racial discrimination, apartheid and fascism. Najibullah stated that only the extremist part of the opposition could not join the planned coalition government. No parties had to share the PDPA's policy or ideology, but they could not oppose the bond between Afghanistan and the Soviet Union. A parliamentary election was held in 1988. The PDPA won 46 seats in the House of Representatives and controlled the government with support from the National Front, which won 45 seats, and from various newly recognized left-wing parties, which had won a total of 24 seats. Although the election was boycotted by the Mujahideen, the government left 50 of the 234 seats in the House of Representatives, as well as a small number of seats in the Senate, vacant in the hope that the guerrillas would end their armed struggle and participate in the government. The only armed opposition party to make peace with the government was Hizbollah, a small Shi'a party not to be confused with the bigger party in Iran or the Lebanese organization.\nEmergency.\nSeveral figures of the intelligentsia took Najibullah's offer seriously, even if they sympathised or were against the regime. Their hopes were dampened when the Najibullah government introduced the state of emergency on 18 February 1989, four days after the Soviet withdrawal due to a mujahideen offensive starting to take shape in Nangarhar Province, later leading to the Battle of Jalalabad. 1,700 intellectuals were arrested in February alone, and until November 1991 the government still supervised and restricted freedom of speech. Another problem was that party members took his policy seriously too, Najibullah recanted that most party members felt \"panic and pessimism\". At the Second Conference of the party, the majority of members, maybe up to 60 percent, were radical socialists. According to Soviet advisors (in 1987), a bitter debate within the party had broken out between those who advocated the Islamisation of the party and those who wanted to defend the gains of the Saur Revolution. Opposition to his policy of National Reconciliation was met party-wide, but especially from Karmalists. Many people did not support the handing out of the already small state resources the Afghan state had at its disposal. On the other side, several members were proclaiming anti-Soviet slogans as they accused the National Reconciliation programme to be supported and developed by the Soviet Union. Najibullah reassured the inter-party opposition that he would not give up the gains of the Saur Revolution, but to the contrary, preserve them, not give up the PDPA's monopoly on power, or to collaborate with reactionary Mullahs.\nAn Islamic state.\nDuring Babrak Karmal's later years, and during Najibullah's tenure, the PDPA tried to improve their standing with Muslims by moving, or appearing to move, to the political centre. They wanted to create a new image for the party and state. Communist symbols were either replaced or removed. These measures did not contribute to any notable increase in support for the government, because the mujahideen had a stronger legitimacy to protect Islam than the government; they had rebelled against what they saw as an anti-Islamic government, that government was the PDPA. Islamic principles were embedded in the 1987 constitution, for instance, Article 2 of the constitution stated that Islam was the state religion, and Article 73 stated that the head of state had to be born into a Muslim Afghan family. The 1990 constitution stated that Afghanistan was an Islamic state, and the last references to communism were removed. Article 1 of the 1990 Constitution said that Afghanistan was an \"independent, unitary and Islamic state.\" In 1990, Najibullah abolished the Democratic Women's Organisation of Afghanistan, eradicating their Marxist rhetoric as early as 1986, and replaced it with the apolitical Afghan Women's Council, which is still in existence.\nIn 1992, Najibullah appealed to the United States to help Afghanistan become a bulwark against the spread of Islamic fundamentalism. He said: \u201cIf fundamentalism comes to Afghanistan, war will continue for many more years. Afghanistan will turn into a centre of world smuggling for narcotic drugs. Afghanistan will be turned into a centre for terrorism\u201d.\nEconomic policies.\nNajibullah continued Karmal's economic policies. The augmenting of links with the Eastern Bloc and the Soviet Union continued, and so did bilateral trade. He encouraged the development of the private sector in industry. The Five-Year Economic and Social Development Plan which was introduced in January 1986 continued until March 1992, one month before the government's fall. According to the plan, the economy, which had grown less than 2 percent annually until 1985, would grow 25 percent in the plan. Industry would grow 28 percent, agriculture 14\u201316 percent, domestic trade by 150 percent and foreign trade with 15 percent. As expected, none of these targets were met, and 2 percent growth annually which had been the norm before the plan continued under Najibullah. The 1990 constitution gave due attention to the private sector. Article 20 was about the establishment of private firms, and Article 25 encouraged foreign investments in the private sector.\nAfghan\u2013Soviet relations.\nSoviet withdrawal.\nWhile he may have been the \"de jure\" leader of Afghanistan, Soviet advisers still did the majority of work when Najibullah took power. As Gorbachev remarked \"We're still doing everything ourselves [...]. That's all our people know how to do. They've tied Najibullah hand and foot.\" Fikryat Tabeev, the Soviet ambassador to Afghanistan, was accused of acting like a governor general by Gorbachev. Tabeev was recalled from Afghanistan in July 1986, but while Gorbachev called for the end of Soviet management of Afghanistan, he could not help but to do some managing himself. At a Soviet Politburo meeting, Gorbachev said \"It's difficult to build a new building out of old material [...] I hope to God that we haven't made a mistake with Najibullah.\" As time would prove, the problem was that Najibullah's aims were the opposite of the Soviet Union's; Najibullah was opposed to a Soviet withdrawal, the Soviet Union wanted a Soviet withdrawal. This was logical, considering the fact that the Afghan military was on the brink of dissolution. The only means of survival seemed to Najibullah was to retain the Soviet presence. In July 1986 six regiments, which consisted up to 15,000 troops, were withdrawn from Afghanistan. The aim of this early withdrawal was, according to Gorbachev, to show the world that the Soviet leadership was serious about leaving Afghanistan. The Soviets told the United States Government that they were planning to withdraw, but the United States Government did not believe them. When Gorbachev met with Ronald Reagan during his visit the United States, Reagan called for the dissolution of the Afghan army.\nOn 14 April 1988, the Afghan and Pakistani governments signed the Geneva Accords, and the Soviet Union and the United States signed as guarantors; the treaty specifically stated that the Soviet military had to withdraw from Afghanistan by 15 February 1989. Gorbachev later confided to Anatoly Chernyaev, a personal advisor to Gorbachev, that the Soviet withdrawal would be criticised for creating a bloodbath which could have been averted if the Soviets stayed. During a Politburo meeting Eduard Shevardnadze said \"We will leave the country in a deplorable situation\", and further talked about the economic collapse, and the need to keep at least 10 to 15,000 troops in Afghanistan. In this Vladimir Kryuchkov, the KGB Chairman, supported him. This stance, if implemented, would be a betrayal of the Geneva Accords just signed. During the second phase of the Soviet withdrawal, in 1989, Najibullah told Valentin Varennikov openly that he would do everything to slow down the Soviet departure. Varennikov in turn replied that such a move would not help, and would only lead to an international outcry against the war. Najibullah would repeat his position later that year, to a group of senior Soviet representatives in Kabul. This time Najibullah stated that Ahmad Shah Massoud was the main problem, and that he needed to be killed. In this, the Soviets agreed, but repeated that such a move would be a breach of the Geneva Accords; to hunt for Ahmad Shah Massoud so early on would disrupt the withdrawal, and would mean that the Soviet Union would fail to meet its deadline for withdrawal.\nDuring his January 1989 visit to Shevardnadze, Najibullah wanted to retain a small presence of Soviet troops in Afghanistan, and called for moving Soviet bombers to military bases close to the Afghan\u2013Soviet border and place them on permanent alert. Najibullah also repeated his claims that his government could not survive if Ahmad Shah Massoud remained alive. Shevardnadze again repeated that troops could not stay, since it would lead to international outcry, but said he would look into the matter. Shevardnadze demanded that the Soviet embassy created a plan in which at least 12,000 Soviet troops would remain in Afghanistan either under direct control of the United Nations or remain as \"volunteers\". The Soviet military leadership, when hearing of Shevardnadze's plan, became furious. But they followed orders, and named the operation \"Typhoon\", maybe ironic considering that Operation Typhoon was the German military operation against the city of Moscow during World War II. Shevardnadze contacted the Soviet leadership about moving a unit to break the siege of Kandahar, and to protect convoys from and to the city. The Soviet leadership were against Shevardnadze's plan, and Chernyaev even believed it was part of Najibullah's plan to keep Soviet troops in the country. To which Shevardnadze replied angrily \"You've not been there, [...] You've no idea all the things we have done there in the past ten years.\" At a Politburo meeting on 24 January, Shevardnadze argued that the Soviet leadership could not be indifferent to Najibullah and his government; again, Shevardnadze received support from Kryuchkov. In the end Shevardnadze lost the debate, and the Politburo reaffirmed their commitment to withdraw from Afghanistan. There was still a small presence of Soviet troops after the Soviet withdrawal; for instance, parachutists who protected the Soviet embassy staff, military advisors and special forces and reconnaissance troops still operated in the \"outlying provinces\", especially along the Afghan\u2013Soviet border.\nAid.\nSoviet military aid continued after their withdrawal, and massive quantities of food, fuel, ammunition and military equipment was given to the government. Varennikov visited Afghanistan in May 1989 to discuss ways and means to deliver the aid to the government. In 1990, Soviet aid amounted to an estimated 3 billion United States dollars. As it turned out, the Afghan military was entirely dependent on Soviet aid to function. When the Soviet Union was dissolved on 26 December 1991, Najibullah turned to former Soviet Central Asia for aid. These newly independent states had no wish to see Afghanistan being taken over by religious fundamentalists, and supplied Afghanistan with 6 million barrels of oil and 500,000 tons of wheat to survive the winter.\nAfter the Soviets.\nWith the Soviets' withdrawal in 1989, the Afghan army was left on its own to battle the insurgents. The most effective, and largest, assaults on the mujahideen were undertaken during the 1985\u201386 period. These offensives had forced the mujahideen on the defensive near Herat and Kandahar. The Soviets ensued a bomb and negotiate during 1986, and a major offensive that year included 10,000 Soviet troops and 8,000 Afghan troops.\nThe Pakistani people and establishment continued to support the Afghan mujahideen even if it was in contravention of the Geneva Accords. At the beginning, most observers expected the Najibullah government to collapse immediately, and to be replaced with an Islamic fundamentalist government. The Central Intelligence Agency stated in a report that the new government would be ambivalent, or even hostile towards the United States. Almost immediately after the Soviet withdrawal, the Battle of Jalalabad broke out between Afghan government forces and the mujahideen, in cooperation with Pakistan's Inter-Service Intelligence (ISI). The offensive against the city began when the mujahideen bribed several government military officers, from there, they tried to take the airport, but were repulsed with heavy casualties. The willingness of the common Afghan government soldier to fight increased when the mujahideen began to execute people during the battle. Hamid Gul, leader of the ISI, hoped that the battle would topple Najibullah's government and create a mujahideen government seated in Jalalabad. During the battle, Najibullah called for Soviet assistance. Gorbachev called an emergency session of the Politburo to discuss his proposal, but Najibullah's request was rejected. Other attacks against the city failed, and by April the government forces were on the offensive. During the battle over four hundred Scud missiles were shot, which were fired by a Soviet crew, which had stayed behind, in joint cooperation with the Afghan 99th Missile Brigade. When the battle ended in July, the mujahideen had lost an estimated 3,000 troops. One mujahideen commander lamented \"the battle of Jalalabad lost us credit won in ten years of fighting.\" After the mujahideen's defeat in Jalalabad, Gul blamed the administration of Pakistani Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto for the defeat. Bhutto eventually sacked Gul.\nHardline Khalqist Shahnawaz Tanai attempted to overthrow Najibullah in a failed coup attempt in March 1990, the coup was stopped however by the Khalqist General Aslam Watanjar. Although Tanai and his forces failed and fled to Pakistan, the coup attempt still managed to show weaknesses in Najibullah's government.\nFrom 1989 to 1990, the Najibullah government was partially successful in building up the Afghan defence forces. The Ministry of State Security had established a local militia force which stood at an estimated 100,000 men. The 17th Division in Herat, which had begun the 1979 Herat uprising against PDPA-rule, stood at 3,400 regular troops and 14,000 tribal men. In 1988, the total number of security forces available to the government stood at 300,000. This trend did not continue, and by the summer of 1990, the Afghan government forces were on the defensive again. By the beginning of 1991, the government controlled only 10 percent of Afghanistan, the eleven-year Siege of Khost had ended in a mujahideen victory and the morale of the Afghan military finally collapsed. In the Soviet Union, Kryuchkov and Shevardnadze had both supported continuing aid to the Najibullah government, but Kryuchkov had been arrested following the failed 1991 Soviet coup d'\u00e9tat attempt and Shevardnadze had resigned from his posts in the Soviet government in December 1990 \u2013 there were no longer any pro-Najibullah people in the Soviet leadership and the Soviet Union was in the middle of an economic and political crisis, which would lead directly to the dissolution of the Soviet Union on 26 December 1991. At the same time, Boris Yeltsin became Russia's new leader, and he had no wish to continue to aid Najibullah's government, which he considered a relic of the past. In the autumn of 1991, Najibullah wrote to Shevardnadze \"I didn't want to be president, you talked me into it, insisted on it, and promised support. Now you are throwing me and the Republic of Afghanistan to its fate.\"\nFall from power.\nBy January 1992, Najibullah had become internationally isolated, with the loss of his biggest supporter he decided to consolidate his power over the non Pashtuns who were considered less loyal to the regime. This came after complaints from his fellow Pashtun Kochis of harassment from an ethnic Tajik general, Abdul Momin. Momin had developed secret ties with the Tajik warlord Ahmad Shah Massoud and was passing on secret information to Massoud which led to Najibullah ordering the sacking of Momin which was carried out by Juma Achak, an Achakzai Pashtun who served as Commander of the Northern Zone and was known to hold Pashtun chauvinist views. \nGeneral Momin was replaced with General Rasul, an ethnic Pashtun Khalqist known for his brutal reputation of commander of Pul-e Charkhi Prison. This move offended many of the non Pashtun militias in the North and led to the defection of most Uzbek, Tajiks, Turkmen, Hazara and Ismaili Shias militias including ethnic Uzbek, General Abdul Rashid Dostum and his 40,000 Uzbek soldiers. The defectors would form an anti-Pashtun coalition known as the Movement of the North (Harakat-e Shamal) and ally with the Tajik Jamiat-e Islami and Hazara Hezbe Wahdat in taking on the mostly Pashtun, Afghan Military. \nMany Tajik Parchamites loyal to Babrak Karmal would defect en masse during the capture of Mazar-i-Sharif including General Mohammad Nabi Azimi with the Pashtun Khalqist and Pro-Najibullah army and paramilitaries defending the city. On 18 March 1992 Najibullah offered to resign, leading to many Pashtun Khalqist and Najibullah loyalists to ally with Gulbuddin Hekmatyar's Hezb-e Islami Gulbuddin in order to prevent non Pashtuns from seizing Kabul. The Peshawar Accord would be signed on 26 April 1992 between various Mujahadeen factions, leading to the creation of the new Islamic State of Afghanistan. However, Hezb-e Islami Gulbuddin and the Khalq would continue to fight this new government in the Third Afghan Civil War.\nRole of Ismailis in the overthrow of Dr. Najibullah.\nDuring the tumultuous period leading to the fall of Dr. Najibullah's government in Afghanistan, the Ismaili community, under the leadership of Sayed Mansur Naderi and his son Sayed Jafar Naderi, played a significant role in orchestrating the political and military maneuvers that culminated in Najibullah's ousting. The strategic mutiny led by these Ismaili leaders, in collaboration with other non-Pashtun factions, effectively disrupted Najibullah's main supply route from the former Soviet Union, directly contributing to the collapse of his regime. This pivotal action not only marked a turning point in Afghanistan's history but also highlighted the critical influence of the Ismaili community in shaping the nation's political landscape during a period of profound change and instability.\nFinal years and death.\nNot long before Kabul's fall, Najibullah appealed to the UN for protection after his guards fled, which was rejected. His attempt to flee to the airport was thwarted by troops of Abdul Rashid Dostum \u2013 once loyal to him, but now allied with Ahmad Shah Massoud \u2013 who controlled the airport. At the UN compound in Kabul, while waiting for the UN to negotiate his safe passage to India, he occupied himself by translating Peter Hopkirk's book \"The Great Game\" into his mother tongue Pashto. India was placed in a difficult position by deciding to allow Najibullah political asylum and safely escorting him out of the country. Supporters claimed he had always been close to India and should not be denied asylum, but others said doing so would risk antagonizing India's relationship with the new mujahideen government formed under the Peshawar Accord.\nIndia also refused to let him take refuge at the Indian embassy in Afghanistan as it risked creating \"subcontinental rivalries\" and reprisals against Kabul's Indian community, arguing that Najibullah would be far safer at the UN compound. All attempts failed and he eventually sought refuge in the local UN headquarters, where he would stay until 1996. In 1994, India sent senior diplomat M. K. Bhadrakumar to Kabul to hold talks with Ahmad Shah Massoud, the defence minister, to consolidate relations with the Afghan authorities, reopen the embassy, and allow Najibullah to fly to India, but Massoud refused. Bhadrakumar wrote in 2016 that he believed Massoud did not want Najibullah to leave as Massoud could strategically make use of him, and that Massoud \"probably harboured hopes of a co-habitation with Najib somewhere in the womb of time because that extraordinary Afghan politician was a strategic asset to have by his side\". At the time, Massoud was commanding the government's forces fighting the militias of Dostum and Gulbuddin Hekmatyar during the Battle of Kabul. A few months before his death, he quoted, \"Afghans keep making the same mistake,\" reflecting upon his translation to a visitor.\nIn September 1996, when the Taliban were about to enter Kabul, Massoud claimed to have offered Najibullah an opportunity to flee the capital. Najibullah refused. The reasons for his refusal might have been that unlike other members of the former regime, Najibullah had not been granted amnesty by the Islamic State of Afghanistan. The UN Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali had pleaded with the government of Burhanuddin Rabbani to allow Najibullah to leave the country as he felt that Najibullah was not safe as his presence was well known, Rabbani however refused to grant Najibullah amnesty. Massoud (a member of Rabbani's Jamiat-e Islami Party) himself claimed that Najibullah feared that \"if he fled with the Tajiks, he would be for ever damned in the eyes of his fellow Pashtuns.\" Others, like General Tokhi, who was with Najibullah until the day before his torture and murder, stated that Najibullah mistrusted Massoud after his militia had repeatedly fired rockets at the UN compound and had effectively barred Najibullah from leaving Kabul. \"If they wanted Najibullah to flee Kabul in safety,\" Tokhi said, \"they could have provided him the opportunity as they did with other high-ranking officials from the communist party from 1992 to 1996.\" Dr Najibullah was the only member of the old regime (besides Assadullah Sawari) to not be granted amnesty by the Islamic State of Afghanistan. Whatever his true motivations were, when Massoud's militia went to both Najibullah and General Tokhi and asked them to flee Kabul, they rejected the offer.\nNajibullah was at the UN compound when unknown soldiers came for him on the evening of 26 September 1996. He was abducted from UN custody, and shot in the head. It is alleged that members of the Taliban after finding his corpse dragged his corpse behind a truck through the streets of Kabul. His brother, General Shahpur Ahmadzai, was given the same treatment. Najibullah and Shahpur's bodies were hanged from a traffic light pole outside the Arg presidential palace the next day in order to show the public that a new era had begun. The Taliban prevented Islamic funeral prayers for Najibullah and Shahpur in Kabul, but the bodies were later handed over to the International Committee of the Red Cross who in turn sent their bodies to Gardez in Paktia Province, where both of them were buried after the Islamic funeral prayers for them by their fellow Ahmadzai tribesmen. The perpetrators of the murder have been debated, some including Soviet journalists Plastun and Andrianov who knew Najibullah personally, US Special Envoy to Afghanistan Peter Tomsen, the former National Directorate of Security, Afghanistan's Strategic and Scientific Research Center, and many Pashtun Nationalist including a former senator in Pakistan, Afrasiab Khattak have claimed that Najibullah was assassinated by the ISI (alongside members of the Taliban working for them) allegedly over his Pashtun nationalist stance Durand Line as well as revenge for the botched Battle of Jalalabad in 1989. In his book \"The Wars of Afghanistan\", Tomsen wrote, \u201cNajib's entrapment and execution carried the hallmarks of a classic intelligence operation. The Taliban, on their own, would not have taken such elaborate precautions to avoid violating the UN's diplomatic premises (where Dr Najibullah had taken sanctuary since stepping down in 1992).\u201d In 1996, Mullah Borjan, who was the commander-in-chief of the Taliban siege force on the southeast side of Kabul, claimed to have been approached by the ISI and asked to kill Najibullah. He made it clear that he would never allow Taliban forces to kill former President Najibullah. On 20 September, Mullah Borjan was shot and killed by his bodyguards for unknown reasons. A week later, Najibullah was killed.\nReactions.\nNews of Najibullah's murder was greeted with widespread international condemnation,&lt;ref name=\"un-51/108\"&gt;\"https://\" United Nations Resolution 51/108, Article 10. 12 December 1996. Retrieved 15 June 2015 \"Endorses the Special Rapporteur's condemnation of the abduction from United Nations premises of the former President of Afghanistan, Mr. Najibullah, and of his brother, and of their subsequent summary execution;\"&lt;/ref&gt; particularly from the Muslim world. The United Nations issued a statement which condemned the killing of Najibullah, and claimed that it would further destabilise Afghanistan. The Taliban responded by issuing death sentences on Dostum, Massoud and Burhanuddin Rabbani. India, which had been supporting Najibullah, strongly condemned his killing and began to support Massoud's United Front/Northern Alliance in an attempt to contain the rise of the Taliban.\nOn the 20th anniversary of his death, in 2016, Afghanistan's Research Center blamed the ISI for his death, claiming that the plan to kill Najibullah was implemented by Pakistan.\nOn 1 June 2020, following a visit to his grave in Gardez by the Afghan National Security Advisor Hamdullah Mohib, Najibullah's widow Fatana Najib said that before constructing a mausoleum for him, the government should first investigate his assassination.\nLegacy.\nAfter Najibullah's death, the brutal civil war between mujahideen factions, the Taliban regime, continued fighting, and enduring problems with corruption and poverty, his image among the Afghan people dramatically improved, and Najibullah came to be seen as a strong and patriotic leader. Since the 2010s, posters and pictures of him have become a common sight in many Afghan cities. Najibullah is a very popular figure amongst Pashtun Nationalists many of whom view his fall as the biggest blow to the Pashtun Nationalist Movement. Ever since the creation of Pakistan the various governments of Afghanistan whatever Monarchy, Republican or Communist had all backed Pashtun Nationalist parties such as ANP. The fall of Najibullah was considered by Afghan Mellat Wakman faction leader Anwar ul-Haq Ahady as \"the end of Pashtun dominance in Afghan politics\". \nIn 1997, the Watan Party of Afghanistan was formed and in 2003, the National United Party of Afghanistan was registered \u2013 who seek to unite former PDPA members formerly led by Mohammad Najibullah.\nViews.\nNajibullah is often referred to as a communist by some; however, his rule from 1987 to 1992 was marked with a shift away from communism towards Islamic socialism and a mixed economy. In terms of policy, Najibullah can be best compared to Daoud Khan, who ruled the Republic of Afghanistan before the PDPA took power in 1978. Najibullah's government also featured many former ministers of the Daoud Khan government. \nNajibullah was in support of restoration of the monarchy to some capacity, he restored Zahir Shah's citizenship and actively encouraged Zahir Shah to take part in negotiations, Najibullah's wife Fatana Najib is also related to former Afghan King Amanaullah. Najibullah was a Pashtun Nationalist being hailed as the first Afghan leader to speak Pashto at the UN General Assembly and having Afghan Cosmonaut Abdul Ahad Momand (also an Ethnic Pashtun) making Pashto the 4th language spoken in space under his leadership. He often questioning the legitimacy of Pakistan's existence claiming it was \"born out of British colonialism\". Najibullah whose father was also a Pashtun Nationalist, had strong ties to the Pashtun Nationalist community in the Pashtun majority North West Frontier province. Najibullah was present during the funeral for Pashtun Nationalist leader Abdul Ghaffar who was granted military honors. \nNajibullah also attempted to hand over the control of non Pashtun ethnic militias to Pashtun leaders as he had grown to distrust many northern militias such as Abdul Rashid Dostum's Uzbek militia which had committed atrocities and started to open channels with Ahmad Shah Massoud. A Soviet GRU dossier on Najibullah described him as \"A Pushtun nationalist, he is one of the motivating spirits of the policy of \u201cPushtunization\u201d of Afghan society. Within his closest circle he speaks only in Pashto. He is inclined to select colleagues not for their professional qualities but for their personal devotion to him, predominantly relatives and fellow-villagers\". Under Najibullah over 50% of Afghan media was in the Pashto language.\nFamily.\nNajibullah was married on 1 September 1974 to Fatana Najib, principal of the Peace School whom he met when she was an eighth-grade student and he was her science tutor. The couple had three daughters, who were forced to leave Afghanistan after the Taliban seizure and the start of the civil war. The daughters grew up with their mother in New Delhi, India, after moving there in 1992.\nNajibullah had at least three brothers: General Shahpur Ahmadzai who was murdered along with Najibullah in 1996, Sediqullah Rahi, a onetime Afghan National Bank employee who had also lived in Hamburg (then West Germany) and in 1988 defected to the Northern Alliance and fled to Pakistan aged 37 (born 1950 or 1951), and another, unnamed brother mentioned by Rahi as \"working for the KGB\" in 1988. This possibly refers to Roshan Ahmadzai, the third brother of Najibullah, who was a junior official of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Rahi later moved to the United States and denounced the Taliban as a \"religious fanatic group\" not wanted by the people of Afghanistan and stated that they \"represent the interests of Pakistan\". Their father died at a hospital in Kabul in 1983.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The CP/M version also ran on the TRS-80 Model II and 4, Commodore 128, and Apple II with a CP/M card. In France, Multiplan was also released for the Thomson computers in 1986 and, in the same year, it was released in Japan for MSX compatible computers with the name MSX-Plan.\nDespite the release of Microsoft Chart, a graphics companion program, Multiplan continued to be outsold by Lotus 1-2-3. Multiplan was replaced by Microsoft Excel, which followed some years later on both the Apple Macintosh (1985) and Microsoft Windows (1987).\nAlthough over a million copies were sold, Multiplan was not able to mount an effective challenge to Lotus 1-2-3. According to Bill Gates, this was due to the excessive number of ports (there were approximately 100 different versions of Multiplan). He also believed that it was a mistake to release 8-bit versions instead of focusing on the newer 16-bit machines and as a result, \"We decided to let [Lotus] have the character-based DOS market while we would instead focus on the next generation\u2013graphical software on the Macintosh and Windows.\" \nAround 1983, during the development of the first release of Windows, Microsoft had plans to make a Windows version. However, the plans changed a year later. Microsoft released Microsoft Excel in 1985, which became a very popular offering in the spreadsheet space.\nA version was available for the Apple Lisa 2 running Microsoft/SCO Xenix 3. It fit on one 400K microfloppy diskette.\nCell addressing differences.\nA fundamental difference between Multiplan and its competitors was Microsoft's decision to use R1C1 addressing instead of the A1 addressing introduced by VisiCalc. Although R1C1-style formulae are more straightforward than A1-style formulae\u00a0\u2013 for instance, \"RC[-1]\" (meaning \"current row, previous column\") is expressed as \"A1\" in cell B1, then \"A2\" in cell B2, etc.\u00a0\u2013 most spreadsheet users prefer the A1 addressing style introduced by VisiCalc.\nMicrosoft carried Multiplan's R1C1 legacy forward into Microsoft Excel, which offers both addressing modes, although A1 is Excel's default addressing mode.\nReception.\n\"Ahoy!\" in 1984 called the Commodore 64 version of Multiplan, distributed by Human Engineered Software, a \"professional quality spreadsheet ... There is not enough room in this article to mention all the mathematical operations performed ... Documentation is lengthy but well written\". A second review in the magazine noted the limitation of the computer's 40-column screen, but praised the ability to stop any ongoing action. It also praised the documentation, and concluded that \"its ease of use and foolproof design make \"Multiplan\" an outstanding value\". \"BYTE\" said that \"Multiplan for the Macintosh is a winner\", stating that combining other versions' power and features with the Macintosh's graphics and user interface \"rivals, and in many ways exceeds, anything else available in the spreadsheet genre\".\nA 1990 American Institute of Certified Public Accountants member survey found that 7% of respondents used Multiplan as their spreadsheet.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The design team had formerly worked at Motorola on the Motorola 6800 project; the 6502 is essentially a simplified, less expensive and faster version of that design using depletion-load NMOS technology that made using the microchip in computers much cheaper.\nWhen it was introduced, the 6502 was the least expensive microprocessor on the market by a considerable margin. It initially sold for less than one-sixth the cost of competing designs from larger companies, such as the 6800 or Intel 8080. Its introduction caused rapid decreases in pricing across the entire processor market. Along with the Zilog Z80, it sparked a series of projects that resulted in the home computer revolution of the early 1980s.\nHome video game consoles and home computers of the 1970s through the early 1990s, such as the Atari 2600, Atari 8-bit computers, Apple II, Nintendo Entertainment System, Commodore 64, Atari Lynx, BBC Micro and others, use the 6502 or variations of the basic design. Soon after the 6502's introduction, MOS Technology was purchased outright by Commodore International, who continued to sell the microprocessor and licenses to other manufacturers. In the early days of the 6502, it was second-sourced by Rockwell and Synertek, and later licensed to other companies.\nIn 1981, the Western Design Center started development of a CMOS version, the 65C02. This continues to be widely used in embedded systems, with estimated production volumes in the hundreds of millions.\nHistory and use.\nConception.\nThe origins of the 6502 chip date back to 1960, after the Soviet Union launched the first artificial Earth satellite \u2013 the Sputnik 1. During this time, Chuck Peddle worked at General Electric as an engineer-in-training, designing tests and systems for missiles and spaceships. As he advanced into his engineering career, he found room-sized computers to be a flawed model of centralized intelligence, and instead, considered distributing it locally. However, General Electric sold its computer division to Honeywell in 1970, liquidating the entire section he worked in.\nUndeterred, Peddle took this severance and started his own company in 1972 to make intelligent terminals for word-processing. Shortly after, Peddle found himself in a technological struggle; even though electronics were evolving at the time, it was still ridiculously complex to run the system he conceived. His idea required a microprocessor that would be capable of running programs. However, many companies were competing on the same technology for the same reason, including Motorola.\nOrigins at Motorola.\nMotorola started the 6800 microprocessor project in 1971 with Tom Bennett as the main architect. Motorola's engineers could run analog and digital simulations on an IBM 370-165 mainframe computer. The chip layout began in late 1972, the first 6800 chips were fabricated in February 1974 and the full family was officially released in November 1974. \nJohn Buchanan was the designer of the 6800 chip and Rod Orgill, who later did the 6501, assisted Buchanan with circuit analyses and chip layout. Bill Mensch joined Motorola in June 1971 after graduating from the University of Arizona (at age 26). His first assignment was helping define the peripheral ICs for the 6800 family and later he was the principal designer of the 6820 Peripheral Interface Adapter (PIA). Bennett hired Chuck Peddle in 1973 to do architectural support work on the 6800 family products already in progress. He contributed in many areas, including the design of the 6850 ACIA (serial interface).\nMotorola's target customers were established electronics companies such as Hewlett-Packard, Tektronix, TRW, and Chrysler. In May 1972, Motorola's engineers began visiting select customers and sharing the details of their proposed 8-bit microprocessor system with ROM, RAM, parallel and serial interfaces. In early 1974, they provided engineering samples of the chips so that customers could prototype their designs. Motorola's \"total product family\" strategy did not focus on the price of the microprocessor, but on reducing the customer's total design cost. They offered development software on a timeshare computer, the \"EXORciser\" debugging system, onsite training and field application engineer support. Both Intel and Motorola had initially announced a US$ price for a single microprocessor. The actual price for production quantities was much less. Motorola offered a design kit containing the 6800 with six support chips for US$.\nPeddle, who would accompany the salespeople on customer visits, found that customers were put off by the high cost of the microprocessor chips. At the same time, these visits invariably resulted in the engineers he presented to producing lists of required instructions that were much smaller than \"all these fancy instructions\" that had been included in the 6800. Peddle and other team members started outlining the design of an improved feature, reduced-size microprocessor. At that time, Motorola's new semiconductor fabrication facility in Austin, Texas, was having difficulty producing MOS chips, and mid-1974 was the beginning of a year-long recession in the semiconductor industry. Also, many of the Mesa, Arizona employees were displeased with the upcoming relocation to Austin.\nMotorola's Semiconductor Products Division management showed no interest in Peddle's low-cost microprocessor proposal. Eventually, Peddle was given an official letter telling him to stop working on the system. Peddle responded to the order by informing Motorola that the letter represented an official declaration of \"project abandonment\", and as such, the intellectual property he had developed to that point was now his. The 6502 was designed by many of the same engineers that had designed the Motorola 6800 microprocessor family.\nIn a November 1975 interview, Motorola's Chairman, Bob Galvin, ultimately agreed that Peddle's concept was a good one and that the division missed an opportunity, \"We did not choose the right leaders in the Semiconductor Products division.\" The division was reorganized and the management replaced. The new group vice president John Welty said, \"The semiconductor sales organization lost its sensitivity to customer needs and couldn't make speedy decisions.\"\nMOS Technology.\nPeddle began looking outside Motorola for a source of funding for this new project. He initially approached Mostek CEO L. J. Sevin, but was declined. Sevin later admitted this was because he was afraid Motorola would sue them.\nWhile Peddle was visiting Ford Motor Company on one of his sales trips, Bob Johnson, later head of Ford's engine automation division, mentioned that their former colleague John Paivinen had moved to General Instrument and taught himself semiconductor design. Paivinen then formed MOS Technology in Valley Forge, Pennsylvania in 1969 with two other executives from General Instrument, Mort Jaffe and Don McLaughlin. Allen-Bradley, a supplier of electronic components and industrial controls, acquired a majority interest in 1970. The company designed and fabricated custom ICs for customers and had developed a line of calculator chips.\nAfter the Mostek efforts fell through, Peddle approached Paivinen, who \"immediately got it\". On 19 August 1974, Chuck Peddle, Bill Mensch, Rod Orgill, Harry Bawcom, Ray Hirt, Terry Holdt, and Wil Mathys left Motorola to join MOS. Mike Janes joined later. Of the seventeen chip designers and layout people on the 6800 team, eight left. The goal of the team was to design and produce a low-cost microprocessor for embedded applications and to target as wide as possible a customer base. This would be possible only if the microprocessor was low cost, and the team set the price goal for volume purchases at $. Mensch later stated the goal was not the processor price itself, but to create a set of chips that could sell at $ to compete with the recently introduced Intel 4040 that sold for $ in a similar complete chipset.\nChips are produced by printing multiple copies of the chip design on the surface of a wafer, a thin disk of highly pure silicon. Smaller chips can be printed in greater numbers on the same wafer, decreasing their relative price. Additionally, wafers always include some number of tiny physical defects that are scattered across the surface. Any chip printed in that location will fail and has to be discarded. Smaller chips mean any single copy is less likely to be printed on a defect. For both of these reasons, the cost of the final product is strongly dependent on the size of the chip design.\nThe original 6800 chips were intended to be , but layout was completed at , or an area of . For the new design, the cost goal demanded a size goal of , or an area of , roughly half that of the 6800. Several new techniques would be needed to hit this goal.\nMoving to NMOS.\nTwo significant advances arrived in the market just as the 6502 was being designed that provided significant cost reductions. The first was the move to depletion-load NMOS. The 6800 used an early NMOS process, enhancement mode, that required three supply voltages. One of the 6800's headlining features was an onboard voltage doubler that allowed a single +5\u00a0V supply be used for +5, \u22125 and +12\u00a0V internally, as opposed to other chips of the era like the Intel 8080 that required three separate supply pins. While this feature reduced the complexity of the power supply and pin layout, it still required separate power line to the various gates on the chip, driving up complexity and size. By moving to the new depletion-load design, a single +5\u00a0V supply was all that was needed, eliminating all of this complexity.\nA further advantage was that depletion-load designs used less power while switching, thus running cooler and allowing higher operating speeds. Another practical offshoot is that the clock signal for earlier CPUs had to be strong enough to survive all the dissipation as it traveled through the circuits, which almost always required a separate external chip that could supply a powerful signal. With the reduced power requirements of depletion-load design, the clock could be moved onto the chip, simplifying the overall computer design. These changes greatly reduced complexity and the cost of implementing a complete system.\nA wider change taking place in the industry was the introduction of projection masking. Previously, chips were patterned onto the surface of the wafer by placing a mask on the surface of the wafer and then shining a bright light on it. The masks often picked up tiny bits of dirt or photoresist as they were lifted off the chip, causing flaws in those locations on any subsequent masking. With complex designs like CPUs, 5 or 6 such masking steps would be used, and the chance that at least one of these steps would introduce a flaw was very high. In most cases, 90% of such designs were flawed, resulting in a 10% yield. The price of the working examples had to cover the production cost of the 90% that were thrown away.\nIn 1973, Perkin-Elmer introduced the Micralign system, which projected an image of the mask on the wafer instead of requiring direct contact. Masks no longer picked up dirt from the wafers and lasted on the order of 100,000 uses rather than 10. This eliminated step-to-step failures and the high flaw rates formerly seen on complex designs. Yields on CPUs immediately jumped from 10% to 60 or 70%. This meant the price of the CPU declined roughly the same amount and the microprocessor suddenly became a commodity device.\nMOS Technology's existing fabrication lines were based on the older PMOS technology, they had not yet begun to work with NMOS when the team arrived. Paivinen promised to have an NMOS line up and running in time to begin the production of the new CPU. He delivered on the promise, the new line was ready by June 1975.\nDesign notes.\nChuck Peddle, Rod Orgill, and Wil Mathys designed the initial architecture of the new processors. A September 1975 article in \"EDN\" magazine gives this summary of the design:\nThe MOS Technology 650X family represents a conscious attempt of eight former Motorola employees who worked on the development of the 6800 system to put out a part that would replace and outperform the 6800, yet undersell it. With the benefit of hindsight gained on the 6800 project, the MOS Technology team headed by Chuck Peddle, made the following architectural changes in the Motorola CPU\u2026\nThe main change in terms of chip size was the elimination of the tri-state drivers from the address bus outputs. A three-state bus has states for \"1\", \"0\" and \"high impedance\". The last state is used to allow other devices to access the bus, and is typically used for multiprocessing, or more commonly in these roles, for direct memory access (DMA). While useful, this feature is expensive in terms of on-chip circuitry. The 6502 simply removed this feature, in keeping with its design as an inexpensive controller being used for specific tasks and communicating with simple devices. Peddle suggested that anyone who required this style of access could implement it with a 74158.\nThe next major difference was to simplify the registers. To start with, one of the two accumulators was removed. General-purpose registers like accumulators have to be accessed by many parts of the instruction decoder, and thus require significant amounts of wiring to move data to and from their storage. Two accumulators makes many coding tasks easier but costs the chip design itself significant complexity. Further savings were made by reducing the stack register from 16 to 8 bits, meaning that the stack could only be 256 bytes long, which was enough for its intended role as a microcontroller.\nThe 16-bit IX index register was split in two, becoming X and Y. More importantly, the style of access changed. In the 6800, IX held a 16-bit address which was offset by an 8-bit number stored with the instruction and added to the address. In the 6502 (and most other contemporary designs), the 16-bit base address was stored in the instruction, and the 8-bit X or Y was added to it.\nFinally, the instruction set was simplified, simplifying the decoder and control logic. Of the original 72 instructions in the 6800, 56 were implemented. Among those removed were instructions that operated between the 6800's two accumulators, and several branch instructions inspired by the PDP-11.\nThe chip's high-level design had to be turned into drawings of transistors and interconnects. At MOS Technology, the layout was a very manual process done with colored pencils and vellum paper. The layout consisted of thousands of polygon shapes on six different drawings; one for each layer of the fabrication process. Given the size limits, the entire chip design had to be constantly considered. Mensch and Paivinen worked on the instruction decoder while Mensch, Peddle and Orgill worked on the ALU and registers. A further advance, developed at a party, was a way to share some of the internal wiring to allow the ALU to be reduced in size.\nDespite their best efforts, the final design ended up being larger than the original target. The first 6502 chips were , for an area of . The original version of the processor had no rotate right (ROR) capability, so the instruction was omitted from the original documentation. The next iteration of the design shrank the chip and added the rotate right capability, and ROR was included in revised documentation.\nIntroducing the 6501 and 6502.\nMOS would introduce two microprocessors based on the same underlying design: the 6501 would plug into the same socket as the Motorola 6800, while the 6502 re-arranged the pinout to support an on-chip clock oscillator. Both would work with other support chips designed for the 6800. They would not run 6800 software because they had a different instruction set, different registers, and mostly different addressing modes. Rod Orgill was responsible for the 6501 design; he had assisted John Buchanan at Motorola on the 6800. Bill Mensch did the 6502; he was the designer of the 6820 PIA at Motorola. Harry Bawcom, Mike Janes and Sydney-Anne Holt helped with the layout.\nMOS Technology's microprocessor introduction was different from the traditional months-long product launch. The first run of a new integrated circuit is normally used for internal testing and shared with select customers as engineering samples. These chips often have minor design defects that will be corrected before production begins. Chuck Peddle's goal was to sell the first run 6501 and 6502 chips to the attendees at the WESCON trade show in San Francisco beginning on September 16, 1975. Peddle was a very effective spokesman and the MOS Technology microprocessors were extensively covered in the trade press. One of the earliest was a full-page story on the MCS6501 and MCS6502 microprocessors in the July 24, 1975 issue of \"Electronics\" magazine. Stories also ran in \"EE Times\" (August 24, 1975), \"EDN\" (September 20, 1975), \"Electronic News\" (November 3, 1975), \"Byte\" (November 1975) and \"Microcomputer Digest\" (November 1975). Advertisements for the 6501 appeared in several publications the first week of August 1975. The 6501 would be for sale at WESCON for $ each. In September 1975, the advertisements included both the 6501 and the 6502 microprocessors. The 6502 would cost only $ ().\nWhen MOS Technology arrived at Wescon, they found that exhibitors were not permitted to sell anything on the show floor. They rented the MacArthur Suite at the St. Francis Hotel and directed customers there to purchase the processors. At the suite, the processors were stored in large jars to imply that the chips were in production and readily available. The customers did not know the bottom half of each jar contained non-functional chips. The chips were $ and $ while the documentation package was an additional $. Users were encouraged to make photocopies of the documents, an inexpensive way for MOS Technology to distribute product information. The preliminary data sheets listed just 55 instructions and excluded the Rotate Right (ROR) instruction, which was not supported on these early chips. The reviews in \"Byte\" and \"EDN\" noted the lack of the ROR instruction. The next revision of the layout fixed this problem and the May 1976 datasheet listed 56 instructions. Peddle wanted every interested engineer and hobbyist to have access to the chips and documentation, whereas other semiconductor companies only wanted to deal with \"serious\" customers. For example, Signetics was introducing the 2650 microprocessor and its advertisements asked readers to write for information on their company letterhead.\nMotorola lawsuit.\nThe 6501/6502 introduction in print and at Wescon was a success. The press coverage got Motorola's attention, precipitating pricing adjustments and lawsuits. In October 1975, Motorola reduced the price of a single 6800 microprocessor from $ to $. The $ system design kit was reduced to $ and it now came with a printed circuit board. On November 3, 1975, Motorola sought an injunction in Federal Court to stop MOS Technology from making and selling microprocessor products. They also filed a lawsuit claiming patent infringement and misappropriation of trade secrets. Motorola claimed that seven former employees joined MOS Technology to create that company's microprocessor products.\nMotorola was a billion-dollar company with a plausible case and expensive lawyers. On October 30, 1974, Motorola had filed numerous patent applications on the microprocessor family and was granted twenty-five patents. The first was in June 1976 and the second was to Bill Mensch on July 6, 1976, for the 6820 PIA chip layout. These patents covered the 6800 bus and how the peripheral chips interfaced with the microprocessor. Motorola began making transistors in 1950 and had a portfolio of semiconductor patents. Allen-Bradley decided not to fight this case and sold their interest in MOS Technology back to the founders. Four of the former Motorola engineers were named in the suit: Chuck Peddle, Will Mathys, Bill Mensch and Rod Orgill. All were named inventors in the 6800 patent applications. During the discovery process, Motorola found that one engineer, Mike Janes, had ignored Peddle's instructions and brought his 6800 design documents to MOS Technology. In March 1976, the now independent MOS Technology was running out of money and had to settle the case. They agreed to drop the 6501 processor, pay Motorola $ and return the documents that Motorola contended were confidential. Both companies agreed to cross-license microprocessor patents. That May, Motorola dropped the price of a single 6800 microprocessor to $. By November, Commodore had acquired MOS Technology.\nComputers and games.\nWith legal troubles behind them, MOS was still left with the problem of getting developers to try their processor, prompting Chuck Peddle to design the MDT-650 (microcomputer development terminal) single-board computer. Another group inside the company designed the KIM-1, which was sold semi-complete and could be turned into a usable system with the addition of a 3rd party computer terminal and compact cassette drive. While it sold well to its intended market, the company found the KIM-1 also sold well to hobbyists and tinkerers. The related Rockwell AIM-65 control, training, and development system also did well. The software in the AIM 65 was based on that in the MDT. Another roughly similar product was the Synertek SYM-1.\nOne of the first external uses for the design was the Apple I microcomputer, introduced in 1976. The 6502 was next used in the Commodore PET and Apple II, both released in 1977. It was later used in the Atari 8-bit computers, Acorn Atom, BBC Micro, VIC-20 and other designs both for home computers and business, such as Ohio Scientific and Oric computers. The 6510, a direct successor of the 6502 with a digital I/O port and a tri-state address bus, was the CPU utilized in the best-selling Commodore 64 home computer.\nAnother important use of the 6500 family was in video games. The first to make use of the processor design was the 1977 Atari VCS, later renamed the Atari 2600. The VCS used a 6502 variant named the 6507, which had fewer pins, so it could address only 8\u00a0KB of memory. Millions of the Atari consoles would be sold, each with a MOS processor. Another significant use was by the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) and Famicom. The 6502 used in the NES was a second source version by Ricoh, a partial system on a chip, that lacked the binary-coded decimal mode but added 22 memory-mapped registers and on-die hardware for sound generation, joypad reading, and sprite list DMA. Called 2A03 in NTSC consoles and 2A07 in PAL consoles, this processor was produced exclusively for Nintendo.\n6502 or variants were used in all of Commodore's floppy disk drives for all of their 8-bit computers, from the PET line through the Commodore 128D, including the Commodore 64. 8-inch PET drives had two 6502 processors. Atari used the same 6507 used in the Atari 2600 for its 810 and 1050 disk drives used for all of their 8-bit computer line, from the 400/800 through the XEGS.\nIn the 1980s, a popular electronics magazine Elektor used the processor in its microprocessor development board Junior Computer.\nThe CMOS successor to the 6502, the WDC 65C02, also saw use in home computers and video game consoles. Apple used it in the Apple II line, starting with the Apple IIc and later variants of the Apple IIe, and also offered a kit to upgrade older IIe systems with the new processor. The Hudson Soft HuC6280 chip used in the TurboGrafx-16 was based on a 65C02 core. The Atari Lynx used a custom chip named \"Mikey\" designed by Epyx which included a VLSI VL65NC02 licensed cell. The G65SC12 by GTE Microcircuits (renamed California Micro Devices) variant was used in the BBC Master. Some models of the BBC Master also included an additional G65SC102 co-processor.\nProgrammers model.\nMOS 6502 registers\nThe 6502 is a little-endian 8-bit processor with a 16-bit address bus. The original versions were fabricated using an 8 \u00b5m process technology chip with a die size of , for a total area of .\nThe internal logic runs at the same speed as the external clock rate. It featured a simple pipeline; on each cycle, the processor fetches one byte from memory and processes another. This means that any single instruction can take as few as two cycles to complete, depending on the number of operands that instruction uses. For comparison, the Zilog Z80 required two cycles to fetch memory, and the minimum instruction time was four cycles. Thus, despite the lower clock speeds compared to competing designs, typically in the neighborhood of 1 to , the 6502's performance was competitive with CPUs using significantly faster clocks. This is partly due to a simple state machine implemented by combinational (clockless) logic to a greater extent than in many other designs; the two-phase clock (supplying two synchronizations per cycle) could thereby control the machine cycle directly.\nThis design also led to one useful design note of the 6502, and the 6800 before it. Because the chip only accessed memory during a certain part of the clock cycle, and this duration was indicated by the \u03c62-low clock-out pin, other chips in a system could access memory during those times when the 6502 was off the bus. This was sometimes known as \"hidden access\". This technique was widely used by computer systems; they would use memory capable of access at 2\u00a0MHz, and then run the CPU at 1\u00a0MHz. This guaranteed that the CPU and video hardware could interleave their accesses, with a total performance matching that of the memory device. Because this access was every other cycle, there was no need to signal the CPU to avoid using the bus, making this sort of access easy to implement without any bus logic.\n When faster memories became available in the 1980s, newer machines could use this same technique while running at higher clock rates, the BBC Micro used newer RAM that allowed its CPU to run at 2\u00a0MHz while still using the same bus sharing techniques.\nLike most simple CPUs of the era, the dynamic NMOS 6502 chip is not sequenced by microcode but decoded directly using a dedicated PLA. The decoder occupied about 15% of the chip area. This compares to later microcode-based designs like the Motorola 68000, where the microcode ROM and decoder engine represented about a third of the gates in the system.\nRegisters.\nLike its precursor, the 6800, the 6502 has very few registers. They include\nThis compares to a contemporaneous competitor, the Intel 8080, which likewise has one 8-bit accumulator and a 16-bit program counter, but has six more general-purpose 8-bit registers (which can be combined into three 16-bit pointers) and a larger 16-bit stack pointer.\nIn order to make up somewhat for the lack of registers, the 6502 includes a \"zero page\" addressing mode that uses one address byte in the instruction instead of the two needed to address the full of memory. This provides fast access to the first of RAM by using shorter instructions. For instance, an instruction to add a value from memory to the value in the accumulator would normally be three bytes, one for the instruction and two for the 16-bit address. Using the zero page reduces this to an 8-bit address, reducing the total instruction length to two bytes, and thus improving instruction performance.\nThe stack address space is to memory page codice_14, i.e. the address range codice_15\u2013codice_16 (codice_17\u2013codice_18). Software access to the stack is done via four implied addressing mode instructions, whose functions are to push or pop (pull) the accumulator or the processor status register. The same stack is also used for subroutine calls via the JSR (jump to subroutine) and RTS (return from subroutine) instructions and for interrupt handling.\nAddressing.\nThe chip uses the index and stack registers effectively with several addressing modes, including a fast \"direct page\" or \"zero page\" mode, similar to that found on the PDP-8, that accesses memory locations from addresses 0 to 255 with a single 8-bit address (saving the cycle normally required to fetch the high-order byte of the address)\u2014code for the 6502 uses the zero page much as code for other processors would use registers. On some 6502-based microcomputers with an operating system, the operating system uses most of zero page, leaving only a handful of locations for the user.\nAddressing modes also include \"implied\" (1-byte instructions); \"absolute\" (3 bytes); \"indexed absolute\" (3 bytes); \"indexed zero-page\" (2 bytes); \"relative\" (2 bytes); \"accumulator\" (1); \"indirect,x\" and \"indirect,y\" (2); and \"immediate\" (2). Absolute mode is a general-purpose mode. Branch instructions use a signed 8-bit offset relative to the instruction after the branch; the numerical range \u2212128..127 therefore translates to 128 bytes backward and 127 bytes forward from the instruction following the branch (which is 126 bytes backward and 129 bytes forward from the start of the branch instruction). Accumulator mode operates on the accumulator register and does not need any operand data. Immediate mode uses an 8-bit literal operand.\nIndirect addressing.\nThe indirect modes are useful for array processing and other looping. With the 5/6 cycle \"(indirect),y\" mode, the 8-bit Y register is added to a 16-bit base address read from zero page, which is located by a single byte following the opcode. The Y register is therefore an \"index\" register in the sense that it is used to hold an actual \"index\" (as opposed to the X register in the 6800, where a base address was directly stored and to which an immediate offset could be added). Incrementing the index register to walk the array byte-wise takes only two additional cycles. With the less frequently used \"(indirect,x)\" mode the effective address for the operation is found at the zero page address formed by adding the second byte of the instruction to the contents of the X register. Using the indexed modes, the zero page effectively acts as a set of up to 128 additional (though very slow) address registers.\nThe 6502 is capable of performing addition and subtraction in binary or binary-coded decimal. Placing the CPU into BCD mode with the codice_19 (set D flag) instruction results in decimal arithmetic, in which codice_20 would result in $00 and the carry (C) flag being set. In binary mode (codice_21, clear D flag), the same operation would result in $9A and the carry flag being cleared. Other than Atari BASIC, BCD mode was seldom used in home-computer applications.\nSee the article for a simple but characteristic example of 6502 assembly language.\nInstructions and opcodes.\n6502 instruction operation codes (\"opcodes\") are 8\u00a0bits long and have the general form AAABBBCC, where AAA and CC define the opcode, and BBB defines the addressing mode. For example, the codice_22 instruction performs a bitwise OR on the bits in the accumulator with another value. The instruction opcode is of the form 000bbb01, where bbb may be 010 for an immediate mode value (constant), 001 for zero-page fixed address, 011 for an absolute address, and so on. This pattern is not universal, as there are exceptions, but it allows opcode values to be easily converted to assembly mnemonics for the majority of instructions, handling the edge cases with special-purpose code.\nOf the 256 possible opcodes available using an 8-bit pattern, the original 6502 uses 151 of them, organized into 56 instructions with (possibly) multiple addressing modes. Depending on the instruction and addressing mode, the opcode may require zero, one or two additional bytes for operands. Hence 6502 machine instructions vary in length from one to three bytes. The operand is stored in the 6502's customary little-endian format.\nEach CPU machine instruction takes up a certain number of clock cycles, usually equal to the number of memory accesses. For example, the absolute indexing mode of the ORA instruction takes 4 clock cycles; 3 cycles to read the instruction and 1 cycle to read the value of the absolute address. If no memory is accessed, the number of clock cycles is two. The minimum clock cycles for any instruction is two. When using indexed addressing, if the result crosses a page boundary an extra clock cycle is added. Also, when a zero page address is used in indexing mode (e.g. zp,X) an extra clock cycle is added.\nThe 65C816, the 16-bit CMOS descendant of the 6502, also supports 24-bit addressing, which results in instructions being assembled with three-byte operands, also arranged in little-endian format.\nThe remaining 105 opcodes are undefined. In the original design, instructions where the low-order 4\u00a0bits (\"nibble\") were 3, 7, B or F were not used, providing room for future expansion. Likewise, the $x2 column had only a single entry, codice_23. The remaining 25 empty slots were distributed. Some of the empty slots were used in the 65C02 to provide both new instructions and variations on existing ones with new addressing modes. The $xF instructions were initially left free to allow 3rd-party vendors to add their own instructions, but later versions of the 65C02 standardized a set of bit manipulation instructions developed by Rockwell Semiconductor.\nAssembly language.\nA 6502 assembly language statement consists of a three-character instruction mnemonic, followed by any operands. Instructions that do not take a separate operand but target a single register based on the addressing mode combine the target register in the instruction mnemonic, so the assembler uses codice_24 as opposed to codice_25 to increment the X register.\nExample code.\nThe following 6502 assembly language source code is for a subroutine named codice_26, which copies a null-terminated character string from one location to another, converting upper-case letter characters to lower-case letters. The string being copied is the \"source\", and the string into which the converted source is stored is the \"destination\".\nIC hardware design.\nThe processor's non-maskable interrupt (NMI) input is edge sensitive, which means that the interrupt is triggered by the falling edge of the signal rather than its level. Consequently a wired-OR interrupt circuit cannot be readily supported. However, this also prevents nested NMI interrupts from occurring until the interrupt source hardware makes the NMI input inactive again, often under control of the NMI interrupt handler.\nThe simultaneous assertion of the NMI and IRQ (maskable) hardware interrupt lines causes IRQ to be ignored. However, if the IRQ line remains asserted after the servicing of the NMI, the processor will almost immediately respond to IRQ, as IRQ is level sensitive. Thus a sort of built-in interrupt priority was established in the 6502 design. (The first opcode of the NMI handler is executed before the IRQ is detected again.)\nThe B flag is set by the 6502's periodically sampling its NMI edge detector's output and its IRQ input. The IRQ signal being driven low is only recognized though if IRQs are not masked by the I flag. If in this way a NMI request or (maskable) IRQ is detected the B flag is set to zero and causes the processor to execute the BRK instruction next instead of executing the next instruction based on the program counter.\nThe BRK instruction then pushes the processor status onto the stack, with the B flag bit set to zero. At the end of its execution the BRK instruction resets the B flag's value to one. This is the only way the B flag can be modified. If an instruction other than the BRK instruction pushes the B flag onto the stack as part of the processor status the B flag always has the value one.\nA high-to-low transition on the SO input pin will set the processor's overflow status bit. This can be used for fast response to external hardware. For example, a high-speed polling device driver can poll the hardware once in only three cycles using a Branch-on-oVerflow-Clear (codice_27) instruction that branches to itself until overflow is set by an SO falling transition. The Commodore 1541 and other Commodore floppy disk drives use this technique to detect when the serializer is ready to transfer another byte of disk data. The system hardware and software design must ensure that an SO will not occur during arithmetic processing and disrupt calculations.\nVariations and derivatives.\nThe 6502 was the most prolific variant of the 65xx series family from MOS Technology.\nThe 6501 and 6502 have 40-pin DIP packages; the 6503, 6504, 6505, and 6507 are 28-pin DIP versions, for reduced chip and circuit board cost. In all of the 28-pin versions, the pin count is reduced by leaving off some of the high-order address pins and various combinations of function pins, making those functions unavailable.\nTypically, the 12 pins omitted to reduce the pin count from 40 to 28 are the three not connected (NC) pins, one of the two Vss pins, one of the clock pins, the SYNC pin, the set overflow (SO) pin, either the maskable interrupt or the non-maskable interrupt (NMI), and the four most-significant address lines (A12\u2013A15). The omission of four address pins reduces the external addressability to 4\u00a0KB (from the 64\u00a0KB of the 6502), though the internal PC register and all effective address calculations remain 16-bit.\nThe 6507 omits both interrupt pins in order to include address line A12, providing 8 KB of external addressability but no interrupt capability. The 6507 was used in the popular Atari 2600 video game console, the design of which divides the 8 KB memory space in half, allocating the lower half to the console's internal RAM and peripherals, and the upper half to the Game Cartridge, so Atari 2600 cartridges have a 4 KB address limit (and the same capacity limit unless the cartridge contains bank switching circuitry).\nOne popular 6502-based computer, the Commodore 64, used a modified 6502 CPU, the 6510. Unlike the 6503\u20136505 and 6507, the 6510 is a 40-pin chip that adds internal hardware: a 6-bit parallel I/O port mapped to addresses 0000 and 0001. The 6508 is another chip that, like the 6510, adds internal hardware: 256 bytes of SRAM and an 8-bit I/O port similar to those featured by the 6510. Though these chips do not have reduced pin counts compared to the 6502, they need new pins for the added parallel I/O port. In this case, no address lines are among the removed pins.\n16-bit derivatives.\nThe Western Design Center designed and, as of 2025[ [update]], still produces the WDC 65C816S processor, a 16-bit, static-core successor to the 65C02. The W65C816S is a newer variant of the 65C816, which is the core of the Apple IIGS computer and is the basis of the Ricoh 5A22 processor that powers the Super Nintendo Entertainment System. The W65C816S incorporates minor improvements over the 65C816 that make the newer chip not an exact hardware-compatible replacement for the earlier one. Among these improvements was conversion to a static core, which makes it possible to stop the clock in either phase without the registers losing data. Available through electronics distributors, as of March 2020, the W65C816S is officially rated for 14\u00a0MHz operation.\nThe Western Design Center also designed and produced the 65C802, which was a 65C816 core with a 64-kilobyte address space in a 65(C)02 pin-compatible package. The 65C802 could be retrofitted to a 6502 board and would function as a 65C02 on power-up, operating in \"emulation mode.\" As with the 65C816, a two-instruction sequence would switch the 65C802 to \"native mode\" operation, exposing its 16-bit accumulator and index registers, and other 65C816 features. The 65C802 was not widely used and production ended.\nBugs and quirks.\nThe 6502 had several bugs and quirks, which had to be accounted for when programming it:\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "20299", "revid": "2175", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20299", "title": "MOS Technology 6510", "text": "8-bit microprocessor\nThe MOS Technology 6510 is an 8-bit microprocessor designed by MOS Technology. It is a modified form of the very successful 6502. The 6510 is widely used in the Commodore 64 (C64) home computer and its variants. It is also used in the Seagate ST-251 MFM hard disk.\nThe primary change from the 6502 is the addition of an 8-bit general purpose I/O port, although only 6 I/O pins are available in the most common version of the 6510. In addition, the address bus can be made tri-state and the CPU can be halted cleanly.\nDescription.\nThe 6510 and variants were based on the same core as the 6502, and are opcode compatible, including undocumented opcodes.\nThe parallel port was provided by using several formerly unused pins, eliminating some, and re-arranging others. In the original 6502, pins 5, 35 and 36 were not connected. Pin 3, formerly the phase-1 clock out, was eliminated, as most roles did not require it. This left only CLKIN, moved to pin 1 from 37, and CLKOUT on its original pin 39. The SO pin, which was connected to the overflow flag in the processor status register, was eliminated as few applications made use of it and the new parallel port could provide similar functionality. The final pin to be removed was the VSS on pin 1, the original 6520 had it on both pin 1 and pin 21, on the opposite side of the chip, but only one was needed.\nThe pins were also re-arranged. The VSS (ground) on pin 1 became clock in, while the other pins on the right side all moved up to fill the space from the removed clock out on pin 3 and unused pin 5. This put address bus pins A0 to A13 on one side, instead of 0 through 11 on the 6502, removing two from the left side. On the left side, the SO and two unconnected pins were removed, while clock in moved to pin 1 and the two address pins to 19 and 20, leaving pins 29 through 24 to be available for the parallel port pins, P0 through P5.\nUse.\nIn the C64, the extra I/O pins of the processor are used to control the computer's memory map by bank switching, and for controlling three of the four signal lines of the Datasette tape recorder (the electric motor control, key-press sensing and write data lines; the read data line went to another I/O chip). It is possible, by writing the correct bit pattern to the processor at address $01, to completely expose almost the full 64\u00a0KB of RAM in the C64, leaving no ROM or I/O hardware exposed except for the processor I/O port itself and its data directional register at address $00.\nVariants.\nMOS 8500.\nIn 1985, MOS produced the 8500, an HMOS version of the 6510. Other than the process modification, it is virtually identical to the NMOS version of the 6510. The 8500 was originally designed for use in the modernised C64, the C64C. However, in 1985, limited quantities of 8500s were found on older NMOS-based C64s. It finally made its official debut in 1987, appearing in a motherboard using the new 85xx HMOS chipset.\nMOS 7501/8501.\nThe 7501/8501 variant of the 6510 was introduced in 1984. Compared to the 6510, this variant extends the number of I/O port pins from 6 to 8, but omits the pins for non-maskable interrupt and clock output. It is used in Commodore's C16, C116 and Plus/4 home computers, where its I/O port controls not only the Datasette but also the CBM Bus interface. The main difference between 7501 and 8501 CPUs is that they were manufactured with slightly different processes: 7501 was manufactured with HMOS-1 and 8501 with HMOS-2.\nMOS 8502.\nThe 2\u00a0MHz-capable 8502 variant is used in the Commodore 128.\nMOS 6510T.\nThe Commodore 1551 disk drive (for the Commodore Plus/4) uses the 6510T, a version of the 6510 with eight I/O lines. The NMI and RDY signals are not available.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
