He is the son of Beatles member John Lennon and his first wife Cynthia; Julian is named after his paternal grandmother Julia. Julian inspired three Beatles songs: \"Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds\" (1967), \"Hey Jude\" (1968), and \"Good Night\" (1968).\nLennon started a music career in 1984 with the album \"Valotte\", best known for \"Too Late for Goodbyes\" and the title track, and has since released six more albums. He has held exhibitions of his fine-art photography and has written several children's books. In 2006, Lennon produced the environmental documentary film \"Whaledreamers\", which won eight international awards. In 2007, he founded The White Feather Foundation (TWFF), whose stated mission goal is to address \"environmental and humanitarian issues\".\nIn 2020, Lennon was executive producer of the Netflix documentary \"Kiss the Ground\" about regenerative agriculture and the follow-up film \"Common Ground\". In 2022, Lennon was executive producer of the documentary film \"Women of the White Buffalo\", which chronicles the lives of women living on the Lakota Pine Ridge Indian Reservation.\nEarly life.\nJulian Lennon was born John Charles Julian Lennon on 8 April 1963 at Sefton General Hospital in Liverpool, to John Lennon and Cynthia Powell. He was named after his paternal grandmother, Julia Lennon, who died five years before his birth. The Beatles' manager, Brian Epstein, was his godfather. Lennon was educated firstly at Kingsmead School, Hoylake, during 1974\u20131975; then, when his mother remarried, he moved to Wales and attended Ruthin School, a boarding private school in the town of Ruthin, Denbighshire, in North Wales.\nLennon inspired one of his father's most famous songs, \"Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds\", whose lyrics describe a picture the boy had painted, a watercolour of his friend, Lucy O'Donnell, from nursery school, surrounded by stars. Another composition of his father inspired by him was the lullaby \"Good Night\", the closing song of \"The Beatles\" (also known as The White Album). In 1967, at the age of four, he attended the set of the Beatles' film \"Magical Mystery Tour\".\nWhen Julian was five years old, in 1968, his parents divorced, following his father's infidelity with Japanese multimedia artist Yoko Ono. John Lennon married Ono on 20 March 1969. Julian would later have a younger half-brother, Sean Lennon.\nPaul McCartney wrote \"Hey Jude\" to console him over the divorce; originally called \"Hey Jules\", McCartney changed the name because he thought that \"Jude\" was an easier name to sing. After his parents' divorce, Julian had almost no contact with his father until the early 1970s when, at the request of his father's then-girlfriend, May Pang (Yoko Ono and Lennon had temporarily separated), he began to visit his father regularly. John Lennon bought Julian a Gibson Les Paul guitar and a drum machine for Christmas 1973 and encouraged his interest in music by showing him some chords.\nRelationship with his father.\nFollowing his father's murder on 8 December 1980, Julian Lennon voiced anger and resentment toward him, saying, \"I've never really wanted to know the truth about how Dad was with me. There was some very negative stuff talked about me[...] like when he said I'd come out of a whiskey bottle on a Saturday night. Stuff like that. You think, where's the love in that? Paul and I used to hang about quite a bit[...] more than Dad and I did. We had a great friendship going and there seems to be far more pictures of me and Paul playing together at that age than there are pictures of me and my dad.\"\nJulian chafed at hearing his father's 'peace and love' stance perpetually celebrated. He told \"The Daily Telegraph,\" \"I have to say that, from my point of view, I felt he was a hypocrite. Dad could talk about peace and love out loud to the world but he could never show it to the people who supposedly meant the most to him: his wife and son. How can you talk about peace and love and have a family in bits and pieces\u2014no communication, adultery, divorce? You can't do it, not if you're being true and honest with yourself.\" Julian added, \"Mum was more about love than Dad. He sang about it, he spoke about, but he never really gave it, at least not to me as his son. The darker side definitely comes from Dad. Whenever I get too aggressive, which comes from Dad's side, I try to calm myself down, be more positive.\"\nRecalling his renewed contact with his father in the mid-1970s, Julian said in 2009, \"Dad and I got on a great deal better then. We had a lot of fun, laughed a lot and had a great time in general when he was with May Pang. My memories of that time with Dad and May are very clear\u2014they were the happiest time I can remember with him.\"\nJulian's father excluded him from his will but created a trust of \u00a3100,000 to be shared between Julian and his half-brother, Sean. Julian sued his father's estate and in 1996 reached a settlement agreement, authorised by Lennon's widow, Yoko Ono, reportedly worth \u00a320million.\nIn an interview with CBS News in 2009, Julian stated, \"I realised if I continued to feel that anger and bitterness towards my dad, I would have a constant cloud hanging over my head my whole life. After recording the song 'Lucy,' almost by nature, it felt right to fulfill the circle, forgive Dad, put the pain, anger and bitterness in the past, and focus and appreciate the good things. Writing is therapy for me and, for the first time in my life, I'm actually feeling it and believing it. It also has allowed me to actually embrace Dad and the Beatles.\"\nCareer.\nMusic career.\nAside from the Beatles, Lennon was influenced by David Bowie, Keith Jarrett, Steely Dan, and AC/DC.\nLennon made his musical debut at age 11 on his father's album \"Walls and Bridges\" playing drums on \"Ya-Ya\", later saying, \"Dad, had I known you were going to put it on the album, I would've played much better!\" In the sleeve notes in the album the song is credited to Julian Lennon \"starring on drums\" with \"dad on piano\".\nLennon enjoyed immediate success with his debut album, \"Valotte\", released in 1984. Produced by Phil Ramone, it spawned two top 10 hits, (the title track and \"Too Late for Goodbyes\") and earned Lennon a nomination for the Grammy Award for Best New Artist in 1986. Music videos for the two hits were made by film director Sam Peckinpah and producer Martin Lewis. After the album's release, Paul McCartney sent Lennon a telegram wishing him good luck.\nLennon's second album, 1986's \"The Secret Value of Daydreaming\", was panned by critics but reached number 32 on the \"Billboard\" 200 chart and produced the single \"Stick Around\", which was Lennon's first number-one single on the US Album Rock Tracks chart. He recorded the song \"Because\", previously recorded by the Dave Clark Five, in the UK for Clark's 1986 musical \"Time\".\nOn 1 April 1987, Julian Lennon appeared as the Baker in Mike Batt's musical \"The Hunting of the Snark\" (based on Lewis Carroll's poem). The all-star lineup included Roger Daltrey, Justin Hayward and Billy Connolly, with John Hurt as the narrator. The performance, a musical benefit at London's Royal Albert Hall in aid of the deaf, was attended by the Duchess of York. In October the same year he performed with Chuck Berry. Although Lennon never achieved the same level of success in the US as he had enjoyed with \"Valotte\", his 1989 single \"Now You're in Heaven\" peaked at number five in Australia and gave him his second number one hit on the Album Rock Tracks chart in the US.\nIn 1991, George Harrison sent some ideas for Lennon's album \"Help Yourself\", although he did not play or receive any credits. The single \"Saltwater\" reached number six in the UK and topped the Australian singles charts for four weeks. During this time, Lennon contributed a cover of the Rolling Stones' \"Ruby Tuesday\" to the soundtrack of the television series \"The Wonder Years\".\nLennon left the music business for several years in the 1990s to focus on philanthropy after his encounter with elders from the Mirning people of Australia. After he began his performing career, there was occasionally unfounded media speculation that Lennon would undertake performances with McCartney, Harrison and Ringo Starr. In the \"Beatles Anthology\" series in 1995, the three surviving Beatles confirmed there was never an idea of having Julian sit in for his father as part of a Beatles reunion, with McCartney saying, \"Why would we want to subject him to all of this?\"\nIn May 1998, Lennon released the album \"Photograph Smile\" on his own record label. Music critic Stephen Thomas Erlewine praised the album as \"well-crafted and melodic\", and concluded by saying that it was \"the kind of music that would receive greater praise if it weren't made by the son of a Beatle\". In 2002, he recorded a version of \"When I'm Sixty-Four\", from the Beatles' \"Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band\" album, for an Allstate Insurance commercial.\nIn 2006, he ventured into Internet businesses, including MyStore.com with Todd Meagher and Bebo founder Michael Birch. In 2009, Lennon created a new partnership with Meagher and Birch called theRevolution, LLC. Through this company, Lennon released a tribute song and EP, \"Lucy\", honouring the memory of Lucy Vodden (n\u00e9e O'Donnell), the little girl who inspired the song \"Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds\", with 50 per cent of the proceeds going to fund Lupus research.\nIn October 2011, Lennon released the album \"Everything Changes\". In 2012 he worked with music film director Dick Carruthers on the feature-length video documentary \"Through the Picture Window\", which followed Lennon's journey in the making of \"Everything Changes\" and includes interviews with Steven Tyler, Bono, Gregory Darling, Mark Spiro and Paul Buchanan from The Blue Nile. \"Through the Picture Window\" was also released as an app in all formats with bespoke videos for all 14 tracks from the album.\nOn September 9, 2022, Lennon's album \"Jude\" was released on BMG. It included the singles \"Freedom\" and \"Every Little Moment\". \"Goldmine\" wrote about the release, \"With his new album, the first in 11 years, Julian advances his body of work that has always simultaneously explored personal and global themes, but for the first time in his life, he's embracing his inner status as someone's son...[an] introspective masterwork from a diversely talented artist.\" The title is a reference to the Beatles song \"Hey Jude\", which Paul McCartney wrote in 1968 to give Julian Lennon hope for the future. Lennon said about his album title, \"Calling it \"Jude\" was very coming of age for me in that regard because it was very much facing up to who I am...The content came from over three decades of songwriting. The themes and issues mostly being the same, generally about the wars within and the wars without.\"\nOn 23 August 2024, Lennon released a new version of \"I Should Have Known\", which was remixed by Spike Stent. Lennon shared, \"[the song] was always a favourite of mine,\u201d says Lennon. \u201cI loved the way the new album ['Jude'] sounded in particular. (...) I thought maybe Mark 'Spike' Stent will remix this for me and give it a new life. I want it to breathe life into the world again.\"\nFilm.\nLennon's first tour as a solo musician, in early 1985, was documented as part of the film \"Stand by Me: A Portrait of Julian Lennon\"\u00a0\u2013 a film profile started by Sam Peckinpah, but completed by Martin Lewis after Peckinpah's death. Lennon has appeared in several other films including \"The Rolling Stones Rock and Roll Circus\" (released 1996, originally filmed in 1968), \"Cannes Man\" (1996), \"\" (1988), \"Chuck Berry: Hail! Hail! Rock 'n' Roll\" (1987) and a cameo in \"Leaving Las Vegas\" (1995) as a bartender. Julian provided the voice for the title role in the animated film \"David Copperfield\" (1993). He was also the voice of the main character Toby the Teapot in the animated special \"The Real Story of I'm a Little Teapot\" (1990).\nLennon is also the producer of the documentary, \"Whaledreamers\", about an Indigenous Australian tribe and the peoples' special connection with whales. It also touches on many environmental issues. This film received several awards and was shown at the 2007 Cannes Film Festival.\nIn 2018, Lennon was an executive producer of \"Women of the White Buffalo\", a documentary film released in 2022 that focused on several Lakota women from Pine Ridge Indian Reservation in South Dakota, and their work to preserve their way of life in the face of colonialism.\nIn 2020, Lennon was an executive producer of \"Kiss the Ground\", an award-winning documentary film about regenerative agriculture, narrated by Woody Harrelson.\nPhotography.\nAfter photographing his half-brother Sean's music tour in 2007, Lennon took up a serious interest in photography.\nOn 17 September 2010, Lennon opened an exhibition of 35 photographs called \"Timeless: The Photography of Julian Lennon\" with help from long-time friend and fellow photographer Timothy White. Originally scheduled to run from 17 September to 10 October, the Morrison Hotel Gallery extended it a week to end 17 October. The photographs include shots of his brother Sean and U2 frontman Bono.\nLennon's \"Alone\" collection was featured at the Art Basel Miami Beach Show from 6\u20139 December 2012, to raise money for The White Feather Foundation.\nLennon's \"Horizon\" series was featured at the Emmanuel Fremin Gallery, NYC, 12 March 2015, to 2 May 2015.\nLennon's \"Cycle\" exhibit was featured at the Leica Gallery in Los Angeles, in the fall of 2016.\nLennon uses the social media app Instagram to share his photography.\nIn 2021, Lennon became the first fine-arts photographer featured at the new gallery in Aston Martin Residences Miami.\nIn 2023, Lennon showed a series of photographs in an exhibition titled \"ATMOSPHERIA\" at William Turner Gallery in Santa Monica, California.\nIn 2024, Lennon released a book of his photographs entitled https://. It was published by the German publishing house, teNeues.\nBooks.\nShortly after the death of his father, Lennon began collecting Beatles memorabilia. In 2010, he published a book describing his collection, entitled: \"Beatles Memorabilia: The Julian Lennon Collection\".\nIn 2017, Lennon began a \"New York Times\" Bestselling trilogy, \"Touch the Earth\", \"Heal the Earth\" and \"Love the Earth\", which he completed in 2019.\nOn 9 November 2021, Lennon published a graphic novel for middle-grade children, \"The Morning Tribe\", with co-author Bart Davis.\nPhilanthropy.\nA conversation Lennon once had with his father went as follows: \"Dad once said to me that should he pass away, if there was some way of letting me know he was going to be OK \u2013 that we were all going to be OK \u2013 the message would come to me in the form of a white feather. ... the white feather has always represented peace to me\". Then Julian, while on a tour in Australia, received a white feather from two Indigenous elders of the Mirning tribe in Adelaide, Australia, asking for him to help give them a voice. In response, he produced the documentary \"Whaledreamers\" about their tribe, and in 2007 he founded The White Feather Foundation (TWFF), whose mission \"embraces environmental and humanitarian issues and in conjunction with partners from around the world helps to raise funds for the betterment of all life, and to honor those who have truly made a difference.\"\nTWFF partners with philanthropists and charities around the world to raise funds for various humanitarian projects in four major areas of giving: clean water, the preservation of Indigenous cultures, the environment and education and health. In 2008, the Prince of Monaco Albert II presented TWFF with the Better World Environmental Award.\nIn 2015, after the Nepal earthquake, TWFF contributed $106,347.52 to the Music for Relief's Nepal aid fund to support the victims of the earthquake.\nLennon visited Kenya, Ethiopia and Colombia in 2014 to witness the education and environmental initiatives by TWFF. After his mother's death the following year, Lennon announced that he would be naming TWFF's scholarship program after her: \"The Cynthia Lennon Scholarship for Girls\". Since then, the Foundation has awarded over 50 scholarships to girls across Africa, the U.K and the U.S.\nIn 2019, Lennon contributed his voice and music to the soundtrack of narrative feature film \"One Little Finger\", which has the initiative to spread awareness about 'ability in disability'. It shows how important and powerful music is to support societal and cognitive development of people with disabilities.\nIn September 2020, Lennon was honoured with the CC Forum Philanthropy Award in Monaco. That same month, he was named a UNESCO Center for Peace 2020 Cross-Cultural and Peace Crafter Award Laureate.\nIn 2022, Lennon recorded his version of his father's 1971 song \"Imagine\" with all proceeds going to support Ukraine.\nPersonal life.\nResidence and relationships.\nAfter living with his parents at Kenwood in Weybridge outside London from 1964 to 1968, Lennon moved with his mother to a number of British locales, eventually settling in The Wirral near Liverpool and then to a farm in North Wales. Lennon's first step-father, Roberto Bassanini, whom his mother married in 1970, was Italian. Lennon moved to the United States in the early 1980s where he resided in New York City and then Los Angeles. In 1991, Lennon moved to Europe, and resided mainly in Italy where Bassanini had lived (Lennon dedicated \"Photograph Smile\" to Bassanini in 1998). Lennon then moved to Monaco where he currently resides, and he is a friend to Albert II, Prince of Monaco.\nLennon has been quoted as having a reasonably \"cordial\" relationship with Ono, following the financial settlement against his late father's estate. He remains close to her son, Sean, his half-brother. Julian saw Sean perform live for the first time in Paris on 12 November 2006 at La Boule Noire, and he and Sean spent time together on Sean's tour in 2007.\nLennon has no children, revealing in 2011 that his difficult relationship with his father had discouraged him from doing so.\nIn 2020, he legally changed his name from John Charles Julian Lennon to Julian Charles John Lennon to reflect the name by which he has always been known.\nHealth.\nIn 2020, Lennon had a cancerous mole removed from his head. In December 2024, he revealed on \"The Joe Rogan Experience\" podcast that he was waiting for the results of a biopsy recently taken from his arm.\nJohn Lennon's Legacy.\nIn commemoration of John Lennon's 70th birthday and as a statement for peace, Lennon and his mother, Cynthia, unveiled the John Lennon Peace Monument in his home town of Liverpool, on 9 October 2010.\nLennon remains friends with his father's former bandmate Paul McCartney, though they experienced a brief public falling out in 2011 when Lennon was not invited to McCartney's wedding to Nancy Shevell. According to Lennon, McCartney later assured him that \"someone obviously made a huge mistake\" and the snub had not been intentional. McCartney provided the handwritten \"Jude\" motif for Lennon's 2022 album. He also remains friends with May Pang who provided the cover photo for \"Jude\". He shared his memories of her and his father in Pang's 2022 documentary \"The Lost Weekend: A Love Story.\"\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Since the advent of the World Cup in 1930, two different trophies have been used: the Jules Rimet Trophy from 1930 to 1970, and thereafter the FIFA World Cup Trophy from 1974 to the present day. The production cost of the current trophy is estimated at $242,700.\nThe first trophy, originally named \"Victory\", but later renamed in honor of FIFA president Jules Rimet, was made of gold plated sterling silver and a lapis lazuli base. It depicted Nike, the Greek goddess of victory. Brazil was awarded the trophy in perpetuity following their third title in 1970, prompting the commissioning of a replacement. The original Jules Rimet Trophy was stolen in 1983 and has never been recovered.\nThe subsequent trophy, called the \"FIFA World Cup Trophy\", was introduced in 1974. Made of 18 karat gold with bands of malachite on its base, it stands high and weighs . The trophy was made by the GDE Bertoni company in Italy. It depicts two human figures holding up the Earth. The current holders of the trophy are Argentina, winners of the 2022 World Cup. The trophy is kept at the FIFA World Football Museum in Z\u00fcrich, Switzerland, and leaves there only on select occasions. World Cup winners receive a gold-plated bronze replica, which they possess until the next World Cup final and in perpetuity if they have won it three times.\nOnly a selected few are officially allowed to touch the trophy with bare hands, including players and managers who have won the competition, heads of state, and FIFA officials.\nJules Rimet Trophy.\nThe Jules Rimet Cup was the original trophy of the FIFA World Cup. Originally called \"Victory\", but generally known simply as the \"World Cup\" or \"Coupe du Monde\", it was renamed in 1946 to honour the FIFA President Jules Rimet, who in 1929 passed a vote to initiate the competition. It was designed by French sculptor Abel Lafleur and made of gold-plated sterling silver on a lapis lazuli base. In 1954 the base was replaced with a taller version to accommodate more winners' details. It stood 35\u00a0centimetres (14\u00a0in) high and weighed 3.8\u00a0kilograms (8.4\u00a0lb). It comprised a decagonal cup, supported by a winged figure representing Nike, the ancient Greek goddess of victory. The Jules Rimet Trophy was taken to Uruguay for the first FIFA World Cup aboard the \"Conte Verde\", which set sail from Villefranche-sur-Mer, just southeast of Nice, in June 1930. This was the same ship that carried Jules Rimet and the footballers representing France, Romania, and Belgium who were participating in the tournament that year. The first team to be awarded the trophy was Uruguay, the winners of the 1930 World Cup.\nDuring World War II, the trophy was held by 1938 champion Italy. Ottorino Barassi, the Italian vice-president of FIFA and president of FIGC, secretly transported the trophy from a bank in Rome and hid it in a shoe-box under his bed to prevent the Nazis from taking it. The 1958 FIFA World Cup in Sweden marked the beginning of a tradition regarding the trophy. As Brazilian captain Hilderaldo Bellini heard photographers' requests for a better view of the Jules Rimet Trophy, he lifted it up in the air. Every cup-winning captain since has repeated the gesture.\nOn 20 March 1966, four months before the 1966 FIFA World Cup in England, the trophy was stolen during a public exhibition at Westminster Central Hall. It was found seven days later wrapped in newspaper at the bottom of a suburban garden hedge in Beulah Hill, Upper Norwood, South London, by a black and white collie dog named Pickles.\nAs a security measure, the (English) Football Association secretly manufactured a replica of the trophy for use in exhibitions rather than the original. This replica was used on occasions until the original trophy had to be handed back to FIFA for the next competition in 1970. Since FIFA had explicitly denied the FA permission to create a replica, the replica also had to disappear from public view and was for many years kept under its creator's bed. This replica was sold at an auction in 1997 for \u00a3254,500, when it was purchased by FIFA. The high auction price, 10 times the reserve price of \u00a320,000\u201330,000, was led by speculation that the auctioned trophy was not the replica trophy but the original itself. Testing by FIFA confirmed the auctioned trophy was a replica. Soon afterwards FIFA arranged for the replica to be lent for display at the English National Football Museum, which was then based in Preston but is now in Manchester.\nThe Brazilian team won the tournament for the third time in 1970, allowing them to keep the real trophy in perpetuity, as had been stipulated by Jules Rimet in 1930. It was put on display at the Brazilian Football Confederation headquarters in Rio de Janeiro, in a cabinet with a front of bullet-proof glass.\nOn 19 December 1983, the trophy was stolen again. The wooden rear of the cabinet was forced open with a crowbar and the cup was taken. Four men were tried and convicted in absentia for the crime. The trophy has never been recovered, and it is widely believed to have been melted down and sold into gold bars. However, some believe the trophy wasn't melted down and was instead sold onto the black market and may still exist.\nOnly one piece of the Jules Rimet Trophy has been found, the original base, which FIFA had kept in a basement of the federation's Z\u00fcrich headquarters prior to 2015.\nThe Confederation commissioned a replica of their own, made by Eastman Kodak, using of gold. This replica was presented to Brazilian military president Jo\u00e3o Figueiredo in 1984.\nNew trophy.\nA replacement trophy was commissioned by FIFA for the 1974 World Cup. Fifty-three submissions were received from sculptors in seven countries. Italian artist Silvio Gazzaniga was awarded the commission. The trophy stands tall and is made using of 18 karat (75%) gold, worth approximately US$407,725 as of 25-AUG-2025. Its base is in diameter containing two layers of malachite which adds another to the total weight. Chemist Sir Martyn Poliakoff claims that the trophy is hollow, because if it were solid gold, the trophy would weigh and would be too heavy to lift; the trophy's original manufacturer has confirmed its hollowness.\nProduced by GDE Bertoni in Paderno Dugnano, it depicts two human figures holding up the Earth. Gazzaniga described the trophy thus, \"The lines spring out from the base, rising in spirals, stretching out to receive the world. From the remarkable dynamic tensions of the compact body of the sculpture rise the figures of two athletes at the stirring moment of victory\".\nThe Cup used to be kept by the winning team until the final draw of the next tournament, but that is no longer the case. Instead the winners of the tournament receive a bronze replica which is gold-plated rather than solid gold. Likewise, three-time winners keep the replica instead of the original cup. Germany became the first nation to win the new trophy for the third time when they won the 2014 FIFA World Cup, and Argentina became the second nation following their third win in Qatar at the 2022 FIFA World Cup.\nThe trophy has the engraving \"FIFA World Cup\" on its base. After the 1994 FIFA World Cup, a plate was added to the bottom side of the trophy where the names of winning countries are engraved, names therefore not visible when the trophy is standing upright. The inscriptions state the year in figures and the name of the winning nation in its national language \u2013 for example, \"1974 \" or \"1994 \". In 2010, the name of the winning nation was engraved as \"2010 Spain\" in English, not in Spanish. This was corrected in the new plate made after the 2018 World Cup. As of 2022, twelve winners have been engraved on the base. The plate is replaced each World Cup cycle and the names of the trophy winners are rearranged into a spiral to accommodate future winners.\nThe original trophy is now permanently kept at the FIFA World Football Museum in Z\u00fcrich, Switzerland. It leaves there only when it goes on its FIFA World Cup Trophy Tour. It is present at the Final draw for the next World Cup, and on the pitch at the World Cup opening game and Final. The FIFA World Cup Trophy Tour was inaugurated for the 2006 FIFA World Cup competition.\nWinners.\nHistoric list of all \"holders of the trophy\" (winners of the FIFA World Cup).\nJules Rimet Trophy\nFIFA World Cup Trophy\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He was one of seven \"Saturday Night Live\" cast members of the first season, and he was arguably the most popular member of the \"Saturday Night Live\" ensemble. Belushi had a partnership with Dan Aykroyd; they had first met while at Chicago's the Second City comedy club, remaining together as cast members on the inaugural season of the \"Saturday Night Live\" television series.\nBorn in Chicago to Albanian-American parents, Belushi started his own comedy troupe with Tino Insana and Steve Beshekas, called \"The West Compass Trio\". Bernard Sahlins recruited him for The Second City comedy club. Once there he met Aykroyd, Brian Doyle-Murray, and Harold Ramis. In 1975, Chevy Chase and Michael O'Donoghue recommended Belushi to \"Saturday Night Live\" creator and showrunner Lorne Michaels, who accepted him as a new cast member of the show after an audition. Belushi developed a series of characters on the show that reached great success, with an imitation of Henry Kissinger and a portrayal of Ludwig van Beethoven.\nBelushi appeared in several films such as \"National Lampoon's Animal House\", \"1941\", \"The Blues Brothers\", and \"Neighbors\". He also pursued interests in music: with Aykroyd, Lou Marini, Tom Malone, Steve Cropper, Donald \"Duck\" Dunn, and Paul Shaffer, he founded The Blues Brothers, which led to the film of the same name.\nBelushi was dismissed from \"Saturday Night Live\" several times and rehired more than once. He died on March 5, 1982, at the age of 33. Cathy Smith confessed to dosing him with a lethal mixture of heroin and cocaine at the Chateau Marmont. Smith was charged with involuntary manslaughter, was convicted and sentenced to 15 months in prison. Belushi was honored with a posthumous award of the star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 2004. He was the older brother of Jim Belushi.\nEarly life and education.\nJohn Adam Belushi was born to Agnes Demetri (\"n\u00e9e\" Samaras) Belushi and Adam Anastos Belushi in Humboldt Park, Chicago. Agnes was a pharmacy worker, who was born in Ohio to Albanian immigrants from Kor\u00e7\u00eb, Albania. Adam Anastos Belushi was an Albanian immigrant from Qytez\u00eb, Albania, and was the owner of the Fair Oaks restaurant on North Avenue in Chicago.\nBelushi was raised in Wheaton along with his three siblings\u2014younger brothers Billy and Jim and sister Marian. He was Eastern Orthodox Christian, attending the Albanian Orthodox Church. He was educated at Wheaton Central High School, where he met his future wife, Judith Jacklin.\nIn 1965, Belushi formed a band, the Ravens, together with four fellow high-school students (Dick Blasucci, Michael Blasucci, Tony Pavilonis, and Phil Special). They recorded one single, \"Listen to Me Now/Jolly Green Giant\". Belushi played drums and sang vocals. The record was not successful, and the band broke up when he enrolled at the College of DuPage. He also attended the University of Wisconsin\u2013Whitewater for a year, that time being the inspiration for the \"Animal House\" scene of a motorcycle driving up stairs. Belushi then attended The University of Illinois Chicago Circle (UICC) before joining the cast of Saturday Night Live. He acquired the iconic \"College\" crewneck, worn by his character in \"Animal House\", at a print shop when visiting his brother Jim, who attended Southern Illinois University.\nCareer.\n1972\u20131975: Career beginnings: The Second City and National Lampoon.\nBelushi started his own comedy troupe in Chicago, the West Compass Trio (named after the improvisational cabaret revue Compass Players active from 1955 to 1958 in Chicago), with Tino Insana and Steve Beshekas. Their success piqued the interest of Bernard Sahlins, the founder of The Second City, who asked Belushi to join the cast. At Second City, Belushi met and began working with Harold Ramis, Joe Flaherty, and Brian Doyle-Murray.\nIn 1972, Belushi was offered a role, together with Chevy Chase and Christopher Guest, in \"National Lampoon Lemmings\", a parody of Woodstock, which played off-Broadway in 1972. Belushi and Jacklin moved to New York City. There, Belushi started working as a writer, director, and actor for \"The National Lampoon Radio Hour\", a comedy radio show that was created, produced, and written by staff from \"National Lampoon\" magazine. Cast members on the shows produced by Belushi included Ramis, Flaherty, Guest, Brian Doyle Murray, his brother Bill Murray, Gilda Radner, and Richard Belzer. In 1974, Belushi and Chevy Chase voice-acted on a Lampoon LP record, the \"Official National Lampoon Stereo Test and Demonstration Record\". During a trip to Toronto in 1974, Belushi met Dan Aykroyd. Jacklin became an associate producer for the show, and she and Belushi were married on December 31, 1976. \"The National Lampoon Show\" toured the country in 1974; it was produced by Ivan Reitman. \"Lampoon\" owner Matty Simmons was offered a TV show on NBC at this time, but he declined the offer.\n1975\u20131978: Work at \"Saturday Night Live\" and breakthrough.\nIn 1975, Chase and writer Michael O'Donoghue recommended Belushi to Lorne Michaels as a potential member for a television show Michaels was about to produce for NBC called \"NBC's Saturday Night\", later \"Saturday Night Live\". Michaels was initially reluctant, as he was not sure if Belushi's physical humor would fit with what he was envisioning, but he changed his mind after giving Belushi an audition. He appeared alongside O'Donoghue in \"Saturday Night Live\"'s first sketch (subsequently titled \"the Wolverines\") which aired on October 11, 1975.\nOver his four-year tenure at \"Saturday Night Live\" Belushi developed a series of successful characters, including the belligerent \"Saturday Night Live\" Samurai; Henry Kissinger; Ludwig van Beethoven; the Greek owner (Pete Dionisopoulos) of the Olympia Caf\u00e9; Captain James T. Kirk; and a contributor of furious opinion pieces on \"Weekend Update\", during which he coined a catchphrase, \"But N-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O!\" With Aykroyd, Belushi created Jake and Elwood, the Blues Brothers. Originally intended to warm up the studio audience before broadcasts of \"Saturday Night Live\", the Blues Brothers were eventually featured as musical guests. Belushi also reprised his Lemmings imitation of Joe Cocker. Cocker himself joined Belushi in 1976 to sing \"Feelin' Alright?\" together.\nLike many other \"Saturday Night Live\" cast members and writers, Belushi was a recreational drug user. He attended concerts including Fleetwood Mac, Meat Loaf, Kiss, The Dead Boys, Warren Zevon, The Grateful Dead, and The Allman Brothers. In 1990, Michaels remembered him as a loyal trouper, to writers, a team player, yet he was fired and rehired at \"Saturday Night Live\".\nIn \"Rolling Stone\"'s February 2015 appraisal of all 141 \"Saturday Night Live\" cast members, Belushi received their top ranking. \"Belushi was the 'live' in \"Saturday Night Live\"\", they wrote, \"the one who made the show happen on the edge\u2026 Nobody embodied the highs and lows of \"Saturday Night Live\" like Belushi.\"\n1978\u20131982: Film debut, established actor and musician, and final years.\nIn 1978, Belushi performed in the films \"Old Boyfriends\" (directed by Joan Tewkesbury), \"Goin' South\" (directed by Jack Nicholson), and \"National Lampoon's Animal House\" (directed by John Landis). Upon its initial release, \"Animal House\" received generally mixed reviews from critics, but \"Time\" magazine and Roger Ebert proclaimed it one of the year's best movies. Filmed at a cost of $2.8million, it is one of the most profitable movies of all time, garnering an estimated gross of more than $141million in the form of theatrical rentals and home video, not including merchandising. \"Animal House\" was written by Doug Kenney, Harold Ramis, and Chris Miller, and followed in the tradition of the Marx Brothers films that featured subversive and satirical plots that took on traditional institutions. Hollywood studios tried to copy the film's success without the satire, resulting in a string of \"nerds vs. jocks\" films in the 1980s with cheap sight gags involving nudity and gross-out humor.\nFollowing the success of the Blues Brothers on \"Saturday Night Live\", Belushi and Aykroyd, with the help of pianist-arranger Paul Shaffer, assembled studio talent forming a proper band. \"Saturday Night Live\" saxophonist \"Blue\" Lou Marini and trombonist-saxophonist Tom Malone, who had previously played in Blood, Sweat &amp; Tears were there. At Shaffer's suggestion, guitarist Steve Cropper and bassist Donald \"Duck\" Dunn, the powerhouse combo from Booker T and the M.G.'s, who played on dozens of hits from Memphis's Stax Records during the 1960s, were signed as well. In 1978 the Blues Brothers released their debut album, \"Briefcase Full of Blues\", with Atlantic Records. The album reached number 1 on the Billboard 200 and went double platinum. Two singles were released: \"Rubber Biscuit\", which reached number 37 on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100, and \"Soul Man\", which reached number 14.\nIn 1979, Belushi along with Aykroyd left \"Saturday Night Live\". They filmed \"The Blues Brothers\" movie, which conflicted with the schedule of \"Saturday Night Live\". Michaels also decided to leave at the end of his contract. NBC's pressure to use recurring characters was also a factor in their decision. Belushi and Aykroyd made two movies together after leaving: \"Neighbors\" (directed by John Avildsen), and most notably \"The Blues Brothers\" (directed by John Landis). Released in the U.S. on June 20, 1980, \"The Blues Brothers\" received generally negative reviews. It earned just under $5million in its opening weekend, and went on to gross $115.2million in theaters worldwide before its release on home video. The Blues Brothers band toured to promote the film, which led to a third album (and second live album), \"Made in America\", recorded at the Universal Amphitheatre in 1980. The track \"Who's Making Love\" peaked at number 39.\nThe only film Belushi made without Aykroyd following their departure from \"Saturday Night Live\" was the romantic comedy \"Continental Divide\" (directed by Michael Apted). Released in September 1981, it starred Belushi as Chicago hometown hero writer Ernie Souchack (loosely based on newspaper columnist and long-time family friend Mike Royko), who gets an assignment researching a scientist (played by Blair Brown) who studies birds of prey in the remote Rocky Mountains.\nBy 1981, Belushi had become a fan and advocate of the punk rock band Fear after seeing them perform in several after-hours New York City bars and brought them to Cherokee Studios to record songs for the soundtrack of \"Neighbors\". Blues Brothers band member Tom Scott, along with producing partner and Cherokee owner Bruce Robb, initially helped with the session, but later pulled out due to conflicts with Belushi. The session was eventually produced by Cropper. The producers of \"Neighbors\" refused to use the song in the movie. As penance for the refusal, Belushi, along with O'Donoghue and \"Saturday Night Live\" writer Nelson Lyon, booked Fear to play \"Saturday Night Live\"'s Halloween broadcast on October 31, 1981 (doing so by agreeing to make a cameo in the episode for free; indeed, he makes a silent cameo in the cold opening of the episode, in what was ultimately his last appearance on the show during his lifetime); the telecast of the performance featured then-novel moshing and stage diving, and was cut short by NBC due to the band's profanity. The \"New York Post\" published an account of these and other sensationalistic details of the event the following day.\nUp to his death, Belushi was pursuing movie projects, including an ABSCAM-related caper called \"Moon Over Miami\", to be directed by Louis Malle; and a diamond-smuggling caper called \"Noble Rot\" with Jay Sandrich, based on a script he adapted and rewrote with former \"Saturday Night Live\" writer Don Novello. However, Paramount Studios offered to produce \"Noble Rot\" only if Belushi starred in \"The Joy of Sex\", which would have featured him in a diaper. Aykroyd advised him to turn down \"The Joy of Sex\" and return to the East Coast, where Aykroyd was writing \"Ghostbusters\". Belushi also talked about producing a film in a \"High Times\" tribute article from 1982: \"Belushi wanted to give these daring captains courageous of consciousness the credit they deserved, he told me. He wanted to star in a major marijuana movie to be called \"Kingpin\". He wanted to play the title role.\"\nBelushi made a \"guest-star appearance\" on an episode of the television series \"Police Squad!\" (1982). Each opening of the show featured a running gag that featured the guest star dying right away. Belushi died shortly before the episode was to air. The scene was cut and replaced by a segment with William Conrad.\nDrug use and death.\nBelushi had health issues in the early to mid 1970s due to his drug use. Cocaine was frequently used by the cast and writers of \"Saturday Night Live\", but Belushi's use quickly got out of control and he was temporarily banned from the \"Saturday Night Live\" set. Belushi was aware of warnings that he was headed for an early death, warnings that eventually were mentioned in the 1978 short film \"Don't Look Back in Anger,\" in which Belushi ironically is the last surviving member of the cast and remarks \"They all thought I\u2019d be the first one to go. I was one of those \u2018live fast, die young, leave a good-looking corpse\u2019 types, you know?\" During the production of \"The Blues Brothers,\" director John Landis confronted Belushi in his trailer after finding a stash of cocaine. Belushi tearfully admitted his addiction during the argument. Belushi was also frequently late for his call times and would delay shooting by wandering off set. The production hired Smokey Wendell to prevent Belushi from accessing more drugs. He managed to quit his habit during the production of \"Continental Divide\", but severely relapsed during the production of \"Neighbors\".\nA few months after the filming on \"Neighbors\" ended, on the evening of February 28, 1982, he checked in to a bungalow at the Chateau Marmont in Los Angeles. For several days, he frequented various nightclubs on the Sunset Strip and Santa Monica Boulevard.\nOn March 4, 1982, Belushi visited the Los Angeles office of his long-time manager Bernie Brillstein and asked him for money. Brillstein declined, suspecting that Belushi wanted more drugs. Later that day, Belushi returned and again asked for money while Brillstein was in a meeting. Brillstein was reluctant to rebuke Belushi in front of the other person and gave him the money. In the early morning hours of March 5, 1982, Belushi, while in his Chateau Marmont bungalow, was visited separately by friends Robin Williams and Robert De Niro, as well as Cathy Smith.\nAround noon on March 5, 1982, Belushi's fitness trainer, Bill Wallace, found Belushi dead at the Chateau Marmont bungalow.\nDuring a preliminary hearing held in September 1985, two pathologists testified that Belushi's cause of death was due to an overdose from cocaine and heroin.\nCathy Smith was arrested by the Los Angeles Police Department on March 5, 1982, for possession of narcotics. This arrest was not in relation to Belushi's death. Later in 1982, \"Rolling Stone\" magazine described the circumstances of her arrest: \"On the afternoon of March 5th, Cathy Evelyn Smith had appeared driving the wrong way into the one-way exit of the Chateau Marmont Hotel on Sunset Strip behind the wheel of John Belushi's rented red Mercedes\u2026 At that moment, a hundred feet away, Belushi lay naked and dead on the floor of his $200-a-day bungalow. The police who had cordoned off the area were reflexively insisting it had been 'death from natural causes'.\" The LAPD released Smith after questioning.\nIn an interview with the \"National Enquirer\" in May 1982, Smith admitted that she had been with Belushi at the Chateau Marmont on the night of his death. After the appearance of the \"Enquirer\" article, Smith was extradited from Canada, and charged with second-degree murder. The case was delayed for four years while her lawyers negotiated. Smith pled no contest on June 11, 1986, to involuntary manslaughter and three counts of furnishing and administering controlled substances to Belushi in the hours before he was found dead. She served fifteen months in prison at Chino, California Institution for Women.\nBelushi's funeral was conducted by an Albanian Orthodox priest.\nBurial.\nBelushi was interred at Abel's Hill Cemetery in Chilmark, Massachusetts, on Martha's Vineyard. Belushi's tombstone has a skull and crossbones with the inscription, \"I may be gone but Rock and Roll lives on.\"\nAfter the success of \"The Blues Brothers\", his fame further escalated after his death. Members of his family, along with Chilmark officials, gradually became more concerned over his gravesite becoming a tourist attraction like that of Jim Morrison. Reports increased of excess noise, damaging grass and disturbing the peace of others buried there, along with fans paying bizarre tributes by littering his gravesite with liquor bottles, beer cans, and other paraphernalia. His widow arranged to have him reinterred in an unmarked grave near the original site. The tombstone of Belushi's mother at Elmwood Cemetery (River Grove, Illinois), has Belushi's name inscribed on it and thus serves as a cenotaph.\nBelushi was scheduled to present the Best Visual Effects Oscar at the 1982 Academy Awards with Dan Aykroyd. Aykroyd presented the award alone, and stated from the lectern: \"My partner, he would have loved to have been here tonight to present this award, since he was somewhat of a visual effect himself.\"\nTributes, legacy, and popular culture.\nDuring the first live \"Saturday Night Live\" episode following Belushi's death with host Robert Urich and musical guest Mink DeVille, airing live on March 20, 1982, cast member Brian Doyle-Murray gave a tribute to him. During the preproduction of \"Ghostbusters\", Reitman remarked that Slimer bore a resemblance to Belushi's character Bluto from \"Animal House\". Since then, Slimer has been described as \"the ghost of John Belushi\" by Aykroyd in many interviews.\nBelushi's life was detailed in 3 books: the 1984 biography \"Wired: The Short Life and Fast Times of John Belushi\" by Bob Woodward, the accuracy of which has been questioned by journalists and by people close to Belushi, and the 1990 memoir \"Samurai Widow\" by his widow Judith. Woodward's book was adapted into a film of the same name in 1989, which was denounced by Aykroyd and Judith, and was given poor reviews by critics. Belushi's career and death were prominently featured in the 1999 memoir of his manager Bernie Brillstein, who wrote that he was haunted by the comedian's death. He wrote that he learned how to better deal with clients. In 2005 Tanner Colby produced , a collection of first-person interviews and photographs of Belushi's life, written in collaboration with Judith Belushi, his widow.\nEddie Money wrote \"Passing by the Graveyard (Song for John B.)\", from his 1982 album \"No Control\", in tribute to Belushi. The two became friends after Money was a musical guest on \"Saturday Night Live\" during the show's third season. The thrash metal group Anthrax penned a song about Belushi on their 1987 album \"Among the Living\", titled \"Efilnikufesin (N.F.L.)\". Polish rock band Lady Pank recorded a song \"John Belushi\" for their 1988 album \"Tacy sami\", with references to his Albanian ancestry.\nBelushi was portrayed in biographical films by actors Tyler Labine, Michael Chiklis and John Gemberling. Chris Farley, who was heavily influenced by Belushi, died in 1997 at age 33 due to a drug overdose, which has fueled many comparisons between Belushi and Farley.\nIn 2004, Belushi was posthumously inducted into the Hollywood Walk of Fame with a motion pictures star located at 6355 Hollywood Boulevard. In 2006, Biography Channel aired an episode of \"Final 24\", a documentary following Belushi during the last 24 hours leading to his death. Four years later, Biography aired a full documentary of Belushi's life. In 2015, Belushi was ranked by \"Rolling Stone\" as the greatest \"Saturday Night Live\" cast member of all time.\nBelushi's widow later remarried and became Judith Jacklin Belushi Pisano. However, she and her second husband, Victor Pisano, divorced in 2010.\n\"Saturday Night Live\" castmate Jane Curtin, who appeared on \"The Oprah Winfrey Show\" in 2011, stated that Belushi was a misogynist who would deliberately sabotage the work of female writers and comics while working on the show: \"So you'd go to a table read, and if a woman writer had written a piece for John, he would not read it in his full voice. He felt as though it was his duty to sabotage pieces written by women.\" \"Saturday Night Live\" writer Anne Beatts suggested that because she was writing a book with his wife at the time, Belushi was frustrated with them spending more time on the book than with him. He complained to Michaels about Beatts and Rosie Shuster. Judith said that Belushi was a \"Women's Libber\" and did not hate women.\nJudith, who worked to keep Belushi's legacy alive and who was credited for her role in assisting Belushi and Dan Aykroyd with \"The Blues Brothers\", died in July 2024.\nAngus Stone, also known as Dope Lemon, released a song called \"John Belushi\" in his honor.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Though his family originally lived in Hamburg, Jacob and his brother were both born in Spain. At some point in time, his family moved to Amsterdam where he studied at the \"De los Pintos\" rabbinical academy in Rotterdam. In 1655, he was appointed \"hakham\" of that city. On 3 May 1655 Abendana delivered a famous memorial sermon on the Cordovan martyrs Marranos Nunez and Almeyda Bernal who had been burned at the stake.\nSeveral years later, with his brother, Isaac, Jacob published the Bible commentary \"Miklal Yofi\" by Solomon ben Melekh which included his own commentary, \"Lekket Shikchah\" (Gleanings), on the Pentateuch, the Book of Joshua, and part of the Book of Judges. This was published by subscription in Amsterdam in 1660 with a second edition in 1685.\nHaving gone to Leiden seeking subscribers, Jacob met Antonius Hulsius whom he helped in his studies. Hulsius tried to convert Abendana to Christianity which began a lifelong correspondence between the two. The Abendana brothers similarly impressed other Christian scholars, such as Johannes Buxtorf (Basel), Johann Coccejus (Leyden), and Jacob Golius (Leyden).\nWith Hulsius, Abendana entered into a polemical discussion of Biblical verse Haggai 2:9, which Hulsius attempted to prove was a reference to the Church. The debate lasted via correspondence from 24 September 1659 to 16 June 1660. Abendana responded with a Spanish translation of Rabbi Judah Halevi's \"Kuzari\"in 1663. Hulsius eventually published the correspondence between the two in 1669.\nIn 1675, Abendana addressed the community at the dedication of the new synagogue in Amsterdam. Five years later, in 1680, he was brought to London to succeed Joshua da Silva as \"hakham\" of London where he served for 15 years as the hakham of the Bevis Marks Synagogue in London. Over the following years, he completed a Spanish-language translation of the Mishnah, along with the commentaries of Maimonides and Obadiah of Bertinoro. The work was frequently cited by Christian theologians, though it was never published. Jacob Abendana died in London in 1685 and was buried in the Portuguese cemetery at Mile End.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The JVM is detailed by a specification that formally describes what is required in a JVM implementation. Having a specification ensures interoperability of Java programs across different implementations so that program authors using the Java Development Kit (JDK) need not worry about idiosyncrasies of the underlying hardware platform.\nThe JVM reference implementation is developed by the OpenJDK project as open source code and includes a JIT compiler called HotSpot. The commercially supported Java releases available from Oracle are based on the OpenJDK runtime. Eclipse OpenJ9 is another open source JVM for OpenJDK.\nJVM specification.\nThe Java virtual machine is an abstract (virtual) computer defined by a specification. It is a part of the Java runtime environment. The garbage collection algorithm used and any internal optimization of the Java virtual machine instructions (their translation into machine code) are not specified. The main reason for this omission is to not unnecessarily constrain implementers. Any Java application can be run only inside some concrete implementation of the abstract specification of the Java virtual machine.\nStarting with Java Platform, Standard Edition (J2SE) 5.0, changes to the JVM specification have been developed under the Java Community Process as JSR 924. As of 2006[ [update]], changes to the specification to support changes proposed to the class file format (JSR 202) are being done as a maintenance release of JSR 924. The specification for the JVM was published as the \"blue book\", whose preface states:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;We intend that this specification should sufficiently document the Java Virtual Machine to make possible compatible clean-room implementations. Oracle provides tests that verify the proper operation of implementations of the Java Virtual Machine.\nThe most commonly used Java virtual machine is Oracle's HotSpot.\nOracle owns the Java trademark and may allow its use to certify implementation suites as fully compatible with Oracle's specification.\nGarbage collectors.\nGarbage collectors available in Java OpenJDKs virtual machine (JVM) include:\nJava's design philosophy revolves around the assumption of a garbage collector. Unlike languages such as C++ and Rust, deterministic memory management through a codice_1 keyword (as in C++) is not possible. Even introducing such a feature is not possible, due to a lack of ownership, aside from using sun.misc.Unsafe or through java.lang.foreign to allocate/deallocate memory outside the Java heap. Due to Java primarily using heap-based allocation, objects are stored as references, and deletion would result in dangling pointers.\nFoo a = new Foo();\nFoo b = a;\ndelete a;\nSystem.out.println(b);\nVirtual machine architecture.\nThe JVM operates on specific types of data as specified in Java Virtual Machine specifications. The data types can be divided into primitive types (integer and floating-point values) and reference types. codice_2 and codice_3 types, which are 64-bits, are supported natively, but consume two units of storage in a frame's local variables or operand stack, since each unit is 32 bits. codice_4, codice_5, codice_6, and codice_7 types are all sign-extended (except codice_7 which is zero-extended) and operated on as 32-bit integers, the same as codice_9 types. The smaller types only have a few type-specific instructions for loading, storing, and type conversion. codice_4 is operated on as 8-bit codice_5 values, with 0 representing codice_12 and 1 representing codice_13. (Although codice_4 has been treated as a type since \"The Java Virtual Machine Specification, Second Edition\" clarified this issue, in compiled and executed code there is little difference between a codice_4 and a codice_5 except for name mangling in method signatures and the type of boolean arrays. codice_4s in method signatures are mangled as codice_18 while codice_5s are mangled as codice_20. Boolean arrays carry the type codice_21 but use 8 bits per element, and the JVM has no built-in capability to pack booleans into a bit array, so except for the type they perform and behave the same as codice_5 arrays. In all other uses, the codice_4 type is effectively unknown to the JVM as all instructions to operate on booleans are also used to operate on codice_5s.)\nThe JVM has a garbage-collected heap for storing objects and arrays. Code, constants, and other class data are stored in the \"method area\". The method area is logically part of the heap, but implementations may treat the method area separately from the heap, and for example might not garbage collect it. Each JVM thread also has its own call stack (called a \"Java Virtual Machine stack\" for clarity), which stores frames. A new frame is created each time a method is called, and the frame is destroyed when that method exits.\nEach frame provides an \"operand stack\" and an array of \"local variables\". The operand stack is used for operands to run computations and for receiving the return value of a called method, while local variables serve the same purpose as registers and are also used to pass method arguments. Thus, the JVM is both a stack machine and a register machine. In practice, HotSpot eliminates every stack besides the native thread/call stack even when running in Interpreted mode, as its Templating Interpreter technically functions as a compiler.\nThe JVM uses references and stack/array indexes to address data; it does not use byte addressing like most physical machines do, so it does not neatly fit the usual categorization of 32-bit or 64-bit machines. In one sense, it could be classified as a 32-bit machine, since this is the size of the largest value it natively stores: a 32-bit integer or floating-point value or a 32-bit reference. Because a reference is 32 bits, each program is limited to at most 232 unique references and therefore at most 232 objects. However, each object can be more than one byte large, and potentially \"very\" large; the largest possible object is an array of codice_2 of length 231 - 1 which would consume 16 GiB of memory, and there could potentially be 232 of these if there were enough memory available. This results in upper bounds that are more comparable to a typical 64-bit byte-addressable machine. A JVM implementation can be designed to run on a processor that natively uses any bit width as long as it correctly implements the integer (8-, 16-, 32-, and 64-bit) and floating-point (32- and 64-bit) math that the JVM requires. Depending on the method used to implement references (native pointers, compressed pointers, or an indirection table), this can limit the number of objects to less than the theoretical maximum. An implementation of the JVM on a 64-bit platform has access to a much larger address space than one on a 32-bit platform, which allows for a much larger heap size and an increased maximum number of threads, which is needed for certain kinds of large applications; however, there can be a performance hit from using a 64-bit implementation compared to a 32-bit implementation.\nJVM languages.\nA JVM language is any language with functionality that can be expressed in terms of a valid class file which can be hosted by the Java Virtual Machine. A class file contains Java Virtual Machine instructions (Java byte code) and a symbol table, as well as other ancillary information. The class file format is the hardware- and operating system-independent binary format used to represent compiled classes and interfaces.\nThere are several JVM languages, both old languages ported to JVM and completely new languages. JRuby and Jython are perhaps the most well-known ports of existing languages, i.e. Ruby and Python respectively. Of the new languages that have been created from scratch to compile to Java bytecode, Clojure, Groovy, Scala and Kotlin may be the most popular ones. A notable feature with the JVM languages is that they are compatible with each other, so that, for example, Scala libraries can be used with Java programs and vice versa.\nJava 7 JVM implements \"JSR 292: Supporting Dynamically Typed Languages\" on the Java Platform, a new feature which supports dynamically typed languages in the JVM. This feature is developed within the Da Vinci Machine project whose mission is to extend the JVM so that it supports languages other than Java.\nClass loader.\nOne of the organizational units of JVM byte code is a class. A class loader implementation must be able to recognize and load anything that conforms to the Java class file format. Any implementation is free to recognize other binary forms besides \"class\" files, but it must recognize \"class\" files.\nThe class loader performs three basic activities in this strict order:\nIn general, there are three types of class loader: bootstrap class loader, extension class loader and System / Application class loader.\nEvery Java virtual machine implementation must have a bootstrap class loader that is capable of loading trusted classes, as well as an extension class loader or application class loader. The Java virtual machine specification does not specify how a class loader should locate classes.\nBytecode instructions.\nThe JVM has instructions for the following groups of tasks:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Hlist/styles.css\"/&gt;* Load and store\nThe aim is binary compatibility. Each particular host operating system needs its own implementation of the JVM and runtime. These JVMs interpret the bytecode semantically the same way, but the actual implementation may be different. More complex than just emulating bytecode is compatibly and efficiently implementing the Java core API that must be mapped to each host operating system.\nThese instructions operate on a set of common &lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Visible anchor/styles.css\" /&gt;abstracted data types rather the native data types of any specific instruction set architecture.\nBytecode verifier.\nA basic philosophy of Java is that it is inherently safe from the standpoint that no user program can crash the host machine or otherwise interfere inappropriately with other operations on the host machine, and that it is possible to protect certain methods and data structures belonging to trusted code from access or corruption by untrusted code executing within the same JVM. Furthermore, common programmer errors that often led to data corruption or unpredictable behavior such as accessing off the end of an array or using an uninitialized pointer are not allowed to occur. Several features of Java combine to provide this safety, including the class model, the garbage-collected heap, and the verifier.\nThe JVM verifies all bytecode before it is executed. This verification consists primarily of three types of checks:\nThe first two of these checks take place primarily during the verification step that occurs when a class is loaded and made eligible for use. The third is primarily performed dynamically, when data items or methods of a class are first accessed by another class.\nThe verifier permits only some bytecode sequences in valid programs, e.g. a jump (branch) instruction can only target an instruction within the same method. Furthermore, the verifier ensures that any given instruction operates on a fixed stack location, allowing the JIT compiler to transform stack accesses into fixed register accesses. Because of this, that the JVM is a stack architecture does not imply a speed penalty for emulation on register-based architectures when using a JIT compiler. In the face of the code-verified JVM architecture, it makes no difference to a JIT compiler whether it gets named imaginary registers or imaginary stack positions that must be allocated to the target architecture's registers. In fact, code verification makes the JVM different from a classic stack architecture, of which efficient emulation with a JIT compiler is more complicated and typically carried out by a slower interpreter. Additionally, the Interpreter used by the default JVM is a special type known as a Template Interpreter, which translates bytecode directly to native, register based machine language rather than emulate a stack like a typical interpreter. In many aspects the HotSpot Interpreter can be considered a JIT compiler rather than a true interpreter, meaning the stack architecture that the bytecode targets is not actually used in the implementation, but merely a specification for the intermediate representation that can well be implemented in a register based architecture. Another instance of a stack architecture being merely a specification and implemented in a register based virtual machine is the Common Language Runtime.\nThe original specification for the bytecode verifier used natural language that was incomplete or incorrect in some respects. A number of attempts have been made to specify the JVM as a formal system. By doing this, the security of current JVM implementations can more thoroughly be analyzed, and potential security exploits prevented. It will also be possible to optimize the JVM by skipping unnecessary safety checks, if the application being run is proven to be safe.\nSecure execution of remote code.\nA virtual machine architecture allows very fine-grained control over the actions that code within the machine is permitted to take. It assumes the code is \"semantically\" correct, that is, it successfully passed the (formal) bytecode verifier process, materialized by a tool, possibly off-board the virtual machine. This is designed to allow safe execution of untrusted code from remote sources, a model used by Java applets, and other secure code downloads. Once bytecode-verified, the downloaded code runs in a restricted \"sandbox\", which is designed to protect the user from misbehaving or malicious code. As an addition to the bytecode verification process, publishers can purchase a certificate with which to digitally sign applets as safe, giving them permission to ask the user to break out of the sandbox and access the local file system, clipboard, execute external pieces of software, or network.\nFormal proof of bytecode verifiers have been done by the Javacard industry (Formal Development of an Embedded Verifier for Java Card Byte Code)\nBytecode interpreter and Just-in-Time compiler.\nFor each hardware architecture a different Java bytecode interpreter is needed. When a computer has a Java bytecode interpreter, it can run any Java bytecode program, and the same program can be run on any computer that has such an interpreter.\nWhen Java bytecode is executed by an interpreter, the execution will always be slower than the execution of the same program compiled into native machine language. This problem is mitigated by just-in-time (JIT) compilers for executing Java bytecode. A JIT compiler may translate Java bytecode into native machine language while executing the program. The translated parts of the program can then be executed much more quickly than they could be interpreted. This technique gets applied to those parts of a program frequently executed. This way a JIT compiler can significantly speed up the overall execution time.\nThere is no necessary connection between the Java programming language and Java bytecode. A program written in Java can be compiled directly into the machine language of a real computer and programs written in other languages than Java can be compiled into Java bytecode.\nJava bytecode is intended to be platform-independent and secure. Some JVM implementations do not include an interpreter, but consist only of a just-in-time compiler.\nJava Native Interface.\nThe Java Native Interface (or Native Method Interface) is a foreign function interface (non-Java) programming framework which enables Java code running in a Java virtual machine (JVM) to call and be called by native applications (programs specific to a hardware and operating system platform) and libraries written in other languages such as C, C++ and assembly. Although, it's a powerful resource, it isn't part of Java SE.\nJava 22 introduces the Foreign Function and Memory API, which can be seen as the successor to Java Native Interface.\nNative methods are enable by JNI to handle situations when an application cannot be written entirely in the Java programming language, e.g. when the standard Java class library does not support the platform-specific features or program library. \nThe JNI framework lets a native method use Java objects in the same way that Java code uses these objects. A native method can create Java objects and then inspect and use these objects to perform its tasks. A native method can also inspect and use objects created by Java application code.\nJNI also allows direct access to assembly code, without even going through a C bridge.[3] Accessing Java applications from assembly is possible in the same way.\nJVM in the web browser.\nAt the start of the Java platform's lifetime, the JVM was marketed as a web technology for creating Rich Web Applications. As of 2018[ [update]], most web browsers and operating systems bundling web browsers do not ship with a Java plug-in, nor do they permit side-loading any non-Flash plug-in. The Java browser plugin was deprecated in JDK 9.\nThe NPAPI Java browser plug-in was designed to allow the JVM to execute so-called Java applets embedded into HTML pages. For browsers with the plug-in installed, the applet is allowed to draw into a rectangular region on the page assigned to it. Because the plug-in includes a JVM, Java applets are not restricted to the Java programming language; any language targeting the JVM may run in the plug-in. A restricted set of APIs allow applets access to the user's microphone or 3D acceleration, although applets are not able to modify the page outside its rectangular region. Adobe Flash Player, the main competing technology, works in the same way in this respect.\nAs of June 2015[ [update]] according to W3Techs, Java applet and Silverlight use had fallen to 0.1% each for all web sites, while Flash had fallen to 10.8%.\nJavaScript JVMs and interpreters.\nSince May 2016, JavaPoly allows users to import unmodified Java libraries, and invoke them directly from JavaScript. JavaPoly allows websites to use unmodified Java libraries, even if the user does not have Java installed on their computer.\nTranspilation to JavaScript.\nWith the continuing improvements in JavaScript execution speed, combined with the increased use of mobile devices whose web browsers do not implement support for plugins, there are efforts to target those users through transpilation to JavaScript. It is possible to either transpile the source code or JVM bytecode to JavaScript.\nCompiling the JVM bytecode, which is universal across JVM languages, allows building upon the language's existing compiler to bytecode. The main JVM bytecode to JavaScript transpilers are TeaVM, the compiler contained in Dragome Web SDK, Bck2Brwsr, and j2js-compiler.\nLeading transpilers from JVM languages to JavaScript include the Java-to-JavaScript transpiler contained in Google Web Toolkit, J2CL, Clojurescript (Clojure), GrooScript (Apache Groovy), Scala.js (Scala) and others.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

His Edinburgh practice became one of the most successful medical practices in Scotland. The \"Chambers Biographical Dictionary\" says of him that after James Gregory's death, he was \"recognized as the first consulting physician in Scotland\". As surgeon to The Royal Public Dispensary and the New Town Dispensary he provided free medical care for the poor of the town and taught medical students and apprentices. He published extensively on medical topics and latterly on metaphysics morality and religion. A devout Christian, he gave financial support to missionary work. Abercrombie was awarded the honorary degree of MD from the University of Oxford, was elected Rector of Marischal College and University, Aberdeen and appointed Physician to the King in Scotland.\nEarly life.\nHe was born in Aberdeen the eldest son of Rev George Abercrombie (1713\u20131790), the minister of East Church, Aberdeen, and his second wife Barbara Morice (died 1824). His father was to have a profound influence on his character and beliefs. After schooling at Aberdeen Grammar School he studied at Marischal College, in Aberdeen, where he graduated Master of Arts (MA) at the age of 15. He went on to study medicine at the University of Edinburgh obtaining his doctorate MD in 1803.\nMedical career.\nAfter graduating he went for further study at St George's Hospital in London and, returning to Edinburgh, set up in practice at 8 Nicolson Street, next to the Edinburgh Riding School, which in 1832 was to become the site of the Playfair building of the present Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh (RCSEd). In 1804 he became a Fellow of the RCSEd. His general practice rapidly became popular and in 1805 he became surgeon to the Royal. Public Dispensary in nearby Richmond Street. Here he provided free medical care for the poor of the locality and gave instruction to medical student and apprentices. By dividing the city into geographical sectors and assigning his trainees to different sectors he began a systematic training system for these trainees. In 1816 he was appointed surgeon to the newly established New Town Dispensary. From the outset he kept detailed notes on all of his patients, an unusual practice at that time. These were to form the basis for his many clinical publications, which further enhanced his reputation. From 1816 he published various papers in the \"Edinburgh Medical and Surgical Journal\", which formed the basis of his more extensive works: \"Pathological and Practical Researches on Diseases of the Brain and Spinal Cord\", regarded as the first textbook in neuropathology, and \"Researches on the Diseases of the Intestinal Canal, Liver and other Viscera of the Abdomen\", both published in 1828. In the latter book described for the first time the symptoms and signs of perforated duodenal ulcer. This was at a time when, it was difficult for physicians to correlate clinical features with pathology. Abercrombie's gave the first ever description of the clinical features of perforated duodenal ulcer confirmed by the post-mortem. The specimen showing the perforated ulcer was placed in Surgeons\u2019 Hall Museum where it is on display to this day\nIn 1821 he was unsuccessful in his application for the Chair of the Practice of Physic at the University of Edinburgh. Thereafter he devoted himself to consulting medical practice. He became a Licentiate of the Royal College of Physicians of Edinburgh in 1823 and a Fellow of the College the following year.\nIn later years he wrote a series of philosophical speculations, and in 1830 he published his \"Inquiries concerning the Intellectual Powers and the Investigation of Truth\", which was followed in 1833 by a sequel, \"The Philosophy of the Moral Feelings\". Both works achieved wide popularity at the time of their publication. The Inquiries (1830) has been widely cited in treatises on the law of evidence, due to its discussion of probability, (the sources of) certainty, and (doubts regarding) testimony.\nAn elder of the Church of Scotland, he also wrote \"The man of faith: or the harmony of Christian faith and Christian character\" (1835), which he distributed freely. \nAbercrombie was a founder member in 1841of the Edinburgh Association for sending Medical Aid for Foreign Countries, which became the Edinburgh Medical Missionary Society, and he gave financial support to its work.\nThe year after his death his \"Essays\" (1845) on Christian ethics were published.\nHonours and awards.\nHe was President of the Edinburgh Medico-Chirurgical Society for four years from 1829. In 1831 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh, his proposer being Thomas Charles Hope, and served as Vice-President of the Society from 1835 to 1844. The University of Oxford awarded him the honorary degree of MD (Oxon). This was a rare honour as the only other recipient in the previous 50 years was Edward Jenner. He was elected Lord Rector of Marischal College and University, Aberdeen. He became a member of the French Acad\u00e9mie Nationale de M\u00e9decine.\nPersonal life.\nIn 1810 he was living at 43 York Place, Edinburgh. In 1831, while treating his colleague James Crawford Gregory, he contracted and recovered from typhus. In 1841, he was partially paralysed, but was nevertheless able to return to his medical practice.\nHe died suddenly while entering his carriage at the front of his home, 19 York Place, Edinburgh, 14 November 1844. An autopsy showed that the cause of death was ruptured coronary artery. The pathologist, Adam Hunter, speculated that his death had been brought about by excessive bloodletting. He is buried against the east wall of St Cuthberts Churchyard adjacent to the gateway into Princes Street Gardens.\nUpon his death, his daughters donated his Abercrombie's library of circa 1000 volumes to the Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh.\nArtistic recognition.\nA bust of Abercrombie by John Steell is held at the Royal College of Physicians of Edinburgh. A portrait by Benjamin Walsh, painted in 1819, hangs in the RCSEd.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nExternal links.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Sister-inline/styles.css\"/&gt; Media related to at Wikimedia Commons"}
{"id": "16391", "revid": "35936988", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=16391", "title": "Judgement of Paris", "text": "Story from Greek mythology\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nThe Judgement of Paris is a story from Greek mythology, which was one of the events that led up to the Trojan War, and in later versions to the foundation of Rome.\nEris, the goddess of discord, was not invited to the wedding of Peleus and Thetis. In revenge, she brought a golden apple, inscribed, \"To the fairest one\", which she threw into the wedding. Three guests, Hera, Athena and Aphrodite, after some disputation, agreed to have Paris of Troy choose the fairest one. Paris chose Aphrodite, she having bribed him with the most beautiful mortal woman in the world, Helen of Sparta, wife of Menelaus. Consequently, Paris carried Helen off to Troy, and the Greeks invaded Troy for Helen's return. Eris's Apple of Discord (or her not being invited to the wedding in the first place) was thus the instrumental \"casus belli\" of the Trojan War.\nSources of the episode.\nAs with many mythological tales, details vary depending on the source. The brief allusion to the Judgement in the \"Iliad\" (24.25\u201330) shows that the episode initiating all the subsequent action was already familiar to its audience; a fuller version was told in the \"Cypria\", a lost work of the Epic Cycle, of which only fragments (and a reliable summary) remain. The later writers Ovid (\"Heroides\" 16.71ff, 149\u2013152 and 5.35f), Lucian (\"Dialogues of the Gods\" 20), Pseudo-Apollodorus (\"Bibliotheca\", E.3.2) and Hyginus (\"Fabulae\" 92), retell the story with skeptical, ironic or popularizing agendas. It appeared wordlessly on the ivory and gold votive chest of the 7th-century BC tyrant Cypselus at Olympia, which was described by Pausanias as showing:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;... Hermes bringing to Alexander [i.e. Paris] the son of Priam the goddesses of whose beauty he is to judge, the inscription on them being: 'Here is Hermes, who is showing to Alexander, that he may arbitrate concerning their beauty, Hera, Athena and Aphrodite.\nThe subject was favoured by ancient Greek vase painters as early as the sixth century BC, and remained popular in Greek and Roman art, before enjoying a significant revival as an opportunity to show three female nudes, in the Renaissance.\nMythic narrative.\nIt is recounted that Zeus held a banquet in celebration of the marriage of Peleus and Thetis (parents of Achilles). However, Eris, goddess of discord, was not invited, for it was believed she would have made the party unpleasant for everyone. Angered by this snub, Eris arrived at the celebration with a golden apple from the Garden of the Hesperides, which she threw into the proceedings as a prize of beauty. According to some later versions, upon the apple was the inscription \"\u03ba\u03b1\u03bb\u03bb\u03af\u03c3\u03c4\u1fc3\" (\"kallist\u0113i\", \"To/for the fairest one\").\nThree goddesses claimed the apple: Hera, Athena and Aphrodite. They asked Zeus to judge which of them was fairest, and eventually he, reluctant to favour any claim himself, declared that Paris, a Trojan mortal, would judge their cases, for he had recently shown his exemplary fairness in a contest in which Ares in bull form had bested Paris's own prize bull, and the shepherd-prince had unhesitatingly awarded the prize to the god.\nWith Hermes as their guide, the three candidates bathed in the spring of Ida, then met Paris on Mount Ida. While Paris inspected them, each attempted with her powers to bribe him; Hera offered to make him king of Europe and Asia, Athena offered wisdom and skill in war, and Aphrodite, who had the Charites and the Horai to enhance her charms with flowers and song (according to a fragment of the \"Cypria\" quoted by Athenagoras of Athens), offered the world's most beautiful woman (Euripides, \"Andromache\", l.284, \"Helena\" l. 676). This was Helen of Sparta, wife of the Greek king Menelaus. Paris accepted Aphrodite's bribe and awarded the apple to her, receiving Helen as well as the enmity of the Greeks and especially of Hera. The Greeks' expedition to retrieve Helen from Paris in Troy is the mythological basis of the Trojan War. According to some stories, Helen of Troy was kidnapped by Paris and a group of Trojans; in others, she simply followed Paris willingly because she felt affection for him, too.\nAccording to a tradition suggested by Alfred J. Van Windekens, \"cow-eyed\" Hera was indeed the most beautiful, before Aphrodite showed up. However, Hera was the goddess of the marital order and of cuckolded wives, amongst other things. She was often portrayed as the shrewish, jealous wife of Zeus, who himself often escaped from her controlling ways by cheating on her with other women, mortal and immortal. She had fidelity and chastity in mind and was careful to be modest when Paris was inspecting her. Aphrodite was the goddess of sexuality, and was effortlessly more sexual and charming than any goddess. Thus, she was able to sway Paris into judging her as the fairest. Athena's beauty is rarely commented on in the myths, perhaps because Greeks held her up as an asexual being, able to \"overcome\" her \"womanly weaknesses\" to become both wise and talented in war (both considered male domains by the Greeks). Her rage at losing makes her join the Greeks in the battle against Paris's Trojans, a key event in the turning point of the war.\nIn art.\nThe subject became popular in art from the late Middle Ages onwards. All three goddesses were usually shown nude, though in ancient art only Aphrodite is ever unclothed, and not always. The opportunity for three female nudes was a large part of the attraction of the subject, commonly being used to allow a full appreciation of the female body by painting the goddesses from three different angles (often front, back, and side view). It appeared in illuminated manuscripts and was popular in decorative art, including 15th-century Italian inkstands and other works in maiolica, and \"cassoni\". As a subject for easel paintings, it was more common in Northern Europe, although Marcantonio Raimondi's engraving of c. 1515, probably based on a drawing by Raphael, and using a composition derived from a Roman sarcophagus, was a highly influential treatment, which made Paris's Phrygian cap an attribute in most later versions.\nThe subject was painted many (supposedly 23) times by Lucas Cranach the Elder, and was especially attractive to Northern Mannerist painters. Rubens painted several compositions of the subject at different points in his career. Watteau and Angelica Kauffman were among the artists who painted the subject in the 18th century. The Judgement of Paris was painted frequently by academic artists of the 19th century, and less often by their more progressive contemporaries such as Renoir and C\u00e9zanne. Later artists who have painted the subject include Andr\u00e9 Lhote, Enrique Simonet (\"El Juicio de Paris\" 1904), and Salvador Dal\u00ed.\nIvo Saliger (1939), Adolf Ziegler (1939), and Joseph Thorak (1941) also used the classic myth to propagate German renewal during the Nazi period.\nIn other media.\nThe story is the basis of an opera, \"The Judgement of Paris\", with a libretto by William Congreve, that was set to music by four composers in London, 1700\u20131701. Thomas Arne composed a highly successful score to the same libretto in 1742. The opera \"Le Cinesi\" (\"The Chinese Women\") by Christoph Willibald Gluck (1754) concludes with a ballet, \"The Judgement of Paris\", sung as a vocal quartet. Francesco Cilea's 1902 opera \"Adriana Lecouvreur\" also includes a \"Judgement of Paris\" ballet sequence.\nThe story is the basis of an earlier opera, \"Il pomo d'oro\", in a prologue and five acts by the Italian composer Antonio Cesti, with a libretto by Francesco Sbarra (1611\u20131668).\nIn Discordianism.\n\"Kallist\u0113i\" is the word of the ancient Greek language inscribed on Eris's Apple of Discord. In Greek, the word is \"\u03ba\u03b1\u03bb\u03bb\u03af\u03c3\u03c4\u1fc3\" (the dative singular of the feminine superlative of \u03ba\u03b1\u03bb\u03bf\u03c2, beautiful). Its meaning can be rendered \"to the fairest one\". \"Calliste\" (\u039a\u03b1\u03bb\u03bb\u03af\u03c3\u03c4\u03b7; Mod. Gk. \"Kallisti\") is also an ancient name for the isle of Thera.\nThe word \"Kallisti\" (Modern Greek) written on a golden apple, has become a principal symbol of Discordianism, a post-modernist religion. In non-philological texts (such as Discordian ones) the word is usually spelled as \"\u03ba\u03b1\u03bb\u03bb\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03b9\". Most versions of \"Principia Discordia\" actually spell it as \u03ba\u03b1\u03bb\u03bb\u03b9\u03c7\u03c4\u03b9, but this is definitely incorrect; in the afterword of the 1979 Loompanics edition of \"Principia\", Gregory Hill says that was because on the IBM typewriter he used, not all Greek letters coincided with Latin ones, and he didn't know enough of the letters to spot the mistake. Zeus's failure to invite Eris is referred to as \"The Original Snub\" in Discordian mythology.\nClassical literature sources.\nChronological listing of classical literature sources for The Judgement of Paris, including the Apple of Discord:\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "16392", "revid": "36867788", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=16392", "title": "Jurisdiction", "text": "Authority granted to a legal body or political leader to deal with legal matters\nJurisdiction (from Latin 'law' and 'speech' or 'declaration') is the legal term for the legal authority held by a legal entity to enact justice. Jurisdiction is rarely claimed to be complete: rather it is limited for example by geography, subject matter, or other factor. It is only within the scope (inside the limits) of such jurisdiction that, for example, the parties to a dispute have standing to bring the matter (a legal question) before a judge, who has power (or 'jurisdiction') to decide it authoritatively. \nA \"jurisdiction\" can also be understood as a category name for any separate polity legally constituted as such \u2014 for any government with legislative and other legal power over a particular territory, whether that area is a nation state or some smaller region. Thus, Australia, Arizona, North Yorkshire and New York City are each \"a jurisdiction\". In federations like the United States, jurisdiction in this polity sense applies at multiple levels (e.g., local, state, and national/federal).\nJurisdiction draws its substance from international law, conflict of laws, constitutional law, and is often thought to include the powers of the executive and legislative branches of government to pursue policies and allocate resources so as to best serve the needs of society.\nInternational dimension.\nGenerally, international laws and treaties provide agreements which nations agree to be bound to. Such agreements are not always established or maintained. Extraterritorial jurisdiction is exercised through three principles outlined in the UN charter. These are equality of states, territorial sovereignty and non-intervention. This raises questions of when can many states prescribe or enforce jurisdiction. The \"Lotus\" case establishes two key rules to the prescription and enforcement of jurisdiction. The case outlines that jurisdiction is territorial and that a state may not exercise its jurisdiction in the territory of another state unless there is a rule that permits this. On that same note, states enjoy a wide measure of discretion to prescribe jurisdiction over persons, property and acts within their own territory unless there was a rule that prohibits this.\nPolitical issue.\nSupranational organizations provide mechanisms whereby disputes between nations may be resolved through arbitration or mediation. When a country is recognized as , it is an acknowledgment by the other \"\" nations that the country has sovereignty and the right to exist.\nHowever, it is often at the discretion of each nation whether to co-operate or participate. If a nation does agree to participate in activities of the supranational bodies and accept decisions, the nation is giving up its sovereign authority and thereby allocating power to these bodies.\nInsofar as these bodies or nominated individuals may resolve disputes through judicial or quasi-judicial means, or promote treaty obligations in the nature of laws, the power ceded to these bodies cumulatively represents its own jurisdiction. But no matter how powerful each body may appear to be, the extent to which any of their judgments may be enforced, or proposed treaties and conventions may become, or remain, effective within the territorial boundaries of each nation is a political matter under the sovereign control of each nation.\nInternational and municipal.\nThe fact that international organizations, courts and tribunals have been created raises the difficult question of how to coordinate their activities with those of national courts. If the two sets of bodies do not have \"concurrent\" jurisdiction but, as in the case of the International Criminal Court (ICC), the relationship is expressly based on the principle of \"complementarity\", i.e., the international court is subsidiary or complementary to national courts, the difficulty is avoided. But if the jurisdiction claimed is concurrent or, as in the case of International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY), the international tribunal is to prevail over national courts, the problems are more difficult to resolve politically.\nThe idea of universal jurisdiction is fundamental to the operation of global organizations such as the United Nations and the International Court of Justice (ICJ), which jointly assert the benefit of maintaining legal entities with jurisdiction over a wide range of matters of significance to nations (the ICJ should not be confused with the ICC and this version of \"universal jurisdiction\" is not the same as that enacted in the War Crimes Law (Belgium), which is an assertion of extraterritorial jurisdiction that will fail to gain implementation in any other state under the standard provisions of public policy). Under Article 34 Statute of the ICJ only nations may be parties in cases before the Court and, under Article 36, the jurisdiction comprises all cases which the parties refer to it and all matters specially provided for in the Charter of the United Nations or in treaties and conventions in force. But, to invoke the jurisdiction in any given case, all the parties have to accept the prospective judgment as binding. This reduces the risk of wasting the Court's time.\nDespite the safeguards built into the constitutions of most of these organizations, courts and tribunals, the concept of universal jurisdiction is controversial among those nations which prefer unilateral to multilateral solutions through the use of executive or military authority, sometimes described as \"realpolitik\"-based diplomacy.\nWithin other international contexts, there are intergovernmental organizations such as the World Trade Organization (WTO) that have socially and economically significant dispute resolution functions but, again, even though their jurisdiction may be invoked to hear the cases, the power to enforce their decisions is at the will of the nations affected, save that the WTO is permitted to allow retaliatory action by successful nations against those nations found to be in breach of international trade law. At a regional level, groups of nations can create political and legal bodies with sometimes complicated patchworks of overlapping provisions detailing the jurisdictional relationships between the member states and providing for some degree of harmonization between their national legislative and judicial functions, for example, the European Union and African Union both have the potential to become federated nations although the political barriers to such unification in the face of entrenched nationalism will be very difficult to overcome. Each such group may form transnational institutions with declared legislative or judicial powers. For example, in Europe, the European Court of Justice has been given jurisdiction as the ultimate appellate court to the member states on issues of European law. This jurisdiction is entrenched, and its authority could only be denied by a member nation if that member nation asserts its sovereignty and withdraws from the union.\nLaw.\nThe standard treaties and conventions leave the issue of implementation to each nation, i.e. there is no general rule in international law that treaties have direct effect in municipal law, but some nations, by virtue of their membership of supranational bodies, allow the direct incorporation of rights or enact legislation to honor their international commitments. Hence, citizens in those nations can invoke the jurisdiction of local courts to enforce rights granted under international law wherever there is incorporation. If there is no direct effect or legislation, there are two theories to justify the courts incorporating international into municipal law:\nThis theory characterizes international and municipal law as a single legal system with municipal law subordinate to international law. Hence, in the Netherlands, all treaties and the orders of international organizations are effective without any action being required to convert international into municipal law. This has an interesting consequence because treaties that limit or extend the powers of the Dutch government are automatically considered a part of their constitutional law, for example, the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. In nations adopting this theory, the local courts automatically accept jurisdiction to adjudicate on lawsuits relying on international law principles.\nThis theory regards international and municipal law as separate systems so that the municipal courts can only apply international law either when it has been incorporated into municipal law or when the courts incorporate international law on their own motion. In the United Kingdom, for example, a treaty is not effective until it has been incorporated, at which time it becomes enforceable in the courts by any private citizen, where appropriate, even against the UK Government. Otherwise the courts have a discretion to apply international law where it does not conflict with statute or the common law. The constitutional principle of parliamentary supremacy permits the legislature to enact any law inconsistent with any international treaty obligations even though the government is a signatory to those treaties.\nIn the United States, the Supremacy Clause of the United States Constitution makes all treaties that have been ratified under the authority of the United States and customary international law to be a part of the \"Supreme Law of the Land\" (along with the Constitution itself and acts of Congress passed pursuant to it) (U.S. Const.art. VI Cl. 2) As such, the law of the land is binding on the federal government as well as on state and local governments. According to the Supreme Court of the United States, the treaty power authorizes Congress to legislate under the Necessary and Proper Clause in areas beyond those specifically conferred on Congress (\"Missouri v. Holland\", 252 U.S. 416 (1920)).\nInternational.\nThis concerns the relationships both between courts in different jurisdictions, and between courts within the same jurisdiction. The usual legal doctrine under which questions of jurisdiction are decided is termed .\nTo deal with the issue of forum shopping, nations are urged to adopt more positive rules on conflict of laws. The Hague Conference and other international bodies have made recommendations on jurisdictional matters, but litigants with the encouragement of lawyers on a contingent fee continue to shop for forums.\nJurisdictional principles.\nUnder international law there are different principles that are recognized to establish a state's ability to exercise criminal jurisdiction when it comes to a person. There is no hierarchy when it comes to any of the principles. States must therefore work together to solve issues of who may exercise their jurisdiction when it comes to issues of multiple principles being allowed. The principles are Territorial Principle, Nationality Principle, Passive Personality Principle, Protective Principle, Universality Principle\nTerritorial principle: This principle states that the State where the crime has been committed may exercise jurisdiction. This is one of the most straightforward and least controversial of the principles. This is also the only principle that is territorial in nature; all other forms are extraterritorial.\nNationality principle (also known as the Active Personality Principle): This principle is based around a person's nationality and allows States to exercise jurisdiction when it comes to their nationality, both within and outside the State's territory. Seeing as the territoriality principle already gives the State the right to exercise jurisdiction, this principle is primarily used as a justification for prosecuting crimes committed abroad by a States nationals. There is a growing trend to allow States to also apply this principle to permanent residents abroad as well (for example: Denmark Criminal Code (2005), sec 7; Finland Criminal Code (2015), sec 6; Iceland Criminal Code (2014), art 5; Latvia Criminal Code (2013), sec 4; Netherlands Criminal Code (2019), art 7; Norway Criminal Code (2005), sec 12; Swedish Criminal Code (1999), sec 2; Lithuania Criminal Code (2015), art 5).\nPassive Personality Principle: This principle is similar to the Nationality Principle, except you are exercising jurisdiction against a foreign national that has committed a criminal act against its own national. The idea is that a State has a duty to protect its nationals and therefore if someone harms their nationals that State has the right to prosecute the accused.\nProtective principle: This principle allows States to exercise jurisdiction when it comes to foreign nationals for acts committed outside their territory that have or are intended to have a prejudicial impact upon the State. It is especially used when it comes to matters of national security.\nUniversality principle: This is the broadest of all the principles. The basis is that a State has the right, sometimes even the obligation, to exercise jurisdiction when it comes to the most serious violations of international criminal law; for example genocide, crimes against humanity, extrajudicial executions, war crimes, torture, and forced disappearances. This principle also goes further than the other principles as there is attached to it the obligation to either prosecute the accused or extradite them to a State that will, known as .\nSupranational.\nAt a supranational level, countries have adopted a range of treaty and convention obligations to relate the right of individual litigants to invoke the jurisdiction of national courts and to enforce the judgments obtained. For example, the member nations of the EEC signed the Brussels Convention in 1968 and, subject to amendments as new nations joined, it represents the default law for all twenty-seven Member States of what is now termed the European Union on the relationships between the courts in the different countries. In addition, the Lugano Convention (1988) binds the European Union and the European Free Trade Association.\nIn effect from 1 March 2002, all the European Union member states except Denmark accepted Council Regulation (EC) 44/2001, which makes major changes to the Brussels Convention and is directly effective in the member nations. Council Regulation (EC) 44/2001 now also applies as between the rest of the EU Member States and Denmark due to an agreement reached between the European Community and Denmark. In some legal areas, at least, the reciprocal enforcement of foreign judgments is now more straightforward. At a national level, the traditional rules still determine jurisdiction over persons who are not domiciled or habitually resident in the European Union or the Lugano area.\nNational.\nMany nations are subdivided into states or provinces (i.e. a subnational \"state\"). In a federation\u2014as can be found in Australia, Brazil, India, Mexico, and the United States\u2014such subunits will exercise \"jurisdiction\" through the court systems as defined by the executives and legislatures.\nWhen the jurisdictions of government entities overlap one another\u2014for example between a state and the federation to which it belongs\u2014their jurisdiction is a \"shared\" or \"concurrent\" jurisdiction. Otherwise, one government entity will have exclusive jurisdiction over the shared area. When jurisdiction is concurrent, one government entity may have supreme jurisdiction over the other entity if their laws conflict. If the executive or legislative powers within the jurisdiction are not restricted, or have only limited restrictions, these government branches have plenary power such as a national policing power. Otherwise, an enabling act grants only limited or enumerated powers.\nChild custody cases in the U.S. are a prime example of jurisdictional dilemmas caused by different states under a federal alignment. When parents and children are in different states, there is the possibility of different state court orders over-ruling each other. The U.S. solved this problem by adopting the Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction and Enforcement Act. The act established criteria for determining which state has primary jurisdiction, which allows courts to defer the hearing of a case if an appropriate administrative agency determines so.\nUnited States.\nThe primary distinctions between areas of jurisdiction are codified at the federal level. In the United States' common law system, jurisdiction is conceptually divided between jurisdiction over the \"subject matter\" of a case and personal jurisdiction over the parties to the case.\nA court whose subject matter jurisdiction is limited to certain types of controversies (for example, suits in admiralty or suits where the monetary amount sought is less than a specified sum) is sometimes referred to as a \"court of special jurisdiction\" or \"court of limited jurisdiction\".\nIn U.S. federal courts, courts must consider subject matter jurisdiction sua sponte and therefore recognize their own lack of jurisdiction even if neither party has raised the matter.\nGeneral and limited jurisdiction.\nA court whose subject matter is not limited to certain types of controversy is referred to as a \"court of general jurisdiction\". In the U.S. states, each state has courts of general jurisdiction; most states also have some courts of limited jurisdiction. Federal courts (those operated by the federal government) are all courts of limited jurisdiction. Federal jurisdiction is divided into federal question jurisdiction and diversity jurisdiction. The United States district courts may hear only cases arising under federal law and treaties, cases involving ambassadors, admiralty cases, controversies between states or between a state and citizens of another state, lawsuits involving citizens of different states, and against foreign states and citizens.\nCertain courts, particularly the United States Supreme Court and most state supreme courts, have discretionary jurisdiction, meaning that they can choose which cases to hear from among all the cases presented on appeal. Such courts generally only choose to hear cases that would settle important and controversial points of law. Though these courts have discretion to deny cases they otherwise could adjudicate, no court has the discretion to hear a case that falls outside of its subject matter jurisdiction.\nOriginal and appellate jurisdiction.\nIt is also necessary to distinguish between original jurisdiction and appellate jurisdiction. A court of original jurisdiction has the power to hear cases as they are first initiated by a plaintiff, while a court of appellate jurisdiction may only hear an action after the court of original jurisdiction (or a lower appellate court) has heard the matter. For example, in United States federal courts, the United States district courts have original jurisdiction over a number of different matters (as mentioned above), and the United States court of appeals have appellate jurisdiction over matters appealed from the district courts. The U.S. Supreme Court, in turn, has appellate jurisdiction (of a discretionary nature) over the Courts of Appeals, as well as the state supreme courts, by means of writ of certiorari.\nHowever, in a special class of cases, the U.S. Supreme Court has the power to exercise original jurisdiction. Under \u00a0https://, the Supreme court has original and exclusive jurisdiction over controversies between two or more states, and original (but non-exclusive) jurisdiction over cases involving officials of foreign states, controversies between the federal government and a state, actions by a state against the citizens of another state or foreign country.\nExample of jurisdiction.\nAs a practical example of court jurisdiction, as of 2013 Utah has five types of courts, each for different legal matters and different physical territories. One-hundred-and-eight judges oversee Justice Courts, which handle traffic and parking citations, misdemeanor crimes, and most small claims cases. Seventy-one judges preside over District Courts, which deal with civil cases exceeding small claims limits, probate law, felony criminal cases, divorce and child custody cases, some small claims, and appeals from Justice Courts. Twenty-eight judges handle Juvenile Court, which oversees most people under 18 years old who are accused of a crime, as well as cases of alleged child abuse or neglect; serious crimes committed by 16 or 17 year old persons may be referred to the District Courts. Seven judges in the Appeals Court hear most criminal appeals from District Courts, all appeals from juvenile court and all domestic/divorce cases from District Court, as well as some cases transferred to them by the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court seats five judges who hear appeals on first-degree felonies (the most serious) including capital crimes, as well as all civil cases from District Court (excepting divorce/domestic cases). The Supreme Court also oversees cases involving interpretation of the state Constitution, election matters, judicial conduct, and alleged misconduct by lawyers. This example shows how matters arising in the same physical territory might be seen in different courts. A minor traffic infraction originating in Orem, Utah is handled by the Orem Justice Court. However, a second-degree felony arrest and a first-degree felony arrest in Orem would be under the jurisdiction of the District Court in Provo, Utah. If both the minor traffic offense and the felony arrests resulted in guilty verdicts, the traffic conviction could be appealed to the District Court in Provo, while the second-degree felony appeal would be heard by the Appeals Court in Salt Lake City and the first-degree felony appeal would be heard by the Supreme Court. Similarly for civil matters, a small claims case arising in Orem would probably be heard in the Orem Justice Court, while a divorce filed by an Orem resident would be heard by the District Court in Provo. The above examples apply only to cases of Utah state law; any case under Federal jurisdiction would be handled by a different court system. All Federal cases arising in Utah are under the jurisdiction of the United States District Court for the District of Utah, headquartered in Salt Lake City, Utah, and would be heard in one of three Federal courthouses.\nAustralia.\nIn Australia, unless a matter is brought before the courts in a way amounting to an abuse of process, a court recognizing its jurisdiction is obliged to exercise it. But as Australia is a federal country, no court is vested with an unrestricted jurisdiction. Therefore, the rules of jurisdiction are used to determine the ambit of those restrictions upon the courts.\nState and federal jurisdiction.\nThis idea of restrictions on jurisdiction is well illustrated by the difference in competence between federal and state courts.\nFederal courts are the High Court of Australia (HCA), the Federal Court of Australia (FCA), the Family Court of Australia, and other subsidiary courts. Federal courts exercise federal jurisdiction -- the judicial powers granted to the judicial branch of the federal government by the Constitution of Australia. The extent of that jurisdiction is then outlined and delimited in both the Constitution and legislation enacted pursuant to it by the federal parliament. For example, section 73(ii) of the Constitution empowers the High Court to hear appeals from the supreme court of any state, and from other courts exercising federal jurisdiction. Likewise, section 39B(1A)(c) of the \"Judiciary Act\" 1903 (Cth) empowers the Federal Court of Australia to hear any matter arising under laws enacted by the federal parliament.\nSimilarly, the jurisdiction of state courts is created by the states\u2019 constitutions and is further delineated by legislation passed by their respective parliaments. In the \"Constitution of Queensland 2001\" (QLD), it is written at s58(1) that the Supreme Court of the state has all jurisdiction necessary for the administration of justice in Queensland. That is the extent of its jurisdiction.\nIn New South Wales, the courts\u2019 jurisdiction is not mentioned in the constitution. Instead, the state\u2019s legislature is empowered to make laws for the peace, welfare, and good governance of New South Wales. Amongst these laws, it is stated in section 23 of the \"Supreme Court Act 1970\" (NSW) that the Supreme Court shall have all jurisdiction necessary for the administration of justice in NSW.\nIn Victoria, that same power is conferred by section 85(1) of its constitution.\nIn summary, the jurisdiction of the courts of each state extends (at a basic level) to matters occurring within their state. Meanwhile, the jurisdiction of the Federal Court of Australia is over matters arising under federal law. The jurisdiction of the High Court is to hear appeals from states\u2019 Supreme Courts, the Federal Court, and over a unique set of matter-types (eg, federal electoral disputes) in the HCA's own \"original jurisdiction\" as prescribed in the Constitution and Judiciary Act. Insofar as it exercises its power to hear and determine an appeal on a matter of state law only, the HCA\u2014despite being a federal court\u2014may be said to be exercising state (eg, Victorian) jurisdiction, namely its own Victorian jurisdiction to determine disputes \"in\" Victoria or \"of\" Victorians\u2014and further its own power as the ultimate court of appeal above any state supreme court (the appeal is heard in the Court's appellate jurisdiction) to finally determine what the Victorian law \"is.\"\nOriginal and appellate jurisdiction.\nA layered or hierarchical understanding of levels of curial jurisdiction is useful to determine which questions a court may (seek to) answer in examining a matter based on the mechanism by which the matter came before it. Original jurisdiction permits courts to answer all questions of law and fact: this is jurisdiction possessed by a court because the matter is new, brought before a court for the first time -- originally. (For practical reasons, courts hearing appeals from administrative bodies will also exercise original jurisdiction; this does not subvert the notion of jurisdiction -- rather it points to the separateness of jurisdictions of the judicial decision maker versus (say) the executive ministerial decision maker.)\nAppellate jurisdiction is corrective in nature. There, courts examine how lower courts' and earlier decision-makers answered questions of law, whether an error was made in that process, as well as whether and how that error ought to be rectified. Their job is to correct errors made in answering the said questions - essentially, to correct errors of law.\nCross-vesting scheme.\nThe jurisdiction of Supreme Courts of states and territories may be vested in each other in special circumstances, and federal jurisdiction may likewise be vested in them. Technicalities aside, the scheme compels courts to transfer matters to another court if, in the interests of justice, the second court is a more appropriate place to litigate. In assessing the interests of justice in any particular matter, the court will have regard to the interests of the parties.\nThe mere existence of criteria to transfer matters over to different courts nonetheless means that parties have an interest in commencing proceedings in the most convenient jurisdiction to them. The advantage conferred onto first movers is not exclusive to the Australian federal court system, parties involved in international disputes will already be familiar with that concept. However, the threshold for intra-Australia transfer is notably lower than that pertaining to international transfer.\nTerritorial meaning.\nThe word \"jurisdiction\" is also used, especially in informal writing, to refer to a state or political subdivision generally, or to its government, rather than to its legal authority. This is especially useful for describing a variety of governments at a variety of levels -- where one cannot simply for example refer to 'states', because one of those in the set is a national government. When one has a multi-level set of governments to describe, 'jurisdictions' is a useful plural (group) descriptor. \nFranchise jurisdiction.\nIn the history of English common law, a jurisdiction could be held as a form of property (or more precisely an incorporeal hereditament) called a franchise. Traditional franchise jurisdictions of various powers were held by municipal corporations, religious houses, guilds, early universities, the Welsh Marches, and counties palatine. Types of franchise courts included courts baron, courts leet, merchant courts, and the stannary courts that dealt with disputes involving the tin miners of Cornwall. The original royal charters of the American colonies included broad grants of franchise jurisdiction along with other governmental powers to corporations or individuals, as did the charters for many other colonial companies such as the British East India Company and British South Africa Company. Analogous jurisdiction existed in medieval times on the European Continent. Over the course of the 19th and 20th centuries, franchise jurisdictions were largely eliminated. Several formerly important franchise courts were not officially abolished until Courts Act of 1971.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He is popularly remembered for having given his name to the Abernethy biscuit, a coarse-meal baked good meant to aid digestion.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:TOC limit/styles.css\" /&gt;\nLife.\nJohn Abernethy was the grandson of John Abernethy. He was born in Coleman Street in the City of London on 3 April 1764, where his father was a merchant. Educated at Wolverhampton Grammar School, he was apprenticed in 1779 to Sir Charles Blicke (1745\u20131815), a surgeon at St Bartholomew's Hospital, London. He attended the anatomical lectures of Sir William Blizard (1743\u20131835) at the London Hospital, and was employed to assist as \"demonstrator\"; he also attended Percivall Pott's surgical lectures at St Bartholomew's Hospital, as well as the lectures of John Hunter. On Pott's resignation of the office of surgeon of St Bartholomew's, Sir Charles Blicke, who was assistant-surgeon, succeeded him, and Abernethy was elected assistant-surgeon in 1787.\nIn this capacity Abernethy began to give lectures at his house in Bartholomew Close, which were so well attended that the governors of the hospital built a theatre (1790\u20131791), and Abernethy thus became the founder of the medical school of St Bartholomew's. He held the office of assistant-surgeon for twenty-eight years, until, in 1815, he was elected principal surgeon. He had before that time been appointed lecturer in anatomy to the Royal College of Surgeons (1814). Abernethy was not a great operator, though his name is associated with the treatment of aneurysm by ligature of the external iliac artery.\nIn 1823, Abernethy was president of the Medical and Chirurgical Society of London.\nAbernethy was an anti-vivisectionist. Although he carried out experiments on animals, he killed them first, for he abhorred vivisection.\nAbernethy's \"Surgical Observations on the Constitutional Origin and Treatment of Local Diseases\" (1809) \u2013 known as \"My Book\", from the great frequency with which he referred his patients to it, and to page 72 of it in particular, under that name \u2013 was one of the earliest popular works on medical science. So great was his zeal in encouraging patients to read the book that he earned the nickname \"Doctor My-Book\". He taught that local diseases were frequently the results of disordered states of the digestive organs, and were to be treated by purging and attention to diet. As a lecturer he was exceedingly attractive, and his success in teaching was largely attributable to the persuasiveness with which he enunciated his views. It has been said however, that the influence he exerted on those who attended his lectures was not beneficial in this respect, that his opinions were delivered so dogmatically, and all who differed from him were disparaged and denounced so contemptuously, as to repress instead of stimulating inquiry. The celebrity he attained in his practice was due not only to his great professional skill, but also in part to his eccentricity. He was very blunt with his patients, treating them often brusquely and sometimes even rudely.\nAbernethy resigned his position at St Bartholomew's Hospital in 1827. He died at his residence at Enfield on 20 April 1831 and was buried at St Andrew's Enfield. Joined there in 1854 by his wife Anne (n\u00e9e Threlfal; married 1800) and by three of their children.\nAbernethy biscuit.\nAbernethy believed that a variety of diseases originated in a disordered state of the digestive organs, and that treating underlying maldigestion and dyspepsia was essential to restoring health. He invented, or at least gave his name to, a digestive biscuit called the Abernethy biscuit that he promoted from about 1829 until his death.\nAwards and works.\nIn 1819, Abernethy was awarded the Hunterian Professorship. He contributed articles to \"Rees's Cyclop\u00e6dia\" on Anatomy and Physiology, but the topics are not known. A collected edition of his works was published in 1830. A biography, https://, by George Macilwain (1797\u20131882), appeared in 1853.\nIn literature.\nJohn Abernethy is mentioned in Edgar Allan Poe's \"The Purloined Letter\" (1844).\nHis debate with Sir William Lawrence is believed by Marilyn Butler to have influenced Mary Shelley's Frankenstein.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The term \"Jud\u00e6o Christian\" first appeared in the 19th century as a word for Jewish converts to Christianity. The term has received criticism, largely from Jewish thinkers, as relying on and perpetuating notions of supersessionism, as well as glossing over fundamental differences between Jewish and Christian thought, theology, culture and practice.\nIn the United States, the term was widely used during the Cold War in an attempt to invoke a unified American identity opposed to communism.\nThe use of the more inclusive term \"Abrahamic religions\" to refer to the common grouping of faiths which are attributed to Abraham (Islam, the Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed Faith, Samaritanism, Druzism, and other faiths in addition to Judaism and Christianity) is also sometimes seen as problematic.\nHistory.\nThe term \"Jud\u00e6o Christian\" appears in a letter by Alexander McCaul which is dated October 17, 1821. The term in this case referred to Jewish converts to Christianity. The term was similarly used by Joseph Wolff in 1829, in reference to a type of church that would observe some Jewish traditions in order to convert Jews. Mark Silk states in the early 19th century the term was \"most widely used (in French as well as English) to refer to the early followers of Jesus who opposed\" the wishes of Paul the Apostle and wanted \"to restrict the message of Jesus to Jews and who insisted on maintaining Jewish law and ritual\".\nFriedrich Nietzsche used the German term (\"Jewish-Christian\") to describe and emphasize what he believed were neglected aspects of the continuity which exists between the Jewish and Christian worldviews. The expression appears in \"The Antichrist\", published in 1895 but written several years earlier; a fuller development of Nietzsche's argument can be found in the prior work, \"On the Genealogy of Morality\".\nThe concept of Judeo-Christian ethics or Judeo-Christian values in an ethical (rather than a theological or liturgical) sense was used by George Orwell in 1939, along with the phrase \"the Judaeo-Christian scheme of morals\". According to theologian Richard L. Rubenstein, the \"normative Judaeo-Christian interpretation of history\" is to treat human suffering, such as a plague, as punishment for human guilt.\nAccording to historian K. Healan Gaston, the term became a descriptor of the U.S. in the 1930s, when the country sought to forge a unified cultural identity in an attempt to distinguish itself from fascism and communism in Europe. Becoming part of the American civil religion by the 1940s, the term rose to greater prominence during the Cold War, especially when it was used to express opposition to communist atheism. In the 1970s, the term became particularly associated with the American Christian right. It is sometimes employed in a separate context in political attempts to restrict immigration and LGBT rights.\nChristian-Judeo.\nSome speakers have taken to the term \"Christian-Judeo\" for the same concept. Language columnist William Safire noted that it's a linguistically problematic construction, putting the combining form \"Judeo\" at the end, instead of \"Judaic\".\nInter-group relations.\nIn the United States.\nThe rise of antisemitism in the 1930s led concerned Protestants, Catholics, and Jews to take steps to increase mutual understanding and lessen the level of antisemitism in the United States. In this effort, precursors of the National Conference of Christians and Jews created teams consisting of a priest, a rabbi, and a minister, to run programs across the country, and fashion a more pluralistic America, no longer defined as a Christian land, but \"one nurtured by three ennobling traditions: Protestantism, Catholicism and Judaism...The phrase 'Judeo-Christian' entered the contemporary lexicon as the standard liberal term for the idea that Western values rest on a religious consensus that included Jews.\"\nIn the aftermath of World War II and the Holocaust, \"there was a revolution in Christian theology in America. [\u2026] The greatest shift in Christian attitudes towards the Jewish people since Constantine converted the Roman Empire.\" The rise of Christian Zionism, religiously motivated Christian interest, and support for the state of Israel increased interest in Judaism among American evangelicals. This interest is especially focused on areas of commonality between the teachings of Judaism and their own beliefs. \nDuring the late 1940s, evangelical proponents of the new Judeo-Christian approach lobbied Washington for diplomatic support of the new state of Israel. From the 1990s, continuing through the first two decades of the 21st century, interest in and a positive attitude towards America's Judeo-Christian tradition has become mainstream among evangelicals and (to some extent) the political conservative movement in the United States.\nAmerican Christians, particularly those aligned with the Christian Right, have historically extended strong support to the State of Israel. This support is rooted in conservative Protestant theology, which views Jews as God's chosen people with a special biblical status and role. However, this perspective is paradoxical, as it also considers Jews in need of conversion to Christianity for salvation. Beyond theological reasons, liberal Christian and secular organizations have also played significant roles in advocating for Jewish migration to Palestine and the establishment of Israel, often citing humanitarian concerns. This multifaceted support has influenced U.S. foreign policy towards Israel, reflecting the complex interplay between religious beliefs and political activism within the American Christian community.\nIn contrast, by the 1970s, mainline Protestant denominations and the National Council of Churches were more supportive of Palestinians than Israel. Natan Sharansky observed in 2019 that, for the first time, he was encountering the situation of nations with ample governmental support for Israel but disinterest and even overt hostility by the Jewish populace.\nThe scriptural basis for this new positive attitude towards Jews among evangelicals is found in Genesis 12:3, in which God promises that he will bless those who bless Abraham, and curse those who curse them. In the evangelical interpretation this promise includes the descendants of Abraham. Other factors in the new philo-Semitism include gratitude to the Jews for contributing to the theological foundations of Christianity and being the source of the prophets and Jesus; remorse for the Church's history of antisemitism; and fear that God will judge the nations at the end of time based on how they treated the Jewish people. Moreover, for many evangelicals Israel is seen as the instrument through which prophecies of the end times are fulfilled.\nThe use of the term \"Judeo-Christian\" in 21st century discourse has been criticized for equating two different faiths and being a vector for Islamophobia by exclusion.\nJewish responses.\nThe Jewish community's attitude towards the concept has been mixed. In the 1930s, \"In the face of worldwide anti-semitic efforts to stigmatize and destroy Judaism, influential Christians and Jews in America labored to uphold it, pushing Judaism from the margins of American religious life towards its very center.\" During World War II, Jewish chaplains worked with Catholic priests and Protestant ministers in order to promote goodwill, addressing servicemen who, \"in many cases had never seen, much less heard a Rabbi speak before\". At funerals for the unknown soldier, rabbis stood alongside the other chaplains and recited prayers in Hebrew. In a much-publicized wartime tragedy, the sinking of the , the ship's multi-faith chaplains gave up their lifebelts to evacuate seamen and stood together \"arm in arm in prayer\" as the ship sank. A 1948 postage stamp commemorated their heroism with the words: \"interfaith in action\".\nIn the 1950s, \"a spiritual and cultural revival washed over American Jewry\" in response to the trauma of the Holocaust. American Jews became more confident in their desire to be identified as different.\nTwo notable books addressed the relationship between contemporary Judaism and Christianity, Abba Hillel Silver's \"Where Judaism Differs\" and Leo Baeck's \"Judaism and Christianity\", both motivated by an impulse to clarify Judaism's distinctiveness \"in a world where the term Judeo-Christian had obscured critical differences between the two faiths\". Reacting against the blurring of theological distinctions, Rabbi Eliezer Berkovits wrote that \"Judaism is Judaism because it rejects Christianity, and Christianity is Christianity because it rejects Judaism.\" Theologian and author Arthur A. Cohen, in \"The Myth of the Judeo-Christian Tradition\", questioned the theological validity of the Judeo-Christian concept and suggested that it was essentially an invention of American politics, while Jacob Neusner, in \"Jews and Christians: The Myth of a Common Tradition\", writes, \"The two faiths stand for different people talking about different things to different people.\"\nLaw professor Stephen M. Feldman looking at the period before 1950, chiefly in Europe, sees invocation of a \"Judeo-Christian tradition\" as supersessionism:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Once one recognizes that Christianity has historically engendered antisemitism, then this so-called tradition appears as dangerous Christian dogma (at least from a Jewish perspective). For Christians, the concept of a Judeo-Christian tradition comfortably suggests that Judaism progresses into Christianity\u2014that Judaism is somehow completed in Christianity. The concept of a Judeo-Christian tradition flows from the Christian theology of supersession, whereby the Christian covenant (or Testament) with God supersedes the Jewish one. Christianity, according to this belief, reforms and replaces Judaism. The belief, therefore, implies, first, that Judaism needs reformation and replacement, and second, that modern Judaism remains merely as a \"relic\". Most importantly the belief of the Judeo-Christian tradition insidiously obscures the real and significant differences between Judaism and Christianity.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He devoted his life to understanding the oil-based media of the Old Masters. He emigrated to the United States in 1939 and became an influential teacher. His book, \"The Secret Formulas and Techniques of the Masters\", has been criticized by some modern writers on painting who say that the painting medium Maroger promoted is unsound.\nTraining and early career.\nIn 1907, Maroger began to study with Louis Anquetin and worked under his direction until Anquetin's death in 1932. Anquetin worked closely and exhibited with the artists Vincent van Gogh, Charles Angrand, \u00c9mile Bernard, Paul Gauguin, Camille Pissarro, Georges Seurat, Paul Signac and Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec. Anquetin's early style was influenced by Impressionism, but in his later years he became very interested in the works of the Flemish masters. As Maroger's teacher, Anquetin provided guidance in the study of drawing, anatomy and master painting techniques. Maroger began to become famous around 1931, when the National Academy of Design in New York City reported Maroger's painting discoveries.\nFrom 1930 to 1939, Maroger started to work at the Louvre Museum in Paris as Technical Director of the Louvre Laboratory. He served as a professor at the Louvre School, a Member of the Conservation Committee, General Secretary of the International Experts, and President of the Restorers of France. In 1937, he received the L\u00e9gion d'honneur, and his pride at the honor is reflected in his self-portrait of the time, in which one can see his Legion pin on his lapel.\nHe emigrated to the United States in 1939 and became a lecturer at the Parsons School of Design in New York. His New York students, Reginald Marsh, John Koch, Fairfield Porter and Frank Mason adopted his Old Master painting techniques, and taught it in turn to their own students.\nIn 1942, Maroger became a Professor at the Maryland Institute College of Art in Baltimore and established a school of painting. At the Maryland Institute he led a group of painters who came to be known as the Baltimore Realists, including the painters Earl Hofmann, https://, http://, Ann Didusch Schuler, Frank Redelius, John Bannon, Evan Keehn, and http:// .\nMaroger published \"The Secret Formulas and Techniques of the Masters\" in 1948. When Maroger's book became available, Reginald Marsh drew on Maroger's book-jacket an airplane dropping an atomic bomb on the Maryland Art Institute, a reference to the controversy Maroger was causing in the local press over the abstract art versus realism debate.\nMaroger's formula and techniques have been studied by many modern painters who wish to obtain the paint quality of the Old Masters. The \"secret formula\" that Maroger devised during his lifetime included the main ingredient white lead. White lead when cooked into linseed oil acts as a drying agent, accelerating the polymerization of the oil film.\nMaroger claimed to have introduced to the modern day artist what the masters achieved centuries before in their paintings, a way to ensure permanence and color quality in oils without sacrificing fluid and subtle paint handling. Equipped with these formulas, the artist could once again blend his paint easily without losing control of his brush. The paint stays where it is applied and does not run off the panel. It dries very fast so that he can paint on the same areas the very next day, which speeds up painting.\nFrank Redelius, one of Maroger's prot\u00e9g\u00e9s from the Baltimore Realists group, wrote a book that updates, builds upon and revises Jacques Maroger's research of the painting techniques and formulas of the Old Masters. Redelius was assisting Maroger with a revision of \"The Secret Formulas and Techniques of the Masters\" before Maroger's death in 1962. Frank Redelius' book, published in 2009, is titled \"The Master Keys: A Painter's Treatise On The Pictorial Technique Of Oil Painting\".\nCritics of Maroger.\nMaroger has been criticized by some modern writers on painting because of his bold assertions about having found the secret formulas of the Masters. The current proprietary Maroger's Medium is in fact the jelly-like medium also known as Megilp (Macgilp, McGuilp, etc.). This material, made by mixing heavy mastic varnish with a linseed oil that has been cooked to blackness with litharge or white lead, was introduced in the late 18th century and employed extensively during the 19th, and therefore is not of centuries-old pedigree.\nThe archival quality of the medium itself is controversial in art circles, in part because its documented use dates back less than a century. This is from Michael Skalka, Conservation Administrator, National Gallery of Art, Washington, DC.:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;[Our convervators] know that Maroger and other media do not betray their bad characteristics for a long time. (60 years is not enough time \u2013 oil paint isn't even fully dry in 60 -80 years on a typical thickly painted painting) Maroger (1884\u20131962) did not influence artists until the early 20th century so 19th century works are not affected by his practices. However, recently, two conservators in a museum in New England examined and studied the work of John Stuart Curry who was an avid fan of Maroger. Many of his works have suffered through the use of the medium. Granted, Curry was a zealot who followed Maroger's early and late formulations. Curry's work employed an early Maroger formula that involved leaded oil, resin and in early versions incorporated water based additives. These have suffered the most.See the work of Lance Mayer and Gay Myers for more information on Curry and Maroger.\nMaroger medium which is not made properly may contain a large amount of dirt and impurities from improperly filtered mastic varnish, or the black oil may be overcooked, both of which would contribute to darkening and weakening of the work. In addition the overuse of megilp media (or any medium for that matter) tends to create weak paint films. Conservation science has shown that the presence of natural resins like mastic in the paint film causes embrittlement, darkening, and continued solubility. See the work of Leslie Carlyle or Joyce Townsend for problems related to 18th-century painting that contain megilp.\nLost old master formulas by Maroger.\nSix formulas of Maroger taken from his book on painting formulas.\nThe majority of these recipes are not employed today, as there are few companies that produce them. The primary form of \"Maroger medium\" known today is black oil (\"Giorgione's\" medium) and mastic varnish combined in approximately equal parts to form a gel.\nWhile Maroger medium is usually mixed directly with oil paints, its proportion should be kept to no more than 20% of the mixture. A useful technique is to rub a very thin film of Maroger medium over the area to be painted and paint into that\u2014known as \"painting into the couch.\" This lubricates the brush stroke. Maroger medium (or any other painting medium, for that matter) should never be used as a final picture varnish, as Maroger requires reaction by admixture with oil paint in order to dry.\nThe reduced availability of lead, combined with injunctions against lead use in household products and other factors has caused most major paint makers to discontinue the production of Maroger's medium. Many paint makers now offer faux-maroger's media or faux-megilps, generally made by substituting different materials, such as lime, for genuine lead, or (as in the case of Gamblin's Neo-Megilp) by creating a similar product out of specially thickened alkyd medium. These products produce effects similar to, but not the same as those of real Maroger medium, which depends on specific chemical reactions between leaded oil, mastic resin, and turpentine (the mastic varnish vehicle).\nHome and Studio.\nThe white gingerbread cottage that was Maroger's home in Baltimore is found on the east campus of Loyola College in Maryland and is used for drawing and painting courses. The building, created in the style of a Parisian studio, is aptly called the Maroger Art Studio.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

His first great interest was music. At the age of 14, he gave a piano concert in Steinway Hall. He continued to play the piano frequently throughout his life.\nAfter graduating from James Madison High School, he decided to pursue a scholarly career rather than a musical one. He enrolled at Columbia College in New York in 1932. During his senior year, he attended a class taught by Franz Boas concerning American Indian languages. He graduated in 1936 with a bachelor's degree. With references from Boas and Ruth Benedict, he was accepted as a graduate student by Melville J. Herskovits at Northwestern University in Chicago and graduated in 1940 with a doctorate degree. During the course of his graduate studies, Greenberg did fieldwork among the Hausa people of Nigeria, where he learned the Hausa language. The subject of his doctoral dissertation was the influence of Islam on a Hausa group that, unlike most others, had not converted to it.\nDuring 1940, he began postdoctoral studies at Yale University. These were interrupted by service in the U.S. Army Signal Corps during World War II, for which he worked as a codebreaker in North Africa and participated with the landing at Casablanca. He then served in Italy until the end of the war.\nBefore leaving for Europe during 1943, Greenberg married Selma Berkowitz, whom he had met during his first year at Columbia University.\nCareer.\nAfter the war, Greenberg taught at the University of Minnesota before returning to Columbia University in 1948 as a teacher of anthropology. While in New York, he became acquainted with Roman Jakobson and Andr\u00e9 Martinet. They introduced him to the Prague school of structuralism, which influenced his work.\nIn 1962, Greenberg relocated to the anthropology department at Stanford University in California, where he continued working for the rest of his life. In 1965 Greenberg served as president of the African Studies Association. That same year, he was elected to the United States National Academy of Sciences. He was later elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences (1973) and the American Philosophical Society (1975). In 1996 he received the highest award for a scholar in Linguistics, the Gold Medal of Philology.\nContributions to linguistics.\nLinguistic typology.\nGreenberg is considered the founder of modern linguistic typology, a field that he has revitalized with his publications in the 1960s and 1970s. Greenberg's reputation rests partly on his contributions to synchronic linguistics and the quest to identify linguistic universals. During the late 1950s, Greenberg began to examine languages covering a wide geographic and genetic distribution. He located a number of interesting potential universals as well as many strong cross-linguistic tendencies.\nIn particular, Greenberg conceptualized the idea of \"implicational universal\", which has the form, \"if a language has structure X, then it must also have structure Y.\" For example, X might be \"mid front rounded vowels\" and Y \"high front rounded vowels\" (for terminology see phonetics). Many scholars adopted this kind of research following Greenberg's example and it remains important in synchronic linguistics.\nLike Noam Chomsky, Greenberg sought to discover the universal structures on which human language is based. Unlike Chomsky, Greenberg's method was functionalist, rather than formalist. An argument to reconcile the Greenbergian and Chomskyan methods can be found in \"Linguistic Universals\" (2006), edited by Ricardo Mairal and Juana Gil.\nMass comparison.\nGreenberg rejected the opinion, prevalent among linguists since the mid-20th century, that comparative reconstruction was the only method to discover relationships between languages. He argued that genetic classification is methodologically prior to comparative reconstruction, or the first stage of it: one cannot engage in the comparative reconstruction of languages until one knows which languages to compare (1957:44).\nHe also criticized the prevalent opinion that comprehensive comparisons of two languages at a time (which commonly take years to perform) could establish language families of any size. He argued that, even for 8 languages, there are already 4,140 ways to classify them into distinct families, while for 25 languages there are 4,638,590,332,229,999,353 ways (1957:44). For comparison, the proposed Niger\u2013Congo family is said to have some 1,500 languages. He thought language families of any size needed to be established by some scholastic means other than bilateral comparison. The theory of mass comparison is an attempt to demonstrate such means.\nGreenberg argued for the virtues of breadth over depth. He advocated restricting the amount of material to be compared (to basic vocabulary, morphology, and known paths of sound change) and increasing the number of languages to be compared to all the languages in a given area. He hypothesised that this would make it possible to compare numerous languages reliably. At the same time, the process would provide a check on accidental resemblances through the sheer number of languages under review. The mathematical probability that resemblances are accidental decreases strongly with the number of languages concerned (1957:39).\nGreenberg used the premise that mass \"borrowing\" of basic vocabulary is unknown. He argued that borrowing, when it occurs, is concentrated in cultural vocabulary and clusters \"in certain semantic areas\", making it easy to detect. With the goal of determining broad patterns of relationship, the idea was not to get every word right but to detect patterns. From the beginning with his theory of mass comparison, Greenberg addressed why chance resemblance and borrowing were not obstacles to its being useful. Despite that, critics consider those phenomena caused difficulties for his theory.\nGreenberg first termed his method \"mass comparison\" in an article of 1954 (reprinted in Greenberg 1955). As of 1987, he replaced the term \"mass comparison\" with \"multilateral comparison\", to emphasize its contrast with the bilateral comparisons recommended by linguistics textbooks. He believed that multilateral comparison was not in any way opposed to the comparative method, but is, on the contrary, its necessary first step (Greenberg, 1957:44). According to him, comparative reconstruction should have the status of an explanatory theory for facts already established by language classification (Greenberg, 1957:45).\nMost historical linguists (Campbell 2001:45) reject the use of mass comparison as a method for establishing genealogical relationships between languages. Among the most outspoken critics of mass comparison have been Lyle Campbell, Donald Ringe, William Poser, and the late R. Larry Trask.\nGenetic classification of languages.\nLanguages of Africa.\nGreenberg is known widely for his development of a classification system for the languages of Africa, which he published as a series of articles in the \"Southwestern Journal of Anthropology\" from 1949 to 1954 (reprinted together as a book, \"The Languages of Africa\", in 1955). He revised the book and published it again during 1963, followed by a nearly identical edition of 1966 (reprinted without change during 1970). A few more changes of the classification were made by Greenberg in an article during 1981.\nGreenberg grouped the hundreds of African languages into four families, which he dubbed Afroasiatic, Nilo-Saharan, Niger\u2013Congo, and Khoisan. During the course of his work, Greenberg popularised the term \"Afroasiatic\", originally suggested by Maurice Delafosse, to replace the earlier term \"Hamito-Semitic\", after showing that the Hamitic group, accepted widely since the 19th century, is not a valid language family. Another major feature of his work was to establish the classification of the Bantu languages, which occupy much of Central and Southern Africa, as a part of the Atlantic\u2013Congo family, rather than as an independent family as many Bantuists had maintained.\nGreenberg's classification rested largely in evaluating competing earlier classifications. For a time, his classification was considered bold and speculative, especially the proposal of a Nilo-Saharan language family.\nGreenberg's work on African languages has been criticised by Lyle Campbell and Donald Ringe, who do not believe that his classification is justified by his data and request a re-examination of his macro-phyla by \"reliable methods\" (Ringe 1993:104). Harold Fleming and Lionel Bender, who were sympathetic to Greenberg's classification, acknowledged that at least some of his macrofamilies (particularly the Nilo-Saharan and the Khoisan macrofamilies) are not accepted completely by most linguists and may need to be divided (Campbell 1997). Their objection was methodological: if mass comparison is not a valid method, it cannot be expected to have brought order successfully out of the confusion of African languages.\nBy contrast, some linguists have sought to combine Greenberg's four African families into larger units. In particular, Edgar Gregersen (1972) proposed joining Niger\u2013Congo and Nilo-Saharan into a larger family, which he termed Kongo-Saharan. Roger Blench (1995) suggests Niger\u2013Congo is a subfamily of Nilo-Saharan.\nThe languages of New Guinea, Tasmania, and the Andaman Islands.\nDuring 1971 Greenberg proposed the Indo-Pacific macrofamily, which groups together the Papuan languages (a large number of language families of New Guinea and nearby islands) with the native languages of the Andaman Islands and Tasmania but excludes the Australian Aboriginal languages. Its principal feature was to reduce the manifold language families of New Guinea to a single genetic unit. This excludes the Austronesian languages, which have been established as associated with a more recent migration of people.\nGreenberg's subgrouping of these languages has not been accepted by the few specialists who have worked on the classification of these languages. However, the work of Stephen Wurm (1982) and Malcolm Ross (2005) has given a small amount of mainstream support for his hypothesis. Wurm stated that the lexical similarities between Great Andamanese, West Papuan and Timor\u2013Alor\u2013Pantar families \"are quite striking and amount to virtual formal identity [...] in a number of instances.\" He believes this to be due to a linguistic substratum.\nThe languages of the Americas.\nMost linguists concerned with the native languages of the Americas classify them into 150 to 180 independent language families. Early on, Greenberg (1957:41, 1960) became convinced that many of the language groups considered unrelated could be classified into larger groupings. In his 1987 book \"Language in the Americas\", while agreeing that the Eskimo\u2013Aleut and Na-Den\u00e9 groupings as distinct, he proposed that all the other Native American languages belong to a single language macro-family, which he termed Amerind.\n\"Language in the Americas\" has generated lively debate, but has been criticized strongly; it is rejected by most specialists of indigenous languages of the Americas and also by most historical linguists. Specialists of the individual language families have found extensive inaccuracies and errors in Greenberg's data, such as including data from non-existent languages, erroneous transcriptions of the forms compared, misinterpretations of the meanings of words used for comparison, and entirely spurious forms.\nHistorical linguists also reject the validity of the method of multilateral (or mass) comparison upon which the classification is based. They argue that he has not provided a convincing case that the similarities presented as evidence are due to inheritance from an earlier common ancestor rather than being explained by a combination of errors, accidental similarity, excessive semantic latitude in comparisons, borrowings, onomatopoeia, etc.\nHowever, Harvard geneticist David Reich notes that recent genetic studies have identified patterns that support Greenberg's Amerind classification: the \"First American\u201d category. \"The cluster of populations that he predicted to be most closely related based on language were in fact verified by the genetic patterns in populations for which data are available.\u201d \nThe languages of northern Eurasia.\nLater in his life, Greenberg proposed that nearly all of the language families of northern Eurasia belong to a single higher-order family, which he termed Eurasiatic. The only exception was Yeniseian, which he attached to a wider Den\u00e9\u2013Caucasian grouping, also including Sino-Tibetan. During 2008 Edward Vajda proposed a relation between Yeniseian and the Na-Den\u00e9 languages of North America as a Den\u00e9\u2013Yeniseian family.\nThe Eurasiatic grouping resembles the older Nostratic proposals of Holger Pedersen and Vladislav Illich-Svitych by including Indo-European, Uralic, Turkic, Tungusic, and Mongolic. It differs by including Nivkh, Japonic, Korean, and Ainu (which most Nostraticists had excluded from comparison because they are single languages rather than language families) and in excluding Afroasiatic. At about this time, Russian Nostraticists, notably Sergei Starostin, constructed a revised version of Nostratic. It was slightly larger than Greenberg's grouping but it also excluded Afroasiatic.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The scope of his landscape subjects was very broad as he painted forest landscapes, marine paintings, river landscapes, beach scenes, winter landscapes, cityscapes, architectural views and landscapes with peasants. The list of painters he influenced is much longer. He was an extremely prolific artist who left approximately twelve hundred paintings and more than one thousand drawings.\nBiography.\nJan van Goyen was the son of a shoemaker and started as an apprentice in Leiden, the town of his birth. Like many Dutch painters of his time, he studied art in the town of Haarlem with Esaias van de Velde. At age 35, he established a permanent studio at The Hague (Den Haag). Crenshaw tells (and mentions the sources) that van Goyen's landscape paintings rarely fetched high prices, but he made up for the modest value of individual pieces by increasing his production, painting thinly and quickly with a limited palette of inexpensive pigments. Despite his market innovations, he always sought more income, not only through related work as an art dealer and auctioneer but also by speculating in tulips (he was the last known victim of the tulip mania of the 1630s) and real estate. Although the latter was usually a safe avenue of investing money, in van Goyen's experience it led to enormous debts. Paulus Potter rented one of his houses. Though he seems to have kept a workshop, his only registered pupils were Nicolaes van Berchem, Jan Steen, and Adriaen van der Kabel. The list of painters he influenced is much longer.\nIn 1652 and 1654, he was forced to sell his collection of paintings and graphic art, and he subsequently moved to a smaller house. He died in 1656 in The Hague, still unbelievably 18,000 guilders in debt, forcing his widow to sell their remaining furniture and paintings. Van Goyen's troubles also may have affected the early business prospects of his student and son-in-law Jan Steen, who left The Hague in 1654.\nDutch painting.\nTypically, a Dutch painter of the 17th century will fall into one of four categories: a painter of portraits, landscapes, still-lifes, or genre painting. Dutch painting was highly specialized and rarely could an artist hope to achieve greatness in more than one area in a lifetime of painting. Jan van Goyen would be classified primarily as a landscape artist with an eye for the genre subjects of everyday life. He painted many of the canals in and around The Hague as well as the villages surrounding the countryside of Delft, Rotterdam, Leiden, and Gouda. Other popular Dutch landscape painters of the sixteenth and seventeenth century were\nJacob van Ruisdael, Aelbert Cuyp, Hendrick Avercamp, Ludolf Backhuysen, Meindert Hobbema, Aert van der Neer.\nVan Goyen's technique.\nJan van Goyen would begin a painting using a support primarily of thin oak wood. To this panel, he would scrub on several layers of a thin animal hide glue. With a blade, he would then scrape over the entire surface a thin layer of tinted white lead to act as a ground and to fill the low areas of the panel. The ground was tinted light brown, sometimes reddish, or ochre in colour.\nNext, van Goyen would loosely and very rapidly sketch out the scene to be painted with pen and ink without going into the small details of his subject. This walnut ink drawing can be clearly seen in some of the thinly painted areas of his work. For a guide, he would have turned to a detailed drawing. The scene would have been drawn from life outdoors and then kept in the studio as reference material. Drawings by artists of the time were rarely works of art in their own right as they are viewed today.\nOn his palette he would grind out a colour collection of neutral grays, umbers, ochre and earthen greens that looked like they were pulled from the very soil he painted. A varnish oil medium was used as vehicle to grind his powdered pigments into paint and then used to help apply thin layers of paint which he could easily blend.\nThe dark areas of the painting were kept very thin and transparent with generous amounts of the oil medium. The light striking the painting in these sections would be lost and absorbed into the painting ground. The lighter areas of the picture were treated heavier and opaque with a generous amount of white lead mixed into the paint. Light falling on the painting in a light section is reflected back at the viewer. The effect is a startling realism and three-dimensional quality. The surface of a finished painting resembles a fluid supple mousse, masterfully whipped and modeled with the brush.\nAccording to the art historian H.\u00a0U. Beck, \"In his freely composed seascapes of the 1650s he reached the apex of his creative work, producing paintings of striking perfection.\"\nSome of Van Goyen's Works can be seen at the Thyssen Bornemisza Museum in Madrid, one from the public collection (\"Winter landscape with figures on ice\", 1643) and others from the Carmen Thyssen Collection also shown there (\"River Landscape with Ferry boat and Cottages\", 1634).\nLegacy.\nJan van Goyen was famously influential on the landscape painters of his century. His tonal quality was a feature that many imitated. According to the Netherlands Institute for Art History, he influenced Cornelis de Bie, Jan Coelenbier, Cornelis van Noorde, Abraham Susenier, Herman Saftleven, Pieter Jansz van Asch, and Abraham van Beijeren.\nVan Goyen is mentioned by his fellow countryman Vincent van Gogh in Vincent's second letter from the asylum: \"Through the iron-barred window I can make out a square of wheat in an enclosure, a perspective in the manner of Van Goyen, above which in the morning I see the sun rise in its glory.\"\nSources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The \"First Apology\", his most well-known text, passionately defends the morality of the Christian life, and provides various ethical and philosophical arguments to convince the Roman emperor Antoninus Pius to abandon the persecution of the Church. Further, he also indicates, as St. Augustine would later, regarding the \"true religion\" that revealed itself as Christianity, that the \"seeds of Christianity\" (manifestations of the Logos acting in history) actually predated Christ's incarnation. This notion allows him to claim many historical Greek philosophers (including Socrates and Plato), in whose works he was well studied, as unknowing Christians.\nJustin was martyred, along with some of his students, and is venerated as a saint by the Catholic Church, the Eastern Orthodox Church, the Oriental Orthodox Churches, Lutheran Churches, and in Anglicanism.\nLife.\nJustin Martyr was born c.\u2009AD 90\u2013100, into a Greek family, at Flavia Neapolis (today Nablus) near the ancient biblical city of Shechem, in Samaria. He knew little or no Hebrew and Aramaic, and had only a passing acquaintance with Judaism. He was uncircumcised, and defined himself as a Gentile. His grandfather, Bacchius, had a Greek name, while his father, Priscus, bore a Latin name, which has led to speculations that his ancestors may have settled in Neapolis soon after its establishment or that they were descended from a Roman \"diplomatic\" community that had been sent there.\nIn the opening of the \"Dialogue\", Justin describes his early education, stating that his initial studies left him unsatisfied due to their failure to provide a belief system that would afford theological and metaphysical inspiration to their young pupil. He says he tried first the school of a Stoic philosopher, who was unable to explain God's being to him. He then attended a Peripatetic philosopher but was put off because the philosopher was too eager for his fee. Then he went to hear a Pythagorean philosopher who demanded that he first learn music, astronomy, and geometry, which he did not wish to do. Subsequently, he adopted Platonism after encountering a Platonist thinker who had recently settled in his city.\nSome time afterwards, he chanced upon an old man, possibly a Syrian Christian, in the vicinity of the seashore, who engaged him in a dialogue about God and spoke of the testimony of the prophets as being more reliable than the reasoning of philosophers.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nMoved by the aged man's argument, Justin renounced both his former religious faith and his philosophical background, choosing instead to re-dedicate his life to the service of the Divine. His newfound convictions were only bolstered by the ascetic lives of the early Christians and the heroic example of the martyrs, whose piety convinced him of the moral and spiritual superiority of Christian doctrine. As a result, he thenceforth decided that the only option for him was to travel throughout the land, spreading the knowledge of Christianity as the \"true philosophy.\" His conversion is commonly assumed to have taken place at Ephesus though it may have occurred anywhere on the road from Syria Palestina to Rome.\nHe then adopted the dress of a philosopher himself and traveled about teaching. During the reign of Antoninus Pius (138\u2013161), he arrived in Rome and started his own school. Tatian was one of his pupils. In the reign of Marcus Aurelius, after disputing with the cynic philosopher Crescens, he was denounced by the latter to the authorities, according to Tatian (Address to the Greeks 19) and Eusebius (HE IV 16.7\u20138). Justin was tried, together with six friends (two of them, Euelpistus and Hierax, slaves educated by him), by the urban prefect Junius Rusticus, and was beheaded. Though the precise year of his death is uncertain, it can reasonably be dated by the prefectural term of Rusticus (who governed from 162 to 168). The Christian \"Martyrdom of Justin\" reports a record of the trial.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nWritings.\nThe earliest mention of Justin is found in the \"Oratio ad Graecos\" by his student Tatian who, after calling him \"the most admirable Justin\", quotes a saying of his and says that the Cynic Crescens laid snares for him. Irenaeus speaks of Justin's martyrdom and of Tatian as his disciple. Irenaeus quotes Justin twice and shows his influence in other places. Tertullian, in his \"Adversus Valentinianos\", calls Justin a philosopher and a martyr and the earliest antagonist of heretics. Hippolytus and Methodius of Olympus also mention or quote him. Eusebius of Caesarea deals with him at some length, and names the following works:\nEusebius implies that other works were in circulation; from St Irenaeus he knows of the apology \"Against Marcion,\" and from Justin's \"Apology\" of a \"Refutation of all Heresies\". St Epiphanius and St Jerome mention Justin.\nRufinus borrows from his Latin original of Hadrian's letter.\nSpurious medieval works.\nAfter Rufinus, Justin was known mainly from St Irenaeus and Eusebius or from spurious works. A considerable number of other works are given as Justin's by Arethas of Caesarea, Photius of Constantinople, and other writers, but this attribution is now generally admitted to be spurious. The \"Expositio rectae fidei\" was assigned by Johann Dr\u00e4seke to Apollinaris of Laodicea, but it is probably a work of as late as the 6th century. The \"Cohortatio ad Graecos\" has been attributed to Apollinaris of Laodicea, Apollinaris of Hierapolis, as well as others. The \"Epistola ad Zenam et Serenum\", an exhortation to Christian living, is dependent upon Clement of Alexandria, and was assigned by Pierre Batiffol to the Novatian Bishop Sisinnius (c.\u2009400). The extant work under the title \"On the Sovereignty of God\" does not correspond with Eusebius' description of it, though Adolf von Harnack regarded it as still possibly Justin's, and at least of the 2nd century. The author of the smaller treatise \"To the Greeks\" cannot be Justin, because he is dependent on Tatian; Von Harnack placed it between 180 and 240.\n\"Parisinus graecus\" 450.\nAfter this medieval period in which no authentic works of Justin Martyr were in widespread circulation, a single codex containing the complete works of Justin Martyr was discovered and purchased by Guillaume Pellicier, c.\u20091540 in Venice. Pellicier sent it to the Biblioth\u00e8que nationale de France where it remains today under the catalog number \"Parisinus graecus\" 450. This codex was completed on 11 September 1364 somewhere in the Byzantine Empire. The name of the scribe is unknown, although Manuel Kantakouzenos has been suggested as patron. Internal textual evidence shows that multiple older manuscripts were used to create this one, which strongly suggests that it must have originated in a major population center like Mistra, since libraries holding Justin Martyr were already rare by 1364. Other partial medieval manuscripts have been shown to be copies of this one. The \"editio princeps\" was published by Robert Estienne in 1551.\n\"Dialogue with Trypho\".\nThe \"Dialogue\" is a later work than the \"First Apology\"; the date of composition of the latter, judging from the fact that it was addressed to Antoninus Pius and his adopted sons Marcus Aurelius and Lucius Verus, must fall between 147 and 161. In the \"Dialogue with Trypho\", after an introductory section, Justin undertakes to show that Christianity is the new law for all men.\nJustin's dialogue with Trypho is unique in that he provides information on tensions between Jewish and Gentile believers in Jesus of the second century (Dial. 47:2\u20133) and in acknowledging the existence of a range, and a variety, of attitudes toward the beliefs and traditions of the Jewish believers in Jesus.\n\"On the Resurrection\".\nThe treatise \"On the Resurrection\" exists in extensive fragments that are preserved in the \"Sacra parallela\". The fragments begin with the assertion that the truth, and God the author of truth, need no witness, but that as a concession to the weakness of men it is necessary to give arguments to convince those who gainsay it. It is then shown, after a denial of unfounded deductions, that the resurrection of the body is neither impossible nor unworthy of God, and that the evidence of prophecy is not lacking for it. Another fragment takes up the positive proof of the resurrection, adducing that of Christ and of those whom he recalled to life. In yet another fragment the resurrection is shown to be that of what has gone down, i.e., the body; the knowledge concerning it is the new doctrine, in contrast to that of the old philosophers. The doctrine follows from the command to keep the body in moral purity.\nThe authenticity of the treatise is not so generally accepted as are Justin's other works. Even so, earlier than the \"Sacra parallela\", it is referred to by Procopius of Gaza (c. 465\u2013528). Methodius appeals to Justin in support of his interpretation of 1 Corinthians 15:50 in a way that makes it natural to assume the existence of a treatise on the subject, to say nothing of other traces of a connection in thought both here in Irenaeus (V., ii.-xiii. 5) and in Tertullian, where it is too close to be anything but a conscious following of the Greek. The \"Against Marcion\" is lost, as is the \"Refutation of all Heresies\" to which Justin himself refers in \"Apology\", i. 26; Hegesippus, besides perhaps Irenaeus and Tertullian, seems to have used it.\nRole within the Church.\nFlacius discovered \"blemishes\" in Justin's theology, which he attributed to the influence of pagan philosophers; and in modern times Semler and S.G. Lange have made him out a thorough Hellene, while Semisch and Otto defend him from this charge.\nIn opposition to the school of Ferdinand Christian Baur, who considered him a Jewish Christian, Albrecht Ritschl has argued that it was precisely because he was a Gentile Christian that he did not fully understand the Old Testament foundation of Paul's teaching, and explained in this way the modified character of his Paulinism and his legal mode of thought.\nEngelhardt has attempted to extend this line of treatment to Justin's entire theology, and to show that his conceptions of God, of free will and righteousness, of redemption, grace, and merit prove the influence of the cultivated Greek pagan world of the 2nd century, dominated by the Platonic and Stoic philosophy. But he admits that Justin is a Christian in his unquestioning adherence to the Church and its faith, his unqualified recognition of the Old Testament, and his faith in Christ as the Son of God the Creator, made manifest in the flesh, crucified, and risen, through which belief he succeeds in getting away from the dualism of both pagan and Gnostic philosophy.\nJustin was confident that his teaching was that of the Church at large. He knows of a division among the orthodox only on the question of the millennium and on the attitude toward the milder Jewish Christianity, which he personally is willing to tolerate as long as its professors in their turn do not interfere with the liberty of the Gentile converts; his millenarianism seems to have no connection with Judaism, but he believes firmly in a millennium, and generally in the Christian eschatology.\nOpposition to Judaism was common among church leaders in his day; however, Justin Martyr was hostile towards Jewry and regarded Jews as an accursed people. His anti-Judaic polemics have been cited as an origin of Christian antisemitism. However his views elaborated in the \"Dialogue with Trypho\" were tame compared to those of John Chrysostom and others.\nChristology.\nJustin, like others, thought that the Greek philosophers had derived, if not borrowed, the most essential elements of truth found in their teaching from the Old Testament. But at the same time he adopted the Stoic doctrine of the \"seminal word,\" and so philosophy was to him an operation of the Word\u2014in fact, through his identification of the Word with Christ, it was brought into immediate connection with him. In more recent scholarship, his writings are seen as expressing a knowledge and utilization of Platonism while also being critical of it, mentioning Plato's corpus numerous times in his work. Even when later converting to Christianity, he maintained Platonic viewpoints of divinity.\nThus he does not hesitate to declare that Socrates and Heraclitus were Christians (\"Apol.\", i. 46, ii. 10). His aim was to emphasize the absolute significance of Christ, so that all that ever existed of virtue and truth may be referred to him. The old philosophers and law-givers had only a part of the Logos, while the whole appears in Christ.\nWhile the gentile peoples, seduced by devils, had deserted the true God for idols, the Jews and Samaritans possessed the revelation given through the prophets and awaited the Messiah. However, the law, while containing commandments intended to promote the true fear of God, had other prescriptions of a purely pedagogic nature, which necessarily ceased when Christ, their end, appeared; of such temporary and merely relative regulations were circumcision, animal sacrifices, the Sabbath, and the laws as to food. Through Christ, the abiding law of God has been fully proclaimed. In his character, as the teacher of the new doctrine and promulgator of the new law, lies the essential nature of his redeeming work.\nThe idea of an economy of grace, of a restoration of the union with God which had been destroyed by sin, is not foreign to him. It is noteworthy that in the \"Dialogue\" he no longer speaks of a \"seed of the Word\" in every man, and in his non-apologetic works the emphasis is laid upon the redeeming acts of the life of Christ rather than upon the demonstration of the reasonableness and moral value of Christianity, though the fragmentary character of the latter works make it difficult to determine exactly to what extent this is true and how far the teaching of Irenaeus on redemption is derived from him.\nThe 1913 \"Catholic Encyclopedia\" notes that scholars have differed on whether Justin's writings on the nature of God were meant to express his firm opinion on points of doctrine, or to speculate on these matters. Specific points Justin addressed include that the Logos is \"numerically distinct from the Father\" though \"born of the very substance of the Father,\" and that \"through the Word, God has made everything.\" Justin used the metaphor of fire to describe the Logos as spreading like a flame, rather than \"dividing\" the substance of the Father. He also defended the Holy Spirit as a member of the Trinity, as well as the virginal birth of Jesus Christ. The Encyclopedia states that Justin places the genesis of the Logos as a voluntary act of the Father at the beginning of creation, noting that this is an \"unfortunate\" conflict with later Christian teachings. The Word is numerically distinct from the Father (Dial., cxxviii, cxxix; cf. lvi, lxii). He was born of the very substance of the Father, not that this substance was divided, but He proceeds from it as one fire does from another at which it is lit (cxxviii, lxi); this form of production (procession) is compared also with that of human speech (lxi). The Word (Logos) is therefore the Son: much more, He alone may properly be called Son (II Apol., vi, 3); He is the monogenes, the unigenitus (Dial., cv). Elsewhere, however, Justin, like St. Paul, calls Him the eldest Son, prototokos (I Apol., xxxiii; xlvi; lxiii; Dial., lxxxiv, lxxxv, cxxv). The Word is God (I Apol., lxiii; Dial., xxxiv, xxxvi, xxxvii, lvi, lxiii, lxxvi, lxxxvi, lxxxvii, cxiii, cxv, cxxv, cxxvi, cxviii). His Divinity, however, seems subordinate, as does the worship which is rendered to Him (I Apol., vi; cf. lxi, 13; Teder, \"Justins des M\u00e4rtyrers Lehre von Jesus Christus\", Freiburg im Br., 1906, 103\u201319). The Father engendered Him by a free and voluntary act (Dial., lxi, c, cxxvii, cxxviii; cf. Teder, op. cit., 104), at the beginning of all His works (Dial., lxi, lxii, II Apol., vi, 3); in this last text certain authors thought they distinguished in the Word two states of being, one intimate, the other outspoken, but this distinction, though found in some other apologists, is in Justin very doubtful. Through the Word God has made everything (II Apol., vi; Dial., cxiv). The Word is diffused through all humanity (I Apol., vi; II, viii; xiii); it was He who appeared to the patriarchs (I Apol., lxii; lxiii; Dial., lvi, lix, lx etc.). Two influences are plainly discernible in the aforesaid body of doctrine. It is, of course, to Christian revelation that Justin owes his concept of the distinct personality of the Word, His Divinity and Incarnation; but philosophic speculation is responsible for his unfortunate concepts of the temporal and voluntary generation of the Word, and for the subordinationism of Justin's theology. It must be recognized, moreover, that the latter ideas stand out more boldly in the \"Apology\" than in the \"Dialogue.\"\nMemoirs of the apostles.\nJustin Martyr, in his \"First Apology\" (c. 155) and \"Dialogue with Trypho\" (c. 160), sometimes refers to written sources consisting of narratives of the life of Jesus and quotations of the sayings of Jesus as \"memoirs of the apostles\" () and less frequently as gospels () which, Justin says, were read every Sunday in the church at Rome (\"1 Apol\". 67.3 \u2013 \"and the memoirs of the apostles or the writings of the prophets are being read as long as it is allowable\").\nThe designation \"memoirs of the apostles\" occurs twice in Justin's \"First Apology\" (66.3, 67.3\u20134) and thirteen times in the \"Dialogue\", mostly in his interpretation of Psalm 22, whereas the term \"gospel\" is used only three times, once in \"1 Apol.\" 66.3 and twice in the \"Dialogue\". The single passage where Justin uses both terms (\"1 Apol.\" 66.3) makes it clear that \"memoirs of the apostles\" and \"gospels\" are equivalent, and the use of the plural indicates Justin's awareness of more than one written gospel. (\"The apostles in the memoirs which have come from them, which are also called gospels, have transmitted that the Lord had commanded...\"). Justin may have preferred the designation \"memoirs of the apostles\" as a contrast to the \"gospel\" of his contemporary Marcion to emphasize the connections between the historical testimony of the gospels and the Old Testament prophecies which Marcion rejected.\nThe origin of Justin's use of the name \"memoirs of the apostles\" as a synonym for the gospels is uncertain. Scholar David E. Aune has argued that the gospels were modeled after classical Greco-Roman biographies, and Justin's use of the term \"apomnemoneumata\" to mean all the Synoptic Gospels should be understood as referring to a written biography such as the \"Memorabilia of Xenophon\" because they preserve the authentic teachings of Jesus. However, scholar Helmut Koester has pointed out the Latin title \"Memorabilia\" was not applied to Xenophon's work until the Middle Ages, and it is more likely \"apomnemoneumata\" was used to describe the oral transmission of the sayings of Jesus in early Christianity. Papias uses a similar term meaning \"remembered\" (\"apomnemoneusen\") when describing how Mark \"accurately recorded the recollections of Peter\", and Justin also uses it in reference to Peter in \"Dial.\" 106.3, followed by a quotation found only in the Gospel of Mark (Mk 3:16\u201317). Therefore, according to Koester, it is likely that Justin applied the name \"memoirs of the apostles\" analogously to indicate the trustworthy recollections of the apostles found in the written record of the gospels.\nJustin expounded on the gospel texts as an accurate recording of the fulfillment of prophecy, which he combined with quotations of the prophets of Israel from the LXX to demonstrate a proof from prophecy of the Christian kerygma. The importance which Justin attaches to the words of the prophets, which he regularly quotes with the formula \"it is written\", shows his estimate of the Old Testament Scriptures. However, the scriptural authority he attributes to the \"memoirs of the apostles\" is less certain. Koester articulates a majority view among scholars that Justin considered the \"memoirs of the apostles\" to be accurate historical records but not inspired writings, whereas scholar Charles E. Hill, though acknowledging the position of mainstream scholarship, contends that Justin regarded the fulfillment quotations of the gospels to be equal in authority.\nComposition.\nScriptural sources.\nGospels.\nJustin uses material from the Synoptic Gospels (Matthew, Mark, and Luke) in the composition of the \"First Apology\" and the \"Dialogue\", either directly, as in the case of Matthew, or indirectly through the use of a gospel harmony, which may have been composed by Justin or his school. However, his use, or even knowledge, of the Gospel of John is uncertain. One possible reference to John is a saying that is quoted in the context of a description of Christian baptism (\"1 Apol\". 61.4 \u2013 \"Unless you are reborn, you cannot enter into the kingdom of heaven.\"). However, Koester contends that Justin obtained this saying from a baptismal liturgy rather than a written gospel. Justin's possible knowledge of John's gospel may be suggested by verbal similarities to John 3:4 directly after the discussion about the new birth (\"Now, that it is impossible for those who have once been born to enter their mother's womb is manifest to all\"). Justin also uses language very similar to that of John 1:20 and 1:28. Furthermore, by employing the term \"memoirs of the apostles\" and distinguishing them from the writings of their \"followers\", Justin must have been of the belief that at least two gospels were written by actual apostles.\nApocalypse.\nJustin does not quote from the Book of Revelation directly, yet he clearly refers to it, naming John as its author (\"Dial\". 81.4 \"Moreover also among us a man named John, one of the apostles of Christ, prophesied in a revelation made to him that those who have believed on our Christ will spend a thousand years in Jerusalem; and that hereafter the general and, in short, the eternal resurrection and judgment of all will likewise take place\"). Scholar Brooke Foss Westcott notes that this reference to the author of the single prophetic book of the New Testament illustrates the distinction Justin made between the role of prophecy and fulfillment quotations from the gospels, as Justin does not mention any of the individual canonical gospels by name.\nLetters.\nThe apologetic character of Justin's habit of thought appears again in the Acts of his martyrdom, the genuineness of which is attested by internal evidence.\nTestimony sources.\nAccording to scholar Oskar Skarsaune, Justin relies on two main sources for his proofs from prophecy that probably circulated as collections of scriptural testimonies within his Christian school. He refers to Justin's primary source for demonstrating scriptural proofs in the \"First Apology\" and parallel passages in the \"Dialogue\" as a \"kerygma source\". A second source, which was used only in the \"Dialogue\", may be identical to a lost dialogue attributed to Aristo of Pella on the divine nature of the Messiah, the \"Dialogue of Jason and Papiscus\" (c. 140). Justin brings in biblical quotes verbatim from these sources, and he often appears to be paraphrasing his sources very closely, even in his interpretive remarks.\nJustin occasionally uses the Gospel of Matthew directly as a source for Old Testament prophecies to supplement his testimony sources. However, the fulfillment quotations from these sources most often appear to be harmonizations of the gospels of Matthew and Luke. Koester suggests that Justin had composed an early harmony along the lines of his pupil Tatian's \"Diatesseron\". However, the existence of a harmony independent of a collection of sayings for exposition purposes has been disputed by scholar Arthur Bellinzoni. The question of whether the harmonized gospel materials found in Justin's writings came from a preexisting gospel harmony or were assembled as part of an integral process of creating scriptural prooftexts is an ongoing subject of scholarly investigation.\n\"Kerygma source\".\nThe following excerpt from \"1 Apol\". 33:1,4\u20135 (partial parallel in \"Dial\". 84) on the annunciation and virgin birth of Jesus shows how Justin used harmonized gospel verses from Matthew and Luke to provide a scriptural proof of the messiahship of Jesus based on fulfillment of the prophecy of .\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;And hear again how Isaiah in express words foretold that He should be born of a virgin; for he spoke thus: 'Behold, the virgin will conceive in the womb and bear a son, and they will say in his name, God with us' (Mt 1:23).\u2014\u200a\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;...the power of God, coming down upon the virgin, overshadowed her and made her while yet a virgin to conceive (cf. Lk 1:35), and the angel of God proclaimed to her and said, 'Behold, you will conceive in the womb from the Holy Spirit and bear a son (Mt 1:20/Lk 1:31) and he will be called Son of the Most High (Lk 1:32). And you shall call his name Jesus, because he will save his people from their sins (Mt 1:21),' as those who have made memoirs of all things about our savior Jesus Christ taught...\u2014\u200a\nAccording to Skarsaune, the harmonized gospel narratives of Matthew and Luke were part of a tradition already circulating within Justin's school that expounded on the life and work of Jesus as the Messiah and the apostolic mission. Justin then rearranged and expanded these testimonia to create his \"First Apology\". The \"kerygma source\" of prooftexts (contained within \"1 Apol\". 31\u201353) is believed to have had a Two Parousias Christology, characterized by the belief that Jesus first came in humility, in fulfillment of prophecy, and will return in glory as the Messiah to the Gentiles. There are close literary parallels between the Christology of Justin's source and the \"Apocalypse of Peter\".\n\"Dialogue of Jason and Papiscus\".\nThe following excerpts from the \"Dialogue with Trypho\" of the baptism (\"Dial\". 88:3,8) and temptation (\"Dial\". 103:5\u20136) of Jesus, which are believed to have originated from the \"Dialogue of Jason and Papiscus\", illustrate the use of gospel narratives and sayings of Jesus in a testimony source and how Justin has adopted these \"memoirs of the apostles\" for his own purposes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;And then, when Jesus had come to the river Jordan where John was baptizing, and when Jesus came down into the water, a fire was even kindled in the Jordan, and when He was rising up from the water, the Holy Spirit fluttered down upon Him in the form of a dove, as the apostles have written about this very Christ of ours.\u2014\u200a\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;And when Jesus came to the Jordan, and being supposed to be the son of Joseph the carpenter..., the Holy Spirit, and for man's sake, as I said before, fluttered down upon Him, and a voice came at the time out of the heavens \u2013 which was spoken also by David, when he said, impersonating Christ, what the Father was going to say to Him \u2013 'You are My Son, this day I have begotten you'.\"\u2014\u200a\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;...the Devil himself...[was] called serpent by Moses, the Devil by Job and Zachariah, and was addressed as Satanas by Jesus. This indicated that he had a compound name made up of the actions which he performed; for the word \"Sata\" in the Hebrew and Syrian tongue means \"apostate\", while \"nas\" is the word which means in translation \"serpent\", thus, from both parts is formed the one word \"Sata-nas\". It is narrated in the memoirs of the apostles that as soon as Jesus came up out of the river Jordan and a voice said to him: 'You are My Son, this day I have begotten you', this Devil came and tempted him, even so far as to exclaim: 'Worship me'; but Christ replied: 'Get behind me, Satanas, the Lord your God shall you worship, and Him only shall you serve'. For, since the Devil had deceived Adam, he fancied that he could in some way harm him also.\u2014\u200a\nThe quotations refer to the fulfillment of a prophecy of Psalm 2:7 found in the Western text-type of Luke 3:22. Justin's mention of the fire on the Jordan without comment suggests that he was relying on an intermediate source for these gospel quotations, and his literal interpretation of a pseudo-etymology of the Hebrew word Satan indicates a dependence on a testimony source with a knowledge of Hebrew, which was probably the \"Dialogue of Jason and Papiscus\".\nThe \"Dialogue\" attributed to Aristo of Pella is believed to have furnished Justin with scriptural prooftexts on the divinity of the Messiah by combining a Wisdom Christology \u2013 Christ as the incarnation of preexistent Wisdom \u2013 with a Second Adam Christology \u2013 the first Adam was conquered by Satan, but this Fall of Man is reversed by Christ as the Second Adam who conquers Satan. This is implied in the pseudo-etymology in \"Dial\". 103:5\u20136 linking the name of Satan to the \"apostate-serpent\". The Christology of the source is close to that of the \"Ascension of Isaiah\".\nCatechetical sources.\nJustin quotes many sayings of Jesus in \"1 Apol\". 15\u201317 and smaller sayings clusters in \"Dial\". 17:3\u20134; 35:3; 51:2\u20133; and 76:4\u20137. The sayings are most often harmonizations of Matthew and Luke that appear to be grouped together topically and organized into sayings collections, including material that probably originated from an early Christian catechism.\nThe following example of an ethical teaching On Swearing Oaths in \"1 Apol\". 16:5 shows a combination of sayings material found in Matthew and the Epistle of James:\nDo not swear at all (Mt 5:34). Let your Yes be Yes and your No be No (Jas 5:12). Everything beyond these is from evil (Mt 5:37).\nThe saying \"Let your Yes be Yes and your No be No\" from James 5:12 is interpolated into a sayings complex from Matthew 5:34,37. The text appears in a large number of Patristic quotations and twice in the Clementine Homilies (\"Hom\". 3:55, 19:2). Thus, it is likely that Justin was quoting this harmonized text from a catechism.\nThe harmonization of Matthew and Luke is evident in the following quotations of Mt 7:22\u201323 and Lk 13:26\u201327, which are used by Justin twice, in \"1 Apol\". 16:11 and \"Dial\". 76:5:\nMany will say to me, 'Lord, Lord, did we not in your name eat and drink and do powerful deeds?' And then I shall say to them, 'go away from me, workers of lawlessness'.\nMany will say to me on that day, 'Lord, Lord, did we not in your name eat and drink and prophecy and drive out demons?' And I shall say to them, 'go away from me'.\nIn both cases, Justin is using the same harmonized text of Matthew and Luke, although neither of the quotations includes the entire text of those gospel passages. The last phrase, \"workers of lawlessness\", has an exact parallel with 2 Clement 4:5. This harmonized text also appears in a large number of quotations by the Church Fathers. \"1 Apol\". 16:11 is part of a larger unit of sayings material in \"1 Apol\" 16:9\u201313 which combines a warning against being unprepared with a warning against false prophets. The entire unit is a carefully composed harmony of parallel texts from Matthew and Luke. This unit is part of a larger collection of sayings found in \"1 Apol\". 15\u201317 that appear to have originated from a catechism used by Justin's school in Rome, which may have had a wide circulation. Justin excerpted and rearranged the catechetical sayings material to create \"Apol\". 15\u201317 and parallel passages in the \"Dialogue\".\nOther sources.\nJustin includes a tract on Greek mythology in \"1 Apol\". 54 and \"Dial\". 69 which asserts that myths about various pagan deities are imitations of the prophecies about Christ in the Old Testament. There is also a small tract in \"1 Apol\". 59\u201360 on borrowings of the philosophers from Moses, particularly Plato. These two tracts may be from the same source, which may have been an early Christian \"Apology\".\nProphetic exegesis.\nJustin's writings constitute a storehouse of early interpretation of the prophetic Scriptures.\nBelief in prophecy.\nThe truth of the prophets, he declares, compels assent. He considered the Old Testament an inspired guide and counselor. He was converted by a Christian philosopher whom he paraphrased as saying:\n\"There existed, long before this time, certain men more ancient than all those who are esteemed philosophers, both righteous and beloved by God, who spoke by the Divine Spirit, and foretold events which would take place, and which are now taking place. They are called prophets. These alone both saw and announced the truth to men, neither reverencing nor fearing any man, not influenced by a desire for glory, but speaking those things alone which they saw and which they heard, being filled with the Holy Spirit. Their writings are still extant, and he who has read them is very much helped in his knowledge of the beginning and end of things. . . And those events which have happened, and those which are happening, compel you to assent to the utterances made by them.\"\nThen Justin told his own experience:\n\"Straightway a flame was kindled in my soul; and a love of the prophets, and of those men who are friends of Christ, possessed me; and whilst revolving his words in my mind, I found this philosophy alone to be safe and profitable.\"\nFulfillment.\nJustin listed the following events as fulfillments of Bible prophecy:\nSecond Advent and Daniel 7.\nJustin connected the Second Advent with the climax of the prophecy of Daniel 7:\n\"But if so great a power is shown to have followed and to be still following the dispensation of His suffering, how great shall that be which shall follow His glorious advent! For He shall come on the clouds as the Son of man, so Daniel foretold, and His angels shall come with Him. [Then follows Dan. 7:9\u201328.]\"\nAntichrist.\nThe second advent Justin placed close upon the heels of the appearance of the \"man of apostasy\", i.e., the Antichrist.\nTime, times, and a half.\nDaniel's \"time, times, and a half\", Justin believed, was nearing its consummation, when the Antichrist would speak his blasphemies against the Most High.\nEucharist.\nJustin's statements are some of the earliest Christian expressions on the Eucharist.\n\"And this food is called among us \u0395\u1f50\u03c7\u03b1\u03c1\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03af\u03b1 [the Eucharist] ... For not as common bread and common drink do we receive these; but in like manner as Jesus Christ our Saviour, having been made flesh by the Word of God, had both flesh and blood for our salvation, so likewise have we been taught that the food which is blessed by the prayer of His word, and from which our blood and flesh by transmutation are nourished, is the flesh and blood of that Jesus who was made flesh.\"\nVeneration.\nRelics.\nThe church of St. John the Baptist in Sacrofano, a few miles north of Rome, claims to have his relics.\nThe Church of the Jesuits in Valletta, Malta, founded by papal decree in 1592, also boasts relics of this second century Saint.\nAnother large reliquary holds a large piece of his bones at a private chapel in Malta that was originally brought from France from a private collection. The reliquary is sealed by a bishop from the 19th century and with saint Justin's bone there are saint Liberata and saint Innocent Martyrs.\nA case is also made that the relics of St. Justin are buried in Annapolis, Maryland. During a period of unrest in Italy, a noble family said to be in possession of his remains sent them in 1873 to a priest in Baltimore for safekeeping. They were displayed in St. Mary's Church for a period of time before they were again locked away for safekeeping. The remains were rediscovered and given a proper burial at St. Mary's, with Vatican approval, in 1989. It is now asserted that the bones were of St. Justin of the third century who was martyred during the persecution of Maximus.\nFeast day.\nIn 1882, Pope Leo XIII had a Mass and an Office composed for his feast day, which he set at 14 April, one day after the date of his death as indicated in the Martyrology of Florus; but since this date quite often falls within the main Paschal celebrations, the feast was moved in 1968 to 1 June, the date on which he has been celebrated in the Byzantine Rite since at least the 9th century.\nJustin is remembered in the Church of England with a Lesser Festival on 1 June.\nEditions.\nGreek texts:\nEnglish translations:\nGeorgian translation:\nCommentaries\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He was appointed Inquisitor for Poland and Saxony, later becoming the Grand Commissioner for indulgences in Germany. Tetzel was known for granting indulgences on behalf of the Catholic Church in exchange for tithes to the Church. Indulgences grant a degree of expiation of the punishments of purgatory due to sin. However, the misuse of indulgences within the Church largely contributed to Martin Luther writing his Ninety-five Theses. The main usage of the indulgences by Tetzel was to help fund and build the new St. Peter's Basilica in Rome.\nLife.\nTetzel was born in Pirna, Saxony, and studied theology and philosophy at Leipzig University. He entered the Dominican order in 1489, became a famous preacher, and was in 1502 commissioned by Cardinal Giovanni de' Medici, later Pope Leo X, to preach the Jubilee indulgence, which he did throughout his life. In 1509 he was made an inquisitor of Poland and in January 1517 was made commissioner of indulgences for Archbishop Albrecht von Brandenburg in the dioceses of Magdeburg and Halberstadt.\nHe acquired the degree of Licentiate of Sacred Theology in the University of Frankfurt an der Oder in 1517, and then of Doctor of Sacred Theology in 1518, by defending in two disputations the doctrine of indulgences against Martin Luther. The accusation that he had sold full forgiveness for sins not yet committed caused a great scandal. It was believed that all of the money that Tetzel raised was for the ongoing reconstruction of St. Peter's Basilica, although half the money went to the Archbishop of Mainz, Cardinal Albert of Brandenburg (under whose authority Tetzel was operating), to pay off the debts incurred in securing Albert's appointment to the archbishopric. Tetzel made much of his money by selling his indulgences throughout Leipzig. The way that he persuaded many people to buy his indulgences was offering access directly to heaven even for people who were already dead and in purgatory. He was very good at his job, which led him to be paid very well. Men would even announce, weeks in advance, his arrival to town. Luther did not agree with Tetzel's practices and began to preach openly against him. He was inspired to write his famous \"Ninety-five Theses\" in part due to Tetzel's actions. In the theses, he states,&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;27. They preach only human doctrines who say that as soon as the money clinks into the money chest, the soul flies out of purgatory.&lt;br&gt;\n28. It is certain that when money clinks in the money chest, greed and avarice can be increased; but when the church intercedes, the result is in the hands of God alone.\nTetzel was also accused, but exonerated, of immorality. When Karl von Miltitz accused him of perpetrating frauds and embezzlements, he withdrew to the Dominican monastery in Leipzig where, worn out by the controversies surrounding him, he died in 1519. Miltitz was later discredited to the point that his claims carry no historical weight.\nWhen Luther heard that Tetzel was mortally ill and on his deathbed, he wrote to comfort him and bade him \"not to be troubled, for the matter did not begin on his account, but the child had quite a different father.\"\nAfter his death, Tetzel was given an honorable burial and interred before the high altar of the Dominican Church in Leipzig.\nDoctrinal positions.\nTetzel overstated Catholic doctrine in regard to indulgences for the dead. He became known for a couplet attributed to him: \n&lt;poem&gt;\nAs soon as the gold in the casket rings\nThe rescued soul to heaven springs\n&lt;/poem&gt;\nThis oft-quoted saying was by no means representative of the official Catholic teaching on indulgences, but rather, more a reflection of Tetzel's capacity to exaggerate. Yet if Tetzel overstated the matter in regard to indulgences for the dead, his teaching on indulgences for the living was pure Catholic teaching. The German Catholic historian Ludwig von Pastor explains:\nAbove all, a most clear distinction must be made between indulgences for the living and those for the dead.&lt;br&gt;\nAs regards indulgences for the living, Tetzel always taught pure (Catholic) doctrine. The assertion that he put forward indulgences as being not only a remission of the temporal punishment of sin but as a remission of its guilt, is as unfounded as is that other accusation against him, that he sold the forgiveness of sin for money, without even any mention of contrition and confession, or that, for payment, he absolved from sins which might be committed in the future. His teaching was, in fact, very definite, and quite in harmony with the theology of the (Catholic) Church, as it was then and as it is now, i.e., that indulgences \"apply only to the temporal punishment due to sins which have been already repented of and confessed\"...\nThe case was very different from indulgences for the dead. As regards these there is no doubt that Tetzel did, according to what he considered his authoritative instructions, proclaim as Christian doctrine that nothing but an offering of money was required to gain the indulgence for the dead, without there being any question of contrition or confession. He also taught, in accordance with the opinion then held, that an indulgence could be applied to any given soul with unfailing effect. Starting from this assumption, there is no doubt that his doctrine was virtually that of the well known drastic proverb.\nThe Papal Bull of indulgence gave no sanction whatever to this proposition. It was a vague scholastic opinion, rejected by the Sorbonne in 1482, and again in 1518, and certainly not a doctrine of the Church, which was thus improperly put forward as dogmatic truth. The first among the theologians of the Roman court, Cardinal Cajetan, was the enemy of all such extravagances and declared emphatically that, even if theologians and preachers taught such opinions, no faith need be given them. \"Preachers\", he said, \"speak in the name of the Church only so long as they proclaim the doctrine of Christ and His Church; but if, for purposes of their own, they teach that about which they know nothing, and which is only their own imagination, they must not be accepted as mouthpieces of the Church. No one must be surprised if such as these fall into error.\"\nLuther's impression.\nLuther claimed Tetzel had received a substantial amount of money at Leipzig from a nobleman, who asked him for a letter of indulgence for a future sin he would commit. Supposedly Tetzel answered in the affirmative, insisting that the payment had to be made at once. The nobleman did so and received a letter and seal from Tetzel.\nHowever, when Tetzel left Leipzig, the nobleman attacked him along the way and gave him a thorough beating, sending him back empty-handed to Leipzig, saying that was the future sin which he had in mind. Duke George at first was quite furious about the incident, but when he heard the whole story, he let it go without punishing the nobleman.\nIn popular culture.\nTetzel has been portrayed on stage and screen by the following:\nReferences.\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It was not publicly known until 1977 that James Tiptree Jr. was a pen name of a woman, which she used from 1967 until her death. From 1974 to 1985, she also occasionally used the pen name Raccoona Sheldon. Tiptree was inducted into the Science Fiction Hall of Fame in 2012.\nTiptree's debut story collection, \"Ten Thousand Light-Years from Home\", was published in 1973 and her first novel, \"Up the Walls of the World\", was published in 1978. Her other works include the 1973 novelette \"The Women Men Don't See\", the 1974 novella \"The Girl Who Was Plugged In\", the 1976 novella \"Houston, Houston, Do You Read?\", the 1985 novel \"Brightness Falls from the Air\", and the 1974 short story \"Her Smoke Rose Up Forever\".\nEarly life, family and education.\nAlice Hastings Bradley came from a family in the intellectual enclave of Hyde Park, a university neighborhood in Chicago. Her father was Herbert Edwin Bradley, a lawyer and naturalist, and her mother was Mary Hastings Bradley, a prolific writer of fiction and travel books. From an early age she traveled with her parents, and in 1921\u201322, the family made their first trip to central Africa. During these trips, she played the role of the \"perfect daughter, willing to be carried across Africa like a parcel, always neatly dressed and well behaved, a credit to her mother.\" This later contributed to her short story, \"The Women Men Don't See.\"\nShe is the title character in two non-fiction accounts by her mother of their travels: \"Alice in Jungleland\" (1927) and \"Alice in Elephantland\" (1929). These were both travel books for children which included photos of young Alice visiting parts of Africa not yet fully discovered by Westerners. The illustrated cover of \"Alice in Jungleland\" is credited to Alice Hastings Bradley.\nBetween trips to Africa, Bradley attended school in Chicago. At the age of ten, she went to the University of Chicago Laboratory Schools, which was an experimental teaching workshop with small classes and loose structure. When she was fourteen, she was sent to finishing school in Lausanne in Switzerland, before returning to the US to attend boarding school in Tarrytown in New York.\nAdulthood and early career: 1934\u20131967.\nBradley was encouraged by her mother to seek a career, but her mother also hoped that she would get married and settle down. In 1934, at age 19, she met William (Bill) Davey and eloped to marry him. She dropped out of Sarah Lawrence College, which did not allow married students to attend. They moved to Berkeley, California, where they took classes and Davey encouraged her to pursue art. The marriage was not a success; he was an alcoholic and irresponsible with money and she disliked keeping house. The couple divorced in 1940. Later on, she became a graphic artist, a painter, and\u2014still under the name \"Alice Bradley Davey\"\u2014an art critic for the \"Chicago Sun\" between 1941 and 1942.\nAfter the divorce, Bradley joined the Women's Army Auxiliary Corps where she became a supply officer. In 1942 she joined the United States Army Air Forces and worked in the Army Air Forces photo-intelligence group. She later was promoted to major, a high rank for women at the time. In the army, she \"felt she was among free women for the first time.\" As an intelligence officer, she became an expert in reading aerial intelligence photographs.\nIn 1945, at the close of the war, while she was on assignment in Paris, she married her second husband, Huntington D. Sheldon, known as \"Ting.\" She was discharged from the military in 1946, at which time she set up a small business in partnership with her husband. The same year, a non-fiction piece about Polish refugees working in Germany (entitled \"The Lucky Ones\") was published in the November 16, 1946 issue of \"The New Yorker\", and credited to \"Alice Bradley\" in the magazine. In 1952 she and her husband were invited to join the CIA, which she accepted. At the CIA, she worked as an intelligence officer, but she did not enjoy the work. She resigned her position in 1955 and returned to college.\nShe studied for her bachelor of arts degree at American University (1957\u20131959). She received a doctorate from George Washington University in Experimental Psychology in 1967. She wrote her doctoral dissertation on the responses of animals to novel stimuli in differing environments. During this time, she wrote and submitted a few science fiction stories under the name James Tiptree Jr., in order to protect her academic reputation.\nArt career.\nBradley began illustrating when she was nine years old, contributing to her mother's book, \"Alice in Elephantland\", a children's book about the family's second trip to Africa, appearing in it as herself. She later had an exhibit of her drawings of Africa at the Chicago Gallery, arranged by her parents. Although she illustrated several of her mother's books, she only sold one illustration during her lifetime, in 1931, to \"The New Yorker\", with help from Harold Ober, a New York agent who worked with her mother. The illustration, of a horse rearing and throwing off its rider, sold for ten dollars.\nIn 1936, Bradley participated in a group show at the Art Institute of Chicago, to which she had connections through her family, featuring new American work. This was an important step forward for her painting career. During this time she also took private art lessons from John Sloan. Bradley disliked prudery in painting. While examining an anatomy book for an art class, she noticed that the genitals were blurred, so she restored the genitals of the figures with a pencil.\nIn 1939, her nude self-portrait titled \"Portrait in the Country\" was accepted for the \"All-American\" biennial show at the Corcoran Gallery in Washington D.C., where it was displayed for six weeks. While these two shows were considered big breaks, she disparaged these accomplishments, saying that \"only second rate painters sold\" and she preferred to keep her works at home.\nBy 1940, Bradley felt she had mastered all the techniques she needed and was ready to choose her subject matter. However, she began to doubt whether she should paint. She kept working at her painting techniques, fascinated with the questions of form, and read books on aesthetics in order to know what scientifically made a painting \"good.\" She stopped painting in 1941. As she was in need of a way to support herself, her parents helped her find a job as an art critic for the \"Chicago Sun\".\nScience fiction career: 1967\u20131987.\nBradley discovered science fiction in 1924, when she read her first issue of \"Weird Tales,\" but she didn't write any herself until years later. Unsure what to do with her new degrees and her new/old careers, she began to write science fiction. She adopted the pseudonym of James Tiptree Jr. in 1967. The name \"Tiptree\" came from a branded jar of marmalade, and the \"Jr.\" was her husband's idea. In an interview, she said: \"A male name seemed like good camouflage. I had the feeling that a man would slip by less observed. I've had too many experiences in my life of being the first woman in some damned occupation.\" She also made the choice to start writing science fiction she, herself, was interested in and \"was surprised to find that her stories were immediately accepted for publication and quickly became popular.\"\nHer first published short story was \"Birth of a Salesman\" in the March 1968 issue of \"Analog Science Fact &amp; Fiction\", edited by John W. Campbell. Three more followed that year in \"If\" and \"Fantastic\". She continued to work as James Tiptree, Jr, keeping the identity a closely guarded secret, never attending book signings, science fiction conventions, or having in-person or even phone contact with agents or editors. For close to a decade, Tiptree worked exclusively in the field of science fiction short stories, publishing several stories each year in various magazines, usually to acclaim within the industry. In 1974, Sheldon also started submitting stories to various outlets as \"Raccoona Sheldon\", but was not successful getting published until her other alter ego, Tiptree, wrote to publishers to intervene. After that, for a short time, the two personas were both selling work to various magazines.\nThe Tiptree pseudonym was successfully maintained until late 1977, partly because, although \"Tiptree\" was widely known to be a pseudonym, it was generally understood that its use was intended to protect the professional reputation of an intelligence community official. Readers, editors and correspondents were permitted to assume gender, and generally, but not invariably, they assumed \"male\". There was speculation, based partially on the themes in her stories, that Tiptree might be female. In 1975, in the introduction to \"Warm Worlds and Otherwise,\" a collection of Tiptree's short stories, Robert Silverberg wrote: \"[i]t has been suggested that Tiptree is female, a theory that I find absurd, for there is to me something ineluctably masculine about Tiptree's writing.\" Silverberg also likened Tiptree's writing to Ernest Hemingway's, arguing there was a \"prevailing masculinity about both of them\u2014that preoccupation with questions of courage, with absolute values, with the mysteries and passions of life and death as revealed by extreme physical tests, by pain and suffering and loss.\"&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\n[Tiptree's work is] proof of what she said, that men and women can and do speak both to and for one another, if they have bothered to learn how.\n \u2014Ursula K. Le Guin, \"Khatru\"\n\"Tiptree\" never made any public appearances, but she did correspond regularly with fans and other science fiction authors through the mail. When asked for biographical details, Tiptree/Sheldon was forthcoming in everything but her gender. According to her biographer, Julie Phillips, \"No one had ever seen or spoken to the owner of this voice. He wrote letters, warm, frank, funny letters, to other writers, editors, and science fiction fans\". In her letters to fellow writers such as Ursula K. Le Guin and Joanna Russ, she would present herself as a feminist man; however, Sheldon did not present herself as male in person. Writing was a way to escape a male-dominated society, themes Tiptree explored in the short stories later collected in \"Her Smoke Rose Up Forever\". One story in particular offers an excellent illustration of these themes. \"Houston, Houston, Do You Read?\" follows a group of astronauts who discover a future Earth whose male population has been wiped out; the remaining females have learned to get along just fine in their absence.\nIn 1976, \"Tiptree\" mentioned in a letter that \"his\" mother, also a writer, had died in Chicago\u2014details that led inquiring fans to find the obituary, with its reference to Alice Sheldon; soon all was revealed. Once the initial shock was over, Sheldon wrote to Le Guin, one of her closest friends, confessing her identity. She wrote, \"I never wrote you anything but the exact truth, there was no calculation or intent to deceive, other than the signature which over 8 years became just another nickname; everything else is just plain me. The thing is, I am a 61-year-old woman named Alice Sheldon\u2014nickname Alli\u2014solitary by nature but married for 37 years to a very nice man considerably older [Huntington was 12 years her senior], who doesn't read my stuff but is glad I like writing\".\nAfter Sheldon's identity was revealed, several prominent science fiction writers suffered some embarrassment. Robert Silverberg, who had argued that Tiptree could not be a woman from the evidence of her stories, added a postscript to his introduction to the second edition of Tiptree's \"Warm Worlds and Otherwise\", published in 1979. Harlan Ellison had introduced Tiptree's story in the anthology \"Again, Dangerous Visions\" with the opinion that \"[Kate] Wilhelm is the woman to beat this year, but Tiptree is the man\".\nOnly then did she complete her first full-length novel, \"Up the Walls of the World\", which was a Doubleday Science Fiction Book Club selection. Before that she had worked on and built a reputation only in the field of short stories.\nAfter the revelation of her real identity, Sheldon continued to use the Tiptree name on her fiction for the rest of her life, with the exception of one further short story credited to \"Raccoona Sheldon\".\nThemes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\n\"Tip\" was a crucial part of modern SF's maturing process \u2026 \"He\"\u2026 wrote powerful fiction challenging readers' assumptions about everything, especially sex and gender.\n \u2014Suzy McKee Charnas, \"The Women's Review of Books\"\nA constant theme in Sheldon's work is gender; she was influenced by the rise of second-wave feminism. A strong example is \"The Women Men Don't See\" (1973), where Sheldon, as in most of her stories, devises a convincing male point of view. We see the two women in the story (Ruth Parsons and her daughter) through the eyes of Don Fenton, who assesses them critically as possible sexual partners and is also concerned to protect them. He is confused when Ruth shows courage and common sense, failing to \"fulfill stereotypical female roles,\" according to Anne Cranny-Francis. Ruth tries to explain the alienation of women in general and herself in particular, but to Fenton it seems nonsense. The Parsons' decision to leave Earth on an alien spaceship jars him into, if not understanding, at least remembering Ruth's words. The title of the short story itself reflects the idea that women are invisible during Sheldon's time. As Cranny-Francis states, \"'The Women Men Don't See' is an outstanding example\u00a0\u2026 of the subversive use of genre fiction to produce an unconventional discursive position, the feminist subject.\"\nDeath and legacy.\nSheldon continued writing under the Tiptree pen name for another decade. In the last years of her life, she suffered from depression and heart trouble, while her husband began to lose his eyesight, becoming almost completely blind in 1986. In 1976, then 61-year-old Sheldon wrote to Silverberg expressing her desire to end her own life while she was still able-bodied and active; she said that she was reluctant to act upon this intention, as she did not want to leave her husband behind and could not bring herself to kill him. Later, she suggested to her husband that they make a suicide pact when their health began to fail. On July 21, 1977, she wrote in her diary: \"Ting agreed to consider suicide in 4\u20135 years\".\nTen years later, on May 19, 1987, Sheldon shot her husband and then herself; she telephoned her attorney after the first shooting to announce her actions. They were found dead, hand-in-hand in bed, in their Virginia home. According to biographer Julie Phillips, the suicide note Sheldon left was written in September 1979 and saved until needed. Although the circumstances surrounding the Sheldons' deaths are not clear enough to rule out caregiver murder\u2013suicide (in that perhaps her husband was not ready to die), testimony of those closest to them suggests a suicide pact.\nSexual orientation.\nSheldon was attracted to women throughout her life and described herself as a lesbian in the years before her death. In 1980 she wrote to Joanna Russ and stated \"I am a Lesbian [\"sic\"] [...] I like some men a lot, but from the start, before I knew anything it was always girls and women who lit me up\". Sheldon had affairs with men and \"passionate crushes\" on women during her first marriage, and later remarked \"the 2 or 3 great loves of my life were girls\".\nJames Tiptree Jr. Award.\nThe James Tiptree Jr. Award, honoring works of science fiction and fantasy that expand or explore the understanding of gender, was created by authors Karen Joy Fowler and Pat Murphy in February 1991. Works of fiction such as \"Half Life\" by Shelley Jackson and \"Light\" by M. John Harrison have received the award. Due to controversy over the circumstances of her and her husband's deaths, the name of the award was changed to the Otherwise Award in 2019.\nWorks.\nShort story collections.\nThe abbreviation(s) after each title indicate its appearance in one or more of the following collections:\nAwards and honors.\nThe Science Fiction Hall of Fame inducted Tiptree in 2012. She also won several annual awards for particular works of fiction (typically the preceding calendar year's best):\nJapanese-language translations of her fiction also won two Hayakawa Awards and three Seiun Awards as the year's best under changing designations (foreign, overseas, translated).

{"id": "16413", "revid": "4904587", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=16413", "title": "Otherwise Award", "text": "Annual American literary prize\nThe Otherwise Award, originally known as the James Tiptree Jr. Award, is an American annual literary prize for works of science fiction or fantasy that expand or explore one's understanding of gender. It was initiated in February 1991 by science fiction authors Pat Murphy and Karen Joy Fowler, subsequent to a discussion at WisCon, a feminist SF conference.\nIn addition to the award itself, the judges publish an Honor List, which they describe as \"a strong part of the award's identity\", \"used by many readers as a recommended reading list\".\nIn 2024, the award administrators announced that they would be switching from a single winner each year to a shortlist of three to six winners.\nThe award was originally named for Alice B. Sheldon, who wrote under the pseudonym James Tiptree Jr. Due to controversy over the appropriateness of naming an award after Tiptree, the committee administering the award announced on October 13, 2019, that the award would be renamed the Otherwise Award.\nBackground.\nChoice of the Tiptree name.\nBy choosing a masculine \"nom de plume\", having her stories accepted under that name and winning awards with them, Alice Sheldon helped demonstrate that the division between male and female science fiction writing was illusory. Years after \"Tiptree\" first published science fiction, Sheldon wrote some work under the female pen name \"Raccoona Sheldon\"; later, the science fiction world discovered that \"Tiptree\" had been female all along. This discovery led to widespread discussion over which aspects of writing, if any, have an intrinsic gender. To remind audiences of the role gender plays in both reading and writing, the award was named in Sheldon's honor at the suggestion of Karen Joy Fowler.\nControversy and name change.\nIn 2019, controversy arose over the appropriateness of naming an award after Tiptree. In 1987, Alice Sheldon shot and killed her ailing husband Huntington Sheldon before killing herself in the same manner. Although some have called the killing a \"suicide pact\" based on Sheldon's personal writings, others characterize the act as \"caregiver murder\"\u2014i.e., the murder of a disabled person by the person responsible for caring for them. In light of these allegations, the Tiptree Motherboard received requests to change the name of the award. On September 2, 2019, in response to these requests, the Motherboard made a statement that \"a change to the name of the Tiptree Award is [not] warranted now\"; but nine days later, on September 11, they announced that the award \"can't go on under its existing name\".\nOn October 13, 2019, the Tiptree Motherboard released an announcement stating that the Tiptree Award would become the Otherwise Award. The name refers to \"the act of imagining gender otherwise\" at the core of what the award has always honored, as well as being \"wise to the experience of being the other\". The title also draws from the Black queer scholarship of Ashon Crawley around what is termed \"otherwise politics\". According to the statement, \"\"Otherwise\" means finding different directions to move in\u2014toward newly possible places, by means of emergent and multiple pathways and methods.\"\nAdministration.\nThe Tiptree award is administered by the Tiptree \"Motherboard\".\nFundraising efforts for the Tiptree have included publications (two cookbooks), \"feminist bake sales\", and auctions. The Tiptree cookbook \"The Bakery Men Don't See\", edited by WisCon co-founder Jeanne Gomoll, was nominated for a 1992 Hugo Award. Tiptree Award juries traditionally consist of four female and one male juror (the \"token man\"). The auctions were one of the keynote events of WisCon, and they were run by author Ellen Klages from their inception in 1994 until 2016. A variety of items were auctioned, ranging from signed first editions of art or written works by SF luminaries and authors, such as Octavia Butler, Ursula K. Le Guin, Suzette Haden Elgin, Freddie Baer, and many others, to quirky items with some connection to feminism, science fiction, or fandom, such as a hand-knitted uteruses created by Klages, letters, photos, memorabilia, toys, and art. Artist Freddie Baer produced an annual collage, which was printed on t-shirts and posters, in support of the organization.\nIn 2011, the Tiptree Motherboard received the Science Fiction Research Association's Thomas D. Clareson Award for Distinguished Service for its \"outstanding service activities \u2013 promotion of SF teaching and study, editing, reviewing, editorial writing, publishing, organizing meetings, mentoring, and leadership in SF/fantasy organizations\".\nAnthologies.\nSelections of the winners, various short-listed fiction, and essays have appeared in four Tiptree-related collections, \"Flying Cups and Saucers\" (1999) and a series of annual anthologies published by Tachyon Publications of San Francisco.

Founded in 1897 by a group of Turinese students, the club played in different grounds around the city, and has played in the Juventus Stadium since 2011.\nNicknamed (\"the Old Lady\"), it has won 36 official league titles, 15 Coppa Italia trophies and nine Italian Super Cups, being the record holder for all these competitions; they also hold two Intercontinental Cups, two European Cup / UEFA Champions Leagues, one European Cup Winners' Cup, three UEFA Cups (Italian record), two UEFA Super Cups and one UEFA Intertoto Cup (Italian record). Consequently, the side leads the historical Federazione Italiana Giuoco Calcio (FIGC) classification, whilst on the international stage the club occupies the sixth position in Europe and the twelfth in the world for most confederation titles won with eleven trophies, as well as the fourth in the all-time Union of European Football Associations (UEFA) competitions ranking, having obtained the highest coefficient score during seven seasons since its introduction in 1979, the most for an Italian team in both cases and joint second overall in the last cited.\nFounded with the name of Sport-Club Juventus, initially as an athletics club, it is the second oldest of its kind still active in the country after Genoa's football section (1893) and has competed every season of the premier club division (reformulated in different formats until the Serie A inception in 1929) since its debut in 1900 with the exception of the 2006\u201307 season, being managed by the industrial Agnelli family almost continuously since 1923. The relationship between the club and that dynasty is the oldest and longest in national sports, making Juventus one of the first professional sporting clubs \"ante litteram\" in the country, having established itself as a major force in the national stage since the 1930s and at confederation level since the mid-1970s, and becoming, in a nearly stable basis, one of the top-ten wealthiest in world football in terms of value, revenue and profit since the mid-1990s, being listed on the Borsa Italiana since 2001.\nUnder the management of Giovanni Trapattoni, the club won 13 trophies in the ten years before 1986, including six league titles and five international tournaments, and became the first to win all three seasonal competitions organised by the Union of European Football Associations: the 1976\u201377 UEFA Cup (first Southern European side to do so), the 1983\u201384 Cup Winners' Cup and the 1984\u201385 European Champions' Cup. With successive triumphs in the 1984 European Super Cup and 1985 Intercontinental Cup, it became the first and thus far only in the world to complete a clean sweep of all five historical confederation trophies; an achievement that they revalidated with the title won in the 1999 UEFA Intertoto Cup after another successful era led by Marcello Lippi, becoming in addition, until 2022, the only professional Italian club to have won every ongoing honour available to the first team and organised by a national or international football association. In December 2000, Juventus was placed seventh in the FIFA's historic ranking of the best clubs in the world, and nine years later was ranked second best club in Europe during the 20th century based on a statistical study series by the International Federation of Football History &amp; Statistics (IFFHS), the highest for an Italian club in both.\nThe club's fan base is the largest at the national level and one of the largest worldwide. Unlike most European sporting supporters' groups, which are often concentrated around their own club's city of origin, it is widespread throughout the whole country and the Italian diaspora, making Juventus a symbol of \"anticampanilismo\" (\"anti-parochialism\") and (\"Italianness\"). Juventus players have won eight Ballon d'Or awards, four of these in consecutive years (1982\u20131985, an overall joint record), among these Michel Platini as well as three of the five recipients with Italian nationality as the first player representing Serie A, Omar S\u00edvori, and the former member of the youth sector Paolo Rossi; they have also won four FIFA World Player of the Year awards, with winners as Roberto Baggio and Zinedine Zidane, a national record and third and joint second highest overall, respectively, in the cited prizes. Finally, the club has also provided the most players to the Italy national team\u2014mostly in official competitions in almost uninterrupted way since 1924\u2014who often formed the group that led the \"Azzurri\" squad to international success, most importantly in the 1934, 1982 and 2006 FIFA World Cups.\nHistory.\nEarly years (1897\u20131918).\nJuventus was founded as Sport-Club Juventus in late 1897 by pupils from the Massimo d'Azeglio Lyceum school in Turin, among them Eugenio Canfari and Enrico Canfari. It was renamed as Foot-Ball Club Juventus two years later. The club joined the 1900 Italian Football Championship. Juventus played their first Italian Football Championship match on 11 March 1900 in a 1\u20130 defeat against Torinese.\nIn 1904, businessman Marco Ajmone-Marsan revived the finances of Juventus, making it possible to transfer the training field from piazza d'armi to the more appropriate Velodrome Umberto I. During this period, the team wore a pink and black kit. Juventus first won the 1905 Italian Football Championship while playing at their Velodrome Umberto I ground. By this time, the club colours had changed to black and white stripes, inspired by English side Notts County.\nThere was a split at the club in 1906, after some of the staff considered moving Juve out of Turin. Alfred Dick, the club's president, was unhappy with this, and left with some prominent players to found FBC Torino, which in turn spawned the \"Derby della Mole\". Juventus spent much of this period steadily rebuilding after the split, surviving the First World War.\nIn 1913, Juventus was relegated to the second division after ended in last place, but after pressure made by their executives to the Italian Federation, it was decided to increase the number of teams in the following season, that permitted Juventus to remain in the top league.\nLeague dominance (1923\u20131980).\nIn 1922, a new stadium was inaugurated and, a year later, FIAT vice president Edoardo Agnelli was elected club's president. These two events helped the club to its second league championship in the 1925\u201326 Prima Divisione, after beating Alba Roma in a two-legged final with an aggregate score of 12\u20131. The club established itself as a major force in Italian football in the 1930s, becoming the country's first professional club and the first with a decentralised fan base. This led Juventus to win a record of five consecutive Italian football championships and form the core of the Italy national football team during the Vittorio Pozzo era, including the 1934 FIFA World Cup winning squad, with star players like Raimundo Orsi, Luigi Bertolini, Giovanni Ferrari, and Luis Monti, among others.\nJuventus moved to the Stadio Comunale, but for the rest of the 1930s and the majority of the 1940s they were unable to recapture championship dominance. After the Second World War, Gianni Agnelli was appointed president. In the late 1940s and early 1950s, the club added two more league championships to its name, winning the 1949\u201350 Serie A under the management of Englishman Jesse Carver, and then repeating in the 1951\u201352 Serie A. For the 1957\u201358 Serie A, two new strikers, Welshman John Charles and Italian Argentine Omar S\u00edvori, were signed to play alongside longtime member Giampiero Boniperti. In the 1959\u201360 Juventus F.C. season, they beat Fiorentina to complete their first league and cup double, winning the 1959\u201360 Serie A and the 1960 Coppa Italia final. Boniperti retired in 1961 as the all-time top scorer at the club, with 182 goals in all competitions, a club record that stood for 45 years.\nDuring the rest of the decade, the club only won the 1966\u201367 Serie A. The 1970s saw Juventus further solidify their strong position in Italian football, and under former player \u010cestm\u00edr Vycp\u00e1lek they won the \"scudetto\" in the 1971\u201372 Serie A, and followed through in the 1972\u201373 Serie A, with players like as Roberto Bettega, Franco Causio, and Jos\u00e9 Altafini breaking through. During the rest of the decade, they won the league thrice more, with defender Gaetano Scirea contributing significantly. The latter two success in Serie A was under Giovanni Trapattoni, who also led the club to their first ever major European title, the 1976\u201377 UEFA Cup, and helped the club's domination continue on into the early part of the 1980s.\nEuropean stage (1980\u20131993).\nem; top:-0.65em; width:10em; line-height:1.4em; white-space:nowrap\"&gt;Tacconi\nem; top:-0.65em; width:10em; line-height:1.4em; white-space:nowrap\"&gt;Scirea (c)\nem; top:-0.65em; width:10em; line-height:1.4em; white-space:nowrap\"&gt;Favero\nem; top:-0.65em; width:10em; line-height:1.4em; white-space:nowrap\"&gt;Brio\nem; top:-0.65em; width:10em; line-height:1.4em; white-space:nowrap\"&gt;Cabrini\nem; top:-0.65em; width:10em; line-height:1.4em; white-space:nowrap\"&gt;Bonini\nem; top:-0.65em; width:10em; line-height:1.4em; white-space:nowrap\"&gt;Tardelli\nem; top:-0.65em; width:10em; line-height:1.4em; white-space:nowrap\"&gt;Briaschi\nem; top:-0.65em; width:10em; line-height:1.4em; white-space:nowrap\"&gt;Platini\nem; top:-0.65em; width:10em; line-height:1.4em; white-space:nowrap\"&gt;Rossi\nem; top:-0.65em; width:10em; line-height:1.4em; white-space:nowrap\"&gt;Boniek\n1985 European Cup final starting lineup\nThe club led under Trapattoni in the 1980s brought them the league title three more times by 1984. This meant Juventus had won 20 Italian league titles and were allowed to add a second golden star to their shirt, becoming the first Italian club to achieve this. Around this time, the club's players were attracting considerable attention, and Paolo Rossi was named European Footballer of the Year following his contribution to Italy's victory in the 1982 FIFA World Cup, where he was named Player of the Tournament.\nFrenchman Michel Platini was awarded the European Footballer of the Year title for three years in a row in 1983, 1984 and 1985, which is a record at that time. Juventus are the first and one of the only two clubs to have players from their club winning the award in four consecutive years. It was Platini who scored the winning goal in the 1985 European Cup final against Liverpool; this was marred by the Heysel Stadium disaster, which changed European football. That year, Juventus became the first club in the history of European football to have won all three major UEFA competitions; after their triumph in the 1985 Intercontinental Cup, the club also became the first and thus far the only in association football history to have won all five possible confederation competitions, an achievement that it revalidated with a sixth title won in the [[1999 UEFA Intertoto Cup]].\nWith the exception of winning the closely contested [[1985\u201386 Serie A]], the rest of the 1980s were not very successful for the club. As well as having to contend with [[Diego Maradona]]'s [[S.S.C. Napoli|Napoli]], both of the Milanese clubs, [[A.C. Milan]] and [[Inter Milan]], won Italian championships; Juventus achieved a double by winning the [[1989\u201390 Coppa Italia]] and the [[1990 UEFA Cup final]] under the guidance of former club legend [[Dino Zoff]]. In 1990, Juventus also moved into their new home, the [[Stadio delle Alpi]], which was built for the [[1990 FIFA World Cup]]. Despite the arrival of Italian star [[Roberto Baggio]] later that year for a [[world football transfer record fee]], the early 1990s under [[Luigi Maifredi]] and subsequently Trapattoni once again also saw little success for Juventus, as they only managed to win the [[1993 UEFA Cup final]].\nRenewed international success (1994\u20132004).\n[[File:Soccer Field Transparant.svg|200px]]\nem; top:-0.65em; width:10em; line-height:1.4em; white-space:nowrap\"&gt;[[Angelo Peruzzi|Peruzzi]]\nem; top:-0.65em; width:10em; line-height:1.4em; white-space:nowrap\"&gt;[[Ciro Ferrara|Ferrara]]\nem; top:-0.65em; width:10em; line-height:1.4em; white-space:nowrap\"&gt;[[Pietro Vierchowod|Vierchowod]]\nem; top:-0.65em; width:10em; line-height:1.4em; white-space:nowrap\"&gt;[[Moreno Torricelli|Torricelli]]\nem; top:-0.65em; width:10em; line-height:1.4em; white-space:nowrap\"&gt;[[Gianluca Pessotto|Pessotto]]\nem; top:-0.65em; width:10em; line-height:1.4em; white-space:nowrap\"&gt;[[Paulo Sousa|Sousa]]\nem; top:-0.65em; width:10em; line-height:1.4em; white-space:nowrap\"&gt;[[Antonio Conte|Conte]]\nem; top:-0.65em; width:10em; line-height:1.4em; white-space:nowrap\"&gt;[[Didier Deschamps|Deschamps]]\nem; top:-0.65em; width:10em; line-height:1.4em; white-space:nowrap\"&gt;[[Fabrizio Ravanelli|Ravanelli]]\nem; top:-0.65em; width:10em; line-height:1.4em; white-space:nowrap\"&gt;[[Alessandro Del Piero|Del Piero]]\nem; top:-0.65em; width:10em; line-height:1.4em; white-space:nowrap\"&gt;[[Gianluca Vialli|Vialli (c)]]\n[[1996 Champions League final]] starting lineup\n[[Marcello Lippi]] took over as Juventus manager at the start of the [[1994\u201395 Serie A]]. His first season at the helm of the club was a successful one, as Juventus recorded their first Serie A championship title since the mid-1980s, as well as the [[1995 Coppa Italia final]]. The crop of players during this period featured [[Ciro Ferrara]], [[Roberto Baggio]], [[Gianluca Vialli]], and a young [[Alessandro Del Piero]]. Lippi led Juventus to the [[1995 Supercoppa Italiana]] and the [[1995\u201396 UEFA Champions League]], beating [[AFC Ajax|Ajax]] on penalties after a 1\u20131 draw in which [[Fabrizio Ravanelli]] scored for Juventus.\nThe club did not rest long after winning the European Cup, as more highly regarded players were brought into the fold in the form of [[Zinedine Zidane]], [[Filippo Inzaghi]], and [[Edgar Davids]]. At home, Juventus won the [[1996\u201397 Serie A]], successfully defended their title in the [[1997\u201398 Serie A]], won the [[1996 UEFA Super Cup]], and followed through with the [[1996 Intercontinental Cup]]. Juventus reached two consecutive [[Champions League finals]] during this period but lost out to [[Borussia Dortmund]] and [[Real Madrid]], respectively in 1997 and 1998.\nAfter a two-and-a-half-season absence, Lippi returned to the club in 2001, following his replacement [[Carlo Ancelotti]]'s dismissal, signing big name players like [[Gianluigi Buffon]], [[David Trezeguet]], [[Pavel Nedv\u011bd]], and [[Lilian Thuram]], helping the team to win the [[2001\u201302 Serie A]], which was their first since 1998, and confirmed themselves in the [[2002\u201303 Serie A]]. Juventus were also part of the all Italian [[2003 UEFA Champions League final]] but lost out to Milan on penalties after the game ended in a 0\u20130 draw. At the conclusion of the following season, Lippi was appointed as the Italy national team's head coach, bringing an end to one of the most fruitful managerial spells in Juventus's history.\n\"Calciopoli\" scandal (2004\u20132007).\nIn 2004, [[Fabio Capello]] was appointed head coach of Juventus and led the team to first-place finishes in the [[2004\u201305 Serie A|2004\u201305]] and [[2005\u201306 Serie A]] seasons. In May 2006, Juventus was implicated in the \"[[Calciopoli]]\" scandal, a major investigation into alleged sporting fraud involving several Italian football clubs. As a result, in July 2006, the club was relegated to Serie B for the first time in its history and stripped of its 2004\u201305 Serie A title. After a period of legal deliberation, the 2005\u201306 title was awarded to third-placed Inter Milan.\nThe decisions surrounding Calciopoli remain a subject of ongoing debate and controversy. Although Juventus executives [[Luciano Moggi]] and Antonio Giraudo received lifetime bans from football, subsequent legal proceedings in ordinary courts did not find Juventus, as a club, guilty of criminal wrongdoing. Nonetheless, the club chose not to pursue an appeal in Italian civil courts. This decision came after FIFA threatened to suspend the Italian Football Federation (FIGC) and ban Italian clubs from international competitions if the matter was not resolved within the sport\u2019s internal justice system. Critics have questioned various aspects of the process, including the reasoning behind Juventus\u2019s relegation, such as the use of an ad hoc regulation and the cited \"sentimento popolare\" (public sentiment). Further controversy has stemmed from later suggestions of possible misconduct involving other clubs, including Inter Milan, and from rulings that determined the 2004\u201305 championship had not been fixed.\n[[File:Super Gigi Buffon (Juventus) (2).jpg|thumb|Star goalkeeper [[Gianluigi Buffon]] was among a group of players who remained with the club following their demotion to Serie B in 2006.]]\nMany key players left following their relegation to Serie B, including Thuram, star striker [[Zlatan Ibrahimovi\u0107]], midfielders [[Emerson (footballer, born 1976)|Emerson]] and [[Patrick Vieira]], and defensive stalwarts [[Fabio Cannavaro]] and [[Gianluca Zambrotta]]; other big name players, such as Del Piero, Buffon, Trezeguet, and Nedv\u011bd, as well as the club's future defense core [[Giorgio Chiellini]], remained to help the club return to Serie A, while youngsters from the [[Campionato Nazionale Primavera|Primavera]] (youth team), such as [[Sebastian Giovinco]] and [[Claudio Marchisio]], were integrated into the first team. Juventus won the \"Cadetti\" title (Serie B championship) despite starting with a points deduction and gained promotion straight back up to the top division, with Del Piero claiming the top scorer award with 21 goals, as league winners after the [[2006\u201307 Serie B]] season.\nAs early as 2010, when many other clubs were implicated and Inter Milan, [[U.S. Livorno 1915|Livorno]], and Milan liable of direct Article 6 violations in the 2011 Palazzi Report, Juventus considered challenging the stripping of their \"scudetto\" from 2005 and the non-assignment of the 2006 title, dependent on the results of [[Calciopoli trials]] connected to the 2006 scandal. When former general manager [[Luciano Moggi]]'s conviction in criminal court in connection with the scandal was partially written off by the Supreme Court in March 2015, the club sued the FIGC for \u20ac443\u00a0million for damages caused by their 2006 relegation. Then-FIGC president [[Carlo Tavecchio]] offered to discuss reinstatement of the lost \"scudetti\" in exchange for Juventus dropping the lawsuit.\nIn September 2015, the Supreme Court released a 150-page document that explained its final ruling of the case, based on the controversial 2006 sports ruling, which did not take in consideration the other clubs involved because they could not be put on trial due to the statute of limitations, and it would be necessary to request and open a revocation of judgment pursuant to Article 39 of the Code of Sports Justice. Despite his remaining charges being cancelled without a new trial due to statute of limitations, the court confirmed that Moggi was actively involved in the sporting fraud, which was intended to favour Juventus and increase his own personal benefits according to \"[[La Gazzetta dello Sport]]\". As did the Naples court in 2012, the court commented that the developments and behavior of other clubs and executives were not investigated in depth. Once they exhausted their appeals in Italy's courts, both Moggi and Giraudo appealed to the [[European Court of Human Rights]] in March 2020; Giraudo's was accepted in September 2021. Juventus continued to present new appeals, which were declared inadmissible.\nReturn to Serie A (2007\u20132011).\nAfter making their comeback for the [[2007\u201308 Serie A]], Juventus appointed [[Claudio Ranieri]] as manager. They finished in third place in their first season back in the top flight and qualified for the [[2008\u201309 UEFA Champions League]]'s third qualifying round in the preliminary stages. Juventus reached the group stages, where they beat Real Madrid in both home and away legs, before losing in the knockout round to [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]]. Ranieri was sacked following a string of unsuccessful results and [[Ciro Ferrara]] was appointed as manager on a temporary basis for the last two games of the [[2008\u201309 Serie A]], before being subsequently appointed as the manager for the [[2009\u201310 Serie A]].\nFerrara's stint as Juventus manager proved to be unsuccessful, with Juventus knocked out of [[2009\u201310 UEFA Champions League]], and also of the [[2009\u201310 Coppa Italia]], as well as just lying on the sixth place in the league table at the end of January 2010, leading to the dismissal of Ferrara and the naming of [[Alberto Zaccheroni]] as caretaker manager. Zaccheroni could not help the side improve, as Juventus finished the season in seventh place in Serie A. For the [[2010\u201311 Serie A]], [[Jean-Claude Blanc]] was replaced by [[Andrea Agnelli]] as the club's president. Agnelli's first action was to replace Zaccheroni and director of sport [[Alessio Secco]] with [[Sampdoria]] manager [[Luigi Delneri]] and director of sport [[Giuseppe Marotta]]. Delneri failed to improve their fortunes and was dismissed, and former player and fan favourite [[Antonio Conte]], fresh after winning promotion with [[S.S. Robur Siena|Siena]], was named as Delneri's replacement. In September 2011, Juventus relocated to the new [[Juventus Stadium]], known as the Allianz Stadium since 2017.\nNine consecutive \"scudetti\" (2011\u20132020).\n[[File:Andrea Pirlo Juventus.jpg|left|thumb|Playmaker [[Andrea Pirlo]] playing for Juventus in 2012]]\nWith Conte as manager, Juventus were unbeaten for the entire [[2011\u201312 Serie A]] season. Towards the second half of the season, the team was mostly competing with northern rivals Milan for first place in a tight contest. Juventus won the title on the 37th matchday after beating [[Cagliari Calcio|Cagliari]] 2\u20130 and Milan losing to Inter 4\u20132. After a 3\u20131 win in the final matchday against [[Atalanta B.C.|Atalanta]], Juventus became the first team to go the season unbeaten in the current 38-game format. In [[2013\u201314 Serie A]], Juventus won a third consecutive \"scudetto\" with a record 102 points and 33 wins. The title was the 30th official league championship in the club's history. They also achieved the semi-finals of [[2013\u201314 UEFA Europa League]], where they were eliminated at home against ten-man [[Benfica]]'s \"[[catenaccio]]\", missing the [[2014 UEFA Europa League final]] at the Juventus Stadium.\n[[File:Juventus Coppa Italia 2017.jpg|thumb|Juventus captain [[Giorgio Chiellini]] receiving the [[2016\u201317 Coppa Italia]] from [[Sergio Mattarella]], the president of Italy]]\nIn the [[2014\u201315 Serie A]], [[Massimiliano Allegri]] was appointed as manager, with whom Juventus won their 31st official title, making it a fourth-straight, as well as achieving a record tenth [[Coppa Italia]], after beating [[S.S. Lazio|Lazio]] 2\u20132 in the [[2015 Coppa Italia final]], for the domestic double. The club also beat Real Madrid 3\u20132 on aggregate in the semi-finals of the [[2014\u201315 UEFA Champions League]] to face [[FC Barcelona|Barcelona]] in the [[2015 UEFA Champions League final]] in Berlin for the first time since the [[2002\u201303 UEFA Champions League]]. Juventus lost the final against Barcelona 3\u20131. In the [[2016 Coppa Italia final]], the club won the title for the 11th time and second straight win, becoming the first team in Italy's history to win Serie A and Coppa Italia doubles in back-to-back seasons. In the [[2017 Coppa Italia final]], Juventus won their 12th Coppa Italia title in a 2\u20130 win over Lazio, becoming the first team to win three consecutive titles. Four days later on 21 May, Juventus became the first team to win six consecutive Serie A titles. In the [[2017 UEFA Champions League final]], their second Champions League final in three years, Juventus were defeated 1\u20134 by defending champions Real Madrid; the [[2017 Turin stampede]] happened ten minutes before the end of the match. In the [[2018 Coppa Italia final]], Juventus won their 13th title and fourth in a row in a 4\u20130 win over Milan, extending the all-time record of successive Coppa Italia titles. Juventus then secured their seventh consecutive Serie A title, extending the all-time record of successive triumphs in the competition. \n[[File:Cristiano Ronaldo, 2010.jpg|thumb|Juventus's signing of [[Cristiano Ronaldo]] in 2018 elevated the club's popularity ]]\nJuventus, eager to secure the Champions League title, signed [[Cristiano Ronaldo]] for \u00a399.2 million from Real Madrid on 10 July 2018. In Italy, the signing was dubbed the \"deal of the century.\" For Juventus, the signing of Ronaldo went beyond football\u2014it represented a step toward elevating the club's status as a global business. [[Deloitte]] ranked the world's richest clubs earlier in the year and Juventus ranked 10th; by leveraging Ronaldo's massive social media following and commercial appeal, the club expected to close the financial gap with the likes of Real Madrid, Barcelona, and Manchester United. In the [[2018 Supercoppa Italiana]], which was held in January 2019, Juventus and Milan, who were tied for Supercoppa Italiana wins with seven each, played against each other; Juventus won their eight title after beating Milan 1\u20130. In April 2019, Juventus secured their eighth consecutive Serie A title, further extending the all-time record of successive triumphs in the competition. Following Allegri's departure, [[Maurizio Sarri]] was appointed manager of the club ahead of the [[2019\u201320 Juventus F.C. season|2019\u201320 season]]. Juventus were confirmed [[2019\u201320 Serie A]] champions, reaching an unprecedented milestone of nine consecutive league titles.\nRecent history (2020\u2013present).\nOn 8 August 2020, Sarri was sacked from his managerial position, one day after Juventus were eliminated from the [[2019\u201320 UEFA Champions League]] by [[Olympique Lyonnais|Lyon]]. On the same day, former player [[Andrea Pirlo]] was announced as the new coach, signing a two-year contract. With Inter Milan's win of the [[2020\u201321 Serie A]], Juventus's run of nine consecutive titles came to an end; the club managed to secure a fourth-place finish on the final day of the league, granting Juventus qualification to the following season's Champions League. Despite the fact Pirlo had won two seasonal trophies\u2014the Coppa Italia and the Supercoppa Italiana\u2014 he was sacked from his managerial position in late May 2021. Allegri agreed to return to the club as manager after two years away from management on a four-year contract. During the three seasons that featured Ronaldo, the Champions League all-time top scorer, Juventus disappointingly failed to win the Champions League. Ronaldo left the club for Manchester United in late August 2021.\nAlthough Allegri had considered the victory of the \"scudetto\" as a seasonal goal, Juventus reached another fourth place in the league. After losing 4\u20132 [[after extra time]] to Inter Milan in the [[2022 Coppa Italia final]], the [[2021\u201322 Juventus F.C. season]] marked the first season since 2010\u201311 in which the club had not won a trophy. In the [[2022\u201323 Juventus FC season|2022\u201323 season]], Juventus had one victory and five defeats in their Champions League group, achieving their worst-ever score (3 points) and their greatest-ever number of losses in the competition's group stage. The team finished third in the group stage and dropped down into the Europa League, in which they were defeated 2\u20131 by [[Sevilla FC|Sevilla]] away in the semi-final. Meanwhile, on 28 November 2022, the entire board of directors had resigned from their respective positions, [[Andrea Agnelli]] as president, [[Pavel Nedv\u011bd]] as vice president, and [[Maurizio Arrivabene]] as CEO. Agnelli's presidency was the most victorious of the club's history, with 19 titles won. [[Exor (company)|Exor]], the club's controlling shareholder, appointed [[Gianluca Ferrero]] as its new chairman ahead of the shareholders' meeting on 18 January 2023.\nTwo days later, after being acquitted by the FIGC's Court of Appeal in April\u2013May 2022, Juventus were deducted 15 points as punishment for capital gain violations, as part of an investigation related to the 2019\u20132021 budgets during the [[COVID-19 pandemic]] starting in November 2021. Following Juventus's appeal, the decision had initially been reversed on 20 April 2023, but the club were given a new penalty, this time of ten points, on 22 May. Within the aforementioned FIGC's inquiry, on 29 May, Juventus proposed a plea bargain for their false accounting on staff salaries; the request was accepted one day later and Juventus only received a fine of \u20ac718,240 without any further penalty. Juventus finished the [[2022\u201323 Serie A]] in seventh place and qualified to the [[UEFA Europa Conference League]]. However, on 28 July, UEFA ejected Juventus from its competitions for one year as the club violated a settlement agreement with UEFA signed in August 2022. The [[2023\u201324 Juventus FC season|2023\u201324 season]] was the first in which Juventus did not participate in UEFA competitions since 2011\u201312. \nDue to their UEFA competition ban, Juventus only had the Serie A title and Coppa Italia to play for during the 2023\u201324 season. In [[2023-24 Serie A|Serie A]] Juventus finished the season in third place. In the [[2023-24 Coppa Italia|Coppa Italia]], Juventus made the final where they faced [[Atalanta B.C.|Atalanta]]. Juventus won the final 1\u20130 after an early goal from [[Du\u0161an Vlahovi\u0107]], earning the Turin club their 15th Coppa Italia title. That was Allegri's sole trophy during his second stint. However the game was not without controversy, Allegri was sent off in stoppage time after shouting at the 4th official. Allegri after leaving the pitch was reported to have attacked the referees, threatened a journalist and waved off sporting director [[Cristiano Giuntoli]] during the post match celebrations. \nDespite winning the Coppa Italia, two days after the final Juventus announced they had sacked Allegri, mainly due to his behaviour during the game not being in line with the club's values, [[Paolo Montero]] took charge for the final two league games of the season. \nOn 12 June 2024, Juventus announced that former [[Bologna FC 1909|Bologna]] coach and Inter Milan midfielder [[Thiago Motta]] would become their new head coach for the [[2024\u201325 Juventus FC season|2024\u201325 season]], on a three-year contract. Ahead of the 2024\u201325 season, Juventus spent almost \u20ac200 million in the football market, which included the signings of midfielders [[Teun Koopmeiners]] and [[Douglas Luiz]] (both paid more than \u20ac50 milion). However, Motta was sacked in March 2025, and was replaced by former 1990s and 2000s footballer [[Igor Tudor]].\nOn 7 October 2025, Juventus announced that its chief executive officer, [[Maurizio Scanavino]], would step down from his position on 7 November 2025, concluding a three-year tenure that began in late 2022 following the resignation of the club\u2019s previous board of directors. The club indicated that it expected to appoint [[Damien Comolli]], then serving as general manager, as Scanavino\u2019s successor. Comolli had joined Juventus in June 2025 after holding executive positions at several European clubs, including [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] and [[Toulouse FC|Toulouse]]. On 30 October 2025, the club confirmed that [[Luciano Spalletti]] had been appointed as their new head coach until the end of the [[2025\u201326 Juventus FC season|2025\u201326 season]], replacing Igor Tudor. \nCrest and colours.\nJuventus have played in black and white striped shirts, with white shorts, sometimes black shorts since [[1902 Italian Football Championship|1901\u201302 season]]. Originally, they played in pink shirts with a black tie. The father of one of the players made the earliest shirts, but continual washing faded the colour so much that in December 1901 the club sought to replace them. Juventus asked one of their team members, Englishman [[John Savage (English footballer)|John Savage]], if he had any contacts in England who could supply new shirts in a colour that would better withstand the elements. He had a friend who lived in Nottingham, who being a [[Notts County F.C.|Notts County]] supporter, shipped out the black and white striped shirts to Turin. Juventus have worn the shirts ever since, considering the colours to be aggressive and powerful.\nJuventus's official emblem has undergone different and small modifications since the 1920s. The previous modification of the Juventus badge took place in 2004, when the emblem of the team changed to a black-and-white [[Shield (heraldry)|oval shield]] of a type used by Italian ecclesiastics. It is divided in five vertical stripes: two white stripes and three black stripes, inside which are the following elements, while in its upper section the name of the society superimposed on a white [[Convex set|convex section]], over golden curvature (gold for honour). The white silhouette of a [[Cattle|charging bull]] is in the lower section of the oval shield, superimposed on a black [[Shield (heraldry)|old French shield]] and the charging bull is a symbol of the \"[[comune]]\" of Turin. There is also a black silhouette of a [[mural crown]] above the black spherical triangle's base. This is a reminiscence to Augusta Tourinorum, the old city of the [[Roman Empire|Roman era]] which the present capital of Piedmont region is its cultural heiress.\nIn January 2017, president [[Andrea Agnelli]] announced the change to the Juventus badge for a [[logotype]]. More specifically, it is a [[pictogram]] composed by a stylised Black and White \"[[J]]\" which Agnelli said reflects \"the Juventus way of living.\" Juventus was the first team in sports history to adopt a [[Star (sport badge)|star]] as a symbol associated with any competition's triumph, who added one above their badge in 1958 to represent their tenth Italian Football Championship and Serie A title, and has since become popularized with other clubs as well.\nIn the past, the convex section of the emblem had a blue colour (another symbol of Turin) and it was [[Concave polygon|concave]] in shape. The old French shield and the mural crown, also in the lower section of the emblem, had a considerably greater size. The two \"Golden Stars for Sport Excellence\" were located above the convex and concave section of Juventus's emblem. During the 1980s, the club emblem was the blurred silhouette of a zebra, alongside the two golden stars with the club's name forming an arc above.\nJuventus unofficially won their 30th league title in 2011\u201312, but a dispute with the FIGC, which stripped Juventus of their 2004\u201305 title and did not assign them the 2005\u201306 title due to their involvement in the \"[[Calciopoli]]\" scandal, left their official total at 28; the club elected to wear no stars at all the [[2012\u201313 Serie A|following season]], but added the message \"30 sul campo\" (\"30 on the pitch\", referring to the two titles that were won but vacated) underneath the badge. Juventus won their 30th title in 2013\u201314 and thus earned the right to wear their third star, but Agnelli stated that the club suspended the use of the stars until another team wins their 20th championship, having the right to wear two stars \"to emphasise the difference\". For the [[2015\u201316 Juventus FC season|2015\u201316 season]], Juventus reintroduced the stars and added the third star to their jersey as well with new kit manufacturers [[Adidas]], in addition to the Coppa Italia badge for winning their tenth [[2014\u201315 Coppa Italia|Coppa Italia]] the [[2014\u201315 Juventus FC season|previous season]]. For the [[2016\u201317 Juventus FC season|2016\u201317 season]], Juventus re-designed their kit with a different take on the trademark black and white stripes. For the [[2017\u201318 Juventus FC season|2017\u201318 season]], Juventus introduced the \"J\" shaped logo onto the kits.\nIn September 2015, Juventus officially announced a new project called JKids for its junior supporters on its website. Along with this project, Juventus also introduced a new mascot to all its fans which is called J. J is a cartoon-designed zebra, black and white stripes with golden edge piping on its body, golden shining eyes, and three golden stars on the front of its neck. J made its debut at [[Juventus Stadium]] on 12 September 2015.\nDuring its history, the club has acquired a number of nicknames, \"la Vecchia Signora\" (the Old Lady) being the best example. The \"old\" part of the nickname is a pun on Juventus which means \"youth\" in Latin. It was derived from the age of the Juventus star players towards the middle of the 1930s. The \"lady\" part of the nickname is how fans of the club affectionately referred to it before the 1930s. The club is also nicknamed \"la Fidanzata d'Italia\" (lit.\u2009'the Girlfriend of Italy'), because over the years it has received a high level of support from [[Southern Italy|Southern Italian]] immigrant workers (particularly from [[Naples]] and [[Palermo]]), who arrived in Turin to work for FIAT since the 1930s. Other nicknames include \"[la] Madama\" ([[Piedmontese language|Piedmontese]] for Madam), \"i bianconeri\" (lit.\u2009'the black-and-whites'), \"le zebre\" (lit.\u2009'the zebras') in reference to Juventus's colours. \"I gobbi\" (lit.\u2009'the hunchbacks') is the nickname that is used to define Juventus supporters, but is also used sometimes for team's players. The most widely accepted origin of \"gobbi\" dates to the fifties, when the \"bianconeri\" wore a large jersey. When players ran on the field, the jersey, which had a laced opening at the chest, generated a bulge over the back (a sort of parachute effect), making the players look hunchbacked.\nThe official anthem of Juventus is \"Juve (storia di un grande amore)\", or \"Juve (story of a great love)\" in English, written by Alessandra Torre and Claudio Guidetti, in the version of the singer and musician [[Paolo Belli]] composed in 2007. In 2016, a documentary film called \"Black and White Stripes: The Juventus Story\" was produced by the [[La Villa brothers]] about Juventus. On 16 February 2018, the first three episodes of a [[docu-series]] called \"[[First Team: Juventus]]\", which followed the club throughout the [[2017\u201318 Juventus FC season|season]], by spending time with the players behind the scenes both on and off the field, was released on [[Netflix]]; the other three episodes were released on 6 July 2018. On 25 November 2021, an eight-episode docu-series called \"[[All or Nothing: Juventus]]\", which followed the club throughout the [[2020\u201321 Juventus FC season|season]], by spending time with the players behind the scenes both on and off the field, was released on [[Amazon Prime]].\nStadiums.\nAfter the first two years (1897 and 1898), during which Juventus played in the Parco del Valentino and Parco Cittadella, their matches were held in the Piazza d'Armi Stadium until 1908, except in 1905 (the first year of the \"scudetto\") and in 1906, years in which they played at the [[Stadio Motovelodromo Umberto I|Corso Re Umberto]].\nFrom 1909 to 1922, Juventus played their internal competitions at Corso Sebastopoli Camp before moving the following year to Corso Marsiglia Camp, where they remained until 1933, winning four league titles. At the end of 1933, they began to play at the new [[Stadio Olimpico Grande Torino|Stadio Benito Mussolini]] inaugurated for the [[1934 FIFA World Cup|1934 World Championships]]. After the Second World War, the stadium was renamed as Stadio Comunale [[Vittorio Pozzo]]. Juventus played home matches at the ground for 57\u00a0years, a total of 890\u00a0league matches. The team continued to host training sessions at the stadium until July 2003.\nFrom 1990 until the 2005\u201306 season, Juventus contested their home matches at [[Stadio delle Alpi]], built for the 1990 FIFA World Cup, although in very rare circumstances the club played some home games in other stadia such as [[Stadio Renzo Barbera|Renzo Barbera]] at Palermo, [[Stadio Dino Manuzzi|Dino Manuzzi]] in [[Cesena]] and the [[Stadio Giuseppe Meazza]] in Milan.\nIn August 2006, Juventus returned to play in the Stadio Comunale, then known as [[Stadio Olimpico Grande Torino|Stadio Olimpico]], after the restructuring of the stadium for the [[2006 Winter Olympics]] onward. In November 2008, Juventus announced that they would invest around \u20ac120\u00a0million to build a new ground, the Juventus Stadium, on the site of delle Alpi. Unlike the old ground, there is not a running track and instead the pitch is only 7.5 metres away from the stands. The capacity is 41,507. Work began during spring 2009 and the stadium was opened on 8 September 2011, ahead of the start of the 2011\u201312 season. Since 1 July 2017, the Juventus Stadium is known commercially as the [[Allianz]] Stadium of Turin until 30 June 2030.\nSupporters.\n[[File:Juventus Turyn fans 2006.jpg|thumb|211x211px|Juventus fans in 2006]]\nJuventus is the most-supported football club in Italy, with over 12\u00a0million fans or \"[[tifosi]]\", which represent approximately 34% of the total Italian football fans according to a research published in September 2016 by Italian research agency Demos &amp; Pi, as well as one of the most supported football clubs in the world, with over 300\u00a0million supporters (41\u00a0million in Europe alone), particularly in the Mediterranean countries to which a large number of [[Italian diaspora]] have emigrated. Juventus has fan clubs branches across the globe.\nDemand for Juventus tickets in occasional home games held away from Turin is high, suggesting that Juventus have stronger support in other parts of the country. Juventus is widely and especially popular throughout mainland Southern Italy, [[Sicily]] and [[Malta]], leading the team to have one of the largest followings in its away matches, more than in Turin itself.\nClub rivalries.\n[[File:Giuseppe Meazza (Derby d'Italia).jpg|thumb|Scene from the \"Derby d'Italia\" in 1930]]\nJuventus have significant rivalries with two main clubs.\nTheir traditional rivals are fellow Turin club [[Torino FC|Torino]]; matches between the two sides are known as the \"[[Derby della Mole]]\" (Turin Derby). The rivalry dates back to 1906 as Torino was founded by break-away Juventus players and staff.\nTheir most high-profile rivalry is with [[Inter Milan]], another big Serie A club located in [[Milan]], the capital of the neighbouring region of [[Lombardy]]. Matches between these two clubs are referred to as the \"[[Derby d'Italia]]\" (Derby of Italy) and the two regularly challenge each other at the top of the league table, hence the intense rivalry. Until the [[Calciopoli]] scandal which saw Juventus forcibly relegated, the two were the only Italian clubs to have never played below Serie A. Notably, the two sides are the first and the second most supported clubs in Italy and the rivalry has intensified since the later part of the 1990s; reaching its highest levels ever post-\"Calciopoli\", with the return of Juventus to Serie A.\nThe rivalry with [[AC Milan]] is a rivalry between the two most titled and two of the most supported teams in Italy. The match-ups between Milan and Juventus, is regarded as the championship of Serie A, and both teams were often fighting for the top positions of the standings, sometimes even decisive for the award of the title.\nThey also have rivalries with [[A.S. Roma|Roma]], [[ACF Fiorentina|Fiorentina]] and [[S.S.C. Napoli|Napoli]].\nYouth programme.\nThe Juventus youth set-up has been recognised as one of the best in Italy for producing young talents. While not all graduates made it to the first team, many have enjoyed successful careers in the Italian top flight. Under long-time coach [[Vincenzo Chiarenza]], the \"Primavera\" (under-19) squad enjoyed one of its successful periods, winning all age-group competitions from 2004 to 2006. Like Dutch club Ajax and many [[Premier League]] clubs, Juventus operates several satellite clubs and football schools outside of the country (i.e. United States, Canada, [[Greece]], [[Saudi Arabia]], Australia and [[Switzerland]]) and numerous camps in the local region to expand talent scouting. On 3 August 2018, Juventus founded their professional reserve team, called [[Juventus F.C. Under-23|Juventus U23]] (renamed to Juventus Next Gen in August 2022), playing in [[Serie C]], who won the [[2019\u201320 Coppa Italia Serie C|Coppa Italia Serie C]] in 2020. In the [[2021\u201322 UEFA Youth League]], the U19 squad reached the semi-finals, equalling the best-ever placing in the competition for a Serie A team.\nThe youth system is also notable for its contribution to the Italian national senior and youth teams. 1934 World Cup winner [[Gianpiero Combi]], [[Football at the 1936 Summer Olympics|1936 Gold Medal]] and [[1938 FIFA World Cup|1938 World Cup]] winner [[Pietro Rava]], [[Giampiero Boniperti]], Roberto Bettega, 1982 World Cup hero Paolo Rossi and more recently Claudio Marchisio and Sebastian Giovinco are a number of former graduates who have gone on to make the first team and full Italy squad.\n \"As of 1 September 2025\"\nPlayers.\nCurrent squad.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Football squad player/styles.css\" /&gt;\n \"As of 3 September 2025\"\nJuventus Next Gen and Youth Sector.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Football squad player/styles.css\" /&gt;\n \"As of 27 August 2025\"\nOut on loan.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Football squad player/styles.css\" /&gt;\nCoaching staff.\n[[File:Luciano Spalletti 2024.jpg|thumb|Luciano Spalletti is the current head coach of the club]]\nChairmen history.\nJuventus have had overall 24 [[President (corporate title)|president]]s ( or ) and two administrative committees, some of which have been members of the club's main stakeholder group and elected since the club's foundation by the then \"assemblea di soci\" (membership assembly) through an [[Annual general meeting|annual meeting]]. Since 1949, they have been often corporate managers that were nominated in charge by the \"assemblea degli azionisti\" (stakeholders assembly). On top of chairmen, there were several living former presidents, that were nominated as the honorary chairmen ().\nManagerial history.\n[[File:FIFA WC-qualification 2014 - Austria vs Ireland 2013-09-10 - Giovanni Trapattoni 05.JPG|thumb|upright|[[Giovanni Trapattoni]], the longest serving and most successful manager in the history of Juventus with 14 trophies]]\nBelow is a list of Juventus managers from 1923, when the [[Agnelli family]] took over and the club became more structured and organised, until the present day.\nHonours.\n[[File:Juventus Museum - Trophy Room.jpg|thumb|A partial view of the club's trophy room with the titles won between 1905 and 2013 at [[J-Museum]]]]\nItaly's most successful club of the 20th century and the [[Football records and statistics in Italy#Most successful clubs overall (1898\u2013present)|most winning]] in the history of [[Football in Italy|Italian football]], Juventus have won the [[Serie A|Italian League Championship]], the country's premier football club competitions and organised by [[Lega Serie A|Lega Nazionale Professionisti Serie A]] (LNPA), a record 36 times and have the [[Football records in Italy#Consecutive titles|records of consecutive triumphs]] in that tournament (nine, between [[2011\u201312 Serie A|2011\u201312]] and [[2019\u201320 Serie A|2019\u201320]]). They have also won the [[Coppa Italia]], the country's primary [[Single-elimination tournament|single-elimination competitions]], a record 15 times, becoming the first team to retain the trophy successfully with their triumph in the 1959\u201360 season, and the first to win it in three consecutive seasons from the 2014\u201315 season to the 2016\u201317 season, going on to win a fourth consecutive title in 2017\u201318 (also a record). In addition, the club holds the record for [[Supercoppa Italiana]] wins with nine, the most recent coming in [[2020 Supercoppa Italiana|2020]].\nOverall, Juventus have won 71 official competitions, [[Football records in Italy#Most successful clubs overall (1898\u2013present)|more]] than any other club in the country: 60 at national level (which is also a record) and 11 at international stage, making them, [[List of UEFA club competition winners#By club|in the latter case]], the second most successful Italian team. The club is sixth in Europe and twelfth in the world with the most international title won officially recognised by their respective [[FIFA Emergency Committee|association football confederation]] and [[FIFA|F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de Football Association]] (FIFA). In [[1976\u201377 UEFA Cup|1977]], the Juventus became the first in [[Southern Europe]] to have won the [[UEFA Europa League|UEFA Cup]] and the first\u2014and only to date\u2014in Italian football history to achieve an international title with a squad composed by national footballers. In [[1992\u201393 UEFA Cup|1993]], the club won its third competition's trophy, an unprecedented feat in the continent until then, a confederation record for the next [[2014\u201315 UEFA Europa League|22 years]] and the most for an Italian team. Juventus was also the first club in the country to achieve the title in the [[UEFA Super Cup|European Super Cup]], having won the competitions in [[1984 European Super Cup|1984]] and the first European side to win the [[Intercontinental Cup (1960\u20132004)|Intercontinental Cup]] in [[1985 Intercontinental Cup|1985]], since it was restructured by [[UEFA|Union of European Football Associations]] (UEFA) and [[CONMEBOL|Confederaci\u00f3n Sudamericana de F\u00fatbol]] (CONMEBOL)'s organizing committee five years beforehand.\nThe club has earned the distinction of being allowed to wear three [[Star (sport badge)|golden stars]] () on its shirts representing its league victories, the tenth of which was achieved during the 1957\u201358 season, the 20th in the [[1981\u201382 Serie A|1981\u201382 season]] and the 30th in the [[2013\u201314 Serie A|2013\u201314 season]]. Juventus were the first Italian team to have achieved [[Double (association football)|the national double]] four times (winning the Italian [[Serie A|top tier division]] and the [[Coppa Italia|national cup]] competitions in the same season), in the 1959\u201360, 1994\u201395, 2014\u201315 and 2015\u201316 season. In the 2015\u201316 season, Juventus won the [[2016 Coppa Italia final|Coppa Italia]] for the 11th time and their second-straight title, becoming the first team in Italy's history to complete Serie A and Coppa Italia [[Double (association football)|doubles]] in back-to-back season; Juventus would go on to win another two consecutive doubles in 2016\u201317 and 2017\u201318.\nUntil the first Europa Conference League final in 2022, the club was unique in the world in having won all official confederation competitions and they have received, in recognition to winning [[UEFA club competition records and statistics#List of teams to have won the three main European club competitions|the three major UEFA competitions]]\u2014[[Timeline of association football#1980s|first case]] in the history of the [[UEFA competitions|European football]] and the only one to be reached with the same coach spell\u2014 [[The UEFA Plaque]] by the [[UEFA|Union of European Football Associations]] (UEFA) on 12 July 1988.\nJuventus was placed seventh in the [[FIFA Club of the Century|FIFA's century ranking]] of the best clubs in the world on 23 December 2000 and nine years later was ranked second best club in Europe during the 20th Century based on a statistical study series by [[International Federation of Football History &amp; Statistics]], the highest for an Italian club in both.\nJuventus have been proclaimed [[IFFHS World's Best Club|World's Club Team of the Year]] twice (1993 and 1996) and was ranked in 3rd place\u2014the highest ranking of any Italian club\u2014in the [[International Federation of Football History &amp; Statistics#Club World Ranking|All-Time Club World Ranking]] (1991\u20132009 period) by the IFFHS.\nClub statistics and records.\n[[File:Alessandro Del Piero 2008 cropped.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Alessandro Del Piero]] made a record 705 appearances for Juventus, including 478 in Serie A and is the all-time leading goalscorer for the club, with 290 goals.]]\nAlessandro Del Piero holds Juventus's official appearance record of 705 appearances. He took over from Gaetano Scirea on 6 April 2008 against [[U.S. Citt\u00e0 di Palermo|Palermo]]. He also holds the record for Serie A appearances with 478. Including all official competitions, Del Piero is the all-time leading goalscorer for Juventus, with 290\u2014since joining the club in 1993. Giampiero Boniperti, who was the all-time topscorer since 1961 comes in second in all competitions with 182. In the [[1933\u201334 Serie A|1933\u201334 season]], [[Felice Borel]] scored 31\u00a0goals in 34\u00a0appearances, setting the club record for Serie A goals in a single season.

The most goals scored by a player in a single match is 6, which is also an Italian record. This was achieved by Omar S\u00edvori in a game against Inter in the [[1960\u201361 Serie A|1960\u201361 season]].\nThe first ever official game participated in by Juventus was in the [[1900 Italian Football Championship|Third Federal Football Championship]], the predecessor of Serie A, against [[F.B.C. Torinese|Torinese]] in a Juventus loss 0\u20131. The biggest victory recorded by Juventus was 15\u20130 against Cento, in the second round of the [[1926\u201327 Coppa Italia]]. In the league, Fiorentina and Fiumana were famously on the end of Juventus's biggest championship wins, with both beaten 11\u20130 in the 1928\u201329 season. Juventus's heaviest championship defeats came during the 1911\u201312 and 1912\u201313 seasons: they were against Milan in 1912 (1\u20138) and Torino in 1913 (0\u20138).\nThe signing of [[Gianluigi Buffon]] in 2001 from [[S.S.D.

In that twenty years Juventus progressive competed in different disciplines such as [[tennis]], [[swimming (sport)|swimming]], [[ice hockey]], and [[bocce]], gaining success in the first cited. After a long [[liquidation]] process of the automotive corporation started after the [[Italian Civil War]] (1945), all Juventus O.S.A. sections were closed with the exception of football and tennis, which were [[demerge]]d. The football section, then called Juventus Cisitalia for [[sponsorship]] reasons, was [[rebranding|renamed]] Juventus Football Club and the [[Agnelli family]], which some members have held different executive charges inside the club for the past six years, obtained the club's majority [[Share (finance)|share]]s after industrialist [[Piero Dusio]], Cisitalia owner, transferred his [[Issued shares|capital shares]] in the ending of the decade.

He is considered Poland's first historian.\nLife.\nJan D\u0142ugosz is best known for his \"Annals or Chronicles of the Famous Kingdom of Poland\u200a\" (\"Annales seu cronici incliti regni Poloniae\") in 12 volumes and originally written in Latin, covering events throughout southeastern and western Europe, from 965 to 1480, the year he died. D\u0142ugosz combined features of Medieval chronicles with elements of humanistic historiography. For writing the history of the Kingdom of Poland, D\u0142ugosz also used Ruthenian chronicles including those that did not survive to our times (among which there could have been used the Kyiv collection of chronicles of the 11th century in the Przemysl's edition around 1100 and the Przemysl episcopal collections of 1225\u201340).\nHis work was first printed in 1701\u20131703. It was originally printed at the Jan Szeliga printing house in Dobromyl financed by Jan Szcz\u0119sny Herburt. Whenever Jan D\u0142ugosz bothers to mention himself in the book, he writes of himself in the third person. He belonged to the Wieniawa coat-of-arms.\nD\u0142ugosz was a canon at Krak\u00f3w, where he lived in the D\u0142ugosz House, and was educated at the University of Krakow. He was sent by King Casimir IV Jagiellon of Poland on diplomatic missions to the Papal and Imperial courts, and was involved in the King's negotiations with the Teutonic Knights during the Thirteen Years' War (1454\u201366) and at the peace negotiations.\nWhen scholar Sandivogius of Czechel left Krakow, D\u0142ugosz as his friend kept him in touch with the university.\nIn 1434, D\u0142ugosz's uncle, the first pastor at K\u0142obuck, appointed him to take over his position as canon of St. Martin church there. The town was in the Opole territory of Silesia, but had recently been conquered by W\u0142adys\u0142aw II Jagie\u0142\u0142o. D\u0142ugosz stayed until 1452 and while there, founded the canonical monastery.\nIn 1450, D\u0142ugosz was sent by Queen Sophia of Halshany and King Casimir to conduct peace negotiations between John Hunyadi and the Bohemian noble Jan Jiskra of Brand\u00fds, and after six days' of talks convinced them to sign a truce.\nIn 1455 in Krak\u00f3w, a fire spread which destroyed much of the city and the castle, but which spared D\u0142ugosz's House.\nIn 1461 a Polish delegation which included D\u0142ugosz met with emissaries of George of Podebrady in Bytom, Silesia. After six days of talks, they concluded an alliance between the two factions. In 1466 D\u0142ugosz was sent to the legate of Wroc\u0142aw, in order to attempt to obtain assurance that the legate was not biased in favor of the Teutonic Knights. He was successful, and was in 1467 entrusted with tutoring the king's son.\nD\u0142ugosz declined the offer of the Archbishopric of Prague, but shortly before his death was nominated Archbishop of Lw\u00f3w. This nomination was only confirmed by Pope Sixtus IV on 2 June 1480, two weeks after his death.\nHis work \"Banderia Prutenorum\" of 1448 is his description of the 1410 Battle of Grunwald, which took place between villages of Grunwald and St\u0119bark.\nAt some point in his life D\u0142ugosz loosely translated Wigand of Marburg's \"Chronica nova Prutenica\" from Middle High German into Latin, however with many mistakes and mixup of names and places.\n\"Roczniki, czyli kroniki s\u0142awnego Kr\u00f3lestwa Polskiego\" (new Polish translation of the \"Annals\", 1961\u20132006)\n\"The Annals of Jan Dlugosz\" (English translation of key sections of the work, )\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

She reigned from 16 October 1384 until her death. Born in Buda, she was the youngest daughter of Louis I of Hungary and Poland, and his wife, Elizabeth of Bosnia. Jadwiga was a member of the Capetian House of Anjou, and had forebears among the Polish Piasts.\nIn 1375, it was planned that when becoming old enough, Jadwiga would marry William of Austria and she lived in Vienna from 1378 to 1380. Louis I is often thought to have regarded her and William as his favoured successors in Hungary after the 1378 death of her eldest sister, Catherine, since the following year the Polish nobility had pledged their homage to Louis' second daughter, Mary, and Mary's fianc\u00e9, Sigismund of Luxembourg. However, Louis died, and in 1382, at her mother's insistence, Mary was crowned \"King of Hungary\". Sigismund of Luxembourg tried to take control of Poland, but the Polish nobility countered that they would be obedient to a daughter of Louis only if she settled in Poland. Queen Elizabeth then chose Jadwiga to reign in Poland but did not send her to Krak\u00f3w to be crowned. During the interregnum, Siemowit IV, Duke of Masovia, became a candidate for the Polish throne. The nobility of Greater Poland favoured him and proposed that he marry Jadwiga. However, Lesser Poland's nobility opposed him, and they persuaded Elizabeth to send Jadwiga to Poland.\nJadwiga was crowned \"king\" in Poland's capital, Krak\u00f3w, on 16 October 1384. Her coronation either reflected the Polish nobility's opposition to her intended husband, William, becoming king without further negotiation or simply emphasized her status as queen regnant. With her mother's consent, Jadwiga's advisors opened negotiations with Jogaila, Grand Duke of Lithuania, who was still a pagan, concerning his potential marriage to Jadwiga. Jogaila signed the Union of Krewo, pledging to convert to Catholicism and to promote the conversion of his pagan subjects. Meanwhile, William hastened to Krak\u00f3w, hoping to marry Jadwiga, but in late August 1385, the Polish nobles expelled him.\nJogaila, who took the Catholic baptismal name W\u0142adys\u0142aw, married Jadwiga on 15 February 1386. Legend says that she had agreed to marry him only after a lengthy prayer, seeking divine inspiration. Jogaila, now styled in Polish as W\u0142adys\u0142aw Jagie\u0142\u0142o was crowned King of Poland on 4 March 1386 as Jadwiga's co-ruler. Jogaila worked closely with his wife in that role. In any case, her real political power was limited. She remained passive when the rebellious nobles of the Kingdom of Hungary-Croatia murdered her mother in early 1387. After that, Jadwiga marched into the Kingdom of Galicia\u2013Volhynia, which had been under Hungarian rule, and persuaded most of the inhabitants to become subjects of the Polish Crown. She mediated between her husband's quarrelling kin and between Poland and the Teutonic Order. \nAfter her sister Mary died in 1395, Jadwiga and Jogaila laid claim to Hungary against the widowed Sigismund of Luxembourg, but the Hungarian lords did not support their claim and Sigismund easily retained his Hungarian throne. Jadwiga died four years later due to postpartum complications. As her only daughter predeceased her, the Queen was the last hereditary monarch of Poland, and with her death, the throne of Poland became elective. In 1997, she was canonized by the Catholic Church.\nChildhood (1373 or 1374 \u2013 1382).\nJadwiga was born in Buda, the capital of the Kingdom of Hungary. She was the third and youngest daughter of Louis I, King of Hungary and Poland, and his second wife, Elizabeth of Bosnia. Both her grandmothers were Polish princesses, connecting her to the native Piast dynasty of Poland. Polish historian Oscar Halecki concluded in his posthumously published work (1991) that Jadwiga's \"genealogical tree clearly shows that [she] had more Polish blood than any other\". She was probably born between 3 October 1373 and 18 February 1374. She was named after her distant ancestor, Saint Hedwig of Silesia, who was especially venerated in the Hungarian royal court at the time of her birth.\nKing Louis, who had not fathered any sons, wanted to ensure the right of his daughters to inherit his realms. Therefore, European royals regarded his three daughters as especially attractive brides. Leopold III, Duke of Austria, proposed his eldest son, William, to Jadwiga already on 18 August 1374. The envoys of the Polish nobles acknowledged that one of Louis's daughters would succeed him in Poland after he confirmed and extended their liberties in the Privilege of Koszyce on 17 September 1374. They took an oath of loyalty to Catherine on Louis's demand.\nLouis agreed to give Jadwiga in marriage to William of Austria on 4 March 1375. The children's \"sponsalia de futuro\", or \"provisional marriage\", was celebrated at Hainburg on 15 June 1378. The ceremony established the legal framework for the consummation of the marriage without any further ecclesiastical act as soon as they both reached the age of maturity. Duke Leopold agreed that Jadwiga would only receive Treviso, a town that was to be conquered from the Republic of Venice, as dowry from her father. After the ceremony, Jadwiga stayed in Austria for almost two years; she mainly lived in Vienna.\nCatherine died in late 1378. Louis persuaded the most influential Polish lords to swear an oath of loyalty to her younger sister, Mary, in September 1379. She was betrothed to Sigismund of Luxemburg, a great-grandson of Casimir the Great, who had been Louis's predecessor on the Polish throne. The \"promised marriage\" of Jadwiga and William was confirmed at their fathers' meeting in Z\u00f3lyom (now Zvolen in Slovakia) on 12 February 1380. Hungarian lords also approved the document, implying that Jadwiga and William were regarded as her father's successors in Hungary.\nA delegation of the Polish lords and clergy paid formal homage to Sigismund of Luxemburg as their future king on 25 July 1382. The Poles believed that Louis planned also to persuade the Hungarian lords and prelates to accept Jadwiga and William of Austria as his heirs in Hungary. However, he died on 10 September 1382. Jadwiga was present at her father's death bed.\nAccession negotiations (1382\u201384).\nJadwiga's sister, Mary, was crowned king of Hungary five days after their father's death. With the ceremony, their ambitious mother secured the right to govern Hungary on her twelve-year-old daughter's behalf instead of Mary's fianc\u00e9, Sigismund. Sigismund could not be present at Mary's coronation, because Louis had sent him to Poland to crush a rebellion. After he learnt of Louis's death, he adopted the title \"Lord of the Kingdom of Poland\", demanding oaths of loyalty from the towns in Lesser Poland. On 25 November, the nobles of Greater Poland assembled at Radomsko and decided to obey nobody but the daughter of the late king as she would settle in Poland. On their initiative, the noblemen of Lesser Poland passed a similar agreement in Wi\u015blica on 12 December. Queen Elizabeth sent her envoys to the assembled lords and forbade them to swear an oath of loyalty to anyone other than one of her daughters, thus invalidating the oath of loyalty that the Polish noblemen had sworn to Sigismund on the late King Louis's demand.\nBoth Elizabeth's daughters had been engaged to foreign princes (Sigismund and William, respectively) unpopular in Poland. Polish lords who were opposed to a foreign monarch regarded the members of the Piast dynasty as possible candidates to the Polish throne. Queen Elizabeth's uncle W\u0142adys\u0142aw the White had already attempted to seize Poland during Louis's reign. However, he had taken monastic vows and settled in a Benedictine abbey in Dijon in Burgundy. Antipope Clement VII, whom King Louis had refused to recognize against Pope Urban VI, released W\u0142adys\u0142aw from his vows, but he did not leave his monastery. Meanwhile, Siemowit IV, Duke of Masovia, appeared as a more ambitious candidate. He was especially popular among the nobility and townspeople of Greater Poland.\nQueen Elizabeth's representatives released the Poles from their oath of fidelity that their representatives had sworn to Mary at an assembly in Sieradz in February 1383. The envoys also announced that she was willing to send Jadwiga to be crowned instead, on condition that she return to Buda after her coronation to live there until her twelfth birthday. The Polish lords accepted the proposal, but they soon realized that thereby the interregnum would be extended by a further three years. At a new meeting in Sieradz, most noblemen were ready to elect Siemowit of Masovia king on 28 March. They proposed that Siemowit should marry Jadwiga. A member of the influential T\u0119czy\u0144ski family, Jan, convinced them to postpone Siemowit's election. The noblemen agreed to wait for Jadwiga until 10 May, stipulating that she was to live in Poland after her coronation. They also demanded that Dobrzy\u0144 and Gniewk\u00f3w (two fiefdoms which her father had granted to Vladislaus II of Opole), and \"Ruthenia\" (that had passed to Hungary in accordance with a previous treaty) be restored to the Polish Crown.\nMeanwhile, Jan T\u0119czy\u0144ski and his allies, including S\u0119dziw\u00f3j Pa\u0142uka, seem to have started negotiations with Jogaila, Grand Duke of Lithuania. Siemowit's supporters however, tried to enter Krak\u00f3w in the retinue of Bodzanta, Archbishop of Gniezno, in May, but the townspeople closed the gates of the city before their arrival. Jadwiga had not arrived in Poland by the stipulated date (10 May). Her mother's envoys stated that the spring floods had hindered Jadwiga's progress over the Carpathian Mountains.\nSiemowit of Mazovia took up arms and advanced as far as Kalisz. His supporters assembled in Sieradz in August in order to elect him king, but Archbishop Bodzanta refused to perform his coronation. In a meeting in Kassa, Queen Elizabeth promised the delegates of the Polish provinces to send Jadwiga to Poland before November. The queen mother and the Poles also agreed that if either Jadwiga or Mary died childless, her kingdom would pass to her surviving sister. Siemowit having laid siege to Kalisz, Queen Elizabeth sent Sigismund of Luxemburg at the head of an \"improvised army\" to Lesser Poland. Siemowit failed to take Kalisz, but news about the appalling behaviour of Sigismund's soldiers increased Sigismund's unpopularity in Poland. S\u0119dziw\u00f3j Pa\u0142uka, who was the castellan of Kalisz and \"starosta\" of Krak\u00f3w, led a delegation to Zadar in Dalmatia to negotiate with Queen Elizabeth, but she had him imprisoned instead. She sent Hungarian soldiers to Poland to garrison them in Wawel Castle in Krak\u00f3w, but Pa\u0142uka escaped and successfully obstructed her soldiers from entering the castle.\nAt a general assembly in Radomsko in early March, the delegates of all the Polish provinces and towns decided to elect Siemowit king, if Jadwiga did not come to Poland within two months. They set up a provisional government, stipulating that only the \"community of lords and citizens\" had the authority to administer Poland during the interregnum. Queen Elizabeth, who was only informed of the decision by an informal message, realized that she could not any longer postpone Jadwiga's coronation and so sent her to Poland. The exact date of Jadwiga's arrival is unknown because the main source for the history of Poland during this period\u00a0\u2013 Jan of Czarnk\u00f3w's chronicle\u00a0\u2013 ended prior to this event.\nReign.\nCoronation (1384).\nThe interregnum that followed Louis's death and caused such internal strife came to an end with Jadwiga's arrival in Poland. A large crowd of clerics, noblemen and burghers gathered at Krak\u00f3w \"to greet her with a display of affection\", according to the 15th-century Polish historian, Jan D\u0142ugosz. Nobody protested when Archbishop Bodzanta crowned her on 16 October 1384. According to traditional scholarly consensus, Jadwiga was crowned king. Thereby, as Robert W. Knoll proposes, the Polish lords prevented her eventual spouse from adopting the same title without their consent. Stephen C. Rowell, who says that sources that contradict the traditional view outnumber those verifying it, suggests that sporadic contemporaneous references to Jadwiga as king only reflect that she was not a queen consort, but a queen regnant.\nBodzanta, Archbishop of Gniezno, Jan Radlica, Bishop of Krak\u00f3w, Dobrogost of Nowy Dw\u00f3r, Bishop of Pozna\u0144, and Duke Vladislaus II of Opole were Jadwiga's most trusted advisers during the first years of her reign. According to a widely accepted scholarly theory, Jadwiga, who was still a minor, was \"a mere tool\" to her advisers. However, Halecki refutes this view, contending that Jadwiga matured quickly and her personality, especially her charm and kindness, only served to strengthen her position. Already in late 1384 she intervened on Duke Vladislaus's behalf to reconcile him with her mother's favourite, Nicholas I Garai.\nRefusal of William (1385).\nThe Polish lords did not want to accept Jadwiga's fourteen-year-old fianc\u00e9, William of Habsburg, as their sovereign. They thought that the inexperienced William and his Austrian kinsmen could not safeguard Poland's interests against its powerful neighbours, especially the Luxemburgs which controlled Bohemia and Brandenburg, and had a strong claim on Hungary. According to Halecki, the lords of Lesser Poland were the first to suggest that Jadwiga should marry the pagan duke Jogaila of Lithuania.\nJogaila sent his envoys\u00a0\u2013 including his brother, Skirgaila, and a German burgher from Riga, Hanul\u00a0\u2013 to Krak\u00f3w to request Jadwiga's hand in January 1385. Jadwiga refused to answer, stating only that her mother would decide. Jogaila's two envoys left for Hungary and met Queen Elizabeth. She informed them that \"she would allow whatever was advantageous to Poland and insisted that her daughter and the prelates and nobles of the Kingdom had to do what they considered would benefit Christianity and their kingdom\", according to Jan D\u0142ugosz's chronicle. The nobles from Krak\u00f3w, Sandomierz and Greater Poland assembled in Krak\u00f3w in June or July and the \"majority of the more sensible\" voted for the acceptance of Jogaila's marriage proposal.\nIn the meantime, William's father, Leopold III hurried to Buda in late July 1385, demanding the consummation of the marriage between William and Jadwiga before 16 August. Queen Elizabeth confirmed the previous agreements about the marriage, ordering Vladislaus II of Opole to make preparations for the ceremony. According to canon law, Jadwiga's marriage sacrament could only be completed before her twelfth birthday if the competent prelate testified her precocious maturity. Demetrius, Archbishop of Esztergom, issued the necessary document. William went to Krak\u00f3w in the first half of August, but his entry to Wawel Castle was barred. D\u0142ugosz states that Jadwiga and William would only be able to meet in the nearby Franciscan convent.\nContemporary or nearly contemporaneous records of the completion of the marriage between William and Jadwiga are contradictory and unclear. The official accounts of the municipal authorities of Krak\u00f3w record that on 23 August 1385, an amnesty was granted to the prisoners in the city jail on the occasion of the celebration of the Queen's marriage. On the other hand, a contemporary Austrian chronicle, the \"Continuatio Claustroneubuzgis\" states that the Poles had tried to murder William before he consummated the marriage. In the next century, D\u0142ugosz states that William was \"removed in a shameful and offensive manner and driven from the castle\" after he entered \"the Queen's bedchamber\"; but the same chronicler also mentions that Jadwiga was well aware that \"many people knew that ... she had for a fortnight shared her bed with Duke William and that there had been physical consummation\".\nDuring the night that William entered the queen's bedchamber, a group of Polish noblemen broke into the castle, forcing William to flee, according to D\u0142ugosz. After this humiliation, D\u0142ugosz continued, Jadwiga decided to leave Wawel and join William, but the gate of the castle was locked. She called for \"an axe and [tried] to break it open\", but Dymitr of Goraj convinced her to return to the castle. Oscar Halecki says that D\u0142ugosz's narrative \"cannot be dismissed as a romantic legend\"; Robert I. Frost writes that it is a \"tale, almost certainly apocryphal\". There is no doubt, however, that William of Austria was forced to leave Poland.\nMarriage to Jogaila (1385\u201392).\nJogaila signed the Union of Krewo in August 1385, promising Queen Elizabeth's representatives and the Polish lords' envoys that he would convert to Catholicism, together with his pagan kinsmen and subjects, if Jadwiga married him. He also pledged to pay 200,000 florins to William of Habsburg in compensation. William never accepted it. Two days after the Union of Krewo, the Teutonic Knights invaded Lithuania.\nThe \"Aeltere Hochmeisterchronik\" and other chronicles written in the Knights' territory accused the Polish prelates and lords of forcing Jadwiga to accept Jogaila's offer. According to a Polish legend, Jadwiga agreed to marry Jogaila due to divine inspiration during her long prayers before a crucifix in Wawel Cathedral. Siemowit IV of Mazovia resigned his claim to Poland in December.\nThe Polish lords' envoys informed Jogaila that they would obey him if he married Jadwiga on 11 January 1386. Jogaila went to Lublin where a general assembly unanimously declared him \"king and lord of Poland\" in early February. Jogaila went on to Krak\u00f3w where he was baptized, receiving the Christian name, W\u0142adys\u0142aw, in Wawel Cathedral on 15 February. Three days later, W\u0142adys\u0142aw-Jogaila, who was between 23- and 35-year old, married 12-year-old Jadwiga. W\u0142adys\u0142aw-Jogaila styled himself as \"dominus et tutor regni Poloniae\" (\"lord and guardian of the Kingdom of Poland\") in his first charter issued after the marriage.\nArchbishop Bodzanta crowned W\u0142adys\u0142aw-Jogaila king on 4 March 1386. Poland was transformed into a diarchy\u00a0\u2013 a kingdom ruled over by two sovereigns. Jadwiga and her husband did not speak a common language, but they cooperated closely in their marriage. She accompanied him to Greater Poland to appease the local lords who were still hostile to him. The royal visit caused damage to the peasants who lived in the local prelates' domains, but Jadwiga persuaded her husband to compensate them, saying: \"We have, indeed, returned the peasants' cattle, but who can repair their tears?\", according to D\u0142ugosz's chronicle. A court record of her order to the judges in favour of a peasant also shows that she protected the poor.\nPope Urban VI sent his legate, Maffiolus de Lampugnano, to Krak\u00f3w to enquire about the marriage of the royal couple. Lampugnano did not voice any objections, but the Teutonic Knights started a propaganda campaign in favour of William of Habsburg. Queen Elizabeth pledged to assist W\u0142adys\u0142aw-Jogaila against his enemies on 9 June 1386, but Hungary had sunken into anarchy. A group of Slavonian lords captured and imprisoned Jadwiga's mother and sister on 25 July. The rebels murdered Queen Elizabeth in January 1387. A month later, Jadwiga marched at the head of Polish troops to Ruthenia where all but one of the governors submitted to her without opposition.\nDuke Vladislaus of Opole also had a claim on Ruthenia but could not convince King Wenceslaus of Germany to intervene on his behalf. Jadwiga confirmed the privileges of the local inhabitants and promised that Ruthenia would never again be separated from the Polish Crown. After the reinforcements that W\u0142adys\u0142aw-Jogaila sent from Lithuania arrived in August, Halych, the only fortress to resist, also surrendered. W\u0142adys\u0142aw-Jogaila also came to Ruthenia in September. Voivode Petru II of Moldavia visited the royal couple and paid homage to them in Lviv on 26 September. W\u0142adys\u0142aw-Jogaila confirmed the privileges that Jadwiga had granted the Ruthenians in October. She also instructed her subjects to show the same respect for her husband as for herself: in a letter addressed to the burghers of Krak\u00f3w in late 1387, she stated that her husband was their \"natural lord\".\nOn William's demand, Pope Urban VI initiated a new investigation into the marriage of Jadwiga and W\u0142adys\u0142aw-Jogaila. They sent Bishop Dobrogost of Pozna\u0144 to Rome to inform the pope of the Christianization of Lithuania. In his letter to Bishop Dobrogost, Pope Urban jointly mentioned the royal couple in March 1388, which implied that he had already acknowledged the legality of their marriage. However, Gniewosz of Dalewice, who had been William of Habsburg's supporter, spread rumours about secret meetings between William and Jadwiga in the royal castle. Jadwiga took a solemn oath before Jan T\u0119czy\u0144ski, stating that she had only had marital relations with W\u0142adys\u0142aw-Jogaila. After all witnesses confirmed her oath, Gniewosz of Dalewice confessed that he had lied. She did not take vengeance on him.\nStrife with Sigismund (1392\u201395).\nJadwiga's brother-in-law, Sigismund, who had been crowned King of Hungary, started negotiations with the Teutonic Knights about partitioning Poland in early 1392. Jadwiga met Mary in Star\u00e1 \u013dubov\u0148a in May and returned to Krak\u00f3w only in early July. She most probably accompanied her husband to Lithuania, according to Oscar Halecki, because she was far from Krak\u00f3w till the end of August. On 4 August, W\u0142adys\u0142aw-Jogaila's cousin, Vytautas, who had earlier fled from Lithuania to the Teutonic Knights, paid homage to W\u0142adys\u0142aw-Jogaila near Lida in Lithuania on 4 August.\nNegotiations between Sigismund and the Grand Master of the Teutonic Knights, Konrad von Wallenrode, continued with the mediation of Vladislaus of Opole. However, Hungary's southern border was exposed to Ottoman incursions, preventing Sigismund from taking military measures against Poland. Wallenrode died on 25 July 1393. His successor, Konrad von Jungingen, opened negotiations with the Poles. During the discussions, Pope Boniface IX's legate, John of Messina, supported the Poles.\nJadwiga was a skilful mediator, famed for her impartiality and intelligence. She went to Lithuania to reconcile her brother-in-law, Skirgaila, with Vytautas in October 1393. Relations between Poland and Hungary remained tense. Sigismund invaded Moldavia, forcing Stephen I of Moldavia to accept his suzerainty in 1394. Soon after the Hungarian troops left Moldavia, Stephen sent his envoys to Jadwiga and Jogaila, promising to assist Poland against Hungary, the Ottoman Empire and the Teutonic Knights.\nOn 17 May 1395, Mary died after a riding accident. According to the 1383 agreement between their mother and the Polish lords, Jadwiga was her childless sister's heir in Hungary. Vlad I of Wallachia, a Hungarian vassal, issued an act of submission on 28 May, acknowledging Jadwiga and her husband as Mary's legitimate successors. The widowed king's close supporter, Stibor of Stiboricz, expelled Vlad from Wallachia. W\u0142adys\u0142aw-Jogaila gathered his troops on the Polish-Hungarian border, but Eustache Jolsvai, Palatine of Hungary, and John Kanizsai, Archbishop of Esztergom, stopped his invasion of Hungary. In September, Konrad von Jungingen told the prince-electors of the Holy Roman Empire that the union of Poland, Lithuania, and Hungary under W\u0142adys\u0142aw-Jogaila's rule would endanger Christendom. However, most of Sigismund's opponents, who were especially numerous in Croatia, supported the claim of Ladislaus of Naples, the last male member of the Capetian House of Anjou. On 8 September, the most influential Hungarian lords declared that they would not support any change in government while Sigismund was far from Hungary fighting against the Ottoman Turks. Before the end of the year, peace negotiations between the representatives of Hungary and Poland ended with an agreement. Jadwiga adopted the title \"heir to Hungary\", but she and her husband took no further action against Sigismund.\nConflict with the Teutonic Knights (1395\u201399).\nThe relationship between Lithuania and the Teutonic Knights remained tense. Jadwiga and her Polish advisers invited the Grand Master, Konrad von Jungingen, to Poland to open new negotiations in June 1396. Conflicts with Vladislaus of Opole and Siemowit of Masovia, who had not given up their claims to parts of Ruthenia and Cuyavia, also intensified. To demonstrate that the territories were under Jadwiga's direct control, W\u0142adys\u0142aw-Jogaila granted the Duchy of Belz (in Ruthenia) and Cuyavia to her in early 1397. However, Jadwiga and her Polish advisers wanted to avoid a war with the Teutonic Order. In response, W\u0142adys\u0142aw-Jogaila replaced most Polish \"starostas\" (aldermen) in Ruthenia with local Orthodox noblemen. According to German sources, W\u0142adys\u0142aw-Jogaila and Vytautas jointly asked Pope Boniface IX to sanction Vytautas' coronation as king of Lithuania and Ruthenia.\nJadwiga and Jungingen met in W\u0142oc\u0142awek in the middle of June, but they did not reach a compromise. The Teutonic Order entrusted Vladislaus of Opole with the task of representing their claims to Dobrzy\u0144 against Jadwiga. Jadwiga and her husband met Sigismund of Hungary, who had returned there after his catastrophic defeat in the Battle of Nicopolis, on 14 July. They seem to have reached a compromise because Sigismund offered to mediate between Poland, Lithuania and the Teutonic Knights. On Jadwiga's request, Wenceslaus of Bohemia granted permission for the establishment of a college for Lithuanian students in Prague on 20 July 1397. Jadwiga, who had spent \"many sleepless nights\" thinking of this project, according to herself, issued a charter of establishment for the college on 10 November.\nShe opened new negotiations with the Teutonic Knights, but Konrad von Jungingen dispatched a simple knight to meet her in May 1398. W\u0142adys\u0142aw-Jogaila's cousin Vytautas also entered into negotiations with the Teutonic Knights because he wanted to unite Lithuania and Ruthenia under his rule and to receive a royal crown from the Holy See. According to the chronicle of John of Posilge, who was an official of the Teutonic Order, Jadwiga sent a letter to Vytautas, reminding him to pay the annual tribute that W\u0142adys\u0142aw-Jogaila had granted her as dower. Offended by Jadwiga's demand, Vytautas sought the opinion of the Lithuanian and Ruthenian lords who refused Jadwiga's claim to a tribute. On 12 October 1398, he signed a peace treaty with the Teutonic Knights, without referring to W\u0142adys\u0142aw-Jogaila's right to confirm it. Oscar Halecki says that Posilge's \"sensational story\" is either an invention based on gossip or a guess by the chronicler.\nPregnancy and death (1399).\nJadwiga was childless for over a decade, which, according to chronicles written in the Teutonic lands, caused conflicts between her and her husband. She became pregnant in late 1398 or early 1399. Sigismund, King of Hungary, came to Krak\u00f3w in early March to negotiate for a campaign to defend Wallachia against the Ottoman Turks. Vytautas, in order to bolster his authority over the Rus' principalities, decided to launch an expedition against Timur, who had subdued the Golden Horde. According to Jan D\u0142ugosz's chronicle, Jadwiga warned the Polish noblemen not to join Vytautas' campaign because it would end in failure. Halecki says that the great number of Polish knights who joined Vytautas's expedition proves that D\u0142ugosz's report is not reliable.\nOn the occasion of the expected birth to the royal couple, Jogaila's cousin Vytautas, Grand Duke of Lithuania, sent expensive gifts, including a silver cradle, to the royal court on behalf of himself and his wife, Anna. The first horoscopes written for Jadwiga's and Jogaila's child predicted a son in mid-September 1398. However, a girl was delivered on 22 June 1399 at Wawel Castle. Reports of the time stated that the child was born prematurely. According to the horoscope, she was actually born slightly late. However, a due date of 18 June would rule out the suspicion of pregnancy as early as mid-September.\nThe newborn princess was named Elizabeth Bonifacia (, ), after Jadwiga's mother and Pope Boniface IX who, in a letter of 5 May 1399, had agreed to be godfather under the condition that the infant be named after him. She was baptised by Piotr Wysz Radoli\u0144ski, Bishop of Krak\u00f3w. However, the infant died after only three weeks, on 13 July 1399. Jadwiga, too, was on her deathbed. Stanis\u0142aw of Skarbimierz expressed hope that she would survive, describing her as the spiritual mother of the poor, weak, and ill of Poland. She advised her husband to marry Anna of Cilli, Casimir the Great's granddaughter\u2014which he did\u2014and died on 17 July 1399, four days after her newborn daughter. She was the last hereditary ruler of Poland; her husband and his descendants retained the crown as elective monarchs.\nJadwiga and her daughter were buried together in Wawel Cathedral, on 24 August 1399, as stipulated in the Queen's last will. On 12 July 1949, 550 years later, their tomb was opened; nothing remained of the child's soft cartilage.\nFamily.\nThe following family tree illustrates Jadwiga's connection to her notable relatives. Kings of Poland are coloured blue.\nLegacy.\nAchievements.\nTwo leading historians, Oscar Halecki and S. Harrison Thomson, agree that Jadwiga was one of the greatest rulers of Poland, comparable to Boles\u0142aw the Brave and Casimir the Great. Her marriage to W\u0142adys\u0142aw-Jogaila enabled the union of Poland and Lithuania, establishing a large state in East Central Europe. Jadwiga's decision to marry the 'elderly' W\u0142adys\u0142aw-Jogaila instead of her beloved fianc\u00e9, William of Habsburg, has often been described as a sacrifice for her country in Polish historiography. Her biographers emphasize Jadwiga's efforts to preserve the peace with the Teutonic Order, which enabled Poland to make preparations for a decisive war against the Knights. Jadwiga's childless death weakened W\u0142adys\u0142aw-Jogaila's position because his claim to Poland was based on their marriage. Six days after her funeral, W\u0142adys\u0142aw-Jogaila left Poland for Ruthenia, stating that he was to return to Lithuania after his wife's death. The Polish lords sent their envoys to Lviv to open negotiations with him. The delegates took new oaths of loyalty to him, confirming his position as king. On the lords' demand, he agreed to marry Anna of Cilli. Their wedding was celebrated on 29 January 1402.\nJadwiga's cultural and charitable activities were of exceptional value. She established new hospitals, schools and churches, and restored older ones. Jadwiga promoted the use of vernacular in church services, especially the singing of hymns in Polish. The Scriptures were translated into Polish on her order.\nCasimir the Great had already in 1364 established the University of Krak\u00f3w, but it did not survive his death. W\u0142adys\u0142aw-Jogaila and Jadwiga jointly asked Pope Boniface IX to sanction the establishment of a faculty of theology in Krak\u00f3w. The pope granted their request on 11 January 1397. Jadwiga bought houses along a central street of Krak\u00f3w for the university. However, the faculty was only set up a year after Jadwiga's death: W\u0142adys\u0142aw-Jogaila issued the charter for the reestablished university on 26 July 1400. In accordance with Jadwiga's last will, the restoration of the university was partially financed through the sale of her jewellery.\nHoliness.\nOscar Halecki writes that Jadwiga transmitted to the nations of East Central Europe the \"universal heritage of the \"respublica Christiana\", which in the West was then waning, but in East Central Europe started flourishing and blending with the pre-Renaissance world\". She was closely related to the saintly 13th-century princesses, venerated in Hungary and Poland, including Elizabeth of Hungary and her nieces, Kinga and Yolanda, and Salomea of Poland. She was born to a family famed for its religious zeal. She attended Mass every day. Following her family's tradition, Jadwiga was especially devoted to the Blessed Virgin Mary. An inscription engraved on her request on a precious chalice, which was placed in the Wawel Cathedral, asked Our Lady to place Poland under her protection.\nJadwiga was venerated in Poland soon after her death. Stanis\u0142aw of Skarbimierz states that she had been \"the most Christian queen\" in his sermon composed for her funeral. Paul of Zator referred to the wax figures placed by her grave. Sermons written in the early 15th century emphasized that Jadwiga had been a representative of the traditional virtues of holy women, such as mercy and benevolence. Jadwiga's contribution to the restoration of the University of Krak\u00f3w was also mentioned by early 15th-century scholars.\nNumerous legends about miracles were recounted to justify her sainthood. The two best-known are those of \"Jadwiga's cross\" and \"Jadwiga's foot\":\nJadwiga often prayed before a large black crucifix hanging in the north aisle of Wawel Cathedral. During one of these prayers, the Christ on the cross is said to have spoken to her. The crucifix, \"Saint Jadwiga's cross\", is still there, with her relics beneath it. Because of this event, she is considered a medieval mystic. According to another legend, Jadwiga took a piece of jewellery from her foot and gave it to a poor stonemason who had begged for her help. When the queen left, he noticed her footprint in the plaster floor of his workplace, even though the plaster had already hardened before her visit. The supposed footprint, known as \"Jadwiga's foot\", can still be seen in one of Krak\u00f3w's churches.\nIn yet another legend, Jadwiga was taking part in a Corpus Christi Day procession when a coppersmith's son drowned by falling into a river. Jadwiga threw her mantle over the boy's body, and he regained life.\nOn 8 June 1979 Pope John Paul II prayed at her sarcophagus, and the Congregation for Divine Worship and the Discipline of the Sacraments officially affirmed her beatification on 8 August 1986. The Pope went on to canonize Jadwiga in Krak\u00f3w on 8 June 1997.\nIn popular culture.\n\"Hedvigis. Dziedziczka kr\u00f3lestwa\" (2021), a Polish historical novel about the early life and reign of Jadwiga by Krzysztof Konopka, follows the story of Jadwiga, her sister Mary, and their mother. Jadwiga is the main character of the third season of Polish historical TV series \"Korona kr\u00f3l\u00f3w\" (The Crown of the Kings). She is played by Dagmara Bryzek. Child Jadwiga is played by Natalia Wolska and Amelia Zawadzka.\nJadwiga appears as the leader of the Polish civilization in the turn-based strategy game \"Civilization VI\", specializing in religion and territorial expansion. She also features in in a campaign of her own.\nJadwiga is a playable character in the Mobile/PC Game \"Rise of Kingdoms\".\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\nPrimary sources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSecondary sources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "16421", "revid": "50219088", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=16421", "title": "Kennedy Space Center", "text": "United States space launch site in Florida\nThe John F. Kennedy Space Center (KSC, originally known as the NASA Launch Operations Center), located on Merritt Island, Florida, is one of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's (NASA) ten field centers. Since 1968, KSC has been NASA's primary launch center of American spaceflight, research, and technology. Launch operations for the Apollo, Skylab and Space Shuttle programs were carried out from Kennedy Space Center Launch Complex 39 and managed by KSC. Located on the east coast of Florida, KSC is adjacent to Cape Canaveral Space Force Station (CCSFS). The management of the two entities work very closely together, share resources, and operate facilities on each other's property.\nThough the first Apollo flights and all Project Mercury and Project Gemini flights took off from the then-Cape Canaveral Air Force Station, the launches were managed by KSC and its previous organization, the Launch Operations Directorate. Starting with the fourth Gemini mission, the NASA launch control center in Florida (Mercury Control Center, later the Launch Control Center) began handing off control of the vehicle to the Mission Control Center in Houston, shortly after liftoff; in prior missions it held control throughout the entire mission.\nAdditionally, the center manages launch of robotic and commercial crew missions and researches food production and in-situ resource utilization for off-Earth exploration. Since 2010, the center has worked to become a multi-user spaceport through industry partnerships, even adding a new launch pad (LC-39C) in 2015.\nThere are about 700 facilities and buildings grouped throughout the center's . Among the unique facilities at KSC are the tall Vehicle Assembly Building for stacking NASA's largest rockets, the Launch Control Center, which conducts space launches at KSC, the Operations and Checkout Building, which houses the astronauts' dormitories and suit-up area, a Space Station factory, and a long Shuttle Landing Facility. There is also a Visitor Complex on site that is open to the public.\nFormation.\nSince 1949, the military had been performing launch operations at what would become Cape Canaveral Space Force Station. In December 1959, the Department of Defense transferred 5,000 personnel and the Missile Firing Laboratory to NASA to become the Launch Operations Directorate under NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center.\nPresident John F. Kennedy's 1961 goal of a crewed lunar landing by 1970 required an expansion of launch operations. On July 1, 1962, the Launch Operations Directorate was separated from MSFC to become the Launch Operations Center (LOC). Also, Cape Canaveral was inadequate to host the new launch facility design required for the mammoth tall, thrust Saturn V rocket, which would be assembled vertically in a large hangar and transported on a mobile platform to one of several launch pads. Therefore, the decision was made to build a new LOC site located adjacent to Cape Canaveral on Merritt Island.\nIn 1961, NASA formally announced its intent to acquire approximately 88,000 acres of land (about 138 square miles) along Florida\u2019s east coast, marking the beginning of what would become a much larger acquisition effort. NASA began land acquisition in 1962; in the years-long effort, NASA bought title to and negotiated with the state of Florida for an additional . The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers oversaw the land acquisition process. They directly negotiated with property owners before resorting to condemnations when negotiations were inefficient. Much of the land NASA acquired was in agricultural use, particularly for citrus farming. In Merritt Island, citrus groves were purchased by mid-1963. Still, in an effort to manage the transition, NASA allowed many farmers to lease back their properties temporarily, allowing them to operate and reap harvest from the groves until summer 1964. To regulate activity in what was newly federally acquired land, all personnel required clearance to enter the controlled zone and special security badges were even issued to grove workers.\nThe major buildings in KSC's Industrial Area were designed by architect Charles Luckman. Construction began in November 1962, and Kennedy visited the site twice in 1962, and again just a week before his assassination on November 22, 1963.\nOn November 29, 1963, the facility was named by President Lyndon B. Johnson under . Johnson's order joined both the civilian LOC and the military Cape Canaveral station (\"the facilities of Station No. 1 of the Atlantic Missile Range\") under the designation \"John F. Kennedy Space Center\", spawning some confusion joining the two in the public mind. NASA administrator James E. Webb clarified this by issuing a directive stating the \"Kennedy Space Center\" name applied only to the LOC, while the Air Force issued a general order renaming the military launch site \"Cape Kennedy Air Force Station\".\nLocation.\nLocated on Merritt Island, Florida, the center is north-northwest of Cape Canaveral on the Atlantic Ocean, midway between Miami and Jacksonville on Florida's Space Coast, due east of Orlando. It is long and roughly wide, covering . KSC is a major central Florida tourist destination and is approximately one hour's drive from the Orlando area. The Kennedy Space Center Visitor Complex offers public tours of the center and Cape Canaveral Space Force Station.\nBefore NASA's acquisition, the region consisted of a landscape that included swampland, citrus groves, and coastal beaches \u2014 features that are typical of Florida\u2019s undeveloped east coast. Parts of the land had to be dredged to support the construction of the Center's facilities. In addition to environmental transformation, the acquisition also led to the displacement of several small communities, including the towns of Shiloh and Allenhurst, which were completely enveloped by NASA. KSC\u2019s Environmental Management Branch has rescued over 100 mangrove seedlings during a living-shoreline restoration project, replanting them to stabilize the shoreline and reduce erosion while supporting local wildlife. KSC developed an \u201cIndian River Lagoon Health Initiative Plan\u201d in coordination with the Merritt Island National Wildlife Refuge and Canaveral National Seashore to monitor and restore ecological health through seagrass mapping, manatee and bird surveys, and shoreline resiliency projects. Within its 140,000-acre property, KSC includes a variety of habitats \u2014 such as coastal dunes, saltwater estuaries, marshes, pine flatwoods, and hardwood hammocks \u2014 which support more than 1,500 species of plants and animals, including dozens of federally or state\u2011listed species. \nHistorical programs.\nApollo program.\nFrom 1967 through 1973, there were 13 Saturn V launches, including the ten remaining Apollo missions after Apollo 7. The first of two uncrewed flights, Apollo 4 (Apollo-Saturn 501) on November 9, 1967, was also the first rocket launch from KSC. The Saturn V's first crewed launch on December 21, 1968, was Apollo 8's lunar orbiting mission. The next two missions tested the Lunar Module: Apollo 9 (Earth orbit) and Apollo 10 (lunar orbit). Apollo 11, launched from Pad A on July 16, 1969, made the first Moon landing on July 20. The Apollo 11 launch included crewmembers Neil Armstrong, Michael Collins, and Buzz Aldrin, and attracted a record-breaking 650 million television viewers. Apollo 12 followed four months later. From 1970 to 1972, the Apollo program concluded at KSC with the launches of missions 13 through 17.\nSkylab.\nOn May 14, 1973, the last Saturn V launch put the Skylab space station in orbit from Pad 39A. By this time, the Cape Kennedy pads 34 and 37 used for the Saturn IB were decommissioned, so Pad 39B was modified to accommodate the Saturn IB, and used to launch three crewed missions to Skylab that year, as well as the final Apollo spacecraft for the Apollo\u2013Soyuz Test Project in 1975.\nSpace Shuttle.\nAs the Space Shuttle was being designed, NASA received proposals for building alternative launch-and-landing sites at locations other than KSC, which demanded study. KSC had important advantages, including its existing facilities; location on the Intracoastal Waterway; and its southern latitude, which gives a velocity advantage to missions launched in easterly near-equatorial orbits. Disadvantages included: its inability to safely launch military missions into polar orbit, since spent boosters would be likely to fall on the Carolinas or Cuba; corrosion from the salt air; and frequent cloudy or stormy weather. Although building a new site at White Sands Missile Range in New Mexico was seriously considered, NASA announced its decision in April 1972 to use KSC for the shuttle. Since the Shuttle could not be landed automatically or by remote control, the launch of \"Columbia\" on April 12, 1981 for its first orbital mission STS-1, was NASA's first crewed launch of a vehicle that had not been tested in prior uncrewed launches.\nIn 1976, the VAB's south parking area was the site of Third Century America, a science and technology display commemorating the U.S. bicentennial. Concurrent with this event, the U.S. flag was painted on the south side of the VAB. During the late 1970s, LC-39 was reconfigured to support the Space Shuttle. Two Orbiter Processing Facilities were built near the VAB as hangars with a third added in the 1980s.\nKSC's Shuttle Landing Facility (SLF) was the orbiters' primary end-of-mission landing site, although the first KSC landing did not take place until the tenth flight, when \"Challenger\" completed STS-41-B on February 11, 1984; the primary landing site until then was Edwards Air Force Base in California, subsequently used as a backup landing site. The SLF also provided a return-to-launch-site (RTLS) abort option, which was not utilized. The SLF is among the longest runways in the world.\nConstellation.\nOn October 28, 2009, the Ares I-X launch from Pad 39B was the first uncrewed launch from KSC since the Skylab workshop in 1973.\nExpendable launch vehicles (ELVs).\nBeginning in 1958, NASA and military worked side by side on robotic mission launches (previously referred to as unmanned), cooperating as they broke ground in the field. In the early 1960s, NASA had as many as two robotic mission launches a month. The frequent number of flights allowed for quick evolution of the vehicles, as engineers gathered data, learned from anomalies and implemented upgrades. In 1963, with the intent of KSC ELV work focusing on the ground support equipment and facilities, a separate Atlas/Centaur organization was formed under NASA's Lewis Center (now Glenn Research Center (GRC)), taking that responsibility from the Launch Operations Center (aka KSC).\nThough almost all robotics missions launched from the Cape Canaveral Space Force Station (CCSFS), KSC \"oversaw the final assembly and testing of rockets as they arrived at the Cape.\" In 1965, KSC's Unmanned Launch Operations directorate became responsible for all NASA uncrewed launch operations, including those at Vandenberg Space Force Base. From the 1950s to 1978, KSC chose the rocket and payload processing facilities for all robotic missions launching in the U.S., overseeing their near launch processing and checkout. In addition to government missions, KSC performed this service for commercial and foreign missions also, though non-U.S. government entities provided reimbursement. NASA also funded Cape Canaveral Space Force Station launch pad maintenance and launch vehicle improvements.\nAll this changed with the Commercial Space Launch Act of 1984, after which NASA only coordinated its own and National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) ELV launches. Companies were able to \"operate their own launch vehicles\" and utilize NASA's launch facilities. Payload processing handled by private firms also started to occur outside of KSC. Reagan's 1988 space policy furthered the movement of this work from KSC to commercial companies. That same year, launch complexes on Cape Canaveral Air Force Force Station started transferring from NASA to Air Force Space Command management.\nIn the 1990s, though KSC was not performing the hands-on ELV work, engineers still maintained an understanding of ELVs and had contracts allowing them insight into the vehicles so they could provide knowledgeable oversight. KSC also worked on ELV research and analysis and the contractors were able to utilize KSC personnel as a resource for technical issues. KSC, with the payload and launch vehicle industries, developed advances in automation of the ELV launch and ground operations to enable competitiveness of U.S. rockets against the global market.\nIn 1998, the Launch Services Program (LSP) formed at KSC, pulling together programs (and personnel) that already existed at KSC, GRC, Goddard Space Flight Center, and more to manage the launch of NASA and NOAA robotic missions. Cape Canaveral Space Force Station and VAFB are the primary launch sites for LSP missions, though other sites are occasionally used. LSP payloads such as the Mars Science Laboratory have been processed at KSC before being transferred to a launch pad on Cape Canaveral Space Force Station.\nArtemis program.\nOn 16 November 2022, at 06:47:44 UTC the Space Launch System (SLS) was launched from Complex 39B as part of the Artemis I mission.\nSpace station processing.\nAs the International Space Station modules design began in the early 1990s, KSC began to work with other NASA centers and international partners to prepare for processing before launch onboard the Space Shuttles. KSC utilized its hands-on experience processing the 22 Spacelab missions in the Operations and Checkout Building to gather expectations of ISS processing. These experiences were incorporated into the design of the Space Station Processing Facility (SSPF), which began construction in 1991. The Space Station Directorate formed in 1996. KSC personnel were embedded at station module factories for insight into their processes.\nFrom 1997 to 2007, KSC planned and performed on the ground integration tests and checkouts of station modules: three Multi-Element Integration Testing (MEIT) sessions and the Integration Systems Test (IST). Numerous issues were found and corrected that would have been difficult to nearly impossible to do on-orbit.\nIn January 2025, NASA\u2019s Kennedy Space Center signed a memorandum of understanding with the University of Florida, University of Central Florida, and Embry\u2011Riddle Aeronautical University to form the Florida University Space Research Consortium, advancing Moon-to-Mars research. A Systems Engineering &amp; Integration (SE&amp;I) bootcamp, backed by a three-year grant, was launched at KSC in 2025 by FAMU\u2011FSU College of Engineering in partnership with NASA to train 30 professionals in systems engineering for the Artemis campaign.\nThe second \u201cSpaceU Symposium\u201d was held in November 2025 at UCF, involving KSC researchers, university students, and space industry leaders to showcase innovation, research, and job opportunities in partnership with NASA.\nThe Florida University Space Research Consortium is part of a broader Florida Space Grant program that includes dozens of universities, which provides research funding and strong ties between KSC and higher education institutions to support NASA\u2019s missions.\nToday KSC continues to process ISS payloads from across the world before launch along with developing its experiments for on orbit. The proposed Lunar Gateway would be manufactured and processed at the Space Station Processing Facility.\nCurrent programs and initiatives.\nThe following are current programs and initiatives at Kennedy Space Center:\nFacilities.\nThe KSC Industrial Area, where many of the center's support facilities are located, is south of LC-39. It includes the Headquarters Building, the Operations and Checkout Building and the Central Instrumentation Facility. The astronaut crew quarters are in the O&amp;C; before it was completed, the astronaut crew quarters were located in Hangar S at the Cape Canaveral Missile Test Annex (now Cape Canaveral Space Force Station). Located at KSC was the Merritt Island Spaceflight Tracking and Data Network station (MILA), a key radio communications and spacecraft tracking complex.\nFacilities at the Kennedy Space Center are directly related to its mission to launch and recover missions. Facilities are available to prepare and maintain spacecraft and payloads for flight. The Headquarters (HQ) Building houses offices for the Center Director, library, film and photo archives, a print shop and security. When the KSC Library first opened, it was part of the Army Ballistic Missile Agency. However, in 1965, the library moved into three separate sections in the newly opened NASA headquarters before eventually becoming a single unit in 1970. The library contains over four million items related to the history and the work at Kennedy. As one of ten NASA center libraries in the country, their collection focuses on engineering, science, and technology. The archives contain planning documents, film reels, and original photographs covering the history of KSC. The library is not open to the public but is available for KSC, Space Force, and Navy employees who work on site.\nA new Headquarters Building was completed in 2019 as part of the Central Campus consolidation. Groundbreaking began in 2014.\nThe center operated its own short-line railroad. This operation was discontinued in 2015, with the sale of its final two locomotives. A third had already been donated to a museum. The line was costing $1.3\u00a0million annually to maintain.\nLaunch Complex 39.\nLaunch Complex 39 (LC-39) was originally built for the Saturn V, the largest and most powerful operational launch vehicle until the Space Launch System, for the Apollo crewed Moon landing program. Since the end of the Apollo program in 1972, LC-39 has been used to launch every NASA human space flight, including Skylab (1973), the Apollo\u2013Soyuz Test Project (1975), and the Space Shuttle program (1981\u20132011).\nSince December 1968, all launch operations have been conducted from launch pads A and B at LC-39. Both pads are on the ocean, east of the VAB. From 1969 to 1972, LC-39 was the \"Moonport\" for all six Apollo crewed Moon landing missions using the Saturn V, and was used from 1981 to 2011 for all Space Shuttle launches.\nHuman missions to the Moon required the large three-stage Saturn V rocket, which was tall and in diameter. At KSC, Launch Complex 39 was built on Merritt Island to accommodate the new rocket. Construction of the $800\u00a0million project began in November 1962. LC-39 pads A and B were completed by October 1965 (planned Pads C, D and E were canceled), the VAB was completed in June 1965, and the infrastructure by late 1966.\nAn economic impact report indicates that companies like SpaceX and Blue Origin are developing campus-like facilities at KSC\u2019s Launch Complex 39A and Exploration Park, fostering integrated manufacturing, testing, and launch operations on-site.\nThe complex includes:\nLaunch Complex 48.\nLaunch Complex 48 (LC-48) is a multi-user launch site under construction for small launchers and spacecraft. It will be located between Launch Complex 39A and Space Launch Complex 41, with LC-39A to the north and SLC-41 to the south. LC-48 will be constructed as a \"clean pad\" to support multiple launch systems with differing propellant needs. While initially only planned to have a single pad, the complex is capable of being expanded to two at a later date.\nCommercial leasing.\nAs a part of promoting commercial space industry growth in the area and the overall center as a multi-user spaceport, KSC leases some of its properties. Here are some major examples:\nVisitor complex.\nThe Kennedy Space Center Visitor Complex, operated by Delaware North since 1995, has a variety of exhibits, artifacts, displays and attractions on the history and future of human and robotic spaceflight. Bus tours of KSC originate from here. The complex also includes the separate Apollo/Saturn V Center, north of the VAB and the United States Astronaut Hall of Fame, six miles west near Titusville. There were 1.5\u00a0million visitors in 2009. It had some 700 employees.\nIt was announced on May 29, 2015, that the Astronaut Hall of Fame exhibit would be moved from its current location to another location within the Visitor Complex to make room for an upcoming high-tech attraction entitled \"Heroes and Legends\". The attraction, designed by Orlando-based design firm Falcon's Treehouse, opened November 11, 2016.\nIn March 2016, the visitor center unveiled the new location of the iconic countdown clock at the complex's entrance; previously, the clock was located with a flagpole at the press site. The clock was originally built and installed in 1969 and listed with the flagpole in the National Register of Historic Places in January 2000. In 2019, NASA celebrated the 50th anniversary of the Apollo program, and the launch of Apollo 10 on May 18. In summer of 2019, Lunar Module 9 (LM-9) was relocated to the Apollo/Saturn V Center as part of an initiative to rededicate the center and celebrate the 50th anniversary of the Apollo Program.\nHistoric locations.\nNASA lists the following Historic Districts at KSC; each district has multiple associated facilities:\nThere are 24 historic properties outside of these historic districts, including the Space Shuttle \"Atlantis\", Vehicle Assembly Building, Crawlerway, and Operations and Checkout Building. KSC has one National Historic Landmark, 78 National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) listed or eligible sites, and 100 Archaeological Sites.\nWeather.\nFlorida's peninsular shape and temperature contrasts between land and ocean provide ideal conditions for electrical storms, earning Central Florida the reputation as \"lightning capital of the United States\". This makes extensive lightning protection and detection systems necessary to protect employees, structures and spacecraft on launch pads. On November 14, 1969, Apollo 12 was struck by lightning just after lift-off from Pad 39A, but the flight continued safely. The most powerful lightning strike recorded at KSC occurred at LC-39B on August 25, 2006, while shuttle \"Atlantis\" was being prepared for STS-115. NASA managers were initially concerned that the lightning strike caused damage to \"Atlantis\", but none was found.\nOn September 7, 2004, Hurricane Frances directly hit the area with sustained winds of and gusts up to , the most damaging storm to date. The Vehicle Assembly Building lost 1,000 exterior panels, each x in size. This exposed of the building to the elements. Damage occurred to the south and east sides of the VAB. The shuttle's Thermal Protection System Facility suffered extensive damage. The roof was partially torn off and the interior suffered water damage. Several rockets on display in the center were toppled. Further damage to KSC was caused by Hurricane Wilma in October 2005.\nThe conservative estimate by NASA is that the Space Center will experience 5 to 8 inches of sea level rise by the 2050s. Launch Complex 39A, the site of the Apollo 11 launch, is the most vulnerable to flooding, and has a 14% annual risk of flooding beginning in 2020.\nKSC directors.\nSince KSC's formation, eleven NASA officials have served as directors, including three former astronauts (Crippen, Bridges and Cabana):\nIn popular culture.\nIn addition to being frequently featured in documentaries, Kennedy Space Center has been portrayed on film many times. Some studio movies have even gained access and filmed scenes within the gates of the space center. If extras are needed in those scenes, space center employees are recruited (employees use personal time during filming). Films with scenes at KSC include:\nThe location appears as a major plot point in the finale of \"Stone Ocean\", the 6th part of the manga and anime series \"JoJo's Bizarre Adventure.\"\nKSC is also one of the two primary settings of the 1965\u20131970 television series \"I Dream of Jeannie\" (along with a home in nearby Cocoa Beach), though it was filmed entirely in Los Angeles.\nReferences.\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

As one of the most influential singer-songwriters to emerge from the 1960s folk music circuit, Mitchell became known for her personal lyrics and unconventional compositions, which grew to incorporate elements of pop, jazz, rock, and other genres. Among her accolades are eleven Grammy Awards, and induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1997. \"Rolling Stone\", in 2002, named her \"one of the greatest songwriters ever\", and AllMusic, in a 2011 biography, stated \"Joni Mitchell may stand as the most important and influential female recording artist of the late 20th century.\"\nMitchell began singing in small nightclubs in Saskatoon and throughout western Canada, before moving on to the nightclubs of Toronto. She moved to the United States and began touring in 1965. Some of her original songs (\"Urge for Going\", \"Chelsea Morning\", \"Both Sides, Now\", \"The Circle Game\") were first recorded by other singers, allowing her to sign with Reprise Records and record her debut album, \"Song to a Seagull\", in 1968. Settling in Southern California, Mitchell helped define an era and a generation with popular songs such as \"Big Yellow Taxi\" and \"Woodstock\" (both 1970). Her 1971 album \"Blue\" is often cited as one of the greatest albums of all time; it was rated the 30th best album ever made in \"Rolling Stone\"'s 2003 list of the \"500 Greatest Albums of All Time\", rising to number 3 in the 2020 edition. In 2000, \"The New York Times\" chose \"Blue\" as one of the 25 albums that represented \"turning points and pinnacles in 20th-century popular music\". NPR ranked \"Blue\" number 1 on a 2017 list of the \"Greatest Albums Made By Women\".\nMitchell began exploring more jazz-influenced ideas on 1974's \"Court and Spark\", which featured the radio hits \"Help Me\" and \"Free Man in Paris\" and became her best-selling album. Mitchell's vocal range began to shift from mezzo-soprano to that of a wide-ranging contralto around 1975. Her distinctive piano and open-tuned guitar compositions also grew more harmonically and rhythmically complex as she melded jazz with rock and roll, R&amp;B, classical music and non-Western beats. Starting in the mid-1970s, she began working with noted jazz musicians including Jaco Pastorius, Tom Scott, Wayne Shorter, Herbie Hancock, and Pat Metheny as well as Charles Mingus, who asked her to collaborate on his final recordings. She later turned to pop and electronic music and engaged in political protest. She was awarded the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award in 2002.\nMitchell produced or co-produced most of her albums and designed most of her own album covers, describing herself as a \"painter derailed by circumstance\". A critic of the music industry, she quit touring and released her 19th and last album of original songs in 2007. She gave occasional interviews and made appearances to speak on various causes over the next two decades, though the rupture of a brain aneurysm in 2015 led to a long period of recovery and therapy. A series of retrospective compilations were released over this time period, culminating in the Joni Mitchell Archives, a project to publish much of the unreleased material from her long career. She returned to public appearances in 2021, accepting several awards in person, including a Kennedy Center Honor. Mitchell returned to live performance with an unannounced show at the June 2022 Newport Folk Festival and has made several other appearances since, including headlining shows in 2023 and 2024.\nEarly life and education.\nBorn Roberta Joan Anderson on November 7, 1943, in Fort Macleod, Alberta, Mitchell is the daughter of Myrtle Marguerite (n\u00e9e McKee) and William Andrew Anderson. Her mother's ancestors were Scottish and Irish; her father was from a Norwegian family that may have had some S\u00e1mi ancestry. Her mother was a teacher. Her father was a Royal Canadian Air Force flight lieutenant who instructed new pilots at RCAF Station Fort Macleod. During World War II, she moved with her parents to various bases in western Canada. After the war ended, her father worked as a grocer and her family moved to Saskatchewan, living in Maidstone and North Battleford. She later sang about her small-town upbringing in several of her songs, including \"Song for Sharon\".\nMitchell contracted polio at age nine and was hospitalized for weeks. She also started smoking that year, but denies that smoking has affected her voice.\nShe moved with her family to Saskatoon, which she considers her hometown, at age 11. Mitchell struggled at school; her main interest was painting. During this time she briefly studied classical piano. She focused on her creative talent and considered a singing or dancing career for the first time. One unconventional teacher, Arthur Kratzmann, made an impact on her, stimulating her to write poetry; her first album includes a dedication to him. She dropped out of school in grade 12 (resuming her studies later) and hung out downtown with a rowdy set until she decided that she was getting too close to the criminal world.\nMitchell wanted to play the guitar, but as her mother associated the instrument with country music and disapproved of its hillbilly associations, she initially settled for the ukulele. Eventually she taught herself guitar from a Pete Seeger songbook. Polio had weakened her left hand, so she devised alternative tunings to compensate; she later used these tunings to create nonstandard approaches to harmony and structure in her songwriting.\nMitchell started singing with her friends at bonfires around Waskesiu Lake, northwest of Prince Albert, Saskatchewan. She widened her repertoire to include her favourite performers, such as \u00c9dith Piaf and Miles Davis, at age 18. Her first paid performance was on October 31, 1962, at a Saskatoon club that featured folk and jazz performers. Although she never performed jazz herself in those days, Mitchell and her friends sought out gigs by jazz musicians. Mitchell said, \"My jazz background began with one of the early Lambert, Hendricks and Ross albums.\" That album, \"The Hottest New Group in Jazz\", was hard to find in Canada, she says, \"so I saved up and bought it at a bootleg price. I considered that album to be my Beatles. I learned every song off of it, and I don't think there is another album anywhere\u2014including my own\u2014on which I know every note and word of every song.\"\nAfter graduating from high school at Aden Bowman Collegiate in Saskatoon, Mitchell took art classes at the Saskatoon Technical Collegiate with abstract expressionist painter Henry Bonli and left home to attend the Alberta College of Art in Calgary for the 1963\u201364 school year. She felt disillusioned about the high priority given to technical skill over free-class creativity there, and felt out of step with the trend toward pure abstraction and the tendency to move into commercial art. She dropped out of school after a year at age 20, due to an unexpected pregnancy (with her daughter Kilauren). She then started playing music in the nightclubs of Canada.\nCareer.\n1964\u20131967: Career beginnings, motherhood, and first marriage.\nShe continued to play gigs as a folk musician on weekends at her college and at a local hotel. Around this time she took a $15-a-week job in a Calgary coffeehouse called The Depression Coffee House, \"singing long tragic songs in a minor key\". She sang at hootenannies and made appearances on local TV and radio shows in Calgary. In 1964, at the age of 20, she told her mother that she intended to be a folk singer in Toronto. She left western Canada for the first time in her life, heading east for Ontario. Mitchell wrote her first song, \"Day After Day\", on the three-day train ride. She stopped at the Mariposa Folk Festival to see Buffy Sainte-Marie, an American folk singer who had inspired her. A year later, Mitchell played Mariposa, her first gig for a major audience, and years later Sainte-Marie herself covered Mitchell's work.\nLacking the $200 needed for musicians' union fees, Mitchell performed at a few gigs at the Half Beat and the Village Corner in Toronto's Yorkville neighbourhood, but she mostly played non-union gigs \"in church basements and YMCA meeting halls\". Rejected from major folk clubs, she resorted to busking, while she \"worked in the women's wear section of a downtown department store to pay the rent.\" She lived in a rooming house, directly across the hall from poet Duke Redbird. Mitchell also began to realize each city's folk scene tended to accord veteran performers the exclusive right to play their signature songs\u2014despite not having written the songs\u2014which Mitchell found insular, contrary to the egalitarian ideal of folk music. She found her best traditional material was already other singers' property. She said she was told \"'You can't sing that. That's my song.' And I named another one. 'You can't sing that. That's my song.' This is my introduction to territorial songs. I ran into it again in Toronto.\" She resolved to write her own songs.\nMitchell discovered that she was pregnant by her Calgary ex-boyfriend Brad MacMath in late 1964. She later wrote, \"[He] left me three months pregnant in an attic room with no money and winter coming on and only a fireplace for heat. The spindles of the banister were gap-toothed\u2014fuel for last winter's occupants.\" She gave birth to a baby girl in February 1965. Unable to provide for her daughter, Kelly Dale Anderson, she placed her for adoption. The experience remained private for most of Mitchell's career, although she alluded to it in several songs, such as \"Little Green\", which she performed in the 1960s and recorded for the 1971 album \"Blue\". In \"Chinese Cafe\", from the 1982 album \"Wild Things Run Fast\", Mitchell sang, \"Your kids are coming up straight / My child's a stranger / I bore her / But I could not raise her.\"\nThe existence of Mitchell's daughter was not publicly known until 1993, when a roommate from Mitchell's art school days in the 1960s sold the story of the adoption to a tabloid magazine. By that time, Mitchell's daughter, renamed Kilauren Gibb, had already begun a search for her biological parents. Mitchell and her daughter met in 1997. After the reunion, Mitchell said that she lost interest in songwriting, and she later identified her daughter's birth and her inability to take care of her as the moment when her songwriting inspiration had begun.\nA few weeks after the birth of her daughter, Mitchell was playing gigs again around Yorkville, often with a friend, Vicky Taylor, and was beginning to sing original material for the first time, written with her unique open tunings. In March and April she found work at the Penny Farthing, a folk club in Toronto. There she met New York City-born American folk singer Charles Scott \"Chuck\" Mitchell, from Michigan. Chuck was immediately attracted to her and impressed by her performance, and he told her that he could get her steady work in the coffeehouses he knew in the United States.\nMitchell left Canada for the first time in late April 1965. She travelled with Chuck Mitchell to the US, where they began playing music together. Joni, 21 years old, married Chuck in an official ceremony in his hometown in June 1965 and took his surname. She said, \"I made my dress and bridesmaids' dresses. We had no money... I walked down the aisle brandishing my daisies.\" Mitchell is both a Canadian and US citizen.\nWhile living at the Verona apartments in Detroit's Cass Corridor, the couple regularly performed at area coffee houses, including the Chess Mate on Livernois, near Six Mile Road; the Alcove bar, near Wayne State University; the Rathskeller, a restaurant on the campus of the University of Detroit; and the Raven Gallery in Southfield. She began playing and composing songs in alternative guitar tunings taught to her by a fellow musician, Eric Andersen, in Detroit. Oscar Brand featured her several times on his CBC television program \"Let's Sing Out\" in 1965 and 1966. The marriage and partnership of Joni and Chuck Mitchell ended with their divorce in early 1967, and she moved to New York City to follow her musical path as a solo artist. She played venues up and down the East Coast, including Philadelphia, Boston, and Fort Bragg, North Carolina. She performed frequently in coffeehouses and folk clubs and, by this time creating her own material, became well known for her unique songwriting and innovative guitar style.\n1968\u20131969: Breakthrough with \"Song to a Seagull\" and \"Clouds\".\nFolk singer Tom Rush had met Mitchell in Toronto and was impressed with her songwriting ability. He took \"Urge for Going\" to the popular folk artist Judy Collins, but she was not interested in the song at the time, so Rush recorded it himself. Country singer George Hamilton IV heard Rush performing it and recorded a hit country version. Other artists who recorded Mitchell's songs in the early years were Sainte-Marie (\"The Circle Game\"), Dave Van Ronk (\"Both Sides Now\"), and eventually Collins (\"Both Sides Now\", a top ten hit for her, and \"Michael from Mountains\", were both included on her 1967 album \"Wildflowers\"). Collins also covered \"Chelsea Morning\", another recording that eclipsed Mitchell's own commercial success early on.\nWhile Mitchell was playing one night in 1967 in the Gaslight South, a club in Coconut Grove, Florida, David Crosby walked in and was immediately struck by her ability and her appeal as an artist. She accompanied him back to Los Angeles, where he set about introducing her and her music to his friends. Soon she was being managed by Elliot Roberts, who, after being urged by Sainte-Marie, had first seen her play in a Greenwich Village coffee house. He had a close business association with David Geffen. Roberts and Geffen were to have important influences on her career. She was signed to the Warners-affiliated Reprise label by talent scout Andy Wickham. Crosby convinced Reprise to let Mitchell record a solo acoustic album without the folk-rock overdubs in vogue at that time, and his clout earned him a producer's credit in March 1968, when Reprise released her debut album, known either as \"Joni Mitchell\" or \"Song to a Seagull\".\nMitchell toured steadily to promote the LP. The tour helped create eager anticipation for Mitchell's second LP, \"Clouds\", which was released in April 1969. This album contained Mitchell's own versions of some of her songs already recorded and performed by other artists: \"Chelsea Morning\", \"Both Sides, Now\", and \"Tin Angel\". The covers of both LPs, including a self-portrait on \"Clouds\", were designed and painted by Mitchell, a blending of her painting and music that she continued throughout her career.\n1970\u20131972: \"Ladies of the Canyon\" and \"Blue\".\nIn March 1970, \"Clouds\" produced her first Grammy Award for Best Folk Performance. The following month, Reprise released her third album, \"Ladies of the Canyon\". Mitchell's sound was already beginning to expand beyond the confines of acoustic folk music and toward pop and rock, with more overdubs, percussion, and backing vocals, and for the first time, many songs composed on piano, which became a hallmark of Mitchell's style in her most popular era. Her own version of \"Woodstock\", slower than the cover by Crosby, Stills, Nash &amp; Young, was performed solo on a Wurlitzer electric piano. The album also included the already-familiar song \"The Circle Game\" and the environmental anthem \"Big Yellow Taxi\", with its famous lines, \"they paved paradise and put up a parking lot\", and \"don't it always seem to go, that you don't know what you got till it's gone?\".\n\"Ladies of the Canyon\" was an instant smash on FM radio and sold briskly, eventually becoming Mitchell's first gold album (selling over a half million copies). She made a decision to stop touring for a year and just write and paint, yet she was still voted \"Top Female Performer\" for 1970 by \"Melody Maker\", a leading UK pop music magazine. On the April 1971 release of James Taylor's \"Mud Slide Slim and the Blue Horizon\" album, Mitchell is credited with backup vocals on the track \"You've Got a Friend\". The songs she wrote during the months she took off for travel and life experience appeared on her next album, \"Blue\", released in June 1971. Comparing Joni Mitchell's talent to his own, David Crosby said, \"By the time she did \"Blue\", she was past me and rushing toward the horizon\".\n\"Blue\" was an almost instant critical and commercial success, peaking in the top 20 of the \"Billboard\" albums chart in September and also hitting the British Top 3. The lushly produced \"Carey\" was the single at the time, but musically, other parts of \"Blue\" departed further from the sounds of \"Ladies of the Canyon\". Simpler, rhythmic acoustic parts allowed a focus on Mitchell's voice and emotions (\"All I Want\", \"A Case of You\"), while others such as \"Blue\", \"River\" and \"The Last Time I Saw Richard\" were sung to her rolling piano accompaniment. Her most confessional album, Mitchell later said of \"Blue\", \"I have, on occasion, sacrificed myself and my own emotional makeup,\u00a0... singing 'I'm selfish and I'm sad', for instance. We all suffer for our loneliness, but at the time of \"Blue\", our pop stars never admitted these things.\" In its lyrics, the album was regarded as an inspired culmination of her early work, with depressed assessments of the world around her serving as counterpoint to exuberant expressions of romantic love (for example, in \"California\"). Mitchell later remarked, \"At that period of my life, I had no personal defenses. I felt like a cellophane wrapper on a pack of cigarettes. I felt like I had absolutely no secrets from the world and I couldn't pretend in my life to be strong.\"\n1972\u20131975: \"For the Roses\" and \"Court and Spark\".\nMitchell decided to return to the live stage after the great success of \"Blue\", and she presented new songs on tour which appeared on her next album, her fifth, \"For the Roses\". The album was released in October 1972 and immediately zoomed up the charts. She followed with the single, \"You Turn Me On, I'm a Radio\", which peaked at No. 25 in the \"Billboard\" charts in February 1973.\n\"Court and Spark\", released in January 1974, saw Mitchell begin the flirtation with jazz and jazz fusion that marked her experimental period ahead. \"Court and Spark\" went to No. 1 on the \"Cashbox\" Album Charts. The LP made Mitchell a widely popular act for perhaps the only time in her career, on the strength of popular tracks such as the rocker \"Raised on Robbery\", which was released right before Christmas 1973, and \"Help Me\", which was released in March of the following year, and became Mitchell's only Top 10 single when it peaked at No. 7 in the first week of June. \"Free Man in Paris\" was another hit single and staple in her catalogue.\nWhile recording \"Court and Spark\", Mitchell had tried to make a clean break with her earlier folk sound, producing the album herself and employing jazz/pop fusion band the L.A. Express as what she called her first real backing group. In February 1974, her tour with the L.A. Express began, and they received rave notices as they travelled across the United States and Canada during the next two months. A series of shows at L.A.'s Universal Amphitheater from August 14\u201317 were recorded for a live album. In November, Mitchell released that album, \"Miles of Aisles\", a two-record set including all but two songs from the L.A. concerts (one selection each from the Berkeley Community Theatre, on March 2, and the L.A. Music Center, on March 4, were also included in the set). The live album slowly moved up to No. 2, matching \"Court and Spark\"'s chart peak on \"Billboard\". \"Big Yellow Taxi\", the live version, was also released as a single and did reasonably well (she released another version of the song in 2007).\nIn January 1975, \"Court and Spark\" received four nominations for Grammy Awards, including Grammy Award for Album of the Year, for which Mitchell was the only woman nominated. She won only the Grammy Award for Best Arrangement, Instrumental and Vocals.\n1975\u20131977: \"The Hissing of Summer Lawns\" and \"Hejira\".\nMitchell went into the studio in early 1975 to record acoustic demos of some songs that she had written since the \"Court and Spark\" tour. A few months later she recorded versions of the tunes with her band. Her musical interests were diverging from both the folk and the pop scene of the era, toward less structured, more jazz-inspired pieces, with a wider range of instruments. The new song cycle was released in November 1975 as \"The Hissing of Summer Lawns\". On \"The Jungle Line\", she made an early effort at sampling a recording of African musicians, something that became more commonplace among Western rock acts in the 1980s. \"In France They Kiss on Main Street\" continued the lush pop sounds of \"Court and Spark\", and efforts such as the title song and \"Edith and the Kingpin\" chronicled the underbelly of suburban lives in Southern California.\nDuring 1975, Mitchell also participated in several concerts in the Rolling Thunder Revue tours featuring Bob Dylan and Joan Baez, and in 1976 she performed as part of \"The Last Waltz\" by the Band. In January 1976, Mitchell received a nomination for the Grammy Award for Best Female Pop Vocal Performance for the album \"The Hissing of Summer Lawns\", though the 1976 Grammy for that category went to Linda Ronstadt.\nIn early 1976, Mitchell travelled with friends who were driving cross country to Maine. Afterwards, she drove back to California alone and composed several songs during her journey which featured on her next album, 1976's \"Hejira\". She stated that \"This album was written mostly while I was traveling in the car. That's why there were no piano songs\u00a0...\" \"Hejira\" was arguably Mitchell's most experimental album so far, owing to her ongoing collaborations with jazz virtuoso bass guitarist Jaco Pastorius on several songs, namely the first single, \"Coyote\", the atmospheric \"Hejira\", the disorienting, guitar-heavy \"Black Crow\", and the album's last song \"Refuge of the Roads\". The album climbed to No. 13 on the Billboard Charts, reaching gold status three weeks after release, and received airplay from album-oriented FM rock stations. Yet \"Coyote\", backed with \"Blue Motel Room\", failed to chart on the Hot 100. \"Hejira\" \"did not sell as briskly as Mitchell's earlier, more 'radio-friendly' albums, [but] its stature in her catalogue has grown over the years\". Mitchell herself believes the album to be unique. In 2006 she said, \"I suppose a lot of people could have written a lot of my other songs, but I feel the songs on \"Hejira\" could only have come from me.\"\n1977\u20131980: \"Don Juan's Reckless Daughter\" and \"Mingus\".\nIn mid-1977, Mitchell began work on new recordings that became her first double studio album, \"Don Juan's Reckless Daughter\". Close to completing her contract with Asylum Records, Mitchell felt that this album could be looser in feel than any album she had done in the past. She invited Pastorius back, and he brought with him fellow members of jazz fusion pioneers Weather Report, including drummer Don Alias and saxophonist Wayne Shorter. Layered, atmospheric compositions such as \"Overture/Cotton Avenue\" featured more improvisatory collaboration, while \"Paprika Plains\" was a 16-minute epic that stretched the boundaries of pop, owing more to Mitchell's memories of childhood in Canada and her study of classical music. \"Dreamland\" and \"The Tenth World\", featuring Chaka Khan on backing vocals, were percussion-dominated tracks. Other songs continued the jazz-rock-folk collisions of \"Hejira\". Mitchell also revived \"Jericho\", written years earlier (a version is found on her 1974 live album) but never recorded in a studio setting. The album was released in December 1977, receiving mixed reviews but selling relatively well, peaking at No. 25 in the US and going gold within three months. \nMitchell wore blackface and a pimp outfit on the album cover, one of the most controversial moments of her career that has been widely criticized as racist. She called her blackface alter ego \"Art Nouveau\", inspired by a black man who once complimented her while walking down an LA street. She wore blackface several more times throughout her career and has consistently defended her use of it as late as 2017. However, in 2024, the album cover art on streaming services and physical reissues was changed to a photo of Mitchell\u2019s face seemingly inside the open mouth of a wolflike dog, an outtake from the 1985 photo sessions for the later album \"Dog Eat Dog\". No announcement was made about the change nor any official reason given, and Mitchell has not commented on the matter.\nA few months after the release of \"Don Juan's Reckless Daughter\", Mitchell was contacted by the esteemed jazz composer, bandleader and bassist Charles Mingus, who had heard the orchestrated song \"Paprika Plains\", and wanted her to work with him. She began a collaboration with Mingus, who died before the project was completed in 1979. She finished the tracks, and the resulting album, \"Mingus\", was released in June 1979, though it was poorly received in the press. Fans were confused over such a major change in Mitchell's overall sound, and though the album topped out at No. 17 on the \"Billboard\" albums chart\u2014a higher placement than \"Don Juan's Reckless Daughter\"\u2014\"Mingus\" still fell short of gold status, making it her first album since the 1960s not to sell at least half a million copies.\nMitchell's tour to promote \"Mingus\" began in August 1979 in Oklahoma City and concluded six weeks later with five shows at Los Angeles' Greek Theatre and one at the Santa Barbara County Bowl, where she recorded and filmed the concert. It was her first tour in several years, and with Pastorius, jazz guitarist Pat Metheny, and other members of her band, Mitchell also performed songs from her other jazz-inspired albums. When the tour ended she began a year of work, turning the tapes from the Santa Barbara County Bowl show into a two-album set and a concert film, both to be called \"Shadows and Light\". Her final release on Asylum Records and her second live double album, it was released in September 1980, and made it up to No. 38 on the \"Billboard\" charts. A single from the LP, \"Why Do Fools Fall in Love?\", Mitchell's duet with The Persuasions (her opening act for the tour), bubbled under on \"Billboard\", just missing the Hot 100.\n1981\u20131987: \"Wild Things Run Fast\", \"Dog Eat Dog\", and second marriage.\nFor a year and a half, Mitchell worked on the tracks for her next album.\nWhile the album was being readied for release, her friend David Geffen, founder of Asylum Records, decided to start a new label, Geffen Records. Still distributed by Warner Bros. (who controlled Asylum Records), Geffen negated the remaining contractual obligations Mitchell had with Asylum and signed her to his new label. \"Wild Things Run Fast\" (1982) marked a return to pop songwriting, including \"Chinese Cafe/Unchained Melody\", which incorporated the chorus and parts of the melody of the famous The Righteous Brothers hit, and \"(You're So Square) Baby I Don't Care\", a remake of the Elvis chestnut, which charted higher than any Mitchell single since her 1970s sales peak when it climbed to No. 47 on the charts. The album peaked on the \"Billboard\" charts in its fifth week at No. 25. During this period she recorded with bassist and sound engineer Larry Klein, whom she married in 1982.\nIn early 1983, Mitchell began her \"Refuge\" world tour, visiting Japan, Australia, New Zealand, Ireland, the United Kingdom, Belgium, France, Germany, Italy and Scandinavia and then going back to the United States. A performance from the tour was videotaped and later released on home video (and later DVD) as \"Refuge of the Roads\". As 1984 ended, Mitchell was writing new songs when she received a suggestion from Geffen that perhaps an outside producer with experience in the modern technical arenas that they wanted to explore might be a worthy addition. Mitchell hired the British synthpop musician Thomas Dolby to assist with synthesizers and production, but found working with him difficult: \"I was reluctant when Thomas was suggested because he had been asked to produce the record [by Geffen], and would he consider coming in as just a programmer and a player? So on that level we did have some problems\u00a0... He may be able to do it faster. He may be able to do it better, but the fact is that it then wouldn't really be my music.\"\n\"Dog Eat Dog\", released in October 1985, was only a moderate seller, reaching No. 63 on \"Billboard\"'s Top Albums Chart, Mitchell's lowest chart position since her first album peaked at No. 189 almost eighteen years before. One of the songs on the album, \"Tax Free\", created controversy by lambasting \"televangelists\" and what she saw as a drift to the religious right in American politics. \"The churches came after me\", she wrote, \"they attacked me, though the Episcopalian Church, which I've seen described as the only church in America which actually uses its head, wrote me a letter of congratulation.\"\n1988\u20131993: \"Chalk Mark in a Rain Storm\" and \"Night Ride Home\".\nMitchell continued experimenting with synthesizers, drum machines and sequencers for the recordings of her next album, 1988's \"Chalk Mark in a Rain Storm\". She also collaborated with artists including Willie Nelson, Billy Idol, Wendy &amp; Lisa, Tom Petty, Don Henley, Peter Gabriel, and Benjamin Orr of the Cars. The album's first official single, \"My Secret Place\", was a duet with Gabriel, and reached the top 50 on the Canadian singles chart. The song \"Lakota\" was one of many songs on the album to take on larger political themes, in this case the Wounded Knee incident, the deadly battle between Native American activists and the FBI on Pine Ridge Indian Reservation in the previous decade. Musically, several songs fit into the trend of world music popularized by Gabriel during the era. Reviews were mostly favourable towards the album, and the cameos by well-known musicians brought it considerable attention. \"Chalk Mark\" ultimately improved on the chart performance of \"Dog Eat Dog\", peaking at No. 45.\nIn 1990, Mitchell, who by then rarely performed live, participated in Roger Waters' \"The Wall Concert in Berlin\". She performed the song \"Goodbye Blue Sky\" and was also one of the performers on the concert's final song \"The Tide Is Turning\" along with Waters, Cyndi Lauper, Bryan Adams, Van Morrison and Paul Carrack.\nThroughout the first half of 1990, Mitchell recorded songs that appeared on her next album. She delivered the final mixes for the new album to Geffen just before Christmas, after trying nearly a hundred different sequences for the songs. The album \"Night Ride Home\" was released in March 1991. In the United States, it premiered on \"Billboard\"'s Top Albums chart at No. 68, moving up to No. 48 in its second week, and peaking at No. 41 in its sixth week. In the United Kingdom, the album premiered at No. 25 on the albums chart. Critically, it was better received than her 1980s work. This album was also Mitchell's first since Geffen Records was sold to MCA Inc., meaning that \"Night Ride Home\" was her first album not to be initially distributed by WEA (now Warner Music Group).\n1994\u20131999: \"Turbulent Indigo\", \"Taming the Tiger\", and divorce.\nTo wider audiences, the real return to form for Mitchell came with 1994's Grammy-winning \"Turbulent Indigo\". The recording of the album coincided with the end of Mitchell's marriage to musician Larry Klein after 12 years; Klein was also co-producer of the album.\n\"Indigo\" was seen as Mitchell's most accessible set of songs in years. Songs such as \"Sex Kills\", \"Sunny Sunday\", \"Borderline\" and \"The Magdalene Laundries\" mixed social commentary and guitar-focused melodies for \"a startling comeback\". The album won two Grammy awards, including Best Pop Album, and it coincided with a much-publicized resurgence in interest in Mitchell's work by a younger generation of singer-songwriters.\nIn 1996, Mitchell agreed to release a greatest \"Hits\" collection, despite initial concerns that such a release would damage sales of her catalogue. Reprise also agreed to release a second album, called \"Misses\", that would include some of the lesser-known songs from her career. \"Hits\" charted at No. 161 in the US, and achieved gold certification in the UK and Australia. Mitchell also included on \"Hits\", for the first time on an album, her first recording, a version of \"Urge for Going\" which preceded \"Song to a Seagull\" but was previously released only as a B-side.\nTwo years later, Mitchell released her final set of \"original\" new work before nearly a decade of other pursuits, 1998's \"Taming the Tiger\". She promoted \"Tiger\" with a return to regular concert appearances, including a co-headlining tour with Bob Dylan and Van Morrison.\nOn the album, Mitchell had played a custom guitar equipped with a Roland hexaphonic pick-up that connected to a Roland VG-8 modelling processor. The device allowed Mitchell to play any of her many alternate tunings without having to re-tune the guitar. The guitar's output, through the VG-8, was transposed to any of her tunings in real-time.\nIt was around this time that critics also began to notice a real change in Mitchell's voice, particularly on her older songs; the singer later confirmed the change, explaining that \"I'd go to hit a note and there was nothing there\". While her more limited range and huskier vocals have sometimes been attributed to her smoking (she was described by journalist Robin Eggar as \"one of the world's last great smokers\"), Mitchell believes that the changes in her voice that became noticeable in the 1990s were because of other problems, including vocal nodules, a compressed larynx, and the lingering effects of having had polio. In an interview in 2004, she denied that \"my terrible habits\" had anything to do with her more limited range, and pointed out that singers often lose the upper register when they pass fifty. In addition, she contended that her voice had acquired a more interesting and expressive alto range when she could no longer hit the high notes, let alone hold them as she had in her youth.\n2000\u20132005: \"Both Sides Now\", retirement tour and retrospectives.\nThe singer's next two albums featured no new songs and, Mitchell has said, were recorded to \"fulfill contractual obligations\", but on both she attempted to make use of her new vocal range in interpreting familiar material. \"Both Sides Now\" (2000) was an album composed mostly of covers of jazz standards, performed with an orchestra, featuring orchestral arrangements by Vince Mendoza. The album also contained remakes of \"A Case of You\" and the title track \"Both Sides, Now\", two early hits transposed down to Mitchell's new dusky, soulful alto range. It received mostly strong reviews and motivated a short national tour, with Mitchell accompanied by a core band featuring her ex-husband Larry Klein on bass plus a local orchestra on each tour stop. Its success led to 2002's \"Travelogue\", a collection of re-workings of her previous songs with lush orchestral accompaniments.\nMitchell stated at the time that \"Travelogue\" would be her final album. In a 2002 interview with \"Rolling Stone\", she voiced discontent with the state of the music industry, describing it as a \"cesspool\". Mitchell expressed her dislike of the record industry's dominance and her desire to control her own destiny, possibly by releasing her own music over the Internet.\nDuring the next few years, the only albums Mitchell released were compilations of her earlier work. In 2003, her Geffen recordings were collected in a remastered four-disc box set, \"The Complete Geffen Recordings\", including notes by Mitchell and three previously unreleased tracks. A series of themed compilations of songs from earlier albums were also released: \"The Beginning of Survival\" (2004), \"Dreamland\" (2004), and \"Songs of a Prairie Girl\" (2005), the last of which collected the threads of her Canadian upbringing and which she released after accepting an invitation to the Saskatchewan Centennial concert in Saskatoon. The concert, which featured a tribute to Mitchell, was also attended by Queen Elizabeth II. In the \"Prairie Girl\" liner notes, she wrote that the collection is \"my contribution to Saskatchewan's Centennial celebrations\".\nIn the early 1990s, Mitchell signed a deal with Random House to publish an autobiography. In 1998 she told \"The New York Times\" that her memoirs were \"in the works\", that they would be published in as many as four volumes, and that the first line would be \"I was the only black man at the party.\" In 2005, Mitchell said that she was using a tape recorder to get her memories \"down in the oral tradition\".\n2006\u20132010: \"Shine\" and other late recordings.\nIn an interview with the \"Ottawa Citizen\" in October 2006, Mitchell \"revealed that she was recording her first collection of new songs in nearly a decade\", but gave few other details. Four months later, in an interview with \"The New York Times\", Mitchell said that the forthcoming album, titled \"Shine\", was inspired by the war in Iraq and \"something her grandson had said while listening to family fighting: 'Bad dreams are good\u2014in the great plan.'\" Early media reports characterized the album as having \"a minimal feel\u00a0... that harks back to [Mitchell's] early work\" and a focus on political and environmental issues.\nIn February 2007, Mitchell returned to Calgary and served as an advisor for the Alberta Ballet Company premiere of \"The Fiddle and the Drum\", a dance choreographed by Jean Grand-Ma\u00eetre to both new and old songs. She worked with the French-Canadian TV director Mario Rouleau, well known for work in art and dance for television, such as Cirque du Soleil. She also filmed portions of the rehearsals for a documentary that she was working on. Of the flurry of recent activity she quipped, \"I've never worked so hard in my life.\"\nIn mid-2007, Mitchell's official fan-run site confirmed speculation that she had signed a two-record deal with Starbucks' Hear Music label. \"Shine\" was released by the label on September 25, 2007, debuting at number 14 on the \"Billboard\" 200 album chart, her highest chart position in the United States since the release of \"Hejira\" in 1976, over thirty years previously, and at number 36 on the United Kingdom albums chart. On the same day, Herbie Hancock, a longtime associate and friend of Mitchell, released \"\", an album paying tribute to Mitchell's work. Among the album's contributors were Norah Jones, Tina Turner, Leonard Cohen, and Mitchell herself, who contributed a vocal to the re-recording of \"The Tea Leaf Prophecy (Lay Down Your Arms)\" (originally on her album \"Chalk Mark in a Rain Storm\"). On February 10, 2008, Hancock's recording won Album of the Year at the Grammy Awards. It was the first time in 43 years that a jazz artist had taken the top prize at the annual award ceremony. In accepting the award, Hancock paid tribute to Mitchell as well as to Miles Davis and John Coltrane. At the same ceremony Mitchell won a Grammy for Best Instrumental Pop Performance for the opening track, \"One Week Last Summer\", from her album \"Shine\".\nIn 2009, Mitchell stated she had the skin condition Morgellons and that she would leave the music industry to work toward giving more credibility to people who suffer from Morgellons.\nIn a 2010 interview with the \"Los Angeles Times\", Mitchell was quoted as saying that singer-songwriter Bob Dylan, with whom she had worked closely in the past, was a fake and a plagiarist. The controversial remark was widely reported by other media. Mitchell did not explain the contention further, but several media outlets speculated that it may have related to the allegations of plagiarism surrounding some lyrics on Dylan's 2006 album \"Modern Times\". In a 2013 interview with Jian Ghomeshi, she was asked about the comments and responded by denying that she had made the statement. She also mentioned the allegations of plagiarism that arose over the lyrics to Dylan's 2001 album \"Love and Theft\", in the general context of the flow and ebb of the creative process of artists.\n2010\u20132022: Health problems, recovery, and archival projects.\nAlthough Mitchell said that she would no longer tour or give concerts, she made occasional public appearances to speak on environmental issues. Mitchell divides her time between her longtime home in Los Angeles, and the property in Sechelt, British Columbia, that she has owned since the early 1970s. \"L.A. is my workplace\", she said in 2006, \"B.C. is my heartbeat\". Since 2011, she said she focuses mainly on her visual art, which she does not sell and displays only on rare occasions.\nIn March 2015, Mitchell suffered a brain aneurysm rupture, which required her to undergo physical therapy and take part in daily rehabilitation. Mitchell made her first public appearance following the aneurysm when she attended a Chick Corea concert in Los Angeles in August 2016. She made a few other appearances, and in November 2018 David Crosby said that she was learning to walk again.\nSince 2018, Mitchell has approved a number of archival projects. In September 2018, Eagle Rock Entertainment released the Murray Lerner-directed documentary \"Both Sides Now: Live at the Isle of Wight Festival 1970\", which included restored video footage and previously unseen interviews with Mitchell, plus a separate program featuring the complete concert uninterrupted. On November 2, 2018, Mitchell released an 8-LP vinyl reissue of \"Love Has Many Faces: A Quartet, A Ballet, Waiting to Be Danced\". A limited-edition blue vinyl edition of \"Blue\" followed in January 2019.\nOn November 7, 2018, Mitchell attended the \"\" concert in Los Angeles. To celebrate her 75th birthday, artists Brandi Carlile, Emmylou Harris, James Taylor, Chaka Khan, Graham Nash, Seal, Kris Kristofferson, and others interpreted songs written by Mitchell. Fellow Canadian artist Diana Krall offered two performances. Selections from that night's performances were released on DVD, along with a separate CD release. A vinyl edition of the album was released for Record Store Day in April 2019. Mitchell later attended another tribute concert, Songs Are Like Tattoos, which featured \"Joni 75\" participant Brandi Carlile performing Mitchell's \"Blue\" album in full.\nMitchell approved \"Joni: The Joni Mitchell Sessions\", a book of photos taken and collected by Norman Seeff, released in November 2018. Mitchell also revisited her poetry with \"Morning Glory on the Vine\", a collection of facsimile handwritten lyrics, poetry and artwork originally compiled in 1971 as a gift for friends and family. The expanded and reformatted wide-release edition of \"Morning Glory on the Vine\" was published on October 22, 2019, in a standard hardcover edition, as well as a limited signed edition.\nIn September 2020, it was announced that Mitchell and Rhino Records had created the Joni Mitchell Archives, a series of catalogue releases containing material from the singer's personal vaults. The project's first release, a five-disc collection titled \"\", followed on October 30, 2020. In April 2022 Mitchell received a Grammy Award for 'Best Historical Album' for this release. She showed up personally to collect the award. On the same day, Mitchell released \"Early Joni \u2013 1963\" and \"Live at Canterbury House \u2013 1967\" (both culled from the 5-CD box set) as standalone vinyl releases.\nA special remastered collection of Mitchell's first four albums (\"Song to a Seagull\", \"Clouds\", \"Ladies of the Canyon\" and \"Blue)\" was released on July 2, 2021, as \"The Reprise Albums (1968\u20131971)\". The collection is the first to feature a new mix of Mitchell's 1968 debut album, overseen by Mitchell herself. Commenting on the original mix of \"Song to a Seagull\", Mitchell called it \"atrocious\" and said it sounded like it \"had been recorded under a bowl of Jello\".\nOn January 28, 2022, Mitchell demanded that Spotify remove her songs from its streaming service in solidarity with her long-time friend and fellow childhood polio survivor Neil Young, who removed his tracks from the streaming platform in protest against COVID-19 misinformation on the popular Spotify-hosted podcast \"The Joe Rogan Experience\". She wrote on her website: \"Irresponsible people are spreading lies that are costing people their lives. I stand in solidarity with Neil Young and the global scientific and medical communities on this issue.\" British National Health Service doctor and author Rachel Clarke tweeted: \"Both Neil Young &amp; Joni Mitchell\u2026 know painfully well how much harm, suffering &amp; avoidable death anti-vaxxers can cause.\"\nOn April 1, 2022, Mitchell was honoured as the 2022 MusiCares Person of the Year by the Recording Academy. Mitchell was present at the Awards show accepting the award personally.\nSince 2022: Return to live performances.\nOn July 24, 2022, Joni Mitchell appeared unannounced as a special guest in the closing performance of the final day of the Newport Folk Festival in Rhode Island, where she had first played in 1967, as part of a set billed as \"Brandi Carlile and Friends\". Supported by a group of well-wisher musicians, she participated in a 13-song set of her own material and covers, including one that she played as a solo on electric guitar.\nIn 2017, Mitchell had been inspired by a music-making visit from an old friend, singer-songwriter Eric Andersen, to begin hosting monthly music sessions at her home in Laurel Canyon. The sessions became known as \"Joni Jams\". Brandi Carlile organized the sessions and recruited musicians, and among those who came over the years to play music and sing in Mitchell's living room were Elton John, Paul McCartney, Bonnie Raitt, Harry Styles, Chaka Khan, Marcus Mumford, Herbie Hancock, Jess Wolfe, Holly Laessig, Taylor Goldsmith, Blake Mills, and Hozier. \nMitchell was delighted by the return of music to her home. The music sessions raised her spirits and assisted her recovery from the serious and disabling aneurysm she had suffered in 2015, and she began to sing in the sessions and learn to play guitar again. As her health improved, a return to live performance began to seem possible, plans were cautiously laid, a set list was prepared; and in July 2022, after a rehearsal the night before, Mitchell joined Carlile and others on stage at the Newport Festival for a live Joni Jam, her first public performance in nine years.\nMitchell was given an ecstatic reception, and she said afterwards, \"I was delighted and honoured. It gave me the bug for it.\" Songs performed included \"Carey\", \"Come in from the Cold\", \"A Case of You\", \"Big Yellow Taxi\", \"Both Sides Now\", \"The Circle Game\" and Gershwin and Heyward's \"Summertime\". After her appearance at Newport, Mitchell told Carlile, \"I want to do another show. I want to play again.\" The Newport set was released as a live album in 2023 and won the Grammy Award for Best Folk Album in 2024.\nOn October 19, 2022, Carlile announced that Mitchell would play a headline concert, billed as \"Joni Jam 2\", in a weekend event at Washington State's Gorge Amphitheatre, \"one of the most beautiful venues in the world\", on June 10, 2023. Mitchell's last official headline shows had been on the Both Sides Now tour in 2000. Her 2023 appearance at Gorge Amphitheatre attracted a capacity audience of 27,000. In her first headline concert in 23 years, supported by 19 singers and musicians, Mitchell performed a nearly three-hour set of 21 songs plus a three-song encore in which she played guitar. Annie Lennox, who sang on \"Ladies of the Canyon\", said Mitchell was \"a visionary, a legend and an inspiration.\"\nMitchell was awarded the 2023 Gershwin Prize for her lifetime contributions to popular music. She was celebrated with a concert on March 2 in Washington, D.C., where musicians taking part included Brandi Carlile, Annie Lennox, Ang\u00e9lique Kidjo, Herbie Hancock, Diana Krall, Cyndi Lauper, Graham Nash, James Taylor, Ledisi, Lucius, Marcus Mumford, Sara Bareilles and Celisse. Mitchell performed \"Summertime\" and participated in all-star renditions of her songs \"Big Yellow Taxi\" and \"The Circle Game\".\nOn February 4, 2024, Mitchell performed for the first time at the 66th Annual Grammy Awards. Further Joni Jam concert dates were announced for Saturday October 19 and Sunday October 20, 2024, at the 18,000 capacity Hollywood Bowl, where Mitchell performed three-hour sets with Brandi Carlile, Marcus Mumford, Annie Lennox and numerous supporting musicians.\nOn March 22, 2024, Mitchell restored her music to Spotify after Neil Young did the same, ending her protest over Spotify's hosting of \"The Joe Rogan Experience\".\nLegacy.\nGuitar style.\nWhile some of Mitchell's most popular songs were written on the piano, almost every song she composed on the guitar uses an open, or non-standard, tuning; she has written songs in some 50 tunings, playing what she has called \"Joni's weird chords\". The use of alternative tunings allows guitarists to produce accompaniment with more varied and wide-ranging textures. Her right-hand picking/strumming technique has evolved over the years from an initially intricate picking style, typified by the guitar songs on her first album, to a looser and more rhythmic style, sometimes incorporating percussive \"slaps\".\nIn 1995, Mitchell's friend Fred Walecki, proprietor of Westwood Music in Los Angeles, developed a solution to alleviate her continuing frustration with using multiple alternative tunings in live settings. Walecki designed a Stratocaster-style guitar to function with the Roland VG-8 virtual guitar, a system capable of configuring her numerous tunings electronically. While the guitar itself remained in standard tuning, the VG-8 encoded the pick-up signals into digital signals which were then translated into the altered tunings. This allowed Mitchell to use one guitar on stage, while an off-stage tech entered the preprogrammed tuning for each song in her set.\nMitchell was highly innovative harmonically in her early work (1966\u20131972), incorporating modality, chromaticism, and pedal points. On her 1968 debut album \"Song to a Seagull\", Mitchell used both quartal and quintal harmony in \"The Dawntreader\" and quintal harmony in \"Song to a Seagull\".\nIn 2003, \"Rolling Stone\" named her the 72nd-greatest guitarist of all time; she was the highest-ranked woman on the list.\nInfluence.\nMitchell's approach to music struck a chord with many female listeners. In an era dominated by the stereotypical male rock star, she presented herself as \"multidimensional and conflicted\u00a0... allow[ing] her to build such a powerful identification among her female fans\". Mitchell asserted her desire for artistic control throughout her career, and still holds the publishing rights for her music. She has disclaimed the notion that she is a \"feminist\"; in a 2013 interview she rejected the label, stating, \"I'm not a feminist. I don't want to get a posse against men. I'd rather go toe-to-toe; work it out.\" David Shumway notes that Mitchell \"became the first woman in popular music to be recognized as an artist in the full sense of that term... Whatever Mitchell's stated views of feminism, what she represents more than any other performer of her era is the new prominence of women's perspectives in cultural and political life.\"\nMitchell's work has had an influence on many other artists, including Taylor Swift, Bj\u00f6rk, Prince, Ellie Goulding, Harry Styles, Corinne Bailey Rae, Gabrielle Aplin, Mikael \u00c5kerfeldt from Opeth, Pink Floyd's David Gilmour, Marillion members Steve Hogarth and Steve Rothery, their former vocalist and lyricist Fish, Paul Carrack, Haim, Lorde, and Clairo. Madonna has also cited Mitchell as the first female artist that really spoke to her as a teenager; \"I was really, really into Joni Mitchell. I knew every word to \"Court and Spark\"; I worshipped her when I was in high school. \"Blue\" is amazing. I would have to say of all the women I've heard, she had the most profound effect on me from a lyrical point of view.\"\nSeveral artists have had success covering Mitchell's songs. Judy Collins's 1967 recording of \"Both Sides, Now\" reached No. 8 on \"Billboard\" charts and was a breakthrough in the career of both artists. (Mitchell's own recording did not see release until two years later, on her second album \"Clouds\".) This is Mitchell's most-covered song by far, with over 1,200 versions recorded at latest count. Hole also covered \"Both Sides, Now\" in 1991 on their debut album, \"Pretty on the Inside\", retitling it \"Clouds\", with the lyrics altered by frontwoman Courtney Love. Pop group Neighborhood in 1970 and Amy Grant in 1995 scored hits with covers of \"Big Yellow Taxi\", the third-most covered song in Mitchell's repertoire (with over 300 covers). More recent releases of this song included versions by Counting Crows in 2002 and Nena in 2007. Janet Jackson used a sample of the chorus of \"Big Yellow Taxi\" as the centerpiece of her 1997 hit single \"Got 'Til It's Gone\", which also features rapper Q-Tip saying \"Joni Mitchell never lies\". \"River\", from Mitchell's album \"Blue\" became the second-most covered song of Mitchell's in 2013 as many artists chose it for their holiday albums. Rap artists Kanye West and Mac Dre have also sampled Mitchell's vocals in their music. In addition, Annie Lennox has covered \"Ladies of the Canyon\" for the B-side of her 1995 hit \"No More I Love You's\". Mandy Moore covered \"Help Me\" in 2003. In 2004 singer George Michael covered her song \"Edith and the Kingpin\" for a radio show. \"River\" has been one of the most popular songs covered in recent years, with versions by Dianne Reeves (1999), James Taylor (recorded for television in 2000, and for CD release in 2004), Allison Crowe (2004), Rachael Yamagata (2004), Aimee Mann (2005), and Sarah McLachlan (2006). McLachlan also did a version of \"Blue\" in 1996, and Cat Power recorded a cover of \"Blue\" in 2008. Other Mitchell covers include the famous \"Woodstock\" by Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young, Eva Cassidy, and Matthews Southern Comfort; \"This Flight Tonight\" by Nazareth; and well-known versions of \"A Case of You\" by Tori Amos, Michelle Branch, Jane Monheit, Prince, Diana Krall, James Blake, and Ana Moura. A 40th anniversary version of \"Woodstock\" was released in 2009 by Nick Vernier Band featuring Ian Matthews (formerly of Matthews Southern Comfort). Fellow Canadian singer k.d. lang recorded two of Mitchell's songs (\"A Case of You\" and \"Jericho\") for her 2004 album \"Hymns of the 49th Parallel\" which is composed entirely of songs written by Canadian artists.\nPrince's version of \"A Case of U\" appeared on \"A Tribute to Joni Mitchell\", a 2007 compilation released by Nonesuch Records, which also featured Bj\u00f6rk (\"The Boho Dance\"), Caetano Veloso (\"Dreamland\"), Emmylou Harris (\"The Magdalene Laundries\"), Sufjan Stevens (\"Free Man in Paris\") and Cassandra Wilson (\"For the Roses\"), among others.\nSeveral other songs reference Joni Mitchell. The song \"Our House\" by Graham Nash refers to Nash's two-year relationship with Mitchell at the time that Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young recorded the \"D\u00e9j\u00e0 Vu\" album. Led Zeppelin's \"Going to California\" was said to be written about Robert Plant and Jimmy Page's infatuation with Mitchell, a claim that seems to be borne out by the fact that, in live performances, Plant often says \"Joni\" after the line \"To find a queen without a king, they say she plays guitar and cries and sings\". Jimmy Page uses a double dropped D guitar tuning similar to the alternative tunings Mitchell uses. The Sonic Youth song \"Hey Joni\" is named for Mitchell. Alanis Morissette also mentions Mitchell in one of her songs, \"Your House\". British folk singer Frank Turner mentions Mitchell in his song \"Sunshine State\". The Prince song \"The Ballad of Dorothy Parker\" contains the lyric \u2013 \"'Oh, my favourite song' she said \u2013 and it was Joni singing 'Help me I think I'm falling'\". \"Lavender\" by Marillion was partly influenced by \"going through parks listening to Joni Mitchell\", according to vocalist and lyricist Fish, and she was later mentioned in the lyrics of their song \"Montreal\" from \"Sounds That Can't Be Made\". John Mayer makes reference to Mitchell and her \"Blue\" album in his song \"Queen of California\", from his 2012 album \"Born and Raised\". The song contains the lyric \"Joni wrote \"Blue\" in a house by the sea\". Taylor Swift also details Mitchell's departure from the music industry in her song \"The Lucky One\" from her 2012 album \"Red\".\nIn 2003, playwright Bryden MacDonald launched \"When All the Slaves Are Free\", a musical revue based on Mitchell's music.\nMitchell's music and poems have deeply influenced the French painter Jacques Benoit's work. Between 1979 and 1989 Benoit produced sixty paintings, corresponding to a selection of fifty of Mitchell's songs.\nMaynard James Keenan of the American progressive metal band Tool has cited Mitchell as an influence, claiming that her influence is what allows him to \"soften [staccato, rhythmic, insane mathematical paths] and bring [them] back to the center, so you can listen to it without having an eye-ache.\" A Perfect Circle, another band featuring Keenan as lead vocalist, recorded a rendition of Mitchell's \"The Fiddle and the Drum\" on their 2004 album \"eMOTIVe\", a collection of anti-war cover songs.\nBiopic.\nOn August 18, 2025 it was announced that Cameron Crowe will direct a biopic based on the life and career of Mitchell with Anya Taylor-Joy and Meryl Streep portraying younger and older versions of Mitchell.\nAwards and honours.\nMitchell has received many honours from her home country of Canada. She was inducted into the Canadian Music Hall of Fame in 1981 and received the Governor General's Performing Arts Award for Lifetime Artistic Achievement, Canada's highest honour in the performing arts, in 1996. Mitchell received a star on Canada's Walk of Fame in 2000. In 2002 she was named a Companion of the Order of Canada, Canada's highest civilian honour. She received an honorary doctorate in music from McGill University in 2004. In January 2007 she was inducted into the Canadian Songwriters Hall of Fame. The Saskatchewan Recording Industry Association bestowed upon Joni their Lifetime Achievement Award in 1993. In June 2007 Canada Post featured Mitchell on a postage stamp.\nMitchell has received eleven Grammy Awards during her career (ten competitive, one honorary), the first in 1969 and the most recent in 2024 for Best Folk Album. She received a Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award in 2002, with the citation describing her as \"one of the most important female recording artists of the rock era\" and \"a powerful influence on all artists who embrace diversity, imagination and integrity\".\nIn 1995, Mitchell received Billboard's Century Award. In 1996, she was awarded the Polar Music Prize. In 1997, Mitchell was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, but did not attend the ceremony.\nIn tribute to Mitchell, the TNT network presented an all-star celebration at the Hammerstein Ballroom in New York City on April 6, 2000. Mitchell's songs were sung by many performers, including James Taylor, Elton John, Wynonna Judd, Bryan Adams, Cyndi Lauper, Diana Krall, and Richard Thompson. Mitchell herself ended the evening with a rendition of \"Both Sides, Now\" with a 70-piece orchestra. The version was featured on the soundtrack to the movie \"Love Actually\".\nIn 2008, Mitchell was ranked 42nd on \"Rolling Stone\"'s \"100 Greatest Singers\" list and in 2015 she was ranked ninth on their list of the 100 Greatest Songwriters of All Time.\nOn February 12, 2010, \"Both Sides, Now\" was performed at the 2010 Winter Olympics opening ceremony in Vancouver.\nTo celebrate Mitchell's 70th birthday, the 2013 Luminato Festival in Toronto held a set of tribute concerts entitled \"Joni: A Portrait in Song \u2013 A Birthday Happening Live\" at Massey Hall on June 18 and 19. Performers included Rufus Wainwright, Herbie Hancock, Esperanza Spalding, and rare performances by Mitchell herself.\nDue to health problems, she did not attend the San Francisco gala in May 2015 to receive the SFJAZZ Lifetime Achievement Award.\nIn 2018, the city of Saskatoon erected two plaques to commemorate her musical beginnings in the city. One was installed by the Broadway Theatre beside the former Louis Riel Coffee House, where Mitchell played her first paid gig. A second plaque was installed at River Landing, near the Remai Modern art gallery and Persephone Theatre performing arts centre. As well, the walkway along Spadina Crescent between Second and Third Avenues was formally named the \"Joni Mitchell Promenade\".\nIn 2020, Mitchell received the Les Paul Award, becoming the first woman to be so honoured. She was named as MusiCares Person of the Year in 2022.\nIn 2021, Mitchell was nominated for the Grammy Award for Best Historical Album, for her \"Archives, Vol. 1: The Early Years (1963\u20131967)\" collection. She won the award on April 3, 2022.\nOn December 4, 2021, Mitchell received the Kennedy Center Honor for a lifetime of achievement in the performing arts at the Medallion Ceremony, held at the Library of Congress in Washington, D.C. The next day, Mitchell attended the show at the Kennedy Center.\nOn January 1, 2023, \"Rolling Stone\" magazine ranked Mitchell as number 50 on its list of \"The 200 Greatest Singers of All Time\".\nOn January 12, 2023, Mitchell was named by the Library of Congress as that year's Gershwin Prize recipient with a concert delivered on March 2 in Washington, D.C., in honour of the award.\n\"Rolling Stone\" named Mitchell the 9th greatest guitarist of all time in 2023.\nASCAP Pop Awards.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Awards table/styles.css\" /&gt;\nJuno Awards.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Awards table/styles.css\" /&gt;\n! scope=\"col\" | Year\n! scope=\"col\" | Nominee / work\n! scope=\"col\" | Award\n! scope=\"col\" | Result\nPollstar Concert Industry Awards.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Awards table/styles.css\" /&gt;\n! scope=\"col\" | Year\n! scope=\"col\" | Nominee / work\n! scope=\"col\" | Award\n! scope=\"col\" | Result\n!Ref.\nStudio albums\nDiscography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "16425", "revid": "372290", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=16425", "title": "Justus", "text": "7th-century missionary, Archbishop of Canterbury, and saint\nJustus (died on 10\u00a0November between 627 and 631) was the fourth archbishop of Canterbury. Pope Gregory the Great sent Justus from Italy to England on a mission to Christianise the Anglo-Saxons from their native paganism; he probably arrived with the second group of missionaries despatched in 601. Justus became the first bishop of Rochester in 604 and signed a letter to the Irish bishops urging the native Celtic church to adopt the Roman method of calculating the date of Easter. He attended a church council in Paris in 614.\nFollowing the death of King \u00c6thelberht of Kent in 616, Justus was forced to flee to Gaul but was reinstated in his diocese the following year. In 624, he was elevated to Archbishop of Canterbury, overseeing the despatch of missionaries to Northumbria. After his death, he was revered as a saint and had a shrine in St\u00a0Augustine's Abbey, Canterbury, to which his remains were translated in the 1090s.\nArrival in Britain.\nJustus was a member of the Gregorian mission sent to England by Pope Gregory\u00a0I. Almost everything known about Justus and his career is derived from the early 8th-century \"Historia ecclesiastica gentis Anglorum\" of Bede. As Bede does not describe Justus's origins, nothing is known about him before he arrived in England. He probably arrived in England with the second group of missionaries, sent at the request of Augustine of Canterbury in 601. Some modern writers describe Justus as one of the original missionaries who arrived with Augustine in 597, but Bede believed that Justus came in the second group. The second group included Mellitus, who later became Bishop of London and Archbishop of Canterbury.\nIf Justus was a member of the second group of missionaries, then he arrived with a gift of books and \"all things which were needed for worship and the ministry of the Church\". A 15th-century Canterbury chronicler, Thomas of Elmham, claimed that there were some books brought to England by that second group still at Canterbury in his day, although he did not identify them. An investigation of extant Canterbury manuscripts shows that one possible survivor is the St\u00a0Augustine Gospels, now in Corpus Christi College, Cambridge Manuscript (MS) 286.\nBishop of Rochester.\nAugustine consecrated Justus as a bishop in 604 over a province including the Kentish town of Rochester. The historian Nicholas Brooks argues that the choice of Rochester was probably not because it had been a Roman-era bishopric, but rather because of its importance in the politics of the time. Although the town was small, with just one street, it was at the junction of Watling Street and the estuary of the Medway and was thus a fortified town. Because Justus was probably not a monk (Bede did not call him that), his cathedral clergy was very likely non-monastic too.\nA charter purporting to be from King \u00c6thelberht, dated 28 April 604, survives in the \"Textus Roffensis\", as well as a copy based on the Textus in the 14th-century \"Liber Temporalium\". Written mostly in Latin but using an Old English boundary clause, the charter records a land grant near Rochester to Justus's church. Among the witnesses is Laurence, Augustine's future successor, but not Augustine himself. The text turns to two different addressees. First, \u00c6thelberht is made to admonish his son Eadbald, who had been established as a sub-ruler in the region of Rochester. The grant itself is addressed directly to Saint Andrew, the patron saint of the church, a usage parallelled by other charters in the same archive.\nWilhelm Levison, writing in 1946, was sceptical about the authenticity of this charter. He felt that the two separate addresses were incongruous, suggesting that the first address, occurring before the preamble, may have been inserted by someone familiar with Bede to echo Eadbald's future conversion (see below). A more recent and more positive appraisal by John Morris argues that the charter and its witness list are authentic because they incorporate titles and phraseology that had fallen out of use by 800.\n\u00c6thelberht built Justus a cathedral church in Rochester; the foundations of a nave and chancel partly underneath the present-day Rochester Cathedral may date from that time. What remains of the foundations of an early rectangular building near the southern part of the current cathedral might also be contemporary with Justus or may be part of a Roman building.\nTogether with Mellitus, the bishop of London, Justus signed a letter written by Archbishop Laurence of Canterbury to the Irish bishops urging the native Celtic church to adopt the Roman method of calculating the date of Easter (the \"computus\"). This letter also mentioned the fact that Irish missionaries, such as Dagan, had refused to share meals with the missionaries. Although the letter has not survived, Bede quoted from parts of it.\nIn 614, Justus attended the Council of Paris, held by the Frankish king, Chlothar\u00a0II. It is unclear why Justus and Peter, the abbot of Sts\u00a0Peter and Paul in Canterbury, were present. It may have been just chance, but the historian James Campbell has suggested that Chlothar summoned clergy from Britain to attend in an attempt to assert overlordship over Kent. N. J. Higham offers another explanation for their attendance, arguing that \u00c6thelberht sent the pair to the council because of shifts in Frankish policy towards the Kentish kingdom, which threatened Kentish independence, and that the two clergymen were sent to negotiate a compromise with Chlothar.\nA pagan backlash against Christianity followed \u00c6thelberht's death in 616, forcing Justus and Mellitus to flee to Gaul. The pair probably took refuge with Chlothar, hoping that the Frankish king would intervene and restore them to their sees, and by 617 Justus had been reinstalled in his bishopric by the new king. Mellitus also returned to England, but the prevailing pagan mood did not allow him to return to London; after Laurence's death, Mellitus became Archbishop of Canterbury. According to Bede, Justus received letters of encouragement from Pope Boniface\u00a0V (r. 619\u2013625), as did Mellitus, although Bede does not record the actual letters\u2014the historian J.\u00a0M. Wallace-Hadrill assumes both letters were general statements encouraging the missionaries.\nArchbishop.\nJustus became Archbishop of Canterbury in 624, receiving his pallium\u2014the symbol of the jurisdiction entrusted to archbishops\u2014from Pope Boniface\u00a0V, following which Justus consecrated Romanus as his successor at Rochester. Boniface also gave Justus a letter congratulating him on the conversion of King \"Aduluald\" (probably King Eadbald of Kent), a letter which is included in Bede's \"Historia ecclesiastica gentis Anglorum\". Bede's account of Eadbald's conversion states that it was Laurence, Justus's predecessor at Canterbury, who converted the king to Christianity, but D.\u00a0P. Kirby argues that the letter's reference to Eadbald makes it likely that it was Justus. Other historians, including Barbara Yorke and Henry Mayr-Harting, conclude that Bede's account is correct, and that Eadbald was converted by Laurence. Yorke argues that there were two kings of Kent during Eadbald's reign, Eadbald and \u00c6thelwald, and that \u00c6thelwald was the \"Aduluald\" referred to by Boniface. Yorke argues that Justus converted \u00c6thelwald back to Christianity after \u00c6thelberht's death.\nJustus consecrated Paulinus as the first bishop of York, before the latter accompanied \u00c6thelburg of Kent to Northumbria for her marriage to King Edwin of Northumbria. Bede records Justus as having died on 10\u00a0November, but does not give a year, although it is likely to have between 627 and 631. After his death, Justus was regarded as a saint, and was given a feast day on 10\u00a0November. The 9th-century Stowe Missal commemorates his feast day, along with Mellitus and Laurence. In the 1090s, his remains were translated, or ritually moved, to a shrine beside the high altar of St\u00a0Augustine's Abbey in Canterbury. At about the same time, a \"Life\" was written about him by Goscelin, as well as a poem by Reginald of Canterbury. Other material from Thomas of Elmham, Gervase of Canterbury, and William of Malmesbury, later medieval chroniclers, adds little to Bede's account of Justus's life.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "16426", "revid": "1288420132", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=16426", "title": "John Eccles (neurophysiologist)", "text": "Australian neurophysiologist (1903\u20131997)\nSir John Carew Eccles (27 January 1903 \u2013 2 May 1997) was an Australian neurophysiologist and philosopher who won the 1963 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for his work on the synapse. He shared the prize with Andrew Huxley and Alan Lloyd Hodgkin.\nLife and work.\nEarly life.\nEccles was born in Melbourne, Australia. He grew up there with his two sisters and his parents: William and Mary Carew Eccles (both teachers, who home schooled him until he was 12). He initially attended Warrnambool High School (now Warrnambool College) (where a science wing is named in his honour), then completed his final year of schooling at Melbourne High School. Aged 17, he was awarded a senior scholarship to study medicine at the University of Melbourne. As a medical undergraduate, he was never able to find a satisfactory explanation for the interaction of mind and body; he started to think about becoming a neuroscientist. He graduated (with first class honours) in 1925, and was awarded a Rhodes Scholarship to study under Charles Scott Sherrington at Magdalen College, Oxford University, where he received his Doctor of Philosophy in 1929.\nIn 1937 Eccles returned to Australia, where he worked on military research during World War II. During this time, Eccles was the director of the Kanematsu Institute at Sydney Medical School, where he and Bernard Katz gave research lectures at the University of Sydney, strongly influencing the intellectual environment of the university. After the war, he became a professor at the University of Otago in New Zealand. From 1952 to 1962, he worked as a professor at the John Curtin School of Medical Research (JCSMR) of the Australian National University. From 1966 to 1968, Eccles worked at the Feinberg School of Medicine at Northwestern University in Chicago.\nCareer.\nIn the early 1950s, Eccles and his colleagues performed the research that would lead to his receiving the Nobel Prize. To study synapses in the peripheral nervous system, Eccles and colleagues used the stretch reflex as a model, which is easily studied because it consists of only two neurones: a sensory neurone (the muscle spindle fibre) and the motor neurone. The sensory neurone synapses onto the motor neurone in the spinal cord. When a current is passed into the sensory neurone in the quadriceps, the motor neurone innervating the quadriceps produced a small excitatory postsynaptic potential (EPSP). When a similar current is passed through the hamstring, the opposing muscle to the quadriceps, an inhibitory postsynaptic potential (IPSP) is produced in the quadriceps motor neurone. Although a single EPSP was not enough to fire an action potential in the motor neurone, the sum of several EPSPs from multiple sensory neurones synapsing onto the motor neurone can cause the motor neurone to fire, thus contracting the quadriceps. On the other hand, IPSPs could subtract from this sum of EPSPs, preventing the motor neurone from firing.\nApart from these seminal experiments, Eccles was key to a number of important developments in neuroscience. Until around 1949, Eccles believed that synaptic transmission was primarily electrical rather than chemical. Although he was wrong in this hypothesis, his arguments led him and others to perform some of the experiments which proved chemical synaptic transmission. Bernard Katz and Eccles worked together on some of the experiments which elucidated the role of acetylcholine as a neurotransmitter in the brain.\nHonours.\nHe was appointed a Knight Bachelor in 1958 in recognition of services to physiological research.\nHe won the Australian of the Year Award in 1963, the same year he won the Nobel Prize.\nIn 1964, he became an honorary member to the American Philosophical Society, and in 1966 he moved to the United States to work as a professor at the Institute for Biomedical Research at the Feinberg School of Medicine in Chicago. Unhappy with the working conditions there, he left to become a professor at The State University of New York at Buffalo from 1968 until he retired in 1975. After retirement, he moved to Switzerland and wrote on the mind\u2013body problem.\nIn 1981, Eccles became a founding member of the World Cultural Council.\nIn 1990 he was appointed a Companion of the Order of Australia (AC) in recognition of service to science, particularly in the field of neurophysiology. He died at the age of 94 in 1997 in Tenero-Contra, Locarno, Switzerland.\nIn March 2012, the Eccles Institute of Neuroscience was constructed in a new wing of the John Curtin School of Medical Research, with the assistance of a $63M grant from the Commonwealth Government. In 2021, a new $60M animal research building was opened at the University of Otago, Dunedin, New Zealand, and named the Eccles Building.\nPhilosophy.\nIn \"The Understanding of the Brain\" (1973), Eccles summarises his philosophy: \"Now before discussing brain function in detail I will at the beginning give an account of my philosophical position on the so-called 'brain-mind problem' so that you will be able to relate the experimental evidence to this philosophical position. I have written at length on this philosophy in my book \"Facing Reality\". In Fig. 6-1 you will be able to see that I fully accept the recent philosophical achievements of Sir Karl Popper with his concept of three worlds. I was a dualist, now I am a trialist! Cartesian dualism has become unfashionable with many people. They embrace monism to escape the enigma of brain-mind interaction with its perplexing problems. But Sir Karl Popper and I are interactionists, and what is more, \"trialist interactionists\"! The three worlds are very easily defined. I believe that in the classification of Fig. 6-1 there is nothing left out. It takes care of everything that is in existence and in our experience. All can be classified in one or other of the categories enumerated under Worlds 1, 2 and 3.\nFig. 6-1, Three Worlds\n\"In Fig. 6-1, World 1 is the world of physical objects and states. It comprises the whole cosmos of matter and energy, all of biology including human brains, and all artifacts that man has made for coding information, as for example, the paper and ink of books or the material base of works of art. World 1 is the total world of the materialists. They recognise nothing else. All else is fantasy.\n\"World 2 is the world of states of consciousness and subjective knowledge of all kinds. The totality of our perceptions comes in this world. But there are several levels. In agreement with Polten, I tend to recognise three kinds of levels of World 2, as indicated in Fig. 6-2, but it may be more correct to think of it as a spectrum.\nFIG. 6-2, World of Consciousness\n\"The first level (outer sense) would be the ordinary perceptions provided by all our sense organs, hearing and touch and sight and smell and pain. All of these perceptions are in World 2, of course: vision with light and colour; sound with music and harmony; touch with all its qualities and vibration; the range of odours and tastes, and so on. These qualities do not exist in World 1, where correspondingly there are but electromagnetic waves, pressure waves in the atmosphere, material objects, and chemical substances.\n\"In addition there is a level of \"inner sense\", which is the world of more subtle perceptions. It is the world of your emotions, of your feelings of joy and sadness and fear and anger and so on. It includes all your memory, and all your imaginings and planning into the future. In fact there is a whole range of levels which could be described at length. All the subtle experiences of the human person are in this inner sensory world. It is all private to you but you can reveal it in linguistic expression, and by gestures of all levels of subtlety.\n\"Finally, at the core of World 2 there is the \"self\" or \"pure ego\", which is the basis of our unity as an experiencing being throughout our whole lifetime.\n\"This World 2 is our \"primary reality\". Our conscious experiences are the basis of our knowledge of World 1, which is thus a world of \"secondary reality\", a derivative world. Whenever I am doing a scientific experiment, for example, I have to plan it cognitively, all in my thoughts, and then consciously carry out my plan of action in the experiment. Finally I have to look at the results and evaluate them in thought. For example, I have to see the traces of the oscilloscope and their photographic records or hear the signals on the loudspeaker. The various signals from the recording equipment have to be received by my sense organs, transmitted to my brain, and so to my consciousness, then appropriately measured and compared before I can begin to think about the significance of the experimental results. We are all the time, in every action we do, incessantly playing backwards and forwards between World 1 and World 2.\n\"And what is World 3? As shown in Fig. 6-1 it is the whole world of culture. It is the world that was created by man and that reciprocally made man. This is my message in which I follow Popper unreservedly. The whole of language is here. All our means of communication, all our intellectual efforts coded in books, coded in the artistic and technological treasures in the museums, coded in every artefact left by man from primitive times\u2014this is World 3 right up to the present time. It is the world of civilisation and culture. Education is the means whereby each human being is brought into relation with World 3. In this manner he becomes immersed in it throughout life, participating in the heritage of mankind and so becoming fully human. World 3 is the world that uniquely relates to man. It is the world which is completely unknown to animals. They are blind to all of World 3. I say that without any reservations. This is then the first part of my story.\n\"Now I come to consider the way in which the three worlds interact...\"\nDespite these words, in his late book \"How the Self Controls Its Brain\", Eccles proposed a dualistic mechanism of mind.\nPersonal life and death.\nEccles had nine children. Eccles married Irene Miller Eccles (1904-2002) in 1928 and divorced in 1968. After his divorce in 1968, Eccles married Helena T\u00e1bor\u00edkov\u00e1 (1925-2017); a fellow neuropsychologist and M.D. of Charles University. The two often collaborated in research and they remained married until his death. Eccles died on 2 May 1997 in his home of Contra, Switzerland. He was buried in Contra, Switzerland.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

In the summer of 1785 he was sent to England to complete his education at Hawkshead Grammar School and afterwards at Trinity College, Cambridge, taking his Bachelor of Arts degree in 1789. Having entered the Inner Temple he took the advice of Samuel Romilly, studied law on his own for a year, and then was taught by George Wood. He was called to the bar in 1791, and joined the northern circuit and the Lancashire sessions.\nLegal and political career.\nThough Scarlett had no professional connections, he gradually obtained a large practice, ultimately confining himself to the Court of King's Bench and the northern circuit. He took silk in 1816, and from this time till the close of 1834 he was the most successful lawyer at the bar; he was particularly effective before a jury, and his income reached \u00a318,500, a large sum for that period. He first entered parliament in 1819 as Whig member for Peterborough, representing that constituency with a short break (1822\u20131823) till 1830, when he was elected for the borough of Malton. He became Attorney General, and was made a Knight Bachelor when Canning formed his ministry in 1827; and though he resigned when the Duke of Wellington came into power in 1828, he resumed office in 1829 and went out with the Duke in 1830.\nHis opposition to the Reform Bill caused him to leave the Whigs and join the Tories, and he was elected, first for Cockermouth in 1831 and then in 1832 for Norwich, for which he sat until the dissolution of parliament in 1835. He was appointed Lord Chief Baron of the Exchequer in 1834, and presided in that court for more than nine years. He was appointed to the Privy Council at the end of that year. He was raised to the peerage as Baron Abinger, \"of Abinger in the County of Surrey and of the City of Norwich\" in 1835, taking his title from the Surrey estate he had bought in 1813. The qualities which brought him success at the bar were not equalled on the bench; he had a reputation for unfairness, and complaints were made about his domineering attitude towards juries.\nWhile he was studying in England, he became the guardian of Edward Moulton, who later assumed his mother's family name, and became the father of the poet Elizabeth Barrett, later Elizabeth Barrett Browning. The Scarletts and the Barretts had been friends for many years in Jamaica, and it seems natural that James Scarlett would have been selected to keep an eye on young Moulton, while the boy was at school in England. In a note prefixed to the \"Collected Edition\" of his wife's poems, Robert Browning tells us that \"On the early death of his father, he (Edward Moulton) was brought from Jamaica to England when a very young child, as ward to the late Chief Baron Lord Abinger, then Mr. Scarlett, whom he frequently accompanied in his post-chaise when on pursuit.\"\nFamily.\nLord Abinger was twice married (the second time only six months before his death), and by his first wife (d. 1829) had three sons and two daughters, the title passing to his eldest son, Robert. His second son was General Sir James Yorke Scarlett, leader of the heavy cavalry charge at Balaklava. His third son, Peter Campbell Scarlett, was a diplomat. His elder daughter, Mary, married John Campbell, 1st Baron Campbell, and was herself created Baroness Stratheden. Sir William Anglin Scarlett, Lord Abinger's younger brother, was chief justice of Jamaica. While attending the Norfolk circuit on 2 April, Lord Abinger was suddenly seized with apoplexy, and died in his lodgings at Bury St Edmunds.\nA more distant relation was the painter John Scarlett Davis.\nProperty.\nIn 1836, Scarlett was awarded compensation of \u00a3626 2s 2d for 30 slaves on the Spring Grove estate in Manchester, Jamaica.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Intermarriage is often discouraged, though opinions vary.\nIn Judaism, a marriage can end either because of a divorce document given by the man to his wife, or by the death of either party. Certain details, primarily as protections for the wife, were added in Talmudic times.\nOverview.\nHistoric view.\nIn traditional Judaism, marriage is viewed as a contractual bond commanded by God in which a Jewish man and a Jewish woman come together to create a relationship in which God is directly involved. Though procreation is not the sole purpose, a Jewish marriage is traditionally expected to fulfil the commandment to have children. In this view, marriage is understood to mean that the husband and wife are merging into a single soul, which is why a man is considered \"incomplete\" if he is not married, as his soul is only one part of a larger whole that remains to be unified.\nRecent non-Orthodox views.\nNon-Orthodox Jewish denominations, such as Reconstructionist, Reform, and Conservative Judaism, recognize same-sex marriage, and de-emphasize procreation, focusing on marriage as a bond between a couple.\nBetrothal and marriage.\nIn Jewish law, marriage consists of two separate acts, called or , which is the betrothal ceremony, and or , the actual Jewish wedding ceremony. changes the couple's personal circumstances, while brings about the legal consequences of the change of circumstances. In Talmudic times, these two ceremonies usually took place up to a year apart; the bride lived with her parents until the actual marriage ceremony (), which would take place in a room or tent that the groom had set up for her. Since the Middle Ages the two ceremonies have taken place as a combined ceremony performed in public.\nIn Ancient Judaism a marriage could be established in three ways: money, contract, or sexual intercourse.\nAccording to the Talmud, involves the groom handing an object to the bride \u2013 either an object of value such as a ring, or a document stating that she is being betrothed to him. In order to be valid, this must be done in the presence of two unrelated male witnesses. After , the laws of adultery apply, and the marriage cannot be dissolved without a religious divorce. After , the couple may live together.\nThe act of may be made by the intending parties or by their respective parents or other relatives on their behalf with their consent. A man and a woman cannot be betrothed to one another without agency and consent. The act is formalized in a document known as the , the \"Document of Conditions\" which is read prior to the . After the reading, the mothers of the future bride and groom break a plate. Today, some sign the contract on the day of the wedding, some do it as an earlier ceremony, and some do not do it at all. It should also be emphasized that this practice is not explicitly mentioned in the Hebrew Bible.\nIn Haredi communities, marriages may be arranged by the parents of the prospective bride and groom, who may arrange a by engaging a professional match-maker () who finds and introduces the prospective bride and groom and receives a fee for their services. The young couple is not forced to marry if either does not accept the other.\nMatrimony.\nMarital harmony.\nMarital harmony, known as (), is valued in Jewish tradition. The Talmud states that a man should love his wife as much as he loves himself, and honour her more than he honours himself; indeed, one who honours his wife was said, by the classical rabbis, to be rewarded with wealth. Similarly, a husband was expected to discuss with his wife any worldly matters that might arise in his life. The Talmud forbids a husband from being overbearing to his household, and domestic abuse by him was also condemned. It was said of a wife that \"God counts her tears\".\nAs for the wife, the greatest praise the Talmudic rabbis offered to any woman was that given to a wife who fulfils the wishes of her husband; to this end, an early midrash states that a wife should not leave the home \"too frequently\". A wife, also, was expected to be modest, even when alone with her husband. God's presence dwells in a pure and loving home.\nConjugal rights and obligations.\nMarriage obligations and rights in Judaism are ultimately based on those apparent in the Bible, which have been clarified, defined, and expanded on by many prominent rabbinic authorities throughout history.\nTraditionally, the obligations of the husband include providing for his wife. He is obligated to provide for her sustenance for her benefit; in exchange, he is also entitled to her income. However, this is a right to the wife, and she can release her husband of the obligation of sustaining her, and she can then keep her income exclusively for herself. The document that provides for this is the .\nThe Bible itself gives the wife protections, as per Exodus 21:10, although the rabbis may have added others later. The rights of the husband and wife are described in tractate in the Talmud, which explains how the rabbis balanced the two sets of rights of the wife and the husband.\nAccording to the non-traditional view, in the Bible the wife is treated as a possession owned by her husband, but later Judaism imposed several obligations on the husband, effectively giving the wife several rights and freedoms; indeed, being a Jewish wife was often a more favourable situation than being a wife in many other cultures. For example, the Talmud establishes the principle that a wife is entitled, but not compelled, to the same dignity and social standing as her husband, and is entitled to keep any additional advantages she had as a result of her social status before her marriage.\nIn the Bible.\nBiblical Hebrew has two words for \"husband\": (also meaning \"master\"), and (also meaning \"man\", parallel to meaning \"woman\" or \"wife\"). The words are contrasted in Hosea 2:16, where God speaks to Israel as though it is his wife: \"On that day, says the Lord, you will call [me] 'my husband' (), and will no longer call me 'my master' ().\"\nEarly nomadic communities practised a form of marriage known as , in which a wife would own a tent of her own, within which she retains complete independence from her husband; this principle appears to survive in parts of early Israelite society, as some early passages of the Bible appear to portray certain wives as each owning a tent as a personal possession (specifically, Jael, Sarah, and Jacob's wives). In later times, the Bible describes wives as being given the innermost room(s) of the husband's house, as her own private area to which men were not permitted; in the case of wealthy husbands, the Bible describes their wives as having each been given an entire house for this purpose.\nIt was not, however, a life of complete freedom. The descriptions of the Bible suggest that a wife was expected to perform certain household tasks: spinning, sewing, weaving, manufacture of clothing, fetching of water, baking of bread, and animal husbandry. The Book of Proverbs contains an entire acrostic about the duties which would be performed by a virtuous wife.\nThe husband, too, is indirectly implied to have responsibilities to his wife. The Torah obligates a man to not deprive his wife of food, clothing, or of sexual activity (); if the husband does not provide the first wife with these things, she is to be divorced, without cost to her. The Talmud interprets this as a requirement for a man to provide food and clothing to, and have sex with, each of his wives, even if he only has one.\nAs a polygynous society, the Israelites did not have any laws which imposed monogamy on men. Adulterous married and betrothed women, as well as their male accomplices, were subject to the death penalty by the biblical laws against adultery. According to the Book of Numbers, if a woman was suspected of adultery, she was to be subjected to the ordeal of the bitter water, a form of trial by ordeal, but one that took a miracle to convict. The literary prophets indicate that adultery was a frequent occurrence, despite their strong protests against it, and these legal strictnesses.\nIn the Talmud and Rabbinic Judaism.\nThe Talmud sets a minimum provision which a husband must provide to his wife:\nRabbinic courts could compel the husband to make this provision, if he fails to do so voluntarily. The Chatam Sofer, a prominent 19th century halachic decisor, argued that if a man could not provide his wife with this minimum, he should be compelled to divorce her; other Jewish rabbis argued that a man should be compelled to hire himself out, as a day-labourer, if he cannot otherwise make this provision to his wife.\nAccording to prominent Jewish writers of the Middle Ages, if a man is absent from his wife for a long period, the wife should be allowed to sell her husband's property, if necessary to sustain herself. Similarly, they argued that if a wife had to take out a loan to pay for her sustenance during such absence, her husband had to pay the debt on his return.\nIn order to offset the husband's duty to support his wife, she was required by the Talmud to surrender all her earnings to her husband, together with any profit she makes by accident, and the right of usufruct on her property; the wife was not required to do this if she wished to support herself. Although the wife always retained ownership of her property itself, if she died while still married to her husband, he was to be her heir, according to the opinion of the Talmud; this principle, though, was modified, in various ways, by the rabbis of the Middle Ages.\nHome and household.\nIn Jewish tradition, the husband was expected to provide a home for his wife, furnished in accordance to local custom and appropriate to his status; the marital couple were expected to live together in this home, although if the husband's choice of work made it difficult to do so, the Talmud excuses him from the obligation. Traditionally, if the husband changed his usual abode, the wife was considered to have a duty to move with him. In the Middle Ages, it was argued that if a person continued to refuse to live with their spouse, the spouse in question had sufficient grounds for divorce.\nMost Jewish religious authorities held that a husband must allow his wife to eat at the same table as him, even if he gave his wife enough money to provide for herself. By contrast, if a husband mistreated his wife, or lived in a disreputable neighbourhood, the Jewish religious authorities would permit the wife to move to another home elsewhere, and would compel the husband to finance her life there.\nExpanding on the household tasks which the Bible implies a wife should undertake, rabbinic literature requires her to perform all the housework (such as baking, cooking, washing, caring for her children, etc.), unless her marriage had given the husband a large dowry; in the latter situation, the wife was expected only to tend to \"affectionate\" tasks, such as making his bed and serving him his food. Jewish tradition expected the husband to provide the bed linen and kitchen utensils. If the wife had young twin children, the Talmud made her husband responsible for caring for one of them.\nClothing.\nThe Talmud elaborates on the biblical requirement of the husband to provide his wife with clothing, by insisting that each year he must provide each wife with 50 zuzim's-worth of clothing, including garments appropriate to each season of the year. The Talmudic rabbis insist that this annual clothing gift should include one hat, one belt, and three pairs of shoes (one pair for each of the three main annual festivals: Passover, Shabu'ot, and Sukkoth). The husband was also expected by the classical rabbis to provide his wife with jewelry and perfumes if he lived in an area where this was customary.\nPhysical obligations.\nThe Talmud argues that a husband is responsible for the protection of his wife's body. If his wife became ill, then he would be compelled, by the Talmud, to defray any medical expense which might be incurred in relation to this; the Talmud requires him to ensure that the wife receives care. Although he technically had the right to divorce his wife, enabling him to avoid paying for her medical costs, several prominent rabbis throughout history condemned such a course of action as inhuman behaviour, even if the wife was suffering from a prolonged illness.\nIf the wife dies, even if not due to illness, the Talmud's stipulations require the husband to arrange, and pay for, her burial; the burial must, in the opinion of the Talmud, be one conducted in a manner befitting the husband's social status, and in accordance with the local custom. Prominent rabbis of the Middle Ages clarified this, stating that the husband must make any provisions required by local burial customs, potentially including the hiring of mourners and the erection of a tombstone. According to the Talmud, and later rabbinic writers, if the husband was absent, or refused to do these things, a rabbinical court should arrange the wife's funeral, selling some of the husband's property in order to defray the costs.\nIf the wife was captured, the husband was required by the Talmud and later writers to pay the ransom demanded for her release; there is some debate whether the husband was required only to pay up to the wife's market value as a slave, or whether he must pay any ransom, even to the point of having to sell his possessions to raise the funds. If the husband and wife were both taken captive, the historic Jewish view was that the rabbinic courts should first pay the ransom for the wife, selling some of the husband's property in order to raise the funds.\nFidelity.\nIn the classical era of the rabbinic scholars, the death penalty for adultery was rarely applied. It forbids conviction if:\nThese rules made it practically impossible to convict any woman of adultery; in nearly every case, women were acquitted. However, due to the belief that a priest should be untainted, a Kohen was compelled to divorce his wife if she had been raped.\nIn Talmudic times, once the death penalty was no longer enforced for any crime, even when a woman was convicted, the punishment was comparatively mild: adulteresses were flogged instead. Nevertheless, the husbands of convicted adulteresses were not permitted by the Talmud to forgive their guilty wives, instead being compelled to divorce them; according to Maimonides, a conviction for adultery nullified any right that the wife's marriage contract (Hebrew: ) gave her to a compensation payment for being divorced. Once divorced, an adulteress was not permitted, according to the Talmudic writers, to marry her paramour.\nAs for men who committed adultery (with another man's wife), Abba ben Joseph and Abba Arika are both quoted in the Talmud as expressing abhorrence, and arguing that such men would be condemned to Gehenna.\nFamily purity.\nThe laws of \"family purity\" () are considered an important part of an Orthodox Jewish marriage, and adherence to them is (in Orthodox Judaism) regarded as a prerequisite of marriage. This involves observance of the various details of the menstrual laws. Orthodox brides and grooms attend classes on this subject prior to the wedding. The niddah laws are regarded as an intrinsic part of marital life (rather than just associated with women). Together with a few other rules, including those about the ejaculation of semen, these are collectively termed \"family purity\".\nSexual relations.\nIn marriage, conjugal relations are guaranteed as a fundamental right for a woman, along with food and clothing. This obligation is known as . Sex within marriage is the woman's right, and the man's duty. The husband is forbidden from raping his wife, they are not to be intimate while drunk or while either party is angry at the other. A woman should be granted a (divorce) if she seeks it because her husband is disgusting or loathsome to her. If either partner consistently refuses to participate, that person is considered rebellious, and the other spouse can sue for divorce. A very large number of Jewish texts attempting to regulate marital sexuality exist. This category can vary: it can mean a few biblical verse, chapters in medieval books of law, or self-standing modern traditional Jewish guides to marital sexuality. One should always remember that the fact a certain activity is recommended or forbidden, does not mean that in reality the advice is followed. We can know what generally traditional Jews were told to do or not to do in their bedrooms. We can very rarely know what actually happened.\nAge of marriage.\nCiting the primacy of the divine command given in Genesis 1:28, the time between puberty and age twenty has been considered the ideal time for men and women to be wed in traditional Jewish thought. Some rabbis have gone further to commend the age of eighteen as most ideal, while others have advocated for the time immediately following puberty, closer to the age of fourteen, essentially \"as early in life as possible.\" Babylonian rabbis understood marriage as God's means of keeping male sexuality from going out of control, so they advocated for early marriage to prevent men from succumbing to temptation in their youth. The \u1e33e\u1e6dannah (children aged three to twelve) might be given in marriage by her father, and the marriage was valid, necessitating a formal divorce if separation was desired. Some commended early marriage for its benefits: Rabbi \u1e24isda maintained that early marriage could lead to increased intelligence.\nA large age gap between spouses, in either direction, is advised against as unwise. A younger woman marrying a significantly older man however is especially problematic: marrying one's young daughter to an old man was declared as reprehensible as forcing her into prostitution. Moreover, it is problematic for an older man to be unmarried in the first place. Marriage is held to be uniquely mandatory for men, and an unmarried man over the age of twenty is considered \"cursed by God Himself.\"\nThere is evidence however that in some communities males did not marry until \"thirty or older.\" In medieval Jewish Ashkenazi communities, women continued to be married young. Since the Enlightenment, young marriage has become rarer among Jewish communities.\nConsent.\nAccording to the Talmud, a father is commanded not to marry his daughter to anyone until she grows up and says, \"I want this one\". A marriage that takes place without the consent of the girl is not an effective legal marriage.\nA (literally meaning \"little [one]\") was any girl between the age of 3 years and that of 12 years plus one day; she was subject to her father's authority, and he could arrange a marriage for her without her agreement. However, after reaching the age of maturity, she would have to agree to the marriage to be considered as married. If the father was dead or missing, the brothers of the , collectively, had the right to arrange a marriage for her, as had her mother. In these situations, a would always have the right to annul her marriage, even if it was the first.\nIf the marriage did end (due to divorce or the husband's death), any further marriages were optional; the retained her right to annul them. The choice of a to annul a marriage, known in Hebrew as (literally meaning \"refusal\", \"denial\", \"protest\"), led to a true annulment, not a divorce; a divorce document () was not necessary, and a who did this was not regarded by legal regulations as a divorcee, in relation to the marriage. Unlike divorce, was regarded with distaste by many rabbinic writers, even in the Talmud; in earlier classical Judaism, one major faction \u2013 the House of Shammai \u2013 argued that such annulment rights only existed during the betrothal (not engagement) period () and not once the actual marriage () had begun.\nIntermarriage.\nRates of marriage between Jews and non-Jews have increased in countries other than Israel (the Jewish diaspora). According to the National Jewish Population Survey 2000-01, 47% of marriages involving Jews in the United States between 1996 and 2001 were with non-Jewish partners. Jewish leaders in different branches generally agree that possible assimilation is a crisis, but they differ on the proper response to intermarriage.\nAttitudes.\nThere are also differences between streams on what constitutes an intermarriage, arising from their differing criteria for being Jewish in the first place. Orthodox Jews only consider a child to be Jewish if the mother is of Jewish ancestry or has undergone a proper conversion as conducted by proper rabbinical authorities.\nAmong the general Jewish population in Israel, interfaith marriages are extremely rare; only about two percent were in an interfaith marriage. In addition, about 97 percent of Jews in the same Pew Research Center study, conducted in 2014-2015, did not approve of their child marrying a Muslim while 89 percent expressed similar views when asked about a hypothetical marriage to a Christian.\nInterracial Marriage.\nJewish prohibitions on marriage typically concern interfaith marriages. There is no historical prohibition of interracial marriage, nor is there explicit permission of such. However, debates around Numbers 12:1 suggest that Zipporah, the wife of Moses, is described as a \"Cushite woman\" to highlight a potentially much darker skin tone. Under modern social constructs, this would constitute Moses's marriage as an interracial one. However, there is no concrete proof that the Cushite woman referred to in Numbers is the same Zipporah from Exodus.\nMarriage in Israel.\nIn Israel, the only institutionalized form of Jewish marriage is the religious one, i.e., a marriage conducted under the auspices of the rabbinate. Specifically, marriage of Israeli Jews must be conducted according to Jewish Law (), as viewed by Orthodox Judaism. One consequence is that Jews in Israel who cannot marry according to Jewish law (e.g., a and a divorc\u00e9e, or a Jew and one who is not halachically Jewish), cannot marry each other. This has led for calls, mostly from the secular segment of the Israeli public, for the institution of civil marriage.\nSome secular-Jewish Israelis travel abroad to have civil marriages, either because they do not wish an Orthodox wedding or because their union cannot be sanctioned by . These marriages are legally recognized by the State, but are not recognized by the State Rabbinate.\nMarriages performed in Israel must be carried out by religious authorities of an official religion (Judaism, Islam, Christianity, or Druze), unless both parties are without religion.\nDivorce.\n (Jewish Law) allows for divorce. The document of divorce is termed a . The final divorce ceremony involves the husband giving the document into the hand of the wife or her agent, but the wife may sue in rabbinical court to initiate the divorce. In such a case, a husband may be compelled to give the , if he has violated any of his numerous obligations outlined in Jewish law and the couple's specific \"ketubah\"; Historically, this was sometimes accomplished by beating and or monetary coercion. The rationale was that since he was required to divorce his wife due to his (or her) violations of the contract, his good inclination desires to divorce her, and the community helps him to do what he wants to do anyway. In this case, the wife may or may not be entitled to a payment.\nSince around the 12th century, some officials within Judaism have recognized the right of a wife abused physically or psychologically to a forced divorce.\nConservative Judaism follows halacha, although differently than Orthodox Judaism. Reform Jews usually use an egalitarian form of the at their weddings. They generally do not issue Jewish divorces, seeing a civil divorce as both necessary and sufficient; however, some Reform rabbis encourage the couple to go through a Jewish divorce procedure. Orthodox Judaism does not recognize civil law as overriding religious law, and thus does not view a civil divorce as sufficient. Therefore, a man or woman may be considered divorced by the Reform Jewish community, but still married by the Conservative community. Orthodox Judaism usually does not recognize Reform weddings because according to Talmudic law, the witnesses to the marriage must be Jews who observe , which is believed by Orthodox authorities to seldom be the case in Reform weddings.\nTraditionally, when a husband fled, or his whereabouts were unknown for any reason, the woman was considered an (literally \"an anchored woman\"), and was not allowed to remarry; in traditional Judaism, divorce can only be initiated by the husband. Prior to modern communication, the death of the husband while in a distant land was a common cause of this situation. In modern times, when a husband refuses to issue a due to money, property, or custody battles, the woman who cannot remarry is considered a , not an agunah. A man in this situation would not be termed a (literally, \"a refuser of a divorce document\"), unless a legitimate Beis Din had required him to issue a Get. The term is often used in such circumstances, but it is not technically accurate.\nWithin both the Conservative and Orthodox communities, there are efforts to avoid situations where a woman is not able to obtain a Jewish divorce from her husband. The serves this function in Conservative Judaism in order to prevent husbands from refusing to give their wives a divorce. To do this, the has built in provisions; so, if predetermined circumstances occur, the divorce goes into effect immediately. After the fact, various Jewish and secular legal methods are used to deal with such problems. None of the legal solutions addresses the problem in the case of a missing husband.\nSame-sex marriage.\nIn Orthodox Judaism.\nOrthodox Judaism does not have a Jewish legal construct of same-gender marriage. While any two Jewish adults may be joined by a Jewish legal contract, the rites of are reserved for a union of a man and woman.\nIn Conservative Judaism.\nIn June 2012, the American branch of Conservative Judaism formally approved same-sex marriage ceremonies in a 13\u20130 vote with one abstention.\nIn Reform Judaism.\nIn 1996, the Central Conference of American Rabbis passed a resolution approving same-sex civil marriage. However, this same resolution made a distinction between civil marriages and religious marriages; this resolution thus stated:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;However we may understand homosexuality, whether as an illness, as a genetically based dysfunction or as a sexual preference and lifestyle \u2013 we cannot accommodate the relationship of two homosexuals as a \"marriage\" within the context of Judaism, for none of the elements of (sanctification) normally associated with marriage can be invoked for this relationship.\nThe Central Conference of American Rabbis support the right of gay and lesbian couples to share fully and equally in the rights of civil marriage, and\nThat the CCAR oppose governmental efforts to ban gay and lesbian marriage.\nThat this is a matter of civil law, and is separate from the question of rabbinic officiation at such marriages.\nIn 1998, an ad hoc CCAR committee on human sexuality issued its majority report (11 to 1, 1 abstention) which stated that the holiness within a Jewish marriage \"may be present in committed same gender relationships between two Jews and that these relationships can serve as the foundation of stable Jewish families, thus adding strength to the Jewish community.\" The report called for CCAR to support rabbis in officiating at same-sex marriages. Also in 1998, the Responsa Committee of the CCAR issued a lengthy (rabbinical opinion) that offered detailed argumentation in support of both sides of the question whether a rabbi may officiate at a commitment ceremony for a same-sex couple.\nIn March 2000, CCAR issued a new resolution stating that \"We do hereby resolve that the relationship of a Jewish, same gender couple is worthy of affirmation through appropriate Jewish ritual, and further resolve, that we recognize the diversity of opinions within our ranks on this issue. We support the decision of those who choose to officiate at rituals of union for same-sex couples, and we support the decision of those who do not.\"\nIn Reconstructionist Judaism.\nThe Reconstructionist Rabbinical Association (RRA) encourages its members to officiate at same-sex marriages, though it does not require it of them.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

His major genres were social science fiction and dystopia. His main recurring theme involved the gloomy prospects for a space environment into which mankind carried totalitarian ideas and habits: Red Space Republics, or Space Labor Camps, or both. His heroes desperately try to find meaning in the world around them.\nThe Polish science fiction fandom award was named after him: the Janusz A. Zajdel Award. He was a trustee of World SF.\nLife.\nJanusz Zajdel was born 15 August 1938 in Warsaw, Poland. He studied physics at the University of Warsaw. He was a member of the Union of Polish Youth and the Polish Students' Association. After graduating, he worked many years as a radiological engineer and an expert on nuclear physics at the Central Laboratory of Radiological Protection in Poland. He published a number of academic works, handbooks of safety regulations, as well as educational and popular science texts. In 1976 he joined the Polish Writers' Union.\nIn his spare time, he popularized science by writing science fiction. With his brother, he started a column in a Polish magazine for young people interested in science and engineering, \"M\u0142ody Technik\" (\"Young Technician\"), in which they proposed various futuristic gadgets. In 1961 \"M\u0142ody Technik\" published Zajdel's science-fiction debut, the short story \"Tau Ceti\" (). Other stories by him soon appeared in several other Polish magazines.\nHis first book was published in 1965, a short-story anthology, \"Jad mantezji\" (\"The Venom of Mantesia\"), which included stories from \"M\u0142ody Technik\" and some others that had already appeared a year earlier in another anthology. By 1982 he had published four more collections: \"Przej\u015bcie przez lustro\" (Through the Mirror, 1975); \"Iluzyt\" (1976); \"Feniks\" (The Phoenix, 1981); and \"Ogon diab\u0142a\" (The Devil's Tail, 1982).\nHis first novel, \"Lalande 21185\", appeared in 1966, a year after his first short-story anthology, and was geared toward young adults. His first serious science-fiction novel was a \"first contact\"-type SF mystery, \"Prawo do powrotu\" (Right of Return, 1975); but it was his novels of the late 1970s and early 1980s \u2013 \"Cylinder van Troffa\" (Van Troff's Cylinder, 1980); \"Limes inferior\" (The Lower Limit, 1982); \"Ca\u0142a prawda o planecie Ksi\" (The Whole Truth about Planet Xi, 1983); \"Wyj\u015bcie z cienia\" (Out of the Shadows, 1983); and \"Paradyzja\" (Paradise: World in Orbit, 1984) \u2013 that earned him a reputation as one of the most important Polish science-fiction writers.\nHe was an active member of Polish and international science fiction fandom, and a Trustee of World SF. In the 1980s he was an active supporter of the Polish Solidarity movement.\nOn 19 July 1985 he died of lung cancer, after three years' struggle against the disease.\nThemes.\nZajdel's early works, from the 1960s and early 1970s, focuses on scientific inventions and their role in space exploration, alien contact or artificial intelligence. As his writing career continued, however, his stories evolved to focus on the social aspects and often negative consequences of those inventions. Over time, a theme became increasingly visible in his works - a concern over dangers inherent in attempts to control the human society. He is also condemning human ignorance, warning against xenophobia, and asking philosophical questions about the nature of the universe, happiness and human destiny. Zajdel's works from his second period - late 1970s and 1980s - and represent the genres of social and dystopian fiction. In his works, he envisions totalitarian states and societies living under extreme forms of mass surveillance.\nHis works are also recognized as being a critique of the totalitarian, communist state, a reality of his life in People's Republic of Poland. Science fiction genre, with its outer-worldly, clearly fictional, and often allegorical setting and invented jargon was able to debate fundamentals of such systems with frankness that more mainstream literature would not be allowed to.\nImportance.\nZajdel has been described as the second science fiction writer in popularity in Poland after Stanis\u0142aw Lem. He has also been described as the writer who replaced Lem as the \"top Polish SF writer\", after \"Lem vacated [this position] earlier of his own volition\".\nHe is recognized as an originator of the social science fiction genre in Polish science fiction, known in Poland as the sociological speculative fiction (\"fantastyka socjologiczna\"). He has been an inspiration to a number of younger Polish science fiction authors such as Maciej Parowski and Marek Oramus.\nHis works have been translated into Belarusian, Bulgarian, Czech, Esperanto, Finnish, German, Hungarian, Russian and Slovenian. As of August 2015[ [update]], the only work translated into English is the short story \"Wyj\u0105tkowo trudny teren\" (\"Particularly Difficult Territory\") that Zajdel wrote for the English language \"Tales from the Planet Earth\" anthology edited by Frederik Pohl and Elizabeth Anne Hull.\nRecognition.\nIn 1973 Zajdel received an honorary award Magnum Trophaeum from the \"M\u0142ody Technik\" (\"Young Technician\") magazine for long-term cooperation. In 1980 Zajdel received the Polish Ministry of Culture and Arts Best SF Book of the Year Award for \"Van Troff's Cylinder\". Zajdel also received the Golden Sepulka Award two times: for \"Limes Inferior\" (1982 novel; 1983 award) and \"Wyj\u015bcie z cienia\" (\"Out of the Shadow\") (1983 novel; 1984 award). He was awarded the Medal of Merit for National Defence for his educational film scripts. Winner of \u015al\u0105kfa for 1984.\nIn 1984 Polish fantasy and science fiction fandom (associated with the Polish SF convention Polcon) decided to establish an annual award, initially named \"Sfinks\" (\"Sphynx\"). Janusz A. Zajdel became the first winner of this award, for his 1984 novel \"Paradyzja\". He won the award posthumously in 1985, shortly after his death, at which time it was decided to rename the award after him, and it became known as the Janusz A.

Rumi is by far the most influential figure of Sufi Islam, and his thought and works loom large both in Persian literature and mystic poetry in general. Today, his translated works are enjoyed all over the world.\nHis \"Masnavi\", often called a \"Qur'an in Persian\", is considered one of the greatest poems of the Persian language. Many Muslims, particularly in the Turko-Persian cultural sphere, regard the \"Masnavi\" as one of the most important works of Islamic literature, falling behind only the Quran.\nRumi's works are widely read today across his native Greater Iran as well as in Turkey, where the Sufi brotherhood he founded is based. His poems have been translated into many of the world's languages, and Rumi has been described as the \"world's most popular poet.\" \nIn the United States, he has become the best selling poet in recent years.\nName.\nHe is most commonly called \"Rumi\" in English. His full name is given by his contemporary Faridun bin Ahmad Sipahsalar as \"Muhammad bin Muhammad bin al-Husayn al-Khatibi al-Balkhi al-Bakri\" (). He is more commonly known as \"Mol\u0101n\u0101 Jal\u0101l ad-D\u012bn Mu\u1e25ammad R\u016bm\u012b\" (). \"Jalal ad-Din\" is an Arabic name meaning \"Glory of the Faith\". \"Balkh\u012b\" and \"R\u016bm\u012b\" are his \"nisbas\", meaning, respectively, \"from Balkh\" and \"from R\u00fbm\", as he was from the Sultanate of R\u00fbm in Anatolia.\nAccording to the authoritative Rumi biographer Franklin Lewis of the University of Chicago, \"[t]he Anatolian peninsula which had belonged to the Byzantine, or eastern Roman empire, had only relatively recently been conquered by Muslims and even when it came to be controlled by Turkish Muslim rulers, it was still known to Arabs, Persians and Turks as the geographical area of Rum. As such, there are a number of historical personages born in or associated with Anatolia known as Rumi, a word borrowed from Persian literally meaning 'Roman,' in which context Roman refers to subjects of the Byzantine Empire or simply to people living in or things associated with Anatolia.\" He was also known as \"Mullah of Rum\" ( \"mull\u0101-yi R\u016bm\" or \"mull\u0101-yi R\u016bm\u012b\").\nRumi is widely known by the sobriquet \"Mawl\u0101n\u0101\"/\"Mol\u0101n\u0101\" ( ) in Iran and popularly known as in Turkey. \"Mawl\u0101n\u0101\" () is a term of Arabic origin, meaning \"our master\". The term \"Mawlaw\u012b\"/\"Mowlavi\" (Persian) and (Turkish), also of Arabic origin, meaning \"my master\", is also frequently used for him.\nLife.\nOverview.\nRumi was born to Persian parents, in Wakhsh, a village on the East bank of the Wakhsh River known as Sangtuda in present-day Tajikistan. The area, culturally adjacent to Balkh, is where Mawl\u00e2n\u00e2's father, Bah\u00e2' udd\u00een Walad, was a preacher and jurist. He lived and worked there until 1212, when Rumi was aged around five and the family moved to Samarkand.\nGreater Balkh was at that time a major centre of Persian culture and Sufism had developed there for several centuries. The most important influences upon Rumi, besides his father, were the Persian poets Attar and Sanai. Rumi expresses his appreciation: \"Attar was the spirit, Sanai his eyes twain, And in time thereafter, Came we in their train\" and mentions in another poem: \"Attar has traversed the seven cities of Love, We are still at the turn of one street\". His father was also connected to the spiritual lineage of Najm al-Din Kubra.\nRumi lived most of his life under the Persianate Seljuk Sultanate of Rum, where he produced his works and died in 1273AD. He was buried in Konya, and his shrine became a place of pilgrimage. Upon his death, his followers and his son Sultan Walad founded the Mevlevi Order, also known as the Order of the Whirling Dervishes, famous for the Sufi dance known as the Sama ceremony. He was laid to rest beside his father, and over his remains a shrine was erected. A hagiographical account of him is described in Shams ud-Din Ahmad Afl\u0101ki's \"Man\u0101qib ul-\u0100rif\u012bn\" (written between 1318 and 1353). This biography needs to be treated with care as it contains both legends and facts about Rumi. For example, Professor Franklin Lewis of the University of Chicago, author of the most complete biography on Rumi, has separate sections for the hagiographical biography of Rumi and the actual biography about him.\nChildhood and emigration.\nRumi's father was Bah\u0101 ud-D\u012bn Walad, a theologian, jurist and a mystic from Wakhsh, who was also known by the followers of Rumi as Sultan al-Ulama or \"Sultan of the Scholars\". According to Sultan Walad's \"Ibadetname\" and Shamsuddin Aflaki (c.1286 to 1291), Rumi was a descendant of Abu Bakr. Some modern scholars, however, reject this claim and state it does not hold on closer examination. The claim of maternal descent from the Khwarazmshah for Rumi or his father is also seen as a non-historical hagiographical tradition designed to connect the family with royalty, but this claim is rejected for chronological and historical reasons. The most complete genealogy offered for the family stretches back to six or seven generations to famous Hanafi jurists.\nWe do not learn the name of Baha al-Din's mother in the sources, only that he referred to her as \"M\u0101mi\" (colloquial Persian for M\u0101ma), and that she was a simple woman who lived to the 1200s. The mother of Rumi was Mu'mina Kh\u0101t\u016bn. The profession of the family for several generations was that of Islamic preachers of the relatively liberal Hanafi Maturidi school, and this family tradition was continued by Rumi (see his Fihi Ma Fih and Seven Sermons) and Sultan Walad (see Ma'rif Waladi for examples of his everyday sermons and lectures).\nWhen the Mongols invaded Central Asia sometime between 1215 and 1220, Baha ud-Din Walad, with his whole family and a group of disciples, set out westwards. According to hagiographical account which is not agreed upon by all Rumi scholars, Rumi encountered one of the most famous mystic Persian poets, Attar, in the Iranian city of Nishapur, located in the province of Khor\u0101s\u0101n. Attar immediately recognized Rumi's spiritual eminence. He saw the father walking ahead of the son and said, \"Here comes a sea followed by an ocean.\" Attar gave the boy his \"Asr\u0101rn\u0101ma\", a book about the entanglement of the soul in the material world. This meeting had a deep impact on the eighteen-year-old Rumi and later on became the inspiration for his works.\nFrom Nishapur, Walad and his entourage set out for Baghdad, meeting many of the scholars and Sufis of the city. From Baghdad they went to Hejaz and performed the pilgrimage at Mecca. The migrating caravan then passed through Damascus, Malatya, Erzincan, Sivas, Kayseri and Nigde. They finally settled in Karaman for seven years; Rumi's mother and brother both died there. In 1225, Rumi married Gowhar Khatun in Karaman. They had two sons: Sultan Walad and Ala-eddin Chalabi. When his wife died, Rumi married again and had a son, Amir Alim Chalabi, and a daughter, Malakeh Khatun.\nOn 1 May 1228, most likely as a result of the insistent invitation of 'Al\u0101' ud-D\u012bn Key-Qob\u0101d, ruler of Anatolia, Baha' ud-Din came and finally settled in Konya in Anatolia within the westernmost territories of the Seljuk Sultanate of R\u00fbm.\nEducation and encounters with Shams-e Tabrizi.\nBaha' ud-Din became the head of a madrassa (religious school) and when he died, Rumi, aged twenty-five, inherited his position as the Islamic molvi. One of Baha' ud-Din's students, Sayyed Burhan ud-Din Muhaqqiq Termazi, continued to train Rumi in the Shariah as well as the Tariqa, especially that of Rumi's father. For nine years, Rumi practised Sufism as a disciple of Burhan ud-Din until the latter died in 1240 or 1241. Rumi's public life then began: he became an Islamic Jurist, issuing fatwas and giving sermons in the mosques of Konya. He also served as a Molvi (Islamic teacher) and taught his adherents in the madrassa.\nDuring this period, Rumi also travelled to Damascus and is said to have spent four years there.\nIt was his meeting with the dervish Shams-e Tabrizi on 15 November 1244 that completely changed his life. From an accomplished teacher and jurist, Rumi was transformed into an ascetic. Sufi mysticism places great emphasis on the master-disciple relationship, in which the younger disciple studies under an older master. It is essential to engage in discipleship to reach \"fana\", the highest level of spiritual development in Sufism.\nShams had travelled throughout the Middle East searching and praying for someone who could \"endure my company\". A voice said to him: \"What will you give in return?\" Shams replied, \"My head!\" The voice then said, \"The one you seek is Jalal ud-Din of Konya.\"\nOn the night of 5 December 1248, as Rumi and Shams were talking, Shams was called to the back door. He went out, never to be seen again. There are many theories as to Shams's disappearance. The most popular are that Rumi's youngest son killed him, that he was killed for blasphemy, or that Shams, a known wanderer, simply chose to move on.\nFor more than a month, Rumi refused to believe the rumors of Shams's death and waited for his return. After forty days, Rumi accepted that he was dead and began dressing in black to signal his mourning. Rumi's love for, and his bereavement at the death of, Shams found their expression in an outpouring of lyric poems, \"Divan-e Shams-e Tabrizi\". He himself went out searching for Shams and journeyed again to Damascus. There, he realised:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Why should I seek? I am the same as\nHe. His essence speaks through me.\nI have been looking for myself!\nLater life and death.\nMewlana had been spontaneously composing \"ghazals\" (Persian poems), and these had been collected in the \"Divan-i Kabir\" or Diwan Shams Tabrizi. Rumi found another companion in Sala\u1e25 ud-Din-e Zarkub, a goldsmith. After Salah ud-Din's death, Rumi's scribe and favourite student, Hussam-e Chalabi, assumed the role of Rumi's companion. One day, the two of them were wandering through the Meram vineyards outside Konya when Hussam described to Rumi an idea he had had: \"If you were to write a book like the \"Il\u0101h\u012bn\u0101ma\" of Sanai or the \"Mantiq ut-Tayr\" of 'Attar, it would become the companion of many troubadours. They would fill their hearts from your work and compose music to accompany it.\" Rumi smiled and took out a piece of paper on which were written the opening eighteen lines of his \"Masnavi\", beginning with:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Listen to the reed and the tale it tells,\nHow it sings of separation...\nHussam implored Rumi to write more. Rumi spent the next twelve years of his life in Anatolia dictating the six volumes of this masterwork, the \"Masnavi\", to Hussam.\nIn December 1273, Rumi fell ill; he predicted his own death and composed the well-known \"ghazal\", which begins with the verse:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;How doest thou know what sort of king I have within me as companion?\nDo not cast thy glance upon my golden face, for I have iron legs.\nRumi died on 17 December 1273 in Konya. His death was mourned by the diverse community of Konya, with local Christians and Jews joining the crowd that converged to bid farewell as his body was carried through the city. Rumi's body was interred beside that of his father, and a splendid shrine, the \"Green Tomb\" (Turkish: Ye\u015fil T\u00fcrbe, ; today the Mevl\u00e2na Museum), was erected over his place of burial. His epitaph reads:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;When we are dead, seek not our tomb in the earth,\nbut find it in the hearts of men.\nGeorgian princess and Seljuq queen Tamar Gurju Khatun was a close friend of Rumi. She was the one who sponsored the construction of his tomb in Konya. The 13th-century Mevl\u00e2na Mausoleum, with its mosque, dance hall, schools and living quarters for dervishes, remains a destination of pilgrimage to this day, and is probably the most popular pilgrimage site to be regularly visited by adherents of every major religion.\nTeachings.\nLike other mystic and Sufi poets of Persian literature, Rumi's poetry speaks of love which infuses the world. Rumi's teachings also express the tenets summarized in the Quranic verse which Shams-e Tabrizi cited as the essence of prophetic guidance: \"Know that \u2018There is no god but He,\u2019 and ask forgiveness for your sin\" (Q. 47:19). \nIn the interpretation attributed to Shams, the first part of the verse commands the humanity to seek knowledge of \"tawhid\" (oneness of God), while the second instructs them to negate their own existence. In Rumi's terms, \"tawhid\" is lived most fully through love, with the connection being made explicit in his verse that describes love as \"that flame which, when it blazes up, burns away everything except the Everlasting Beloved.\"\nRumi's longing and desire to attain this ideal is evident in the following poem from his book the Masnavi:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Verse translation/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Screen reader-only/styles.css\" /&gt;Translation:\nThe \"Masnavi\" weaves fables, scenes from everyday life, Qur'anic revelations and exegesis, and metaphysics into a vast and intricate tapestry.\nRumi believed passionately in the use of music, poetry and dance as a path for reaching God. For Rumi, music helped devotees to focus their whole being on the divine and to do this so intensely that the soul was both destroyed and resurrected. It was from these ideas that the practice of whirling Dervishes developed into a ritual form. His teachings became the base for the order of the Mevlevi, which his son Sultan Walad organised. Rumi encouraged Sama, listening to music and turning or doing the sacred dance. In the Mevlevi tradition, \"sam\u0101\u02bf\" represents a mystical journey of spiritual ascent through mind and love to the Perfect One. In this journey, the seeker symbolically turns towards the truth, grows through love, abandons the ego, finds the truth and arrives at the Perfect. The seeker then returns from this spiritual journey, with greater maturity, to love and to be of service to the whole of creation without discrimination with regard to beliefs, races, classes and nations.\nIn other verses in the \"Masnavi\", Rumi describes in detail the universal message of love:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The lover's cause is separate from all other causes\nLove is the astrolabe of God's mysteries.\nRumi's favourite musical instrument was the ney (reed flute).\nMajor works.\nRumi's poetry is often divided into various categories: the quatrains (\"rubay\u0101t\") and odes (\"ghazal\") of the \"Divan\", the six books of the \"Masnavi\". The prose works are divided into The Discourses, The Letters, and the \"Seven Sermons\".\nReligious outlook.\nDespite references to other religions, Rumi clearly holds the superiority of Islam. As Muslim, Rumi praises the Quran, not only as sacred book of Muslims, but also as tool to distinguish truth from falsehood. As such, the Quran features as guidebook for humanity and those who want to understand the reality of the world.\nThe prophets of Islam, according to Rumi, constitute the highest point of spiritual development and are the closest to God. Throughout Rumi's writings, Muhammad is the most perfect example of all previous prophets.\nDespite Rumi's explicit adherence to Islam, there are traces of religious pluralism throughout his work. Although Rumi acknowledges religious discrepancies, the core of all religions is the same. The disagreement between religions does not lie in the core of these religions, but in doctrinal differences. Accordingly, Rumi criticizes Christianity for \"overloading the image of God with superfluous structures and complications\". Yet, Rumi declares that \"the lamps are different, but the Light is the same; it comes from beyond\". Shibli Nomani, in his work \"Sawanih Maulana Rum\", argued that Rumi should not be seen solely as a mystical poet but also as a serious theologian.\nHis depth of his spiritual vision extended beyond narrow sectarian concerns. One quatrain reads:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Verse translation/styles.css\" /&gt;\n\u2014Quatrain 305\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Screen reader-only/styles.css\" /&gt;Translation:\nAccording to the Quran, Muhammad is a mercy sent by God. In regards to this, Rumi states:\n\"The Light of Muhammad does not abandon a Zoroastrian or Jew in the world. May the shade of his good fortune shine upon everyone! He brings all of those who are led astray into the Way out of the desert.\"\nRumi, however, asserts the supremacy of Islam by stating:\n\"The Light of Muhammad has become a thousand branches (of knowledge), a thousand, so that both this world and the next have been seized from end to end. If Muhammad rips the veil open from a single such branch, thousands of monks and priests will tear the string of false belief from around their waists.\"\nMany of Rumi's poems suggest the importance of outward religious observance and the primacy of the Qur'an.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Flee to God's Qur'an, take refuge in it\nthere with the spirits of the prophets merge.\nThe Book conveys the prophets' circumstances\nthose fish of the pure sea of Majesty.\nRumi states:\n&lt;poem&gt;I am the servant of the Qur'an as long as I have life.\nI am the dust on the path of Muhammad, the Chosen one.\nIf anyone quotes anything except this from my sayings,\nI am quit of him and outraged by these words.&lt;/poem&gt;\nRumi also states:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;I \"sewed\" my two eyes shut from [desires for] this world and the next \u2013 this I learned from Muhammad.\nOn the first page of the Masnavi, Rumi states:\n \"Hadha kit\u00e2bu 'l- mathnaw\u00eey wa huwa uS\u00fblu uS\u00fbli uS\u00fbli 'd-d\u00een wa kashsh\u00e2fu 'l-qur'\u00e2n.\"\n\"This is the book of the Masnavi, and it is the roots of the roots of the roots of the (Islamic) Religion and it is the Explainer of the Qur'\u00e2n.\"\nHadi Sabzavari, one of Iran's most important 19th-century philosophers, makes the following connection between the Masnavi and Islam, in the introduction to his philosophical commentary on the book:\nIt is a commentary on the versified exegesis [of the Qur\u2019\u0101n] and its occult mystery, since all of it [all of the Mathnaw\u012b] is, as you will see, an elucidation of the clear verses [of the Qur\u2019\u0101n], a clarification of prophetic utterances, a glimmer of the light of the luminous Qur\u2019\u0101n, and burning embers irradiating their rays from its shining lamp. As respects to hunting through the treasure-trove of the Qur\u2019\u0101n, one can find in it [the Mathnaw\u012b] all [the Qur\u2019\u0101n's] ancient philosophical wisdom; it [the Mathnaw\u012b] is all entirely eloquent philosophy. In truth, the pearly verse of the poem combines the Canon Law of Islam (shar\u012b\u02bfa) with the Sufi Path (\u1e6dar\u012bqa) and the Divine Reality (\u1e25aq\u012bqa); the author's [R\u016bm\u012b] achievement belongs to God in his bringing together of the Law (shar\u012b\u02bfa), the Path, and the Truth in a way that includes critical intellect, profound thought, a brilliant natural temperament, and integrity of character that is endowed with power, insight, inspiration, and illumination.\nSeyyed Hossein Nasr states:\nOne of the greatest living authorities on R\u00fbm\u00ee in Persia today, H\u00e2d\u00ee H\u00e2'ir\u00ee, has shown in an unpublished work that some 6,000 verses of the D\u00eew\u00e2n and the Mathnaw\u00ee are practically direct translations of Qur'\u00e2nic verses into Persian poetry.\nRumi states in his D\u012bw\u0101n:\nThe Sufi is hanging on to Muhammad, like Abu Bakr.\nLanguage.\nRumi's works are written in his mother tongue, Persian. He occasionally used the Arabic language and single Turkish and Greek words in his verse. Rumi's influence has transcended national borders and ethnic divisions: Iranians, Afghans, Tajiks, Turks, Kurds, Greeks, Central Asian Muslims, as well as Muslims of the Indian subcontinent have greatly appreciated his spiritual legacy for the past seven centuries. His poetry influenced not only Persian literature, but also the literary traditions of the Ottoman Turkish, Chagatai, Pashto, Kurdish, Urdu, and Bengali languages.\nLegacy.\nUniversality.\nRumi's work has been translated into many of the world's languages, including Russian, German, Urdu, Turkish, Arabic, Bengali, French, Italian, Spanish, Telugu and Kannada and is being presented in a growing number of formats, including concerts, workshops, readings, dance performances, and other artistic creations. The English interpretations of Rumi's poetry by Coleman Barks have sold more than half a million copies worldwide, and Rumi is one of the most widely read poets in the United States. There is a famous landmark in Northern India, known as Rumi Gate, situated in Lucknow (the capital of Uttar Pradesh) named for Rumi. Indian filmmaker Muzaffar Ali who is from Lucknow made a documentary, titled \"Rumi in the Land of Khusrau\" (2001), which presents concerts based on the works of Rumi and Amir Khusrau and highlights parallels between the lives of the poets.\nIranian world.\nThese cultural, historical and linguistic ties between Rumi and Iran have made Rumi an iconic Iranian poet, and some of the most important Rumi scholars including Foruzanfar, Naini, Sabzewari, etc., have come from modern Iran. Rumi's poetry is displayed on the walls of many cities across Iran, sung in Persian music, and read in school books.\nRumi's poetry forms the basis of much classical Iranian and Afghan music. Contemporary classical interpretations of his poetry are made by Muhammad Reza Shajarian, Shahram Nazeri, Davood Azad (the three from Iran) and Ustad Mohammad Hashem Cheshti (Afghanistan).\nMewlew\u012b Sufi Order; Rumi and Turkey.\nThe Mewlew\u012b Sufi order was founded in 1273 by Rumi's followers after his death. His first successor could have been Salah-eddin Zarkoub who served Rumi for a decade and was respected by Rumi. Zarkoub was illiterate and uttered some words incorrectly, but Rumi used some of these incorrect words in his poems to express his support and humility towards Zarkoub. Rumi named him his successor, but Zarkoub died before him. So Rumi's first successor in the rectorship of the order was Husam Chalabi and, after Chalabi's death in 1284, Rumi's younger and only surviving son, Sultan Walad (d. 1312), popularly known as author of the mystical \"Ma\u1e6dnaw\u012b Rab\u0101bn\u0101ma\", or the \"Book of the Rabab\" was installed as grand master of the order. The leadership of the order has been kept within Rumi's family in Konya uninterruptedly since then.\nThe Mewlew\u012b Sufis, also known as Whirling Dervishes, believe in performing their \"dhikr\" in the form of Sama. During the time of Rumi (as attested in the \"Man\u0101qib ul-\u0100ref\u012bn\" of Afl\u0101k\u012b), his followers gathered for musical and \"turning\" practices.\nAccording to tradition, Rumi was himself a notable musician who played the \"rob\u0101b\", although his favourite instrument was the \"ney\" or reed flute. The music accompanying the \"sam\u0101\u02bf\" consists of settings of poems from the \"Ma\u1e6dnaw\u012b\" and \"D\u012bw\u0101n-e Kab\u012br\", or of Sultan Walad's poems. The Mawlaw\u012byah was a well-established Sufi order in the Ottoman Empire, and many of the members of the order served in various official positions of the Caliphate. The centre for the Mevlevi was in Konya. There is also a Mewlew\u012b monastery (, \"darg\u0101h\") in Istanbul near the Galata Tower in which the \"sam\u0101\u02bf\" is performed and accessible to the public. The Mewlew\u012b order issues an invitation to people of all backgrounds:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Rquote/styles.css\"/&gt;{ class=\"rquote pullquote floatright\" role=\"presentation\" style=\"display:table; border-collapse:collapse; border-style:none; float:right; margin:0.5em 0.75em; width:33%; \"\nDuring Ottoman times, the Mevlevi produced a number of notable poets and musicians, including Sheikh Ghalib, Ismail Rusuhi Dede of Ankara, Esrar Dede, Halet Efendi, and Gavsi Dede, who are all buried at the Galata Mewlew\u012b Kh\u0101na (Turkish: \"Mevlevi-Hane\") in Istanbul. Music, especially that of the ney, plays an important part in the Mevlevi.\nWith the foundation of the modern, secular Republic of Turkey, Mustafa Kemal Atat\u00fcrk removed religion from the sphere of public policy and restricted it exclusively to that of personal morals, behaviour and faith. On 13 December 1925, a law was passed closing all the \"tekkes\" (dervish lodges) and \"z\u0101wiyas\" (chief dervish lodges), and the centres of veneration to which visits (\"ziy\u0101rat\") were made. Istanbul alone had more than 250 \"tekke\"s as well as small centres for gatherings of various fraternities; this law dissolved the Sufi Orders, prohibited the use of mystical names, titles and costumes pertaining to their titles, impounded the Orders' assets, and banned their ceremonies and meetings. The law also provided penalties for those who tried to re-establish the Orders. Two years later, in 1927, the Mausoleum of Mevl\u00e2na in Konya was allowed to reopen as a Museum.\nIn the 1950s, the Turkish government began allowing the Whirling Dervishes to perform once a year in Konya. The Mewl\u0101n\u0101 festival is held over two weeks in December; its culmination is on 17 December, the Urs of Mewl\u0101n\u0101 (anniversary of Rumi's death), called \"\u0160ab-e Ar\u016bs\" () (Persian meaning \"nuptial night\"), the night of Rumi's union with God. In 1974, the Whirling Dervishes were permitted to travel to the West for the first time. In 2005, UNESCO proclaimed \"The Mevlevi Sama Ceremony\" of Turkey as one of the Masterpieces of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity.\nRumi and his mausoleum were depicted on the reverse of the 5000 Turkish lira banknotes of 1981\u20131994.\nReligious denomination.\nAs Edward G. Browne noted, the three most prominent mystical Persian poets, Rumi, Sanai and Attar, were all Sunni Muslims and their poetry abounds with praise for the first two caliphs, Abu Bakr and Umar ibn al-Khatt\u0101b. According to Annemarie Schimmel, the tendency among Shia authors to anachronistically include leading mystical poets such as Rumi and Attar among their own ranks, became stronger after the introduction of Twelver Shia as the state religion in the Safavid Empire in 1501.\nEight-hundredth anniversary celebrations.\nIn Afghanistan, Rumi is known as \"Mawl\u0101n\u0101\", in Turkey as \"Mevl\u00e2na\", and in Iran as \"Molav\u012b\".\nAt the proposal of the Permanent Delegations of Afghanistan, Iran, and Turkey, and as approved by its executive board and General Conference in conformity with its mission of \"constructing in the minds of men the defences of peace\", UNESCO was associated with the celebration, in 2007, of the eight hundredth anniversary of Rumi's birth. The commemoration at UNESCO itself took place on 6 September 2007; UNESCO issued a medal in Rumi's name in the hope that it would prove an encouragement to those who are engaged in research on and dissemination of Rumi's ideas and ideals, which would, in turn, enhance the diffusion of the ideals of UNESCO.\nOn 30 September 2007, Iranian school bells were rung throughout the country in honour of Mewlana. Also in that year, Iran held a Rumi Week from 26 October to 2 November. An international ceremony and conference were held in Tehran; the event was opened by the Iranian president and the chairman of the Iranian parliament.

It serves 18 million users and is the busiest National Research and Education Network in Europe by volume of data carried. Previously, Janet was a private, UK-government funded organisation, which provided the JANET computer network and related collaborative services to UK research and education.\nAll further- and higher-education organisations in the UK are connected to the Janet network, as are all the Research Councils; the majority of these sites are connected via 20 metropolitan area networks across the UK (though Janet refers to these as regions, emphasising that Janet connections are not just confined to a metropolitan area). The network also carries traffic between schools within the UK, although many of the schools' networks maintain their own general Internet connectivity. The name was originally a contraction of Joint Academic NETwork but it is now known as Janet in its own right.\nThe network is linked to other European and worldwide NRENs through G\u00c9ANT and peers extensively with other ISPs at Internet Exchange Points in the UK. Any other networks are reached via transit services from commercial ISPs using Janet's Peering Policy.\nThe Janet network is operated by Jisc Services Limited, part of Jisc. Janet is also responsible for the .ac.uk domain. On 1 December 2012, Janet and Jisc Collections joined to form Jisc Collections and Janet Limited, as subsidiary organisations to Jisc. In March 2015, Jisc Collections and Janet Limited was renamed to Jisc Services Limited. Jisc Services continues to operate under the brand name of Janet, with the same remit. Janet was previously known as the JNT Association, and prior to that, UKERNA (the United Kingdom Education and Research Networking Association).\nHistory.\nEarly academic networks.\nJanet developed out of academic networks built in Britain since the late 1960s. Planning for the first regional network, South West Universities Computer Network (SWUCN), centred on Bristol began in 1967 and work started in 1969. A number of national computer facilities serving the Science Research Council (SRC) community developed in the early 1970s, each with their own star network (ULCC London, UMRCC Manchester, Rutherford Appleton Laboratory). Other regional networks followed in the mid-late 1970s around Edinburgh (RCOnet), London (METROnet), the Midlands (MIDnet), and Newcastle (NUMAC - the Northern Universities Multiple Access Computer) among others such as Yorkshire and the South East. These groups of institutions pooled resources to provide better computing facilities than could be afforded individually. The star networks developed into distributed computer networks but each was based on one manufacturer's standards and were mutually incompatible and overlapping.\nJANET.\nIn the early 1980s a standardisation and interconnection effort started, hosted on an expansion of the SERCnet X.25 research network. The JANET effort was based on the Coloured Book protocols developed by the British academic community, which provided the first complete X.25 standard, and gave the UK \"several years lead over other countries\". The naming scheme, JANET NRS, established \"UK\" as the top-level domain. Later that year, the Internet's Domain Name System adopted British researchers' recommendation to use country code top-level domains. By then, the UK had a pre-existing national standard, which was retained as the .uk Internet country-code top level domain for the United Kingdom.\nJANET went live on 1 April 1984, two years before the NSFNET initiated operations in the United States. It hosted about 50 sites with line speeds of 9.6\u00a0kbit/s. In the mid-80s the backbone was upgraded to 2\u00a0Mbit/s, with 64\u00a0kbit/s access links. JANET connected to NSFNET in 1989.\nJIPS.\nPlanning began in January 1991 for the JANET Internet Protocol Service (JIPS). It was set up as a pilot project in March 1991 to host Internet Protocol (IP) traffic on the existing network. Within eight months the IP traffic had exceeded the levels of X.25 traffic, and the IP support became official in November. \nJANET became, primarily, a high-speed IP network. A further upgrade in the early 1990s took the backbone to 8\u00a0Mbit/s and the access links to 2\u00a0Mbit/s, making Janet the fastest X.25 network in the world at the time.\nThere had been some talk of moving Janet to OSI protocols in the 1990s, but changes in the networking world meant this never happened. The X.25 service was closed in August 1997. \nSuperJanet.\nIn order to address speed concerns, several hardware upgrades have been incorporated into the Janet system. In 1989 SuperJanet was proposed, to re-host JANET on a fibre optic network. Work started in late 1992, and by late 1993 the first 14 sites had migrated to the new 34\u00a0Mbit/s ATM system. SuperJanet also moved solely to IP.\nIn 1995 SuperJanet2 started, adding 155\u00a0Mbit/s ATM backbones and a 10\u00a0Mbit/s SMDS network encompassing some of the original JANET nodes. JANET's mandate now included running metropolitan area networks centred on these sites.\nSuperJanet3 created new 155\u00a0Mbit/s ATM nodes to fully connect all of the major sites at London, Bristol, Manchester and Leeds, with 34\u00a0Mbit/s links to smaller sites around the country.\nIn March 2001 SuperJanet4 was launched. The key challenges for SuperJanet4 were the need to increase network capacity and to strengthen the design and management of the JANET network to allow it to meet a similar increase in the size of its userbase.\nSuperJanet4 saw the implementation of a 2.5\u00a0Gbit/s core backbone from which connections to regional network points of presence were made at speeds ranging between 155\u00a0Mbit/s to 2.5\u00a0Gbit/s depending upon the size of the regional network. In 2002 the core SuperJanet4 backbone was upgraded to 10\u00a0Gbit/s.\nSuperJanet4 also saw an increase in the userbase of the JANET network, with the inclusion of the Further Education Community and the use of the SuperJanet4 backbone to interconnect schools' networks. The core point of presence (Backbone) sites in SuperJanet4 were Edinburgh, Glasgow, Warrington, Reading, Bristol, Portsmouth, London and Leeds.\nIn October 2006 the SuperJanet5 project was launched after \u00a329 million of investment. It provides a 10\u00a0Gbit/s backbone, with an upgrade path to 40\u00a0Gbit/s over the next few years. The new backbone as a result of the SuperJanet5 project is a hybrid network offering, providing both a high speed IP transit service and private bandwidth channel services provisioned over a dedicated fibre network. It is designed not only to fully accommodate the requirements of the traditional JANET user base - all research institutes, universities and further education - but also to meet the needs of a new userbase in the UK's primary and secondary schools.\nIn April 2011 Verizon helped Janet upgrade 4 central locations to run at 100\u00a0Gbit/s bringing it to a national research and education network performance parity with Internet2 (which upgraded its backbone to 100\u00a0Gbit/s in October 2007). As of October 2011 they have over 18 million end-users.\nJanet6 started to go live in July 2013, and was officially launched at an event at the London Film Museum on 26 November 2013. At launch, Janet6 had an initial capacity of 2\u00a0Tbit/s.\nRegions.\nThe Janet network is implemented through 18 regions which connect universities, colleges and schools to the Janet network. Most regions are operated by Janet, although a few operate as independent entities working under contract.\nEach regional network covers a specific geographical area. As of 2014 the following regional networks are connected to Janet:\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The problem he solved had been considered so important following the Scilly naval disaster of 1707 that the British Parliament was offering financial rewards of up to \u00a320,000 (equivalent to \u00a3 in 2023) under the 1714 Longitude Act, though Harrison never received the full reward due to political rivalries. He presented his first design in 1730, and worked over many years on improved designs, making several advances in time-keeping technology, finally turning to what were called sea watches. Harrison gained support from the Longitude Board in building and testing his designs. Towards the end of his life, he received recognition and a reward from Parliament.\nEarly life.\nJohn Harrison was born in Foulby in the West Riding of Yorkshire, the first of five children in his family. His stepfather worked as a carpenter at the nearby Nostell Priory estate. A house on the site of what may have been the family home bears a blue plaque. Around 1700, the Harrison family moved to the Lincolnshire village of Barrow upon Humber. Following his father's trade as a carpenter, Harrison built and repaired clocks in his spare time. Legend has it that at the age of six, while in bed with smallpox, he was given a watch to amuse himself and he spent hours listening to it and studying its moving parts.\nHe also had a fascination with music, eventually becoming choirmaster for the Church of Holy Trinity, Barrow upon Humber.\nHarrison built his first longcase clock in 1713, at the age of 20. The mechanism was made entirely of wood. Three of Harrison's early wooden clocks have survived:\nThe Nostell example, in the billiards room of the stately home, has a Victorian outer case with small glass windows on each side of the movement so that the wooden workings may be inspected.\nOn 30 August 1718 John Harrison married Elizabeth Barret at Barrow upon Humber church. After her death in 1726, he married Elizabeth Scott on 23 November 1726, at the same church.\nIn the early 1720s Harrison was commissioned to make a new turret clock at Brocklesby Hall, North Lincolnshire. The clock still works, and like his previous clocks has a wooden movement of oak and lignum vitae. Unlike his early clocks, it incorporates some original features to improve timekeeping, for example the grasshopper escapement. Between 1725 and 1728, John and his brother James, also a skilled joiner, made at least three precision longcase clocks, again with the movements and longcase made of oak and lignum vitae. The grid-iron pendulum was developed during this period. Of these longcase clocks:\nHarrison was a man of many skills and he used these to systematically improve the performance of the pendulum clock. He invented the gridiron pendulum, consisting of alternating brass and iron rods assembled in such a way that the thermal expansions and contractions essentially cancel each other out. Another example of his inventive genius was the grasshopper escapement, a control device for the step-by-step release of a clock's driving power. Developed from the anchor escapement, it was almost frictionless, requiring no lubrication because the pallets were made from wood. This was an important advantage at a time when lubricants and their degradation were little understood. In his earlier work on sea clocks, Harrison was continually assisted, both financially and in many other ways, by the watchmaker and instrument maker George Graham. Harrison was introduced to Graham by the Astronomer Royal Edmond Halley, who championed Harrison and his work. The support was important to Harrison, as he was supposed to have found it difficult to communicate his ideas in a coherent manner.\nLongitude problem.\nLongitude fixes the location of a place on Earth east or west of a north\u2013south reference line called the prime meridian. It is given as an angular measurement that ranges from 0\u00b0 at the prime meridian to +180\u00b0 eastward and \u2212180\u00b0 westward. Knowledge of a ship's east\u2013west position is essential when approaching land. Over long voyages, cumulative errors in estimates of position by dead reckoning frequently led to shipwrecks and a great loss of life. Avoiding such disasters became vital in Harrison's lifetime, in an era when trade and the need for accurate navigation were increasing dramatically around the world.\nMany ideas were proposed for how to determine longitude during a sea voyage. Earlier methods attempted to compare local time with the known time at a reference place, such as Greenwich or Paris, based on a simple theory that had first been proposed by Gemma Frisius. The methods relied on astronomical observations that were themselves reliant on the predictable nature of the motions of different heavenly bodies. Such methods were problematic because of the difficulty in maintaining an accurate record of the time at the reference place.\nHarrison set out to solve the problem directly, by producing a reliable clock that could keep the time of the reference place accurately over long intervals without having to constantly adjust it. The difficulty was in producing a clock that was not affected by variations in temperature, pressure, or humidity, resisted corrosion in salt air, and was able to function on board a constantly moving ship. Many scientists, including Sir Isaac Newton and Christiaan Huygens, doubted that such a clock could ever be built and favoured other methods for reckoning longitude, such as the method of lunar distances. Huygens ran trials using both a pendulum and a spiral balance spring clock as methods of determining longitude; both produced inconsistent results. Newton observed that \"a good watch may serve to keep a reckoning at sea for some days and to know the time of a celestial observation; and for this end a good Jewel may suffice till a better sort of watch can be found out. But when longitude at sea is lost, it cannot be found again by any watch\".\nFirst three marine timekeepers.\nIn the 1720s the English clockmaker Henry Sully invented a marine clock that was designed to determine longitude: this was in the form of a clock with a large balance wheel that was vertically mounted on friction rollers and impulsed by a frictional rest Debaufre-type escapement. Very unconventionally, the balance oscillations were controlled by a weight at the end of a pivoted horizontal lever attached to the balance by a cord. This solution avoided temperature error due to thermal expansion, a problem which affects steel balance springs. Sully's clock kept accurate time only in calm weather, however, because the balance oscillations were affected by the pitching and rolling of the ship. Still, his clocks were among the first serious attempts to find longitude by improving the accuracy of timekeeping at sea. Harrison's machines, though much larger, are of similar layout: H3 has a vertically mounted balance wheel and is linked to another wheel of the same size, an arrangement that eliminates problems arising from the ship's motion.\nIn 1716 Sully presented his first to the French Acad\u00e9mie des Sciences and in 1726 he published . In 1730 Harrison designed a marine clock to compete for the Longitude prize and travelled to London, seeking financial assistance. He presented his ideas to Edmond Halley, the Astronomer Royal, who in turn referred him to George Graham, the country's foremost clockmaker. Graham must have been impressed by Harrison's ideas, for he loaned him money to build a model of his \"Sea clock\". As the clock was an attempt to make a seagoing version of his wooden pendulum clocks, which performed exceptionally well, he used wooden wheels, roller pinions, and a version of the grasshopper escapement. Instead of a pendulum, he used two dumbbell balances which were linked together.\nIt took Harrison five years to build his first sea clock (or H1). He demonstrated it to members of the Royal Society who spoke on his behalf to the Board of Longitude. The clock was the first proposal that the Board considered to be worthy of a sea trial. In 1736, Harrison sailed to Lisbon on HMS \"Centurion\" under the command of Captain George Proctor and returned on HMS \"Orford\" after Proctor died at Lisbon on 4 October 1736. The clock lost time on the outward voyage. However, it performed well on the return trip: both the captain and the sailing master of the \"Orford\" praised the design. The master noted that his own calculations had placed the ship sixty miles east of its true landfall which had been correctly predicted by Harrison using H1.\nThis was not the transatlantic voyage stipulated by the Board of Longitude in their conditions for winning the prize, but the Board was impressed enough to grant Harrison \u00a3500 for further development. Harrison had moved to London by 1737 and went on to develop H2, a more compact and rugged version. In 1741, after three years of building and two of on-land testing, H2 was ready, but by then Britain was at war with Spain in the War of the Austrian Succession, and the mechanism was deemed too important to risk falling into Spanish hands. In any event, Harrison suddenly abandoned all work on this second machine when he discovered a serious design flaw in the concept of the bar balances. He had not recognized that the period of oscillation of the bar balances could be affected by the yawing action of the ship (when the ship turned upon its vertical axis, such as when \"coming about\" while tacking). It was this that led him to adopt circular balances in the Third Sea Clock (H3). The Board granted him another \u00a3500 and while waiting for the war to end, he proceeded to work on H3.\nHarrison spent seventeen years working on this third \"sea clock\", but despite every effort it did not perform exactly as he had wished. The problem was that, because Harrison did not fully understand the physics behind the springs used to control the balance wheels, the timing of the wheels was not isochronous, a characteristic that affected its accuracy. The engineering world was not to fully understand the properties of springs for such applications for another two centuries. Despite that, it had proved a very valuable experiment and much was learned from its construction. Certainly with this machine Harrison left the world two enduring legacies\u2013the bimetallic strip and the caged roller bearing.\nLongitude watches.\nAfter steadfastly pursuing various methods during thirty years of experimentation, Harrison found to his surprise that some of the watches made by Graham's successor Thomas Mudge kept time just as accurately as his huge sea clocks. It is possible that Mudge was able to do this after the early 1740s thanks to the availability of the new \"Huntsman\" or \"Crucible\" steel first produced by Benjamin Huntsman sometime in the early 1740s, which enabled harder pinions but more importantly a tougher and more highly polished cylinder escapement to be produced. Harrison then realized that a mere watch after all could be made accurate enough for the task and was a far more practical proposition for use as a marine timekeeper. He proceeded to redesign the concept of the watch as a timekeeping device, basing his design on sound scientific principles.\n\"Jefferys\" watch.\nHe had already in the early 1750s designed a precision watch for his own use, which was made for him by the watchmaker John Jefferys c. 1752\u20131753. This watch incorporated a novel frictional rest escapement and was not only the first to have a compensation for temperature variations but also contained the first miniature \"going train fusee\" of Harrison's design which enabled the watch to continue running whilst being wound. These features led to the very successful performance of the \"Jefferys\" watch, which Harrison incorporated into the design of two new timekeepers which he proposed to build. These were in the form of a large watch and another of a smaller size but similar pattern. However, only the larger No. 1 watch (or \"H4\" as it is sometimes called) appears to have been finished (see the reference to \"H4\" below). Aided by some of London's finest workmen, he proceeded to design and make the world's first successful marine timekeeper that allowed a navigator to accurately assess his ship's position in longitude. Importantly, Harrison showed everyone that it could be done by using a watch to calculate longitude. This was to be Harrison's masterpiece \u2013 an instrument of beauty, resembling an oversized pocket watch from the period. It is engraved with Harrison's signature, marked Number 1 and dated AD 1759.\nH4.\nHarrison's first \"sea watch\" (now known as H4) is housed in silver pair cases some in diameter. The clock's movement is highly complex for the period, resembling a larger version of the then-current conventional movement. A coiled steel spring inside a brass mainspring barrel provides 30 hours of power. That is covered by the fusee barrel which pulls a chain wrapped around the conically shaped pulley known as the fusee. The fusee is topped by the winding square (requiring a separate key). The great wheel attached to the base of this fusee transmits power to the rest of the movement. The fusee contains the maintaining power, a mechanism for keeping the H4 going while being wound. From Gould: &lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The escapement is a modification of the \"verge\" fitted to... the common watches of Harrison's day. But the modifications are extensive. The pallets are very small, and have their faces set parallel, instead of at the usual angle of 95\u00b0 or so. Moreover, instead of being steel, they are of diamond, and their backs are shaped to cycloidal curves... The action of this escapement is quite different from that of the verge, which it appears to resemble. In that escapement, the teeth of the crown wheel act only upon the faces of the pallets. But in this, as will be seen from the points of the teeth rest, for a considerable portion of the supplementary arc\u2014from 90\u00b0 to 145\u00b0 (limit of banking) past the dead point\u2014upon the \"backs\" of the pallets, and tend to assist the balance towards the extreme of its swing and to retard its return. This escapement is obviously a great improvement upon the verge, as the train has far less power over the motions of the balance. The latter is no longer checked in its swing by a force equal to that which originally impelled it, but by the balance spring, assisted only by the friction between the tooth and the back of the pallet.\nIn comparison, the verge's escapement has a recoil with a limited balance arc and is sensitive to variations in driving torque. According to a review by H. M. Frodsham of the movement in 1878, H4's escapement had \"a good deal of 'set' and not so much recoil, and as a result the impulse came very near to a double chronometer action\".\nThe D-shaped pallets of Harrison's escapement are both made of diamond, approximately 2\u00a0mm long with the curved side radius of 0.6\u00a0mm, a considerable feat of manufacture at the time. For technical reasons the balance was made much larger than in a conventional watch of the period, in diameter weighing and the vibrations controlled by a flat spiral steel spring of three turns with a long straight tail. The spring is tapered, being thicker at the stud end and tapering toward the collet at the centre. The movement also has centre seconds motion with a sweep seconds hand.\nThe Third Wheel is equipped with internal teeth and has an elaborate bridge similar to the pierced and engraved bridge for the period. It runs at 5 beats (ticks) per second, and is equipped with a tiny &lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;7+1\u20442 second remontoire. A balance-brake, activated by the position of the fusee, stops the watch half an hour before it is completely run down, in order that the remontoire does not run down also. Temperature compensation is in the form of a 'compensation curb' (or 'Thermometer Kirb' as Harrison called it). This takes the form of a bimetallic strip mounted on the regulating slide, and carrying the curb pins at the free end. During its initial testing, Harrison dispensed with this regulation using the slide, but left its indicating dial or figure piece in place. This first watch took six years to construct, following which the Board of Longitude determined to trial it on a voyage from Portsmouth to Kingston in the Colony of Jamaica. For this purpose it was placed aboard the 50-gun , which set sail from Portsmouth on 18 November 1761. Harrison, by then 68 years old, sent it on this transatlantic trial in the care of his son, William. The watch was tested before departure by Robertson, Master of the Academy at Portsmouth, who reported that on 6 November 1761 at noon it was 3 seconds slow, having lost 24 seconds in 9 days on mean solar time. The daily rate of the watch was therefore fixed as losing &lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;24\u20449 seconds per day.\nWhen \"Deptford\" reached its destination, after correction for the initial error of 3 seconds and accumulated loss of 3 minutes 36.5 seconds at the daily rate over the 81 days and 5 hours of the voyage, the watch was found to be 5 seconds slow compared to the known longitude of Kingston, corresponding to an error in longitude of 1.25 minutes, or approximately one nautical mile. William Harrison returned aboard the 14-gun , reaching England on 26 March 1762 to report the successful outcome of the experiment. Harrison senior thereupon waited for the \u00a320,000 prize, but the Board were persuaded that the accuracy could have been just luck and demanded another trial. The Board were also not convinced that a timekeeper which took six years to construct met the test of practicality required by the Longitude Act. The Harrisons were outraged and demanded their prize, a matter that eventually worked its way to Parliament, which offered \u00a35,000 for the design. The Harrisons refused but were eventually obliged to make another trip to Bridgetown on the island of Barbados to settle the matter.\nAt the time of this second trial, another method for measuring longitude was ready for testing: the Method of Lunar Distances. The Moon moves fast enough, some thirteen degrees a day, to easily measure the movement from day to day. By comparing the angle between the Moon and the Sun for the day one left for Britain, the \"proper position\" (how it would appear in Greenwich, England, at that specific time) of the Moon could be calculated. By comparing this with the angle of the Moon over the horizon, the longitude could be calculated. During Harrison's second trial of his 'sea watch' (H4), Nevil Maskelyne was asked to accompany HMS \"Tartar\" and test the Lunar Distances system. Once again the watch proved extremely accurate, keeping time to within 39 seconds, corresponding to an error in the longitude of Bridgetown of less than . Maskelyne's measures were also fairly good, at , but required considerable work and calculation in order to use. At a meeting of the Board in 1765 the results were presented, but they again attributed the accuracy of the measurements to luck. Once again the matter reached Parliament, which offered \u00a310,000 in advance and the other half once he turned over the design to other watchmakers to duplicate. In the meantime Harrison's watch would have to be turned over to the Astronomer Royal for long-term on-land testing.\nUnfortunately, Nevil Maskelyne had been appointed Astronomer Royal on his return from Barbados, and was therefore also placed on the Board of Longitude. He returned a report of the watch that was negative, claiming that its \"going rate\" (the amount of time it gained or lost per day) was due to inaccuracies cancelling themselves out, and refused to allow it to be factored out when measuring longitude. Consequently, this first Marine Watch of Harrison's failed the needs of the Board despite the fact that it had succeeded in two previous trials.\nHarrison began working on his second 'sea watch' (H5) while testing was conducted on the first, which Harrison felt was being held hostage by the Board. After three years he had had enough; Harrison felt \"extremely ill used by the gentlemen who I might have expected better treatment from\" and decided to enlist the aid of King George III. He obtained an audience with the King, who was extremely annoyed with the Board. King George tested the watch No. 2 (H5) himself at the palace and after ten weeks of daily observations between May and July in 1772, found it to be accurate to within one third of one second per day. King George then advised Harrison to petition Parliament for the full prize after threatening to appear in person to dress them down. Finally in 1773, when he was 80 years old, Harrison received a monetary award in the amount of \u00a38,750 from Parliament for his achievements, but he never received the official award (which was never awarded to anyone). He was to live for just three more years.\nIn total, Harrison received \u00a323,065 for his work on chronometers. He received \u00a34,315 in increments from the Board of Longitude for his work, \u00a310,000 as an interim payment for H4 in 1765 and \u00a38,750 from Parliament in 1773. This gave him a reasonable income for most of his life (equivalent to roughly \u00a3450,000 per year in 2007, though all his costs, such as materials and subcontracting work to other horologists, had to come out of this). He became the equivalent of a multi-millionaire (in today's terms) in the final decade of his life. Captain James Cook used K1, a copy of H4, on his second and third voyages, having used the lunar distance method on his first voyage. K1 was made by Larcum Kendall, who had been apprenticed to John Jefferys. Cook's log is full of praise for the watch and the charts of the southern Pacific Ocean he made with its use were remarkably accurate. K2 was loaned to Lieutenant William Bligh, commander of HMS \"Bounty\", but it was retained by Fletcher Christian following the infamous mutiny. It was not recovered from Pitcairn Island until 1808, when it was given to Captain Mayhew Folger, and then passed through several hands before reaching the National Maritime Museum in London.\nInitially, the cost of these chronometers was quite high (roughly 30% of a ship's cost). However, over time, the costs dropped to between \u00a325 and \u00a3100 (half a year's to two years' salary for a skilled worker) in the early 19th century. Many historians point to relatively low production volumes over time as evidence that the chronometers were not widely used. However, Landes points out that the chronometers lasted for decades and did not need to be replaced frequently\u2013indeed the number of makers of marine chronometers reduced over time due to the ease in supplying the demand even as the merchant marine expanded. Also, many merchant mariners would make do with a deck chronometer at half the price. These were not as accurate as the boxed marine chronometer but were adequate for many. While the Lunar Distances method would complement and rival the marine chronometer initially, the chronometer would overtake it in the 19th century. The more accurate Harrison timekeeping device led to the much-needed precise calculation of longitude, making the device a fundamental key to the modern age. After Harrison, the marine timekeeper was reinvented yet again by John Arnold, who, while basing his design on Harrison's most important principles, at the same time simplified it enough for him to produce equally accurate but far less costly marine chronometers in quantity from around 1783. Nonetheless, for many years even towards the end of the 18th century, chronometers were expensive rarities, as their adoption and use proceeded slowly due to the high expense of precision manufacturing. The expiry of Arnold's patents at the end of the 1790s enabled many other watchmakers including Thomas Earnshaw to produce chronometers in greater quantities at less cost even than those of Arnold.\nBy the early 19th century, navigation at sea without one was considered unwise to unthinkable. Using a chronometer to aid navigation simply saved lives and ships \u2013 the insurance industry, self-interest, and common sense did the rest in making the device a universal tool of maritime trade.\nDeath and memorials.\nHarrison died on 24 March 1776, at the age of eighty-two, just shy of his eighty-third birthday. He was buried in the graveyard of St John's Church, Hampstead, in North London, along with his second wife Elizabeth and later their son William. His tomb was restored in 1879 by the Worshipful Company of Clockmakers, even though Harrison had never been a member of the Company.\nHarrison's last home was 12 Red Lion Square in the Holborn district of London. There is a blue plaque dedicated to Harrison on the wall of Summit House, a 1925 modernist office block, on the south side of the square. A memorial tablet to Harrison was unveiled in Westminster Abbey on 24 March 2006, finally recognising him as a worthy companion to his friend George Graham and Thomas Tompion, 'The Father of English Watchmaking', who are both buried in the Abbey. The memorial shows a meridian line (line of constant longitude) in two metals to highlight Harrison's most widespread invention, the bimetallic strip thermometer. The strip is engraved with its own longitude of 0 degrees, 7 minutes and 35 seconds West.\nThe Corpus Clock in Cambridge, unveiled in 2008, is a homage by the designer to Harrison's work but is of an electromechanical design. In appearance it features Harrison's grasshopper escapement, the 'pallet frame' being sculpted to resemble an actual grasshopper. This is the clock's defining feature.\nIn 2014, Northern Rail named diesel railcar 153316 as the \"John 'Longitude' Harrison\".\nOn 3 April 2018 Google celebrated his 325th birthday by making a Google Doodle for its homepage.\nIn February 2020 a bronze statue of Harrison, created by the sculptor Marcus Cornish, was unveiled in Barrow upon Humber.\nLater history.\nAfter the First World War Harrison's timepieces were rediscovered at the Royal Greenwich Observatory by the retired naval officer Lieutenant Commander Rupert Gould.\nThe timepieces were in a highly decrepit state and Gould spent many years documenting, repairing and restoring them, without compensation for his efforts. Gould was the first to designate the timepieces from H1 to H5, initially calling them No.1 to No.5. Unfortunately, Gould made modifications and repairs that would not pass today's standards of good museum conservation practice, although most Harrison scholars give Gould credit for having ensured that the historical artifacts survived as working mechanisms to the present time. Gould wrote \"The Marine Chronometer\", published in 1923, which covered the history of chronometers from the Middle Ages to the 1920s, and which included detailed descriptions of Harrison's work and the subsequent evolution of the chronometer. The book remains the authoritative work on the marine chronometer. Today the restored H1, H2, H3, and H4 timepieces can be seen on display in the Royal Observatory at Greenwich. H1, H2, and H3 still work: H4 is kept in a stopped state because, unlike the first three, it requires oil for lubrication and so will degrade as it runs. H5 is owned by the Worshipful Company of Clockmakers of London, and was previously on display at the Clockmakers' Museum in the Guildhall, London, as part of the Company's collection; since 2015 the collection has been displayed in the Science Museum, London.\nIn the final years of his life, Harrison wrote about his research into musical tuning and manufacturing methods for bells. His tuning system (a meantone system derived from pi), is described in his pamphlet \"A Description Concerning Such Mechanism\u00a0... (CSM)\". The system challenged the traditional view that harmonics occur at integer frequency ratios and in consequence all music using this tuning produces low-frequency beating. In 2002 Harrison's last manuscript, \"A true and short, but full Account of the Foundation of Musick, or, as principally therein, of the Existence of the Natural Notes of Melody\", was rediscovered in the US Library of Congress. His theories on the mathematics of bell manufacturing (using \"Radical Numbers\") are yet to be clearly understood.\nOne of the controversial claims of his last years was that of being able to build a land clock more accurate than any competing design. Specifically, he claimed to have designed a clock capable of keeping accurate time to within one second over a span of 100 days. At the time, such publications as \"The London Review of English and Foreign Literature\" ridiculed Harrison for what was considered an outlandish claim. Harrison drew a design but never built such a clock himself, but in 1970 Martin Burgess, a Harrison expert and himself a clockmaker, studied the plans and endeavored to build the timepiece as drawn. He built two versions, dubbed Clock A and Clock B. Clock A became the Gurney Clock which was given to the city of Norwich in 1975, while Clock B lay unfinished in his workshop for decades until it was acquired in 2009 by Donald Saff. The completed Clock B was submitted to the National Maritime Museum in Greenwich for further study. It was found that Clock B could potentially meet Harrison's original claim, so the clock's design was carefully checked and adjusted. Finally, over a 100-day period from 6 January to 17 April 2015, Clock B was secured in a transparent case in the Royal Observatory and left to run untouched, apart from regular winding. Upon completion of the run, the clock was measured to have lost only 5/8 of a second, meaning Harrison's design was fundamentally sound. If we ignore the fact that this clock uses materials such as duraluminium and invar unavailable to Harrison, had it been built in 1762, the date of Harrison's testing of his H4, and run continuously since then without correction, it would now ( 2025) be slow by just minutes and second . Guinness World Records has declared Martin Burgess' Clock B the \"most accurate mechanical clock with a pendulum swinging in free air.\"\nIn literature, television, drama and music.\nIn 1995 inspired by a Harvard University symposium on the longitude problem organized by the National Association of Watch and Clock Collectors, Dava Sobel wrote a book about Harrison's work. \"Longitude: The True Story of a Lone Genius Who Solved the Greatest Scientific Problem of His Time\" became the first popular bestseller on the subject of horology. \"The Illustrated Longitude\", in which Sobel's text was accompanied by 180 images selected by William J. H. Andrewes, appeared in 1998. The book was dramatised for UK television by Charles Sturridge in a Granada Productions 4 episode series for Channel 4 in 1999, under the title \"Longitude\". It was broadcast in the US later in the same year by the co-producer A&amp;E. The production starred Michael Gambon as Harrison and Jeremy Irons as Gould. Sobel's book was the basis for a PBS NOVA episode entitled \"Lost at Sea: The Search for Longitude\".\nIn 1998 the British composer Harrison Birtwistle wrote the piano piece \"Harrison's clocks\" which contains musical depictions of Harrison's various clocks. The composer Peter Graham's piece \"Harrison's Dream\" is about Harrison's forty-year quest to produce an accurate clock. Graham worked simultaneously on the brass band and wind band versions of the piece, which received their first performances just four months apart in October 2000 and February 2001 respectively.\n\"John Harrison's Hands\", a https:// about the man and his work, was written by Brian McNeill and Dick Gaughan, and has been recorded by both artists and by Show of Hands.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

She is recognized for having brought French cuisine to the American public with her debut cookbook, \"Mastering the Art of French Cooking\", and her subsequent television programs, the most notable of which was \"The French Chef\", which premiered in 1963.\nEarly life.\nChild was born Julia Carolyn McWilliams in Pasadena, California, on August 15, 1912. Her father was John McWilliams Jr. (1880\u20131962), a Princeton University graduate and prominent land manager, and her mother was Julia Carolyn (\"Caro\") Weston (1877\u20131937), a paper-company heiress and daughter of Byron Curtis Weston, a lieutenant governor of Massachusetts. She was the eldest of three, followed by a brother, John McWilliams III, and sister, Dorothy Cousins.\nChild attended Polytechnic School and Westridge School from 4th grade to 9th grade in Pasadena, California. In high school, she was sent to the Katherine Branson School in Ross, California, which was at the time a boarding school. As a youth, she played tennis, golf, and basketball.\nChild also played sports while attending Smith College in Northampton, Massachusetts, from which she graduated in 1934 with a major in history. At the time she graduated, she planned to become a novelist, or perhaps a magazine writer. Following her graduation from college, Child moved to New York City, where she worked for a time as a copywriter for the advertising department of W. &amp; J. Sloane. She was still hoping to become a novelist. Child joined the Junior League of Pasadena in 1935 after returning home from college. While a member, she contributed to the League's magazine and helped create children's plays.\nWhile Child grew up in a family with a cook, she did not observe or learn cooking from this person, and she would not learn until she met her husband-to-be, Paul, who grew up in a family very interested in food.\nCareer.\nSecond World War.\nChild joined the Office of Strategic Services (OSS) in 1942 after finding that at , she was too tall to enlist in the Women's Army Corps (WACs) or in the U.S. Navy's WAVES. She began her OSS career as a typist at its headquarters in Washington, D.C., but, because of her education and experience, soon was given a position as a top-secret researcher working directly for the head of OSS, General William J. Donovan.\nAs a research assistant in the Secret Intelligence division, Child typed over 10,000 names on white note cards to keep track of officers. For a year, she worked at the OSS Emergency Sea Rescue Equipment Section (ESRES) in Washington, D.C. as a file clerk and then as an assistant to developers of a shark repellent needed to ensure that sharks would not explode ordnance targeting German U-boats. When Child was asked to solve the problem of too many OSS underwater explosives being set off by curious sharks, \"Child's solution was to experiment with cooking various concoctions as a shark repellent,\" which were sprinkled in the water near the explosives and repelled sharks. Still in use today, the experimental shark repellent \"marked Child's first foray into the world of cooking.\"\nDuring 1944\u20131945, Child was posted to Kandy, Ceylon (now Sri Lanka), where her responsibilities included \"registering, cataloging and channeling a great volume of highly classified communications\" for the OSS's clandestine stations in Asia. She was later posted to Kunming, China, where she received the Emblem of Meritorious Civilian Service as head of the Registry of the OSS Secretariat.\nFor her service, Child received an award that cited her many virtues, including her \"drive and inherent cheerfulness\". As with other OSS records, her file was declassified in 2008. Unlike other files, Child's complete file is available online.\nWhile she was in Kandy, she met Paul Cushing Child, who was also an OSS employee. The two later married on September 1, 1946, in Lumberville, Pennsylvania, later moving to a house in the Georgetown neighborhood of Washington, D.C. Paul, a New Jersey native who had lived in Paris as an artist and poet, was known for his sophisticated palate and had introduced his wife to fine cuisine. He joined the United States Foreign Service, and, in 1948, the couple moved to Paris after the State Department assigned Paul there as an exhibits officer with the United States Information Agency. The couple had no children.\nPostwar France.\nChild repeatedly recalled her first meal at La Couronne in Rouen as a culinary revelation. Once, she had described the meal of oysters, sole meuni\u00e8re, and fine wine to \"The New York Times\" as \"an opening up of the soul and spirit for me.\" In 1951, she graduated from the famous Cordon Bleu cooking school in Paris and later studied privately with Max Bugnard and other master chefs. She joined the women's cooking club \"Le Cercle des Gourmettes\", through which she met Simone Beck, who was writing a French cookbook for Americans with her friend Louisette Bertholle. Beck proposed that Child work with them to make the book appeal to Americans. In 1951, Child, Beck, and Bertholle began to teach cooking to American women in Child's Paris kitchen, calling their informal school \"L'\u00e9cole des trois gourmandes\" (The School of the Three Food Lovers). For the next decade, as the Childs moved around Europe and finally to Cambridge, Massachusetts, the three researched and repeatedly tested recipes. Child translated the French into English, making the recipes detailed, interesting, and practical.\nIn 1963, the Childs built a home near the Provence town of Plascassier in the hills above Cannes on property belonging to co-author Beck and her husband, Jean Fischbacher. The Childs named it \"La\u00a0Pitchoune\", a Proven\u00e7al word meaning \"the little one\", but over time the property was often affectionately called simply \"La Peetch\".\nIn his \"New York Times\" best-selling book, \"Dearie: The Remarkable Life of Julia Child\", author Bob Spitz stated that Child was diagnosed with breast cancer in the mid-1960s. She underwent a mastectomy on February 28, 1968.\nMedia career.\nThe three would-be authors initially signed a contract with publisher Houghton Mifflin, which later rejected the manuscript for seeming too much like an encyclopedia. When it was finally published in 1961 by Alfred A. Knopf, the 726-page \"Mastering the Art of French Cooking\" was a best-seller and received critical acclaim that derived in part from the American interest in French culture in the early 1960s. Lauded for its helpful illustrations and precise attention to detail, and for making fine cuisine accessible, the book is still in print and is considered a seminal culinary work. Following this success, Child wrote magazine articles and a regular column for \"The Boston Globe\" newspaper. She would go on to publish nearly twenty titles under her name and with others. Many, though not all, were related to her television shows. Her last book was the autobiographical \"My Life in France\", published posthumously in 2006 and written with her grandnephew, Alex Prud'homme. The book recounts Child's life with her husband, Paul Cushing Child, in postwar France.\n\"The French Chef\" and related books.\nA 1961 appearance on a book review show on what was then the National Educational Television (NET) station of Boston, WGBH-TV (now a major Public Broadcasting Service station), led to the inception of her first television cooking show after viewers enjoyed her demonstration of how to cook an omelette. \"The French Chef\" debuted as a summer pilot series, on July 26, 1962. This led to the program becoming a regular series, beginning on February 11, 1963, on WGBH, where it was immediately successful. The show ran nationally for ten years and won Peabody and Emmy Awards, including the first Emmy award for an educational program. Though she was not the first television cook, Child was the most widely seen. She attracted the broadest audience with her cheery enthusiasm, distinctively warbly voice, and unpatronizing, unaffected manner. In 1972, \"The French Chef\" became the first television program to be captioned for the deaf, using the preliminary technology of open-captioning.\nChild's second book, \"The French Chef Cookbook,\" was a collection of the recipes she had demonstrated on the show. It was soon followed in 1970 by \"Mastering the Art of French Cooking, Volume Two,\" again in collaboration with Simone Beck, but not with Louisette Bertholle, with whom the professional relationship had ended. Child's fourth book, \"From Julia Child's Kitchen,\" was illustrated with her husband's photographs and documented the color series of \"The French Chef,\" as well as an extensive library of kitchen notes compiled by Child during the course of the show.\nImpact on American households.\nChild had a large impact on American households and housewives. Because of the technology in the 1960s, the show was unedited, causing her blunders to appear in the final version and ultimately lend \"authenticity and approachability to television.\" According to Toby Miller in \"Screening Food: French Cuisine and the Television Palate,\" one mother he spoke to said that sometimes \"all that stood between me and insanity was hearty Julia Child\" because of Child's ability to soothe and transport her. In addition, Miller notes that Child's show began before the feminist movement of the 1960s, which meant that the issues housewives and women faced were somewhat ignored on television.\nLater career.\nIn the 1970s and 1980s, she was the star of numerous television programs, including \"Julia Child &amp; Company\", \"Julia Child &amp; More Company\", and \"Dinner at Julia's\". For the 1979 book \"Julia Child and More Company\", she won a National Book Award in category Current Interest. In 1980, Child started appearing regularly on ABC's \"Good Morning America\".\nIn 1981, she founded the American Institute of Wine &amp; Food, with vintners Robert Mondavi and Richard Graff, and others, to \"advance the understanding, appreciation and quality of wine and food,\" a pursuit she had already begun with her books and television appearances. In 1989, she published what she considered her magnum opus, a book and instructional video series collectively entitled \"The Way To Cook\".\nDuring the AIDS crisis of the 1980s, Child went from holding homophobic views to being a passionate AIDS activist, triggered by a close associate succumbing to AIDS.\nIn the mid-1990s, as part of her work with the American Institute of Wine and Food, Child became increasingly concerned about children's food education.\nShe starred in four more series in the 1990s that featured guest chefs: \"Cooking with Master Chefs\", \"In Julia's Kitchen with Master Chefs\", \"Baking with Julia\", and \"Julia &amp; Jacques Cooking at Home\". She collaborated with Jacques P\u00e9pin many times for television programs and cookbooks. All of Child's books during this time stemmed from the television series of the same names.\nChild's use of ingredients like butter and cream has been questioned by food critics and modern-day nutritionists. She addressed these criticisms throughout her career, predicting that a \"fanatical fear of food\" would take over the country's dining habits, and that focusing too much on nutrition takes the pleasure from enjoying food. In a 1990 interview, Child said, \"Everybody is overreacting. If fear of food continues, it will be the death of gastronomy in the United States. Fortunately, the French don't suffer from the same hysteria we do. We should enjoy food and have fun. It is one of the simplest and nicest pleasures in life.\"\nJulia Child's kitchen, designed by her husband, was the setting for three of her television shows. It is now on display at the National Museum of American History in Washington, D.C. Beginning with \"In Julia's Kitchen with Master Chefs,\" the Childs' home kitchen in Cambridge was fully transformed into a functional set, with TV-quality lighting, three cameras positioned to catch all angles in the room, and a massive center island with a gas stovetop on one side and an electric stovetop on the other, but leaving the rest of the Childs' appliances alone, including \"my wall oven with its squeaking door.\" This kitchen backdrop hosted nearly all of Child's 1990s television series.\nLater years.\nAfter her friend Simone Beck died in 1991 at the age of 87, Child relinquished La Pitchoune after a month-long stay in June 1992 with her family, her niece, Phila, and close friend and biographer No\u00ebl Riley Fitch. She turned the keys over to Jean Fischbacher's sister, just as she and Paul had promised nearly 30 years earlier. That year, Child spent five days in Sicily at the invitation of Regaleali Winery. American journalist Bob Spitz spent a brief time with Child during that period while he was researching and writing his work then titled \"History of Eating and Cooking in America\". In 1993, Child voiced Dr. Juliet Bleeb in the animated film, \"We're Back! A Dinosaur's Story\".\nSpitz took notes and made many recordings of his conversations with Child, and these later formed the basis of a secondary biography of Child, published August 7, 2012 (Knopf), five days before the centennial of her birth. Paul Child, who was ten years older than his wife, died in 1994 after living in a nursing home for five years following a series of strokes.\nIn 2001, Child moved to a retirement community, donating her house and office to Smith College, which later sold the house.\nShe donated her kitchen, which her husband had designed with high counters to accommodate her height, and which served as the set for three of her television series, to the Smithsonian's National Museum of American History, where it is now on display. Her copper pots and pans were on display at Copia in Napa, California, until August 2009 when they were reunited with her kitchen at the National Museum of American History in Washington, D.C.\nDeath.\nChild died of kidney failure in Montecito, California, on August 13, 2004, two days before her 92nd birthday. She ended her last book, \"My Life in France\", with \"...\u00a0thinking back on it now reminds that the pleasures of the table, and of life, are infinite\u00a0\u2014 toujours bon app\u00e9tit!\"\nLegacy.\nThe Julia Child Foundation.\nIn 1995, Child established The Julia Child Foundation for Gastronomy and Culinary Arts, a private charitable foundation to make grants to further her life's work. The Foundation, originally set up in Massachusetts, later moved to Santa Barbara, California, where it is now headquartered. Inactive until after Julia's death in 2004, the Foundation makes grants to other nonprofits. The grants support primarily gastronomy, the culinary arts, and the further development of the professional food world, all matters of paramount importance to Julia Child during her lifetime. The Foundation's website provides a dedicated page listing the names of grant recipients with a description of the organization and the grant provided by the Foundation. One of the grant recipients is Heritage Radio Network which covers the world of food, drink, and agriculture.\nBeyond making grants, the Foundation was also established to protect Child's legacy and intellectual property rights. Many of these rights are jointly held with other organizations like her publishers and the Schlesinger Library at The Radcliffe Institute at Harvard University. The Foundation has been active in protecting these posthumous rights. Child was opposed to endorsements, and the Foundation follows a similar policy regarding the use of her name and image for commercial purposes.\nTributes and homages.\nThe Julia Child rose, known in the UK as the \"Absolutely Fabulous\" rose, is a golden butter/gold floribunda rose named after Child.\nThe exhibits in the West Wing (1 West) of the National Museum of American History address science and innovation. They include \"Bon App\u00e9tit! Julia Child's Kitchen.\"\nOn September 26, 2014, the U.S. Postal Service issued 20 million copies of the \"Celebrity Chefs Forever\" stamp series, which featured portraits by Jason Seiler of five American chefs: Child, Joyce Chen, James Beard, Edna Lewis, and Felipe Rojas-Lombardi.\n Smith College used the proceeds from the sale of Child's house in Cambridge to partially fund an architecturally dramatic campus center that opened in 2003. On November 17, 2022, it honored her by naming it the Julia McWilliams Child '34 Campus Center.\nAwards and nominations.\nOn November 19, 2000, Child was made a Knight of France's Legion of Honor. She was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 2000. She was awarded the U.S. Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2003. She received honorary doctorates from Harvard University, Johnson &amp; Wales University (1995), Smith College (her alma mater), Brown University (2000), and several others. In 2007, Child was inducted into the National Women's Hall of Fame.\nIn popular culture.\nChild was a favorite of audiences from the moment of her television debut on public television in 1963, and she was a familiar part of American culture and the subject of numerous references, including numerous parodies in television and radio programs and skits. Her great success on air may have been tied to her refreshingly pragmatic approach to the genre, \"I think you have to decide who your audience is. If you don't pick your audience, you're lost because you're not really talking to anybody. My audience is people who like to cook, who want to really learn how to do it.\"\nIn 1996, Child was ranked No. 46 on TV Guide's 50 Greatest TV Stars of All Time.\nBooks about Child.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "16442", "revid": "24902", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=16442", "title": "James Beard", "text": "American chef (1903\u20131985)\nJames Andrews Beard (May 5, 1903\u00a0\u2013 January 21, 1985) was an American chef, cookbook author, teacher and television personality. He pioneered television cooking shows, taught at The James Beard Cooking School in New York City and Seaside, Oregon, and lectured widely. He emphasized American cooking, prepared with fresh and wholesome American ingredients, to a country just becoming aware of its own culinary heritage. Beard taught and mentored generations of professional chefs and food enthusiasts. He published more than twenty books, and his memory is honored by his foundation's annual James Beard Awards.\nEarly life and education.\nFamily.\nJames Andrews Beard was born in Portland, Oregon, on May 5, 1903, to Elizabeth and John Beard. His British-born mother operated the Gladstone Hotel, and his father worked at the city's customs house. The family vacationed on the Pacific coast in Gearhart, Oregon.\nBeard's earliest memory of food was at the 1905 Lewis and Clark Exposition, when he was two years old. In his memoir he recalled:\nI was taken to the exposition two or three times. The thing that remained in my mind above all others\u2014I think it marked my life\u2014was watching Triscuits and shredded wheat biscuits being made. Isn't that crazy? At two years old that memory was made. It intrigued the hell out of me.\nAt age three Beard was bedridden with malaria, and the illness gave him time to focus on the food prepared by his mother and Jue-Let, the family's Chinese cook. According to Beard he was raised by Jue-Let and Thema, his Chinese nanny, who instilled in him a passion for Chinese culture. Beard reportedly \"[attributed] much of his upbringing to Jue-Let,\" whom he referred to as his Chinese godfather.\nEducation.\nBeard graduated from Portland's Washington High School in 1920. In the same year he briefly attended Reed College in Portland, Oregon. He was expelled for homosexuality in 1922, having had relationships with \"one or more male students and a professor.\" The college granted Beard an honorary degree in 1976.\nAfter leaving Reed, he traveled from Portland to Liverpool aboard a British freighter, spending subsequent years living and traveling in Europe. In 1923, he joined a theatrical troupe and studied voice and theater. He also spent time in Paris, where he experienced French cuisine at its bistros and central market, Les Halles. In France, he also had the opportunity to enjoy sexual freedom, having a short relationship with a young man. From this period and the widespread influence of French food culture, he became a Francophile. In 1927 he returned to the US, spending time in Portland, Hollywood, and New York attempting to start a career in acting, costume and set design, and radio.\nCareer.\nBeard moved to New York City in 1937. Unlucky in the theater, he and friend Bill Rhodes capitalized on the cocktail party craze by opening Hors d'Oeuvre, Inc., a catering company. This led to lecturing, teaching, writing, and the realization \"that part of his mission [as a food connoisseur] was to defend the pleasure of real cooking and fresh ingredients against the assault of the Jell-O-mold people and the domestic scientists.\" He published his first cookbook in 1940: \"Hors D'Oeuvre and Canap\u00e9s\", a compilation of his catering recipes. According to fellow cooking enthusiast Julia Child, this book put him on the culinary map.\nWorld War II rationing ended Beard's catering business. He enlisted in the Army and was trained as a cryptographic specialist. Because he had hoped to serve in the hotel management division of the Army Quartermaster Corps, he sought and obtained release from the Army in 1943 based on a regulation applying to men over age 38.\nFrom August 1946 to May 1947, he hosted \"I Love to Eat\", a live television cooking show on NBC, beginning his ascent as an American food authority.\nIn 1952, when Helen Evans Brown published her \"Helen Brown's West Coast Cook Book\", Beard wrote her a letter igniting a friendship that lasted until Brown's death. The two, along with her husband Phillip, developed a friendship which was both professional and personal. Beard and Brown became like siblings, admonishing and encouraging each other, as well as collaborating.\nAccording to the James Beard Foundation website, \"In 1955, he established The James Beard Cooking School. He continued to teach cooking to men and women for the next thirty years, both at his own schools (in New York City and Seaside, Oregon), and around the country at women's clubs, other cooking schools, and civic groups. He was a tireless traveler, bringing his message of good food, honestly prepared with fresh, wholesome, American ingredients, to a country just becoming aware of its own culinary heritage.\"\nBeard brought French cooking to the American middle and upper classes during the 1950s, appearing on TV as a cooking personality. David Kamp (who discusses Beard at length in his book, \"The United States of Arugula\") noted that Beard's was the first cooking show on TV. He compares Dione Lucas' cooking show and school with Beard's, noting that their prominence during the 1950s marked the emergence of a sophisticated, New York-based, nationally and internationally known food culture. Kamp wrote, \"It was in this decade [the 1950s] that Beard made his name as \"James Beard\", the brand name, the face and belly of American gastronomy.\" He noted that Beard met Alice B. Toklas on a trip to Paris, indicative of the network of fellow food celebrities who would follow him during his life and carry on his legacy after his death.\nBeard made endorsement deals to promote products that he might not have otherwise used or suggested in his own cuisine, including Omaha Steaks, French's Mustard, Green Giant Corn Niblets, Old Crow bourbon, Planters Peanuts, Shasta soft drinks, DuPont chemicals, and Adolph's Meat Tenderizer. According to Kamp, Beard later felt himself a \"gastronomic whore\" for doing so. Although he felt that mass-produced food that was neither fresh, local nor seasonal was a betrayal of his gastronomic beliefs, he needed the money for his cooking schools. According to Thomas McNamee, \"Beard, a man of stupendous appetites\u2014for food, sex, money, you name it\u2014stunned his subtler colleagues.\" In 1981, Beard and friend Gael Greene founded Citymeals-on-Wheels, which continues to help feed the homebound elderly in New York City.\nPersonal life.\nBeard was gay. According to Beard's memoir, \"By the time I was seven, I knew that I was gay. I think it's time to talk about that now.\" Beard came out in 1981, in \"Delights and Prejudices\", a revised version of his memoir. Of Beard's \"most significant romantic attachments\" was his \"lifetime companion\" of thirty years, Gino Cofacci, who was given an apartment in Beard's townhouse in the will and died in 1989, and Beard's former cooking school assistant Carl Jerome. John Birdsall, a food writer who won two James Beard Awards, ties Beard's sexuality to his food aesthetics, and said in 2016 it was only recently that people are accepting the connection.\nDeath.\nJames Beard died of heart failure on January 21, 1985, at his home in New York City at age 81. He was cremated and his ashes scattered over the beach in Gearhart, Oregon, where he spent summers as a child.\nIn 1995, \"Love and Kisses and a Halo of Truffles: Letters from Helen Evans Brown\" was published. It contained excerpts from Beard's bi-weekly correspondence from 1952 to 1964 with friend and fellow chef Helen Evans Brown. The book gave insight to their relationship as well as the way that they developed ideas for recipes, projects and food.\nFoundation.\nAfter Beard's death in 1985, Julia Child wanted to preserve his home in New York City as the gathering place that it had been during his life. Peter Kump, a former student of Beard's and the founder of the Institute of Culinary Education (formerly Peter Kump's New York Cooking School), spearheaded efforts to purchase the house and create the James Beard Foundation.\nBeard's renovated brownstone at 167 West 12th Street in Greenwich Village, is North America's only historic culinary center. It is preserved as a gathering place where the press and general public could appreciate the talents of emerging and established chefs.\nIn 1986, the James Beard Foundation was established in Beard's honor to provide scholarships to aspiring food professionals and champion the American culinary tradition which Beard helped create. \"Since its inception in 1991, the James Beard Foundation Scholarship Program has awarded over $4.6\u00a0million in financial aid to a variety of students\u2014from recent high school graduates, to working culinary professionals, to career changers. Recipients come from many countries, and enhance their knowledge at schools around the world.\"\nThe annual James Beard Foundation Award celebrate fine cuisine around Beard's birthday. Held on the first Monday in May, the awards ceremony honors American chefs, restaurants, journalists, cookbook authors, restaurant designers and electronic-media professionals. It culminates in a reception featuring tastings of signature dishes of more than 30 of the foundation's chefs. A quarterly magazine, \"Beard House\", is a compendium of culinary journalism.\nThe foundation was affected by scandals; in 2004 its head, Leonard Pickell, resigned and was imprisoned for grand larceny and in 2005 the board of trustees resigned. During this period, chef and writer Anthony Bourdain called the foundation \"a kind of benevolent shakedown operation.\" A new board of trustees instituted an ethics policy and chose a new president, Susan Ungaro, to prevent future problems.\nWorks.\nArchival collection.\nThe James Beard Papers are housed in the Fales Library at New York University.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He was the first African-American writer to win the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction, and was included among the first group of artists who received a MacArthur Fellowship. At the time of his death, McPherson was a professor emeritus of fiction at the Iowa Writers' Workshop.\nLife and work.\nEarly life and education.\nMcPherson was born in Savannah, Georgia, on September 16, 1943, the second of four children. His father was a master electrician (the first African-American so recognized in Georgia), and his mother (born Mabel Small) was a maid. While McPherson was growing up, his father struggled with alcohol and spent time in jail. In the essay \"Going Up To Atlanta,\" McPherson describes the many odd jobs he took on during this time to help support his mother, brother, and sisters. But it was his discovery of the \"colored branch\" of the public library that changed his life. When he started reading books, McPherson learned that words, even without pictures, \"gave up their secret meanings, spoke of other worlds, made me know that pain was a part of other people's lives.\"\nHe attended Morgan State University from 1963 to 1964 before receiving his undergraduate degree in history and English from Morris Brown College in 1965. In 1968, McPherson received a LL.B. from Harvard Law School, where he partially financed his studies by working as a janitor.\nWhile at Harvard, McPherson studied fiction writing with Alan Lebowitz in 1967 and worked on his stories when he found some spare time. It was the publication of his short story \"Gold Coast\" in \"The Atlantic Monthly\", following an \"open reading\" competition they had sponsored, that first brought him public recognition. During this period, McPherson established a close working relationship with Edward Weeks, an editor at \"The Atlantic Monthly,\" which led to McPherson becoming a contributing editor at that magazine in 1969. His fiction would go on to appear in numerous journals and magazines throughout the following decade. Many of his stories were anthologized, beginning with \"Gold Coast\" when it appeared in \"The Best American Stories\" in 1969. His first collection of short stories, \"Hue and Cry\", was published by Atlantic Monthly Press that year.\nIn 1971, he received an M.F.A. in fiction from the Iowa Writers' Workshop, where he studied briefly with the short-story writer and novelist Richard Yates. While studying creative writing, McPherson decided not to practice law; however, he would continue to utilize his legal training in various projects. In a 1972 \"Atlantic Monthly\" essay, he exposed exploitative business practices against black homeowners, presaging the later work of Ta-Nehisi Coates.\nDuring this period in his life, he gained the attention of Ralph Ellison (1913\u20131994), who became both a friend and mentor to the young McPherson. In December 1970, McPherson interviewed Ellison for an \"Atlantic Monthly\" cover story and collaborated with him on the essay \"Invisible Man.\" This relationship with Ellison would have a lasting influence on his own life and work, as McPherson acknowledges in his essay \"Gravitas,\" which he published in 1999 as both a tribute to the (then) recently deceased writer, and to observe the posthumous publication of Ellison's novel \"Juneteenth\" that same year. McPherson also initiated a friendship with Albert Murray shortly after the publication of Murray's \"The Omni-Americans: Black Experience &amp; American Culture\" (1970).\nCareer.\nMcPherson taught English and creative writing at the University of California, Santa Cruz (assistant professor; 1969\u20131971), the Harvard University summer school (1972), Morgan State University (assistant professor; 1975\u20131976) and the University of Virginia (associate professor; 1976\u20131981) before joining the Iowa Writers' Workshop in 1981, with whom he was associated for the remainder of his life. He served as acting director of the program for two years following the death of Frank Conroy in 2005. Following the publication of \"Elbow Room\" (his final collection of fiction) in 1977, McPherson primarily focused on his teaching career, with the \"Chicago Tribune\" characterizing him as being \"only slightly more gregarious than J.D. Salinger.\"\nHe was also a visiting scholar at Yale Law School (1978\u20131979) and a fellow at Stanford University's Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences (1997\u20131998; 2002\u20132003). Significantly, McPherson lectured in Japan (at Meiji University and Chiba University), a country whose society and culture profoundly affected him. It was in Japan, he once wrote, where he went to lay down \"the burden carried by all black Americans, especially the males.\"\n\"Crabcakes: A Memoir\", his first original work since \"Elbow Room\", was published in 1998. His final book (\"A Region Not Home: Reflections on Exile\", an essay collection) was published in 2000.\nRecognition.\nIn 1972, McPherson was awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship. He received the Pulitzer Prize in 1978 for his short story collection \"Elbow Room\", becoming the first black writer to receive the program's Fiction Prize.\nHe was the recipient of a MacArthur Fellowship in 1981, a member of the first group (21 recipients in all) ever selected for one of the MacArthur Foundation's so-called \"genius grants.\" In 1995, McPherson was inducted into the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. In 2000, John Updike selected McPherson's short story \"Gold Coast\" for his collection \"Best American Short Stories of the Century\" (Houghton Mifflin).\nIn October 2011, McPherson was honored as the inaugural recipient of the Paul Engle Award from the Iowa City UNESCO City of Literature. According to the citation:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The \"Engle Award\" honors an individual who, like Engle, longtime director of the Iowa Writers' Workshop and co-founder of the International Writing Program at the University of Iowa, represents a pioneering spirit in the world of literature through writing, editing, publishing, or teaching, and whose active participation in the larger issues of the day has contributed to the betterment of the world through the literary arts.In 2020, an Iowa City park was renovated and renamed after McPherson. Previously Creekside Park, James Alan McPherson Park serves as a memorial and a gathering space for the community.\nDeath.\nMcPherson died in hospice on July 27, 2016, in Iowa City, Iowa, due to complications of pneumonia. He was 72. He is survived by a daughter, Rachel McPherson (a child from his first marriage to the former Sarah Charlton, which had ended in divorce); a son from another relationship, Benjamin Miyamoto; a sister; and a brother.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Jerome", "text": "English writer and humorist (1859\u20131927)\nJerome Klapka Jerome (2 May 1859 \u2013 14 June 1927) was an English writer and humorist, best known for the comic travelogue \"Three Men in a Boat\" (1889). Other works include the essay collections \"Idle Thoughts of an Idle Fellow\" (1886) and \"Second Thoughts of an Idle Fellow\"; \"Three Men on the Bummel\", a sequel to \"Three Men in a Boat\"; and several other novels.\nJerome was born in Walsall, England, and, although he was able to attend grammar school, his family suffered from poverty at times, as did he as a young man trying to earn a living in various occupations. In his twenties, he was able to publish some work, and success followed. He married in 1888, and the honeymoon was spent on a boat on the River Thames; he published \"Three Men in a Boat\" soon afterwards. He continued to write fiction, non-fiction and plays over the next few decades, though never with the same level of success.\nEarly life.\nJerome was born at Belsize House, 1 Caldmore Road, in Caldmore, Walsall, England. He was the fourth child of Marguerite Jones and Jerome Clapp (who later renamed himself Jerome Clapp Jerome), an ironmonger and lay preacher who dabbled in architecture. He had two sisters, Paulina and Blandina, and one brother, Milton, who died at an early age. Jerome was registered as Jerome Clapp Jerome, like his father's amended name, and the Klapka appears to be a later variation (after the exiled Hungarian general Gy\u00f6rgy Klapka). The family fell into poverty owing to bad investments in the local mining industry, and debt collectors visited often, an experience that Jerome described vividly in his autobiography \"My Life and Times\" (1926). At the age of two Jerome moved with his parents to Stourbridge, Worcestershire, then later to east London.\nThe young Jerome attended St Marylebone Grammar School. He wished to go into politics or be a Man of Letters, but the death of his father when Jerome was 13 and of his mother when he was 15 forced him to quit his studies and find work to support himself. He was employed at the London and North Western Railway, initially collecting coal that fell along the railway, and he remained there for four years.\nActing career and early literary works.\nJerome was inspired by his elder sister Blandina's love for the theatre, and he decided to try his hand at acting in 1877, under the stage name Harold Crichton. He joined a repertory theatre troupe that produced plays on a shoestring budget, often drawing on the actors' own meagre resources\u2014Jerome was penniless at the time\u2014to purchase costumes and props. After three years on the road with no evident success, the 21-year-old Jerome decided that he had had enough of stage life and sought other occupations. He tried to become a journalist, writing essays, satires, and short stories, but most of these were rejected. Over the next few years, he was a school teacher, a packer, and a solicitor's clerk. Finally, in 1885, he had some success with \"On the Stage\u2014and Off\" (1885), a comic memoir of his experiences with the acting troupe, followed by \"Idle Thoughts of an Idle Fellow\" (1886), a collection of humorous essays which had previously appeared in the newly founded magazine, \"Home Chimes\", the same magazine that would later serialise \"Three Men in a Boat\".\nOn 21 June 1888, Jerome married Georgina Elizabeth Henrietta Stanley Marris (\"Ettie\"), nine days after she divorced her first husband. She had a daughter from her previous five-year marriage nicknamed Elsie (her actual name was also Georgina). The honeymoon took place on the River Thames \"in a little boat,\" a fact that was to have a significant influence on his next and most important work, \"Three Men in a Boat\".\n\"Three Men in a Boat\" and later career.\nJerome sat down to write \"Three Men in a Boat\" as soon as the couple returned from their honeymoon. In the novel, his wife was replaced by his longtime friends George Wingrave (George) and Carl Hentschel (Harris). This allowed him to create comic (and non-sentimental) situations which were nonetheless intertwined with the history of the Thames region. The book, published in 1889, became an instant success and has never been out of print. Its popularity was such that the number of registered Thames boats went up fifty per cent in the year following its publication, and it contributed significantly to the Thames becoming a tourist attraction. In its first twenty years alone, the book sold over a million copies worldwide. It has been adapted into films, television, radio shows, stage plays, and even a musical. Its writing style has influenced many humourists and satirists in England and elsewhere.\nWith the financial security that the sales of the book provided, Jerome was able to dedicate all of his time to writing. He wrote a number of plays, essays, and novels, but was never able to recapture the success of \"Three Men in a Boat\". In 1892, he was chosen by Robert Barr to edit \"The Idler\" (over Rudyard Kipling). The magazine was an illustrated satirical monthly catering to gentlemen (who, following the theme of the publication, appreciated idleness). In 1893, he founded \"To-Day\", but had to withdraw from both publications because of financial difficulties and a libel suit.\nJerome's play \"Biarritz\" had a run of two months at the Prince of Wales Theatre between April and June 1896.\nIn 1898, a short stay in Germany inspired \"Three Men on the Bummel\", the sequel to \"Three Men in a Boat\", reintroducing the same characters in the setting of a foreign bicycle tour. The book was nonetheless unable quite to recapture the sheer comic energy and historic rootedness of its celebrated predecessor (lacking as it does the unifying thread that is the river Thames itself) and it has enjoyed only modest success by comparison. However, some of the individual comic vignettes that make up \"Bummel\" have been praised as highly as those of \"Boat\".\nIn 1902, he published the novel \"Paul Kelver\", which is widely regarded as autobiographical. His 1908 play \"The Passing of the Third Floor Back\" introduced a more sombre and religious Jerome. The main character was played by one of the leading actors of the time, Johnston Forbes-Robertson, and the play was a tremendous commercial success. It was twice made into film, in 1918 and in 1935. However, the play was condemned by critics; Max Beerbohm described it as \"vilely stupid\" and as written by a \"tenth-rate writer\".\nFirst World War and last years.\nJerome volunteered to serve his country at the outbreak of the First World War, but being 55 years old, he was rejected by the British Army. Eager to serve in some capacity, he volunteered as an ambulance driver for the French Army. In 1926, Jerome published his autobiography, \"My Life and Times\". Shortly afterwards, the Borough of Walsall conferred on him the title Freeman of the Borough. During these last years, Jerome spent more time at his farmhouse Gould's Grove south-east of Ewelme near Wallingford.\nJerome suffered a paralytic stroke and a cerebral haemorrhage in June 1927, on a motoring tour from Devon to London via Cheltenham and Northampton. He lay in Northampton General Hospital for two weeks before dying on 14 June. He was cremated at Golders Green Crematorium and his ashes buried at St Mary's Church, Ewelme, Oxfordshire. Elsie, Ettie and his sister Blandina are buried beside him. His gravestone reads \"For we are labourers together with God\". A small museum dedicated to his life and works was opened in 1984 at his birth home in Walsall, but it closed in 2008 and the contents were returned to Walsall Museum.\nBibliography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He is known for being the first to isolate epinephrine in 1901.\nEarly life and education.\nTakamine was born in Takaoka, Toyama Prefecture, in November 1854. His father was a doctor; his mother a member of a family of \"sake\" brewers. He spent his childhood in Kanazawa, capital of present-day Ishikawa Prefecture in central Honsh\u016b. He learned English as a child from a Dutch family in Nagasaki, and so always spoke English with a Dutch accent. He was educated in Osaka, Kyoto, and Tokyo, graduating from one of the predecessors of Tokyo Imperial University in 1879. He did postgraduate work at University of Glasgow and Anderson College in Scotland until 1883.\nCareer.\nJapan.\nIn 1883, Takamine returned to Japan and joined the division of chemistry at the newly established Department of Agriculture and Commerce until 1887. He then founded the Tokyo Artificial Fertilizer Company, where he later isolated the enzyme takadiastase, an enzyme that catalyzes the breakdown of starch. Takamine developed his diastase from \"koji,\" a fungus used in the manufacture of soy sauce and \"miso\". Its Latin name is \"Aspergillus oryzae\", and it is a \"designated national fungus\" (\"kokkin\") in Japan.\nUnited States.\nIn 1884, Takamine went as co-commissioner of the World Cotton Centennial Exposition to New Orleans, where he met Lafcadio Hearn and 18 year old Caroline Field Hitch, his future wife. In 1885, he became the temporary Chief of the Japanese Patent Office and helped to lay the foundations of patent administration. He founded he Tokyo Artificial Fertilizer Company, importing large amounts of phosphate\nfrom Charleston, South Carolina. In 1890, he emigrated with his wife and two sons to Chicago. \nHe established his own research laboratory in New York City but licensed the exclusive production rights for takadiastase to one of the largest US pharmaceutical companies, Parke-Davis. This turned out to be a shrewd move as he became a millionaire in a relatively short time and by the early 20th century was estimated to be worth $30 million.\nIn 1894, Takamine applied for, and was granted, a US patent titled \"Process of Making Diastatic Enzyme\" (https://), the first patent on a microbial enzyme in the United States.\nIn 1901, he isolated and purified the hormone adrenaline, which became the first effective bronchodilator for asthma from animal glands, becoming the first to accomplish this for a glandular hormone. \nIn 1904, the Emperor Meiji of Japan honored Takamine with an unusual gift. In the context of the St. Louis World Fair (Louisiana Purchase Exposition), the Japanese government had replicated a historical Japanese structure, the \"Pine and Maple Palace\" (\"Shofu-den\"), modelled after the Kyoto Imperial Coronation Palace of 1,300 years ago. This structure was given to Dr. Takamine in grateful recognition of his efforts to further friendly relations between Japan and the United States. He had the structure transported in sections from Missouri to his summer home in upstate New York, seventy-five miles north of New York City. In 1909, the structure served as a guest house for Prince Kuni Kuniyoshi and Princess Kuni of Japan, who were visiting the area. Although the property was sold in 1922, the reconstructed structure remained in its serene setting. In 2008, it still continues to be one of the undervalued tourist attractions of New York's Sullivan County.\nIn 1905, Takamine founded the Nippon Club, which was for many years located at 161 West 93rd Street in Manhattan.\nTakamine devoted his life to maintaining goodwill between the US and Japan.\nIn 1912, the mayor of Tokyo (Yukio Ozaki) and Jokichi Takamine gifted cherry blossom trees, which were planted in the West Potomac Park surrounding the Tidal Basin in Washington, DC.\nA 1915 photo presents J\u014dkichi Takamine as the host for a banquet honoring the visiting Japanese diplomat Baron Eiichi Shibusawa. This illustration is linked to J\u014dkichi Takamine's involvement in the gifting of the cherry blossom trees to Washington, DC in 1912, which has evolved into the National Cherry Blossom Festival which is celebrated yearly.\nPersonal life.\nOn August 10, 1887, Takamine travelled to the US and married Caroline Field Hitch in New Orleans. They had two sons Jokichi Takamine, born 1888 in Tokyo, Japan, and Ebenezer Takashi Takamine born in 1889. The family emigrated to the US arriving in Chicago in December 1890. Due to her influence he converted to Catholicism. According to historical records, he would maintain this faith throughout his life.\nIn popular culture.\nAs of 2011, two films about the life of Takamine have been made by Toru Ichikawa. In the 2010 film \"Sakura, Sakura\" Takamine was portrayed by Masaya Kato. A sequel titled \"Takamine\", also directed by Ichikawa and starring Hatsunori Hasegawa, was released in 2011.\nAs of 2009, the Takamine home in Kanazawa could still be seen. It was relocated to near the grounds of Kanazawa Castle in 2001.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "16452", "revid": "40843939", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=16452", "title": "Jacob Neusner", "text": "American academic scholar of Judaism\nJacob Neusner (July 28, 1932 \u2013 October 8, 2016) was an American academic scholar of Judaism. He was named as one of the most published authors in history, having written or edited more than 900 books.\nNeusner's application of form criticism\u2014a methodology derived from scholars of the New Testament\u2014to Rabbinic texts was influential, but subject to criticism. Neusner's grasp of Rabbinic Hebrew and Aramaic has been challenged within academia.\nEarly life and study.\nNeusner was born in Hartford, Connecticut, to Reform Jewish parents. He graduated from William H. Hall High School in West Hartford. He then attended Harvard University, where he met Harry Austryn Wolfson and first encountered Jewish religious texts. After graduating from Harvard in 1953, Neusner spent a year at the University of Oxford.\nNeusner then attended the Jewish Theological Seminary of America, where he was ordained as a Conservative Jewish rabbi. After spending a year at Hebrew University of Jerusalem, he returned to the Jewish Theological Seminary and studied the Talmud under Saul Lieberman, who would later write a famous, and highly negative, critique of Neusner's translation of the Jerusalem Talmud. He graduated in 1960 with a master's degree. Later that year, he received a doctorate in religion from Columbia University.\nCareer.\nAfter his studies, Neusner briefly taught at Dartmouth College. Neusner also held positions at University of Wisconsin\u2013Milwaukee, Brandeis University, and Brown University. From 1990 to 2000 he was distinguished research professor at the University of South Florida.\nIn 1994, Neusner began teaching at Bard College, working there until 2014. While at Bard College, he founded the Institute for Advanced Theology with Bruce Chilton.\nHe was a life member of Clare Hall, Cambridge University. He was the only scholar to have served on both the National Endowment for the Humanities and the National Endowment for the Arts.\nNeusner died on October 8, 2016, at the age of 84.\nScholarship.\nNeusner's research centered on rabbinic Judaism of the Mishnaic and Talmudic eras. His work focused on bringing the study of rabbinical text into nonreligious educational institutions and treating them as non-religious documents.\nNeusner's five-volume \"History of the Jews in Babylonia\", published between 1965 and 1969, is said to be the first to consider the Babylonian Talmud in its Iranian context. Neusner studied Persian and Middle Persian to do so.\nNeusner, with his contemporaries, translated into English nearly the entire Rabbinic canon. This work has opened up many Rabbinic documents to scholars of other fields unfamiliar with Hebrew and Aramaic, within the academic study of religion, as well as in ancient history, culture and Near and Middle Eastern Studies.\nIn addition to his work on Rabbinic texts, Neusner was involved in Jewish Studies and Religious Studies. Neusner saw Judaism as \"not particular but exemplary, and Jews not as special but (merely) interesting.\"\nInterfaith work.\nNeusner also wrote a number of works exploring the relationship of Judaism to other religions. His \"A Rabbi Talks with Jesus\" attempts to establish a religiously sound framework for Judaic-Christian interchange. It earned the praise of Pope Benedict XVI and the nickname \"The Pope's Favorite Rabbi\". In his book \"Jesus of Nazareth,\" Benedict referred to it as \"by far the most important book for the Jewish-Christian dialogue in the last decade.\"\nPolitical views.\nNeusner called himself a Zionist, but also said \"Israel\u2019s flag is not mine. My homeland is America.\" He was culturally conservative, and opposed feminism and affirmative action.\nNeusner was a signer of the conservative Christian Cornwall Declaration on Environmental Stewardship, which expresses concern over what it called \"unfounded or undue concerns\" of environmentalists such as \"fears of destructive manmade global warming, overpopulation, and rampant species loss\".\nCritical assessment of Neusner's work.\nNeusner's original adoption of form criticism to the rabbinic texts proved highly influential both in North American and European studies of early Jewish and Christian texts. His later detailed studies of Mishnaic law lack the densely footnoted historical approach characteristic of his earlier work. As a result, these works, focusing on literary form, tend to ignore contemporary external sources and modern scholarship dealing with these issues. The irony was that his approach adopted the analytic methodology developed by Christian scholars for the New Testament, while denying there was any relationship between the Judeo-Christian corpus and rabbinic works, the latter being treated as isolates detached from their broader historical contexts.\nA number of scholars in his field of study were critical of this phase in his work.\nSome were critical of his methodology, and asserted that many of his arguments were circular or attempts to prove \"negative assumptions\" from a lack of evidence, while others concentrated on Neusner's reading and interpretations of Rabbinic texts, finding that his account was forced and inaccurate.\nNeusner's view that the Second Commonwealth Pharisees were a sectarian group centered on \"table fellowship\" and ritual food purity practices, and lacked interest in wider Jewish moral values or social issues, has been criticized by E. P. Sanders, Solomon Zeitlin and Hyam Maccoby.\nSome scholars questioned Neusner's grasp of Rabbinic Hebrew and Aramaic. The most famous and biting criticism came from one of Neusner's former teachers, Saul Lieberman, about Neusner's translation of the Jerusalem Talmud. Lieberman wrote, in an article circulated before his death and then published posthumously: \"...one begins to doubt the credibility of the translator [Neusner]. And indeed after a superficial perusal of the translation, the reader is stunned by the translator's ignorance of rabbinic Hebrew, of Aramaic grammar, and above all of the subject matter with which he deals.\" Ending his review, Lieberman states \"I conclude with a clear conscience: The right place for [Neusner's] English translation is the waste basket\" while at the same time qualifying that \"[i]n fairness to the translator I must add that his various essays on Jewish topics are meritorious. They abound in brilliant insights and intelligent questions.\" Lieberman highlights his criticism as being of Neusner's \"ignorance of the original languages,\" which Lieberman claims even Neusner was originally \"well aware of\" inasmuch as he had previously relied on responsible English renderings of rabbinic sources, e.g., Soncino Press, before later choosing to create his own renderings of rabbinic texts. Lieberman's views were seconded by Morton Smith, another teacher who resented Neusner's criticism of his views that Jesus was a homosexual magician.\nNeusner thought Lieberman's approach reflected the closed mentality of a yeshiva-based education that lacked familiarity with modern formal textual-critical techniques, and he eventually got round to replying to Lieberman's charges by writing in turn an equally scathing monograph entitled: \"Why There Never Was a Talmud of Caesarea: Saul Lieberman\u2019s Mistakes\" (1994). In it he attributed to Lieberman 'obvious errors of method, blunders in logic' and argued that Lieberman's work showed a systematic inability to accomplish critical research.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

His nickname was taken from King Nestor of Greek mythology.\nBiography.\nThe eldest son of John Cicero, Elector of Brandenburg, Joachim received an excellent education under the supervision of Dietrich von B\u00fclow, Bishop of Lebus and Chancellor of Frankfurt University. He became Elector of Brandenburg upon his father's death in January 1499, and soon afterwards married Elizabeth of Denmark, daughter of King John of Denmark in 1502. They had five children:\nJoachim took some part in the political complications of the Scandinavian kingdoms, but the early years of his reign were mainly spent in the administration of his electorate, where he succeeded in restoring some degree of order through stern measures. He also improved the administration of justice, aided the development of commerce, and was sympathetic to the needs to the towns. On the approach of the 1519 imperial election, Joachim's vote was eagerly solicited by the partisans of King Francis I of France, and Charles of Habsburg. Having treated with both parties, and received lavish promises from them, he appears to have hoped to be Emperor himself; but when the election came, he turned to the winning side and voted for Charles. In spite of this, relations between the Emperor and the Elector were not friendly, and during the next few years Joachim was frequently in communication with Charles' enemies.\nIn the course of Hohenzollern power politics Joachim Nestor and his brother managed to get the latter, Albert of Mainz, first onto the sees of Magdeburg and then its suffragan of Halberstadt, both prince-bishoprics also comprising princely territories. Since prince-episcopal sees were so influential, competing candidates usually ran for them. A candidature could turn into a bribery competition, without ever knowing exactly how much competitors paid to obtain office. The expenditures involved, as far as they exceeded one's own potential, were usually advanced by creditors and had then to be recovered by levying dues from the subjects and parishioners in the prince-bishoprics and dioceses that were just acquired. The acquisition in 1514 of the very influential Archbishopric-Electorate of Mainz for Albert was a coup that provided the Hohenzollerns with control over two of the seven electoral votes in imperial elections and many suffragan dioceses to levy dues.\nAccording to canon law, Albert was too young to hold such a position and since he would not give up the archiepiscopal see of Magdeburg (in order to terminate the accumulation of archdioceses, which was also prohibited by canon law), the Hohenzollerns had to dispense ever greater briberies at the Holy See. This exhausted their means and caused them to incur vast debts with the Fuggers.\nTo assist in the recovery of the enormous expenditures employed to assist Albert, mediators stipulated with the Holy See that Pope Leo X would allow Albert to sell indulgences to the believers in his archdioceses and their suffragans. The sales proceeds had to cover the amortisation and servicing of the debts; a share for the Holy See, for allowing this exploitation of the believers; the expenditure paid from the Hohenzollerns own pockets; and the charges involved with the sales.\nThe neighbouring Electorate of Saxony also bid for the See of Mainz, but failed to secure it. The Saxon elector Frederick the Wise had debts of his own as a result, but no see to show for it and no privilege to sell indulgences to recover his expenditures. Frustrated, he forbade the sale of indulgences in his electorate and allowed Martin Luther to polemicize against them.\nJoachim Nestor, in contrast, became known as a pugnacious adherent of Roman Catholic orthodoxy. Joachim Nestor's brother, Archbishop Albert, was the initial object of Luther's attack. He urged on the Emperor the need to enforce the Edict of Worms, and at several diets was prominent among the enemies of the Reformers.\nA patron of learning, Joachim Nestor established the Viadrina university of Frankfurt (Oder) in 1506. He promoted Georg von Blumenthal, the \"Pillar of Catholicism\", as Chancellor of Frankfurt University, Bishop of Lebus and a Privy Counsellor. He was among those who met at Dessau in July 1525 and was a member of the league established at Halle in November 1533. But against his will, his wife joined her brother Christian II of Denmark in converting to Lutheranism. In 1528 she fled for safety to Saxony. Joachim Nestor experienced the mortification of seeing Protestantism also favoured by other members of his family. He died at Stendal in 1535.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "16455", "revid": "16185737", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=16455", "title": "John Keats", "text": "English Romantic poet (1795\u20131821)\nJohn Keats (31 October 1795 \u2013 23 February 1821) was an English poet of the second generation of Romantic poets, along with Lord Byron and Percy Bysshe Shelley. His poems had been in publication for less than four years when he died of tuberculosis at the age of 25. They were indifferently received in his lifetime, but his fame grew rapidly after his death. By the end of the century, he was placed in the canon of English literature, strongly influencing many writers of the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood; the \"Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica\" of 1888 described his \"Ode to a Nightingale\" as \"one of the final masterpieces\".\nKeats had a style \"heavily loaded with sensualities\", notably in the series of odes. Typically of the Romantics, he accentuated extreme emotion through natural imagery. Today his poems and letters remain among the most popular and analysed in English literature \u2013 in particular \"Ode to a Nightingale\", \"Ode on a Grecian Urn\", \"Sleep and Poetry\" and the sonnet \"On First Looking into Chapman's Homer\". Jorge Luis Borges named his first time reading Keats an experience he felt all his life.\nIn the later Victorian era, Keats's medievalist poems, such as \"La Belle Dame Sans Merci\" and \"The Eve of St. Agnes\", were a major influence on the Pre-Raphaelite movement, inspiring poets such as Algernon Charles Swinburne, Dante Gabriel Rossetti, and William Morris.\nEarly life and education, 1795\u20131810.\nJohn Keats was born in Moorgate, London, on 31 October 1795, to Thomas and Frances Keats (n\u00e9e Jennings). There is little evidence of his exact birthplace. Although Keats and his family seem to have marked his birthday on 29 October, baptism records give the date as the 31st. He was the eldest of four surviving children; his younger siblings were George (1797\u20131841), Thomas (1799\u20131818), and Frances Mary \"Fanny\" (1803\u20131889), who later married the Spanish author Valent\u00edn de Llanos Guti\u00e9rrez.\nAnother son was lost in infancy. His father first worked as an ostler at the stables attached to the \"Swan and Hoop Inn\" owned by his father-in-law, John Jennings, an establishment he later managed, and where the growing family lived for some years. Keats believed he was born at the inn, a birthplace of humble origins, but there is no evidence to support this. The Globe pub now occupies the site, a few yards from modern Moorgate station. Keats was baptised at St Botolph-without-Bishopsgate, and sent to a local dame school as a child.\nHis parents wished to send their sons to Eton or Harrow, but the family decided they could not afford the fees. In the summer of 1803, John was sent to board at John Clarke's school in Enfield, close to his grandparents' house. The small school had a liberal outlook and a progressive curriculum more modern than the larger, more prestigious schools. In the family atmosphere at Clarke's, Keats developed an interest in classics and history, which would stay with him throughout his short life.\nThe headmaster's son, Charles Cowden Clarke, also became an important mentor and friend, introducing Keats to Renaissance literature, including Tasso, Spenser, and Chapman's translations. The young Keats was described by his friend Edward Holmes as a volatile character, \"always in extremes\", given to indolence and fighting. At 13 he began focusing his energy on reading and study, winning his first academic prize in midsummer 1809.\nIn April 1804, when Keats was eight, his father died from a skull fracture after falling from his horse while returning from a visit to Keats and his brother George at school. Thomas Keats died intestate. Frances remarried two months later, but left her new husband soon afterwards, and the four children went to live with a grandmother, Alice Jennings, in the village of Edmonton.\nIn March 1810, when Keats was 14, his mother died of tuberculosis, leaving the children in their grandmother's custody. She appointed two guardians, Richard Abbey and John Sandell, for them. That autumn, Keats left Clarke's school to be an apprentice with Thomas Hammond, a surgeon and apothecary who was a neighbour and the doctor of the Jennings family. Keats lodged in the attic above the surgery, at 7 Church Street, until 1813. Cowden Clarke, who remained close to Keats, called this period \"the most placid time in Keats' life.\"\nFrom 1814 Keats had two bequests, held in trust for him until his 21st birthday. \u00a3800 was willed by his grandfather John Jennings. Also Keats's mother left a legacy of \u00a38000 to be equally divided among her living children. It seems he was not told of the \u00a3800 and probably knew nothing of it as he never applied for it. Historically, blame has often been laid on Abbey as legal guardian, but he may also have been unaware of it. William Walton, solicitor for Keats's mother and grandmother, definitely knew and had a duty of care to relay the information to Keats. It seems he did not, though it would have made a critical difference to the poet's expectations. Money was always a great concern and difficulty, as he struggled to stay out of debt and make his way in the world independently.\nCareer.\nMedical training and writing poetry.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;poem&gt;\nOn First Looking into Chapman's Homer\nMuch have I travell'd in the realms of gold,\nAnd many goodly states and kingdoms seen;\nRound many western islands have I been\nWhich bards in fealty to Apollo hold.\nOft of one wide expanse had I been told\nThat deep-browed Homer ruled as his demesne;\nYet did I never breathe its pure serene\nTill I heard Chapman speak out loud and bold:\nThen felt I like some watcher of the skies\nWhen a new planet swims into his ken;\nOr like stout Cortez when with eagle eyes\nHe star'd at the Pacific \u00a0\u2013 and all his men\nLook'd at each other with a wild surmise \u00a0\u2013 \nSilent, upon a peak in Darien.\n&lt;/poem&gt;\nThe sonnet \"On First Looking into Chapman's Homer\"October 1816\nIn October 1815, having finished his five-year apprenticeship with Hammond, Keats registered as a medical student at Guy's Hospital, now part of King's College London, and began studying there. Within a month, he was accepted as a dresser at the hospital assisting surgeons during operations, the equivalent of a junior house surgeon today. It was a significant promotion, that marked a distinct aptitude for medicine; and it brought greater responsibility and a heavier workload.\nKeats's long and expensive medical training with Hammond and at Guy's Hospital led his family to assume he would pursue a lifelong career in medicine, assuring financial security, and it seems that, at this point, Keats had a genuine desire to become a doctor. He lodged near the hospital, at 28 St Thomas's Street in Southwark, with other medical students, including Henry Stephens who gained fame as an inventor and ink magnate.\nKeats's training took up increasing amounts of his writing time and he became increasingly ambivalent about it. He felt he was facing a stark choice. He had written his first extant poem, \"An Imitation of Spenser\", in 1814, when he was 19. Now, strongly drawn by ambition, inspired by fellow poets such as Leigh Hunt and Lord Byron, and beleaguered by family financial crises, he suffered periods of depression. His brother George wrote that John \"feared that he should never be a poet, &amp; if he was not he would destroy himself.\" In 1816, Keats received his apothecary's licence, which made him eligible to practise as an apothecary, physician and surgeon, but before the end of the year he informed his guardian that he resolved to be a poet, not a surgeon.\nPublication and literary circles.\nAlthough he continued his work and training at Guy's, Keats devoted more and more time to the study of literature, experimenting with verse forms, particularly the sonnet. In May 1816, Leigh Hunt agreed to publish the sonnet \"O Solitude\" in his magazine \"The Examiner\", a leading liberal magazine of the day. This was the first appearance of Keats's poetry in print; Charles Cowden Clarke called it his friend's red letter day, first proof that Keats's ambitions were valid. Among his poems of 1816 was \"To My Brothers\". That summer, Keats went with Clarke to the seaside town of Margate to write. There he began \"Calidore\" and initiated an era of great letter writing. On returning to London, he took lodgings at 8 Dean Street, Southwark, and braced himself to study further for membership of the Royal College of Surgeons.\nIn October 1816 Clarke introduced Keats to the influential Leigh Hunt, a close friend of Byron and Shelley. Five months later came the publication of \"Poems\", the first volume of Keats's verse, which included \"I stood tiptoe\" and \"Sleep and Poetry\", both strongly influenced by Hunt. The book was a critical failure, arousing little interest, although Reynolds reviewed it favourably in \"The Champion\". Clarke commented that the book \"might have emerged in Timbuctoo.\"\nKeats's publishers, Charles and James Ollier, felt ashamed of it. Keats immediately changed publishers to Taylor and Hessey in Fleet Street. Unlike the Olliers, Keats's new publishers were enthusiastic about his work. Within a month of the publication of \"Poems\" they were planning a new Keats volume and had paid him an advance. Hessey became a steady friend to Keats and made the company's rooms available for young writers to meet. Their publishing lists came to include Coleridge, Hazlitt, Clare, Hogg, Carlyle and Charles Lamb.\nThrough Taylor and Hessey, Keats met their Eton-educated lawyer, Richard Woodhouse, who advised them on literary as well as legal matters and was deeply impressed by \"Poems\". Although he noted that Keats could be \"wayward, trembling, easily daunted,\" Woodhouse was convinced of Keats's genius, a poet to support as he became one of England's greatest writers. Soon after they met, the two became close friends, and Woodhouse started to collect Keatsiana, documenting as much as he could about the poetry. This archive survives as one of the main sources of information on Keats's work. Andrew Motion represents him as Boswell to Keats's Johnson, ceaselessly promoting his work, fighting his corner and spurring his poetry to greater heights. In later years, Woodhouse was one of the few to accompany Keats to Gravesend, Kent, to embark on his final trip to Rome.\nDespite the bad reviews of \"Poems\", Hunt published the essay \"Three Young Poets\" (Shelley, Keats, and Reynolds) and the sonnet \"On First Looking into Chapman's Homer\", foreseeing great things to come. He introduced Keats to many prominent men in his circle, including the editor of \"The Times\", Thomas Barnes; the writer Charles Lamb; the conductor Vincent Novello; and the poet John Hamilton Reynolds, who would become a close friend. Keats also met regularly with William Hazlitt, a powerful literary figure of the day. It was a turning point for Keats, establishing him in the public eye as a figure in what Hunt termed \"a new school of poetry\".\nAt this time Keats wrote to his friend Bailey, \"I am certain of nothing but the holiness of the Heart's affections and the truth of the imagination. What imagination seizes as Beauty must be truth.\" This passage would eventually be transmuted into the concluding lines of \"Ode on a Grecian Urn\": \"'Beauty is truth, truth beauty' \u2013 that is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know\". In early December 1816, under the heady influence of his artistic friends, Keats told Abbey he had decided to give up medicine in favour of poetry, to Abbey's fury. Keats had spent a great deal on his medical training, and despite his state of financial hardship and indebtedness, made large loans to friends such as the painter Benjamin Haydon. Keats would go on to lend \u00a3700 to his brother George. By lending so much, Keats could no longer cover the interest of his own debts.\nTravelling and ill health.\nHaving left his training at the hospital, suffering from a succession of colds, and unhappy with living in damp rooms in London, Keats moved with his brothers into rooms at 1 Well Walk in the village of Hampstead in April 1817. There John and George nursed their tubercular brother Tom. The house was close to Hunt and others of his circle in Hampstead, and to Coleridge, respected elder of the first wave of Romantic poets, then living in Highgate. On 11 April 1818, Keats reported that he and Coleridge had taken a long walk on Hampstead Heath. In a letter to his brother George, he wrote that they had talked about \"a thousand things, ... nightingales, poetry, poetical sensation, metaphysics.\" Around this time he was introduced to Charles Wentworth Dilke and James Rice.\nIn June 1818, Keats began a walking tour of Scotland, Ireland and the Lake District with Charles Armitage Brown. Keats's brother George and his wife Georgiana accompanied them to Lancaster and then continued to Liverpool, from where they migrated to America, living in Ohio and Louisville, Kentucky, until 1841, when George's investments failed. Like Keats's other brother, they both died penniless and racked by tuberculosis, for which there was no effective treatment until the next century.\nIn July, while on the Isle of Mull, Keats caught a bad cold and \"was too thin and fevered to proceed on the journey.\" After returning south in August, Keats continued to nurse Tom, so exposing himself to infection. Some have suggested this was when tuberculosis, his \"family disease\", took hold. \"Consumption\" was not identified as a disease with a single infectious origin until 1820. There was considerable stigma attached to it, as it was often tied with weakness, repressed sexual passion or masturbation. Keats \"refuses to give it a name\" in his letters. Tom Keats died on 1 December 1818.\nWentworth Place: annus mirabilis.\nJohn Keats moved to the newly built Wentworth Place, owned by his friend Charles Armitage Brown. It was on the edge of Hampstead Heath, ten minutes' walk south of his old home in Well Walk. The winter of 1818\u201319, though a difficult period for the poet, marked the beginning of his \"annus mirabilis\" in which he wrote his most mature work. He had been inspired by a series of recent lectures by Hazlitt on English poets and poetic identity and had also met Wordsworth. Keats may have seemed to his friends to be living on comfortable means, but in reality he was borrowing regularly from Abbey and his friends.\nHe composed five of his six great odes at Wentworth Place in April and May and, although it is debated in which order they were written, \"Ode to Psyche\" opened the published series. According to Brown, \"Ode to a Nightingale\" was composed under a plum tree in the garden.\nBrown wrote, \"In the spring of 1819 a nightingale had built her nest near my house. Keats felt a tranquil and continual joy in her song; and one morning he took his chair from the breakfast-table to the grass-plot under a plum-tree, where he sat for two or three hours. When he came into the house, I perceived he had some scraps of paper in his hand, and these he was quietly thrusting behind the books. On inquiry, I found those scraps, four or five in number, contained his poetic feelings on the song of our nightingale.\" Dilke, co-owner of the house, strenuously denied the story, printed in Richard Monckton Milnes' 1848 biography of Keats, dismissing it as 'pure delusion'.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;poem&gt;\nMy heart aches, and a drowsy numbness pains\n My sense, as though of hemlock I had drunk,\nOr emptied some dull opiate to the drains\n One minute past, and Lethe-wards had sunk:\n'Tis not through envy of thy happy lot,\n But being too happy in thine happiness,\u00a0\u2013 \n That thou, light-winged Dryad of the trees,\n In some melodious plot\n Of beechen green, and shadows numberless,\n Singest of summer in full-throated ease.\n&lt;/poem&gt;\nFirst stanza of \"Ode to a Nightingale\",May 1819\n\"Ode on a Grecian Urn\" and \"Ode on Melancholy\" were inspired by sonnet forms and probably written after \"Ode to a Nightingale\". Keats's new and progressive publishers Taylor and Hessey issued \"Endymion\", which Keats dedicated to Thomas Chatterton, a work that he termed \"a trial of my Powers of Imagination\". It was damned by the critics, giving rise to Byron's quip that Keats was ultimately \"snuffed out by an article\", suggesting that he never truly got over it. A particularly harsh review by John Wilson Croker appeared in the April 1818 edition of the \"Quarterly Review\".\nJohn Gibson Lockhart writing in \"Blackwood's Magazine\", described \"Endymion\" as \"imperturbable drivelling idiocy\". With biting sarcasm, Lockhart advised, \"It is a better and a wiser thing to be a starved apothecary than a starved poet; so back to the shop Mr John, back to plasters, pills, and ointment boxes.\"\nIt was Lockhart at \"Blackwoods\" who coined the defamatory term \"the Cockney School\" for Hunt and his circle, which included both Hazlitt and Keats. The dismissal was as much political as literary, aimed at upstart young writers deemed uncouth for their lack of education, non-formal rhyming and \"low diction\". They had not attended Eton, Harrow or Oxbridge and they were not from the upper classes.\nIn 1819 Keats wrote \"The Eve of St. Agnes\", \"La Belle Dame sans Merci\", \"Hyperion\", \"Lamia\" and a play, \"Otho the Great\", critically damned and not performed until 1950. The poems \"Fancy\" and \"Bards of passion and of mirth\" were inspired by the garden of Wentworth Place. In September, very short of money and in despair considering taking up journalism or a post as a ship's surgeon, he approached his publishers with a new book of poems.\nThey were unimpressed with the collection, finding the presented versions of \"Lamia\" confusing, and describing \"St Agnes\" as having a \"sense of pettish disgust\" and \"a 'Don Juan' style of mingling up sentiment and sneering\" concluding it was \"a poem unfit for ladies\". The final volume Keats lived to see published, \"Lamia, Isabella, The Eve of St. Agnes, and Other Poems\", was published in July 1820. It received greater acclaim than had \"Endymion\" or \"Poems\", finding favourable notices in both \"The Examiner\" and \"Edinburgh Review\". It came to be recognised as one of the most important poetic works ever published.\nWentworth Place now houses the Keats House museum.\nIsabella Jones and Fanny Brawne, 1817\u20131820.\nKeats befriended Isabella Jones in May 1817, while on holiday in the village of Bo Peep, near Hastings. She is described as beautiful, talented and widely read, not of the top flight of society yet financially secure, an enigmatic figure who would become a part of Keats's circle. Throughout their friendship Keats never hesitated to own his sexual attraction to her, although they seemed to enjoy circling each other rather than offering commitment. He writes that he \"frequented her rooms\" in the winter of 1818\u201319, and in his letters to George says that he \"warmed with her\" and \"kissed her\".\nThe trysts may have been a sexual initiation for Keats according to Bate and Robert Gittings. Jones inspired and was a steward of Keats's writing. The themes of \"The Eve of St. Agnes\" and \"The Eve of St Mark\" may well have been suggested by her, the lyric \"Hush, Hush!\" [\"o sweet Isabel\"] was about her, and that the first version of \"Bright Star\" may have originally been for her. In 1821, Jones was one of the first in England to be notified of Keats's death.\nLetters and drafts of poems suggest that Keats first met Frances (Fanny) Brawne between September and November 1818. It is likely that the 18-year-old Brawne visited the Dilke family at Wentworth Place before she lived there. She was born in the hamlet of West End, now in the district of West Hampstead, on 9 August 1800. Like Keats's grandfather, her grandfather kept a London inn, and both lost several family members to tuberculosis. She shared her first name with both Keats's sister and mother, and had a talent for dress-making and languages as well as a natural theatrical bent. During November 1818 she developed an intimacy with Keats, but it was shadowed by the illness of Tom Keats, whom John was nursing through this period.\nOn 3 April 1819, Brawne and her widowed mother moved into the other half of Dilke's Wentworth Place, and Keats and Brawne were able to see each other every day. Keats began to lend Brawne books, such as Dante's \"Inferno\", and they would read together. He gave her the love sonnet \"Bright Star\" (perhaps revised for her) as a declaration. It was a work in progress which he continued until the last months of his life, and the poem came to be associated with their relationship. \"All his desires were concentrated on Fanny\". From this point there is no further documented mention of Isabella Jones.\nSometime before the end of June, he arrived at some sort of understanding with Brawne, far from a formal engagement as he still had too little to offer, with no prospects and financial stricture. Keats endured great conflict knowing his expectations as a struggling poet in increasingly hard straits would preclude marriage to Brawne. Their love remained unconsummated; jealousy for his 'star' began to gnaw at him. Darkness, disease and depression surrounded him, reflected in poems such as \"The Eve of St. Agnes\" and \"La Belle Dame sans Merci\" where love and death both stalk. \"I have two luxuries to brood over in my walks;\" he wrote to her, \"your loveliness, and the hour of my death\".\nIn one of his many hundreds of notes and letters, Keats wrote to Brawne on 13 October 1819: \"My love has made me selfish. I cannot exist without you\u00a0\u2013 I am forgetful of every thing but seeing you again\u00a0\u2013 my Life seems to stop there\u00a0\u2013 I see no further. You have absorb'd me. I have a sensation at the present moment as though I was dissolving\u00a0\u2013 I should be exquisitely miserable without the hope of soon seeing you\u00a0... I have been astonished that Men could die Martyrs for religion\u00a0\u2013 I have shudder'd at it\u00a0\u2013 I shudder no more\u00a0\u2013 I could be martyr'd for my Religion\u00a0\u2013 Love is my religion\u00a0\u2013 I could die for that\u00a0\u2013 I could die for you.\"\nTuberculosis took hold and he was advised by his doctors to move to a warmer climate. In September 1820 Keats left for Rome knowing he would probably never see Brawne again. After leaving he felt unable to write to her or read her letters, although he did correspond with her mother. He died there five months later. None of Brawne's letters to Keats survive.\nIt took a month for the news of his death to reach London, after which Brawne stayed in mourning for six years. In 1833, more than 12 years after his death, she married and went on to have three children; she outlived Keats by more than 40 years.\nLast months: Rome, 1820.\nDuring 1820 Keats displayed increasingly serious symptoms of tuberculosis, suffering two lung haemorrhages in the first few days of February. On first coughing up blood, on 3 February 1820, he said to Charles Armitage Brown, \"I know the colour of that blood! It is arterial blood. I cannot be deceived in that colour. That drop of blood is my death warrant. I must die.\"\nHe lost large amounts of blood and was bled further by the attending physician. Hunt nursed him in London for much of the following summer. At the suggestion of his doctors, he agreed to move to Italy with his friend Joseph Severn. On 13 September, they left for Gravesend and four days later boarded the sailing brig \"Maria Crowther\". On 1 October the ship landed at Lulworth Bay or Holworth Bay, where the two went ashore; back on board ship he made the final revisions of \"Bright Star\".\nThe journey was a minor catastrophe: storms broke out, followed by a dead calm that slowed the ship's progress. When they finally docked in Naples, the ship was held in quarantine for ten days due to a suspected outbreak of cholera in Britain. Keats reached Rome on 14 November, by which time any hope of the warmer climate he sought had disappeared.\nKeats wrote his last letter on 30 November 1820 to Charles Armitage Brown; \"Tis the most difficult thing in the world to me to write a letter. My stomach continues so bad, that I feel it worse on opening any book \u2013 yet I am much better than I was in Quarantine. Then I am afraid to encounter the proing and conning of any thing interesting to me in England. I have an habitual feeling of my real life having past, and that I am leading a posthumous existence\".\nOn arrival in Italy, he moved into a villa on the Spanish Steps in Rome, today the Keats\u2013Shelley Memorial House museum. Despite care from Severn and Dr. James Clark, his health rapidly deteriorated. The medical attention Keats received may have hastened his death. In November 1820, Clark declared that the source of his illness was \"mental exertion\" and that the source was largely situated in his stomach. Clark eventually diagnosed consumption (tuberculosis) and placed Keats on a starvation diet of an anchovy and a piece of bread a day intended to reduce the blood flow to his stomach. He also bled the poet: a standard treatment of the day, but also likely a significant contributor to Keats's weakness.\nSevern's biographer Sue Brown writes: \"They could have used opium in small doses, and Keats had asked Severn to buy a bottle of opium when they were setting off on their voyage. What Severn didn't realise was that Keats saw it as a possible resource if he wanted to commit suicide. He tried to get the bottle from Severn on the voyage but Severn wouldn't let him have it. Then in Rome he tried again... Severn was in such a quandary he didn't know what to do, so in the end he went to the doctor, who took it away. As a result Keats went through dreadful agonies with nothing to ease the pain at all.\" Keats was angry with both Severn and Clark when they would not give him laudanum (opium). He repeatedly demanded, \"How long is this posthumous existence of mine to go on?\"\nDeath, 1821.\nThe first months of 1821 marked a slow and steady decline into the final stage of tuberculosis. His autopsy showed his lung almost disintegrated. Keats was coughing up blood and covered in sweat. Severn nursed him devotedly and observed in a letter how Keats would sometimes cry upon waking to find himself still alive. Severn writes,\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nJohn Keats died in Rome on 23 February 1821. His body was buried in the city's Protestant Cemetery. His last request was to be placed under a tombstone bearing no name or date, only the words, \"Here lies One whose Name was writ in Water.\" Severn and Brown erected the stone, which under a relief of a lyre with broken strings, includes the epitaph: \n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;This Grave / contains all that was Mortal, / of a / YOUNG ENGLISH POET, / Who, / on his Death Bed, / in the Bitterness of his Heart, / at the Malicious Power of his Enemies, / Desired / these Words to be engraven on his Tomb Stone / \"Here lies One / Whose Name was writ in Water / Feb 24th 1821\"\nSevern and Brown added their lines to the stone in protest at the critical reception of Keats's work. Hunt blamed his death on the \"Quarterly Review\"'s scathing attack of \"Endymion\". As Byron quipped in his narrative poem \"Don Juan\";\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;&lt;poem&gt;\n'Tis strange the mind, that very fiery particle\nShould let itself be snuffed out by an article.\n&lt;/poem&gt;\nSeven weeks after the funeral, Shelley memorialised Keats in his poem \"Adonais\". Clark saw to a planting of daisies on the grave, saying Keats would have wished it. For public health reasons, the Italian health authorities burnt the furniture in Keats's room, scraped the walls and made new windows, doors and flooring. The ashes of Shelley, one of Keats's most fervent champions, are buried in the cemetery and Joseph Severn is buried next to Keats. On the site today, Marsh wrote, \"In the old part of the graveyard, barely a field when Keats was buried here, there are now umbrella pines, myrtle shrubs, roses, and carpets of wild violets\".\nReception.\nWhen Keats died at 25, he had been writing poetry seriously for only about six years, from 1814 until the summer of 1820, and publishing for only four. In his lifetime, sales of Keats's three volumes of poetry probably amounted to only 200 copies. His first poem, the sonnet \"O Solitude\", appeared in \"the Examiner\" in May 1816, while his collection \"Lamia, Isabella, The Eve of St. Agnes and other poems\" was published in July 1820 before his last visit to Rome. The compression of his poetic apprenticeship and maturity into so short a time is just one remarkable aspect of Keats's work.\nAlthough prolific during his short career, and now one of the most studied and admired British poets, his reputation rests on a small body of work, centred on the Odes, and only in the creative outpouring of the last years of his short life was he able to express the inner intensity for which he has been lauded since his death. Keats was convinced that he had made no mark in his lifetime. Aware that he was dying, he wrote to Fanny Brawne in February 1820, \"I have left no immortal work behind me \u2013 nothing to make my friends proud of my memory \u2013 but I have lov'd the principle of beauty in all things, and if I had had time I would have made myself remember'd.\"\nKeats's ability and talent was acknowledged by several influential contemporary allies such as Shelley and Hunt. His admirers praised him for thinking \"on his pulses\", for having developed a style which was more heavily loaded with sensualities, more gorgeous in its effects, more voluptuously alive than any poet who had come before him: \"loading every rift with ore\". Shelley often corresponded with Keats in Rome and loudly declared that Keats's death had been brought on by bad reviews in the \"Quarterly Review\". Seven weeks after the funeral he wrote \"Adonais\", a despairing elegy, stating that Keats's early death was a personal and public tragedy:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;&lt;poem&gt;\nThe loveliest and the last,\nThe bloom, whose petals nipped before they blew\nDied on the promise of the fruit.&lt;/poem&gt;\nAlthough Keats wrote that \"if poetry comes not as naturally as the Leaves to a tree it had better not come at all,\" poetry did not come easily to him; his work was the fruit of a deliberate and prolonged classical self-education. He may have possessed an innate poetic sensibility, but his early works were clearly those of a young man learning his craft. His first attempts at verse were often vague, languorously narcotic and lacking a clear eye. His poetic sense was based on the conventional tastes of his friend Charles Cowden Clarke, who first introduced him to the classics, and also came from the predilections of Hunt's \"Examiner\", which Keats read as a boy.\nHunt scorned the Augustan or \"French\" school dominated by Pope and attacked earlier Romantic poets Wordsworth and Coleridge, now in their forties, as unsophisticated, obscure and crude writers. During Keats's few years as a published poet, the reputation of the older Romantic school was at its lowest ebb. Keats came to echo these sentiments in his work, identifying himself with a \"new school\" for a time, somewhat alienating him from Wordsworth, Coleridge and Byron and providing a basis for scathing attacks from \"Blackwood's\" and the \"Quarterly Review\".\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;poem&gt;\nSeason of mists and mellow fruitfulness\nClose bosom-friend of the maturing sun\nConspiring with him how to load and bless\nWith fruit the vines that round the thatch-eaves run;\nTo bend with apples the moss'd cottage-trees,\nAnd fill all fruit with ripeness to the core;\nTo swell the gourd, and plump the hazel shells\nWith a sweet kernel; to set budding more,\nAnd still more, later flowers for the bees,\nUntil they think warm days will never cease,\nFor Summer has o'er-brimm'd their clammy cells.\n&lt;/poem&gt;\nFirst stanza of \"To Autumn\",September 1819\nBy his death, Keats had therefore been associated with the taints of both old and new schools: the obscurity of first-wave Romantics and uneducated affectation of Hunt's \"Cockney School\". Keats's posthumous reputation mixed the reviewers' caricature of the simplistic bumbler with the image of a hyper-sensitive genius killed by high feeling, which Shelley later portrayed.\nThe Victorian sense of poetry as the work of indulgence and luxuriant fancy offered a schema into which Keats was posthumously fitted. Marked as the standard-bearer of sensory writing, his reputation grew steadily and remarkably. His work had the full support of the influential Cambridge Apostles, whose members included the young Tennyson, later a popular Poet Laureate who came to regard Keats as the greatest poet of the 19th century. Constance Naden was a great admirer of his poems, arguing that his genius lay in his 'exquisite sensitiveness to all the elements of beauty'.\nIn 1848, twenty-seven years after Keats's death, Richard Monckton Milnes published the first full biography, which helped place Keats within the canon of English literature. The Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood, including Millais and Rossetti, were inspired by Keats and painted scenes from his poems including \"The Eve of St. Agnes\", \"Isabella\" and \"La Belle Dame sans Merci\": lush, arresting and popular images which remain closely associated with Keats's work.\nIn 1882, Swinburne wrote in the \"Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica\" that \"the Ode to a Nightingale [was] one of the final masterpieces of human work in all time and for all ages\". In the 20th century Keats remained the muse of poets such as Wilfred Owen, who kept his death date as a day of mourning, Yeats and T. S. Eliot. Critic Helen Vendler stated the odes \"are a group of works in which the English language finds an ultimate embodiment.\" Bate said of \"To Autumn\": \"Each generation has found it one of the most nearly perfect poems in English\" and M. R. Ridley said the ode \"is the most serenely flawless poem in our language.\"\nThe largest collection of the letters, manuscripts, and other papers of Keats is in the Houghton Library at Harvard University. Other collections of material are archived at the British Library, Keats House, Hampstead, the Keats\u2013Shelley Memorial House in Rome and the Pierpont Morgan Library in New York. Since 1998 the British Keats-Shelley Memorial Association have annually awarded a prize for romantic poetry. A Royal Society of Arts blue plaque was unveiled in 1896 to commemorate Keats at Keats House.\nJorge Luis Borges named his first encounter with Keats an experience he felt all his life.\nBiographers.\nNone of Keats's biographies were written by people who had known him. Shortly after his death, his publishers announced they would speedily publish \"The memoirs and remains of John Keats\" but his friends refused to cooperate and argued with each other to such an extent that the project was abandoned. Leigh Hunt's \"Lord Byron and some of his Contemporaries\" (1828) gives the first biographical account, strongly emphasising Keats's supposedly humble origins, a misconception which still continues. Given that he was becoming a significant figure within artistic circles, a succession of other publications followed, including anthologies of his many notes, chapters and letters.\nHowever, early accounts often gave contradictory or biased versions of events and were subject to dispute. His friends Brown, Severn, Dilke, Shelley and his guardian Richard Abbey, his publisher Taylor, Fanny Brawne and many others issued posthumous commentary on Keats's life. These early writings coloured all subsequent biography and have become embedded in a body of Keats legend.\nShelley promoted Keats as someone whose achievement could not be separated from agony, who was 'spiritualised' by his decline and too fine-tuned to endure the harshness of life; the consumptive, suffering image popularly held today. The first full biography was published in 1848 by Richard Monckton Milnes. Landmark Keats biographers since include Sidney Colvin, Robert Gittings, Walter Jackson Bate, Aileen Ward, and Andrew Motion. The idealised image of the heroic romantic poet who battled poverty and died young was inflated by the late arrival of an authoritative biography and the lack of an accurate likeness. Most of the surviving portraits of Keats were painted after his death, and those who knew him held that they did not succeed in capturing his unique quality and intensity.\nOther portrayals.\n\"John Keats: His Life and Death\", the first major motion picture about the life of Keats, was produced in 1973 by Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica, Inc. It was directed by John Barnes. John Stride played John Keats and Janina Faye played Fanny Brawne. The 2009 film \"Bright Star\", written and directed by Jane Campion, focuses on Keats's relationship with Fanny Brawne. Inspired by the 1997 Keats biography by Andrew Motion, Ben Whishaw played Keats and Abbie Cornish played Fanny.\nPoet Laureate Simon Armitage wrote \"'I speak as someone...'\" to commemorate the 200th anniversary of Keats's death. It was first published in \"The Times\" on 20 February 2021. In 2007 a sculpture of Keats seated on a bench, by sculptor Stuart Williamson, was unveiled at Guys and Saint Thomas' Hospital, London by the Poet Laureate, Andrew Motion.\nA sculpture of the 21-year-old Keats, by Martin Jennings, was unveiled by Michael Mainelli, the Lord Mayor of London, in Moorgate in the City of London on 31 October 2024, the 229th anniversary of Keats's birth.\nLetters.\nKeats's letters were first published in 1848 and 1878. Critics in the 19th century disregarded them as distractions from his poetic works, but in the 20th century they became almost as admired and studied as his poetry, and are highly regarded in the canon of English literary correspondence. T. S. Eliot called them \"certainly the most notable and most important ever written by any English poet.\"\nKeats spent much time considering poetry itself, its constructs and impacts, displaying a deep interest unusual in his milieu, who were more easily distracted by metaphysics or politics, fashions or science. Eliot wrote of Keats's conclusions: \"There is hardly one statement of Keats' about poetry which\u00a0... will not be found to be true, and what is more, true for greater and more mature poetry than anything Keats ever wrote.\"\nFew of Keats's letters remain from the period before he joined his literary circle. From spring 1817, however, there is a rich record of his prolific and impressive letter-writing skills. He and his friends, poets, critics, novelists, and editors wrote to each other daily, and Keats's ideas are bound up in the ordinary, his day-to-day missives sharing news, parody and social commentary. They glitter with humour and critical intelligence. Born of an \"unself-conscious stream of consciousness,\" they are impulsive, full of awareness of his own nature and his weak spots.\nWhen his brother George went to America, Keats wrote to him in detail, the body of letters becoming \"the real diary\" and self-revelation of Keats's life, as well as an exposition of his philosophy, with the first drafts of poems containing some of Keats's finest writing and thought. Gittings sees them as akin to a \"spiritual journal\" not written for a specific other, so much as for synthesis.\nKeats also reflected on the background and composition of his poetry. Specific letters often coincide with or anticipate the poems they describe. In February to May 1819 he produced many of his finest letters. Writing to his brother George, Keats explored the idea of the world as \"the vale of Soul-making\", anticipating the great odes he wrote some months later. In the letters Keats coined ideas such as the Mansion of Many Apartments and the Chameleon Poet, which came to gain common currency and capture the public imagination, though only making single appearances as phrases in his correspondence. The poetical mind, Keats argued:\nhas no self \u2013 it is every thing and nothing \u2013 It has no character \u2013 it enjoys light and shade;\u00a0... What shocks the virtuous philosopher, delights the camelion [chameleon] Poet. It does no harm from its relish of the dark side of things any more than from its taste for the bright one; because they both end in speculation. A Poet is the most unpoetical of any thing in existence; because he has no Identity \u2013 he is continually in for \u2013 and filling some other Body \u2013 The Sun, the Moon, the Sea and Men and Women who are creatures of impulse are poetical and have about them an unchangeable attribute \u2013 the poet has none; no identity \u2013 he is certainly the most unpoetical of all God's Creatures.\nHe used the term negative capability to discuss the state of being in which we are \"capable of being in uncertainties, Mysteries, doubts without any irritable reaching after fact &amp; reason\u00a0... [Being] content with half knowledge\" where one trusts in the heart's perceptions. He wrote later he was \"certain of nothing but the holiness of the Heart's affections and the truth of Imagination \u2013 What the imagination seizes as Beauty must be truth \u2013 whether it existed before or not \u2013 for I have the same Idea of all our Passions as of Love they are all in their sublime, creative of essential Beauty\" constantly returning to what it means to be a poet. \"My Imagination is a Monastery and I am its Monk\", Keats notes to Shelley.\nIn September 1819, Keats wrote to Reynolds \"How beautiful the season is now \u2013 How fine the air. A temperate sharpness about it... I never lik'd the stubbled fields as much as now \u2013 Aye, better than the chilly green of spring. Somehow the stubble plain looks warm \u2013 in the same way as some pictures look warm \u2013 this struck me so much in my Sunday's walk that I composed upon it\". The final stanza of his last great ode, \"To Autumn\", runs:\n&lt;poem&gt;\nWhere are the songs of Spring? Ay, where are they?\nThink not of them, thou hast thy music too, \u2013\nWhile barred clouds bloom the soft-dying day,\nAnd touch the stubble-plains with rosy hue;\n&lt;/poem&gt;\n\"To Autumn\" was to become one of the most highly regarded poems in the English language.\nThere are areas of his life and daily routine that Keats omits. He mentions little of his childhood or his financial straits, being seemingly embarrassed to discuss them. There is no reference to his parents. In his last year, as his health deteriorated, his concerns often give way to despair and morbid obsessions. His letters to Fanny Brawne, published in 1870, focus on the period and emphasise its tragic aspect, giving rise to widespread criticism at the time.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "16457", "revid": "29031104", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=16457", "title": "Jewish Defense League", "text": "Far-right Jewish political organization\nThe Jewish Defense League (JDL) is a far-right political organization in the United States, Canada and France. Its stated goal is to \"protect Jews from antisemitism by whatever means necessary\"; it has been classified as \"right-wing terrorist group\" by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) since 2001, and is also designated as hate group by the Southern Poverty Law Center. According to the FBI, the JDL has been involved in plotting and executing acts of terrorism within the United States. Most terrorist watch groups classify the group as inactive as of 2015.\nFounded by Meir Kahane in New York City in 1968, the JDL's self-described purpose was to protect Jews from local manifestations of antisemitism. Its criticism of the Soviet Union increased local support for the group, transforming it from a \"vigilante club\" into an organization with a stated membership numbering over 15,000 at one point. The group took to bombing Arab and Soviet properties in the United States while assassinating a variety of alleged \"enemies of the Jewish people\" ranging from Arab-American political activists to neo-Nazis. A number of JDL members have been linked to violent, and sometimes deadly, attacks in the United States and in other countries, including the murder of the American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee regional director Alex Odeh in 1985; the Cave of the Patriarchs massacre in 1994; a plot to assassinate U.S. Representative Darrell Issa in 2001; and a plot to bomb the King Fahad Mosque in Culver City, California. In 1990, Kahane was assassinated by an Egyptian-American gunman, El Sayyid Nosair, at a hotel in New York City.\nAccording to the Anti-Defamation League, the JDL consists only of \"thugs and hooligans\" and Kahane \"preached a radical form of Jewish nationalism which reflected racism, violence, and political extremism,\" attitudes that were replicated by his successor Irv Rubin.\nOrigins.\nIn 1968, while Kahane served as the associate editor for \"The Jewish Press\", the paper's office began receiving numerous calls and letters about crimes being committed against Jews and Jewish institutions. Violence in the New York City area was on the rise, with Jews making up a disproportionately large percentage of the victims. Elderly Jews were being harassed and mugged, storeowners were held up and Jewish teachers were assaulted while Jewish synagogues were defaced and Jewish cemeteries desecrated.\nAfter discussing the matter with a few congregants, Kahane put out an ad in \"The Jewish Press\" on May 24, 1968, which read: \"We are talking of JEWISH SURVIVAL! Are you willing to stand up for democracy and Jewish survival? Join and support the Jewish Defense Corps.\" Shortly after, Kahane renamed the group the \"Jewish Defense League,\" fearing that \"Corps\" would be construed as too militant. The group's declared purpose was: \"to combat anti-Semitism in the public and private sectors of life in the United States of America.\" Kahane stated that the League was formed to \"do the job that the Anti-Defamation League should do but doesn't.\"\nShortly afterwards, the Jewish Defense League put out a four-page manifesto which stated: \"America has been good to the Jew and the Jew has been good to America. A land founded on the principles of democracy and freedom has given unprecedented opportunities to a people devoted to those ideals\" yet now finds itself threatened by \"political extremism\" and \"racist militancy.\" Furthermore, the manifesto stated that the organization rejects all hate and illegality, believes firmly in law and order, backs police forces and will work actively in the courts to strike down all discrimination. When asked about Jewish Defense League members breaking the law, Kahane responded: \"We respect the right and the obligation of the American government to prosecute us and send us to jail. No one gripes about that.\"\nThe group adopted the slogan \"Never Again!\" which was originally used by the Jewish resistance fighters in the Warsaw ghetto. While the phrase is usually interpreted to mean that the Nazi Holocaust of six million Jews will never be permitted to recur, Kahane claimed that his intention was to declare that Jews should never again be caught by surprise or lulled into a foolish trust in others.\nThe first Jewish Defense League demonstration took place on August 5, 1968, at New York University with some 15 members chanting: \"No Nazis at NYU, Jewish rights are precious too.\"\nHistory.\n1969.\nOn August 7, the JDL sent members to Passaic, New Jersey, to protect Jewish merchants from anti-Jewish rioting which had swept the area for days.\nOn November 25, the JDL was invited to the Boston area by Jewish residents in response to a mounting wave of crime directed primarily against Jews.\nOn December 3, JDL members attacked the Syrian Mission in New York.\nOn December 31, 13 JDL members were arrested after a series of coordinated actions against Soviet property in Manhattan and at Kennedy Airport intended to protest the treatment of Jews in the Soviet Union. Several youths painted slogans on a Soviet airliner, two of them handcuffed themselves to the airliner, while others daubed the words \"Am Yisroel Chai\" (the Nation of Israel Lives) on the plane's doors. A similar slogan was painted on the walls of the office of Tass, the Soviet news agency, in Rockefeller Plaza, which was invaded by Rabbi Kahane and four other JDL members. The rest of the demonstrators were taken into custody after invading the midtown offices of the Soviet tourist bureau.\n1970.\nInitially, the League was connected to a series of violent attacks against the Soviet Union's interests in the United States, protesting the former country's repression of Soviet Jews, who were often jailed and refused exit visas. The JDL decided that violence was necessary to draw attention to their plight, reasoning that Moscow would respond to the strain on Soviet\u2013US relations by allowing more emigration to Israel.\nIn 1970, according to Christopher Andrew and Vasili Mitrokhin, agents of the Soviet KGB forged and sent threatening letters to Arab missions claiming to be from the JDL to discredit it. They also were ordered to bomb a target in the \"Negro section of New York\" and blame it on the JDL.\nOn January 25, JDL members staged anti-Soviet demonstrations at a concert of the Moscow Philharmonic Orchestra in Brooklyn College's auditorium. JDL members \"danced, sang and yelled\" while trying to prevent people from entering the auditorium.\nOn March 23, JDL members staged a sit-in in the office of the president of the Federation of Jewish Philanthropies of New York to demand that the Federation allocate more funds for Jewish education and Jewish defense, assist institutions threatened by violence, and arrange for \"popular\" election of Federation officials. As a result, the Federation agreed to form a special committee to consider the request for additional funds for Jewish education, while other groups continued to demonstrate.\nOn April 7, the JDL held memorial services on behalf of civilian victims of \"Arab terrorism during the past half century\" in front of the United Arab Republic Mission to the United Nations.\nOn April 9, nine JDL members occupied the principal's office of Leeds Junior High School in Philadelphia after school authorities had allegedly failed to crack down on school violence. The JDL hoped to present six \"suggestions\" for protecting students from assault and theft by \"troublemakers,\" including committing them to disciplinary schools, stationing policemen in the public schools and replacing \"weak administrators.\"\nOn April 20, fifteen JDL members were arrested after chaining themselves to the fence in front of the Soviet Mission to the UN to protest against the treatment of Jews in the Soviet Union.\nOn May 8, about fifty JDL members demonstrated outside the Black Panther Party headquarters in Harlem due to an alleged \"outrageous explosion of anti-Semitic hatred\" by the Panthers.\nOn May 19, the JDL issued a statement attacking American Jewish organizations which opposed the Vietnam War, accusing them of doing more to destroy the State of Israel \"than all the Arab armies.\"\nOn May 20, thirty-five JDL members took over the Park East Synagogue, opposite the Soviet Mission, and barricaded the entrances in order to hold a \"liberation seder\" for Soviet Jewry.\nOn June 23, about forty JDL members seized two floors of an office building in New York housing Amtorg, the official Soviet Union trade office, and evicted the personnel in what the JDL deemed retaliation for the arrests of Jews and raids on Jewish homes in the Soviet Union.\nOn June 28, 150 JDL members demonstrated over attacks against the Jews of Williamsburg in reprisal for the accidental killing of a black girl by a Jewish driver. Clashes broke out with other minority groups and arrests were made.\nOn August 16, 400 JDL members began a week-long march from Philadelphia to Washington on behalf of Soviet Jewry, concluding with a rally at Lafayette Park urging President Nixon to \"stand tall and firm in the Middle East as you have done elsewhere.\" In response, Thomas Hale Boggs Jr., a congressional candidate from Montgomery County (Md.), said he would sponsor a House resolution on Soviet Jewry.\nOn September 27, two JDL members were arrested at Kennedy Airport while attempting to board a London-bound plane armed with four loaded guns and a live hand grenade. The two intended to hijack a United Arab Airlines plane and divert it to Israel.\nOn October 6, the JDL is suspected of bombing the New York office of the Palestine Liberation Organization after the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, a member of the PLO, hijacked four airliners the previous month. United Press International reported that an anonymous caller phoned in about a half hour before the explosion and proclaimed the JDL slogan, \"Never again.\"\nOn December 20, during a march to protest the treatment of Soviet Jewry, JDL members attempted to take over the Soviet Mission headquarters. The members were arrested after inciting demonstrators to break through police lines.\nOn December 27, the JDL launched a 100-hour vigil for Soviet Jewry. Demonstrators tried to break through police barricades to reach the Soviet Mission to the UN to protest the sentencing of Jews in Leningrad. Several arrests were made.\nOn December 29, an estimated 100 JDL members demonstrated in front of the offices of the New York Board of Rabbis, challenging them to get arrested \"for Jews, as well as for blacks.\" Later that day, several JDL members scuffled with police outside the office of Aeroflot-In tourist, the official Soviet tourist agency, while JDL leader Meir Kahane demanded the right to purchase two tickets to Israel for two Russian Jews who were sentenced to death. About 75 JDL members marched near the office, chanting slogans such as \"Freedom Now\" and \"Let My People Go.\"\nOn December 30, several hundred JDL members participated in a rally for Soviet Jewry in Foley square, chanting \"Let My People Go,\" \"Open Up the Iron Door\" and \"Never Again!\"\n1971.\nOn January 8, 1971, a bombing outside of the Soviet cultural center in Washington, D.C. was followed by a phone call including the JDL slogan \"Never again.\" A JDL spokesperson denied the group's involvement in the bombing, but refused to condemn it.\nOn January 17, in response to JDL tactics against Soviet personnel being condemned by the Israeli Cabinet and American Jewish leaders, eight former Soviet Jews living in Israel sent cables to American Jewish leaders denouncing their condemnation of the JDL and denying that the JDL's acts endangered Soviet Jews. The cables said they were convinced that the JDL's \"policy and activities are most effective.\" The group also attacked Israeli authorities for alleged softness in fighting the Soviet Union on the issue of Jewish rights. One of the signatories, Dov Sperling, claimed that the recent cancellation of the Bolshoi Ballet's scheduled American tour was forced by the JDL and hailed it as the first public surrender by Soviet authorities to Jewish pressure. Herut leader Menachem Begin also declared support of acts of harassment against Soviet diplomatic establishments abroad.\nOn January 19, twenty JDL members had conducted a half-hour sit-in at the offices of Columbia Artists Inc. in Manhattan, leaving only after they were assured a meeting would be set up with the company's president in the near future.\nOn January 20, JDL national chairman Rabbi Meir Kahane announced that JDL will conduct \"non-violent actions\" against organizations engaged in cultural exchange programs with the Soviet Union and that there had been \"unofficial contacts\" between his group and \"some Jewish establishment organizations\" which were welcomed.\n1972\u20131979.\nIn 1972, two JDL members were arrested and convicted of bomb possession and burglary in an attempt to blow up the Long Island residence of the Soviet Mission to the United Nations.\nIn 1972, a smoke bomb was planted in the Manhattan office of music impresario Sol Hurok, who organized Soviet performers' U.S. tours. Iris Kones, a Jewish secretary from Long Island, died of smoke inhalation, and Hurok and 12 others were injured and hospitalized. Jerome Zeller of the JDL was indicted for the bombing and Kahane later admitted his part in the attack. JDL activities were condemned by Moscow refuseniks who felt that the group's actions were making it less likely that the Soviet Union would relax restrictions on Jewish emigration.\nIn 1973, threatening phone calls made to the home of Ralph Riskin, one of the producers of \"Bridget Loves Bernie\", resulted in the arrest of Robert S. Manning, described as a member of the JDL. Manning was later indicted on separate murder charges, and fought extradition to the United States from Israel, where he had moved.\nIn 1975, JDL leader Meir Kahane was accused of conspiracy to kidnap a Soviet diplomat, bomb the Iraqi embassy in Washington, and ship arms abroad from Israel. A hearing was held to revoke Kahane's probation for a 1971 incendiary device-making incident. He was found guilty of violating probation and served a one-year prison sentence. On December 31, 1975, 15 members of the League seized the office of the Permanent Observer of the Holy See to the United Nations in protest for Pope Paul VI's policy of support of Palestinian rights. The incident was over after one hour, as the activists left the location after being ordered to do so by the local police, and no arrests were made.\nOn April 6, 1976, six prominent refuseniks \u2013 including Alexander Lerner, Anatoly Shcharansky, and Iosif Begun \u2013 condemned the JDL's anti-Soviet activities as terrorist acts, stating that their \"actions constitute a danger for Soviet Jews ... as they might be used by the [Soviet] authorities as a pretext for new repressions and for instigating anti-Semitic hostilities.\"\nOn March 16, 1978, Irv Rubin, chairman of the JDL, said about the planned American Nazi Party march in Skokie, Illinois: \"We are offering $500, that I have in my hand, to any member of the community ... who kills, maims or seriously injures a member of the American Nazi Party.\" Rubin was charged with solicitation of murder but was acquitted in 1981.\n1980\u20131989.\nDuring the 1980s, past-JDL member Victor Vancier (who later founded the Jewish Task Force), and two other former JDL members were arrested in connection with six incidents: 1984 firebombing of an automobile at a Soviet diplomatic residence, the 1985 and 1986 pipe bombings of rival JDL members' cars, the 1986 firebombing at a hall where the Soviet State Symphony Orchestra was performing, and two 1986 detonations of tear gas grenades to protest performances by Soviet dance troupes. In a 1984 interview, the JDL leader Meir Kahane admitted that the JDL \"bombed the Russian mission in New York, the Russian cultural mission here [Washington] in 1971, the Soviet trade offices.\" The attacks, which caused minor diplomatic crisis in relations between the U.S. and the USSR, prompted the New York City Police Department (NYPD) to infiltrate the group and one undercover officer discovered a chain of weapon caches across Brooklyn, containing \"enough shotguns and rifles to arm a small militia.\"\nOn October 26, 1981, after two firebombs damaged the Egyptian tourist office at Rockefeller Center, JDL Chairman Meir Kahane said at a press conference: \"I'm not going to say that the JDL bombed that office. There are laws against that in this country. But I'm not going to say I mourn for it either.\" The next day, after an anonymous caller claimed responsibility on behalf of the JDL, the group's spokesman later denied his group's involvement, but said, \"we support the act.\" JDL members had often been suspected of involvement in attacks against neo-Nazis, Holocaust deniers and antisemites.\nOn October 11, 1985, Alex Odeh, regional director of the American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee (ADC), was killed in a mail bombing at his office in Santa Ana, California. Shortly before his killing, Odeh had appeared on the television show \"Nightline\", where he engaged in a tense dialogue with a representative from the JDL. Irv Rubin immediately made several controversial public statements in reaction to the incident: \"I have no tears for Mr. Odeh. He got exactly what he deserved. ... My tears were used up crying for Leon Klinghoffer.\" The Anti-Defamation League and the American Jewish Committee both condemned the murder. Four weeks after Odeh's death, FBI spokesperson Lane Bonner stated the FBI attributed the bombing and two others to the JDL. In February 1986, the FBI classified the bombing that killed Alex Odeh as a terrorist act. Rubin denied JDL involvement: \"What the FBI is doing is simple. ... Some character calls up a news agency or whatever and uses the phrase \"Never Again\" ... and on that assumption they can go and slander a whole group. That's tragic.\" In 1987, Floyd Clarke, then assistant director of the FBI, wrote in an internal memo that key suspects had fled to Israel and were living in the West Bank urban settlement of Kiryat Arba. In 1988, the FBI arrested Rochelle Manning as a suspect in the bombing, and also charged her husband, Robert Steven Manning, whom they considered a prime suspect in the attack; both were members of the JDL. Rochelle's jury deadlocked, and after the mistrial, she left for Israel to join her husband. Robert Manning was extradited from Israel to the U.S. in 1993. He was subsequently found guilty of involvement in the killing of the secretary of computer firm ProWest, Patricia Wilkerson, in another, unrelated mail bomb blast. In addition, he and other JDL members were also suspected in a string of other violent attacks through 1985, including the bombing of Boston ADC office that seriously injured two police officers, the bomb killing of suspected Nazi war criminal Tscherim Soobzokov in Paterson, New Jersey, and a bombing in Long Island, which was targeted at suspected Nazi war criminal Elmars Sprogis and maimed a bystander. William Ross, another JDL member, was also found guilty for his participation in the bombing that killed Wilkerson. Rochelle Manning was re-indicted for her alleged involvement, and was detained in Israel, pending extradition, when she died of a heart attack in 1994.\n1990\u20131999.\nWhen Ruthless Records recording artist and former N.W.A member Dr. Dre sought to work instead with Death Row Records, Ruthless Records executives, Mike Klein and Jerry Heller were fearful of possible physical intimidation from Death Row Entertainment executives including chief executive officer Suge Knight and requested security assistance from the JDL. The FBI launched a money laundering investigation, on the presumption that the JDL was extorting money from Ruthless Records and several rap artists, including Tupac Shakur and Eazy-E. Heller has speculated that the FBI did not investigate these threats because of the song \"Fuck tha Police\". Heller said, \"It was no secret that in the aftermath of the Suge Knight shake down incident where Eazy was forced to sign over Dr. Dre, Michel'le and The D.O.C., that Ruthless was protected by Israeli trained/connected security forces.\" The FBI documents refer to the JDL death threats and extortion scheme but do not make a direct connection between the group and the 1996 murder of Tupac Shakur.\nIn 1995, when the Toronto residence of the Holocaust denier Ernst Z\u00fcndel was the target of an arson attack, a group calling itself the \"Jewish Armed Resistance Movement\" claimed responsibility; according to the \"Toronto Sun\", the group had ties to the JDL and to Kahane Chai. The leader of the Toronto wing of the Jewish Defense League, Meir Halevi, denied involvement in the attack, although, just five days later, Halevi was caught trying to break into Z\u00fcndel's property, where he was apprehended by police. Later the same month Z\u00fcndel was the recipient of a parcel bomb that was detonated by the Toronto police bomb squad. In 2011, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police had launched an investigation against at least nine members of the JDL in regards to an anonymous tip that the JDL was plotting to bomb the Palestine House in Mississauga.\n2000\u2013present.\nOn December 12, 2001, JDL leader Irv Rubin and JDL member Earl Krugel were charged with planning a series of bomb attacks against the Muslim Public Affairs Council in Los Angeles, the King Fahad Mosque in Culver City, California, and the San Clemente office of Arab-American Congressman Darrell Issa, in the wake of the September 11 attacks. Rubin, who also was charged with unlawful possession of an automatic firearm, claimed that he was innocent. On November 4, 2002, at the federal Metropolitan Detention Center in Los Angeles, Rubin slit his throat with a safety razor and jumped out of a third story window. Rubin's suicide would be contested by his widow and the JDL, particularly after his co-defendant pleaded guilty to the charges and implicated Rubin in the plot. On February 4, 2003, Krugel pleaded guilty to conspiracy and weapons charges stemming from the plot, and was expected to serve up to 20 years in prison. The core of the evidence against Krugel and Rubin was in a number of conversations taped by an informant, Danny Gillis, who was hired by the men to plant the bombs but who turned to the FBI instead. According to one tape, Krugel thought the attacks would serve as \"a wakeup call\" to Arabs. Krugel was subsequently murdered in prison by a fellow inmate in 2005.\nIn 2002, in France, attackers from Betar and Ligue de D\u00e9fense Juive (LDJ) violently assaulted Jewish demonstrators from Peace Now, journalists, police officers (one of whom was stabbed), and Arab bystanders. At least two of the suspects in the 2010 murder of a French Muslim Sa\u00efd Bourarach appeared to have ties to the French chapter of the JDL. In 2011, Israeli daily \"Haaretz\" reported members of the \"French branch of Jewish terror group coming to Israel 'to defend settlements'.\" In 2013, a French Arab man was critically injured in a \"revenge attack\" by LDJ, sparking calls for further attacks against the Jews and a condemnation of the militant group by the French Jewish umbrella group CRIF; as of 2013, there have been least 115 violent incidents were attributed to LDJ \"soldiers\" since the group's registration in France in 2001, including many vigilante reprisals to antisemitic attacks. Earlier that year, two LDJ members were sentenced for an attack at a pro-Palestinian bookstore that injured two people and a LDJ propaganda video called for \"five cops for every Jew, 10 Arabs for each rabbi.\"\nOn February 22, 2014, France's LDJ published a eulogy ahead of the 25th anniversary of Cave of the Patriarchs massacre, praising and referred Goldstein as a \"saint\" and a \"hero\".\nIn June 2014, two LDJ supporters were sentenced to prison in France for targeting the car of Jonathan Moadab, the Jewish co-founder of the blog \"Cercle des Volontaires (Circle of Volunteers)\", with a home-made bomb in September 2012.\nIn October 2015, around 100 people who had JDL flags, and Israeli flags and letting off flares attacked the Agence France Presse building in Paris. Around 12 of them, armed with batons, assaulted David Perrotin, a leading French journalist. All were linked to the Jewish Defense League (JDL).\nOn January 21, 2017, multiple members of the Jewish Defense League held a party during Donald Trump's presidential inauguration in an office building in New York City in Times Square where bagels, wine were present and Kiddush during the time was recited.\nAfter the October 7 attacks, Kahanist sentiments and the reemergence of the JDL in Canada and the United States with pro-Israel protests in the country shown people holding JDL logos and flags with people also posting on YouTube, Facebook, and Twitter (Now X) pro-Kahane and JDL content.\nOn October 30, 2023, the Jewish Defense League member, Robert Manning, was released on parole after being sentenced to life after assassinating Alex Odeh October 11, 1985.\nOn November 12, 2023, during the March for the Republic and Against Antisemitism members of the French JDL division, Ligue de D\u00e9fense Juive, assaulted a person who was protesting against Marine Le Pen and attacked demonstrators from the Golem collective.\nIn May 2024, Rabbi Reuven Kahane, a relative to Rabbi Meir Kahane, were arrested after assaulting members of a pro-Palestinian protest in New York City after protesters and Kahane got into an argument which led to Kahane's car being damaged, Kahane then assaulted one of the protesters. Kahane also hit a 55-year-old safety marshal with his car, but denies association with the Jewish Defense League.\nOn the campus of the University of Toronto in September 2024, Eli Schwarz and Meir Weinstein were seen near a pro-Palestinian protest.\nIsrael.\nKahane immigrated to Israel from the United States in September 1971, where he initiated protests advocating the expulsion of Arabs from Israel and the Palestinian territories. In 1972, JDL leaflets were distributed around Hebron, calling for the mayor to stand trial for the 1929 Hebron massacre.\nKahane nominally lead the JDL until April 1974. In 1971, he founded a new political party in Israel, which ran in the 1973 elections under the name \"The League List\". The party won 12,811 votes (0.82%), just 2,857 (0.18%) short of the electoral threshold at the time (1%) for winning a seat. Following the elections, the party's name was changed to Kach, taken from the Irgun motto \"Rak Kach\" (\"Only thus\"). Kach failed to gain any Knesset seats in the 1977 and 1980 elections as well. In the 1984 elections, the party won 25,907 votes (1.2%), passing the electoral threshold for the first time, and winning one seat, which was duly taken by Kahane.\nKahane's popularity grew, with polls showing that Kach would have likely received three to four seats in the coming November 1988 elections, and some forecasting as many as twelve seats, possibly making Kach the third largest party. However, after the Knesset passed an amendment to the Elections Law, Kach was disqualified from running in the 1988 elections by the Central Elections Committee, on the grounds of incitement to racism and negation of the democratic character of the State.\nOn November 5, 1990, Kahane was assassinated after making a speech in New York. The prime suspect, El Sayyid Nosair, an Egyptian-born American citizen, was subsequently acquitted of murder, but convicted on gun possession charges. The Kach party subsequently split in two, with Binyamin Ze'ev Kahane (Meir Kahane's son) leading a breakaway faction, Kahane Chai. Both parties were banned from participating in the 1992 elections on the basis that they were followers of the original Kach. Binyamin Ze'ev Kahane and his wife Talya were shot and killed by Palestinian terrorists on December 31, 2000.\nOn February 25, 1994, Baruch Goldstein, an American-born Israeli member of Kach, who in his youth was a JDL activist, opened fire on Muslims kneeling in prayer at the revered Cave of the Patriarchs mosque in the West Bank city of Hebron, killing 29 worshippers and injuring 125 before he ran out of ammunition and was himself killed. The attack set off riots and protests throughout the West Bank and 19 Palestinians were killed by the Israeli Defense Forces within 48 hours of the massacre. On its website, the JDL described the massacre as a \"preventative measure against yet another Arab attack on Jews\" and noted that they \"do not consider his assault to qualify under the label of terrorism\". Furthermore, they noted that \"we teach that violence is never a good solution but is unfortunately sometimes necessary as a last resort when innocent lives are threatened; we therefore view Dr. Goldstein as a martyr in Judaism's protracted struggle against Arab terrorism. And we are not ashamed to say that Goldstein was a charter member of the Jewish Defense League.\" In a similar attack nearly twelve years earlier, on April 11, 1982, an American-born JDL member and immigrant to Israel, Alan Harry Goodman, opened fire with his military-issue rifle at the Dome of the Rock on the sacred Temple Mount in Jerusalem, killing one Palestinian Arab and injuring four others. The 1982 shooting sparked an Arab riot in which another Palestinian was shot dead by the police. In 1983, Goodman was sentenced by an Israeli court to life in prison (which usually means 25 years in Israel); he was released after serving 15 1/2 years on the condition of returning to the United States.\nTerrorism and other illegal activities.\nIn a 2004 congressional testimony, John S. Pistole, executive assistant director for counterterrorism and counterintelligence for the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) described the JDL as \"a known violent extremist Jewish organization.\" FBI statistics show that, from 1980 through 1985, there were 18 officially classified terrorist attacks in the U.S. committed by Jews; 15 of those by members of the JDL.\nIn its report, \"Terrorism 2000/2001\", the FBI referred to the JDL as a \"violent extremist Jewish organization\" and stated that the FBI was responsible for thwarting at least one of its terrorist acts. The National Consortium for the Study of Terror and Responses to Terrorism states that, during the JDL's first two decades of activity, it was an \"active terrorist organization.\" The JDL was specifically referenced by the FBI's Executive Assistant Director Counterterrorism/Counterintelligence, John S. Pistole, in his formal report before the 9/11 Commission.\nJDL is suspected of being behind the 1972 bombing of the Manhattan offices of theater impresario Sol Hurok in which 1 employee was killed.\nViolent deaths.\nA number of senior JDL personnel and associates have died violently. Meir Kahane, the JDL's founding chairman, was assassinated in 1990 as was his son, Binyamin Ze'ev Kahane, in 2000. Long-time JDL chairman Irv Rubin died in 2002 in a Los Angeles federal detention center \"after allegedly cutting his throat with a jail-issued razor and then jumping or falling over a railing and plummeting to his death.\" Rubin's deputy, Earl Krugel, was murdered by a fellow prison inmate and white supremacist in 2005. Rubin's son and JDL vice-chairman Ari Rubin committed suicide in 2012.\nOrganization.\nChairs.\nAccording to the organization's official list of Chairmen or Highest Ranking Directors:\nSchism.\nAfter Rubin's death in prison in November 2002, Bill Maniaci was appointed interim chairman by Shelley Rubin. Two years later, the Jewish Defense League became mired in a state of upheaval over legal control of the organization. In October 2004, Maniaci rejected Shelley Rubin's call for him to resign; as a result, Maniaci was stripped of his title and membership. At that point, the JDL split into two separate factions, each vying for legal control of the associated \"intellectual property.\" The two operated as separate organizations with the same name while a lengthy legal battle ensued. In April 2005, the original domain name of the organization, \"jdl.org\", was suspended by Network Solutions due to allegations of infringement; the organization went back online soon thereafter at domain name \"jewishdefenseleague.org\". In April 2006, news of a settlement was announced in which signatories agreed to not object to \"Shelley Rubin's titles of permanent chairman and CEO of JDL.\" The agreement also confirmed that \"the name 'Jewish Defense League,' the acronym 'JDL,' and the 'Fist and Star' logo are the exclusive intellectual property of JDL.\" (Opponents of both groups claim that these are Kahanist symbols and not the exclusive property of JDL. At this time, however, the logo is no longer in general use by the Kahanist groups.) The agreement also states: \"Domain names registered on behalf of JDL, including but not limited to jdl.org and jewishdefenseleague.org, are owned and operated by JDL.\" Meanwhile, the opposing group formed B'nai Elim, which is the latest of many JDL splinter groups to have formed over the years (previous splinter groups included the Jewish Direct Action and the United Jewish Underground that have been active during the 1980s).\nPrinciples.\nThe JDL upholds five fundamental principles\nThe JDL encourages, per its principle of the \"Love of Jewry,\" that \"... in the end ... the Jew can look to no one but another Jew for help and that the true solution to the Jewish problem is the liquidation of the Exile and the return of all Jews to Eretz Yisroel \u2013 the land of Israel.\" The JDL elaborates on this fundamental principle by insisting upon an \"immediate need to place Judaism over any other 'ism' and ideology and ... use of the yardstick: 'Is it good for Jews?'\" The JDL argues that, outside of Jews, there are historically no people corresponding to the Palestinian ethnicity. Writing on its official website, the JDL claims: \"[T]he first mention of a 'Palestinian people' dates from the aftermath of the 1967 war, when the local Arabic-speaking communities ... were retrospectively endowed with a contrived 'nationhood' ... taken from Jewish history ...\" and that \"[c]learly, since Roman times 'Palestinian' had meant Jews until the Arab's recent adoption of this identity in order to claim it as their land.\" On this basis, the JDL argues that \"Zionism [should be] under no obligation to accommodate a separate 'Palestinian' claim, there being no historical evidence or witness for any such Arab category,\" and it considers Palestinian claims to be \"Arab usurpation\" of proper Jewish title.\nRelations with other groups.\nIn 1971, Kahane aligned the JDL with the Italian-American Civil Rights League, created the previous year by the Italian American mob boss Joseph Colombo, head of the Colombo crime family. In 2011, the Canadian JDL organized a \"support rally\" for the English Defence League (EDL) featuring a live speech, via Skype, by EDL leader Tommy Robinson. The event was denounced and condemned by the Canadian Jewish Congress (CJC) leader Bernie Farber and general counsel Benjamin Shinewald. The rally, held at the Toronto Zionist Centre, attracted a counter-protest organized by Anti-Racist Action (ARA) resulting in four ARA members being arrested. The JDL Canada has also organized rallies in support of right-wing Israeli politician Moshe Feiglin and Dutch politician and well-known Islam critic Geert Wilders of the Party for Freedom, and announced its support for the increasingly anti-Islamic Freedom Party of Austria.\nRav Yehuda HaKohen, a leader in the Hebrew Universalist VISION movement, is a former JDL member and has cited Kahanism as an inspiration behind his ideological beliefs.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Founded in 1936 by California Institute of Technology (Caltech) researchers, the laboratory is now owned and sponsored by NASA and administered and managed by Caltech.\nThe primary function of the laboratory is the construction and operation of planetary robotic spacecraft, though it also conducts Earth-orbit and astronomy missions. It is also responsible for operating the NASA Deep Space Network (DSN).\nAmong the major active projects at the laboratory, some are the Mars 2020 mission, which includes the \"Perseverance\" rover; the Mars Science Laboratory mission, including the \"Curiosity\" rover; the \"Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter\"; the \"Juno\" spacecraft orbiting Jupiter; the \"SMAP\" satellite for Earth surface soil moisture monitoring; the NuSTAR X-ray telescope; and the \"Psyche\" asteroid orbiter. It is also responsible for managing the JPL Small-Body Database, and provides physical data and lists of publications for all known small Solar System bodies.\nJPL's Space Flight Operations Facility and Twenty-Five-Foot Space Simulator are designated National Historic Landmarks.\nHistory.\nJPL traces its beginnings to 1936 in GALCIT (the Guggenheim Aeronautical Laboratory at the California Institute of Technology) when the first set of United States rocket experiments were carried out in the Arroyo Seco. This initial venture involved Caltech graduate students Frank Malina, Qian Xuesen, Weld Arnold and Apollo M. O. Smith, along with Jack Parsons and Edward S. Forman, often referred to as the \"Suicide Squad\" due to the dangerous nature of their experiments. Together, they tested a small, alcohol-fueled motor to gather data for Malina's graduate thesis. Malina's thesis advisor was engineer/aerodynamicist Theodore von K\u00e1rm\u00e1n, who eventually secured U.S. Army financial support for this \"GALCIT Rocket Project\" in 1939.\nRocketry beginnings.\nIn the early years of the project, work was primarily focused on the development of rocket technology. In 1941, Malina, Parsons, Forman, Martin Summerfield, and pilot Homer Bushey demonstrated the first jet-assisted takeoff (JATO) rockets to the Army. In 1943, von K\u00e1rm\u00e1n, Malina, Parsons, and Forman established the Aerojet Corporation to manufacture JATO rockets. The project took on the name Jet Propulsion Laboratory in November 1943, formally becoming an Army facility operated under contract by the university. In the same year, Qian and two of his colleagues drafted the first document to use the name Jet Propulsion Laboratory.\nIn a NASA conference on the history of early rocketry, Malina wrote that the work of the JPL was \"considered to include\" the research carried out by the GALCIT Rocket Research Group from 1936 on. In 1944, Parsons was expelled due to his \"unorthodox and unsafe working methods\" following one of several FBI investigations into his involvement with the occult, drugs and sexual promiscuity.\nDuring JPL's Army years, the laboratory developed two significant deployed weapon systems, the MGM-5 Corporal and MGM-29 Sergeant tactical ballistic missiles, marking the first US ballistic missiles developed at JPL. It also developed several other weapons system prototypes, such as the Loki anti-aircraft missile system, and the forerunner of the Aerobee sounding rocket. At various times, it carried out rocket testing at the White Sands Proving Ground, Edwards Air Force Base, and Goldstone, California.\nTransition to NASA.\nIn 1954, JPL teamed up with Wernher von Braun's engineers at the Army Ballistic Missile Agency's Redstone Arsenal in Huntsville, Alabama, to propose orbiting a satellite during the International Geophysical Year. The team lost that proposal to Project Vanguard, and instead embarked on a classified project to demonstrate ablative re-entry technology using a Jupiter-C rocket. They carried out three successful sub-orbital flights in 1956 and 1957. Using a spare Juno I (a modified Jupiter-C with a fourth stage), the two organizations then launched the United States' first satellite, Explorer 1, on January 31, 1958. This significant achievement marked a new era for JPL and the US in the space race.\nLess than a year later in December 1958, JPL was transferred to the newly formed National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). As a result of this transition, JPL became the agency's primary planetary spacecraft center, leading the design and operation of various lunar and interplanetary missions. The transfer to NASA marked the beginning of a \"Golden Age\" of planetary exploration for JPL in the 1960s and 1970s. JPL engineers designed and operated Ranger and Surveyor missions to the Moon that paved the way for the Apollo program. JPL proved itself a leader in interplanetary exploration with the Mariner missions to Venus, Mars, and Mercury, returning valuable data about our neighboring planets.\nNotably, JPL was early to employ female mathematicians. In the 1940s and 1950s, using mechanical calculators, women in an all-female computations group performed trajectory calculations. In 1961, JPL hired Dana Ulery as the first female engineer to work alongside male engineers as part of the Ranger and Mariner mission tracking teams.\nDeep space exploration.\nBuilding on the momentum from the successes of the 1960s and early 1970s, JPL initiated an era of deep space exploration in the late 1970s and 1980s. The highlight of this period was the launch of the twin Voyager spacecraft in 1977. \nInitially set on a trajectory to explore Jupiter and its moon Io, \"Voyager 1\"'s mission parameters were adjusted to also provide a close flyby of Saturn's moon Titan. The spacecraft sent back detailed images and data from both gas giants, revolutionizing the understanding of these distant worlds. The \"Voyager 2\" spacecraft followed a more extensive trajectory, conducting flybys of not just Jupiter and Saturn, but also Uranus and Neptune. These encounters provided firsthand data from all four gas giants, offering insights into the nature and dynamics of the outer planets. Both Voyager spacecraft, after fulfilling their primary mission objectives, were directed towards interstellar space, carrying with them the Golden Records \u2013 phonograph discs containing sounds and images selected to portray the diversity of life on Earth.\nThe 1980s also saw the inception of the \"Galileo\" mission which launched in the late 1980s. The \"Galileo\" spacecraft was designed to study Jupiter and its major moons in detail. Although the probe only entered the gas giant's orbit in the 1990s, its inception and planning during the 1980s signified JPL's continued commitment to deep space exploration.\nMars exploration.\nThe 1990s and 2000s saw a resurgence in Mars exploration, driven by JPL's Mars Pathfinder and Mars Exploration Rover missions. In 1997, the Mars Pathfinder mission deployed the first successful Mars rover, \"Sojourner\", demonstrating the feasibility of mobile exploration on the Martian surface. In 2004, the Mars Exploration Rovers, \"Spirit\" and \"Opportunity\", landed on Mars. \"Opportunity\" outlived its expected lifespan by 14 years, providing a wealth of scientific data and setting the stage for future Mars missions.\nEarth science and robotic exploration.\nIn the 2000s and 2010s, JPL broadened its exploration scope, including the launch of missions to study the outer planets, like the \"Juno\" mission to Jupiter and the \"Cassini-Huygens\" mission to Saturn. Concurrently, JPL also began to focus on Earth science missions, developing satellite technology to study climate change, weather patterns, and natural phenomena on Earth. JPL also opened the Near-Earth Object Program Office for NASA in 1998, which had found 95% of asteroids a kilometer or more in diameter that cross Earth's orbit by 2013.\nEntering the 2010s and 2020s, JPL continued its Mars exploration with the \"Curiosity\" rover and the Mars 2020 mission, which included the \"Perseverance\" rover and the \"Ingenuity\" helicopter. \"Perseverance\"'s core objective is to collect samples for a future Mars Sample Return (MSR) mission. In addition, JPL ventured into asteroid exploration with the OSIRIS-REx mission which returned a sample from asteroid Bennu.\n2020s and beyond.\nAs JPL moves forward, its focus remains on diverse interplanetary and even interstellar missions. Future Mars missions will aim to return the samples collected by the Perseverance rover back to Earth. Additionally, JPL's \"Europa Clipper\" mission launched in 2024 to study Jupiter's moon Europa, believed to harbor a subsurface ocean. Building on the Voyager program's success, JPL continues to push the boundaries of deep-space exploration. The Interstellar Probe concept, though not yet formalized, proposes to send a spacecraft ten times the distance from the Sun as Pluto, to explore the interstellar medium and the outermost reaches of the Solar System.\nJPL has been recognized four times by the Space Foundation: with the Douglas S. Morrow Public Outreach Award, which is given annually to an individual or organization that has made significant contributions to public awareness of space programs, in 1998; and with the John L. \"Jack\" Swigert, Jr., Award for Space Exploration on three occasions \u2013 in 2009 (as part of NASA's Phoenix Mars Lander Team), 2006 and 2005.\nIn January 2025, JPL was closed and evacuated due to the Eaton Fire raging in the nearby towns of Pasadena and Altadena, with operations like the DSN getting relocated offsite. Although the facility has not sustained damage from the wildfires, it has experienced minor wind damage and as well as numerous employees losing their homes.\nLocation.\nWhen it was founded, JPL's site was immediately west of a rocky flood-plain \u2013 the Arroyo Seco riverbed \u2013 above the Devil's Gate dam in the northwestern panhandle of the city of Pasadena in Southern California, near Los Angeles. While the first few buildings were constructed in land bought from the city of Pasadena, subsequent buildings were constructed in neighboring unincorporated land that later became part of La Ca\u00f1ada Flintridge. Nowadays, most of the of the U.S. federal government-owned NASA property that makes up the JPL campus is located in La Ca\u00f1ada Flintridge. Despite this, JPL still uses a Pasadena address (4800 Oak Grove Drive, Pasadena, CA 91109) as its official mailing address. There has been occasional rivalry between the two cities over the issue of which one should be mentioned in the media as the home of the laboratory.\nEmployees.\nAfter the 2024 layoffs, there are only approximately 5,500 full-time Caltech employees and contractors working on any given day. NASA also has a resident office at the facility staffed by federal managers who oversee JPL's activities and work for NASA. There are also some Caltech graduate students, college student interns and co-op students.\nJPL officially ended DEI hires and practices stemming from federal pressure in 2025 by removing its Chief Diversity Leader.\nEducation.\nThe JPL Education Office serves educators and students by providing them with activities, resources, materials and opportunities tied to NASA missions and science. The mission of its programs is to introduce and further students' interest in pursuing STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) careers.\nInternships and fellowships.\nJPL offers research, internship and fellowship opportunities in the summer and throughout the year to high school through postdoctoral and faculty students. (In most cases, students must be U.S. citizens or legal permanent residents to apply, although foreign nationals studying at U.S. universities are eligible for limited programs.) Interns are sponsored through NASA programs, university partnerships and JPL mentors for research opportunities at the laboratory in areas including technology, robotics, planetary science, aerospace engineering, and astrophysics.\nIn August 2013, JPL was named one of \"The 10 Most Awesome College Labs of 2013\" by Popular Science, which noted that about 100 students who intern at the laboratory are considered for permanent jobs at JPL after they graduate.\nThe JPL Education Office also hosts the Planetary Science Summer School (PSSS), an annual week-long workshop for graduate and postdoctoral students. The program involves a one-week team design exercise developing an early mission concept study, working with JPL's Advanced Projects Design Team (\"Team X\") and other concurrent engineering teams.\nMuseum &amp; Informal Education Alliance Alliance.\nJPL created the NASA Museum Alliance in 2003 out of a desire to provide museums, planetariums, visitor centers and other kinds of informal educators with exhibit materials, professional development and information related to the then-upcoming landings of the Mars rovers \"Spirit\" and \"Opportunity\". The Alliance now has more than 500 members, who get access to NASA displays, models, educational workshops and networking opportunities through the program. Staff at educational organizations that meet the Museum Alliance requirements can register to participate online.\nThe Museum Alliance is a subset of the JPL Education Office's Informal Education group, which also serves after-school and summer programs, parents and other kinds of informal educators.\nOn https://, the Museum Alliance officially announced a rebrand to the Museum &amp; Informal Education (MIE) Alliance. In an announcement to members, they said, \"Pronounced 'My' Alliance, our new name better reflects the diversity of organizations you represent.\"\nEducator Resource Center.\nThe NASA/JPL Educator Resource Center, which is moving from its location at the Indian Hill Mall in Pomona, California, at the end of 2013, offers resources, materials and free workshops for formal and informal educators covering science, technology, engineering and science topics related to NASA missions and science.\nKeck Institute for Space Studies.\nIn 2008, Caltech and JPL jointly established the Keck Institute for Space Studies (KISS), an interdisciplinary think tank designed to foster early-stage innovation in space science and engineering. Based at Caltech, KISS organizes intensive study programs that bring together researchers from JPL, Caltech, and experts in specialized fields from a range of institutes to explore and implement mission concepts and technologies for space exploration and technology. Centered on the research and instrumentation strengths of Caltech and JPL, KISS convenes experts from academia, government, and industry to develop new mission concepts in planetary science, Earth science, and astrophysics. The institute also engages graduate students and postdoctoral researchers in its studies and promotes public outreach through lectures and online dissemination. While KISS does not directly manage space missions, several of its studies have seeded proposals that evolved into JPL-led projects for NASA.\nSome of the JPL missions influenced by KISS include:\nOpen house.\nThe lab had an open house once a year on a Saturday and Sunday in May or June, when the public was invited to tour the facilities and see live demonstrations of JPL science and technology. More limited private tours are also available throughout the year if scheduled well in advance. Thousands of schoolchildren from Southern California and elsewhere visit the lab every year. Due to federal spending cuts mandated by budget sequestration, the open house has been previously cancelled. JPL open house for 2014 was October 11 and 12 and 2015 was October 10 and 11. Starting from 2016, JPL replaced the annual Open House with \"Ticket to Explore JPL\", which features the same exhibits but requires tickets and advance reservation. Roboticist and Mars rover driver Vandi Verma frequently acts as science communicator at open house type events to encourage children (and particularly girls) into STEM careers.\nOther works.\nIn addition to its government work, JPL has also assisted the nearby motion picture and television industries, by advising them about scientific accuracy in their productions. Science fiction shows advised by JPL include \"Babylon 5\" and its sequel series, \"Crusade\".\nJPL also works with the Department of Homeland Security Science and Technology Directorate (DHS-S&amp;T). JPL and DHS-S&amp;T developed a search and rescue tool for first responders called FINDER. First responders can use FINDER to locate people still alive who are buried in rubble after a disaster or terrorist attack. FINDER uses microwave radar to detect breathing and pulses.\nAdditionally, JPL is home to the JPL-RPIF (Jet Propulsion Laboratory \u2013 Regional Planetary Image Facility) which is chartered as a repository for all robotic spacecraft hard-copy data and thus provides a valuable resource to NASA funded science investigators, and an important conduit for the distribution of NASA generated materials to local educators in the Los Angeles/southern California area.\nFunding.\nThe predominant source of JPL's financial support is NASA. As a field center of NASA, JPL's primary activities and projects are generally aligned with NASA's mission objectives in space exploration, Earth sciences, and astrophysics. The funding allocated to JPL comes as a portion of NASA's annual budget, which is itself part of the United States federal budget approved by Congress. The scale of the budget is contingent on the projects that JPL undertakes as missions can range from flagship interplanetary missions costing billions of U.S. dollars to smaller Earth observation systems with budgets in the hundreds of millions.\nAside from NASA, JPL secures funding for specialized projects from other federal agencies, including but not limited to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) the United States Geological Survey (USGS), and the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD). Occasionally, JPL engages in joint missions or research endeavors with international space agencies or research institutions. While these partnerships contribute a relatively small portion of JPL's overall budget, they serve to enhance the scope and impact of its scientific research and technological development.\nThe total budget for JPL is subject to annual fluctuations based on both the federal allocation to NASA and the life cycle of ongoing projects. High-profile missions may receive significant long-term funding commitments, whereas smaller or shorter-term projects may have more modest financial support. These agencies often commission projects that leverage JPL's unique expertise in areas like remote sensing, robotics, and systems engineering. Although these projects form a smaller part of JPL's overall budget, they are integral to fulfilling the diverse set of objectives that these federal agencies oversee.\nIn fiscal year 2022, the laboratory's budget was approximately $2.4 billion, with the largest share going to Planetary Science development.\nIn February and November 2024, due to the overall budget situation and budget shifts in Mars Sample Return (MSR), the institute laid off approximately 1000 employees and contractors.\nPeanuts tradition.\nThere is a tradition at JPL to eat \"lucky peanuts\" before critical mission events, such as launches, orbital insertions, or landings. As the story goes, after the Ranger program had experienced failure after failure during the 1960s, the first successful Ranger mission to impact the Moon occurred after either the Ranger 7 project manager, Harris \"Bud\" Schurmeier, or the mission trajectory engineer, Dick Wallace, had decided to pass out peanuts to relieve tension. The staff jokingly decided that the peanuts must have been a good luck charm, and the tradition persisted.\nMissions.\nThese are some of the missions partially sponsored by JPL:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nList of directors.\nAll of the lab directors hold doctorates in engineering, physics, geology, geochemistry or planetary science. Acting/interim directors tend to be retired military officers with a strong science and organizational background.\nTeam X.\nThe JPL Advanced Projects Design Team, also known as Team X, is an interdisciplinary team of engineers that utilizes \"concurrent engineering methodologies to complete rapid design, analysis and evaluation of mission concept designs\".\nControversies.\nEmployee background check lawsuit.\nOn February 25, 2005, Homeland Security Presidential Directive 12 was approved by the Secretary of Commerce. This was followed by Federal Information Processing Standards 201 (FIPS 201), which specified how the federal government should implement personal identity verification. These specifications led to a need for rebadging to meet the updated requirements.\nOn August 30, 2007, a group of JPL employees filed suit in federal court against NASA, Caltech, and the Department of Commerce, claiming their constitutional rights were being violated by the new, overly invasive background investigations. 97% of JPL employees were classified at the low-risk level and would be subjected to the same clearance procedures as those obtaining moderate/high risk clearance. Under HSPD 12 and FIPS 201, investigators have the right to obtain any information on employees, which includes questioning acquaintances on the status of the employee's mental, emotional, and financial stability. Additionally, if employees depart JPL before the end of the two-year validity of the background check, no investigation ability is terminated; former employees can still be legally monitored.\nEmployees were told that if they did not sign an unlimited waiver of privacy, they would be deemed to have \"voluntarily resigned\". The United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit found the process violated the employees' privacy rights and issued a preliminary injunction. NASA appealed and the US Supreme Court granted certiorari on March 8, 2010. On January 19, 2011, the Supreme Court overturned the Ninth Circuit decision, ruling that the background checks did not violate any constitutional privacy right that the employees may have had.\n\"Coppedge v Jet Propulsion Laboratory\".\nOn March 12, 2012, the Los Angeles Superior Court took opening statements on the case in which former JPL employee David Coppedge brought suit against the lab due to workplace discrimination and wrongful termination. In the suit, Coppedge alleges that he first lost his \"team lead\" status on JPL's \"Cassini-Huygens\" mission in 2009 and then was fired in 2011 because of his evangelical Christian beliefs and specifically his belief in intelligent design. Conversely, JPL, through the Caltech lawyers representing the laboratory, allege that Coppedge's termination was simply due to budget cuts and his demotion from team lead was because of harassment complaints and from on-going conflicts with his co-workers. Superior Court Judge Ernest Hiroshige issued a final ruling in favor of JPL on January 16, 2013.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He performed on the band's 1974 debut album, but left shortly after its release due to health problems which limited his ability to tour with the band. He was subsequently replaced by Neil Peart, who remained Rush's drummer for the rest of its active history until 2015, and was replaced postmortem by Anika Nilles for Rush's 2026 reunion.\nBiography.\nPersonal life.\nRutsey was the son of \"Toronto Telegram\" crime reporter Howard Rutsey. He had an older brother named Bill, and a younger brother named Mike who became a baseball writer. Following the death of their father by heart attack, the brothers were raised by their mother, Eva.\nRutsey was a student at St. Patrick\u2019s School, and it was there that he met Gary Weinrib and Alex Zivojinovich (who would later change their names to Geddy Lee and Alex Lifeson respectively). Whereas Lee and Lifeson were listening to progressive rock bands such as Yes, Pink Floyd and Genesis at that time, Rutsey drew more inspiration from the harder styles of bands such as Bad Company.\nFormation of Rush.\nRutsey and Lifeson became close friends while attending St. Patrick\u2019s School, and the pair would play street hockey together in their neighborhood. Both were interested in rock music, and talked often about forming a band. Together, they initially were members of the bands The Projection with Bill Fitzgerald and \"Doc\" Cooper. Eventually their mutual school friend, Geddy Lee, joined them and the earliest version of Rush was formed.\nRutsey's commitment has been credited with providing the band's early direction, as it was he who took the band most seriously and would insist on regular practice sessions. According to Ian Grandy, a member of the band's early road crew, \"I've said it before and I'll say it again: There would have been no 'Rush' without John.\" At Rutsey's suggestion, Rush was initially a glam rock band. \"John led the guys as far as being 'glam rockers', with really flashy jackets and pants, and eight-inch high boots\", according to Grandy. \"One time, he was speaking to me at the Gasworks and I said, 'Didn't we used to be the same height (5'8\")?' He laughed and said 'Well, maybe a long time ago!'\"\nIt was Rutsey's brother, Bill, who came up with the name Rush for the band during a rehearsal in the Rutsey family basement in mid 1968.\nCareer.\nThe band formed with Rutsey on drums, Lifeson on guitars, and Jeff Jones on vocals and bass, but after their first concert Jones left and was succeeded by Lee. During these early years, Rutsey played on the \"Not Fade Away\"/\"You Can't Fight It\" single as well as the debut album \"Rush\".\nLee and Lifeson have each acknowledged that during the writing and recording sessions for the band's debut album, Rutsey was given the role of chief lyricist. When the time came to start recording, however, he did not deliver any lyrics. In interviews, Lee and Lifeson have both said that Rutsey was dissatisfied with what he had written and had torn up the lyric sheets. Lee hastily wrote the lyrics to all the songs before recording the vocal tracks. When Rush performed live, Rutsey was the one who would introduce the band members to the audience, and tell them the name of the song before they would perform it.\nSoon after Rush released its debut album, Rutsey left the band, due to musical differences, health concerns related to diabetes, and his general distaste for touring. Rutsey's final performance with the group was on July 25, 1974, at Centennial Hall in London, Ontario. He was replaced by Neil Peart.\nLater life.\nLifeson stated in a 1989 interview that he still often had seen Rutsey, and after leaving the band Rutsey went into bodybuilding. Lifeson remarked, \"He competed on an amateur level for a while, doing that for a few years, and has sort of been in and out of that, but he still works out, and I work out with him a few times a week at a local gym \u2013 at a Gold's, here in Toronto.\" In 2005, Lifeson said that he had not seen Rutsey since around 1990.\nDeath.\nOn May 11, 2008, Rutsey died in his sleep of an apparent heart attack, related to complications from diabetes. Rutsey's family wished to keep the funeral a private affair, although donations would be sent to the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation in Markham, Ontario.\nAftermath.\nAfter Rutsey's death, Lee and Lifeson released this statement: \"Our memories of the early years of Rush when John was in the band are very fond to us. Those years spent in our teens dreaming of one day doing what we continue to do decades later are special. Although our paths diverged many years ago, we smile today, thinking back on those exciting times and remembering John's wonderful sense of humour and impeccable timing. He will be deeply missed by all he touched.\"\nRutsey's part in the band's early history is acknowledged in the 2010 documentary '. Tape-recorded comments from him are heard during the film, and the DVD release includes two performances with him on drums in its bonus features. A third performance is included as a bonus feature on the ' home video release.\nDiscography.\nSingle:\nStudio album:\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "16467", "revid": "5605596", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=16467", "title": "John Walker Lindh", "text": "American Taliban member (born 1981)\nJohn Philip Walker Lindh (born February 9, 1981) is an American Taliban member who was captured by United States forces as an enemy combatant during the United States' invasion of Afghanistan in November 2001. He was detained at Qala-i-Jangi fortress, which was used as a prison. He denied participating in the Battle of Qala-i-Jangi, a violent uprising of the Taliban prisoners, stating that he was wounded in the leg and hid in the cellar of the Pink House, in the southern half of the fort. He was one of the 86 prisoners who survived the uprising, from an estimated 400 prisoners in total. CIA officer Johnny Micheal Spann was killed during that uprising. Brought to trial in United States federal court in February 2002, Lindh accepted a plea bargain; he pleaded guilty to two charges and was sentenced to 20 years in prison. He was released on parole on May 23, 2019, for a three-year period of supervised release.\nA convert to Sunni Islam in California at age 16, Lindh traveled to Yemen in 1998 to study Arabic and stayed there for 10 months. He later returned in 2000, then went to Afghanistan to aid the Taliban in fighting against the Afghan Northern Alliance. He received training at Al-Farouq, a training camp associated with al-Qaeda, designated a terrorist organization by the United States and other countries. While at the camp, he attended a lecture by Osama bin Laden. After the September 11 attacks, he remained with the Taliban military forces despite learning that the U.S. had become allied with the Northern Alliance. Lindh had previously received training with Harkat-ul-Mujahideen, an internationally designated terrorist organization based in Pakistan.\nLindh went by the name Sulayman al-Faris during his time in Afghanistan but prefers the name Abu Sulayman al-Irlandi today. In early reports following his capture, when the press learned that he was a US citizen, he was usually referred to by the news media as just \"John Walker\".\nYouth, conversion, and travels.\nLindh was born in Washington, D.C., to Marilyn Walker and Frank R. Lindh, as the middle of three children in the family. He was named \"John\" after John Lennon, who was murdered two months before Lindh's birth. He was baptized a Catholic, and grew up in Silver Spring, Maryland. When he was 10 years old, his family moved to San Anselmo, California. Lindh suffered from an intestinal disorder as a child. At age 14, his health improved. He enrolled at Redwood High School as a freshman. He then transferred to Tamiscal High School in the Tamalpais Union High School District, an alternative school offering self-directed, individualized study programs. While there, he studied world culture, including Sunni Islam and the Middle East.\nLindh dropped out of the school and eventually earned an equivalent of a high school diploma by passing the California High School Proficiency Exam at age 16. As an adolescent, Lindh participated in IRC chatrooms with the IRC nickname Mujahid. He became a devoted fan of hip-hop music and engaged in extensive discussions on Usenet newsgroups, sometimes pretending to be an African-American rapper who would criticize others for \"acting black\". Spike Lee's film \"Malcolm X\" impressed him deeply and sparked his interest in Islam.\nAlthough his parents did not divorce until 1999, their marriage was in serious trouble throughout Lindh's adolescence. His father often left their Marin residence for extended periods to live in San Francisco with a male lover. Frank Lindh said he and Marilyn had been separated since 1997. Also in 1997, at the age of 16, Lindh converted to Islam. He began regularly attending mosques in Mill Valley and later in nearby San Francisco.\nIn 1998, Lindh traveled to Yemen and stayed for about 10 months to learn Arabic so that he could read the Qur'an in its original language. He returned to the United States in 1999, living with his family for about eight months. Lindh returned to Yemen in February 2000 and left for Pakistan to study at a \"madrasa\". While abroad, Lindh exchanged numerous emails with his family. In one, his father told him about the USS \"Cole\" bombing, to which Lindh replied that the American naval destroyers being in the Yemen harbor had been an act of war, and that the bombing was justified. His father told \"Newsweek\": \"This raised my concerns, but my days of molding him were over.\"\nAt the age of 20, Lindh decided to travel to Afghanistan to fight for the Afghan Taliban government forces against Northern Alliance fighters. His parents said that he was moved by stories of atrocities allegedly perpetrated by the Northern Alliance army against civilians. He traveled to Afghanistan in May 2001. Tony West, his lawyer, explained it as follows: \"One of the first things he told Army interrogators when they questioned him on December 3, 2001, was that after 9/11 happened, he wanted to leave the front lines but could not for fear of his life. John never wanted to be in a position where he was opposing the United States (and never thought he would be), and in fact he never opposed any American military.\"\nCapture and interrogation.\nLindh surrendered on November 24, 2001, to Afghan Northern Alliance forces after his Al Qaeda foreign fighters unit surrendered at Kunduz after retreating from Takar. He and other fighters were to be questioned by the CIA officers Johnny \"Mike\" Spann and David Tyson at General Dostum's military garrison, Qala-i-Jangi, near Maz\u0101r-e Shar\u012bf. During the initial questioning, Lindh was not advised of his rights and his request for a lawyer was denied.\nLindh, who had a grandmother from County Donegal, had told other prisoners he was Irish. While being interviewed by the CIA, he did not speak or reveal that he was American. Spann asked Lindh, \"Are you a member of the IRA?\" He was asked this question because, when questioned by Spann, an Iraqi in the group identified Lindh as an English speaker. Lindh had been told to say he was \"Irish\" to avoid problems. Moments later, around 11\u00a0am, the makeshift prison was the scene of a violent uprising, which became known as the Battle of Qala-i-Jangi. Spann and hundreds of foreign fighters were killed; only 86 prisoners survived. According to other detainees interviewed by journalist Robert Young Pelton for CNN, Lindh was fully aware of the planned uprising, yet remained silent and did not cooperate with the Americans.\nSometime during the initial uprising, Lindh was shot or hit by shrapnel in the right upper thigh and found refuge in a basement, hiding with the rest of the detainees. On the second day, the Red Cross sent in workers to collect the dead. As soon as they entered, the workers were shot by the prisoners, who killed one. The Northern Alliance repeatedly bombarded the area with RPGs and grenade attacks, and burning fuel poured in. Finally, on December 2, 2001, Northern Alliance forces diverted an irrigation stream into the middle of the camp to flush the remaining prisoners out of their underground shelters, drowning many in the process. Lindh and about 85 survivors from the original 300\u2013500 were forced out of hiding. Northern Alliance soldiers bound Lindh's elbows behind his back.\nShortly after his recapture, Lindh was noticed and interviewed by Robert Pelton, who was working as a stringer for CNN. Lindh initially gave his name as \"Abd-al-Hamid\" but later gave his birth name. Pelton brought a medic and food for Lindh and interviewed him about how he got there. During the interview, Lindh said that he was a member of al-Ansar, a group of Arabic-speaking fighters financed by Osama bin Laden. Lindh said that the prison uprising was sparked by some of the prisoners smuggling grenades into the basement: \"This is against what we had agreed upon with the Northern Alliance, and this is against Islam. It is a major sin to break a contract, especially in military situations\". A U.S. Army Special Forces operator, fresh from three weeks of combat, gave up his bed so that the wounded Lindh could sleep there. Pelton repeatedly asked Lindh if he wanted to call his parents or have the journalist do so but Lindh declined. Although Lindh was not tested for explosives or firearms residue before he was washed, an FBI source later told author Toby Harnden that dark stains on the right side of Lindh's face indicated he had fired a weapon at Qala-i Jangi.\nAfter capture, Lindh was given basic first aid and questioned for a week at Maz\u0101r-e Shar\u012bf. He was taken to Camp Rhino on December 7, 2001, the bullet or piece of shrapnel still within his thigh. When Lindh arrived at Camp Rhino, he was stripped and restrained on a stretcher, blindfolded and placed in a metal shipping container, which was procedure for dealing with a potentially dangerous detainee associated with a terrorist organization. On the day he left the Turkish School, he was photographed with the words \"Shit Head\" written onto duct tape on his blindfold by Green Berets posing for a \"team photo\" with their captive. The Green Berets, from ODA 592, were later investigated. While bound to the stretcher at Camp Rhino, Lindh was photographed by some American military personnel. At Camp Rhino, he was given oxycodone/paracetamol for pain and diazepam.\nOn December 8 and 9, he was interviewed by the FBI, and was mirandized on December 9 or 10. He was held at Camp Rhino until he was transferred to the on December 14, 2001, with other wounded detainees, where his wound was operated on and he received further care. He was interrogated before the operation on December 14. While on the \"Peleliu\", he signed confession documents while in the custody of the United States Marine Corps. On December 31, 2001, Lindh was transferred to the USS \"Bataan\", where he was held until January 22, 2002. He was flown back to the United States to face criminal charges. On January 16, 2002, Attorney General John Ashcroft announced that Lindh would be tried in the United States.\nIn 2002, former President George H. W. Bush referred to Lindh as \"some misguided Marin County hot-tubber\". The comment, in which Bush also mispronounced the county's name, provoked a minor furor and prompted a retraction of the statement by Bush. Lindh's attorneys told the press that his client had asked for a lawyer repeatedly before being interviewed by the FBI, but did not get one, and that \"highly coercive\" prison conditions forced Lindh to waive his right to remain silent. Although the FBI asked Jesselyn Radack, a Justice Department ethics adviser, whether Lindh could be questioned without a lawyer present, they did not follow her advice to avoid that scenario.\nTrial and sentencing.\nOn February 5, 2002, Lindh was indicted by a federal grand jury on ten charges:\nIf convicted of these charges, Lindh could have received up to three life sentences and 90 additional years in prison. On February 13, 2002, he pleaded not guilty to all 10 charges.\nThe court scheduled an evidence suppression hearing, at which Lindh would have been able to testify about the details of the torture to which he claimed he was subjected. The government faced the problem that a key piece of evidence \u2014 Lindh's confession \u2014 might be excluded from evidence as having been coerced. Michael Chertoff, then-head of the Criminal Division of the U.S. Department of Justice, then directed the prosecutors to offer Lindh a plea bargain. Lindh could plead guilty to two charges: supplying services to the Taliban (\u00a0https://, \u00a0https://, 31 CFR 545.204, and 31 CFR 545.206) and carrying an explosive during the commission of a felony (\u00a0https://). He would have to consent to a gag order that would prevent him from making any public statements on the matter for the duration of his 20-year sentence, and he would have to drop any claims that he had been mistreated or tortured by U.S. military personnel in Afghanistan and aboard two military ships during December 2001 and January 2002. In return, all other charges would be dropped. The gag order was said to be at the request of Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld.\nLindh accepted this offer. On July 15, 2002, he entered his plea of guilty to the two remaining charges. The judge asked Lindh to say, in his own words, what he was admitting to: \"I plead guilty. I provided my services as a soldier to the Taliban last year from about August to December. In the course of doing so, I carried a rifle and two grenades. I did so knowingly and willingly knowing that it was illegal.\" Lindh said that he \"went to Afghanistan with the intention of fighting against terrorism and oppression\", fighting for the suffering of ordinary people at the hands of the Northern Alliance. On October 4, 2002, Judge T.S. Ellis III imposed a sentence of 20 years in federal prison.\nSome activists and academics called for Lindh to tell his story. The government invoked the Son of Sam law and informed Lindh that any and all profits made from book deals or any movies about Lindh's experience would be automatically transferred to the federal government. Lindh, his family, his relatives, his associates and his friends will be unable to profit financially from his crimes and/or experiences. Lindh's attorney, James Brosnahan, said Lindh would be eligible for release in 17 years, with good behavior. Lindh agreed to cooperate \"fully, truthfully and completely\" with both military intelligence and law enforcement agencies in the terrorism investigation.\nImprisonment.\nIn January 2003, Lindh was sent to the U.S. Penitentiary, Victorville, a high-security facility northeast of Los Angeles. On March 3, 2003, Lindh was tackled by inmate Richard Dale Morrison. He assaulted Lindh at prayer, causing bruises on his forehead. On July 2, 2003, Morrison was charged with a misdemeanor count of assault. Lindh was held in federal Supermax ADX Florence in Florence, Colorado for a short time. He served his sentence as prisoner 45426-083, at the Federal Correctional Institution at Terre Haute, Indiana in the Communication Management Unit.\nIn April 2007, citing the reduced sentence for the Australian prisoner David Matthew Hicks, Lindh's attorneys made a public plea for a presidential commutation to lessen his 20-year sentence. In January 2009, the Lindh family's petition for clemency was denied by President George W. Bush in one of his final acts in office. According to the U.S. Department of Justice, all \"special administrative measures\" in place against Lindh expired on March 20, 2009, as part of a gradual easing of restrictions on him.\nIn 2010, Lindh and the Syrian-American prisoner Enaam Arnaout sued to lift restrictions on group prayer by Muslim inmates in the Communication Management Unit. On January 11, 2013, a federal judge ruled in their favor, saying that the government had shown no compelling interest in restricting the religious speech of the inmates by prohibiting them from praying together.\nIn 2013, Lindh secured Irish citizenship through his paternal grandmother, Kathleen Maguire, who was born in Donegal.\nIn February 2015, Lindh wrote to a California television producer, expressing support for ISIS or the Islamic State, the militant group that had recently beheaded five Westerners in televised executions. Asked if he supported the Islamic State, Lindh, now calling himself \"Yahya\", Arabic for John, replied in a handwritten letter: \"Yes, and they are doing a spectacular job. The Islamic State is clearly very sincere and serious about fulfilling the long-neglected religious obligation of establishing a caliphate through armed struggle, which is the only correct method\".\nIn 2017, \"Foreign Policy magazine\" reported an internal report by the National Counterterrorism Center asserted Lindh told a visiting television news producer that he had not renounced extremist violence. Lindh was interviewed for the 2016 book \"The Way of the Strangers: Encounters With the Islamic State\" by Graeme Wood, on the condition that Wood provide Lindh with \"books, treatises, articles, or other writings produced by leaders of the Islamic State and/or scholars affiliated with it (preferably in the original Arabic)\". Upon sending the package of literature was blocked from delivery by the prison as it was deemed contraband; however, Lindh decided to continue corresponding with Wood, although Lindh later ended the correspondence by saying he was personally a \"layman\" whose opinions had \"no consequence\", referring to his knowledge of the Islamic State.\nRelease.\nOn May 23, 2019, Lindh was released early for good behavior from the Terre Haute, Indiana, federal prison prior to the end of his twenty-year sentence, although he accepted several probation requirements due to his continued support of Islamist ideology. These requirements included a ban from internet use and contact with fellow extremists. The probation lasted for the remaining three years of his sentence. President Donald Trump and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo were among many who criticized the release but Trump said: \"From a legal standpoint, there's nothing we're allowed to do.\"\nIn 2021, Lindh was observed by the FBI in several meetings with Ali Shukri Amin, who had recently been released from prison after being convicted in 2015 for conspiracy to provide material support for terrorism for his support for ISIL. This could have constituted a violation of the terms of Lindh's parole, which prohibited communication with other extremists; however, federal prosecutors chose not to pursue it. However, Amin was cited for violation of the terms of his release and sent back to prison.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The Northern Hemisphere and the Southern Hemisphere each have a polar jet around their respective polar vortex at around above sea level and typically travelling at around although often considerably faster. Closer to the equator, somewhat higher and somewhat weaker, is a subtropical jet. \nThe northern polar jet flows over the middle to northern latitudes of North America, Europe, and Asia and their intervening oceans, while the southern hemisphere polar jet mostly circles Antarctica. Jet streams may start, stop, split into two or more parts, combine into one stream, or flow in various directions including opposite to the direction of the remainder of the jet. \nThe El Ni\u00f1o\u2013Southern Oscillation affects the location of the jet streams, which in turn affects the weather over the tropical Pacific Ocean and affects the climate of much of the tropics and subtropics, and can affect weather in higher-latitude regions. The term \"jet stream\" is also applied to some other winds at varying levels in the atmosphere, some global (such as the higher-level polar-night jet), some local (such as the African easterly jet). Meteorologists use the location of some of the jet streams as an aid in weather forecasting. Airlines use them to reduce some flight times and fuel consumption. Scientists have considered whether the jet streams might be harnessed for power generation. In World War II, the Japanese used the jet stream to carry Fu-Go balloon bombs across the Pacific Ocean to launch small attacks on North America.\nJet streams have been detected in the atmospheres of Venus, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune.\nDiscovery.\nThe first indications of this phenomenon came from American professor Elias Loomis (1811\u20131889), when he proposed the hypothesis of a powerful air current in the upper air blowing west to east across the United States as an explanation for the behaviour of major storms. After the 1883 eruption of the Krakatoa volcano, weather watchers tracked and mapped the effects on the sky over several years. They labelled the phenomenon the \"equatorial smoke stream\". In the 1920s Japanese meteorologist Wasaburo Oishi detected the jet stream from a site near Mount Fuji. He tracked pilot balloons (\"pibals\"), used to measure wind speed and direction, as they rose in the air. Oishi's work largely went unnoticed outside Japan because it was published in Esperanto, though chronologically he has to be credited for the scientific discovery of jet streams. American pilot Wiley Post (1898\u20131935), the first man to fly around the world solo in 1933, is often given some credit for discovery of jet streams. Post invented a pressurized suit that let him fly above . In the year before his death, Post made several attempts at a high-altitude transcontinental flight, and noticed that at times his ground speed greatly exceeded his air speed.\nGerman meteorologist Heinrich Seilkopf is credited with coining a special term, \"Strahlstr\u00f6mung\" (literally \"jet current\"), for the phenomenon in 1939. Many sources credit real understanding of the nature of jet streams to regular and repeated flight-path traversals during World War II. Flyers consistently noticed westerly tailwinds in excess of in flights, for example, from the US to the UK. Similarly in 1944 a team of American meteorologists in Guam, including Reid Bryson, had enough observations to forecast very high west winds that would slow bombers raiding Japan.\nDescription.\nThe polar and subtropical jet streams are the product of two factors: the atmospheric heating by solar radiation that produces the large-scale polar, Ferrel, and Hadley circulation cells, and the action of the Coriolis force acting on those moving masses. The Coriolis force is caused by the planet's rotation on its axis. The polar jet stream forms near the interface of the polar and Ferrel circulation cells; the subtropical jet forms near the boundary of the Ferrel and Hadley circulation cells.\nPolar jet streams are typically located near the 250 hPa (about 1/4 atmosphere) pressure level, or ( according to engineeringtoolbox's equation, 250 hPa is 33,700ft, not 30,000 ft ) above sea level while the weaker subtropical jet streams are somewhat higher.\nThe polar jets, at lower altitude, and often intruding into mid-latitudes, strongly affect weather and aviation. The polar jet stream is most commonly found between latitudes 30\u00b0 and 60\u00b0 (closer to 60\u00b0), while the subtropical jet streams are located close to latitude 30\u00b0. These two jets merge at some locations and times, while at other times they are well separated. The northern polar jet stream is said to \"follow the sun\" as it slowly migrates northward as that hemisphere warms, and southward again as it cools.\nThe width of a jet stream is typically a few hundred kilometres or miles and its vertical thickness often less than .\nJet streams are typically continuous over long distances, but discontinuities are also common. The path of the jet typically has a meandering shape, and these meanders themselves propagate eastward, at lower speeds than that of the actual wind within the flow. Further, the meanders can split or form eddies.\nEach large meander, or wave, within the jet stream is known as a Rossby wave (planetary wave). Rossby waves are caused by changes in the Coriolis effect with latitude. Shortwave troughs, are smaller scale waves superimposed on the Rossby waves, with a scale of long, that move along through the flow pattern around large scale, or longwave, \"ridges\" and \"troughs\" within Rossby waves.\nThe wind speeds are greatest where temperature differences between air masses are greatest, and often exceed . Speeds of have been measured.\nThe jet stream moves from west to east bringing changes of weather. The path of jet streams affects cyclonic storm systems at lower levels in the atmosphere, and so knowledge of their course has become an important part of weather forecasting. For example, in 2007 and 2012, Britain experienced severe flooding as a result of the polar jet staying south for the summer.\nCause.\nIn general, winds are strongest immediately under the tropopause (except locally, during tornadoes, tropical cyclones or other anomalous situations). If two air masses of different temperatures or densities meet, the resulting pressure difference caused by the density difference (which ultimately causes wind) is highest within the transition zone. The wind does not flow directly from the hot to the cold area, but is deflected by the Coriolis effect and flows along the boundary of the two air masses.\nAll these facts are consequences of the thermal wind relation. The balance of forces acting on an atmospheric air parcel in the vertical direction is primarily between the gravitational force acting on the mass of the parcel and the buoyancy force, or the difference in pressure between the top and bottom surfaces of the parcel. Any imbalance between these forces results in the acceleration of the parcel in the imbalance direction: upward if the buoyant force exceeds the weight, and downward if the weight exceeds the buoyancy force. The balance in the vertical direction is referred to as hydrostatic. Beyond the tropics, the dominant forces act in the horizontal direction, and the primary struggle is between the Coriolis force and the pressure gradient force. Balance between these two forces is referred to as geostrophic. Given both hydrostatic and geostrophic balance, one can derive the thermal wind relation: the vertical gradient of the horizontal wind is proportional to the horizontal temperature gradient. If two air masses in the northern hemisphere, one cold and dense to the north and the other hot and less dense to the south, are separated by a vertical boundary and that boundary should be removed, the difference in densities will result in the cold air mass slipping under the hotter and less dense air mass. The Coriolis effect will then cause poleward-moving mass to deviate to the East, while equatorward-moving mass will deviate toward the west. The general trend in the atmosphere is for temperatures to decrease in the poleward direction. As a result, winds develop an eastward component and that component grows with altitude. Therefore, the strong eastward moving jet streams are in part a simple consequence of the fact that the Equator is warmer than the north and south poles.\nPolar jet stream.\nThe thermal wind relation does not explain why the winds are organized into tight jets, rather than distributed more broadly over the hemisphere. One factor that contributes to the creation of a concentrated polar jet is the undercutting of sub-tropical air masses by the more dense polar air masses at the polar front. This causes a sharp north\u2013south pressure (south\u2013north potential vorticity) gradient in the horizontal plane, an effect which is most significant during double Rossby wave breaking events. At high altitudes, lack of friction allows air to respond freely to the steep pressure gradient with low pressure at high altitude over the pole. This results in the formation of planetary wind circulations that experience a strong Coriolis deflection and thus can be considered 'quasi-geostrophic'. The polar front jet stream is closely linked to the frontogenesis process in midlatitudes, as the acceleration/deceleration of the air flow induces areas of low/high pressure respectively, which link to the formation of cyclones and anticyclones along the polar front in a relatively narrow region.\nSubtropical jet.\nA second factor which contributes to a concentrated jet is more applicable to the subtropical jet which forms at the poleward limit of the tropical Hadley cell, and to first order this circulation is symmetric with respect to longitude. Tropical air rises to the tropopause, and moves poleward before sinking; this is the Hadley cell circulation. As it does so it tends to conserve angular momentum, since friction with the ground is slight. Air masses that begin moving poleward are deflected eastward by the Coriolis force (true for either hemisphere), which for poleward moving air implies an increased westerly component of the winds.\nEffects.\nHurricane protection.\nThe subtropical jet stream rounding the base of the mid-oceanic upper trough is thought to be one of the causes most of the Hawaiian Islands have been resistant to the long list of Hawaii hurricanes that have approached. For example, when Hurricane Flossie (2007) approached and dissipated just before reaching landfall, the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) cited vertical wind shear as evidenced in the photo.\nUses.\nThe northern polar jet stream is the most important one for aviation and weather forecasting, as it is much stronger and at a much lower altitude than the subtropical jet streams and also covers many countries in the northern hemisphere, while the southern polar jet stream mostly circles Antarctica and sometimes the southern tip of South America.\nAviation.\nThe location of the jet stream is important for aviation. Aircraft flight time can be dramatically affected by either flying with the flow or against it. Often, airlines work to fly with the jet stream to obtain significant fuel cost and time savings.\nCommercial use of the jet stream began on 18 November 1952, when Pan Am flew from Tokyo to Honolulu at an altitude of . It cut the trip time by over one-third, from 18 to 11.5 hours.\nWithin North America, the time needed to fly east across the continent can be decreased by about 30 minutes if an airplane can fly with the jet stream. Across the Atlantic Ocean the North Atlantic Tracks service allows airlines and air traffic control to accommodate the jet stream for the benefit for airlines and other users.\nAssociated with jet streams is a phenomenon known as clear-air turbulence (CAT), caused by vertical and horizontal wind shear caused by jet streams. The CAT is strongest on the cold air side of the jet, next to and just under the axis of the jet. Clear-air turbulence can cause aircraft to plunge and so present a passenger safety hazard that has caused fatal accidents, such as the death of one passenger on United Airlines Flight 826 in 1997. Unusual wind speed in the jet stream in late February 2024 pushed commercial jets to excess of relative to the ground.\nPossible future power generation.\nScientists are investigating ways to harness the wind energy within the jet stream. According to one estimate of the potential wind energy in the jet stream, only one percent would be needed to meet the world's current energy needs. In the late 2000s it was estimated that the required technology would reportedly take 10\u201320 years to develop.\nThere are two major but divergent scientific articles about jet stream power. Archer &amp; Caldeira claim that the Earth's jet streams could generate a total power of 1700 terawatts (TW) and that the climatic impact of harnessing this amount would be negligible. However, Miller, Gans, &amp; Kleidon claim that the jet streams could generate a total power of only 7.5 TW and lacks the potential to make a significant contribution to renewable energy.\nUnpowered aerial attack.\nNear the end of World War II, from late 1944 until early 1945, the Japanese Fu-Go balloon bomb, a type of fire balloon, was designed as a cheap weapon intended to make use of the jet stream over the Pacific Ocean to reach the west coast of Canada and the United States. Relatively ineffective as weapons, they were used in one of the few attacks on North America during World War II, causing six deaths and a small amount of damage. American scientists studying the balloons thought the Japanese might be preparing a biological attack.\nChanges due to climate cycles.\nEffects of ENSO.\nEl Ni\u00f1o\u2013Southern Oscillation (ENSO) influences the average location of upper-level jet streams, and leads to cyclical variations in precipitation and temperature across North America, as well as affecting tropical cyclone development across the eastern Pacific and Atlantic basins. Combined with the Pacific Decadal Oscillation, ENSO can also impact cold season rainfall in Europe. Changes in ENSO also change the location of the jet stream over South America, which partially affects precipitation distribution over the continent.\nEl Ni\u00f1o.\nDuring El Ni\u00f1o events, increased precipitation is expected in California due to a more southerly, zonal, storm track. During the Ni\u00f1o portion of ENSO, increased precipitation falls along the Gulf coast and Southeast due to a stronger than normal, and more southerly, polar jet stream. Snowfall is greater than average across the southern Rockies and Sierra Nevada mountain range, and is well below normal across the Upper Midwest and Great Lakes states. The northern tier of the lower 48 exhibits above normal temperatures during the fall and winter, while the Gulf coast experiences below normal temperatures during the winter season. The subtropical jet stream across the deep tropics of the northern hemisphere is enhanced due to increased convection in the equatorial Pacific, which decreases tropical cyclogenesis within the Atlantic tropics below what is normal, and increases tropical cyclone activity across the eastern Pacific. In the southern hemisphere, the subtropical jet stream is displaced equatorward, or north, of its normal position, which diverts frontal systems and thunderstorm complexes from reaching central portions of the continent.\nLa Ni\u00f1a.\nAcross North America during La Ni\u00f1a, increased precipitation is diverted into the Pacific Northwest due to a more northerly storm track and jet stream. The storm track shifts far enough northward to bring wetter than normal conditions (in the form of increased snowfall) to the Midwestern states, as well as hot and dry summers. Snowfall is above normal across the Pacific Northwest and western Great Lakes. Across the North Atlantic, the jet stream is stronger than normal, which directs stronger systems with increased precipitation towards Europe.\nDust Bowl.\nEvidence suggests the jet stream was at least partly responsible for the widespread drought conditions during the 1930s Dust Bowl in the Midwest United States. Normally, the jet stream flows east over the Gulf of Mexico and turns northward pulling up moisture and dumping rain onto the Great Plains. During the Dust Bowl, the jet stream weakened and changed course traveling farther south than normal. This starved the Great Plains and other areas of the Midwest of rainfall, causing extraordinary drought conditions.\nLonger-term climatic changes.\nSince the early 2000s, climate models have consistently identified that global warming will gradually push jet streams poleward. In 2008, this was confirmed by observational evidence, which proved that from 1979 to 2001, the northern jet stream moved northward at an average rate of per year, with a similar trend in the southern hemisphere jet stream. Climate scientists have hypothesized that the jet stream will also gradually weaken as a result of global warming. Trends such as Arctic sea ice decline, reduced snow cover, evapotranspiration patterns, and other weather anomalies have caused the Arctic to heat up faster than other parts of the globe, in what is known as the Arctic amplification. In 2021\u20132022, it was found that since 1979, the warming within the Arctic Circle has been nearly four times faster than the global average, and some hotspots in the Barents Sea area warmed up to seven times faster than the global average. While the Arctic remains one of the coldest places on Earth today, the temperature gradient between it and the warmer parts of the globe will continue to diminish with every decade of global warming as the result of this amplification. If this gradient has a strong influence on the jet stream, then it will eventually become weaker and more variable in its course, which would allow more cold air from the polar vortex to leak mid-latitudes and slow the progression of Rossby waves, leading to more persistent and more extreme weather.\nThe hypothesis above is closely associated with Jennifer Francis, who had first proposed it in a 2012 paper co-authored by Stephen J. Vavrus. While some paleoclimate reconstructions have suggested that the polar vortex becomes more variable and causes more unstable weather during periods of warming back in 1997, this was contradicted by climate modelling, with PMIP2 simulations finding in 2010 that the Arctic Oscillation (AO) was much weaker and more negative during the Last Glacial Maximum, and suggesting that warmer periods have stronger positive phase AO, and thus less frequent leaks of the polar vortex air. However, a 2012 review in the \"Journal of the Atmospheric Sciences\" noted that \"there [has been] a significant change in the vortex mean state over the twenty-first century, resulting in a weaker, more disturbed vortex.\", which contradicted the modelling results but fit the Francis-Vavrus hypothesis. Additionally, a 2013 study noted that the then-current CMIP5 tended to strongly underestimate winter blocking trends, and other 2012 research had suggested a connection between declining Arctic sea ice and heavy snowfall during midlatitude winters.\nIn 2013, further research from Francis connected reductions in the Arctic sea ice to extreme summer weather in the northern mid-latitudes, while other research from that year identified potential linkages between Arctic sea ice trends and more extreme rainfall in the European summer. At the time, it was also suggested that this connection between Arctic amplification and jet stream patterns was involved in the formation of Hurricane Sandy and played a role in the early 2014 North American cold wave. In 2015, Francis' next study concluded that highly amplified jet-stream patterns are occurring more frequently in the past two decades. Hence, continued heat-trapping emissions favour increased formation of extreme events caused by prolonged weather conditions.\nStudies published in 2017 and 2018 identified stalling patterns of Rossby waves in the northern hemisphere jet stream as the culprit behind other almost stationary extreme weather events, such as the 2018 European heatwave, the 2003 European heat wave, 2010 Russian heat wave or the 2010 Pakistan floods, and suggested that these patterns were all connected to Arctic amplification. Further work from Francis and Vavrus that year suggested that amplified Arctic warming is observed as stronger in lower atmospheric areas because the expanding process of warmer air increases pressure levels which decreases poleward geopotential height gradients. As these gradients are the reason that cause west to east winds through the thermal wind relationship, declining speeds are usually found south of the areas with geopotential increases. In 2017, Francis explained her findings to the \"Scientific American\": \"A lot more water vapor is being transported northward by big swings in the jet stream. That's important because water vapor is a greenhouse gas just like carbon dioxide and methane. It traps heat in the atmosphere. That vapor also condenses as droplets we know as clouds, which themselves trap more heat. The vapor is a big part of the amplification story\u2014a big reason the Arctic is warming faster than anywhere else.\"\nIn a 2017 study conducted by climatologist Judah Cohen and several of his research associates, Cohen wrote that \"[the] shift in polar vortex states can account for \"most\" of the recent winter cooling trends over Eurasian midlatitudes\". A 2018 paper from Vavrus and others linked Arctic amplification to more persistent hot-dry extremes during the midlatitude summers, as well as the midlatitude winter continental cooling. Another 2017 paper estimated that when the Arctic experiences anomalous warming, primary production in North America goes down by between 1% and 4% on average, with some states suffering up to 20% losses. A 2021 study found that a stratospheric polar vortex disruption is linked with extreme cold winter weather across parts of Asia and North America, including the February 2021 North American cold wave. Another 2021 study identified a connection between the Arctic sea ice loss and the increased size of wildfires in the Western United States.\nHowever, because the specific observations are considered short-term observations, there is considerable uncertainty in the conclusions. Climatology observations require several decades to definitively distinguish various forms of natural variability from climate trends. This point was stressed by reviews in 2013 and in 2017. A study in 2014 concluded that Arctic amplification significantly decreased cold-season temperature variability over the northern hemisphere in recent decades. Cold Arctic air intrudes into the warmer lower latitudes more rapidly today during autumn and winter, a trend projected to continue in the future except during summer, thus calling into question whether winters will bring more cold extremes. A 2019 analysis of a data set collected from 35 182 weather stations worldwide, including 9116 whose records go beyond 50 years, found a sharp decrease in northern midlatitude cold waves since the 1980s.\nMoreover, a range of long-term observational data collected during the 2010s and published in 2020 suggests that the intensification of Arctic amplification since the early 2010s was not linked to significant changes on mid-latitude atmospheric patterns. State-of-the-art modelling research of PAMIP (Polar Amplification Model Intercomparison Project) improved upon the 2010 findings of PMIP2; it found that sea ice decline would weaken the jet stream and increase the probability of atmospheric blocking, but the connection was very minor, and typically insignificant next to interannual variability. In 2022, a follow-up study found that while the PAMIP average had likely underestimated the weakening caused by sea ice decline by 1.2 to 3 times, even the corrected connection still amounts to only 10% of the jet stream's natural variability.\nAdditionally, a 2021 study found that while jet streams had indeed slowly moved polewards since 1960 as was predicted by models, they did not weaken, in spite of a small increase in waviness. A 2022 re-analysis of the aircraft observational data collected over 2002\u20132020 suggested that the North Atlantic jet stream had actually strengthened. Finally, a 2021 study was able to reconstruct jet stream patterns over the past 1,250 years based on Greenland ice cores, and found that all of the recently observed changes remain within range of natural variability: the earliest likely time of divergence is in 2060, under the Representative Concentration Pathway 8.5 which implies continually accelerating greenhouse gas emissions.\nOther upper-level jets.\nPolar night jet.\nThe polar-night jet stream forms mainly during the winter months when the nights are much longer \u2013 hence the name referencing polar nights \u2013 in their respective hemispheres at around 60\u00b0 latitude. The polar night jet moves at a greater height (about ) than it does during the summer. During these dark months the air high over the poles becomes much colder than the air over the Equator. This difference in temperature gives rise to extreme air pressure differences in the stratosphere which, when combined with the Coriolis effect, create the polar night jets, that race eastward at an altitude of about . The polar vortex is circled by the polar night jet. The warmer air can only move along the edge of the polar vortex, but not enter it. Within the vortex, the cold polar air becomes increasingly cold, due to a lack of warmer air from lower latitudes as well as a lack of energy from the Sun entering during the polar night.\nLow-level jets.\nThere are wind maxima at lower levels of the atmosphere that are also referred to as jets.\nBarrier jet.\nA barrier jet in the low levels forms just upstream of mountain chains, with the mountains forcing the jet to be oriented parallel to the mountains. The mountain barrier increases the strength of the low level wind by 45 percent. In the North American Great Plains a southerly low-level jet helps fuel overnight thunderstorm activity during the warm season, normally in the form of mesoscale convective systems which form during the overnight hours. A similar phenomenon develops across Australia, which pulls moisture poleward from the Coral Sea towards cut-off lows which form mainly across southwestern portions of the continent.\nCoastal jet.\nCoastal low-level jets are related to a sharp contrast between high temperatures over land and lower temperatures over the sea and play an important role in coastal weather, giving rise to strong coast parallel winds. Most coastal jets are associated with the oceanic high-pressure systems and thermal low over land and are mainly located along cold eastern boundary marine currents, in upwelling regions offshore California, Peru\u2013Chile, Benguela, Portugal, Canary and West Australia, and offshore Yemen\u2013Oman.\nValley exit jet.\nA valley exit jet is a strong, down-valley, elevated air current that emerges above the intersection of the valley and its adjacent plain. These winds frequently reach speeds of up to at heights of above the ground. Surface winds below the jet tend to be substantially weaker, even when they are strong enough to sway vegetation.\nValley exit jets are likely to be found in valley regions that exhibit diurnal mountain wind systems, such as those of the dry mountain ranges of the US. Deep valleys that terminate abruptly at a plain are more impacted by these factors than are those that gradually become shallower as downvalley distance increases.\nAfrica.\nThere are several important low-level jets in Africa. Numerous low-level jets form in the Sahara, and are important for the raising of dust off the desert surface. This includes a low-level jet in Chad, which is responsible for dust emission from the Bod\u00e9l\u00e9 Depression, the world's most important single source of dust emission. The Somali Jet, which forms off the East African coast is an important component of the global Hadley circulation, and supplies water vapour to the Asian Monsoon. Easterly low-level jets forming in valleys within the East African Rift System help account for the low rainfall in East Africa and support high rainfall in the Congo Basin rainforest. The formation of the thermal low over northern Africa leads to a low-level westerly jet stream from June into October, which provides the moist inflow to the West African monsoon.\nWhile not technically a low-level jet, the mid-level African easterly jet (at 3000\u20134000 m above the surface) is also an important climate feature in Africa. It occurs during the northern hemisphere summer between 10\u00b0N and 20\u00b0N above in the Sahel region of West Africa. It is considered to play a crucial role in the West African monsoon, and helps form the tropical waves which move across the tropical Atlantic and eastern Pacific oceans during the warm season.\nOther planets.\nFor other planets, internal heat rather than solar heating is believed to drive their jet streams. \nJupiter's atmosphere has multiple jet streams caused by the convection cells driven by internal heating. These form the familiar banded color structure.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He then served two consecutive terms as Missouri Attorney General and as Missouri Governor (a historical first for a Republican candidate in the state). He is the only Republican to serve two full consecutive terms as governor to date. He also served one term as a U.S. Senator from Missouri until losing a race for a second term in 2000. Ashcroft had early appointments in Missouri state government and was mentored by John Danforth. He has written several books about politics and ethics.\nAfter George W. Bush was elected president in 2000, he selected Ashcroft to serve as U.S. Attorney General. As Attorney General, Ashcroft was a key supporter of the USA Patriot Act following the September 11 attacks and the use of torture on suspected terrorists. Ashcroft stepped down as Attorney General in February 2005 and was replaced by Alberto Gonzales. Since 2011, Ashcroft sits on the board of directors for the private military company Academi (formerly Blackwater) and is a professor at the Regent University School of Law, a conservative Christian institution affiliated with the late televangelist Pat Robertson; he has also been a member of the Federalist Society. His son, Jay Ashcroft, is also a politician who served as Secretary of State of Missouri from 2017 to 2025 before a failed bid for governor in 2024.\nEarly life.\nJohn David Ashcroft was born in Chicago on May 9, 1942, the son of homemaker Grace P. (n\u00e9e Larsen) and minister James Robert Ashcroft. His maternal grandparents were Norwegian, while his paternal grandfather was Irish. He grew up in Willard, Missouri, where his father was a minister in an Assemblies of God congregation in nearby Springfield, served as president of Evangel University (1958\u20131974), and jointly as President of Central Bible College (1958\u20131963). Ashcroft graduated from Hillcrest High School in 1960. He attended Yale University, where he was a member of the St. Elmo Society, graduating in 1964. He received a Juris Doctor from the University of Chicago Law School in 1967. After law school, he briefly taught Business Law and worked as an administrator at Southwest Missouri State University. During the Vietnam War, he was not drafted because he received six student draft deferments and one occupational deferment due to his teaching work.\nMissouri political career.\nState Auditor (1973\u20131975).\nIn 1972, Ashcroft ran for a congressional seat in southwest Missouri in the Republican primary election, narrowly losing to Gene Taylor. After the primary, Missouri Governor Kit Bond appointed Ashcroft to the office of State Auditor, which Bond had vacated when he became governor.\nIn 1974, Ashcroft was narrowly defeated for election to that post by Jackson County Executive George W. Lehr. Lehr had argued that Ashcroft, who is not an accountant, was not qualified to be the State Auditor.\nAttorney General of Missouri (1976\u20131985).\nMissouri Attorney General John Danforth, who was then in his second term, hired Ashcroft as an assistant state attorney general. In 1976, Danforth retired from the state attorney general post to run for the U.S. Senate, and Ashcroft ran to replace him. He was unopposed in the Republican primary and defeated Democrat James Baker in the general election. He was scheduled to be sworn in on January 10, 1977, but Danforth resigned from his post early ahead of his swearing in to the U.S. Senate, so Ashcroft became attorney general on December 27, 1976. In 1980, Ashcroft was re-elected with 64.5 percent of the vote, winning 96 of Missouri's 114 counties.\nDuring his tenure, Ashcroft challenged court-ordered plans to racially integrate schools in St. Louis and Kansas City. In response to his non-compliance, the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Missouri threatened him with contempt of court. During his gubernatorial campaign, Ashcroft bragged that this threat was proof of his commitment to upholding racial segregation.\nIn 1983, Ashcroft wrote the leading \"amicus curiae\" brief in the U.S. Supreme Court Case \"Sony Corp. of America v. Universal City Studios, Inc.\", supporting the use of video cassette recorders for time shifting of television programs.\nGovernor of Missouri (1985\u20131993).\nAshcroft was elected governor in 1984 and re-elected in 1988, becoming the first Republican in Missouri history elected to two consecutive terms.\nIn 1984, his opponent was the Democratic Lieutenant Governor Ken Rothman. The campaign was so negative on both sides that a reporter described the contest as \"two alley cats [scrapping] over truth in advertising\". In his campaign ads, Ashcroft showed the contrast between his rural base and the urban supporters of his opponent from St. Louis. Democrats did not close ranks on primary night. The defeated candidate Mel Carnahan endorsed Rothman. In the end, Ashcroft won 57 percent of the vote and carried 106 counties\u2014then the largest Republican gubernatorial victory in Missouri history.\nIn 1988, Ashcroft won by a larger margin over his Democratic opponent, Betty Cooper Hearnes, the wife of the former governor Warren Hearnes. Ashcroft received 64 percent of the vote in the general election\u2014the largest landslide for governor in Missouri history since the U.S. Civil War.\nDuring his second term, Ashcroft served as chairman of the National Governors Association (1991\u201392).\nU.S. Senator from Missouri (1995\u20132001).\nIn 1994, Ashcroft was elected to the U.S. Senate from Missouri, again succeeding John Danforth, who retired from the position. Ashcroft won 59.8% of the vote against Democratic Congressman Alan Wheat. As Senator:\nIn 1998, Ashcroft briefly considered running for U.S. president, but, on January 5, 1999, he decided that he would seek re-election to his Senate seat in the 2000 election and not run for president.\nIn the Republican primary, Ashcroft defeated Marc Perkel. In the general election, Ashcroft faced a challenge from Governor Mel Carnahan.\nIn the midst of a tight race, Carnahan died in an airplane crash three weeks prior to the election. Ashcroft suspended all campaigning after the plane crash. Because of Missouri state election laws and the short time to election, Carnahan's name remained on the ballot. Lieutenant Governor Roger B. Wilson became governor upon Carnahan's death. Wilson said that should Carnahan be elected, he would appoint his widow, Jean Carnahan, to serve in her husband's place. Mrs. Carnahan stated that, in accordance with her late husband's goal, she would serve in the Senate if voters elected his name. Following these developments, Ashcroft resumed campaigning.\nCarnahan won the election 51% to 49%. No politician had ever posthumously won election to the U.S. Senate, although voters had on at least three occasions chosen deceased candidates for the U.S. House of Representatives. Ashcroft remains the first and so far only U.S. Senator to have been defeated for re-election by a deceased person.\nUnited States Attorney General.\nIn December 2000, following his Senatorial defeat, Ashcroft was chosen for the position of U.S. attorney general by president-elect George W. Bush. He was confirmed by the U.S. Senate by a vote of 58 to 42, with most Democratic senators voting against him, citing his prior opposition to using busing to achieve school desegregation and opposition to abortion. At the time of his appointment, he was known to be a member of the Federalist Society.\nBefore beginning his terms as Governor and Senator, Ashcroft had his father anoint him with oil to mirror the biblical practice for recognizing kings. As his father died by 2001, Ashcroft had U.S. Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas, his former co-worker in the Attorney General Office of Missouri, perform this anointment and administer his oath of office.\nIn May 2001, the FBI revealed that they had misplaced thousands of documents related to the investigation of the Oklahoma City bombing. Ashcroft granted a 30-day stay of execution for Timothy McVeigh, the perpetrator of the bombing.\nIn July 2001, Ashcroft began flying exclusively by private jet. When questioned about this decision, the Justice Department explained that this course of action had been recommended based on a \"threat assessment\" made by the FBI. Neither the Bureau, nor the Justice Department would identify the specific nature of the threat, who made it, or when it happened. The CIA were unaware of any specific threats against Cabinet members. At the time, Ashcroft was the only Cabinet appointee who traveled on a private jet, excluding the special cases of Interior and Energy who have responsibilities which require chartered jets.\nAfter the September 11, 2001 attacks in the United States, Ashcroft was a key administration supporter of passage of the USA PATRIOT Act. One of its provisions, Section 215, allows the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) to apply for an order from the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court to require production of \"any tangible thing\" for an investigation. This provision was criticized by citizen and professional groups concerned about violations of privacy. Ashcroft referred to the American Library Association's opposition to Section 215 as \"hysteria\" in two separate speeches given in September 2003. While Attorney General, Ashcroft consistently denied that the FBI or any other law enforcement agency had used the Patriot Act to obtain library circulation records or those of retail sales. According to the sworn testimony of two FBI agents interviewed by the 9/11 Commission, he ignored warnings of an imminent al-Qaida attack.\nIn January 2002, the partially nude female statue of the \"Spirit of Justice\" in the Robert F. Kennedy Department of Justice Building, where Ashcroft held press conferences, was covered with blue curtains. Department officials long insisted that the curtains were put up to improve the room's use as a television backdrop and that Ashcroft had nothing to do with it. Ashcroft's successor, Alberto Gonzales, removed the curtains in June 2005. Ashcroft also held daily prayer meetings.\nIn July 2002, Ashcroft proposed the creation of Operation TIPS, a domestic program in which workers and government employees would inform law enforcement agencies about suspicious behavior they encounter while performing their duties. The program was widely criticized from the beginning, with critics deriding the program as essentially a domestic informant network along the lines of the East German Stasi or the Soviet KGB, and an encroachment upon the First and Fourth amendments. The United States Postal Service refused to be a party to it. Ashcroft defended the program as a necessary component of the ongoing war on terrorism, but the proposal was eventually abandoned.\nAshcroft proposed a draft of the Domestic Security Enhancement Act of 2003, legislation to expand the powers of the U.S. government to fight crime and terrorism, while simultaneously eliminating or curtailing judicial review of these powers for incidents related to domestic terrorism. The bill was leaked and posted to the Internet on February 7, 2003.\nOn May 26, 2004, Ashcroft held a news conference at which he said that intelligence from multiple sources indicated that the terrorist organization, al Qaeda, intended to attack the United States in the coming months. Critics suggested he was trying to distract attention from a drop in the approval ratings of President Bush, who was campaigning for re-election.\nGroups supporting individual gun ownership praised Ashcroft's support through DOJ for the Second Amendment. He said specifically, \"the Second Amendment protects an individual's right to keep and bear arms,\" expressing the position that the Second Amendment protects an individual right, unrelated to militia service.\nIn March 2004, the Justice Department under Ashcroft ruled President Bush's domestic intelligence program illegal. Shortly afterward, Ashcroft was hospitalized with acute gallstone pancreatitis. White House Counsel Alberto Gonzales and Chief of Staff Andrew Card Jr. went to Ashcroft's bedside in the hospital intensive-care unit, to persuade the incapacitated Ashcroft to sign a document to reauthorize the program. Acting Attorney General James Comey alerted FBI Director Robert Mueller III of this plan, and rushed to the hospital, arriving ahead of Gonzales and Card Jr. Ashcroft, \"summoning the strength to lift his head and speak\", refused to sign. Attempts to reauthorize the program were ended by President Bush when Ashcroft, Comey and Mueller threatened to resign.\nFollowing accounts of the Abu Ghraib torture and prisoner abuse scandal in Iraq, one of the torture memos was leaked to the press in June 2004. Jack Goldsmith, then head of the Office of Legal Counsel, had already withdrawn the Yoo memos and advised agencies not to rely on them. After Goldsmith chose to resign because of his objections, Ashcroft issued a one paragraph opinion re-authorizing the use of torture.\nAshcroft pushed his U.S. attorneys to pursue voter fraud cases. However, the U.S. attorneys struggled to find any deliberate voter fraud schemes, only finding individuals who made mistakes on forms or misunderstood whether they were eligible to vote.\nFollowing George W. Bush's re-election, Ashcroft resigned, which took effect on February 3, 2005, after the Senate confirmed White House Counsel Alberto Gonzales as the next attorney general. Ashcroft said in his hand-written resignation letter, dated November 2, \"The objective of securing the safety of Americans from crime and terror has been achieved.\"\nConsultant and lobbyist.\nIn 2004, Ashcroft had whilst still Attorney General sued Oracle Corporation to prevent it from acquiring a multibillion-dollar intelligence contract.\nIn May 2005 shortly after his resignantion as AG, Ashcroft founded a consulting firm, The Ashcroft Group, LLC., which Oracle hired in 2005. With the consulting firm's help, Oracle went on to acquire the contract. As of March 2006 the firm had twenty-one clients, turning down two for every one accepted. In 2005 year-end filings, Ashcroft's firm reported collecting $269,000, including $220,000 from[Oracle Corporation, which won Department of Justice approval of a multibillion-dollar acquisition less than a month after hiring Ashcroft. The year-end filing represented, in some cases, only initial payments.\nAccording to government filings, Oracle is one of five Ashcroft Group clients that seek help in selling data or software with security applications. Another client, Israel Aircraft Industries International, is competing with Seattle's Boeing Company to sell the government of South Korea a billion dollar airborne radar system.\nIn March 2006, Ashcroft positioned himself as an \"anti-Abramoff\". In an hour-long interview, Ashcroft used the word \"integrity\" scores of times. In May 2006, based on conversations with members of Congress, key aides and lobbyists, \"The Hill\" magazine listed Ashcroft as one of the top 50 lobbyists that K Street had to offer.\nBy August 2006, Ashcroft's firm reportedly had 30 clients, many of which made products or technology aimed at homeland security. About a third of its client list were not disclosed on grounds of confidentiality. The firm also had equity stakes in eight client companies. It reportedly received $1.4 million in lobbying fees in the six months preceding August 2006, a small fraction of its total earnings.\nAfter the proposed merger of Sirius Satellite Radio Inc. and XM Satellite Radio Holdings Inc., Ashcroft offered the firm his consulting services, according to a spokesman for XM. The spokesman said XM declined Ashcroft's offer. Ashcroft was subsequently hired by the National Association of Broadcasters, which is strongly opposed to the merger.\nIn 2011, Ashcroft became an \"independent director\" on the board of Xe Services (now Academi), the controversial private military company formerly known as Blackwater (Nisour Square massacre), which faced scores of charges related to weapons trafficking, unlawful force, and corruption, and had named Ted Wright as CEO in May 2011. Wright hired a new governance chief to oversee ethical and legal compliance and established a new board composed of former government officials, including former White House counsel Jack Quinn and Ashcroft. In December 2011, Xe Services rebranded to Academi to convey a more \"boring\" image.\nThe firm also has a law firm under its umbrella, called the Ashcroft Law Firm. In December 2014, the law firm was hired by convicted Russian arms trafficker Viktor Bout to overturn his 2011 conviction.\nIn June 2017, the Ashcroft Law firm was hired by the government of Qatar to carry out a compliance and regulatory review of Qatar's anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing framework, to help challenge accusations of supporting terrorism by its neighbors, following a regional blockade, as well as claims by U.S. President Donald Trump.\nIn June 2018, Ashcroft was reportedly hired by Najib Razak among other top U.S. lawyers to defend him in the 1MDB scandal, back in 2016. According to the document, the firm was hired to provide legal advice and counsel to Najib regarding \"improper actions by third parties to attempt to destabilise the government of Malaysia\". Although it is unsure whether Najib will retain the services of Ashcroft on the issue due to the United States Department of Justice's probe into 1MDB.\nPolitical issues.\nIn 2009 in \"Ashcroft v. al-Kidd\", the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco found that Ashcroft could be sued and held personally responsible for the wrongful detention of Abdullah al-Kidd. The American citizen was arrested at Dulles International Airport in March 2003 on his way to Saudi Arabia for study. He was held for 15 days in maximum security in three states, and 13 months in supervised release, to be used as a material witness in the trial of Sami Omar Al-Hussayen. (The latter was acquitted of all charges of supporting terrorism.) Al-Kidd was never charged and was not called as a witness in the Al-Hussayen case.\nThe panels court described the government's assertions under the USA Patriot Act (2001) as \"repugnant of the Constitution\". In a detailed and at times passionate opinion, Judge Milan Smith likened allegations against al-Kidd as similar to the repressive practices of the British Crown that sparked the American Revolution. He wrote that the government asserts it can detain American citizens \"not because there is evidence that they have committed a crime, but merely because the government wishes to investigate them for possible wrongdoing\". He called it \"a painful reminder of some of the most ignominious chapters of our national history\".\nAbdullah Al-Kidd was held in a maximum security prison for 16 days, and in supervised release for 13 months. Al-Kidd was born Lavoni T. Kidd in 1973 in Wichita, Kansas. When he converted to Islam as a student at the University of Idaho, where he was a prominent football player, he changed his name. He asserts that Ashcroft violated his civil liberties as an American citizen, as he was treated like a terrorist and not allowed to consult an attorney. Al-Kidd's lawyers say Ashcroft, as US attorney general, encouraged authorities after 9/11 to arrest potential suspects as material witnesses when they lacked probable cause to believe the suspects had committed a crime.\nThe US Supreme Court agreed on October 18, 2010, to hear the case. On May 31, 2011, the US Supreme Court unanimously overturned the lower court's decision, saying that al-Kidd could not personally sue Ashcroft, as he was protected by limited immunity as a government official. A majority of the justices held that al-Kidd could not have won his case on the merits, because Ashcroft did not violate his Fourth Amendment rights.\nAshcroft has been a proponent of the war on drugs. In a 2001 interview on \"Larry King Live,\" Ashcroft stated his intention to increase efforts in this area. In 2003, two nationwide investigations code-named Operation Pipe Dream and Operation Headhunter, which targeted businesses selling drug paraphernalia, mostly for cannabis use, resulted in a series of indictments.\nTommy Chong, a counterculture icon, was one of those charged, for his part in financing and promoting Chong Glass/Nice Dreams, a company started by his son Paris. Of the 55 individuals charged as a result of the operations, only Chong was given a prison sentence after conviction (nine months in a federal prison, plus forfeiting $103,000 and a year of probation). The other 54 individuals were given fines and home detentions. While the DOJ denied that Chong was treated any differently from the other defendants, critics thought the government was trying to make an example of him. Chong's experience as a target of Ashcroft's sting operation is the subject of Josh Gilbert's feature-length documentary \"a/k/a Tommy Chong\", which premiered at the 2005 Toronto International Film Festival. In a pre-sentencing brief, the Department of Justice specifically cited Chong's entertainment career as a consideration against leniency.\nWhen Karl Rove was being questioned in 2005 by the FBI over the leak of a covert CIA agent's identity in the press (the Valerie Plame affair), Ashcroft was allegedly briefed about the investigation. The Democratic U.S. Representative John Conyers described this as a \"stunning ethical breach that cries out for an immediate investigation.\" Conyers, the ranking Democrat on the House Judiciary Committee, asked, in a statement, for a formal investigation of the time between the start of Rove's investigation and John Ashcroft's recusal.\nSince his service in government, Ashcroft has continued to oppose proposals for physician-assisted suicide, which some states have passed by referendums. When interviewed about it in 2012, when a case had reached the US Supreme Court after California voters had approved a law to permit it under regulated conditions, he said,\nI certainly believe that people who are in pain should be helped and assisted in every way possible, that the drugs should be used to mitigate their pain but I believe the law of the United States of America which requires that drugs not be used except for legitimate health purposes.\nIn 2015, Human Rights Watch called for the investigation of Ashcroft \"for conspiracy to torture as well as other crimes.\"\nPersonal life.\nAshcroft is a member of the Assemblies of God church. He is married to Janet E. Ashcroft and has three children with her. His son, Jay, served as the Missouri Secretary of State from 2017 to 2025. and unsuccessfully ran for Governor himself in 2024.\nAshcroft has long enjoyed inspirational music and singing. In the 1970s, he recorded a gospel record entitled \"Truth: Volume One, Edition One\", with Democratic Missouri legislator Max Bacon.\nWith fellow U.S. senators Trent Lott, Larry Craig, and Jim Jeffords, Ashcroft formed a barbershop quartet called The Singing Senators. The men performed at social events with other senators. Ashcroft performed the Star Spangled Banner before the National Hockey League all-star game in St. Louis in 1988.\nAshcroft composed a paean titled \"Let the Eagle Soar,\" which he sang at the Gordon-Conwell Theological Seminary in February 2002. Ashcroft has written and sung a number of other songs. He has collected these on compilation tapes, including \"In the Spirit of Life and Liberty\" and \"Gospel (Music) According to John\". In 1998, he wrote a book with author Gary Thomas titled \"Lessons from a Father to His Son\".\nAshcroft was given an honorary doctorate before delivering the commencement address at Toccoa Falls College in 2018.\nAshcroft does not drink alcohol.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

In medieval and early modern European tradition he was considered to be the progenitor of the European peoples.\nEtymology.\nThe meaning of the name \"Japheth\" (&lt;templatestyles src=\"Script/styles_hebrew.css\" /&gt;\u05d9\u05e4\u05ea\u200e: \"y-p-t\") is disputable. There are two possible sources to the meaning of the name:\nIn the Book of Genesis.\nJapheth first appears in the Hebrew Bible as one of the three sons of Noah, saved from the Flood through the Ark. In the Book of Genesis, they are always in the order \"Shem, Ham, and Japheth\" when all three are listed. Genesis 9:24 calls Ham the youngest, and Genesis 10:21 refers ambiguously to Shem as \"brother of Japheth the elder\", which could mean that either is the eldest. Most modern writers accept Shem\u2013Ham\u2013Japheth as reflecting their birth order, but this is not always the case: Moses and Rachel also appear at the head of such lists despite explicit descriptions of them as younger siblings. However, Japheth is considered to have been the eldest son of Noah in Rabbinic literature.\nFollowing the Flood, Japheth is featured in the story of Noah's drunkenness. Ham sees Noah drunk and naked in his tent and tells his brothers, who then cover their father with a cloak while avoiding the sight; when Noah awakes he curses Canaan, the son of Ham, and blesses Shem and Japheth: \"Blessed be the Lord God of Shem and may Canaan be his slave; and may God enlarge Japheth and may he dwell in the tents of Shem, and may Canaan be his slave!\" Chapter 10 of Genesis, the Table of Nations, describes how earth was populated by the sons of Noah following the Flood, beginning with the descendants of Japheth:\nEthnogenetic interpretations.\nJapheth (in Hebrew: \"Y\u0101\u0301p\u0304e\u1e6f\" or \"Y\u00e9p\u0304e\u1e6f\") may be a transliteration of the Greek Iapetos, the ancestor of the Hellenic peoples. His sons and grandsons associate him with the geographic area comprising the Aegean Sea, Greece, the Caucasus, and Anatolia: Ionia/Javan, Rhodes/Rodanim, Cyprus/Kittim, and other places in the Eastern Mediterranean region. The point of the \"blessing of Japheth\" seems to be that Japheth (a Greek-descended people) and Shem (the Israelites) would rule jointly over Canaan (Palestine).\nFrom the 19th century until the late 20th century, it was usual to see Japheth as a reference to the Philistines, who shared dominion over Canaan during the pre-monarchic and early monarchic period of Israel and Judah. This view accorded with the understanding of the origin of the Book of Genesis, which was seen as having been composed in stages beginning with the time of King Solomon, when the Philistines still existed (they vanished from history after the Assyrian conquest of Canaan). However, Genesis 10:14 identifies their ancestor as Ham rather than Japheth.\nBiblical descendants.\nIn the Hebrew Bible, Japheth is ascribed seven sons: Gomer, Magog, Tiras, Javan, Meshech, Tubal, and Madai. According to the Roman\u2013Jewish historian Flavius Josephus in \"Antiquities of the Jews\", I.VI.122 (https://):\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Japhet, the son of Noah, had seven sons: they inhabited so, that, beginning at the mountains Taurus and Amanus, they proceeded along Asia, as far as the river Tanais (Don), and along Europe to C\u00e1diz; and settling themselves on the lands which they light upon, which none had inhabited before, they called the nations by their own names.\nThe \"Sefer haYashar\" (\"Book of Jasher\"), written by Talmudic rabbis in the 17th century, attributed some new names for Japheth's grandchildren which are not found in the Hebrew Bible, and provided a much more detailed genealogy. In the Jewish tradition, Abraham's wife Keturah is sometimes considered a descendant of Japheth.\nEuropeans.\nIn the 7th century AD, Hispano\u2013Roman archbishop and scholar Isidore of Seville wrote his noted encyclopedic-historical treatise titled \"Etymologiae\", in which he traces the origins of most of the European peoples back to Japheth. Scholars in almost every European nation continued to repeat and develop Isidore of Seville's assertion of descent from Noah through Japheth into the 19th century.\nWilliam Shakespeare's play \"Henry IV, Part II\" contains a wry comment about people who claim to be related to royal families. Prince Hal notes of such people,\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;...they will be kin to us, or they will fetch it from Japhet. (II.ii 117-18)\nThe Georgian historian and linguist Ivane Javakhishvili associated Japheth's sons with certain ancient tribes, called Tubals (Tabals, in Greek: \"Tibarenoi\") and Meshechs (Meshekhs/Mosokhs, in Greek: \"Moschoi\"), who claimed to represent non-Indo-European and non-Semitic, possibly \"Proto-Iberian\" tribes that inhabited Anatolia during the 3rd-1st millennia BC.\nIn the Polish tradition of Sarmatism, the Sarmatians, an Iranic people, were said to be descended from Japheth, son of Noah, enabling the Polish nobility to believe that their ancestry could be traced directly to Noah. In Scotland, histories tracing the Scottish people to Japheth were published as late as George Chalmers's well-received \"Caledonia\", published in 3 volumes from 1807 to 1824.\nIn the Islamic tradition.\nJapheth (in Arabic: \"Y\u0101fith\") is not mentioned by name in the Quran but is referred to indirectly in the narrative of Noah (Quran https://, https://, https://, https://, https://). Muslim exegesis of the Quran, however, names all of Noah's sons, and these include Japheth. In identifying Japheth's descendants, Muslim exegesis mostly agrees with the Biblical tradition.\nIn the Islamic tradition, he is usually regarded as the ancestor of the Gog and Magog tribes. Islamic tradition also tends to identify the descendants of Japheth as including the Turks, Khazars, Chinese, Mongols, and Slavs. According to Ab\u016b'l-Gh\u0101z\u012b who wrote the 17th-century ethnographic treatise \"Shajara-i Tar\u0101kima\" (\"Genealogy of the Turkmen\"), the descendants of Ham went to Africa, Shem to Iran, and Japheth went to the banks of the Itil and Yaik rivers, and had eight sons named Turk, Khazar, Saqlab, Rus, Ming, Chin, Kemeri, and Tarikh. As Japheth was dying he established Turk, his firstborn son, as his successor.\nAccording to the 18th-century Hui Muslim writer Liu Zhi, after Noah's flood, Japheth inherited China as the eastern portion of the Earth, while Shem inherited Arabia as the middle portion, and Ham inherited Europe as the western portion. Some Muslim traditions narrated that 36 languages of the world could be traced back to Japheth.\nIn popular culture.\nJapheth is a major character in the second act of Stephen Schwartz's musical, \"Children of Eden\". In this rendition, Japheth has fallen in love with the family servant, Yonah (created entirely for the show). He wants to bring her onto the ark to allow her to survive the flood, but Noah forbids this as Father (God) is trying to wipe the world free of those descended from Cain. Yonah is descended from Cain, despite her good heart and love from the family. Japheth secretly brings her aboard, and she is eventually discovered by Ham and Shem. Japheth defends her from Noah and is about to kill Shem in his rage. Yonah stops and calms him, and Noah decides to let her stay. The flood passes and the brothers all depart for different regions to populate the world, but Japheth and Yonah decide they want to search for Eden. Noah blesses their journey by passing the staff of Adam to Japheth.

He was nominated for seven Primetime Emmy Awards and four Golden Globe Awards for the role, but did not win any, mainly due to his co-star Michael Richards winning for his role as Cosmo Kramer. He did, however, win the 1995 Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Male Actor in a Comedy Series.\nConcurrently with his \"Seinfeld\" role, he had a part in the ABC sitcom \"Dinosaurs\" as Al \"Sexual\" Harris (who frequently engaged in sexual harassment) as well as other characters from 1991 to 1994.

{"id": "16483", "revid": "11096", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=16483", "title": "John Wycliffe", "text": "English theologian (c. 1331 \u2013 1384)\nJohn Wycliffe (; also spelled \"Wyclif\", \"Wickliffe\", \"Wicklyf\" etc.; c. 1328 \u2013 31\u00a0December 1384) was an English scholastic philosopher, Christian reformer, Catholic priest, and a theology professor at the University of Oxford. Wycliffe is traditionally believed to have advocated for or made a vernacular translation of the Vulgate Bible into Middle English, though more recent scholarship has minimised the extent of his advocacy or involvement for lack of direct contemporary evidence.\nHe became an influential dissident within the Catholic priesthood during the 14th\u00a0century and his ideas are often considered an important predecessor to Protestantism. His political-theological theory of \"dominion\" meant that the church was not allowed to own property or have ecclesiastic courts, and men in mortal sin were not entitled to exercise authority in the church or state, nor to own property. Wycliffe insisted on the radical poverty of all clergy.\nWycliffe has been characterised as the \"evening star\" of scholasticism and as the \"morning star\" or of the English Reformation.\nCertain of Wycliffe's later followers, derogatorily called Lollards by their orthodox contemporaries in the 15th and 16th centuries, adopted a number of the beliefs attributed to Wycliffe such as theological virtues, predestination, iconoclasm, and the notion of caesaropapism, with some questioning the veneration of saints, the sacraments, requiem masses, transubstantiation, monasticism, and the legitimacy or role of the Papacy. Wycliffe's writings in Latin greatly influenced the philosophy and teaching of the Czech reformer Jan Hus (c. 1369\u20131415).\nLife and career.\nEarly life.\nWycliffe was born in the village of Hipswell, near Richmond in the North Riding of Yorkshire, England, although there is some dispute about the date. He has conventionally been given a birth date of 1324 but Hudson and Kenny state only records \"suggest he was born in the mid-1320s\" and Conti states that he was born \"after 1331\".\nWycliffe received his early education close to his home. It is unknown when he first came to Oxford, with which he was so closely connected until the end of his life, but he is known to have been at Oxford around 1345. Thomas Bradwardine was the Archbishop of Canterbury and his book \"On the Cause of God Against the Pelagians\", a bold recovery of the Pauline\u2013Augustinian doctrine of grace, greatly shaped young Wycliffe's views, as did the Black Death, which reached England in the summer of 1348. From his frequent references to it in later life it appears to have made a deep and abiding impression upon him. According to Robert Vaughn, the effect was to give Wycliffe \"very gloomy views in regard to the condition and prospects of the human race\". In September 1351, Wycliffe became a priest. Wycliffe would have been at Oxford during the St Scholastica Day riot, in which sixty-three students and a number of townspeople were killed.\nCareer in education.\nIn 1356, Wycliffe completed his bachelor of arts degree at Merton College as a junior fellow. That same year he produced a small treatise, \"The Last Age of the Church\". In the light of the virulence of the plague, which had subsided seven years previously, Wycliffe's studies led him to the opinion that the close of the 14th century would mark the end of the world. While other writers viewed the plague as God's judgement on sinful people, Wycliffe saw it as an indictment of an unworthy clergy. The mortality rate among the clergy had been particularly high and those who replaced them were, in his opinion, uneducated or generally disreputable.\nIn 1361, he was Master of Balliol College in Oxford. That year he was presented by the college to the parish of Fillingham in Lincolnshire, which he visited rarely during long vacations from Oxford. For this he had to give up the headship of Balliol College, though he could continue to live at Oxford. He is said to have had rooms in the buildings of The Queen's College. In 1362, he was granted a prebend at Aust in Westbury-on-Trym, which he held in addition to the post at Fillingham.\nIn 1365, his performance led Simon Islip, Archbishop of Canterbury, to place him at the head of Canterbury Hall, where twelve young men were preparing for the priesthood. In December 1365, Islip appointed Wycliffe as warden, but when Islip died in 1366, his successor, Simon Langham, a man of monastic training, turned the leadership of the college over to a monk. In 1367, Wycliffe's appeal to Rome was refused in 1371. The incident was typical of the ongoing rivalry between monks or friars and secular clergy at Oxford at this time.\nIn 1368, he gave up his living at Fillingham and took over the rectory of Ludgershall, Buckinghamshire, not far from Oxford, which enabled him to retain his connection with the university. Tradition has it that he began his translation of the Bible into English while sitting in a room above what is now the porch in Ludgershall Church. In 1369, Wycliffe obtained a bachelor's degree in theology, and his doctorate in 1372. In 1374, he received the crown living of St Mary's Church, Lutterworth in Leicestershire, which he retained until his death.\nPolitics.\nIn 1374 Wycliffe's was part of a group negotiating in Bruges on behalf of the English Government with Gregory XI's papal envoys on a number of disputed points between the king and the pope which may have started his connection with the Duke of Lancaster John of Gaunt, a powerful magnate and power broker who was the third son of King Edward III, although that connection may have started as early as 1371. Soon after his return from Bruges he began to write tracts and longer works, being no longer satisfied with just using his college chair to promote his ideas . In a book concerned with the government of God and the Ten Commandments, he attacked the temporal rule of the clergy, the collection of annates, indulgences, and simony.\nAccording to the English Catholic historian Francis Aidan Gasquet, at least some of Wycliffe's program should be seen as (naive) \"attempts at social reconstruction\" in the aftermath the continuing institutional chaos after the Black Death (1347\u20131349) \n\"De civili dominio\".\nWycliffe entered the politics of the day with his great work \"De civili dominio\" (\"On Civil Dominion\"), which drew arguments from the works of Richard FitzRalph. This called for the royal divestment of all church property. Wycliffe argued that the Church had fallen into sin and that it ought therefore to give up all its property, and that the clergy must live in poverty. The tendency of the high offices of state to be held by clerics was resented by powerful nobles such as John of Gaunt whose power was challenged by the wealth and power of the clergy while also believing that church wealth could fund the government's military needs.\nConflicts with Church, State and University.\nIn 1377, Wycliffe's ideas on lordship and church wealth caused his first official condemnation by Pope Gregory XI, who censured 19 articles of \"De civili dominio\". He was summoned before William Courtenay, Bishop of London, to a convocation on 19 February 1377 at St Paul's Cathedral. The exact charges are not known, as the matter did not get as far as a definite examination. Lechler suggests that Wycliffe was targeted by John of Gaunt's opponents among the nobles and church hierarchy. Gaunt, the Earl Marshal Henry Percy, and a number of other armed supporters accompanied Wycliffe. A hostile crowd gathered at the church, and at the entrance, party animosities began to show, and there was an angry exchange between the Bishop of London and John of Gaunt about whether Wycliffe could sit.\nGaunt declared that he would humble the pride of the English clergy and their partisans, hinting at the intent to secularise the possessions of the Church. The assembly broke up and Gaunt and his partisans departed with their prot\u00e9g\u00e9. Anti-Gaunt riots followed the next day in London. Most of the English clergy were irritated by this encounter, and attacks upon Wycliffe began.\nWycliffe's second and third books dealing with civil government carry a sharp polemic.\nOn 22 May 1377, Pope Gregory XI sent five copies of a bull against Wycliffe, dispatching one to the Archbishop of Canterbury, and the others to the Bishop of London, King Edward III, the Chancellor, and the university. Among the enclosures were 18 theses of his, which were denounced as erroneous and dangerous to Church and State: all were drawn from \"De Civili dominio\".\nStephen Lahey suggests that Gregory's action against Wycliffe was an attempt to put pressure on King Edward to make peace with France. Edward III died on 21 June 1377, and the bull against Wycliffe did not reach England before December. Wycliffe was asked to give the king's council his opinion on whether it was lawful to withhold traditional payments to Rome, and he responded that it was.\nBack at Oxford, the Vice-Chancellor confined Wycliffe for some time in Black Hall, but his friends soon obtained his release.\nIn March 1378, Wycliffe was summoned to appear at Lambeth Palace to defend himself. However, Sir Lewis Clifford entered the chapel and in the name of the queen mother (Joan of Kent), forbade the bishops to proceed to a definite sentence concerning Wycliffe's conduct or opinions. Wycliffe wrote a letter expressing and defending his less \"obnoxious doctrines\". The bishops, who were divided, satisfied themselves with forbidding him to speak further on the controversy.\n\"De incarcerandis fedelibus\".\nWycliffe then wrote his \"De incarcerandis fedelibus\" (On the Incarceration of the Faithful), with 33 conclusions in Latin and English. Wycliffe did not think that incarceration should be a permitted form of excommunication. In the book he demanded that it should be legal for the excommunicated and incarcerated to appeal to the king and his council against the excommunication or incarceration. \nSome ordinary citizens, some of the nobility, and his former protector, John of Gaunt, rallied to him. Before any further steps could be taken in Rome, Gregory XI died in 1378.\n\"De officio regis\".\nWycliffe's stance against the papacy grew ever more extreme moving from respect to outright opposition. Wycliffe's stand concerning the ideal of poverty became continually firmer, as well as his position with regard to the temporal rule of the clergy. \nClosely related to this attitude was his book \"De officio regis\", the content of which had been foreshadowed in his 33 conclusions: for example, that a trial before Parliament and Synod was necessary for excommunication, that the King should (intervene and) not authorise imprisonment as a sentence for excommunication. This book, like those that preceded and followed, was concerned with the reform of the Church, in which the temporal arm was to have an influential part. \nFrom 1380 onwards, Wycliffe devoted himself to writings that argued his rejection of transubstantiation, and strongly criticised the friars who supported it.\nAnti-Wycliffe synod.\nIn the summer of 1381, Wycliffe formulated his doctrine of the Lord's Supper in twelve short sentences, and made it a duty to advocate it everywhere. Then the English hierarchy launched proceedings against him. The chancellor of the University of Oxford had some of the declarations pronounced heretical. When this was announced to Wycliffe, he declared that no one could change his convictions. He then appealed \u2013 not to the pope or the ecclesiastical authorities of the land, but to the king. He published his great confession upon the subject, and a second writing in English intended for the common people.\nAs long as Wycliffe limited his attacks to abuses and the wealth of the Church, he could rely on the support of part of the clergy and aristocracy, but once he dismissed the traditional doctrine of transubstantiation, his theses could not be defended any more. This view cost him the support of John of Gaunt and many others.\nIn the midst of this came the Peasants' Revolt of 1381. The revolt was sparked in part by Wycliffe's preaching, carried throughout the realm by \"poor priests\" or \"poor preachers\" appointed by Wycliffe, and mostly laymen. A contemporary record claims local sympathetic knights would force local people to hear the preaching, sometimes acting as armed guards in the parish church to prevent disputation. The preachers didn't limit their criticism of the accumulation of wealth and property to that of the monasteries, but included secular properties belonging to the nobility. Although Wycliffe disapproved of the revolt, some of his disciples justified the killing of Simon Sudbury, Archbishop of Canterbury.\nIn 1382, Wycliffe's old enemy William Courtenay, now Archbishop of Canterbury, called an ecclesiastical assembly of notables at London. During the consultations on 21 May an earthquake occurred. The participants were terrified and wished to break up the assembly, but Courtenay declared the earthquake a favourable sign, which meant the purification of the earth from erroneous doctrine, and the result of the \"Earthquake Synod\" was assured.\nOf the 24 propositions attributed to Wycliffe without mentioning his name, ten were declared heretical and fourteen erroneous. The former had reference to the transformation in the sacrament, the latter to matters of church order and institutions. It was forbidden from that time to hold these opinions or to advance them in sermons or in academic discussions. All persons disregarding this order were to be subject to prosecution. To accomplish this, the help of the State was necessary, but the Commons rejected the bill. The king, however, had a decree issued which permitted the arrest of those in error.\nThe citadel of the reformatory movement was Oxford, where Wycliffe's most active helpers were. The ban applied to them and they were summoned to recant. Nicholas of Hereford went to Rome to appeal.\nOn 17 November 1382, Wycliffe was summoned before a synod at Oxford. He still commanded the favour of the court and of Parliament, to which he addressed a memorial. In 1383 he was summonsed to Rome, but he suffered a debilitating stroke and was excused from travel. He was neither excommunicated then, nor deprived of his living.\nWycliffe aimed to do away with the existing hierarchy and replace it with the \"poor priests\" who lived in poverty, were bound by no vows, had received no formal consecration, and preached the Gospel to the people. Itinerant preachers spread the teachings of Wycliffe. The bull of Gregory XI impressed upon them the name of Lollards, intended as an opprobrious epithet, but it became, to them, a name of honour. Even in Wycliffe's time the \"Lollards\" had reached wide circles in England and preached \"God's law, without which no one could be justified.\" Furthermore, not all anti-clerical people were Lollards, not all Lollards were Wycliffites, and not all productions attributed to Wycliffites were anti-Catholic, despite later conflation.\nDeath and posthumous declaration of heresy.\nIn the years before his death in 1384 he increasingly argued for Scriptures as the authoritative centre of Christianity, that the claims of the papacy were unhistorical, that monasticism was irredeemably corrupt, and that the moral unworthiness of priests invalidated their office and sacraments.\nWycliffe returned to Lutterworth. From there he sent out tracts against the monks and Pope Urban VI. Urban VI, contrary to Wycliffe's hopes, had not turned out to be a reforming pope. The literary achievements of Wycliffe's last days, such as the \"Trialogus\", stand at the peak of the knowledge of his day. His last work, the \"Opus evangelicum\", the last part of which he named in characteristic fashion \"Of Antichrist\", remained uncompleted. While he was saying Mass in the parish church on Holy Innocents' Day, 28 December 1384, he suffered a stroke, and died a few days later. He started to be venerated as a local saint; some Bohemian followers \"even took a piece of his tomb to Prague, where it was worshipped as a relic.\"\nThe anti-Lollard statute of 1401 De heretico comburendo classed heresy as a form of sedition or treason, and ordered that Lollard books, frequently associated with Wycliffe, be handed over and burnt; someone who refused and would not abjure could be burnt. The \"Constitutions of Oxford\" of 1408 established rules in Oxford University, and specifically named John Wycliffe as a Lollard and his writings as heretical; it decreed that new translation efforts of Scripture into English should be first authorised by a Bishop.\nThe Council of Constance declared Wycliffe a heretic on 4 May 1415, and banned his writings. The Council decreed that Wycliffe's works should be burned and his bodily remains removed from consecrated church ground, following the customary logic that heretics had put themselves outside the church. This order, confirmed by Pope Martin V, was eventually carried out in 1428. Wycliffe's corpse, or a neighbour's, was exhumed; unusually, on the orders of the bishop the remains were burned and the ashes drowned in the River Swift, which flows through Lutterworth.\nNone of Wycliffe's contemporaries left a complete picture of his person, his life, and his activities. Paintings representing Wycliffe are from a later period. In \"The Testimony of William Thorpe\" (1407) (possibly apocryphal), Wycliffe appears wasted and physically weak. Thorpe says Wycliffe was of unblemished walk in life, and regarded affectionately by people of rank, who often consorted with him, took down his sayings, and clung to him. \"I indeed clove to none closer than to him, the wisest and most blessed of all men whom I have ever found.\"\nWorks.\nWycliffe is said to have written about two hundred works in Latin and Middle English. There are few experts in 14th-century scholastic Latin, and many of Wycliffe's Latin works have not been translated into English, which has limited their study by historians. His theological and political works include numerous books and tracts:\nMost historians hold that few to none of the Middle English works (tracts) ascribed to Wycliffe can be confidently attributed to him, in contrast to the Latin works, with the possible exception of six: \"On the Pastoral Office\", \"On the Pope\", \"On the Church and Her Members\", \"Of Confession\", \"Of Pseudo-Friars\", and \"Of Dominion\".\nA large number of sermons ascribed to him, about 250 in Middle English and 170 in Latin, survive.\nMiddle English Bibles.\nAccording to tradition Wycliffe is said to have completed a translation direct from the Vulgate into Middle English \u2013 a version now known as Wycliffe's Bible. He may have personally translated the Gospels of Matthew, Mark, Luke and John but it is possible he initially translated the entire New Testament Early Version. It is assumed that his associates translated the Old Testament and revised the Late Version. Wycliffe's Bible appears to have been completed prior to 1384, with additional updated versions being done by Wycliffe's assistant John Purvey, and others, in 1388 and 1395. More recently historians of the Wycliffite movement have suggested that Wycliffe had at most a minor role in the actual translations or contributed \"ad hoc\" passages taken from his English theological writings, with some, building on the earlier theories of Francis Aidan Gasquet, going as far as to suggest he had no role in the translations other than the translation projects perhaps being inspired, at least partially, by Wycliffe's biblicism at Oxford, but otherwise being orthodox Catholic translations later co-opted by his followers.\nIn keeping with Wycliffe's belief that scripture was the only authoritative reliable guide to the truth about God, he is said to have become involved in efforts to translate the Bible into English. However, while Wycliffe is popularly credited, it is not possible exactly to define his part, if any, in the translations, which were based on the Vulgate.\nIn common belief from only decades after the translations, it was his initiative, and the success of the project was due to his leadership. For the initial Early Version (EV), the rendering of the Old Testament is attributed to his friend Nicholas of Hereford; the rendering of some of the New Testament has been traditionally attributed to Wycliffe. The whole was revised perhaps by Wycliffe's younger contemporary John Purvey in 1388, known as the Late Version (LV). Linguistic analysis, however, suggests there were multiple translators for both EV and LV translations.\nThere still exist over 200 manuscripts, complete or partial, mainly containing the translation in its LV form. From this, it is possible to infer that texts were widely diffused in the 15th century. For this reason, the Wycliffites in England were often designated by their opponents as \"Bible men\"; it has been noted, however, that the vocabulary in English Wycliffite sermons doesn't typically match that found in the EV or LV.\nDoctrines.\nHistorian S. Harrison Thomson notes that Wycliff's theology was on a broader canvas than the continental reformation: however of the major Protestant \"notes\", it is difficult to find justification by faith alone or the priesthood of all believers espoused in his works. \n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;It is right for God to have two vicars in His church, namely a king in temporal affairs, and a priest in spiritual. The king should strongly check rebellion, as did God in the Old Testament, while priests ought minister the precepts mildly, as did Christ, who was at once priest and king.\u201d\u2014\u200a\nAnd while Wycliffe certainly advocated \"the supremacy of scripture over tradition\", no reformer adopted his view that every verse in Scripture was in some way literally true. According to popular history, Wycliffe had come to regard the scriptures as the only reliable guide to the truth about God, and maintained that all Christians should rely on the Bible rather than on the teachings of popes and clerics. He said that there was no scriptural justification for the papacy or special courts for religious (e.g., monks) or the clergy (e.g., priests).\nTheologically, his preaching expressed a strong belief in predestination that enabled him to declare an \"invisible church of the elect\", made up of those predestined to be saved, rather than in the \"visible\" Catholic Church.\nTo Wycliffe, the Church was the totality of those who are predestined to blessedness. No one who is eternally lost has part in it. There is one universal Church, and outside of it there is no salvation.\nHis first tracts and greater works of ecclesiastical-political content defended the privileges of the State. By 1379 in his \"De ecclesia\" (\"On the Church\"), Wycliffe clearly claimed the supremacy of the king over the priesthood. He accepted the existence of purgatory but not the usefulness of intercession for the saved in purgatory. He also rejected the selling of indulgences.\nAttack on monasticism.\nThe battle against what he saw as an imperialised papacy and its supporters, the \"sects\", as he called the monastic orders, takes up a large space not only in his later works, such as the \"Trialogus\", \"Dialogus\", \"Opus evangelicum\", and in his sermons, but also in a series of sharp tracts and polemical productions in Latin and English (of which those issued in his later years have been collected as \"Polemical Writings\").\nIn the 1380 \"Objections to Friars\", he calls monks the pests of society, enemies of religion, and patrons and promoters of every crime. He directed his strongest criticism against the friars, whose preaching he considered neither scriptural nor sincere, but motivated by \"temporal gain\". While others were content to seek the reform of particular errors and abuses, Wycliffe sought nothing less than the extinction of the institution itself, as being repugnant to scripture and his theology of apostolic poverty, and inconsistent with the order and prosperity of the Church. He advocated the dissolution of the monasteries.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;But any one who looks even cursorily through these volumes will at once perceive that they exhibit everywhere a vehement and uncompromising spirit, \u2014 a spirit which menaced what it attacked, not with reform, but with destruction. The feeling of Wyclif towards the friars seems to have amounted to positive hatred ...: he calls upon lords and gentlemen to unite with the reforming clergy in suppressing the friars altogether. Not one redeeming feature is allowed them ; not a single ray of light relieves the awful shadows of the portrait which he draws of them. The superior clergy, \u2014 bishops, deans, and archdeacons, \u2014 the various orders of monks, and the canons secular and regular, of whom there were at that time numerous communities in England, are all denounced with nearly equal bitterness, and with as little allowance for any good qualities which they might possess. Now, that the portrait which Wyclif draws of his adversaries is an entirely fair and truthful one, cannot seem probable to any reasonable man.\u2014\u200a\nViews on the papacy.\nRudolph Buddensieg finds two distinct aspects in Wycliffe's work. The first, from 1366 to 1378, reflects a political struggle with Rome, while 1378 to 1384 is more a religious struggle. In each Wycliffe has two approaches: he attacks both the Papacy and its institutions, and also Roman Catholic doctrine.\nWycliffe's influence was never greater than at the moment when pope and antipope sent their ambassadors to England to gain recognition for themselves. In 1378, in the ambassadors' presence, he delivered an opinion before Parliament that showed, in an important ecclesiastical political question (the matter of the right of asylum in Westminster Abbey), a position that was to the liking of the State. He argued that criminals who had taken sanctuary in churches might lawfully be dragged out of sanctuary.\nThe books and tracts of Wycliffe's last six years include continual attacks upon the papacy and the entire hierarchy of his times. Each year they focus more and more, and at the last, the pope and the Antichrist seem to him practically equivalent concepts. Yet there are passages which are moderate in tone: G. V. Lechler identifies three stages in Wycliffe's relations with the papacy. The first step, which carried him to the outbreak of the schism, involves moderate recognition of the papal primacy; the second, which carried him to 1381, is marked by an estrangement from the papacy; and the third shows him in sharp contest.\nBasic positions in philosophy.\nWycliffe was a prominent English philosopher of the second half of the 14th century. He earned his great repute as a philosopher at an early date. Henry Knighton says that in philosophy he was second to none, and in scholastic discipline incomparable. There was a period in his life when he devoted himself exclusively to scholastic philosophy. His first book, \"\" (1360), explores the fundamentals of Scholastic Theology. He believed that \"one should study Logic in order to better understand the human mind because ...human thoughts, feelings and actions bear God's image and likeness\". He espoused \"propositional realism\": that a true proposition maps onto a truth about being (i.e., about something real.)\nThe centre of Wycliffe's philosophical system is formed by the doctrine of the prior existence in the thought of God of all things and events. While Platonic realism would view \"beauty' as a property that exists in an ideal form independently of any mind or thing, \"for Wycliffe every universal, as part of creation, derived its existence from God, the Creator\". Wycliffe was a close follower of Augustine, and always upheld the primacy of the Creator over the created reality.\nIn some of his teachings, as in \"\", the influence of Thomas Aquinas can be detected.\nHe said that Democritus, Plato, Augustine, and Grosseteste far outranked Aristotle. So far as his relations to the philosophers of the Middle Ages are concerned, he held to realism as opposed to the nominalism advanced by William of Ockham.\nA number of Wycliffe's ideas have been carried forward in the twentieth century by philosopher and Reformed theologian Cornelius Van Til.\n\"Dominium\".\nA second key point of Wycliffe's is his emphasis on the notion of divine Lordship (\"\").\n\"\" (c. 1373) examines the relationship between God and his creatures. The practical application of this for Wycliffe was seen in the rebellious attitude of individuals (particulars) towards rightful authority (universals).\n\"Beyond all doubt, intellectual and emotional error about universals is the cause of all sin that reigns in the world.\"\nIn ' (\"On Civil Dominion\", c. 1377) he discusses the appropriate circumstance under which an entity may be seen as possessing authority over lesser subjects. ' is always conferred by God: injuries inflicted on someone personally by a king should be born by them submissively, a conventional idea, but injuries by a king against God should be patiently resisted even to death. Gravely sinful kings and popes forfeited their divine right to obedience. Versions of this were taken up by Lollards and Hussites.\nAttitude toward speculation.\nWycliffe's fundamental principle of the preexistence in thought of all reality involves the most serious obstacle to freedom of the will; the philosopher could assist himself only by the formula that the free will of man was something predetermined of God. He demanded strict dialectical training as the means of distinguishing the true from the false, and asserted that logic (or the syllogism) furthered the knowledge of catholic verities; ignorance of logic was the reason why men misunderstood Scripture, since men overlooked the connection, the distinction between idea and appearance.\nWycliffe was not merely conscious of the distinction between theology and philosophy, but his sense of reality led him to pass by scholastic questions. He left aside philosophical discussions that seemed to have no significance for the religious consciousness and those that pertained purely to scholasticism: \"We concern ourselves with the verities that are, and leave aside the errors which arise from speculation on matters which are not.\"\nSacraments.\nJohn Wycliffe believed that the communion bread was \"very God in form of bread\" (i.e., not merely symbolic) but rejected the theological characterisation of this as transubstantiation. He also rejected the sacrament of confession, saying they were against scripture. Wycliffe was attacked as being a Donatist, however the claim was a misconception, perhaps used to discredit his views on the Eucharist, which were consubstantiation: \nThe nature of the bread is not destroyed by what is done by the priest, it is only elevated so as to become a substance more honoured. The bread while becoming by virtue of Christ\u2019s words the body of Christ does not cease to be bread. When it has become sacramentally the body of Christ, it remains bread substantially.\u201d\n\u2014 John Wycliffe\nSoteriology.\nWycliffe was influenced by the Augustinian soteriology, which centered on a divine monergism, and implied a double predestination. He argued that all events occur by absolute necessity, and that God is the author of even man's evil deeds. This position led Wycliffe to become a strong proponent of double predestination. Wycliffe appears to have had similar ideas of justification as the later reformers would. According to Wycliffe faith was sufficient for salvation:\nThat faith in our Lord Jesus Christ, is sufficient for salvation, and that without faith it is impossible to please God ; that the merit of Christ is able, by itself, to redeem all mankind from hell, and that this sufficiency is to be understood without any other cause concurring; (Wycliffe) persuaded men therefore to trust wholly to Christ, to rely altogether upon his sufferings, not to seek to be justified but by his righteousness; and that by participation in his righteousness, all men are righteous.\n\u2014 popularly attributed to John Wycliffe with revisions, but from \"pr\u00e9cis\" by Protestant scholar Dr Thomas James \"An Apology for John Wycliffe\" (1608) \nScripture.\nWycliffe expressed his theories in the book \"De Veritate Sacrae Scripturae\" (On the Truthfulness of Holy Scripture, c.1378).\nWycliffe's dictum was \u201comnis veritas est ex scriptura, et ut necessarior est expressior\u201d (all truth necessary to faith is\nin the scripture, and the more necessary, the more expressly. This proposition was later taken up by Martin Luther.\nThe whole of scripture is one word of God (\"Tota scriptura sacra est unum dei verbum\"): being a monologue by the same author meant that sentences from different books could be combined without much regard for context, supporting strained and mystical interpretations.\nWycliffe taught that the scriptures were literally true unless obviously figurative, to the extent that when Jesus spoke in parables, he was reporting events that had actually occurred. Psalm 22 v6 (\"I am a worm and no man\"), which Pseudo-Dionysius had memorably used to give 'worm' as a name of God, became in Wycliffe's extreme literalism a statement that Jesus had been begotten without sexual contact (as was then believed of worms) and was formally God not a simply man.\nThe literal sense of scripture is that sense which the Holy Ghost first imparted so that the faithful soul might ascend to God () Wycliffe wrote of progressive stages of scriptural interpretation: the plain or literal reading of text and its interpretation being the most basic, leading to a mystical understanding of the sense of the author, leading finally to seeing the Book of Life which contains every truth. However, historians have suggested that this mystical view allowed Wycliffe to work backwards, back-fitting his reading of scripture to suit his theological views. Indeed, Wycliffe maintains that the Christian faith would persist even if all biblical codices were \u201cburnt up or otherwise destroyed\u201d.\nVernacular Scripture.\nWycliffe is popularly connected with the view that scriptures should be translated into the vernacular and made available to laymen, and that this was a critical issue in the censures against him.\nHowever, scholars have noted the availability of scriptures to laypeople in the vernacular was not a notable theme of Wycliffe's theological works. (It is mentioned in his \"De XXXIII erroribus curitatum\", Chapter 26 against those who would stop secular men from \"intermeddling with the Gospel\".) Nor were there any church-wide bans on vernacular scriptures in place that Wycliffe might be regarded as protesting against. It was not part of Wycliffe's 1377 papal censure, nor the declaration of heresy by the Council of Constance (1415). Vernacular scriptures were not mentioned in the two key early Lollard documents, regarded as channelling his doctrine: the Twelve Conclusions (c. 1396) and the Thirty Seven Conclusions (c. 1396) (or Remonstrances).\nLegacy.\nWycliffe was instrumental in the development of a translation of the Bible in English, thus making it accessible to English speakers with poor Latin, though whether he himself translated the Bible, in part or whole, or merely played a part in motivating its translation indirectly through his revival of Oxford biblical studies, is a matter of debate.\nHis theology also had a strong influence on Jan Hus. Hus' \"De Ecclesia\" summarised Wycliffe's work of the same name, with additional material from Wycliffe's \"De potentate papae\". See also Writings of Hus and Wycliffe.\nSeveral institutions are named after him:\nWycliffe is honoured with a commemoration in the Church of England on 31 December, and in the Anglican Church of Canada.\nWycliffe and its variants are popular given names, presumably starting in some Protestant communities \u2013 for example, Haitian rapper and musician Wyclef Jean.\nIn the centre of Lutterworth, a Grade II-listed memorial obelisk to Wycliffe was erected in June 1897 on a site behind which the Wycliffe Memorial Methodist Church was built a few years later for the town's Wesleyan Methodist congregation.\nNotes and references.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

During this brief period he shocked, outraged, and amused audiences with his scandalous black comedies. The adjective \"Ortonesque\" refers to work characterised by a similarly dark yet farcical cynicism.\nEarly life.\nJoe Orton was born on 1 January 1933 at Causeway Lane Maternity Hospital, Leicester, to William Arthur Orton and Elsie Mary Orton (n\u00e9e Bentley). William worked for Leicester County Borough Council as a gardener and Elsie worked in the local footwear industry until tuberculosis cost her a lung. At the time of Joe's birth, William and Mary were living with William's family at 261 Avenue Road Extension in Clarendon Park, Leicester. Joe's younger brother, Douglas, was born in 1935. That year, the Ortons moved to 9 Fayrhurst Road on the Saffron Lane Estate, a council estate. Orton's younger sisters, Marilyn and Leonie, were born in 1939 and 1944, respectively.\nOrton attended Marriot Road Primary School but failed the eleven-plus exam after extended bouts of asthma, and so took a secretarial course at Clark's College in Leicester from 1945 to 1947. He began working as a junior clerk for \u00a33 a week.\nOrton became interested in performing in theatre around 1949 and joined a number of dramatic societies, including the Leicester Dramatic Society. While working on amateur productions he was determined to improve his appearance and physique, buying bodybuilding courses, taking elocution lessons. He was accepted for a scholarship at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art (RADA) in November 1950, and he left the East Midlands for London. His entrance into RADA was delayed until May 1951 by appendicitis.\nOrton met Kenneth Halliwell at RADA in 1951 and moved into a West Hampstead flat with him and two other students that June. Halliwell was seven years older than Orton; they quickly formed a strong relationship and became lovers.\nAfter graduating, both Orton and Halliwell went into regional repertory work: Orton spent four months in Ipswich as an assistant stage manager; Halliwell in Llandudno, Wales. Both returned to London and began to write together. They collaborated on a number of unpublished novels (often imitating Ronald Firbank) with no success at gaining publication. The rejection of their great hope, \"The Last Days of Sodom,\" in 1957 led them to solo works. Orton wrote his last novel, \"The Vision of Gombold Proval\" (posthumously published as \"Head to Toe\"), in 1959. He later drew on these manuscripts for ideas; many show glimpses of his stage-play style.\nConfident of their \"specialness,\" Orton and Halliwell refused to work for long periods. They subsisted on Halliwell's money (and unemployment benefits) and were forced to follow an ascetic life to restrict their spending to \u00a35 a week. From 1957 to 1959, they worked in six-month stretches at Cadbury's to raise money for a new flat; they moved into a small, austere flat at 25 Noel Road in Islington in 1959.\nCrimes and punishment.\nA lack of serious work led them to amuse themselves with pranks and hoaxes. Orton created the second self \"Edna Welthorpe\", an elderly theatre snob, whom he later revived to stir controversy over his plays. Orton chose the name as an allusion to Terence Rattigan's archetypal playgoer \"Aunt Edna\".\nFrom January 1959, Orton and Halliwell began surreptitiously to remove books from several local public libraries and modify the cover art or the blurbs before returning them. A volume of poems by Sir John Betjeman was returned to the library with a new dust jacket featuring a photograph of a nearly naked, heavily tattooed middle-aged man. The couple decorated their flat with many of the prints. They were discovered and prosecuted. On 30 April 1962 they pleaded guilty to two joint charges of theft, the first relating to 36 books taken from Islington Public Library in Essex Road, and the second to 36 books taken from a branch of the same library in Holloway Road. At a further hearing in May 1962 they pleaded guilty to further joint charges of theft and criminal damage, and were sentenced to prison for six months, with fines of \u00a32 each. The incident was reported in the \"Daily Mirror\" as \"Gorilla in the Roses\", illustrated with the altered \"Collins Guide to Roses\" by Bertram Park.\nOrton and Halliwell felt that the sentence was unduly harsh \"because we were queers\". Prison was a crucial formative experience; the isolation from Halliwell allowed Orton to break free of him creatively; and he saw what he considered the corruption, priggishness, and double standards of a purportedly liberal country. As Orton put it: \"It affected my attitude towards society. Before I had been vaguely conscious of something rotten somewhere, prison crystallised this. The old whore society really lifted up her skirts and the stench was pretty foul... Being in the nick brought detachment to my writing. I wasn't involved any more. And suddenly it worked.\" The book covers Orton and Halliwell vandalised have since become a valued part of the Islington Local History Centre collection. Some are exhibited in the Islington Museum.\nA collection of the book covers is available online.\nPlaywright.\nBreakthrough.\nOrton began writing plays in 1959 with \"Fred and Madge\"; \"The Visitors\" followed two years later. In 1963, the BBC paid \u00a365 for the radio play \"The Ruffian on the Stair\", broadcast on 31 August 1964. It was substantially rewritten for the stage in 1966.\nHe had completed \"Entertaining Mr Sloane\" by the time \"Ruffian\" was broadcast. He sent a copy to theatre agent Peggy Ramsay in December 1963. It premiered at the New Arts Theatre in Westminster 6 May 1964, produced by Michael Codron. Reviews ranged from praise to outrage. \"The Times\" described it as making \"the blood boil more than any other British play in the last 10 years\".\n\"Entertaining Mr Sloane\" lost money in its three-week run, but critical praise from playwright Terence Rattigan, who invested \u00a33,000 in it, ensured its survival. The play was transferred to Wyndham's Theatre in the West End at the end of June and to the Queen's Theatre in October. \"Sloane\" tied for first in the \"Variety\" Critics' Poll for Best New Play and Orton came second for Most Promising Playwright. Within a year, \"Sloane\" was performed in New York, Spain, Israel, and Australia as well as made into a film (after Orton's death) and a television play.\n\"Loot\".\nOrton's next performed work was \"Loot\". The first draft was written from June to October 1964 and was called \"Funeral Games\", a title Orton dropped at Halliwell's suggestion but later reused. The play is a wild parody of detective fiction, adding the blackest farce and jabs at established ideas on death, the police, religion, and justice. Orton offered the play to Codron in October 1964 and it underwent sweeping rewrites before it was judged fit for the West End.\nCodron had manoeuvred Orton into meeting his colleague Kenneth Williams in August 1964. Orton reworked \"Loot\" with Williams in mind for Truscott. His other inspiration for the role was DS Harold Challenor. With the success of \"Sloane\", \"Loot\" was hurried into pre-production despite its flaws. Rehearsals began in January 1965, with plans for a six-week tour culminating in a West End debut. The play opened in Cambridge on 1 February to scathing reviews.\nOrton, disagreeing with director Peter Wood over the plot, produced 133 pages of new material to replace, or add to, the original 90. But the play received poor reviews in Brighton, Oxford, Bournemouth, Manchester, and finally Wimbledon in mid-March. Discouraged, Orton and Halliwell went on an 80-day holiday in Tangiers.\nIn January 1966, \"Loot\" was revived, with Oscar Lewenstein taking up an option. Before his production, it had a short run (11\u201323 April) at the University Theatre, Manchester. Orton's growing experience led him to cut over 600 lines, raising the tempo and improving the characters' interactions. Directed by Braham Murray, the play garnered more favourable reviews. Lewenstein put the London production in a \"sort of Off-West End theatre,\" the Jeannetta Cochrane Theatre in Bloomsbury, under the direction of Charles Marowitz.\nOrton clashed with Marowitz, although the additional cuts further improved the play. This production was first staged in London on 27 September 1966, to rave reviews. Ronald Bryden in \"The Observer\" asserted that it had \"established Orton's niche in English drama\". \"Loot\" moved to the Criterion Theatre in November where it ran for 342 performances. This time it won several awards, and Orton sold the film rights for \u00a325,000. \"Loot\", when performed on Broadway in 1968, repeated the failure of \"Sloane\", and the film version of the play was not a success when it surfaced in 1970.\nLater works.\nOver the next ten months, he revised \"The Ruffian on the Stair\" and \"The Erpingham Camp\" for the stage as a double called \"Crimes of Passion\", wrote \"Funeral Games\", the screenplay \"Up Against It\" for the Beatles, and his final full-length play, \"What the Butler Saw\".\n\"The Erpingham Camp\", Orton's take on \"The Bacchae\", written through mid-1965 and offered to Associated-Rediffusion in October of that year, was broadcast on 27 June 1966 as the \"pride\" segment in their series \"Seven Deadly Sins\". \"The Good and Faithful Servant\" was a transitional work for Orton. A one-act television play, it was completed by June 1964 but first broadcast by Associated-Rediffusion on 6 April 1967, representing \"faith\" in the series \"Seven Deadly Virtues\".\nOrton rewrote \"Funeral Games\" four times from July to November 1966. Also intended for \"The Seven Deadly Virtues\", it dealt with charity \u2013 Christian charity \u2013 in a confusion of adultery and murder. Rediffusion did not use the play; instead, it was made as one of the first productions of the new ITV company Yorkshire Television, and broadcast posthumously in the \"Playhouse\" series on 26 August 1968, five weeks after an adaptation of \"Mr Sloane\".\nIn March 1967, Orton and Halliwell had intended another extended holiday in Libya, but they returned home after one day because the only hotel accommodation they could find was a boat that had been converted into a hotel/nightclub. They spent May and June holidaying in Tangier, Morocco, where they frequently engaged in sex with teenage boys.\nOrton's once controversial farce \"What The Butler Saw\" was staged in the West End in 1969, more than 18 months after his death. It opened in March at the Queen's Theatre with Sir Ralph Richardson, Coral Browne, Stanley Baxter and Hayward Morse.\nMurder.\nOn 9 August 1967, Halliwell bludgeoned to death the 34-year-old Orton at their home in Noel Road with nine hammer blows to the head. Halliwell then killed himself with an overdose of Nembutal.\nIn 1970, \"The Sunday Times\" reported that four days before the murder, Orton had told a friend that he wanted to end his relationship with Halliwell, but did not know how to go about it.\nHalliwell's doctor, Douglas Ismay, spoke to him by telephone three times on the day of the murder, and had arranged for him to see a psychiatrist the following morning. The last call was at 10 o'clock, during which Halliwell told the doctor, \"Don't worry, I'm feeling better now. I'll go and see the doctor tomorrow morning.\"\nAccording to Richard Brooks, arts editor of The Sunday Times in 2017, two of Orton's colleagues, producer Richard Curson Smith and actor Kenneth Cranham, said Peter Willes, who had produced two Orton plays for television, was also in love with Orton. It was he who had suggested Halliwell see Dr Ismay, but with a view to his being committed to a mental hospital, thereby separating him from Orton. They blame Willes for being largely responsible for Orton's death.\nHalliwell had felt increasingly threatened and isolated by Orton's success, and had come to rely on antidepressants and barbiturates. The bodies were discovered the following morning when a chauffeur arrived to take Orton to a meeting with director Richard Lester to discuss filming options on \"Up Against It\". Halliwell left a suicide note: \"If you read his diary, all will be explained. KH PS: Especially the latter part.\" This is presumed to be a reference to Orton's description of his promiscuity; the diary contains numerous incidents of cottaging in public lavatories and other casual sexual encounters with teenagers, including with rent boys on holiday in North Africa. The diaries have since been published. The last diary entry is dated 1 August 1967 and ends abruptly in midsentence at the end of the page, suggesting that some pages may be missing.\nOrton was cremated at the Golders Green Crematorium, his maroon cloth-draped coffin was brought into the west chapel to a recording of The Beatles song \"A Day in the Life\". Harold Pinter read the eulogy, concluding with \"He was a bloody marvellous writer.\" Orton's agent Peggy Ramsay described Orton's relatives as \"the little people in Leicester\", leaving a cold, nondescript note and bouquet at the funeral on their behalf.\nAt the suggestion of Halliwell's family, Peggy Ramsay asked Orton's brother Douglas if Orton and Halliwell's ashes could be mixed. Douglas agreed, \"As long as nobody hears about it in Leicester.\" The mixed ashes were scattered in section 3-C of the Garden of Remembrance at Golders Green. There is no memorial.\nBiography and film, radio, TV.\nJohn Lahr's biography of Orton, entitled \"Prick Up Your Ears\" (a title Orton himself had considered using), was published in 1978 by Bloomsbury. A 1987 film adaptation of the same name was released based on Orton's diaries and on Lahr's research. Directed by Stephen Frears, it stars Gary Oldman as Orton, Alfred Molina as Halliwell, and Vanessa Redgrave as Peggy Ramsay. Alan Bennett wrote the screenplay. Katrina Sheldon was the sound editor.\nCarlos Be wrote a play about Orton and Halliwell's last days, \"25 Noel Road: A Genius Like Us\", first performed in 2001. It received its New York premiere in 2012, produced by Repertorio Espa\u00f1ol.\nJoe Orton was played by the actor Kenny Doughty in the 2006 BBC film \"\", starring Michael Sheen as Kenneth Williams.\nLeonie Orton Barnett's memoir \"I Had It in Me\" was published in 2016, containing new information about her brother's life growing up in Leicester.\nIn 2017, film-maker Chris Shepherd made an animated short inspired by Orton's Edna Welthorpe letters, 'Yours Faithfully, Edna Welthorpe (Mrs)', starring Alison Steadman as Edna.\nTwo archive recordings of Orton are known to survive: a short BBC radio interview first transmitted in August 1967, and a video recording, held by the British Film Institute, of his appearance on Eamonn Andrews' ITV chat show, transmitted on 23 April 1967.\nLegacy.\nA pedestrian concourse in front of the Curve theatre in Leicester has been renamed Orton Square.\nIn July 2019, Dr Emma Parker, professor at the University of Leicester and an Orton expert, began a campaign to honour him with a statue in his native city, Leicester. The campaign enjoyed prominent support from the acting community, including from Sheila Hancock, Kenneth Cranham, Ian McKellen and Alec Baldwin. Although the fundraising target was met, the project was cancelled in 2022, with the organisers citing pandemic challenges and changing attitudes to statues in Britain. Orton's sister Leonie stated that Orton's history of sexual encounters with underage boys was a major factor in the failure of the project.\nPlays.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "16488", "revid": "196446", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=16488", "title": "Julian Jaynes", "text": "American psychologist\nJulian Jaynes (February 27, 1920 \u2013 November 21, 1997) was an American psychologist who worked at the universities of Yale and Princeton for nearly 25 years and became best known for his 1976 book \"The Origin of Consciousness in the Breakdown of the Bicameral Mind\". His work focused on the problem of consciousness: \"the difference between what others see of us and our sense of our inner selves and the deep feelings that sustain it. ... Men have been conscious of the problem of consciousness almost since consciousness began.\" Jaynes's solution touches on many disciplines, including neuroscience, linguistics, psychology, archeology, history, religion and analysis of ancient texts.\nEarly life.\nJaynes was born and lived in West Newton, Massachusetts, son of Julian Clifford Jaynes (1854\u20131922), a Unitarian minister, and Clara Bullard Jaynes (1884\u20131980). He had an older sister, Helen, and a younger brother, Robert. The family had a summer home in Keppoch, Prince Edward Island, which was a place Jaynes loved, and which gave him a Canadian connection for his entire life.\nIn the summer of 1939 he registered to attend Harvard University but took a scholarship from McGill University, where he graduated in 1941 with a bachelor's degree in psychology, and then began graduate studies at the University of Toronto to learn more about the brain. His studies were interrupted during the Second World War: because of his Unitarian principles, he applied for and received official recognition as a conscientious objector, but refused to comply with the U.S. government's law for pacifists; Jaynes spent three years in the penitentiary at Lewisburg, Pennsylvania, working in the prison hospital. On his release in 1946 he enrolled at Yale University hoping that in animal behavior he would find clues to the beginnings of consciousness. Jaynes received his master's degree in 1948, and then refused to accept his doctorate, again on a dispute of \"principle\" regarding educational credentials. After Yale, Jaynes spent several years in England working as an actor and playwright.\nAcademic career.\nHe returned to Yale in 1954, working as an Instructor and Lecturer until 1960, making significant contributions in the fields of experimental psychology, learning, and ethology, and co-publishing some papers with Frank A. Beach. Jaynes had begun to turn his focus to comparative psychology and the history of psychology, and in 1964 he became a research associate at Princeton University. There he befriended Edwin G. Boring, and with plenty of time to pursue the problem of consciousness, Princeton became his academic home until 1995.\nResearch and motivations.\nJaynes had dedicated years of research in psychology to the problem of consciousness and he had sought the roots of consciousness in the processes of learning and cognition that animals and humans shared in common, in accord with prevailing evolutionary assumptions that dominated mid-20th century thinking. He had established his reputation in the study of animal learning and natural animal behaviour, and in 1968 he lectured on the history of comparative psychology at the National Science Foundation Summer Institute. In September 1969 he gave his first public address on his \"new theory of consciousness\" at the annual meeting of the American Psychological Association.\nHis \"radical approach\" explained the phenomena of introspection as dependent on culture and language, especially metaphors, more than on the physiology of the brain. This was a challenge to mainstream assumptions of 20th century research, especially to those that justified looking for origins of consciousness in evolution. It was also a challenge to the behaviorists, who, \"under the tutelage of John Watson, solved the problem of consciousness by ignoring it.\" What they had 'ignored' were the problems of introspection and the weaknesses of introspectionist methods of 19th century psychologists. Those 20th century thinkers who questioned the existence of introspection never doubted the existence of sense perception, however; they clearly distinguished between the two. On the other hand, in later years Jaynes's approach had become \"radical\" for emphasizing the distinction. Jaynes differed with those who ignored it, for example Stuart Sutherland, who simply defined consciousness as 'awareness'. Jaynes acknowledged that his whole argument was \"contradictory to the usual and [...] superficial views of consciousness\", and he insisted that \"the most common error\" people make \"is to confuse consciousness with perception.\"\nBut there can be no progress in the science of consciousness until careful distinctions have been made between what is introspectable and all the hosts of other neural abilities we have come to call cognition. Consciousness is not the same as cognition and should be sharply distinguished from it. \nIn the years following, Jaynes talked more about how consciousness began, presenting \"his talk [...] widely, as word of his slightly outrageous but tantalizing theory had spread.\" In 1972 he had delivered a paper, \"The Origin of Consciousness\", at Cornell University, writing: \"For if consciousness is based on language, then it follows that only humans are conscious, and that we became so at some historical epoch after language was evolved.\" This took Jaynes, as he put it, directly into \"the earliest writings of mankind to see if we can find any hints as to when this important invention of consciousness might have occurred.\" He went to ancient texts searching for early evidence of consciousness, and found what he believed to be evidence of remarkably recent voice-hearing without consciousness. In the semi-historical Greek epic the \"Iliad\" Jaynes found \"the earliest writing of men in a language that we can really comprehend, [which] when looked at objectively, reveals a very different mentality from our own.\" In a 1978 interview, Richard Rhodes reported that Jaynes \"took up the study of Greek to trace Greek words for mind back to their origins. By the time he got to the \"Iliad\", the words had become concrete, but there is no word for mind in the \"Iliad\" at all.\"\nPublications and theories.\nJaynes's one and only book, published in 1976, is \"The Origin of Consciousness in the Breakdown of the Bicameral Mind\". The topic of consciousness \u2013 \"the human ability to introspect\" \u2013 is introduced by reviewing prior efforts to explain its problematic nature: those efforts, as one of Jaynes's early critics has acknowledged, add up to a \"spectacular history of failure\". Abandoning the assumption that consciousness is innate, Jaynes explains it instead as a learned behavior that \"arises\u00a0... from language, and specifically from metaphor.\" With this understanding, Jaynes then demonstrates that ancient texts and archeology can reveal a history of human mentality alongside the histories of other cultural products. His analysis of the evidence leads him not only to place the origin of consciousness during the 2nd millennium BCE but also to hypothesize the existence of an older non-conscious \"mentality that he calls the bicameral mind, referring to the brain's two hemispheres\".\nAfter publishing The Origin of Consciousness in the Breakdown of the Bicameral Mind, Jaynes was frequently invited to speak at conferences and as a guest lecturer at other universities. In 1984, he was invited to give the plenary lecture at the Wittgenstein Symposium in Kirchberg, Austria. He gave six major lectures in 1985 and nine in 1986. He was awarded an honorary PhD by Rhode Island College in 1979 and another from Elizabethtown College in 1985.\nJaynes wrote an extensive afterword for the 1990 edition of his book, in which he addressed criticisms and clarified that his theory has four separate hypotheses: 1) consciousness is based on and accessed by language; 2) the non-conscious bicameral mind is based on verbal hallucinations; 3) the breakdown of bicameral mind precedes consciousness, but the dating is variable; 4) the 'double brain' of bicamerality is based on the two hemispheres of the cerebral cortex being organized differently from today's functional lateralization. He also expanded on the impact of consciousness on imagination and memory, notions of the self, emotions, anxiety, guilt, and sexuality.\nDeath.\nJaynes died at the Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Charlottetown, Prince Edward Island, on November 21, 1997. In 2006, his biographers Woodward and Tower reported that Jaynes \"felt he had not truly succeeded\" in his lifelong work because, in their words, \"[h]e was right\" about his feeling that \"there were people who disagreed with him [who] had not really read his book or understood it.\"\nLegacy.\nThe Julian Jaynes Society was founded by Marcel Kuijsten in 1997, shortly after Jaynes's death. The society has published a number of books on Julian Jaynes's theory including foreign-language editions of Julian Jaynes's theory in French, German, and Spanish. The society also maintains a member area, with articles, lectures, and interviews on Jaynes's theory.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "16489", "revid": "44305281", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=16489", "title": "Julia Kristeva", "text": "Bulgarian philosopher (born 1941)\nJulia Kristeva (; ; born Yuliya Stoyanova Krasteva, ; on 24 June 1941) is a Bulgarian-French philosopher, literary critic, semiotician, psychoanalyst, feminist, and novelist who has lived in France since the mid-1960s. She has taught at Columbia University, and is now a professor emerita at Universit\u00e9 Paris Cit\u00e9. The author of more than 30 books, including \"Powers of Horror\", \"Tales of Love\", \"Black Sun: Depression and Melancholia\", \"Proust and the Sense of Time\", and the trilogy \"Female Genius\", she has been awarded Commander of the Legion of Honor, Commander of the Order of Merit, the Holberg International Memorial Prize, the Hannah Arendt Prize, and the Vision 97 Foundation Prize, awarded by the Havel Foundation.\nKristeva became influential in international critical analysis, cultural studies and feminism after publishing her first book, \"Semeiotik\u00e8\", in 1969. Her sizeable body of work includes books and essays that address intertextuality, the semiotic, and abjection, in the fields of linguistics, literary theory and criticism, psychoanalysis, biography and autobiography, political and cultural analysis, art and art history. She is prominent in structuralist and poststructuralist thought.\nKristeva is also the founder of the Simone de Beauvoir Prize committee.\nLife.\nBorn in Sliven, Bulgaria to Christian parents, Kristeva is the daughter of a church accountant. On her mother's side, she has distant Jewish ancestry. Kristeva and her sister attended a Francophone school run by Dominican nuns. Kristeva became acquainted with the work of Mikhail Bakhtin at this time in Bulgaria. Kristeva went on to study at the University of Sofia, and while a postgraduate there obtained a research fellowship that enabled her to move to France in December 1965, when she was 24. She continued her education at several French universities, studying under Lucien Goldmann and Roland Barthes, among other scholars. On August 2, 1967, Kristeva married the novelist Philippe Sollers, born Philippe Joyaux.\nKristeva taught at Columbia University in the early 1970s, and remains a visiting professor. She has also published under the married name Julia Joyaux.\nWork.\nAfter joining the 'Tel Quel group' founded by Sollers, Kristeva focused on the politics of language and became an active member of the group. She trained in psychoanalysis, and earned her degree in 1979. In some ways, her work can be seen as trying to adapt a psychoanalytic approach to the poststructuralist criticism. For example, her view of the subject, and its construction, shares similarities with Sigmund Freud and Jacques Lacan. However, Kristeva rejects any understanding of the subject in a structuralist sense; instead, she favors a subject always \"in process\" or \"on trial\". In this way, she contributes to the poststructuralist critique of essentialized structures, whilst preserving the teachings of psychoanalysis. She travelled to China in the 1970s and later wrote \"About Chinese Women\" (1977).\nThe \"semiotic\" and the \"symbolic\".\nOne of Kristeva's most important contributions is that signification is composed of two elements, the symbolic and the \"semiotic\", the latter being distinct from the discipline of semiotics founded by Ferdinand de Saussure. As explained by Augustine Perumalil, Kristeva's \"semiotic is closely related to the infantile pre-Oedipal referred to in the works of Freud, Otto Rank, Melanie Klein, British Object Relation psychoanalysis, and Lacan's pre-mirror stage. It is an emotional field, tied to the instincts, which dwells in the fissures and prosody of language rather than in the denotative meanings of words.\" Furthermore, according to Birgit Schippers, the semiotic is a realm associated with the musical, the poetic, the rhythmic, and that which lacks structure and meaning. It is closely tied to the \"feminine\", and represents the undifferentiated state of the pre-Mirror Stage infant.\nUpon entering the Mirror Stage, the child learns to distinguish between self and other, and enters the realm of shared cultural meaning, known as the symbolic. In \"Desire in Language\" (1980), Kristeva describes the symbolic as the space in which the development of language allows the child to become a \"speaking subject,\" and to develop a sense of identity separate from the mother. This process of separation is known as abjection, whereby the child must reject and move away from the mother in order to enter into the world of language, culture, meaning, and the social. This realm of language is called the symbolic and is contrasted with the semiotic in that it is associated with the masculine, the law, and structure. Kristeva departs from Lacan in the idea that even after entering the symbolic, the subject continues to oscillate between the semiotic and the symbolic. Therefore, rather than arriving at a fixed identity, the subject is permanently \"in process\". Because female children continue to identify to some degree with the mother figure, they are especially likely to retain a close connection to the semiotic. This continued identification with the mother may result in what Kristeva refers to in \"Black Sun\" (1989) as melancholia (depression), given that female children simultaneously reject and identify with the mother figure.\nIt has also been suggested (e.g., Creed, 1993) that the degradation of women and women's bodies in popular culture (and particularly, for example, in slasher films) emerges because of the threat to identity that the mother's body poses: it is a reminder of time spent in the undifferentiated state of the semiotic, where one has no concept of self or identity. After abjecting the mother, subjects retain an unconscious fascination with the semiotic, desiring to reunite with the mother, while at the same time fearing the loss of identity that accompanies it. Slasher films thus provide a way for audience members to safely reenact the process of abjection by vicariously expelling and destroying the mother figure.\nKristeva is also known for her adoption of Plato\u2019s idea of the \"chora\", meaning \"a nourishing maternal space\" (Schippers, 2011). Kristeva's idea of the \"chora\" has been interpreted in several ways: as a reference to the uterus, as a metaphor for the relationship between the mother and child, and as the temporal period preceding the Mirror Stage. In her essay \"Motherhood According to Giovanni Bellini\" from \"Desire in Language\" (1980), Kristeva refers to the \"chora\" as a \"non-expressive totality formed by drives and their stases in a motility that is as full of movement as it is regulated.\" She goes on to suggest that it is the mother's body that mediates between the \"chora\" and the symbolic realm: the mother has access to culture and meaning, yet also forms a totalizing bond with the child.\nKristeva is also noted for her work on the concept of intertextuality.\nAnthropology and psychology.\nKristeva argues that anthropology and psychology, or the connection between the social and the subject, do not represent each other, but rather follow the same logic: the survival of the group and the subject. Furthermore, in her analysis of Oedipus, she claims that the speaking subject cannot exist on his/her own, but that he/she \"stands on the fragile threshold as if stranded on account of an impossible demarcation\" (\"Powers of Horror\", p.\u00a085).\nIn her comparison between the two disciplines, Kristeva claims that the way in which an individual excludes the abject mother as a means of forming an identity, is the same way in which societies are constructed. On a broader scale, cultures exclude the maternal and the feminine, and by this come into being.\nFeminism.\nKristeva has been regarded as a key proponent of French feminism together with Simone de Beauvoir, H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Cixous, and Luce Irigaray. Kristeva has had a remarkable influence on feminism and feminist literary studies in the US and the UK, as well as on readings into contemporary art although her relation to feminist circles and movements in France has been quite controversial. Kristeva made a famous disambiguation of three types of feminism in \"Women's Time\" in \"New Maladies of the Soul\" (1993); while rejecting the first two types, including that of Beauvoir, her stands are sometimes considered as rejecting feminism altogether. Kristeva proposed the idea of multiple sexual identities against the joined code of \"unified feminine language\".\nDenunciation of identity politics.\nKristeva argues that her writings have been misunderstood by American feminist academics in the identity politics tradition. In Kristeva's view, it was not enough simply to dissect the structure of language in order to find its hidden meaning. Language should also be viewed through the prisms of history and of individual psychic and sexual experiences. This post-structuralist approach enabled specific social groups to trace the source of their oppression to the very language they used. However, Kristeva believes that it is harmful to posit collective identity above individual identity, and that this political assertion of sexual, ethnic, and religious identities is ultimately totalitarian.\nNovelist.\nKristeva has written a number of novels that resemble detective stories. While the books maintain narrative suspense and develop a stylized surface, her readers also encounter ideas intrinsic to her theoretical projects. Her characters reveal themselves mainly through psychological devices, making her type of fiction mostly resemble the later work of Dostoevsky. Her fictional oeuvre, which includes \"The Old Man and the Wolves\", \"Murder in Byzantium\", and \"Possessions\", while often allegorical, also approaches the autobiographical in some passages, especially with one of the protagonists of \"Possessions\", Stephanie Delacour\u2014a French journalist\u2014who can be seen as Kristeva's alter ego. \"Murder in Byzantium\" deals with themes from orthodox Christianity and politics; she referred to it as \"a kind of anti-Da Vinci Code\".\nHonors.\nFor her \"innovative explorations of questions on the intersection of language, culture and literature\", Kristeva was awarded the Holberg International Memorial Prize in 2004. She won the 2006 Hannah Arendt Prize for Political Thought. She has also been awarded Commander of the Legion of Honor, Commander of the Order of Merit, and the Vaclav Havel Prize. On October 10, 2019, she received an \"honoris causa\" doctorate from Universidade Cat\u00f3lica Portuguesa.\nScholarly reception.\nRoman Jakobson said that \"Both readers and listeners, whether agreeing or in stubborn disagreement with Julia Kristeva, feel indeed attracted to her contagious voice and to her genuine gift of questioning generally adopted 'axioms,' and her contrary gift of releasing various 'damned questions' from their traditional question marks.\"\nRoland Barthes comments that \"Julia Kristeva changes the place of things: she always destroys the last prejudice, the one you thought you could be reassured by, could be take [sic] pride in; what she displaces is the already-said, the d\u00e9ja-dit, i.e., the instance of the signified, i.e., stupidity; what she subverts is authority -the authority of monologic science, of filiation.\" \nIan Almond criticizes Kristeva's ethnocentrism. He cites Gayatri Spivak's conclusion that Kristeva's book \"About Chinese Women\" \"belongs to that very eighteenth century [that] Kristeva scorns\" after pinpointing \"the brief, expansive, often completely ungrounded way in which she writes about two thousand years of a culture she is unfamiliar with\". Almond notes the absence of sophistication in Kristeva's remarks concerning the Muslim world and the dismissive terminology she uses to describe its culture and believers. He criticizes Kristeva's opposition which juxtaposes \"Islamic societies\" against \"democracies where life is still fairly pleasant\" by pointing out that Kristeva displays no awareness of the complex and nuanced debate ongoing among women theorists in the Muslim world, and that she does not refer to anything other than the Rushdie fatwa in dismissing the entire Muslim faith as \"reactionary and persecutory\".\nIn \"Impostures intellectuelles\" (1997), physics professors Alan Sokal and Jean Bricmont devote a chapter to Kristeva's use of mathematics in her early writings. They argue that Kristeva fails to show the relevance of the mathematical concepts she discusses to linguistics and the other fields she studies, and that no such relevance exists.\nAlleged collaboration with the Communist Regime in Bulgaria.\nIn 2018, Bulgaria's state Dossier Commission announced that Kristeva had been an agent for the Committee for State Security under the code name \"Sabina\". She was supposedly recruited in June 1971, five years earlier she left Bulgaria to study in France. Under the People's Republic of Bulgaria, any Bulgarian who wanted to travel abroad had to apply for an exit visa and get an approval from the Ministry of Interior. The process was long and difficult because anyone who made it to the west could declare political asylum. Kristeva has called the allegations \"grotesque and false\". On 30 March, the state Dossier Commission began publishing online the entire set of documents reflecting Kristeva's activity as an informant of the former Committee for State Security. She vigorously denies the charges.\nNeal Ascherson wrote: \"...the recent fuss about Julia Kristeva boils down to nothing much, although it has suited some to inflate it into a fearful scandal... But the reality shown in her files is trivial. After settling in Paris in 1965, she was cornered by Bulgarian spooks who pointed out to her that she still had a vulnerable family in the home country. So she agreed to regular meetings over many years, in the course of which she seems to have told her handlers nothing more than gossip about Aragon, Bataille &amp; Co. from the Left Bank caf\u00e9s \u2013 stuff they could have read in \"Le Canard encha\u00een\u00e9\"... the combined intelligence value of its product and her reports was almost zero. The Bulgarian security men seem to have known they were being played. But never mind: they could impress their boss by showing him a real international celeb on their books...\"\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "16493", "revid": "7903804", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=16493", "title": "Just intonation", "text": "Musical tuning based on pure intervals\nIn music, just intonation or pure intonation is a tuning system in which the space between notes' frequencies (called intervals) is a whole number ratio. Intervals spaced in this way are said to be pure, and are called just intervals. Just intervals (and chords created by combining them) consist of tones from a single harmonic series of an implied fundamental. For example, in the diagram, if the notes G3 and C4 (labelled 3 and 4) are tuned as members of the harmonic series of the lowest C, their frequencies will be 3 and 4 times the fundamental frequency. The interval ratio between C4 and G3 is therefore 4:3, a just fourth.\nIn Western musical practice, bowed instruments such as violins, violas, cellos, and double basses are tuned using pure fifths or fourths. In contrast, keyboard instruments are rarely tuned using only pure intervals\u2014the desire for different keys to have identical intervals in Western music makes this impractical. Some instruments of fixed pitch, such as electric pianos, are commonly tuned using equal temperament, in which all intervals other than octaves consist of irrational-number frequency ratios. Acoustic pianos are usually tuned with the octaves slightly widened, and thus with no pure intervals at all.\nThe phrase \"just intonation\" is used both to refer to one specific version of a 5-limit diatonic intonation, that is, Ptolemy's intense diatonic, as well to a whole class of tunings which use whole number intervals derived from the harmonic series. In this sense, \"just intonation\" is differentiated from equal temperaments and the \"tempered\" tunings of the early renaissance and baroque, such as Well temperament, or Meantone temperament. Since 5-limit has been the most prevalent just intonation used in western music, western musicians have subsequently tended to consider this scale to be the only version of just intonation. In principle, there are an infinite number of possible \"just intonations\", since the harmonic series is infinite.\nTerminology.\nJust intonations are categorized by the notion of limits. The limit refers to the highest prime factor included in the intervals of a scale. All the intervals of any 3-limit just intonation will be ratios of powers of 2 and 3. So is included in 5-limit, because it has 5 in the denominator. If a scale uses an interval of 21:20, it is a 7-limit just intonation, since 21 is a multiple of 7. The interval is a 3-limit interval because the numerator and denominator are powers of 3 and 2, respectively. It is possible to have a scale that uses 5-limit intervals but not 2-limit intervals, \"i.e.\" no octaves, such as Wendy Carlos's alpha and beta scales. It is also possible to make diatonic scales that do not use fourths or fifths (3-limit), but use 5- and 7-limit intervals only. Thus, the notion of limit is a helpful distinction, but certainly does not tell us everything there is to know about a particular scale.\nPythagorean tuning, or 3-limit tuning, allows ratios including the numbers 2 and 3 and their powers, such as 3:2, a perfect fifth, and 9:4, a major ninth. Although the interval from C to G is called a perfect fifth for purposes of musical analysis regardless of its tuning method, for purposes of discussing tuning systems musicologists may distinguish between a \"perfect fifth\" created using the 3:2 ratio and a \"tempered fifth\" using some other system, such as meantone or equal temperament.\n5-limit tuning encompasses ratios additionally using the number 5 and its powers, such as 5:4, a major third, and 15:8, a major seventh. The specialized term \"perfect third\" is occasionally used to distinguish the 5:4\u00a0ratio from major thirds created using other tuning methods. 7\u00a0limit and higher systems use higher prime number partials in the overtone series (e.g. 11, 13, 17, etc.)\nCommas are very small intervals that result from minute differences between pairs of just intervals. For example, the (5-limit) 5:4 ratio is different from the Pythagorean (3-limit) major third (81:64) by a difference of 81:80, called the syntonic comma. The septimal comma, the ratio of 64:63, is a 7-limit interval, the distance between the Pythagorean semi-ditone, , and the septimal minor third, 7:6\u00a0, since formula_1\nA cent is a measure of interval size. It is logarithmic in the musical frequency ratios. The octave is divided into 1200 steps, 100 cents for each semitone. Cents are often used to describe how much a just interval deviates from 12-TET. For example, the major third is 400 cents in 12-TET, but the 5th harmonic, 5:4 is 386.314 cents. Thus, the just major third deviates by \u221213.686 cents.\nHistory.\nPythagorean tuning has been attributed to both Pythagoras and Eratosthenes by later writers, but may have been analyzed by other early Greeks or other early cultures as well. The oldest known description of the Pythagorean tuning system appears in Babylonian artifacts.\nDuring the second century AD, Claudius Ptolemy described a 5-limit diatonic scale in his influential text on music theory \"Harmonics\", which he called \"intense diatonic\". Given ratios of string lengths 120, , 100, 90, 80, 75, , and 60, Ptolemy quantified the tuning of what would later be called the Phrygian scale (equivalent to the major scale beginning and ending on the third note) \u2013 16:15, 9:8, 10:9, 9:8, 16:15, 9:8, and 10:9.\nPtolemy describes a variety of other just intonations derived from history (Pythagoras, Philolaus, Archytas, Aristoxenus, Eratosthenes, and Didymus) and several of his own discovery / invention, including many interval patterns in 3-limit, 5-limit, 7-limit, and even an 11-limit diatonic.\nNon-Western music, particularly that built on pentatonic scales, is largely tuned using just intonation. In China, the guqin has a musical scale based on harmonic overtone positions. The dots on its soundboard indicate the harmonic positions: , , , , , , , , , , , , . Indian music has an extensive theoretical framework for tuning in just intonation.\nDiatonic scale.\nThe prominent notes of a given scale may be tuned so that their frequencies form (relatively) small whole number ratios.\nThe 5\u00a0limit diatonic major scale is tuned in such a way that major triads on the tonic, subdominant, and dominant are tuned in the proportion 4:5:6, and minor triads on the mediant and submediant are tuned in the proportion 10:12:15. Because of the two sizes of wholetone \u2013 9:8 (greater wholetone) and 10:9 (lesser wholetone) \u2013 the supertonic must be microtonally lowered by a syntonic comma to form a pure minor triad.\nThe 5\u00a0limit diatonic major scale (Ptolemy's intense diatonic scale) on C is shown in the table below:78\nIn this example the interval from D up to A would be a wolf fifth with the ratio , about 680\u00a0cents; noticeably smaller than the 702\u00a0cents of the pure ratio. This is mentioned by Schenker in reference to the teaching of Bruckner.\nFor a justly tuned diatonic minor scale, the mediant is tuned 6:5 and the submediant is tuned 8:5. It would include a tuning of 9:5 for the subtonic. For example, on A:\nTwelve-tone scale.\nThere are several ways to create a just tuning of the twelve-tone scale.\nPythagorean tuning.\nPythagorean tuning can produce a twelve-tone scale, but it does so by involving ratios of very large numbers, corresponding to natural harmonics very high in the harmonic series that do not occur widely in physical phenomena. This tuning uses ratios involving only powers of 3 and 2, creating a sequence of just fifths or fourths, as follows:\nThe ratios are computed with respect to C (the \"base note\"). Starting from C, they are obtained by moving six steps (around the circle of fifths) to the left and six to the right. Each step consists of a multiplication of the previous pitch by &lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;2\u20443 (descending fifth), &lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;3\u20442 (ascending fifth), or their inversions (&lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;3\u20444 or &lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;4\u20443).\nBetween the enharmonic notes at both ends of this sequence is a pitch ratio of \n , or about 23 cents, known as the Pythagorean comma. To produce a twelve-tone scale, one of them is arbitrarily discarded. The twelve remaining notes are repeated by increasing or decreasing their frequencies by a power of 2 (the size of one or more octaves) to build scales with multiple octaves (such as the keyboard of a piano). A drawback of Pythagorean tuning is that one of the twelve fifths in this scale is badly tuned and hence unusable (the wolf fifth, either F\u266f\u2013D\u266d if G\u266d is discarded, or B\u2013G\u266d if F\u266f is discarded). This twelve-tone scale is fairly close to equal temperament, but it does not offer much advantage for tonal harmony because only the perfect intervals (fourth, fifth, and octave) are simple enough to sound pure. Major thirds, for instance, receive the rather unstable interval of 81:64, sharp of the preferred 5:4 by an 81:80 ratio. The primary reason for its use is that it is extremely easy to tune, as its building block, the perfect fifth, is the simplest and consequently the most consonant interval after the octave and unison.\nPythagorean tuning may be regarded as a \"three-limit\" tuning system, because the ratios can be expressed as a product of integer powers of only whole numbers less than or equal to 3.\nFive-limit tuning.\nA twelve-tone scale can also be created by compounding harmonics up to the fifth: namely, by multiplying the frequency of a given reference note (the base note) by powers of 2, 3, or 5, or a combination of them. This method is called five-limit tuning.\nTo build such a twelve-tone scale (using C as the base note), we may start by constructing a table containing fifteen pitches:\nThe factors listed in the first row and column are powers of 3 and 5, respectively (e.g., \n 3\u22122 ). Colors indicate couples of enharmonic notes with almost identical pitch. The ratios are all expressed relative to C in the centre of this diagram (the base note for this scale). They are computed in two steps:\nNote that the powers of 2 used in the second step may be interpreted as ascending or descending octaves. For instance, multiplying the frequency of a note by 26 means increasing it by 6 octaves. Moreover, each row of the table may be considered to be a sequence of fifths (ascending to the right), and each column a sequence of major thirds (ascending upward). For instance, in the first row of the table, there is an ascending fifth from D and A, and another one (followed by a descending octave) from A to E. This suggests an alternative but equivalent method for computing the same ratios. For instance, one can obtain A, starting from C, by moving one cell to the left and one upward in the table, which means descending by a fifth and ascending by a major third:\n = .\nSince this is below C, one needs to move up by an octave to end up within the desired range of ratios (from 1:1 to 2:1):\n \nA 12\u00a0tone scale is obtained by removing one note for each couple of enharmonic notes. This can be done in four ways that have in common the removal of G\u266d, according to a convention which was valid even for C-based Pythagorean and quarter-comma meantone scales. Note that it is a diminished fifth, close to half an octave, above the tonic C, which is a discordant interval; also its ratio has the largest values in its numerator and denominator of all tones in the scale, which make it least harmonious: All are reasons to avoid it.\nThe following chart shows one way to obtain a 12\u00a0tone scale by removing one note for each pair of enharmonic notes. In this method one discards the first column of the table (labeled \"\").\nThis scale is \"asymmetric\" in the sense that going up from the tonic two semitones we multiply the frequency by , while going down from the tonic two semitones we do not divide the frequency by . For two methods that give \"symmetric\" scales, see .\nExtension of the twelve-tone scale.\nThe table above uses only low powers of 3 and 5 to build the base ratios. However, it can be easily extended by using higher positive and negative powers of the same numbers, such as 52 = 25, 5\u22122 = &lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;1\u204425, 33 = 27, or 3\u22123 = &lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;1\u204427. A scale with 25, 35 or even more pitches can be obtained by combining these base ratios.\nIndian scales.\nIn Indian music, the just diatonic scale described above is used, though there are different possibilities, for instance for the sixth pitch (\"dha\"), and further modifications may be made to all pitches excepting \"sa\" and \"pa\".\nSome accounts of Indian intonation system cite a given 12\u00a0swaras being divided into 22\u00a0shrutis.\nAccording to some musicians, one has a scale of a given 12\u00a0pitches and ten in addition (the tonic, shadja (\"sa\"), and the pure fifth, pancham (\"pa\"), are inviolate (known as achala\nin Indian music theory):\nWhere we have \"two\" ratios for a given letter name or swara, we have a difference of 81:80 (22\u00a0cents), which is the syntonic comma or the praman in Indian music theory. These notes are known as \"chala\". The distance between two letter names comes in to sizes, \"poorna\" (256:243) and \"nyuna\" (25:24). One can see the symmetry, looking at it from the tonic, then the octave.\nPractical difficulties.\nSome fixed just intonation scales and systems, such as the diatonic scale above, produce wolf intervals when the approximately equivalent flat note is substituted for a sharp note not available in the scale, or vice versa. The above scale allows a minor tone to occur next to a semitone which produces the awkward ratio 32:27 for D\u2192F, and still worse, a minor tone next to a fourth giving 40:27 for D\u2192A. Flattening D by a comma to 10:9 alleviates these difficulties but creates new ones: D\u2192G becomes 27:20, and D\u2192B becomes 27:16. This fundamental problem arises in any system of tuning using a limited number of notes.\nOne can have more frets on a guitar (or keys on a piano) to handle both As, 9:8 with respect to G and 10:9 with respect to G so that A\u2192C can be played as 6:5 while A\u2192D can still be played as 3:2. 9:8 and 10:9 are less than of an octave apart, so mechanical and performance considerations have made this approach extremely rare. And the problem of how to tune complex chords such as C6 add 9 (C\u2192E\u2192G\u2192A\u2192D), in typical 5\u00a0limit just intonation, is left unresolved (for instance, A could be 4:3 below D (making it 9:8, if G is 1) or 4:3 above E (making it 10:9, if G is 1) but not both at the same time, so one of the fourths in the chord will have to be an out-of-tune wolf interval). Most complex (added-tone and extended) chords usually require intervals beyond common 5\u00a0limit ratios in order to sound harmonious (for instance, the previous chord could be tuned to 8:10:12:13:18, using the A\u00a0note from the 13th\u00a0harmonic), which implies even more keys or frets. However the frets may be removed entirely \u2013 unfortunately, this makes in-tune fingering of many chords exceedingly difficult, due to the construction and mechanics of the human hand \u2013 and the tuning of most complex chords in just intonation is generally ambiguous.\nSome composers deliberately use these wolf intervals and other dissonant intervals as a way to expand the tone color palette of a piece of music. For example, the extended piano pieces \"The Well-Tuned Piano\" by La\u00a0Monte Young and \"The Harp of New Albion\" by Terry Riley use a combination of very consonant and dissonant intervals for musical effect. In \"Revelation\", Michael Harrison goes even further, and uses the tempo of beat patterns produced by some dissonant intervals as an integral part of several movements.\nWhen tuned in just intonation, many fixed-pitch instruments cannot be played in a new key without retuning the instrument. For instance, if a piano is tuned in just intonation intervals and a minimum of wolf intervals for the key of G, then only one other key (typically E) can have the same intervals, and many of the keys have a very dissonant and unpleasant sound. This makes modulation within a piece, or playing a repertoire of pieces in different keys, impractical to impossible.\nSynthesizers have proven a valuable tool for composers wanting to experiment with just intonation. They can be easily retuned with a microtuner. Many commercial synthesizers provide the ability to use built-in just intonation scales or to create them manually. Wendy Carlos used a system on her 1986 album \"Beauty in the Beast\", where one electronic keyboard was used to play the notes, and another used to instantly set the root note to which all intervals were tuned, which allowed for modulation. On her 1987 lecture album \"Secrets of Synthesis\" there are audible examples of the difference in sound between equal temperament and just intonation.\nMany singers (especially barbershop quartets) and fretless instrument players naturally aim for a more just intonation when playing:\n \"Don't be scared if your intonation differs from that of the piano. It is the piano that is out of tune. The piano with its tempered scale is a compromise in intonation.\" \u2014 Pablo Casals\nIn trying to get a more just system for instruments that is more adaptable like the human voice and fretless instruments, the tuning trade-offs between more consonant harmony versus easy transposability (between different keys) have traditionally been too complicated to solve mechanically, though there have been attempts throughout history with various drawbacks, including the archicembalo.\nSince the advent of personal computing, there have been more attempts to solve the perceived problem by trying to algorithmically solve what many professional musicians have learned through practice and intuition. Four of the main problems are that consonance cannot be perfect for some complex chords, chords can have internal consistency but clash with the overall direction of the piece, and naively adjusting the tuning only taking into account chords in isolation can lead to a drift where the end of the piece is noticeably higher or lower in overall pitch rather than centered.\nSoftware solutions like Hermode Tuning often analyze solutions chord by chord instead of taking in the global context of the whole piece like it's theorized human players do. Since 2017, there has been research to address these problems algorithmically through dynamically adapted just intonation and machine learning.\nSinging and scale-free instruments.\nThe human voice is among the most pitch-flexible instruments in common use. Pitch can be varied with no restraints and adjusted in the midst of performance, without needing to retune. Although the explicit use of just intonation fell out of favour concurrently with the increasing use of instrumental accompaniment (with its attendant constraints on pitch), most a cappella ensembles naturally tend toward just intonation because of the comfort of its stability. Barbershop quartets are a good example of this.\nThe unfretted stringed instruments such as those from the violin family (the violin, the viola, and the cello), and the double bass are quite flexible in the way pitches can be adjusted. Stringed instruments that are not playing with fixed pitch instruments tend to adjust the pitch of key notes such as thirds and leading tones so that the pitches differ from equal temperament.\nTrombones have a slide that allows arbitrary tuning during performance. French horns can be tuned by shortening or lengthening the main tuning slide on the back of the instrument, with each individual rotary or piston slide for each rotary or piston valve, and by using the right hand inside the bell to adjust the pitch by pushing the hand in deeper to flatten the note, or pulling it out to sharpen the note while playing. Some natural horns also may adjust the tuning with the hand in the bell, and valved cornets, trumpets, Flugelhorns, Saxhorns, Wagner tubas, and tubas have overall and valve-by-valve tuning slides, like valved horns.\nWind instruments with valves are biased towards natural tuning and must be micro-tuned if equal temperament is required.\nOther wind instruments, although built to a certain scale, can be micro-tuned to a certain extent by using the embouchure or adjustments to fingering.\nWestern composers.\nComposers often impose a limit on how complex the ratios may become. For example, a composer who chooses to write in 7-limit just intonation will not employ ratios that use powers of prime numbers larger than 7. Under this scheme, ratios like 11:7 and 13:6 would not be permitted, because 11 and 13 cannot be expressed as powers of those prime numbers \u2264 7 (\"i.e.\" 2, 3, 5, and 7).\nStaff notation.\nOriginally a system of notation to describe scales was devised by Hauptmann and modified by Helmholtz (1877); the starting note is presumed Pythagorean; a \"+\" is placed between if the next note is a just major third up, a \"\u2212\" if it is a just minor third, among others; finally, subscript numbers are placed on the second note to indicate how many syntonic commas (81:80) to lower by. For example, the Pythagorean major third on C is C+E () while the just major third is C+E1 (). A similar system was devised by Carl Eitz and used in Barbour (1951) in which Pythagorean notes are started with and positive or negative superscript numbers are added indicating how many commas (81:80, syntonic comma) to adjust by. For example, the Pythagorean major third on C is C\u2212E0 while the just major third is C\u2212E\u22121. An extension of this Pythagorean-based notation to higher primes is the \"Helmholtz / Ellis / Wolf / Monzo system\" of ASCII symbols and prime-factor-power vectors described in Monzo's \"Tonalsoft Encyclopaedia\".\nWhile these systems allow precise indication of intervals and pitches in print, more recently some composers have been developing notation methods for Just Intonation using the conventional five-line staff. James Tenney, amongst others, preferred to combine JI ratios with cents deviations from the equal tempered pitches, indicated in a legend or directly in the score, allowing performers to readily use electronic tuning devices if desired.\nBeginning in the 1960s, Ben Johnston had proposed an alternative approach, redefining the understanding of conventional symbols (the seven \"white\" notes, the sharps and flats) and adding further accidentals, each designed to extend the notation into higher prime limits. His notation \"begins with the 16th-century Italian definitions of intervals and continues from there.\" Johnston notation is based on a diatonic C Major scale tuned in JI (Fig.\u00a04), in which the interval between D (9:8 above C) and A (5:3 above C) is one syntonic comma less than a Pythagorean perfect fifth 3:2. To write a perfect fifth, Johnston introduces a pair of symbols, + and \u2212 again, to represent this comma. Thus, a series of perfect fifths beginning with F would proceed C G D A+ E+ B+. The three conventional white notes A E B are tuned as Ptolemaic major thirds (5:4) above F C G respectively. Johnston introduces new symbols for the septimal ( &amp; ), undecimal (\u2191 &amp; \u2193), tridecimal ( &amp; ), and further prime-number extensions to create an accidental based exact JI notation for what he has named \"Extended Just Intonation\" (Fig.\u00a02 &amp; Fig.\u00a03). For example, the Pythagorean major third on C is C-E+ while the just major third is C-E\u266e (Fig.\u00a04).\nIn 2000\u20132004, Marc Sabat and Wolfgang von Schweinitz worked in Berlin to develop a different accidental-based method, the Extended Helmholtz-Ellis JI Pitch Notation. Following the method of notation suggested by Helmholtz in his classic \"On the Sensations of Tone as a Physiological Basis for the Theory of Music\", incorporating Ellis' invention of cents, and continuing Johnston's step into \"Extended JI\", Sabat and Schweinitz propose unique symbols (accidentals) for each prime dimension of harmonic space. In particular, the conventional flats, naturals and sharps define a Pythagorean series of perfect fifths. The Pythagorean pitches are then paired with new symbols that commatically alter them to represent various other partials of the harmonic series (Fig.\u00a01). To facilitate quick estimation of pitches, cents indications may be added (e.g. downward deviations below and upward deviations above the respective accidental). A typically used convention is that cent deviations refer to the \"tempered pitch\" implied by the flat, natural, or sharp. A complete legend and fonts for the notation (see samples) are open source and available from the Plainsound Music Edition website. For example, the Pythagorean major third on C is C-E\u266e while the just major third is C-E\u266e\u2193 (see Fig.\u00a04 for \"combined\" symbol)\nSagittal notation (from Latin \"sagitta\", \"arrow\") is a system of arrow-like accidentals that indicate prime-number comma alterations to tones in a Pythagorean series. It is used to notate both just intonation and equal temperaments. The size of the symbol indicates the size of the alteration.\nThe great advantage of such notation systems is that they allow the natural harmonic series to be precisely notated. At the same time, they provide some degree of practicality through their extension of staff notation, as traditionally trained performers may draw on their intuition for roughly estimating pitch height. This may be contrasted with the more abstract use of ratios for representing pitches in which the amount by which two pitches differ and the \"direction\" of change may not be immediately obvious to most musicians. One caveat is the requirement for performers to learn and internalize a (large) number of new graphical symbols. However, the use of unique symbols reduces harmonic ambiguity and the potential confusion arising from indicating only cent deviations.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Best known for writing \"The Jewish War\", he was born in Jerusalem\u2014then part of the Roman province of Judea\u2014to a father of priestly descent and a mother who claimed Hasmonean royal ancestry.\nHe initially fought against the Roman Empire during the First Jewish\u2013Roman War as general of the Jewish forces in Galilee, until surrendering in AD\u00a067 to the Roman army led by Vespasian after the six-week siege of Yodfat. Josephus claimed the Jewish messianic prophecies that initiated the First Jewish\u2013Roman War made reference to Vespasian becoming Roman emperor. In response, Vespasian decided to keep him as a slave and presumably interpreter. After Vespasian became emperor in AD\u00a069, he granted Josephus his freedom, at which time Josephus assumed the Emperor's family name of \"Flavius\".\nFlavius Josephus fully defected to the Roman side and was granted Roman citizenship. He became an advisor and close associate of Vespasian's son Titus, serving as his translator during Titus's protracted siege of Jerusalem in AD 70, which resulted in the near-total razing of the city and the destruction of the Second Temple.\nJosephus recorded the Great Jewish Revolt (AD 66\u201370), including the siege of Masada. His most important works were \"The Jewish War\" (c.\u200975) and \"Antiquities of the Jews\" (c.\u00a094). \"The Jewish War\" recounts the Jewish revolt against Roman occupation. \"Antiquities of the Jews\" recounts the history of the world from a Jewish perspective for an ostensibly Greek and Roman audience. These works provide insight into first-century Judaism and the background of Early Christianity. Josephus's works are the chief source next to the Bible for the history and antiquity of ancient Israel, and provide an independent extra-biblical account of such figures as Pontius Pilate, Herod the Great, John the Baptist, James, brother of Jesus, and Jesus of Nazareth.\nBiography.\nJosephus was born into one of Jerusalem's elite families. He was the second-born son of Matthias, a Jewish priest. His older full-blooded brother was also, like his father, called Matthias. Their mother was an aristocratic woman who was descended from the royal and formerly ruling Hasmonean dynasty. Josephus's paternal grandparents were a man also named Joseph(us) and his wife\u2014an unnamed Hebrew noblewoman\u2014distant relatives of each other. Josephus's family was wealthy. He descended through his father from the priestly order of the Jehoiarib, which was the first of the 24 orders of priests in the Temple in Jerusalem. Josephus calls himself a fourth-generation descendant of \"High Priest Jonathan\", referring to either Jonathan Apphus or Alexander Jannaeus. He was raised in Jerusalem and educated alongside his brother.\nAt around 26 years old, Josephus traveled to Rome to negotiate the release of Jewish priests imprisoned there by Nero. With the assistance of Nero's wife, Poppaea, and a Jewish actor, he succeeded in securing their freedom. Upon his return to Jerusalem, at the outbreak of the First Jewish\u2013Roman War, Josephus was appointed the military governor of Galilee. His arrival in Galilee, however, was fraught with internal division: the inhabitants of Sepphoris and Tiberias opted to maintain peace with the Romans; the people of Sepphoris enlisted the help of the Roman army to protect their city, while the people of Tiberias appealed to King Agrippa's forces to protect them from the insurgents. Josephus trained 65,000 troops in the region.\nJosephus also contended with John of Gischala who had also set his sight over the control of Galilee. Like Josephus, John had amassed to himself a large band of supporters from Gischala (Gush Halab) and Gabara, including the support of the Sanhedrin in Jerusalem. Meanwhile, Josephus fortified several towns and villages in Lower Galilee, among which were Tiberias, Bersabe, Selamin, Japha, and Tarichaea, in anticipation of a Roman onslaught. In Upper Galilee, he fortified the towns of Jamnith, Seph, Mero, and Achabare, among other places. Josephus, with the Galileans under his command, managed to bring both Sepphoris and Tiberias into subjection, but was eventually forced to relinquish his hold on Sepphoris by the arrival of Roman forces under Placidus the tribune and later by Vespasian himself. Josephus first engaged the Roman army at a village called Garis, where he launched an attack against Sepphoris a second time, before being repulsed. At length, he resisted the Roman army in its siege of Yodfat (Jotapata) until it fell to the Roman army in the lunar month of Tammuz, in the thirteenth year of Nero's reign.\nAfter the Jewish garrison of Yodfat fell under siege, the Romans invaded, killing thousands; the survivors committed suicide. According to Josephus, he was trapped in a cave with 40 of his companions in July 67 AD. The Romans (commanded by Flavius Vespasian and his son Titus, both subsequently Roman emperors) asked the group to surrender, but they refused. According to Josephus's account, he suggested a method of collective suicide; they drew lots and killed each other, one by one, and Josephus happened to be one of two men that were left who surrendered to the Roman forces and became prisoners. In 69 AD, Josephus was released. According to his account, he acted as a negotiator with the defenders during the siege of Jerusalem in 70 AD, during which time his parents were held as hostages by Simon bar Giora.\nWhile being confined at Yodfat (Jotapata), Josephus claimed to have experienced a divine revelation that later led to his speech predicting Vespasian would become emperor. After the prediction came true, he was released by Vespasian, who considered his gift of prophecy to be divine. Josephus wrote that his revelation had taught him three things: that God, the creator of the Jewish people, had decided to \"punish\" them; that \"fortune\" had been given to the Romans; and that God had chosen him \"to announce the things that are to come\". To many Jews, such claims were simply self-serving.\nJosephus interpreted the destruction of the Temple as a sign that God had turned to the Romans due to Jewish sins, urging submission to Roman authority. However, he also believed that the covenant between God and Israel remained intact, with restoration dependent on Jewish repentance, echoing biblical interpretations of the First Temple's destruction.\nIn 71 AD, he went to Rome as part of the entourage of Titus. There, he became a Roman citizen and client of the ruling Flavian dynasty. In addition to Roman citizenship, he was granted accommodation in the conquered Judaea and a pension. While in Rome and under Flavian patronage, Josephus wrote all of his known works. Although he only ever calls himself \"Josephus\" in his writings, later historians refer to him as \"Flavius Josephus\", confirming that he adopted the \"nomen\" Flavius from his patrons, as was the custom amongst freedmen.\nVespasian arranged for Josephus to marry a captured Jewish woman, whom he later divorced. Around the year 71, Josephus married an Alexandrian Jewish woman as his third wife. They had three sons, of whom only Flavius Hyrcanus survived childhood. Josephus later divorced his third wife. Around 75, he married his fourth wife, a Greek Jewish woman from Crete, who was a member of a distinguished family. They had two sons, Flavius Justus and Flavius Simonides Agrippa.\nJosephus's life story remains ambiguous. He was described by Harris in 1985 as a law-observant Jew who believed in the compatibility of Judaism and Graeco-Roman thought, commonly referred to as Hellenistic Judaism. \"Josippon\", the Hebrew version of Josephus, contains changes. His critics were never satisfied as to why his suicide attempt did not kill him in Galilee, and after his capture, accepted the patronage of Romans.\nScholarship and impact on history.\nThe works of Josephus provide information about the First Jewish\u2013Roman War and also represent literary source material for understanding the context of the Dead Sea Scrolls and late Temple Judaism.\nJosephan scholarship had traditionally identified him as a Pharisee. Some authors portrayed him as a member of the sect and as a traitor to the Jewish nation\u2014a view which became known as the classical concept of Josephus. In the mid-20th century, scholars challenged this view and formulated the modern concept of Josephus. They consider him a Pharisee but describe him in part as patriot and a historian of some standing. In his 1991 book, Steve Mason argued that Josephus was not a Pharisee but an orthodox Aristocrat-Priest who became associated with the philosophical school of the Pharisees as a matter of deference, and not by willing association.\nImpact on history and archaeology.\nThe works of Josephus include useful material for historians about individuals, groups, customs, and geographical places. However, modern historians have been cautious of taking his writings at face value. For example, Carl Ritter, in his highly influential \"Erdkunde\" in the 1840s, wrote in a review of authorities on the ancient geography of the region:\nOutside of the Scriptures, Josephus holds the first and the only place among the native authors of Judaea; for Philo of Alexandria, the later Talmud, and other authorities, are of little service in understanding the geography of the country. Josephus is, however, to be used with great care. As a Jewish scholar, as an officer of Galilee, as a military man, and a person of great experience in everything belonging to his own nation, he attained to that remarkable familiarity with his country in every part, which his antiquarian researches so abundantly evince. But he was controlled by political motives: his great purpose was to bring his people, the despised Jewish race, into honour with the Greeks and Romans; and this purpose underlay every sentence, and filled his history with distortions and exaggerations.\nJosephus mentions that in his day there were 240 towns and villages scattered across Upper and Lower Galilee, some of which he names. Josephus's works are the primary source for the chain of Jewish high priests during the Second Temple period. A few of the Jewish customs named by him include the practice of hanging a linen curtain at the entrance to one's house, and the Jewish custom to partake of a Sabbath-day's meal around the sixth-hour of the day (at noon). He notes also that it was permissible for Jewish men to marry many wives (polygamy). His writings provide a significant, extra-Biblical account of the post-Exilic period of the Maccabees, the Hasmonean dynasty, and the rise of Herod the Great. He also describes the Sadducees, the Pharisees and Essenes, the Herodian Temple, Quirinius's census and the Zealots, and such figures as Pontius Pilate, Herod the Great, Agrippa\u00a0I and Agrippa\u00a0II, John the Baptist, James the brother of Jesus, and Jesus. Josephus represents an important source for studies of immediate post-Temple Judaism and the context of early Christianity.\nA careful reading of Josephus's writings and years of excavation allowed Ehud Netzer, an archaeologist from Hebrew University, to discover what he considered to be the location of Herod's Tomb, after searching for 35 years. It was above aqueducts and pools, at a flattened desert site, halfway up the hill to the Herodium, 12\u00a0km south of Jerusalem\u2014as described in Josephus's writings. In October 2013, archaeologists Joseph Patrich and Benjamin Arubas challenged the identification of the tomb as that of Herod. According to Patrich and Arubas, the tomb is too modest to be Herod's and has several unlikely features. Roi Porat, who replaced Netzer as excavation leader after the latter's death, stood by the identification.\nJosephus's writings provide the first-known source for many stories considered as Biblical history, despite not being found in the Bible or related material. These include Ishmael as the founder of the Arabs, the connection of \"Semites\", \"Hamites\" and \"Japhetites\" to the classical nations of the world, and the story of the siege of Masada.\nJosephus's original audience.\nScholars debate about Josephus's intended audience. For example, \"Antiquities of the Jews\" could be written for Jews\u2014\"a few scholars from Laqueur onward have suggested that Josephus must have written primarily for fellow Jews (if also secondarily for Gentiles). The most common motive suggested is repentance: in later life he felt so bad about the traitorous \"War\" that he needed to demonstrate \u2026 his loyalty to Jewish history, law and culture.\" However, Josephus's \"countless incidental remarks explaining basic Judean language, customs and laws \u2026 assume a Gentile audience. He does not expect his first hearers to know anything about the laws or Judean origins.\" The issue of who would read this multi-volume work is unresolved. Other possible motives for writing \"Antiquities\" could be to dispel the misrepresentation of Jewish origins or as an apologetic to Greek cities of the Diaspora in order to protect Jews and to Roman authorities to garner their support for the Jews facing persecution.\nLater rabbinic authorities condemned or marginalized Josephus, and he is largely absent from traditional Jewish sources until Isaac Abarbanel, who was fluent in Latin and differentiated between the different compositions of Josephus, one addressed to the Jews in Hebrew and another in Greek and Latin. In some places Abarbanel refers to Joseph ben Gurion but appears to be referencing the Sefer Yosippon.\nLiterary influence and translations.\nJosephus was a very popular writer with Christians in the 4th century and beyond as an independent source to the events before, during, and after the life of Jesus of Nazareth. Josephus was always accessible in the Greek-reading Eastern Mediterranean. His works were translated into Latin, but often in abbreviated form such as Pseudo-Hegesippus's 4th century Latin version of \"The Jewish War\" (). Christian interest in \"The Jewish War\" was largely out of interest in the downfall of the Jews and the Second Temple, which was widely considered by Christians to be divine punishment for the crime of killing Jesus. Improvements in printing technology (the Gutenberg Press) led to his works receiving a number of new translations into the vernacular languages of Europe, generally based on the Latin versions. Only in 1544 did a version of the standard Greek text become available in French, edited by the Dutch humanist Arnoldus Arlenius. The first English translation, by Thomas Lodge, appeared in 1602, with subsequent editions appearing throughout the 17th century. The 1544 Greek edition formed the basis of the 1732 English translation by William Whiston, which achieved enormous popularity in the English-speaking world. It was often the book\u2014after the Bible\u2014that Christians most frequently owned. Whiston claimed that certain works by Josephus had a similar style to the Epistles of St. Paul. Later editions of the Greek text include that of Benedikt Niese, who made a detailed examination of all the available manuscripts, mainly from France and Spain. Henry St. John Thackeray and successors such as Ralph Marcus used Niese's version for the Loeb Classical Library edition widely used today.\nOn the Jewish side, Josephus was far more obscure, as he was perceived as a traitor. Rabbinical writings for a millennium after his death (e.g. the Mishnah) almost never call out Josephus by name, although they sometimes tell parallel tales of the same events that Josephus narrated. An Italian Jew writing in the 10th century indirectly brought Josephus back to prominence among Jews: he authored the \"Yosippon\", which paraphrases Pseudo-Hegesippus's Latin version of \"The Jewish War\", a Latin version of \"Antiquities\", as well as other works. The epitomist also adds in his own snippets of history at times. Jews generally distrusted Christian translations of Josephus until the \"Haskalah\" (\"Jewish Enlightenment\") in the 19th century, when sufficiently \"neutral\" vernacular language translations were made. Kalman Schulman finally created a Hebrew translation of the Greek text of Josephus in 1863, although many rabbis continued to prefer the Yosippon version. By the 20th century, Jewish attitudes toward Josephus had softened, as he gave the Jews a respectable place in classical history. Various parts of his work were reinterpreted as more inspiring and favorable to the Jews than the Renaissance translations by Christians had been. Notably, the last stand at Masada (described in \"The Jewish War\"), which past generations had deemed insane and fanatical, received a more positive reinterpretation as an inspiring call to action in this period.\nThe standard \"editio maior\" of the various Greek manuscripts is that of Benedictus Niese, published 1885\u201395. The text of \"Antiquities\" is damaged in some places. In the \"Life\", Niese follows mainly manuscript P, but refers also to AMW and R. Henry St. John Thackeray for the Loeb Classical Library has a Greek text also mainly dependent on P. Andr\u00e9 Pelletier edited a new Greek text for his translation of \"Life\". The ongoing M\u00fcnsteraner Josephus-Ausgabe of M\u00fcnster University will provide a new critical apparatus. Late Old Slavonic translations of the Greek also exist, but these contain a large number of Christian interpolations.\nEvaluation as a military commander.\nAuthor Joseph Raymond calls Josephus \"the Jewish Benedict Arnold\" for betraying his own troops at Jotapata, while historian Mary Smallwood, in the introduction to the translation of \"The Jewish War\" by G. A. Williamson, writes:&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;[Josephus] was conceited, not only about his own learning, but also about the opinions held of him as commander both by the Galileans and by the Romans; he was guilty of shocking duplicity at Jotapata, saving himself by sacrifice of his companions; he was too naive to see how he stood condemned out of his own mouth for his conduct, and yet no words were too harsh when he was blackening his opponents; and after landing, however involuntarily, in the Roman camp, he turned his captivity to his own advantage, and benefited for the rest of his days from his change of side.\nHistoriography and Josephus.\nIn the Preface to \"Jewish Wars\", Josephus criticizes historians who misrepresent the events of the Jewish\u2013Roman War, writing that \"they have a mind to demonstrate the greatness of the Romans, while they still diminish and lessen the actions of the Jews.\" Josephus states that his intention is to correct this method but that he \"will not go to the other extreme\u00a0... [and] will prosecute the actions of both parties with accuracy.\" Josephus confesses he will be unable to contain his sadness in transcribing these events; to illustrate this will have little effect on his historiography, Josephus suggests, \"But if any one be inflexible in his censures of me, let him attribute the facts themselves to the historical part, and the lamentations to the writer himself only.\"\nHis preface to \"Antiquities\" offers his opinion early on, saying, \"Upon the whole, a man that will peruse this history, may principally learn from it, that all events succeed well, even to an incredible degree, and the reward of felicity is proposed by God.\" After inserting this attitude, Josephus contradicts Berossus: \"I shall accurately describe what is contained in our records, in the order of time that belongs to them\u00a0... without adding any thing to what is therein contained, or taking away any thing therefrom.\" He notes the difference between history and philosophy by saying, \"[T]hose that read my book may wonder how it comes to pass, that my discourse, which promises an account of laws and historical facts, contains so much of philosophy.\"\nIn both works, Josephus emphasizes that accuracy is crucial to historiography. Louis H. Feldman notes that in \"Wars\", Josephus commits himself to critical historiography, but in \"Antiquities\", Josephus shifts to rhetorical historiography, which was the norm of his time. Feldman notes further that it is significant that Josephus called his later work \"Antiquities\" (literally, archaeology) rather than history; in the Hellenistic period, archaeology meant either \"history from the origins or archaic history.\" Thus, his title implies a Jewish peoples' history from their origins until the time he wrote. This distinction is significant to Feldman, because \"in ancient times, historians were expected to write in chronological order,\" while \"antiquarians wrote in a systematic order, proceeding topically and logically\" and included all relevant material for their subject. Antiquarians moved beyond political history to include institutions and religious and private life. Josephus does offer this wider perspective in \"Antiquities\".\nWorks.\nThe works of Josephus are major sources of our understanding of Jewish life and history during the first century.\n\"The Jewish War\".\nHis first work in Rome was an account addressed to certain \"upper barbarians\"\u2014usually thought to be the Jewish community in Mesopotamia\u2014in his \"paternal tongue\" (\"War\" I.3), arguably the Western Aramaic language. In AD 78 he finished a seven-volume account, written in Greek, known as \"The Jewish War\" ( or \"\"). The history starts with the period of the Maccabees and concludes with accounts of the fall of Jerusalem, and the subsequent fall of the fortresses of Herodion, Macharont and Masada and the Roman victory celebrations in Rome, the mopping-up operations, Roman military operations elsewhere in the empire and the uprising in Cyrene. Together with the account in his \"Life\" of some of the same events, it also provides the reader with an overview of Josephus's own part in the events since his return to Jerusalem from a brief visit to Rome in the early 60s (\"Life\" 13\u201317).\nIn the wake of the suppression of the Jewish revolt, Josephus would have witnessed the marches of Titus's triumphant legions leading their Jewish captives, and carrying treasures from the despoiled Temple in Jerusalem. It was against this background that Josephus wrote his \"War\". He blames the Jewish War on what he calls \"unrepresentative and over-zealous fanatics\" among the Jews, who led the masses away from their traditional aristocratic leaders (like himself), with disastrous results. For example, Josephus writes that \"Simon [bar Giora] was a greater terror to the people than the Romans themselves.\" Josephus also blames some of the Roman governors of Judea, representing them as corrupt and incompetent administrators.\n\"Antiquities of the Jews\".\nThe next work by Josephus is his 21-volume \"Antiquities of the Jews\", completed during the last year of the reign of the Emperor Flavius Domitian, around 93 or 94 AD. In expounding Jewish history, law and custom, he is entering into many philosophical debates current in Rome at that time. Again he offers an \"apologia\" for the antiquity and universal significance of the Jewish people. Josephus claims to be writing this history because he \"saw that others perverted the truth of those actions in their writings\", those writings being the history of the Jews. In terms of some of his sources for the project, Josephus says that he drew from and \"interpreted out of the Hebrew Scriptures\" and that he was an eyewitness to the wars between the Jews and the Romans, which were earlier recounted in \"Jewish Wars\".\nHe outlines Jewish history beginning with the creation, as passed down through Jewish historical tradition. Abraham taught science to the Egyptians, who, in turn, taught the Greeks. Moses set up a senatorial priestly aristocracy, which, like that of Rome, resisted monarchy. The great figures of the Tanakh are presented as ideal philosopher-leaders. He includes an autobiographical appendix defending his conduct at the end of the war when he cooperated with the Roman forces.\nLouis H. Feldman outlines the difference between calling this work \"Antiquities of the Jews\" instead of \"History of the Jews\". Although Josephus says that he describes the events contained in \"Antiquities\" \"in the order of time that belongs to them,\" Feldman argues that Josephus \"aimed to organize [his] material systematically rather than chronologically\" and had a scope that \"ranged far beyond mere political history to political institutions, religious and private life.\"\n\"Life of Flavius Josephus\".\nAn autobiographical text written by Josephus in approximately 94\u201399 AD \u2013 possibly as an appendix to his \"Antiquities of the Jews\" (cf. Life 430) \u2013 where the author for the most part re-visits the events of the War and his tenure in Galilee as governor and commander, apparently in response to allegations made against him by Justus of Tiberias (cf. Life 336).\n\"Against Apion\".\nJosephus's \"Against Apion\" is a two-volume defence of Judaism as classical religion and philosophy, stressing its antiquity, as opposed to what Josephus claimed was the relatively more recent tradition of the Greeks. Some anti-Judaic allegations ascribed by Josephus to the Greek writer Apion and myths accredited to Manetho are also addressed.\nNotes and references.\nExplanatory notes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nGeneral and cited sources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Blume began writing in 1959 and has published more than 26 novels. Among her best-known works are \"Superfudge\" (1980), \"Are You There God? It's Me, Margaret.\" (1970), \"Tales of a Fourth Grade Nothing\" (1972), \"Deenie\" (1973), \"Blubber\" (1974) and \"Double Fudge\" (2002). Blume's books have significantly contributed to children's and young adult literature. She was named one of the 100 most influential people in the world by \"Time\" magazine in 2023.\nBlume was born and raised in Elizabeth, New Jersey, and graduated from New York University in 1961. As an attempt to entertain herself in her role as a homemaker, Blume began writing stories. Blume was one of the first young adult authors to write novels focused on such controversial topics as masturbation, menstruation, teen sex, birth control, and death. Her novels have sold over 82 million copies and have been translated into 32 languages.\nBlume has won many awards for her writing, including the American Library Association (ALA)'s Margaret A. Edwards Award in 1996 for her contributions to young adult literature. She was recognized as a Library of Congress Living Legend and awarded the 2004 National Book Foundation medal for distinguished contribution to American letters.\nBlume's novels are popular and widely admired. They are praised for teaching children and young adults about their bodies. However, in the United States, the topics of her works have generated criticism, controversy and she is one of the most frequently banned authors in US schools and libraries. There have been several film adaptations of Blume's novels, including \"Tiger Eyes\", released in 2012 with Willa Holland starring as Davey, and \"Are You There God? It's Me, Margaret.\", released in 2023. A large collection of her papers are held at the Beinecke Rare Book &amp; Manuscript Library at Yale University.\nThe Peabody Award-winning documentary \"Judy Blume Forever\" chronicles Blume's work.\nBiography.\nEarly life.\nBlume was born Judith Sussman on February 12, 1938, and raised in Elizabeth, New Jersey, the daughter of homemaker Esther Sussman (n\u00e9e Rosenfeld) and dentist Rudolph Sussman. She has a brother, David, who is five years older. Her family is Jewish. Blume witnessed hardships and death throughout her childhood. When she was in third grade, Blume's older brother had a kidney infection that led Blume, her brother, and her mother to temporarily move to Miami Beach to help him recover for two years. Blume's father stayed behind to continue working. Additionally, in 1951 and 1952, there were three airplane crashes in her hometown of Elizabeth (1951 Miami Airlines C-46 crash, American Airlines Flight 6780, and National Airlines Flight 101). 121 people died in these crashes, and Blume's father, who was a dentist, helped to identify the unrecognizable remains. Blume says she \"buried\" these memories until she began writing her 2015 novel \"In the Unlikely Event\", the plot of which revolves around the crashes. Throughout her childhood, Blume participated in many creative activities such as dance and piano. Blume describes her love of reading as a trait passed on by her parents. She has recalled spending much of her childhood creating stories in her head. Despite the love of stories, as a child Blume did not dream of being a writer.\nBlume graduated from the all-girls' Battin High School in 1956, then enrolled in Boston University. A few weeks into the first semester, she was diagnosed with mononucleosis and took a brief leave from school. In 1959, Blume's father died. Later that same year, on August 15, 1959, she married lawyer John M. Blume, whom she had met while a student at New York University. She graduated from New York University in 1961 with a bachelor's degree in Education.\nAdult life.\nAfter college, Blume gave birth to daughter Randy Lee Blume in 1961 and became a homemaker. In 1963, her son Lawrence Andrew Blume was born. Blume began writing when her children began nursery school. John M. Blume and Judy Blume were divorced in 1975. (John M. Blume later died on September 20, 2020.) Shortly after her separation, she met Thomas A. Kitchens, a physicist. The couple married in 1976, and moved to Los Alamos, New Mexico for two years for Kitchens' work. They divorced in 1978.\nA few years later, a mutual friend introduced her to George Cooper, a former law professor turned non-fiction writer. Blume and Cooper were married in 1987. Cooper has one daughter from a previous marriage, Amanda, to whom Blume is very close.\nIn August 2012, Blume announced that she was diagnosed with breast cancer after undergoing a routine ultrasound before leaving for a five-week trip to Italy. Six weeks after her diagnosis, Blume underwent a mastectomy and breast reconstruction. Blume was cancer-free following this surgery and able to recover.\nRandy Blume became a therapist with a sub-specialty in helping writers complete their works. She has one child, Elliot Kephart, who is credited with encouraging his grandmother, Judy Blume, to write the most recent \"Fudge\" books. Lawrence Blume is now a movie director, producer, and writer. As of 2021, Cooper and Blume resided in Key West.\nCareer.\nA lifelong avid reader, Blume first began writing through New York University courses when her children were attending preschool. Following two years of publisher rejections, Blume published her first book, \"The One in the Middle Is the Green Kangaroo\", in 1969. A year later, Blume published her second book, \"Iggie's House\" (1970), which was originally written as a story in \"Trailblazer\" magazine but then rewritten by Blume into a book. The decade that followed proved to be her most prolific, with 13 more books being published. Her third book was \"Are You There God? It's Me, Margaret.\" (1970), which was a breakthrough best-seller and a trailblazing novel in young adult literature and established Blume as a leading voice in young adult literature. Some of Blume's other novels during the decade include \"Tales of a Fourth Grade Nothing\" (1972), \"Otherwise Known as Sheila the Great\" (1972), and \"Blubber\" (1974).\nIn 1975, Blume published the now frequently banned novel \"Forever\", which was groundbreaking in young adult literature as the first novel to display teen sex as normal. Blume explained that she was inspired to write this novel when her daughter, 13 years old at the time, said she wanted to read a book where the characters have sex but do not die afterward. These novels tackled complex subjects such as family conflict, bullying, body image, and sexuality. Blume has expressed that she writes about these subjects, particularly sexuality, because it is what she believes children need to know about and was what she wondered about as a child.\nAfter publishing novels for young children and teens, Blume tackled another genre\u2014adult reality and death. Her novels \"Wifey\" (1978) and \"Smart Women\" (1983) reached the top of \"The New York Times\" Best Seller list. \"Wifey\" became a bestseller with over 4 million copies sold. Blume's third adult novel, \"Summer Sisters\" (1998), was widely praised and sold more than three million copies. Despite its popularity, \"Summer Sisters\" (1998) faced a lot of criticism for its sexual content and inclusion of homosexual themes. Several of Blume's books appear on the list of top all-time bestselling children's books. As of 2020, her books have sold over 82 million copies and they have been translated into 32 languages. Although Blume has not published a novel since 2015 (\"In the Unlikely Event\"), she continues to write. In October 2017, Yale University acquired Blume's archive, which included some unpublished early work.\nAs well as writing, Blume has been an activist against the banning of books in the United States. In the 1980s, when her books started facing censorship and controversy, she began reaching out to other writers, as well as teachers and librarians, to join the fight against censorship. This led Blume to join the National Coalition Against Censorship which aims to protect the freedom to read. As of 2020, Blume is still a board member for the National Coalition Against Censorship. She is also the founder and trustee of The Kids Fund, a charitable and educational foundation. Blume serves on the board for other organizations such as, the Authors Guild; the Society of Children's Book Writers and Illustrators; the Key West Literary Seminar; and the National Coalition Against Censorship.\" In 2018, Blume and her husband opened a non-profit book store called Books &amp; Books located in Key West.\nBlume calls herself a \"liberal Democrat.\"\nReception.\nBlume's novels have been read by millions and have flourished throughout generations. The element in her work readers are said to love most is Blume's openness and honesty regarding issues like divorce, sexuality, puberty, and bullying. Her first-person narrative writing has gained positive appraisal for its relatability and its ability to discuss difficult subjects without judgment or harshness. Following the publishing of \"Are You There God? It\u2019s Me, Margaret\" (1970), Blume received many letters from young girls telling her how much they loved the book and identified with Margaret. Female novelists have praised Blume for her \u201ctaboo-trampling\u201d literature that left readers feeling like they learned something about their bodies from reading her books. For example, \"Deenie\" (1973) explained masturbation and \"Forever\" (1975) taught young women about losing their virginity. Blume's children's books have also been praised for their delicate way of portraying the hardships that kids can face at a young age. \"It\u2019s Not the End of the World\" (1972) helped many kids understand divorce and the Fudge book series explored the various aspects of loving siblings despite the rivalry.\nBlume's novels have received much criticism and controversy. Parents, librarians, book critics, and political groups have wanted her books to be banned. When her first books were published in the 1970s, Blume has recalled facing little censorship. Since 1980, Blume's novels have been a central topic of controversy in young adult literature. Critics of Blume's novels say that she places too much emphasis on the physical and sexual sides of growing up, ignoring the development of morals and emotional maturity. Five of Blume's books were included in the American Library Association (ALA) list of the top 100 most banned books of the 1990s, with \"Forever\" (1975) in seventh place. \"Forever\" is censored for its inclusion of teen sex and birth control. Blume recalls that the principal of her children's elementary school would not put \"Are You There God? It\u2019s Me, Margaret\" in the library because the story involves menstruation. Conservative and religious groups continuously attempt to ban \"Are You There God? It\u2019s Me, Margaret\" for the novel's portrayal of a young girl going through puberty claiming that it violates certain religious views. Blume's children's novels have also been criticized for these reasons, especially \"Blubber\" (1974), which many believed sent the message to readers that kids could do wrong and not face punishment.\nAwards and honors.\nJudy Blume has won more than 90 literary awards, including three lifetime achievement awards in the United States. In 1994, she received the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement. The ALA Margaret A. Edwards Award recognizes one author who has made significant contributions to young adult literature. Blume won the annual award in 1996 and the ALA considered her book \"Forever,\" published in 1975, was groundbreaking for its honest portrayal of high school seniors in love for the first time. In April 2000, the Library of Congress named her to its \"Living Legends\" in the Writers and Artists category for her significant contributions to America's cultural heritage. Blume received an honorary doctor of arts degree from Mount Holyoke College and was the main speaker at their annual commencement ceremony in 2003. In 2004 she received the annual Distinguished Contribution to American Letters Medal of the National Book Foundation for her enrichment of American literary heritage. In 2009, the National Coalition Against Censorship (NCAC) honored Blume for her lifelong commitment to free speech and her courage to battle censorship in literature. Blume also received the 2017 E.B. White Award from the American Academy of Arts and Letters for lifetime achievement in children's literature. In 2020, Blume was named an Honoree for Distinguished Service to the Literary Community by the Authors Guild Foundation.\nMedia adaptations.\nThe first media adaptation of Blume's novels was the production of a TV film based on Blume's novel \"Forever\" that premiered on CBS in 1978. \"Forever\" is the story of two teenagers in high school, Katherine Danziger and Michael Wagner, who fall in love for the first time. The film starred Stephanie Zimbalist as Katherine Danziger and Dean Butler as Michael Wagner. A decade later, in 1988, Blume and her son wrote and executive produced a small film adaptation of \"Otherwise Known as Sheila the Great\". The film was later shown on ABC. In 1995, a Fudge TV series was produced based on Blume's novel \"Fudge-a-Mania.\" The show ran from 1995 to 1997 with the first season aired on ABC and the second on CBS. The series starred Jake Richardson as Peter Warren Hatcher, the storyteller, and Luke Tarsitano as Farley Drexel \"Fudge\" Hatcher.\nIn 2012, Blume's 1981 novel \"Tiger Eyes\" was adapted into a film version. This was the first of Blume's novels to be turned into a theatrical feature film. \"Tiger Eyes\" is the story of a teenage girl, Davey, who struggles to cope with the sudden death of her father, Adam Wexler. The screenplay was co-written by Blume and her son, Lawrence Blume, who was also the director. \"Tiger Eyes\" stars Willa Holland as Davey and Amy Jo Johnson as Gwen Wexler.\nBlume is the subject of the 2018 song \"Judy Blume\" by Amanda Palmer. Thematically, the song explains to the listener Blume's role in Palmer's adolescent life. The song explains Blume's books as influential in Palmer's understanding of intimate and female-centered subjects such as puberty, menstruation, and the male gaze, and universal subjects like molestation, eating disorders, poverty, grief, and parental divorce.\nShe is the subject of the Peabody Award-winning documentary \"Judy Blume Forever\", which premiered at the 2023 Sundance Film Festival.\n\"Are You There God? It's Me, Margaret.\" was released as a feature film in 2023.\nIn 2025 her novel \"Forever\" was adapted into a Netflix series show.\nOther awards.\nBlume's other awards include:\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He soon began to perform with notable music groups throughout the United States, notably playing the American premiere of Hans Werner Henze\u2019s \"Double Concerto\" with the National Symphony Orchestra at the Kennedy Center in Washington D.C. He has also appeared at several chamber music festivals, including the Spoleto Festival of the Two Worlds in Italy.\nMarangella has served as principal oboist for numerous ballet orchestras throughout his career. Former posts include Principal Oboe with the New York City Ballet, the American Ballet Theatre, the Bolshoi Ballet, the Royal Ballet, the Royal Swedish Ballet, and the Royal Danish Ballet.\nMore recently Marangella's career has been centered in Australia. He has appeared as a soloist for all the major Australian orchestras, and has been Guest Principal Oboe with the Sydney Symphony.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He won a scholarship to Trinity College, Cambridge, in 1943. He received his Bachelor of Arts degree in 1946. Between 1945 and 1947 he worked at the Bristol Aeroplane Company. He then returned to the University of Cambridge and was awarded his PhD in mathematics in 1951 on lone pair electrons.\nCareer.\nAfter obtaining his PhD, he was a research fellow at Trinity College, Cambridge and then from 1954 a lecturer in the mathematics faculty at Cambridge. In 1958, he moved to the National Physical Laboratory, near London as head of the new basics physics division. He moved to the United States of America in 1964, where he lived the rest of his life, though he retained British citizenship. Pople considered himself more of a mathematician than a chemist, but theoretical chemists consider him one of the most important of their number. In 1964 he moved to Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, where he had experienced a sabbatical in 1961 to 1962. In 1993 he moved to Northwestern University in Evanston, Illinois, where he was Trustees Professor of Chemistry until his death.\nResearch.\nPople's major scientific contributions were in four different areas:\nStatistical mechanics of water.\nPople's early paper on the statistical mechanics of water, according to Michael J. Frisch, \"remained the standard for many years\". This was his thesis topic for his PhD at Cambridge supervised by John Lennard-Jones.\nNuclear magnetic resonance.\nIn the early days of nuclear magnetic resonance he studied the underlying theory, and in 1959 he co-authored the textbook \"High Resolution Nuclear Magnetic Resonance\" with W.G. Schneider and H.J. Bernstein.\nSemi-empirical theory.\nHe made major contributions to the theory of approximate molecular orbital (MO) calculations, starting with one identical to the one developed by Rudolph Pariser and Robert G. Parr on pi electron systems, and now called the Pariser\u2013Parr\u2013Pople method. Subsequently, he developed the methods of Complete Neglect of Differential Overlap (CNDO) (in 1965) and Intermediate Neglect of Differential Overlap (INDO) for approximate MO calculations on three-dimensional molecules, and other developments in computational chemistry. In 1970 he and David Beveridge coauthored the book \"Approximate Molecular Orbital Theory\" describing these methods.\nAb initio electronic structure theory.\nPople pioneered the development of more sophisticated computational methods, called ab initio quantum chemistry methods, that use basis sets of either Slater type orbitals or Gaussian orbitals to model the wave function. While in the early days these calculations were extremely expensive to perform, the advent of high speed microprocessors has made them much more feasible today. He was instrumental in the development of one of the most widely used computational chemistry packages, the Gaussian suite of programs, including coauthorship of the first version, Gaussian 70. One of his most important original contributions is the concept of a model chemistry whereby a method is rigorously evaluated across a range of molecules. His research group developed the quantum chemistry composite methods such as Gaussian-1 (G1) and Gaussian-2 (G2). In 1991, Pople stopped working on Gaussian and several years later he developed (with others) the Q-Chem computational chemistry program. Prof. Pople's departure from Gaussian, along with the subsequent banning of many prominent scientists, including himself, from using the software gave rise to considerable controversy among the quantum chemistry community.\nThe Gaussian molecular orbital methods were described in the 1986 book \"Ab initio molecular orbital theory\" by Warren Hehre, Leo Radom, Paul v.R. Schleyer and Pople.\nAwards and honours.\nPople received the Wolf Prize in Chemistry in 1992, and the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1998. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS) in 1961. He was made a Knight Commander (KBE) of the Order of the British Empire in 2003. He was a founding member of the International Academy of Quantum Molecular Science.\nAn IT room and a scholarship are named after him at Bristol Grammar School, as is a supercomputer at the Pittsburgh Supercomputing Center.\nPersonal life.\nPople married Joy Bowers in 1952 and was married until her death from cancer in 2002. Pople died of liver cancer in Chicago in 2004. He was survived by his daughter Hilary, and sons Adrian, Mark and Andrew. In accordance with his wishes, Pople's Nobel Medal was given to Carnegie Mellon University by his family on 5 October 2009. He was a Christian.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "16504", "revid": "43320205", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=16504", "title": "Jerry Falwell", "text": "American Baptist pastor, televangelist, and conservative activist (1933\u20132007)\nJerry Laymon Falwell Sr. (August 11, 1933 \u2013 May 15, 2007) was an American Baptist pastor, televangelist, and conservative activist. He was the founding pastor of the Thomas Road Baptist Church, a megachurch in Lynchburg, Virginia. He founded Lynchburg Christian Academy, later renamed Liberty Christian Academy, in 1967, founded Liberty University in 1971, and co-founded the Moral Majority in 1979.\nEarly life and education.\nFalwell and his twin brother Gene were born in the Fairview Heights area of Lynchburg, Virginia, on August 11, 1933, the sons of Helen Virginia (\"n\u00e9e\" Beasley) and Carey Hezekiah Falwell. His father was an entrepreneur and one-time bootlegger who was agnostic. His father shot and killed his brother Garland and died of cirrhosis of the liver in 1948 at the age of 55. His paternal grandfather was a staunch atheist. Jerry Falwell was a member of a group in Fairview Heights known to the police as \"the Wall Gang\" because they sat on a low concrete wall at the Pickeral Caf\u00e9. Falwell met Macel Pate on his first visit to Park Avenue Baptist Church in 1949; Macel was a pianist there. They married on April 12, 1958. The couple had two sons, Jerry Jr. (a lawyer who succeeded Jerry Sr. as president of Liberty University until 2020) and Jonathan (who succeeded Jerry Sr. as senior pastor at Thomas Road Baptist Church, and became chancellor of Liberty University in 2023), and a daughter, Jeannie (a surgeon).\nFalwell and his wife had a close relationship, and she supported him throughout his career. The Falwells often appeared together in public, and did not shy away from showing physical affection. Of his marriage, Falwell jokingly said: \"Macel and I have never considered divorce. Murder maybe, but never divorce.\" Macel appreciated her husband's non-combative, affable nature, writing in her book that he \"hated confrontation and didn't want strife in our home... he did everything in his power to make me happy.\" The Falwells had been married for nearly 50 years when Jerry died.\nFalwell graduated from Brookville High School in Lynchburg, and from then-unaccredited Baptist Bible College in Springfield, Missouri, in 1956. He enrolled there to subvert Pate's relationship with her fianc\u00e9, who was a student there. Falwell was later awarded three honorary doctorates: Doctor of Divinity (1968) from Tennessee Temple Theological Seminary, Doctor of Letters from California Graduate School of Theology, and Doctor of Laws from Central University in Seoul, South Korea.\nAssociated organizations.\nThomas Road Baptist Church.\nIn 1956, aged 22, Falwell founded the Thomas Road Baptist Church. Originally at 701 Thomas Road in Lynchburg, with 35 members, it became a megachurch. Also in 1956, Falwell began \"The Old-Time Gospel Hour\", a nationally syndicated radio and television ministry. When Falwell died, his son Jonathan inherited his father's ministry, and took over as the church's senior pastor. The weekly program's name was then changed to \"Thomas Road Live\".\nLiberty Christian Academy.\nDuring the 1950s and 1960s, Falwell spoke and campaigned against the civil rights activist Martin Luther King Jr. and the racial desegregation of public school systems by the federal government. Liberty Christian Academy (LCA, founded as Lynchburg Christian Academy) is a Christian school in Lynchburg that the \"Lynchburg News\" in 1966 called \"a private school for white students\".\nFalwell opened The Lynchburg Christian Academy in 1967 as a segregation academy and a ministry of Thomas Road Baptist Church.\nThe Liberty Christian Academy is recognized as an educational facility by the Commonwealth of Virginia through the Virginia State Board of Education, Southern Association of Colleges and Schools, and the Association of Christian Schools International.\nLiberty University.\nIn 1971, Falwell co-founded Liberty University with Elmer L. Towns. Liberty University offers over 350 accredited programs of study, with approximately 16,000 students on-campus and 100,000 online.\nMoral Majority.\nDuring the 1980s, the Moral Majority became one of the largest political lobbies for evangelical Christians in the U.S. According to Falwell's autobiography, the Moral Majority was promoted as \"pro-life, pro-traditional family, pro-moral, and pro-American\" and was credited with delivering two-thirds of the white evangelical vote to Ronald Reagan in the 1980 presidential election. According to Jimmy Carter, \"that autumn [1980] a group headed by Jerry Falwell purchased $10 million in commercials on southern radio and TV to brand me as a traitor to the South and no longer a Christian.\" As head of the Moral Majority, Falwell consistently supported Republican candidates and conservative politics. This led Billy Graham to criticize him for \"sermonizing\" about political issues that lacked a moral element. At the time of Falwell's death, Graham said: \"We did not always agree on everything, but I knew him to be a man of God. His accomplishments went beyond most clergy of his generation.\"\nPTL.\nIn March 1987, Pentecostal televangelist Jim Bakker came under media scrutiny when it was revealed that he had a sexual encounter with, and allegedly raped, Jessica Hahn, and had paid for her silence. Bakker believed that fellow Pentecostal pastor Jimmy Swaggart was attempting to take over his ministry because he had initiated a church investigation into allegations of his sexual misconduct. To avoid the takeover, Bakker resigned on March 19 and appointed Falwell to succeed him as head of his PTL ministry, which included the PTL Satellite Network, television program \"The PTL Club\" and the Christian-themed amusement park Heritage USA.\nBakker believed Falwell would lead the ministry temporarily, until the scandal died down, but Falwell barred Bakker from returning to PTL on April 28, calling him \"probably the greatest scab and cancer on the face of Christianity in 2,000 years of church history\". Later that summer, as donations to the ministry declined in the wake of Bakker's scandal and resignation, Falwell raised $20 million to keep PTL solvent and delivered on a promise to ride the water slide at Heritage USA. Despite this, Falwell was unable to save the ministry from bankruptcy, and he resigned in October 1987.\nSocial and political views.\nFamilies.\nFalwell advocated beliefs and practices influenced by his version of biblical teachings.\nTithing.\nIn 1989, he told Liberty University employees that membership in his church and tithing were mandatory.\nVietnam War.\nFalwell felt the Vietnam War was being fought with \"limited political objectives\" when it should have been an all-out war against the North. In general, Falwell held that the president \"as a minister of God\" has the right to use arms to \"bring wrath upon those who would do evil.\"\nCivil rights.\nOn his evangelist program \"The Old-Time Gospel Hour\" in the mid-1960s, Falwell regularly featured segregationist politicians like governors Lester Maddox and George Wallace. Of Martin Luther King Jr., he said: \"I do question the sincerity and nonviolent intentions of some civil rights leaders such as Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., Mr. James Farmer, and others, who are known to have left-wing associations.\"\nOf \"Brown v. Board of Education\", he said in 1958:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;If Chief Justice Warren and his associates had known God's word and had desired to do the Lord's will, I am quite confident that the 1954 decision would never have been made. The facilities should be separate. When God has drawn a line of distinction, we should not attempt to cross that line.\nIn 1977, Falwell supported Anita Bryant's \"Save Our Children\" campaign to overturn an ordinance in Dade County, Florida, prohibiting discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation. He supported a similar movement in California.\nTwenty-eight years later, during a 2005 MSNBC television appearance, Falwell said he was not troubled by reports that the nominee for Chief Justice of the United States Supreme Court, John G. Roberts, had done volunteer legal work for gay rights activists in the case \"Romer v. Evans\". Falwell told then-MSNBC host Tucker Carlson that if he were a lawyer, he too would argue for civil rights for LGBT people. \"I may not agree with the lifestyle, but that has nothing to do with the civil rights of that part of our constituency\", said Falwell. When Carlson countered that conservatives \"are always arguing against 'special rights' for gays\", Falwell said equal access to housing and employment are basic rights, not special rights. \"Civil rights for all Americans, black, white, red, yellow, the rich, poor, young, old, gay, straight, et cetera, is not a liberal or conservative value. It's an American value that I would think that we pretty much all agree on.\"\nIsrael and Jews.\nFalwell's relationship with Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin was reported in the media in 1981. Falwell's staunch pro-Israel stance, sometimes called \"Christian Zionism\", drew the support of the Anti-Defamation League and its leader Abraham Foxman, but they condemned what they perceived as intolerance toward Muslims in Falwell's public statements. They also criticized him for saying that \"Jews can make more money accidentally than you can on purpose\". In his book \"Listen, America!\", Falwell called the Jewish people \"spiritually blind and desperately in need of their Messiah and Savior.\"\nIn the 1984 book \"Jerry Falwell and the Jews\", Falwell is quoted saying: &lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nEducation.\nFalwell repeatedly denounced certain teachings in public schools and secular education in general, calling them breeding grounds for atheism, secularism, and humanism, which he claimed to be in contradiction with Christian morality. He advocated that the U.S. change its public education system by implementing a school voucher system that would allow parents to send their children to either public or private schools. In his book \"America Can Be Saved\", he wrote: \"I hope I live to see the day when, as in the early days of our country, we won't have any public schools. The churches will have taken them over again and Christians will be running them.\"\nFalwell supported President George W. Bush's Faith Based Initiative, but had strong reservations about where the funding would go and the restrictions placed on churches: &lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;My problem is where it might go under his successors.\u00a0... I would not want to put any of the Jerry Falwell Ministries in a position where we might be subservient to a future Bill Clinton, God forbid.\u00a0... It also concerns me that once the pork barrel is filled, suddenly the Church of Scientology, the Jehovah Witnesses [\"sic\"], the various and many denominations and religious groups\u2014and I don't say those words in a pejorative way\u2014begin applying for money\u2014and I don't see how any can be turned down because of their radical and unpopular views. I don't know where that would take us.\nApartheid.\nIn the 1980s Falwell said sanctions against South Africa's apartheid regime would result in what, he felt, would be a worse situation, such as a Soviet-backed revolution. He also urged his followers to buy up gold Krugerrands and push U.S. \"reinvestment\" in South Africa. In 1985 he drew the ire of many when he called Nobel Peace Prize winner and Anglican Archbishop Desmond Tutu a phony \"as far as representing the black people of South Africa\".\n\"The Clinton Chronicles\".\nIn 1994, Falwell promoted and distributed the video documentary \"The Clinton Chronicles: An Investigation into the Alleged Criminal Activities of Bill Clinton\". The video purported to connect Bill Clinton to a murder conspiracy involving Vince Foster, James McDougall, Ron Brown, and a cocaine-smuggling operation. The theory was discredited, but the video sold more than 150,000 copies.\nThe film's production costs were partly met by \"Citizens for Honest Government\", to which Falwell paid $200,000 in 1994 and 1995. In 1995 Citizens for Honest Government interviewed Arkansas state troopers Roger Perry and Larry Patterson about the Foster murder conspiracy theory. Perry and Patterson also gave information about the allegations in the Paula Jones affair.\nThe infomercial for the 80-minute videotape included footage of Falwell interviewing a silhouetted journalist who claimed to be afraid for his life. The journalist accused Clinton of orchestrating the deaths of several reporters and personal confidants who had gotten too close to his supposed illegal activities. The silhouetted journalist was subsequently revealed to be Patrick Matrisciana, the producer of the video and president of Citizens for Honest Government. \"Obviously, I'm not an investigative reporter\", Matrisciana admitted to investigative journalist Murray Waas. Later, Falwell seemed to back away from personally trusting the video. In an interview for the 2005 documentary \"The Hunting of the President\", Falwell said, \"to this day I do not know the accuracy of the claims made in \"The Clinton Chronicles\".\"\nViews on homosexuality.\nFalwell condemned homosexuality as forbidden by the Bible. Homosexual rights groups called Falwell an \"agent of intolerance\" and \"the founder of the anti-gay industry\" for statements he had made and for campaigning against LGBT social movements. Falwell supported Anita Bryant's 1977 \"Save Our Children\" campaign to overturn a Florida ordinance prohibiting discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and a similar movement in California. In urging the ordinance's repeal, Falwell told one crowd, \"Gay folks would just as soon kill you as look at you.\" When the LGBT-friendly Metropolitan Community Church was almost accepted into the World Council of Churches, Falwell called them \"brute beasts\" and said they were \"part of a vile and satanic system\" that \"will be utterly annihilated, and there will be a celebration in heaven\". He later denied saying this. Falwell also regularly linked the AIDS epidemic to LGBT issues and said, \"AIDS is not just God's punishment for homosexuals, it is God's punishment for the society that tolerates homosexuals.\"\nAfter comedian and actress Ellen DeGeneres came out as a lesbian, Falwell referred to her in a sermon as \"Ellen DeGenerate\". DeGeneres responded, \"Really, he called me that? Ellen DeGenerate? I've been getting that since the fourth grade. I guess I'm happy I could give him work.\"\nFalwell's legacy regarding homosexuality is complicated by his support for LGBT civil rights and his attempts to reconcile with the LGBT community in later years. In October 1999, he hosted a meeting of 200 evangelicals with 200 gay people and lesbians at Thomas Road Baptist Church for an \"Anti-Violence Forum\", during which he acknowledged that some evangelicals' comments about homosexuality qualified as hate speech that could incite violence. At the forum, Falwell told homosexuals in attendance, \"I don't agree with your lifestyle, I will never agree with your lifestyle, but I love you\" and added, \"Anything that leaves the impression that we hate the sinner, we want to change that.\" He later told \"New York Times\" columnist Frank Rich that \"admittedly, evangelicals have not exhibited an ability to build a bond of friendship to the gay and lesbian community. We've said \"go somewhere else, we don't need you here [at] our churches.\"\"\n\"Teletubbies\".\nIn February 1999, a \"National Liberty Journal\" article (the media attributed it to Falwell) claimed that Tinky Winky, a Teletubby, was intended as a homosexual role model. The \"NLJ\" is a Liberty University publication. A 1998 \"Salon\" article had referred to Tinky Winky's status as a gay icon. In response, Steve Rice, spokesperson for Itsy Bitsy Entertainment, which licenses \"Teletubbies\", a U.K. show for preschool children, in the U.S., said, \"I really find it absurd and kind of offensive.\" The \"NLJ\" wrote, \"he is purple\u2014the gay pride color; and his antenna is shaped like a triangle\u2014the gay-pride symbol\". Tinky Winky also carries a magic bag, which the \"NLJ\" and \"Salon\" called a purse. Falwell added, \"role-modeling the gay lifestyle is damaging to the moral lives of children\".\nSeptember 11 attacks.\nAfter the September 11 attacks in 2001, Falwell said on Pat Robertson's \"The 700 Club\", \"I really believe that the pagans, and the abortionists, and the feminists, and the gays and the lesbians who are actively trying to make that an alternative lifestyle, the ACLU, People for the American Way, all of them who have tried to secularize America\u2014I point the finger in their face and say 'you helped this happen.'\"&lt;ref name=\"falwell 9/11\"&gt;https:// &lt;/ref&gt; In his opinion, LGBT organizations had angered God, thereby in part causing God to let the attacks happen. Falwell said the attacks were \"probably deserved\", a statement Christopher Hitchens called treasonous. After heavy criticism, Falwell said that no one but the terrorists were to blame and \"If I left that impression with gays or lesbians or anyone else, I apologize.\" Falwell was later the object of some of his followers' outrage for retracting his statements about divine judgment on the U.S. and its causes, because they had heard in his preaching for many years that the U.S. must repent of its lack of devotion to God, immoral living, and timid support of Israel if it wanted divine protection and blessing.\nLabor unions.\nFalwell said, \"Labor unions should study and read the Bible instead of asking for more money. When people get right with God, they are better workers.\"\nRelationship with American fundamentalism.\n In her extensive ethnographic study of Falwell, cultural anthropologist Susan Friend Harding noted that he adapted his preaching to win a broader, less extremist audience as he grew famous. This manifested itself in several ways. For example, though he was a teetotaler, Falwell no longer condemned \"worldly\" lifestyle choices such as dancing, drinking wine, and attending movie theaters; he softened his rhetoric predicting an apocalypse and God's vengeful wrath; and he shifted from a belief in outright biblical patriarchy to a complementarian view of appropriate gender roles. He also began to aim his strongest criticism at \"secular humanists\", pagans, and liberals rather than engaging in the racist, antisemitic, and anti-Catholic rhetoric common among Southern fundamentalist preachers but increasingly condemned as hate speech by the consensus of American society.\nIslam.\nFalwell opposed Islam. According to \"Asharq Al-Awsat\", a pan-Arab newspaper, he called Islam \"satanic\". In a televised interview with \"60 Minutes\", Falwell called Muhammad a \"terrorist\", adding, \"I concluded from reading Muslim and non-Muslim writers that Muhammad was a violent man, a man of war.\" Falwell later apologized to Muslims for what he had said about Muhammad and affirmed that he did not intend to offend \"honest and peace-loving\" Muslims, but he refused to remove his comments about Islam from his website. In response, Egyptian Christian intellectuals signed a statement condemning what Falwell had said about Muhammad being a terrorist.\nLegal issues.\nBeginning in the 1970s, Falwell was involved in legal matters that occupied much of his time and increased his name recognition.\nSEC and bonds.\nIn 1972, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) launched an investigation of bonds issued by Falwell's organizations. The SEC charged Falwell's church with \"fraud and deceit\" in the issuance of $6.5 million in unsecured church bonds. The church won a 1973 federal court case prosecuted at the SEC's behest. The court exonerated the church and ruled that while technical violations of law did occur, there was no proof the church intended any wrongdoing.\nFalwell versus \"Penthouse\".\nFalwell filed a $10 million lawsuit against \"Penthouse\" for publishing an article based on interviews he gave to freelance reporters, after failing to convince a federal court to enjoin the article's publication. The suit was dismissed in federal district court in 1981 on the grounds that the article was not defamatory or an invasion of Falwell's privacy (the Virginia courts had not recognized this privacy tort, which is recognized in other states).\n\"Hustler Magazine v. Falwell\".\nIn 1983, Larry Flynt's pornographic magazine \"Hustler\" ran a parody of a Campari ad featuring a mock \"interview\" with Falwell in which he admits that his \"first time\" was incest with his mother in an outhouse while drunk. Falwell sued for $45 million, alleging invasion of privacy, libel, and intentional infliction of emotional distress. A jury rejected the invasion of privacy and libel claims, holding that the parody could not have reasonably been taken to describe true events, but ruled in Falwell's favor on the emotional distress claim and awarded damages of $200,000. This was upheld on appeal. Flynt then appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court, which unanimously held that the First Amendment prevents public figures from recovering damages for emotional distress caused by parodies.\nAfter Falwell's death, Flynt said of Falwell:\nMy mother always told me that no matter how much you dislike a person, when you meet them face to face you will find characteristics about them that you like. Jerry Falwell was a perfect example of that. I hated everything he stood for, but after meeting him in person, years after the trial, Jerry Falwell and I became good friends. He would visit me in California and we would debate together on college campuses. I always appreciated his sincerity even though I knew what he was selling and he knew what I was selling.\nFalwell versus Jerry Sloan.\nIn 1984, Falwell was ordered to pay gay rights activist and former Baptist Bible College classmate Jerry Sloan $5,000 after losing a court battle. In July 1984 during a televised debate in Sacramento, California, Falwell denied calling the gay-friendly Metropolitan Community Churches \"brute beasts\" and \"a vile and Satanic system\" that will \"one day be utterly annihilated and there will be a celebration in heaven\".\nWhen Sloan insisted he had a tape, Falwell promised $5,000 if he could produce it. Sloan did, Falwell refused to pay, and Sloan successfully sued. The money was donated to build Sacramento's first LGBT community center, the Lambda Community Center, serving \"lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and intersex\" communities. Falwell appealed the decision, with his attorney charging that the Jewish judge in the case was prejudiced. He lost again and was made to pay an additional $2,875 in sanctions and court fees.\nTrademark infringement lawsuit against Christopher Lamparello.\nIn \"Lamparello v. Falwell\", a dispute over the ownership of the Internet domain \"fallwell.com\", the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit reversed an earlier District Court decision, arguing that Christopher Lamparello, who owned the domain, \"clearly created his website intending only to provide a forum to criticize ideas, not to steal customers.\" Lamparello's website described itself as not being connected to Jerry Falwell and is critical of Falwell's views on homosexuality. On April 17, 2006, the Supreme Court declined to hear an appeal of the Appeals Court's ruling that Lamparello's usage of the domain was legal.\nBefore that, a different man had turned over \"\" and \"jerryfallwell.com\" after Falwell threatened to sue for trademark infringement. Lawyers for Public Citizen Litigation Group's Internet Free Speech project represented the domain name owners in both cases.\nApocalyptic beliefs.\nOn July 31, 2006, CNN's \"Paula Zahn Now\" program featured a segment on \"whether the crisis in the Middle East is actually a prelude to the end of the world\". In an interview, Falwell said, \"I believe in the pre-millennial, pre-tribulational coming of Christ for all of his church, and to summarize that, your first poll, do you believe Jesus' coming the second time will be in the future, I would vote yes with the 59 percent and with Billy Graham and most evangelicals.\" Based on that and other statements, Falwell has been identified as a dispensationalist.\nIn 1999, Falwell said the Antichrist would probably arrive within a decade and \"of course he'll be Jewish\". After accusations of antisemitism, Falwell apologized and explained he was simply expressing the theological tenet that the Antichrist and Christ share many attributes.\nFailing health and death.\nIn early 2005, Falwell was hospitalized for two weeks with a viral infection, discharged, and re-hospitalized on May 30, 2005, in respiratory arrest. He was released from the hospital and returned to work. Later that year, a stent was implanted to correct a 70 percent blockage in his coronary arteries.\nAt about 10:45\u00a0a.m. on May 15, 2007, Falwell was found unconscious and without a pulse in his office after he missed a morning appointment, and was taken to Lynchburg General Hospital. \"I had breakfast with him, and he was fine at breakfast... He went to his office, I went to mine and they found him unresponsive\", said Ron Godwin, the executive vice president of Liberty University. His condition was initially reported as \"gravely serious\"; CPR was administered unsuccessfully. At 2:10\u00a0p.m., during a live press conference, a doctor from the hospital confirmed that Falwell had died of \"cardiac arrhythmia, or sudden cardiac death\". The hospital released a statement saying that he was pronounced dead at Lynchburg General Hospital at 12:40\u00a0p.m. He was 73. Falwell's wife and sons were at the hospital at the time of the pronouncement.\nFalwell's funeral took place on May 22, 2007, at Thomas Road Baptist Church after he had lain in repose both at the church and at Liberty University. Falwell's burial service was private. He is interred at a spot on the Liberty University campus near the Carter Glass Mansion and Falwell's office. B. R. Lakin, his mentor, is buried nearby. After Falwell's death, his sons succeeded him at the two positions he held, Jerry Falwell Jr. as president of Liberty University and Jonathan Falwell as the senior pastor of Thomas Road Baptist Church. Jerry Falwell Sr.'s daughter, Jeannie F. Savas, is a surgeon.\nThe last televised interview with Jerry Falwell Sr. was conducted by Christiane Amanpour for the CNN original series \"CNN Presents: God's Warriors\" on May 8, 2007, a week before his death; in the interview he said that he had asked God for at least 20 more years in order to accomplish his vision for the university he founded. Falwell's last televised sermon was his May 13, 2007, message on Mother's Day.\nLegacy.\nViews on Falwell's legacy are mixed. Supporters praise his advancement of his socially conservative message. They tout his evangelist ministries and his stress on church planting and growth. Conversely, many of his detractors have accused him of hate speech and identified him as an \"agent of intolerance\".\nThe antitheistic social commentator Christopher Hitchens called Falwell's work \"Chaucerian fraud\" and \"faith-based fraud\". Hitchens took special umbrage at Falwell's alignment with \"the most thuggish and demented Israeli settlers\" and his declaration that 9/11 represented God's judgment of America's sinful behavior, deeming it \"extraordinary that not even such a scandalous career is enough to shake our dumb addiction to the 'faith-based.'\" Hitchens also said that, despite his support for Israel, Falwell \"kept saying to his own crowd, yes, you have got to like the Jews, because they can make more money in 10 minutes than you can make in a lifetime\". Appearing on CNN the day after Falwell's death, Hitchens said, \"The empty life of this ugly little charlatan proves only one thing: that you can get away with the most extraordinary offenses to morality and to truth in this country if you will just get yourself called 'reverend'.\"\nAt one point, prank callers, especially home activists, were an estimated 25 percent of Falwell's total calls until the ministry disconnected the toll-free number in 1986. In the mid-1980s, Edward Johnson programmed his Atari home computer to make thousands of repeat phone calls to Falwell's toll-free number as a response to Falwell's having, Johnson felt, swindled large amounts of money from his followers, including Johnson's mother. Southern Bell forced Johnson to stop after he had run up Falwell's telephone bill by an estimated $500,000.\nJerry Falwell Jr. is a lawyer; he became president of Liberty University after his father's death and was put on indefinite leave from that position on August 7, 2020, after posting an inappropriate photo with a young woman on social media. He resigned on August 24 amid further questions about his and his wife's sexual and financial involvement with an associate. Falwell Jr. later said that the real reason his father began attending church as a teenager was that he had fallen in love with Macel, who played piano there and was engaged at the time, and that Falwell Sr. had used deception to convince her to break off the engagement.\nDirector Terrence Malick has an unproduced screenplay about the lives of Falwell and pianist-singer Jerry Lee Lewis.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\nFootnotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "16506", "revid": "31831", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=16506", "title": "Jay Leno", "text": "American television host and comedian (born 1950)\nJames Douglas Muir Leno ( ; born April 28, 1950) is an American television host, comedian, and writer. After doing stand-up comedy for years, Leno was chosen in 1992 to replace Johnny Carson as the host of NBC's \"The Tonight Show\"; Leno hosted \"The Tonight Show\" until September 2009 when Conan O'Brien took over as host and Leno started a primetime talk show, \"The Jay Leno Show\", which aired weeknights at 10:00\u00a0p.m. ET, also on NBC. O'Brien turned down NBC's offer to have Leno host a half hour monologue show before \"The Tonight Show\" to boost ratings amid reported viewership diminishing, which sparked the 2010 \"Tonight Show\" conflict that resulted in Leno's returning to hosting the show on March 1, 2010. He hosted his last episode of his second tenure on February 6, 2014. That year, he was inducted into the Television Hall of Fame. From 2014 to 2022, he hosted \"Jay Leno's Garage,\" and from 2021 to 2023, hosted the revival of \"You Bet Your Life\".\nLeno writes a regular column in \"Popular Mechanics\" showcasing his car collection and giving automotive advice. He also writes occasional \"Motormouth\" articles for \"The Sunday Times\".\nEarly life.\nLeno was born April 28, 1950, in New Rochelle, New York. His homemaker mother, Catherine (n\u00e9e\u00a0Muir; 1911\u20131993), was born in Greenock, Scotland, and came to the United States at age 11. His father, Angelo (1910\u20131994), was an insurance salesman born in New York to immigrants from Flumeri, Campania, Italy. Leno grew up in Andover, Massachusetts, and graduated from Andover High School. He obtained a bachelor's degree in speech therapy from Emerson College in Boston, where he started a comedy club in 1973. His older brother, Patrick (May 12, 1940 \u2013 October 6, 2002), was a Vietnam War veteran who became an attorney.\nCareer.\nEarly career.\nLeno made his first appearance on \"The Tonight Show\" on March 2, 1977, performing a comedy routine. During the 1970s, he had minor roles in several television series and films, first in the 1976 episode \"J.J. in Trouble\" of \"Good Times,\" and the same year in the pilot of \"Holmes &amp; Yo-Yo\". After an uncredited appearance in the 1977 film \"Fun with Dick and Jane\", he played more prominent roles in 1978 in \"American Hot Wax\" and \"Silver Bears\". His other appearances from that period include guest spots on the television shows \"One Day at a Time\", \"Alice\" and \"Laverne &amp; Shirley\". He had minor roles in the films \"Americathon\" (1979), and \"Polyester\" (1981). His only starring film role was the 1989 direct-to-video \"Collision Course\", with Pat Morita. He also appeared numerous times on \"Late Night with David Letterman\".\nHe also appeared on three weeks of the short-lived NBC game show \"Match Game-Hollywood Squares Hour\" in 1983 and 1984.\n\"The Tonight Show\".\nStarting in 1986, Leno was a regular substitute host for Johnny Carson on \"The Tonight Show\". In 1992, he replaced Carson as host amid controversy with David Letterman, who had been hosting \"Late Night with David Letterman\" since 1982 (which aired after \"The Tonight Show\"), and whom many\u2014including Carson himself\u2014expected to be Carson's successor. The story of this turbulent transition became the basis of a book and a movie. Leno continued to perform as a stand-up comedian throughout his \"Tonight Show\" tenure. In 1988, he received a contract extension with NBC itself. The July 1995 episode of \"The Tonight Show\" which featured an interview with Hugh Grant (who had been arrested for receiving oral sex in a public place from a prostitute) saw Leno rate higher than Letterman for the first time.\nIn 2004, Leno signed a contract extension with NBC to retain him as host of \"The Tonight Show\" until 2009. Later in 2004, Conan O'Brien signed a contract with NBC to become the show's host in 2009, replacing Leno at that time.\nDuring the 2007\u201308 Writers Guild of America strike, Leno was accused of violating WGA guidelines by writing his own monologue for \"The Tonight Show\". NBC and Leno claimed there were private meetings with the WGA where a secret agreement was reached allowing this; the WGA denied such meetings. Leno answered questions in front of the Writers Guild of America, West trial committee in February 2009 and June 2009, and when the WGAW published its list of strikebreakers on August 11, 2009, Leno was not on it.\nOn April 23, 2009, Leno checked himself in to a hospital with an undisclosed illness. He was released the following day and returned to work on Monday, April 27. The two subsequently canceled \"Tonight Show\" episodes for April 23 and 24 were his first in 17 years as host. The illness was not initially disclosed, but Leno later told \"People\" magazine that it was for exhaustion.\nMichael Jackson trial.\nDuring the 2005 trial of Michael Jackson over allegations of child molestation, Leno was one of a few celebrities who appeared as defense witnesses. In his testimony regarding a phone conversation with the accuser, Leno testified that he was not asked for any money and there did not appear to be any coaching \u2014 but the calls seemed unusual and scripted.\nAs a result, Leno was initially not allowed to tell jokes about Jackson or the case, which had been a fixture of \"The Tonight Show\"'s opening monologue in particular. But he and his show's writers used a legal loophole by having Leno briefly step aside while stand-in comedians took the stage and told jokes about the trial. These stand-ins included Roseanne Barr, Drew Carey, Brad Garrett and Dennis Miller. The gag order was challenged, and the court ruled that Leno could continue telling jokes about the trial as long as he did not discuss his testimony. Leno celebrated by devoting an entire monologue to Michael Jackson jokes.\nSuccession by Conan O'Brien; \"The Jay Leno Show\".\nBecause Leno's show continued to lead all late-night programming in the Nielsen ratings, the pending expiration of his contract led to speculation about whether he would become a late-night host for another network when his commitment to NBC expired. He left \"The Tonight Show\" on Friday, May 29, 2009, and Conan O'Brien took over on June 1, 2009.\nOn December 8, 2008, it was reported that Leno would remain on NBC and move to a new hour-long show at 10 p.m. Eastern Time (9 p.m. Central Time) five nights a week. It would follow a similar format to \"The Tonight Show\", be recorded in the same studio, and retain many of Leno's most popular segments, while O'Brien continued to host \"The\" \"Tonight Show\".\nLeno's new show, \"The Jay Leno Show\", debuted on September 14, 2009. It was announced at the Television Critics Association summer press tour that it would feature one or two celebrities, occasional musical guests, and keep the popular \"Headlines\" segments, which would be near the end of the show. First guests included Jerry Seinfeld, Oprah Winfrey (via satellite), and a short sit-down with Kanye West discussing his controversy at the 2009 MTV Video Music Awards, which had occurred the night before.\nTimeslot conflict and return to \"The Tonight Show\".\nIn their new roles, neither O'Brien nor Leno succeeded in delivering the viewing audiences the network anticipated. On January 7, 2010, multiple media outlets reported that beginning March 1, 2010, Leno would move from his 10 p.m. weeknight time slot to 11:35\u00a0p.m., due to a combination of pressure from local affiliates, whose newscasts were suffering, and both Leno's and O'Brien's poor ratings. Leno's show would be shortened from an hour to 30 minutes. All NBC late night programming would also be preempted by the 2010 Winter Olympics between February 15 and 26, moving \"The Tonight Show\" to 12:05\u00a0a.m., the first post-midnight timeslot in its history. O'Brien's contract stipulated that NBC could move the show ahead to 12:05\u00a0a.m. without penalty (a clause included primarily to accommodate sports preemptions).\nOn January 10, NBC confirmed that it would move Leno out of primetime as of February 12 and move him to late-night as soon as possible. TMZ reported that O'Brien was given no advance notice of this change, and that NBC offered him two choices: an hour-long 12:05\u00a0a.m. time slot, or the option to leave the network. On January 12, O'Brien issued a press release that he would not continue with \"Tonight\" if it moved to a 12:05\u00a0a.m. time slot, saying, \"I believe that delaying \"The Tonight Show\" into the next day to accommodate another comedy program will seriously damage what I consider to be the greatest franchise in the history of broadcasting. \"The Tonight Show\" at 12:05 simply isn't \"The Tonight Show.\"\"\nOn January 21, it was announced that NBC had struck a deal with O'Brien: He would leave \"The Tonight Show,\" receive a $33-million payout, and his staff of almost 200 would receive $12 million in the departure. His final episode aired on Friday, January 22, 2010. Leno returned as host of \"The Tonight Show\" following the 2010 Winter Olympics on March 1, 2010.\nOn July 1, 2010, \"Variety\" reported that total viewership for Leno's \"Tonight Show\" had dropped from 5 million to 4 million for the second quarter of 2010, compared to the same period in 2009. Although it represented the show's lowest second-quarter ratings since 1992, \"Tonight\" was still the most-watched late-night program, ahead of ABC's \"Nightline\" (3.7 million) and \"Late Show with David Letterman\" (3.3 million).\nAnnouncement of successor.\nOn April 3, 2013, NBC announced that Leno would leave \"The Tonight Show\" in spring 2014, with Jimmy Fallon as his designated successor.\nLeno's final show as the host of \"The Tonight Show\" was on February 6, 2014, with guests Billy Crystal (who was the first guest on the first version of Leno's show), musical guest Garth Brooks, and surprise guests Jack Black, Kim Kardashian, Jim Parsons, Sheryl Crow, Chris Paul, Carol Burnett and Oprah Winfrey.\nAfter \"The Tonight Show\".\nLeno has maintained an active schedule as a touring stand-up comedian, doing an average of 200 live performances a year in venues across the United States and Canada and at charity events and USO tours. He has also appeared on the \"Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon\" and \"Late Night with Seth Meyers,\" and was a guest on the finale of \"The Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson.\" He appeared in a cameo role drilling and tormenting James Corden in a facetious boot camp for talk-show hosts on the premiere of \"The Late Late Show with James Corden\". He declined an invitation to appear on \"Late Show with David Letterman\" despite speculation he would appear on the show's finale in 2015, although he had appeared with Letterman along with Winfrey in a \"Late Show\" commercial airing during Super Bowl XLIV in 2010.\nLeno hosted a one-hour \"Jay Leno's Garage\" special on CNBC in 2014, and the show returned as a primetime series on the cable channel from 2015 until 2022. The series was canceled in January 2023 after seven seasons due to a decision by the channel to re-emphasize business-oriented programming.\nLeno also had a recurring role in the Tim Allen comedy series \"Last Man Standing\" since season 5, playing a mechanic, Joe Leonard, in a store operated by Allen's character, Mike Baxter.\nLeno hosted the third revival of the game show \"You Bet Your Life\" for two seasons, from 2021 until 2023. The show was renewed for a third season but was cancelled in August 2023 after Leno refused to cross the picket line during the 2023 Writers Guild of America strike, after Fox First Run offered stations two other syndicated game shows to fill \"You Bet Your Life\"'s timeslot during the strike, instead of reruns.\nLeno also does voice acting, such as The Crimson Chin on \"The Fairly OddParents\" from 2001 to 2016 and Billy Beagle of \"Mickey and the Roadster Racers\".\nIn 2019, Leno was a guest judge on season 14 of \"America's Got Talent\" where he pressed the Golden Buzzer for opera singer Emanne Beasha.\nIn 2023, Leno returned to NBC to appear as a celebrity guest judge on the two-episode season finale of \"\".\nPublic image.\nCriticism.\nLeno has faced criticism for his perceived role in the 2010 \"Tonight Show\" conflict. Critics have cited a 2004 \"Tonight Show\" clip where Leno said he would allow O'Brien to take over without incident. At the time, Leno said he did not want O'Brien to leave for a competing network, adding, \"I'll be 59 when [the switch occurs]. That's five years from now. There's really only one person who could have done this into his 60s, and that was Johnny Carson; I think it's fair to say I'm no Johnny Carson.\" Leno also described \"The Tonight Show\" as a dynasty, saying, \"You hold it and hand it off to the next person. And I don't want to see all the fighting.\" At the end of the segment, he said, \"Conan, it's yours! See you in five years, buddy!\"\nJimmy Kimmel discussed his appearance on Leno's show during an interview with Marc Maron for the latter's podcast in 2012. Kimmel stated that he felt O'Brien was not given a proper chance, but that he was also motivated by his own history with Leno. According to Kimmel, Leno had some years prior been in serious discussions with ABC about the possibility of jumping ship from NBC. During this period, Leno initiated a friendship with Kimmel, wanting to ensure that they would be on good terms if the move was made. (Under that scenario, Leno would have taken Kimmel's time slot and become his lead-in.) However, after Leno made the arrangement to remain at NBC, \"those conversations were gone\", according to Kimmel. Realizing that Leno's relationship with him had been artificial, Kimmel felt \"worked over\", reasoning that Leno was using the ABC discussions as a bargaining tactic to try to get his old job back.\nLeno has also been criticized for the perceived change in the content of his monologues from his previous stand-up material. Actor and comedian Patton Oswalt was among the celebrities who openly voiced disappointment with Leno, saying, \"Comedians who don't like Jay Leno now, and I'm one of them, we're not like, 'Jay Leno sucks'; it's that we're so hurt and disappointed that one of the best comedians of our generation\u00a0... willfully has shut the switch off.\"\nIn August 2020, Leno faced criticism for expressing support for Ellen DeGeneres despite a workplace investigation into toxic behavior and sexual misconduct and harassment claims against producers of \"The Ellen DeGeneres Show\".\nSupport for Leno.\nNBC Sports chairman and former \"Saturday Night Live\" producer Dick Ebersol spoke out against all who had criticized Leno, calling them \"chicken-hearted and gutless\". Jeff Gaspin, then chairman of NBC Universal Television Entertainment, also defended Leno, saying, \"This has definitely crossed the line. Jay Leno is the consummate professional and one of the hardest-working people in television. It's a shame that he's being pulled into this.\" Fellow comedians Paul Reiser, Jerry Seinfeld and Jim Norton (a frequent contributor to \"The Tonight Show\") also voiced support for Leno.\nResponding to the mounting criticism, Leno said NBC had assured him that O'Brien was willing to accept the proposed arrangement and that they would not let either host out of his contract. He also said that the situation was \"all business\", and that all of the decisions were made by NBC. He appeared on the January 28, 2010 episode of \"The Oprah Winfrey Show\" in an attempt to repair some of the damage done to his public image.\nInfluences.\nLeno's comedic influences include Johnny Carson, Robert Klein, Alan King, David Brenner, Mort Sahl, George Carlin, Don Rickles, Bob Newhart, and Rodney Dangerfield.\nDennis Miller and Jerry Seinfeld have credited Leno as their inspiration.\nPersonal life.\nLeno has been married to Mavis Leno since 1980. In 1993, during his first season as host of \"The Tonight Show\", Leno's mother died at the age of 82; and the next year, his father died at 84. Leno's older brother, Patrick, a Vietnam veteran and graduate of Yale Law School, died of cancer in 2002 at the age of 62. In 2024, it was disclosed that Mavis Leno was suffering from an advanced form of dementia when the Los Angeles Superior Court granted Jay Leno conservatorship of the couple's joint estate as she experiences periods of disorientation and at times does not know who her husband is or her own date of birth.\nLeno is known for his prominent jaw, which has been described as mandibular prognathism. In the book \"Leading with My Chin\", he says he was aware of surgery that could reset his mandible, but that he did not wish to endure a prolonged healing period with his jaws wired shut.\nLeno is dyslexic. He claims to need only four or five hours of sleep each night. He does not consume alcohol, smoke, or gamble. He spends much of his free time visiting car collections and working in his private garage.\nLeno has claimed that he has not spent any of the money he earned from \"The Tonight Show,\" but lives off his money from his stand-up routines. He reportedly earned $32 million in 2005. In 2014, he received an Honorary Doctor of Humane Letters degree from Emerson College, where he also delivered the commencement speech. He also received an Honorary Doctorate of Humane Letters from Academy of Art University in 2021.\nOn November 12, 2022, Leno suffered \"serious burns\" to his face and hands when a vehicle at his Los Angeles garage burst into flames. As part of the treatment, he received a \"new ear\". On January 17, 2023, he sustained multiple broken bones after falling off a motorcycle. On November 16, 2024, Leno broke his right wrist, including tearing the fingernail off his right index finger, and sustained several bruises on his left side, acquiring a periorbital hematoma after he accidentally tripped while walking to go have dinner at Dino's Sports Lounge outside the Hampton Inn in Greensburg, Pennsylvania causing him to roll straight down a hill landing on the curb.\nCharity.\nIn 2001, he and his wife donated $100,000 to the Feminist Majority Foundation's campaign to stop gender apartheid in Afghanistan, to educate the public regarding the plight of women in Afghanistan under Taliban rule. Mavis Leno is on the board of the Feminist Majority.\nIn 2009, he donated $100,000 to a scholarship fund at Salem State College (later Salem State University) in honor of Lennie Sogoloff, who gave Leno his start at his jazz club, Lennie's-on-the-Turnpike.\nIn August 2012, Leno auctioned his Fiat 500, which was sold for $385,000 with all the proceeds going to a charity that helps wounded war veterans recover by providing them with temporary housing.\nAs of November\u00a02022[ [update]], Leno sponsored two scholarships at McPherson College.\nLove Ride.\nSince 1985, Leno has been the Grand Marshal for the Love Ride, a motorcycle charity event which since its founding in 1984 has raised nearly $14 million for charities benefiting muscular dystrophy research, Autism Speaks, and in 2001, the September 11 attacks recovery.\nVehicle collection.\n Leno owns an extensive collection of vehicles, including at least 181 cars and 160 motorcycles as of late 2024. He also has a website and a TV program called \"Jay Leno's Garage\", which contains video clips and photos of his car collection in detail, as well as other vehicles of interest to him. Leno's garage manager is Bernard Juchli. Among his collection are two Doble steam cars, a sedan and a roadster that were owned by Howard Hughes, the fifth Duesenberg Model X known to survive, and one of nine remaining 1963 Chrysler Turbine Cars. The collection also includes three antique electric cars \u2014 the 1909 Baker Motor Vehicle is his wife Mavis's favorite car. The collection includes at least two tanks. The most expensive car in the collection is a 1994 McLaren F1 sports car, the first McLaren to be imported to the US, which Leno says he purchased for approximately $800 thousand in the late 1990s, and is worth at least $20 million today. The value of the entire collection is at least $52 million.\nHe has a regular column in \"Popular Mechanics\" which showcases his car collection and gives advice about various automotive topics, including restoration and unique models, such as his jet-powered motorcycle and solar-powered hybrid. Leno also writes occasional \"Motormouth\" articles for \"The Sunday Times\", reviewing high-end sports cars and giving his humorous take on motoring matters.\nLeno opened his garage to Team Bondi, the company that developed the 2011 video game \"L.A. Noire\", which is set in Los Angeles in the late-1940s. Leno's collection contains almost 100 cars from this period, and allowed the team to create their images as accurately as possible.\nPolitics.\nHosting the 2014 Genesis Prize award ceremony in Jerusalem, Leno made jokes mocking then-President Barack Obama and then-Secretary of State John Kerry, accusing Obama of \"trying to break\" the U.S.'s relationship with Israel.\nIn a 2015 interview with \"The Jerusalem Post\", Leno said, \"I always considered Israel as not only the only democracy in the Middle East, I think it's the purest, because every Israeli voter seems to have his own political party.\" He also added about Israel's relations with other Middle Eastern countries: \"Israel is so efficient in defending itself and so good at it, that to the rest of the world it looks like bullying.\"\nIn a 2024 interview on \"Piers Morgan Uncensored\", Leno said that he is \"not a fan\" of then-former President Donald Trump. Of President Joe Biden, Leno said: \"I like him. I think he's a good guy. And, you know, the economy's doing pretty good!\"\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
