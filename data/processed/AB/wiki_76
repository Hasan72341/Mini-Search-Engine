He was born in Switzerland to French-speaking Swiss parents, and acquired French nationality by naturalization in 1930. His career spanned five decades, in which he designed buildings in Europe, Japan, India, as well as North and South America. He considered that \"the roots of modern architecture are to be found in Viollet-le-Duc.\"\nDedicated to providing better living conditions for the residents of crowded cities, Le Corbusier was influential in urban planning, and was a founding member of the (CIAM). Le Corbusier prepared the master plan for the city of Chandigarh in India, and contributed specific designs for several buildings there, especially the government buildings. In 2016, seventeen projects by Le Corbusier in seven countries were inscribed in the list of UNESCO World Heritage Sites as The Architectural Work of Le Corbusier, an Outstanding Contribution to the Modern Movement.\nLe Corbusier remains a controversial figure. Some of his urban planning ideas have been criticized for their indifference to pre-existing cultural sites, societal expression and equality, and his alleged ties with fascism, antisemitism, eugenics, and the dictator Benito Mussolini have resulted in some continuing contention. Le Corbusier also designed well-known furniture such as the LC4 chaise longue and the LC1 chair, both made of leather with metal framing.\nEarly life (1887\u20131904).\nCharles-\u00c9douard Jeanneret was born on 6 October 1887 in La Chaux-de-Fonds, a city in the Neuch\u00e2tel canton in the Romandie region of Switzerland. His ancestors included Belgians with the surname \"Lecorb\u00e9sier\", which inspired the pseudonym \"Le Corbusier\" which he would adopt as an adult. His father was an artisan who enameled boxes and watches, and his mother taught piano. His elder brother Albert was an amateur violinist. He attended a kindergarten that used Fr\u00f6belian methods.\nLocated in the Jura Mountains across the border from France, La Chaux-de-Fonds was a burgeoning city at the heart of the Watch Valley. Its culture was influenced by the Loge L'Amiti\u00e9, a Masonic lodge upholding moral, social, and philosophical ideas symbolized by the right angle (rectitude) and the compass (exactitude). Le Corbusier would later describe these as \"my guide, my choice\" and as \"time-honored ideas, ingrained and deep-rooted in the intellect, like entries from a catechism.\"\nLike his contemporaries Frank Lloyd Wright and Mies van der Rohe, Le Corbusier lacked formal training as an architect. He was attracted to the visual arts; at the age of fifteen, he entered the municipal art school in La-Chaux-de-Fonds which taught the applied arts connected with watchmaking. Three years later he attended the higher course of decoration, founded by the painter Charles L'Eplattenier, who had studied in Budapest and Paris. Le Corbusier wrote later that L'Eplattenier had made him \"a man of the woods\" and taught him about painting from nature. His father frequently took him into the mountains around the town. He wrote later, \"we were constantly on mountaintops; we grew accustomed to a vast horizon.\" He reported later that it was L'Eplattenier who made him choose architecture. \"I had a horror of architecture and architects,\" he wrote. \"...I was sixteen, I accepted the verdict and I obeyed. I moved into architecture.\" His architecture teacher was architect Ren\u00e9 Chapallaz, who had a large influence on Le Corbusier's earliest house designs.\nTravel and first houses (1905\u20131914).\nLe Corbusier began teaching himself by going to the library to read about architecture and philosophy, visiting museums, sketching buildings, and constructing them. In 1905, he and two other students, under the supervision of their teacher, Ren\u00e9 Chapallaz, designed and built his first house, the Villa Fallet, for the engraver Louis Fallet, a friend of his teacher Charles L'Eplattenier. Located on the forested hillside near Chaux-de-Fonds, it was a large chalet with a steep roof in the local alpine style and carefully crafted colored geometric patterns on the fa\u00e7ade. The success of this house led to his construction of two similar houses, the Villas Jacquemet and Stotzer, in the same area.\nIn September 1907, he made his first trip outside of Switzerland, going to Italy; he then spent the winter traveling through Budapest to Vienna, where he stayed for four months and met Gustav Klimt and tried, without success, to meet Josef Hoffmann. In Florence, he visited the Florence Charterhouse in Galluzzo, which made a lifelong impression on him. \"I would have liked to live in one of what they called their cells,\" he wrote later. \"It was the solution for a unique kind of worker's housing, or rather for a terrestrial paradise.\" He travelled to Paris, and for 14 months between 1908 and 1910 he worked as a draftsman in the office of the architect Auguste Perret, the pioneer of the use of reinforced concrete in residential construction and the architectural designer of the Art Deco landmark Th\u00e9\u00e2tre des Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es. Two years later, between October 1910 and March 1911 he traveled to Germany and worked for four months in the office of Peter Behrens, where Mies van der Rohe and Walter Gropius were also working and learning.\nIn 1911, he traveled again with his friend August Klipstein for five months; this time he journeyed to the Balkans and visited Serbia, Bulgaria, Turkey, and Greece, as well as Pompeii and Rome, filling nearly 80 sketchbooks with renderings of what he saw\u2014including many sketches of the Parthenon, whose forms he would later praise in his work \"Vers une architecture\" (1923). He spoke of what he saw during this trip in many of his books, and it was the subject of his last book, \"Le Voyage d'Orient\".\nIn 1912, he began his most ambitious project yet: a new house for his parents, also located on the forested hillside near La-Chaux-de-Fonds. The Jeanneret-Perret house was larger than the others, and in a more innovative style; the horizontal planes contrasted dramatically with the steep alpine slopes, and the white walls and lack of decoration were in sharp contrast with the other buildings on the hillside. The interior spaces were organized around the four pillars of the salon in the centre, foretelling the open interiors he would create in his later buildings. The project was more expensive to build than he imagined; his parents were forced to move from the house within ten years and relocate to a more modest house. However, it led to a commission to build an even more imposing villa in the nearby village of Le Locle for a wealthy watch manufacturer, Georges Favre-Jacot. Le Corbusier designed the new house in less than a month. The building was carefully designed to fit its hillside site, and the interior plan was spacious and designed around a courtyard for maximum light, a significant departure from the traditional house.\nDom-Ino House and Schwob House (1914\u20131918).\nDuring World War I, Le Corbusier taught at his old school in La-Chaux-de-Fonds. He concentrated on theoretical architectural studies using modern techniques. In December 1914, along with the engineer Max Dubois, he began a serious study of the use of reinforced concrete as a building material. He had first discovered concrete working in the office of Auguste Perret, the pioneer of reinforced concrete architecture in Paris, but now wanted to use it in new ways.\n\"Reinforced concrete provided me with incredible resources,\" he wrote later, \"and variety, and a passionate plasticity in which by themselves my structures will be the rhythm of a palace, and a Pompieen tranquillity.\" This led him to his plan for the Dom-Ino House (1914\u201315). This model proposed an open floor plan consisting of three concrete slabs supported by six thin reinforced concrete columns, with a stairway providing access to each level on one side of the floor plan. The system was originally designed to provide large numbers of temporary residences after World War I, producing only slabs, columns and stairways, and residents could build exterior walls with the materials around the site. He described it in his patent application as \"a juxtiposable system of construction according to an infinite number of combinations of plans.\u201d This would permit, he wrote, \"the construction of the dividing walls at any point on the fa\u00e7ade or the interior.\"\nUnder this system, the structure of the house did not have to appear on the outside but could be hidden behind a glass wall, and the interior could be arranged in any way the architect liked. After it was patented, Le Corbusier designed several houses according to the system, which were all white concrete boxes. Although some of these were never built, they illustrated the basic architectural ideas which would dominate his works throughout the 1920s. He refined the idea in his 1927 book on the \"Five Points of a New Architecture\". This design, which called for the disassociation of the structure from the walls, and the freedom of plans and fa\u00e7ades, became the foundation for most of his architecture over the next ten years.\nIn August 1916, Le Corbusier received his largest commission ever, to construct a villa for the Swiss watchmaker Anatole Schwob, for whom he had already completed several small remodelling projects. He was given a large budget and the freedom to design not only the house but also to create the interior decoration and choose the furniture. Following the precepts of Auguste Perret, he built the structure out of reinforced concrete and filled the gaps with brick. The centre of the house is a large concrete box with two semicolumn structures on both sides, which reflects his ideas of pure geometrical forms. A large open hall with a chandelier occupied the centre of the building. \"You can see,\" he wrote to Auguste Perret in July 1916, \"that Auguste Perret left more in me than Peter Behrens.\"\nLe Corbusier's grand ambitions collided with the ideas and budget of his client and led to bitter conflicts. Schwob went to court and denied Le Corbusier access to the site, or the right to claim to be the architect. Le Corbusier responded, \"Whether you like it or not, my presence is inscribed in every corner of your house.\" Le Corbusier took great pride in the house and reproduced pictures in several of his books.\nPainting, Cubism, Purism and \"L'Esprit Nouveau\" (1918\u20131922).\nLe Corbusier moved to Paris definitively in 1917 and began his architectural practice with his cousin, Pierre Jeanneret (1896\u20131967), a partnership that would last until the 1950s, with an interruption in the World War II years.\nIn 1918, Le Corbusier met the Cubist painter Am\u00e9d\u00e9e Ozenfant, in whom he recognised a kindred spirit. Ozenfant encouraged him to paint, and the two began a period of collaboration. Rejecting Cubism as irrational and \"romantic\", the pair jointly published their manifesto, \"Apr\u00e8s le Cubisme\" and established a new artistic movement, Purism. Ozenfant and Le Corbusier began writing for a new journal, \"L'Esprit Nouveau\", and promoted with energy and imagination his ideas of architecture.\nIn the first issue of the journal, in 1920, Charles-Edouard Jeanneret adopted Le Corbusier (an altered form of his maternal grandfather's name, Lecorb\u00e9sier) as a pseudonym, reflecting his belief that anyone could reinvent themselves. Adopting a single name to identify oneself was in vogue by artists in many fields during that era, especially in Paris.\nBetween 1918 and 1922, Le Corbusier did not build anything, concentrating his efforts on Purist theory and painting. In 1922, he and his cousin Pierre Jeanneret, a fellow architect and furniture designer, opened a studio in Paris at 35 rue de S\u00e8vres.\nThey set up an architectural practice together. From 1927 to 1937 they worked together with Charlotte Perriand at the Le Corbusier-Pierre Jeanneret studio. In 1929 the trio prepared the \"House fittings\" section for the Decorative Artists Exhibition and asked for a group stand, renewing and widening the 1928 avant-garde group idea. This was refused by the Decorative Artists Committee. They resigned and founded the Union of Modern Artists (\"Union des artistes modernes\": UAM).\nHis theoretical studies soon advanced into several different single-family house models. Among these, was the Maison \"Citrohan.\" The project's name was a reference to the French Citro\u00ebn automaker, for the modern industrial methods and materials, Le Corbusier advocated using in the house's construction as well as how he intended the homes would be consumed, similar to other commercial products, like the automobile.\nAs part of the Maison Citrohan model, Le Corbusier proposed a three-floor structure, with a double-height living room, bedrooms on the second floor, and a kitchen on the third floor. The roof would be occupied by a sun terrace. On the exterior, Le Corbusier installed a stairway to provide second-floor access from the ground level. Here, as in other projects from this period, he also designed the fa\u00e7ades to include large uninterrupted banks of windows. The house used a rectangular plan, with exterior walls that were not filled by windows but left as white, stuccoed spaces. Le Corbusier and Jeanneret left the interior aesthetically spare, with any movable furniture made of tubular metal frames. Light fixtures usually comprised single, bare bulbs. Interior walls also were left white.\n\"Toward an Architecture\" (1920\u20131923).\nIn 1922 and 1923, Le Corbusier devoted himself to advocating his new concepts of architecture and urban planning in a series of polemical articles published in \"L'Esprit Nouveau\". At the Paris Salon d'Automne in 1922, he presented his plan for the Ville Contemporaine, a model city for three million people, whose residents would live and work in a group of identical sixty-story tall apartment buildings surrounded by lower zig-zag apartment blocks and a large park. In 1923, he collected his essays from \"L'Esprit Nouveau\" published his first and most influential book, \"Towards an Architecture\". He presented his ideas for the future of architecture in a series of maxims, declarations, and exhortations, pronouncing that \"a grand epoch has just begun. There exists a new spirit. There already exist a crowd of works in the new spirit, they are found especially in industrial production. Architecture is suffocating in its current uses. \"Styles\" are a lie. Style is a unity of principles which animates all the work of a period and which result in a characteristic spirit...Our epoch determines each day its style..-Our eyes, unfortunately, don't know how to see it yet,\" and his most famous maxim, \"A house is a machine to live in.\" Most of the many photographs and drawings in the book came from outside the world of traditional architecture; the cover showed the promenade deck of an ocean liner, while others showed racing cars, aeroplanes, factories, and the huge concrete and steel arches of zeppelin hangars.\nL'Esprit Nouveau Pavilion (1925).\nAn important early work of Le Corbusier was the Esprit Nouveau Pavilion, built for the 1925 Paris International Exhibition of Modern Decorative and Industrial Arts, the event which later gave Art Deco its name. Le Corbusier built the pavilion in collaboration with Am\u00e9d\u00e9e Ozenfant and with his cousin Pierre Jeanneret. Le Corbusier and Ozenfant had broken with Cubism and formed the Purism movement in 1918 and in 1920 founded their journal \"L'Esprit Nouveau\". In his new journal, Le Corbusier vividly denounced the decorative arts: \"Decorative Art, as opposed to the machine phenomenon, is the final twitch of the old manual modes, a dying thing.\" To illustrate his ideas, he and Ozenfant decided to create a small pavilion at the Exposition, representing his idea of the future urban housing unit. A house, he wrote, \"is a cell within the body of a city. The cell is made up of the vital elements which are the mechanics of a house... Decorative art is antistandardizational. Our pavilion will contain only standard things created by industry in factories and mass-produced, objects truly of the style of today... My pavilion will therefore be a cell extracted from a huge apartment building.\"\nLe Corbusier and his collaborators were given a plot of land located behind the Grand Palais in the centre of the Exposition. The plot was forested, and exhibitors could not cut down trees, so Le Corbusier built his pavilion with a tree in the centre, emerging through a hole in the roof. The building was a stark white box with an interior terrace and square glass windows. The interior was decorated with a few cubist paintings and a few pieces of mass-produced commercially available furniture, entirely different from the expensive one-of-a-kind pieces in the other pavilions. The chief organizers of the Exposition were furious and built a fence to partially hide the pavilion. Le Corbusier had to appeal to the Ministry of Fine Arts, which ordered that fence be taken down.\nBesides the furniture, the pavilion exhibited a model of his Plan Voisin, his provocative plan for rebuilding a large part of the centre of Paris. He proposed to bulldoze a large area north of the Seine and replace the narrow streets, monuments and houses with giant sixty-story cruciform towers placed within an orthogonal street grid and park-like green space. His scheme was met with criticism and scorn from French politicians and industrialists, although they were favourable to the ideas of Taylorism and Fordism underlying his designs. The plan was never seriously considered, but it provoked discussion concerning how to deal with the overcrowded poor working-class neighbourhoods of Paris, and it later saw the partial realization in the housing developments built in the Paris suburbs in the 1950s and 1960s.\nThe Pavilion was ridiculed by many critics, but Le Corbusier, undaunted, wrote: \"Right now one thing is sure. 1925 marks the decisive turning point in the quarrel between the old and new. After 1925, the antique-lovers will have virtually ended their lives . . . Progress is achieved through experimentation; the decision will be awarded on the field of battle of the 'new'.\"\n\"The Decorative Art of Today\" (1925).\nIn 1925, Le Corbusier combined a series of articles about decorative art from \"L'Esprit Nouveau\" into a book, \"L'art d\u00e9coratif d'aujourd'hui\" (\"The Decorative Art of Today\"). The book was a spirited attack on the very idea of decorative art. His basic premise, repeated throughout the book, was: \"Modern decorative art has no decoration.\" He attacked with enthusiasm the styles presented at the 1925 Exposition of Decorative Arts: \"The desire to decorate everything about one is a false spirit and an abominable small perversion... The religion of beautiful materials is in its final death agony... The almost hysterical onrush in recent years toward this quasi-orgy of decor is only the last spasm of a death already predictable.\" He cited the 1912 book of the Austrian architect Adolf Loos, \"Ornament and Crime\", and quoted Loos's dictum, \"The more a people are cultivated, the more decor disappears.\" He attacked the deco revival of classical styles, what he called \"Louis Philippe and Louis XVI moderne\"; he condemned the \"symphony of color\" at the Exposition, and called it \"the triumph of assemblers of colors and materials. They were swaggering in colors... They were making stews out of fine cuisine.\" He condemned the exotic styles presented at the Exposition based on the art of China, Japan, India and Persia. \"It takes energy today to affirm our western styles.\" He criticized the \"precious and useless objects that accumulated on the shelves\" in the new style. He attacked the \"rustling silks, the marbles which twist and turn, the vermilion whiplashes, the silver blades of Byzantium and the Orient...Let's be done with it!\"\n\"Why call bottles, chairs, baskets and objects decorative?\" Le Corbusier asked. \"They are useful tools...The decor is not necessary. Art is necessary.\" He declared that in the future the decorative arts industry would produce only \"objects which are perfectly useful, convenient, and have a true luxury which pleases our spirit by their elegance and the purity of their execution and the efficiency of their services. This rational perfection and precise determinate creates the link sufficient to recognize a style.\" He described the future of decoration in these terms: \"The idea is to go work in the superb office of a modern factory, rectangular and well-lit, painted in white Ripolin (a major French paint manufacturer); where healthy activity and laborious optimism reign.\" He concluded by repeating \"Modern decoration has no decoration\".\nThe book became a manifesto for those who opposed the more traditional styles of the decorative arts; In the 1930s, as Le Corbusier predicted, the modernized versions of Louis Philippe and Louis XVI furniture and the brightly coloured wallpapers of stylized roses were replaced by a more sober, more streamlined style. Gradually the modernism and functionality proposed by Le Corbusier overtook the more ornamental style. The shorthand titles that Le Corbusier used in the book, \"1925 Expo: Arts Deco\" were adapted in 1966 by the art historian Bevis Hillier for a catalogue of an exhibition on the style, and in 1968 in the title of a book, \"Art Deco of the 20s and 30s\". And thereafter the term \"Art Deco\" was commonly used as the name of the style.\nFive Points of Architecture to Villa Savoye (1923\u20131931).\nThe notoriety that Le Corbusier achieved from his writings and the Pavilion at the 1925 Exposition led to commissions to build a dozen residences in Paris and the Paris region in his \"purist style.\" These included the Maison La Roche/Albert Jeanneret (1923\u20131925), which now houses the Fondation Le Corbusier; the Maison Guiette in Antwerp, Belgium (1926); a residence for Jacques Lipchitz; the Maison Cook; and the Maison Planeix. In 1927, he was invited by the German Werkbund to build three houses in the model city of Weissenhof near Stuttgart, based on the Citrohan House and other theoretical models he had published. He described this project in detail in one of his best-known essays, the \"Five Points of Architecture\".\nThe following year he began the Villa Savoye (1928\u20131931), which became one of the most famous of Le Corbusier's works and an icon of modernist architecture. Located in Poissy, in a landscape surrounded by trees and a large lawn, the house is an elegant white box poised on rows of slender pylons, surrounded by a horizontal band of windows which fill the structure with light. The service areas (parking, rooms for servants and laundry room) are located under the house. Visitors enter a vestibule from which a gentle ramp leads to the house itself. The bedrooms and salons of the house are distributed around a suspended garden; the rooms look both out at the landscape and into the garden, which provides additional light and air. Another ramp leads up to the roof, and a stairway leads down to the cellar under the pillars.\nVilla Savoye succinctly summed up the five points of architecture that he had elucidated in \"L'Esprit Nouveau\" and the book \"Vers une architecture\", which he had been developing throughout the 1920s. First, Le Corbusier lifted the bulk of the structure off the ground, supporting it by \"pilotis\", reinforced concrete stilts. These \"pilotis\", in providing the structural support for the house, allowed him to elucidate his next two points: a free fa\u00e7ade, meaning non-supporting walls that could be designed as the architect wished, and an open floor plan, meaning that the floor space was free to be configured into rooms without concern for supporting walls. The second floor of the Villa Savoye includes long strips of ribbon windows that allow unencumbered views of the large surrounding garden, which constitute the fourth point of his system. The fifth point was the roof garden to compensate for the green area consumed by the building and replace it on the roof. A ramp rising from ground level to the third-floor roof terrace allows for a promenade architecturale through the structure. The white tubular railing recalls the industrial \"ocean-liner\" aesthetic that Le Corbusier much admired.\nLe Corbusier was quite rhapsodic when describing the house in \"Pr\u00e9cisions\" in 1930: \"the plan is pure, exactly made for the needs of the house. It has its correct place in the rustic landscape of Poissy. It is Poetry and lyricism, supported by technique.\" The house had its problems; the roof persistently leaked, due to construction faults; but it became a landmark of modern architecture and one of the best-known works of Le Corbusier.\nLeague of Nations Competition and Pessac Housing Project (1926\u20131930).\nThanks to his passionate articles in L'Esprit Nouveau, his participation in the 1925 Decorative Arts Exposition and the conferences he gave on the new spirit of architecture, Le Corbusier had become well known in the architectural world, though he had only built residences for wealthy clients. In 1926, he entered the competition for the construction of a headquarters for the League of Nations in Geneva with a plan for an innovative lakeside complex of modernist white concrete office buildings and meeting halls. There were 337 projects in competition. It appeared that the Corbusier's project was the first choice of the architectural jury, but after much behind-the-scenes manoeuvring, the jury declared it was unable to pick a single winner, and the project was given instead to the top five architects, who were all neoclassicists. Le Corbusier was not discouraged; he presented his plans to the public in articles and lectures to show the opportunity that the League of Nations had missed.\nThe \"Cit\u00e9 Frug\u00e8s\".\nIn 1926, Le Corbusier received the opportunity he had been looking for; he was commissioned by a Bordeaux industrialist, Henry Frug\u00e8s, a fervent admirer of his ideas on urban planning, to build a complex of worker housing, the Cit\u00e9 Frug\u00e8s, at Pessac, a suburb of Bordeaux. Le Corbusier described Pessac as \"A little like a Balzac novel\", a chance to create a whole community for living and working. The Fruges quarter became his first laboratory for residential housing; a series of rectangular blocks composed of modular housing units located in a garden setting. Like the unit displayed at the 1925 Exposition, each housing unit had its own small terrace. The earlier villas he constructed all had white exterior walls, but for Pessac, at the request of his clients, he added colour; panels of brown, yellow and jade green, coordinated by Le Corbusier. Originally planned to have some two hundred units, it finally contained about fifty to seventy housing units, in eight buildings. Pessac became the model on a small scale for his later and much larger Cit\u00e9 Radieuse projects.\nFounding of CIAM (1928) and Athens Charter.\nIn 1928, Le Corbusier took a major step toward establishing modernist architecture as the dominant European style. Le Corbusier had met with many of the leading German and Austrian modernists during the competition for the League of Nations in 1927. In the same year, the German Werkbund organized an architectural exposition at the Weissenhof Estate Stuttgart. Seventeen leading modernist architects in Europe were invited to design twenty-one houses; Le Corbusier and Mies van der Rohe played a major part. In 1927 Le Corbusier, Pierre Chareau and others proposed the foundation of an international conference to establish the basis for a common style. The first meeting of the \"Congr\u00e8s Internationaux d'Architecture Moderne\" or International Congresses of Modern Architects (CIAM), was held in a ch\u00e2teau on Lake Leman in Switzerland 26\u201328 June 1928. Those attending included Le Corbusier, Robert Mallet-Stevens, Auguste Perret, Pierre Chareau and Tony Garnier from France; Victor Bourgeois from Belgium; Walter Gropius, Erich Mendelsohn, Ernst May and Mies van der Rohe from Germany; Josef Frank from Austria; Mart Stam and Gerrit Rietveld from the Netherlands, and Adolf Loos from Czechoslovakia. A delegation of Soviet architects was invited to attend, but they were unable to obtain visas. Later members included Josep Llu\u00eds Sert of Spain and Alvar Aalto of Finland. No one attended from the United States. A second meeting was organized in 1930 in Brussels by Victor Bourgeois on the topic \"Rational methods for groups of habitations\". A third meeting, on \"The functional city\", was scheduled for Moscow in 1932, but was cancelled at the last minute. Instead, the delegates held their meeting on a cruise ship travelling between Marseille and Athens. On board, they together drafted a text on how modern cities should be organized. The text, called The Athens Charter, after considerable editing by Le Corbusier and others, was finally published in 1943 and became an influential text for city planners in the 1950s and 1960s. The group met once more in Paris in 1937 to discuss public housing and was scheduled to meet in the United States in 1939, but the meeting was cancelled because of the war. The legacy of the CIAM was a roughly common style and doctrine which helped define modern architecture in Europe and the United States after World War II.\nProjects (1928\u20131963).\nMoscow projects (1928\u20131934).\nLe Corbusier saw the new society founded in the Soviet Union after the Russian Revolution as a promising laboratory for his architectural ideas. He met the Russian architect Konstantin Melnikov during the 1925 Decorative Arts Exposition in Paris, and admired the construction of Melnikov's constructivist USSR pavilion, the only truly modernist building in the Exposition other than his own Esprit Nouveau pavilion. At Melnikov's invitation, he travelled to Moscow, where he found that his writings had been published in Russian; he gave lectures and interviews and between 1928 and 1932 he constructed an office building for the Tsentrosoyuz, the headquarters of Soviet trade unions.\nIn 1932, he was invited to take part in an international competition for the new Palace of the Soviets in Moscow, which was to be built on the site of the Cathedral of Christ the Saviour, demolished on Stalin's orders. Le Corbusier contributed a highly original plan, a low-level complex of circular and rectangular buildings and a rainbow-like arch from which the roof of the main meeting hall was suspended. To Le Corbusier's distress, his plan was rejected by Stalin in favour of a plan for a massive neoclassical tower, the highest in Europe, crowned with a statue of Vladimir Lenin. The Palace was never built; construction was stopped by World War II, a swimming pool took its place, and after the collapse of the USSR the cathedral was rebuilt on its original site.\nCit\u00e9 Universitaire, Immeuble Clart\u00e9 and Cit\u00e9 de Refuge (1928\u20131933).\nBetween 1928 and 1934, as Le Corbusier's reputation grew, he received commissions to construct a wide variety of buildings. In 1928 he received a commission from the Soviet government to construct the headquarters of the Tsentrosoyuz, or central office of trade unions, a large office building whose glass walls alternated with plaques of stone. He built the Villa de Madrot in Le Pradet (1929\u20131931); and an apartment in Paris for Charles de Bestigui at the top of an existing building on the Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es 1929\u20131932, (later demolished). In 1929\u20131930 he constructed a floating homeless shelter for the Salvation Army on the left bank of the Seine at the Pont d'Austerlitz. Between 1929 and 1933, he built a larger and more ambitious project for the Salvation Army, the Cit\u00e9 de Refuge, on rue Cantagrel in the 13th arrondissement of Paris. He also constructed the Swiss Pavilion in the Cit\u00e9 Universitaire in Paris with 46 units of student housing, (1929\u201333). He designed furniture to go with the building; the main salon was decorated with a montage of black-and-white photographs of nature. In 1948, he replaced this with a colourful mural he painted himself. In Geneva, he built a glass-walled apartment building with 45 units, the Immeuble Clart\u00e9. Between 1931 and 1945 he built an apartment building with fifteen units, including an apartment and studio for himself on the 6th and 7th floors, at 24 rue Nungesser-et-Coli in the 16th arrondissement in Paris. overlooking the Bois de Boulogne. His apartment and studio are owned today by the Fondation Le Corbusier and can be visited.\nVille Contemporaine, Plan Voisin and Cit\u00e9 Radieuse (1922\u20131939).\nAs the global Great Depression enveloped Europe, Le Corbusier devoted more and more time to his ideas for urban design and planned cities. He believed that his new, modern architectural forms would provide an organizational solution that would raise the quality of life for the working classes. In 1922 he had presented his model of the Ville Contemporaine, a city of three million inhabitants, at the Salon d'Automne in Paris. His plan featured tall office towers surrounded by lower residential blocks in a park setting. He reported that \"analysis leads to such dimensions, to such a new scale, and to such the creation of an urban organism so different from those that exist, that it that the mind can hardly imagine it.\" The Ville Contemporaine, presenting an imaginary city in an imaginary location, did not attract the attention that Le Corbusier wanted. For his next proposal, the Plan Voisin (1925), he took a much more provocative approach; he proposed to demolish a large part of central Paris and replace it with a group of sixty-story cruciform office towers surrounded by parkland. This idea shocked most viewers, as it was certainly intended to do. The plan included a multi-level transportation hub that included depots for buses and trains, as well as highway intersections, and an airport. Le Corbusier had the fanciful notion that commercial airliners would land between the huge skyscrapers. He segregated pedestrian circulation paths from the roadways and created an elaborate road network. Groups of lower-rise zigzag apartment blocks, set back from the street, were interspersed among the office towers. Le Corbusier wrote: \"The centre of Paris, currently threatened with death, threatened by exodus, is, in reality, a diamond mine...To abandon the centre of Paris to its fate is to desert in face of the enemy.\"\nAs no doubt Le Corbusier expected, no one hurried to implement the Plan Voisin, but he continued working on variations of the idea and recruiting followers. In 1929, he travelled to Brazil where he gave conferences on his architectural ideas. He returned with drawings of his vision for Rio de Janeiro; he sketched serpentine multi-story apartment buildings on pylons, like inhabited highways, winding through Rio de Janeiro.\nIn 1931, he developed a visionary plan for another city Algiers, then part of France. This plan, like his Rio Janeiro plan, called for the construction of an elevated viaduct of concrete, carrying residential units, which would run from one end of the city to the other. This plan, unlike his early Plan Voisin, was more conservative, because it did not call for the destruction of the old city of Algiers; the residential housing would be over the top of the old city. This plan, like his Paris plans, provoked discussion but never came close to realization.\nIn 1935, Le Corbusier made his first visit to the United States. He was asked by American journalists what he thought about New York City skyscrapers; he responded, characteristically, that he found them \"much too small\". He wrote a book describing his experiences in the States, \"Quand Les cath\u00e9drales \u00e9taient blanches, Voyage au pays des timides\" (When Cathedrals were White; voyage to the land of the timid) whose title expressed his view of the lack of boldness in American architecture.\nHe wrote a great deal but built very little in the late 1930s. The titles of his books expressed the combined urgency and optimism of his messages: \"Cannons? Munitions? No thank you, Lodging please!\" (1938) and \"The lyricism of modern times and urbanism\" (1939).\nIn 1928, the French Minister of Labour, Louis Loucheur, won the passage of French law on public housing, calling for the construction of 260,000 new housing units within five years. Le Corbusier immediately began to design a new type of modular housing unit, which he called the Maison Loucheur, which would be suitable for the project. These units were in size, made with metal frames, and were designed to be mass-produced and then transported to the site, where they would be inserted into frameworks of steel and stone; The government insisted on stone walls to win the support of local building contractors. The standardisation of apartment buildings was the essence of what Le Corbusier termed the \"Ville Radieuse\" or \"radiant city\", in a new book published in 1935. The Radiant City was similar to his earlier Contemporary City and Plan Voisin, with the difference that residences would be assigned by family size, rather than by income and social position. In his 1935 book, he developed his ideas for a new kind of city, where the principal functions; heavy industry, manufacturing, habitation and commerce, would be separated into their neighbourhoods, carefully planned and designed. However, before any units could be built, World War II intervened.\nWorld War II and Reconstruction; \"Unit\u00e9 d'Habitation\" in Marseille (1939\u20131952).\nDuring the War and the German occupation of France, Le Corbusier did his best to promote his architectural projects. He moved to Vichy for a time, where the collaborationist government of Marshal Philippe P\u00e9tain was located, offering his services for architectural projects, including his plan for the reconstruction of Algiers, but they were rejected. He continued writing, completing \"Sur les Quatres routes\" (On the Four Routes) in 1941. After 1942 Le Corbusier left Vichy for Paris. He became for a time a technical adviser at Alexis Carrel's eugenics foundation but resigned on 20 April 1944. In 1943 he founded a new association of modern architects and builders, the Ascoral, the Assembly of Constructors for a renewal of architecture, but there were no projects to build.\nWhen the war ended Le Corbusier was nearly sixty years old and he had not had a single project realized for ten years. He tried, without success, to obtain commissions for several of the first large reconstruction projects, but his proposals for the reconstruction of the town of Saint-Di\u00e9 and for La Rochelle were rejected. Still, he persisted and finally found a willing partner in Raoul Dautry, the new Minister of Reconstruction and Town Planning. Dautry agreed to fund one of his projects, a \"Unit\u00e9 habitation de grandeur conforme\", or housing units of standard size, with the first one to be built in Marseille, which had been heavily damaged during the war.\nThis was his first public commission and was a breakthrough for Le Corbusier. He gave the building the name of his pre-war theoretical project, the \"Cit\u00e9 Radieuse\", and followed the principles that he had studied before the war, proposing a giant reinforced-concrete framework into which modular apartments would fit like bottles into a bottle rack. Like the Villa Savoye, the structure was poised on concrete pylons though, because of the shortage of steel to reinforce the concrete, the pylons were more massive than usual. The building contained 337 duplex apartment modules to house a total of 1,600 people. Each module was three storeys high and contained two apartments, combined so each had two levels (see diagram above). The modules ran from one side of the building to the other and each apartment had a small terrace at each end. They were ingeniously fitted together like pieces of a Chinese puzzle, with a corridor slotted through the space between the two apartments in each module. Residents had a choice of twenty-three different configurations for the units. Le Corbusier designed furniture, carpets and lamps to go with the building, all purely functional; the only decoration was a choice of interior colours. The only mildly decorative features of the building were the ventilator shafts on the roof, which Le Corbusier made to look like the smokestacks of an ocean liner, a functional form that he admired.\nThe building was designed not just to be a residence but to offer all the services needed for living. On every third floor, between the modules, there was a wide corridor, like an interior street, which ran the length of the building. This served as a sort of commercial street, with shops, eating places, a nursery school and recreational facilities. A running track and small stage for theatre performances were located on the roof. The building itself was surrounded by trees and a small park.\nLe Corbusier wrote later that the \"Unit\u00e9 d'Habitation\" concept was inspired by the visit he had made to the Florence Charterhouse at Galluzzo in Italy, in 1907 and 1910 during his early travels. He wanted to recreate, he wrote, an ideal place \"for meditation and contemplation\". He also learned from the monastery, he wrote, that \"standardization led to perfection\", and that \"all of his life a man labours under this impulse: to make the home the temple of the family\".\nThe \"Unit\u00e9 d'Habitation\" marked a turning point in the career of Le Corbusier; in 1952, he was made a Commander of the L\u00e9gion d'Honneur in a ceremony held on the roof of his new building. He had progressed from being an outsider and critic of the architectural establishment to its centre, as the most prominent French architect.\nPostwar projects, United Nations headquarters (1947\u20131952).\nLe Corbusier made another almost identical Unit\u00e9 d'Habitation in Rez\u00e9-les-Nantes in the Loire-Atlantique Department between 1948 and 1952, and three more over the following years, in Berlin, Briey-en-For\u00eat and Firminy; and he designed a factory for the company of Claude and Duval, in Saint-Di\u00e9 in the Vosges. In the post-Second World War decades, Le Corbusier's fame moved beyond architectural and planning circles as he became one of the leading intellectual figures of the time.\nIn early 1947 Le Corbusier submitted a design for the headquarters of the United Nations, which was to be built beside the East River in New York. Instead of competition, the design was to be selected by a Board of Design Consultants composed of leading international architects nominated by member governments, including Le Corbusier, Oscar Niemeyer of Brazil, Howard Robertson from Britain, Nikolai Bassov of the Soviet Union, and five others from around the world. The committee was under the direction of the American architect Wallace K. Harrison, who was also the architect for the Rockefeller family, which had donated the site for the building.\nLe Corbusier had submitted his plan for the Secretariat, called Plan 23 of the 58 submitted. In Le Corbusier's plan offices, council chambers and General Assembly Hall were in a single block in the centre of the site. He lobbied hard for his project, and asked the younger Brazilian architect, Niemeyer, to support and assist him with his plan. Niemeyer, to help Le Corbusier, refused to submit his design and did not attend the meetings until the Director, Harrison, insisted. Niemeyer then submitted his plan, Plan 32, with the office building and councils and General Assembly in separate buildings. After much discussion, the Committee chose Niemeyer's plan but suggested that he collaborate with Le Corbusier on the final project. Le Corbusier urged Niemeyer to put the General Assembly Hall in the centre of the site, though this would eliminate Niemeyer's plan to have a large plaza in the centre. Niemeyer agreed with Le Corbusier's suggestion, and the headquarters was built, with minor modifications, according to their joint plan.\nReligious architecture (1950\u201363).\nLe Corbusier was an avowed atheist, but he also had a strong belief in the ability of architecture to create a sacred and spiritual environment. In the postwar years, he designed two important religious buildings; the chapel of Notre-Dame-du-Haut at Ronchamp (1950\u20131955); and the Convent of Sainte Marie de La Tourette (1953\u20131960). Le Corbusier wrote later that he was greatly aided in his religious architecture by a Dominican father, Marie-Alain Couturier, who had founded a movement and review of modern religious art.\nLe Corbusier first visited the remote mountain site of Ronchamp in May 1950, saw the ruins of the old chapel, and drew sketches of possible forms. He wrote afterwards: \"In building this chapel, I wanted to create a place of silence, of peace, of prayer, of interior joy. The feeling of the sacred animated our effort. Some things are sacred, others aren't, whether they're religious or not.\"\nThe second major religious project undertaken by Le Corbusier was the Convent of Sainte Marie de La Tourette in L'Arbresle in the Rhone Department (1953\u20131960). Once again it was Father Couturier who engaged Le Corbusier in the project. He invited Le Corbusier to visit the starkly simple and imposing 12th\u201313th century Le Thoronet Abbey in Provence, and also used his memories of his youthful visit to the Erna Charterhouse in Florence. This project involved not only a chapel, but a library, refectory, rooms for meetings and reflection, and dormitories for the nuns. For the living space he used the same Modulor concept for measuring the ideal living space that he had used in the Unit\u00e9 d'Habitation in Marseille; height under the ceiling of ; and width .\nLe Corbusier used raw concrete to construct the convent, which is placed on the side of a hill. The three blocks of dormitories are U, closed by the chapel, with a courtyard in the centre. The Convent has a flat roof and is placed on sculpted concrete pillars. Each of the residential cells has a small loggia with a concrete sunscreen looking out at the countryside. The centrepiece of the convent is the chapel, a plain box of concrete, which he called his \"Box of miracles.\" Unlike the highly finished fa\u00e7ade of the Unit\u00e9 d'Habitation, the fa\u00e7ade of the chapel is raw, unfinished concrete. He described the building in a letter to Albert Camus in 1957: \"I'm taken with the idea of a \"box of miracles\"...as the name indicates, it is a rectangular box made of concrete. It doesn't have any of the traditional theatrical tricks, but the possibility, as its name suggests, to make miracles.\" The interior of the chapel is extremely simple, only benches in a plain, unfinished concrete box, with light coming through a single square in the roof and six small bands on the sides. The Crypt beneath has intense blue, red and yellow walls, and illumination by sunlight channelled from above. The monastery has other unusual features, including floor to ceiling panels of glass in the meeting rooms, window panels that fragmented the view into pieces, and a system of concrete and metal tubes like gun barrels which aimed sunlight through coloured prisms and projected it onto the walls of the sacristy and to the secondary altars of the crypt on the level below. These were whimsically termed the \"\"machine guns\" of the sacristy and the \"light cannons\" of the crypt.\nIn 1960, Le Corbusier began a third religious building, the Church of Saint Pierre in the new town of Firminy-Vert, where he had built a Unit\u00e9 d'Habitation and a cultural and sports centre. While he made the original design, construction did not begin until five years after his death, and work continued under different architects until it was completed in 2006. The most spectacular feature of the church is the sloping concrete tower that covers the entire interior, similar to that in the Assembly Building in his complex at Chandigarh. Windows high in the tower illuminates the interior. Le Corbusier originally proposed that tiny windows also project the form of a constellation on the walls. Later architects designed the church to project the constellation Orion.\nChandigarh (1951\u20131956).\nLe Corbusier's largest and most ambitious project was the design of Chandigarh, the capital city of the Punjab and Haryana States of India, created after India received independence in 1947. Le Corbusier was contacted in 1950 by Indian Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru, and invited to propose a project. An American architect, Albert Mayer, had made a plan in 1947 for a city of 150,000 inhabitants, but the Indian government wanted a grander and more monumental city. Corbusier worked on the plan with two British specialists in urban design and tropical climate architecture, Maxwell Fry and Jane Drew, and with his cousin, Pierre Jeanneret, who moved to India and supervised the construction until his death.\nLe Corbusier, as always, was rhapsodic about his project; \"It will be a city of trees,\" he wrote, \"of flowers and water, of houses as simple as those at the time of Homer, and of a few splendid edifices of the highest level of modernism, where the rules of mathematics will reign.\" His plan called for residential, commercial and industrial areas, along with parks and transportation infrastructure. In the middle was the capitol, a complex of four major government buildings; the Palace of the National Assembly, the High Court of Justice; the Palace of Secretariat of Ministers, and the Palace of the Governor. For financial and political reasons, the Palace of the Governor was dropped well into the construction of the city, throwing the final project somewhat off-balance. From the beginning, Le Corbusier worked, as he reported, \"Like a forced labourer.\" He dismissed the earlier American plan as \"Faux-Moderne\" and overly filled with parking spaces and roads. He intended to present what he had learned in forty years of urban study, and also to show the French government the opportunities they had missed in not choosing him to rebuild French cities after the War. His design made use of many of his favourite ideas: an architectural promenade, incorporating the local landscape and the sunlight and shadows into the design; the use of the Modulor to give a correct human scale to each element somewhat based on the proportions of the human body; and his favourite symbol, the open hand (\"The hand is open to give and to receive\"). He placed a monumental open hand statue in a prominent place in the design.\nLe Corbusier's design called for the use of raw concrete, whose surface was not smoothed or polished and which showed the marks of the forms in which it dried. Pierre Jeanneret wrote to his cousin that he was in a continual battle with the construction workers, who could not resist the urge to smooth and finish the raw concrete, particularly when important visitors were coming to the site. At one point one thousand workers were employed on the site of the High Court of Justice. Le Corbusier wrote to his mother, \"It is an architectural symphony which surpasses all my hopes, which flashes and develops under the light in a way which is unimaginable and unforgettable. From far, from up close, it provokes astonishment; all made with raw concrete and a cement cannon. Adorable, and grandiose. In all the centuries no one has seen that.\"\nThe High Court of Justice, begun in 1951, was finished in 1956. The building was radical in its design; a parallelogram topped with an inverted parasol. Along the walls were high concrete grills thick which served as sunshades. The entry featured a monumental ramp and columns that allowed the air to circulate. The pillars were originally white limestone, but in the 1960s they were repainted in bright colours, which better resisted the weather.\nThe Secretariat, the largest building that housed the government offices, was constructed between 1952 and 1958. It is an enormous block long and eight levels high, served by a ramp which extends from the ground to the top level. The ramp was designed to be partly sculptural and partly practical. Since there were no modern building cranes at the time of construction, the ramp was the only way to get materials to the top of the construction site. The Secretariat had two features which were borrowed from his design for the Unit\u00e9 d'Habitation in Marseille: concrete grill sunscreens over the windows and a roof terrace.\nThe most important building of the capitol complex was the Palace of Assembly (1952\u201361), which faced the High Court at the other end of a esplanade with a large reflecting pool in the front. This building features a central courtyard, over which is the main meeting hall for the Assembly. On the roof on the rear of the building is a signature feature of Le Corbusier, a large tower, similar in form to the smokestack of a ship or the ventilation tower of a heating plant. Le Corbusier added touches of colour and texture with an immense tapestry in the meeting hall and a large gateway decorated with enamel. He wrote of this building, \"A Palace magnificent in its effect, from the new art of raw concrete. It is magnificent and terrible; terrible meaning that there is nothing cold about it to the eyes.\"\nLater life and work (1955\u20131965).\nThe 1950s and 1960s were a difficult period for Le Corbusier's personal life: his wife Yvonne died in 1957 and his mother, to whom he was closely attached, died in 1960. He remained active in a wide variety of fields: in 1955 he published \"Po\u00e9me de l'angle droit\", a portfolio of lithographs, published in the same collection as the book \"Jazz\" by Henri Matisse. In 1958 he collaborated with the composer Edgar Var\u00e8se on a work called \"Le Po\u00e8me \u00e9lectronique\", a show of sound and light, for the Philips Pavilion at the International Exposition in Brussels. In 1960 he published a new book, \"L'Atelier de la recherch\u00e9 patiente\" \"The workshop of patient research\"), simultaneously published in four languages. He received growing recognition for his pioneering work in modernist architecture: in 1959 a successful international campaign was launched to have his Villa Savoye, threatened with demolition, declared a historic monument; it was the first time that a work by a living architect had received this distinction. In 1962, in the same year as the dedication of the Palace of the Assembly in Chandigarh, the first retrospective exhibit on his work was held at the National Museum of Modern Art in Paris. In 1964, in a ceremony held in his atelier on rue de S\u00e8vres, he was awarded the Grand Cross of the L\u00e9gion d'honneur by Culture Minister Andr\u00e9 Malraux.\nHis later architectural work was extremely varied and often based on designs of earlier projects. In 1952\u20131958 he designed a series of tiny holiday cabins, in size, for a site next to the Mediterranean at Roquebrune-Cap-Martin. He built a similar cabin for himself but the rest of the project was not realized until after his death. From 1953 to 1957 he designed the Maison du Br\u00e9sil, a residential building for Brazilian students for the Cit\u00e9 Universitaire in Paris. Between 1954 and 1959 he built the National Museum of Western Art in Tokyo. His other projects included a cultural centre and stadium for the town of Firminy, where he had built his first housing project (1955\u20131958), and a stadium in Baghdad, Iraq (much altered since its construction). He also constructed three new \"Unit\u00e9s d'Habitation\" apartment blocks on the model of the original in Marseille, the first in Berlin (1956\u20131958), the second in Briey-en-For\u00eat in the Meurthe-et-Moselle Department, and the third (1959\u20131967) in Firminy. From 1960 to 1963 he built his only building in the United States, the Carpenter Center for the Visual Arts in Cambridge, Massachusetts. J\u00f8rn Utzon, the architect of the Sydney Opera House, commissioned Le Corbusier to create furnishings for the nascent opera house. Le Corbusier designed a tapestry, \"Les D\u00e9s Sont Jet\u00e9s\", which was completed in 1960.\nLe Corbusier died of a heart attack at age 77 in 1965 after swimming on the French Riviera. At the time of his death several projects were on the drawing board: the church of Saint-Pierre in Firminy, finally completed in modified form in 2006, a Palace of Congresses for Strasbourg (1962\u201365) and a hospital in Venice (1961\u20131965), which were never built. Le Corbusier designed an art gallery beside the lake in Z\u00fcrich for gallery owner Heidi Weber in 1962\u20131967. Now called the Centre Le Corbusier, it is one of his last finished works.\nEstate.\nThe Fondation Le Corbusier (FLC) functions as his official estate. The US copyright representative for the Fondation Le Corbusier is the Artists Rights Society.\nIdeas.\n\"The Five Points of a Modern Architecture\".\nLe Corbusier defined the principles of his new architecture in \"Les cinq points de l'architecture moderne\", published in 1927, and co-authored by his cousin, Pierre Jeanneret. They summarized the lessons he had learned in the previous years, which he put literally into concrete form in his villas constructed in the late 1920s, most dramatically in the Villa Savoye (1928\u20131931).\nThe five points are:\n\"Architectural Promenade\".\nThe \"Architectural Promenade\" was another idea dear to Le Corbusier, which he particularly put into play in his design of the Villa Savoye. In 1928, in \"Une Maison, un Palais\", he described it: \"Arab architecture gives us a precious lesson: it is best appreciated in walking, on foot. It is in walking, in going from one place to another, that you see develop the features of the architecture. In this house (Villa Savoye) you find a veritable architectural promenade, offering constantly varying aspects, unexpected, sometimes astonishing.\" The promenade at Villa Savoye, Le Corbusier wrote, both in the interior of the house and on the roof terrace, often erased the traditional difference between the inside and outside.\n\"Ville Radieuse\" and Urbanism.\nIn the 1930s, Le Corbusier expanded and reformulated his ideas on urbanism, eventually publishing them in \"La Ville radieuse\" (The Radiant City) in 1935. Perhaps the most significant difference between the Contemporary City and the Radiant City is that the latter abandoned the class-based stratification of the former; housing was now assigned according to family size, not economic position. Some have read dark overtones into \"The Radiant City\": from the \"astonishingly beautiful assemblage of buildings\" that was Stockholm, for example, Le Corbusier saw only \"frightening chaos and saddening monotony.\" He dreamed of \"cleaning and purging\" the city, bringing \"a calm and powerful architecture\"\u2014referring to steel, plate glass, and reinforced concrete. Although Le Corbusier's designs for Stockholm did not succeed, later architects took his ideas and partly \"destroyed\" the city with them.\nLe Corbusier hoped that politically minded industrialists in France would lead the way with their efficient Taylorist and Fordist strategies adopted from American industrial models to reorganize society. As Norma Evenson has put it, \"the proposed city appeared to some an audacious and compelling vision of a brave new world, and to others, a frigid megalomaniacally scaled negation of the familiar urban ambient.\"\nLe Corbusier \"His ideas\u2014his urban planning and his architecture\u2014are viewed separately,\" Perelman noted, \"whereas they are the same thing.\"\nIn \"La Ville radieuse\", he conceived an essentially apolitical society, in which the bureaucracy of economic administration effectively replaces the state.\nLe Corbusier was heavily indebted to the thought of the 19th-century French utopians Saint-Simon and Charles Fourier. There is a noteworthy resemblance between the concept of the unit\u00e9 and Fourier's phalanstery. From Fourier, Le Corbusier adopted at least in part his notion of administrative, rather than political, government.\nModulor.\nThe Modulor was a standard model of the human form which Le Corbusier devised to determine the correct amount of living space needed for residents in his buildings. It was also his rather original way of dealing with differences between the metric system and the British or American system since the Modulor was not attached to either one.\nLe Corbusier explicitly used the golden ratio in his Modulor system for the scale of architectural proportion. He saw this system as a continuation of the long tradition of Vitruvius, Leonardo da Vinci's \"Vitruvian Man\", the work of Leon Battista Alberti, and others who used the proportions of the human body to improve the appearance and function of architecture. In addition to the golden ratio, Le Corbusier based the system on human measurements, Fibonacci numbers, and the double unit. Many scholars see the Modulor as a humanistic expression but it is also argued that: \"It's exactly the opposite (...) It's the mathematization of the body, the standardization of the body, the rationalization of the body.\"\nHe took Leonardo's suggestion of the golden ratio in human proportions to an extreme: he sectioned his model human body's height at the navel with the two sections in golden ratio, then subdivided those sections in golden ratio at the knees and throat; he used these golden ratio proportions in the Modulor system.\nLe Corbusier's 1927 Villa Stein in Garches exemplified the Modulor system's application. The villa's rectangular ground plan, elevation, and inner structure closely approximate golden rectangles.\nLe Corbusier placed systems of harmony and proportion at the centre of his design philosophy, and his faith in the mathematical order of the universe was closely bound to the golden section and the Fibonacci series, which he described as \"rhythms apparent to the eye and clear in their relations with one another. And these rhythms are at the very root of human activities. They resound in Man by an organic inevitability, the same fine inevitability which causes the tracing out of the Golden Section by children, old men, savages, and the learned.\"\nOpen Hand.\nThe Open Hand (La Main Ouverte) is a recurring motif in Le Corbusier's architecture, a sign for him of \"peace and reconciliation. It is open to give and open to receive.\" The largest of the many Open Hand sculptures that Le Corbusier created is a version in Chandigarh, India, known as \"Open Hand Monument\".\nPalette.\nIn Le Corbusier's color theory, published in 1931, he introduced a carefully selected palette of 43 colors intended for specific architectural contexts. In 1959, he expanded it with 20 new shades, bringing the total number of colors to 63.\nFurniture.\nLe Corbusier was an eloquent critic of the finely crafted, hand-made furniture, made with rare and exotic woods, inlays and coverings, presented at the 1925 Exposition of Decorative Arts. Following his usual method, Le Corbusier first wrote a book with his theories of furniture, complete with memorable slogans. In his 1925 book \"L'Art D\u00e9coratif d'aujourd'hui\", he called for furniture that used inexpensive materials and could be mass-produced. Le Corbusier described three different furniture types: \"type-needs\", \"type-furniture\", and \"human-limb objects\". He defined human-limb objects as: \"Extensions of our limbs and adapted to human functions that are type-needs and type-functions, therefore type-objects and type-furniture. The human-limb object is a docile servant. A good servant is discreet and self-effacing to leave his master free. Certainly, works of art are tools, beautiful tools. And long live the good taste manifested by choice, subtlety, proportion, and harmony\". He further declared: \"Chairs are architecture, sofas are bourgeois\".\nLe Corbusier first relied on ready-made furniture from Thonet to furnish his projects, such as his pavilion at the 1925 Exposition. In 1928, following the publication of his theories, he began experimenting with furniture design. In 1928, he invited the architect Charlotte Perriand to join his studio as a furniture designer. His cousin, Pierre Jeanneret, also collaborated on many of the designs. For the manufacture of his furniture, he turned to the German firm Gebr\u00fcder Thonet, which had begun making chairs with tubular steel, a material originally used for bicycles, in the early 1920s. Le Corbusier admired the design of Marcel Breuer and the Bauhaus, who in 1925 had begun making sleek modern tubular club chairs. Mies van der Rohe had begun making his version in a sculptural curved form with a cane seat in 1927.\nThe first results of the collaboration between Le Corbusier and Perriand were three types of chairs made with chrome-plated tubular steel frames: The LC4, Chaise Longue, (1927\u201328), with a covering of cowhide, which gave it a touch of exoticism; the \"Fauteuil Grand Confort\" (LC3) (1928\u201329), a club chair with a tubular frame which resembled the comfortable Art Deco club chairs that became popular in the 1920s; and the \"Fauteuil \u00e0 dossier vascular\" (LC4) (1928\u201329), a low seat suspended in a tubular steel frame, also with cowhide upholstery. These chairs were designed specifically for two of his projects, the \"Maison la Roche\" in Paris and a pavilion for Barbara and Henry Church. All three clearly showed the influence of Mies van der Rohe and Marcel Breuer. The line of furniture was expanded with additional designs for Le Corbusier's 1929 installation, 'Equipment for the Home'. Despite the intention of Le Corbusier that his furniture should be inexpensive and mass-produced, his pieces were originally costly to make and were not mass-produced until many years later, when he was famous.\nControversies.\nThere is debate over the apparently variable or contradictory nature of Le Corbusier's political views. In the 1920s, he co-founded and contributed articles about urbanism to the fascist journals \"Plans\", \"Pr\u00e9lude\" and \"L'Homme R\u00e9el\". He also penned pieces in favour of Nazi antisemitism for those journals, as well as \"hateful editorials\". Between 1925 and 1928, Le Corbusier had connections to Le Faisceau, a short-lived French fascist party led by Georges Valois (Valois later became an anti-fascist). Le Corbusier knew another former member of Faisceau, Hubert Lagardelle, a former labor leader and syndicalist who had become disaffected with the political left. In 1934, after Lagardelle had obtained a position at the French embassy in Rome, he arranged for Le Corbusier to lecture on architecture in Italy. Lagardelle later served as minister of labor in the pro-Axis Vichy regime. While Le Corbusier sought commissions from the Vichy regime, particularly the redesign of Marseille after its Jewish population had been forcefully removed, he was unsuccessful, and the only appointment he received from it was membership of a committee studying urbanism. Alexis Carrel, a eugenicist surgeon, appointed Le Corbusier to the Department of Bio-Sociology of the \"Foundation for the Study of Human Problems\", an institute promoting eugenics policies under the Vichy regime.\nLe Corbusier has been accused of antisemitism. He wrote to his mother in October 1940, as the Vichy government enacted anti-Jewish laws: \"The Jews are having a bad time. I occasionally feel sorry. But it appears their blind lust for money has rotted the country.\" He was also accused of belittling the Muslim population of Algeria, then part of France. When Le Corbusier proposed a plan for the rebuilding of Algiers, he condemned the existing housing for European Algerians, complaining that it was inferior to that inhabited by indigenous Algerians: \"the civilized live like rats in holes\" while \"the barbarians live in solitude, in well-being.\" His plan for rebuilding Algiers was rejected, and thereafter Le Corbusier mostly avoided politics.\nCriticism.\nIn his eulogy to Le Corbusier at the memorial ceremony for the architect in the courtyard of the Louvre on 1 September 1965, French Culture Minister Andr\u00e9 Malraux declared, \"Le Corbusier had some great rivals, but none of them had the same significance in the revolution of architecture, because none bore insults so patiently and for so long.\"\nLater criticism of Le Corbusier was directed at his ideas on urban planning. In 1998, the architectural historian Witold Rybczynski wrote in \"Time\" magazine: \"He called it the Ville Radieuse, the Radiant City. Despite the poetic title, his urban vision was authoritarian, inflexible and simplistic. Wherever it was tried\u2014in Chandigarh by Le Corbusier himself or in Brasilia by his followers\u2014it failed. Standardization proved inhuman and disorienting. The open spaces were inhospitable; the bureaucratically imposed plan was socially destructive. In the US, the Radiant City took the form of vast urban-renewal schemes and regimented public housing projects that damaged the urban fabric beyond repair. Today, these megaprojects are being dismantled, as superblocks give way to rows of houses fronting streets and sidewalks. Downtowns have discovered that combining, not separating, different activities is the key to success. So is the presence of lively residential neighbourhoods, old as well as new. Cities have learned that preserving history makes more sense than starting from zero. It has been an expensive lesson, and not one that Le Corbusier intended, but it too is part of his legacy.\"\n and architecture critic Lewis Mumford wrote in \"Yesterday's City of Tomorrow\" that the extravagant heights of Le Corbusier's skyscrapers had no reason for existence apart from the fact that they had become technological possibilities. The open spaces in his central areas had no reason for existence either, Mumford wrote, since on the scale he imagined, there was no motive during the business day for pedestrian circulation in the office quarter. By \"mating utilitarian and financial image of the skyscraper city to the romantic image of the organic environment, Le Corbusier had produced a sterile hybrid.\"\nThe public housing projects influenced by his ideas have been criticized for isolating poor communities in monolithic high-rises and breaking the social ties integral to a community's development. One of his most influential detractors has been Jane Jacobs, who delivered a scathing critique of Le Corbusier's urban design theories in her seminal work \"The Death and Life of Great American Cities\".\nFor some critics, the urbanism of Le Corbusier was the model for a fascist state. These critics cited Le Corbusier himself when he wrote that \"not all citizens could become leaders. The technocratic elite, the industrialists, financiers, engineers, and artists would be located in the city centre, while the workers would be removed to the fringes of the city\".\nAlessandro Hseuh-Bruni wrote in \"Le Corbusier's Fatal Flaws \u2013 A Critique of Modernism\" that \"In addition to setting the stage for infrastructural developments to come, Le Corbusier's blueprints and models, while not so well-regarded by urban planners and street dwellers alike, also examined the sociological side of cities in great detail. World War II left millions dead and transformed the urban landscape throughout much of Europe, from England to the Soviet Union, and housing on a mass scale was necessary. Le Corbusier personally took this as a challenge to accommodate the masses on an unprecedented scale. This mission statement manifested itself in the form of \"Cit\u00e9 Radieuse\" (The Radiant City), located in Marseille, France. The construction of this utopian sanctuary was dependent on the destruction of traditional neighbourhoods \u2013 he showed no regard for French cultural heritage and tradition. Entire neighbourhoods were ravaged to make way for these dense, uniform concrete blocks. If he had his way, Paris' elite Marais community would have been destroyed. In addition, the theme of segregation that plagued earlier models of Le Corbusier's continued in this supposed utopian vision, with the wealthy elite being the only ones to access the luxuries of modernism.\"\nInfluence.\nLe Corbusier was concerned about problems he saw in industrial cities at the turn of the 20th century. He thought industrial housing techniques led to crowding, dirtiness, and a lack of a moral landscape. He was a leader of the modernist movement to create better-living conditions and a better society through housing. Ebenezer Howard's \"Garden Cities of Tomorrow\" heavily influenced Le Corbusier and his contemporaries.\nLe Corbusier revolutionized urban planning, and was a founding member of the Congr\u00e8s International d'Architecture Moderne (CIAM). One of the first to realize how the automobile would change human society, Le Corbusier conceived the city of the future with large apartment buildings isolated in a park-like setting on pilotis. Le Corbusier's plans were adopted by builders of public housing in Europe and the United States. In Great Britain, urban planners turned to Le Corbusier's \"Cities in the Sky\" as a cheaper method of building public housing from the late 1950s. Le Corbusier criticized any effort at ornamentation of the buildings.\nMany skyscrapers in Hong Kong and Frankfurt have been inspired by Le Corbusier, and his style is still used as influence for buildings worldwide.\nFondation Le Corbusier.\nThe Fondation Le Corbusier, established in 1946, is a private foundation and archive honoring the work of Le Corbusier. It owns and operates Maison La Roche, a museum located in the 16th arrondissement at 8\u201310, square du Dr Blanche, Paris, France, which is open daily except for Sunday.\nThe Foundation also owns Maison Jeanneret (which forms the foundation's headquarters), as well as the penthouse apartment with rooftop garden occupied by Le Corbusier from 1933 to 1965 at rue Nungesser et Coli in Paris 16e, that is used as guest housing for visiting scholars working in the Fondation Le Corbusier archives. It also owns the \"Small House\" he built for his parents in Corseaux on the shores of Lac Leman (1924).\nMaison La Roche and Maison Jeanneret (1923\u201324), also known as the La Roche-Jeanneret house, is a pair of semi-detached houses that was Le Corbusier's third commission in Paris. They are laid out at right angles to each other, with iron, concrete, and blank, white fa\u00e7ades setting off a curved two-story gallery space. Maison La Roche is now a museum containing about 8,000 original drawings, studies and plans by Le Corbusier (in collaboration with Pierre Jeanneret from 1922 to 1940), as well as about 450 of his paintings, about 30 enamels, about 200 other works on paper, and a sizable collection of written and photographic archives. It describes itself as the world's largest collection of Le Corbusier drawings, studies, and plans.\nWorld Heritage Site.\nIn 2016, seventeen of Le Corbusier's buildings spanning seven countries were identified as UNESCO World Heritage Sites, reflecting \"outstanding contribution to the Modern Movement.\"\nMemorials.\nLe Corbusier's portrait was featured on the 10 Swiss francs banknote, pictured with his distinctive eyeglasses.\nThe following place-names carry his name:\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "17901", "revid": "47033785", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=17901", "title": "Ludovico Ariosto", "text": "Italian poet (1474\u20131533)\nLudovico Ariosto (, ; ; 8 September 1474 \u2013 6 July 1533) was an Italian poet. He is best known as the author of the romance epic \"Orlando Furioso\" (1516). The poem, a continuation of Matteo Maria Boiardo's \"Orlando Innamorato\", describes the adventures of Charlemagne, Orlando, and the Franks as they battle against the Saracens with diversions into many sideplots. The poem is transformed into a satire of the chivalric tradition. Ariosto composed the poem in the ottava rima rhyme scheme and introduced narrative commentary throughout the work.\nAriosto also coined the term \"humanism\" (in Italian, \"umanesimo\") for choosing to focus upon the strengths and potential of humanity, rather than only upon its role as subordinate to God. This led to Renaissance humanism.\nBirth and early life.\nAriosto was born in Reggio nell'Emilia, where his father Niccol\u00f2 Ariosto was commander of the citadel. He was the oldest of 10 children and was seen as the successor to the patriarchal position of his family. From his earliest years, Ludovico was very interested in poetry, but he was obliged by his father to study law.\nAfter five years of law, Ariosto was allowed to read classics under Gregorio da Spoleto. Ariosto's studies of Greek and Latin literature were cut short by Spoleto's move to France to tutor Francesco Sforza. Shortly after this, Ariosto's father died.\nEducation and patronage.\nAfter the death of his father, Ludovico Ariosto was compelled to forgo his literary occupations and take care of his family, whose affairs were in disarray. Despite his family obligations, Ariosto managed to write some comedies in prose as well as lyrical pieces. Some of these attracted the notice of Cardinal Ippolito d'Este, who took the young poet under his patronage and appointed him one of the gentlemen of his household. Este compensated Ariosto poorly for his efforts; the only reward he gave the poet for \"Orlando Furioso\", dedicated to him, was the question, \"Where did you find so many stories, Master Ludovico?\" Ariosto later said that the cardinal was ungrateful, that he deplored the time which he spent under his yoke, and that if he received some small pension, it was not to reward him for his poetry \u2013 which the prelate despised \u2013 but for acting as a messenger.\nLudovico Ariosto and Leonardo da Vinci shared a patron in Cardinal Ippolito d'Este's older sister the Marchioness Isabella d'Este, the \"First Lady of the Renaissance.\" Isabella d'Este appears in Ludovico's masterpiece, \"Orlando Furioso\". She also appears in Leonardo's \"Sketch for a Portrait of Isabella d'Este\" at the Louvre.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\u2014\u200a\nThe cardinal went to Hungary in 1518, and wished Ariosto to accompany him. The poet excused himself, pleading ill health, his love of study, and the need to care for his elderly mother. His excuses were not well-received, and he was denied even an interview. Ariosto and d'Este got into a heated argument, and Ariosto was promptly dismissed from service.\nNew patronage and diplomatic career.\nThe cardinal's brother, Alfonso, duke of Ferrara, now took Ariosto under his patronage. By then, Ariosto had already distinguished himself as a diplomat, chiefly on the occasion of two visits to Rome as ambassador to Pope Julius II. The fatigue of one of these journeys brought on an illness from which he never recovered, and on his second mission he was nearly killed by order of the Pope, who happened at the time to be in conflict with Alfonso.\nOn account of the war, his salary of 84 crowns a year was suspended, and it was withdrawn altogether after the peace. Because of this, Ariosto asked the duke either to provide for him, or to allow him to seek employment elsewhere. He was appointed to the province of Garfagnana, then without a governor, situated on the Apennines, an appointment he held for three years. The province was distracted by factions and bandits, the governor lacked the requisite means to enforce his authority and the duke did little to support his minister. Ariosto's government satisfied both the sovereign and the people given over to his care, however; indeed, there is a story about a time when he was walking alone and fell into the company of a group of bandits, the chief of which, on discovering that his captive was the author of \"Orlando Furioso\", apologized for not having immediately shown him the respect due his rank.\nIn 1508 Ariosto's play \"Cassaria\" appeared, and the next year \"I suppositi\" was first acted in Ferrara and ten years later in the Vatican. A prose edition was published in Rome in 1524, and the first verse edition was published at Venice in 1551. The play, which was translated by George Gascoigne and acted at Gray's Inn in London in 1566 and published in 1573, was later used by Shakespeare as a source for \"The Taming of the Shrew\".\nIn 1516 the first version of the \"Orlando Furioso\" in 40 cantos, was published at Ferrara. The third and final version of the \"Orlando Furioso\", in 46 cantos, appeared on 8 September 1532. The work is according to Goethe \u201ca graceful smiling fantastic creation\u201d. The third edition of the book is quite distinct in terms of diction and structure. However, it seems that today, the reader tends to consider this version as the primary text. Therefore, it might be beneficial to read the three texts in comparison to gain a more comprehensive understanding. Additionally, imitation was a matter of grace at that time, which is why Ariosto took on the task of completing Boiardo's unfinished \"Orlando Innamorato\".\nPoetic style.\nThroughout Ariosto's writing are narratorial comments dubbed by Daniel Javitch as \"Cantus Interruptus\". Javitch's term refers to Ariosto's narrative technique to break off one plot line in the middle of a canto, only to pick it up again in another, often much later, canto. Javitch argues that while many critics have assumed Ariosto does this so as to build narrative tension and keep the reader turning pages, the poet in reality defuses narrative tension because so much time separates the interruption and the resumption. By the time the reader gets to the continuation of the story, he or she has often forgotten or ceased to care about the plot and is usually wrapped up in another plot. Ariosto does this, Javitch argues, to undermine \"man's foolish but persistent desire for continuity and completion\". Ariosto uses it throughout his works.\nFor example, in Canto II, stanza 30, of \"Orlando Furioso\", the narrator says:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSome have attributed this piece of metafiction as one component of the \"Sorriso ariostesco\" or Ariosto's smile, the wry sense of humor that Ariosto adds to the text.\nIn explaining this humor, Thomas Greene, in \"Descent from Heaven\", says:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The two persistent qualities of Ariosto's language are first, serenity \u2013 the evenness and self-contented assurance with which it urbanely flows, and second, brilliance \u2013 the Mediterranean glitter and sheen which neither dazzle nor obscure but confer on every object its precise outline and glinting surface. Only occasionally can Ariosto's language truly be said to be witty, but its lightness and agility create a surface which conveys a witty effect. Too much wit could destroy even the finest poem, but Ariosto's graceful \"brio\" is at least as difficult and for narrative purposes more satisfying.\u2014\u200a\nIn literature and popular culture.\nLetitia Elizabeth Landon's poem . (1836) is supposed to be his address to some unknown beauty on presenting her with his completed \"Orlando Furioso\".\nIn his poem \"Childe Harold's Pilgrimage\", Canto the Fourth (1818), Lord Byron described poet and novelist Walter Scott as \"The Ariosto of the North\", and Ariosto as \"The southern Scott\". In doing so, Byron connected Ariosto and the Italian Renaissance with early-nineteenth century Scottish and British Romantic writing, emphasising an enduring European literary tradition. Scott, in turn, was influenced by Ariosto and expressed his admiration for the \"Orlando Furioso\".\nThe paperback edition of \"Orlando Furioso\" can be briefly glimpsed on table in the dinner scene of the episode \"A Ghost\" in Jim Jarmusch's film \"Mystery Train\" (1989).\nLodovico Ariosto is mentioned in the novelization of the video game \"\" (2011) as a member of the fictional Italian Brotherhood of Assassins. When the protagonist Ezio Auditore retires from the Brotherhood following the events of the game in 1512, he appoints Lodovico to succeed him as Mentor.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He founded the studies of graph theory and topology and made influential discoveries in many other branches of mathematics, such as analytic number theory, complex analysis, and infinitesimal calculus. He also introduced much of modern mathematical terminology and notation, including the notion of a mathematical function. He is known for his work in mechanics, fluid dynamics, optics, astronomy, and music theory. Euler has been called a \"universal genius\" who \"was fully equipped with almost unlimited powers of imagination, intellectual gifts and extraordinary memory\". He spent most of his adult life in Saint Petersburg, Russia, and in Berlin, then the capital of Prussia.\nEuler is credited for popularizing the Greek letter formula_1 (lowercase pi) to denote the ratio of a circle's circumference to its diameter, as well as first using the notation formula_2 for the value of a function, the letter formula_3 to express the imaginary unit formula_4, the Greek letter formula_5 (capital sigma) to express summations, the Greek letter formula_6 (capital delta) for finite differences, and lowercase letters to represent the sides of a triangle while representing the angles as capital letters. He gave the current definition of the constant formula_7, the base of the natural logarithm, now known as Euler's number. Euler made contributions to applied mathematics and engineering, such as his study of ships, which helped navigation; his three volumes on optics, which contributed to the design of microscopes and telescopes; and his studies of beam bending and column critical loads.\nEuler is credited with being the first to develop graph theory (partly as a solution for the problem of the Seven Bridges of K\u00f6nigsberg, which is also considered the first practical application of topology). He also became famous for, among many other accomplishments, solving several unsolved problems in number theory and analysis, including the famous Basel problem. Euler has also been credited for discovering that the sum of the numbers of vertices and faces minus the number of edges of a polyhedron that has no holes equals 2, a number now commonly known as the Euler characteristic. In physics, Euler reformulated Isaac Newton's laws of motion into new laws in his two-volume work \"Mechanica\" to better explain the motion of rigid bodies. He contributed to the study of elastic deformations of solid objects. Euler formulated the partial differential equations for the motion of inviscid fluid, and laid the mathematical foundations of potential theory.\nEuler is regarded as arguably the most prolific contributor in the history of mathematics and science, and the greatest mathematician of the 18th century. His 866 publications and his correspondence are being collected in the \"Opera Omnia Leonhard Euler\". Several great mathematicians who worked after Euler's death have recognised his importance in the field: Pierre-Simon Laplace said, \"Read Euler, read Euler, he is the master of us all\"; Carl Friedrich Gauss wrote: \"The study of Euler's works will remain the best school for the different fields of mathematics, and nothing else can replace it.\"\nEarly life.\nLeonhard Euler was born in Basel on 15 April 1707 to Paul III Euler, a pastor of the Reformed Church, and Marguerite (n\u00e9e Brucker), whose ancestors include a number of well-known scholars in the classics. He was the oldest of four children, with two younger sisters, Anna Maria and Maria Magdalena, and a younger brother, Johann Heinrich. Soon after Leonhard's birth, the Eulers moved from Basel to Riehen, Switzerland, where his father became pastor in the local church and Leonhard spent most of his childhood.\nFrom a young age, Euler received schooling in mathematics from his father, who had taken courses from Jacob Bernoulli some years earlier at the University of Basel. Around the age of eight, Euler was sent to live at his maternal grandmother's house and enrolled in the Latin school in Basel. In addition, he received private tutoring from Johannes Burckhardt, a young theologian with a keen interest in mathematics.\nIn 1720, at age 13, Euler enrolled at the University of Basel. Attending university at such a young age was not unusual at the time. The course on elementary mathematics was given by Johann Bernoulli, the younger brother of the deceased Jacob Bernoulli, who had taught Euler's father. Johann Bernoulli and Euler soon got to know each other better. Euler described Bernoulli in his autobiography:\nthe famous professor Johann Bernoulli [...] made it a special pleasure for himself to help me along in the mathematical sciences. Private lessons, however, he refused because of his busy schedule. However, he gave me a far more salutary advice, which consisted in myself getting a hold of some of the more difficult mathematical books and working through them with great diligence, and should I encounter some objections or difficulties, he offered me free access to him every Saturday afternoon, and he was gracious enough to comment on the collected difficulties, which was done with such a desired advantage that, when he resolved one of my objections, ten others at once disappeared, which certainly is the best method of making happy progress in the mathematical sciences.\nDuring this time, Euler, backed by Bernoulli, obtained his father's consent to become a mathematician instead of a pastor.\nIn 1723, Euler received a Master of Philosophy with a dissertation that compared the philosophies of Ren\u00e9 Descartes and Isaac Newton. Afterwards, he enrolled in the theological faculty of the University of Basel.\nIn 1726, Euler completed a dissertation on the propagation of sound titled \"De Sono\", with which he unsuccessfully attempted to obtain a position at the University of Basel. In 1727, he entered the Paris Academy prize competition (offered annually and later biennially by the academy beginning in 1720) for the first time. The problem posed that year was to find the best way to place the masts on a ship. Pierre Bouguer, who became known as \"the father of naval architecture\", won and Euler took second place. Over the years, Euler entered this competition 15 times, winning 12 of them.\nCareer.\nFirst Saint Petersburg period (1727\u20131741).\nJohann Bernoulli's two sons, Daniel and Nicolaus, entered into service at the Imperial Russian Academy of Sciences in Saint Petersburg in 1725, leaving Euler with the assurance they would recommend him to a post when one was available. On 31 July 1726, Nicolaus died of appendicitis after spending less than a year in Russia. When Daniel assumed his brother's position in the mathematics/physics division, he recommended that the post in physiology that he had vacated be filled by his friend Euler. In November 1726, Euler eagerly accepted the offer, but delayed making the trip to Saint Petersburg while he unsuccessfully applied for a physics professorship at the University of Basel.\nEuler arrived in Saint Petersburg in May 1727. He was promoted from his junior post in the medical department of the academy to a position in the mathematics department. He lodged with Daniel Bernoulli with whom he worked in close collaboration. Euler mastered Russian, settled into life in Saint Petersburg and took on an additional job as a medic in the Russian Navy.\nThe academy at Saint Petersburg, established by Peter the Great, was intended to improve education in Russia and to close the scientific gap with Western Europe. As a result, it was made especially attractive to foreign scholars like Euler. The academy's benefactress, Catherine I, who had continued the progressive policies of her late husband, died before Euler's arrival to Saint Petersburg. The Russian conservative nobility then gained power upon the ascension of the twelve-year-old Peter II. The nobility, suspicious of the academy's foreign scientists, cut funding for Euler and his colleagues and prevented the entrance of foreign and non-aristocratic students into the Gymnasium and universities.\nConditions improved slightly after the death of Peter II in 1730 and the German-influenced Anna of Russia assumed power. Euler swiftly rose through the ranks in the academy and was made a professor of physics in 1731. He also left the Russian Navy, refusing a promotion to lieutenant. Two years later, Daniel Bernoulli, fed up with the censorship and hostility he faced at Saint Petersburg, left for Basel. Euler succeeded him as the head of the mathematics department. In January 1734, he married Katharina Gsell (1707\u20131773), a daughter of Georg Gsell. Frederick II had made an attempt to recruit the services of Euler for his newly established Berlin Academy in 1740, but Euler initially preferred to stay in St Petersburg. But after Empress Anna died and Frederick II agreed to pay 1600 ecus (the same as Euler earned in Russia) he agreed to move to Berlin. In 1741, he requested permission to leave for Berlin, arguing he was in need of a milder climate for his eyesight. The Russian academy gave its consent and would pay him 200 rubles per year as one of its active members.\nBerlin period (1741\u20131766).\nConcerned about the continuing turmoil in Russia, Euler left St. Petersburg in June 1741 to take up a post at the Berlin Academy, which he had been offered by Frederick the Great of Prussia. He lived for 25 years in Berlin, where he wrote several hundred articles. In 1748 his text on functions called the \"Introductio in analysin infinitorum\" was published and in 1755 a text on differential calculus called the \"Institutiones calculi differentialis\" was published. In 1755, he was elected a foreign member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences and of the French Academy of Sciences. Notable students of Euler in Berlin included Stepan Rumovsky, later considered as the first Russian astronomer. In 1748 he declined an offer from the University of Basel to succeed the recently deceased Johann Bernoulli. In 1753 he bought a house in Charlottenburg, in which he lived with his family and widowed mother.\nEuler became the tutor for Friederike Charlotte of Brandenburg-Schwedt, the Princess of Anhalt-Dessau and Frederick's niece. He wrote over 200 letters to her in the early 1760s, which were later compiled into a volume entitled \"Letters of Euler on different Subjects in Natural Philosophy Addressed to a German Princess\". This work contained Euler's exposition on various subjects pertaining to physics and mathematics and offered valuable insights into Euler's personality and religious beliefs. It was translated into multiple languages, published across Europe and in the United States, and became more widely read than any of his mathematical works. The popularity of the \"Letters\" testifies to Euler's ability to communicate scientific matters effectively to a lay audience, a rare ability for a dedicated research scientist.\nDespite Euler's immense contribution to the academy's prestige and having been put forward as a candidate for its presidency by Jean le Rond d'Alembert, Frederick II named himself as its president. The Prussian king had a large circle of intellectuals in his court, and he found the mathematician unsophisticated and ill-informed on matters beyond numbers and figures. Euler was a simple, devoutly religious man who never questioned the existing social order or conventional beliefs. He was, in many ways, the polar opposite of Voltaire, who enjoyed a high place of prestige at Frederick's court. Euler was not a skilled debater and often made it a point to argue subjects that he knew little about, making him the frequent target of Voltaire's wit. Frederick also expressed disappointment with Euler's practical engineering abilities, stating:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nHowever, the disappointment was almost surely unwarranted from a technical perspective. Euler's calculations look likely to be correct, even if Euler's interactions with Frederick and those constructing his fountain may have been dysfunctional.\nThroughout his stay in Berlin, Euler maintained a strong connection to the academy in St. Petersburg and also published 109 papers in Russia. He also assisted students from the St. Petersburg academy and at times accommodated Russian students in his house in Berlin. In 1760, with the Seven Years' War raging, Euler's farm in Charlottenburg was sacked by advancing Russian troops. Upon learning of this event, General Ivan Petrovich Saltykov paid compensation for the damage caused to Euler's estate, with Empress Elizabeth of Russia later adding a further payment of 4000 rubles\u2014an exorbitant amount at the time. Euler decided to leave Berlin in 1766 and return to Russia.\nDuring his Berlin years (1741\u20131766), Euler was at the peak of his productivity. He wrote 380 works, 275 of which were published. This included 125 memoirs in the Berlin Academy and over 100 memoirs sent to the St. Petersburg Academy, which had retained him as a member and paid him an annual stipend. Euler's \"Introductio in Analysin Infinitorum\" was published in two parts in 1748. In addition to his own research, Euler supervised the library, the observatory, the botanical garden, and the publication of calendars and maps from which the academy derived income. He was even involved in the design of the water fountains at Sanssouci, the King's summer palace.\nSecond Saint Petersburg period (1766\u20131783).\nThe political situation in Russia stabilized after Catherine the Great's accession to the throne, so in 1766 Euler accepted an invitation to return to the St. Petersburg Academy. His conditions were quite exorbitant\u2014a 3000 ruble annual salary, a pension for his wife, and the promise of high-ranking appointments for his sons. At the university he was assisted by his student Anders Johan Lexell. While living in St. Petersburg, a fire in 1771 destroyed his home.\nPersonal life.\nOn 7 January 1734, Euler married Katharina Gsell, daughter of Georg Gsell, a painter at the Academy Gymnasium in Saint Petersburg. The couple bought a house by the Neva River.\nOf their 13 children, five survived childhood, three sons and two daughters. Their first son was Johann Albrecht Euler, whose godfather was Christian Goldbach.\nThree years after his wife's death in 1773, Euler married her half-sister, Salome Abigail Gsell. This marriage lasted until his death in 1783.\nHis brother Johann Heinrich settled in St. Petersburg in 1735 and was employed as a painter at the academy.\nEarly in his life, Euler memorized Virgil's \"Aeneid\", and by old age, he could recite the poem and give the first and last sentence on each page of the edition from which he had learnt it. Euler knew the first hundred prime numbers and could give each of their powers up to the sixth degree. \nEuler was known as a generous and kind person, not neurotic as seen in some geniuses, keeping his good-natured disposition even after becoming entirely blind.\nEyesight deterioration.\nEuler's eyesight worsened throughout his mathematical career. In 1738, three years after nearly dying of fever, he became almost blind in his right eye. Euler blamed the cartography he performed for the St. Petersburg Academy for his condition, but the cause of his blindness remains the subject of speculation. Euler's vision in that eye worsened throughout his stay in Germany, to the extent that Frederick called him \"Cyclops\". Euler said of his loss of vision, \"Now I will have fewer distractions.\" In 1766 a cataract in his left eye was discovered. Though couching of the cataract temporarily improved his vision, complications rendered him almost totally blind in the left eye as well. His condition appeared to have little effect on his productivity. With the aid of his scribes, Euler's productivity in many areas of study increased; in 1775, he produced, on average, one mathematical paper per week.\nDeath.\nIn St. Petersburg on 18 September 1783, after a lunch with his family, Euler was discussing the newly discovered planet Uranus and its orbit with Anders Johan Lexell when he collapsed and died of a brain hemorrhage. Jacob von Staehlin wrote a short obituary for the Russian Academy of Sciences and Russian mathematician Nicolas Fuss, one of Euler's disciples, wrote a more detailed eulogy, which he delivered at a memorial meeting. In his eulogy for the French Academy, French mathematician and philosopher Marquis de Condorcet wrote:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nEuler was buried next to Katharina at the Smolensk Lutheran Cemetery on Vasilievsky Island. In 1837, the Russian Academy of Sciences installed a new monument, replacing his overgrown grave plaque. In 1957, to commemorate the 250th anniversary of his birth, his tomb was moved to the Lazarevskoe Cemetery at the Alexander Nevsky Monastery.\nContributions to science.\nEuler worked in almost all areas of mathematics, including geometry, infinitesimal calculus, trigonometry, algebra, and number theory, as well as continuum physics, lunar theory, and other areas of physics. He is a seminal figure in the history of mathematics; if printed, his works, many of which are of fundamental interest, would occupy between 60 and 80 quarto volumes. Euler's name is associated with a large number of topics. Euler's work averages 800 pages a year from 1725 to 1783. He also wrote over 4500 letters and hundreds of manuscripts. It has been estimated that Leonhard Euler was the author of a quarter of the combined output in mathematics, physics, mechanics, astronomy, and navigation in the 18th century, while other researchers credit Euler for a third of the output in mathematics in that century.\nMathematical notation.\nEuler introduced and popularized several notational conventions through his numerous and widely circulated textbooks. Most notably, he introduced the concept of a function and was the first to write \"f\"(\"x\") to denote the function \"f\" applied to the argument \"x\". He also introduced the modern notation for the trigonometric functions, the letter \"e\" for the base of the natural logarithm (now also known as Euler's number), the Greek letter \u03a3 for summations and the letter \"i\" to denote the imaginary unit. The use of the Greek letter \"\u03c0\" to denote the ratio of a circle's circumference to its diameter was also popularized by Euler, although it originated with Welsh mathematician William Jones.\nAnalysis.\nThe development of infinitesimal calculus was at the forefront of 18th-century mathematical research, and the Bernoullis\u2014family friends of Euler\u2014were responsible for much of the early progress in the field. Thanks to their influence, studying calculus became the major focus of Euler's work. While some of Euler's proofs are not acceptable by modern standards of mathematical rigour (in particular his reliance on the principle of the generality of algebra), his ideas led to many great advances.\nEuler is well known in analysis for his frequent use and development of power series, the expression of functions as sums of infinitely many terms, such as\nformula_8\nEuler's use of power series enabled him to solve the Basel problem, finding the sum of the reciprocals of squares of every natural number, in 1735 (he provided a more elaborate argument in 1741). The Basel problem was originally posed by Pietro Mengoli in 1644, and by the 1730s was a famous open problem, popularized by Jacob Bernoulli and unsuccessfully attacked by many of the leading mathematicians of the time. Euler found that:\nformula_9\nEuler introduced the constant\nformula_10\nnow known as Euler's constant or the Euler\u2013Mascheroni constant, and studied its relationship with the harmonic series, the gamma function, and values of the Riemann zeta function.\nEuler introduced the use of the exponential function and logarithms in analytic proofs. He discovered ways to express various logarithmic functions using power series, and he successfully defined logarithms for negative and complex numbers, thus greatly expanding the scope of mathematical applications of logarithms. He also defined the exponential function for complex numbers and discovered its relation to the trigonometric functions. For any real number \u03c6 (taken to be radians), Euler's formula states that the complex exponential function satisfies\nformula_11\nwhich was called \"the most remarkable formula in mathematics\" by Richard Feynman.\nA special case of the above formula is known as Euler's identity,\nformula_12\nEuler elaborated the theory of higher transcendental functions by introducing the gamma function and introduced a new method for solving quartic equations. He found a way to calculate integrals with complex limits, foreshadowing the development of modern complex analysis. He invented the calculus of variations and formulated the Euler\u2013Lagrange equation for reducing optimization problems in this area to the solution of differential equations.\nEuler pioneered the use of analytic methods to solve number theory problems. In doing so, he united two disparate branches of mathematics and introduced a new field of study, analytic number theory. In breaking ground for this new field, Euler created the theory of hypergeometric series, q-series, hyperbolic trigonometric functions, and the analytic theory of continued fractions. For example, he proved the infinitude of primes using the divergence of the harmonic series, and he used analytic methods to gain some understanding of the way prime numbers are distributed. Euler's work in this area led to the development of the prime number theorem.\nNumber theory.\nEuler's interest in number theory can be traced to the influence of Christian Goldbach, his friend in the St. Petersburg Academy. Much of Euler's early work on number theory was based on the work of Pierre de Fermat. Euler developed some of Fermat's ideas and disproved some of his conjectures, such as his conjecture that all numbers of the form formula_13 (Fermat numbers) are prime.\nEuler linked the nature of prime distribution with ideas in analysis. He proved that the sum of the reciprocals of the primes diverges. In doing so, he discovered the connection between the Riemann zeta function and prime numbers; this is known as the Euler product formula for the Riemann zeta function.\nEuler invented the totient function \u03c6(\"n\"), the number of positive integers less than or equal to the integer \"n\" that are coprime to \"n\". Using properties of this function, he generalized Fermat's little theorem to what is now known as Euler's theorem. He contributed significantly to the theory of perfect numbers, which had fascinated mathematicians since Euclid. He proved that the relationship shown between even perfect numbers and Mersenne primes (which he had earlier proved) was one-to-one, a result otherwise known as the Euclid\u2013Euler theorem. Euler also conjectured the law of quadratic reciprocity. The concept is regarded as a fundamental theorem within number theory, and his ideas paved the way for the work of Carl Friedrich Gauss, particularly \"Disquisitiones Arithmeticae\". By 1772 Euler had proved that 231\u00a0\u2212\u00a01 = 2,147,483,647 is a Mersenne prime. It may have remained the largest known prime until 1867.\nEuler also contributed major developments to the theory of partitions of an integer.\nGraph theory.\nIn 1735, Euler presented a solution to the problem known as the Seven Bridges of K\u00f6nigsberg. The city of K\u00f6nigsberg, Prussia was set on the Pregel River, and included two large islands that were connected to each other and the mainland by seven bridges. The problem is to decide whether it is possible to follow a path that crosses each bridge exactly once. Euler showed that it is not possible: there is no Eulerian path. This solution is considered to be the first theorem of graph theory.\nEuler also discovered the formula formula_14 relating the number of vertices, edges, and faces of a convex polyhedron, and hence of a planar graph. The constant in this formula is now known as the Euler characteristic for the graph (or other mathematical object), and is related to the genus of the object. The study and generalization of this formula, specifically by Cauchy and L'Huilier, is at the origin of topology.\nPhysics, astronomy, and engineering.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Hlist/styles.css\"/&gt;\nSome of Euler's greatest successes were in solving real-world problems analytically, and in describing numerous applications of the Bernoulli numbers, Fourier series, Euler numbers, the constants e and \u03c0, continued fractions, and integrals. He integrated Leibniz's differential calculus with Newton's Method of Fluxions, and developed tools that made it easier to apply calculus to physical problems. He made great strides in improving the numerical approximation of integrals, inventing what are now known as the Euler approximations. The most notable of these approximations are Euler's method and the Euler\u2013Maclaurin formula.\nEuler helped develop the Euler\u2013Bernoulli beam equation, which became a cornerstone of engineering. Besides successfully applying his analytic tools to problems in classical mechanics, Euler applied these techniques to celestial problems. His work in astronomy was recognized by multiple Paris Academy Prizes over the course of his career. His accomplishments include determining with great accuracy the orbits of comets and other celestial bodies, understanding the nature of comets, and calculating the parallax of the Sun. His calculations contributed to the development of accurate longitude tables.\nEuler made important contributions in optics. He disagreed with Newton's corpuscular theory of light, which was the prevailing theory of the time. His 1740s papers on optics helped ensure that the wave theory of light proposed by Christiaan Huygens would become the dominant mode of thought, at least until the development of the quantum theory of light.\nIn fluid dynamics, Euler was the first to predict the phenomenon of cavitation, in 1754, long before its first observation in the late 19th century, and the Euler number used in fluid flow calculations comes from his related work on the efficiency of turbines. In 1757 he published an important set of equations for inviscid flow in fluid dynamics, that are now known as the Euler equations.\nEuler is well known in structural engineering for his formula giving Euler's critical load, the critical buckling load of an ideal strut, which depends only on its length and flexural stiffness.\nLogic.\nEuler is credited with using closed curves to illustrate syllogistic reasoning (1768). These diagrams have become known as Euler diagrams.\nAn Euler diagram is a diagrammatic means of representing sets and their relationships. Euler diagrams consist of simple closed curves (usually circles) in the plane that depict sets. Each Euler curve divides the plane into two regions or \"zones\": the interior, which symbolically represents the elements of the set, and the exterior, which represents all elements that are not members of the set. The sizes or shapes of the curves are not important; the significance of the diagram is in how they overlap. The spatial relationships between the regions bounded by each curve (overlap, containment or neither) corresponds to set-theoretic relationships (intersection, subset, and disjointness). Curves whose interior zones do not intersect represent disjoint sets. Two curves whose interior zones intersect represent sets that have common elements; the zone inside both curves represents the set of elements common to both sets (the intersection of the sets). A curve that is contained completely within the interior zone of another represents a subset of it.\nEuler diagrams (and their refinement to Venn diagrams) were incorporated as part of instruction in set theory as part of the new math movement in the 1960s. Since then, they have come into wide use as a way of visualizing combinations of characteristics.\nDemography.\nIn his 1760 paper \"A General Investigation into the Mortality and Multiplication of the Human Species\" Euler produced a model which showed how a population with constant fertility and mortality might grow geometrically using a difference equation. Under this geometric growth Euler also examined relationships among various demographic indices showing how they might be used to produce estimates when observations were missing. Three papers published around 150 years later by Alfred J. Lotka (1907, 1911 (with F.R. Sharpe) and 1922) adopted a similar approach to Euler's and produced their Stable Population Model. These marked the start of 20th century formal demographic modelling.\nMusic.\nOne of Euler's more unusual interests was the application of mathematical ideas in music. In 1739 he wrote the \"Tentamen novae theoriae musicae\" (\"Attempt at a New Theory of Music\"), hoping to eventually incorporate musical theory as part of mathematics. This part of his work, however, did not receive wide attention and was once described as too mathematical for musicians and too musical for mathematicians. Even when dealing with music, Euler's approach is mainly mathematical, for instance, his introduction of binary logarithms as a way of numerically describing the subdivision of octaves into fractional parts. His writings on music are not particularly numerous (a few hundred pages, in his total production of about thirty thousand pages), but they reflect an early preoccupation and one that remained with him throughout his life.\nA first point of Euler's musical theory is the definition of \"genres\", i.e. of possible divisions of the octave using the prime numbers 3 and 5. Euler describes 18 such genres, with the general definition 2mA, where A is the \"exponent\" of the genre (i.e. the sum of the exponents of 3 and 5) and 2m (where \"m is an indefinite number, small or large, so long as the sounds are perceptible\"), expresses that the relation holds independently of the number of octaves concerned. The first genre, with A = 1, is the octave itself (or its duplicates); the second genre, 2m.3, is the octave divided by the fifth (fifth + fourth, C\u2013G\u2013C); the third genre is 2m.5, major third + minor sixth (C\u2013E\u2013C); the fourth is 2m.32, two-fourths and a tone (C\u2013F\u2013B\u266d\u2013C); the fifth is 2m.3.5 (C\u2013E\u2013G\u2013B\u2013C); etc. Genres 12 (2m.33.5), 13 (2m.32.52) and 14 (2m.3.53) are corrected versions of the diatonic, chromatic and enharmonic, respectively, of the Ancients. Genre 18 (2m.33.52) is the \"diatonico-chromatic\", \"used generally in all compositions\", and which turns out to be identical with the system described by Johann Mattheson. Euler later envisaged the possibility of describing genres including the prime number 7.\nEuler devised a specific graph, the \"Speculum musicum\", to illustrate the diatonico-chromatic genre, and discussed paths in this graph for specific intervals, recalling his interest in the Seven Bridges of K\u00f6nigsberg (see above). The device drew renewed interest as the Tonnetz in Neo-Riemannian theory (see also Lattice (music)).\nEuler further used the principle of the \"exponent\" to propose a derivation of the \"gradus suavitatis\" (degree of suavity, of agreeableness) of intervals and chords from their prime factors \u2013 one must keep in mind that he considered just intonation, i.e. 1 and only the prime numbers 3 and 5. Formulas have been proposed extending this system to any number of prime numbers, e.g. in the form\nformula_15\nwhere \"p\"\"i\" are prime numbers and \"k\"\"i\" their exponents.\nPersonal philosophy and religious beliefs.\nEuler was religious throughout his life. Much of what is known of his religious beliefs can be deduced from his \"Letters to a German Princess\" and an earlier work, \"Rettung der G\u00f6ttlichen Offenbahrung gegen die Einw\u00fcrfe der Freygeister\" (\"Defense of the Divine Revelation against the Objections of the Freethinkers\"). These show that Euler was a devout Christian who believed the Bible to be inspired; the \"Rettung\" was primarily an argument for the divine inspiration of scripture.\nEuler opposed the concepts of Leibniz's monadism and the philosophy of Christian Wolff. He insisted that knowledge is founded in part on the basis of precise quantitative laws, something that monadism and Wolffian science were unable to provide. Euler called Wolff's ideas \"heathen and atheistic\".\nThere is a legend inspired by Euler's arguments with secular philosophers over religion, which is set during Euler's second stint at the St. Petersburg Academy. The French philosopher Denis Diderot was visiting Russia on Catherine the Great's invitation. The Empress was alarmed that Diderot's arguments for atheism were influencing members of her court, and so Euler was asked to confront him. Diderot was informed that a learned mathematician had produced a proof of the existence of God: he agreed to view the proof as it was presented in court. Euler appeared, advanced toward Diderot, and in a tone of perfect conviction announced this non sequitur:\n\"Sir, formula_16, hence God exists \u2013reply!\"\nDiderot, to whom (says the story) all mathematics was gibberish, stood dumbstruck as peals of laughter erupted from the court. Embarrassed, he asked to leave Russia, a request Catherine granted. However amusing the anecdote may be, it is apocryphal, given that Diderot himself did research in mathematics.\nThe legend was apparently first told by Dieudonn\u00e9 Thi\u00e9bault with embellishment by Augustus De Morgan.\nLegacy.\nRecognition.\nEuler is widely recognized as one of the greatest mathematicians of all time, and more likely than not the most prolific contributor to mathematics and science. Mathematician and physicist John von Neumann called Euler \"the greatest virtuoso of the period\". Mathematician Fran\u00e7ois Arago said, \"Euler calculated without any apparent effort, just as men breathe and as eagles sustain themselves in air\". He is generally ranked right below Carl Friedrich Gauss, Isaac Newton, and Archimedes among the greatest mathematicians of all time, while some rank him as equal with them. Physicist and mathematician Henri Poincar\u00e9 called Euler the \"god of mathematics\". \nFrench mathematician Andr\u00e9 Weil noted that Euler stood above his contemporaries and more than anyone else was able to cement himself as the leading force of his era's mathematics:&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;No mathematician ever attained such a position of undisputed leadership in all branches of mathematics, pure and applied, as Euler did for the best part of the eighteenth century.Swiss mathematician Nicolas Fuss noted Euler's extraordinary memory and breadth of knowledge, saying:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Knowledge that we call erudition was not inimical to him. He had read all the best Roman writers, knew perfectly the ancient history of mathematics, held in his memory the historical events of all times and peoples, and could without hesitation adduce by way of examples the most trifling of historical events. He knew more about medicine, botany, and chemistry than might be expected of someone who had not worked especially in those sciences.\nCommemorations.\nEuler was featured on both the sixth and seventh series of the Swiss 10-franc banknote and on numerous Swiss, German, and Russian postage stamps. In 1782 he was elected a Foreign Honorary Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. The asteroid 2002 Euler was named in his honour.\nSelected bibliography.\nEuler has an extensive bibliography. His books include:\nIt took until 1830 for the bulk of Euler's posthumous works to be individually published, with an additional batch of 61 unpublished works discovered by Paul Heinrich von Fuss (Euler's great-grandson and Nicolas Fuss's son) and published as a collection in 1862. A chronological catalog of Euler's works was compiled by Swedish mathematician Gustaf Enestr\u00f6m and published from 1910 to 1913. The catalog, known as the Enestr\u00f6m index, numbers Euler's works from E1 to E866. The Euler Archive was started at Dartmouth College before moving to the Mathematical Association of America and, most recently, to University of the Pacific in 2017.\nIn 1907, the Swiss Academy of Sciences created the Euler Commission and charged it with the publication of Euler's complete works. After several delays in the 19th century, the first volume of the \"Opera Omnia\", was published in 1911. However, the discovery of new manuscripts continued to increase the magnitude of this project. Fortunately, the publication of Euler's Opera Omnia has made steady progress, with over 70 volumes (averaging 426 pages each) published by 2006 and 80 volumes published by 2022. These volumes are organized into four series. The first series compiles the works on analysis, algebra, and number theory; it consists of 29 volumes and numbers over 14,000 pages. The 31 volumes of Series II, amounting to 10,660 pages, contain the works on mechanics, astronomy, and engineering. Series III contains 12 volumes on physics. Series IV, which contains the massive amount of Euler's correspondence, unpublished manuscripts, and notes only began compilation in 1967. After publishing 8 print volumes in Series IV, the project decided in 2022 to publish its remaining projected volumes in Series IV in online format only.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The most common occurrence is in connection with regression models and the term is often taken as synonymous with linear regression model. However, the term is also used in time series analysis with a different meaning. In each case, the designation \"linear\" is used to identify a subclass of models for which substantial reduction in the complexity of the related statistical theory is possible.\nLinear regression models.\nFor the regression case, the statistical model is as follows. Given a (random) sample formula_1 the relation between the observations formula_2 and the independent variables formula_3 is formulated as\nformula_4\nwhere formula_5 may be nonlinear functions. In the above, the quantities formula_6 are random variables representing errors in the relationship. The \"linear\" part of the designation relates to the appearance of the regression coefficients, formula_7 in a linear way in the above relationship. Alternatively, one may say that the predicted values corresponding to the above model, namely\nformula_8\nare linear functions of the formula_7.\nGiven that estimation is undertaken on the basis of a least squares analysis, estimates of the unknown parameters formula_7 are determined by minimising a sum of squares function\nformula_11\nFrom this, it can readily be seen that the \"linear\" aspect of the model means the following:\n*the function to be minimised is a quadratic function of the formula_7 for which minimisation is a relatively simple problem;\n*the derivatives of the function are linear functions of the formula_7 making it easy to find the minimising values;\n*the minimising values formula_7 are linear functions of the observations formula_2;\n*the minimising values formula_7 are linear functions of the random errors formula_6 which makes it relatively easy to determine the statistical properties of the estimated values of formula_7.\nTime series models.\nAn example of a linear time series model is an autoregressive moving average model. Here the model for values {formula_19} in a time series can be written in the form\nformula_20\nwhere again the quantities formula_6 are random variables representing innovations which are new random effects that appear at a certain time but also affect values of formula_22 at later times. In this instance the use of the term \"linear model\" refers to the structure of the above relationship in representing formula_19 as a linear function of past values of the same time series and of current and past values of the innovations. This particular aspect of the structure means that it is relatively simple to derive relations for the mean and covariance properties of the time series. Note that here the \"linear\" part of the term \"linear model\" is not referring to the coefficients formula_24 and formula_25, as it would be in the case of a regression model, which looks structurally similar.\nOther uses in statistics.\nThere are some other instances where \"nonlinear model\" is used to contrast with a linearly structured model, although the term \"linear model\" is not usually applied. One example of this is nonlinear dimensionality reduction.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "17905", "revid": "27015025", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=17905", "title": "Likelihood principle", "text": "Proposition in statistics\nIn statistics, the likelihood principle is the proposition that, given a statistical model, all the evidence in a sample relevant to model parameters is contained in the likelihood function.\nA likelihood function arises from a probability density function considered as a function of its distributional parameterization argument. For example, consider a model which gives the probability density function formula_1 of observable random variable formula_2 as a function of a parameter\u00a0formula_3. Then for a specific value formula_4 of formula_5, the function formula_6 is a likelihood function of\u00a0formula_3: it gives a measure of how \"likely\" any particular value of formula_8 is, if we know that formula_9 has the value\u00a0formula_10. The density function may be a density with respect to counting measure, i.e. a probability mass function.\nTwo likelihood functions are \"equivalent\" if one is a scalar multiple of the other.\nThe likelihood principle is this: All information from the data that is relevant to inferences about the value of the model parameters is in the equivalence class to which the likelihood function belongs. The strong likelihood principle applies this same criterion to cases such as sequential experiments where the sample of data that is available results from applying a stopping rule to the observations earlier in the experiment.\nExample.\nSuppose\nThen the observation that formula_16 induces the likelihood function\nformula_17\nwhile the observation that formula_18 induces the likelihood function\nformula_19\nThe likelihood principle says that, as the data are the same in both cases, the inferences drawn about the value of formula_12 should also be the same. In addition, all the inferential content in the data about the value of formula_12 is contained in the two likelihoods, and is the same if they are proportional to one another. This is the case in the above example, reflecting the fact that the difference between observing formula_16 and observing formula_18 lies not in the actual data collected, nor in the conduct of the experimenter, but in the two different designs of the experiment.\nSpecifically, in one case, the decision in advance was to try twelve times, regardless of the outcome; in the other case, the advance decision was to keep trying until three successes were observed. \"If you support the likelihood principle\" then inference about formula_12 should be the same for both cases because the two likelihoods are proportional to each other: Except for a constant leading factor of 220 vs. 55, the two likelihood functions are the same \u2013 constant multiples of each other.\nThis equivalence is not always the case, however. The use of frequentist methods involving leads to different inferences for the two cases above,\nshowing that the outcome of frequentist methods depends on the experimental procedure, and thus violates the likelihood principle.\nThe law of likelihood.\nA related concept is the law of likelihood, the notion that the extent to which the evidence supports one parameter value or hypothesis against another is indicated by the ratio of their likelihoods, their likelihood ratio. That is,\nformula_25\nis the degree to which the observation x supports parameter value or hypothesis a against b. If this ratio is 1, the evidence is indifferent; if greater than 1, the evidence supports the value a against b; or if less, then vice versa.\nIn Bayesian statistics, this ratio is known as the Bayes factor, and Bayes' rule can be seen as the application of the law of likelihood to inference.\nIn frequentist inference, the likelihood ratio is used in the likelihood-ratio test, but other non-likelihood tests are used as well. The Neyman\u2013Pearson lemma states the likelihood-ratio test is equally statistically powerful as the most powerful test for comparing two simple hypotheses at a given significance level, which gives a frequentist justification for the law of likelihood.\nCombining the likelihood principle with the law of likelihood yields the consequence that the parameter value which maximizes the likelihood function is the value which is most strongly supported by the evidence. This is the basis for the widely used method of maximum likelihood.\nHistory.\nThe likelihood principle was first identified by that name in print in 1962 (Barnard \"et al\"., Birnbaum, and Savage \"et al\".), but arguments for the same principle, unnamed, and the use of the principle in applications goes back to the works of R.A. Fisher in the 1920s. The law of likelihood was identified by that name by I. Hacking (1965). More recently the likelihood principle as a general principle of inference has been championed by A.W.F. Edwards. The likelihood principle has been applied to the philosophy of science by R. Royall.\nBirnbaum (1962) initially argued that the likelihood principle follows from two more primitive and seemingly reasonable principles, the \"conditionality principle\" and the \"sufficiency principle\":\nHowever, upon further consideration Birnbaum rejected both his conditionality principle and the likelihood principle. The adequacy of Birnbaum's original argument has also been contested by others (\"see below for details\").\nArguments for and against.\nSome widely used methods of conventional statistics, for example many significance tests, are not consistent with the likelihood principle.\nLet us briefly consider some of the arguments for and against the likelihood principle.\nThe original Birnbaum argument.\nAccording to Giere (1977), Birnbaum rejected both his own conditionality principle and the likelihood principle because they were both incompatible with what he called the \u201cconfidence concept of statistical evidence\u201d, which Birnbaum (1970) describes as taking \u201cfrom the Neyman-Pearson approach techniques for systematically appraising and bounding the probabilities (under respective hypotheses) of seriously misleading interpretations of data\u201d ( p.\u00a01033). The confidence concept incorporates only limited aspects of the likelihood concept and only some applications of the conditionality concept. Birnbaum later notes that it was the unqualified equivalence formulation of his 1962 version of the conditionality principle that led \u201cto the monster of the likelihood axiom\u201d ( p.\u00a0263).\nBirnbaum's original argument for the likelihood principle has also been disputed by other statisticians including Akaike, Evans and philosophers of science, including Deborah Mayo. Dawid points out fundamental differences between Mayo's and Birnbaum's definitions of the conditionality principle, arguing Birnbaum's argument cannot be so readily dismissed. A new proof of the likelihood principle has been provided by Gandenberger that addresses some of the counterarguments to the original proof.\nExperimental design arguments on the likelihood principle.\nUnrealized events play a role in some common statistical methods. For example, the result of a significance test depends on the p-value, the probability of a result as extreme or more extreme than the observation, and that probability may depend on the design of the experiment. To the extent that the likelihood principle is accepted, such methods are therefore denied.\nSome classical significance tests are not based on the likelihood. The following are a simple and more complicated example of those, using a commonly cited example called \"the optional stopping problem\".\nSuppose I tell you that I tossed a coin 12\u00a0times and in the process observed 3\u00a0heads. You might make some inference about the probability of heads and whether the coin was fair.\nSuppose now I tell that I tossed the coin \"until\" I observed 3\u00a0heads, and I tossed it 12\u00a0times. Will you now make some different inference?\nThe likelihood function is the same in both cases: It is proportional to\nformula_34.\nSo according to the \"likelihood principle\", in either case the inference should be the same.\nSuppose a number of scientists are assessing the probability of a certain outcome (which we shall call 'success') in experimental trials. Conventional wisdom suggests that if there is no bias towards success or failure then the success probability would be one half. Adam, a scientist, conducted 12\u00a0trials and obtains 3\u00a0successes and 9\u00a0failures. One of those successes was the 12th and last observation. Then Adam left the lab.\nBill, a colleague in the same lab, continued Adam's work and published Adam's results, along with a significance test. He tested the null hypothesis that p, the success probability, is equal to a half, versus \"p\" &lt; 0.5\u00a0. If we ignore the information that the third success was the 12th and last observation, the probability of the observed result that out of 12\u00a0trials 3 or something fewer (i.e. more extreme) were successes, if H0 is true, is\nformula_35,\nwhich is \n 7.3%\u00a0. Thus the null hypothesis is not rejected at the 5% significance level if we ignore the knowledge that the third success was the 12th result.\nHowever observe that this first calculation also includes 12 token long sequences that end in tails contrary to the problem statement!\nIf we redo this calculation we realize the likelihood according to the null hypothesis must be the probability of a fair coin landing 2 or fewer heads on 11 trials multiplied with the probability of the fair coin landing a head for the 12th trial:\nformula_36,\nwhich is \n 1.64%\u00a0. Now the result \"is\" statistically significant at the 5% level.\nCharlotte, another scientist, reads Bill's paper and writes a letter, saying that it is possible that Adam kept trying until he obtained 3\u00a0successes, in which case the probability of needing to conduct 12 or more experiments is given by\nformula_36,\nwhich is \n 1.64%\u00a0. Now the result \"is\" statistically significant at the 5% level. Note that there is no contradiction between the latter two correct analyses; both computations are correct, and result in the same p-value.\nTo these scientists, whether a result is significant or not does not depend on the design of the experiment, but does on the likelihood (in the sense of the likelihood function) of the parameter value being\u00a0\u00a0.\nResults of this kind are considered by some as arguments against the likelihood principle. For others it exemplifies the value of the likelihood principle and is an argument against significance tests.\nSimilar themes appear when comparing Fisher's exact test with Pearson's chi-squared test.\nThe voltmeter story.\nAn argument in favor of the likelihood principle is given by Edwards in his book \"Likelihood\". He cites the following story from J.W.\u00a0Pratt, slightly condensed here. Note that the likelihood function depends only on what actually happened, and not on what \"could\" have happened.\n An engineer draws a random sample of electron tubes and measures their voltages. The measurements range from 75 to 99\u00a0Volts. A statistician computes the sample mean and a confidence interval for the true mean. Later the statistician discovers that the voltmeter reads only as far as 100\u00a0Volts, so technically, the population appears to be \u201c\"censored\"\u201d. If the statistician is orthodox this necessitates a new analysis.\n However, the engineer says he has another meter reading to 1000\u00a0Volts, which he would have used if any voltage had been over 100. This is a relief to the statistician, because it means the population was effectively uncensored after all. But later, the statistician discovers that the second meter had not been working when the measurements were taken. The engineer informs the statistician that he would not have held up the original measurements until the second meter was fixed, and the statistician informs him that new measurements are required. The engineer is astounded. \u201c\"Next you'll be asking about my oscilloscope!\"\u201d\nThis story can be translated to Adam's stopping rule above, as follows: Adam stopped immediately after 3\u00a0successes, because his boss Bill had instructed him to do so. After the publication of the statistical analysis by Bill, Adam realizes that he has missed a later instruction from Bill to instead conduct 12\u00a0trials, and that Bill's paper is based on this second instruction. Adam is very glad that he got his 3\u00a0successes after exactly 12\u00a0trials, and explains to his friend Charlotte that by coincidence he executed the second instruction. Later, Adam is astonished to hear about Charlotte's letter, explaining that \"now\" the result is significant.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nExternal links.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "17909", "revid": "46085058", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=17909", "title": "Led Zeppelin", "text": "English rock band (1968\u20131980)\nLed Zeppelin were an English rock band formed in London in 1968. The band comprised vocalist Robert Plant, guitarist Jimmy Page, bassist-keyboardist John Paul Jones and drummer John Bonham. With a heavy, guitar-driven sound and drawing from influences including blues and folk music, Led Zeppelin are cited as a progenitor of hard rock and heavy metal. Among the best-selling music artists of all time, they influenced the music industry, particularly in the development of album-oriented rock and stadium rock.\nLed Zeppelin evolved from a previous band, the Yardbirds, and were originally named \"the New Yardbirds\". They signed a deal with Atlantic Records that gave them considerable artistic freedom. Initially unpopular with critics, they achieved all-but-unmatched commercial success with eight studio albums over ten years. Their 1969 debut, \"Led Zeppelin\", was a top-ten album in several countries and features such tracks as \"Good Times Bad Times\", \"Dazed and Confused\" and \"Communication Breakdown\". \"Led Zeppelin II\" (1969), their first number-one album, includes \"Whole Lotta Love\" and \"Ramble On\". In 1970, they released \"Led Zeppelin III\" which opens with \"Immigrant Song\". Their untitled fourth album, commonly known as \"Led Zeppelin IV\" (1971), is one of the best-selling albums in history, with 37 million copies sold. It includes \"Black Dog\", \"Rock and Roll\" and \"Stairway to Heaven\", with the latter being among the most popular and influential works in rock. \"Houses of the Holy\" (1973) includes \"The Song Remains the Same\" and \"The Rain Song\". \"Physical Graffiti\" (1975), a double album, features \"Trampled Under Foot\" and \"Kashmir\".\nPage composed most of Led Zeppelin's music, while Plant wrote most of the lyrics. Jones occasionally contributed keyboard-focused parts, particularly on the band's final album. The latter half of their career saw a series of record-breaking tours that earned the group a reputation for excess and debauchery. Although they remained commercially and critically successful, their touring and output, which included \"Presence\" (1976) and \"In Through the Out Door\" (1979), declined in the late 1970s. After Bonham's death in 1980, the group disbanded. The three surviving members have sporadically collaborated and participated in one-off concerts, including the 2007 Ahmet Ertegun Tribute Concert in London, with Bonham's son Jason Bonham on drums.\nLed Zeppelin have sold an estimated 200 to 300\u00a0million records worldwide. They achieved eight consecutive UK number-one albums and six number-one albums on the US \"Billboard\" 200, with five of their albums certified Diamond in the US by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). \"Rolling Stone\" described them as \"the heaviest band of all time\", \"the biggest band of the seventies\", and \"unquestionably one of the most enduring bands in rock history\". They were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1995; the museum's biography states that they were \"as influential\" in the 1970s as the Beatles were in the 1960s.\nHistory.\nFormation: 1966\u20131968.\nIn 1966, London-based session guitarist Jimmy Page joined the blues-influenced rock band the Yardbirds to replace bassist Paul Samwell-Smith. Page soon switched from bass to lead guitar, creating a dual lead guitar line-up with Jeff Beck. Following Beck's departure in October 1966, the Yardbirds became a four-piece with Page as the sole guitarist. This new line-up recorded an album, \"Little Games\", in 1967, before embarking on a tour of the United States, during which they performed several songs which would later be part of Led Zeppelin's early repertoire, including covers of Johnny Burnette's \"Train Kept A-Rollin'\" and \"Dazed and Confused\", a song originally written and recorded by Jake Holmes. In early April 1968, the Yardbirds held a recording session at Columbia Studios in New York City, recording a number of tracks including a Page-Relf composition initially titled \"Knowing That I'm Losing You\", which was eventually re-recorded by Led Zeppelin as \"Tangerine\".\nThe Yardbirds' 1968 tour proved to be exhausting for the band. Drummer Jim McCarty and vocalist Keith Relf aimed to embark in a more acoustic direction, forming a folk rock duo which would eventually evolve into the group Renaissance. Page, on the other hand wanted to continue the heavier blues-based sound he had established with the Yardbirds. With the support of the Yardbirds' new manager Peter Grant, Page planned to form a supergroup with Beck and himself on guitars, and The Who's Keith Moon and John Entwistle on drums and bass, respectively. Vocalists Steve Winwood and Steve Marriott were also considered for the project. The group never formed, although Page, Beck, and Moon had recorded a song together in 1966, \"Beck's Bolero\", in a session that also included bassist-keyboardist John Paul Jones.\nThe Yardbirds played their final gig on 7 July 1968 at Luton College of Technology in Bedfordshire. They were still committed to several concerts in Scandinavia, so McCarty and Relf authorised Page and bassist Chris Dreja to use the Yardbirds' name to fulfill the band's obligations. Page and Dreja began putting a new line-up together. Page's first choice for the lead singer was Terry Reid, but Reid declined the offer and suggested Robert Plant, a singer for the Band of Joy and Hobbstweedle. Plant eventually accepted the position, recommending former Band of Joy drummer John Bonham. John Paul Jones enquired about the vacant position of bass guitarist, at the suggestion of his wife, after Dreja dropped out of the project to become a photographer. Page had known Jones since they were both session musicians, and agreed to let him join as the final member.\nIn August 1968, the four played together for the first time in a room below a record store on Gerrard Street in London. Page suggested that they attempt \"Train Kept A-Rollin'\", originally a jump blues song popularised in a rockabilly version by Johnny Burnette, which had been covered by the Yardbirds. \"As soon as I heard John Bonham play\", Jones recalled, \"I knew this was going to be great\u00a0... We locked together as a team immediately\". Before leaving for Scandinavia, the group took part in a recording session for the P. J. Proby album \"Three Week Hero\". The album's track \"Jim's Blues\", with Plant on harmonica, was the first studio track to feature all four future members of Led Zeppelin.\nThe band completed the Scandinavian tour as the New Yardbirds, playing together for the first time in front of a live audience at Gladsaxe Teen Club at the Egeg\u00e5rd School (today Gladsaxe School) festive hall, Gladsaxe, Denmark, on 7 September 1968. Later that month, they began recording their first album, which was based on their live set. The album was recorded and mixed in nine days, and Page covered the costs. After the album's completion, the band were forced to change their name after Dreja issued a cease and desist letter, stating that Page was allowed to use the New Yardbirds moniker for the Scandinavian dates only. One account of how the new band's name was chosen held that Moon and Entwistle had suggested that a supergroup with Page and Beck would go down like a \"lead balloon\", an idiom for being very unsuccessful or unpopular. The group dropped the 'a' in \"lead\" at the suggestion of Peter Grant, so that those unfamiliar with the term would not pronounce it \"leed\". The word \"balloon\" was replaced by \"zeppelin\", a word which, according to music journalist Keith Shadwick, brought \"the perfect combination of heavy and light, combustibility and grace\" to Page's mind.\nGrant secured a $143,000 advance contract ($ today) from Atlantic Records in November 1968\u2014at the time, the biggest deal of its kind for a new band. Atlantic was a label with a catalogue of mainly blues, soul, and jazz artists, but in the late 1960s, it began to take an interest in British progressive rock acts. At the recommendation of British singer Dusty Springfield, a friend of Jones who at the time was completing her first Atlantic album, \"Dusty in Memphis\", record executives signed Led Zeppelin without having ever seen them. Under the terms of their contract, the band had autonomy in deciding when they would release albums and tour and had the final say over the contents and design of each album. They would also decide how to promote each release and which tracks to release as singles. They formed their own company, Superhype, to handle all publishing rights.\nEarly years: 1968\u20131970.\nStill billed as the New Yardbirds, the band began their first tour of the UK on 4 October 1968, when they played at the Mayfair Ballroom in Newcastle upon Tyne. Their first show as Led Zeppelin was at the University of Surrey in Guildford on 25 October. Tour manager Richard Cole, who would become a major figure in the touring life of the group, organised their first North American tour at the end of the year. Their debut album, \"Led Zeppelin\", was released in the US during the tour on 13 January 1969, and peaked at number 10 on the \"Billboard\" chart; it was released in the UK, where it peaked at number 6, on 31 March. According to Steve Erlewine, the album's memorable guitar riffs, lumbering rhythms, psychedelic blues, groovy, bluesy shuffles and hints of English folk music made it \"a significant turning point in the evolution of hard rock and heavy metal\".\nIn their first year, Led Zeppelin completed four US and four UK concert tours, and also released their second album, \"Led Zeppelin II\". Recorded mostly on the road at various North American studios, it was an even greater commercial success than their first album and reached the number one chart position in the US and the UK. The album further developed the mostly blues-rock musical style established on their debut release, creating a sound that was \"heavy and hard, brutal and direct\", and which would be highly influential and frequently imitated. Steve Waksman has suggested that \"Led Zeppelin II\" was \"the musical starting point for heavy metal\".\nThe band saw their albums as indivisible, complete listening experiences, disliking the re-editing of existing tracks for release as singles. Grant maintained an aggressive pro-album stance, particularly in the UK, where there were few radio and TV outlets for rock music. Without the band's consent, however, some songs were released as singles, particularly in the US. In 1969, an edited version of \"Whole Lotta Love\", a track from their second album, was released as a single in the US. It reached number four in the \"Billboard\" chart in January 1970, selling over one million copies and helping to cement the band's popularity. The group also increasingly shunned television appearances, citing their preference that their fans hear and see them in live concerts.\nFollowing the release of their second album, Led Zeppelin completed several more US tours. They played initially in clubs and ballrooms, and then in larger auditoriums as their popularity grew. Some early Led Zeppelin concerts lasted more than four hours, with expanded and improvised live versions of their repertoire. Many of these shows have been preserved as bootleg recordings. It was during this period of intensive concert touring that the band developed a reputation for off-stage excess.\nIn 1970, Page and Plant retired to Bron-Yr-Aur, a remote cottage in Wales, to commence work on their third album, \"Led Zeppelin III\". The result was a more acoustic style that was strongly influenced by folk and Celtic music, and showcased the band's versatility. The album's rich acoustic sound initially received mixed reactions, with critics and fans surprised at the turn from the primarily electric arrangements of the first two albums, further fuelling the band's hostility to the musical press. It reached number one in the UK and US charts, but its stay would be the shortest of their first five albums. The album's opening track, \"Immigrant Song\", was released as a US single in November 1970 against the band's wishes, reaching the top twenty on the \"Billboard\" chart.\nPage played his 1959 Dragon Telecaster until a friend stripped Page's custom modifications and repainted the guitar. From 1969 onwards the mahogany \"Number 1\" Les Paul has been Page's main guitar.\n\"The Biggest Band in the World\": 1970\u20131975.\nDuring the 1970s, Led Zeppelin reached new heights of commercial and critical success that made them one of the most influential groups of the era, eclipsing their earlier achievements. The band's image also changed as the members began to wear elaborate, flamboyant clothing, with Page taking the lead on the flamboyant appearance by wearing a glittering moon-and-stars outfit. Led Zeppelin changed their show by using things such as lasers, professional light shows and mirror balls. They began travelling in a private jet airliner, a Boeing 720 (nicknamed \"the Starship\"), rented out entire sections of hotels (including the Continental Hyatt House in Los Angeles, known colloquially as the \"Riot House\"), and became the subject of frequently repeated stories of debauchery. One involved John Bonham riding a motorcycle through a rented floor of the Riot House, while another involved the destruction of a room in the Tokyo Hilton, leading to the group being banned from that establishment for life. Although Led Zeppelin developed a reputation for trashing their hotel suites and throwing television sets out of the windows, some suggest that these tales have been exaggerated. According to music journalist Chris Welch, \"[Led Zeppelin's] travels spawned many stories, but it was a myth that [they] were constantly engaged in acts of wanton destruction and lewd behaviour\".\nLed Zeppelin released their fourth album on 8 November 1971. The album is officially untitled but variously referred to as \"Led Zeppelin IV\", \"Untitled\", \"IV\", or, due to the four symbols appearing on the record label, as \"Four Symbols\", \"Zoso\" or \"Runes\". The band had wanted to release the fourth album with no title or information, in response to the music press \"going on about Zeppelin being a hype\", but the record company wanted something on the cover, so in discussions, it was agreed to have four symbols to represent both the four members of the band and that it was the fourth album. With 37\u00a0million copies sold, \"Led Zeppelin IV\" is one of the best-selling albums in history, and its massive popularity cemented Led Zeppelin's status as superstars in the 1970s. By 2021, it had sold 24\u00a0million copies in the United States alone. The track \"Stairway to Heaven\", never released as a single, was the most requested and most played song on American rock radio in the 1970s. The group followed up the album's release with tours of the UK, Australasia, North America, Japan, and the UK again from late 1971 through early 1973.\nLed Zeppelin's next album, \"Houses of the Holy\", was released in March 1973. It featured further experimentation by the band, who expanded their use of synthesisers and mellotron orchestration. The predominantly orange album cover, designed by the London-based design group Hipgnosis, depicts images of nude children climbing the Giant's Causeway in Northern Ireland. Although the children are not shown from the front, the cover was controversial at the time of the album's release. As with the band's fourth album, neither their name nor the album title was printed on the sleeve.\n\"Houses of the Holy\" topped charts worldwide, and the band's subsequent concert tour of North America in 1973 broke records for attendance, as they consistently filled large auditoriums and stadiums. At Tampa Stadium in Florida, they played to 56,800 fans, breaking the record set by the Beatles' 1965 Shea Stadium concert and grossing $309,000. Three sold-out shows at Madison Square Garden in New York City were filmed for a motion picture, but the theatrical release of this project (\"The Song Remains the Same\") was delayed until 1976. Before the final night's performance, $180,000 ($ today) of the band's money from gate receipts was stolen from a safe deposit box at the Drake Hotel.\nIn 1974, Led Zeppelin took a break from touring and launched their own record label, Swan Song, named after an unreleased song. The record label's logo is based on a drawing called \"Evening: Fall of Day\" (1869) by William Rimmer. The drawing features a figure of a winged human-like being interpreted as either Apollo or Icarus. The logo can be found on Led Zeppelin memorabilia, especially T-shirts. In addition to using Swan Song as a vehicle to promote their own albums, the band expanded the label's roster, signing artists such as Bad Company, the Pretty Things and Maggie Bell. The label was successful while Led Zeppelin existed, but folded less than three years after they disbanded.\nIn 1975, Led Zeppelin's double album \"Physical Graffiti\" was their first release on the Swan Song label. It consisted of fifteen songs, of which eight had been recorded at Headley Grange in 1974 and seven had been recorded earlier. A review in \"Rolling Stone\" magazine referred to \"Physical Graffiti\" as Led Zeppelin's \"bid for artistic respectability\", adding that the only bands Led Zeppelin had to compete with for the title \"The World's Best Rock Band\" were the Rolling Stones and the Who. The album was a massive commercial and critical success. Shortly after the release of \"Physical Graffiti\", all previous Led Zeppelin albums simultaneously re-entered the top-200 album chart, and the band embarked on another North American tour, now employing sophisticated sound and lighting systems. In May 1975, Led Zeppelin played five sold-out nights at the Earls Court Arena in London, at the time the largest arena in Britain.\nHiatus from touring and return: 1975\u20131977.\nFollowing their triumphant Earls Court appearances, Led Zeppelin took a holiday and planned an autumn tour in America, scheduled to open with two outdoor dates in San Francisco. In August 1975, however, Plant and his wife Maureen were involved in a serious car crash while on holiday in Rhodes, Greece. Plant suffered a broken ankle and Maureen was badly injured; a blood transfusion saved her life. Unable to tour, he headed to the Channel Island of Jersey to spend August and September recuperating, with Bonham and Page in tow. The band then reconvened in Malibu, California. During this forced hiatus, much of the material for their next album, \"Presence\", was written.\nBy this time, Led Zeppelin were the world's number one rock attraction, having outsold most bands of the time, including the Rolling Stones. \"Presence\", released in March 1976, marked a change in the Led Zeppelin sound towards more straightforward, guitar-based jams, departing from the acoustic ballads and intricate arrangements featured on their previous albums. Though it was a platinum seller, \"Presence\" received a mixed reaction among fans and the music press, with some critics suggesting that the band's excesses may have caught up with them. Page had been using heroin regularly since 1975 and relied on it during the rapid recording sessions for the album, a habit which affected the band's later live shows and studio recordings, although he has since denied this.\nBecause of Plant's injuries, Led Zeppelin did not tour in 1976. Instead, the band completed the concert film \"The Song Remains the Same\" and the accompanying soundtrack album. The film premiered in New York City on 20 October 1976, but was given a lukewarm reception by critics and fans. The film was particularly unsuccessful in the UK, where, unwilling to tour since 1975 because of their tax exile status, Led Zeppelin faced an uphill battle to recapture the public's affection.\nIn 1977, Led Zeppelin embarked on another major concert tour of North America. The band set another attendance record, with an audience of 76,229 at their Silverdome concert on 30 April. It was, according to the \"Guinness Book of Records\", the largest attendance to that date for a single act show. Although the tour was financially profitable, it was beset by off-stage problems. On 19 April, over 70 people were arrested as about 1,000 fans tried to gatecrash Cincinnati Riverfront Coliseum for two sold-out concerts, while others tried to gain entry by throwing rocks and bottles through glass doors. On 3 June, a concert at Tampa Stadium was cut short because of a severe thunderstorm, despite tickets indicating \"Rain or Shine\". A riot broke out, resulting in arrests and injuries.\nAfter the 23 July show at the Day on the Green festival at the Oakland Coliseum in Oakland, California, Bonham and members of Led Zeppelin's support staff were arrested after a member of promoter Bill Graham's staff was badly beaten during the band's performance by Zeppelin manager Peter Grant and one of his security staff, John Bindon. The following day's second Oakland concert was the group's final live appearance in the United States. Two days later, as they checked in at a French Quarter hotel for their 30 July performance at the Louisiana Superdome, Plant received news that his five-year-old son, Karac, had died from a stomach virus. The rest of the tour was immediately cancelled, prompting widespread speculation about Led Zeppelin's future.\nBonham's death and break-up: 1978\u20131980.\nIn November 1978, the group recorded at Polar Studios in Stockholm, Sweden. The resulting album, \"In Through the Out Door\", featured sonic experimentation that again drew mixed reactions from critics. Nevertheless, the album reached number one in the UK and the US in just its second week of release. With this album's release, Led Zeppelin's entire catalogue returned to the \"Billboard\" Top 200 in the weeks of 27 October and 3 November 1979.\nIn August 1979, after two warm-up shows in Copenhagen, Led Zeppelin headlined two concerts at the Knebworth Music Festival, playing to a crowd of approximately 104,000 on the first night. A brief, low-key European tour was undertaken in June and July 1980, featuring a stripped-down set without the usual lengthy jams and solos. On 27 June, at a show in Nuremberg, West Germany, the concert came to an abrupt halt in the middle of the third song, when Bonham collapsed onstage and was rushed to hospital. Speculation in the press suggested that his collapse had been the result of excessive alcohol and drug use, but the band claimed that he had simply overeaten.\nA North American tour, the band's first since 1977, was scheduled to commence on 17 October 1980. On 24 September, Bonham was picked up by Led Zeppelin assistant Rex King to attend rehearsals at Bray Studios. During the journey, Bonham asked to stop for breakfast, where he downed four quadruple vodkas (from ), with a ham roll. After taking a bite of the ham roll he said to his assistant, \"breakfast\". He continued to drink heavily after arriving at the studio. The rehearsals were halted late that evening and the band retired to Page's house\u2014the Old Mill House in Clewer, Windsor.\nAfter midnight, Bonham, who had fallen asleep, was taken to bed and placed on his side. At 1:45\u00a0pm the next day, Benji LeFevre (Led Zeppelin's new tour manager) and John Paul Jones found Bonham dead. The cause of death was asphyxiation from vomit; the finding was accidental death. An autopsy found no other recreational drugs in Bonham's body. Although he had recently begun to take Motival (a cocktail of the antipsychotic fluphenazine and the tricyclic antidepressant nortriptyline) to combat his anxiety, it is unclear if these substances interacted with the alcohol in his system. Bonham's remains were cremated and his ashes interred on 12 October 1980, at Rushock parish church, Worcestershire.\nThe planned North American tour was cancelled, and despite rumours that Cozy Powell, Carmine Appice, Barriemore Barlow, Simon Kirke, Ric Lee or Bev Bevan would join the group as his replacement, the remaining members decided to disband. A 4 December 1980 press statement stated that, \"We wish it to be known that the loss of our dear friend, and the deep sense of undivided harmony felt by ourselves and our manager, have led us to decide that we could not continue as we were.\" The statement was signed simply \"Led Zeppelin\".\nPost-breakup.\n1980s.\nThe studio album \"Coda\" \u2013 a collection of Zeppelin outtakes and unused tracks \u2013 was issued in November 1982. It included two tracks from the Royal Albert Hall in 1970, one each from the \"Led Zeppelin III\" and \"Houses of the Holy\" sessions, and three from the \"In Through the Out Door\" sessions. It also featured a 1976 Bonham drum instrumental with electronic effects added by Page, called \"Bonzo's Montreux\".\nThe first significant post-breakup musical project by Led Zeppelin members was the Honeydrippers, formed by Plant in 1981. The group featured Page on lead guitar along with studio musicians and friends of the pair, including Jeff Beck, Paul Shaffer, and Nile Rodgers. It released one EP, in 1984. Plant focused on a different direction from Zeppelin, playing standards and in a more R&amp;B style, highlighted by a cover of \"Sea of Love\" that peaked at number three on the \"Billboard\" chart in early 1985.\nOn 13 July 1985, Page, Plant, and Jones reunited for the Live Aid concert at JFK Stadium, Philadelphia, playing a short set with drummers Tony Thompson and Phil Collins and bassist Paul Martinez. Collins had contributed to Plant's first two solo albums; Martinez was a member of Plant's solo band. The performance was marred by a lack of rehearsal with the two drummers, Page's struggles with an out-of-tune guitar, poorly functioning monitors, and Plant's hoarse voice. Page described the performance as \"pretty shambolic\", while Plant characterised it as an \"atrocity\".\nThe three members reunited again on 14 May 1988, for the Atlantic Records 40th Anniversary concert, with Bonham's son Jason on drums. The result was again disjointed: Plant and Page had argued immediately before taking the stage about whether to play \"Stairway to Heaven\", and Jones' keyboards were absent from the live television feed. Page described the performance as \"one big disappointment\" and Plant said \"the gig was foul\".\n1990s.\nThe first Led Zeppelin box set, featuring tracks remastered under Page's supervision, was released in 1990 and bolstered the band's reputation, leading to abortive discussions among members about a reunion. This set included four previously unreleased tracks, including a version of Robert Johnson's \"Travelling Riverside Blues\". The song peaked at number seven on the \"Billboard\" Album Rock Tracks chart. \"Led Zeppelin Boxed Set 2\" was released in 1993; the two box sets together contained all known studio recordings, as well as some rare live tracks.\nIn 1994, Page and Plant reunited for a 90-minute \"UnLedded\" MTV project. They later released an album called \"\", which featured some reworked Led Zeppelin songs, and embarked on a world tour the following year. This is said to be the beginning of a rift between the band members, as Jones was not even told of the reunion.\nIn 1995, Led Zeppelin were inducted into the United States Rock and Roll Hall of Fame by Steven Tyler and Joe Perry of Aerosmith. Jason and Zo\u00eb Bonham also attended, representing their late father. At the induction ceremony, the band's inner rift became apparent when Jones joked upon accepting his award, \"Thank you, my friends, for finally remembering my phone number\", causing consternation and awkward looks from Page and Plant. Afterwards, they played one brief set with Tyler and Perry, with Jason Bonham on drums, and then a second with Neil Young, this time with Michael Lee playing the drums.\nIn 1997, Atlantic released a single edit of \"Whole Lotta Love\" in the US and the UK, the only single the band released in their homeland, where it peaked at number 21. November 1997 saw the release of \"Led Zeppelin BBC Sessions\", a two-disc set largely recorded in 1969 and 1971. Page and Plant released another album called \"Walking into Clarksdale\" in 1998, featuring all new material, but after disappointing sales, the partnership dissolved before a planned Australian tour.\n2000s.\nThe year 2003 saw the release of the triple live album \"How the West Was Won\", and \"Led Zeppelin DVD\", a six-hour chronological set of live footage that became the best-selling music DVD in history. In July 2007, Atlantic/Rhino and Warner Home Video announced three Zeppelin titles to be released that November: \"Mothership\", a 24-track best-of spanning the band's career; a reissue of the soundtrack \"The Song Remains the Same\", including previously unreleased material; and a new DVD. Zeppelin also made their catalogue legally available for download, becoming one of the last major rock bands to do so.\nOn 10 December 2007, Zeppelin reunited for the Ahmet Ertegun Tribute Concert at the O2 Arena in London, with Jason Bonham again taking his father's place on drums. According to \"Guinness World Records 2009\", the show set a record for the \"Highest Demand for Tickets for One Music Concert\" as 20\u00a0million requests were submitted online. Critics praised the performance and there was widespread speculation about a full reunion. Page, Jones and Jason Bonham were reported to be willing to tour and to be working on material for a new Zeppelin project. Plant continued his touring commitments with Alison Krauss, stating in September 2008 that he would not record or tour with the band. \"I told them I was busy and they'd simply have to wait,\" he recalled in 2014. \"I would come around eventually, which they were fine with \u2013 at least to my knowledge. But it turns out they weren't. And what's even more disheartening, Jimmy used it against me.\"\nJones and Page reportedly looked for a replacement for Plant; candidates including Steven Tyler of Aerosmith, and Myles Kennedy of Alter Bridge. However, in January 2009, it was confirmed that the project had been abandoned. \"Getting the opportunity to play with Jimmy Page, John Paul Jones and Jason Bonham was pretty special,\" Kennedy recalled. \"That is pretty much the zenith right there. That was a crazy, good experience. It's something I still think of often ... It's so precious to me.\"\n2010s.\nA film of the O2 performance, \"Celebration Day\", premiered on 17 October 2012 and was released on DVD on 19 November. The film grossed $2\u00a0million in one night, and the live album peaked at number 4 and 9 in the UK and US, respectively. Following the film's premiere, Page revealed that he had been remastering the band's discography. The first wave of albums, \"Led Zeppelin\", \"Led Zeppelin II\", and \"Led Zeppelin III\", were released on 2 June 2014. The second wave of albums, \"Led Zeppelin IV\" and \"Houses of the Holy\", were released on 27 October 2014. \"Physical Graffiti\" was released on 23 February 2015, almost exactly forty years to the day after the original release. The fourth and final wave of studio album reissues, \"Presence\", \"In Through the Out Door\", and \"Coda\", were released on 31 July 2015.\nThrough this remastering project, each studio album was reissued on CD and vinyl and was also available in a Deluxe Edition, which contained a bonus disc of previously unheard material (\"Coda\"'s Deluxe Edition would include two bonus discs). Each album was also available in a Super Deluxe Edition Box Set, which included the remastered album and bonus disc on both CD and 180-gram vinyl, a high-definition audio download card of all content at 96\u00a0kHz/24 bit, a hardbound book filled with rare and previously unseen photos and memorabilia, and a high-quality print of the original album cover.\nOn 6 November 2015, the \"Mothership\" compilation was reissued using the band's newly remastered audio tracks. The reissuing campaign continued the next year with the re-release of \"BBC Sessions\" on 16 September 2016. The reissue contained a bonus disc with nine unreleased BBC recordings, including the heavily bootlegged but never officially released \"Sunshine Woman\".\nTo commemorate the band's 50th anniversary, Page, Plant and Jones announced an official illustrated book celebrating 50 years since the formation of the band. Also released for the celebration was a reissue of \"How the West Was Won\" on 23 March 2018, which includes the album's first pressing on vinyl. For Record Store Day on 21 April 2018, Led Zeppelin released a 7\" single \"Rock and Roll\" (Sunset Sound Mix)/\"Friends\" (Olympic Studio Mix), their first single in 21 years.\n2020s.\nIn October 2020, Page released a photo collection called \"Jimmy Page: The Anthology\", in which it was confirmed a documentary was in the works for the band's 50th anniversary. A work-in-progress version of the documentary film, titled \"Becoming Led Zeppelin\", was screened at the Venice Film Festival in 2021. It was the first time the band's members had agreed to participate in a biographical documentary. The completed film premiered in IMAX in several countries on 7 February 2025.\nArtistry.\nLed Zeppelin's music was rooted in the blues. The influence of American blues artists such as Muddy Waters and Skip James was particularly apparent on their first two albums, as was the distinct country blues style of Howlin' Wolf. There were tracks structured around the twelve-bar blues on every studio album except for one, and the blues directly and indirectly influenced other songs both musically and lyrically. The band were also strongly influenced by the music of the British, Celtic, and American folk revivals. Scottish folk guitarist Bert Jansch helped inspire Page, and from him he adapted open tunings and aggressive strokes into his playing. The band also drew on a wide variety of genres, including world music, and elements of early rock and roll, jazz, country, funk, soul, and reggae, particularly on \"Houses of the Holy\" and the albums that followed.\nThe material on the first two albums was largely constructed out of extended jams of blues standards and folk songs. Page recounted the process, saying \"We didn't over-rehearse things. We just had them so that they were just right, so that there was this tension \u2013 maybe there might be a mistake. But there won't be, because this is how we're all going to do it and it's gonna work!\" This method led to musical and lyrical elements from different songs and versions, as well as improvised passages, being mixed together to create new material\u2014which would also lead to later accusations of plagiarism and legal disputes over copyright. Usually the music was developed first, sometimes with improvised lyrics that might then be rewritten for the final version of the song. From the visit to Bron-Yr-Aur in 1970, the songwriting partnership between Page and Plant became predominant, with Page supplying the music, largely via his acoustic guitar, and Plant emerging as the band's chief lyricist. Jones and Bonham then added to the material, in rehearsal or in the studio, as a song was developed. In the later stages of the band's career, Page took a back seat in composition and Jones became increasingly important in producing music, often composed on the keyboard. Plant then added lyrics before Page and Bonham developed their parts.\nEarly lyrics drew on the band's blues and folk roots, often mixing lyrical fragments from different songs. Many of the band's songs dealt with themes of romance, unrequited love and sexual conquest, which were common in rock, pop and blues music. Some of their lyrics, especially those derived from the blues, have been interpreted as misogynistic. Particularly on \"Led Zeppelin III\", they incorporated elements of mythology and mysticism into their music, which largely grew out of Plant's interest in legends and history. These elements were often taken to reflect Page's interest in the occult, which resulted in accusations that the recordings contained subliminal satanic messages, some of which were said to be contained in backmasking; these claims were generally dismissed by the band and music critics. The pastoral fantasies in Plant's songwriting were inspired by the landscape of the Black Country region and J. R. R. Tolkien's high fantasy novel \"The Lord of the Rings\". Susan Fast argues that as Plant emerged as the band's main lyricist, the songs more obviously reflected his alignment with the West Coast counterculture of the 1960s. In the later part of the band's career Plant's lyrics became more autobiographical, and less optimistic, drawing on his own experiences and circumstances.\nAccording to musicologist Robert Walser, \"Led Zeppelin's sound was marked by speed and power, unusual rhythmic patterns, contrasting terraced dynamics, singer Robert Plant's wailing vocals, and guitarist Jimmy Page's heavily distorted crunch\". These elements mean that they are often cited as one of the originators of hard rock and heavy metal and they have been described as the \"definitive heavy metal band\", although the band members have often eschewed the label. Led Zeppelin, together with Deep Purple and Black Sabbath, have been referred to as the \"unholy trinity of British hard rock and heavy metal in the early to mid- seventies\". Part of this reputation depends on the band's use of distorted guitar riffs on songs like \"Whole Lotta Love\" and \"The Wanton Song\". Often riffs were not doubled by guitar, bass and drums exactly, but instead there were melodic or rhythmic variations. Page's guitar playing incorporated elements of the blues scale with those of eastern music. Plant's use of high-pitched shrieks has been compared to Janis Joplin's vocal technique. Robert Christgau found him integral to the group's heavy \"power blues\" aesthetic, functioning as a \"mechanical effect\" similarly to Page's guitar parts. While noting Plant \"hints at real feeling\" on some of their acoustic songs, Christgau believed he abandoned traditional blues singing's emphasis on emotional projection in favour of vocal precision and dynamics: \"Whether he is mouthing sexist blues cliches or running through one of the band's half-audible, half-comprehensible ... lyrics about chivalry or the counter-culture, his voice is devoid of feeling. Like the tenors and baritones of yore, he wants his voice to be an instrument\u2014specifically, an electric guitar.\" Bonham's drumming was noted for its power, his rapid rolls and his fast beats on a single bass drum; while Jones' basslines have been described as melodic and his keyboard playing added a classical touch to the band's sound.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\nAt some deep level, Led Zeppelin's music is about the relationship between humanity and technology. Philosophically, the band prefers humanity pure and simple, but in practice it must realize its humanity technologically. That seems truer than most good-time pastoral fantasies.\n \u2014Robert Christgau, 1972\nLed Zeppelin have been widely viewed as a hard rock band, although Christgau regarded them as art rock as well. According to popular music scholar Reebee Garofalo, \"because hip critics could not find a constructive way of positioning themselves in relation to Led Zeppelin's ultra-macho presentation, they were excluded from the art rock category despite their broad range of influences.\" Christgau wrote in 1972, the band could be considered art rock because they \"relate to rock and roll not organically but intellectually\", idealising the \"amplified beat\" as \"a kind of formal challenge\". Unlike their contemporaries in Jethro Tull and Yes, who use \"the physical compulsion of beat and volume to involve the mind\", Led Zeppelin \"make body music of an oddly cerebral cast, arousing aggression rather than sexuality.\" As such, along with other second-generation English hard rock bands like Black Sabbath and Mott the Hoople, they can attract both intellectuals and working-class youths in \"a strange potential double audience.\" Years later, \"In Through the Out Door\"'s \"tuneful synthesizer pomp\" further confirmed for Christgau they were an art rock band.\nPage stated that he wanted Led Zeppelin to produce music that had \"light and shade\", and held the belief that instrumentation could be used to \"set the scene.\" This began to be more clearly realised beginning with \"Led Zeppelin III\", which made greater use of acoustic instruments. This approach has been seen as exemplified in the fourth album, particularly on \"Stairway to Heaven\", which begins with acoustic guitar and recorder and ends with drums and heavy electric sounds. Page was quoted saying, \"The music is lyrical without lyrics. The lyrics are telling a story and they're conveying a situation or a person or a reflection or an observation, and the construction of the music I felt was doing the same sort of thing. It was lyrical in the way it was being played.\" Towards the end of their recording career, they moved to a more mellow and progressive sound, dominated by Jones' keyboard motifs. They also increasingly made use of various layering and production techniques, including multi-tracking and overdubbed guitar parts. Their emphasis on the sense of dynamics and ensemble arrangement has been seen as producing an individualistic style that transcends any single music genre. Ian Peddie argues that they were \"...\u00a0loud, powerful and often heavy, but their music was also humorous, self-reflective and extremely subtle\". Page stated that the band's albums were intended to be taken as a whole. He was quoted saying, \"We were crafting albums for the album market. It was important, I felt, to have the flow and the rise and fall of the music and the contrast, so that each song would have more impact against the other.\"\nLegacy.\nLed Zeppelin is widely regarded as one of the most successful, innovative, and influential bands in the history of rock music. Rock critic Mikal Gilmore said, \"Led Zeppelin\u2014talented, complex, grasping, beautiful and dangerous\u2014made one of the most enduring bodies of composition and performance in twentieth-century music, despite everything they had to overpower, including themselves\".\nLed Zeppelin have influenced hard rock and heavy metal bands such as Deep Purple, Black Sabbath, Rush, Queen, Scorpions, Aerosmith, the Black Crowes, and Megadeth as well as progressive metal bands like Tool and Dream Theater. Jeff Mezydlo of Yardbarker wrote, \"While Black Sabbath and Deep Purple also influenced a hard, guitar-driven sound that opened the door for the heavy metal movement, Zeppelin did it better than anybody.\" The band also influenced some early punk and post-punk bands, among them the Ramones, Joy Division and the Cult. They were also an important influence on the development of alternative rock, as bands adapted elements from the \"Zeppelin sound\" of the mid-1970s, including the Smashing Pumpkins, Nirvana, Pearl Jam, and Soundgarden. Bands and artists from diverse genres have acknowledged the influence of Led Zeppelin, such as Madonna, Shakira, Lady Gaga, Kesha, and Katie Melua.\nLed Zeppelin influenced the music business, particularly in the development of album-oriented rock (AOR) and stadium rock. In 1988, John Kalodner, then-Geffen Records A&amp;R executive, said, \"Next to the Beatles they're the most influential band in history. They influence the way music is on records, AOR radio, concerts. They set the standards for the AOR-radio format with 'Stairway to Heaven,' having AOR hits without necessarily having Top 40 hits. They're the ones who did the first real big arena concert shows, consistently selling out and playing stadiums without support. People can do as well as them, but nobody surpasses them.\"\nAndrew Loog Oldham, the former producer and manager of the Rolling Stones, said Led Zeppelin influenced the record business and the way rock concerts were managed and presented to huge audiences. In 2007, they were a featured artist in the stadium rock episode of the BBC/VH1 series \"Seven Ages of Rock\".\nThe band have sold over 200\u00a0million albums worldwide, according to some sources, while others state that they have sold more than 300\u00a0million records, including 111.5\u00a0million certified units in the United States. According to the Recording Industry Association of America, Led Zeppelin are the third-highest-selling band, the fifth highest selling music act in the US, and one of only four acts to earn five or more Diamond albums. They achieved eight consecutive number-ones on the UK Albums Chart, a record for most consecutive UK number-one albums shared with ABBA. Led Zeppelin remain one of the most bootlegged artists in the history of rock music.\nLed Zeppelin had cultural impact. Jim Miller, editor of \"Rolling Stone Illustrated History of Rock &amp; Roll\", argues that \"on one level, Led Zeppelin represents the final flowering of the sixties' psychedelic ethic, which casts rock as passive sensory involvement\". Led Zeppelin have also been described as \"the quintessential purveyors\" of masculine and aggressive \"cock rock\", although this assertion has been challenged. The band's fashion-sense has been seminal; Simeon Lipman, head of pop culture at Christie's auction house, has commented that \"Led Zeppelin have had a big influence on fashion because the whole aura surrounding them is so cool, and people want a piece of that\". Led Zeppelin laid the foundation for the big hair of the 1980s glam metal bands such as M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce and Skid Row. Other musicians have also adapted elements from Led Zeppelin's attitude to clothes, jewellery and hair, such as the hipster flares and tight band T-shirts of Kings of Leon, shaggy hair, clingy T-shirts and bluesman hair of Jack White of the White Stripes, and Kasabian guitarist Sergio Pizzorno's silk scarves, trilbies and side-laced tight jeans.\nAchievements.\nLed Zeppelin have collected many honours and awards. They were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1995, and the UK Music Hall of Fame in 2006. Among the band's awards are an American Music Award in 2005, and the Polar Music Prize in 2006. Led Zeppelin received a Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award in 2005; Four of their recordings have been inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame. They have been awarded five Diamond albums, as well as fourteen Multi-Platinum, four Platinum and one Gold album in the United States, while in the UK they have five Multi-Platinum, six Platinum, one Gold and four Silver albums. \"Rolling Stone\" named Led Zeppelin the 14th-greatest artist of all time in 2004.\nIn 2003, \"Rolling Stone\"'s 500 Greatest Albums of All Time list included \"Led Zeppelin\" at number 29, \"Led Zeppelin IV\" at number 66, \"Physical Graffiti\" at number 70, \"Led Zeppelin II\" at number 75, and \"Houses of the Holy\" at number 149. And in 2004, on their 500 Greatest Songs of All Time list, \"Rolling Stone\" included \"Stairway to Heaven\" at number 31, \"Whole Lotta Love\" at number 75, \"Kashmir\" at number 140, \"Black Dog\" at number 294, \"Heartbreaker\" at number 320, and \"Ramble On\" at number 433.\nIn 2005, Page was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire in recognition of his charity work, and in 2009 Plant was honoured as a Commander of the Order of the British Empire for his services to popular music. The band are ranked number one on VH1's \"100 Greatest Artists of Hard Rock\" and \"Classic Rock\"'s \"50 best live acts of all time\". They were named as the best Rock band in a poll by BBC Radio 2. They were awarded an Ivor Novello Award for \"Outstanding Contribution to British Music\" in 1977, as well as a \"Lifetime Achievement Award\" at the 42nd Annual Ivor Novello awards ceremony in 1997. The band were honoured at the 2008 MOJO Awards with the \"Best Live Act\" prize for their one-off reunion, and were described as the \"greatest rock and roll band of all time\". In 2010, \"Led Zeppelin IV\" was one of ten classic album covers from British artists commemorated on a UK postage stamp issued by the Royal Mail; they were unveiled by Jimmy Page. Led Zeppelin were named as 2012 recipients of the Kennedy Center Honors.\nBand members.\nGuest musicians post-breakup\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "17911", "revid": "27015025", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=17911", "title": "Lord Dunsany", "text": "Anglo-Irish writer and dramatist (1878\u20131957)\nEdward John Moreton Drax Plunkett, 18th Baron Dunsany (; 24 July 1878 \u2013 25 October 1957), commonly known as Lord Dunsany, was an Anglo-Irish writer and dramatist. He published more than 90 books during his lifetime, and his output consisted of hundreds of short stories, plays, novels, and essays; further works were published posthumously. Having gained a name in the 1910s as a writer in the English-speaking world, he is best known today for the 1924 fantasy novel \"The King of Elfland's Daughter\", and his first book, \"The Gods of Peg\u0101na\", which depicts a fictional pantheon. Many critics feel his early work laid grounds for the fantasy genre.\nBorn in London as heir to one of the oldest Irish peerages, he was raised partly in Kent, but later lived mainly at Ireland's possibly longest-inhabited home, Dunsany Castle near Tara. He worked with W. B. Yeats and Lady Gregory, and supported the Abbey Theatre and some fellow writers. He was a chess and pistol champion of Ireland, and travelled and hunted. He devised an asymmetrical game called Dunsany's chess. In later life, he was awarded an honorary doctorate from Trinity College Dublin. He settled in Shoreham, Kent, in 1947. In 1957 he took ill when visiting Ireland and died in Dublin of appendicitis.\nBiography.\nEarly life.\nEdward Plunkett (\"Dunsany\"), known to his family as \"Eddie\", was the first son of John William Plunkett, 17th Baron of Dunsany (1853\u20131899), and his wife, Ernle Elizabeth Louisa Maria Grosvenor Ernle-Erle-Drax (n\u00e9e Burton) (1855\u20131916).\nFrom a historically wealthy and famous family, Lord Dunsany was related to many well-known Irish figures. He was a kinsman of the Catholic Saint Oliver Plunkett, the martyred Archbishop of Armagh whose ring and crozier head are still held by the Dunsany family. He was also related to the prominent Anglo-Irish unionist and later nationalist / Home Rule politician Sir Horace Plunkett and George Count Plunkett, Papal Count and Republican politician, father of Joseph Plunkett, executed for his part in the 1916 Rising.\nHis mother was a cousin of Sir Richard Burton, and he inherited from her considerable height, being 1.93 metres tall (6'4\"). The Countess of Fingall, wife of Dunsany's cousin, the Earl of Fingall, wrote a best-selling account of the life of the aristocracy in Ireland in the late 19th century and early 20th century called \"Seventy Years Young\".\nPlunkett's only adult sibling, a younger brother, from whom he was estranged from about 1916, for reasons not fully clear but connected to his mother's will, was the noted British naval officer Sir Reginald Drax. Another younger brother died in infancy.\nEdward Plunkett grew up at the family properties, notably Dunstall Priory in Shoreham, Kent, and Dunsany Castle in County Meath, but also in family homes such as in London. His schooling was at Cheam, Eton College and the Royal Military College, Sandhurst, which he entered in 1896.\nTitle and marriage.\nThe title passed to him at his father's death in 1899 at a fairly young age. The young Lord Dunsany returned to Dunsany Castle after war duty, in 1901. In that year he was also confirmed as an elector for the Irish representative peers in the House of Lords.\nIn 1903, he met Lady Beatrice Child Villiers (1880\u20131970), youngest daughter of The 7th Earl of Jersey (head of the Jersey banking family), who was then living at Osterley Park. They married in 1904. Their one child, Randal, was born in 1906. Lady Beatrice was supportive of Dunsany's interests and helped him by typing his manuscripts, selecting work for his collections, including the 1954 retrospective short story collection, and overseeing his literary heritage after his death.\nThe Dunsanys were socially active in Dublin and London and travelled between homes in Meath, London and Kent, other than during the First and Second world wars and the Irish War of Independence. Dunsany circulated with many literary figures of the time. To many of these in Ireland he was first introduced by his uncle, the co-operative pioneer Sir Horace Plunkett, who also helped to manage his estate and investments for a time. He was friendly, for example, with George William Russell, Oliver St. John Gogarty, and for a time, W. B. Yeats. He also socialised at times with George Bernard Shaw and H. G. Wells, and was a friend of Rudyard Kipling.\nIn 1910 Dunsany commissioned a two-storey extension to Dunsany Castle, with a billiard room, bedrooms and other facilities. The billiard room includes the crests of all the Lords Dunsany up to the 18th.\nMilitary experience.\nDunsany served as a second lieutenant in the Coldstream Guards in the Second Boer War. Volunteering in the First World War and appointed Captain in the Royal Inniskilling Fusiliers, he was stationed for a time at Ebrington Barracks in Derry. Hearing while on leave of disturbances in Dublin during the Easter Rising of 1916, he drove in to offer help and was wounded by a bullet lodged in his skull. After recovery at Jervis Street Hospital and what was then the King George V Hospital (now St. Bricin's Military Hospital), he returned to duty. His military belt was lost in the episode and later used at the burial of Michael Collins. Having been refused forward positioning in 1916 and listed as valuable as a trainer, he served in the later war stages in the trenches and in the final period writing propaganda material for the War Office with MI7b(1). There is a book at Dunsany Castle with wartime photographs, on which lost members of his command are marked.\nDuring the Irish War of Independence, Dunsany was charged with violating the Restoration of Order in Ireland Regulations, tried by court-martial on 4 February 1921, convicted, and sentenced to pay a fine of 25 pounds or serve three months in prison without labour. The Crown Forces had searched Dunsany Castle and had found two double-barrelled shotguns, two rook rifles, four Very pistols, an automatic pistol and a large quantity of pistol ammunition, along with shotgun and rifle ammunition.\nDuring the Second World War, Dunsany signed up for the Irish Army Reserve and the British Home Guard, the two countries' local defence forces, and was especially active in Shoreham, Kent, the English village bombed most during the Battle of Britain.\nLiterary life.\nDunsany's fame arose chiefly from his prolific writings. He was involved in the Irish Literary Revival. Supporting the Revival, Dunsany was a major donor to the Abbey Theatre and he moved in Irish literary circles. He was well acquainted with W. B. Yeats (who rarely acted as editor but gathered and published a Dunsany selection), Lady Gregory, Percy French, George \"AE\" Russell, Oliver St John Gogarty, Padraic Colum (with whom he jointly wrote a play) and others. He befriended and supported Francis Ledwidge, to whom he gave the use of his library, and Mary Lavin.\nDunsany made his first literary tour to the United States in 1919 and further such visits up to the 1950s, in the early years mostly to the eastern seaboard and later, notably, to California.\nDunsany's own work and contribution to the Irish literary heritage were recognised with an honorary degree from Trinity College Dublin.\nEarly 1940s.\nIn 1940, Dunsany was appointed Byron Professor of English in Athens University, Greece. Having reached Athens by a circuitous route, he was so successful that he was offered a post as Professor of English in Istanbul. However, he had to be evacuated due to the German invasion of Greece in April 1941, returning home by an even more complex route, his travels forming a basis for a long poem published in book form (\"A Journey, in 5 cantos: The Battle of Britain, The Battle of Greece, The Battle of the Mediterranean, Battles Long Ago, The Battle of the Atlantic\", special edition January 1944). Olivia Manning's character Lord Pinkrose in her novel sequence the \"Fortunes of War\" was a mocking portrait of Dunsany in that period.\nLater life.\nIn 1947, Dunsany transferred his Meath estate in trust to his son and heir Randal and settled in Kent at his Shoreham house, Dunstall Priory. He visited Ireland only occasionally thereafter, and engaged actively in life in Shoreham and London. He also began a new series of visits to the United States, notably California, as recounted in Hazel Littlefield-Smith's biographical \"Dunsany, King of Dreams\".\nDeath.\nIn 1957, Lord Dunsany became ill while dining with the Earl and Countess of Fingall at Dunsany, in what proved to be an attack of appendicitis. He died in hospital in Dublin, at the age of 79. He was buried in the churchyard of the ancient church of St Peter and St Paul, Shoreham, Kent. His funeral was attended by many family members (including Pakenhams, Jerseys and Fingalls), representatives of his old regiment and various bodies in which he had taken an interest, and figures from Shoreham. A memorial service was held at Kilmessan in Meath, with a reading of \"Crossing the Bar\", which coincided with the passing of a flock of geese.\nBeatrice survived Dunsany, living mainly at Shoreham and overseeing his literary legacy until her death in 1970. Their son Randal succeeded to the barony and was in turn succeeded by his grandson, the artist Edward Plunkett. Dunsany's literary rights passed from Beatrice to Edward.\nInterests.\nAside from his literary work, Dunsany was a keen chess player, setting chess puzzles for journals such as \"The Times\" of London, playing Jos\u00e9 Ra\u00fal Capablanca to a draw in a simultaneous exhibition, and inventing Dunsany's Chess, an asymmetrical chess variant notable for not involving any fairy pieces, unlike the many variants that require the player to learn unconventional piece movements. He was president of both the Irish Chess Union and the Kent County Chess Association for some years and of Sevenoaks Chess Club for 54 years. His short story \"The Three Sailors' Gambit\" is a classic work of suspense that incorporates a strong and unique chess element into its plot.\nDunsany was an avid horseman and hunter, for many years hosting the hounds of a local hunt and hunting in parts of Africa. He was at one time the pistol-shooting champion of Ireland. Dunsany also campaigned for animal rights, being known especially for his opposition to the \"docking\" of dogs' tails, and presided over the West Kent branch of the RSPCA in his later years. He enjoyed cricket, provided the local cricket ground situated near Dunsany Crossroads, and later played for and presided at Shoreham Cricket Club in Kent. He was a supporter of Scouting for many years, serving as President of the Sevenoaks district Boy Scouts Association. He also supported an amateur drama group, the Shoreham Players.\nDunsany provided support for the British Legion in both Ireland and Kent, including grounds in Trim and poetry for the Irish branch's annual memorial service on a number of occasions.\nWritings.\nDunsany was a prolific writer of short stories, novels, plays, poetry, essays and autobiography. He published over 90 books in his lifetime, not including individual plays. Books have continued to appear, with more than 120 having been issued by 2017. Dunsany's works have been published in many languages.\nEarly career.\nDunsany began his literary career in the late 1890s writing under his given name, with published verses such as \"Rhymes from a Suburb\" and \"The Spirit of the Bog\". In 1905, writing as Lord Dunsany, he produced the well-received collection \"The Gods of Peg\u0101na.\"\nEarly fantasy.\nDunsany's most notable fantasy short stories appeared in collections from 1905 to 1919, before fantasy had been recognised as a distinct genre. He paid for the publication of the first collection, \"The Gods of Peg\u0101na,\" earning a commission on sales.\nThe stories in his first two books, and perhaps the beginning of his third, were set in an invented world, Peg\u0101na, with its own gods, history and geography. Starting with this, Dunsany's name is linked to that of Sidney Sime, his chosen artist, who illustrated much of his work, notably up to 1922.\nDrama.\nAfter \"The Book of Wonder\" (1912), Dunsany began to write plays \u2013 many of which were even more successful at the time than his early story collections \u2013 while continuing to write short stories. He carried on writing plays for the theatre into the 1930s, including the famous \"If\" (1921), and also some radio productions.\nAlthough many of Dunsany's plays were successfully staged in his lifetime, he also wrote \"chamber plays\" or closet dramas. Some of these chamber or radio plays involve supernatural events \u2013 a character appearing out of thin air or vanishing in full view of the audience, without an explanation of how the effect is to be staged, a matter of no importance, as Dunsany did not intend them to be performed live.\nMiddle period.\nAfter a successful lecture tour to the United States in 1919 and 1920, Dunsany's reputation was now related principally to his plays. He temporarily reduced his output of short stories, concentrating on plays, novels and poetry for a time. His poetry, now little seen, was for a time so popular that it is recited by the lead character of F. Scott Fitzgerald's \"This Side of Paradise\". His sonnet \"A Dirge of Victory\" was the only poem included in the Armistice Day edition of the \"Times\" of London.\nLaunching another phase of his work, Dunsany's first novel, \"\" appeared in 1922. It is set in \"a Romantic Spain that never was\" and follows the adventures of a young nobleman, Don Rodriguez, and his servant in their search for a castle for Rodriguez. In 1924, Dunsany published his second novel, \"The King of Elfland's Daughter,\" a return to his early style of writing. In his next novel, \"The Charwoman's Shadow,\" Dunsany returned to the Spanish milieu and the light style of \"Don Rodriguez\".\nAmong his best-known characters was Joseph Jorkens, an obese, middle-aged raconteur who frequented the fictional Billiards Club in London and would tell fantastic stories if anyone bought him a large whiskey and soda. From his tales, it was clear that Jorkens had travelled to all seven continents, was extremely resourceful and well-versed in world cultures, but always came up short on becoming rich and famous. The \"Jorkens\" books, which sold well, were among the first of a type that would become popular in fantasy and science fiction writing: highly improbable \"club tales\" told at a gentleman's club or bar.\nSome saw Dunsany's writing habits as peculiar. Lady Beatrice said, \"He always sat on a crumpled old hat while composing his tales\". (The hat was eventually stolen by a visitor to Dunsany Castle.) Dunsany almost never rewrote anything; everything he published was a first draft. Much of his work was written with a quill pen he made himself; Lady Beatrice was usually the first to see the writings and would help to type them. It has been said that Lord Dunsany sometimes conceived stories while hunting and would return to the Castle and draw in his family and servants to re-enact his visions before he set them on paper.\nTranslations.\nDunsany's work was translated from early on into languages that include Spanish, French, Japanese, German, Italian, Dutch, Russian, Czech and Turkish \u2013 his uncle, Horace Plunkett, suggested 14 languages by the 1920s.\nStyle and themes.\nDunsany's style varied significantly throughout his writing career. Prominent Dunsany scholar S. T. Joshi has described these shifts as Dunsany moving on after he felt he had exhausted the potential of a style or medium. From the na\u00efve fantasy of his earliest writings, through his early short-story work in 1904\u20131908, he turned to the self-conscious fantasy of \"The Book of Wonder\" in 1912, in which he almost seems to be parodying his lofty early style.\nEach of his collections varies in mood; \"A Dreamer's Tales\" varies from the wistfulness of \"Blagdaross\" to the horrors of \"Poor Old Bill\" and \"Where the Tides Ebb and Flow\" to the social satire of \"The Day of the Poll.\" The opening paragraph of \"The Hoard of the Gibbelins\" from \"The Book of Wonder,\" (1912) gives a good indication of both the tone and tenor of Dunsany's style at the time:\nThe Gibbelins eat, as is well known, nothing less good than man. Their evil tower is joined to Terra Cognita, to the lands we know, by a bridge. Their hoard is beyond reason; avarice has no use for it; they have a separate cellar for emeralds and a separate cellar for sapphires; they have filled a hole with gold and dig it up when they need it. And the only use that is known for their ridiculous wealth is to attract to their larder a continual supply of food. In times of famine, they have even been known to scatter rubies abroad, a little trail of them to some city of Man, and sure enough, their larders would soon be full again.\nDespite his frequent shifts of style and medium, Dunsany's thematic concerns remained essentially the same. Many of his later novels had an explicitly Irish theme, from the semi-autobiographical \"The Curse of the Wise Woman\" to \"His Fellow Men.\"\nIn his 1951 essay \"Kafka and his Precursors\", Jorge Luis Borges points out that Dunsany's short story \"Carcassonne\" resembles Franz Kafka's novel \"The Castle\", which was written later. According to Borges the story is about \"An invincible army of warriors departs from an infinite castle, subjugates kingdoms and sees monsters and crosses deserts and mountains, but never reaches Carcassonne, although they once catch a glimpse of it.\"\nMemberships, awards and honours.\nLord Dunsany was a Fellow of the Royal Society of Literature, a member and at one point President of the Authors' Society, and likewise President of the Shakespeare Reading Society from 1938 until his death in 1957, when he was succeeded by Sir John Gielgud.\nDunsany was also a fellow of the Royal Geographical Society and was an honorary member of the Institut Historique et Heraldique de France. He was initially an Associate Member of the Irish Academy of Letters, founded by Yeats and others, and later a full member. At one of their meetings, after 1922, he asked Se\u00e1n \u00d3 Faol\u00e1in, who was presiding, \"Do we not toast the King?\" \u00d3 Faol\u00e1in replied that there was only one toast: to the Nation; but after it was given and O'Faolain had called for coffee, he saw Dunsany, standing quietly among the bustle, raise his glass discreetly, and whisper \"God bless him\".\n\"The Curse of the Wise Woman\" received the Harmsworth Literary Award in Ireland.\nDunsany received an honorary doctorate, D.Litt., from Trinity College Dublin, in 1940.\nIn 1950, he was nominated for the Nobel Prize in Literature by Irish PEN, citing his fiction, poetry, and support for younger writers. However, after a negative appraisal by Per Hallstr\u00f6m, the Nobel Committee did not consider him for the prize, which was won that year by Bertrand Russell.\nCurator and studies.\nIn the late 1990s, a curator, J. W. (Joe) Doyle, was appointed by the estate to work at Dunsany Castle, in part to locate and organise the author's manuscripts, typescripts and other materials. Doyle found several works known to exist but thought to be \"lost\": the plays \"The Ginger Cat\" and \"The Murderers,\" some Jorkens stories, and the novel \"The Pleasures of a Futuroscope\" (later published by Hippocampus Press). He also found hitherto unknown works, including \"The Last Book of Jorkens\", to the first edition of which he wrote an introduction, and an unnamed 1956 short story collection, eventually published as part of \"The Ghost in the Corner and other stories\" in 2017. Doyle was still working as curator in 2020. Some uncollected works, previously published in magazines, and some unpublished works, have been selected in consultation with them, and published in chapbooks by a US small press.\nFans and scholars S. T. Joshi and Darrell Schweitzer worked on the Dunsany \u0153uvre for over twenty years, gathering stories, essays and reference material, for a joint initial bibliography and separate scholarly studies of Dunsany's work. An updated edition of their bibliography appeared in 2013. Joshi edited \"The Collected Jorkens\" and \"The Ginger Cat and other lost plays\" and co-edited \"The Ghost in the Corner and other stories\" using materials unearthed by the Dunsany curator.\nIn the late 2000s a PhD researcher, Tania Scott from the University of Glasgow, worked on Dunsany for some time and spoke at literary and other conventions; her thesis was published in 2011, entitled \"Locating Ireland in the fantastic fiction of Lord Dunsany\". A Swedish fan, Martin Andersson, was also active in research and publication in the mid-2010s.\nDocumentary.\nAn hour-long documentary, \"Shooting for the Butler\", was released by Auteur TV and Justified Films in 2014, directed by Digby Rumsey. With footage from Dunsany and Shoreham, it included interviews with the author's great-grandson, the estate's curator, author Liz Williams, scholar S. T. Joshi, a local who knew the writer personally, and the head of the Irish Chess Union, among others.\nLegacy.\nDunsany's literary rights passed to a will trust first managed by Beatrice, Lady Dunsany, and are currently handled by Curtis Brown of London and partner firms worldwide. (Some past US deals, for example, have been listed by Locus Magazine as by SCG.) A few Dunsany works are protected for longer than normal copyright periods in some territories, notably most of the contents of the \"Last Book of Jorkens\", and some short stories published on the Dunsany website or elsewhere by the family in the early 2000s.\nDunsany's primary home, over 820 years old, can be visited at certain times. Tours usually include the Library, but not the tower room where he often liked to work. His other home, Dunstall Priory, was sold to an admirer, Grey Gowrie, later head of the Arts Council of the UK, and then passed to other owners. The family still owns a farm and downland in the area and a Tudor cottage in Shoreham village. The grave of Dunsany and his wife can be seen in the church graveyard there. (Most previous barons are buried in the grounds of Dunsany Castle.)\nDunsany's manuscripts are collected in the family archive, including some specially bound volumes of some of his works. Scholarly access is possible through the curator. Seven boxes of Dunsany's papers are held at the Harry Ransom Center.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "17914", "revid": "1005449", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=17914", "title": "Ludwig van Beethoven", "text": "German composer (1770\u20131827)\nLudwig van Beethoven (baptised 17 December 1770\u00a0\u2013 26 March 1827) was a German composer and pianist. One of the most revered figures in the history of Western music, his works rank among the most performed of the classical music repertoire and span the transition from the Classical period to the Romantic era. Beethoven's early period, during which he forged his craft, is typically considered to have lasted until 1802. From 1802 to around 1812, his middle period showed an individual development from the styles of Joseph Haydn and Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, and is sometimes characterised as heroic. During this time, Beethoven began to grow increasingly deaf. In his late period, from 1812 to 1827, he extended his innovations in musical form and expression.\nBorn in Bonn, Beethoven displayed his musical talent at a young age. He was initially taught intensively by his father, Johann van Beethoven, and later by Christian Gottlob Neefe. Under Neefe's tutelage in 1783, he published his first work, a set of keyboard variations. He found relief from a dysfunctional home life with the family of Helene von Breuning, whose children he loved, befriended, and taught piano. At age 21, he moved to Vienna, which subsequently became his base, and studied composition with Haydn. Beethoven then gained a reputation as a virtuoso pianist, and was soon patronised by Karl Alois, Prince Lichnowsky for compositions, which resulted in his three Opus 1 piano trios (the earliest works to which he accorded an opus number) in 1795.\nBeethoven's first major orchestral work, the First Symphony, premiered in 1800, and his first set of string quartets was published in 1801. Around 1798, Beethoven began experiencing symptoms of hearing loss; despite his advancing deafness during this period, he continued to conduct, premiering his Third and Fifth Symphonies in 1804 and 1808, respectively. His Violin Concerto appeared in 1806. His last piano concerto (No. 5, Op. 73, known as the \"Emperor\"), dedicated to his frequent patron Archduke Rudolf of Austria, premiered in 1811, without the composer as soloist. By 1815, Beethoven was nearly totally deaf and had ceased performing and seldom appeared in public. He described his health problems and his unfulfilled personal life in two letters, his \"Heiligenstadt Testament\" (1802) to his brothers and his unsent love letter to an unknown \"Immortal Beloved\" (1812).\nAfter 1810, increasingly less socially involved as his hearing loss worsened, Beethoven composed many of his most admired works, including his last three symphonies, mature chamber music and the late piano sonatas. His only opera, \"Fidelio\", first performed in 1805, was extensively revised to its final version in 1814. He composed the Missa solemnis between 1819 and 1823 and his final Symphony, No. 9, the first major example of a choral symphony, between 1822 and 1824. His late string quartets, including the \"Grosse Fuge\", of 1825\u20131826 are among his final achievements. After several months of illness, which left him bedridden, Beethoven died on 26 March 1827 at the age of 56.\nLife and career.\nEarly life and education.\nBeethoven was the grandson of Ludwig van Beethoven, a musician from the city of Mechelen in Austrian Netherlands (now Belgium), who moved to Bonn at the age of 21. Ludwig was employed as a bass singer at the court of Clemens August, Archbishop-Elector of Cologne, eventually rising to become, in 1761, \"Kapellmeister\" (music director) and hence a preeminent musician in Bonn. The portrait he commissioned of himself toward the end of his life remained displayed in his grandson's rooms as a talisman of his musical heritage. Ludwig had two sons, the younger of whom, Johann, worked as a tenor in the same musical establishment and gave keyboard and violin lessons to supplement his income.\nJohann married Maria Magdalena Keverich in 1767; she was the daughter of Heinrich Keverich (1701\u20131751), who was head chef at the court of Johann IX Philipp von Walderdorff, Archbishop of Trier. Beethoven was born of this marriage in Bonn, at what is now the Beethoven House Museum, Bonngasse 20. There is no authentic record of the date of his birth; but the registry of his baptism, in the Catholic Parish of St. Remigius on 17 December 1770, survives, and the custom in the region at the time was to carry out baptism within 24 hours of birth. There is a consensus (with which Beethoven himself agreed) that his birth date was 16\u00a0December, but there is no documented proof of this.\nOf the seven children born to Johann van Beethoven, only Ludwig, the second-born, and two younger brothers survived infancy. Kaspar Anton Karl (generally known as Karl) was born on 8 April 1774, and Nikolaus Johann, who was generally known as Johann, the youngest, was born on 2 October 1776.\nBeethoven's first music teacher was his father. He later had other local teachers, including the court organist Gilles van den Eeden (d. 1782), Tobias Friedrich Pfeiffer, a family friend, who provided keyboard tuition, Franz Rovantini, a relative who instructed him in playing the violin and viola, and court concertmaster Franz Anton Ries, who instructed Beethoven on the violin. His tuition began in his fifth year. The regime was harsh and intensive, often reducing him to tears. With the involvement of Pfeiffer, who was an insomniac, there were irregular late-night sessions with the young Beethoven dragged from his bed to the keyboard. Beethoven's musical talent became obvious at a young age. Aware of Leopold Mozart's successes in this area with his son Wolfgang and daughter Nannerl, Johann attempted to promote his son as a child prodigy, claiming that Beethoven was six (he was seven) on the posters for his first public performance in March 1778.\nBeethoven's musical abilities far exceeded his mathematical capabilities. As a student at the Tirocinium, Beethoven learned how to add numbers but he could neither divide nor multiply. Throughout Beethoven's life, he instead used addition as a means of simulating multiplication (thus adding up a column of sixteen sevens, rather than multiplying 16 \u00d7 7).\n1780\u20131792: Bonn.\nIn 1780 or 1781, Beethoven began his studies with his most important teacher in Bonn, Christian Gottlob Neefe. Neefe taught him composition; in March 1783, Beethoven's first published work appeared, a set of keyboard variations (WoO 63). Beethoven soon began working with Neefe as assistant organist, at first unpaid (1782), and then as a paid employee (1784) of the court chapel. His first three piano sonatas, WoO 47, sometimes known as (Elector) for their dedication to Elector Maximilian Friedrich, were published in 1783. In the same year, the first printed reference to Beethoven appeared in the \"Magazin der Musik\" \u2013 \"Louis van Beethoven [sic]\u00a0... a boy of 11 years and most promising talent. He plays the piano very skilfully and with power, reads at sight very well\u00a0... the chief piece he plays is \"Das wohltemperierte Klavier\" of Sebastian Bach, which Herr Neefe puts into his hands\". Maximilian Friedrich's successor as Elector of Cologne was Maximilian Franz. He gave some support to Beethoven, appointing him Court Organist and assisting financially with Beethoven's move to Vienna in 1792.\nDuring this time, Beethoven met several people who became important in his life. He developed a close relationship with the upper-class von Breuning family, and gave piano lessons to some of the children. The widowed Helene von Breuning became a \"second mother\" to Beethoven, taught him more refined manners and nurtured his passion for literature and poetry. The warmth and closeness of the von Breuning family offered the young Beethoven a retreat from his unhappy home life, dominated by his father's decline due to alcoholism. Beethoven also met Franz Wegeler, a young medical student, who became a lifelong friend and married one of the von Breuning daughters. Another frequenter of the von Breunings was Count Ferdinand von Waldstein, who became a friend and financial supporter of Beethoven during this period. In 1791, Waldstein commissioned Beethoven's first work for the stage, the ballet \"Musik zu einem Ritterballett\" (WoO 1).\nThe period of 1785 to 1790 includes virtually no record of Beethoven's activity as a composer. This may be attributed to the varied response his initial publications attracted, and also to ongoing issues in his family. While passing through Augsburg, Beethoven visited with composer Anna von Schaden and her husband, who gave him money to return to Bonn to be with his ailing mother. Beethoven's mother died in July 1787, shortly after his return from Vienna, where he stayed for around two weeks and possibly met Mozart. In 1789, due to his chronic alcoholism, Beethoven's father was forced to retire from the service of the Court and it was ordered that half of his father's pension be paid directly to Ludwig for support of the family. Ludwig contributed further to the family's income by teaching (to which Wegeler said he had \"an extraordinary aversion\") and by playing viola in the court orchestra. This familiarised him with a variety of operas, including works by Mozart, Gluck and Paisiello. There he also befriended Anton Reicha, a composer, flutist, and violinist of about his own age who was a nephew of the court orchestra's conductor, Josef Reicha.\nFrom 1790 to 1792, Beethoven composed several works, only one of which (the piano variation set on Righini's \"Venni amore\", WoO 65) was published at the time; they showed a growing range and maturity. Musicologists have identified a theme similar to those of his Third Symphony in a set of variations written in 1791. It was perhaps on Neefe's recommendation that Beethoven received his first commissions; the Literary Society in Bonn commissioned a cantata to mark the recent death of Joseph II (WoO 87), and a further cantata, to celebrate the subsequent accession of Leopold II as Holy Roman Emperor (WoO 88), may have been commissioned by the Elector. These two \"Emperor Cantatas\" were not performed during Beethoven's lifetime and became lost until the 1880s, when Johannes Brahms called them \"Beethoven through and through\" and of the style that marked Beethoven's music distinct from the classical tradition.\nBeethoven was probably first introduced to Joseph Haydn in late 1790, when Haydn was travelling to London and made a brief stop in Bonn around Christmastime. In July 1792, they met again in Bonn on Haydn's return trip from London to Vienna, when Beethoven played in the orchestra at the Redoute in Godesberg. Arrangements were likely made at that time for Beethoven to study with Haydn. Waldstein wrote to Beethoven before his departure: \"You are going to Vienna in fulfilment of your long-frustrated wishes\u00a0... With the help of assiduous labour you shall receive Mozart's spirit from Haydn's hands.\"\n1792\u20131802: Vienna \u2013 the early years.\nBeethoven left Bonn for Vienna in November 1792 amid rumours of war spilling out of France. Shortly after departing, Beethoven learned that his father had died. Over the next few years, he responded to the widespread feeling that he was a successor to the recently deceased Mozart by studying Mozart's work and writing works with a distinctly Mozartian flavour.\nBeethoven did not immediately set out to establish himself as a composer but rather devoted himself to study and performance. Working under Haydn's direction, he sought to master counterpoint. He also studied violin under Ignaz Schuppanzigh. Early in this period, he also began receiving occasional instruction from Antonio Salieri, primarily in Italian vocal composition style; this relationship persisted until at least 1802, and possibly as late as 1809.\nWith Haydn's departure for England in 1794, Beethoven was expected by the Elector to return home to Bonn. He chose instead to remain in Vienna, continuing his instruction in counterpoint with Johann Albrechtsberger and other teachers. In any case, by this time it must have seemed clear to his employer that Bonn would fall to the French, as it did in October 1794, effectively leaving Beethoven without a stipend or the necessity to return. But several Viennese noblemen had already recognised his ability and offered him financial support, among them Prince Joseph Franz Lobkowitz, Prince Karl Lichnowsky, and Baron Gottfried van Swieten.\nAssisted by his connections with Haydn and Waldstein, Beethoven began to develop a reputation as a performer and improviser in the salons of the Viennese nobility. His friend Nikolaus Simrock began publishing his compositions, starting with a set of keyboard variations on a theme of Dittersdorf (WoO 66). By 1793, he had established a reputation in Vienna as a piano virtuoso, but he apparently withheld works from publication so that their eventual appearance would have greater impact.\nIn 1795, Beethoven made his public debut in Vienna over three days, beginning with a performance of one of his own piano concertos on 29 March at the Burgtheater and ending with an unspecified Mozart concerto on 31 March. By this year he had two piano concertos available for performance, one in B\u266d\u00a0major he had begun composing before moving to Vienna and had worked on for over a decade, and one in C\u00a0major composed for the most part during 1795. Viewing the latter as the more substantive work, he chose to designate it his first piano concerto, publishing it in March 1801 as Opus 15, before publishing the former as Opus 19 the following December. He wrote new cadenzas for both in 1809.\nShortly after his public debut, Beethoven arranged for the publication of the first of his compositions to which he assigned an opus number, the three piano trios, Opus 1. These works were dedicated to his patron Prince Lichnowsky and were a financial success; Beethoven's profits were nearly sufficient to cover his living expenses for a year. In 1799, Beethoven participated in (and won) a notorious piano 'duel' at the home of Baron Raimund Wetzlar (a former patron of Mozart) against the virtuoso Joseph W\u00f6lfl; and the next year he similarly triumphed against Daniel Steibelt at the salon of Count Moritz von Fries. Beethoven's eighth piano sonata, the \"Path\u00e9tique\" (Op. 13, published in 1799), is described by the musicologist Barry Cooper as \"surpass[ing] any of his previous compositions, in strength of character, depth of emotion, level of originality, and ingenuity of motivic and tonal manipulation\".Between 1798 and 1800, Beethoven composed his first six string quartets (Op. 18) (commissioned by, and dedicated to, Prince Lobkowitz), published in 1801. He also completed his Septet (Op. 20) in 1799, a work which was extremely popular during Beethoven's lifetime. With premieres of his First and Second Symphonies in 1800 and 1803, Beethoven became regarded as one of the most important of a generation of young composers following Haydn and Mozart. But his melodies, musical development, use of modulation and texture, and characterisation of emotion all set him apart from his influences, and heightened the impact some of his early works made when they were first published. For the premiere of his First Symphony, he hired the Burgtheater on 2 April 1800, and staged an extensive programme, including works by Haydn and Mozart, as well as his Septet, the Symphony, and one of his piano concertos (the latter three works all then unpublished). The concert, which the \"Allgemeine musikalische Zeitung\" called \"the most interesting concert in a long time\", was not without difficulties; among the criticisms was that \"the players did not bother to pay any attention to the soloist\". By the end of 1800, Beethoven and his music were already much in demand from patrons and publishers.\nIn May 1799, Beethoven taught piano to the daughters of Hungarian Countess Anna Brunsvik. During this time, he fell in love with the younger daughter, Josephine. Among his other students, from 1801 to 1805, he tutored Ferdinand Ries, who went on to become a composer and later wrote about their encounters. The young Carl Czerny, who later became a renowned pianist and music teacher himself, studied with Beethoven from 1801 to 1803. Czerny described his teacher at their initial meeting in 1801: Beethoven was dressed in a jacket of shaggy dark grey material and matching trousers, and he reminded me immediately of Campe's \"Robinson Crusoe\", whose book I was reading just then. His jet-black hair bristled shaggily around his head. His beard, unshaven for several days, made the lower part of his swarthy face still darker. In late 1801, Beethoven met a young countess, Julie Guicciardi, through the Brunsvik family; he mentions his love for Julie in a November 1801 letter to a friend, but class difference prevented any consideration of pursuing it. He dedicated his 1802 Sonata Op. 27 No. 2, now commonly known as the \"Moonlight Sonata\", to her.\nIn the spring of 1801, Beethoven completed a ballet, \"The Creatures of Prometheus\" (op. 43). The work received numerous performances in 1801 and 1802 and he rushed to publish a piano arrangement to capitalise on its early popularity. Beethoven completed his Second Symphony in 1802, intended for performance at a concert that was cancelled. The symphony received its premiere one year later, at a subscription concert in April 1803 at the Theater an der Wien, where Beethoven had been appointed composer in residence. In addition to the Second Symphony, the concert also featured the First Symphony, the Third Piano Concerto, and the oratorio \"Christ on the Mount of Olives\". Reviews of the concert were mixed, but it was a financial success; Beethoven was able to charge three times the cost of a typical concert ticket.\nIn 1802, Beethoven's brother Kaspar began to assist the composer in handling his affairs, particularly his business dealings with music publishers. In addition to successfully negotiating higher payments for Beethoven's latest works, Kaspar also began selling several of Beethoven's earlier unpublished compositions and encouraged his brother (against Beethoven's preference) to make arrangements and transcriptions of his more popular works for other instruments and combinations. Beethoven decided to accede to these requests, as he was powerless to prevent publishers from hiring others to do similar arrangements of his works.\n1802\u20131812: The \"heroic\" period.\nDeafness.\nBeethoven told the English pianist Charles Neate (in 1815) that his hearing loss began in 1798, during a heated quarrel with a singer. During its gradual decline, his hearing was further impeded by a severe form of tinnitus. As early as 1801, he wrote to Wegeler and another friend, Carl Amenda, describing his symptoms and the difficulties they caused in both professional and social settings (although it is likely some of his close friends were already aware of the issues). The cause was probably otosclerosis, possibly accompanied by degeneration of the auditory nerve.\nOn his doctor's advice, Beethoven moved to the small Austrian town of Heiligenstadt, just outside Vienna, from April to October 1802 in an attempt to come to terms with his condition. There he wrote the document now known as the Heiligenstadt Testament, a letter to his brothers that records his thoughts of suicide due to his growing deafness and his resolution to continue living for and through his art. The letter was never sent and was discovered in his papers after his death. The letters to Wegeler and Amenda were not so despairing; in them Beethoven commented also on his ongoing professional and financial success at this period, and his determination, as he expressed it to Wegeler, to \"seize Fate by the throat; it shall certainly not crush me completely\". In 1806, Beethoven noted on one of his musical sketches: \"Let your deafness no longer be a secret\u2014even in art.\"\nAlthough Beethoven's hearing loss did not prevent him from composing music, it made playing at concerts\u2014an important source of income at this phase of his life\u2014increasingly difficult. It also contributed substantially to his social withdrawal. Czerny remarked that Beethoven could still hear speech and music normally until 1812. Contrary to common belief, Beethoven never became totally deaf; in his final years, he was still able to distinguish low tones and sudden loud sounds.\nHeroic style.\nBeethoven's return to Vienna from Heiligenstadt was marked by a change in musical style, and is now often designated as the start of his middle or \"heroic\" period, characterised by many original works composed on a grand scale. According to Czerny, Beethoven said: \"I am not satisfied with the work I have done so far. From now on I intend to take a new way.\" An early major work employing this new style was the Third Symphony in E\u266d, Op. 55, known as the \"Eroica\", written in 1803\u201304. The idea of creating a symphony based on the career of Napoleon may have been suggested to Beethoven by General Bernadotte in 1798. Sympathetic to the ideal of the heroic revolutionary leader, Beethoven originally gave the symphony the title \"Bonaparte\", but disillusioned by Napoleon declaring himself Emperor in 1804, he scratched Napoleon's name from the manuscript's title page, and the symphony was published in 1806 with its present title and the subtitle \"to celebrate the memory of a great man\". The \"Eroica\" was longer and larger in scope than any previous symphony. When it premiered in early 1805 it received a mixed reception. Some listeners objected to its length or disliked its structure, while others viewed it as a masterpiece.\nOther middle-period works extend in the same dramatic manner the musical language Beethoven had inherited. The Rasumovsky string quartets and the \"Waldstein\" and \"Appassionata\" piano sonatas share the Third Symphony's heroic spirit. Other works of this period include the Fourth through Eighth Symphonies, the oratorio \"Christ on the Mount of Olives\", the opera \"Fidelio\", and the Violin Concerto. Beethoven was hailed in 1810 by the writer and composer E. T. A. Hoffmann, in an influential review in the \"Allgemeine musikalische Zeitung\", as the greatest of (what he considered) the three Romantic composers (that is, ahead of Haydn and Mozart); in Beethoven's Fifth Symphony his music, wrote Hoffmann, \"sets in motion terror, fear, horror, pain, and awakens the infinite yearning that is the essence of romanticism\".During this time, Beethoven's income came from publishing his works, from performances of them, and from his patrons, for whom he gave private performances and copies of works they commissioned for an exclusive period before their publication. Some of his early patrons, including Lobkowitz and Lichnowsky, gave him annual stipends in addition to commissioning works and purchasing published works. Perhaps his most important aristocratic patron was Archduke Rudolf of Austria, the youngest son of Emperor Leopold II, who in 1803 or 1804 began to study piano and composition with him. They became friends, and their meetings continued until 1824. Beethoven dedicated 14 compositions to Rudolf, including such major works as the \"Archduke\" Trio Op. 97 (1811).\nHis position at the Theater an der Wien was terminated when the theatre changed management in early 1804, and he was forced to move temporarily to the suburbs of Vienna with his friend Stephan von Breuning. This slowed work on \"Leonore\" (his original title for his opera), his largest work to date, for a time. It was delayed again by the Austrian censor and finally premiered, under its present title of \"Fidelio\", in November 1805 to houses that were nearly empty because of the French occupation of the city. In addition to being a financial failure, this version of \"Fidelio\" was also a critical failure, and Beethoven began revising it.\nDespite this failure, Beethoven continued to attract recognition. In 1807 the musician and publisher Muzio Clementi secured the rights to publish his works in England, and Haydn's former patron Prince Esterh\u00e1zy commissioned the Mass in C, Op. 86, for his wife's name-day. But he could not count on such recognition alone. A colossal benefit concert he organised in December 1808, widely advertised, included the premieres of the Fifth and Sixth (\"Pastoral\") symphonies, the Fourth Piano Concerto, extracts from the Mass in C, the scena and aria \"Ah! perfido\" Op. 65 and the \"Choral Fantasy\" op. 80. There was a large audience (including Czerny and the young Ignaz Moscheles), but it was under-rehearsed, involved many stops and starts, and during the Fantasia Beethoven was noted shouting at the musicians \"badly played, wrong, again!\" The financial outcome is unknown.\nIn the autumn of 1808, after having been rejected for a position at the Royal Theatre, Beethoven received an offer from Napoleon's brother J\u00e9r\u00f4me Bonaparte, then king of Westphalia, for a well-paid position as Kapellmeister at the court in Cassel. To persuade him to stay in Vienna, Archduke Rudolf, Prince Kinsky and Prince Lobkowitz, after receiving representations from Beethoven's friends, pledged to pay him a pension of 4000 florins a year. In the event, Rudolf paid his share of the pension on the agreed date. Kinsky, immediately called to military duty, did not contribute and died in November 1812 after falling from his horse. The Austrian currency destabilised and Lobkowitz went bankrupt in 1811 so that to benefit from the agreement Beethoven eventually had recourse to the law, which in 1815 brought him some recompense.\nThe imminence of war reaching Vienna itself was felt in early 1809. In April, Beethoven completed writing his Piano Concerto No. 5 in E\u266d major, Op. 73, which the musicologist Alfred Einstein has called \"the apotheosis of the military concept\" in Beethoven's music. Rudolf left the capital with the Imperial family in early May, prompting Beethoven's piano sonata \"Les Adieux\" (Sonata No. 26, Op. 81a), actually titled by Beethoven in German \"Das Lebewohl\" (The Farewell), of which the final movement, \"Das Wiedersehen\" (The Return), is dated in the manuscript with the date of Rudolf's homecoming of 30 January 1810. During the French bombardment of Vienna in May, Beethoven took refuge in the cellar of his brother Kaspar's house. The subsequent occupation of Vienna and disruptions to cultural life and to Beethoven's publishers, together with Beethoven's poor health at the end of 1809, explain his significantly reduced output during this period, although other notable works of the year include his String Quartet No. 10 in E\u266d major, Op. 74 (\"The Harp\") and the Piano Sonata No. 24 in F\u266f major, Op. 78, dedicated to Josephine's sister Therese Brunsvik.\nGoethe.\nAt the end of 1809, Beethoven was commissioned to write incidental music for Goethe's play \"Egmont\". The result (an overture, and nine additional entractes and vocal pieces, Op. 84), which appeared in 1810, fit well with Beethoven's heroic style and he became interested in Goethe, setting three of his poems as songs (Op. 83) and learning about him from a mutual acquaintance, Bettina Brentano (who also wrote to Goethe at this time about Beethoven). Other works of this period in a similar vein were the F minor String Quartet Op. 95, to which Beethoven gave the subtitle \"Quartetto serioso\", and the Op. 97 Piano Trio in B\u266d major, known from its dedication to his patron Rudolph, as the \"Archduke Trio\".\nIn the spring of 1811, Beethoven became seriously ill, with headaches and high fever. His doctor Johann Malfatti recommended he take a cure at the spa of Teplitz (now Teplice in the Czech Republic), where he wrote two more overtures and sets of incidental music for dramas, this time by August von Kotzebue \u2013 \"King Stephen\" Op. 117 and \"The Ruins of Athens\" Op. 113. Advised again to visit Teplitz in 1812, he met there with Goethe, who wrote: \"His talent amazed me; unfortunately he is an utterly untamed personality, who is not altogether wrong in holding the world to be detestable, but surely does not make it any more enjoyable\u00a0... by his attitude.\" Beethoven wrote to his publishers Breitkopf and H\u00e4rtel, \"Goethe delights far too much in the court atmosphere, far more than is becoming in a poet.\" But following their meeting he began a setting for choir and orchestra of Goethe's \"Meeresstille und gl\u00fcckliche Fahrt\" \"(Calm Sea and Prosperous Voyage)\", Op. 112, completed in 1815. After it was published in 1822 with a dedication to the poet, Beethoven wrote to him: \"The admiration, the love and esteem which already in my youth I cherished for the one and only immortal Goethe have persisted.\"\nThe Immortal Beloved.\nWhile Beethoven was at Teplitz in 1812, he wrote a ten-page love letter to his \"Immortal Beloved\", which he never sent to its addressee. The identity of the intended recipient was long a subject of debate, although the musicologist Maynard Solomon has argued that the intended recipient was Antonie Brentano; other candidates included Julie Guicciardi, Therese Malfatti and Josephine Brunsvik.\nAll of these had been regarded by Beethoven as possible soulmates during his first decade in Vienna. Guicciardi, although she flirted with Beethoven, never had any serious interest in him and married Wenzel Robert von Gallenberg in November 1803. (Beethoven insisted to his later secretary and biographer, Anton Schindler, that Guicciardi had \"sought me out, crying, but I scorned her\".) Josephine had, since Beethoven's initial infatuation with her, married the elderly Count Joseph Deym, who died in 1804. Beethoven began to visit her and commenced a passionate correspondence. Initially, he accepted that Josephine could not love him, but he continued to address himself to her even after she had moved to Budapest, finally demonstrating that he had got the message in his last letter to her of 1807: \"I thank you for wishing still to appear as if I were not altogether banished from your memory\". Malfatti was the niece of Beethoven's doctor, and he had proposed to her in 1810. He was 40, and she was 19. The proposal was rejected. She is now remembered as the possible recipient of the piano bagatelle known as \"F\u00fcr Elise\".\nAntonie (Toni) Brentano (n\u00e9e von Birkenstock), ten years younger than Beethoven, was the wife of Franz Dominicus Brentano, the half-brother of Bettina Brentano, who provided Beethoven's introduction to the family. It would seem that Antonie and Beethoven had an affair during 1811\u20131812. Antonie left Vienna with her husband in late 1812 and never met with (or apparently corresponded with) Beethoven again, although in her later years, she wrote and spoke fondly of him. Some speculate that Beethoven was the father of Antonie's son Karl Josef; \"the boy, born in 1813 and never seen by the composer, became ill aged four with a condition that limited his movements and mental capacity.\"\nAfter 1812 there are no reports of any romantic liaisons of Beethoven's; however, it is clear from his correspondence of the period and, later, from the conversation books, that he occasionally had sex with prostitutes.\n1813\u20131822: Acclaim.\nFamily issues.\nIn early 1813, Beethoven apparently went through a difficult emotional period, and his compositional output dropped. His personal appearance degraded\u2014it had generally been neat\u2014as did his manners in public, notably when dining.\nFamily issues may have played a part in this. Beethoven had visited his brother Johann at the end of October 1812. He wished to end Johann's cohabitation with Therese Obermayer, a woman who already had an illegitimate child. He was unable to convince Johann to end the relationship and appealed to the local civic and religious authorities, but Johann and Therese married on 8 November.\nThe illness and eventual death of his brother Kaspar from tuberculosis became an increasing concern. Kaspar had been ill for some time; in 1813 Beethoven lent him 1500 florins, to procure the repayment of which he was ultimately led to complex legal measures. After Kaspar died on 15 November 1815, Beethoven immediately became embroiled in a protracted legal dispute with Kaspar's widow Johanna over custody of their son Karl, then nine years old. Beethoven had successfully applied to Kaspar to have himself named the sole guardian of the boy. A late codicil to Kaspar's will gave him and Johanna joint guardianship. While Beethoven was successful at having his nephew removed from her custody in January 1816 and had him removed to a private school, in 1818, he was again preoccupied with the legal processes around Karl. While giving evidence to the court for the nobility, the Landrechte, Beethoven was unable to prove that he was of noble birth and as a consequence, on 18 December 1818 the case was transferred to the civil magistrate of Vienna, where he lost sole guardianship. He regained custody after intensive legal struggles in 1820. During the years that followed, Beethoven frequently interfered in his nephew's life in what Karl perceived as an overbearing manner.\nPost-war Vienna.\nBeethoven was finally motivated to begin significant composition again in June 1813 when news arrived of the French defeat at the Battle of Vitoria by a coalition led by the Duke of Wellington. The inventor Johann Nepomuk Maelzel persuaded him to write a work commemorating the event for his mechanical instrument the Panharmonicon. This Beethoven also transcribed for orchestra as \"Wellington's Victory\" (Op. 91, also known as the \"Battle Symphony\"). It was first performed on 8 December, along with his Seventh Symphony, Op. 92, at a charity concert for victims of the war, a concert whose success led to its repeat on 12 December. The orchestra included several leading and rising musicians who happened to be in Vienna at the time, including Giacomo Meyerbeer and Domenico Dragonetti. The work received repeat performances at concerts staged by Beethoven in January and February 1814. These concerts brought Beethoven more profit than any others in his career and enabled him to buy the bank shares that were the most valuable assets in his estate at his death.\nBeethoven's renewed popularity led to demands for a revival of \"Fidelio\", which, in its third revised version, was also well received at its July opening in Vienna, and was frequently staged there during the following years. Beethoven's publisher, Artaria, commissioned the 20-year-old Moscheles to prepare a piano score of the opera, which he inscribed \"Finished, with God's help!\"\u2014to which Beethoven added \"O Man, help thyself.\" That summer Beethoven composed a piano sonata for the first time in five years, his Sonata in E minor, Opus 90. He was also one of many composers who produced music in a patriotic vein to entertain the many heads of state and diplomats who came to the Congress of Vienna that began in November 1814, with the cantata \"Der glorreiche Augenblick (The Glorious Moment)\" (Op. 136) and similar choral works which, in the words of Maynard Solomon, \"broadened Beethoven's popularity, [but] did little to enhance his reputation as a serious composer\".\nIn April and May 1814, playing in his \"Archduke\" Trio, Beethoven made his last public appearances as a soloist. The composer Louis Spohr noted: \"the piano was badly out of tune, which Beethoven minded little, since he did not hear it\u00a0... there was scarcely anything left of the virtuosity of the artist\u00a0... I was deeply saddened.\" From 1814 onward, Beethoven used for conversation ear-trumpets designed by Johann Nepomuk Maelzel (a number of these are on display at the Beethoven-Haus in Bonn).\nHis 1815 compositions include an expressive second setting of the poem \"An die Hoffnung\" (Op. 94) in 1815. Compared to its first setting in 1805 (a gift for Josephine Brunsvik), it was \"far more dramatic\u00a0... The entire spirit is that of an operatic scena.\" But his energy seemed to be dropping: apart from these works, he wrote the two cello sonatas Op. 102 nos. 1 and 2, and a few minor pieces, and began but abandoned a sixth piano concerto.\nPause.\nBetween 1815 and 1819, Beethoven's output dropped again to a level unique in his mature life. He attributed part of this to a lengthy illness that he called an inflammatory fever that he had for more than a year starting in October 1816. Solomon suggests it is also doubtless a consequence of the ongoing legal problems concerning his nephew Karl, and of Beethoven finding himself increasingly at odds with current musical trends. Unsympathetic to developments in German romanticism that featured the supernatural (as in operas by Spohr, Heinrich Marschner and Carl Maria von Weber), he also \"resisted the impending Romantic fragmentation of the\u00a0... cyclic forms of the Classical era into small forms and lyric mood pieces\" and turned towards study of Bach, Handel and Palestrina. An old connection was renewed in 1817 when Maelzel sought, and obtained, Beethoven's endorsement for his newly developed metronome. During these years the few major works he completed include the 1818 \"Hammerklavier\" Sonata (Sonata No. 29 in B\u266d major, Op. 106) and his settings of poems by Alois Jeitteles, \"An die ferne Geliebte\" Op. 98 (1816), which introduced the song cycle into classical repertoire. In 1818, he began musical sketches that eventually formed part of his Ninth Symphony.\nBy early 1818, Beethoven's health had improved, and his nephew Karl, now aged 11, moved in with him in January (although within a year Karl's mother had won him back in the courts). By now, Beethoven's hearing had again seriously deteriorated, necessitating that he and his interlocutors write in notebooks to carry out conversations. These 'conversation books' are a rich written resource for his life from this period onward. They contain discussions about music, business, and personal life; they are also a valuable source for his contacts and for investigations into how he intended his music should be performed, and of his opinions of the art of music. His household management had also improved somewhat with the help of Nannette Streicher. A proprietor of the Stein piano workshop and a personal friend, Streicher had assisted in Beethoven's care during his illness; she continued to provide some support, and in her he finally found a skilled cook. A testimonial to the esteem in which Beethoven was held in England was the presentation to him in this year by Thomas Broadwood, the proprietor of the company, of a Broadwood piano, for which Beethoven expressed thanks. He was not well enough, however, to carry out a visit to London that year which had been proposed by the Philharmonic Society.\nResurgence.\nDespite the time occupied by his ongoing legal struggles over Karl, which involved continuing extensive correspondence and lobbying, two events sparked off Beethoven's major composition projects in 1819. The first was the announcement of Archduke Rudolf's promotion to Cardinal-Archbishop as Archbishop of Olomouc (now in the Czech Republic), which triggered the Missa solemnis Op. 123 (1823), intended to be ready for his installation in Olomouc in March 1820. The other was the invitation by the publisher Antonio Diabelli to 50 Viennese composers, including Beethoven, Franz Schubert, Czerny and the 8-year-old Franz Liszt, to compose a variation each on a theme which he provided. Beethoven was spurred to outdo the competition and by mid-1819 had already completed 20 variations of what were to become the 33 \"Diabelli Variations\" op. 120. Neither of these works was completed for a few years. A significant tribute of 1819, however, was Archduke Rudolf's set of 40 piano variations on a theme written for him by Beethoven (WoO 200) and dedicated to the master. Beethoven's portrait by Ferdinand Schimon of this year, which was one of the most familiar images of him for the next century, was described by Schindler as, despite its artistic weaknesses, \"in the rendering of that particular look, the majestic forehead\u00a0... the firmly shut mouth and the chin shaped like a shell,\u00a0... truer to nature than any other picture\". Joseph Karl Stieler also created his own portrait of Beethoven.\nBeethoven's determination over the following years to write the \"Mass\" for Rudolf was not motivated by any devout Catholicism. Although he had been born a Catholic, the form of religion as practised at the court in Bonn where he grew up was, in the words of Solomon, \"a compromise ideology that permitted a relatively peaceful coexistence between the Church and rationalism\". Beethoven's \"Tagebuch\" (a diary he kept on an occasional basis between 1812 and 1818) shows his interest in a variety of religious philosophies, including those of India, Egypt and the Orient and the writings of the Rig-Veda. In a letter to Rudolf of July 1821, Beethoven shows his belief in a personal God: \"God\u00a0... sees into my innermost heart and knows that as a man I perform most conscientiously and on all occasions the duties which Humanity, God, and Nature enjoin upon me.\" On one of the sketches for the Missa solemnis he wrote \"Plea for inner and outer peace\".\nBeethoven's status was confirmed by the series of \"Concerts sprituels\" given in Vienna by the choirmaster Franz Xaver Gebauer in the 1819/1820 and 1820/1821 seasons, during which all eight of his symphonies to date, plus the oratorio \"Christus\" and the Mass in C, were performed. Beethoven was typically underwhelmed: when in an April 1820 conversation book a friend mentioned Gebauer, Beethoven wrote in reply \"Geh! Bauer\" (Begone, peasant!)\nIn 1819, Beethoven was first approached by the publisher Moritz Schlesinger, who won the suspicious composer round, while visiting him at M\u00f6dling, by procuring for him a plate of roast veal. One consequence of this was that Schlesinger secured Beethoven's three last piano sonatas and his final quartets; part of the attraction to Beethoven was that Schlesinger had publishing facilities in Germany and France, and connections in England, which could overcome problems of copyright piracy. The first of the three sonatas, for which Beethoven contracted with Schlesinger in 1820 at 30 ducats per sonata (further delaying completion of the Mass), was sent to the publisher at the end of that year (the Sonata in E major, Op. 109, dedicated to Maximiliane von Blittersdorf, Antonie Brentano's daughter).\nIn early 1821, Beethoven was once again in poor health with rheumatism and jaundice. Despite this, he continued work on the remaining piano sonatas he had promised to Schlesinger (the Sonata in A\u266d major Op. 110 was published in December), and on the Mass. In early 1822 Beethoven sought a reconciliation with his brother Johann, whose marriage in 1812 had met with his disapproval, and Johann now became a regular visitor (as witnessed by the conversation books of the period) and began to assist him in his business affairs, including lending him money against ownership of some of his compositions. He also sought some reconciliation with the mother of his nephew, including supporting her income, although this did not meet with the approval of the contrary Karl. Two commissions at the end of 1822 improved Beethoven's financial prospects. In November the Philharmonic Society of London offered a commission for a symphony, which he accepted with delight, as an appropriate home for the Ninth Symphony on which he was working. Also in November Prince Nikolai Galitzin of Saint Petersburg offered to pay Beethoven's asking price for three string quartets. Beethoven set the price at the high level of 50 ducats per quartet in a letter dictated to his nephew Karl, who was then living with him.\nDuring 1822, Anton Schindler, who in 1840 became one of Beethoven's earliest and most influential (but not always reliable) biographers, began to work as the composer's unpaid secretary. He later claimed that he had been a member of Beethoven's circle since 1814, but there is no evidence for this. Cooper suggests that \"Beethoven greatly appreciated his assistance, but did not think much of him as a man\".\n1823\u20131827: final years.\nThe year 1823 saw the completion of three notable works, all of which had occupied Beethoven for some years: the Missa solemnis, the Ninth Symphony, and the \"Diabelli Variations\".\nBeethoven at last presented the manuscript of the completed Missa solemnis to Rudolph on 19 March (more than a year after the archduke's enthronement as archbishop). But he was in no hurry to get it published or performed as he had formed a notion that he could profitably sell manuscripts of the work to various courts in Germany and Europe at 50 ducats each. One of the few who took up this offer was Louis XVIII of France, who also sent Beethoven a heavy gold medallion. The Symphony and the variations took up most of the rest of Beethoven's working year. Diabelli hoped to publish both works, but the potential prize of the Mass excited many other publishers to lobby Beethoven for it, including Schlesinger and Carl Friedrich Peters. (In the end, it was obtained by Schotts).\nBeethoven had become critical of the Viennese reception of his works. He told the visiting Johann Friedrich Rochlitz in 1822:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;You will hear nothing of me here\u00a0... \"Fidelio\"? They cannot give it, nor do they want to listen to it. The symphonies? They have no time for them. My concertos? Everyone grinds out only the stuff he himself has made. The solo pieces? They went out of fashion long ago, and here fashion is everything. At the most, Schuppanzigh occasionally digs up a quartet.\nHe therefore inquired about premiering the Missa and the Ninth Symphony in Berlin. When his Viennese admirers learnt of this, they pleaded with him to arrange local performances. Beethoven was won over, and the symphony was first performed, along with sections of the Missa solemnis, on 7 May 1824, to great acclaim at the K\u00e4rntnertortheater. Beethoven stood by the conductor Michael Umlauf during the concert beating time (although Umlauf had warned the singers and orchestra to ignore him), and because of his deafness was not even aware of the applause which followed until he was turned to witness it. The \"Allgemeine musikalische Zeitung\" gushed, \"inexhaustible genius had shown us a new world\", and Carl Czerny wrote that the Symphony \"breathes such a fresh, lively, indeed youthful spirit\u00a0... so much power, innovation, and beauty as ever [came] from the head of this original man, although he certainly sometimes led the old wigs to shake their heads\". The concert did not net Beethoven much money, as the expenses of mounting it were very high. A second concert on 24 May, in which the producer guaranteed him a minimum fee, was poorly attended; nephew Karl noted that \"many people [had] already gone into the country\". It was Beethoven's last public concert. Beethoven accused Schindler of either cheating him or mismanaging the ticket receipts; this led to the replacement of Schindler as Beethoven's secretary by Karl Holz, the second violinist in the Schuppanzigh Quartet, although by 1826 Beethoven and Schindler reconciled.\nBeethoven then turned to writing the string quartets for Galitzin, despite failing health. The first of these, the Quartet in E\u266d major, Op. 127 was premiered by the Schuppanzigh Quartet in March 1825. While writing the next, the Quartet in A minor, Op. 132, in April 1825, he was struck by a sudden illness. Recuperating in Baden, he included in the quartet its slow movement to which he gave the title \"Holy song of thanks (Heiliger Dankgesang) to the Divinity, from a convalescent, in the Lydian mode\". The next quartet to be completed was the Quartet in B\u266d major, Op. 130. In six movements, the last, contrapuntal movement proved very difficult for both the performers and the audience at its premiere in March 1826 (again by the Schuppanzigh Quartet). Beethoven was persuaded by the publisher Artaria, for an additional fee, to write a new finale, and to issue the last movement as a separate work (the \"Grosse Fugue\", Op. 133). Beethoven's favourite was the last of this series, the Quartet in C\u266f minor, Op. 131, which he rated as his most perfect single work.\nBeethoven's relations with his nephew Karl had continued to be stormy; Beethoven's letters to him were demanding and reproachful. In August, Karl, who had been seeing his mother again against Beethoven's wishes, attempted suicide by shooting himself in the head. He survived and after discharge from hospital went to recuperate in the village of Gneixendorf with Beethoven and his uncle Johann. In Gneixendorf, Beethoven completed a further quartet (Quartet in F major, Op. 135), which he sent to Schlesinger. Under the introductory slow chords in the last movement, Beethoven wrote in the manuscript \"Muss es sein?\" (Must it be?); the response, over the faster main theme of the movement, is \"Es muss sein!\" (It must be!). The whole movement is headed \"Der schwer gefasste Entschluss\" (The difficult decision). Following this in November Beethoven completed his final composition, the replacement finale for the op. 130 quartet. Beethoven at this time was already ill and depressed; he began to quarrel with Johann, insisting that Johann make Karl his heir, in preference to Johann's wife.\nDeath.\nOn his return journey to Vienna from Gneixendorf in December 1826, illness struck Beethoven again. He was attended until his death by Andreas Ignaz Wawruch, who throughout December noticed symptoms including fever, jaundice and dropsy, with swollen limbs, coughing and breathing difficulties. Several operations were carried out to tap off the excess fluid from Beethoven's abdomen. Karl stayed by Beethoven's bedside during December but left after the beginning of January to join the army at Iglau and did not see his uncle again, although he wrote to him shortly afterwards: \"My dear father\u00a0... I am living in contentment and regret only that I am separated from you.\" Immediately following Karl's departure, Beethoven wrote a will making his nephew his sole heir.\nLater in January, Beethoven was attended by Dr. Malfatti, whose treatment (recognizing the seriousness of his patient's condition) was largely centred on alcohol. As the news spread of the severity of Beethoven's condition, many old friends came to visit, including Diabelli, Schuppanzigh, Lichnowsky, Schindler, the composer Johann Nepomuk Hummel, and his pupil Ferdinand Hiller. Many tributes and gifts were also sent, including \u00a3100 from the Philharmonic Society in London and a case of expensive wine from Schotts. During this period, Beethoven was almost completely bedridden despite occasional efforts to rouse himself. On 24 March he was given the Last Rites by a Roman Catholic priest. On 24 March, he said to Schindler and the others present: \"Plaudite, amici, comoedia finita est\" (\"Applaud, friends, the comedy is over\"). Later that day, when the wine from Schotts arrived, he whispered, \"Pity \u2013 too late.\"\nBeethoven died on 26 March 1827 at the age of 56; only his friend Anselm H\u00fcttenbrenner and a \"Frau van Beethoven\" (possibly his old enemy Johanna van Beethoven) were present. According to H\u00fcttenbrenner, at about 5\u00a0pm there was a flash of lightning and a clap of thunder: \"Beethoven opened his eyes, lifted his right hand and looked up for several seconds with his fist clenched\u00a0... not another breath, not a heartbeat more.\" Many visitors came to the deathbed; some locks of the dead man's hair were retained by H\u00fcttenbrenner and Hiller, among others. An autopsy revealed Beethoven had significant liver damage, which may have been due to his heavy alcohol consumption, and also considerable dilation of the auditory and other related nerves.\nBeethoven's funeral procession in Vienna on 29 March 1827 was attended by an estimated 10,000 people. Franz Schubert and the violinist Joseph Mayseder were among the torchbearers. A funeral oration by the poet Franz Grillparzer (who would also write Schubert's epitaph) was read by the actor Heinrich Ansch\u00fctz. Beethoven was buried in the W\u00e4hring cemetery, north-west of Vienna, after a requiem mass at the church of the Holy Trinity (Dreifaltigkeitskirche) in Alserstrasse. Beethoven's remains were exhumed for study in 1863, and moved in 1888 to Vienna's Zentralfriedhof where they were reinterred in a grave adjacent to that of Schubert.\nMusic.\nThe three periods.\nThe historian William Drabkin notes that as early as 1818 a writer had proposed a three-period division of Beethoven's works and that such a division (albeit often adopting different dates or works to denote changes in period) eventually became a convention adopted by all of Beethoven's biographers, starting with Schindler, F.-J. F\u00e9tis and Wilhelm von Lenz. Later writers sought to identify sub-periods within this generally accepted structure. Its drawbacks include that it generally omits a fourth period, that is, the early years in Bonn, whose works are less often considered; and that it ignores the differential development of Beethoven's composing styles over the years for different categories of work. The piano sonatas, for example, were written throughout Beethoven's life in a progression that can be interpreted as continuous development; the symphonies do not all demonstrate linear progress; of all of the types of composition, perhaps the quartets, which seem to group themselves in three periods (Op. 18 in 1801\u20131802, Opp. 59, 74 and 95 in 1806\u20131814, and the quartets, today known as 'late', from 1824 onwards) fit this categorisation most neatly. Drabkin concludes that \"now that we have lived with them so long\u00a0... as long as there are programme notes, essays written to accompany recordings, and all-Beethoven recitals, it is hard to imagine us ever giving up the notion of discrete stylistic periods.\"\nBonn 1782\u20131792.\nSome forty compositions, including ten very early works written by Beethoven up to 1785, survive from the years that Beethoven lived in Bonn. It has been suggested that Beethoven largely abandoned composition between 1785 and 1790, possibly as a result of negative critical reaction to his first published works. A 1784 review in Johann Nikolaus Forkel's influential \"Musikalischer Almanack\" compared Beethoven's efforts to those of rank beginners. The three early piano quartets of 1785 (WoO 36), closely modelled on violin sonatas of Mozart, show his dependency on the music of the period. Beethoven himself was not to give any of the Bonn works an opus number, save for those which he reworked for use later in his career, for example, some of the songs in his Op. 52 collection (1805) and the Wind Octet reworked in Vienna in 1793 to become his String Quintet, Op. 4. Charles Rosen points out that Bonn was something of a backwater compared to Vienna; Beethoven was unlikely to be acquainted with the mature works of Haydn or Mozart, and Rosen opines that his early style was closer to that of Hummel or Muzio Clementi. Kernan suggests that at this stage Beethoven was not especially notable for his works in sonata style, but more for his vocal music; his move to Vienna in 1792 set him on the path to develop the music in the genres he became known for.\nFirst period.\nThe conventional first period began after Beethoven's arrival in Vienna in 1792. In the first few years, he seems to have composed less than he did at Bonn, and his Piano Trios, op.1 were not published until 1795. From this point onward, he had mastered the 'Viennese style' (best known today from Haydn and Mozart) and was making the style his own. His works from 1795 to 1800 are larger in scale than was the norm (writing sonatas in four movements, not three, for instance); typically he uses a scherzo rather than a minuet and trio; and his music often includes dramatic, even sometimes over-the-top, uses of extreme dynamics and tempi and chromatic harmony. It was this that led Haydn to believe the third trio of Op.1 was too difficult for an audience to appreciate.\nHe also explored new directions and gradually expanded the scope and ambition of his work. Some important pieces from the early period are the first and second symphonies, the set of six string quartets Opus 18, the first two piano concertos, and the first twenty piano sonatas, including the famous \"Path\u00e9tique\" sonata, Op. 13.\nMiddle period.\nHis middle period began shortly after the personal crisis brought on by his recognition of encroaching deafness. It includes large-scale works that express heroism and struggle. Middle-period works include six symphonies (Nos. 3\u20138), the last two piano concertos, the Triple Concerto and violin concerto, five string quartets (Nos. 7\u201311), several piano sonatas (including the Op. 53 and Op. 57 sonatas), the \"Kreutzer\" violin sonata and his only opera, \"Fidelio\".\nThis period is sometimes associated with a \"heroic\" manner of composing, but the use of the term \"heroic\" has become increasingly controversial in Beethoven scholarship. The term is more frequently used as an alternative name for the middle period. The appropriateness of the term heroic to describe the whole middle period has been questioned as well: while some works, like the Third and Fifth Symphonies, are easy to describe as heroic, many others, like his Symphony No. 6, \"Pastoral\" or his Piano Sonata No. 24, are not.\nLate period.\nBeethoven's late period began in the decade 1810\u20131819. He began a renewed study of older music, including works by Palestrina, Johann Sebastian Bach, and George Frideric Handel, whom Beethoven considered \"the greatest composer who ever lived\". Beethoven's late works incorporated polyphony, church modes, and Baroque-era devices. For example, the overture \"The Consecration of the House\" (1822) included a fugue influenced by Handel's music. A new style emerged, as he returned to the keyboard to compose his first piano sonatas in almost a decade; the works of the late period include the last five piano sonatas and the \"Diabelli Variations\", the last two sonatas for cello and piano, the late string quartets (including the massive \"Gro\u00dfe Fuge\"), and two works for very large forces: the Missa solemnis and the Ninth Symphony. Works from this period are characterised by their intellectual depth, their formal innovations, and their intense, highly personal expression. The String Quartet, Op. 131 has seven linked movements, and the Ninth Symphony adds choral forces to the orchestra in the last movement.\nBeethoven's pianos.\nBeethoven's earlier preferred pianos included those of Johann Andreas Stein; he may have been given a Stein piano by Count Waldstein. From 1786 onwards there is evidence of Beethoven's cooperation with Johann Andreas Streicher, who had married Stein's daughter Nannette. Streicher left Stein's business to set up his own firm in 1803, and Beethoven continued to admire his products, writing to him in 1817 of his \"special preference\" for his pianos. Among the other pianos Beethoven possessed was an \u00c9rard piano given to him by the manufacturer in 1803. The \u00c9rard piano, with its exceptional resonance, may have influenced Beethoven's piano style \u2013 shortly after receiving it he began writing his Waldstein Sonata \u2013 but despite initial enthusiasm he seems to have abandoned it before 1810 when he wrote that it was \"simply not of any use any more\"; in 1824 he gave it to his brother Johann. In 1818 Beethoven received, also as a gift, a grand piano by John Broadwood &amp; Sons. Although Beethoven was proud to receive it, he seems to have been dissatisfied by its tone (a dissatisfaction which was perhaps also a consequence of his increasing deafness), and sought to get it remodelled to make it louder. In 1825 Beethoven commissioned a piano from Conrad Graf, which was equipped with quadruple strings and a special resonator to make it audible to him, but it failed in this task.\nLegacy.\nMuseums.\nThere is a museum\u2014the Beethoven House, in the place of his birth in Bonn. Bonn has also hosted a musical festival, the Beethovenfest, since 1845. The festival was initially irregular but since 2007 has been organised annually.\nTwo museums in Vienna are devoted to Beethoven. The Beethoven Museum in Probusgasse is where he wrote the Heiligenstadt Testament and the first sketches for the Eroica symphony. The Pasqualatihaus (M\u00f6lker Bastei 8) was his most enduring place of residence in Vienna, and is where he wrote the final versions of his Symphonies no. 5 and 6.\nThe Ira F. Brilliant Center for Beethoven Studies, in the Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Library, on the campus of San Jose State University, California, serves as a museum, research centre, and host of lectures and performances devoted solely to Beethoven's life and works.\nSculptures.\nThe Beethoven Monument in Bonn was unveiled in August 1845, in honour of the 75th anniversary of Beethoven's birth. It was the first statue of a composer created in Germany, and the music festival that accompanied the unveiling was the impetus for the swift construction of the original Beethovenhalle in Bonn (it was designed and built within less than a month, on the urging of Franz Liszt). Vienna honoured Beethoven with a statue in 1880.\nOther.\nThe Beethoven Conservatory in St. Louis, Missouri, was named for the composer.\nIn 2001, Beethoven's manuscript of the Symphony No. 9 became the first musical score added to the Memory of the World International Register established by UNESCO.\nReferences.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nExternal links.\nScores\nBooks"}

He was ranked as the world No. 1 in men's singles by the Association of Tennis Professionals (ATP) for 80 weeks, including as the year-end No. 1 in 2001 and 2002. Hewitt won 30 singles titles and 3 doubles titles on the ATP Tour, including two singles majors at the 2001 US Open and 2002 Wimbledon Championships, a doubles major at the 2000 US Open, the 2001 and 2002 Tennis Masters Cups in singles, and led Australia to Davis Cup crowns in 1999 and 2003. In November 2001, Hewitt became (at the time) the youngest man to reach No. 1 in the ATP singles rankings, at the age of . He was also the runner-up at the 2004 US Open and 2005 Australian Open. As of the end of 2025, he remains the most recent Australian man to win a singles major.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:TOC limit/styles.css\" /&gt;\nEarly life.\nHewitt was born in Adelaide, South Australia. His father, Glynn, is a former Australian rules football player, and his mother, Cherilyn, was a physical education teacher. He has a younger sister, Jaslyn, a former tennis coach and bodybuilder, and his brother-in-law (Jaslyn's husband) is Rob Shehadie, an actor and comedian.. Hewitt also played Australian Football until the age of 13, when he decided to pursue a tennis career. His junior tennis club was Seaside Tennis Club in Henley Beach. He was also coached by Peter Smith at Denman Tennis Club in Mitcham.\nTennis career.\nJunior years.\nAs a junior Hewitt posted a 44\u201319 record in singles and reached as high as No. 17 in the world in 1997 (and No. 13 in doubles).\n1998-1999: Early pro career.\nHewitt commenced his professional career in 1998. He became one of the youngest winners of an Association of Tennis Professionals (ATP) tournament when he won the 1998 Next Generation Adelaide International, defeating Jason Stoltenberg in the final, having defeated Andre Agassi in the semi-finals. Both Aaron Krickstein winning Tel Aviv in 1983 and Michael Chang winning San Francisco in 1988 were younger than Hewitt when they claimed their first ATP title. Hewitt then left Immanuel College to concentrate on his tennis career. He was an Australian Institute of Sport scholarship holder.\n2000: US Open doubles title, Davis Cup finals.\nIn 2000, Hewitt reached his first Grand Slam final at the Wimbledon mixed doubles partnering Belgian Kim Clijsters, his then girlfriend. They lost the match, to Americans Kimberly Po and Donald Johnson. Hewitt later won his first Grand Slam title at the US Open when he along with Max Mirnyi claimed the men's doubles championship, thus becoming the youngest male (at 19 years, 6 months) to win a Grand Slam doubles crown in the open era. At the end of the year, Hewitt became the first teenager in ATP history to qualify for the year-end Tennis Masters Cup (ATP World Tour Finals).\n2001: US Open title, Masters Cup trophy, No. 1.\nHewitt started off the 2001 season well by winning the title in Sydney. He went on to win back-to-back tournaments in Queen's and 's-Hertogenbosch. He captured his first Grand Slam singles title at the US Open, comprehensively defeating former world No. 1 Yevgeny Kafelnikov in the semi-finals, and four-time champion Pete Sampras the next day in straight sets (7-6, 6-1, 6-1). This win made Hewitt the most recent male player to win a Grand Slam singles and doubles title during his career. The Australian went on to win the Tokyo Open, and he again qualified for the year-end Tennis Masters Cup, held in Sydney. During the tournament, Hewitt won all matches in his group; with his round-robin victory against Pat Rafter, Hewitt secured the year-end world No. 1 ranking for the first time. Hewitt went on to defeat S\u00e9bastien Grosjean in the final to take the title and cement his position as the world number one.\n2002: Wimbledon victory and No. 1.\n2002 started with disappointment for Hewitt, as he lost in the first round of the Australian Open, his home Grand Slam. This was the first time the number 1 seed had lost in the opening round of the Australia Open, although Hewitt was still recovering from chickenpox. The next few months proved more successful for Hewitt and he cemented his position as the best player in the world by winning three titles: San Jose, Indian Wells and Queen's. His victory against Andre Agassi in the final of San Jose was heralded as one of the greatest matches of the season. He followed his 2001 US Open win by capturing the Wimbledon singles title. He defeated Jonas Bj\u00f6rkman, Gr\u00e9gory Carraz, Julian Knowle, Mikhail Youzhny, Sjeng Schalken and dispatched home favourite Tim Henman - a rematch of their recent Queen's final - before dominating first-time finalist David Nalbandian in straight sets in the championship match; Hewitt lost only two sets (both to Schalken) throughout the championship. His victory reinforced the idea that, although the tournament had tended to be dominated by serve-and-volleyers, a baseliner could still triumph on grass (Hewitt was the first 'baseliner' to win the tournament since Agassi in 1992). Hewitt was the last man outside the so-called \"Big Four\" to win Wimbledon until Carlos Alcaraz in 2023.\nFor his third straight year, he qualified for the year-end Tennis Masters Cup, held in Shanghai, and successfully defended his title by defeating Juan Carlos Ferrero in the final. Hewitt's win helped him finish the year ranked No. 1 for a second straight year, becoming the seventh man to achieve this feat.\n2003: Second Masters and Davis Cup titles.\nIn 2003, Hewitt defeated former No. 1 Gustavo Kuerten for the championship at Indian Wells. But at Wimbledon, as the defending champion, Hewitt lost in the first round to qualifier Ivo Karlovi\u0107. Hewitt became the first defending Wimbledon men's champion in the open era to lose in the first round. Only once before in the tournament's 126-year history had a defending men's champion lost in the opening round: in 1967, when Manuel Santana was beaten by Charlie Pasarell. Hewitt was only the third defending Grand Slam champion in the open era to lose in the first round, after Boris Becker at the 1997 Australian Open and Patrick Rafter at the 1999 US Open. After Wimbledon in 2003, Hewitt lost in the final of the tournament in Los Angeles, the second round of the ATP Masters Series tournament in Montreal, and the first round of the ATP Masters Series tournament in Cincinnati. At the US Open, Hewitt lost in the quarterfinals to Juan Carlos Ferrero. Hewitt played only Davis Cup matches for the remainder of the year, recording five-set wins over Roger Federer and Juan Carlos Ferrero in the semi-finals and final respectively, as Australia went on to win the Davis Cup. Hewitt used much of his spare time in late 2003 to bulk up, gaining 7\u00a0kg.\n2004: US Open and Masters Cup finals.\nIn 2004, Hewitt became the first man in history to lose in each Grand Slam singles tournament to the eventual champion. At the Australian Open, he was defeated in the fourth round by Roger Federer. At the French Open, he was defeated in a quarterfinal by Gast\u00f3n Gaudio. At Wimbledon, he was defeated in a quarterfinal again by Federer. And, at the US Open, he was defeated in the final by Federer, losing two out of the three sets at love (6-0). At the year ending 2004 Tennis Masters Cup, Hewitt defeated Andy Roddick to advance to the final, but was yet again defeated by defending champion Federer.\n2005: Australian Open final.\nIn 2005, Hewitt won his only title at the Sydney Medibank International defeating little-known Czech player Ivo Min\u00e1\u0159. Hewitt spent much time in the late stages of 2004 working with his former coach and good friend, Roger Rasheed, on bulking up his physique. His hard work paid off during the Australian summer, when he defeated an in-form No. 2 Andy Roddick to reach his first Australian Open final in 2005. He was the first Australian player to reach the final since Pat Cash in 1988. In the final, he faced fourth seed, Marat Safin, who had defeated No. 1 and defending champion Roger Federer in the semi-finals. After easily taking the first set, he was defeated by the Russian despite being up a break in the third set.\nAt Wimbledon, Hewitt reached the semi-finals, but lost to eventual champion Federer. Two months later, Hewitt again lost to Federer in the US Open semi-final, although this time he was able to take one set from the Swiss. Hewitt had at this point lost to the eventual champion at seven consecutive Grand Slam tournaments he played, (he missed the 2005 French Open because of injury). Hewitt pulled out of the Tennis Masters Cup tournament in Shanghai in November 2005 so that he could be with his wife Bec, who was due to give birth.\n2006: 25th career title.\nHewitt was defeated in the second round of the 2006 Australian Open by Juan Ignacio Chela of Argentina. He then reached the finals of the San Jose and Las Vegas tournaments, losing to British youngster Andy Murray and American James Blake, respectively. But he lost to Tim Henman in the second round of the Miami Masters, a player he had defeated eight times previously in as many matches. At the 2006 French Open, Hewitt reached the fourth round, where he lost to defending champion and eventual winner Rafael Nadal in four sets.\nHewitt won his first tournament of 2006 (after a 17-month hiatus from winning a tournament), when he beat Blake in the final of the Queen's Club Championships. This was his fourth title there, equalling the records of John McEnroe and Boris Becker. During the 2006 Wimbledon Championships, Hewitt survived a five-set match against South Korea's Hyung-Taik Lee that was played over two days. He then defeated Olivier Rochus and David Ferrer, before losing to Marcos Baghdatis in the quarterfinals. At the 2006 Legg Mason Tennis Classic in Washington, D.C., Hewitt was defeated by Arnaud Cl\u00e9ment in the quarterfinals, after defeating Vincent Spadea in the second round and Denis Gremelmayr in the third round.\nHewitt participated at the 2006 US Open, despite having an injured knee. Hewitt won his first three matches in straight sets against, respectively, Albert Monta\u00f1\u00e9s, Jan Hernych, and Novak Djokovic. He defeated Richard Gasquet in five sets to advance to the quarterfinals for the seventh consecutive year. He then lost to Roddick.\n2007: 26th career title.\nAt the 2007 Australian Open, Hewitt lost in the third round to tenth-seeded Chilean and eventual runner-up Fernando Gonz\u00e1lez. With his win in Las Vegas in March, Hewitt had won at least one ATP title annually for ten consecutive years. This was a record among active players at the time. Hewitt reached the 2007 Hamburg Masters semi-finals, where he pushed eventual finalist Rafael Nadal to three sets. At the 2007 French Open, Hewitt, for the second straight time lost in the fourth round to Nadal. At the 2007 Wimbledon Championships, Hewitt won his first three matches, including a four-set third round victory over Guillermo Ca\u00f1as. He then faced fourth seed Novak Djokovic in the fourth round, which he lost.\nAfter Wimbledon, it was announced that he had hired former Australian tennis pro Tony Roche to coach him during Grand Slam and Masters tournaments in 2007 and 2008. At the Masters tournaments in Montr\u00e9al and Cincinnati Hewitt reached the quarterfinals and semi-finals, respectively. In both cases, he lost to Roger Federer.\nHe was seeded 16th at the 2007 US Open, but for the first time in eight consecutive appearances at Flushing Meadows, he did not reach the quarterfinals or further. He lost in the second round to Argentine Agust\u00edn Calleri.\n2008: Injuries and year without titles.\nAt the 2008 Australian Open, he advanced to the fourth round as the 19th seed, defeating 15th-seeded and 2006 Australian Open finalist Marcos Baghdatis in a thrilling third-round match. The 282-minute match started at 11:52\u00a0pm and ended at 4:34\u00a0am the following morning. It was a characteristically \"gutsy\" performance and cemented Hewitt's reputation as a tough competitor. Hewitt lost his fourth-round match in straight sets to third-seeded and eventual champion Novak Djokovic.\nA hip injury Hewitt acquired in March 2008 affected his preparation for the French Open and forced the loss of 300 rankings points as Hewitt was unable to defend his semi-final appearance at the Hamburg Masters, as well as compete in supplementary tournaments. However, Hewitt made the third round at Roland Garros, before losing a five-set thriller to fifth seed David Ferrer.\nDespite his ongoing hip problem, Hewitt was able to compete at the Queens Club Championship with moderate success, falling to second seed Novak Djokovic in the quarterfinals. His good form continued into Wimbledon, Hewitt making the fourth round for the second successive year, before losing to No. 1 and top seed Roger Federer.\nAfter Wimbledon, Hewitt elected to miss the Montreal and Cincinnati Masters in an effort to give his hip sufficient rest to enable him to play at the 2008 Beijing Olympics, where he defeated Jonas Bj\u00f6rkman in the first round before losing to second seed Rafael Nadal. However, the more notable incident in the Olympics occurred in Hewitt's opening-round doubles match with Chris Guccione against Argentines Juan M\u00f3naco and Agust\u00edn Calleri. The match went to an advantage third set with Hewitt and Guccione prevailing 18\u201316. After the Olympics, due to the further damage Hewitt's hip sustained at the Olympics, he was left with no option but to pull out of the US Open and skip the rest of the season to have hip surgery. 2008 was the first year since 1997 in which Hewitt did not win a title.\n2009: Clay title, Wimbledon quarters, top 20.\nAfter returning from hip surgery, Hewitt played his first match in 2009 at the Hopman Cup, where he defeated Nicolas Kiefer in three sets.

Hewitt then lost to Youzhny in five sets, despite leading 4\u20131 in the fourth set and serving for the match at 5\u20133 in the fifth set.

In a pairing with Jordan Thompson, they lost in the first round of the Sydney International. A week later he teamed up with John-Patrick Smith at the Australian Open, yet again losing in the first round. \nHewitt and countryman Jordan Thompson received a wildcard to play at the Wimbledon Championships.

Venus in straight sets.\nAlso that year, he played doubles in New York, Houston, Surbiton, and 's-Hertogenbosch, playing with the likes of Alexei Popyrin and Thompson yet again.\n2020: Back in hometown of Adelaide.\nHewitt once again featured in the Australian summer of tennis, this time choosing to participate in the new Adelaide International, the first time he had played tour-tennis in his home town for over a decade. He partnered Jordan Thompson but lost in the first round to Cristian Gar\u00edn and Juan Ignacio Londero. The two chose to compete at the Australian Open a week later, but lost in the first round in straight sets, to Korean duo Min-Kyu Song and Nam Ji-sung.\nHewitt continues to commentate matches at the Australian Open.\n2025: Return to doubles.\nIn November 2025, Hewitt came out of retirement to partner son Cruz in the NSW Open doubles draw with a wildcard. In that tournament, they reached the quarterfinals, where they were defeated in straight sets by fellow Australians Calum Puttergill and Dane Sweeny.\nHewitt and his son are also scheduled to play doubles at the Playford Tennis International.\nNational representation.\nDavis Cup.\nHewitt made his Davis Cup debut for Australia in the 1999 Davis Cup quarterfinals at age 18 against the United States in Chestnut Hill, Massachusetts. In the first rubber of the tie Hewitt faced No. 8 and Wimbledon quarter finalist Todd Martin. Hewitt caused a major upset over Martin and would go on to win his second singles rubber against Alex O'Brien as well. The great start to his Davis Cup career would continue in the 1999 semi-finals against Russia where he would record another two wins against Marat Safin and Yevgeny Kafelnikov. He would taste his first defeat in Davis Cup in the 1999 final against France but would become a Davis Cup champion anyway. In 2000 Hewitt and Australia would again make the Davis Cup final but fell to Spain in Barcelona.\nIn 2001 Hewitt would again be a part of the Australian team that would make the Davis Cup final but the Australians would lose the fifth rubber and hand France a 3\u20132 win. Determined to make amends for his last few finals, Hewitt led the Australian team to the 2003 Davis Cup final against Spain where he defeated Juan Carlos Ferrero in five sets. The team came away victorious 3\u20131 overall and Hewitt claimed his second Davis Cup title. By the age of 22, he had recorded more wins in Davis Cup singles than any other Australian player. Following the retirement of Pat Rafter and the semi-retirement of Mark Philippoussis, Hewitt would be forced to lead the Australian Davis Cup team with little success from his peers. In the 2006 quarterfinals in Melbourne, Hewitt defeated Belarusian Vladimir Voltchkov in just 91 minutes. Voltchkov said before the match that \"Hewitt has no weapons to hurt me.\" Hewitt responded, \"Voltchkov doesn't have a ranking [of 457] to hurt me.\" In the semi-finals in Buenos Aires on clay, Hewitt lost to Argentine Jos\u00e9 Acasuso in five sets.\nDespite a world group semi-final appearance in 2006, Hewitt and Australia would be relegated to the Asia/Oceania region in 2008. Hewitt continued showed his commitment to the team by competing in the regional ties but the team fell in the playoff stages every year between 2008 and 2011. In the 2011 playoffs, he played against Roger Federer and Stanislas Wawrinka on a grass court in Sydney, losing both matches. In doubles, together with Chris Guccione, he was able to defeat Federer and Wawrinka, but this was not enough to take Australia to the World Group.\nIn 2012, Hewitt won his single and doubles match against China in February, which allowed Australia to return to the playoffs where they lost to Germany. After defeating Chinese Taipei and Uzbekistan, Australia earned the right to get to the playoffs again in 2013. They ended up routing Poland 4\u20131 on their soil including a convincing 6\u20131 6\u20133 6\u20132 win for Hewitt over recent Wimbledon quarterfinalist \u0141ukasz Kubot. In 2014, Australia crashed out 5\u20130 in the World Group first round on the French clay of La Roche-sur-Yon. Jo-Wilfried Tsonga beat Hewitt both in singles and doubles. Perth's grass courts would then be hosting yet another playoff tie for Australia in September 2014. Hewitt won both his singles match (against Farrukh Dustov) and the subsequent doubles rubber (partnering Chris Guccione v. Dustov and Istomin) in straight sets while up and coming Nick Kyrgios won his encounter with Denis Istomin to give Australia an unassailable 3\u20130 lead over Uzbekistan, thus enabling their country to return to the World Group in 2015. Sam Groth and Nick Kyrgios wrapped up a 5\u20130 victory a day later. Australia will open their 2015 campaign in Czech Republic for a 6\u20138 March tie that is one of two worst-case scenarios for Australia.\nHewitt played the Davis Cup match against Great Britain in the semi-finals of the 2015 Davis Cup. He played doubles with Sam Groth losing in five sets to brothers Andy and Jamie Murray.\nHe came out of retirement to play the first round match against the United States at the 2016 Davis Cup as a player-captain, where he and partner John Peers lost to the Bryan brothers in a five-setter.\nHe competed in the 2018 Davis Cup World Group play-offs, again as a player-captain in doubles with Peers. They won the rubber against the Austrian duo Oliver Marach and J\u00fcrgen Melzer in four sets.\nHewitt is the sole holder of several Australian Davis Cup records, which include most wins, most singles wins, most ties played and most years played. His Davis Cup career has included wins over players who were top ten at the time, which include Todd Martin, Marat Safin, Yevgeny Kafelnikov, Roger Federer, Gustavo Kuerten, S\u00e9bastien Grosjean and Juan Carlos Ferrero.\nWorld Team Cup.\nHewitt made his World Team Cup debut for Australia in 2000 at the age of 19. He recorded two singles victories over Albert Costa and Marcelo R\u00edos but fell to Yevgeny Kafelnikov in his last group stage match. Hewitt returned to the World Team Cup in 2001 and led Australia to the title by recording singles wins over \u00c0lex Corretja, Magnus Norman, Tommy Haas in the group stages. In the final Hewitt defeated No. 2 Marat Safin.\nHewitt made his third appearance at the tournament in 2003 where he entered as the No. 1 singles player and went undefeated in his singles matches by recording wins over Ji\u0159\u00ed Nov\u00e1k, James Blake and Carlos Moy\u00e1 but it was not enough to send Australia through to the final.\nFresh from their 2003 Davis Cup victory, Hewitt and Mark Philippoussis entered the 2004 World Team Cup with high hopes. In the group stages Hewitt recorded victories over Robby Ginepri and Martin Verkerk but fell to Gast\u00f3n Gaudio in his last group singles match. Despite the loss, Australia still advanced to the final where Hewitt would lose to Fernando Gonz\u00e1lez and Australia would lose the final 2\u20131.\nAfter a six-year hiatus Hewitt returned to compete in the 2010 World Team Cup and won his first match against John Isner but fell to Nicol\u00e1s Almagro in his last match.\nOlympics.\nA 19-year-old Hewitt entered his first Olympics in 2000 and was given the fourth seeding in the draw. Hewitt was considered a strong favourite for a medal given his victory at the Sydney International earlier in the year but despite competing in his home nation Hewitt went out in the first round to Max Mirnyi 6\u20133 6\u20133. Hewitt elected not to compete in the 2004 Athens Olympic Games, deciding instead to focus on the 2004 US Open which would result in a runner-up showing. He would return for his second Olympic Games in Beijing for both the singles and doubles competitions. A first round 7\u20135 7\u20136 victory over Jonas Bj\u00f6rkman would set up a second round clash with the number 2 seed Rafael Nadal. Nadal eliminated Hewitt in the second round 6\u20131 6\u20132 and would go on to win the singles gold medal. Pairing up with Chris Guccione in the doubles, the team would record victories over Agust\u00edn Calleri/Juan M\u00f3naco and Rafael Nadal/Tommy Robredo before falling to the Bryan brothers in the quarterfinals.\nHewitt competed in his third Olympics in London 2012 where he entered the men's singles event and defeated Ukrainian Sergiy Stakhovsky in the first round. He was the only Australian in any tennis event to progress past the first round. In the second round Hewitt took out 13th seeded Croatian Marin \u010cili\u0107. In the third round Hewitt stunned the tennis world when he won the first set against the number 2 ranked Novak Djokovic, he would end up falling in three sets. He also sent an application to the International Olympic Committee to enter the men's doubles competition with Chris Guccione but the application was rejected. Following his men's doubles rejection, Hewitt decided to apply for a spot in the mixed doubles competition with Sam Stosur. The pair were granted entry and defeated Polish pair Marcin Matkowski and Agnieszka Radwa\u0144ska in the first round. In the quarterfinals, Hewitt/Stosur faced British pair Andy Murray and Laura Robson, they would lose the encounter.\nCoaches.\nHewitt's coaches in his time on the ATP Tour:\nRivalries.\nHewitt vs Federer.\nHewitt and Roger Federer played each other on 27 occasions. Early in their careers, Hewitt dominated Federer, winning seven of their first nine meetings, including a victory from two sets down in the 2003 Davis Cup semi-final, which allowed Australia to defeat Switzerland. However, from 2004 onward, Federer dominated the rivalry, winning 16 of the last 18 meetings to finish with an 18\u20139 overall head-to-head record. This is Hewitt's longest rivalry as these two first played each other as juniors in 1996. They met in one Grand Slam final, the 2004 US Open final, where Federer won his first US Open title in a lopsided encounter in which Federer won the first and third sets 6\u20130 and the second set on a tiebreak. Federer met Hewitt at six of the Grand Slam tournaments in which he lifted the trophy, including all five of his triumphs between 2004 and 2005. Their last meeting was at the 2014 Brisbane International, where Hewitt triumphed over Federer in three sets, for his first title since 2010, when he also beat Federer to the Halle title.\nHewitt and Federer teamed up in the men's doubles at Wimbledon in 1999. They got to the third round before losing to Jonas Bj\u00f6rkman and Pat Rafter.\nHewitt vs Roddick.\nHewitt's second longest rivalry was against American Andy Roddick, in which the two played on 14 occasions. Early on, Hewitt dominated the rivalry, with six wins from their first seven meetings. One of those wins included a five-set victory at the 2001 US Open, the tournament in which Hewitt captured his first Singles Grand Slam title. In later years, Roddick began to dominate Hewitt, with the rivalry finishing at 7 wins each.\nHewitt vs Argentinian players.\nA rivalry and feud between Hewitt and Argentinian tennis players began at the 2002 Wimbledon final where Hewitt defeated Argentina's David Nalbandian in straight sets. The rivalry would hit boiling point in 2005 over a series of matches spread between the 2005 Australian Open and the 2005 Davis Cup Quarterfinals between Australia and Argentina. In the third round of 2005 Australian Open Hewitt faced Argentinian Juan Ignacio Chela in which Hewitt fired up Chela with his over-zealous celebrations for Chela's unforced errors, causing the Argentinian to spit at Hewitt during a change of ends. Hewitt would then face David Nalbandian in the quarterfinals on Australia Day with Hewitt coming out victorious 10\u20138 in the fifth set. Later in 2005 Hewitt would face Guillermo Coria in the Davis Cup quarterfinals, where their rivalry would flare up. It did, however, die down the following year in the 2006 Davis Cup semi-finals, where Argentina came out victorious 5\u20130 over Hewitt and the Australians.\nPlaying style.\nHewitt is a defensive counterpuncher. He typically likes to stay back towards the baseline during a rally and will usually approach the net only to catch a short reply or drop shot from his opponent. Hewitt's lack of penetration in his groundstrokes, most notably in his forehand, a typically dominant shot for most male players, forces him to rely on placement rather than simply \"dominating\" the point. At the 2004 Cincinnati Masters Final, commentator MaliVai Washington said that Hewitt was even more difficult to \"ace\" than Agassi because he gets more returns in play. Hewitt's tactics typically involve putting difficult service returns in play, consistently chasing down attempted winning shots from his opponent, and keeping the ball deep until he feels he can hit a winner.\nAlthough he is known primarily as a baseliner, Hewitt is a skilled volleyer and is known for having one of the best overhead smashes in the game. His signature shot, however, is the offensive topspin lob, a shot that he executes efficiently off both wings when his opponent approaches the net. US Davis Cup captain Patrick McEnroe, Jim Courier and Tim Henman have all described Hewitt's lob as being the best in the world (although Henman has since declared Andy Murray to have succeeded him). In Andre Agassi's book \"Open\", Hewitt is described as one of the best shot selectors in the history of Men's Tennis.\nEquipment.\nIn July 2000, Hewitt signed a multiyear endorsement deal with Nike. He is currently sponsored by American athletic apparel company Athletic DNA and the Japanese sports manufacturer Yonex, with whom he signed a \"Head to Toe\" deal in late 2005. Hewitt has used Yonex racquets as early as 2000, having used the Yonex Super RD Tour 95. Yonex provides Hewitt's racquets, shoes and accessories. Hewitt's Yonex shoes (SHT-306) are inscribed with his nickname \"Rusty\" along with an image of an Australian flag. As of 7 August 2007, his first appearance with a new racquet at the Montreal Masters, Hewitt used to use the Yonex RQiS 1 Tour. He used to use the Yonex RDS tour 90 Model, but switched to the Yonex RDiS 100 mid in 2009. In 2011, he switched to Yonex VCORE 95 D, using a grip size of 4 3/8 (L3). Since mid-2011, he began alternating between Yonex, Nike, Adidas, Asics and Fila shoes.\nPersonal life.\nHewitt is a keen supporter of Australian rules football, having played the game earlier in his career, and is currently the joint No. 1 ticket holder for the Adelaide Crows, alongside former Adelaide MP Kate Ellis. He had once had a close friendship with Crows star Andrew McLeod, but this broke down amid much public controversy in 2005. Hewitt had produced a DVD titled \"Lleyton Hewitt: The Other Side\" which precipitated the falling out between him and McLeod over filming of certain Aboriginal sites.\nHewitt and Belgian tennis player Kim Clijsters started a relationship in January 2000, during the Australian Open. The two announced their engagement just before Christmas 2003, but separated in October 2004, cancelling a planned February 2005 wedding.\nOn 30 January 2005, shortly after losing the 2005 Australian Open final to Marat Safin, Hewitt proposed to Australian actress Bec Cartwright after they had been dating for six weeks. They married on 21 July 2005 at the Sydney Opera House and they have three children together.\nIn late 2008, to extend his tennis career and reduce the amount of tax he would otherwise have had to pay, Hewitt relocated his family for the European and North American season to their home in the Old Fort Bay estate, in Nassau, Bahamas.\nHewitt has a nickname, \"Rusty\", which was given to him by Darren Cahill who at the time thought Hewitt resembled the character Rusty, from the National Lampoon film series. Hewitt has also been given the nickname 'Rocky' by fans, which originated from his shouts of \"C'mon Balboa\", in reference to the character Rocky Balboa from the Sylvester Stallone film \"Rocky\". Hewitt has also been compared to the character.\nIn December 2021, Hewitt sold their family home in Toorak (Victoria), and purchased a new house in Burleigh Heads (Queensland) where he and his family planned to live but sold it in 2025 after failing to find time to visit.\nControversies.\nHewitt has been involved in several public controversies. He was involved in a racism dispute while playing the mixed-race American player James Blake at the 2001 US Open. After a black linesman called a foot-fault on two critical points in the third set, Hewitt implied that the similarity in skin colour between Blake and the official influenced the decision to penalise him.\nAt the 2001 French Open Hewitt twice called the chair umpire and net judge \"spastics\" and was subsequently forced to apologise following a public backlash.\nHewitt's frequent \"c'mons\" when he won a point or his opponents made an error have been remarked upon as poor sportsmanship by opponents and media commentators. This behaviour particularly riled his 2005 Australian Open second-round opponent James Blake.\nCareer statistics.\nSingles performance timeline.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Performance key/styles.css\"/&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;(W) winner; (F) finalist; (SF) semifinalist; (QF) quarterfinalist; (#R) rounds 4, 3, 2, 1; (RR) round-robin stage; (Q#) qualification round; (DNQ) did not qualify; (A) absent; (NH) not held; (SR) strike rate (events won / competed); (W\u2013L) win\u2013loss record.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nExternal links.\nrole=\"presentation\" class=\"wikitable succession-box noprint\" style=\"margin:0.5em auto; font-size:small;clear:both;\""}

Considered a major figure of the European film industry, he and his works have been variously described as ambitious and provocative, as well as technically innovative. His films offer confrontational examinations of existential, social, psychosexual, and political issues, and deal in subjects including mercy, sacrifice, and mental health. He frequently collaborates with the actors Jens Albinus, Jean-Marc Barr, Udo Kier and Stellan Skarsg\u00e5rd.\nVon Trier co-created the avant-garde filmmaking movement Dogme 95 alongside fellow director Thomas Vinterberg and co-founded the Danish film production company Zentropa, the films from which have sold more than 350million tickets and garnered eight Academy Award nominations.\nVon Trier has been the subject of criticisms and controversies. Cannes Film Festival, in addition to awarding his films on numerous occasions, once listed him as for making a Nazism joke during an interview. Animal harm on \"Manderlay\"'s set, and graphic violence and unsimulated sex in some of his films have drawn criticism, and he has also been accused of mistreatment and negligence towards actresses during the filming process, including Bj\u00f6rk.\nEarly life and education.\nBorn Lars Trier in Kongens Lyngby, Denmark, north of Copenhagen, his parents are Inger H\u00f8st and Ulf Trier. He later learned from Inger's deathbed that his biological father was Fritz Michael Hartmann, Inger's former boss at Denmark's Ministry of Social Affairs and a World War II resistance fighter.\nHe studied film theory at the University of Copenhagen and film direction at the National Film School of Denmark. At 25, he won two Best School Film awards at the Munich International Festival of Film Schools for \"Nocturne\" and \"Last Detail\". The same year, he added the nobiliary particle \"von\" to his name, possibly as a satirical homage to the equally self-invented titles of directors Erich von Stroheim and Josef von Sternberg, and saw his graduation film \"Images of Liberation\" released as a theatrical feature.\nCareer.\n1984\u20131994: Career beginnings and \"Europa\" trilogy.\nIn 1984, \"The Element of Crime\", von Trier's breakthrough film, received twelve awards at seven international festivals including the Technical Grand Prize at Cannes, and a nomination for the Palme d'Or. The film's slow, non-linear pace, innovative and multi-leveled plot design, and dark dreamlike visual effects combine to create an allegory for traumatic European historical events.\nVon Trier's next film, \"Epidemic\" (1987), was also shown at Cannes in the Un Certain Regard section, and featured two story lines that ultimately collide: the chronicle of two filmmakers (played by vonTrier and screenwriter Niels V\u00f8rse) in the midst of developing a new project, and a dark science fiction tale of a futuristic plague\u00a0\u2013 the very film von Trier and V\u00f8rsel are depicted making. He next directed \"Medea\" (1988) for television, based on a screenplay by Carl Th. Dreyer and starring Udo Kier, which won the Jean d'Arcy prize in France.\nVon Trier has referred to his films as falling into thematic and stylistic trilogies. This pattern began with \"The Element of Crime\" (1984), the first of the \"Europa\" trilogy, which illuminated traumatic periods in Europe both in the past and the future. It also includes \"Epidemic\". He completed the trilogy in 1991 with \"Europa\" (released as \"Zentropa\" in the US), which won the Prix duJury at the 1991 Cannes Film Festival, and picked up awards at other major festivals. In 1990 he also directed the music video for the song \"Bakerman\" by Laid Back. This video was re-used in 2006 by the English DJ and artist Shaun Baker in his remake of the song.\nSeeking financial independence and creative control over their projects, in 1992 vonTrier and producer Peter Aalb\u00e6k Jensen founded the film production company Zentropa Entertainment, which has sold more than 350 million tickets and was nominated for multiple Academy Awards as of 2016. Named after a fictional railway company in \"Europa\", their most recent film at the time, Zentropa has produced many movies other than Trier's own, as well as several television series. It has also produced hardcore sex films: \"Constance\" (1998), \"Pink Prison\" (1999), \"HotMen CoolBoyz\" (2000), and \"All About Anna\" (2005). To make money for his newly founded company, vonTrier made \"The Kingdom\" (Danish title \"Riget\", 1994) and \"The KingdomII\" (\"RigetII\", 1997), a pair of miniseries recorded in the Danish national hospital, the name \"Riget\" being a colloquial name for the hospital known as Rigshospitalet (lit. The Kingdom's Hospital) in Danish. A projected third season of the series was derailed by the death in 1998 of Ernst-Hugo J\u00e4reg\u00e5rd, who played Dr. Helmer, and that of Kirsten Rolffes, who played Mrs. Drusse, in 2000, two of the major characters, which led to the series' cancellation.\n1995\u20132000: Dogme 95 manifesto, and \"Golden Heart\" trilogy.\nIn 1995, von Trier and Thomas Vinterberg presented their manifesto for a new cinematic movement, which they called Dogme 95. The Dogme95 concept, which led to international interest in Danish film, inspired filmmakers all over the world. It required filmmakers to shirk several common techniques in modern filmmaking, such as studio lighting, sets, costumes, and non-diegetic music. In 2008, together with their fellow Dogme directors Kristian Levring and S\u00f8ren Kragh-Jacobsen, vonTrier and Thomas Vinterberg received the European film award for European Achievement in World Cinema.\nIn 1996 von Trier conducted an unusual theatrical experiment in Copenhagen involving 53 actors, which he titled \"Psychomobile1: The World Clock\". A documentary chronicling the project was directed by Jesper Jargil, and was released in 2000 with the title \"De Udstillede\" (The Exhibited).\nVon Trier achieved international success with his \"Golden Heart\" trilogy. Each film in the trilogy is about naive heroines who maintain their \"golden hearts\" despite the tragedies they experience. This trilogy consists of \"Breaking the Waves\" (1996), \"The Idiots\" (1998), and \"Dancer in the Dark\" (2000). While all three films are sometimes associated with the Dogme 95 movement, \"The Idiots\" was the only one to meet all the necessary criteria to be \"certified\" as such.\n\"Breaking the Waves\" won the Grand Prix at the Cannes Film Festival and featured Emily Watson, who was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actress. Its grainy images, and hand-held photography, pointed towards Dogme95 but violated several of the manifesto's rules. The second film in the trilogy, \"The Idiots\", was nominated for a Palme d'Or, with which he was presented in person at the 1998 Cannes Film Festival, despite his dislike of traveling. In 2000, von Trier premiered \"Dancer in the Dark\", a musical featuring Icelandic musician Bj\u00f6rk, which won the Palme d'Or at Cannes. The song \"I've Seen It All\" (co-written by vonTrier) received an Academy Award nomination for Best Original Song.\n2003\u20132008: \"Land of Opportunities\" trilogy and other works.\n\"The Five Obstructions\" (2003), made by vonTrier and J\u00f8rgen Leth, is a documentary that incorporates lengthy sections of experimental films. The premise is that vonTrier challenges Leth, his friend and mentor, to remake his 1967 experimental short \"The Perfect Human\" five times, each time with a different obstacle.\nHis next proposed trilogy, \"Land of Opportunities\", consists of \"Dogville\" (2003), \"Manderlay\" (2005), and the unmade \"Washington\". The first two installments were shot with the same distinctive, extremely stylized approach, with the actors performing on a bare sound stage with no decoration, buildings' walls marked by chalk lines on the floor, a style inspired by 1970s televised theatre. \"Dogville\" starred Nicole Kidman as Grace Margaret Mulligan, a role taken by Bryce Dallas Howard for \"Manderlay\". Both films feature an ensemble cast including Harriet Andersson, Lauren Bacall, James Caan, Danny Glover, and Willem Dafoe. The films question various issues relating to American society, such as intolerance and slavery.\nIn 2006, von Trier released the Danish-language comedy film, \"The Boss of It All\", which was shot using an experimental process he named Automavision, involving the director choosing the best possible fixed camera position, then allowing a computer to randomly choose when to tilt, pan, or zoom. He followed this with an autobiographical film, \"The Early Years: Erik Nietzsche Part 1\" in 2007, which von Trier wrote and Jacob Thuesen directed, a film that tells the story of vonTrier's years as a student at the National Film School of Denmark. It stars Jonatan Spang as vonTrier's alter ego, called \"Erik Nietzsche\", and is narrated by vonTrier himself, with all main characters being based on real people from the Danish film industry. The thinly veiled portrayals include Jens Albinus as director Nils Malmros, Dejan \u010cuki\u0107 as screenwriter Mogens Rukov, and S\u00f8ren Pilmark.\n2009\u20132014: \"Depression\" trilogy.\nThe \"Depression\" trilogy consists of \"Antichrist\", \"Melancholia\", and \"Nymphomaniac\". The three films star Charlotte Gainsbourg, and deal with characters who suffer depression or grief in different ways. This trilogy is said to represent the depression that Trier himself experiences.\n\"Antichrist\" follows \"a grieving couple who retreat to their cabin in the woods, hoping a return to Eden will repair their broken hearts and troubled marriage; but nature takes its course and things go from bad to worse\". The film stars Willem Dafoe and Gainsbourg. It premiered in competition at the 2009 Cannes Film Festival, where the festival's jury honoured the movie by giving the Best Actress award to Gainsbourg.\n\"Melancholia\", released in 2011, is an apocalyptic drama about two depressive sisters played by Kirsten Dunst and Gainsbourg, the former of whom marries just before a rogue planet is about to collide with Earth. The film was in competition at the 2011 Cannes Film Festival, where it won the Best Actress award for Dunst.\nFollowing \"Melancholia\", von Trier began the production of \"Nymphomaniac\", a film about the sexual awakening of a woman played by Gainsbourg. In early December 2013, a four-hour version was shown to the press in a private preview session. The cast also included Stellan Skarsg\u00e5rd (in his sixth film for von Trier), Shia LaBeouf, Willem Dafoe, Jamie Bell, Christian Slater, and Uma Thurman. In response to claims that he had merely created a \"porn film\", Skarsg\u00e5rd stated \"... if you look at this film, it's actually a really bad porn movie, even if you fast forward. And after a while you find you don't even react to the explicit scenes. They become as natural as seeing someone eating a bowl of cereal.\" For its public release in the United Kingdom, the film was divided into two volumes. The film premiered in the UK on 22February 2014.\nIn interviews prior to the film's release, Gainsbourg and co-star Stacy Martin revealed that prosthetic vaginas, body doubles, and special effects were used for the production of the film. Martin also stated that the film's characters were a reflection of the director himself, and referred to the experience as an \"honour\" that she enjoyed. The film was also released in two \"volumes\" for the Australian release on 20 March 2014, with an interval separating the back-to-back sections. In February 2014, an uncensored version of \"Volume I\" was shown at the Berlin Film Festival, with no announcement of when or if the complete five-and-a-half-hour \"Nymphomaniac\" would be made available to the public. The complete version premiered at the 2014 Venice Film Festival and was shortly afterward released in a limited theatrical run worldwide that fall.\n2015\u20132018: \"The House That Jack Built\" and return to Cannes.\nIn 2015, von Trier began work on a new feature film, \"The House That Jack Built\", which was originally planned as an eight-part television series. The story is about a serial killer, seen from the murderer's point of view. It starred Matt Dillon in the title role, alongside Bruno Ganz, Riley Keough and Sofie Gr\u00e5b\u00f8l. Shooting started in March 2017 in Sweden, before moving to Copenhagen in May.\nIn February 2017, von Trier explained that the film \"celebrates the idea that life is evil and soulless, which is sadly proven by the recent rise of the \"Homo trumpus\" \u2013 the rat king\". The film premiered at the Cannes Film Festival in May 2018. Despite more than a hundred walkouts by audience members, the film still received a 10-minute standing ovation.\n2019\u2013present: \"The Kingdom\" trilogy.\nAfter the release of \"The House That Jack Built\", von Trier planned to produce \"\u00c9tudes\", an anthology film consisting of ten black and white segments, each ten minutes long, inspired by the musical form; though it never came to fruition. In December 2020, it was announced he would produce a belated third and final season of \"The Kingdom\", titled \"The Kingdom Exodus\", with S\u00f8ren Pilmark returning as J\u00f8rgen 'Hook' Krogsh\u00f8j, Ghita N\u00f8rby as Rigmor Mortensen, alongside a new cast including Mikael Persbrandt as Dr. Helmer, Jr. It was shot in 2021, consisting of five episodes released in November 2022. The miniseries premiered out of competition at the Venice Film Festival as a five-hour feature-length film. It received mixed reviews from critics.\nIn 2024, von Trier announced he was working on a new film titled \"After\" which will benefit from funding from the Danish Film Institute. Stellan Skarsg\u00e5rd was cast as the film's lead. Filming is expected to begin in summer 2025, with von Trier's health conditions reflected in the plot of the film.\nAesthetics, themes, and style of working.\nThemes.\nVon Trier's films deal with themes of religious imagery and his treatment of subjects such as mercy, sacrifice, and mental health, confrontational examination of existential, social, and political issues. Most of the films depicted in various forms of politics and religions, such as Nazism in \"Europa\", Christianity in \"Breaking the Waves\" and \"The House that Jack Built\", Atheism in \"Dogville\", and Anti-bourgeois in \"The Idiots\".\nInfluences.\nVon Trier is heavily influenced by the work of Carl Theodor Dreyer and the film \"The Night Porter\". He was so inspired by the short film \"The Perfect Human\", directed by J\u00f8rgen Leth, that he challenged Leth to redo the short five times in the feature film \"The Five Obstructions\".\nWriting.\nVon Trier's writing style has been heavily influenced by his work with actors on set, as well as the Dogme 95 manifesto that he co-authored. In an interview with \"Creative Screenwriting\", he described his process as \"writing a sketch and keep[ing] the story simple...then part of the script work is with the actors.\" He again cites Dreyer as an influence, pointing to his method of overwriting his scripts, then significantly cutting the length down. Reflecting on the storytelling across his body of work, von Trier said, \"all the stories are about a realist who comes into conflict with life. I'm not crazy about real life, and real life is not crazy about me.\"\nFilming techniques.\nVon Trier has said that \"a film should be like a stone in your shoe\". To create original art he feels that filmmakers must distinguish themselves stylistically from other films, often by placing restrictions on the film making process. The most famous such restriction is the cinematic \"vow of chastity\" of the Dogme 95 movement. In \"Dancer in the Dark\", he used jump shots and dramatically different color palettes and camera techniques for the \"real world\" and musical portions of the film.\nVon Trier often shoots digitally and operates the camera himself, preferring to continuously shoot the actors in-character without stopping between takes. In \"Dogville\", because there were no walls between the \"buildings\" on the set, actors needed to stay in character for hours, even when not part of the scene being filmed. These techniques often put great strain on the actors, most famously with Bj\u00f6rk during the filming of \"Dancer in the Dark\".\nVon Trier would later return to explicit images in \"Antichrist\" (2009), exploring darker themes, but he ran into problems when he tried once more with \"Nymphomaniac\", which had 90 minutes cut out (reducing it from five-and-one-half to four hours) for its international release in 2013 in order to be commercially viable, taking nearly a year to be shown complete anywhere in an uncensored director's cut.\nWhile Lars von Trier commissioned new musical compositions for his early films, his more recent work has made use of existing music. With \"Nymphomaniac\", the principle of musical eclecticism is also applied within the film. He often heavily edits compositions to manipulate and provoke the audience.\nApproach to actors.\nIn an interview for IndieWire, von Trier compared his approach to actors with \"how a chef would work with a potato or a piece of meat\", clarifying that working with actors has differed on each film based on the production conditions. He has occasionally courted controversy by his treatment of his lead actresses. He and Bj\u00f6rk famously fell out during the shooting of \"Dancer in the Dark\", to the point where she would abscond from filming for days at a time. She stated of von Trier, who shattered a monitor while it was next to her, that \"you can take quite sexist film directors like Woody Allen or Stanley Kubrick and still they are the one that provide the soul to their movies. In Lars von Trier's case it is not so and he knows it. He needs a female to provide his work soul. And he envies them and hates them for it. So he has to destroy them during the filming. And hide the evidence.\"\nNicole Kidman, who starred in von Trier's \"Dogville\", said in an interview with ABC Radio National that she tried to quit the film several times in response to comments von Trier made on set, often while inebriated, \"but I say this laughing...I didn't do the sequel but I'm still very good friends with him, strangely enough, because I admire his honesty and I see him as an artist, and I say, my gosh, it's such a hard world now to have a unique voice, and he certainly has that.\"\nHowever, other actresses he has worked with, such as Kirsten Dunst and Charlotte Gainsbourg have spoken out in defence of his approach. \"Nymphomaniac\" star Stacy Martin has stated that he never forced her to do anything that was outside her comfort zone. She said \"I don't think he's a misogynist. The fact that he sometimes depicts women as troubled or dangerous or dark or even evil; that doesn't automatically make him anti-feminist. It's a very dated argument. I think that Lars loves women.\"\nPersonal life.\nFamily.\nIn 1989, von Trier's mother confessed to him on her deathbed that his biological father was not the man who raised him, but her former employer, Fritz Michael Hartmann (1909\u20132000), who was descended from a long line of Danish classical musicians. Hartmann's grandfather was Emil Hartmann, and his great-grandfather J. P. E. Hartmann. His uncles included Niels Gade and Johan Ernst Hartmann, and Niels Viggo Bentzon was his cousin. She stated that she did this to give her son \"artistic genes\". Von Trier has jokingly said, by reference to the distant German origin of the Hartmann family, that while he believed he had a Jewish background, he is \"really more of a Nazi.\"\nDuring the German occupation of Denmark, Hartmann in fact joined a resistance group, actively counteracting any pro-German and pro-Nazi colleagues in his civil service department. Another member of this resistance group was Hartmann's colleague Viggo Kampmann, who would later become prime minister of Denmark. After vonTrier had four awkward meetings with his biological father, Hartmann refused further contact.\nFrom 1987 to 1995, von Trier was married to producer and actress C\u00e6cilia Holbek, with whom he has two daughters, Agnes and Selma (both producers like their parents), and from 1997 to 2015 to Bente Fr\u00f8ge, with whom he has two sons.\nFamily background and political and religious views.\nVon Trier's mother considered herself a communist, while Ulf Trier was a social democrat. Both were committed nudists, and vonTrier went on several childhood holidays to nudist camps. They regarded the disciplining of children as reactionary. Von Trier has noted that he was brought up in an atheist family, and that although Ulf Trier was Jewish, he was not religious. His parents did not allow much room in their household for \"feelings, religion, or enjoyment\", and also refused to make any rules for their children.\nIn a 2005 interview with \"Die Zeit\", vonTrier said, \"I don't know if I'm all that Catholic really. I'm probably not. Denmark is a very Protestant country. Perhaps I only turned Catholic to piss off a few of my countrymen.\" In 2009, he said, \"I'm a very bad Catholic. In fact I'm becoming more and more of an atheist.\"\nHealth.\nMental health.\nVon Trier suffers from various fears and phobias, including an intense fear of flying. This fear frequently places severe constraints on him and his crew, necessitating that virtually all of his films be shot in either Denmark or Sweden.\nOn numerous occasions, he has stated that he suffers from occasional depression which renders him incapable of doing his work and unable to fulfill social obligations.\nParkinson's disease.\nOn 8 August 2022, it was announced that von Trier had been diagnosed with Parkinson's disease. According to \"Variety\", von Trier plans to take a break from filmmaking to adjust to his new life with the disease, saying: \"I will take a little break and find out what to do, but I certainly hope that my condition will be better. It's a disease you can't take away; you can work with the symptoms, though.\" On 12 February 2025, Zentropa producer Louise Vesth announced via Instagram that von Trier had been admitted to a care facility for the condition.\nControversies.\nRemarks during Cannes interview.\nIn May 2011, known to be provocative in interviews, vonTrier's remarks during the press conference before the premiere of \"Melancholia\" in Cannes caused significant controversy in the media, leading the festival to declare him \"persona non grata\". He was therefore banned from Cannes for one year, although \"Melancholia\" still competed in that year's competition.\nMinutes before the end of the press conference, von Trier was asked about his German roots and the Nazi aesthetic, in response to his description of the film's genre as \"German romance\". He joked that since he was \"no longer Jewish,\" having been told the truth about his biological father, he now \"understands\" and \"sympathizes\" with Hitler, that he is not against the Jews except for Israel which is \"a pain in the ass\" and that he is a Nazi. Von Trier was branded an antisemite for his remarks. He released a formal apology immediately after the press conference and kept apologizing for his joke during all of the interviews he gave in the weeks following the incident, admitting that he was not sober, and saying that he did not need to explain that he is not a Nazi. However, in 2019, von Trier stated that he made this remark at the \"only press conference I ever had when I was sober.\"\nThe actors of \"Melancholia\" who were present during the incident \u2013 Dunst, Gainsbourg, Skarsg\u00e5rd \u2013 defended the director, pointing to his provocative sense of humor and his depression. He refused to attend a private press screening of his subsequent feature \"Nymphomaniac\". In the director's defense, Skarsg\u00e5rd stated at the screening, \"Everyone knows he's not a Nazi, and it was disgraceful the way the press had these headlines saying he was.\" The director of the Cannes festival later called the controversy \"unfair\" and as \"stupid\" as vonTrier's bad joke, concluding that his films are welcome at the festival and that vonTrier is considered a \"friend\".\nSex and violence in films.\nSeveral of his films \u2013 \"The Idiots\" (1998), \"Antichrist\" (2009), \"Nymphomaniac\" (2013) and \"The House That Jack Built\" (2018) \u2013 contain explicit content that has generated controversy; the first faced widespread backlash upon its release as one film critic, Mark Kermode, was ejected from its premiere screening at Cannes for heckling, and the film was heavily censored for subsequent releases. At the 2018 Cannes Film Festival, approximately 100 audience members walked out of the premiere of \"The House That Jack Built\".\nSexual harassment allegations with Bj\u00f6rk.\nIn October 2017, in the wake of dozens of sexual abuse cases brought against film producer Harvey Weinstein, Bj\u00f6rk posted on her Facebook page that she had been sexually harassed by a Danish film director. She commented:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;It was extremely clear to me when I walked into the actresses profession that my humiliation and role as a lesser sexually harassed being was the norm and set in stone with the director and a staff of dozens who enabled it and encouraged it. I became aware of that it is a universal thing that a director can touch and harass his actresses at will and the institution of film allows it. When I turned the director down repeatedly he sulked and punished me and created for his team an impressive net of illusion where I was framed as the difficult one. ...\nand in my opinion he had a more fair and meaningful relationship with his actresses after my confrontation so there is hope. Let's hope this statement supports the actresses and actors all over. Let's stop this. There is a wave of change in the world.\nThe \"Los Angeles Times\" found evidence identifying him as Lars von Trier. Von Trier has rejected Bj\u00f6rk's allegation that he sexually harassed her during the making of the film \"Dancer in the Dark\", and said \"That was not the case. But that we were definitely not friends, that's a fact\", to Danish daily \"Jyllands-Posten\" in its online edition. Peter Aalb\u00e6k Jensen, the producer of \"Dancer in the Dark\", told \"Jyllands-Posten\" that \"as far as I remember we [Lars von Trier and I] were the victims. That woman was stronger than both Lars von Trier and me and our company put together. She dictated everything and was about to close a movie of 100m kroner [$16m]\". After von Trier's statement, Bj\u00f6rk pushed further allegations against the director via her personal Facebook-page.\n\"The Guardian\" later alleged that Jensen's studio, Zentropa, with which von Trier frequently collaborated, had had an endemic culture of sexual harassment. Jensen stepped down from CEO position of Zentropa as further harassment allegations were published in 2017.\nAnimal cruelty during filming.\nA donkey was slaughtered for dramatic purposes during production of \"Manderlay\", an act that caused actors including John C. Reilly to quit the film in protest at its cruelty to animals. The scene was cut from the film before it was released.\nAlthough \"The House that Jack Built\" was praised by animal rights organization PETA for its use of realistic effects, a scene involving the main character mutilating a duckling was the subject of criticism from some audiences.\nPosition on the Russian war against Ukraine.\nIn August 2023, Lars von Trier published on Instagram a critical entry against the delivery of F-16 fighters to Ukraine, ending his post by saying \"Russian lives matter also!\" The entry immediately became publicized in official Russian media and by the Russian media executive Margarita Simonyan. Oleksiy Danilov, head of Ukraine's National Security and Defense Council, responded on Twitter, criticising von Trier's comments, saying, \"The choice between the executioner and the victim becomes a tragedy when the artist chooses the side of the executioner.\" Two days later, Von Trier then made another post on Instagram, saying, \"I support Ukraine with every beat of my heart! I was just stating the obvious: that all lives in this world matter!\"\nFilmography.\nFrequent collaborators.\nVon Trier often works more than once with actors and production members. Manon Rasmussen was the only crew member as a costume designer to collaborate with von Trier in all of his works (except \"Medea\" and \"The Idiots\") since \"The Element of Crime\" (1984). His first, but initial acting collaborator for \"The Element of Crime\" was , who appeared in his role as a hotel guest, yet continued to appear again in the last two films as different minor roles for his first trilogy until his acting retirement in the early 1990s. His main crew members and producer team has remained intact since \"Europa\". Many of his recurring actors have expressed their devotion to von Trier. European actors Jean-Marc Barr, Udo Kier, and Stellan Skarsg\u00e5rd have all appeared across several von Trier films. With the exception of \"Medea\", \"The Kingdom\", his incompleted \"USA Trilogy\", and \"The House that Jack Built\"; British-French actress Charlotte Gainsbourg and Swedish actor are the only two acting collaborators (excluding himself) to have appeared in all installments of two of his trilogies, taking the lead roles in \"Depression\" for the former and minor roles in \"Europa\" for the latter.\n\"Note: This list shows only the actors (in alphabetical order only) who have collaborated with von Trier in three or more productions\".\nAwards and honors.\nAmong his more than 100 awards and 200 nominations at film festivals worldwide, von Trier has received: the Palme d'Or (for \"Dancer in the Dark\"), the Grand Prix (for \"Breaking the Waves\"), the Prix du Jury (for \"Europa\"), and the Technical Grand Prize (for \"The Element of Crime\" and \"Europa\") at the Cannes Film Festival. Von Trier has also received both Golden Globe Award and Academy Award nominations for the former.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It was directed by Jones. The film tells the story of Brian Cohen (played by Chapman), a young Judaean man who is born on the same day as\u2014and next door to\u2014Jesus, and is subsequently mistaken for the Messiah.\nFollowing the withdrawal of funding by EMI Films just days before production was scheduled to begin, musician and former Beatle George Harrison and his business partner Denis O'Brien arranged financing for \"Life of Brian\" through the formation of their HandMade Films company.\nThe film's themes of religious satire were controversial at the time of its release, drawing accusations of blasphemy and protests from some religious groups. In the United Kingdom, the film was given an AA (14) rating by the British Board of Film Classification, though 11 local councils outright banned the film, while a further 28 raised the rating from AA to X across their jurisdictions. (This certificate would later be amended, from AA to 15 in 1988, and from 15 to 12A in 2019.) Some countries, including Ireland and Norway, banned its showing; and, in a few of these, such as Italy, bans lasted over a decade. The filmmakers used the notoriety to promote the film, with posters in Sweden reading, \"So funny it was banned in Norway!\"\nThe film was a box office success. It was the fourth highest-grossing film in the United Kingdom in 1979 and the highest-grossing of any British film in the United States that year. It has remained popular and has been named as the greatest comedy film of all time by several magazines and television networks, and it later received a 96% rating on Rotten Tomatoes with the consensus reading, \"One of the more cutting-edge films of the 1970s, this religious farce from the classic comedy troupe is as poignant as it is funny and satirical.\" In a 2006 Channel 4 poll, \"Life of Brian\" was ranked first on their list of the 50 Greatest Comedy Films.\nPlot.\nBrian Cohen is born in a stable next door to the one in which Jesus is born, which initially confuses the three wise men who come to praise the future King of the Jews. He later grows up into an idealistic young man who resents the continuing Roman occupation of Judea. \nWhile listening to Jesus' Sermon on the Mount, Brian becomes infatuated with an attractive young rebel named Judith Iscariot. His desire for her and hatred of the Romans, further exacerbated by his scolding mother, Mandy Cohen, revealing that Brian himself is half-Roman, inspire him to join the \"People's Front of Judea\" (PFJ). This is one of many fractious and bickering independence movements that spend more time fighting each other than they do the Romans.\nPFJ leader Reg tasks Brian to paint slogans overnight on Roman governor Pontius Pilate's palace, but a Roman officer catches him in the act. However, the officer shows more concern with Brian's appalling Latin grammar than the act of vandalism itself, and after correcting the slogan to \"Romani ite domum\", orders him to write it on the wall one hundred times. Brian finishes after sunrise and is chased by guards before being rescued by Judith.\nReg gives a revolutionary speech to the PFJ asking, \"What have the Romans ever done for us?\" At this point the listeners outline all forms of positive aspects of the Roman occupation such as sanitation, medicine, education, wine, public order, irrigation, roads, a fresh water system, public health and peace. He then outlines plans to kidnap Pilate's wife. \nHowever, inside Pilate's palace, the PFJ encounters another revolutionary group, the Campaign for a Free Galilee; an argument ensues over who came up with the plan first and everyone except Brian is knocked unconscious, leading Brian to be captured by the palace guards. The guards bring Brian before Pilate, but his questioning is cut short when Pilate mentions the name of his friend, Biggus Dickus, and his wife, Incontinentia Buttocks - causing the guards to begin to laugh.\nAfter escaping from the Romans, Brian is accidentally scooped up by a passing extraterrestrial spaceship that crash-lands back on Earth. He tries to blend in among prophets who are preaching in a busy plaza, repeating fragments of Jesus' sermons. He stops his sermon mid-sentence when some Roman soldiers depart, leaving his small but intrigued audience demanding to know more. Brian grows frantic when people chase him to the mountains, and there they declare him to be the Messiah. \nAfter spending the night with Judith, Brian discovers an enormous crowd of followers assembled outside his mother's house. Her attempts at dispersing the crowd are rebuffed, so she consents to his addressing them. Although Brian tells them they need to think for themselves and that they are all individuals, they ironically parrot his words as doctrine.\nThe PFJ seeks to exploit Brian's celebrity status by having him minister to a thronging crowd of followers demanding miracle cures. Brian sneaks out the back, only to be captured by the Romans and sentenced to crucifixion. In celebration of Passover, a crowd has assembled outside the palace of Pilate, who offers to pardon a prisoner of their choice as a show of friendship between the Romans and the people of Judea. \nHowever, the crowd shouts out names containing the letter \"r\", to mock Pilate's speech impediment, and are further amused by his friend Biggus's lisp, which causes them to laugh uncontrollably. Eventually, Judith appears in the crowd, who frantically calls for the release of Brian, which the crowd (assuming it is another joke) parrots. Realising that one of the prisoners is really named Brian, Pilate agrees to \"welease Bwian\".\nThe guards eventually catch up to Brian, who is already on the cross. But in a scene that parodies the climax of the film \"Spartacus\", various crucified people all claim to be Brian so they can be freed, and the wrong man is released. \nBrian is successively approached and then abandoned by the PFJ, who praise his martyrdom, the Judean People's Front, who commit mass suicide as a form of political protest, Judith, and his mother. As Brian sinks to despair, the convict beside him offers a cheerful song, which Brian and the other convicts join in with (\"Always Look on the Bright Side of Life\").\nCast.\nSeveral characters remained unnamed during the film but do have names that are used in the soundtrack album track listing and elsewhere. There is no mention in the film that Eric Idle's ever-cheerful joker is called \"Mr Cheeky\", or that the Roman guard played by Michael Palin is named \"Nisus Wettus\".\nSpike Milligan appears as a prophet, ignored because his acolytes are chasing after Brian. By coincidence Milligan was visiting his old World War II battlefields in Tunisia where the film was being made. The Pythons were alerted to this and he was included in the scene being filmed that morning. He left in the afternoon before he could be included in any of the close-up or publicity shots for the film.\nProduction.\nPre-production.\nThere are various stories about the origins of \"Life of Brian\". Shortly after the release of \"Monty Python and the Holy Grail\" (1975), Eric Idle flippantly suggested that the title of the Pythons' forthcoming feature would be \"Jesus Christ: Lust for Glory\" (a play on the UK title for the 1970 American film \"Patton, Patton: Ordeal and Triumph\"). This was after he had become frustrated at repeatedly being asked what it would be called, despite the troupe not having given the matter of a third film any consideration. However, they shared a distrust of organised religion, and, after witnessing the critically acclaimed \"Holy Grail\"'s enormous financial turnover, confirming an appetite among the fans for more cinematic endeavours, they began to seriously consider a film lampooning the New Testament era in the same way that \"Holy Grail\" had lampooned Arthurian legend. All they needed was an idea for a plot. Eric Idle and Terry Gilliam, while promoting \"Holy Grail\" in Amsterdam, had come up with a sketch in which Jesus' cross is falling apart because of the idiotic carpenters who built it and he angrily tells them how to do it correctly. However, after an early brainstorming stage, and despite being non-believers, they agreed that Jesus was \"definitely a good guy\" and found nothing to mock in his actual teachings: \"He's not particularly funny, what he's saying isn't mockable, it's very decent stuff\", said Idle later. After settling on the name Brian for their new protagonist, one idea considered was that of \"the 13th disciple\". The focus eventually shifted to a separate individual born at a similar time and location who would be mistaken for the Messiah, but had no desire to be followed as such.\nThe first draft of the screenplay, provisionally titled \"The Gospel According to St. Brian\", was ready by Christmas 1976. The final pre-production draft was ready in January 1978, following \"a concentrated two-week writing and water-skiing period in Barbados\".\nFinance originally came from EMI Films under Michael Deeley and Barry Spikings - EMI had distributed \"Holy Grail\". However head of EMI, Bernard Delfont, was scared off at the last minute by the subject matter and pulled finance. Python fan and former Beatle George Harrison set up HandMade Films along with Denis O'Brien to help fund the film at a cost of \u00a33\u00a0million. Harrison put up the money for it as he \"wanted to see the movie\"\u2014later described by Terry Jones as the \"world's most expensive cinema ticket\". The very last words in the film are: \"I said to him, 'Bernie, they'll never make their money back on this one'\", teasing Delfont for his lack of faith in the project. Terry Gilliam later said, \"They pulled out on the Thursday. The crew was supposed to be leaving on the Saturday. Disastrous. It was because they read the script ... finally.\" \nAs a reward for his help, Harrison appears in a cameo appearance as Mr. Papadopoulos, \"owner of the Mount\", who briefly shakes hands with Brian in a crowd scene (at 1:08:50 in the film). His one word of dialogue (a cheery but out of place Scouse \"'ullo\") had to be dubbed in later by Michael Palin.\nFilming.\nTerry Jones was solely responsible for directing, having amicably agreed with Gilliam (who co-directed \"Holy Grail\") to do so, with Gilliam concentrating on the look of the film. \"Holy Grail\"'s production had often been stilted by their differences behind the camera. Gilliam again contributed two animated sequences (one being the opening credits) and took charge of set design. However, this did not put an absolute end to their feuding. On the DVD commentary, Gilliam expresses pride in one set in particular, the main hall of Pilate's fortress, which had been designed so that it looked like an ancient synagogue that the Romans had converted by dumping their structural artefacts (such as marble floors and columns) on top. He reveals his consternation at Jones for not paying enough attention to it in the cinematography. Gilliam also worked on the matte paintings, useful in particular for the very first shot of the three wise men against a star-scape and in giving the illusion of the whole of the outside of the fortress being covered in graffiti. Perhaps the most significant contribution from Gilliam was the scene in which Brian accidentally leaps off a high building and lands inside a starship about to engage in an interstellar war. This was done \"in camera\" using a hand-built model starship and miniature pyrotechnics. Gilliam recounted in an interview: \"Well, we didn't know what to do with Brian. He got himself to the top of the tower and we had to rescue him somehow, so I said, 'OK, spaceship for that.' That was purely it. It was funny, because this was at the time when \"Star Wars\" had just come out.\"\nThe film was shot on location in Monastir, Tunisia, which allowed the production to reuse sets from Franco Zeffirelli's \"Jesus of Nazareth\" (1977). The Tunisian shoot was documented by Iain Johnstone for his BBC film \"The Pythons\". Many locals were employed as extras on \"Life of Brian\". Director Jones noted, \"They were all very knowing because they'd all worked for Franco Zeffirelli on \"Jesus of Nazareth\", so I had these elderly Tunisians telling me, 'Well, Mr Zeffirelli wouldn't have done it like that, you know.'\" Further location shooting also took place in Tunisia, at Sousse (Jerusalem outer walls and gateway), Carthage (Roman theatre) and Matmata (Sermon on the Mount and Crucifixion).\nGraham Chapman, suffering from alcoholism, was so determined to play the lead role\u2014at one point coveted by Cleese\u2014that he sobered up in time for filming, so much so that he also acted as the on-set doctor.\nRough cut and pre-screenings.\nFollowing shooting between 16 September and 12 November 1978, a two-hour rough cut of the film was put together for its first private showing in January 1979. Over the next few months \"Life of Brian\" was re-edited and re-screened a number of times for different preview audiences, losing a number of entire filmed sequences.\nEditing.\nA number of scenes were cut during the editing process. Five deleted scenes, a total of 13 minutes, including the controversial \"Otto\", were first made available in 1997 on the Criterion Collection Laserdisc. An unknown amount of raw footage was destroyed in 1998 by the company that bought Handmade Films. However, a number of them (of varying quality) were shown the following year on the Paramount Comedy Channel in the UK. The scenes shown included three shepherds discussing sheep and completely missing the arrival of the angel heralding Jesus's birth, which would have been at the very start of the film; a segment showing the attempted kidnap of Pilate's wife (a large woman played by John Case) whose escape results in a fistfight; a scene introducing hardline Zionist Otto, leader of the Judean People's Front (played by Eric Idle), and his men who practise a suicide run in the courtyard; and a brief scene in which Judith releases some birds into the air in an attempt to summon help. The shepherds' scene has badly distorted sound, and the kidnap scene has poor colour quality. The same scenes that were on the Criterion laserdisc can now be found on the Criterion Collection DVD.\nThe most controversial cuts were the scenes involving Otto, an extremist Zionist leader, initially a recurring character, who had a thin Adolf Hitler moustache and spoke with a German accent. Otto would shout accusations of \"racial impurity\" at Judeans who were conceived (as Brian was) when their mothers were raped by Roman centurions, as well as other Nazi phrases. The logo of the Judean People's Front, designed by Terry Gilliam, was a Star of David with a small line added to each point so it resembled a swastika, most familiar in the West as the symbol of the anti-Semitic Nazi movement. The rest of this faction also all had the same thin moustaches, and wore a spike on their helmets, similar to those on Imperial German helmets. The official reason for the cutting was that Otto's dialogue slowed down the narrative. However, Gilliam, writing in \"The Pythons Autobiography by The Pythons\", said he thought it should have stayed, saying \"Listen, we've alienated the Christians, let's get the Jews now.\" Idle himself was said to have been uncomfortable with the character; \"It's essentially a pretty savage attack on rabid Zionism, suggesting it's rather akin to Nazism, which is a bit strong to take, but certainly a point of view.\" Michael Palin's personal journal entries from the period when various edits of \"Brian\" were being test-screened consistently reference the Pythons' and filmmakers' concerns that the Otto scenes were slowing the story down and thus were top of the list to be chopped from the final cut of the film. However, Oxford Brookes University historian David Nash says the removal of the scene represented \"a form of self-censorship\" and the Otto sequence \"which involved a character representative of extreme forms of Zionism\" was cut \"in the interests of smoothing the way for the film's distribution in America.\"\nThe only scene with Otto that remains in the film is during the crucifixion sequence. Otto arrives with his \"crack suicide squad\", sending the Roman soldiers fleeing in terror. Instead of doing anything useful, the squad stab themselves to death as Brian watches. Terry Jones once mentioned that the only reason this excerpt was not cut too was due to continuity reasons, as their dead bodies were very prominently placed throughout the rest of the scene. He acknowledged that some of the humour of this sole remaining contribution was lost through the earlier edits, but felt they were necessary to the overall pacing.\nOtto's scenes, and those with Pilate's wife, were cut from the film after the script had gone to the publishers, and so they can be found in the published version of the script. Also present is a scene where, after Brian has led the Fifth Legion to the headquarters of the People's Front of Judea, Reg (John Cleese) says \"You cunt!! You stupid, bird-brained, flat-headed...\" The profanity was overdubbed to \"you klutz\" before the film was released. Cleese approved of this editing as he felt the reaction to the profanity would \"get in the way of the comedy.\"\nAn early listing of the sequence of sketches reprinted in \"Monty Python: The Case Against\" by Robert Hewison reveals that the film was to have begun with a set of sketches at an English public school. Much of this material was first printed in the \"Monty Python's The Life of Brian / Monty Python Scrapbook\" that accompanied the original script publication of \"The Life of Brian\" and then subsequently reused. The song \"All Things Dull and Ugly\" and the parody scripture reading \"Martyrdom of St. Victor\" were performed on \"Monty Python's Contractual Obligation Album\" (1980). The idea of a violent rugby match between school masters and small boys was filmed in \"Monty Python's The Meaning of Life\" (1983). A sketch about a boy who dies at school appeared on the unreleased \"The Hastily Cobbled Together for a Fast Buck Album\" (1981).\nSoundtrack.\nAn album was also released by Monty Python in 1979 in conjunction with the film. In addition to the \"Brian Song\" and \"Always Look on the Bright Side of Life\", it contains scenes from the film with brief linking sections performed by Eric Idle and Graham Chapman. The album opens with a brief rendition of \"Hava Nagila\" on Scottish bagpipes. A CD version was released in 1997.\nAn album of the songs sung in \"Monty Python's Life of Brian\" was released on the Disky label. \"Always Look on the Bright Side of Life\" was later re-released with great success, after being sung by British football fans. Its popularity became truly evident in 1982 during the Falklands War when sailors aboard the destroyer HMS \"Sheffield\", severely damaged in an Argentinean Exocet missile attack on 4 May, started singing it while awaiting rescue. Many people have come to see the song as a life-affirming ode to optimism. One of its more famous renditions was by the dignitaries of Manchester's bid to host the 2000 Olympic Games, just after they were awarded to Sydney. Idle later performed the song as part of the 2012 Summer Olympics closing ceremony. \"Always Look on the Bright Side of Life\" is also featured in Eric Idle's \"Spamalot\", a Broadway musical based upon \"Monty Python and the Holy Grail\", and was sung by the rest of the Monty Python group at Graham Chapman's memorial service and at the \"Monty Python Live at Aspen\" special. The song is a staple at Iron Maiden concerts, where the recording is played after the final encore.\nRelease.\nFor the original British and Australian releases, a spoof travelogue narrated by John Cleese, \"Away from It All\", was shown before the film itself. It consisted mostly of stock travelogue footage and featured arch comments from Cleese. For instance, a shot of Bulgarian girls in ceremonial dresses was accompanied by the comment \"Hard to believe, isn't it, that these simple happy folk are dedicated to the destruction of Western civilisation as we know it!\", Communist Bulgaria being a member of the Warsaw Pact at the time. Not only was this a spoof of travelogues \"per se\", it was a protest against the then common practice in Britain of showing cheaply made banal short features before a main feature.\n\"Life of Brian\" opened on 17 August 1979 in five North American theatres and grossed US$140,034 ($28,007 per screen) in its opening weekend. Its total gross was $19,398,164. It was the highest grossing British film in North America that year. \nReleased on 8 November 1979 at the Plaza Theatre in London, the film became the fourth highest-grossing film in the United Kingdom in 1979. It opened at number one in London, grossing a house record \u00a340,470 in its opening week, beating the record set by \"Jaws\" three years previously by almost \u00a39,000. It remained number one in London for six weeks, grossing \u00a3216,355 at the Plaza and expanding to the Ritz in its sixth week, setting a house record \u00a316,991 there, and giving it a higher gross in its sixth week (\u00a346,329) than in its first.\nOn 30 April 2004, \"Life of Brian\" was re-released on five North American screens to \"cash in\" (as Terry Jones put it) on the box office success of Mel Gibson's \"The Passion of the Christ\". It grossed $26,376 ($5,275 per screen) in its opening weekend. It ran until October 2004, playing at 28 screens at its widest point, eventually grossing $646,124 during its re-release. By comparison, a re-release of \"Monty Python and the Holy Grail\" had earned $1.8 million three years earlier. A DVD of the film was also released that year.\nReception.\nReviews from critics were mostly positive on the film's release. Movie historian Leonard Maltin reported that \"This will probably offend every creed and denomination equally, but it shouldn't. The funniest and most sustained feature from Britain's bad boys.\" Vincent Canby of \"The New York Times\" called the film \"the foulest-spoken biblical epic ever made, as well as the best-humored\u2014a nonstop orgy of assaults, not on anyone's virtue, but on the funny bone. It makes no difference that some of the routines fall flat because there are always others coming along immediately after that succeed.\" Roger Ebert gave the film three stars out of four, writing, \"What's endearing about the Pythons is their good cheer, their irreverence, their willingness to allow comic situations to develop through a gradual accumulation of small insanities.\" Gene Siskel of the \"Chicago Tribune\" gave the film three and a half stars, calling it \"a gentle but very funny parody of the life of Jesus, as well as of biblical movies.\" Kevin Thomas of the \"Los Angeles Times\" declared, \"Even those of us who find Monty Python too hit-and-miss and gory must admit that its latest effort has numerous moments of hilarity.\" Clyde Jeavons of \"The Monthly Film Bulletin\" wrote that the script was \"occasionally over-raucous and crude\", but found the second half of the film \"cumulatively hilarious\", with \"a splendidly tasteless finale, which even Mel Brooks might envy.\" Richard Grenier, writing in the neoconservative magazine \"Commentary\", said \"\"Life of Brian\" contains appreciably more mocking of faddish radicalism and Third World 'national-liberation movements' than it does of religion,\" citing numerous examples in the film of satire at the expense of \"left-wing ideas about imperialism, feminism, and terrorism,\" reflecting a satirical omnivorousness that Grenier associated with \"the tradition of what might be called 'Tory wit,' reaching back to Congreve and Swift and all the way forward to Evelyn Waugh and Kingsley Amis.\" Gary Arnold of \"The Washington Post\" had a negative opinion of the film, writing that it was \"a cruel fiction to foster the delusion that 'Brian' is bristling with blasphemous nifties and throbbing with impious wit. If only it were! One might find it easier to keep from nodding off.\"\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\n\"Despite the numerous Biblical references, the film is not about Christ, but a nearly-messiah named Brian whose misfortune sees him worshipped by three wise but lost men, accrue disciples, and ultimately crucified for his efforts at pursuing a simple life. Funded by ex-Beatle George Harrison, and fiercely lobbied against on its release, this film has secured a place in cinematic history.\"\n\u2014Channel 4 entry for \"Life of Brian\" which ranked first on their list of the 50 Greatest Comedy Films.\nOver time, \"Life of Brian\" has regularly been cited as a significant contender for the title \"greatest comedy film of all time\", and has been named as such in polls conducted by \"Total Film\" magazine in 2000, the British TV network Channel 4 where it topped the poll in the 50 Greatest Comedy Films, and \"The Guardian\" in 2007. Rotten Tomatoes lists it as one of the best reviewed comedies, with a 96% approval rating from 67 published reviews, with an average rating of 8.3/10. Its critical consensus reads, \"One of the more cutting-edge films of the 1970s, this religious farce from the classic comedy troupe is as poignant as it is funny and satirical.\" Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the a score of 77 out of 100, based on 15 critics, indicating .\nIn 1999 the BFI declared \"Life of Brian\" to be the 28th best British film of all time. It was the seventh highest ranking comedy on this list (four of the better placed efforts were classic Ealing Films). Another Channel 4 poll in 2001 named it the 23rd greatest film of all time (the only comedy that came higher was Billy Wilder's \"Some Like It Hot\", which was ranked 5th). A 2011 poll by \"Time Out\" magazine ranked it as the third greatest comedy film ever made, behind \"Airplane!\" and \"This is Spinal Tap\". In 2016, \"Empire\" magazine ranked \"Life of Brian\" 2nd in their list of the 100 best British films, with only David Lean's \"Lawrence of Arabia\" ranking higher.\nVarious polls have voted the line, \"He's not the Messiah, he's a very naughty boy!\" (spoken by Brian's mother Mandy to the crowd assembled outside her house), to be the funniest in film history. Other famous lines from the film have featured in polls, such as, \"What have the Romans ever done for us?\" and \"I'm Brian and so's my wife\".\nControversies.\nInitial criticism and blasphemy accusations.\nRichard Webster comments in \"A Brief History of Blasphemy\" (1990) that \"internalised censorship played a significant role in the handling\" of \"Monty Python's Life of Brian\". In his view, \"As a satire on religion, this film might well be considered a rather slight production. As blasphemy it was, even in its original version, extremely mild. Yet the film was surrounded from its inception by intense anxiety, in some quarters of the Establishment, about the offence it might cause. As a result it gained a certificate for general release only after some cuts had been made. Perhaps more importantly still, the film was shunned by the BBC and ITV, who declined to show it for fear of offending Christians in the UK. Once again a blasphemy was restrained \u2013 or its circulation effectively curtailed \u2013 not by the force of law but by the internalisation of this law.\" On its initial release in the UK, the film was banned by several town councils \u2013 some of which had no cinemas within their boundaries, or had not even seen the film. A member of Harrogate council, one of those that banned the film, revealed during a television interview that the council had not seen the film, and had based their opinion on what they had been told by the Nationwide Festival of Light, a grouping with an evangelical Christian base, of which they knew nothing.\nIn New York (the film's release in the US preceded British distribution), screenings were picketed by both rabbis and nuns (\"Nuns with banners!\" observed Michael Palin). It was also banned for eight years in Ireland and for a year in Norway (it was marketed in Sweden as \"The film that is so funny that it was banned in Norway\"). During the film's theatrical run in Finland, a text explaining that the film was a parody of Hollywood historical epics was added to the opening credits.\nIn the UK, Mary Whitehouse, and other traditionalist Christians, pamphleteered and picketed locations where the local cinema was screening the film, a campaign that was felt to have boosted publicity. Leaflets arguing against the film's representation of the New Testament (for example, suggesting that the Wise Men would not have approached the wrong stable as they do in the opening of the film) were documented in Robert Hewison's book \"Monty Python: The Case Against\".\nCrucifixion issue.\nOne of the most controversial scenes was the film's ending: Brian's crucifixion. Many Christian protesters said that it was mocking Jesus' suffering by turning it into a \"Jolly Boys Outing\" (such as when Mr Cheeky turns to Brian and says: \"See, not so bad once you're up!\"), capped by Brian's fellow sufferers suddenly bursting into song. This is reinforced by the fact that several characters throughout the film claim crucifixion is not as bad as it seems. For example, when Brian asks his cellmate in prison what will happen to him, he replies: \"Oh, you'll probably get away with crucifixion\". In another example, Matthias, an old man who works with the People's Front of Judea, dismisses crucifixion as \"a doddle\" and says being stabbed would be worse.\nThe director, Terry Jones, issued the following response to this criticism: \"Any religion that makes a form of torture into an icon that they worship seems to me a pretty sick sort of religion quite honestly.\" The Pythons also pointed out that crucifixion was a standard form of execution in ancient times and not just one especially reserved for Jesus.\nResponses from the cast.\nShortly after the film was released, Cleese and Palin engaged in a debate on the BBC2 discussion programme \"Friday Night, Saturday Morning\" with Malcolm Muggeridge and Mervyn Stockwood, the Bishop of Southwark, who put forward arguments against the film. Muggeridge and Stockwood, it was later claimed, had arrived 15 minutes late to see a screening of the picture prior to the debate, missing the establishing scenes demonstrating that Brian and Jesus were two different characters, and hence contended that it was a send-up of Christ himself. Both Pythons later felt that there had been a strange role reversal in the manner of the debate, with two young upstart comedians attempting to make serious, well-researched points, while the Establishment figures engaged in cheap jibes and point scoring. They also expressed disappointment in Muggeridge, whom all in Python had previously respected as a satirist (he had recently converted to Christianity after meeting Mother Teresa and experiencing what he described as a miracle). Cleese stated that his reputation had \"plummeted\" in his eyes, while Palin commented, \"He was just being Muggeridge, preferring to have a very strong contrary opinion as opposed to none at all.\" Muggeridge's verdict on the film was that it was \"Such a tenth-rate film that it couldn't possibly destroy anyone's genuine faith.\" In a 2013 interview on BBC Radio 4, Cleese stated that having recently watched the discussion again he \"was astonished, first of all, at how stupid [the two members of the Church] were, and how boring the debate became\". He added: \"I think the sad thing was that there was absolutely no attempt at a proper discussion \u2013 no attempt to find any common ground.\"\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\n\"We always stated Brian wasn't blasphemous, but heretical. It wasn't about what Christ was saying, but about the people who followed Him \u2013 the ones who for the next 2,000 years would torture and kill each other because they couldn't agree on what He was saying about peace and love.\"\n\u2014Terry Jones speaking in 2011.\nThe Pythons unanimously deny that they were ever out to destroy people's faith. On the DVD audio commentary, they contend that the film is heretical because it lampoons the practices of modern organised religion, but that it does not blasphemously lampoon the God that Christians and Jews worship. When Jesus does appear in the film (on the Mount, speaking the Beatitudes), he is played straight (by actor Kenneth Colley) and portrayed with respect. The music and lighting make it clear that there is a genuine aura around him. The comedy begins when members of the crowd mishear his statements of peace, love and tolerance (\"I think he said, 'blessed are the cheese makers'\"). Importantly, he is distinct from the character of Brian, which is also evident in the scene where an annoying and ungrateful ex-leper pesters Brian for money, while moaning that since Jesus cured him, he has lost his source of income in the begging trade (referring to Jesus as a \"bloody do-gooder\").\nJames Crossley, however, has argued that the film makes the distinction between Jesus and the character of Brian to make a contrast between the traditional Christ of both faith and cinema and the historical figure of Jesus in critical scholarship and how critical scholars have argued that ideas later got attributed to Jesus by his followers. Crossley points out that the film uses the character of Brian to address a number of potentially controversial scholarly theories about Jesus, such as the Messianic Secret, the Jewishness of Jesus, Jesus the revolutionary, and having a single mother.\nIn the DVD's audio commentary, Terry Gilliam says, \"We were pilloried by religious groups on all sides from Jews to Catholics to Protestants. To me, what's important is that we managed to offend a lot of people. But as you notice, we were very cautious about offending any Muslims. We would say \"nothing\" negative about a Muslim, 'cause we'd get a fatwa after us. But your Jews, your Christians, they're easy to push around.\"\nNot all the Pythons agree on the definition of the movie's tone. There was a brief exchange that occurred when the surviving members reunited in Aspen, Colorado, in 1998. In the section where \"Life of Brian\" is discussed, the following dialogue ensued:\nJones: &lt;q&gt;I think the film is heretical, but it's not blasphemous.&lt;/q&gt;Idle: &lt;q&gt;It's a heresy.&lt;/q&gt;Cleese: &lt;q&gt;I don't think it's a heresy. It's making fun of the way that people misunderstand the teaching.&lt;/q&gt;Jones: &lt;q&gt;Of course it's a heresy, John! It's attacking the Church! And that has to be heretical.&lt;/q&gt;Cleese: &lt;q&gt;No, it's not attacking the Church, necessarily. It's about people who cannot agree with each other.&lt;/q&gt;\nIn a later interview, Jones said the film \"isn't blasphemous because it doesn't touch on belief at all. It is heretical, because it touches on dogma and the interpretation of belief, rather than belief itself.\"\n21st century.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\n\"\"Life of Brian\" is an extraordinary tribute to the life and work and teaching of Jesus \u2013 that they couldn't actually blaspheme or make a joke out of it. It is a wonderful satire on the way that Jesus's own teaching has been used to persecute others. They were satirising fundamentalism and persecution of others and at the same time saying the one person who rises above all this was Jesus.\"\n\u2014Theologian Richard Burridge.\nThe film continues to cause controversy; in February 2007, the Church of St Thomas the Martyr in Newcastle upon Tyne held a public screening in the church itself, with song-sheets, organ accompaniment, stewards in costume and false beards for female members of the audience (alluding to an early scene where a group of women disguise themselves as men so that they are able to take part in a stoning). Although the screening was a sell-out, some Christian groups, notably the conservative Christian Voice, were highly critical of the decision to allow the screening to go ahead. Stephen Green, the head of Christian Voice, insisted that \"You don't promote Christ to the community by taking the mick out of him.\" The Reverend Jonathan Adams, one of the church's clergy, defended his taste in comedy, saying that it did not mock Jesus, and that it raised important issues about the hypocrisy and stupidity that can affect religion. Again on the film's DVD commentary, Cleese also spoke up for religious people who have come forward and congratulated him and his colleagues on the film's highlighting of double standards among purported followers of their own faith.\nSome bans continued into the 21st century. In 2008, Torbay Council finally permitted the film to be shown after it won an online vote for the English Riviera International Comedy Film Festival. In 2009, it was announced that a thirty-year-old ban of the film in the Welsh town of Aberystwyth had finally been lifted, and the subsequent showing was attended by Terry Jones and Michael Palin alongside mayor Sue Jones-Davies (who portrayed Judith Iscariot in the film). However, before the showing, an Aberystwyth University student discovered that a ban had only been discussed by the council and in fact that it had been shown (or scheduled to be shown) at a cinema in the town in 1981. In 2013, a German official in the state of North Rhine-Westphalia considered the film to be possibly offensive to Christians and hence subject to a local regulation prohibiting its public screening on Good Friday, despite protests by local atheists.\nPolitical satire.\nThe film pokes fun at revolutionary groups and 1970s British left-wing politics. According to Roger Wilmut, \"What the film does do is place modern stereotypes in a historical setting, which enables it to indulge in a number of sharp digs, particularly at trade unionists and guerilla organisations\". There are several groups in the film which oppose the Roman occupation of Judea, but fall into the familiar pattern of intense competition among factions that appears, to an outsider, to be over ideological distinctions so small as to be invisible, thus portraying the phenomenon of the narcissism of small differences. The comical naming similarities of the groups were also a satire of fractious divisions between contemporary Palestinian liberation groups, all containing the words \"front\" and \"liberation\" along with \"Palestine\": Palestinian Popular Struggle Front (PPSF) (formed 1967) had broken off from the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP), which had further divisions which led to the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine \u2013 General Command (PFLP-GC) (1968), the Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine (DFLP) (1969), and the Popular Revolutionary Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFRLP) (1972). \nSuch disunity indeed fatally hampered real-life Judean resistance against Roman rule. Michael Palin says that the various separatist movements were modelled on \"modern resistance groups, all with obscure acronyms which they can never remember and their conflicting agendas\".\nThe People's Front of Judea, composed of the Pythons' characters, harangue their \"rivals\" with cries of \"splitters\" and stand vehemently opposed to the Judean People's Front, the Judean People's Popular Front, the Campaign for a Free Galilee, and the Popular Front of Judea (the last composed of a single old man, mocking the size of real revolutionary Trotskyist factions). The infighting among revolutionary organisations is demonstrated most dramatically when the PFJ attempts to kidnap Pontius Pilate's wife, but encounters agents of the Campaign for a Free Galilee, and the two factions begin a violent brawl over which of them conceived of the plan first. When Brian exhorts them to cease their fighting to struggle \"against the common enemy\", the revolutionaries stop and cry in unison, \"the Judean People's Front!\" However, they soon resume their fighting and, with two Roman legionaries watching bemusedly, continue until Brian is left the only survivor, at which point he is captured.\nOther scenes have the freedom fighters wasting time in debate, with one of the debated items being that they should not waste their time debating so much. The famous \"what have the Romans ever done for us\" scene has drawn significant attention, with Python biographer George Perry noting, \"The People's Liberation Front of Judea conducts its meetings as though they have been convened by a group of shop stewards\". This joke is the reverse of a similar conversation recorded in the Babylonian Talmud; some authors have even suggested the joke is based on the Talmudic text.\nFilm analysis.\nThemes and motifs.\nBible.\nThe depictions of Jesus in two short scenes at the start of the film are strongly based on Christian iconography. The resistance fighters leave the Sermon on the Mount, which was a literal recital, angry because Jesus was too pacifistic for them. (\"Well, blessed is just about everyone with a vested interest in the status quo\u2026\") In addition to the respectful depiction of Jesus, the film does not state that there is no God or that Jesus is not the son of God. The appearance of a leper, who says he was healed by Jesus, is in line with the Gospels and their reports about Jesus performing miracles.\nAny direct reference to Jesus disappears after the introductory scenes, yet his life story partially acts as a framework and subtext for the story of Brian. Brian being a bastard of a Roman centurion could refer to the polemic legend that Jesus was the son of the Roman soldier Panthera. Disguised as a prophet, Brian talks about \"\" and states more clearly, \"Don't pass judgment on other people or else you might get judged yourself\": Brian incoherently repeats statements he heard from Jesus.\nAnother significant figure in the film who is named in the Gospels is Pontius Pilate, the central antagonist. Although the humour largely involves Jews, there is no sinister Jew to compare with Judas or Caiaphas. An anti-Semitic interpretation of the story is therefore excluded, according to scholars. The crucifixion scene, a central part of Christian iconography, is viewed from a historical context within the narrative style of the film. It is a historically accurate enactment of a routinely done mass crucifixion.\nBelief and dogmatism.\nThe intended subject of the satire was not Jesus and his teachings but religious dogmatism, according to film theorists and statements from Monty Python. This is made clear in the beginning of the film during the Sermon on the Mount. Not only do the poor acoustics make it more difficult to hear what Jesus says, but the audience fails to interpret what was said correctly and sensibly. When Jesus said, \"blessed are the peacemakers\", the audience understands the phonetically similar word \"Cheesemakers\" and in turn interpret it as a metaphor and beatification of those who produce dairy products.\n\"Life of Brian\" satirises, in the words of David Hume, the \"strong propensity of mankind to [believe in] the extraordinary and the marvellous\". When Brian cuts his sermon short and turns away from the crowd, they mistake his behaviour as not wanting to share the secret to eternal life and follow him everywhere. In their need to submit to an authority, the crowd declares him first a prophet and eventually a messiah. Even when Brian explicitly denies he is the Messiah, they still follow him, rationalizing that only the true Messiah would have the humility to deny his own divine status. The faithful gather beneath Brian's window en masse to receive God's blessing. This is when Brian utters the main message of the film \"you don't need to follow anybody! You've got to think for yourselves!\" Monty Python saw this central message of the satire confirmed with the protests of practising Christians after the film was released.\nAccording to Terry Jones, \"Life of Brian\" \"is not blasphemy but heresy\", because Brian contested the authority of the Church whereas the belief in God remained untouched. He goes on to mention that \"Christ [is] saying all of these wonderful things about people living together in peace and love, and then for the next two thousand years people are putting each other to death in His name because they can't agree on how He said it, or in what order He said it.\" The dispute among the followers about the correct interpretation of a sandal, which Brian lost, is in the words of Terry Jones the \"history of the Church in three minutes\". Kevin Shilbrack shares the view that you can enjoy the movie and still be religious.\nFor the most part, lost in the religious controversy was the film's mockery of factional dogmatism among left-wing parties. According to John Cleese, an almost unmanageable number of left-wing organisations and parties was formed back then in the United Kingdom. He said that it had been so important to each of them to have one pure doctrine that they would rather fight each other than their political opponent. In the film, rather than presenting a common front as their organisational names should imply, the leader of the People's Front of Judea makes it clear that their hate for the Judean Peoples's Front is greater than their hate for the Romans. They are so caught up in constant debates that the \"rather looney bunch of revolutionaries\" indirectly accept the occupying forces as well as their execution methods as a fate they all have to endure. So, in the end, even though they have ample opportunity to rescue Brian, they instead leave Brian on the cross, thanking him for his sacrifice.\nThere is also a sideswipe at the women's movement, which started to draw a lot of attention in the 1970s. In accordance with the language of political activists, resistance fighter Stan wants to exercise \"his right as a man\" to be a woman. The group accepts him from that moment on as Loretta, because the right to give birth was not theirs to take. Also as a result from that, the term sibling replaces the terms brother or sister.\nIndividuality and meaninglessness.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBrian: \"Look, you've got it all wrong. You don't need to follow me. You don't need to follow anybody. You've got to think for yourselves. You're all individuals.\"Crowd in unison: \"YES. WE'RE ALL INDIVIDUALS.\"Brian: \"You're all different.\"Crowd in unison: \"YES. WE'RE ALL DIFFERENT.\"Single person in crowd: \"I'm not...\"\nOne of the most commented-upon scenes in the film is when Brian tells his followers that they are all individuals and don't need to follow anybody. According to Edward Slowik, this is a rare moment in which Monty Python puts a philosophical concept into words so openly and directly. \"Life of Brian\" accurately depicts the existentialist view that everybody needs to give meaning to their own life.\nBrian can thus be called an existentialist following the tradition of Friedrich Nietzsche and Jean-Paul Sartre. He is honest to himself and others and lives as authentic a life as he can. However, Brian is too na\u00efve to be called a hero based on the ideas of Albert Camus. For Camus, the search for the meaning of one's own life takes place in a deeply meaningless and abstruse world. The \"absurd hero\" rebels against this meaninglessness and at the same time holds on to their goals, although they know their fight leaves no impact in the long run. Contrary to that, Brian isn't able to recognize the meaninglessness of his own situation and therefore can't triumph over it.\nIn \"Monty Python and Philosophy\", Kevin Shilbrack states that the fundamental view of the film is that the world is absurd, and every life needs to be lived without a greater meaning. He points out that the second-last verse of the song the film finishes on, \"Always Look on the Bright Side of Life\", expresses this message clearly:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nShilbrack concludes that the finale shows that the executions had no purpose since the deaths were meaningless and no better world was waiting for them. On this note, some people would claim that the film presents a nihilistic world view which contradicts any basis of religion. However, \"Life of Brian\" offers humour to counterbalance the nihilism, Shilbrack states in his text. He comments that \"religion and humour are compatible with each other and you should laugh about the absurdity since you can't fight it.\"\nLegacy.\nLiterature.\nSpin-offs include a script-book \"The Life of Brian of Nazareth\", which was printed back-to-back with \"MONTYPYTHONSCRAPBOOK\" as a single book. The printing of this book also caused problems, due to rarely used laws in the United Kingdom against blasphemy, dictating what can and cannot be written about religion. The publisher refused to print both halves of the book, and original prints were by two companies.\nJulian Doyle, the film's editor, wrote \"The Life of Brian/Jesus\", a book which not only describes the filmmaking and editing process but argues that it is the most accurate Biblical film ever made. In October 2008, a memoir by Kim \"Howard\" Johnson titled \"Monty Python's Tunisian Holiday: My Life with Brian\" was released. Johnson became friendly with the Pythons during the filming of \"Life of Brian\" and the book is based on his notes and memories of the behind-the-scenes filming and make-up.\nMusic.\nWith the success of Eric Idle's musical retelling of \"Monty Python and the Holy Grail\", called \"Spamalot\", Idle announced that he would be giving \"Life of Brian\" a similar treatment. The oratorio, called \"Not the Messiah (He's a Very Naughty Boy)\", was commissioned to be part of the festival called Luminato in Toronto in June 2007, and was written/scored by Idle and John Du Prez, who also worked with Idle on \"Spamalot\". \"Not the Messiah\" is a spoof of Handel's \"Messiah\". It runs approximately 50 minutes, and was conducted at its world premiere by Toronto Symphony Orchestra music director Peter Oundjian, who is Idle's cousin. \"Not the Messiah\" received its US premiere at the Caramoor International Music Festival in Katonah, New York. Oundjian and Idle joined forces once again for a double performance of the oratorio in July 2007.\nOther media.\nIn October 2011, BBC Four premiered the made-for-television comedy film \"Holy Flying Circus\", written by Tony Roche and directed by Owen Harris. The \"Pythonesque\" film explores the events surrounding the 1979 television debate on talk show \"Friday Night, Saturday Morning\" between John Cleese and Michael Palin and Malcolm Muggeridge and Mervyn Stockwood, then Bishop of Southwark.\nIn a \"Not the Nine O'Clock News\" sketch, a bishop who has directed a scandalous film called \"The Life of Christ\" is hauled over the coals by a representative of the \"Church of Python\", claiming that the film is an attack on \"Our Lord, John Cleese\" and on the members of Python, who, in the sketch, are the objects of Britain's true religious faith. This was a parody of the infamous \"Friday Night, Saturday Morning\" programme, broadcast a week previously. The bishop (played by Rowan Atkinson) claims that the reaction to the film has surprised him, as he \"didn't expect the Spanish Inquisition.\"\nRadio host John Williams of Chicago's WGN 720 AM has used \"Always Look on the Bright Side of Life\" in a segment of his Friday shows. The segment is used to highlight good events from the past week in listeners' lives and what has made them smile. In the 1997 film \"As Good as It Gets\", the misanthropic character played by Jack Nicholson sings \"Always Look on the Bright Side of Life\" as evidence of the character's change in attitude.\nA BBC history series \"What the Romans Did for Us\", written and presented by Adam Hart-Davis and broadcast in 2000, takes its title from Cleese's rhetorical question \"What have the Romans ever done for us?\" in one of the film's scenes. (Cleese himself parodied this line in a 1986 BBC advert defending the Television Licence Fee: \"What has the BBC ever given us?\").\nFormer British Prime Minister Tony Blair in his Prime Minister's Questions of 3 May 2006 made a shorthand reference to the types of political groups, \"Judean People's Front\" or \"People's Front of Judea\", lampooned in \"Life of Brian\". This was in response to a question from the Labour MP David Clelland, asking \"What has the Labour government ever done for us?\" \u2013 itself a parody of John Cleese's \"What have the Romans ever done for us?\"\nOn New Year's Day 2007, and again on New Year's Eve, UK television station Channel 4 dedicated an entire evening to the Monty Python phenomenon, during which an hour-long documentary was broadcast called \"The Secret Life of Brian\" about the making of \"The Life of Brian\" and the controversy that was caused by its release. The Pythons featured in the documentary and reflected upon the events that surrounded the film. This was followed by a screening of the film itself. The documentary (in a slightly extended form) was one of the special features on the 2007 DVD re-release \u2013 the \"Immaculate Edition\", also the first Python release on Blu-ray.\nIn June 2014, King's College London hosted an academic conference on the film, in which internationally renowned Biblical scholars and historians discussed the film and its reception, looking both at how the Pythons had made use of scholarship and texts, and how the film can be used creatively within modern scholarship on the Historical Jesus. In a panel discussion, including Terry Jones and theologian Richard Burridge, John Cleese described the event as \"the most interesting thing to come out of Monty Python\". The papers from the conference have gone on to prompt the publication of a book, edited by Joan E. Taylor, the conference organiser, \"Jesus and Brian: Exploring the Historical Jesus and His Times via Monty Python's Life of Brian\", published by Bloomsbury in 2015. Theological Studies Professor Matthew Robert Anderson has drawn on that research to outline the ways that the film is a \"historically accurate\" depiction of the time period and the historical Jesus.\nIn 2023, John Cleese said he was working on a stage version of the film. In 2024, he said he expected it to play in London's West End.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "17921", "revid": "27823944", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=17921", "title": "Lomography", "text": "Genre of photography\nLomography, or simply lomo, is a photographic style which involves taking spontaneous photographs with minimal attention to technical details. Lomographic images often exploit the unpredictable, non-standard optical traits of toy cameras (such as light leaks and irregular lens alignment), and non-standard film processing techniques for aesthetic effect. Similar-looking techniques with digital photography, often involving \"lomo\" image filters in post-processing, may also be considered lomographic.\n\"Lomography\" is claimed as a commercial trademark by Lomographische GmbH. However, it has become a genericised trademark; most camera phone photo editor apps include a \"lomo\" filter.\nHistory.\nWhile cheap plastic toy cameras using film often used in lomography were and are produced by multiple manufacturers, Lomography is named after the Soviet-era cameras produced by Leningradskoye Optiko-Mekhanicheskoye Obyedinenie. Formerly a state-run optics manufacturer, LOMO privatised following the dissolution of the Soviet Union and became LOMO PLC. The company created and produced the 35\u00a0mm LOMO LC-A Compact Automat camera, now central to the lomography movement. This camera was loosely based upon the Cosina CX-1 introduced in the early 1980s. The LOMO LC-A produces \"unique, colorful, and sometimes blurry\" images.\nLomography has been a highly social pursuit since 1992, with local and international events organised by Lomographische GmbH. Lomographische, doing business as Lomography, is also a commercial company selling analogue cameras, films and accessories. The company continues to promote the Lomographic style; however, it is not necessary to use the company's products to take lomographic photos.\nCompany.\nLomographische GmbH, doing business as Lomography, is a commercial company headquartered in Vienna, Austria, which sells cameras, accessories, and film. It hosts local and international events through its non-profit division, the Lomographic Society International. The company is the namesake of the lomography genre of experimental photography.\nThe Lomographic Society International was founded in 1992 by a group of Viennese students interested in the LC-A. Lomography started as an art movement through which the students put on exhibitions of photos; the art movement then developed into the Lomographische AG, a commercial enterprise.\nLomography signed an exclusive distribution agreement with LOMO PLC in 1995\u2014becoming the sole distributor of all LOMO LC-A cameras outside of the former Soviet Union. The new company reached an agreement with the deputy mayor of St Petersburg, the future Russian Prime Minister and President, Vladimir Putin, to receive a tax break in order to keep the LOMO factory in the city open.\nSince the introduction of the original LOMO LC-A, Lomography has produced a line of their own film cameras. In 2005, production of the original LOMO LC-A was discontinued. Its replacement, the LOMO LC-A+, was introduced in 2006. The new camera, made in China rather than Russia, featured the original Russian lens manufactured by LOMO PLC. This changed as of mid-2007 with the lens now made in China as well. In 2012 the LC-A+ camera was re-released as a special edition. It costs ten times the original secondhand value of the old LOMO LC-A.\nThe Lomographic Society International (Lomography) has moved on to produce their own range of analogue cameras, films and accessories. Lomography has also released products catered to digital devices, such as the Smartphone Film Scanner; and several lenses such as the Daguerreotype Achromat lens collection for analogue and digital SLR cameras with Canon EF, Nikon F or Pentax K mounts, inspired by 19th century Daguerreotype photography. In 2013, together with Zenit, Lomography produced a new version of the Petzval Lens designed to work with Canon EF and Nikon F mount SLR cameras.\nSome have questioned the pricing of Lomography's plastic \"toy\" cameras, which run from US$100 to $400.\nModels.\nCameras that have been marketed by Lomography:\nFilm.\nThe company produces 35\u00a0mm, 120 and 110 film in color negative, black and white as well as redscale. Lomography also produces its own range of experimental color-shifting film called LomoChrome.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "17922", "revid": "2790592", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=17922", "title": "Loglan", "text": "Constructed language\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Infobox/styles-images.css\" /&gt;\nLoglan is a logical constructed language originally designed for linguistic research, particularly for investigating the Sapir\u2013Whorf hypothesis. The language was developed beginning in 1955 by Dr.\u00a0James Cooke Brown with the goal of making a language so different from natural languages that people learning it would think in a different way if the hypothesis were true. In 1960, \"Scientific American\" published an article introducing the language. Loglan is the first among, and the main inspiration for, the languages known as logical languages, which also includes Lojban.\nBrown founded The Loglan Institute (TLI) to develop the language and other applications of it. He always considered the language an incomplete research project, and although he released many publications about its design, he continued to claim legal restrictions on its use. Because of this, a group of his followers later formed the Logical Language Group to create the language Lojban along the same principles, but with the intention to make it freely available and encourage its use as a real language.\nSupporters of Lojban use the term \"Loglan\" as a generic term to refer to both their own language and Brown's \"Loglan\", referred to as \"TLI Loglan\" when in need of disambiguation. Although the non-trademarkability of the term \"Loglan\" was eventually upheld by the United States Patent and Trademark Office, many supporters and members of The Loglan Institute find this usage offensive and reserve \"Loglan\" for the TLI version of the language.\nGoals.\nLoglan (an abbreviation for \"logical language\") was created to investigate whether people speaking a \"logical language\" would in some way think more logically, as the Sapir\u2013Whorf hypothesis might predict. The language's grammar is based on predicate logic. The grammar was intended to be small enough to be teachable and manageable, yet complex enough to allow people to think and converse in the language.\nBrown intended Loglan to be as culturally neutral as possible and metaphysically parsimonious, which means that obligatory categories are kept to a minimum. An example of an obligatory category in English is the time-tense of verbs, as it is impossible to express a finite verb without also expressing a tense.\nBrown also intended the language to be completely regular and unambiguous. Each sentence can be parsed in only one way. Furthermore, the syllabic structure of words was designed so that a sequence of syllables can be separated into words in only one way, even if the word separation is not clear from pauses in speech. It has a small number of phonemes, so that regional \"accents\" are less likely to produce unintelligible speech. To make the vocabulary easier to learn, words were constructed to have elements in common with related words in the world's eight most widely spoken languages.\nAlphabet and pronunciation.\nThe alphabet of Loglan has two historical versions. In that of 1975 there were only 21 letters with their corresponding phonemes. In the final version of 1989 five more phonemes had been incorporated: letter H (/h/) was added to the alphabet in 1977 by popular demand; letter Y (/\u0259/) was added in 1982 to work as a kind of hyphen between the terms of a complex word; letters Q (/\u03b8/), W (/y/) and X (/x/) were added in 1986 in order to allow the incorporation of the Linnaean vocabulary of biology, and they were useful to give more exact pronunciations to many borrowed names.\nGrammar.\nLoglan has three types of words: \"predicates\" (also called \"content words\"), \"structure words\" (also called \"little words\"), and \"names\". The majority of words are predicates; these are words that carry meaning. Structure words are words that modify predicates or show how they are related to each other, like English conjunctions and prepositions. \nThe class of a word can be determined from its form. A predicate has always two or more syllables, the last syllable being of the form CV, and the other syllables being of the form CVC or CCV. Thus, possible predicates are \"kanto\", \"stari\", \"simgroma\", \"nirpatretka\", and so on. A structure word has always one or more syllables, each syllable being one of the four forms V, VV, CV, or CVV. Thus possible structure words are \"e\", \"ai\", \"ga\", \"kia\", \"lemio\", \"inorau\" and so on. A name may have any form but always ends with a consonant, which distinguishes names from other words, since predicates and structure words always end in a vowel. Names in Loglan are spelled in accordance with Loglan phonetics, so if the name comes from another language, the Loglan spelling may differ from the spelling in that language. If a name in its native language ends in a vowel, it is conventional to add an \"s\" to form the Loglan name; for example, the English name \"Mary\" is rendered in Loglan as \"Meris\" (pronounced /\u02c8m\u025bri\u02d0s/).\nPredicates.\nLoglan makes no distinction between nouns, verbs, adjectives and adverbs. A predicate may act as any of these, depending on its position in a sentence. Each predicate has its own argument structure with fixed positions for arguments. For example: \"vedma\" is the word for \"sell\". It takes four arguments: the seller, the item sold, the buyer and the price, in that order. When a predicate is used as a verb, the first argument appears before the predicate, and any subsequent arguments appear after it. So \"S pa vedma T B P\" means \"S sold T to B for price P\". (The structure word \"pa\" is the past-tense marker, discussed in more detail below.) Not all arguments need to be present; for example, \"S pa vedma T B\" means \"S sold T to B\", \"S pa vedma T\" means \"S sold T\", and \"S pa vedma\" simply means \"S sold (something)\".\nCertain structure words can be used to reorder the arguments of a predicate, to emphasize one of the arguments by putting it first. For example, \"nu\" swaps the first and second arguments of any predicate. So \"T pa nu vedma S\" means the same thing as \"S pa vedma T\" and might be translated \"T was sold by S\". Similarly, \"fu\" swaps the first and third argument, and \"ju\" swaps the first and fourth argument. Thus \"B pa fu vedma T S\" = \"B bought T from S\", and \"P pa ju vedma T B\" = \"P was paid to buy T by B\".\nArguments.\nThe structure word \"le\" makes a predicate behave as a noun, so that it can be used as an argument of another predicate. The three-place predicate \"matma\" means \"M is the mother of C by father F\", so \"le matma\" means \"the mother\". Thus \"Le matma pa vedma\" means \"the mother sold (something)\", while \"Le vedma pa matma\" means \"the seller was a mother (of someone)\".\nA name can be used as an argument by preceding it with the structure word \"la\". Thus \"La Adam vedma\" means \"Adam sells\". Unlike in English and many other languages, this structure word is required; an unadorned name cannot be used as an argument. (The sentence \"Adam vedma\" is an imperative meaning \"Adam, sell (something).\" In this case, the name is used as a noun of address, not as an argument.) \nA name, or any other word or phrase, can be explicitly quoted with the structure words \"li\" and \"lu\" to use the word itself, rather than the thing that word refers to, as an argument. Thus \"Li Adam lu corta purda\" means \"\"Adam\" is a short word.\" Without the li/lu quotes, the sentence \"La Adam corta purda\" (\"Adam is a short word\") would claim that Adam, the person himself, is a short word.\nPredicate modifiers.\nAny predicate can be used as an adjective or adverb by placing the predicate before the expression that it modifies. The predicate \"sadji\" means \"X is wiser than Y about Z\". So \"Le sadji matma pa vedma\" means \"The wise mother sold\", and \"Le matma vedma pa sadji\" means \"The motherly seller was wise\". Predicates can be used adverbially to modify the main predicate in the sentence in the same way. So \"Le matma pa sadji vedma\" means \"The mother wisely sold\". The structure word \"go\" can be used to invert the normal word order, so that the modifier follows the expression being modified. Thus \"le matma go sadji\" (the mother who is wise) means the same as \"le sadji matma\" (the wise mother).\nA string of more than two predicates is left-associative. This grouping can be changed by using the structure word \"ge\", which groups what follows into a single unit. Thus Loglan can distinguish between the many possible meanings of the ambiguous English phrase \"the pretty little girls' school\", as in these examples:\nPredicates can be modified to indicate the time at which something occurred (English tense) with the optional structure words \"na\" (present), \"pa\" (past) and \"fa\" (future). Thus \"Le matma na vedma\" means \"The mother is (now) selling\", while \"Le matma fa vedma\" means \"The mother will sell\". Marking the verb for tense is optional, so the word \"ga\" can be used when the time is not being specified. So \"Le matma ga vedma\" means \"The mother sells (at some unspecified time in the past, present or future)\".\nFree variables.\nA set of structure words called \"free variables\" are used like English pronouns, but are designed to avoid the ambiguity of pronouns in such sentences as \"Adam told Greg that he needed to leave.\" The free variable \"da\" refers to the most recently mentioned noun, \"de\" refers to the one mentioned prior to that, \"di\" to the one prior to that, and so on. Compare the sentences\nFree variables apply equally to people of any gender and inanimate objects; there is no distinction similar to that between English \"he\", \"she\" and \"it\". This explains why \"di\" rather than \"de\" was used in the second example. \"La Adam pa vedma le negda la Greg i de gacpi\" would mean \"Adam sold the egg to Greg; it (the egg) was happy.\"\nConjunctions.\nLoglan has several sets of conjunctions to express the fourteen possible logical connectives. One set is used to combine predicate expressions (\"e\" = and, \"a\" = inclusive or, \"o\" = if and only if), and another set is used to combine predicates to make more complex predicates (\"ce\", \"ca\", \"co\"). The sentence \"La Kim matma e sadji\" means \"Kim is a mother and is wise\", while \"La Kim matma ce sadji vedma\" means \"Kim is a motherly and wise seller\", or \"Kim sells in a motherly and wise manner\". In the latter sentence, \"ce\" is used to combine matma and sadji into one predicate which modifies vedma. The sentence \"La Kim matma e sadji vedma\", using \"e\" rather than \"ce\", would mean \"Kim is a mother and wisely sells.\"\nOther logical connectives are based on the elementary connectives \"e\", \"a\" and \"o\", along with the negation word \"no\". For example, logical implication is indicated by the word \"noa\". The word is chosen to make it easy for a Loglan speaker to see that \"A noa B\" is logically equivalent to \"no A a B\". Brown argues that it is thus easier in Loglan than in English to see that two sentences like these are different ways of saying the same thing:\nThe conjunction \"a\" expresses the inclusive-or relation; that is, one of the two alternatives is true, or possibly both. The exclusive-or relation, in which only one of the alternatives is true, but not both, is expressed by a different word, \"onoi\". Again, the word is chosen to make clear the logical equivalence of \"A o no B\" and \"A onoi B\":\nA special conjunction \"ze\" is used to create a \"mixed\" predicate which may be true even if it is not necessarily true for either of the component predicates. For example, \"Le negda ga nigro ze blabi\" means \"The egg is black-and-white\". This would be true if the egg were striped or speckled; in that case it would not be true that the egg is black nor that it is white. On the other hand, \"Le negda ga nigro e blabi\" would make the claim that \"The egg is black and (it is also) white\".\nAttitude indicators.\nThere is a set of words used for expressing attitudes about what one is saying, which convey conviction, intention, obligation and emotion.

He is traditionally credited as the founder of atomism, which he developed with his student Democritus. Leucippus divided the world into two entities: atoms, indivisible particles that make up all things, and the void, the nothingness that exists between the atoms. He developed his philosophy as a response to the Eleatics, who believed that all things are one and the void does not exist. Leucippus's ideas were influential in ancient and Renaissance philosophy. Leucippus was the first Western philosopher to develop the concept of atoms, but his ideas only bear a superficial resemblance to modern atomic theory.\nLeucippus's atoms come in infinitely many forms and exist in constant motion, creating a deterministic world in which everything is caused by the collisions of atoms. Leucippus described the beginning of the cosmos as a vortex of atoms that formed the Earth, the Sun, the stars, and other celestial bodies. As Leucippus considered both atoms and the void to be infinite, he presumed that other worlds must exist as cosmoses are formed elsewhere. Leucippus and Democritus described the soul as an arrangement of spherical atoms, which are cycled through the body through respiration and create thought and sensory input.\nThe only records of Leucippus come from Aristotle and Theophrastus, ancient philosophers who lived after him, and little is known of his life. Most scholars agree that Leucippus existed, but some have questioned this, instead attributing his ideas purely to Democritus. Contemporary philosophers rarely distinguish their respective ideas. Two works are attributed to Leucippus (\"The Great World System\" and \"On Mind\"), but all of his writing has been lost with the exception of one sentence.\nLife.\nAlmost nothing is known about the life of Leucippus. He was born in the first half of the 5th century BCE, and he presumably developed the philosophy of atomism during the 430s BCE, but the exact dates are unknown. Though he was a contemporary of the philosopher Socrates, Leucippus is categorized as a pre-Socratic philosopher because he continued the pre-Socratic tradition of physical inquiry that began with the Milesian philosophers. Leucippus is traditionally understood to have been a student of Zeno of Elea, though various ancient records have suggested Melissus of Samos, Parmenides, and Pythagoras as possible instructors of Leucippus. No students of Leucippus have been confirmed other than Democritus. Epicurus has been described as a student of Leucippus, but Epicurus has also been said to have denied the existence of Leucippus.\nMiletus, Elea, and Abdera have all been suggested as places where Leucippus lived, but these are most likely described as his home city because of their associations with other philosophers: Miletus was associated with the Ionian School that influenced Leucippus, Elea was associated with the Eleatic philosophers whom Leucippus challenged, and Abdera was the home of his student Democritus. Some 20th-century classicists such as Walther Kranz and John Burnet have suggested that he lived in all three cities\u2014that he was born in Miletus before studying under Zeno in Elea and then settling in Abdera.\nPhilosophy.\nAtoms.\nLeucippus is credited with developing the philosophical school of atomism. He proposed that all things are made up of microscopic, indivisible particles that interact and combine to produce all the things of the world. The atoms postulated by Leucippus come in infinitely many shapes and sizes, although the size and shape of each atom is fixed and unchanging. They are in a state of constant motion and continuously change arrangements with one another. He reasoned that there must be infinite types of atoms because there is no reason why there should not be.\nAccording to the 4th-century BCE philosopher Aristotle, Leucippus argued that logically there must be indivisible points in everything. His reasoning was that if an object was made entirely of divisible points, then it would not have any structure and it would be intangible. Leucippus developed atomism along with his student, Democritus; while Leucippus is credited with the philosophy's creation, Democritus is understood to have elaborated upon it and applied it to natural phenomena.\nTwo works are attributed to Leucippus: \"The Great World System\" and \"On Mind\". The former may have originally been titled \"The World System\" and then later renamed to avoid confusion with Democritus's \"The Little World System\". Leucippus's \"The Great World System\" has sometimes been attributed to Democritus. Only one extant fragment is attributed to Leucippus, taken from \"On Mind\": \"Nothing happens at random, but everything for a reason and by necessity\". Leucippus believed that all things must happen deterministically, as the positions and motions of the atoms guarantee that they will collide in a certain way, invoking the principle of causality. This was reminiscent of the 6th-century BCE philosopher Anaximander's argument that movement is created by differences, and it was later codified by the 17th-century philosopher Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz with the principle of sufficient reason. Leucippus rejected the idea that there was an intelligent force governing the universe.\nEleatics and the void.\nLeucippus's atomism was a direct response to Eleatic philosophy. The Eleatics believed that nothingness, or the void, cannot exist in its own right. They concluded that if there is no void, then there is no motion and all things must be one. Leucippus agreed with their logic, but he said that the void did exist, and he was therefore able to accept the existence of motion and plurality. Like the Eleatics, Leucippus believed that everything exists in an eternal state and nothing can come into or out of existence, applying this to both atoms and the void. Aristotle described Leucippus as saying that atoms are not an addition to the void, but that atoms and the void are two opposites that exist beside one another. The 6th-century CE philosopher Simplicius of Cilicia also wrote about this idea, but he attributed it to Democritus. According to the Christian author Lactantius, Leucippus compared atoms to the particles of floating dust that are visible in sunlight.\nLeucippus's atomism kept the concepts of reality developed by the Eleatics, but it applied them to a physical explanation of the world. By moving away from the abstract points and units of geometry, he formed a possible solution to the paradoxes of motion created by Zeno of Elea, which held that indivisibility made motion impossible. Leucippus also contested the Eleatic argument against divisibility: that any divider between two objects can also be divided. He argued that the void is a divider that does not have being and therefore cannot be divided. Though Leucippus described atoms as being able to touch one another, Aristotle understood this to mean atoms being near one another, as Leucippus maintained that the void must exist between all atoms.\nSoul and perception.\nLeucippus and Democritus proposed that heat, fire, and the soul are made of spherical atoms, as this shape would let them move past one another and cause the others to move more efficiently. They believed in a physical soul that drives motion in living things, and they described respiration as the process of expelling soul atoms and absorbing new ones. Death then coincides with the last breath, as soul atoms are no longer being replenished. Sleep is a similar state in which a reduced number of soul atoms are in the body.\nLeucippus was the first philosopher to describe a theory of thought and perception. He described sensory input as a transfer between atoms, created when external atoms come into contact with the atoms of the soul. Leucippus said that sight is caused by a film of atoms emitted from an object, maintaining the shapes of its atoms and creating a reflection of the object in the viewer's eye. His description of vision was inspired by Empedocles, who formed a similar concept of objects emitting films of themselves. Leucippus posited that concepts such as color and texture are created by different arrangements of atoms, and that abstract concepts such as justice and wisdom are produced through the arrangement of soul atoms.\nAccording to Epiphanius, Leucippus said that reasoned knowledge is impossible to obtain and only unreasoned belief exists. The 20th-century writer Constantine Vamvacas said that Leucippus rejected this belief, and that it was the Eleatic philosopher Parmenides who held it. According to Vamvacas, Leucippus and Democritus \"believe that sense experience, however limited, constitutes objective knowledge of the physical world\". The 20th-century scholar C. C. W. Taylor said that \"we have no evidence to suggest that Leucippus was concerned with epistemological questions\".\nCosmology.\nLeucippus said that the void extends infinitely, expanding across the entire universe. He also said that there is an infinite number of atoms, spread across the void. The Earth and the cosmos\u2014including the Sun, the Moon, the stars, and anything else visible in the night sky\u2014exist together in the void.\nLeucippus said that the cosmos was created when a large group of atoms came together and swirled as a vortex. They shifted around each other until they were sorted \"like to like\". The larger atoms gathered in the center while the smaller ones were pushed to the edge. The smaller atoms became the celestial bodies of the cosmos. The larger atoms in the center came together as a membrane from which the Earth was formed. Ancient writers disagreed about what Leucippus meant when he described the membrane: Aetius said that the smaller atoms were part of the membrane, encasing the larger atoms, but Diogenes Laertius said that the larger atoms formed a membrane themselves and the smaller ones were excluded. Leucippus also believed that there were distant cosmoses in other parts of the void; this makes him the first known philosopher to propose the existence of other worlds besides Earth, though some ancient doxographers have attributed these ideas to the earlier Ionian philosophers.\nLike other pre-Socratic philosophers, Leucippus believed that the Earth was in the center of the cosmos. He said that the other celestial bodies orbited around the Earth, with the Moon being the closest to the Earth and the Sun being the farthest. He described the stars as orbiting the fastest. While initially \"moist and muddy\", the stars dried and then ignited.\nLeucippus adopted the idea of the Ionian philosophers that the Earth is flat. According to Aetius, Leucippus thought of the Earth as \"drum-shaped\", with a flat surface and some degree of depth. He said that the flat Earth is tilted on its horizontal axis so that the south is lower than the north, explaining that the northern region is colder than the southern region, and the cold compacted air of the north can better support the Earth's weight than the warm rarefied air of the south. Aetius also tells of Leucippus's explanation for thunder: that it is caused by fire being compressed in clouds and then bursting out.\nMany early philosophers were confused by the fact that earthly objects fell downward while celestial objects moved in a curved trajectory. This prompted many of them to believe in a non-earthly substance that composes the celestial bodies. With his model of the cosmos, Leucippus was able to justify why these entities move differently even though they are made of the same substance. Leucippus gave no explanation for how motion began, for which he was criticized by Aristotle. It is unclear whether Leucippus considered vorticies to arise by chance or as a deterministic outcome.\nLegacy.\nAncient Greece.\nModern understanding of Leucippus's role in the development of atomism comes from the writings of the ancient Greek philosophers Aristotle and Theophrastus. Aristotle's 4th-century BCE record of Leucippus and Democritus's philosophy is the oldest surviving source on the subject, though he did not distinguish who developed which atomist ideas. Aetius also wrote about Leucippus, but it was well after Leucippus's own time and derivative of previous writings on the subject. Some later histories of philosophy omitted Leucippus entirely. Since ancient times, Leucippus has languished in obscurity compared to Democritus, and since the earliest records of atomist thought, it has been common practice to consider the ideas of Leucippus and Democritus collectively rather than attempting to distinguish them.\nThe atomist philosophy of Leucippus and Democritus influenced Greek philosophy for centuries, particularly in the work of Aristotle and Epicurus. Aristotle was critical of atomism. He questioned why stone should fall but fire should rise if they are both made of the same material. According to Diogenes Laertius, Diogenes of Apollonia's interpretation of the void may have been inspired by Leucippus. Plato explored cosmological ideas similar to those of Leucippus in the dialogue \"Timaeus\".\nModern era.\nAncient atomism was revived in the 16th and 17th centuries, especially by proponents of the mechanical philosophy such as Pierre Gassendi (1592\u20131655) and Robert Boyle (1627\u20131691). Nevertheless, in practice experimental chemists such as Boyle rather relied on the tradition of corpuscularianism which had developed in medieval alchemy and ultimately goes back to works such as Aristotle's \"Meteorology IV\". Throughout the 18th century chemists worked independently from philosophical atomism, which only changed when John Dalton (1766\u20131844) proposed a form of atomism that was rooted in chemical experiment.\nAlthough Leucippus' ideas form an important historical precedent for the concept of atoms in general, they only bear a superficial resemblance to modern atomic theory. Leucippus's philosophy was conjecture based on \"a priori\" evidence, while modern atomic theory is supported by empirical evidence found through the scientific method. The main practical difference between Leucippus's atomism and modern atomic theory is the introduction of non-tangible phenomena such as mass\u2013energy equivalence and fundamental forces. Instead of the purely material atoms of Leucippus, modern atomic theory shows that fundamental forces combine subatomic particles into atoms and link atoms together into molecules. The 20th-century physicist Werner Heisenberg argued that Plato's theory of forms was closer to the 20th-century understanding of physics than Leucippus's conception of atoms, saying that modern atoms are more like the intangible Platonic forms than the discrete material units of Leucippus.\nScholarship on Leucippus.\nModern philosophy generally takes more interest in Leucippus's concept of atoms than his cosmology. Two major systems have been created to distinguish Leucippus and Democritus. The 20th-century philosopher Adolf Dyroff developed a set of distinctions between Leucippus and Democritus: he proposed that Leucippus was responsible for the atomist response to the Eleatics while Democritus responded to the Sophists and that Leucippus was a cosmologist while Democritus was a polymath. The 20th-century classicist Cyril Bailey proposed another system to differentiate the two philosophers, attributing atomism and belief in the void to Leucippus while attributing \"The Great Cosmology\" to Democritus as an application of Leucippus's philosophy. Unlike Democritus, Leucippus is only known to have studied cosmology and physics.\nHistoricity.\nAccording to Diogenes Laertius, Epicurus alleged that Leucippus never existed\u2014an allegation that triggered extensive philosophical debate. Most modern philosophers agree that Leucippus existed, but there is disagreement on whether his work can be meaningfully distinguished from that of Democritus. In 2008, the philosopher Daniel Graham wrote that no significant work on the historicity of Leucippus has been produced since the early 20th century, arguing that \"recent scholarship tends to avoid the question as much as possible\".\nScholars who maintain that Leucippus existed argue that he only taught orally or that any written works he produced were never meant for publication. The 20th-century classicist John Burnet proposed an alternate reading of Epicurus's claims, according to which Epicurus may have been saying that Leucippus was not worth discussing as a philosopher, not that he literally did not exist. Supporting this argument is that Epicurus considered ethics to be foundational to philosophy, and Leucippus had no teachings on that subject. Among scholars who argue against Leucippus's existence, alternate ideas have been proposed: Leucippus may have been a pseudonym of Democritus, or he may have been a character in a dialogue. Modern scholars who have rejected the existence of Leucippus include Erwin Rohde, Paul Natorp, Paul Tannery, P. Bokownew, Ernst Howald, Herman De Ley, Adolf Brieger, and Wilhelm Nestle.\nThe existence of Leucippus was an issue in 19th-century German philosophy, where it spawned a debate between Rohde, Natorp, and Hermann Alexander Diels. Rhode believed that even in the time of Epicurus there was no evidence of Leucippus's existence, and there was therefore no purpose in attributing the atomism of Democritus to an unknown figure such as Leucippus, rejecting Theophrastus's account. Natorp likewise rejected that Diogenes of Apollonia was preceded by Leucippus. Diels affirmed the account of Theophrastus and produced writings criticizing Rhode and Natorp. The problem was significant enough that it was given its own name in German: (transl.\u2009\"the Leucippus problem\").\nWorks.\nTwo works are attributed to Leucippus.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It was founded on 10 January 1920 by the Paris Peace Conference that ended the First World War. The main organisation ceased operations on 18 April 1946 when many of its components were relocated into the new United Nations (UN) which was created in the aftermath of the Second World War.\nThe League's primary goals were stated in its eponymous Covenant. They included preventing wars through collective security and disarmament and settling international disputes through negotiation and arbitration. Its other concerns included labour conditions, just treatment of native inhabitants, human and drug trafficking, the arms trade, global health, prisoners of war, and protection of minorities in Europe. The Covenant of the League of Nations was signed on 28 June 1919 as Part I of the Treaty of Versailles, and it became effective with the rest of the Treaty on 10 January 1920. Australia was granted the right to participate as an autonomous member nation, marking the start of Australian independence on the global stage. The first meeting of the Council of the League took place on 16 January 1920, and the first meeting of the Assembly of the League took place on 15 November 1920. In 1919, U.S. president Woodrow Wilson won the Nobel Peace Prize for his role as the leading architect of the League. Despite this, he was ultimately unsuccessful in getting his country to join it.\nThe diplomatic philosophy behind the League represented a fundamental shift from the preceding hundred years. The League lacked its own armed force and depended on the victorious Allied Powers of World War I (Britain, France, Italy and Japan were the initial permanent members of the Council) to enforce its resolutions, keep to its economic sanctions, or provide an army when needed. The Great Powers were often reluctant to do so. Sanctions could hurt League members, so they were reluctant to comply with them. During the Second Italo-Ethiopian War, when the League accused Italian soldiers of targeting International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement medical tents, Benito Mussolini responded that \"the League is very well when sparrows shout, but no good at all when eagles fall out.\"\nAt its greatest extent from 28 September 1934 to 23 February 1935, it had 58 members. After some notable successes and some early failures in the 1920s, the League ultimately proved incapable of preventing aggression by the Axis powers in the 1930s. Its credibility was weakened because the United States never joined. Japan and Germany left in 1933, Italy left in 1937, and Spain left in 1939. The Soviet Union only joined in 1934 and was expelled in 1939 after invading Finland. Furthermore, the League demonstrated an irresolute approach to sanction enforcement for fear it might only spark further conflict, further decreasing its credibility. One example of this hesitancy was the Abyssinia Crisis, in which Italy's sanctions were only limited from the outset (coal and oil were not restricted), and later altogether abandoned despite Italy being declared the aggressors in the conflict. The onset of the Second World War in 1939 showed that the League had failed its primary purpose: to prevent another world war. It was largely inactive until its abolition. The League lasted for 26 years; the United Nations effectively replaced it in 1945, inheriting several agencies and organisations founded by the League, with the League itself formally dissolving the following year.\nCurrent scholarly consensus views that, even though the League failed to achieve its main goal of world peace, it did manage to build new roads towards expanding the rule of law across the globe; strengthened the concept of collective security, gave a voice to smaller nations; fostered economic stabilisation and financial stability, especially in Central Europe in the 1920s; helped to raise awareness of problems such as epidemics, slavery, child labour, colonial tyranny, refugee crises and general working conditions through its numerous commissions and committees; and paved the way for new forms of statehood, as the mandate system put the colonial powers under international observation. Professor David Kennedy portrays the League as a unique moment when international affairs were \"institutionalised\", as opposed to the pre\u2013First World War methods of law and politics.\nOrigins.\nBackground.\nThe concept of a peaceful community of nations had been proposed as early as 1795, when Immanuel Kant's \"\" outlined the idea of a league of nations to control conflict and promote peace between states. Kant argued for the establishment of a peaceful world community, not in a sense of a global government, but in the hope that each state would declare itself a free state that respects its citizens and welcomes foreign visitors as fellow rational beings, thus promoting peaceful society worldwide. International co-operation to promote collective security originated in the Concert of Europe that developed after the Napoleonic Wars in the 19th century in an attempt to maintain the \"status quo\" between European states and so avoid war.\nBy 1910, international law developed, with the first Geneva Conventions establishing laws dealing with humanitarian relief during wartime, and the international Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1907 governing rules of war and the peaceful settlement of international disputes. Theodore Roosevelt at the acceptance for his Nobel Prize in 1910, said: \"it would be a masterstroke if those great powers honestly bent on peace would form a League of Peace.\"\nOne small forerunner of the League of Nations, the Inter-Parliamentary Union (IPU), was formed by the peace activists William Randal Cremer and Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Passy in 1889 (and still exists as an international body focused on the world's various elected legislative bodies). The IPU was founded with an international scope, with a third of the members of parliaments (in the 24 countries that had parliaments) serving as members of the IPU by 1914. Its foundational aims were to encourage governments to solve international disputes by peaceful means. Annual conferences were established to help governments refine the process of international arbitration. Its structure was designed as a council headed by a president, which would later be reflected in the structure of the League.\nPlans and proposals.\nAt the start of the First World War, the first schemes for an international organisation to prevent future wars began to gain considerable public support, particularly in the United Kingdom and the United States. Goldsworthy Lowes Dickinson, a British political scientist, coined the term \"League of Nations\" in 1914 and drafted a scheme for its organisation. Together with Lord Bryce, he played a leading role in the founding of the group of internationalist pacifists known as the Bryce Group, later the League of Nations Union. The group became steadily more influential among the public and as a pressure group within the then-governing Liberal Party. In Dickinson's 1915 pamphlet \"After the War\" he wrote of his \"League of Peace\" as being essentially an organisation for arbitration and conciliation. He felt that the secret diplomacy of the early twentieth century had brought about war, and thus, could write that, \"the impossibility of war, I believe, would be increased in proportion as the issues of foreign policy should be known to and controlled by public opinion.\" The 'Proposals' of the Bryce Group were circulated widely, both in England and the US, where they had a profound influence on the nascent international movement.\nIn January 1915, a peace conference directed by Jane Addams was held in the neutral United States. The delegates adopted a platform calling for creation of international bodies with administrative and legislative powers to develop a \"permanent league of neutral nations\" to work for peace and disarmament. Within months, a call was made for an international women's conference to be held in The Hague. Coordinated by Mia Boissevain, Aletta Jacobs and Rosa Manus, the congress, which opened on 28 April 1915 was attended by 1,136 participants from neutral nations, and resulted in the establishment of an organisation which would become the Women's International League for Peace and Freedom (WILPF). At the close of the conference, two delegations of women were dispatched to meet European heads of state over the next several months. They secured agreement from reluctant foreign ministers, who overall felt that such a body would be ineffective, but agreed to participate in or not impede creation of a neutral mediating body, if other nations agreed and if President Woodrow Wilson would initiate a body. In the midst of the War, Wilson refused.\nIn 1915, a body similar to the Bryce Group was set up in the United States, led by former president William Howard Taft. It was called the League to Enforce Peace. It advocated the use of arbitration in conflict resolution and the imposition of sanctions on aggressive countries. None of these early organisations envisioned a continuously functioning body; with the exception of the Fabian Society in England, they maintained a legalistic approach that would limit the international body to a court of justice. The Fabians were the first to argue for a \"council\" of states, necessarily the Great Powers, who would adjudicate world affairs, and for the creation of a permanent secretariat to enhance international co-operation across a range of activities.\nIn the course of the diplomatic efforts surrounding World War I, both sides had to clarify their long-term war aims. By 1916 in Britain, fighting on the side of the Allies, and in the neutral United States, long-range thinkers had begun to design a unified international organisation to prevent future wars. Historian Peter Yearwood argues that when the new coalition government of David Lloyd George took power in December 1916, there was widespread discussion among intellectuals and diplomats of the desirability of establishing such an organisation. When Lloyd George was challenged by Wilson to state his position with an eye on the postwar situation, he endorsed such an organisation. Wilson himself included in his Fourteen Points in January 1918 a \"league of nations to ensure peace and justice.\" British foreign secretary, Arthur Balfour, argued that, as a condition of durable peace, \"behind international law, and behind all treaty arrangements for preventing or limiting hostilities, some form of international sanction should be devised which would give pause to the hardiest aggressor.\"\nThe war had had a profound impact, affecting the social, political and economic systems of Europe and inflicting psychological and physical damage. Several empires collapsed: first the Russian Empire in February 1917, followed by the German Empire, Austro-Hungarian Empire and Ottoman Empire. Anti-war sentiment rose across the world; the First World War was described as \"the war to end all wars\", and its possible causes were vigorously investigated. The causes identified included arms races, alliances, militaristic nationalism, secret diplomacy, and the freedom of sovereign states to enter into war for their own benefit. One proposed remedy was the creation of an international organisation whose aim was to prevent future war through disarmament, open diplomacy, international co-operation, restrictions on the right to wage war, and penalties that made war unattractive.\nIn London Balfour commissioned the first official report into the matter in early 1918, under the initiative of Lord Robert Cecil. The British committee was finally appointed in February 1918. It was led by Walter Phillimore (and became known as the Phillimore Committee), but also included Eyre Crowe, William Tyrrell, and Cecil Hurst. The recommendations of the so-called Phillimore Commission included the establishment of a \"Conference of Allied States\" that would arbitrate disputes and impose sanctions on offending states. The proposals were approved by the British government, and much of the commission's results were later incorporated into the Covenant of the League of Nations.\nThe French authorities also drafted a much more far-reaching proposal in June 1918; they advocated annual meetings of a council to settle all disputes, as well as an \"\" to enforce its decisions.\nAmerican president Woodrow Wilson instructed Edward M. House to draft a US plan which reflected Wilson's own idealistic views (first articulated in the Fourteen Points of January 1918), as well as the work of the Phillimore Commission. The outcome of House's work and Wilson's own first draft proposed the termination of \"unethical\" state behaviour, including forms of espionage and dishonesty. Methods of compulsion against recalcitrant states would include severe measures, such as \"blockading and closing the frontiers of that power to commerce or intercourse with any part of the world and to use any force that may be necessary...\"\nThe two principal drafters and architects of the covenant of the League of Nations were the British politician Lord Robert Cecil and the South African statesman Jan Smuts. Smuts' proposals included the creation of a council of the great powers as permanent members and a non-permanent selection of the minor states. He also proposed the creation of a mandate system for captured colonies of the Central Powers during the war. Cecil focused on the administrative side and proposed annual council meetings and quadrennial meetings for the Assembly of all members. He also argued for a large and permanent secretariat to carry out the League's administrative duties.\nAccording to historian Patricia Clavin, Cecil and the British continued their leadership of the development of a rules-based global order into the 1920s and 1930s, with a primary focus on the League of Nations. The British goal was to systematise and normalise the economic and social relations between states, markets, and civil society. They gave priority to business and banking issues, but also considered the needs of ordinary women, children and the family as well. They moved beyond high-level intellectual discussions, and set up local organisations to support the League. The British were particularly active in setting up junior branches for secondary students.\nThe League of Nations was relatively more universal and inclusive in its membership and structure than previous international organisations, but the organisation enshrined racial hierarchy by curtailing the right to self-determination and prevented decolonisation.\nEstablishment.\nAt the Paris Peace Conference in 1919, Wilson, Cecil and Smuts all put forward their draft proposals. After lengthy negotiations between the delegates, the Hurst\u2013Miller draft was finally produced as a basis for the Covenant. After more negotiation and compromise, the delegates finally approved of the proposal to create the League of Nations (, ) on 25 January 1919. The final Covenant of the League of Nations was drafted by a special commission, and the League was established by Part I of the Treaty of Versailles, signed on 28 June 1919.\nFrench women's rights advocates invited international feminists to participate in a parallel conference to the Paris Conference in hopes that they could gain permission to participate in the official conference. The Inter-Allied Women's Conference asked to be allowed to submit suggestions to the peace negotiations and commissions and were granted the right to sit on commissions dealing specifically with women and children. Though they asked for enfranchisement and full legal protection under the law equal with men, those rights were ignored. Women won the right to serve in all capacities, including as staff or delegates in the League of Nations organisation. They also won a declaration that member nations should prevent trafficking of women and children and should equally support humane conditions for children, women and men labourers. At the Z\u00fcrich Peace Conference held between 17 and 19 May 1919, the women of the WILPF condemned the terms of the Treaty of Versailles for both its punitive measures, as well as its failure to provide for condemnation of violence and exclusion of women from civil and political participation. Upon reading the Rules of Procedure for the League of Nations, Catherine Marshall, a British suffragist, discovered that the guidelines were completely undemocratic and they were modified based on her suggestion.\nThe League would be made up of a Assembly (representing all member states), a Council (with membership limited to major powers), and a permanent Secretariat. Member states were expected to \"respect and preserve as against external aggression\" the territorial integrity of other members and to disarm \"to the lowest point consistent with domestic safety.\" All states were required to submit complaints for arbitration or judicial inquiry before going to war. The Council would create a Permanent Court of International Justice to make judgements on the disputes.\nDespite Wilson's efforts to establish and promote the League, for which he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in October 1919, the United States never joined. Senate Republicans led by Henry Cabot Lodge wanted a League with the reservation that only Congress could take the U.S. into war. Lodge gained a majority of Senators and Wilson refused to allow a compromise. The Senate voted on the ratification on 19 March 1920, and the 49\u201335 vote fell short of the needed 2/3 majority.\nThe League held its first council meeting in Paris on 16 January 1920, six days after the Versailles Treaty and the Covenant of the League of Nations came into force. On 1 November 1920, the headquarters of the League was moved from London to Geneva, where the first General Assembly was held on 15 November 1920. Geneva made sense as an ideal city for the League, since Switzerland had been a neutral country for centuries and was already the headquarters for the International Red Cross. Its strong democracy and location in central Europe made it a good choice for the nations of the world. Support for Geneva as the selection came from Swiss Federal Councillor Gustave Ador and economist William Rappard. The Palais Wilson on Geneva's western lakeshore, named after Woodrow Wilson, was the League's first permanent home.\nMission.\nThe covenant had ambiguities, as Carole Fink points out. There was not a good fit between Wilson's \"revolutionary conception of the League as a solid replacement for a corrupt alliance system, a guardian of international order, and protector of small states,\" versus Lloyd George's desire for a \"cheap, self-enforcing, peace, such as had been maintained by the old and more fluid Concert of Europe.\"\nFurthermore, the League, according to Carole Fink, was, \"deliberately excluded from such great-power prerogatives as freedom of the seas and naval disarmament, the Monroe Doctrine and the internal affairs of the French and British empires, and inter-Allied debts and German reparations, not to mention the Allied intervention and the settlement of borders with Soviet Russia.\"\nAlthough the United States never joined, unofficial observers became more and more involved, especially in the 1930s. American philanthropies became heavily involved, especially the Rockefeller Foundation. It made major grants designed to build up the technical expertise of the League staff. Ludovic Tourn\u00e8s argues that by the 1930s the foundations had changed the League from a \"Parliament of Nations\" to a modern think tank that used specialised expertise to provide an in-depth impartial analysis of international issues.\nLanguages and symbols.\nThe official languages of the League of Nations were French and English.\nDuring the 1939 New York World's Fair, a semi-official flag and emblem for the League of Nations emerged: two five-pointed stars within a blue pentagon. They symbolised the Earth's five continents and \"five races\". A bow at the top displayed the English name (\"League of Nations\"), while another at the bottom showed the French name (\"Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 des Nations\").\nMembership.\nThe League consisted of 42 founding members in November 1920. Six other states joined in its founding year (by December 1920), and seven more joined by September 1924, bringing the League's size to 55. Costa Rica withdrew in December 1924, making it the member to have most quickly withdrawn, and Brazil became the first founding member to withdraw in June 1926. Germany (under the Weimar Republic) was admitted to the League of Nations through a resolution passed on 8 September 1926. The League's size remained at 54 for the next five years.\nThrough the first half of the 1930s, six more states joined, including Iraq in 1932 (nominally independent from a League of Nations mandate) and the Soviet Union on 18 September 1934, but the Empire of Japan and Germany (under Hitler) withdrew in 1933. This marked the League's largest extent at 58 member states.\nIn December 1920, Argentina quit (being absent from all sessions and votes) without formally withdrawing, on rejection of an Argentine resolution that all sovereign states would be admitted to the League. It resumed its participation in September 1933.\nThe League's membership declined through the second half of the 1930s as it weakened. Between 1935 and the start of World War II in Europe in September 1939, only Egypt joined (becoming the last state to join), 11 members left, and 3 members ceased to exist or fell under military occupation (Ethiopia, Austria, and Czechoslovakia). The Soviet Union was expelled on 14 December 1939 for invading Finland, as one of the last acts of the League before it ceased functioning.\nOrganization.\n \nPermanent organs.\nThe main constitutional organs of the League were the Assembly, the council, and the Permanent Secretariat. It also had two essential wings: the Permanent Court of International Justice and the International Labour Organization. In addition, there were several auxiliary agencies and bodies. Each organ's budget was allocated by the Assembly (the League was supported financially by its member states).\nThe relations between the assembly and the council and the competencies of each were for the most part not explicitly defined. Each body could deal with any matter within the sphere of competence of the league or affecting peace in the world. Particular questions or tasks might be referred to either.\nUnanimity was required for the decisions of both the assembly and the council, except in matters of procedure and some other specific cases such as the admission of new members. This requirement was a reflection of the league's belief in the sovereignty of its component nations; the league sought a solution by consent, not by dictation. In case of a dispute, the consent of the parties to the dispute was not required for unanimity.\nThe Permanent Secretariat, established at the seat of the League at Geneva, comprised a body of experts in various spheres under the direction of the general secretary. Its principal sections were Political, Financial and Economics, Transit, Minorities and Administration (administering the Saar and Danzig), Mandates, Disarmament, Health, Social (Opium and Traffic in Women and Children), Intellectual Cooperation and International Bureaux, Legal, and Information. The staff of the Secretariat was responsible for preparing the agenda for the Council and the Assembly and publishing reports of the meetings and other routine matters, effectively acting as the League's civil service. In 1931 the staff numbered 707.\nThe Assembly consisted of representatives of all members of the League, with each state allowed up to three representatives and one vote. It met in Geneva and, after its initial sessions in 1920, it convened once a year in September. The special functions of the Assembly included the admission of new members, the periodical election of non-permanent members to the council, the election with the Council of the judges of the Permanent Court, and control of the budget. In practice, the Assembly was the general directing force of League activities.\nThe Council acted as a type of executive body directing the Assembly's business. It began with four permanent members \u2013 the United Kingdom, France, Italy, and Japan \u2013 and four non-permanent members that were elected by the Assembly for a three-year term. The first non-permanent members were Belgium, Brazil, Greece, and Spain.\nThe composition of the Council was changed several times. The number of non-permanent members was first increased to six on 22 September 1922 and to nine on 8 September 1926. Werner Dankwort of Germany pushed for his country to join the League; joining in 1926, Germany became the fifth permanent member of the Council. Later, after Germany and Japan both left the League, the number of non-permanent seats was increased from nine to eleven, and the Soviet Union was made a permanent member giving the council a total of fifteen members. The Council met, on average, five times a year and in extraordinary sessions when required. In total, 107 sessions were held between 1920 and 1939.\nOther bodies.\nThe League oversaw the Permanent Court of International Justice and several other agencies and commissions created to deal with pressing international problems. These included the Disarmament Commission, the International Labour Organization (ILO), the Mandates Commission, the International Commission on Intellectual Cooperation (precursor to UNESCO), the Permanent Central Opium Board, the Commission for Refugees, the Slavery Commission, and the Economic and Financial Organization. Three of these institutions were transferred to the United Nations after the Second World War: the International Labour Organization, the Permanent Court of International Justice (as the International Court of Justice), and the Health Organisation (restructured as the World Health Organization).\nThe Permanent Court of International Justice was provided for by the Covenant, but not established by it. The Council and the Assembly established its constitution. Its judges were elected by the Council and the Assembly, and its budget was provided by the latter. The Court was to hear and decide any international dispute which the parties concerned submitted to it. It might also give an advisory opinion on any dispute or question referred to it by the council or the Assembly. The Court was open to all the nations of the world under certain broad conditions.\nThe International Labour Organization was created in 1919 on the basis of Part XIII of the Treaty of Versailles. The ILO, although having the same members as the League and being subject to the budget control of the Assembly, was an autonomous organisation with its own Governing Body, its own General Conference and its own Secretariat. Its constitution differed from that of the League: representation had been accorded not only to governments but also to representatives of employers' and workers' organisations. Albert Thomas was its first director.\nThe ILO successfully restricted the addition of lead to paint, and convinced several countries to adopt an eight-hour work day and forty-eight-hour working week. It also campaigned to end child labour, increase the rights of women in the workplace, and make shipowners liable for accidents involving seamen. After the demise of the League, the ILO became an agency of the United Nations in 1946.\nThe League's Health Organisation had three bodies: the Health Bureau, containing permanent officials of the League; the General Advisory Council or Conference, an executive section consisting of medical experts; and the Health Committee. In practice, the Paris-based Office international d'hygi\u00e8ne publique (OIHP) founded in 1907 after the International Sanitary Conferences, was discharging most of the practical health-related questions, and its relations with the League's Health Committee were often conflictual. The Health Committee's purpose was to conduct inquiries, oversee the operation of the League's health work, and prepare work to be presented to the council. This body focused on ending leprosy, malaria, and yellow fever, the latter two by starting an international campaign to exterminate mosquitoes. The Health Organisation also worked successfully with the Soviet government to prevent typhus epidemics, including organising a large education campaign.\nLinked with health, but also commercial concerns, was the topic of narcotics control. Introduced by the Second International Opium Convention, the Permanent Central Opium Board had to supervise the statistical reports on trade in opium, morphine, cocaine and heroin. The board also established a system of import certificates and export authorisations for the legal international trade in narcotics.\nThe League of Nations had devoted serious attention to the question of international intellectual cooperation since its creation. The First Assembly in December 1920 recommended that the Council take action aiming at the international organisation of intellectual work, which it did by adopting a report presented by the Fifth Committee of the Second Assembly and inviting a committee on intellectual co-operation to meet in Geneva in August 1922. The French philosopher Henri Bergson became the first chairman of the committee. The work of the committee included: an inquiry into the conditions of intellectual life, assistance to countries where intellectual life was endangered, creation of national committees for intellectual cooperation, cooperation with international intellectual organisations, protection of intellectual property, inter-university co-operation, co-ordination of bibliographical work and international interchange of publications, and international co-operation in archaeological research.\nThe Slavery Commission sought to eradicate slavery and slave trading across the world, and fought forced prostitution. Its main success was through pressing the governments who administered mandated countries to end slavery in those countries. The League secured a commitment from Ethiopia to end slavery as a condition of membership in 1923, and worked with Liberia to abolish forced labour and intertribal slavery. The United Kingdom had not supported Ethiopian membership of the League on the grounds that \"Ethiopia had not reached a state of civilisation and internal security sufficient to warrant her admission.\"\nThe League also succeeded in reducing the death rate of workers constructing the Tanganyika railway from 55 to 4 per cent. Records were kept to control slavery, prostitution, and the trafficking of women and children. Partly as a result of pressure brought by the League of Nations, Afghanistan abolished slavery in 1923, Iraq in 1924, Nepal in 1926, Transjordan and Persia in 1929, Bahrain in 1937, and Ethiopia in 1942.\nLed by Fridtjof Nansen, the Commission for Refugees was established on 27 June 1921 to look after the interests of refugees, including overseeing their repatriation and, when necessary, resettlement. At the end of the First World War, there were two to three million ex-prisoners of war from various nations dispersed throughout Russia; within two years of the commission's foundation, it had helped 425,000 of them return home. It established camps in Turkey in 1922 to aid the country with an ongoing refugee crisis, helping to prevent the spread of cholera, smallpox and dysentery as well as feeding the refugees in the camps. It also established the Nansen passport as a means of identification for stateless people.\nThe Committee for the Study of the Legal Status of Women sought to inquire into the status of women all over the world. It was formed in 1937, and later became part of the United Nations as the Commission on the Status of Women.\nThe Covenant of the League said little about economics. Nonetheless, in 1920 the Council of the League called for a financial conference. The First Assembly at Geneva provided for the appointment of an Economic and Financial Advisory Committee to provide information to the conference. In 1923, a permanent Economic and Financial Organisation came into being. The existing bilateral treaty regime was integrated into the League where the most-favoured-nation norm was codified and the League took on responsibilities related to international oversight and standardisation.\nMandates.\nAt the end of the First World War, the Allied Powers were confronted with the question of the disposal of the former German colonies in Africa and the Pacific, and the several Arabic-speaking provinces of the Ottoman Empire. Many British and French leaders wanted to annex colonies of the defeated Central Powers, but U.S. president Woodrow Wilson strongly insisted that instead of annexation, these territories should be assisted under League of Nations supervision in achieving self-governance and eventual independence depending on the inhabitants' choices. This proposal conflicted with Britain's interests at the time, as it sought to maintain dominance in the Middle East, protect its oil and trade routes, and limit French influence in the region.\nThe Paris Peace Conference compromised with Wilson by adopting the principle that these territories should be administered by different governments on behalf of the League \u2013 a system of national responsibility subject to international supervision. This plan, defined as the mandate system, was adopted by the \"Council of Ten\" (the heads of government and foreign ministers of the main Allied Powers: Britain, France, the United States, Italy, and Japan) on 30 January 1919 and transmitted to the League of Nations.\nLeague of Nations mandates were established under Article 22 of the Covenant of the League of Nations. The Permanent Mandates Commission supervised League of Nations mandates, and also organised plebiscites in disputed territories so that residents could decide which country they would join. There were three mandate classifications: A, B and C.\nThe A mandates (applied to parts of the old Ottoman Empire) were \"certain communities\" that had &lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Article 22\u2014\u200a\nThe B mandates were applied to the former German colonies that the League took responsibility for after the First World War. These were described as \"peoples\" that the League said were &lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Article 22\u2014\u200a\nSouth West Africa and certain South Pacific Islands were administered by League members under C mandates. These were classified as \"territories\" &lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Article 22\u2014\u200a\nMandatory powers.\nThe territories were governed by mandatory powers, such as the United Kingdom in the case of the Mandate of Palestine, and the Union of South Africa in the case of South-West Africa, until the territories were deemed capable of self-government. Fourteen mandate territories were divided up among seven mandatory powers: the United Kingdom, the Union of South Africa, France, Belgium, New Zealand, Australia and Japan. With the exception of the Kingdom of Iraq, which joined the League on 3 October 1932, most of these territories did not begin to gain their independence until after the Second World War, in a process that did not end until 1990. Following the demise of the League, most of the remaining mandates became United Nations Trust Territories.\nIn addition to the mandates, the League itself governed the Territory of the Saar Basin for 15 years, before it was returned to Germany following a plebiscite, and the Free City of Danzig (now Gda\u0144sk, Poland) from 15 November 1920 to 1 September 1939.\nResolving territorial disputes.\nThe aftermath of the First World War left many issues to be settled, including the exact position of national boundaries and which country particular regions would join. Most of these questions were handled by the victorious Allied Powers in bodies such as the Allied Supreme Council. The Allied Powers tended to refer only particularly difficult matters to the League. This meant that, during the early interwar period, the League played little part in resolving the turmoil resulting from the war. The questions the League considered in its early years included those designated by the Paris Peace treaties.\nAs the League developed, its role expanded, and by the middle of the 1920s it had become the centre of international activity. This change can be seen in the relationship between the League and non-members. The United States and the Soviet Union, for example, increasingly worked with the League. During the second half of the 1920s, France, Britain and Germany were all using the League of Nations as the focus of their diplomatic activity, and each of their foreign secretaries attended League meetings at Geneva during this period. They also used the League's machinery to try to improve relations and settle their differences.\n\u00c5land Islands.\n\u00c5land is a collection of around 6,500 islands in the Baltic Sea, midway between Sweden and Finland. The islands are almost exclusively Swedish-speaking, but in 1809, the \u00c5land islands, along with Finland, became part of the Russian Empire. In December 1917, during the turmoil of the Russian Revolution, Finland declared its independence, but most of the \u00c5landers wished to rejoin Sweden. The Finnish government considered the islands to be a part of their new nation, as the Emperor of Russia had included \u00c5land in the Grand Duchy of Finland, formed in 1809. By 1920, the dispute had escalated to the point that there was danger of war. The British government referred the problem to the League of Nations Council, but Finland would not let the League intervene, as they considered it an internal matter. The League created a small panel to decide if it should investigate the matter and, with an affirmative response, a neutral commission was created. In June 1921, the League announced its decision: the islands were to remain a part of Finland, but with guaranteed protection of the islanders, including demilitarisation. With Sweden's reluctant agreement, this became the first European international agreement concluded directly through the League.\nUpper Silesia.\nThe Allied powers referred the problem of Upper Silesia to the League after they had been unable to resolve the territorial dispute between Poland and Germany. In 1919 Poland voiced a claim to Upper Silesia, which had been part of Prussia. The Treaty of Versailles had recommended a plebiscite in Upper Silesia to determine whether the territory should become part of Germany or Poland. Complaints about the attitude of the German authorities led to rioting and eventually to the first two Silesian Uprisings (1919 and 1920). A plebiscite took place on 20 March 1921, with 59.6 per cent (around 500,000) of the votes cast in favour of joining Germany, but Poland claimed the conditions surrounding it had been unfair. This result led to the Third Silesian Uprising in 1921.\nOn 12 August 1921, the League was asked to settle the matter; the Council created a commission with representatives from Belgium, Brazil, China and Spain to study the situation. The committee recommended that Upper Silesia be divided between Poland and Germany according to the preferences shown in the plebiscite and that the two sides should decide the details of the interaction between the two areas \u2013 for example, whether goods should pass freely over the border due to the economic and industrial interdependence of the two areas. In November 1921, a conference was held in Geneva to negotiate a convention between Germany and Poland. A final settlement was reached, after five meetings, in which most of the area was given to Germany, but with the Polish section containing the majority of the region's mineral resources and much of its industry. When this agreement became public in May 1922, bitter resentment was expressed in Germany, but the treaty was still ratified by both countries. The settlement produced peace in the area until the beginning of the Second World War.\nAlbania.\nThe frontiers of the Principality of Albania had not been set during the Paris Peace Conference in 1919, as they were left for the League to decide. They had not yet been determined by September 1921, creating an unstable situation. Greek troops conducted military operations in the south of Albania. Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes (Yugoslav) forces became engaged, after clashes with Albanian tribesmen, in the northern part of the country. The League sent a commission of representatives from various powers to the region. In November 1921, the League decided that the frontiers of Albania should be the same as they had been in 1913, with three minor changes that favoured Yugoslavia. Yugoslav forces withdrew a few weeks later, albeit under protest.\nThe borders of Albania again became the cause of international conflict when Italian General Enrico Tellini and four of his assistants were ambushed and killed on 27 August 1923 while marking out the newly decided border between Greece and Albania. Italian leader Benito Mussolini was incensed and demanded that a commission investigate the incident within five days. Whatever the results of the investigation, Mussolini insisted that the Greek government pay Italy Lire\u00a050 million in reparations. The Greeks said they would not pay unless it was proved that the crime was committed by Greeks.\nMussolini sent a warship to shell the Greek island of Corfu, and Italian forces occupied the island on 31 August 1923. This contravened the League of Nations Covenant, so Greece appealed to the League to deal with the situation. The Allied Powers agreed (at Mussolini's insistence) that the Conference of Ambassadors should be responsible for resolving the dispute because it was the conference that had appointed General Tellini. The League of Nations Council examined the dispute, but then passed on their findings to the Conference of Ambassadors to make the final decision. The conference accepted most of the League's recommendations, forcing Greece to pay fifty million lire to Italy, even though those who committed the crime were never discovered. Italian forces then withdrew from Corfu.\nMemel.\nThe port city of Memel (now Klaip\u0117da) and the surrounding area, with a predominantly German population, was under provisional Entente control according to Article 99 of the Treaty of Versailles. The French and Polish governments favoured turning Memel into an international city, while the government of Lithuania wanted to annex the area. By 1923, the fate of the area had still not been decided, prompting Lithuanian forces to invade in January 1923 and seize the port. After the Allied Powers failed to reach an agreement with Lithuania, they referred the matter to the League of Nations. In December 1923, the League of Nations Council appointed a Commission of Inquiry. The commission chose to cede Memel to Lithuania and give the area autonomous rights. The Klaip\u0117da Convention was approved by the Council on 14 March 1924, and then by the Allied Powers and Lithuania. In 1939, Nazi Germany retook the region following an ultimatum to Lithuania, demanding the return of the region under threat of war. The League of Nations failed to prevent the forcible annexation of the Memel region by Germany.\nHatay.\nWith League oversight, the Sanjak of Alexandretta in the French Mandate of Syria was given autonomy in 1937. Renamed Hatay, its parliament declared independence as the Republic of Hatay in September 1938, after elections the previous month. It was annexed by Turkey with French consent in mid-1939.\nMosul.\nThe League resolved a dispute between the Kingdom of Iraq and the Republic of Turkey over control of the former Ottoman province of Mosul in 1926. According to the British, who had been awarded a League of Nations mandate over Iraq in 1920 and therefore represented Iraq in its foreign affairs, Mosul belonged to Iraq; on the other hand, the new Turkish republic claimed the province as part of its historic heartland. A League of Nations Commission of Inquiry, with members from Belgium, Hungary and Sweden, was sent to the region in 1924; it found that the people of Mosul did not want to be part of either Turkey or Iraq, but if they had to choose, they would pick Iraq. In 1925, the commission recommended that the region stay part of Iraq, under the condition that the British hold the mandate over Iraq for another 25 years, to ensure the autonomous rights of the Kurdish population. The League Council adopted the recommendation and decided on 16 December 1925 to award Mosul to Iraq. Although Turkey had accepted League of Nations arbitration in the Treaty of Lausanne (1923), it rejected the decision, questioning the Council's authority. The matter was referred to the Permanent Court of International Justice, which ruled that, when the Council made a unanimous decision, it must be accepted. Nonetheless, Britain, Iraq and Turkey ratified a separate treaty on 5 June 1926 that mostly followed the decision of the Council and also assigned Mosul to Iraq. It was agreed that Iraq could still apply for League membership within 25 years and that the mandate would end upon its admission.\nVilnius.\nAfter World War I, both Poland and Lithuania gained independence, however the two countries soon became immersed in territorial disputes. During the Polish\u2013Soviet War, Lithuania signed the Moscow Peace Treaty with Soviet Russia that laid out Lithuania's frontiers. This agreement gave Lithuania control of the city of Vilnius (, ), the old Lithuanian capital, but a city with a majority Polish population. This heightened tension between Lithuania and Poland and led to fears that they would resume the Polish\u2013Lithuanian War, and on 7 October 1920, the League negotiated the Suwa\u0142ki Agreement establishing a cease-fire and a demarcation line between the two nations. On 9 October 1920, General Lucjan \u017beligowski, commanding a Polish military force in contravention of the Suwa\u0142ki Agreement, took the city and established the Republic of Central Lithuania.\nAfter a request for assistance from Lithuania, the League of Nations Council called for Poland's withdrawal from the area. The Polish government indicated they would comply, but instead reinforced the city with more Polish troops. This prompted the League to decide that the future of Vilnius should be determined by its residents in a plebiscite and that the Polish forces should withdraw and be replaced by an international force organised by the League. The plan was met with resistance in Poland, Lithuania, and the Soviet Russia, which opposed any international force in Lithuania. In March 1921, the League abandoned plans for the plebiscite. After unsuccessful proposals by Paul Hymans to create a federation between Poland and Lithuania, which was intended as a reincarnation of the former Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth which the two nations had shared before losing their independence, Vilnius and the surrounding area was formally annexed by Poland in March 1922. After Lithuania took over the Klaip\u0117da Region, the Allied Conference set the frontier between Lithuania and Poland, leaving Vilnius within Poland, on 14 March 1923. Lithuanian authorities refused to accept the decision, and officially remained in a state of war with Poland until 1927. It was not until the 1938 Polish ultimatum that Lithuania restored diplomatic relations with Poland and thus \"de facto\" accepted the borders.\nColombia and Peru.\nThere were several border conflicts between Colombia and Peru in the early part of the 20th century, and in 1922, their governments signed the Salom\u00f3n-Lozano Treaty in an attempt to resolve them. As part of this treaty, the border town of Leticia and its surrounding area was ceded from Peru to Colombia, giving Colombia access to the Amazon River. On 1 September 1932, business leaders from Peruvian rubber and sugar industries who had lost land, as a result, organised an armed takeover of Leticia. At first, the Peruvian government did not recognise the military takeover, but President of Peru Luis S\u00e1nchez Cerro decided to resist a Colombian re-occupation. The Peruvian Army occupied Leticia, leading to an armed conflict between the two nations. After months of diplomatic negotiations, the governments accepted mediation by the League of Nations, and their representatives presented their cases before the Council. A provisional peace agreement, signed by both parties in May 1933, provided for the League to assume control of the disputed territory while bilateral negotiations proceeded. In May 1934, a final peace agreement was signed, resulting in the return of Leticia to Colombia, a formal apology from Peru for the 1932 invasion, demilitarisation of the area around Leticia, free navigation on the Amazon and Putumayo Rivers, and a pledge of non-aggression.\nSaar.\nSaar was a province formed from parts of Prussia and the Rhenish Palatinate and placed under League control by the Treaty of Versailles. A plebiscite was to be held after fifteen years of League rule to determine whether the province should belong to Germany or France. When the referendum was held in 1935, 90.3 per cent of voters supported becoming part of Germany, which was quickly approved by the League of Nations Council.\nOther conflicts.\nIn addition to territorial disputes, the League also tried to intervene in other conflicts between and within nations. Among its successes were its fight against the international trade in opium and sexual slavery, and its work to alleviate the plight of refugees, particularly in Turkey in the period up to 1926. One of its innovations in this latter area was the 1922 introduction of the Nansen passport, which was the first internationally recognised identity card for stateless refugees.\nGreece and Bulgaria.\nAfter an incident involving sentries on the Greek-Bulgarian border in October 1925, fighting began between the two countries. Three days after the initial incident, Greek troops invaded Bulgaria. The Bulgarian government ordered its troops to make only token resistance, and evacuated between ten thousand and fifteen thousand people from the border region, trusting the League to settle the dispute. The League condemned the Greek invasion, and called for both Greek withdrawal and compensation to Bulgaria.\nLiberia.\nFollowing accusations of forced labour on the large American-owned Firestone rubber plantation and American accusations of slave trading, the Liberian government asked the League to launch an investigation. The resulting commission was jointly appointed by the League, the United States, and Liberia. In 1930, a League report confirmed the presence of slavery and forced labour. The report implicated many government officials in the selling of contract labour and recommended that they be replaced by Europeans or Americans, which generated anger within Liberia and led to the resignation of President Charles D. B. King and his vice-president. The Liberian government outlawed forced labour and slavery and asked for American help in social reforms.\nMukden Incident.\nThe Mukden Incident, also known as the \"Manchurian Incident\", was a decisive setback that weakened the League because its major members refused to tackle Japanese aggression. Japan itself withdrew.\nUnder the agreed terms of the Twenty-One Demands with China, the Japanese government had the right to station its troops in the area around the South Manchurian Railway, a major trade route between China and Korea (then a Japanese colony), in the Chinese region of Manchuria. In September 1931, a section of the railway was lightly damaged by the Japanese Kwantung Army as a pretext for an invasion of Manchuria. The Japanese army claimed that Chinese soldiers had sabotaged the railway and in apparent retaliation (acting contrary to orders from Tokyo) occupied all of Manchuria. They renamed the area Manchukuo, and on 9 March 1932 set up a puppet government, with Puyi, the final emperor of China, as its nominal head of state.\nThe League of Nations sent observers. The Lytton Report appeared a year later (October 1932). It refused to recognise Manchukuo and demanded Manchuria be returned to China. The report passed 42\u20131 in the Assembly in 1933 (only Japan voting against), but instead of removing its troops from China, Japan withdrew from the League. In the end, as British historian Charles Mowat argued, collective security was dead:\nThe League and the ideas of collective security and the rule of law were defeated; partly because of indifference and of sympathy with the aggressor, but partly because the League powers were unprepared, preoccupied with other matters, and too slow to perceive the scale of Japanese ambitions.\nChaco War.\nThe League failed to prevent the 1932 war between Bolivia and Paraguay over the arid Gran Chaco region. Although the region was sparsely populated, it contained the Paraguay River, which would have given either landlocked country access to the Atlantic Ocean, and there was also speculation, later proved incorrect, that the Chaco would be a rich source of petroleum. Border skirmishes throughout the late 1920s culminated in an all-out war in 1932 when the Bolivian army attacked the Paraguayans at Fort Carlos Antonio L\u00f3pez at Lake Pitiantuta. The war was a disaster for both sides, causing 57,000 casualties for Bolivia, whose population was around three million, and 36,000 dead for Paraguay, whose population was approximately one million. It also brought both countries to the brink of economic disaster. By the time a ceasefire was negotiated on 12 June 1935, Paraguay had seized control of most of the region, as was later recognised by the 1938 truce.\nInitially, both sides refused to allow the League to conduct an inquiry until November 1933, over a year after the start of the war. As a result, the League did not formally invoke Article 16 to apply sanctions. The Pan-American Conference offered to mediate and the League deferred to the conference, but the warring sides ignored the conference. Eventually (without going through Article 16), an arms embargo was enacted by several members of the League (plus non-League members the United States and Brazil), but several neighbouring states ignored the embargo rendering it ineffective. In November 1934, the League demanded that both sides withdraw and undergo arbitration. Bolivia accepted, but Paraguay by then had taken control of all of the disputed area. Paraguay rejected arbitration and quit the League.\nItalian invasion of Abyssinia.\nIn October 1935, Italian dictator Benito Mussolini sent 400,000 troops to invade Abyssinia (Ethiopia). Marshal Pietro Badoglio led the campaign from November 1935, ordering bombing, the use of chemical weapons such as mustard gas, and the poisoning of water supplies, against targets which included undefended villages and medical facilities. The modern Italian Army defeated the poorly armed Abyssinians and captured Addis Ababa in May 1936, forcing Emperor of Ethiopia Haile Selassie to flee to exile in England.\nThe League of Nations condemned Italy's aggression and imposed economic sanctions in November 1935, but the sanctions were largely ineffective since they did not ban the sale of oil or close the Suez Canal (controlled by Britain). As Stanley Baldwin, the British prime minister, later observed, this was ultimately because no one had the military forces on hand to withstand an Italian attack. In October 1935, U.S. president Franklin D. Roosevelt invoked the recently passed Neutrality Acts and placed an embargo on arms and munitions to both sides, but extended a further \"moral embargo\" to the belligerent Italians, including other trade items. On 5 October and later on 29 February 1936, the United States endeavoured, with limited success, to limit its exports of oil and other materials to normal peacetime levels. The League sanctions were lifted on 4 July 1936, but by that point, Italy had already gained control of the urban areas of Abyssinia.\nThe Hoare\u2013Laval Pact of December 1935 was an attempt by the British foreign secretary Samuel Hoare and the French prime minister Pierre Laval to end the conflict in Abyssinia by proposing to partition the country into an Italian sector and an Abyssinian sector. Mussolini was prepared to agree to the pact, but news of the deal leaked out. Both the British and French public vehemently protested against it, describing it as a sell-out of Abyssinia. Hoare and Laval were forced to resign, and the British and French governments dissociated themselves from the two men. In June 1936, although there was no precedent for a head of state addressing the Assembly of the League of Nations in person, Haile Selassie spoke to the Assembly, appealing for its help in protecting his country.\nThe Abyssinian crisis showed how the League could be influenced by the self-interest of its members; one of the reasons why the sanctions were not very harsh was that both Britain and France feared the prospect of driving Mussolini and Adolf Hitler into an alliance.\nSpanish Civil War.\nOn 17 July 1936, the Spanish Army launched a coup d'\u00e9tat, leading to a prolonged armed conflict between Spanish Republicans (the elected leftist national government) and the Nationalists (conservative, anti-communist rebels who included most officers of the Spanish Army). Julio \u00c1lvarez del Vayo, the Spanish Minister of Foreign Affairs, appealed to the League in September 1936 for arms to defend Spain's territorial integrity and political independence. The League members would not intervene in the Spanish Civil War nor prevent foreign intervention in the conflict. Adolf Hitler and Mussolini aided General Francisco Franco's Nationalists, while the Soviet Union helped the Spanish Republic. In February 1937, the League did ban foreign volunteers, but this was in practice a symbolic move. The result was a Nationalist victory in 1939 and confirmation to all observers that the League was ineffective in dealing with a major issue.\nSecond Sino-Japanese War.\nFollowing a long record of instigating localised conflicts throughout the 1930s, Japan began a full-scale invasion of China on 7 July 1937. On 12 September, the Chinese representative, Wellington Koo, appealed to the League for international intervention. Western countries were sympathetic to the Chinese in their struggle, particularly in their stubborn defence of Shanghai, a city with a substantial number of foreigners. The League was unable to provide any practical measures; on 4 October, it turned the case over to the Nine Power Treaty Conference.\nSoviet invasion of Finland.\nThe Nazi-Soviet Pact of 23 August 1939 contained a secret protocol outlining spheres of interest. Finland, Estonia, Latvia, and eastern Poland fell into the Soviet sphere. After invading Poland on 17 September 1939, on 30 November 1939, the Soviet Union invaded Finland. Then \"the League of Nations for the first time expelled a member who had violated the Covenant.\" The League action of 14 December 1939 stung, because the Soviet Union became \"the only League member ever to suffer such an indignity\".\nFailure of disarmament.\nArticle 8 of the Covenant gave the League the task of reducing \"armaments to the lowest point consistent with national safety and the enforcement by common action of international obligations\". Haakon Ikonomou argues that the Disarmament Section was a major failure. It was distrusted by the great powers, and given little autonomy by the Secretariat. Its mediocre staffers generated information that was unreliable and caused unrealistic expectations in the general public.\nSuccesses.\nThe League scored some successes, including the 1925 Conference for the Supervision of the International Trade in Arms and Ammunition and in Implements of War. It started to collect international arms data. Most important was the passage in 1925 of the Geneva protocol banning poison gas in war. It reflected strong worldwide public opinion, although the United States did not ratify it until 1975.\nFailures.\nThe League had numerous failures and shortfalls. In 1921, it set up the Temporary Mixed Commission on Armaments to explore possibilities for disarmament. It was made up not of government representatives but of famous individuals. They rarely agreed. Proposals ranged from abolishing chemical warfare and strategic bombing to the limitation of more conventional weapons, such as tanks.\n1923 Draft Treaty of Mutual Assistance.\nThe 1923 Draft Treaty of Mutual Assistance was an unsuccessful proposal made by the League of Nations to address the issue of disarmament and security in Europe after World War I. It was rejected by the British government in 1924 and was never adopted. The Draft Treaty was an early attempt by the League to create a system of collective security and disarmament, leading the League to pursue alternative approaches that also ultimately failed to gain traction.\nGeneva Protocol of 1924.\nA draft treaty was assembled in 1923 that made aggressive war illegal and bound the member states to defend victims of aggression by force. Since the onus of responsibility would, in practice, be on the great powers of the League, it was vetoed by the United Kingdom, who feared that this pledge would strain its own commitment to police its British Empire.\nThe \"Geneva Protocol for the Pacific Settlement of International Disputes\" was a proposal by British prime minister Ramsay MacDonald and his French counterpart \u00c9douard Herriot. It set up compulsory arbitration of disputes and created a method to determine the aggressor in international conflicts. All legal disputes between nations would be submitted to the World Court. It called for a disarmament conference in 1925. Any government that refused to comply in a dispute would be named an aggressor. Any victim of aggression was to receive immediate assistance from League members.\nBritish Conservatives condemned the proposal for fear that it would lead to conflict with the United States, which also opposed the proposal. The British Dominions strongly opposed it. The Conservatives came to power in Britain, and in March 1925, the proposal was shelved and never reintroduced.\nWorld Disarmament Conference.\nThe Allied powers were also under obligation by the Treaty of Versailles to attempt to disarm, and the armament restrictions imposed on the defeated countries had been described as the first step toward worldwide disarmament. The League Covenant assigned the League the task of creating a disarmament plan for each state, but the Council devolved this responsibility to a special commission set up in 1926 to prepare for the 1932\u20131934 World Disarmament Conference. Members of the League held different views towards the issue. The French were reluctant to reduce their armaments without a guarantee of military help if they were attacked; Poland and Czechoslovakia felt vulnerable to attack from the west and wanted the League's response to aggression against its members to be strengthened before they disarmed. Without this guarantee, they would not reduce armaments because they felt the risk of attack from Germany was too great. Fear of attack increased as Germany regained its strength after the First World War, especially after Adolf Hitler gained power and became German Chancellor in 1933. In particular, Germany's attempts to overturn the Treaty of Versailles and the reconstruction of the German military made France increasingly unwilling to disarm.\nThe World Disarmament Conference was convened by the League of Nations in Geneva in 1932, with representatives from 60 states. It was a failure. A one-year moratorium on the expansion of armaments, later extended by a few months, was proposed at the start of the conference. The Disarmament Commission obtained initial agreement from France, Italy, Spain, Japan, and Britain to limit the size of their navies but no final agreement was reached. Ultimately, the Commission failed to halt the military build-up by Germany, Italy, Spain and Japan during the 1930s.\nHelpless during buildup to World War II.\nThe League was mostly silent in the face of major events leading to the Second World War, such as Hitler's remilitarisation of the Rhineland, occupation of the Sudetenland and \"Anschluss\" of Austria, which had been forbidden by the Treaty of Versailles. In fact, League members themselves re-armed. In 1933, Japan simply withdrew from the League rather than submit to its judgement, as did Germany the same year (using the failure of the World Disarmament Conference to agree to arms parity between France and Germany as a pretext), Italy in 1937, and Spain in 1939. The final significant act of the League was to expel the Soviet Union in December 1939 after it invaded Finland.\nEconomic policies.\nInternational taxation.\nThe intellectual foundation of the modern international taxation regime was set with a 1923 report prepared by prominent political economists and tax law experts for the League of Nations. The report formulated \"general principles\" to avoid the adverse effects of double taxation and encourage free trade, international capital flows, and economic growth. For example, the report tried to set guidelines for resolving who would be allowed to tax a resident or citizen of one state when that individual earned income in another state. Prior to the publication of the report, these kinds of questions were primarily decided through unilateral state decisions or bilateral tax treaties.\nGeneral weaknesses.\nThe onset of the Second World War demonstrated that the League had failed in its primary purpose, the prevention of another world war. There were a variety of reasons for this failure, many connected to general weaknesses within the organisation. Additionally, the power of the League was limited by the United States' refusal to join.\nOrigins and structure.\nThe origins of the League as an organisation created by the Allied powers as part of the peace settlement to end the First World War led to it being viewed as a \"League of Victors\". The League's neutrality tended to manifest itself as indecision. It required a unanimous vote of nine, later fifteen, Council members to enact a resolution; hence, conclusive and effective action was difficult, if not impossible. It was also slow in coming to its decisions, as certain ones required the unanimous consent of the entire Assembly. This problem mainly stemmed from the fact that the primary members of the League of Nations were not willing to accept the possibility of their fate being decided by other countries and (by enforcing unanimous voting) had effectively given themselves veto power.\nGlobal representation.\nRepresentation at the League was often a problem. Though it was intended to encompass all nations, many never joined, or their period of membership was short. The most conspicuous absentee was the United States. President Woodrow Wilson had been a driving force behind the League's formation and strongly influenced the form it took, but the US Senate voted not to join on 19 November 1919. Ruth Henig has suggested that, had the United States become a member, it would have also provided support to France and Britain, possibly making France feel more secure, and so encouraging France and Britain to co-operate more fully regarding Germany, thus making the rise to power of the Nazi Party less likely. Conversely, Henig acknowledges that if the US had been a member, its reluctance to engage in war with European states or to enact economic sanctions might have hampered the ability of the League to deal with international incidents. The structure of the US federal government might also have made its membership problematic, as its representatives at the League would only be able to answer on behalf of the executive branch, certain League decisions such as to go to war, would always require prior approval of the legislative branch regardless of the outcome of any floor vote even.\nIn January 1920, when the League was born, Germany was not permitted to join because it was seen as having been the aggressor in the First World War. Soviet Russia was also initially excluded because Communist regimes were not welcomed and membership would have been initially dubious due to the ongoing Russian Civil War in which both sides claimed to be the legitimate government of the country. The League was further weakened when major powers left in the 1930s. Japan began as a permanent member of the Council since the country was an Allied Power in the First World War but withdrew in 1933 after the League voiced opposition to its occupation of Manchuria. Italy also began as a permanent member of the council. However the League staunchly opposed Italy's invasion of Ethiopia in 1934. When the war ended in an Italian conquest, the League refused to recognise Italian sovereignty over Ethiopia, prompting the fascist government to withdraw from the organisation altogether in 1937. Though neutral during World War I, Spain (then still a kingdom) also began as a permanent member of the council, but withdrew in 1939 after the Spanish Civil War ended in a victory for the Nationalists. Though world opinion was much more divided over the Spanish Civil War than the conflicts involving Japan and Italy, the general perception leaned in favour of the Republican cause. The League had accepted Germany, also as a permanent member of the council, in 1926, deeming it to have become a \"peace-loving country\" under the Weimar Republic. After the Nazis came to power in 1933, Adolf Hitler withdrew Germany almost immediately.\nCollective security.\nAnother important weakness grew from the contradiction between the idea of collective security that formed the basis of the League and international relations between individual states. The League's collective security system required nations to act, if necessary, against states they considered friendly, and in a way that might endanger their national interests, to support states for which they had no normal affinity. This weakness was exposed during the Abyssinia Crisis, when Britain and France had to balance maintaining the security they had attempted to create for themselves in Europe \"to defend against the enemies of internal order\", in which Italy's support played a pivotal role, with their obligations to Abyssinia as a member of the League.\nOn 23 June 1936, in the wake of the collapse of League efforts to restrain Italy's war against Abyssinia, the British prime minister, Stanley Baldwin, told the House of Commons that collective security had &lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nUltimately, Britain and France both abandoned the concept of collective security in favour of appeasement in the face of growing German militarism under Hitler.\nIn this context, the League of Nations was also the institution where the first international debate on terrorism took place following the 1934 assassination of King Alexander I of Yugoslavia in Marseille, France. This debate established precedents regarding global surveillance (in the form of routine international sharing of surveillance data), the punishment of terrorists as an international (rather than national) matter, and the right of a nation to conduct military attacks within another nation as a response to international terrorism. Many of these concepts are detectable in the discourse of terrorism among states after 9/11.\nAmerican diplomatic historian Samuel Flagg Bemis originally supported the League, but after two decades changed his mind:\nThe League of Nations has been a disappointing failure... It has been a failure, not because the United States did not join it; but because the great powers have been unwilling to apply sanctions except where it suited their individual national interests to do so, and because Democracy, on which the original concepts of the League rested for support, has collapsed over half the world.\nPacifism, disarmament and radio.\nThe League of Nations lacked an armed force of its own and depended on the Great Powers to enforce its resolutions, which they were very unwilling to do. Its two most important members, Britain and France, were reluctant to use sanctions and even more reluctant to resort to military action on behalf of the League. Immediately after the First World War, pacifism became a strong force among both the people and governments of the two countries. The British Conservatives were especially tepid to the League and preferred, when in government, to negotiate treaties without the involvement of that organisation. Moreover, the League's advocacy of disarmament for Britain, France, and its other members, while at the same time advocating collective security, meant that the League was depriving itself of the only forceful means by which it could uphold its authority.\nDavid Goodman argues that the 1936 League of Nations Convention on the Use of Broadcasting in the Cause of Peace tried to create the standards for a liberal international public sphere. The Convention encouraged friendly radio broadcasts to other nations. It called for League prohibitions on international broadcasts containing hostile speech and false claims. It tried to draw the line between liberal and illiberal policies in communications, and emphasised the dangers of nationalist chauvinism. With Nazi Germany and Soviet Russia active on the radio, its liberal goals were ignored, while liberals warned that the code represented restraints on free speech.\nDemise and legacy.\nAs the situation in Europe escalated into war, the Assembly transferred enough power to the Secretary General on 30 September 1938 and 14 December 1939 to allow the League to continue to exist legally and carry on reduced operations. The headquarters of the League, the Palace of Nations, remained unoccupied for nearly six years until the Second World War ended.\nAt the 1943 Tehran Conference, the Allied powers agreed to create a new body to replace the League: the United Nations. Many League bodies, such as the International Labour Organization, continued to function and eventually became affiliated with the UN. The designers of the structures of the United Nations intended to make it more effective than the League.\nThe final session of the League of Nations concluded on 18 April 1946 in Geneva. Delegates from 34 nations attended the assembly. This session concerned itself with liquidating the League: it transferred assets worth approximately $22,000,000 (U.S.) in 1946 (including the Palace of Nations and the League's archives) to the UN, returned reserve funds to the nations that had supplied them, and settled the debts of the League. Robert Cecil, addressing the final session, said:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Let us boldly state that aggression wherever it occurs and however it may be defended, is an international crime, that it is the duty of every peace-loving state to resent it and employ whatever force is necessary to crush it, that the machinery of the Charter, no less than the machinery of the Covenant, is sufficient for this purpose if properly used, and that every well-disposed citizen of every state should be ready to undergo any sacrifice in order to maintain peace ... I venture to impress upon my hearers that the great work of peace is resting not only on the narrow interests of our own nations, but even more on those great principles of right and wrong which nations, like individuals, depend.\nThe League is dead. Long live the United Nations.\nThe Assembly passed a resolution that \"With effect from the day following the close of the present session of the Assembly [i.e., April 19], the League of Nations shall cease to exist except for the sole purpose of the liquidation of its affairs as provided in the present resolution.\" A Board of Liquidation consisting of nine persons from different countries spent the next 15 months overseeing the transfer of the League's assets and functions to the United Nations or specialised bodies, finally dissolving itself on 31 July 1947. The archive of the League of Nations was transferred to the United Nations Office at Geneva and is now an entry in the UNESCO Memory of the World Register.\nIn the Assembly's last session in 1946, Philip Noel-Baker (representing the United Kingdom) remarked that failure to act as soon as a great power had invaded another state had ultimately doomed the League: \"We know the World War began in Manchuria 15 years ago...Manchuria, Abyssinia, Munich have killed another great illusion, the belief that appeasement, seeking the national interest at the expense of others, individual action, secret bargains, could bring us peace.\"\nIn the past few decades, by research using the League Archives at Geneva, historians have reviewed the legacy of the League of Nations as the United Nations has faced similar troubles to those of the interwar period. Current consensus views that, even though the League failed to achieve its ultimate goal of world peace, it did manage to build new roads towards expanding the rule of law across the globe; strengthened the concept of collective security, giving a voice to smaller nations; helped to raise awareness to problems like epidemics, slavery, child labour, colonial tyranny, refugee crises and general working conditions through its numerous commissions and committees; and paved the way for new forms of statehood, as the mandate system put the colonial powers under international observation. Erez Manela situated the League as a catalyst for transforming the postwar global order into one critical of the arrangements of empire. Alternatively, Laura Robson &amp; Joe Maiolo posit the argument that the Mandate System under the League was a re-vitalised form of imperialism that placed former colonies under the ownership of greater powers.\nProfessor David Kennedy portrays the League as a unique moment when international affairs were \"institutionalised\", as opposed to the pre\u2013First World War methods of law and politics.\nThe principal Allies in the Second World War (the UK, the USSR, France, the U.S., and the Republic of China) became permanent members of the United Nations Security Council in 1946; in 1971, the People's Republic of China replaced the Republic of China (then only in control of Taiwan) as a permanent member of the UN Security Council, and in 1991, the Russian Federation assumed the seat of the dissolved USSR. Decisions of the Security Council are binding on all members of the UN, and unanimous decisions are not required, unlike in the League Council. Only the five permanent members of the Security Council can wield a veto to protect their vital interests.\nLeague of Nations archives.\nThe League of Nations archives is a collection of the League's records and documents. It consists of approximately 15 million pages of content dating from the inception of the League of Nations in 1919 extending through its dissolution in 1946. It is located at the United Nations Office at Geneva. In 2017, the UN Library &amp; Archives Geneva launched the Total Digital Access to the League of Nations Archives Project (LONTAD), with the intention of preserving, digitising, and providing online access to the League of Nations archives. It was completed in 2022.\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nGeneral and cited references.\nSurveys.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nLeague topics.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nRelated topics.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nHistoriography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

A logic program is a set of sentences in logical form, representing knowledge about some problem domain. Computation is performed by applying logical reasoning to that knowledge, to solve problems in the domain. Major logic programming language families include Prolog, Answer Set Programming (ASP) and Datalog. In all of these languages, rules are written in the form of \"clauses\":\ncodice_1\nand are read as declarative sentences in logical form:\ncodice_2\ncodice_3 is called the \"head\" of the rule, codice_4, ..., codice_5 is called the \"body\", and the codice_6 are called \"literals\" or conditions. When n = 0, the rule is called a \"fact\" and is written in the simplified form:\ncodice_7\nQueries (or goals) have the same syntax as the bodies of rules and are commonly written in the form:\ncodice_8\nIn the simplest case of Horn clauses (or \"definite\" clauses), all of the A, B1, ..., Bn are atomic formulae of the form p(t1 ..., tm), where p is a predicate symbol naming a relation, like \"motherhood\", and the ti are terms naming objects (or individuals). Terms include both constant symbols, like \"charles\", and variables, such as X, which start with an upper case letter.\nConsider, for example, the following Horn clause program:\nmother_child(elizabeth, charles).\nfather_child(charles, william).\nfather_child(charles, harry).\nparent_child(X, Y) :- \n mother_child(X, Y).\nparent_child(X, Y) :- \n father_child(X, Y).\ngrandparent_child(X, Y) :- \n parent_child(X, Z), \n parent_child(Z, Y).\nGiven a query, the program produces answers.\nFor instance for a query codice_9, the single answer is\nX = charles\nVarious queries can be asked. For instance\nthe program can be queried both to generate grandparents and to generate grandchildren. It can even be used to generate all pairs of grandchildren and grandparents, or simply to check if a given pair is such a pair:\ngrandparent_child(X, william).\nX = elizabeth\n?- grandparent_child(elizabeth, Y).\nY = william;\nY = harry.\n?- grandparent_child(X, Y).\nX = elizabeth\nY = william;\nX = elizabeth\nY = harry.\n?- grandparent_child(william, harry).\nno\n?- grandparent_child(elizabeth, harry).\nyes\nAlthough Horn clause logic programs are Turing complete, for most practical applications, Horn clause programs need to be extended to \"normal\" logic programs with negative conditions. For example, the definition of sibling uses a negative condition, where the predicate = is defined by the clause codice_10:\nsibling(X, Y) :- \n parent_child(Z, X), \n parent_child(Z, Y), \n not(X = Y).\nLogic programming languages that include negative conditions have the knowledge representation capabilities of a non-monotonic logic.\nIn ASP and Datalog, logic programs have only a declarative reading, and their execution is performed by means of a proof procedure or model generator whose behaviour is not meant to be controlled by the programmer. However, in the Prolog family of languages, logic programs also have a procedural interpretation as goal-reduction procedures. From this point of view, clause A :- B1...,Bn is understood as:\nto solve codice_3, solve codice_4, and ... and solve codice_5.\nNegative conditions in the bodies of clauses also have a procedural interpretation, known as \"negation as failure\": A negative literal codice_14 is deemed to hold if and only if the positive literal codice_15 fails to hold.\nMuch of the research in the field of logic programming has been concerned with trying to develop a logical semantics for negation as failure and with developing other semantics and other implementations for negation. These developments have been important, in turn, for supporting the development of formal methods for logic-based program verification and program transformation.\nHistory.\nThe use of mathematical logic to represent and execute computer programs is also a feature of the lambda calculus, developed by Alonzo Church in the 1930s. However, the first proposal to use the clausal form of logic for representing computer programs was made by Cordell Green. This used an axiomatization of a subset of LISP, together with a representation of an input-output relation, to compute the relation by simulating the execution of the program in LISP. Foster and Elcock's Absys, on the other hand, employed a combination of equations and lambda calculus in an assertional programming language that places no constraints on the order in which operations are performed.\nLogic programming, with its current syntax of facts and rules, can be traced back to debates in the late 1960s and early 1970s about declarative versus procedural representations of knowledge in artificial intelligence. Advocates of declarative representations were notably working at Stanford, associated with John McCarthy, Bertram Raphael and Cordell Green, and in Edinburgh, with John Alan Robinson (an academic visitor from Syracuse University), Pat Hayes, and Robert Kowalski. Advocates of procedural representations were mainly centered at MIT, under the leadership of Marvin Minsky and Seymour Papert.\nAlthough it was based on the proof methods of logic, Planner, developed by Carl Hewitt at MIT, was the first language to emerge within this proceduralist paradigm. Planner featured pattern-directed invocation of procedural plans from goals (i.e. goal-reduction or backward chaining) and from assertions (i.e. forward chaining). The most influential implementation of Planner was the subset of Planner, called Micro-Planner, implemented by Gerry Sussman, Eugene Charniak and Terry Winograd. Winograd used Micro-Planner to implement the landmark, natural-language understanding program SHRDLU. For the sake of efficiency, Planner used a backtracking control structure so that only one possible computation path had to be stored at a time. Planner gave rise to the programming languages QA4, Popler, Conniver, QLISP, and the concurrent language Ether.\nHayes and Kowalski in Edinburgh tried to reconcile the logic-based declarative approach to knowledge representation with Planner's procedural approach. Hayes (1973) developed an equational language, Golux, in which different procedures could be obtained by altering the behavior of the theorem prover.\nIn the meanwhile, Alain Colmerauer in Marseille was working on natural-language understanding, using logic to represent semantics and using resolution for question-answering. During the summer of 1971, Colmerauer invited Kowalski to Marseille, and together they discovered that the clausal form of logic could be used to represent formal grammars and that resolution theorem provers could be used for parsing. They observed that some theorem provers, like hyper-resolution, behave as bottom-up parsers and others, like SL resolution (1971) behave as top-down parsers.\nIt was in the following summer of 1972, that Kowalski, again working with Colmerauer, developed the procedural interpretation of implications in clausal form. It also became clear that such clauses could be restricted to definite clauses or Horn clauses, and that SL-resolution could be restricted (and generalised) to SLD resolution. Kowalski's procedural interpretation and SLD were described in a 1973 memo, published in 1974.\nColmerauer, with Philippe Roussel, used the procedural interpretation as the basis of Prolog, which was implemented in the summer and autumn of 1972. The first Prolog program, also written in 1972 and implemented in Marseille, was a French question-answering system. The use of Prolog as a practical programming language was given great momentum by the development of a compiler by David H. D. Warren in Edinburgh in 1977. Experiments demonstrated that Edinburgh Prolog could compete with the processing speed of other symbolic programming languages such as Lisp. Edinburgh Prolog became the \"de facto\" standard and strongly influenced the definition of ISO standard Prolog.\nLogic programming gained international attention during the 1980s, when it was chosen by the Japanese Ministry of International Trade and Industry to develop the software for the Fifth Generation Computer Systems (FGCS) project. The FGCS project aimed to use logic programming to develop advanced Artificial Intelligence applications on massively parallel computers. Although the project initially explored the use of Prolog, it later adopted the use of concurrent logic programming, because it was closer to the FGCS computer architecture.\nHowever, the committed choice feature of concurrent logic programming interfered with the language's logical semantics and with its suitability for knowledge representation and problem solving applications. Moreover, the parallel computer systems developed in the project failed to compete with advances taking place in the development of more conventional, general-purpose computers. Together these two issues resulted in the FGCS project failing to meet its objectives. Interest in both logic programming and AI fell into world-wide decline.\nIn the meanwhile, more declarative logic programming approaches, including those based on the use of Prolog, continued to make progress independently of the FGCS project. In particular, although Prolog was developed to combine declarative and procedural representations of knowledge, the purely declarative interpretation of logic programs became the focus for applications in the field of deductive databases. Work in this field became prominent around 1977, when Herv\u00e9 Gallaire and Jack Minker organized a workshop on logic and databases in Toulouse. The field was eventually renamed as \"Datalog\".\nThis focus on the logical, declarative reading of logic programs was given further impetus by the development of constraint logic programming in the 1980s and Answer Set Programming in the 1990s. It is also receiving renewed emphasis in recent applications of Prolog\nThe Association for Logic Programming (ALP) was founded in 1986 to promote Logic Programming. Its official journal until 2000, was \"The Journal of Logic Programming\". Its founding editor-in-chief was J. Alan Robinson. In 2001, the journal was renamed \"The Journal of Logic and Algebraic Programming\", and the official journal of ALP became \"Theory and Practice of Logic Programming\", published by Cambridge University Press.\nConcepts.\nLogic programs enjoy a rich variety of semantics and problem solving methods, as well as a wide range of applications in programming, databases, knowledge representation and problem solving.\nAlgorithm = Logic + Control.\nThe procedural interpretation of logic programs, which uses backward reasoning to reduce goals to subgoals, is a special case of the use of a problem-solving strategy to control the use of a declarative, logical representation of knowledge to obtain the behaviour of an algorithm. More generally, different problem-solving strategies can be applied to the same logical representation to obtain different algorithms. Alternatively, different algorithms can be obtained with a given problem-solving strategy by using different logical representations.\nThe two main problem-solving strategies are backward reasoning (goal reduction) and forward reasoning, also known as top-down and bottom-up reasoning, respectively.\nIn the simple case of a propositional Horn clause program and a top-level atomic goal, backward reasoning determines an and-or tree, which constitutes the search space for solving the goal. The top-level goal is the root of the tree. Given any node in the tree and any clause whose head matches the node, there exists a set of child nodes corresponding to the sub-goals in the body of the clause. These child nodes are grouped together by an \"and\". The alternative sets of children corresponding to alternative ways of solving the node are grouped together by an \"or\".\nAny search strategy can be used to search this space. Prolog uses a sequential, last-in-first-out, backtracking strategy, in which only one alternative and one sub-goal are considered at a time. For example, subgoals can be solved in parallel, and clauses can also be tried in parallel. The first strategy is called &lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Visible anchor/styles.css\" /&gt;and-parallel and the second strategy is called &lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Visible anchor/styles.css\" /&gt;or-parallel. Other search strategies, such as intelligent backtracking, or best-first search to find an optimal solution, are also possible.\nIn the more general, non-propositional case, where sub-goals can share variables, other strategies can be used, such as choosing the subgoal that is most highly instantiated or that is sufficiently instantiated so that only one procedure applies. Such strategies are used, for example, in concurrent logic programming.\nIn most cases, backward reasoning from a query or goal is more efficient than forward reasoning. But sometimes with Datalog and Answer Set Programming, there may be no query that is separate from the set of clauses as a whole, and then generating all the facts that can be derived from the clauses is a sensible problem-solving strategy. Here is another example, where forward reasoning beats backward reasoning in a more conventional computation task, where the goal codice_16 is to find the nth fibonacci number:\nfibonacci(0, 0).\nfibonacci(1, 1).\nfibonacci(N, Result) :-\n N &gt; 1,\n N1 is N - 1,\n N2 is N - 2,\n fibonacci(N1, F1),\n fibonacci(N2, F2),\n Result is F1 + F2. \nHere the relation codice_17 stands for the function codice_18, and the predicate codice_19 is Prolog notation for the predicate that instantiates the variable codice_20 to the value of codice_21.\nGiven the goal of computing the fibonacci number of codice_22, backward reasoning reduces the goal to the two subgoals of computing the fibonacci numbers of n-1 and n-2. It reduces the subgoal of computing the fibonacci number of n-1 to the two subgoals of computing the fibonacci numbers of n-2 and n-3, redundantly computing the fibonacci number of n-2. This process of reducing one fibonacci subgoal to two fibonacci subgoals continues until it reaches the numbers 0 and 1. Its complexity is of the order 2n. In contrast, forward reasoning generates the sequence of fibonacci numbers, starting from 0 and 1 without any recomputation, and its complexity is linear with respect to n.\nProlog cannot perform forward reasoning directly. But it can achieve the effect of forward reasoning within the context of backward reasoning by means of tabling: Subgoals are maintained in a table, along with their solutions. If a subgoal is re-encountered, it is solved directly by using the solutions already in the table, instead of re-solving the subgoals redundantly.\nRelationship with functional programming.\nLogic programming can be viewed as a generalisation of functional programming, in which functions are a special case of relations.\nFor example, the function, mother(X) = Y, (every X has only one mother Y) can be represented by the relation mother(X, Y). In this respect, logic programs are similar to relational databases, which also represent functions as relations.\nCompared with relational syntax, functional syntax is more compact for nested functions. For example, in functional syntax the definition of maternal grandmother can be written in the nested form:\nmaternal_grandmother(X) = mother(mother(X)).\nThe same definition in relational notation needs to be written in the unnested, flattened form:\nmaternal_grandmother(X, Y) :- mother(X, Z), mother(Z, Y).\nHowever, nested syntax can be regarded as syntactic sugar for unnested syntax. Ciao Prolog, for example, transforms functional syntax into relational form and executes the resulting logic program using the standard Prolog execution strategy. Moreover, the same transformation can be used to execute nested relations that are not functional. For example:\n \ngrandparent(X) := parent(parent(X)).\nparent(X) := mother(X).\nparent(X) := father(X).\nmother(charles) := elizabeth.\nfather(charles) := phillip.\nmother(harry) := diana.\nfather(harry) := charles.\n?- grandparent(X,Y).\nX = harry,\nY = elizabeth.\nX = harry,\nY = phillip.\nRelationship with relational programming.\nThe term \"relational programming\" has been used to cover a variety of programming languages that treat functions as a special case of relations. Some of these languages, such as miniKanren\nand relational linear programming\nare logic programming languages in the sense of this article.\nHowever, the relational language RML is an imperative programming language\n whose core construct is a\nrelational expression, which is similar to an expression in first-order predicate logic.\nOther relational programming languages are based on the relational calculus or relational algebra.\nSemantics of Horn clause programs.\nViewed in purely logical terms, there are two approaches to the declarative semantics of Horn clause logic programs: One approach is the original \"logical consequence semantics\", which understands solving a goal as showing that the goal is a theorem that is true in all models of the program.\nIn this approach, computation is theorem-proving in first-order logic; and both backward reasoning, as in SLD resolution, and forward reasoning, as in hyper-resolution, are correct and complete theorem-proving methods. Sometimes such theorem-proving methods are also regarded as providing a separate proof-theoretic (or operational) semantics for logic programs. But from a logical point of view, they are proof methods, rather than semantics.\nThe other approach to the declarative semantics of Horn clause programs is the \"satisfiability semantics\", which understands solving a goal as showing that the goal is true (or satisfied) in some intended (or standard) model of the program. For Horn clause programs, there always exists such a standard model: It is the unique \"minimal model\" of the program.\nInformally speaking, a minimal model is a model that, when it is viewed as the set of all (variable-free) facts that are true in the model, contains no smaller set of facts that is also a model of the program.\nFor example, the following facts represent the minimal model of the family relationships example in the introduction of this article. All other variable-free facts are false in the model:\nmother_child(elizabeth, charles).\nfather_child(charles, william).\nfather_child(charles, harry).\nparent_child(elizabeth, charles).\nparent_child(charles, william).\nparent_child(charles, harry).\ngrandparent_child(elizabeth, william).\ngrandparent_child(elizabeth, harry).\nThe satisfiability semantics also has an alternative, more mathematical characterisation as the least fixed point of the function that uses the rules in the program to derive new facts from existing facts in one step of inference.\nRemarkably, the same problem-solving methods of forward and backward reasoning, which were originally developed for the logical consequence semantics, are equally applicable to the satisfiability semantics: Forward reasoning generates the minimal model of a Horn clause program, by deriving new facts from existing facts, until no new additional facts can be generated. Backward reasoning, which succeeds by reducing a goal to subgoals, until all subgoals are solved by facts, ensures that the goal is true in the minimal model, without generating the model explicitly.\nThe difference between the two declarative semantics can be seen with the definitions of addition and multiplication in successor arithmetic, which represents the natural numbers codice_23 as a sequence of terms of the form codice_24. In general, the term codice_25 represents the successor of codice_26 namely codice_27 Here are the standard definitions of addition and multiplication in functional notation:\nHere are the same definitions as a logic program, using codice_28 to represent codice_29 and codice_30 to represent codice_31:\nadd(X, 0, X).\nadd(X, s(Y), s(Z)) :- add(X, Y, Z).\nmultiply(X, 0, 0).\nmultiply(X, s(Y), W) :- multiply(X, Y, Z), add(X, Z, W).\nThe two declarative semantics both give the same answers for the same existentially quantified conjunctions of addition and multiplication goals. For example codice_32 has the solution codice_33; and codice_34 has two solutions codice_35 and codice_36:\n?- multiply(s(s(0)), s(s(0)), X).\nX = s(s(s(s(0)))).\n?- multiply(X, X, Y), add(X, X, Y).\nX = 0, Y = 0.\nX = s(s(0)), Y = s(s(s(s(0)))).\nHowever, with the logical-consequence semantics, there are non-standard models of the program, in which, for example, codice_37 i.e. codice_38 is true. But with the satisfiability semantics, there is only one model, namely the standard model of arithmetic, in which codice_38 is false.\nIn both semantics, the goal ?- add(s(s(0)), s(s(0)), s(s(s(s(s(0)))))) fails. In the satisfiability semantics, the failure of the goal means that the truth value of the goal is false. But in the logical consequence semantics, the failure means that the truth value of the goal is unknown.\nNegation as failure.\nNegation as failure (NAF), as a way of concluding that a negative condition codice_40 holds by showing that the positive condition codice_41 fails to hold, was already a feature of early Prolog systems. The resulting extension of SLD resolution is called SLDNF. A similar construct, called \"thnot\", also existed in Micro-Planner.\nThe logical semantics of NAF was unresolved until Keith Clark showed that, under certain natural conditions, NAF is an efficient, correct (and sometimes complete) way of reasoning with the logical consequence semantics using the \"completion\" of a logic program in first-order logic.\nCompletion amounts roughly to regarding the set of all the program clauses with the same predicate in the head, say:\ncodice_42\ncodice_43\ncodice_44\nas a definition of the predicate:\ncodice_45\nwhere codice_46 means \"if and only if\". The completion also includes axioms of equality, which correspond to unification. Clark showed that proofs generated by SLDNF are structurally similar to proofs generated by a natural deduction style of reasoning with the completion of the program.\nConsider, for example, the following program:\nshould_receive_sanction(X, punishment) :- \n is_a_thief(X),\n not should_receive_sanction(X, rehabilitation).\nshould_receive_sanction(X, rehabilitation) :-\n is_a_thief(X),\n is_a_minor(X),\n not is_violent(X).\nis_a_thief(tom).\nGiven the goal of determining whether tom should receive a sanction, the first rule succeeds in showing that tom should be punished:\n?- should_receive_sanction(tom, Sanction).\nSanction = punishment.\nThis is because tom is a thief, and it cannot be shown that tom should be rehabilitated. It cannot be shown that tom should be rehabilitated, because it cannot be shown that tom is a minor.\nIf, however, we receive new information that tom is indeed a minor, the previous conclusion that tom should be punished is replaced by the new conclusion that tom should be rehabilitated:\nis_a_minor(tom).\n?- should_receive_sanction(tom, Sanction).\nSanction = rehabilitation.\nThis property of withdrawing a conclusion when new information is added, is called non-monotonicity, and it makes logic programming a non-monotonic logic.\nBut, if we are now told that tom is violent, the conclusion that tom should be punished will be reinstated:\nis_violent(tom).\n?- should_receive_sanction(tom, Sanction).\nSanction = punishment.\nThe completion of this program is:\nshould_receive_sanction(X, Sanction) iff \n Sanction = punishment, is_a_thief(X), \n not should_receive_sanction(X, rehabilitation)\n or Sanction = rehabilitation, is_a_thief(X), is_a_minor(X),\n not is_violent(X).\nis_a_thief(X) iff X = tom.\nis_a_minor(X) iff X = tom.\nis_violent(X) iff X = tom.\nThe notion of completion is closely related to John McCarthy's circumscription semantics for default reasoning, and to Ray Reiter's closed world assumption.\nThe completion semantics for negation is a logical consequence semantics, for which SLDNF provides a proof-theoretic implementation. However, in the 1980s, the satisfiability semantics became more popular for logic programs with negation. In the satisfiability semantics, negation is interpreted according to the classical definition of truth in an intended or standard model of the logic program.\nIn the case of logic programs with negative conditions, there are two main variants of the satisfiability semantics: In the well-founded semantics, the intended model of a logic program is a unique, three-valued, minimal model, which always exists. The well-founded semantics generalises the notion of inductive definition in mathematical logic. XSB Prolog implements the well-founded semantics using SLG resolution.\nIn the alternative stable model semantics, there may be no intended models or several intended models, all of which are minimal and two-valued. The stable model semantics underpins answer set programming (ASP).\nBoth the well-founded and stable model semantics apply to arbitrary logic programs with negation. However, both semantics coincide for stratified logic programs. For example, the program for sanctioning thieves is (locally) stratified, and all three semantics for the program determine the same intended model:\nshould_receive_sanction(tom, punishment).\nis_a_thief(tom).\nis_a_minor(tom).\nis_violent(tom).\nAttempts to understand negation in logic programming have also contributed to the development of abstract argumentation frameworks. In an argumentation interpretation of negation, the initial argument that tom should be punished because he is a thief, is attacked by the argument that he should be rehabilitated because he is a minor. But the fact that tom is violent undermines the argument that tom should be rehabilitated and reinstates the argument that tom should be punished.\nMetalogic programming.\nMetaprogramming, in which programs are treated as data, was already a feature of early Prolog implementations. For example, the Edinburgh DEC10 implementation of Prolog included \"an interpreter and a compiler, both written in Prolog itself\". The simplest metaprogram is the so-called \"vanilla\" meta-interpreter:\n solve(true).\n solve((B,C)):- solve(B),solve(C).\n solve(A):- clause(A,B),solve(B).\nwhere true represents an empty conjunction, and (B,C) is a composite term representing the conjunction of B and C. The predicate clause(A,B) means that there is a clause of the form A :- B.\nMetaprogramming is an application of the more general use of a \"metalogic\" or \"metalanguage\" to describe and reason about another language, called the \"object language\".\nMetalogic programming allows object-level and metalevel representations to be combined, as in natural language. For example, in the following program, the atomic formula codice_47 occurs both as an object-level formula, and as an argument of the metapredicates codice_48 and codice_49\nprohibited(attends(Person, Meeting)) :- \n not(approved(attends(Person, Meeting))).\nshould_receive_sanction(Person, scolding) :- attends(Person, Meeting), \n lofty(Person), prohibited(attends(Person, Meeting)).\nshould_receive_sanction(Person, banishment) :- attends(Person, Meeting), \n lowly(Person), prohibited(attends(Person, Meeting)).\napproved(attends(alice, tea_party)).\nattends(mad_hatter, tea_party).\nattends(dormouse, tea_party).\nlofty(mad_hatter).\nlowly(dormouse).\n?- should_receive_sanction(X,Y).\nPerson = mad_hatter,\nSanction = scolding.\nPerson = dormouse,\nSanction = banishment.\nRelationship with the Computational-representational understanding of mind.\nIn his popular Introduction to Cognitive Science, Paul Thagard includes logic and rules as alternative approaches to modelling human thinking. He argues that rules, which have the form \"IF condition THEN action\", are \"very similar\" to logical conditionals, but they are simpler and have greater psychological plausibility (page 51). Among other differences between logic and rules, he argues that logic uses deduction, but rules use search (page 45) and can be used to reason either forward or backward (page 47). Sentences in logic \"have to be interpreted as \"universally true\"\", but rules can be \"defaults\", which admit exceptions (page 44).\nHe states that \"unlike logic, rule-based systems can also easily represent strategic information\nabout what to do\" (page 45). For example, \"IF you want to go home for the weekend, and you have bus fare, THEN\nyou can catch a bus\". He does not observe that the same strategy of reducing a goal to subgoals can be interpreted, in the manner of logic programming, as applying backward reasoning to a logical conditional:\ncan_go(you, home) :- have(you, bus_fare), catch(you, bus).\nAll of these characteristics of rule-based systems - search, forward and backward reasoning, default reasoning, and goal-reduction - are also defining characteristics of logic programming. This suggests that Thagard's conclusion (page 56) that:\nMuch of human knowledge is naturally described in terms of rules, and many kinds of thinking such as planning can be modeled by rule-based systems.\nalso applies to logic programming.\nOther arguments showing how logic programming can be used to model aspects of human thinking are presented by Keith Stenning and Michiel van Lambalgen in their book,\nHuman Reasoning and Cognitive Science. They show how the non-monotonic character of logic programs can be used to explain human performance on a variety of psychological tasks. They also show (page 237) that \"closed\u2013world reasoning in its guise as logic programming has an appealing neural implementation, unlike classical logic.\"\nIn The Proper Treatment of Events,\nMichiel van Lambalgen and Fritz Hamm investigate the use of constraint logic programming to code \"temporal notions in natural language by looking at the way human beings construct time\".\nKnowledge representation.\nThe use of logic to represent procedural knowledge and strategic information was one of the main goals contributing to the early development of logic programming. Moreover, it continues to be an important feature of the Prolog family of logic programming languages today. However, many applications of logic programming, including Prolog applications, increasingly focus on the use of logic to represent purely declarative knowledge. These applications include both the representation of general commonsense knowledge and the representation of domain specific expertise.\nCommonsense includes knowledge about cause and effect, as formalised, for example, in the situation calculus, event calculus and action languages. Here is a simplified example, which illustrates the main features of such formalisms. The first clause states that a fact holds immediately after an event initiates (or causes) the fact. The second clause is a \"frame axiom\", which states that a fact that holds at a time continues to hold at the next time unless it is terminated by an event that happens at the time. This formulation allows more than one event to occur at the same time:\nholds(Fact, Time2) :- \n happens(Event, Time1),\n Time2 is Time1 + 1,\n initiates(Event, Fact).\nholds(Fact, Time2) :- \n happens(Event, Time1),\n Time2 is Time1 + 1,\n holds(Fact, Time1),\n not(terminated(Fact, Time1)).\nterminated(Fact, Time) :-\n happens(Event, Time),\n terminates(Event, Fact).\nHere codice_50 is a meta-predicate, similar to codice_51 above. However, whereas codice_51 has only one argument, which applies to general clauses, the first argument of codice_50 is a fact and the second argument is a time (or state). The atomic formula codice_54 expresses that the codice_55 holds at the codice_56. Such time-varying facts are also called fluents. The atomic formula codice_57 expresses that the Event happens at the codice_56.\nThe following example illustrates how these clauses can be used to reason about causality in a toy blocks world. Here, in the initial state at time 0, a green block is on a table and a red block is stacked on the green block (like a traffic light). At time 0, the red block is moved to the table. At time 1, the green block is moved onto the red block. Moving an object onto a place terminates the fact that the object is on any place, and initiates the fact that the object is on the place to which it is moved:\nholds(on(green_block, table), 0).\nholds(on(red_block, green_block), 0).\nhappens(move(red_block, table), 0).\nhappens(move(green_block, red_block), 1).\ninitiates(move(Object, Place), on(Object, Place)).\nterminates(move(Object, Place2), on(Object, Place1)).\n?- holds(Fact, Time).\nFact = on(green_block,table),\nTime = 0.\nFact = on(red_block,green_block),\nTime = 0.\nFact = on(green_block,table),\nTime = 1.\nFact = on(red_block,table),\nTime = 1.\nFact = on(green_block,red_block),\nTime = 2.\nFact = on(red_block,table),\nTime = 2.\nForward reasoning and backward reasoning generate the same answers to the goal codice_54. But forward reasoning generates fluents \"progressively\" in temporal order, and backward reasoning generates fluents \"regressively\", as in the domain-specific use of regression in the situation calculus.\nLogic programming has also proved to be useful for representing domain-specific expertise in expert systems. But human expertise, like general-purpose commonsense, is mostly implicit and tacit, and it is often difficult to represent such implicit knowledge in explicit rules. This difficulty does not arise, however, when logic programs are used to represent the existing, explicit rules of a business organisation or legal authority.\nFor example, here is a representation of a simplified version of the first sentence of the British Nationality Act, which states that a person who is born in the UK becomes a British citizen at the time of birth if a parent of the person is a British citizen at the time of birth:\ninitiates(birth(Person), citizen(Person, uk)):-\n time_of(birth(Person), Time),\n place_of(birth(Person), uk),\n parent_child(Another_Person, Person),\n holds(citizen(Another_Person, uk), Time).\nHistorically, the representation of a large portion of the British Nationality Act as a logic program in the 1980s was \"hugely influential for the development of computational representations of legislation, showing how logic programming enables intuitively appealing representations that can be directly deployed to generate automatic inferences\".\nMore recently, the PROLEG system, initiated in 2009 and consisting of approximately 2500 rules and exceptions of civil code and supreme court case rules in Japan, has become possibly the largest legal rule base in the world.\nVariants and extensions.\nProlog.\nThe SLD resolution rule of inference is neutral about the order in which subgoals in the bodies of clauses can be \"selected\" for solution. For the sake of efficiency, Prolog restricts this order to the order in which the subgoals are written. SLD is also neutral about the strategy for searching the space of SLD proofs.\nProlog searches this space, top-down, depth-first, trying different clauses for solving the same (sub)goal in the order in which the clauses are written.\nThis search strategy has the advantage that the current branch of the tree can be represented efficiently by a stack. When a goal clause at the top of the stack is reduced to a new goal clause, the new goal clause is pushed onto the top of the stack. When the selected subgoal in the goal clause at the top of the stack cannot be solved, the search strategy \"backtracks\", removing the goal clause from the top of the stack, and retrying the attempted solution of the selected subgoal in the previous goal clause using the next clause that matches the selected subgoal.\nBacktracking can be restricted by using a subgoal, called \"cut\", written as !, which always succeeds but cannot be backtracked. Cut can be used to improve efficiency, but can also interfere with the logical meaning of clauses. In many cases, the use of cut can be replaced by negation as failure. In fact, negation as failure can be defined in Prolog, by using cut, together with any literal, say \"fail\", that unifies with the head of no clause:\nnot(P) :- P, !, fail.\nnot(P).\nProlog provides other features, in addition to cut, that do not have a logical interpretation. These include the built-in predicates \"assert\" and \"retract\" for destructively updating the state of the program during program execution.\nFor example, the toy blocks world example above can be implemented without frame axioms using destructive change of state:\non(green_block, table).\non(red_block, green_block).\nmove(Object, Place2) :- \n retract(on(Object, Place1)), \n assert(on(Object, Place2).\nThe sequence of move events and the resulting locations of the blocks can be computed by executing the query:\n?- move(red_block, table), move(green_block, red_block), on(Object, Place).\nObject = red_block,\nPlace = table.\nObject = green_block,\nPlace = red_block.\nVarious extensions of logic programming have been developed to provide a logical framework for such destructive change of state.\nThe broad range of Prolog applications, both in isolation and in combination with other languages is highlighted in the Year of Prolog Book, celebrating the 50 year anniversary of Prolog in 2022.\nProlog has also contributed to the development of other programming languages, including ALF, Fril, G\u00f6del, Mercury, Oz, Ciao, Visual Prolog, XSB, and \u03bbProlog.\nConstraint logic programming.\nConstraint logic programming (CLP) combines Horn clause logic programming with constraint solving. It extends Horn clauses by allowing some predicates, declared as constraint predicates, to occur as literals in the body of a clause. Constraint predicates are not defined by the facts and rules in the program, but are predefined by some domain-specific model-theoretic structure or theory.\nProcedurally, subgoals whose predicates are defined by the program are solved by goal-reduction, as in ordinary logic programming, but constraints are simplified and checked for satisfiability by a domain-specific constraint-solver, which implements the semantics of the constraint predicates. An initial problem is solved by reducing it to a satisfiable conjunction of constraints.\nInterestingly, the first version of Prolog already included a constraint predicate dif(term1, term2), from Philippe Roussel's 1972 PhD thesis, which succeeds if both of its arguments are different terms, but which is delayed if either of the terms contains a variable.\nThe following constraint logic program represents a toy temporal database of codice_60 history as a teacher:\nteaches(john, hardware, T) :- 1990 \u2264 T, T &lt; 1999.\nteaches(john, software, T) :- 1999 \u2264 T, T &lt; 2005.\nteaches(john, logic, T) :- 2005 \u2264 T, T \u2264 2012.\nrank(john, instructor, T) :- 1990 \u2264 T, T &lt; 2010.\nrank(john, professor, T) :- 2010 \u2264 T, T &lt; 2014.\nHere codice_61 and codice_62 are constraint predicates, with their usual intended semantics. The following goal clause queries the database to find out when codice_63 both taught codice_64 and was a codice_65:\n?- teaches(john, logic, T), rank(john, professor, T).\nThe solution \ncodice_66\nresults from simplifying the constraints\ncodice_67\nConstraint logic programming has been used to solve problems in such fields as civil engineering, mechanical engineering, digital circuit verification, automated timetabling, air traffic control, and finance. It is closely related to abductive logic programming.\nDatalog.\nDatalog is a database definition language, which combines a relational view of data, as in relational databases, with a logical view, as in logic programming.\nRelational databases use a relational calculus or relational algebra, with relational operations, such as \"union\", \"intersection\", \"set difference\" and \"cartesian product\" to specify queries, which access a database. Datalog uses logical connectives, such as \"or\", \"and\" and \"not\" in the bodies of rules to define relations as part of the database itself.\nIt was recognized early in the development of relational databases that recursive queries cannot be expressed in either relational algebra or relational calculus, and that this defficiency can be remedied by introducing a least-fixed-point operator. In contrast, recursive relations can be defined naturally by rules in logic programs, without the need for any new logical connectives or operators.\nDatalog differs from more general logic programming by having only constants and variables as terms. Moreover, all facts are variable-free, and rules are restricted, so that if they are executed bottom-up, then the derived facts are also variable-free.\nFor example, consider the family database:\nmother_child(elizabeth, charles).\nfather_child(charles, william).\nfather_child(charles, harry).\nparent_child(X, Y) :- \n mother_child(X, Y).\nparent_child(X, Y) :- \n father_child(X, Y).\nancestor_descendant(X, Y) :- \n parent_child(X, X).\nancestor_descendant(X, Y) :- \n ancestor_descendant(X, Z), \n ancestor_descendant(Z, Y).\nBottom-up execution derives the following set of additional facts and terminates:\nparent_child(elizabeth, charles).\nparent_child(charles, william).\nparent_child(charles, harry).\nancestor_descendant(elizabeth, charles).\nancestor_descendant(charles, william).\nancestor_descendant(charles, harry).\nancestor_descendant(elizabeth, william).\nancestor_descendant(elizabeth, harry).\nTop-down execution derives the same answers to the query:\n?- ancestor_descendant(X, Y).\nBut then it goes into an infinite loop. However, top-down execution with tabling gives the same answers and terminates without looping.\nAnswer set programming.\nLike Datalog, Answer Set programming (ASP) is not Turing-complete. Moreover, instead of separating goals (or queries) from the program to be used in solving the goals, ASP treats the whole program as a goal, and solves the goal by generating a stable model that makes the goal true. For this purpose, it uses the stable model semantics, according to which a logic program can have zero, one or more intended models. For example, the following program represents a degenerate variant of the map colouring problem of colouring two countries red or green:\ncountry(oz).\ncountry(iz).\nadjacent(oz, iz).\ncolour(C, red) :- country(C), not(colour(C, green)).\ncolour(C, green) :- country(C), not(colour(C, red)).\nThe problem has four solutions represented by four stable models:\ncountry(oz). country(iz). adjacent(oz, iz). colour(oz, red). colour(iz, red).\ncountry(oz). country(iz). adjacent(oz, iz). colour(oz, green). colour(iz, green).\ncountry(oz). country(iz). adjacent(oz, iz). colour(oz, red). colour(iz, green).\ncountry(oz). country(iz). adjacent(oz, iz). colour(oz, green). colour(iz, red).\nTo represent the standard version of the map colouring problem, we need to add a constraint that two adjacent countries cannot be coloured the same colour. In ASP, this constraint can be written as a clause of the form:\n- country(C1), country(C2), adjacent(C1, C2), colour(C1, X), colour(C2, X).\nWith the addition of this constraint, the problem now has only two solutions:\ncountry(oz). country(iz). adjacent(oz, iz). colour(oz, red). colour(iz, green).\ncountry(oz). country(iz). adjacent(oz, iz). colour(oz, green). colour(iz, red).\nThe addition of constraints of the form codice_68 eliminates models in which codice_69 is true.\nConfusingly, \"constraints in ASP\" are different from \"constraints in CLP\". Constraints in CLP are predicates that qualify answers to queries (and solutions of goals). Constraints in ASP are clauses that eliminate models that would otherwise satisfy goals. Constraints in ASP are like integrity constraints in databases.\nThis combination of ordinary logic programming clauses and constraint clauses illustrates the generate-and-test methodology of problem solving in ASP: The ordinary clauses define a search space of possible solutions, and the constraints filter out unwanted solutions.\nMost implementations of ASP proceed in two steps: First they instantiate the program in all possible ways, reducing it to a propositional logic program (known as \"grounding\"). Then they apply a propositional logic problem solver, such as the DPLL algorithm or a Boolean SAT solver. However, some implementations, such as s(CASP) use a goal-directed, top-down, SLD resolution-like procedure without\ngrounding.\nAbductive logic programming.\nAbductive logic programming (ALP), like CLP, extends normal logic programming by allowing the bodies of clauses to contain literals whose predicates are not defined by clauses. In ALP, these predicates are declared as \"abducible\" (or \"assumable\"), and are used as in abductive reasoning to explain observations, or more generally to add new facts to the program (as assumptions) to solve goals.\nFor example, suppose we are given an initial state in which a red block is on a green block on a table at time 0:\nholds(on(green_block, table), 0).\nholds(on(red_block, green_block), 0).\nSuppose we are also given the goal:\n?- holds(on(green_block,red_block), 3), holds(on(red_block,table), 3).\nThe goal can represent an observation, in which case a solution is an explanation of the observation. Or the goal can represent a desired future state of affairs, in which case a solution is a plan for achieving the goal.\nWe can use the rules for cause and effect presented earlier to solve the goal, by treating the codice_70 predicate as abducible:\nholds(Fact, Time2) :- \n happens(Event, Time1),\n Time2 is Time1 + 1,\n initiates(Event, Fact).\nholds(Fact, Time2) :- \n happens(Event, Time1),\n Time2 is Time1 + 1,\n holds(Fact, Time1),\n not(terminated(Fact, Time1)).\nterminated(Fact, Time) :-\n happens(Event, Time),\n terminates(Event, Fact).\ninitiates(move(Object, Place), on(Object, Place)).\nterminates(move(Object, Place2), on(Object, Place1)).\nALP solves the goal by reasoning backwards and adding assumptions to the program, to solve abducible subgoals. In this case there are many alternative solutions, including:\nhappens(move(red_block, table), 0).\nhappens(tick, 1).\nhappens(move(green_block, red_block), 2).\nhappens(tick,0).\nhappens(move(red_block, table), 1).\nhappens(move(green_block, red_block), 2).\nhappens(move(red_block, table), 0).\nhappens(move(green_block, red_block), 1).\nhappens(tick, 2).\nHere tick is an event that marks the passage of time without initiating or terminating any fluents.\nThere are also solutions in which the two codice_71 events happen at the same time. For example:\nhappens(move(red_block, table), 0).\nhappens(move(green_block, red_block), 0).\nhappens(tick, 1).\nhappens(tick, 2).\nSuch solutions, if not desired, can be removed by adding an integrity constraint, which is like a constraint clause in ASP:\n- happens(move(Block1, Place), Time), happens(move(Block2, Block1), Time).\nAbductive logic programming has been used for fault diagnosis, planning, natural language processing and machine learning. It has also been used to interpret negation as failure as a form of abductive reasoning.\nInductive logic programming.\nInductive logic programming (ILP) is an approach to machine learning that induces logic programs as hypothetical generalisations of positive and negative examples. Given a logic program representing background knowledge and positive examples together with constraints representing negative examples, an ILP system induces a logic program that generalises the positive examples while excluding the negative examples.\nILP is similar to ALP, in that both can be viewed as generating hypotheses to explain observations, and as employing constraints to exclude undesirable hypotheses. But in ALP the hypotheses are variable-free facts, and in ILP the hypotheses are general rules.\nFor example, given only background knowledge of the mother_child and father_child relations, and suitable examples of the grandparent_child relation, current ILP systems can generate the definition of grandparent_child, inventing an auxiliary predicate, which can be interpreted as the parent_child relation:\ngrandparent_child(X, Y):- auxiliary(X, Z), auxiliary(Z, Y).\nauxiliary(X, Y):- mother_child(X, Y).\nauxiliary(X, Y):- father_child(X, Y).\nStuart Russell has referred to such invention of new concepts as the most important step needed for reaching human-level AI.\nRecent work in ILP, combining logic programming, learning and probability, has given rise to the fields of statistical relational learning and probabilistic inductive logic programming.\nConcurrent logic programming.\nConcurrent logic programming integrates concepts of logic programming with concurrent programming. Its development was given a big impetus in the 1980s by its choice for the systems programming language of the Japanese Fifth Generation Project (FGCS).\nA concurrent logic program is a set of guarded Horn clauses of the form:\ncodice_72\nThe conjunction codice_73 is called the guard of the clause, and | is the commitment operator. Declaratively, guarded Horn clauses are read as ordinary logical implications:\ncodice_74\nHowever, procedurally, when there are several clauses whose heads codice_75 match a given goal, then all of the clauses are executed in parallel, checking whether their guards codice_73 hold. If the guards of more than one clause hold, then a committed choice is made to one of the clauses, and execution proceeds with the subgoals codice_77 of the chosen clause. These subgoals can also be executed in parallel. Thus concurrent logic programming implements a form of \"don't care nondeterminism\", rather than \"don't know nondeterminism\".\nFor example, the following concurrent logic program defines a predicate codice_78, which can be used to shuffle two lists codice_79 and codice_80, combining them into a single list codice_81 that preserves the ordering of the two lists codice_79 and codice_80:\nshuffle([], [], []).\nshuffle(Left, Right, Merge) :-\n Left = [First | Rest] |\n Merge = [First | ShortMerge],\n shuffle(Rest, Right, ShortMerge).\nshuffle(Left, Right, Merge) :-\n Right = [First | Rest] |\n Merge = [First | ShortMerge],\n shuffle(Left, Rest, ShortMerge).\nHere, codice_84 represents the empty list, and codice_85 represents a list with first element codice_86 followed by list codice_87, as in Prolog. (Notice that the first occurrence of | in the second and third clauses is the list constructor, whereas the second occurrence of | is the commitment operator.) The program can be used, for example, to shuffle the lists codice_88 and codice_89 by invoking the goal clause:\nshuffle([ace, queen, king], [1, 4, 2], Merge).\nThe program will non-deterministically generate a single solution, for example codice_90.\nCarl Hewitt has argued that, because of the indeterminacy of concurrent computation, concurrent logic programming cannot implement general concurrency. However, according to the logical semantics, any result of a computation of a concurrent logic program is a logical consequence of the program, even though not all logical consequences can be derived.\nConcurrent constraint logic programming.\nConcurrent constraint logic programming combines concurrent logic programming and constraint logic programming, using constraints to control concurrency. A clause can contain a guard, which is a set of constraints that may block the applicability of the clause. When the guards of several clauses are satisfied, concurrent constraint logic programming makes a committed choice to use only one.\nHigher-order logic programming.\nSeveral researchers have extended logic programming with higher-order programming features derived from higher-order logic, such as predicate variables. Such languages include the Prolog extensions HiLog and \u03bbProlog.\nLinear logic programming.\nBasing logic programming within linear logic has resulted in the design of logic programming languages that are considerably more expressive than those based on classical logic. Horn clause programs can only represent state change by the change in arguments to predicates. In linear logic programming, one can use the ambient linear logic to support state change. Some early designs of logic programming languages based on linear logic include LO, Lolli, ACL, and Forum. Forum provides a goal-directed interpretation of all linear logic.\nObject-oriented logic programming.\nF-logic extends logic programming with objects and the frame syntax.\nLogtalk extends the Prolog programming language with support for objects, protocols, and other OOP concepts. It supports most standard-compliant Prolog systems as backend compilers.\nTransaction logic programming.\nTransaction logic is an extension of logic programming with a logical theory of state-modifying updates. It has both a model-theoretic semantics and a procedural one. An implementation of a subset of Transaction logic is available in the Flora-2 system. Other prototypes are also available.\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Located in Amhara Region in the north-western Ethiopian Highlands, the lake is approximately long and wide, with a maximum depth of , and an elevation of . Lake Tana is fed by the Gilgel Abay, Reb and Gumara rivers. Its surface area ranges from , depending on season and rainfall. The lake level has been regulated since the construction of the control weir where the lake discharges into the Blue Nile. This controls the flow to the Blue Nile Falls (Tis Abbai) and hydro-power station.\nIn 2015, the Lake Tana region was nominated as a UNESCO Biosphere Reserve recognizing its national and international natural and cultural importance.\nOverview.\nLake Tana was formed by volcanic activity, which blocked the flow of inflowing rivers in the early Pleistocene, about 5 million years ago.\nThe lake was originally much larger than it is today. Seven large permanent rivers feed the lake as well as 40 small seasonal rivers. The main tributaries to the lake are Gilgel Abbay (Little Nile River), and the Megech, Gumara, and Rib rivers.\nLake Tana has a number of islands, whose number varies with the lake's level. It has fallen about in the last 400 years. According to Manuel de Almeida, a Portuguese missionary in the early 17th century, there were 21 islands, seven pr eight of which had monasteries on them \"formerly large, but now much diminished.\" When James Bruce visited the area in 1771, he noted that the locals counted 45 inhabited islands, but stated he believed that \"the number may be about eleven.\" Anton Stecker, in 1881, made a detailed examination of the lake, enabling substantially accurate maps, and counted 44 islands. A 20th-century geographer named 37 islands, of which he believed 19 have or had monasteries or churches on them.\nRemains of ancient Ethiopian emperors and treasures of Ethiopic Christianity are kept in the isolated island monasteries (including Kebran Gabriel, Ura Kidane Mehret, Narga Selassie, Daga Estifanos, Medhane Alem of Rema Island, Kota Maryam, and Mertola Maryam). On the island of Tana Qirqos is a rock shown to Paul B. Henze, on which he was told Mary, mother of Jesus had rested on her journey back from Egypt; he was also told that Frumentius, who introduced Christianity to Ethiopia, is \"allegedly buried on Tana Cherqos.\" The body of Yekuno Amlak is interred in the monastery of St. Stephen on Daga Island. Emperors whose tombs are also on Daga include Dawit I, Zara Yaqob, Za Dengel, and Fasilides. Other important islands in Lake Tana include Dek, Mitraha, Gelila Zakarias, Halimun and Briguida.\nThe monasteries are believed to have been built during the Middle Ages over earlier religious sites. They include the fourteenth-century Debre Maryam, and the eighteenth-century Narga Selassie, Tana Qirqos, which is said to have housed the Ark of the Covenant before it was moved to Axum, and Ura Kidane Mehret, known for its regalia. A ferry service links Bahir Dar with Gorgora via Dek and various lakeshore villages.\nThere is also Zege Peninsula on the southwest portion of the lake. Zege is the site of the Azwa Maryam monastery.\nLake Tana was also a central location of the Beta Israel, complete with the only Jewish monasteries in the world, before their immigration to Israel.\nWater characteristics and floods.\nCompared to other tropical lakes, the waters in Lake Tana are relatively cold, typically ranging from about . The water has a pH that is neutral to somewhat alkaline and its transparency is quite low.\nBecause of the large seasonal variations in the inflow of its tributaries, rain and evaporation, the water levels of Lake Tana typically vary by in a year, peaking in September\u2013October just after the main wet season. When the water levels are high, the plains around the lake often are flooded and other permanent swamps in the region become connected to the lake.\nFauna.\nSince there are no inflows that link the lake to other large waterways and the main outflow, the Blue Nile, is obstructed by the Blue Nile Falls, the lake supports a highly distinctive aquatic fauna, which generally is related to species from the Nile Basin. The lake's nutrient levels are low.\nFish.\nThere are 27 fish species in Lake Tana and 20 of these are endemic. This includes one of only two known cyprinid species flocks (the other, from Lake Lanao in the Philippines, has been decimated by introduced species). It consists of 15 relatively large, up to long, \"Labeobarbus\" barbs that formerly were included in \"Barbus\" instead. Among these, \"L. acutirostris\", \"L. longissimus\", \"L. megastoma\" and \"L. truttiformis\" are strictly piscivorous, and \"L. dainellii\", \"L. gorguari\", \"L. macrophtalmus\" and \"L. platydorsus\" are mostly piscivorous. Their most important prey are the small \"Enteromius\" and \"Garra\" species. The remaining \"Labeobarbus\" in Lake Tana have other specialized feeding habits: \"L. beso\" (non-endemic and not closely related to the others) feeds on algae, \"L. surkis\" mostly on macrophytes, \"L. gorgorensis\" on macrophytes and molluscs, \"L. brevicephalus\" on zooplankton (however, juveniles of all members of the species flock feed on zooplankton), \"L. osseensis\" on macrophytes and adults insects, and \"L. crassibarbis\", \"L. intermedius\" (non-endemic but closely related to the others), \"L. nedgia\" and \"L. tsanensis\" on benthic invertebrates like chironomid larvae. Among the endemic \"Labeobarbus\", eight species spawn in the lake's wetlands and the remaining move seasonally into its tributaries where they spawn.\nIn addition to the \"Labeobarbus\" species flock, the endemic species are \"Enteromius pleurogramma\", \"E. tanapelagius\", \"Garra regressus\" and \"Afronemacheilus abyssinicus\" (one of only two African stone loaches). The remaining non-endemic species are Nile tilapia (widespread in Africa, but with the endemic subspecies \"tana\" in the lake), \"E. humilis\", \"G. dembecha\", \"G. dembeensis\" and the large African sharptooth catfish.\nFishing and threats.\nLake Tana supports a large fishing industry, mainly based on the \"Labeobarbus\" barbs, Nile tilapia and sharptooth catfish. According to the Ethiopian Department of Fisheries and Aquaculture, 1,454 tons of fish were landed in 2011 at Bahir Dar, which the department estimated was 15% of its sustainable amount. Nevertheless, in a review that compared catches in 2001 to those ten years earlier, it was found that typical sizes of both the tilapia and the catfish had significantly decreased, and populations of the \"Labeobarbus\" barbs that breed in the tributaries had significantly declined. Among the endemic fish, most are considered threatened (endangered or vulnerable) or data deficient (available data insufficient for evaluating a status) by the IUCN. In the early 2000s, the local government for the first time introduced a fisheries legislation and it is hoped this will have a positive effect on the fish populations.\nOther serious threats are habitat destruction and pollution. Bahir Dar has become a large city and it is rapidly growing; its wastewater is generally released directly into the lake. The vegetation in the lake's wetlands, which are an important nursery for the \"Labeobarbus\" and other fish, are being cleared at a fast pace. A potentially serious threat to the unique ecosystem would be an introduction of a large and efficient predatory species like the Nile perch, which has been implicated in numerous extinctions in Lake Victoria. The piscivorous \"Labeobarbus\" of Lake Tana are relatively inefficient predators that can only take fish up to about 15% of the length of the predator itself.\nOther fauna.\nAmong other fauna, the lake supports relatively few invertebrates: There are fifteen species of mollusks, including one endemic, and also an endemic freshwater sponge.\nAbout 230 species of birds, including more than 80 wetland birds such as the great white pelican, African darter, hamerkop, storks, African spoonbill, ibis, ducks, kingfishers and African fish eagle, are known from Lake Tana. It is an important resting and feeding ground for many Palearctic migrant waterbirds.\nThere are no crocodiles, but the African softshell turtle and Nile monitor have been recorded near the Blue Nile outflow from the lake. Hippos are present, mostly near the Blue Nile outflow.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "17932", "revid": "50953854", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=17932", "title": "Liquid-crystal display", "text": "Display that uses the light-modulating properties of liquid crystals\nA liquid-crystal display (LCD) is a flat-panel display or other electronically modulated optical device that uses the light-modulating properties of liquid crystals combined with polarizers to display information. Liquid crystals do not emit light directly but instead use a backlight or reflector to produce images in color or monochrome.\nLCDs are available to display arbitrary images (as in a general-purpose computer display) or fixed images with low information content, which can be displayed or hidden: preset words, digits, and seven-segment displays (as in a digital clock) are all examples of devices with these displays. They use the same basic technology, except that arbitrary images are made from a matrix of small pixels, while other displays have larger elements.\nLCDs are used in a wide range of applications, including LCD televisions, computer monitors, instrument panels, aircraft cockpit displays, and indoor and outdoor signage. Small LCD screens are common in LCD projectors and portable consumer devices such as digital cameras, watches, calculators, and mobile telephones, including smartphones. LCD screens have replaced heavy, bulky and less energy-efficient cathode-ray tube (CRT) displays in nearly all applications since the late 2000s to the early 2010s.\nLCDs can either be normally on (positive) or off (negative), depending on the polarizer arrangement. For example, a character positive LCD with a backlight has black lettering on a background that is the color of the backlight, and a character negative LCD has a black background with the letters being of the same color as the backlight. \nLCDs are not subject to screen burn-in like on CRTs. However, LCDs are still susceptible to image persistence.\nGeneral characteristics.\nEach pixel of an LCD typically consists of a layer of molecules aligned between two transparent electrodes, often made of indium tin oxide (ITO), and two polarizing filters (parallel and perpendicular polarizers), the axes of transmission of which are (in most of the cases) perpendicular to each other. Without the liquid crystal between the polarizing filters, light passing through the first filter would be blocked by the second (crossed) polarizer. Before an electric field is applied, the orientation of the liquid-crystal molecules is determined by the alignment at the surfaces of electrodes. In a twisted nematic (TN) device, the surface alignment directions at the two electrodes are perpendicular to each other, and so the molecules arrange themselves in a helical structure, or twist. This induces the rotation of the polarization of the incident light, and the device appears gray. If the applied voltage is large enough, the liquid crystal molecules in the center of the layer are almost completely untwisted and the polarization of the incident light is not rotated as it passes through the liquid crystal layer. This light will then be mainly polarized perpendicular to the second filter, and thus be blocked and the pixel will appear black. By controlling the voltage applied across the liquid crystal layer in each pixel, light can be allowed to pass through in varying amounts thus constituting different levels of gray.\nThe chemical formula of the liquid crystals used in LCDs may vary. Formulas may be patented. An example is a mixture of 2-(4-alkoxyphenyl)-5-alkylpyrimidine with cyanobiphenyl, patented by Merck and Sharp Corporation. The patent that covered that specific mixture has expired.\nMost color LCD systems use the same technique, with color filters used to generate red, green, and blue subpixels. The LCD color filters are made with a photolithography process on large glass sheets that are later glued with other glass sheets containing a thin-film transistor (TFT) array, spacers and liquid crystal, creating several color LCDs that are then cut from one another and laminated with polarizer sheets. Red, green, blue and black colored photoresists (resists) are used to create color filters. All resists contain a finely ground powdered pigment, with particles being just 40 nanometers across. The black resist is the first to be applied; this will create a black grid (known in the industry as a black matrix) that will separate red, green and blue subpixels from one another, increasing contrast ratios and preventing light from leaking from one subpixel onto other surrounding subpixels. After the black resist has been dried in an oven and exposed to UV light through a photomask, the unexposed areas are washed away, creating a black grid. Then the same process is repeated with the remaining resists. This fills the holes in the black grid with their corresponding colored resists. Black matrices made in the 1980s and 1990s when most color LCD production was for laptop computers, are made of Chromium due to its high opacity, but due to environmental concerns, manufacturers shifted to black colored photoresist with carbon pigment as the black matrix material. Another color-generation method used in early color PDAs and some calculators was done by varying the voltage in a Super-twisted nematic LCD, where the variable twist between tighter-spaced plates causes a varying double refraction birefringence, thus changing the hue. They were typically restricted to 3 colors per pixel: orange, green, and blue.\nThe optical effect of a TN device in the voltage-on state is far less dependent on variations in the device thickness than that in the voltage-off state. Because of this, TN displays with low information content and no backlighting are usually operated between crossed polarizers such that they appear bright with no voltage (the eye is much more sensitive to variations in the dark state than the bright state). As most of 2010-era LCDs are used in television sets, monitors and smartphones, they have high-resolution matrix arrays of pixels to display arbitrary images using backlighting with a dark background. When no image is displayed, different arrangements are used. For this purpose, TN LCDs are operated between parallel polarizers, whereas IPS LCDs feature crossed polarizers. In many applications IPS LCDs have replaced TN LCDs, particularly in smartphones. Both the liquid crystal material and the alignment layer material contain ionic compounds. If an electric field of one particular polarity is applied for a long period of time, this ionic material is attracted to the surfaces and degrades the device performance. This is avoided either by applying an alternating current or by reversing the polarity of the electric field as the device is addressed (the response of the liquid crystal layer is identical, regardless of the polarity of the applied field).\nDisplays for a small number of individual digits or fixed symbols (as in digital watches and pocket calculators) can be implemented with independent electrodes for each segment. In contrast, full alphanumeric or variable graphics displays are usually implemented with pixels arranged as a matrix consisting of electrically connected rows on one side of the liquid crystal (LC) layer and columns on the other side, which makes it possible to address each pixel at the intersections. The general method of matrix addressing consists of sequentially addressing one side of the matrix, for example by selecting the rows one-by-one and applying the picture information on the other side at the columns row-by-row.\nHistory.\nThe origin and the complex history of liquid-crystal displays from the perspective of an insider during the early days were described by Joseph A. Castellano in \"Liquid Gold: The Story of Liquid Crystal Displays and the Creation of an Industry\".\nAnother report on the origins and history of LCD from a different perspective until 1991 has been published by Hiroshi Kawamoto, available at the IEEE History Center.\nA description of Swiss contributions to LCD developments, written by Peter J. Wild, can be found at the \"Engineering and Technology History Wiki\".\nBackground.\nIn 1888, Friedrich Reinitzer (1858\u20131927) discovered the liquid crystalline nature of cholesterol extracted from carrots (that is, two melting points and generation of colors) and published his findings. In 1904, Otto Lehmann published his work \"Fl\u00fcssige Kristalle\" (Liquid Crystals). In 1911, Charles Mauguin first experimented with liquid crystals confined between plates in thin layers.\nIn 1922, Georges Friedel described the structure and properties of liquid crystals and classified them in three types (nematics, smectics and cholesterics). In 1927, Vsevolod Frederiks devised the electrically switched light valve, called the Fr\u00e9edericksz transition, the essential effect of all LCD technology. In 1936, the Marconi Wireless Telegraph company patented the first practical application of the technology, \"The Liquid Crystal Light Valve\". In 1962, the first major English language publication \"Molecular Structure and Properties of Liquid Crystals\" was published by Dr. George W. Gray. In 1962, Richard Williams of RCA found that liquid crystals had some interesting electro-optic characteristics and he realized an electro-optical effect by generating stripe patterns in a thin layer of liquid crystal material by the application of a voltage. This effect is based on an electro-hydrodynamic instability forming what are now called \"Williams domains\" inside the liquid crystal.\nBuilding on early MOSFETs, Paul K. Weimer at RCA developed the thin-film transistor (TFT) in 1962. It was a type of MOSFET distinct from the standard bulk MOSFET.\n1960s.\nIn 1964, George H. Heilmeier, who was working at the RCA laboratories on the effect discovered by Richard Williams, achieved the switching of colors by field-induced realignment of dichroic dyes in a homeotropically oriented liquid crystal. Practical problems with this new electro-optical effect made Heilmeier continue to work on scattering effects in liquid crystals and finally the achievement of the first operational liquid-crystal display based on what he called the \"dynamic scattering mode\" (DSM). Application of a voltage to a DSM display switches the initially clear transparent liquid crystal layer into a milky turbid state. DSM displays could be operated in transmissive and in reflective mode but they required a considerable current to flow for their operation. George H. Heilmeier was inducted in the National Inventors Hall of Fame and credited with the invention of LCDs. Heilmeier's work is an IEEE Milestone.\nIn the late 1960s, pioneering work on liquid crystals was undertaken by the UK's Royal Radar Establishment at Malvern, England. The team at RRE supported ongoing work by George William Gray and his team at the University of Hull who ultimately discovered the cyanobiphenyl liquid crystals, which had correct stability and temperature properties for application in LCDs.\nThe idea of a TFT-based liquid-crystal display (LCD) was conceived by Bernard Lechner of RCA Laboratories in 1968. Lechner, F.J. Marlowe, E.O. Nester and J. Tults demonstrated the concept in 1968 with an 18x2 matrix dynamic scattering mode (DSM) LCD that used standard discrete MOSFETs.\n1970s.\nOn December 4, 1970, the twisted nematic field effect (TN) in liquid crystals was filed for patent by Hoffmann-LaRoche in Switzerland, (http:// ) with Wolfgang Helfrich and Martin Schadt (then working for the Central Research Laboratories) listed as inventors. Hoffmann-La Roche licensed the invention to Swiss manufacturer Brown, Boveri &amp; Cie, its joint venture partner at that time, which produced TN displays for wristwatches and other applications during the 1970s for the international markets including the Japanese electronics industry, which soon produced the first digital quartz wristwatches with TN-LCDs and numerous other products. James Fergason, while working with Sardari Arora and Alfred Saupe at Kent State University Liquid Crystal Institute, filed an identical patent in the United States on April 22, 1971. In 1971, the company of Fergason, ILIXCO (now LXD Incorporated), produced LCDs based on the TN-effect, which soon superseded the poor-quality DSM types due to improvements of lower operating voltages and lower power consumption. Tetsuro Hama and Izuhiko Nishimura of Seiko received a US patent dated February 1971, for an electronic wristwatch incorporating a TN-LCD. In 1972, the first wristwatch with TN-LCD was launched on the market: The Gruen Teletime which was a four digit display watch.\nIn 1972, the concept of the active-matrix thin-film transistor (TFT) liquid-crystal display panel was prototyped in the United States by T. Peter Brody's team at Westinghouse, in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. In 1973, Brody, J. A. Asars and G. D. Dixon at Westinghouse Research Laboratories demonstrated the first thin-film-transistor liquid-crystal display (TFT LCD). As of 2013[ [update]], all modern high-resolution and high-quality electronic visual display devices use TFT-based active matrix displays. Brody and Fang-Chen Luo demonstrated the first flat active-matrix thin-film transistor liquid-crystal display (AM TFT LCD) in 1974, and then Brody coined the term \"active matrix\" in 1975.\nIn 1972 North American Rockwell Microelectronics Corp introduced the use of DSM LCDs for calculators for marketing by Lloyds Electronics Inc, though these required an internal light source for illumination. Sharp Corporation followed with DSM LCDs for pocket-sized calculators in 1973 and then mass-produced TN LCDs for watches in 1975. Other Japanese companies soon took a leading position in the wristwatch market, like Seiko and its first 6-digit TN-LCD quartz wristwatch, and Casio's 'Casiotron'. Color LCDs based on \"Guest-Host\" interaction were invented by a team at RCA in 1968. A particular type of such a color LCD was developed by Japan's Sharp Corporation in the 1970s, receiving patents for their inventions, such as a patent by Shinji Kato and Takaaki Miyazaki in May 1975, and then improved by Fumiaki Funada and Masataka Matsuura in December 1975. TFT LCDs similar to the prototypes developed by a Westinghouse team in 1972 were patented in 1976 by a team at Sharp consisting of Fumiaki Funada, Masataka Matsuura, and Tomio Wada, then improved in 1977 by a Sharp team consisting of Kohei Kishi, Hirosaku Nonomura, Keiichiro Shimizu, and Tomio Wada. However, these TFT-LCDs were not yet ready for use in products, as problems with the materials for the TFTs were not yet solved.\n1980s.\nIn 1983, researchers at Brown, Boveri &amp; Cie (BBC) Research Center, Switzerland, invented the \"super-twisted nematic (STN) structure\" for passive matrix-addressed LCDs. H. Amstutz et al. were listed as inventors in the corresponding patent applications filed in Switzerland on July 7, 1983, and October 28, 1983. Patents were granted in Switzerland CH 665491, Europe EP 0131216, https:// and many more countries. In 1980, Brown Boveri started a 50/50 joint venture with the Dutch Philips company, called Videlec. Philips had the required know-how to design and build integrated circuits for the control of large LCD panels. In addition, Philips had better access to markets for electronic components and intended to use LCDs in new product generations of hi-fi, video equipment and telephones. In 1984, Philips researchers Theodorus Welzen and Adrianus de Vaan invented a video speed-drive scheme that solved the slow response time of STN-LCDs, enabling high-resolution, high-quality, and smooth-moving video images on STN-LCDs. In 1985, Philips inventors Theodorus Welzen and Adrianus de Vaan solved the problem of driving high-resolution STN-LCDs using low-voltage (CMOS-based) drive electronics, allowing the application of high-quality (high resolution and video speed) LCD panels in battery-operated portable products like notebook computers and mobile phones. In 1985, Philips acquired 100% of the Videlec AG company based in Switzerland. Afterwards, Philips moved the Videlec production lines to the Netherlands. Years later, Philips successfully produced and marketed complete modules (consisting of the LCD screen, microphone, speakers etc.) in high-volume production for the booming mobile phone industry.\nThe first color LCD televisions were developed as handheld televisions in Japan. In 1980, Hattori Seiko's R&amp;D group began development on color LCD pocket televisions. In 1982, Seiko Epson released the first LCD television, the Epson TV Watch, a wristwatch equipped with a small active-matrix LCD television. Sharp Corporation introduced dot matrix TN-LCD in 1983. In 1984, Epson released the ET-10, the first full-color, pocket LCD television. The same year, Citizen Watch, introduced the Citizen Pocket TV, a 2.7-inch color LCD TV, with the first commercial TFT LCD. In 1988, Sharp demonstrated a 14-inch, active-matrix, full-color, full-motion TFT-LCD. This led to Japan launching an LCD industry, which developed large-size LCDs, including TFT computer monitors and LCD televisions. Epson developed the 3LCD projection technology in the 1980s, and licensed it for use in projectors in 1988. Epson's VPJ-700, released in January 1989, was the world's first compact, full-color LCD projector.\n1990s.\nIn 1990, under different titles, inventors conceived electro optical effects as alternatives to \"twisted nematic field effect LCDs\" (TN- and STN-LCDs). One approach was to use interdigital electrodes on one glass substrate only to produce an electric field essentially parallel to the glass substrates. To take full advantage of the properties of this \"In Plane Switching (IPS) technology\", further work was needed. After thorough analysis, details of advantageous embodiments are filed in Germany by Guenter Baur \"et al.\" and patented in various countries. The Fraunhofer Institute ISE in Freiburg, where the inventors worked, assigns these patents to Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, a supplier of LC substances. In 1992, shortly thereafter, engineers at Hitachi worked out various practical details of the IPS technology to interconnect the thin-film transistor array as a matrix and to avoid undesirable stray fields in between pixels. The first wall-mountable LCD TV was introduced by Sharp Corporation in 1992.\nHitachi also improved the viewing angle dependence further by optimizing the shape of the electrodes (\"Super IPS\"). NEC and Hitachi became early manufacturers of active-matrix addressed LCDs based on the IPS technology. This is a milestone for implementing large-screen LCDs having acceptable visual performance for flat-panel computer monitors and television screens. In 1996, Samsung developed the optical patterning technique that enables multi-domain LCD. Multi-domain and In Plane Switching subsequently remain the dominant LCD designs through 2006. In the late 1990s, the LCD industry began shifting away from Japan, towards South Korea and Taiwan, and later on towards China.\n2000s.\nIn this period, Taiwanese, Japanese, and Korean manufacturers were the dominant companies in LCD manufacturing.126 From 2001 to 2006, Samsung and five other major companies held 53 meetings in Taiwan and South Korea to fix prices in the LCD industry.127 These six companies were fined 1.3 billion dollars by the United States, 650 million Euro by the European Union, and 350 million RMB by China's National Development and Reform Commission.127\nIn 2007 the image quality of LCD televisions surpassed the image quality of cathode-ray-tube-based (CRT) TVs. In the fourth quarter of 2007, LCD televisions surpassed CRT TVs in worldwide sales for the first time. LCD TVs were projected to account 50% of the 200\u00a0million TVs to be shipped globally in 2006, according to Displaybank.\n2010s.\nIn October 2011, Toshiba announced 2560\u00a0\u00d7\u00a01600 pixels on a 6.1-inch (155\u00a0mm) LCD panel, suitable for use in a tablet computer, especially for Chinese character display. The 2010s also saw the wide adoption of TGP (Tracking Gate-line in Pixel), which moves the driving circuitry from the borders of the display to in between the pixels, allowing for narrow bezels.\nIn 2016, Panasonic developed IPS LCDs with a contrast ratio of 1,000,000:1, rivaling OLEDs. This technology was later put into mass production as dual layer, dual panel or LMCL (Light Modulating Cell Layer) LCDs. The technology uses 2 liquid crystal layers instead of one, and may be used along with a mini-LED backlight and quantum dot sheets.\nLCDs with quantum dot enhancement film or quantum dot color filters were introduced from 2015 to 2018. Quantum dots receive blue light from a backlight and convert it to light that allows LCD panels to offer better color reproduction. Quantum dot color filters are manufactured using photoresists containing quantum dots instead of colored pigments, and the quantum dots can have a special structure to improve their application onto the color filter. Quantum dot color filters offer superior light transmission over quantum dot enhancement films.\n2020s.\nIn the 2020s, China became the largest manufacturer of LCDs and Chinese firms had a 40% share of the global market.126 Chinese firms that increased their production to high levels included BOE Technology, TCL-CSOT, TIANMA, and Visionox.126 Local governments had a significant role in this growth, including as a result of their investments in LCD manufacturers via state-owned investment companies.126 China had previously imported significant amounts of LCDs, and the growth of its LCD industry decreased prices for other consumer products that use LCDs and led to growth in other sectors like mobile phones.126\nIllumination.\nLCDs do not produce light on their own, so they require external light to produce a visible image. In a transmissive type of LCD, the light source is provided at the back of the glass stack and is called a backlight. Active-matrix LCDs are almost always backlit. Passive LCDs may be backlit but many are reflective as they use a reflective surface or film at the back of the glass stack to utilize ambient light. Transflective LCDs combine the features of a backlit transmissive display and a reflective display.\nThe common implementations of LCD backlight technology are:\nToday, most LCD screens are being designed with an LED backlight instead of the traditional CCFL backlight, while that backlight is dynamically controlled with the video information (dynamic backlight control). The combination with the dynamic backlight control, invented by Philips researchers Douglas Stanton, Martinus Stroomer and Adrianus de Vaan, simultaneously increases the dynamic range of the display system (also marketed as \"HDR\", \"high dynamic range television\" or \"FLAD\", \"full-area local area dimming\").\nThe LCD backlight systems are made highly efficient by applying optical films such as prismatic structure (prism sheet) to gain the light into the desired viewer directions and reflective polarizing films that recycle the polarized light that was formerly absorbed by the first polarizer of the LCD (invented by Philips researchers Adrianus de Vaan and Paulus Schaareman), generally achieved using so called DBEF films manufactured and supplied by 3M. Improved versions of the prism sheet have a wavy rather than a prismatic structure, and introduce waves laterally into the structure of the sheet while also varying the height of the waves, directing even more light towards the screen and reducing aliasing or moir\u00e9 between the structure of the prism sheet and the subpixels of the LCD. A wavy structure is easier to mass-produce than a prismatic one using conventional diamond machine tools, which are used to make the rollers used to imprint the wavy structure into plastic sheets, thus producing prism sheets. A diffuser sheet is placed on both sides of the prism sheet to distribute the light of the backlight uniformly, while a mirror is placed behind the light guide plate to direct all light forwards. The prism sheet with its diffuser sheets are placed on top of the light guide plate. The DBEF polarizers consist of a large stack of uniaxial oriented birefringent films that reflect the former absorbed polarization mode of the light.\nDBEF polarizers using uniaxial oriented polymerized liquid crystals (birefringent polymers or birefringent glue) were invented in 1989 by Philips researchers Dirk Broer, Adrianus de Vaan and Joerg Brambring. The combination of such reflective polarizers, and LED dynamic backlight control make today's LCD televisions far more efficient than the CRT-based sets, leading to a worldwide energy saving of 600 TWh (2017), equal to 10% of the electricity consumption of all households worldwide or equal to 2 times the energy production of all solar cells in the world.\nConnection to other circuits.\nA standard television receiver screen, a modern LCD panel, has over six million pixels, and they are all individually powered by a wire network embedded in the screen. The fine wires, or pathways, form a grid with vertical wires across the whole screen on one side of the screen and horizontal wires across the whole screen on the other side of the screen. To this grid each pixel has a positive connection on one side and a negative connection on the other side. So the total amount of wires needed for a 1080p display is 3 x 1920 going vertically and 1080 going horizontally for a total of 6840 wires horizontally and vertically. That's three for red, green and blue and 1920 columns of pixels for each color for a total of 5760 wires going vertically and 1080 rows of wires going horizontally. For a panel that is 28.8 inches (73 centimeters) wide, that means a wire density of 200 wires per inch along the horizontal edge.\nThe LCD panel is powered by LCD drivers that are carefully matched up with the edge of the LCD panel at the factory level. The drivers may be installed using several methods, the most common of which are COG (Chip-On-Glass) and TAB (Tape-automated bonding) These same principles apply also for smartphone screens that are much smaller than TV screens. LCD panels typically use thinly-coated metallic conductive pathways on a glass substrate to form the cell circuitry to operate the panel. It is usually not possible to use soldering techniques to directly connect the panel to a separate copper-etched circuit board. Instead, interfacing is accomplished using anisotropic conductive film or, for lower densities, elastomeric connectors.\nPassive-matrix.\nMonochrome and later color passive-matrix LCDs were standard in most early laptops (although a few used plasma displays) and the original Nintendo Game Boy until the mid-1990s, when color active-matrix became standard on all laptops. The commercially unsuccessful Macintosh Portable (released in 1989) was one of the first to use an active-matrix display (though still monochrome). Passive-matrix LCDs are still used in the 2010s for applications less demanding than laptop computers and TVs, such as inexpensive calculators. In particular, these are used on portable devices where less information content needs to be displayed, lowest power consumption (no backlight) and low cost are desired or readability in direct sunlight is needed.\nDisplays having a passive-matrix structure use \"super-twisted nematic\" STN (invented by Brown Boveri Research Center, Baden, Switzerland, in 1983; scientific details were published) or double-layer STN (DSTN) technology (the latter of which addresses a color-shifting problem with the former), and color-STN (CSTN), in which color is added by using an internal color filter. STN LCDs have been optimized for passive-matrix addressing. They exhibit a sharper threshold of the contrast-vs-voltage characteristic than the original TN LCDs. This is important, because pixels are subjected to partial voltages even while not selected. Crosstalk between activated and non-activated pixels has to be handled properly by keeping the RMS voltage of non-activated pixels below the threshold voltage as discovered by Peter J. Wild in 1972, while activated pixels are subjected to voltages above threshold (the voltages according to the \"Alt &amp; Pleshko\" drive scheme). Driving such STN displays according to the Alt &amp; Pleshko drive scheme require very high line addressing voltages. Welzen and de Vaan invented an alternative drive scheme (a non \"Alt &amp; Pleshko\" drive scheme) requiring much lower voltages, such that the STN display could be driven using low voltage CMOS technologies. White-on-blue LCDs are STN and can use a blue polarizer, or birefringence which gives them their distinctive appearance.\nSTN LCDs have to be continuously refreshed by alternating pulsed voltages of one polarity during one frame and pulses of opposite polarity during the next frame. Individual pixels are addressed by the corresponding row and column circuits. This type of display is called \"passive-matrix addressed\", because the pixel must retain its state between refreshes without the benefit of a steady electrical charge. As the number of pixels (and, correspondingly, columns and rows) increases, this type of display becomes less feasible. Slow response times and poor contrast are typical of passive-matrix addressed LCDs with too many pixels and driven according to the \"Alt &amp; Pleshko\" drive scheme. Welzen and de Vaan also invented a non RMS drive scheme enabling to drive STN displays with video rates and enabling to show smooth moving video images on an STN display. Citizen, among others, licensed these patents and successfully introduced several STN based LCD pocket televisions on the market.\nBistable LCDs do not require continuous refreshing. Rewriting is only required for picture information changes. In 1984 HA van Sprang and AJSM de Vaan invented an STN type display that could be operated in a bistable mode, enabling extremely high resolution images up to 4000 lines or more using only low voltages. Since a pixel may be either in an on-state or in an off state at the moment new information needs to be written to that particular pixel, the addressing method of these bistable displays is rather complex, a reason why these displays did not make it to the market. That changed when in the 2010 \"zero-power\" (bistable) LCDs became available. Potentially, passive-matrix addressing can be used with devices if their write/erase characteristics are suitable, which was the case for ebooks which need to show still pictures only. After a page is written to the display, the display may be cut from the power while retaining readable images. This has the advantage that such ebooks may be operated for long periods of time powered by only a small battery.\nHigh-resolution color displays, such as modern LCD computer monitors and televisions, use an active-matrix structure. A matrix of thin-film transistors (TFTs) is added to the electrodes in contact with the LC layer. Each pixel has its own dedicated transistor, allowing each column line to access one pixel. When a row line is selected, all of the column lines are connected to a row of pixels and voltages corresponding to the picture information are driven onto all of the column lines. The row line is then deactivated and the next row line is selected. All of the row lines are selected in sequence during a refresh operation. Active-matrix addressed displays look brighter and sharper than passive-matrix addressed displays of the same size, and generally have quicker response times, producing much better images. Sharp produces bistable reflective LCDs with a 1-bit SRAM cell per pixel that only requires small amounts of power to maintain an image.\nSegment LCDs can also have color by using Field Sequential Color (FSC LCD). This kind of displays have a high speed passive segment LCD panel with an RGB backlight. The backlight quickly changes color, making it appear white to the naked eye. The LCD panel is synchronized with the backlight. For example, to make a segment appear red, the segment is only turned ON when the backlight is red, and to make a segment appear magenta, the segment is turned ON when the backlight is blue, and it continues to be ON while the backlight becomes red, and it turns OFF when the backlight becomes green. To make a segment appear black, the segment is always turned ON. An FSC LCD divides a color image into 3 images (one Red, one Green and one Blue) and it displays them in order. Due to persistence of vision, the 3 monochromatic images appear as one color image. An FSC LCD needs an LCD panel with a refresh rate of 180\u00a0Hz, and the response time is reduced to just 5 milliseconds when compared with normal STN LCD panels which have a response time of 16 milliseconds. FSC LCDs contain a Chip-On-Glass driver IC can also be used with a capacitive touchscreen. This technique can also be applied in displays meant to show images, as it can offer higher light transmission and thus potential for reduced power consumption in the backlight due to omission of color filters in LCDs.\nSamsung introduced UFB (Ultra Fine &amp; Bright) displays back in 2002, utilized the super-birefringent effect. It has the luminance, color gamut, and most of the contrast of a TFT-LCD, but only consumes as much power as an STN display, according to Samsung. It was being used in a variety of Samsung cellular-telephone models produced until late 2006, when Samsung stopped producing UFB displays. UFB displays were also used in certain models of LG mobile phones.\nActive-matrix technologies.\nTwisted nematic (TN).\nTwisted nematic displays contain liquid crystals that twist and untwist at varying degrees to allow light to pass through. When no voltage is applied to a TN liquid crystal cell, polarized light passes through the 90-degrees twisted LC layer. In proportion to the voltage applied, the liquid crystals untwist changing the polarization and blocking the light's path. By properly adjusting the level of the voltage almost any gray level or transmission can be achieved.\nIn-plane switching (IPS).\nIn-plane switching (IPS) is an LCD technology that aligns the liquid crystals in a plane parallel to the glass substrates. In this method, the electrical field is applied through opposite electrodes on the same glass substrate, so that the liquid crystals can be reoriented (switched) essentially in the same plane, although fringe fields inhibit a homogeneous reorientation. This requires two transistors for each pixel instead of the single transistor needed for a standard thin-film transistor (TFT) display. IPS technology is used in everything from televisions, computer monitors, and even wearable devices; almost all LCD smartphone panels are IPS/FFS mode. IPS displays belong to the LCD panel family screen types. The other two types are VA and TN. Before LG Enhanced IPS was introduced in 2001 by Hitachi as 17\" monitor in Market, the additional transistors resulted in blocking more transmission area, thus requiring a brighter backlight and consuming more power, making this type of display less desirable for notebook computers. Panasonic Himeji G8.5 was using an enhanced version of IPS, also LG Display in Korea, then currently the world biggest LCD panel manufacture BOE in China is also IPS/FFS mode TV panel.\nSuper In-plane switching (S-IPS).\nSuper-IPS was introduced after in-plane switching with even better response times and color reproduction.\nM+ or RGBW controversy.\nIn 2015 LG Display announced the implementation of a new technology called M+ which is the addition of white subpixel along with the regular RGB dots in their IPS panel technology.\nMost of the new M+ technology was employed on 4K TV sets which led to a controversy after tests showed that the addition of a white sub pixel replacing the traditional RGB structure had also been accompanied by a reduction in resolution by around 25%. This meant that a \"4K\" M+ TV would not display the full UHD TV standard. The media and internet users called them \"RGBW\" TVs because of the white sub pixel. Although LG Display has developed this technology for use in notebook display, outdoor and smartphones, it became more popular in the TV market because of the announced \"4K UHD\" resolution but still being incapable of achieving true UHD resolution defined by the CTA as 3840x2160 active pixels with 8-bit color. This negatively impacted the rendering of text, making it a bit fuzzier, which was especially noticeable when a TV is used as a PC monitor.\nIPS in comparison to AMOLED.\nIn 2011, LG claimed the smartphone LG Optimus Black (IPS LCD (LCD NOVA)) has the brightness up to 700 nits, while the competitor has only IPS LCD with 518 nits and double an active-matrix OLED (AMOLED) display with 305 nits. LG also claimed the NOVA display to be 50 percent more efficient than regular LCDs and to consume only 50 percent of the power of AMOLED displays when producing white on screen. When it comes to contrast ratio, AMOLED display still performs best due to its underlying technology, where the black levels are displayed as pitch black and not as dark gray. On August 24, 2011, Nokia announced the Nokia 701 and also made the claim of the world's brightest display at 1000 nits. The screen also had Nokia's ClearBlack layer, improving the contrast ratio and bringing it closer to that of the AMOLED screens.\nAdvanced fringe field switching (AFFS).\nKnown as fringe field switching (FFS) until 2003, advanced fringe field switching is similar to IPS or S-IPS offering superior performance and color gamut with high luminosity. AFFS was developed by Hydis Technologies Co., Ltd, Korea (formally Hyundai Electronics, LCD Task Force). AFFS-applied notebook applications minimize color distortion while maintaining a wider viewing angle for a professional display. Color shift and deviation caused by light leakage is corrected by optimizing the white gamut which also enhances white/gray reproduction. In 2004, Hydis Technologies Co., Ltd licensed AFFS to Japan's Hitachi Displays. Hitachi is using AFFS to manufacture high-end panels. In 2006, HYDIS licensed AFFS to Sanyo Epson Imaging Devices Corporation. Shortly thereafter, Hydis introduced a high-transmittance evolution of the AFFS display, called HFFS (FFS+). Hydis introduced AFFS+ with improved outdoor readability in 2007. AFFS panels are mostly utilized in the cockpits of latest commercial aircraft displays. However, it is no longer produced as of February 2015.\nVertical alignment (VA).\nVertical-alignment displays are a form of LCDs in which the liquid crystals naturally align vertically to the glass substrates. When no voltage is applied, the liquid crystals remain perpendicular to the substrate, creating a black display between crossed polarizers. When voltage is applied, the liquid crystals shift to a tilted position, allowing light to pass through and create a gray-scale display depending on the amount of tilt generated by the electric field. It has a deeper-black background, a higher contrast ratio, a wider viewing angle, and better image quality at extreme temperatures than traditional twisted-nematic displays. Compared to IPS, the black levels are still deeper, allowing for a higher contrast ratio, but the viewing angle is narrower, with color and especially contrast shift being more apparent, and the cost of VA is lower than IPS (but higher than TN).\nBlue phase mode.\nBlue phase mode LCDs have been shown as engineering samples early in 2008, but they are not in mass-production. The physics of blue phase mode LCDs suggest that very short switching times (\u22481 ms) can be achieved, so time sequential color control can possibly be realized and expensive color filters would be obsolete.\nQuality control.\nSome LCD panels have defective transistors, causing permanently lit or unlit pixels which are commonly referred to as stuck pixels or dead pixels respectively. Unlike integrated circuits (ICs), LCD panels with a few defective transistors are usually still usable. Manufacturers' policies for the acceptable number of defective pixels vary greatly. At one point, Samsung held a zero-tolerance policy for LCD monitors sold in Korea. As of 2005,[ [update]] Samsung adheres to the less restrictive ISO 13406-2 standard. Other companies have been known to tolerate as many as 11 dead pixels in their policies.\nDead pixel policies are often hotly debated between manufacturers and customers. To regulate the acceptability of defects and to protect the end user, ISO released the ISO 13406-2 standard, which was made obsolete in 2008 with the release of ISO 9241, specifically ISO-9241-302, 303, 305, 307:2008 pixel defects. However, not every LCD manufacturer conforms to the ISO standard and the ISO standard is quite often interpreted in different ways. LCD panels are more likely to have defects than most ICs due to their larger size.\nMany manufacturers would replace a product even with one defective pixel. Even where such guarantees do not exist, the location of defective pixels is important. A display with only a few defective pixels may be unacceptable if the defective pixels are near each other. LCD panels also commonly have a defect known as \"clouding\", \"dirty screen effect\", or, less commonly, \"mura\", which involves uneven patches of luminance on the panel. It is most visible in dark or black areas of displayed scenes. As of 2010,[ [update]] most premium branded computer LCD panel manufacturers specify their products as having zero defects.\n\"Zero-power\" (bistable) displays.\nThe zenithal bistable device (ZBD), developed by Qinetiq (formerly DERA), can retain an image without power. The crystals may exist in one of two stable orientations (\"black\" and \"white\") and power is only required to change the image. ZBD Displays is a spin-off company from QinetiQ who manufactured both grayscale and color ZBD devices. Kent Displays has also developed a \"no-power\" display that uses polymer stabilized cholesteric liquid crystal (ChLCD). In 2009 Kent demonstrated the use of a ChLCD to cover the entire surface of a mobile phone, allowing it to change colors, and keep that color even when power is removed.\nIn 2004, researchers at the University of Oxford demonstrated two new types of zero-power bistable LCDs based on Zenithal bistable techniques. Several bistable technologies, like the 360\u00b0 BTN and the bistable cholesteric, depend mainly on the bulk properties of the liquid crystal (LC) and use standard strong anchoring, with alignment films and LC mixtures similar to the traditional monostable materials. Other bistable technologies, \"e.g.\", BiNem technology, are based mainly on the surface properties and need specific weak anchoring materials.\nAdvantages and disadvantages.\nSome of these issues relate to full-screen displays, others to small displays as on watches, etc. Many of the comparisons are with CRT displays.\nChemicals used.\nSeveral different families of liquid crystals are used in liquid crystal displays. The molecules used have to be anisotropic, and to exhibit mutual attraction. Polarizable rod-shaped molecules (biphenyls, terphenyls, etc.) are common. A common form is a pair of aromatic benzene rings, with a nonpolar moiety (pentyl, heptyl, octyl, or alkyl oxy group) on one end and polar (nitrile, halogen) on the other. Sometimes the benzene rings are separated with an acetylene group, ethylene, CH=N, CH=NO, N=N, N=NO, or ester group. In practice, eutectic mixtures of several chemicals are used, to achieve wider temperature operating range (\u221210..+60\u00a0\u00b0C for low-end and \u221220..+100\u00a0\u00b0C for high-performance displays). For example, the E7 mixture is composed of three biphenyls and one terphenyl: 39 wt.% of 4'-pentyl[1,1'-biphenyl]-4-carbonitrile (nematic range 24..35\u00a0\u00b0C), 36 wt.% of 4'-heptyl[1,1'-biphenyl]-4-carbonitrile (nematic range 30..43\u00a0\u00b0C), 16 wt.% of 4'-octoxy[1,1'-biphenyl]-4-carbonitrile (nematic range 54..80\u00a0\u00b0C), and 9 wt.% of 4\"-pentyl[1,1':4',1\"-terphenyl]-4-carbonitrile (nematic range 131..240\u00a0\u00b0C).\nEnvironmental impact.\nThe production of LCD screens uses nitrogen trifluoride (NF3) as an etching fluid during the production of the thin-film components. NF3 is a potent greenhouse gas, and its relatively long half-life may make it a potentially harmful contributor to global warming. A report in \"Geophysical Research Letters\" suggested that its effects were theoretically much greater than better-known sources of greenhouse gasses like carbon dioxide. As NF3 was not in widespread use at the time, it was not made part of the Kyoto Protocol and was deemed \"the missing greenhouse gas\". NF3 was added to the Kyoto Protocol for the second compliance period during the Doha Round.\nCritics of the report point out that it assumes that all of the NF3 produced would be released to the atmosphere. In reality, the vast majority of NF3 is broken down during the cleaning processes; two earlier studies found that only 2 to 3% of the gas escapes destruction after its use. Furthermore, the report failed to compare NF3's effects with what it replaced, perfluorocarbon, another powerful greenhouse gas, of which anywhere from 30 to 70% escapes to the atmosphere in typical use.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "17933", "revid": "7903804", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=17933", "title": "Latency (engineering)", "text": "Time interval between an input and a response\nLatency, from a general point of view, is a time delay between the cause and the effect of some physical change in the system being observed. Lag, as it is known in gaming circles, refers to the latency between the input to a simulation and the visual or auditory response, often occurring because of network delay in online games. The original meaning of \u201clatency\u201d, as used widely in psychology, medicine and most other disciplines, derives from \u201clatent\u201d, a word of Latin origin meaning \u201chidden\u201d.\u00a0 Its different and relatively recent meaning (this topic) of \u201clateness\u201d or \u201cdelay\u201d appears to derive from its superficial similarity to the word \u201clate\u201d, from the old English \u201claet\u201d.\nLatency is physically a consequence of the limited velocity at which any physical interaction can propagate. The magnitude of this velocity is always less than or equal to the speed of light. Therefore, every physical system with any physical separation (distance) between cause and effect will experience some sort of latency, regardless of the nature of the stimulation to which it has been exposed.\nThe precise definition of latency depends on the system being observed or the nature of the simulation. In communications, the lower limit of latency is determined by the medium being used to transfer information. In reliable two-way communication systems, latency limits the maximum rate at which information can be transmitted, as there is often a limit on the amount of information that is in-flight at any given moment. Perceptible latency has a strong effect on\u00a0user satisfaction\u00a0and\u00a0usability in the field of human\u2013machine interaction.\nCommunications.\nOnline games are sensitive to latency (lag), since fast response times to new events occurring during a game session are rewarded while slow response times may carry penalties. Due to a delay in transmission of game events, a player with a high-latency internet connection may show slow responses in spite of appropriate reaction time. This gives players with low-latency connections a technical advantage.\nCapital markets.\nJoel Hasbrouck and Gideon Saar (2011) measure latency to execute financial transactions based on three components: the time it takes for information to reach the trader, execution of the trader's algorithms to analyze the information and decide a course of action, and the generated action to reach the exchange and get implemented. Hasbrouck and Saar contrast this with the way in which latencies are measured by many trading venues that use much more narrow definitions, such as the processing delay measured from the entry of the order (at the vendor's computer) to the transmission of an acknowledgment (from the vendor's computer). Trading using computers has developed to the point where millisecond improvements in network speeds offer a competitive advantage for financial institutions.\nPacket-switched networks.\nNetwork latency in a packet-switched network is measured as either one-way (the time from the source sending a packet to the destination receiving it), or round-trip delay time (the one-way latency from the source to the destination plus the one-way latency from the destination back to the source). Round-trip latency is more often quoted, because it can be measured from a single point. Many software platforms provide a service called ping that can be used to measure round-trip latency. Ping uses the Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) \"echo request\" which causes the recipient to send the received packet as an immediate response, thus it provides a rough way of measuring round-trip delay time. Ping cannot perform accurate measurements, principally because ICMP is intended only for diagnostic or control purposes, and differs from real communication protocols such as TCP. Furthermore, routers and internet service providers might apply different traffic shaping policies to different protocols. For more accurate measurements it is better to use specific software, for example: hping, Netperf or Iperf.\nHowever, in a non-trivial network, a typical packet will be forwarded over multiple links and gateways, each of which will not begin to forward the packet until it has been completely received. In such a network, the minimal latency is the sum of the transmission delay of each link, plus the forwarding latency of each gateway. In practice, minimal latency also includes queuing and processing delays. Queuing delay occurs when a gateway receives multiple packets from different sources heading toward the same destination. Since typically only one packet can be transmitted at a time, some of the packets must queue for transmission, incurring additional delay. Processing delays are incurred while a gateway determines what to do with a newly received packet. Bufferbloat can also cause increased latency that is an order of magnitude or more. The combination of propagation, serialization, queuing, and processing delays often produces a complex and variable network latency profile.\nLatency limits total throughput in reliable two-way communication systems as described by the bandwidth-delay product.\nFiber optics.\nLatency in optical fiber is largely a function of the speed of light. This would equate to a latency of 3.33\u00a0\u03bcs for every kilometer of path length. The index of refraction of most fiber optic cables is about 1.5, meaning that light travels about 1.5 times as fast in a vacuum as it does in the cable. This works out to about 5.0\u00a0\u03bcs of latency for every kilometer. In shorter metro networks, higher latency can be experienced due to extra distance in building risers and cross-connects. To calculate the latency of a connection, one has to know the distance traveled by the fiber, which is rarely a straight line, since it has to traverse geographic contours and obstacles, such as roads and railway tracks, as well as other rights-of-way.\nDue to imperfections in the fiber, light degrades as it is transmitted through it. For distances of greater than 100 kilometers, amplifiers or regenerators are deployed. Latency introduced by these components needs to be taken into account.\nSatellite transmission.\nSatellites in geostationary orbits are far enough away from Earth that communication latency becomes significant \u2013 about a quarter of a second for a trip from one ground-based transmitter to the satellite and back to another ground-based transmitter; close to half a second for two-way communication from one Earth station to another and then back to the first. Low Earth orbit is sometimes used to cut this delay, at the expense of more complicated satellite tracking on the ground and requiring more satellites in the satellite constellation to ensure continuous coverage.\nAudio.\nAudio latency is the delay between when an audio signal enters and when it emerges from a system. Potential contributors to latency in an audio system include analog-to-digital conversion, buffering, digital signal processing, transmission time, digital-to-analog conversion and the speed of sound in air.\nVideo.\nVideo latency refers to the degree of delay between the time a transfer of a video stream is requested and the actual time that transfer begins. Networks that exhibit relatively small delays are known as low-latency networks, while their counterparts are known as high-latency networks.\nWorkflow.\nAny individual workflow within a system of workflows can be subject to some type of operational latency. It may even be the case that an individual system may have more than one type of latency, depending on the type of participant or goal-seeking behavior. This is best illustrated by the following two examples involving air travel.\nFrom the point of view of a passenger, latency can be described as follows. Suppose John Doe flies from London to New York. The latency of his trip is the time it takes him to go from his house in England to the hotel he is staying at in New York. This is independent of the throughput of the London-New York air link\u00a0\u2013 whether there were 100 passengers a day making the trip or 10000, the latency of the trip would remain the same.\nFrom the point of view of flight operations personnel, latency can be entirely different. Consider the staff at the London and New York airports. Only a limited number of planes are able to make the transatlantic journey, so when one lands, they must prepare it for the return trip as quickly as possible. It might take, for example:\nAssuming the above are done consecutively, the minimum plane turnaround time is:\n35 + 15 + 10 + 30 = 90\nHowever, cleaning, refueling and loading the cargo can be done at the same time. Passengers can only be loaded after cleaning is complete. The reduced latency, then, is:\n35 + 10 = 45\n15\n30\nMinimum latency = 45\nThe people involved in the turnaround are interested only in the time it takes for their individual tasks. When all of the tasks are done at the same time, however, it is possible to reduce the latency to the length of the longest task. If some steps have prerequisites, it becomes more difficult to perform all steps in parallel. In the example above, the requirement to clean the plane before loading passengers results in a minimum latency longer than any single task.\nMechanics.\nAny mechanical process encounters limitations modeled by Newtonian physics. The behavior of disk drives provides an example of mechanical latency. Here, it is the time seek time for the actuator arm to be positioned above the appropriate track and then rotational latency for the data encoded on a platter to rotate from its current position to a position under the disk read-and-write head.\nComputer hardware and software systems.\nComputers run instructions in the context of a process. In the context of computer multitasking, the execution of the process can be postponed if other processes are also executing. In addition, the operating system can schedule when to perform the action that the process is commanding. For example, suppose a process commands that a computer card's voltage output be set high-low-high-low and so on at a rate of 1000\u00a0Hz. The operating system schedules the process for each transition (high-low or low-high) based on a hardware clock such as the High Precision Event Timer. The latency is the delay between the events generated by the hardware clock and the actual transitions of voltage from high to low or low to high.\nMany desktop operating systems have performance limitations that create additional latency. The problem may be mitigated with real-time extensions and patches such as PREEMPT RT.\nOn embedded systems, the real-time execution of instructions is often supported by a real-time operating system.\nNote that in software systems, benchmarking against \"average\" and \"median\" latency can be misleading because a few outliers can distort them. Instead, software architects and software developers should use \"99th percentile\".\nSimulations.\nIn simulation applications, latency refers to the time delay, often measured in milliseconds, between initial input and output clearly discernible to the simulator trainee or simulator subject. Latency is sometimes also called \"transport delay\". Some authorities distinguish between latency and transport delay by using the term \"latency\" in the sense of the extra time delay of a system over and above the reaction time of the vehicle being simulated, but this requires detailed knowledge of the vehicle dynamics and can be controversial.\nIn simulators with both visual and motion systems, it is particularly important that the latency of the motion system not be greater than of the visual system, or symptoms of simulator sickness may result. This is because, in the real world, motion cues are those of acceleration and are quickly transmitted to the brain, typically in less than 50 milliseconds; this is followed some milliseconds later by a perception of change in the visual scene. The visual scene change is essentially one of change of perspective or displacement of objects such as the horizon, which takes some time to build up to discernible amounts after the initial acceleration that caused the displacement. A simulator should, therefore, reflect the real-world situation by ensuring that the motion latency is equal to or less than that of the visual system and not the other way round.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The period began with the creation of the London Passenger Transport Board, which covered the County of London and adjacent counties within a 30-mile (48-km) radius. This area later came under the control of the London Transport Executive and then the London Transport Board. The area of responsibility was reduced to that of the Greater London administrative area in 1970 when the Greater London Council, and then London Regional Transport took over responsibility.\nSince 2000, the Greater London Authority has been the transport authority and the executive agency has been called Transport for London; ending the 67-year use of the \"London Transport\" name.\nBackground.\nPrior to 1933, the ownership and management of the transport system in London was distributed among a large number of independent and separate organisations. The Underground railway system had been developed and was owned by the Underground Electric Railways Company of London (UERL) and the Metropolitan Railway. Tram and Trolleybus networks were owned by various local authorities and public companies and buses were owned by numerous companies. Many of these services were in competition with one another leading to wasteful duplication. The London County Council managed tram operations within the County of London, but its responsibility did not extend to the bus or tram routes that ran outside its area; or to the railways, which also extended into neighbouring counties. A Royal Commission on London Government in the 1920s did not permit the London County Council to extend its area of responsibility and an ad hoc London Traffic Area was created to regulate motor traffic in the wider London region. In the 1930s another ad hoc solution was sought to improve the control and coordination of public transport.\nLondon's transport authorities.\n1933-1948: London Passenger Transport Board.\nThe London Passenger Transport Board (LPTB) was the transport authority from 1 July 1933 to 31 December 1947. It unified services in the London area for the first time. The London Passenger Transport Act 1933 removed responsibility for of tram route from the London County Council, three county boroughs and a number of other local authorities in the Greater London area. It brought the UERL lines under the same control, and took over supervision of buses from the Metropolitan Police. The area of responsibility of the LPTB was far greater than the current Greater London boundaries and was known as the London Passenger Transport Area. The period saw massive expansion of the tube network and was directly responsible for the expansion of the suburbs. The extensive New Works Programme was halted by World War II, with some projects abandoned and others completed after the end of hostilities. The 'roundel symbol' designed in 1918 was adopted by London Passenger Transport Board and the London Transport brand and architectural style was perfected during this period. The iconic tube map designed in 1931, was published in 1933.\n1948-1963: London Transport Executive.\nThe London Transport Executive (LTE) was the transport authority from 1 January 1948 to 31 December 1962. London Transport was taken into public ownership and became part of the British Transport Commission, which brought London Transport and British Railways under the same control for the first and last time. The period saw the start of direct recruitment from the Caribbean and the repair and replacement of stock and stations damaged during the war as well as completion of delayed projects such as the Central line eastern extension. The AEC Routemaster bus was introduced in 1956. Trams were withdrawn in 1952 and trolleybuses in 1962.\n1963-1970: London Transport Board.\nThe London Transport Board was the transport authority from 1 January 1963 to 31 December 1969 It reported directly to the Minister of Transport, ending its direct association with the management of British Railways. During this period many of Britain's unprofitable railways were closed down, as most routes in the capital were widely used the Beeching Axe had little effect. However, during this period there was little investment in public transport and the motor car increased in popularity. During this period, the Victoria line was opened - although work had started in the early 1960s - and the AEC Merlin single-deck bus was introduced.\n1970-1984: London Transport Executive.\nThe Greater London Council was the transport authority from 1 January 1970 to 28 June 1984 and the executive agency was called the London Transport Executive. The legislation creating the Greater London Council (GLC) was already passed in 1963 when the London Transport Board was created. However, control did not pass to the new authority until 1 January 1970. The GLC broadly controlled only those services within the boundaries of Greater London. The (green painted) country buses and Green Line Coaches had been passed in 1969 to a new company, London Country Bus Services, which in 1970 became part of the National Bus Company. The period is perhaps the most controversial in London's transport history and there was a severe lack of funding from central government and staff shortages.\nThe inter-modal zonal ticketing system currently used by Transport for London originated in this period. Following the Greater London Council election in 1981, the incoming Labour administration simplified fares in Greater London by introducing four new bus fare zones and two central London Underground zones, named \"City\" and \"West End\", where flat fares applied for the first time. This was accompanied by a cut in prices of about a third and was marketed as the \"Fares Fair\" campaign. Following successful legal action against it, on 21 March 1982 London Buses fares were subsequently doubled and London Underground fares increased by 91%. The two central area zones were retained and the fares to all other stations were restructured to be graduated at three-mile intervals. In 1983, a third revision of fares was undertaken, and a new inter-modal Travelcard season ticket was launched covering five new numbered zones; representing an overall cut in prices of around 25%. The \"One Day Travelcard\" was launched in 1984 and on weekdays was only sold for travel after 09.30.\n1984-2000: London Regional Transport.\nLondon Regional Transport was the transport authority from 29 June 1984 to 2 July 2000. The GLC was abolished in 1986 with responsibility for public transport removed two years earlier in 1984. The new authority, London Regional Transport (LRT), again came under direct state control, reporting to the Secretary of State for Transport. The London Regional Transport Act contained provision for setting up subsidiary companies to run the Underground and bus services and in 1985 London Underground Limited (LUL), a wholly owned subsidiary of London Regional Transport, was set up to manage the tube network. In 1988 ten individual line business units were created to manage the network. London Buses Limited was constituted to progress the privatisation of London bus services. London Transport was converted to a route operating contract tendering authority, and the former bus operating interests and assets of London Transport were split into 12 business units under the banner \"London Buses\". The 12 units competed for contracts with private operators from 1984, and were all sold off by 1994/5 becoming private operators themselves.\nFurther amendments to the fare system were made during this period, including inclusion of the separately managed British Rail services. In January 1985 the \"Capitalcard\" season ticket was launched, offering validity on British Rail as well as London Underground and London Buses. It was priced around 10-15% higher than the Travelcard. In June 1986 the \"One Day Capitalcard\" was launched. The Capitalcard brand ended in January 1989 when the Travelcard gained validity on British Rail. In January 1991 Zone 5 was split to create a new Zone 6. The Docklands Light Railway was opened on 31 August 1987 and was included in the zonal Travelcard ticketing scheme.\n2000 onwards: Transport for London.\nThe Greater London Authority, a replacement authority for the GLC, was set up in 2000 with a transport executive called Transport for London (TfL) that took control from 3 July 2000. It is the first London transport authority since 1933 not to be commonly called \"London Transport\". Unlike previous transport bodies, TfL gained responsibility for a wide variety of other transportation functions - including management of major roads in London, walking &amp; cycling as well as taxi and private hire licensing. The London Underground did not pass to TfL until after a Private Finance Initiative (PFI) agreement for maintenance was completed in 2003. In 2017, TfL became the longest running transportation body in London - following London Regional Transport.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "17939", "revid": "48643156", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=17939", "title": "Light", "text": "Electromagnetic radiation humans can see\nLight, visible light, or visible radiation is electromagnetic radiation that can be perceived by the human eye. Visible light spans the visible spectrum and is usually defined as having wavelengths in the range of 400\u2013700 nanometres (nm), corresponding to frequencies of 750\u2013420 terahertz. The visible band sits adjacent to the infrared (with longer wavelengths and lower frequencies) and the ultraviolet (with shorter wavelengths and higher frequencies), called collectively \"optical radiation\".\nIn physics, the term \"light\" may refer more broadly to electromagnetic radiation of any wavelength, whether visible or not. In this sense, gamma rays, X-rays, microwaves and radio waves are also light. The primary properties of light are intensity, propagation direction, frequency or wavelength spectrum, and polarization. Its speed in vacuum, , is one of the fundamental constants of nature. All electromagnetic radiation exhibits some properties of both particles and waves. Single, massless elementary particles, or quanta, of light called \"photons\" can be detected with specialized equipment; phenomena like interference are described by waves. Most everyday interactions with light can be understood using geometrical optics; quantum optics, is an important research area in modern physics.\nThe main source of natural light on Earth is the Sun. Historically, another important source of light for humans has been fire, from ancient campfires to modern kerosene lamps. With the development of electric lights and power systems, electric lighting has effectively replaced firelight.\nElectromagnetic spectrum and visible light.\nGenerally, electromagnetic radiation (EMR) is classified by wavelength into radio waves, microwaves, infrared, the visible spectrum that we perceive as light, ultraviolet, X-rays and gamma rays. The designation \"radiation\" excludes static electric, magnetic and near fields.\nThe behavior of EMR depends on its wavelength. Higher frequencies have shorter wavelengths and lower frequencies have longer wavelengths. When EMR interacts with single atoms and molecules, its behavior depends on the amount of energy per quantum it carries.\nEMR in the visible light region consists of quanta (called photons) that are at the lower end of the energies that are capable of causing electronic excitation within molecules, which leads to changes in the bonding or chemistry of the molecule. At the lower end of the visible light spectrum, EMR becomes invisible to humans (infrared) because its photons no longer have enough individual energy to cause a lasting molecular change (a change in conformation) in the visual molecule retinal in the human retina, which change triggers the sensation of vision.\nThere exist animals that are sensitive to various types of infrared, but not by means of quantum-absorption. Infrared sensing in snakes depends on a kind of natural thermal imaging, in which tiny packets of cellular water are raised in temperature by the infrared radiation. EMR in this range causes molecular vibration and heating effects, which is how these animals detect it.\nAbove the frequency range of visible light, ultraviolet light becomes invisible to humans, mostly because it is absorbed by the cornea with wavelengths shorter than 360 nm and the internal lens at wavelengths shorter than 400\u00a0nm. Furthermore, the rods and cones located in the retina of the human eye cannot detect the very short (shorter than 360\u00a0nm) ultraviolet wavelengths and are in fact damaged by ultraviolet. Many animals with eyes that do not require lenses (such as insects and shrimp) are able to detect ultraviolet, by quantum photon-absorption mechanisms, in much the same chemical way that humans detect visible light.\nVarious sources define visible light as narrowly as 420\u2013680\u00a0nm to as broadly as 380\u2013800\u00a0nm. Under ideal laboratory conditions, people can see infrared up to at least 1,050\u00a0nm; children and young adults may perceive ultraviolet wavelengths down to about 310\u2013313\u00a0nm.\nPlant growth is also affected by the colour spectrum of light, a process known as photomorphogenesis.\nSpeed of light.\nThe speed of light in vacuum is defined to be exactly (approximately 186,282 miles per second). The fixed value of the speed of light in SI units results from the fact that the metre is now defined in terms of the speed of light. All forms of electromagnetic radiation move at exactly this same speed in vacuum.\nDifferent physicists have attempted to measure the speed of light throughout history. Galileo attempted to measure the speed of light in the seventeenth century. An early experiment to measure the speed of light was conducted by Ole R\u00f8mer, a Danish physicist, in 1676. Using a telescope, R\u00f8mer observed the motions of Jupiter and one of its moons, Io. Noting discrepancies in the apparent period of Io's orbit, he calculated that light takes about 22 minutes to traverse the diameter of Earth's orbit. However, its size was not known at that time. If R\u00f8mer had known the diameter of the Earth's orbit, he would have calculated a speed of .\nAnother more accurate measurement of the speed of light was performed in Europe by Hippolyte Fizeau in 1849. Fizeau directed a beam of light at a mirror several kilometers away. A rotating cog wheel was placed in the path of the light beam as it traveled from the source, to the mirror and then returned to its origin. Fizeau found that at a certain rate of rotation, the beam would pass through one gap in the wheel on the way out and the next gap on the way back. Knowing the distance to the mirror, the number of teeth on the wheel and the rate of rotation, Fizeau was able to calculate the speed of light as .\nL\u00e9on Foucault carried out an experiment which used rotating mirrors to obtain a value of in 1862. Albert A. Michelson conducted experiments on the speed of light from 1877 until his death in 1931. He refined Foucault's methods in 1926 using improved rotating mirrors to measure the time it took light to make a round trip from Mount Wilson to Mount San Antonio in California. The precise measurements yielded a speed of .\nThe effective velocity of light in various transparent substances containing ordinary matter, is less than in vacuum. For example, the speed of light in water is about 3/4 of that in vacuum.\nTwo independent teams of physicists were said to bring light to a \"complete standstill\" by passing it through a Bose\u2013Einstein condensate of the element rubidium, one team at Harvard University and the Rowland Institute for Science in Cambridge, Massachusetts and the other at the Harvard\u2013Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, also in Cambridge. However, the popular description of light being \"stopped\" in these experiments refers only to light being stored in the excited states of atoms, then re-emitted at an arbitrary later time, as stimulated by a second laser pulse. During the time it had \"stopped\", it had ceased to be light.\nOptics.\nThe study of light and the interaction of light and matter is termed \"optics\". Optics has different forms appropriate to different circumstances. Geometrical optics, appropriate for understanding things like eyes, lenses, cameras, fiber optics, and mirrors, works well when the wavelength of light is small in comparison to the objects it interacts with. Physical optics incorporates wave properties and is needed understand diffraction and interference. Quantum optics applies when studying individual photons interacting with matter.\nSurface scattering.\nA transparent object allows light to transmit or pass through. Conversely, an opaque object does not allow light to transmit through and instead reflecting or absorbing the light it receives. Most objects do not reflect or transmit light specularly and to some degree scatters the incoming light, which is called glossiness. Surface scattering is caused by the surface roughness of the reflecting surfaces, and internal scattering is caused by the difference of refractive index between the particles and medium inside the object. Like transparent objects, translucent objects allow light to transmit through, but translucent objects also scatter certain wavelength of light via internal scattering.\nRefraction.\nRefraction is the bending of light rays when passing through a surface between one transparent material and another. It is described by Snell's Law:\nformula_1\nwhere \"\u03b8\"1 is the angle between the ray and the surface normal in the first medium, \"\u03b8\"2 is the angle between the ray and the surface normal in the second medium and \"n\"1 and \"n\"2 are the indices of refraction, \"n\" = 1 in a vacuum and \"n\" &gt; 1 in a transparent substance.\nWhen a beam of light crosses the boundary between a vacuum and another medium, or between two different media, the wavelength of the light changes, but the frequency remains constant. If the beam of light is not orthogonal (or rather normal) to the boundary, the change in wavelength results in a change in the direction of the beam. This change of direction is known as refraction.\nThe refractive quality of lenses is frequently used to manipulate light in order to change the apparent size of images. Magnifying glasses, spectacles, contact lenses, microscopes and refracting telescopes are all examples of this manipulation.\nLight sources.\nThere are many sources of light. A body at a given temperature emits a characteristic spectrum of black-body radiation. A simple thermal source is sunlight, the radiation emitted by the chromosphere of the Sun at around . Solar radiation peaks in the visible region of the electromagnetic spectrum when plotted in wavelength units, and roughly 44% of the radiation that reaches the ground is visible. Another example is incandescent light bulbs, which emit only around 10% of their energy as visible light and the remainder as infrared. A common thermal light source in history is the glowing solid particles in flames, but these also emit most of their radiation in the infrared and only a fraction in the visible spectrum.\nThe peak of the black-body spectrum is in the deep infrared, at about 10 micrometre wavelength, for relatively cool objects like human beings. As the temperature increases, the peak shifts to shorter wavelengths, producing first a red glow, then a white one and finally a blue-white colour as the peak moves out of the visible part of the spectrum and into the ultraviolet. These colours can be seen when metal is heated to \"red hot\" or \"white hot\". Blue-white thermal emission is not often seen, except in stars (the commonly seen pure-blue colour in a gas flame or a welder's torch is in fact due to molecular emission, notably by CH radicals emitting a wavelength band around 425\u00a0nm and is not seen in stars or pure thermal radiation).\nAtoms emit and absorb light at characteristic energies. This produces \"emission lines\" in the spectrum of each atom. Emission can be spontaneous, as in light-emitting diodes, gas discharge lamps (such as neon lamps and neon signs, mercury-vapor lamps, etc.) and flames (light from the hot gas itself\u2014so, for example, sodium in a gas flame emits characteristic yellow light). Emission can also be stimulated, as in a laser or a microwave maser.\nDeceleration of a free charged particle, such as an electron, can produce visible radiation: cyclotron radiation, synchrotron radiation and bremsstrahlung radiation are all examples of this. Particles moving through a medium faster than the speed of light in that medium can produce visible Cherenkov radiation. Certain chemicals produce visible radiation by chemoluminescence. In living things, this process is called bioluminescence. For example, fireflies produce light by this means and boats moving through water can disturb plankton which produce a glowing wake.\nCertain substances produce light when they are illuminated by more energetic radiation, a process known as fluorescence. Some substances emit light slowly after excitation by more energetic radiation. This is known as phosphorescence. Phosphorescent materials can also be excited by bombarding them with subatomic particles. Cathodoluminescence is one example. This mechanism is used in cathode-ray tube television sets and computer monitors.\nCertain other mechanisms can produce light:\nWhen the concept of light is intended to include very-high-energy photons (gamma rays), additional generation mechanisms include:\nMeasurement.\nLight is measured with two main alternative sets of units: radiometry consists of measurements of light power at all wavelengths, while photometry measures light with wavelength weighted with respect to a standardized model of human brightness perception. Photometry is useful, for example, to quantify Illumination (lighting) intended for human use.\nThe photometry units are different from most systems of physical units in that they take into account how the human eye responds to light. The cone cells in the human eye are of three types which respond differently across the visible spectrum and the cumulative response peaks at a wavelength of around 555\u00a0nm. Therefore, two sources of light which produce the same intensity (W/m2) of visible light do not necessarily appear equally bright. The photometry units are designed to take this into account and therefore are a better representation of how \"bright\" a light appears to be than raw intensity. They relate to raw power by a quantity called luminous efficacy and are used for purposes like determining how to best achieve sufficient illumination for various tasks in indoor and outdoor settings. The illumination measured by a photocell sensor does not necessarily correspond to what is perceived by the human eye and without filters which may be costly, photocells and charge-coupled devices (CCD) tend to respond to some infrared, ultraviolet or both.\nLight pressure.\nLight exerts physical pressure on objects in its path, a phenomenon which can be deduced by Maxwell's equations, but can be more easily explained by the particle nature of light: photons strike and transfer their momentum. Light pressure is equal to the power of the light beam divided by \"c\", the speed of light. Due to the magnitude of \"c\", the effect of light pressure is negligible for everyday objects. For example, a one-milliwatt laser pointer exerts a force of about 3.3 piconewtons on the object being illuminated; thus, one could lift a U.S. penny with laser pointers, but doing so would require about 30\u00a0billion 1-mW laser pointers. However, in nanometre-scale applications such as nanoelectromechanical systems (NEMS), the effect of light pressure is more significant and exploiting light pressure to drive NEMS mechanisms and to flip nanometre-scale physical switches in integrated circuits is an active area of research. At larger scales, light pressure can cause asteroids to spin faster, acting on their irregular shapes as on the vanes of a windmill. The possibility of making solar sails that would accelerate spaceships in space is also under investigation.\nAlthough the motion of the Crookes radiometer was originally attributed to light pressure, this interpretation is incorrect; the characteristic Crookes rotation is the result of a partial vacuum. This should not be confused with the Nichols radiometer, in which the (slight) motion caused by torque (though not enough for full rotation against friction) \"is\" directly caused by light pressure.\nAs a consequence of light pressure, Einstein in 1909 predicted the existence of \"radiation friction\" which would oppose the movement of matter. He wrote, \"radiation will exert pressure on both sides of the plate. The forces of pressure exerted on the two sides are equal if the plate is at rest. However, if it is in motion, more radiation will be reflected on the surface that is ahead during the motion (front surface) than on the back surface. The backwardacting force of pressure exerted on the front surface is thus larger than the force of pressure acting on the back. Hence, as the resultant of the two forces, there remains a force that counteracts the motion of the plate and that increases with the velocity of the plate. We will call this resultant 'radiation friction' in brief.\"\nUsually light momentum is aligned with its direction of motion. However, for example in evanescent waves momentum is transverse to direction of propagation.\nHistorical theories about light, in chronological order.\nClassical Greece and Hellenism.\nIn the fifth century BC, Empedocles postulated that everything was composed of four elements; fire, air, earth and water. He believed that goddess Aphrodite made the human eye out of the four elements and that she lit the fire in the eye which shone out from the eye making sight possible. If this were true, then one could see during the night just as well as during the day, so Empedocles postulated an interaction between rays from the eyes and rays from a source such as the sun.\nIn about 300 BC, Euclid wrote \"Optica\", in which he studied the properties of light. Euclid postulated that light travelled in straight lines and he described the laws of reflection and studied them mathematically. He questioned that sight is the result of a beam from the eye, for he asks how one sees the stars immediately, if one closes one's eyes, then opens them at night. If the beam from the eye travels infinitely fast this is not a problem.\nIn 55 BC, Lucretius, a Roman who carried on the ideas of earlier Greek atomists, wrote that \"The light &amp; heat of the sun; these are composed of minute atoms which, when they are shoved off, lose no time in shooting right across the interspace of air in the direction imparted by the shove.\" (from \"On the nature of the Universe\"). Despite being similar to later particle theories, Lucretius's views were not generally accepted. Ptolemy (c. second century) wrote about the refraction of light in his book \"Optics\".\nClassical India.\nIn ancient India, the Hindu schools of Samkhya and Vaisheshika, from around the early centuries AD developed theories on light. According to the Samkhya school, light is one of the five fundamental \"subtle\" elements (\"tanmatra\") out of which emerge the gross elements. The atomicity of these elements is not specifically mentioned and it appears that they were actually taken to be continuous.\nThe \"Vishnu Purana\" refers to sunlight as \"the seven rays of the sun\".\nThe Indian Buddhists, such as Dign\u0101ga in the fifth century and Dharmakirti in the seventh century, developed a type of atomism that is a philosophy about reality being composed of atomic entities that are momentary flashes of light or energy. They viewed light as being an atomic entity equivalent to energy.\nDescartes.\nRen\u00e9 Descartes (1596\u20131650) held that light was a mechanical property of the luminous body, rejecting the \"forms\" of Ibn al-Haytham and Witelo as well as the \"species\" of Roger Bacon, Robert Grosseteste and Johannes Kepler. In 1637 he published a theory of the refraction of light that assumed, incorrectly, that light travelled faster in a denser medium than in a less dense medium. Descartes arrived at this conclusion by analogy with the behaviour of sound waves. Although Descartes was incorrect about the relative speeds, he was correct in assuming that light behaved like a wave and in concluding that refraction could be explained by the speed of light in different media.\nDescartes is not the first to use the mechanical analogies but because he clearly asserts that light is only a mechanical property of the luminous body and the transmitting medium, Descartes's theory of light is regarded as the start of modern physical optics.\nParticle theory.\nPierre Gassendi (1592\u20131655), an atomist, proposed a particle theory of light which was published posthumously in the 1660s. Isaac Newton studied Gassendi's work at an early age and preferred his view to Descartes's theory of the \"plenum\". He stated in his \"Hypothesis of Light\" of 1675 that light was composed of corpuscles (particles of matter) which were emitted in all directions from a source. One of Newton's arguments against the wave nature of light was that waves were known to bend around obstacles, while light travelled only in straight lines. He did, however, explain the phenomenon of the diffraction of light (which had been observed by Francesco Grimaldi) by allowing that a light particle could create a localised wave in the aether.\nNewton's theory could be used to predict the reflection of light, but could only explain refraction by incorrectly assuming that light accelerated upon entering a denser medium because the gravitational pull was greater. Newton published the final version of his theory in his \"Opticks\" of 1704. His reputation helped the particle theory of light to hold sway during the eighteenth century. The particle theory of light led Pierre-Simon Laplace to argue that a body could be so massive that light could not escape from it. In other words, it would become what is now called a black hole. Laplace withdrew his suggestion later, after a wave theory of light became firmly established as the model for light (as has been explained, neither a particle or wave theory is fully correct). A translation of Newton's essay on light appears in \"The large scale structure of space-time\", by Stephen Hawking and George F. R. Ellis.\nThe fact that light could be polarized was for the first time qualitatively explained by Newton using the particle theory. \u00c9tienne-Louis Malus in 1810 created a mathematical particle theory of polarization. Jean-Baptiste Biot in 1812 showed that this theory explained all known phenomena of light polarization. At that time the polarization was considered as the proof of the particle theory.\nWave theory.\nTo explain the origin of colours, Robert Hooke (1635\u20131703) developed a \"pulse theory\" and compared the spreading of light to that of waves in water in his 1665 work \"Micrographia\" (\"Observation IX\"). In 1672 Hooke suggested that light's vibrations could be perpendicular to the direction of propagation. Christiaan Huygens (1629\u20131695) worked out a mathematical wave theory of light in 1678 and published it in his \"Treatise on Light\" in 1690. He proposed that light was emitted in all directions as a series of waves in a medium called the luminiferous aether. As waves are not affected by gravity, it was assumed that they slowed down upon entering a denser medium. Another supporter of the wave theory was Leonhard Euler. He argued in \"Nova theoria lucis et colorum\" (1746) that diffraction could more easily be explained by a wave theory.\nThe wave theory predicted that light waves could interfere with each other like sound waves (as noted around 1800 by Thomas Young). Young showed by means of numerous diffraction experiments that light behaved as waves. He first publicly stated his \"general law\" of interference in January 1802, in his book \"A Syllabus of a Course of Lectures on Natural and Experimental Philosophy\":But the general law, by which all these appearances are governed, may be very easily deduced from the interference of two coincident undulations, which either cooperate, or destroy each other, in the same manner as two musical notes produce an alternate intension and remission, in the beating of an imperfect unison.He also proposed that different colours were caused by different wavelengths of light and explained colour vision in terms of three-coloured receptors in the eye.\nIn 1816 Andr\u00e9-Marie Amp\u00e8re gave Augustin-Jean Fresnel an idea that the polarization of light can be explained by the wave theory if light were a transverse wave. Later, Fresnel independently worked out his own wave theory of light and presented it to the Acad\u00e9mie des Sciences in 1817. Sim\u00e9on Denis Poisson challenged Fresnel's model, claiming that it predicted a bright spot in the shadow behind a circular obstacle contrary to common sense. Dominique-Fran\u00e7ois-Jean Arago created an experiment that showed the bright spot: Poisson's challenge became new evidence for the wave theory. In 1818, Young wrote to Arago suggesting that light must be transverse waves, not the longitudinal waves characteristic of sound. Fresnel took up the idea and was able to show via mathematical methods that polarization could be explained by a transverse wave theory of light with no longitudinal vibration.\nThe weakness of the wave theory was that light waves, like sound waves, would need a medium for transmission. The existence of the hypothetical substance luminiferous aether proposed by Huygens in 1678 was cast into strong doubt in the late nineteenth century by the Michelson\u2013Morley experiment.\nNewton's corpuscular theory implied that light would travel faster in a denser medium, while the wave theory of Huygens and others implied the opposite. At that time, the speed of light could not be measured accurately enough to decide which theory was correct. The first to make a sufficiently accurate measurement was L\u00e9on Foucault, in 1850. His result supported the wave theory, and the classical particle theory was finally abandoned (only to partly re-emerge in the twentieth century as photons in quantum theory).\nElectromagnetic theory.\nIn 1845, Michael Faraday discovered that the plane of polarization of linearly polarized light is rotated when the light rays travel along the magnetic field direction in the presence of a transparent dielectric, an effect now known as Faraday rotation. This was the first evidence that light was related to electromagnetism. In 1846 he speculated that light might be some form of disturbance propagating along magnetic field lines. Faraday proposed in 1847 that light was a high-frequency electromagnetic vibration, which could propagate even in the absence of a medium such as the ether.\nFaraday's work inspired James Clerk Maxwell to study electromagnetic radiation and light. Maxwell discovered that self-propagating electromagnetic waves would travel through space at a constant speed, which happened to be equal to the previously measured speed of light. From this, Maxwell concluded that light was a form of electromagnetic radiation: he first stated this result in 1862 in \"On Physical Lines of Force\". In 1873, he published \"A Treatise on Electricity and Magnetism\", which contained a full mathematical description of the behavior of electric and magnetic fields, still known as Maxwell's equations. Soon after, Heinrich Hertz confirmed Maxwell's theory experimentally by generating and detecting radio waves in the laboratory and demonstrating that these waves behaved exactly like visible light, exhibiting properties such as reflection, refraction, diffraction and interference. Maxwell's theory and Hertz's experiments led directly to the development of modern radio, radar, television, electromagnetic imaging and wireless communications.\nIn the quantum theory, photons are seen as wave packets of the waves described in the classical theory of Maxwell. The quantum theory was needed to explain effects even with visual light that Maxwell's classical theory could not (such as spectral lines).\nQuantum theory.\nIn 1900 Max Planck, attempting to explain black-body radiation, suggested that although light was a wave, these waves could gain or lose energy only in finite amounts related to their frequency. Planck called these \"lumps\" of light energy \"quanta\" (from a Latin word for \"how much\"). In 1905, Albert Einstein used the idea of light quanta to explain the photoelectric effect and suggested that these light quanta had a \"real\" existence. In 1923 Arthur Holly Compton showed that the wavelength shift seen when low intensity X-rays scattered from electrons (so called Compton scattering) could be explained by a particle-theory of X-rays, but not a wave theory. In 1926 Gilbert N. Lewis named these light quanta particles photons.\nEventually quantum mechanics came to picture light as (in some sense) \"both\" a particle and a wave, and (in another sense) as a phenomenon which is \"neither\" a particle nor a wave (which actually are macroscopic phenomena, such as baseballs or ocean waves). Instead, under some approximations light can be described sometimes with mathematics appropriate to one type of macroscopic metaphor (particles) and sometimes another macroscopic metaphor (waves).\nAs in the case for radio waves and the X-rays involved in Compton scattering, physicists have noted that electromagnetic radiation tends to behave more like a classical wave at lower frequencies, but more like a classical particle at higher frequencies, but never completely loses all qualities of one or the other. Visible light, which occupies a middle ground in frequency, can easily be shown in experiments to be describable using either a wave or particle model, or sometimes both.\nIn 1924\u20131925, Satyendra Nath Bose showed that light followed different statistics from that of classical particles. With Einstein, they generalized this result for a whole set of integer spin particles called bosons (after Bose) that follow Bose\u2013Einstein statistics. The photon is a massless boson of spin 1.\nIn 1927, Paul Dirac quantized the electromagnetic field. Pascual Jordan and Vladimir Fock generalized this process to treat many-body systems as excitations of quantum fields, a process with the misnomer of second quantization. And at the end of the 1940s a full theory of quantum electrodynamics was developed using quantum fields based on the works of Julian Schwinger, Richard Feynman, Freeman Dyson, and Shinichiro Tomonaga.\nQuantum optics.\nJohn R. Klauder, George Sudarshan, Roy J. Glauber, and Leonard Mandel applied quantum theory to the electromagnetic field in the 1950s and 1960s to gain a more detailed understanding of photodetection and the statistics of light (see degree of coherence). This led to the introduction of the coherent state as a concept which addressed variations between laser light, thermal light, exotic squeezed states, etc. as it became understood that light cannot be fully described just referring to the electromagnetic fields describing the waves in the classical picture. In 1977, H. Jeff Kimble et al. demonstrated a single atom emitting one photon at a time, further compelling evidence that light consists of photons. Previously unknown quantum states of light with characteristics unlike classical states, such as squeezed light were subsequently discovered.\nDevelopment of short and ultrashort laser pulses\u2014created by Q switching and modelocking techniques\u2014opened the way to the study of what became known as ultrafast processes. Applications for solid state research (e.g. Raman spectroscopy) were found, and mechanical forces of light on matter were studied. The latter led to levitating and positioning clouds of atoms or even small biological samples in an optical trap or optical tweezers by laser beam. This, along with Doppler cooling and Sisyphus cooling, was the crucial technology needed to achieve the celebrated Bose\u2013Einstein condensation.\nOther remarkable results are the demonstration of quantum entanglement, quantum teleportation, and quantum logic gates. The latter are of much interest in quantum information theory, a subject which partly emerged from quantum optics, partly from theoretical computer science.\nUse for light on Earth.\nSunlight provides the energy that green plants use to create sugars mostly in the form of starches, which release energy into the living things that digest them. This process of photosynthesis provides virtually all the energy used by living things. Some species of animals generate their own light, a process called bioluminescence. For example, fireflies use light to locate mates and vampire squid use it to hide themselves from prey.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "17940", "revid": "50865928", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=17940", "title": "Lipid", "text": "Substance of biological origin that is soluble in nonpolar solvents\nLipids are a broad group of organic compounds that include fats, waxes, sterols, fat-soluble vitamins (such as vitamins A, D, E and K), monoglycerides, diglycerides, phospholipids, and others. The functions of lipids include storing energy, signaling, and acting as structural components of cell membranes. Lipids have applications in the cosmetic and food industries, and in nanotechnology.\nLipids are broadly defined as hydrophobic or amphiphilic small molecules; the amphiphilic nature of some lipids allows them to form structures such as vesicles, multilamellar/unilamellar liposomes, or membranes in an aqueous environment. Biological lipids originate entirely or in part from two distinct types of biochemical subunits or \"building-blocks\": ketoacyl and isoprene groups. Using this approach, lipids may be divided into eight categories: fatty acyls, glycerolipids, glycerophospholipids, sphingolipids, saccharolipids, and polyketides (derived from condensation of ketoacyl subunits); and sterol lipids and prenol lipids (derived from condensation of isoprene subunits).\nAlthough the term \"lipid\" is sometimes used as a synonym for fats, fats are a subgroup of lipids called triglycerides. Lipids also encompass molecules such as fatty acids and their derivatives (including tri-, di-, and monoglycerides, and phospholipids), as well as other sterol-containing metabolites such as cholesterol. Although humans and other mammals use various biosynthetic pathways both to break down and to synthesize lipids, some essential lipids cannot be made this way and must be obtained from the diet.\nHistory.\nIn 1815, Henri Braconnot classified lipids (\"graisses\") into two categories, \"suifs\" (solid greases or tallow) and \"huiles\" (fluid oils). In 1823, Michel Eug\u00e8ne Chevreul developed a more detailed classification, including oils, greases, tallow, waxes, resins, balsams and volatile oils (or essential oils).\nIn 1827, William Prout recognized fat (\"oily\" alimentary matters), along with protein (\"albuminous\") and carbohydrate (\"saccharine\"), as an important nutrient for humans and animals.\nThe first synthetic triglyceride was reported by Th\u00e9ophile-Jules Pelouze in 1844, when he produced tributyrin by treating butyric acid with glycerin in the presence of concentrated sulfuric acid. Several years later, Marcellin Berthelot, one of Pelouze's students, synthesized tristearin and tripalmitin by reaction of the analogous fatty acids with glycerin in the presence of gaseous hydrogen chloride at high temperature.\nFor a century, chemists regarded \"fats\" as only simple lipids made of fatty acids and glycerol (glycerides), but new forms were described later. Theodore Gobley (1847) discovered phospholipids in mammalian brain and hen egg, called by him as \"lecithins\". Thudichum discovered in the human brain some phospholipids (cephalin), glycolipids (cerebroside) and sphingolipids (sphingomyelin).\nThe terms lipoid, lipin, lipide and lipid have been used with varied meanings from author to author. In 1912, Rosenbloom and Gies proposed the substitution of \"lipoid\" by \"lipin\". In 1920, Bloor introduced a new classification for \"lipoids\": simple lipoids (greases and waxes), compound lipoids (phospholipoids and glycolipoids), and the derived lipoids (fatty acids, alcohols, sterols).\nThe word \"lipide\", which stems etymologically from Greek \u03bb\u03af\u03c0\u03bf\u03c2, \"lipos\" 'fat', was introduced in 1923 by the French pharmacologist Gabriel Bertrand. Bertrand included in the concept not only the traditional fats (glycerides), but also the \"lipoids\", with a complex constitution. The word \"lipide\" was unanimously approved by the international commission of the \"Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de Chimie Biologique\" during the plenary session on July 3, 1923. The word \"lipide\" was later anglicized as \"lipid\" because of its pronunciation ('l\u026ap\u026ad). In French, the suffix \"-ide\", from Ancient Greek -\u03af\u03b4\u03b7\u03c2 (meaning 'son of' or 'descendant of'), is always pronounced (\u026ad).\nIn 1947, defined \"simple lipids\" as greases and waxes (true waxes, sterols, alcohols).\nCategories.\nLipids have been classified into eight categories by the Lipid MAPS consortium as follows:\nFatty acyls.\nFatty acyls, a generic term for describing fatty acids, their conjugates and derivatives, are a diverse group of molecules synthesized by chain-elongation of an acetyl-CoA primer with malonyl-CoA or methylmalonyl-CoA groups in a process called fatty acid synthesis. They are made of a hydrocarbon chain that terminates with a carboxylic acid group; this arrangement confers the molecule with a polar, hydrophilic end, and a nonpolar, hydrophobic end that is insoluble in water. The fatty acid structure is one of the most fundamental categories of biological lipids and is commonly used as a building-block of more structurally complex lipids. The carbon chain, typically between four and 24 carbons long, may be saturated or unsaturated, and may be attached to functional groups containing oxygen, halogens, nitrogen, and sulfur. If a fatty acid contains a double bond, there is the possibility of either a \"cis\" or \"trans\" geometric isomerism, which significantly affects the molecule's configuration. \"Cis\"-double bonds cause the fatty acid chain to bend, an effect that is compounded with more double bonds in the chain. Three double bonds in 18-carbon \"linolenic acid\", the most abundant fatty-acyl chains of plant \"thylakoid membranes\", render these membranes highly \"fluid\" despite environmental low-temperatures, and also makes linolenic acid give dominating sharp peaks in high resolution 13-C NMR spectra of chloroplasts. This in turn plays an important role in the structure and function of cell membranes. Most naturally occurring fatty acids are of the \"cis\" configuration, although the \"trans\" form does exist in some natural and partially hydrogenated fats and oils.\nExamples of biologically important fatty acids include the eicosanoids, derived primarily from arachidonic acid and eicosapentaenoic acid, that include prostaglandins, leukotrienes, and thromboxanes. Docosahexaenoic acid is also important in biological systems, particularly with respect to sight. Other major lipid classes in the fatty acid category are the fatty esters and fatty amides. Fatty esters include important biochemical intermediates such as wax esters, fatty acid thioester coenzyme A derivatives, fatty acid thioester ACP derivatives and fatty acid carnitines. The fatty amides include N-acyl ethanolamines, such as the cannabinoid neurotransmitter anandamide.\nGlycerolipids.\nGlycerolipids are composed of mono-, di-, and tri-substituted glycerols, the best-known being the fatty acid triesters of glycerol, called triglycerides. The word \"triacylglycerol\" is sometimes used synonymously with \"triglyceride\". In these compounds, the three hydroxyl groups of glycerol are each esterified, typically by different fatty acids. Because they function as an energy store, these lipids comprise the bulk of storage fat in animal tissues. The hydrolysis of the ester bonds of triglycerides and the release of glycerol and fatty acids from adipose tissue are the initial steps in metabolizing fat.\nAdditional subclasses of glycerolipids are represented by glycosylglycerols, which are characterized by the presence of one or more sugar residues attached to glycerol via a glycosidic linkage. Examples of structures in this category are the digalactosyldiacylglycerols found in plant membranes and seminolipid from mammalian sperm cells.\nGlycerophospholipids.\nGlycerophospholipids, usually referred to as phospholipids (though sphingomyelins are also classified as phospholipids), are ubiquitous in nature and are key components of the lipid bilayer of cells, as well as being involved in metabolism and cell signaling. Neural tissue (including the brain) contains relatively high amounts of glycerophospholipids, and alterations in their composition has been implicated in various neurological disorders. Glycerophospholipids may be subdivided into distinct classes, based on the nature of the polar headgroup at the \"sn\"-3 position of the glycerol backbone in eukaryotes and eubacteria, or the \"sn\"-1 position in the case of archaebacteria.\nExamples of glycerophospholipids found in biological membranes are phosphatidylcholine (also known as PC, GPCho or lecithin), phosphatidylethanolamine (PE or GPEtn) and phosphatidylserine (PS or GPSer). In addition to serving as a primary component of cellular membranes and binding sites for intra- and intercellular proteins, some glycerophospholipids in eukaryotic cells, such as phosphatidylinositols and phosphatidic acids are either precursors of or, themselves, membrane-derived second messengers. Typically, one or both of these hydroxyl groups are acylated with long-chain fatty acids, but there are also alkyl-linked and 1Z-alkenyl-linked (plasmalogen) glycerophospholipids, as well as dialkylether variants in archaebacteria.\nSphingolipids.\nSphingolipids are a complicated family of compounds that share a common structural feature, a sphingoid base backbone that is synthesized \"de novo\" from the amino acid serine and a long-chain fatty acyl CoA, then converted into ceramides, phosphosphingolipids, glycosphingolipids and other compounds. The major sphingoid base of mammals is commonly referred to as sphingosine. Ceramides (N-acyl-sphingoid bases) are a major subclass of sphingoid base derivatives with an amide-linked fatty acid. The fatty acids are typically saturated or mono-unsaturated with chain lengths from 16 to 26 carbon atoms.\nThe major phosphosphingolipids of mammals are sphingomyelins (ceramide phosphocholines), whereas insects contain mainly ceramide phosphoethanolamines and fungi have phytoceramide phosphoinositols and mannose-containing headgroups. The glycosphingolipids are a diverse family of molecules composed of one or more sugar residues linked via a glycosidic bond to the sphingoid base. Examples of these are the simple and complex glycosphingolipids such as cerebrosides and gangliosides.\nSterols.\nSterols, such as cholesterol and its derivatives, are an important component of membrane lipids, along with the glycerophospholipids and sphingomyelins. Other examples of sterols are the bile acids and their conjugates, which in mammals are oxidized derivatives of cholesterol and are synthesized in the liver. The plant equivalents are the phytosterols, such as \u03b2-sitosterol, stigmasterol, and brassicasterol; the latter compound is also used as a biomarker for algal growth. The predominant sterol in fungal cell membranes is ergosterol.\nSterols are steroids in which one of the hydrogen atoms is substituted with a hydroxyl group, at position 3 in the carbon chain. They have in common with steroids the same fused four-ring core structure. Steroids have different biological roles as hormones and signaling molecules. The eighteen-carbon (C18) steroids include the estrogen family whereas the C19 steroids comprise the androgens such as testosterone and androsterone. The C21 subclass includes the progestogens as well as the glucocorticoids and mineralocorticoids. The secosteroids, comprising various forms of vitamin D, are characterized by cleavage of the B ring of the core structure.\nPrenols.\nPrenol lipids are synthesized from the five-carbon-unit precursors isopentenyl diphosphate and dimethylallyl diphosphate, which are produced mainly via the mevalonic acid (MVA) pathway. The simple isoprenoids (linear alcohols, diphosphates, etc.) are formed by the successive addition of C5 units, and are classified according to number of these terpene units. Structures containing greater than 40 carbons are known as polyterpenes. Carotenoids are important simple isoprenoids that function as antioxidants and as precursors of vitamin A. Another biologically important class of molecules is exemplified by the quinones and hydroquinones, which contain an isoprenoid tail attached to a quinonoid core of non-isoprenoid origin. Vitamin E and vitamin K, as well as the ubiquinones, are examples of this class. Prokaryotes synthesize polyprenols (called bactoprenols) in which the terminal isoprenoid unit attached to oxygen remains unsaturated, whereas in animal polyprenols (dolichols) the terminal isoprenoid is reduced.\nSaccharolipids.\nSaccharolipids describe compounds in which fatty acids are linked to a sugar backbone, forming structures that are compatible with membrane bilayers. In the saccharolipids, a monosaccharide substitutes for the glycerol backbone present in glycerolipids and glycerophospholipids. The most familiar saccharolipids are the acylated glucosamine precursors of the Lipid\u00a0A component of the lipopolysaccharides in Gram-negative bacteria. Typical lipid\u00a0A molecules are disaccharides of glucosamine, which are derivatized with as many as seven fatty-acyl chains. The minimal lipopolysaccharide required for growth in \"E. coli\" is Kdo2-Lipid A, a hexa-acylated disaccharide of glucosamine that is glycosylated with two 3-deoxy-D-manno-octulosonic acid (Kdo) residues.\nPolyketides.\nPolyketides are synthesized by polymerization of acetyl and propionyl subunits by classic enzymes as well as iterative and multimodular enzymes that share mechanistic features with the fatty acid synthases. They comprise many secondary metabolites and natural products from animal, plant, bacterial, fungal and marine sources, and have great structural diversity. Many polyketides are cyclic molecules whose backbones are often further modified by glycosylation, methylation, hydroxylation, oxidation, or other processes. Many commonly used antimicrobial, antiparasitic, and anticancer agents are polyketides or polyketide derivatives, such as erythromycins, tetracyclines, avermectins, and antitumor epothilones.\nBiological functions.\nComponent of biological membranes.\nEukaryotic cells feature the compartmentalized membrane-bound organelles that carry out different biological functions. The glycerophospholipids are the main structural component of biological membranes, as the cellular plasma membrane and the intracellular membranes of organelles; in animal cells, the plasma membrane physically separates the intracellular components from the extracellular environment. The glycerophospholipids are amphipathic molecules (containing both hydrophobic and hydrophilic regions) that contain a glycerol core linked to two fatty acid-derived \"tails\" by ester linkages and to one \"head\" group by a phosphate ester linkage. While glycerophospholipids are the major component of biological membranes, other non-glyceride lipid components such as sphingomyelin and sterols (mainly cholesterol in animal cell membranes) are also found in biological membranes. In plants and algae, the galactosyldiacylglycerols, and sulfoquinovosyldiacylglycerol, which lack a phosphate group, are important components of membranes of chloroplasts and related organelles and are among the most abundant lipids in photosynthetic tissues, including those of higher plants, algae and certain bacteria.\nPlant thylakoid membranes have the largest lipid component of a non-bilayer forming monogalactosyl diglyceride (MGDG), and little phospholipids; despite this unique lipid composition, chloroplast thylakoid membranes have been shown to contain a dynamic lipid-bilayer matrix as revealed by magnetic resonance and electron microscope studies.\nA biological membrane is a form of lamellar phase lipid bilayer. The formation of lipid bilayers is an energetically preferred process when the glycerophospholipids described above are in an aqueous environment. This is known as the hydrophobic effect. In an aqueous system, the polar heads of lipids align towards the polar, aqueous environment, while the hydrophobic tails minimize their contact with water and tend to cluster together, forming a vesicle; depending on the concentration of the lipid, this biophysical interaction may result in the formation of micelles, liposomes, or lipid bilayers. Other aggregations are also observed and form part of the polymorphism of amphiphile (lipid) behavior. Phase behavior is an area of study within biophysics. Micelles and bilayers form in the polar medium by a process known as the hydrophobic effect. When dissolving a lipophilic or amphiphilic substance in a polar environment, the polar molecules (i.e., water in an aqueous solution) become more ordered around the dissolved lipophilic substance, since the polar molecules cannot form hydrogen bonds to the lipophilic areas of the amphiphile. So in an aqueous environment, the water molecules form an ordered \"clathrate\" cage around the dissolved lipophilic molecule.\nThe formation of lipids into protocell membranes represents a key step in models of abiogenesis, the origin of life.\nEnergy storage.\nTriglycerides, stored in adipose tissue, are a major form of energy storage both in animals and plants. They are a major source of energy in aerobic respiration. The complete oxidation of fatty acids releases about 38\u00a0kJ/g (9\u00a0kcal/g), compared with only 17\u00a0kJ/g (4\u00a0kcal/g) for the oxidative breakdown of carbohydrates and proteins. The adipocyte, or fat cell, is designed for continuous synthesis and breakdown of triglycerides in animals, with breakdown controlled mainly by the activation of hormone-sensitive enzyme lipase. Migratory birds that must fly long distances without eating use triglycerides to fuel their flights.\nSignaling.\nEvidence has emerged showing that lipid signaling is a vital part of the cell signaling. Lipid signaling may occur via activation of G protein-coupled or nuclear receptors, and members of several different lipid categories have been identified as signaling molecules and cellular messengers. These include sphingosine-1-phosphate, a sphingolipid derived from ceramide that is a potent messenger molecule involved in regulating calcium mobilization, cell growth, and apoptosis; diacylglycerol and the phosphatidylinositol phosphates (PIPs), involved in calcium-mediated activation of protein kinase C; the prostaglandins, which are one type of fatty-acid derived eicosanoid involved in inflammation and immunity; the steroid hormones such as estrogen, testosterone and cortisol, which modulate a host of functions such as reproduction, metabolism and blood pressure; and the oxysterols such as 25-hydroxy-cholesterol that are liver X receptor agonists. Phosphatidylserine lipids are known to be involved in signaling for the phagocytosis of apoptotic cells or pieces of cells. They accomplish this by being exposed to the extracellular face of the cell membrane after the inactivation of flippases which place them exclusively on the cytosolic side and the activation of scramblases, which scramble the orientation of the phospholipids. After this occurs, other cells recognize the phosphatidylserines and phagocytosize the cells or cell fragments exposing them.\nOther functions.\nThe \"fat-soluble\" vitamins (A, D, E and K)\u00a0\u2013 which are isoprene-based lipids\u00a0\u2013 are essential nutrients stored in the liver and fatty tissues, with a diverse range of functions. Acyl-carnitines are involved in the transport and metabolism of fatty acids in and out of mitochondria, where they undergo beta oxidation. Polyprenols and their phosphorylated derivatives also play important transport roles, in this case the transport of oligosaccharides across membranes. Polyprenol phosphate sugars and polyprenol diphosphate sugars function in extra-cytoplasmic glycosylation reactions, in extracellular polysaccharide biosynthesis (for instance, peptidoglycan polymerization in bacteria), and in eukaryotic protein N-glycosylation. Cardiolipins are a subclass of glycerophospholipids containing four acyl chains and three glycerol groups that are particularly abundant in the inner mitochondrial membrane. They are believed to activate enzymes involved with oxidative phosphorylation. Lipids also form the basis of steroid hormones.\nMetabolism.\nThe major dietary lipids for humans and other animals are animal and plant triglycerides, sterols, and membrane phospholipids. The process of lipid metabolism synthesizes and degrades the lipid stores and produces the structural and functional lipids characteristic of individual tissues.\nBiosynthesis.\nIn animals, when there is an oversupply of dietary carbohydrate, the excess carbohydrate is converted to triglycerides. This involves the synthesis of fatty acids from acetyl-CoA and the esterification of fatty acids in the production of triglycerides, a process called lipogenesis. Fatty acids are made by fatty acid synthases that polymerize and then reduce acetyl-CoA units. The acyl chains in the fatty acids are extended by a cycle of reactions that add the acetyl group, reduce it to an alcohol, dehydrate it to an alkene group and then reduce it again to an alkane group. The enzymes of fatty acid biosynthesis are divided into two groups, in animals and fungi all these fatty acid synthase reactions are carried out by a single multifunctional protein, while in plant plastids and bacteria separate enzymes perform each step in the pathway. The fatty acids may be subsequently converted to triglycerides that are packaged in lipoproteins and secreted from the liver.\nThe synthesis of unsaturated fatty acids involves a desaturation reaction, whereby a double bond is introduced into the fatty acyl chain. For example, in humans, the desaturation of stearic acid by stearoyl-CoA desaturase-1 produces oleic acid. The doubly unsaturated fatty acid linoleic acid as well as the triply unsaturated \u03b1-linolenic acid cannot be synthesized in mammalian tissues, and are therefore essential fatty acids and must be obtained from the diet.\nTriglyceride synthesis takes place in the endoplasmic reticulum by metabolic pathways in which acyl groups in fatty acyl-CoAs are transferred to the hydroxyl groups of glycerol-3-phosphate and diacylglycerol.\nTerpenes and isoprenoids, including the carotenoids, are made by the assembly and modification of isoprene units donated from the reactive precursors isopentenyl pyrophosphate and dimethylallyl pyrophosphate. These precursors can be made in different ways. In animals and archaea, the mevalonate pathway produces these compounds from acetyl-CoA, while in plants and bacteria the non-mevalonate pathway uses pyruvate and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate as substrates. One important reaction that uses these activated isoprene donors is steroid biosynthesis. Here, the isoprene units are joined together to make squalene and then folded up and formed into a set of rings to make lanosterol. Lanosterol can then be converted into other steroids such as cholesterol and ergosterol.\nDegradation.\nBeta oxidation is the metabolic process by which fatty acids are broken down in the mitochondria or in peroxisomes to generate acetyl-CoA. For the most part, fatty acids are oxidized by a mechanism that is similar to, but not identical with, a reversal of the process of fatty acid synthesis. That is, two-carbon fragments are removed sequentially from the carboxyl end of the acid after steps of dehydrogenation, hydration, and oxidation to form a beta-keto acid, which is split by thiolysis. The acetyl-CoA is then ultimately converted into adenosine triphosphate (ATP), CO2, and H2O using the citric acid cycle and the electron transport chain. Hence the citric acid cycle can start at acetyl-CoA when fat is being broken down for energy if there is little or no glucose available. The energy yield of the complete oxidation of the fatty acid palmitate is 106 ATP. Unsaturated and odd-chain fatty acids require additional enzymatic steps for degradation.\nNutrition and health.\nMost of the fat found in food is in the form of triglycerides, cholesterol, and phospholipids. Some dietary fat is necessary to facilitate absorption of fat-soluble vitamins (A, D, E, and K) and carotenoids. Humans and other mammals have a dietary requirement for certain essential fatty acids, such as linoleic acid (an omega-6 fatty acid) and alpha-linolenic acid (an omega-3 fatty acid) because they cannot be synthesized from simple precursors in the diet. Both of these fatty acids are 18-carbon polyunsaturated fatty acids differing in the number and position of the double bonds. Most vegetable oils are rich in linoleic acid (safflower, sunflower, and corn oils). Alpha-linolenic acid is found in the green leaves of plants and in some seeds, nuts, and legumes (in particular flax, rapeseed, walnut, and soy). Fish oils are particularly rich in the longer-chain omega-3 fatty acids eicosapentaenoic acid and docosahexaenoic acid. Many studies have shown positive health benefits associated with consumption of omega-3 fatty acids on infant development, cancer, cardiovascular diseases, and various mental illnesses (such as depression, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, and dementia).\nIn contrast, it is now well-established that consumption of trans fats, such as those present in partially hydrogenated vegetable oils, are a risk factor for cardiovascular disease. Fats that are good for one may be turned into trans fats by improper cooking methods that result in overcooking the lipids.\nResults from recent clinical trials have linked long-term variation in lipids, including LDL and triglycerides, with risk of cardiovascular disease, diabetes, or heart failure. Excessive lipid variability has been linked to oxidative stress and endothelial dysfunction.\nA few studies have suggested that total dietary fat intake is linked to an increased risk of obesity and diabetes. Others, including the Women's Health Initiative Dietary Modification Trial, an eight-year study of 49,000 women, the Nurses' Health Study, and the Health Professionals Follow-up Study, revealed no such links. None of these studies suggested any connection between percentage of calories from fat and risk of cancer, heart disease, or weight gain. The Nutrition Source, a website maintained by the department of nutrition at the T. H. Chan School of Public Health at Harvard University, summarizes the current evidence on the effect of dietary fat: \"Detailed research\u2014much of it done at Harvard\u2014shows that the total amount of fat in the diet isn't really linked with weight or disease.\"\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nExternal links.\nIntroductory\nNomenclature\nDatabases\nGeneral"}

In other words, a Lie algebra is an algebra over a field for which the multiplication operation (called the Lie bracket) is alternating and satisfies the Jacobi identity. The Lie bracket of two vectors formula_3 and formula_4 is denoted formula_5. A Lie algebra is typically a non-associative algebra. However, every associative algebra gives rise to a Lie algebra, consisting of the same vector space with the commutator Lie bracket, formula_6.\nLie algebras are closely related to Lie groups, which are groups that are also smooth manifolds: every Lie group gives rise to a Lie algebra, which is the tangent space at the identity. (In this case, the Lie bracket measures the failure of commutativity for the Lie group.) Conversely, to any finite-dimensional Lie algebra over the real or complex numbers, there is a corresponding connected Lie group, unique up to covering spaces (Lie's third theorem). This correspondence allows one to study the structure and classification of Lie groups in terms of Lie algebras, which are simpler objects of linear algebra.\nIn more detail: for any Lie group, the multiplication operation near the identity element 1 is commutative to first order. In other words, every Lie group \"G\" is (to first order) approximately a real vector space, namely the tangent space formula_7 to \"G\" at the identity. To second order, the group operation may be non-commutative, and the second-order terms describing the non-commutativity of \"G\" near the identity give formula_7 the structure of a Lie algebra. It is a remarkable fact that these second-order terms (the Lie algebra) completely determine the group structure of \"G\" near the identity. They even determine \"G\" globally, up to covering spaces.\nIn physics, Lie groups appear as symmetry groups of physical systems, and their Lie algebras (tangent vectors near the identity) may be thought of as infinitesimal symmetry motions. Thus Lie algebras and their representations are used extensively in physics, notably in quantum mechanics and particle physics.\nAn elementary example (not directly coming from an associative algebra) is the 3-dimensional space formula_9 with Lie bracket defined by the cross product formula_10 This is skew-symmetric since formula_11, and instead of associativity it satisfies the Jacobi identity:\nformula_12\nThis is the Lie algebra of the Lie group of rotations of space, and each vector formula_13 may be pictured as an infinitesimal rotation around the axis formula_14, with angular speed equal to the magnitude\nof formula_14. The Lie bracket is a measure of the non-commutativity between two rotations. Since a rotation commutes with itself, one has the alternating property formula_16.\nA fundamental example of a Lie algebra is the space of all linear maps from a vector space to itself, as discussed below. When the vector space has dimension \"n\", this Lie algebra is called the general linear Lie algebra, formula_17. Equivalently, this is the space of all formula_18 matrices. The Lie bracket is defined to be the commutator of matrices (or linear maps), formula_19.\nHistory.\nLie algebras were introduced to study the concept of infinitesimal transformations by Sophus Lie in the 1870s, and independently discovered by Wilhelm Killing in the 1880s. The name \"Lie algebra\" was given by Hermann Weyl in the 1930s; in older texts, the term \"infinitesimal group\" was used.\nDefinition of a Lie algebra.\nA Lie algebra is a vector space formula_20 over a field formula_21 together with a binary operation formula_22 called the Lie bracket, satisfying the following axioms:\nformula_23\nformula_24\nfor all scalars formula_25 in formula_21 and all elements formula_27 in formula_7.\nformula_29\nfor all formula_3 in formula_7.\n formula_32\nfor all formula_27 in formula_7.\nGiven a Lie group, the Jacobi identity for its Lie algebra follows from the associativity of the group operation.\nUsing bilinearity to expand the Lie bracket formula_35 and using the alternating property shows that formula_36 for all formula_37 in formula_7. Thus bilinearity and the alternating property together imply\n formula_39\nfor all formula_37 in formula_7. If the field does not have characteristic 2, then anticommutativity implies the alternating property, since it implies formula_42\n formula_44\nfor all formula_27 in formula_7. \nIt is customary to denote a Lie algebra by a lower-case fraktur letter such as formula_47. If a Lie algebra is associated with a Lie group, then the algebra is denoted by the fraktur version of the group's name: for example, the Lie algebra of SU(\"n\") is formula_48.\nGenerators and dimension.\nThe \"dimension\" of a Lie algebra over a field means its dimension as a vector space. In physics, a vector space basis of the Lie algebra of a Lie group \"G\" may be called a set of \"generators\" for \"G\". (They are \"infinitesimal generators\" for \"G\", so to speak.) In mathematics, a set \"S\" of \"generators\" for a Lie algebra formula_7 means a subset of formula_7 such that any Lie subalgebra (as defined below) that contains \"S\" must be all of formula_7. Equivalently, formula_7 is spanned (as a vector space) by all iterated brackets of elements of \"S\".\nBasic examples.\nAbelian Lie algebras.\nA Lie algebra is called abelian if its Lie bracket is identically zero. Any vector space formula_53 endowed with the identically zero Lie bracket becomes a Lie algebra. Every one-dimensional Lie algebra is abelian, by the alternating property of the Lie bracket.\nWhen \"F\" is the real numbers, formula_66 is the Lie algebra of the general linear group formula_67, the group of invertible \"n\" x \"n\" real matrices (or equivalently, matrices with nonzero determinant), where the group operation is matrix multiplication. Likewise, formula_68 is the Lie algebra of the complex Lie group formula_69. The Lie bracket on formula_70 describes the failure of commutativity for matrix multiplication, or equivalently for the composition of linear maps. For any field \"F\", formula_71 can be viewed as the Lie algebra of the algebraic group formula_72 over \"F\".\nDefinitions.\nSubalgebras, ideals and homomorphisms.\nThe Lie bracket is not required to be associative, meaning that formula_73 need not be equal to formula_74. Nonetheless, much of the terminology for associative rings and algebras (and also for groups) has analogs for Lie algebras. A Lie subalgebra is a linear subspace formula_75 which is closed under the Lie bracket. An ideal formula_76 is a linear subspace that satisfies the stronger condition:\nformula_77\nIn the correspondence between Lie groups and Lie algebras, subgroups correspond to Lie subalgebras, and normal subgroups correspond to ideals.\nA Lie algebra homomorphism is a linear map compatible with the respective Lie brackets:\nformula_78\nAn isomorphism of Lie algebras is a bijective homomorphism.\nAs with normal subgroups in groups, ideals in Lie algebras are precisely the kernels of homomorphisms. Given a Lie algebra formula_7 and an ideal formula_80 in it, the \"quotient Lie algebra\" formula_81 is defined, with a surjective homomorphism formula_82 of Lie algebras. The first isomorphism theorem holds for Lie algebras: for any homomorphism formula_83 of Lie algebras, the image of formula_84 is a Lie subalgebra of formula_85 that is isomorphic to formula_86.\nFor the Lie algebra of a Lie group, the Lie bracket is a kind of infinitesimal commutator. As a result, for any Lie algebra, two elements formula_87 are said to \"commute\" if their bracket vanishes: formula_88.\nThe centralizer subalgebra of a subset formula_89 is the set of elements commuting with \"formula_90\": that is, formula_91. The centralizer of formula_7 itself is the \"center\" formula_93. Similarly, for a subspace \"S\", the normalizer subalgebra of \"formula_90\" is formula_95. If formula_90 is a Lie subalgebra, formula_97 is the largest subalgebra such that formula_90 is an ideal of formula_97.\nExample.\nThe subspace formula_100 of diagonal matrices in formula_71 is an abelian Lie subalgebra. (It is a Cartan subalgebra of formula_17, analogous to a maximal torus in the theory of compact Lie groups.) Here formula_100 is not an ideal in formula_17 for formula_105. For example, when formula_106, this follows from the calculation:\nformula_107\n(which is not always in formula_108).\nEvery one-dimensional linear subspace of a Lie algebra formula_7 is an abelian Lie subalgebra, but it need not be an ideal.\nProduct and semidirect product.\nFor two Lie algebras formula_7 and formula_111, the \"product\" Lie algebra is the vector space formula_112 consisting of all ordered pairs formula_113, with Lie bracket\nformula_114\nThis is the product in the category of Lie algebras. Note that the copies of formula_1 and formula_116 in formula_112 commute with each other: formula_118\nLet formula_7 be a Lie algebra and formula_120 an ideal of formula_7. If the canonical map formula_122 splits (i.e., admits a section formula_123, as a homomorphism of Lie algebras), then formula_7 is said to be a semidirect product of formula_120 and formula_81, formula_127. See also semidirect sum of Lie algebras.\nDerivations.\nFor an algebra \"A\" over a field \"F\", a \"derivation\" of \"A\" over \"F\" is a linear map formula_128 that satisfies the Leibniz rule\nformula_129\nfor all formula_130. (The definition makes sense for a possibly non-associative algebra.) Given two derivations formula_131 and formula_132, their commutator formula_133 is again a derivation. This operation makes the space formula_134 of all derivations of \"A\" over \"F\" into a Lie algebra.\nInformally speaking, the space of derivations of \"A\" is the Lie algebra of the automorphism group of \"A\". (This is literally true when the automorphism group is a Lie group, for example when \"F\" is the real numbers and \"A\" has finite dimension as a vector space.) For this reason, spaces of derivations are a natural way to construct Lie algebras: they are the \"infinitesimal automorphisms\" of \"A\". Indeed, writing out the condition that\nformula_135\n(where 1 denotes the identity map on \"A\") gives exactly the definition of \"D\" being a derivation.\nExample: the Lie algebra of vector fields. Let \"A\" be the ring formula_136 of smooth functions on a smooth manifold \"X\". Then a derivation of \"A\" over formula_137 is equivalent to a vector field on \"X\". (A vector field \"v\" gives a derivation of the space of smooth functions by differentiating functions in the direction of \"v\".) This makes the space formula_138 of vector fields into a Lie algebra (see Lie bracket of vector fields). Informally speaking, formula_138 is the Lie algebra of the diffeomorphism group of \"X\". So the Lie bracket of vector fields describes the non-commutativity of the diffeomorphism group. An action of a Lie group \"G\" on a manifold \"X\" determines a homomorphism of Lie algebras formula_140. (An example is illustrated below.)\nA Lie algebra can be viewed as a non-associative algebra, and so each Lie algebra formula_7 over a field \"F\" determines its Lie algebra of derivations, formula_142. That is, a derivation of formula_7 is a linear map formula_144 such that\nformula_145.\nThe \"inner derivation\" associated to any formula_146 is the adjoint mapping formula_147 defined by formula_148. (This is a derivation as a consequence of the Jacobi identity.) That gives a homomorphism of Lie algebras, formula_149. The image formula_150 is an ideal in formula_142, and the Lie algebra of \"outer derivations\" is defined as the quotient Lie algebra, formula_152. (This is exactly analogous to the outer automorphism group of a group.) For a semisimple Lie algebra (defined below) over a field of characteristic zero, every derivation is inner. This is related to the theorem that the outer automorphism group of a semisimple Lie group is finite.\nIn contrast, an abelian Lie algebra has many outer derivations. Namely, for a vector space formula_53 with Lie bracket zero, the Lie algebra formula_154 can be identified with formula_62.\nExamples.\nMatrix Lie algebras.\nA matrix group is a Lie group consisting of invertible matrices, formula_156, where the group operation of \"G\" is matrix multiplication. The corresponding Lie algebra formula_1 is the space of matrices which are tangent vectors to \"G\" inside the linear space formula_158: this consists of derivatives of smooth curves in \"G\" at the identity matrix formula_159:\nformula_160\nThe Lie bracket of formula_7 is given by the commutator of matrices, formula_19. Given a Lie algebra formula_163, one can recover the Lie group as the subgroup generated by the matrix exponential of elements of formula_7. (To be precise, this gives the identity component of \"G\", if \"G\" is not connected.) Here the exponential mapping formula_165 is defined by formula_166, which converges for every matrix formula_167.\nThe same comments apply to complex Lie subgroups of formula_168 and the complex matrix exponential, formula_169 (defined by the same formula).\nHere are some matrix Lie groups and their Lie algebras.\nThe complex orthogonal group formula_186, its identity component formula_187, and the Lie algebra formula_188 are given by the same formulas applied to \"n\" x \"n\" complex matrices. Equivalently, formula_186 is the subgroup of formula_69 that preserves the standard symmetric bilinear form on formula_191.\nTwo dimensions.\nSome Lie algebras of low dimension are described here. See the classification of low-dimensional real Lie algebras for further examples.\nThe affine group \"G\" can be identified with the group of matrices\nformula_222\nunder matrix multiplication, with formula_223, formula_224. Its Lie algebra is the Lie subalgebra formula_7 of formula_226 consisting of all matrices\nformula_227\nIn these terms, the basis above for formula_7 is given by the matrices\nformula_229\nFor any field formula_21, the 1-dimensional subspace formula_231 is an ideal in the 2-dimensional Lie algebra formula_7, by the formula formula_233. Both of the Lie algebras formula_231 and formula_235 are abelian (because 1-dimensional). In this sense, formula_7 can be broken into abelian \"pieces\", meaning that it is solvable (though not nilpotent), in the terminology below.\nformula_239.\nIt can be viewed as the Lie algebra of 3\u00d73 strictly upper-triangular matrices, with the commutator Lie bracket and the basis\nformula_240\nOver the real numbers, formula_241 is the Lie algebra of the Heisenberg group formula_242, that is, the group of matrices\nformula_243\nunder matrix multiplication.\nFor any field \"F\", the center of formula_237 is the 1-dimensional ideal formula_245, and the quotient formula_246 is abelian, isomorphic to formula_247. In the terminology below, it follows that formula_237 is nilpotent (though not abelian).\nformula_251\nThe commutation relations among these generators are\nformula_252\nformula_253\nformula_254\nThe cross product of vectors in formula_255 is given by the same formula in terms of the standard basis; so that Lie algebra is isomorphic to formula_249. Also, formula_249 is equivalent to the Spin (physics) angular-momentum component operators for spin-1 particles in quantum mechanics.\nThe Lie algebra formula_249 cannot be broken into pieces in the way that the previous examples can: it is \"simple\", meaning that it is not abelian and its only ideals are 0 and all of formula_249.\nformula_262\nThe Lie bracket is given by:\nformula_263\nformula_264\nformula_265\nUsing these formulas, one can show that the Lie algebra formula_261 is simple, and classify its finite-dimensional representations (defined below). In the terminology of quantum mechanics, one can think of \"E\" and \"F\" as raising and lowering operators. Indeed, for any representation of formula_261, the relations above imply that \"E\" maps the \"c\"-eigenspace of \"H\" (for a complex number \"c\") into the formula_268-eigenspace, while \"F\" maps the \"c\"-eigenspace into the formula_269-eigenspace.\nThe Lie algebra formula_261 is isomorphic to the complexification of formula_249, meaning the tensor product formula_272. The formulas for the Lie bracket are easier to analyze in the case of formula_261. As a result, it is common to analyze complex representations of the group formula_274 by relating them to representations of the Lie algebra formula_261.\nRepresentations.\nDefinitions.\nGiven a vector space \"V\", let formula_62 denote the Lie algebra consisting of all linear maps from \"V\" to itself, with bracket given by formula_19. A \"representation\" of a Lie algebra formula_7 on \"V\" is a Lie algebra homomorphism\nformula_284\nThat is, formula_285 sends each element of formula_7 to a linear map from \"V\" to itself, in such a way that the Lie bracket on formula_7 corresponds to the commutator of linear maps.\nA representation is said to be \"faithful\" if its kernel is zero. Ado's theorem states that every finite-dimensional Lie algebra over a field of characteristic zero has a faithful representation on a finite-dimensional vector space. Kenkichi Iwasawa extended this result to finite-dimensional Lie algebras over a field of any characteristic. Equivalently, every finite-dimensional Lie algebra over a field \"F\" is isomorphic to a Lie subalgebra of formula_71 for some positive integer \"n\".\nAdjoint representation.\nFor any Lie algebra formula_7, the adjoint representation is the representation\nformula_290\ngiven by formula_291. (This is a representation of formula_7 by the Jacobi identity.)\nGoals of representation theory.\nOne important aspect of the study of Lie algebras (especially semisimple Lie algebras, as defined below) is the study of their representations. Although Ado's theorem is an important result, the primary goal of representation theory is not to find a faithful representation of a given Lie algebra formula_7. Indeed, in the semisimple case, the adjoint representation is already faithful. Rather, the goal is to understand all possible representations of formula_7. For a semisimple Lie algebra over a field of characteristic zero, Weyl's theorem says that every finite-dimensional representation is a direct sum of irreducible representations (those with no nontrivial invariant subspaces). The finite-dimensional irreducible representations are well understood from several points of view; see the representation theory of semisimple Lie algebras and the Weyl character formula.\nUniversal enveloping algebra.\nThe functor that takes an associative algebra \"A\" over a field \"F\" to \"A\" as a Lie algebra (by formula_295) has a left adjoint formula_296, called the universal enveloping algebra. To construct this: given a Lie algebra formula_7 over \"F\", let\nformula_298\nbe the tensor algebra on formula_7, also called the free associative algebra on the vector space formula_7. Here formula_301 denotes the tensor product of \"F\"-vector spaces. Let \"I\" be the two-sided ideal in formula_302 generated by the elements formula_303 for formula_304; then the universal enveloping algebra is the quotient ring formula_305. It satisfies the Poincar\u00e9\u2013Birkhoff\u2013Witt theorem: if formula_306 is a basis for formula_7 as an \"F\"-vector space, then a basis for formula_308 is given by all ordered products formula_309 with formula_310 natural numbers. In particular, the map formula_311 is injective.\nRepresentations of formula_7 are equivalent to modules over the universal enveloping algebra. The fact that formula_311 is injective implies that every Lie algebra (possibly of infinite dimension) has a faithful representation (of infinite dimension), namely its representation on formula_308. This also shows that every Lie algebra is contained in the Lie algebra associated to some associative algebra.\nRepresentation theory in physics.\nThe representation theory of Lie algebras plays an important role in various parts of theoretical physics. There, one considers operators on the space of states that satisfy certain natural commutation relations. These commutation relations typically come from a symmetry of the problem\u2014specifically, they are the relations of the Lie algebra of the relevant symmetry group. An example is the angular momentum operators, whose commutation relations are those of the Lie algebra formula_249 of the rotation group formula_274. Typically, the space of states is far from being irreducible under the pertinent operators, but\none can attempt to decompose it into irreducible pieces. In doing so, one needs to know the irreducible representations of the given Lie algebra. In the study of the hydrogen atom, for example, quantum mechanics textbooks classify (more or less explicitly) the finite-dimensional irreducible representations of the Lie algebra formula_249.\nStructure theory and classification.\nLie algebras can be classified to some extent. This is a powerful approach to the classification of Lie groups.\nAbelian, nilpotent, and solvable.\nAnalogously to abelian, nilpotent, and solvable groups, one can define abelian, nilpotent, and solvable Lie algebras.\nA Lie algebra formula_7 is \"abelian\" if the Lie bracket vanishes; that is, [\"x\",\"y\"] = 0 for all \"x\" and \"y\" in formula_7. In particular, the Lie algebra of an abelian Lie group (such as the group formula_171 under addition or the torus group formula_321) is abelian. Every finite-dimensional abelian Lie algebra over a field formula_21 is isomorphic to formula_323 for some formula_324, meaning an \"n\"-dimensional vector space with Lie bracket zero.\nA more general class of Lie algebras is defined by the vanishing of all commutators of given length. First, the \"commutator subalgebra\" (or \"derived subalgebra\") of a Lie algebra formula_7 is formula_326, meaning the linear subspace spanned by all brackets formula_5 with formula_328. The commutator subalgebra is an ideal in formula_7, in fact the smallest ideal such that the quotient Lie algebra is abelian. It is analogous to the commutator subgroup of a group.\nA Lie algebra formula_7 is \"nilpotent\" if the lower central series\nformula_331\nbecomes zero after finitely many steps. Equivalently, formula_7 is nilpotent if there is a finite sequence of ideals in formula_7,\nformula_334\nsuch that formula_335 is central in formula_336 for each \"j\". By [[Engel's theorem]], a Lie algebra over any field is nilpotent if and only if for every \"u\" in formula_7 the adjoint endomorphism\nformula_338\nis [[nilpotent endomorphism|nilpotent]].\nMore generally, a Lie algebra formula_7 is said to be \"[[solvable Lie algebra|solvable]]\" if the [[derived series]]:\nformula_340\nbecomes zero after finitely many steps. Equivalently, formula_7 is solvable if there is a finite sequence of Lie subalgebras,\nformula_342\nsuch that formula_343 is an ideal in formula_344 with formula_345 abelian for each \"j\".\nEvery finite-dimensional Lie algebra over a field has a unique maximal solvable ideal, called its [[radical of a Lie algebra|radical]]. Under the [[Lie correspondence]], nilpotent (respectively, solvable) Lie groups correspond to nilpotent (respectively, solvable) Lie algebras over formula_137.\nFor example, for a positive integer \"n\" and a field \"F\" of characteristic zero, the radical of formula_71 is its center, the 1-dimensional subspace spanned by the identity matrix. An example of a solvable Lie algebra is the space formula_348 of upper-triangular matrices in formula_17; this is not nilpotent when formula_105. An example of a nilpotent Lie algebra is the space formula_351 of strictly upper-triangular matrices in formula_17; \nthis is not abelian when formula_353.\nSimple and semisimple.\nA Lie algebra formula_7 is called \"[[Simple Lie algebra|simple]]\" if it is not abelian and the only ideals in formula_7 are 0 and formula_7. (In particular, a one-dimensional\u2014necessarily abelian\u2014Lie algebra formula_7 is by definition not simple, even though its only ideals are 0 and formula_7.) A finite-dimensional Lie algebra formula_7 is called \"[[semisimple Lie algebra|semisimple]]\" if the only solvable ideal in formula_7 is 0. In characteristic zero, a Lie algebra formula_7 is semisimple if and only if it is isomorphic to a product of simple Lie algebras, formula_362.\nFor example, the Lie algebra formula_363 is simple for every formula_105 and every field \"F\" of characteristic zero (or just of characteristic not dividing \"n\"). The Lie algebra formula_48 over formula_137 is simple for every formula_105. The Lie algebra formula_183 over formula_137 is simple if formula_370 or formula_371. (There are \"exceptional isomorphisms\" formula_372 and formula_373.)\nThe concept of semisimplicity for Lie algebras is closely related with the complete reducibility (semisimplicity) of their representations. When the ground field \"F\" has characteristic zero, every finite-dimensional representation of a semisimple Lie algebra is [[semisimple representation|semisimple]] (that is, a direct sum of irreducible representations).\nA finite-dimensional Lie algebra over a field of characteristic zero is called [[reductive Lie algebra|reductive]] if its adjoint representation is semisimple. Every reductive Lie algebra is isomorphic to the product of an abelian Lie algebra and a semisimple Lie algebra.\nFor example, formula_71 is reductive for \"F\" of characteristic zero: for formula_105, it is isomorphic to the product\nformula_376\nwhere \"F\" denotes the center of formula_71, the 1-dimensional subspace spanned by the identity matrix. Since the special linear Lie algebra formula_363 is simple, formula_71 contains few ideals: only 0, the center \"F\", formula_363, and all of formula_71.\nCartan's criterion.\n[[Cartan's criterion]] (by [[\u00c9lie Cartan]]) gives conditions for a finite-dimensional Lie algebra of characteristic zero to be solvable or semisimple. It is expressed in terms of the [[Killing form]], the symmetric bilinear form on formula_7 defined by\nformula_383\nwhere tr denotes the trace of a linear operator. Namely: a Lie algebra formula_7 is semisimple if and only if the Killing form is [[nondegenerate form|nondegenerate]]. A Lie algebra formula_7 is solvable if and only if formula_386\nClassification.\nThe [[Levi decomposition]] asserts that every finite-dimensional Lie algebra over a field of characteristic zero is a semidirect product of its solvable radical and a semisimple Lie algebra. Moreover, a semisimple Lie algebra in characteristic zero is a product of simple Lie algebras, as mentioned above. This focuses attention on the problem of classifying the simple Lie algebras.\nThe simple Lie algebras of finite dimension over an [[algebraically closed field]] \"F\" of characteristic zero were classified by Killing and Cartan in the 1880s and 1890s, using [[root system]]s. Namely, every simple Lie algebra is of type A\"n\", B\"n\", C\"n\", D\"n\", E6, E7, E8, F4, or G2. Here the simple Lie algebra of type A\"n\" is formula_387, B\"n\" is formula_388, C\"n\" is formula_389, and D\"n\" is formula_390. The other five are known as the [[exceptional Lie algebra]]s.\nThe classification of finite-dimensional simple Lie algebras over formula_137 is more complicated, but it was also solved by Cartan (see [[simple Lie group]] for an equivalent classification). One can analyze a Lie algebra formula_7 over formula_137 by considering its complexification formula_394.\nIn the years leading up to 2004, the finite-dimensional simple Lie algebras over an algebraically closed field of characteristic formula_395 were classified by [[Richard Earl Block]], Robert Lee Wilson, Alexander Premet, and Helmut Strade. (See [[restricted Lie algebra#Classification of simple Lie algebras]].) It turns out that there are many more simple Lie algebras in positive characteristic than in characteristic zero.\nRelation to Lie groups.\n[[Image:Image Tangent-plane.svg|thumb| The tangent space of a [[sphere]] at a point formula_3. If formula_3 were the identity element of a Lie group, the tangent space would be a Lie algebra.]]\nAlthough Lie algebras can be studied in their own right, historically they arose as a means to study [[Lie group]]s.\nThe relationship between Lie groups and Lie algebras can be summarized as follows. Each Lie group determines a Lie algebra over formula_137 (concretely, the tangent space at the identity). Conversely, for every finite-dimensional Lie algebra formula_1, there is a connected Lie group formula_400 with Lie algebra formula_1. This is [[Lie's third theorem]]; see the [[Baker\u2013Campbell\u2013Hausdorff formula]]. This Lie group is not determined uniquely; however, any two Lie groups with the same Lie algebra are \"locally isomorphic\", and more strongly, they have the same [[universal cover]]. For instance, the special orthogonal group [[SO(3)]] and the special unitary group [[SU(2)]] have isomorphic Lie algebras, but SU(2) is a [[simply connected]] double cover of SO(3).\nFor \"simply connected\" Lie groups, there is a complete correspondence: taking the Lie algebra gives an [[equivalence of categories]] from simply connected Lie groups to Lie algebras of finite dimension over formula_137.\nThe correspondence between Lie algebras and Lie groups is used in several ways, including in the [[list of simple Lie groups|classification of Lie groups]] and the [[representation theory]] of Lie groups. For finite-dimensional representations, there is an equivalence of categories between representations of a real Lie algebra and representations of the corresponding simply connected Lie group. This simplifies the representation theory of Lie groups: it is often easier to classify the representations of a Lie algebra, using linear algebra.\nEvery connected Lie group is isomorphic to its universal cover modulo a [[discrete group|discrete]] central subgroup. So classifying Lie groups becomes simply a matter of counting the discrete subgroups of the [[Center (group theory)|center]], once the Lie algebra is known. For example, the real semisimple Lie algebras were classified by Cartan, and so the classification of semisimple Lie groups is well understood.\nFor infinite-dimensional Lie algebras, Lie theory works less well. The exponential map need not be a local [[homeomorphism]] (for example, in the diffeomorphism group of the circle, there are diffeomorphisms arbitrarily close to the identity that are not in the image of the exponential map). Moreover, in terms of the existing notions of infinite-dimensional Lie groups, some infinite-dimensional Lie algebras do not come from any group.\nLie theory also does not work so neatly for infinite-dimensional representations of a finite-dimensional group. Even for the additive group formula_403, an infinite-dimensional representation of formula_400 can usually not be differentiated to produce a representation of its Lie algebra on the same space, or vice versa. The theory of [[Harish-Chandra module]]s is a more subtle relation between infinite-dimensional representations for groups and Lie algebras.\nReal form and complexification.\nGiven a [[complex Lie algebra]] formula_1, a real Lie algebra formula_406 is said to be a \"[[real form]]\" of formula_1 if the complexification formula_408 is isomorphic to formula_7. A real form need not be unique; for example, formula_261 has two real forms up to isomorphism, formula_411 and formula_412.\nGiven a semisimple complex Lie algebra formula_1, a \"[[split form]]\" of it is a real form that splits; i.e., it has a Cartan subalgebra which acts via an adjoint representation with real eigenvalues. A split form exists and is unique (up to isomorphism). A \"[[compact form]]\" is a real form that is the Lie algebra of a compact Lie group. A compact form exists and is also unique up to isomorphism.\nLie algebra with additional structures.\nA Lie algebra may be equipped with additional structures that are compatible with the Lie bracket. For example, a [[graded Lie algebra]] is a Lie algebra (or more generally a [[Lie superalgebra]]) with a compatible grading. A [[differential graded Lie algebra]] also comes with a differential, making the underlying vector space a [[chain complex]].\nFor example, the [[homotopy group]]s of a simply connected [[topological space]] form a graded Lie algebra, using the [[Whitehead product]]. In a related construction, [[Daniel Quillen]] used differential graded Lie algebras over the [[rational number]]s formula_414 to describe [[rational homotopy theory]] in algebraic terms.\nLie ring.\nThe definition of a Lie algebra over a field extends to define a Lie algebra over any [[commutative ring]] \"R\". Namely, a Lie algebra formula_7 over \"R\" is an \"R\"-[[module (mathematics)|module]] with an alternating \"R\"-bilinear map formula_416 that satisfies the Jacobi identity. A Lie algebra over the ring formula_417 of [[integer]]s is sometimes called a Lie ring. (This is not directly related to the notion of a Lie group.)\nLie rings are used in the study of finite [[p-group]]s (for a prime number \"p\") through the \"Lazard correspondence\". The lower central factors of a finite \"p\"-group are finite abelian \"p\"-groups. The direct sum of the lower central factors is given the structure of a Lie ring by defining the bracket to be the [[commutator]] of two coset representatives; see the example below.\n[[p-adic analytic group|p-adic Lie groups]] are related to Lie algebras over the field formula_418 of [[p-adic number]]s as well as over the ring formula_419 of [[p-adic integer]]s. Part of [[Claude Chevalley]]'s construction of the finite [[groups of Lie type]] involves showing that a simple Lie algebra over the complex numbers comes from a Lie algebra over the integers, and then (with more care) a [[group scheme]] over the integers.\n formula_427\nis a Lie ring, with addition given by the group multiplication (which is abelian on each quotient group formula_428), and with Lie bracket formula_429 given by commutators in the group:\n formula_430\nFor example, the Lie ring associated to the lower central series on the [[dihedral group]] of order 8 is the Heisenberg Lie algebra of dimension 3 over the field formula_431.\nDefinition using category-theoretic notation.\nThe definition of a Lie algebra can be reformulated more abstractly in the language of [[category theory]]. Namely, one can define a Lie algebra in terms of linear maps\u2014that is, [[morphism]]s in the [[category of vector spaces]]\u2014without considering individual elements. (In this section, the field over which the algebra is defined is assumed to be of characteristic different from 2.)\nFor the category-theoretic definition of Lie algebras, two [[tensor product#Tensor powers and braiding|braiding isomorphisms]] are needed. If A is a vector space, the \"interchange isomorphism\" formula_432 is defined by\nformula_433\nThe \"cyclic-permutation braiding\" formula_434 is defined as\nformula_435\nwhere formula_436 is the identity morphism. Equivalently, formula_437 is defined by\nformula_438\nWith this notation, a Lie algebra can be defined as an object formula_54 in the category of vector spaces together with a morphism\nformula_440\nthat satisfies the two morphism equalities\nformula_441\nand\nformula_442\nGeneralization.\nSeveral generalizations of a Lie algebra have been proposed, many from physics.

Combining these two ideas, one obtains a continuous group where multiplying points and their inverses is continuous. If the multiplication and taking of inverses are smooth (differentiable) as well, one obtains a Lie group.\nLie groups provide a natural model for the concept of continuous symmetry, a celebrated example of which is the circle group. Rotating a circle is an example of a continuous symmetry. For any rotation of the circle, there exists the same symmetry, and concatenation of such rotations makes them into the circle group, an archetypal example of a Lie group. Lie groups are widely used in many parts of modern mathematics and physics.\nLie groups were first found by studying matrix subgroups formula_1 contained in formula_2 or &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;, the groups of formula_3 invertible matrices over formula_4 or &amp;NoBreak;}&amp;NoBreak;. These are now called the classical groups, as the concept has been extended far beyond these origins. Lie groups are named after Norwegian mathematician Sophus Lie (1842\u20131899), who laid the foundations of the theory of continuous transformation groups. Lie's original motivation for introducing Lie groups was to model the continuous symmetries of differential equations, in much the same way that finite groups are used in Galois theory to model the discrete symmetries of algebraic equations.\nHistory.\nSophus Lie considered the winter of 1873\u20131874 as the birth date of his theory of continuous groups. Thomas Hawkins, however, suggests that it was \"Lie's prodigious research activity during the four-year period from the fall of 1869 to the fall of 1873\" that led to the theory's creation. Some of Lie's early ideas were developed in close collaboration with Felix Klein. Lie met with Klein every day from October 1869 through 1872: in Berlin from the end of October 1869 to the end of February 1870, and in Paris, G\u00f6ttingen and Erlangen in the subsequent two years. Lie stated that all of the principal results were obtained by 1884. But during the 1870s all his papers (except the very first note) were published in Norwegian journals, which impeded recognition of the work throughout the rest of Europe. In 1884 a young German mathematician, Friedrich Engel, came to work with Lie on a systematic treatise to expose his theory of continuous groups. From this effort resulted the three-volume \"Theorie der Transformationsgruppen\", published in 1888, 1890, and 1893. The term \"groupes de Lie\" first appeared in French in 1893 in the thesis of Lie's student Arthur Tresse.\nLie's ideas did not stand in isolation from the rest of mathematics. In fact, his interest in the geometry of differential equations was first motivated by the work of Carl Gustav Jacobi, on the theory of partial differential equations of first order and on the equations of classical mechanics. Much of Jacobi's work was published posthumously in the 1860s, generating enormous interest in France and Germany. Lie's \"id\u00e9e fixe\" was to develop a theory of symmetries of differential equations that would accomplish for them what \u00c9variste Galois had done for algebraic equations: namely, to classify them in terms of group theory. Lie and other mathematicians showed that the most important equations for special functions and orthogonal polynomials tend to arise from group theoretical symmetries. In Lie's early work, the idea was to construct a theory of \"continuous groups\", to complement the theory of discrete groups that had developed in the theory of modular forms, in the hands of Felix Klein and Henri Poincar\u00e9. The initial application that Lie had in mind was to the theory of differential equations. On the model of Galois theory and polynomial equations, the driving conception was of a theory capable of unifying, by the study of symmetry, the whole area of ordinary differential equations. However, the hope that Lie theory would unify the entire field of ordinary differential equations was not fulfilled. Symmetry methods for ODEs continue to be studied, but do not dominate the subject. There is a differential Galois theory, but it was developed by others, such as Picard and Vessiot, and it provides a theory of quadratures, the indefinite integrals required to express solutions.\nAdditional impetus to consider continuous groups came from ideas of Bernhard Riemann, on the foundations of geometry, and their further development in the hands of Klein. Thus three major themes in 19th century mathematics were combined by Lie in creating his new theory:\nAlthough today Sophus Lie is rightfully recognized as the creator of the theory of continuous groups, a major stride in the development of their structure theory, which was to have a profound influence on subsequent development of mathematics, was made by Wilhelm Killing, who in 1888 published the first paper in a series entitled \"Die Zusammensetzung der stetigen endlichen Transformationsgruppen\" (\"The composition of continuous finite transformation groups\"). The work of Killing, later refined and generalized by \u00c9lie Cartan, led to classification of semisimple Lie algebras, Cartan's theory of symmetric spaces, and Hermann Weyl's description of representations of compact and semisimple Lie groups using highest weights.\nIn 1900 David Hilbert challenged Lie theorists with his Fifth Problem presented at the International Congress of Mathematicians in Paris.\nWeyl brought the early period of the development of the theory of Lie groups to fruition, for not only did he classify irreducible representations of semisimple Lie groups and connect the theory of groups with quantum mechanics, but he also put Lie's theory itself on firmer footing by clearly enunciating the distinction between Lie's \"infinitesimal groups\" (i.e., Lie algebras) and the Lie groups proper, and began investigations of topology of Lie groups. The theory of Lie groups was systematically reworked in modern mathematical language in a monograph by Claude Chevalley.\nOverview.\nLie groups are smooth differentiable manifolds and as such can be studied using differential calculus, in contrast with the case of more general topological groups. One of the key ideas in the theory of Lie groups is to replace the \"global\" object, the group, with its \"local\" or linearized version, which Lie himself called its \"infinitesimal group\" and which has since become known as its Lie algebra.\nLie groups play an enormous role in modern geometry, on several different levels. Felix Klein argued in his Erlangen program that one can consider various \"geometries\" by specifying an appropriate transformation group that leaves certain geometric properties invariant. Thus Euclidean geometry corresponds to the choice of the group E(3) of distance-preserving transformations of the Euclidean space &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;, conformal geometry corresponds to enlarging the group to the conformal group, whereas in projective geometry one is interested in the properties invariant under the projective group. This idea later led to the notion of a \"G\"-structure, where \"G\" is a Lie group of \"local\" symmetries of a manifold.\nLie groups (and their associated Lie algebras) play a major role in modern physics, with the Lie group typically playing the role of a symmetry of a physical system. Here, the representations of the Lie group (or of its Lie algebra) are especially important. Representation theory is used extensively in particle physics. Groups whose representations are of particular importance include the rotation group SO(3) (or its double cover SU(2)), the special unitary group SU(3) and the Poincar\u00e9 group.\nOn a \"global\" level, whenever a Lie group acts on a geometric object, such as a Riemannian or a symplectic manifold, this action provides a measure of rigidity and yields a rich algebraic structure. The presence of continuous symmetries expressed via a Lie group action on a manifold places strong constraints on its geometry and facilitates analysis on the manifold. Linear actions of Lie groups are especially important, and are studied in representation theory.\nIn the 1940s\u20131950s, Ellis Kolchin, Armand Borel, and Claude Chevalley realised that many foundational results concerning Lie groups can be developed completely algebraically, giving rise to the theory of algebraic groups defined over an arbitrary field. This insight opened new possibilities in pure algebra, by providing a uniform construction for most finite simple groups, as well as in algebraic geometry. The theory of automorphic forms, an important branch of modern number theory, deals extensively with analogues of Lie groups over adele rings; \"p\"-adic Lie groups play an important role, via their connections with Galois representations in number theory.\nDefinitions and examples.\nA real Lie group is a group that is also a finite-dimensional real smooth manifold, in which the group operations of multiplication and inversion are smooth maps. Smoothness of the group multiplication\n formula_5\nmeans that \"\u03bc\" is a smooth mapping of the product manifold \"G\" \u00d7 \"G\" into \"G\". The two requirements can be combined to the single requirement that the mapping\n formula_6\nbe a smooth mapping of the product manifold into \"G\".\nNon-example.\nWe now present an example of a group with an uncountable number of elements that is not a Lie group under a certain topology. The group given by \n formula_13\nwith formula_14 a \"fixed\" irrational number, is a subgroup of the torus formula_15 that is not a Lie group when given the subspace topology. If we take any small neighborhood formula_16 of a point formula_17 in &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;, for example, the portion of formula_18 in formula_16 is disconnected. The group formula_18 winds repeatedly around the torus without ever reaching a previous point of the spiral and thus forms a dense subgroup of &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;.\nThe group formula_18 can, however, be given a different topology, in which the distance between two points formula_22 is defined as the length of the shortest path \"in the group\" formula_18 joining formula_24 to &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;. In this topology, formula_18 is identified homeomorphically with the real line by identifying each element with the number formula_26 in the definition of &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;. With this topology, formula_18 is just the group of real numbers under addition and is therefore a Lie group.\nThe group formula_18 is an example of a \"Lie subgroup\" of a Lie group that is not closed. See the discussion below of Lie subgroups in the section on basic concepts.\nMatrix Lie groups.\nLet formula_29 denote the group of formula_3 invertible matrices with entries in &amp;NoBreak;}&amp;NoBreak;. Any closed subgroup of formula_29 is a Lie group; Lie groups of this sort are called matrix Lie groups. Since most of the interesting examples of Lie groups can be realized as matrix Lie groups, some textbooks restrict attention to this class, including those of Hall, Rossmann, and Stillwell. \nRestricting attention to matrix Lie groups simplifies the definition of the Lie algebra and the exponential map. The following are standard examples of matrix Lie groups.\nAll of the preceding examples fall under the heading of the classical groups.\nRelated concepts.\nA complex Lie group is defined in the same way using complex manifolds rather than real ones (example: formula_47), and holomorphic maps. Similarly, using an alternate metric completion of &amp;NoBreak;}&amp;NoBreak;, one can define a \"p\"-adic Lie group over the \"p\"-adic numbers, a topological group which is also an analytic \"p\"-adic manifold, such that the group operations are analytic. In particular, each point has a \"p\"-adic neighborhood.\nHilbert's fifth problem asked whether replacing differentiable manifolds with topological or analytic ones can yield new examples. The answer to this question turned out to be negative: in 1952, Gleason, Montgomery and Zippin showed that if \"G\" is a topological manifold with continuous group operations, then there exists exactly one analytic structure on \"G\" which turns it into a Lie group (see also Hilbert\u2013Smith conjecture). If the underlying manifold is allowed to be infinite-dimensional (for example, a Hilbert manifold), then one arrives at the notion of an infinite-dimensional Lie group. It is possible to define analogues of many Lie groups over finite fields, and these give most of the examples of finite simple groups.\nThe language of category theory provides a concise definition for Lie groups: a Lie group is a group object in the category of smooth manifolds. This is important, because it allows generalization of the notion of a Lie group to Lie supergroups. This categorical point of view leads also to a different generalization of Lie groups, namely Lie groupoids, which are groupoid objects in the category of smooth manifolds with a further requirement.\nTopological definition.\nA Lie group can be defined as a (Hausdorff) topological group that, near the identity element, looks like a transformation group, with no reference to differentiable manifolds nor topological manifolds. Precisely, a \"Lie group\" is defined as a topological group that (1) is locally isomorphic near the identities to a matrix Lie group, a closed subgroup of formula_29 and (2) has at most countably many connected components. Showing the topological definition is equivalent to the usual one is technical (and the beginning readers should skip the following) but is done roughly as follows:\nThe topological definition implies the statement that if two Lie groups are isomorphic as topological groups, then they are isomorphic as Lie groups. In fact, it states the general principle that, to a large extent, \"the topology of a Lie group\" together with the group law determines the geometry of the group.\nMore examples of Lie groups.\nLie groups occur in abundance throughout mathematics and physics. Matrix groups or algebraic groups are (roughly) groups of matrices (for example, orthogonal and symplectic groups), and these give most of the more common examples of Lie groups.\nDimensions one and two.\nThe only connected Lie groups with dimension one are the real line formula_4 (with the group operation being addition) and the circle group formula_57 of complex numbers with absolute value one (with the group operation being multiplication). The formula_57 group is often denoted as &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;, the group of formula_59 unitary matrices.\nIn two dimensions, if we restrict attention to simply connected groups, then they are classified by their Lie algebras. There are (up to isomorphism) only two Lie algebras of dimension two. The associated simply connected Lie groups are formula_60 (with the group operation being vector addition) and the affine group in dimension one, described in the previous subsection under \"first examples\".\nConstructions.\nThere are several standard ways to form new Lie groups from old ones:\nRelated notions.\nSome examples of groups that are \"not\" Lie groups (except in the trivial sense that any group having at most countably many elements can be viewed as a 0-dimensional Lie group, with the discrete topology), are:\nBasic concepts.\nThe Lie algebra associated with a Lie group.\nTo every Lie group we can associate a Lie algebra whose underlying vector space is the tangent space of the Lie group at the identity element and which completely captures the local structure of the group. Informally we can think of elements of the Lie algebra as elements of the group that are \"infinitesimally close\" to the identity, and the Lie bracket of the Lie algebra is related to the commutator of two such infinitesimal elements. Before giving the abstract definition we give a few examples:\n formula_67 where exp(\"tX\") is defined using the matrix exponential. It can then be shown that the Lie algebra of \"G\" is a real vector space that is closed under the bracket operation, &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;.\nThe concrete definition given above for matrix groups is easy to work with, but has some minor problems: to use it we first need to represent a Lie group as a group of matrices, but not all Lie groups can be represented in this way, and it is not even obvious that the Lie algebra is independent of the representation we use. To get around these problems we give \nthe general definition of the Lie algebra of a Lie group (in 4 steps):\nThis Lie algebra formula_69 is finite-dimensional and it has the same dimension as the manifold \"G\". The Lie algebra of \"G\" determines \"G\" up to \"local isomorphism\", where two Lie groups are called locally isomorphic if they look the same near the identity element.\nProblems about Lie groups are often solved by first solving the corresponding problem for the Lie algebras, and the result for groups then usually follows easily. \nFor example, simple Lie groups are usually classified by first classifying the corresponding Lie algebras.\nWe could also define a Lie algebra structure on \"Te\" using right invariant vector fields instead of left invariant vector fields. This leads to the same Lie algebra, because the inverse map on \"G\" can be used to identify left invariant vector fields with right invariant vector fields, and acts as \u22121 on the tangent space \"Te\".\nThe Lie algebra structure on \"Te\" can also be described as follows:\nthe commutator operation\n (\"x\", \"y\") \u2192 \"xyx\"\u22121\"y\"\u22121\non \"G\" \u00d7 \"G\" sends (\"e\",\u00a0\"e\") to \"e\", so its derivative yields a bilinear operation on \"TeG\". This bilinear operation is actually the zero map, but the second derivative, under the proper identification of tangent spaces, yields an operation that satisfies the axioms of a Lie bracket, and it is equal to twice the one defined through left-invariant vector fields.\nHomomorphisms and isomorphisms.\nIf \"G\" and \"H\" are Lie groups, then a Lie group homomorphism \"f\" : \"G\" \u2192 \"H\" is a smooth group homomorphism. In the case of complex Lie groups, such a homomorphism is required to be a holomorphic map. However, these requirements are a bit stringent; every continuous homomorphism between real Lie groups turns out to be (real) analytic.\nThe composition of two Lie homomorphisms is again a homomorphism, and the class of all Lie groups, together with these morphisms, forms a category. Moreover, every Lie group homomorphism induces a homomorphism between the corresponding Lie algebras. Let formula_71 be a Lie group homomorphism and let formula_72 be its derivative at the identity. If we identify the Lie algebras of \"G\" and \"H\" with their tangent spaces at the identity elements, then formula_72 is a map between the corresponding Lie algebras:\n formula_74\nwhich turns out to be a Lie algebra homomorphism (meaning that it is a linear map which preserves the Lie bracket). In the language of category theory, we then have a covariant functor from the category of Lie groups to the category of Lie algebras which sends a Lie group to its Lie algebra and a Lie group homomorphism to its derivative at the identity.\nTwo Lie groups are called \"isomorphic\" if there exists a bijective homomorphism between them whose inverse is also a Lie group homomorphism. Equivalently, it is a diffeomorphism which is also a group homomorphism. Observe that, by the above, a continuous homomorphism from a Lie group formula_1 to a Lie group formula_18 is an isomorphism of Lie groups if and only if it is bijective.\nLie group versus Lie algebra isomorphisms.\nIsomorphic Lie groups necessarily have isomorphic Lie algebras; it is then reasonable to ask how isomorphism classes of Lie groups relate to isomorphism classes of Lie algebras.\nThe first result in this direction is Lie's third theorem, which states that every finite-dimensional, real Lie algebra is the Lie algebra of some (linear) Lie group. One way to prove Lie's third theorem is to use Ado's theorem, which says every finite-dimensional real Lie algebra is isomorphic to a matrix Lie algebra. Meanwhile, for every finite-dimensional matrix Lie algebra, there is a linear group (matrix Lie group) with this algebra as its Lie algebra.\nOn the other hand, Lie groups with isomorphic Lie algebras need not be isomorphic. Furthermore, this result remains true even if we assume the groups are connected. To put it differently, the \"global\" structure of a Lie group is not determined by its Lie algebra; for example, if \"Z\" is any discrete subgroup of the center of \"G\" then \"G\" and \"G\"/\"Z\" have the same Lie algebra (see the table of Lie groups for examples). An example of importance in physics are the groups SU(2) and SO(3). These two groups have isomorphic Lie algebras, but the groups themselves are not isomorphic, because SU(2) is simply connected but SO(3) is not.\nOn the other hand, if we require that the Lie group be simply connected, then the global structure is determined by its Lie algebra: two simply connected Lie groups with isomorphic Lie algebras are isomorphic. (See the next subsection for more information about simply connected Lie groups.) In light of Lie's third theorem, we may therefore say that there is a one-to-one correspondence between isomorphism classes of finite-dimensional real Lie algebras and isomorphism classes of simply connected Lie groups.\nSimply connected Lie groups.\nA Lie group formula_1 is said to be simply connected if every loop in formula_1 can be shrunk continuously to a point in &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;. This notion is important because of the following result that has simple connectedness as a hypothesis:\n Theorem: Suppose formula_1 and formula_18 are Lie groups with Lie algebras formula_81 and formula_82 and that formula_83 is a Lie algebra homomorphism. If formula_1 is simply connected, then there is a unique Lie group homomorphism formula_85 such that &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;, where formula_86 is the differential of formula_87 at the identity.\nLie's third theorem says that every finite-dimensional real Lie algebra is the Lie algebra of a Lie group. It follows from Lie's third theorem and the preceding result that every finite-dimensional real Lie algebra is the Lie algebra of a \"unique\" simply connected Lie group.\nAn example of a simply connected group is the special unitary group SU(2), which as a manifold is the 3-sphere. The rotation group SO(3), on the other hand, is not simply connected. (See \"Topology of SO(3)\".) The failure of SO(3) to be simply connected is intimately connected to the distinction between integer spin and half-integer spin in quantum mechanics. Other examples of simply connected Lie groups include the special unitary group SU(n), the spin group (double cover of rotation group) Spin(\"n\") for &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;, and the compact symplectic group Sp(n).\nMethods for determining whether a Lie group is simply connected or not are discussed in the article on fundamental groups of Lie groups.\nExponential map.\nThe exponential map from the Lie algebra formula_88 of the general linear group formula_89 to formula_89 is defined by the matrix exponential, given by the usual power series:\n formula_91\nfor matrices &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;. If formula_1 is a closed subgroup of &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;, then the exponential map takes the Lie algebra of formula_1 into &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;; thus, we have an exponential map for all matrix groups. Every element of formula_1 that is sufficiently close to the identity is the exponential of a matrix in the Lie algebra.\nThe definition above is easy to use, but it is not defined for Lie groups that are not matrix groups, and it is not clear that the exponential map of a Lie group does not depend on its representation as a matrix group. We can solve both problems using a more abstract definition of the exponential map that works for all Lie groups, as follows.\nFor each vector formula_66 in the Lie algebra formula_69 of formula_1 (i.e., the tangent space to formula_1 at the identity), one proves that there is a unique one-parameter subgroup formula_99 such that &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;. Saying that formula_100 is a one-parameter subgroup means simply that formula_100 is a smooth map into formula_1 and that \n formula_103\nfor all formula_104 and &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;. The operation on the right hand side is the group multiplication in &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;. The formal similarity of this formula with the one valid for the exponential function justifies the definition\n formula_105\nThis is called the exponential map, and it maps the Lie algebra formula_69 into the Lie group &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;. It provides a diffeomorphism between a neighborhood of\u00a00 in formula_69 and a neighborhood of formula_108 in &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;. This exponential map is a generalization of the exponential function for real numbers (because formula_4 is the Lie algebra of the Lie group of positive real numbers with multiplication), for complex numbers (because formula_36 is the Lie algebra of the Lie group of non-zero complex numbers with multiplication) and for matrices (because formula_111 with the regular commutator is the Lie algebra of the Lie group formula_112 of all invertible matrices).\nBecause the exponential map is surjective on some neighbourhood formula_113 of &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;, it is common to call elements of the Lie algebra infinitesimal generators of the group &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;. The subgroup of formula_1 generated by formula_113 is the identity component of &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;.\nThe exponential map and the Lie algebra determine the \"local group structure\" of every connected Lie group, because of the Baker\u2013Campbell\u2013Hausdorff formula: there exists a neighborhood formula_16 of the zero element of &amp;NoBreak;}&amp;NoBreak;, such that for formula_117 we have\n formula_118\nwhere the omitted terms are known and involve Lie brackets of four or more elements. In case formula_66 and formula_120 commute, this formula reduces to the familiar exponential law &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;.\nThe exponential map relates Lie group homomorphisms. That is, if formula_71 is a Lie group homomorphism and formula_122 the induced map on the corresponding Lie algebras, then for all formula_123 we have\n formula_124\nIn other words, the following diagram commutes,\nThe exponential map from the Lie algebra to the Lie group is not always onto, even if the group is connected (though it does map onto the Lie group for connected groups that are either compact or nilpotent). For example, the exponential map of SL(2, R) is not surjective. Also, the exponential map is neither surjective nor injective for infinite-dimensional (see below) Lie groups modelled on \"C\"\u221e Fr\u00e9chet space, even from arbitrary small neighborhood of\u00a00 to corresponding neighborhood of\u00a01.\nLie subgroup.\nA Lie subgroup formula_18 of a Lie group formula_1 is a Lie group that is a subset of formula_1 and such that the inclusion map from formula_18 to formula_1 is an injective immersion and group homomorphism. According to Cartan's theorem, a closed subgroup of formula_1 admits a unique smooth structure which makes it an embedded Lie subgroup of formula_1\u2014i.e. a Lie subgroup such that the inclusion map is a smooth embedding.\nExamples of non-closed subgroups are plentiful; for example take formula_1 to be a torus of dimension 2 or greater, and let formula_18 be a one-parameter subgroup of \"irrational slope\", i.e. one that winds around in \"G\". Then there is a Lie group homomorphism formula_134 with &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;. The closure of formula_18 will be a sub-torus in &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;.\nThe exponential map gives a one-to-one correspondence between the connected Lie subgroups of a connected Lie group formula_1 and the subalgebras of the Lie algebra of &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;. Typically, the subgroup corresponding to a subalgebra is not a closed subgroup. There is no criterion solely based on the structure of formula_1 which determines which subalgebras correspond to closed subgroups.\nRepresentations.\nOne important aspect of the study of Lie groups is their representations, that is, the way they can act (linearly) on vector spaces. In physics, Lie groups often encode the symmetries of a physical system. The way one makes use of this symmetry to help analyze the system is often through representation theory. Consider, for example, the time-independent Schr\u00f6dinger equation in quantum mechanics, &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;. Assume the system in question has the rotation group SO(3) as a symmetry, meaning that the Hamiltonian operator formula_138 commutes with the action of SO(3) on the wave function &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;. (One important example of such a system is the hydrogen atom, which has a spherically symmetric potential.) This assumption does not necessarily mean that the solutions formula_139 are rotationally invariant functions. Rather, it means that the \"space\" of solutions to formula_140 is invariant under rotations (for each fixed value of formula_141). This space, therefore, constitutes a representation of SO(3). These representations have been and the classification leads to a substantial simplification of the problem, essentially converting a three-dimensional partial differential equation to a one-dimensional ordinary differential equation.\nThe case of a connected compact Lie group \"K\" (including the just-mentioned case of SO(3)) is particularly tractable. In that case, every finite-dimensional representation of \"K\" decomposes as a direct sum of irreducible representations. The irreducible representations, in turn, were classified by Hermann Weyl. The classification is in terms of the \"highest weight\" of the representation. The classification is closely related to the classification of representations of a semisimple Lie algebra.\nOne can also study (in general infinite-dimensional) unitary representations of an arbitrary Lie group (not necessarily compact). For example, it is possible to give a relatively simple explicit description of the representations of the group SL(2, R) and the representations of the Poincar\u00e9 group.\nClassification.\nLie groups may be thought of as smoothly varying families of symmetries. Examples of symmetries include rotation about an axis. What must be understood is the nature of 'small' transformations, for example, rotations through tiny angles, that link nearby transformations. The mathematical object capturing this structure is called a Lie algebra (Lie himself called them \"infinitesimal groups\"). It can be defined because Lie groups are smooth manifolds, so have tangent spaces at each point.\nThe Lie algebra of any compact Lie group (very roughly: one for which the symmetries form a bounded set) can be decomposed as a direct sum of an abelian Lie algebra and some number of simple ones. The structure of an abelian Lie algebra is mathematically uninteresting (since the Lie bracket is identically zero); the interest is in the simple summands. Hence the question arises: what are the simple Lie algebras of compact groups? It turns out that they mostly fall into four infinite families, the \"classical Lie algebras\" A\"n\", B\"n\", C\"n\" and D\"n\", which have simple descriptions in terms of symmetries of Euclidean space. But there are also just five \"exceptional Lie algebras\" that do not fall into any of these families. E8 is the largest of these.\nLie groups are classified according to their algebraic properties (simple, semisimple, solvable, nilpotent, abelian), their connectedness (connected or simply connected) and their compactness.\nA first key result is the Levi decomposition, which says that every simply connected Lie group is the semidirect product of a solvable normal subgroup and a semisimple subgroup. \nThe identity component of any Lie group is an open normal subgroup, and the quotient group is a discrete group. The universal cover of any connected Lie group is a simply connected Lie group, and conversely any connected Lie group is a quotient of a simply connected Lie group by a discrete normal subgroup of the center. Any Lie group \"G\" can be decomposed into discrete, simple, and abelian groups in a canonical way as follows. Write \n \"G\"con for the connected component of the identity\n \"G\"sol for the largest connected normal solvable subgroup\n \"G\"nil for the largest connected normal nilpotent subgroup\nso that we have a sequence of normal subgroups\n 1 \u2286 \"G\"nil \u2286 \"G\"sol \u2286 \"G\"con \u2286 \"G\".\nThen\n \"G\"/\"G\"con is discrete\n \"G\"con/\"G\"sol is a central extension of a product of simple connected Lie groups.\n \"G\"sol/\"G\"nil is abelian. A connected abelian Lie group is isomorphic to a product of copies of R and the circle group \"S\"1.\n \"G\"nil/1 is nilpotent, and therefore its ascending central series has all quotients abelian.\nThis can be used to reduce some problems about Lie groups (such as finding their unitary representations) to the same problems for connected simple groups and nilpotent and solvable subgroups of smaller dimension.\nInfinite-dimensional Lie groups.\nLie groups are often defined to be finite-dimensional, but there are many groups that resemble Lie groups, except for being infinite-dimensional. The simplest way to define infinite-dimensional Lie groups is to model them locally on Banach spaces (as opposed to Euclidean space in the finite-dimensional case), and in this case much of the basic theory is similar to that of finite-dimensional Lie groups. However this is inadequate for many applications, because many natural examples of infinite-dimensional Lie groups are not Banach manifolds. Instead one needs to define Lie groups modeled on more general locally convex topological vector spaces. In this case the relation between the Lie algebra and the Lie group becomes rather subtle, and several results about finite-dimensional Lie groups no longer hold.\nThe literature is not entirely uniform in its terminology as to exactly which properties of infinite-dimensional groups qualify the group for the prefix \"Lie\" in \"Lie group\". On the Lie algebra side of affairs, things are simpler since the qualifying criteria for the prefix \"Lie\" in \"Lie algebra\" are purely algebraic. For example, an infinite-dimensional Lie algebra may or may not have a corresponding Lie group. That is, there may be a group corresponding to the Lie algebra, but it might not be nice enough to be called a Lie group, or the connection between the group and the Lie algebra might not be nice enough (for example, failure of the exponential map to be onto a neighborhood of the identity). It is the \"nice enough\" that is not universally defined.\nSome of the examples that have been studied include:\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nNotes.\nExplanatory notes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "17946", "revid": "50969462", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=17946", "title": "Lake Erie", "text": "One of the Great Lakes in North America\nLake Erie ( ) is the fourth-largest lake by surface area of the five Great Lakes in North America and the eleventh-largest globally. It is the southernmost, shallowest, and smallest by volume of the Great Lakes and also has the shortest average water residence time. At its deepest point, Lake Erie is deep, making it the only Great Lake whose deepest point is above sea level.\nLocated on the International Boundary between Canada and the United States, Lake Erie's northern shore is the Canadian province of Ontario, specifically the Ontario Peninsula, with the U.S. states of Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and New York on its western, southern, and eastern shores. These jurisdictions divide the surface area of the lake with water boundaries. The largest city on the lake is Cleveland, anchoring the third largest U.S. metro area in the Great Lakes region, after Greater Chicago and Metro Detroit. Other major cities along the lake shore include Buffalo, New York; Erie, Pennsylvania; and Toledo, Ohio.\nSituated below Lake Huron, Erie's primary inlet is the Detroit River. The main natural outflow from the lake is via the Niagara River, which provides hydroelectric power to Canada and the U.S. as it spins huge turbines near Niagara Falls at Lewiston, New York, and Queenston, Ontario. Some outflow occurs via the Welland Canal, part of the Saint Lawrence Seaway, which diverts water for ship passages from Port Colborne, Ontario, on Lake Erie, to St. Catharines on Lake Ontario, an elevation difference of . Lake Erie's environmental health has been an ongoing concern for decades, with issues such as overfishing, pollution, algae blooms, aquatic invasive species, and eutrophication generating headlines.\nGeography.\nGeographic features.\nLake Erie (42.2\u00b0 N, 81.2W) has a mean elevation of above sea level. It has a surface area of with a length of and breadth of at its widest points. It is the shallowest of the Great Lakes with an average depth of 10 fathoms 3 feet or and a maximum depth of Because Erie is the shallowest, it is also the warmest of the Great Lakes, and in 1999 this almost became a problem for two nuclear power plants which require cool lake water to keep their reactors cool. The warm summer of 1999 caused lake temperatures to come close to the limit necessary to keep the plants cool. Also because of its shallowness, it is the first to freeze in the winter. The shallowest section of Lake Erie is the western basin where depths average only ; as a result, \"the slightest breeze can kick up lively waves\", also known as seiches. The \"waves build very quickly\", according to other accounts. The region around the lake is known as the \"thunderstorm capital of Canada\" with \"breathtaking\" lightning displays. Sometimes fierce waves springing up unexpectedly have led to dramatic rescues; in one instance, a Cleveland resident was trapped by churning surf with six foot waves near his dock, but was rescued by a fire department diver from Avon Lake, Ohio:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;In a tug of war against the waves, the two were finally hauled out by rope. After being trapped for an hour-and-a-half, Baker was back on dry land, exhausted and battered but alive.\u2014\u200a\nLake Erie is primarily fed by the Detroit River (from Lake Huron and Lake St. Clair) and drains via the Niagara River and Niagara Falls into Lake Ontario. Navigation downstream is provided by the Welland Canal, part of the Saint Lawrence Seaway. Other major contributors to Lake Erie include Grand River, Huron River, Maumee River, Sandusky River, Cuyahoga River, and Buffalo River. The drainage basin covers .\nPoint Pelee National Park, the southernmost point of the Canadian mainland, is located on a peninsula extending into the lake. Lake Erie has 31 islands (13 in Canada, 18 in the U.S.), located generally in the western side of the lake. The largest of these is Pelee Island.\nWater levels.\nLake Erie has a lake retention time of 2.6 years, the shortest of all the Great Lakes. The lake's surface area is . Lake Erie's water level fluctuates with the seasons as in the other Great Lakes. Generally, the lowest levels are in January and February and the highest in June or July, although there have been exceptions. The average yearly level varies depending on long-term precipitation. Short-term level changes are often caused by seiches that are particularly high when southwesterly winds blow across the length of the lake during storms. These cause water to pile up at the eastern end of the lake. Storm-driven seiches can cause damage onshore. During one storm in November 2003, the water level at Buffalo rose by with waves of for a rise of . Meanwhile, at the western end of the lake, Toledo experienced a similar drop in water level.\nGeology.\nLake Erie was carved out by glacier ice and went through many phases before its current form which is less than 4,000 years old, which is a short span in geological terms. Before this, the land on which the lake now sits went through several complex stages. A large lowland basin formed over two million years ago as a result of an eastern flowing river that existed well before the Pleistocene ice ages. This ancient drainage system was destroyed by the first major glacier in the area, while it deepened and enlarged the lowland areas, allowing water to settle and form a lake. The glaciers were able to carve away more land on the eastern side of the lowland because the bedrock is made of shale which is softer than the carbonate rocks of dolomite and limestone on the western side. Thus, the eastern basin and central basin of the modern lake are much deeper than the western basin, which averages only deep and is rich in nutrients and fish. Lake Erie is the shallowest of the Great Lakes because the ice was relatively thin and lacked erosion power when it reached that far south, according to one view.\nAs many as three glaciers advanced and retreated over the land, causing temporary lakes to form in the time periods in between each of them (see: Lake Whittlesey, Lake Maumee and Lake Arkona). Because each lake had a different volume of water, their shorelines rested at differing elevations. The last lake to form, Lake Warren, existed between about 13,000 and 12,000 years ago. It was deeper than the current Lake Erie, and its shoreline existed about inland from the modern one. Early Lake Erie went through many phases with its ancient sand dunes visible in the Oak Openings Region in Northwest Ohio. There, the sandy dry lake bed soil was not sufficient to support large trees with the exception of a few species of oaks, forming a rare oak savanna.\nHistory.\nIndigenous peoples.\nAt the time of European contact, there were several Indigenous peoples living around the shores of the eastern end of the lake. The Erie tribe (from whom the lake takes its name) lived along the southern edge, while the Neutrals (also known as Attawandaron) lived along the northern shore. The tribal name \"erie\" is a shortened form of the Iroquoian word , meaning \"long tail\". The name may also come from the word \"eri\", meaning \"cherry tree\". Near Port Stanley, there is an Indigenous village dating from the 16th century known as the \"Southwold Earthworks\" where as many as 800 Neutral Indigenous peoples once lived; the archaeological remains include double earth walls winding around the grass-covered perimeter. Europeans named the tribe the \"Neutral Indians\" since these people refused to fight with other tribes.\nBoth the Erie and Neutrals were colonized and assimilated by their hostile eastern neighbors, the Iroquois Confederacy, between 1651 and 1657 during the Beaver Wars. For decades after those wars, the land around eastern Lake Erie was claimed and utilized by the Iroquois as a hunting ground. As the power of the Iroquois waned during the last quarter of the 17th century, several other, mainly Anishinaabe, displaced them from the territories they claimed on the north shore of the lake. There was a legend of an Indigenous woman named Huldah, who, despairing over her lost British lover, hurled herself from a high rock from Pelee Island.\nEuropean exploration and settlement.\nIn 1669, Frenchman Louis Jolliet was the first documented European to sight Lake Erie, although there is speculation that \u00c9tienne Br\u00fbl\u00e9 may have come across it in 1615. Lake Erie was the last of the Great Lakes to be explored by Europeans, since the Iroquois who occupied the Niagara River area were in conflict with the French, and they did not allow explorers or traders to pass through; explorers followed rivers out of Lake Ontario and portaged to Lake Huron. British authorities in Canada were nervous about possible expansion by American settlers across Lake Erie, so Colonel Thomas Talbot developed the Talbot Trail in 1809 as a way to stimulate settlement to the area; Talbot recruited settlers from Ireland and Scotland, and there are numerous places named after him in southern Ontario, such as Port Talbot, the Talbot River, and Talbotville.\nDuring the War of 1812, a United States Navy squadron under Oliver Hazard Perry captured a smaller Royal Navy squadron near Put-in-Bay, Ohio at the 1813 Battle of Lake Erie. As part of the conflict, American troops made repeated raids throughout the Ontario area around Port Rowan, burning towns and villages. Generally, however, with the exceptions of the American Revolutionary War and the War of 1812\u2014which were conflicts between the U.S. and Britain\u2014relations between the U.S. and Canada have been remarkably friendly with an \"unfortified boundary\" and an agreement \"that has kept all fleets of war off the Great Lakes.\"\nIn 1837, rebellions broke about between Canadian settlers and the British Colonial government. These primarily concerned political reforms and land allocation issues. Some of the rebels stationed themselves in the U.S. and crossed the ice from Sandusky Bay to Pelee Island wearing \"tattered overcoats and worn-out boots\", and carrying muskets, pitchforks, and swords, but the islanders had already fled. Later, there was a battle on the ice with the Royal 32nd Regiment, with the rebels being driven to retreat.\nSettlers established commercial fisheries on the north coast of the lake around the 1850s. An important business was fishing. In the pre-Civil War years, railways sprouted everywhere, and around 1852 there were railways circling the lake. Maritime traffic picked up, although the lake was usually closed because of ice from December to early April, and ships had to wait for the ice to clear before proceeding. Since slavery had been abolished in Canada in 1833 but was still legal in southern U.S., a Lake Erie crossing was sometimes required for fugitive slaves seeking freedom:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;When Kentucky fugitive Lewis Clarke arrived in Cleveland, he had no idea how to find Canada. \"I went out to the shore of the lake again and again, to try and see the other side, but I could see no hill, mountain, nor city of the asylum I sought,\" he once told an interviewer. \"I was afraid to inquire where (Canada) was, lest it would betray such a degree of ignorance as to excite suspicion at once.\" Many fugitives also had to overcome fears instilled by their former masters ...\u2014\u200a\nPrior to modern radar and weather forecasting, merchant ships were often caught up in intense gales:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;A violent gale is blowing on Lake Erie ... The schooner \"Stranger\" came in this morning and reports seeing a vessel about up, from the Canada shore, with three men clinging to the masts, which alone were visible above the water\u2013heard their cries and screams ...\u2014\u200a\nThere were reports of disasters usually from sea captains passing information to reporters; in 1868, the captain of the \"Grace Whitney\" saw a sunken vessel with \"three men clinging to the masthead,\" but he could not help because of the gale and high seas.\nA balloonist named John Steiner of Philadelphia made an ambitious trip across the lake in 1857. His voyage was described in \"The New York Times\":\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;He arose to the height of about three miles, and started off at a slow but steady rate ... The lake could be seen from one end to the other nearly ... At one time Mr. Steiner counted 38 sail vessels, all in sight, and far below him. The hands on board several of the vessels saw him, and rightly apprehending that he was an aeronaut, cheered him heartily ... He neared the Canada shore a little below Long Point ... he was accordingly driven towards Buffalo ... Night was drawing on and it became apparent that he could not, with this current, get away from the water before dark, and after nightfall it would not be safe to come down. Seeing a propeller (powered boat) ... the \"Mary Stewart\" ... He first struck the water about 25 miles below Long Point ... During this time Mr. Steiner says he thinks his balloon bounded from the water at least twenty times. It would strike and then rebound, like a ball, going into the air from twenty to fifty feet, and still rushing down the lake at railroad speed ... Mr. Steiner then abandoned the balloon, leaping into the water and swimming towards the boat, which speedily reached him ...\u2014\u200a\nIn 1885, lake winds were so strong that water levels dropped substantially, sometimes by as much as two feet, so that at ports such as Toledo, watercraft could not load coal or depart the port. During the history of the lake as a fishery, there has been marked battling by opposing interest groups:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The preservation of the fisheries of Lake Erie has become a serious problem to all who have given it close attention ... the fisheries are being exhausted by the wasteful methods which are now in vogue ... it is still the custom of the pound fishermen about Sandusky to take fish of all sizes, and if they are too small to be marketable they are turned over to a fertilizer factory. If left undisturbed for two or three years more, these little fish would be a very valuable product ...\u2014\u200a\nPredictions of the lake being over-fished in 1895 were premature, since the fishery has survived commercial and sport fishing, pollution in the middle of the 20th century, invasive species and other ailments, but state and provincial governments, as well as national governments, have played a greater role as time went by. Business boomed; in 1901, the Carnegie Company proposed building a new harbor near Erie, Pennsylvania, in Elk Creek to accommodate shipments from its tube-plant site nearby. In 1913, a memorial to Commodore Oliver Hazard Perry was built on Put-in-Bay island featuring a Doric column.\nSteamships have operated on Lake Erie since the early 1800s. Large, opulent cruise liners carried passengers between Detroit, Cleveland, Buffalo and other cities on the lake until the rise of the automobile in the 1950s drastically cut demand for their services. The Detroit and Cleveland Navigation Company was one of the largest and most renowned of these companies.\nDuring the Prohibition years from 1919 to 1933, a \"great deal of alcohol crossed Erie\" along with \"mobster corpses\" dumped into the Detroit River which sometimes washed up on the beaches of Pelee Island. Notable rum runners included Thomas Joseph McGinty and the Purple Gang. The Coast Guard attempted to interdict the Canadian liquor with its Rum Patrol, and a casino operated on Middle Island.\nDuring the 20th century, commercial fishing was prevalent but so was the boom in manufacturing industry around the lake, and often rivers and streams were used as sewers to flush untreated sewage which ended up in the lake. Sometimes poorly constructed sanitary systems meant that when old pipes broke, raw sewage would spill directly into the Cuyahoga River and into the lake. A report in \"Time\" magazine in 1969 described the lake as a \"gigantic cesspool\" since only three of 62 beaches were rated \"completely safe for swimming\".\nBy 1975 the popular commercial fish blue pike had been declared extinct, although the declaration may have been premature. By the 1980s, there were about 130 fishing vessels with about 3,000 workers, but commercial fishing was declining rapidly, particularly from the American side.\nGreat Lakes Compact.\nIn 2005, the Great Lakes states of Ohio, Michigan, New York, Pennsylvania, Illinois, Indiana, Wisconsin, and Minnesota and the Canadian Provinces of Ontario and Quebec endorsed the Great Lakes-St. Lawrence River Basin Sustainable Water Resources Compact. It was signed into law by President George W. Bush in September 2008. An international water-rights policy overseen by the Great Lakes Commission, the compact aims to prevent diversion of water from Great Lakes to distant states, as well as to set standards for use and conservation. It had support from both political parties, including United States Senator George Voinovich of Ohio and Governor Jennifer Granholm of Michigan, but is not popular in the southwestern states because of frequent drought conditions and water scarcity.\nLake environment.\nClimate.\nLake Erie in winter.\nLike the other Great Lakes, Erie produces lake-effect snow when the first cold winds of winter pass over the warm waters. When the temperatures of the relatively warm surface water and the colder air separate to at least to apart, then \"lake-effect snow becomes possible:\"\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;As cold air flows over the warm water, the lake warms and moistens the air. Since warm, moist air is less dense than cold air, the heated air rises. Rising air cools and water vapor condenses into cloud droplets ... the efficiency of snow production increases when the wind pushes the clouds over land. Friction with the ground causes air to pile up. This frictional convergence creates lift and enhances snowfall.\u2014\u200a\nHeavy lake-effect snowfalls can occur when cold air travels or longer over a large unfrozen lake. Lake-effect snow makes Buffalo and Erie the eleventh and thirteenth-snowiest cities in the contiguous United States, respectively, according to data collected from the National Climatic Data Center. Since winds blow primarily west to east along the main axis of the lake, lake-effect snowstorms are more pronounced on the eastern parts of the lake. Buffalo typically gets of snow each winter and sometimes of snow; the snowiest city is Syracuse, New York, which can receive heavy snowfall from both the lake effect process and large coastal cyclones. A storm around Christmas in 2001 pounded Buffalo with of snow.\nThe effects of the warmer lake water is reduced when the lake freezes over. In January 2011, for example, residents of Cleveland were glad when Lake Erie was \"90 percent frozen\" since it meant that the area had \"made it over the hump\" in terms of enduring repeated snowfalls which required much shoveling. Being the shallowest of the Great Lakes, it is the most likely to freeze and frequently does. In contrast, Lake Michigan has never completely frozen over since the warmer and deeper portion is in the south, although it came close to being totally frozen during three harsh winters over the past century. In past years, lake ice was so thick that it was possible to drive over it or go sailing on iceboats. Many lake residents take advantage of the ice and travel; some drive to Canada and back:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The first ice usually forms in late November, and by January, it locks into place. For islanders in the Western Basin, it is the equivalent of summer vacation ... Once the lake freezes, islanders organize impromptu ice rallies. Families gather to drink hot wine and race all-terrain vehicles across the lake. They also race iceboats, which resemble sailboats on skates ... Many people drive to other islands for dinner with friends. They ride in cars with the roofs and doors chopped off so they can escape if the vehicles fall through the ice. Islanders stab evergreen trees into the ice every to mark a route ... Even in the coldest winters, there are dangerous patches of thin ice. The cracks are so predictable that the Put-in-Bay Ice Yacht Club prints them on a map ... On a normal winter day, the ice is dotted with 2,000 fishing shanties.\u2014\u200a\nWindy conditions.\nStrong winds have caused lake currents to shift sediment on the bottom, leading to shifting sandbars that have been the cause of shipwrecks. But winds can have a peaceful purpose as well; there have been proposals to place electricity\u2013producing wind turbines in windy and shallow points in the lake and along the coast. Steel Winds, a former steel mill site in Buffalo, has been developed as an urban wind farm housing 14 turbines capable of generating up to 35 megawatts of electricity. A plan by Samsung to build an offshore wind farm on the north shore of the lake, from Port Maitland to Nanticoke for a distance of , has been met with opposition from residents. Canadians near Leamington and Kingsville have organized protest groups to thwart attempts to bring wind turbines to the lake; reasons against the turbines include spoiling lake views. Plans to install turbines in Pigeon Bay, south of Leamington were met with opposition as well. The notion that bird and bat migration may be hurt by the wind turbines has been used to argue against the wind turbines as well.\nMicroclimates.\nThe lake is responsible for microclimates that are important to agriculture. Along its north shore is one of the richest areas of Canada's fruit and vegetable production; this southernmost tip, particularly in the area around Leamington, is known as Canada's \"tomato capital\". The area around Port Rowan has special trees that grow because of the \"tempering effect of the lake\", and species include tulip trees, dogwood, sassafras, and sour gum. This area's many greenhouses produce a \"variety of tropical plants rarely cultivated so far north\", including some species of cacti, because of the lake's tempering effect. Along the southeastern shore of Ohio, Pennsylvania, and New York is an important grape-growing region, as are the islands in the lake. Apple orchards are abundant in northeast Ohio to western New York.\nLong-term weather patterns.\nAccording to one estimate, of water evaporate each year from the surface of the lake, which allows for rainfall and other precipitation in surrounding areas. Reports are conflicting about the overall effect of global warming on the Great Lakes region, including Lake Erie. One account suggests that climate change is causing greater evaporation of lake water, leading to warmer temperatures, as well as thinner or nonexistent ice in winter, which is fueling concerns that \"Erie appears to be shrinking\" and is the most likely candidate among the five Great Lakes to \"turn into a festering mud puddle.\" In 2010, the \"Windsor Star\" reported that the lake experienced record-breaking water temperatures, reaching in mid-August and compared the lake to a \"bath tub\".\nEcosystems.\nLake Erie has a complex ecosystem with many species in interaction. Human activity, such as pollution and maritime ship traffic, can affect this environment in numerous ways. The interactions between invasive species can sometimes have beneficial effects, though harmful effects are more likely. Some introductions have been seen as beneficial such as the introduction of Pacific salmon. Occasionally there have been mass die-offs of certain species of fish, sometimes for reasons unknown, such as many numbers of rainbow smelt in May 2010.\nInvasive species.\nThe lake has been plagued with a number of invasive species, including zebra and quagga mussels, the goby, and the grass carp. One estimate was that 180 invasive species are in the Great Lakes, some having traveled in ballast water in international ships. Zebra mussels and gobies have been credited with the increased population and size of smallmouth bass in Lake Erie. In 2008, concerns arose that the \"newest invader swarming in the Great Lakes\", the bloody-red shrimp, might harm fish populations and promote algal blooms.\nEnvironmentalists and biologists study lake conditions via installations such as the Franz Theodore Stone Laboratory on Gibraltar Island. The lab, which was established in 1895, is the oldest biological field station in the United States. Stone Laboratory was donated to the Ohio State University by Julius Stone in 1925 as part of the university's Ohio Sea Grant College program. The Great Lakes Institute of the University of Windsor has experts who study issues such as lake sediment pollution and the flow of contaminants such as phosphorus.\nOther invasive species in Lake Erie include spiny water fleas, fishhook water fleas, sea lamprey, and white perch. The invasive plant species in Lake Erie consist mainly of Eurasian milfoil, \"Trapa natans\" and purple loosestrife. The shore of the lake is also host to invasive species of the \"Phragmites\" reed genus.\nEutrophication and cyanobacterial blooms.\nAn ongoing concern is that nutrient overloading from fertilizers and human and animal waste, known as eutrophication, in which additional nitrogen and phosphorus enter the lake, will cause plant life to \"run wild and multiply like crazy\". Since fewer wetlands remain to filter nutrients, and greater channelization of waterways, nutrients in water can cause algal blooms to sprout, with \"low-oxygen dead zones\" in a complex interaction of natural forces. As of the 2010s, much of the phosphorus in the lake comes from fertilizer applied to no-till soybean and corn fields, but washed into streams by heavy rains. The algal blooms result from growth of \"Microcystis\", a toxic blue-green alga that the zebra mussels, which infest the lake, do not eat.\nPeriodically, a \"dead zone\", or region of low oxygen, occurs in the lake, the location of which varies. Scientists from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration have been studying the lake's blue-green algal blooms and trying to find ways to predict when they are spreading or where they might make landfall; typically, the blooms arrive late each summer. This problem was extreme in the mid- and late 1960s, and the Lake Erie Wastewater Management Study conducted by the Buffalo District of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers determined that the eutrophication was caused by point sources such as industrial outfalls and municipal sanitary and storm sewer outfalls, as well as diffuse sources, such as overland runoff from farm and forest land. All of these sources contribute nutrients, primarily phosphorus, to the lake. Growth of organisms in the lake is then spiked to the point that oxygen levels are depleted. Recommendations were made for reducing point-source outflows, and reducing farm contributions of phosphorus by changing fertilizer usage, employing no-till farming, and other conservative practices. Many industrial and municipal sources have since been greatly reduced. The improved farming practices, which were voluntary, were followed for a while, resulting in remarkable recovery of the lake in the 1970s.\nThe conservation practices are not monitored and have not been kept up. One recent account suggests that the seasonal algal blooms in Lake Erie were possibly caused by runoff from cities, fertilizers, zebra mussels, and livestock near water. A second report focuses on the zebra mussels as being the cause of dead zones, since they filter so much sediment that this produces an overgrowth of algae. One report suggests the oxygen-poor zone began about 1993 in the lake's central basin and becomes more pronounced during summer, but is somewhat of a mystery why this happens. Some scientists speculate that the dead zone is a naturally occurring phenomenon. Another report cites Ohio's Maumee River as the main source of polluted runoff of phosphorus from industries, municipalities, tributaries and agriculture, and in 2008, satellite images showed the algal bloom heading toward Pelee Island. Two two-year, $2\u00a0million studies are trying to understand the \"growing zone\", which was described as a 10-foot-thick layer of cold water at the bottom, in one area, which stretches across the lake's center. It kills fish and microscopic creatures of the lake's food chain and fouls the water, and may cause further problems in later years for sport and commercial fishing.\nAlgal blooms continued in early 2013, but new farming techniques, climate change, and even a change in Lake Erie's ecosystem make phosphorus pollution more intractable. Blue-green algae (Cyanobacteria) bloom, were problematic in August 2019. According to a news report in August, \"scientists fully expect [it] to overwhelm much of western Lake Erie again this summer\". By August 12, 2019, the bloom extended for roughly . A large bloom does not necessarily mean the cyanobacteria ... will produce toxins\", said Michael McKay, executive director of the Great Lakes Institute for Environmental Research at the University of Windsor. \"Not enough is being done to stop fertilizer and phosphorus from getting into the lake and causing blooms,\" he added. Water testing was being conducted in August. The largest Lake Erie blooms to date occurred in 2015, exceeding the severity index at 10.5 and in 2011 at a 10, according to the NOAA. In early August, the 2019 bloom was expected to measure 7.5 on the severity index, but could range between 6 and 9. At that time, satellite images depicted a bloom stretching up to on Lake Erie, with the epicenter near Toledo, Ohio.\nSnakes.\nThe Lake Erie water snake, a subspecies of the northern water snake (\"Nerodia sipedon\"), lives in the vicinity of Ohio's Put-in-Bay Harbor and had been placed on the threatened species list. By 2010, the water snake population was over 12,000 snakes. While they have a nonvenomous bite, they are a key predator in the lake's aquatic ecosystem since they feed on mudpuppies, walleye, and smallmouth bass. The snake is helpful in keeping the population of goby fish in check. They mate from late May through early June and can be found in large mating balls with one female bunched within several males.\nInsects and birds.\nIn 1999, a local TV station's Doppler weather radar detected millions of mayflies heading for Presque Isle in blue and green splotches on the radar in clouds measuring long. These insects were a sign of Lake Erie's move back to health, since the mayflies require clean water to thrive. Biologist Masteller of Pennsylvania State University declared the insects to be a \"nice nuisance\" since they signified the lake's return to health after 40 years of absence. Each is long; the three main species of mayflies are \"Ephemera simulans\", \"Hexagenia rigida\", and \"H. limbata\". The insects mate over a 72-hour period from June through September; they fly in masses up to the shore, mate in the air, then females lay up to 8,000 eggs each over the water; the eggs sink back down and the cycle repeats. Sometimes, the clouds of mayflies have caused power outages and caused roads to become slippery with squashed insects. Zebra mussels filtering extra nutrients from the lake allows the mayfly larvae to thrive.\nIncidents of birds dying from botulism have occurred, in 2000 and in 2002. Birds affected included grebes, common and red-breasted mergansers, loons, diving ducks, ring-billed gulls, and herring gulls. One account suggests that bird populations are in trouble, notably the wood warbler, which had population declines around 60% in 2008. Possible causes for declines in bird populations are farming practices, loss of habitats, soil depletion and erosion, and toxic chemicals. In 2006, concerns arose of possible avian influenza (bird flu) after two wild swans on the lake were found diseased, but they did not contain the H5N1 virus. Sightings of a magnificent frigatebird, a tropical bird with a 2 m wingspan, happened over the lake in 2008.\nWater quality issues and restoration.\nLake Erie infamously became very polluted in the 1960s and 1970s as a result of the quantity of heavy industry situated in cities on its shores, with reports of bacteria-laden beaches and fish contaminated by industrial waste. In the 1970s, patches of the lake were declared dead because of industrial waste and sewage from runoffs; as \"The New York Times\" reporter Denny Lee wrote in 2004, \"The lake, after all, is where the Rust Belt meets the water.\"\nIncidents occurred of the oily surfaces of tributary rivers emptying into Lake Erie catching fire: in 1969, Cleveland's Cuyahoga River erupted in flames, chronicled in a \"Time\" magazine article which lamented a tendency to use rivers flowing through major cities as \"convenient, free sewers\"; the Detroit River caught fire on another occasion. The outlook was gloomy:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Each day, Detroit, Cleveland and 120 other municipalities fill Erie with of \"inadequately treated wastes, including nitrates and phosphates ... These chemicals act as fertilizer for growths of algae that suck oxygen from the lower depths and rise to the surface as odoriferous green scum ... Commercial and game fish\u2014blue pike, whitefish, sturgeon, northern pike\u2014have nearly vanished, yielding the waters to trash fish that need less oxygen. Weeds proliferate, turning water frontage into swamp. In short, Lake Erie is in danger of dying by suffocation.\u2014\u200a\nIn December 1970, a federal grand jury investigation led by U.S. Attorney Robert Jones began, of water pollution allegedly being caused by about 12 companies in northeastern Ohio. It was the first grand jury investigation of water pollution in the area. The grand jury indicted four corporations for polluting Lake Erie and waterways in northeast Ohio. Facing fines were Cleveland Electric Illuminating Co., Shell Oil Co., Uniroyal Chemical Division of Uniroyal Inc. and Olin Corp. United States Attorney General John N. Mitchell gave a press conference December 18, 1970, referencing new pollution control litigation, with particular reference to work with the Environmental Protection Agency, and announcing the filing of a lawsuit that morning against the Jones and Laughlin Steel Corporation for discharging substantial quantities of cyanide into the Cuyahoga River near Cleveland. Jones filed the misdemeanor charges in district court, alleging violations of the 1899 Rivers and Harbors Act.\nCleveland's director of public utilities Ben Stefanski pursued a massive effort to \"scrub the Cuyahoga\"; the effort cost $100\u00a0million in bonds, according to one estimate. New sewer lines were built. Clevelanders approved a bond issue by 2 to 1 to upgrade Cleveland's sewage system. Federal officials acted as well: the United States Congress passed the Clean Water Act of 1972, and the United States and Canada established water pollution limits in an international water quality agreement. The Corps' LEWMS was also instituted at that time.\nThe clearing of the water column is partly the result of the introduction and rapid spread of zebra mussels from Europe, which had the effect of covering the lake bottom, with each creature filtering a liter of fresh water each day, helping to restore the lake to a cleaner state. The 1972 Great Lakes Water Quality Agreement significantly reduced the dumping and runoff of phosphorus into the lake. The lake has since become clean enough to allow sunlight to infiltrate its water and produce algae and seaweed, but a dead zone persists. There have been instances of beach closings at Presque Isle because of unexplained E. Coli contaminations, possibly caused by sewer water overflows after heavy downpours.\nSince the 1970s environmental regulation has led to a great increase in water quality and the return of economically important fish species such as walleye and other biological life. There was substantial evidence that the new controls had substantially reduced levels of DDT in the water by 1979. Cleanup efforts were described in 1979 as a notable environmental success story, suggesting that the cumulative effect of legislation, studies, and bans had reversed the effects of pollution:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The globs of oil, the multicolored industrial discharges, the flotsam from shoreline cities, the fecal and bacterial wastes are no longer dumped in the lakes in vast quantities.\u2014\u200a\nJoint U.S.\u2013Canadian agreements pushed 600 of 864 major industrial dischargers to meet requirements for keeping the water clean. One estimate was that $5\u00a0billion was spent to upgrade plants to treat sewage. The change toward cleaner water has been in a positive direction since the 1970s.\nThere was a tentative exploratory plan to capture CO2, compress it to a liquid form, and pump it a half-mile (800 m) beneath Lake Erie's surface underneath the porous rock structure. According to chemical engineer Peter Douglas, there is sufficient storage space beneath Lake Erie to hold between 15 and 50 years of liquid CO2 emissions from the 4,000 megawatt Nanticoke coal plant. But there has been no substantial progress on this issue since 2007.\nEconomy.\nFishing.\nSpecies of fish.\nLake Erie is home to one of the world's largest freshwater commercial fisheries. Lake Erie's fish populations are the most abundant of the Great Lakes, partially because of the lake's relatively mild temperatures and plentiful supply of plankton, which is the basic building block of the food chain. The lake's fish population accounts for an estimated 50% of all fish inhabiting the Great Lakes. The lake contains steelhead, walleye (known in Canada as pickerel), largemouth bass, smallmouth bass, perch, lake trout, king salmon, whitefish, smelt, and many others. The lake consists of a long list of well established introduced species. Common non-indigenous fish species include the rainbow smelt, alewife, white perch and common carp. Non-native sport fish such as rainbow trout and brown trout are stocked specifically for anglers to catch. Attempts failed to stock coho salmon, and its numbers are dwindling. Commercial landings are dominated by yellow perch and walleye, with substantial quantities of rainbow smelt and white bass also taken. Anglers target walleye and yellow perch, with some effort directed at rainbow trout.\nUp until the end of the 1950s, the most commonly caught commercial fish (more than 50% of the commercial catch) was a subspecies of the walleye known as the blue walleye (\"Sander vitreus glaucus\") sometimes erroneously called \"blue pike\". In the 1970s and 1980s, as pollution in the lake declined, counts of walleyes which were caught grew from 112,000 in 1975 to 4.1\u00a0million in 1985, with estimates of the numbers of walleyes in the lake at around 33 million in the basin, with many of or more. Not all walleyes thrived. The combination of overfishing and the eutrophication of the lake by pollution caused the population to collapse, and in the mid-1980s, the blue walleye was declared extinct. But the Lake Erie walleye was reportedly having record numbers, even in 1989, according to one report.\nThere have been concerns about rising levels of mercury in walleye fish; a study by the Canadian Ministry of the Environment noted an \"increasing concentration trend\" but that concentrations were within acceptable limits established by authorities in Pennsylvania. Because of the threat of PCBs, It was recommended, that persons eat no more than one walleye meal per month. Because of these and other concerns, in 1990, the National Wildlife Federation was on the verge of having a \"negative fish consumption \"advisory\"\" for walleye and smallmouth bass, which had been the main catch of an $800\u00a0million commercial fishing industry.\nThe longest fish in Lake Erie is reportedly the sturgeon which can grow to long and weight , but it is an endangered species and mostly lives on the bottom of the lake. In 2009, there was a confirmed instance of a sturgeon being caught, which was returned to the lake alive, and there are hopes that the population of sturgeons is resurging.\nCommercial fishing.\nEstimates vary about the fishing market for the Great Lakes region. In 2007, one estimate of the total market for fishing in the Great Lakes, including commercial and recreational fishing, was $4\u00a0billion annually. Another estimate was more than $7\u00a0billion. But since high levels of pollution were discovered in the 1960s and 1970s, there has been continued debate over the desired intensity of commercial fishing. Commercial fishing in Lake Erie has been hurt by pollution as well as government regulations which limit the size of their catch; one report suggested that the numbers of fishing boats and employees had declined by two-thirds in recent decades. Another concern had been that pollution in the lake, as well as toxins found inside fish, were working against commercial fishing interests.\nU.S. fishermen based along Lake Erie lost their livelihood over the past few decades and no longer catch fish such as whitefish for markets in New York. Pennsylvania had a special $3 stamp on fishing licenses to help \"compensate commercial fishermen for their losses\", but this program ended after five years. One blamed the commercial fishing ban on a \"test of wills\" between commercial and recreational fishermen: \"One side needed large hauls. The other feared the lake was being emptied.\"\nCommercial fishing is now predominantly based in Canadian communities, with a much smaller fishery\u2014largely restricted to yellow perch\u2014in Ohio. The Ontario fishery is one of the most intensively managed in the world. However, there are reports that some Canadian commercial fishermen are dissatisfied with fishing quotas and have sued the government about this matter, and there have been complaints that the legislative body writing the quotas is dominated by the U.S. and that sport fishing interests are favored at the expense of commercial fishing interests. Cuts of 30 to 45 percent for certain fish were made in 2007. The Lake Erie fishery was one of the first fisheries in the world managed on individual transferable quotas and features mandatory daily catch reporting and intensive auditing of the catch reporting system. Still, the commercial fishery is the target of critics who would like to see the lake managed for the exclusive benefit of sport fishing and the various industries serving the sport fishery. According to one report, the Canadian town of Port Dover is the home of the lake's largest fishing fleet.\nGovernment regulations.\nThe lake can be thought of as a common asset with multiple purposes, including being a fishery. There was direct competition between commercial fishermen and sport fishermen (including charter boats and sales of fishing licenses) throughout the lake's history, with both sides seeking government assistance from either Washington or Ottawa, and trying to make their case to the public through newspaper reporting. But other groups have entered the political process as well, including environmentalists, lakefront property owners, industry owners and workers seeking cost-effective solutions for sewage, ferry boat operators, even corporations making electric-generating wind turbines.\nManagement of the fishery is by consensus of all management agencies with an interest in the resource and work under the mandate of the Great Lakes Fishery Commission. The commission makes assessments using sophisticated mathematical modeling systems. The commission has been the focus of considerable recrimination, primarily from angler and charter fishing groups in the U.S. which have had a historical antipathy to commercial fishing interests. This conflict is complex, dating from the 1960s and earlier, with the result in the United States that, in 2011, commercial fishing was mostly eliminated from Great Lakes states. One report suggests that battling between diverse fishing interests began around Lake Michigan and evolved to cover the entire Great Lakes region. The analysis suggests that in the Lake Erie context, the competition between sport and commercial fishing involves universals and that these conflicts are cultural, not scientific, and therefore not resolvable by reference to ecological data.\nSport fishing.\nThe lake supports a strong sport fishery. While commercial fishing declined, sport fishing has remained. The deep cool waters that spawn the best fishing is in the Canadian side of the lake. As a result, a fishing boat that crosses the international border triggers the security concerns of border crossings, and fishermen are advised to carry their passport. If their boat crosses the invisible border line in the lake, upon returning to the American shore, passengers need to report to a local border protection office.\nIn 2008, the Pennsylvania Fish and Boat Commission tried stocking the lake with brown trout in an effort to build what's called a \"put-grow-and-take\" fishery. There was a report that charter boat fishing increased substantially on the American side, from 46 to 638 charter boats in operation in Ohio alone, during a period from 1975 to 1985 as pollution levels declined and after populations of walleye increased substantially in the lake. In 1984, Ohio sold 27,000 nonresident fishing permits, and sport fishing was described as big business. In 1992, there were accounts of fishermen regularly catching walleye weighing up to . It is possible to fish off piers in winter for burbot; the burbot make a midwinter spawning run and is reportedly one of Erie's glacial relics.\nIce fishing.\nIn winter when the lake freezes, many fishermen go out on the ice, cut holes, and fish. It is even possible to build bonfires on the ice. But venturing on Lake Erie ice can be dangerous. In a 2009 incident, warming temperatures, winds of and currents pushing eastward dislodged a miles-wide ice floe which broke away from the shore, trapping more than 130 fishermen offshore; one man died while the rest were rescued by helicopters or boats.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The day began with fishermen setting down wooden pallets to create a bridge over a crack in the ice so they could roam farther out on the lake. But the planks fell into the water when the ice shifted, stranding the fishermen about 1,000 yards offshore ... When fishermen realized late Saturday morning that the ice had broken away, they began to debate the best way off. Some chose to sit and wait for authorities, while others headed east in search of an ice bridge ... Others managed to get to land on their own by riding their all-terrain vehicles about five miles east to where ice hadn't broken away. ... When the rescued fishermen made it to shore, authorities had them line up single-file to take down their names.\nAgriculture.\nThe lake's formerly more extensive lakebed creates a favorable environment for agriculture in the bordering areas of Ontario, Ohio, Michigan, Pennsylvania, and New York. The Lake Erie sections of western New York have a suitable climate for growing grapes, and there are many vineyards and wineries in Chautauqua County and Erie County. The Canadian region of Lake Erie's north shore is becoming a more prominent wine region as well; it has been dubbed the Lake Erie North Shore, or LENS region, and includes Pelee Island, and since it is farther north than comparable wine-growing areas in the world, the length of the days in the summer are longer. A longer growing season because of the lake-moderated temperatures make the risk of early frosts less likely.\nThe drainage basin has led to well fertilized soil. The north coast of Ohio is widely referred to as its nursery capital.\nTourism.\nDiving for shipwrecks.\nLake Erie is a favorite for divers since there are many shipwrecks, perhaps 1,400 to 8,000 according to one estimate, of which about 270 are confirmed shipwreck locations. Research into shipwrecks has been organized by the Peachman Lake Erie Shipwreck Research Center, located on the grounds of the Great Lakes Historical Society. Most wrecks are undiscovered but believed to be well preserved and at most below the water surface. One report suggests there are more wrecks per square mile than any other freshwater location, including wrecks from Indigenous watercraft. There are efforts to identify shipwreck sites and survey the lake floor to map the location of underwater sites, possibly for further study or exploration. While the lake is relatively warmer than the other Great Lakes, there is a thermocline, meaning that as a diver descends, the water temperature drops about , requiring a wetsuit. One estimate is that Lake Erie has a quarter of all 8,000 estimated shipwrecks in the Great Lakes. They are preserved because the water is cold and salt-free. Divers have a policy of not removing or touching anything at the wreck. The cold conditions make diving difficult, requiring divers with skill and experience. One charter firm from western New York State takes about 1,500 divers to Lake Erie shipwrecks in a typical season from April through October.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Among the diving community, they are considered world class, offering opportunities to visit an underwater museum that most people will never see.\u2014\u200a\nIn 1991, the 19th-century paddle steamer \"Atlantic\" was discovered. It had sunk in 1852 after a collision with the steamship \"Ogdensburg\", west of Long Point, Ontario, and survivors from \"Atlantic\" were saved by the crew of \"Ogdensburg\". One account suggests 130 people drowned while another suggests about 20 drowned. There was speculation that the sunken vessel had been a gambling ship, and therefore there might have been money aboard, but most historians were skeptical.\nIn 1998, the wreckage of \"Adventure\" became the first shipwreck registered as an \"underwater archaeological site\"; when it was discovered that \"Adventure\"'s propeller had been removed and given to a junkyard. The propeller was reclaimed days before being converted to scrap metal and brought back to the dive site. In 2003, divers discovered the steamer \"Canobie\" near Presque Isle, which had sunk in 1921. Other wrecks include the fish tub \"Neal H. Dow\" (1910), the \"steamer-cum-barge\" \"Elderado\" (1880), \"W. R. Hanna\", \"Dundee\" which sank north of Cleveland in 1900, \"F. H. Prince\", and \"The Craftsman\". In 2007, the wreck of the steamship named after \"Mad\" Anthony Wayne was found near Vermilion, Ohio, in of water; the vessel sank in 1850 after its boilers exploded, and 38 people died. The wreck belongs to the state of Ohio, and salvaging it is illegal, but divers can visit. In addition, there are wrecks of smaller vessels, with occasional drownings of fishermen.\nPublic parks.\nThere are numerous public parks around the lake. In western Pennsylvania, a wildlife reserve was established in 1991 in Springfield Township for hiking, fishing, cross-country skiing and walking along the beach. In Ontario, Long Point is a peninsula on the northwest shore near Port Rowan that extends into Lake Erie which is a stopover for birds migrating as well as turtles; Long Point Provincial Park is located there and has been designated as a UNESCO Biosphere reserve. In Ontario's Sand Hill Park, east of Port Burwell, there is a high dune which people climb for picturesque views of the lake. In southern Michigan, Sterling State Park has campgrounds, for hiking, biking, fishing, boating, with a sand beach for sunbathing, swimming, and picnicking.\nBiking.\nIn 1997, \"The New York Times\" reporter Donna Marchetti took a bike tour around the Lake Erie perimeter, traveling per day and staying at bed and breakfasts. She biked through the cities of Cleveland, Erie, Windsor, Detroit and Toledo as well as resort towns, vineyards, and cornfields. The trip highlights were the \"small port towns and rural farmlands of southern Ontario\". There are few bike repair shops in Ontario on the route.\nIslands.\nLake Erie islands tend to be in the westernmost part of the lake and have different characters. Some of them include:\nWater sports.\nKayaking has become more popular along the lake, particularly in places such as Put-in-Bay, Ohio. There are extensive views with steep cliffs with exotic wildlife and extensive shoreline. Long-distance swimmers have swum across the lake to set records; for example, a 15-year-old amputee swam the stretch across the lake in 2001. In 2008, 14-year-old Jade Scognamillo swam from New York's Sturgeon Point to Ontario's Crystal Beach and completed the 11.9-mile (19.2-km) swim in five hours, 40 minutes and 35 seconds, and became the youngest swimmer to make the crossing. It is illegal for swimmers younger than 14 to attempt such a crossing. In Port Dover, Ontario, swimmers do high-dives at the annual \"Polar Bear Swim\" on the beach. Currents can pose a problem, and there have been occasional incidents of drownings.\nLighthouses.\nThe lake is dotted by distinct lighthouses. A lighthouse off the coast of Cleveland, beset with cold lake winter spray, has an unusual artistic icy shape, although sometimes ice prevents the light from being seen by maritime vessels.\nFolklore.\nThere have been unconfirmed reports of persons spotting a creature akin to the Loch Ness Monster, beginning in the 19th century and sometimes called \"Bessie\" or \"South Bay Bessie\". There were reports in 1990 of people seeing a \"large creature moving in the water about from their boat\" described as black in color, about long, with a snakelike head, and moving as fast as a boat. Five other people reported seeing something similar on three separate occasions, but there is no scientific evidence of such a creature. There is a \"Lake Erie Monster\" beer and a Cleveland Monsters hockey team.\nThere have been sporadic reports of people in Cleveland being able to see the Canadian shoreline as if it were immediately offshore, even though Canada is from Cleveland. It has been speculated that this is a weather-related phenomenon, working on similar principles as a mirage.\nShipping traffic.\nThe lake has been a shipping lane for maritime vessels for centuries. Ships headed eastward can take the Welland Canal and a series of eight locks descending to Lake Ontario which takes about 12 hours. Thousands of ships make this journey each year. During the 19th century, ships could enter the Buffalo River and travel the Erie Canal eastward to Albany then south to New York City along the Hudson River. Generally there is heavy traffic on the lake except during the winter months from January through March when ice prevents vessels from traveling safely.\nIn 2007, there was a protest against Ontario's energy policy which allows the shipping of coal in the lake; Greenpeace activists climbed a ladder on a freighter and \"locked themselves to the conveyor belt device that helps to unload the ship's cargo\"; three activists were arrested and the ship was delayed for more than four hours, and anti-coal messages were painted on the ship.\nFerryboats.\nFerryboats operate in numerous places: such as the passenger-only Jet Express Ferry from Sandusky and Port Clinton to Put-in-Bay and Kelly's Island. The Miller Ferry from Catawba Island to Put-In-Bay and Middle Bass Island, the Kellys Island ferry from Marblehead to Kellys Island, and the Owen Sound Transportation Company from Leamington or Kingsville to Pelee Island and Sandusky.\nHowever, plans to operate a ferryboat between the U.S. port of Erie and the Ontario port of Port Dover ran into a slew of political problems, including security restrictions on both sides as well as additional fees required to hire border inspectors. The project was abandoned.\nThe Great Lakes Circle Tour is a designated scenic road system connecting all of the Great Lakes and the Saint Lawrence River. Drivers can cross from the United States to the Canadian town of Fort Erie by going over the Peace Bridge.\nBorder crossings.\nSince the border between the two nations is largely unpatrolled, it is possible for people to cross undetected from one country to the other, in either direction, by boat. In 2010, Canadian police arrested persons crossing the border illegally from the United States to Canada, near the Ontario town of Amherstburg.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It is bounded on the north, west, and southwest by the Canadian province of Ontario, and on the south and east by the U.S. state of New York. The Canada\u2013United States border spans the centre of the lake. On the Canadian side, the major cities are Kingston, Mississauga, Toronto, Hamilton, and St. Catharines. On the American side, the major cities are Rochester and Watertown.\nThe last in the Great Lakes chain, Lake Ontario serves as the outlet to the Atlantic Ocean via the Saint Lawrence River, comprising the western end of the Saint Lawrence Seaway. Its primary inlet is the Niagara River from Lake Erie. The Long Sault control dam, primarily along with the Moses-Saunders Power Dam regulates the water level of the lake.\nThe name \"Ontar\u00ed'io\" is most often translated from Huron as \"beautiful lake\", but other translations exist.\nGeography.\nLake Ontario is the easternmost of the Great Lakes and the smallest in surface area (), although it exceeds Lake Erie in volume ( to ). It is the 13th-largest lake in the world. When its islands are included, the lake's shoreline is long. As the last lake in the Great Lakes' hydrologic chain, Lake Ontario has the lowest mean surface elevation of the lakes at above sea level; lower than its neighbor upstream. Its maximum length is , and its maximum width is . The lake's average depth is 47 fathoms 1 foot (283\u00a0ft; 86 m), with a maximum depth of 133 fathoms 4 feet (802\u00a0ft; 244 m) in the Rochester Basin. The lake's primary source is the Niagara River, draining Lake Erie, with the Saint Lawrence River serving as the outlet. The drainage basin covers 24,720\u00a0square\u00a0miles (64,030\u00a0km2). As with all the Great Lakes, water levels change both within the year (owing to seasonal changes in water input) and among years (owing to longer-term trends in precipitation). These water level fluctuations are an integral part of lake ecology and produce and maintain extensive wetlands. The lake also has an important freshwater fishery, although it has been negatively affected by factors including overfishing, water pollution and invasive species.\nBaymouth bars built by prevailing winds and currents have created a significant number of lagoons and sheltered harbors, mostly near (but not limited to) Prince Edward County, Ontario, and the easternmost shores. Perhaps the best-known example is Toronto Bay, chosen as the site of the Upper Canada capital for its strategic harbor. Other prominent examples include Hamilton Harbour, Irondequoit Bay, Presqu'ile Bay, and Sodus Bay. The bars themselves are the sites of long beaches, such as Sandbanks Provincial Park and Sandy Island Beach State Park. These sand bars are often associated with large wetlands, which support large numbers of plant and animal species, as well as providing important rest areas for migratory birds. Presqu'ile, on the north shore of Lake Ontario, is particularly significant in this regard. One unique feature of the lake is the Z-shaped Bay of Quinte which separates Prince Edward County from the Ontario mainland, save for a isthmus near Trenton; this feature also supports many wetlands and aquatic plants, as well as associated fisheries.\nMajor rivers draining into Lake Ontario include the Niagara River, Don River, Humber River, Rouge River, Trent River, Cataraqui River, Genesee River, Oswego River, Black River, Little Salmon River, Credit River, Ganaraska River and the Salmon River.\nThe Welland Canal also drains into the lake.\nGeology.\nThe lake basin was carved out of soft, weak Silurian-age rocks by the Wisconsin ice sheet during the last ice age. The action of the ice occurred along the pre-glacial Ontarian River valley which had approximately the same orientation as today's basin. Material that was pushed southward by the ice sheet left landforms such as drumlins, kames, and moraines, both on the modern land surface and the lake bottom, reorganizing the region's entire drainage system. As the ice sheet retreated toward the north, it still dammed the St. Lawrence Valley outlet, so the lake surface was at a higher level. This stage is known as Lake Iroquois. During that time the lake drained through present-day Syracuse, New York, into the Mohawk River, thence to the Hudson River and the Atlantic. The shoreline created during this stage can be easily recognized by the (now dry) beaches and wave-cut hills from the present shoreline.\nWhen the ice finally receded from the St. Lawrence valley, the outlet was below sea level, and for a short time, the lake became a bay of the Atlantic Ocean, in association with the Champlain Sea. Gradually the land rebounded from the release of the weight of about of ice that had been stacked on it. It is still rebounding about per century in the St. Lawrence area. Since the ice receded from the area last, the most rapid rebound still occurs there. This means the lake bed is gradually tilting southward, inundating the south shore and turning river valleys into bays. Both north and south shores experience shoreline erosion, but the tilting amplifies this effect on the south shore, causing loss to property owners.\nClimate.\nThe lake has a natural seiche rhythm of eleven minutes. The seiche effect normally is only about but can be greatly amplified by earth movement, winds, and atmospheric pressure changes. Because of its great depth, the lake as a whole does not completely freeze in winter, but an ice sheet covering between 10% and 90% of the lake area typically develops, depending on the severity of the winter. Ice sheets typically form along the shoreline and in slack water bays, where the lake is not as deep. During the winters of 1877 and 1878, the ice sheet coverage was up to 95\u2013100% of the lake. During the War of 1812, the ice cover was stable enough the American naval commander stationed at Sackets Harbor feared a British attack from Kingston, over the ice. The lake has completely frozen over on five recorded occasions: in 1830, 1874, 1893, 1912, and 1934.\nWhen the cold winds of winter pass over the warmer water of the lake, they pick up moisture and drop it as lake-effect snow. Since the prevailing winter winds are from the northwest, the southern and southeastern shoreline of the lake is referred to as the snowbelt. In some winters, the area between Oswego and Pulaski may receive twenty or more feet (600\u00a0cm) of snowfall. Also impacted by lake-effect snow is the Tug Hill Plateau, an area of elevated land about east of Lake Ontario. The \"Hill\", as it is often referred to, typically receives more snow than any other region in the eastern United States. As a result, Tug Hill is a popular location for winter enthusiasts, such as snow-mobilers and cross-country skiers. Lake-effect snow often extends inland as far as Syracuse, with that city often recording the most winter snowfall accumulation of any large city in the United States. Other cities in the world receive more snow annually, such as Quebec City, which averages , and Sapporo, Japan, which receives each year and is often regarded as the snowiest city in the world.\nFoggy conditions (particularly in fall) can be created by thermal contrasts and can be an impediment for recreational boaters. Lake breezes in spring tend to slow fruit bloom until the frost danger is past, and in the autumn delay the onset of fall frost, particularly on the south shore. Cool onshore winds also slow the early bloom of plants and flowers until later in the spring season, protecting them from possible frost damage. Such microclimatic effects have enabled tender fruit production in a continental climate, with the southwest shore supporting a major fruit-growing area. Apples, cherries, pears, plums, and peaches are grown in many commercial orchards around Rochester. Between Stoney Creek and Niagara-on-the-Lake on the Niagara Peninsula is a major fruit-growing and wine-making area. The wine-growing region extends over the international border into Niagara and Orleans counties in New York. Apple varieties that tolerate a more extreme climate are grown on the lake's north shore, around Cobourg.\nEcology.\nThe Great Lakes watershed is a region of high biodiversity, and Lake Ontario is important for its diversity of birds, fish, reptiles, amphibians, and plants. Many of these special species are associated with shorelines, particularly sand dunes, lagoons, and wetlands. The importance of wetlands to the lake has been appreciated, and many of the larger wetlands have protected status. These wetlands are changing, partly because the natural water level fluctuations have been reduced. Many wetland plants are dependent upon low water levels to reproduce. When water levels are stabilized, the area and diversity of the marsh is reduced. This is particularly true of meadow marsh (also known as wet meadow wetlands); for example, in Eel Bay near Alexandria Bay, regulation of lake levels has resulted in large losses of wet meadow. Often this is accompanied by the invasion of cattails, which displace many of the native plant species and reduce plant diversity. Eutrophication may accelerate this process by providing nitrogen and phosphorus for the more rapid growth of competitively dominant plants. Similar effects are occurring on the north shore, in wetlands such as Presqu'ile, which have interdunal wetlands called pannes, with high plant diversity and many unusual plant species.\nMost of the forests around the lake are deciduous forests dominated by trees including maple, oak, beech, ash and basswood. These are classified as part of the Mixedwood Plains Ecozone by Environment Canada, or as the Eastern Great Lakes and Hudson Lowlands by the United States Environmental Protection Agency, or as the Great Lakes Ecoregion by The Nature Conservancy. Deforestation in the vicinity of the lake has had many negative impacts, including loss of forest birds, extinction of native salmon, and increased amounts of sediment flowing into the lake. In some areas, more than 90 percent of the forest cover has been removed and replaced by agriculture. Certain tree species, such as hemlock, have also been particularly depleted by past logging activity. Guidelines for restoration stress the importance of maintaining and restoring forest cover, particularly along streams and wetlands.\nBy the 1960s and 1970s, the increased pollution caused frequent algal blooms to occur in the summer. These blooms killed large numbers of fish, and left decomposing piles of filamentous algae and dead fish along the shores.\nWater pollution.\nLake Ontario is the most downstream lake of the Great Lakes, so the pollution from all the other lakes flows into it. Lake Ontario was ranked as the most environmentally stressed amongst the five Great Lakes in a 2015 ecological study. Some of the stresses on the lake include excess application of fertilizers in agriculture running into the lake, spillover from obsolete municipal sewage systems, toxic chemicals from industries along the rivers that drain into the lake, and metropolitan drainage from big cities like Toronto, Rochester, and Hamilton.\nRandle Reef, the westernmost part of Lake Ontario, has been identified as one of the most contaminated areas on Lake Ontario alongside other areas of concern on Great Lakes. However, a $150-million cleanup project had begun in 2016 and is expected to be completed by 2025.\nHuman history.\nThe name Ontario is derived from the Huron word \"Ontar\u00ed'io\", which is often translated as \"great lake\". In Colonial times, the lake was also called \"Cataraqui\", a French spelling of the Mohawk \"Katarokwi\". The first archaeologically evidence of humans in the Lake Ontario region dates to circa 11,000 BP. These peoples were mobile foragers who based much of their movement and settlement on the seasonal migrations of caribou, but who also used smaller animals and plant resources. These early settlers likely inhabited the lake margins, but those early lake shores are now either far from the current lake representing earlier, higher waters, or submerged under the modern lake, representing periods of lower lake levels. Lake Ontario reached its modern level circa 4000 BP. The lake was a border between the Huron people and the Iroquois Confederacy in the pre-Columbian era. In the 17th century, the Iroquois committed genocide against the Huron in southern Ontario and settled the northern shores of Lake Ontario. When the Iroquois withdrew and the Anishinaabe moved in from the north to southern Ontario, they retained the Iroquois name.\nIt is believed the first European to reach the lake was \u00c9tienne Br\u00fbl\u00e9 in 1615. European colonization of Lake Ontario was slow and uneven due to the power and organization of the Haudenosaunee, Wendat, and Ojibwe nations. From 1688 to 1694 the Haudenosaunee largely excluded the French from Lake Ontario.\nAs was their practice, the French explorers introduced other names for the lake. In 1632 and 1656, the lake was referred to as Lac de St. Louis or Lake St. Louis by Samuel de Champlain and cartographer Nicolas Sanson respectively. In 1660, Jesuit historian Francis Creuxius coined the name \"Lacus Ontarius\". In a map drawn in the \"Relation des J\u00e9suites\" (1662\u20131663), the lake bears the legend \"Lac Ontario ou des Iroquois\" with the name \"Ondiara\" in smaller type. A French map produced in 1712 (currently in the Canadian Museum of History), created by military engineer Jean-Baptiste de Couagne, identified Lake Ontario as \"Lac Frontenac\" named after Louis de Buade, Comte de Frontenac et de Palluau. He was a French soldier, courtier, and Governor General of New France from 1672 to 1682 and from 1689 to his death in 1698.\nIn the 17th century, reports of an alleged creature named Gaasyendietha, similar to the so-called Loch Ness Monster, being sighted in the lake. The creature is described as large with a long neck, green in colour, and generally causes a break in the surface waves.\nA series of trading posts were established by both the British and French, such as Fort Frontenac in 1673, Fort Oswego in 1722, and Fort Rouill\u00e9 in 1750. As the easternmost and nearest lake to the Atlantic seaboard of Canada and the United States, population centres here are among the oldest in the Great Lakes basin, with Kingston, Ontario, formerly the capital of Canada, dating to the establishment of Fort Frontenac in 1673. \nAfter the French and Indian War, all forts around the lake were under British control. During the American Revolution, the British controlled Lake Ontario from their bases at Carleton Island, Navy Hall, and Oswego, allowing them to largely excluded the Americans from the lake. The United States took possession of the forts along the American side of the lake at the signing of the Jay Treaty in 1794. Permanent, non-military European settlement began during the American Revolution with the influx of Loyalist settlers.\nFollowing the American Revolution, sailing commerce slowly returned to Lake Ontario. There was one private commercial vessel, the \"Good Intent\", on the lake in 1788. Several more vessels were launched prior to 1800, primarily by Canadian merchants. Commerce continued to expand until the Embargo of 1807. There was significant smuggling across Lake Ontario during the embargo.\nDuring the War of 1812, the Royal Navy and US Navy operated substantial shipyards at Kingston, Ontario and Sackets Harbor, New York, respectively, and fought in several engagements for control of Lake Ontario. The Great Lakes, including Lake Ontario, were largely demilitarized after the Rush\u2013Bagot Treaty was ratified in 1818. As a result, most of the naval vessels were sold or abandoned.\nThe lake became a hub of commercial activity following the War of 1812 with canal building on both sides of the border and significant sailing and steamer commerce.\nSailing commerce on Lake Ontario was initially significant but declined relative to the other Great Lakes after the mid-19th century as the centers of colonialist agriculture, timbering, and mining moved farther west. After the Erie Canal opened, much of the movement of people and commodities between the East Coast and the Great Lakes circumvented Lake Ontario. Oswego remained an important port on Lake Ontario during this time because the Oswego Canal allowed shippers to connect to the Erie Canal while avoiding bottlenecks at Buffalo, New York. Kingston, Clayton, and Oswego were major 19th century wooden shipbuilding centers on Lake Ontario. Oil and coal were important commodities shipped on Lake Ontario through the early 20th century. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, a type of scow known as a \"stone hooker\" was in operation on the northwest shore, particularly around Port Credit and Bronte. Stonehooking was the practice of raking flat fragments of Dundas shale from the shallow lake floor of the area for use in construction, particularly in the growing city of Toronto.\nThe \"Frontenac\" was the first steamer on Lake Ontario and the Great Lakes. This ship was launched in September 1816 from Finkle's Point (now Bath) near Kingston, ON. \"Frontenac\" was constructed by two shipbuilders who had worked for the Americans during the War of 1812 and captained by a former Royal Navy sailing master. The Americans at Sackets Harbor launched a smaller steamship, the \"Ontario, in\" March 1817.\nAs bulk cargoes became increasingly important in Great lakes commerce and the number of improved harbors increased, so did propeller ships. The number of propeller ships exceed the number of side-wheel steamers by circa 1857. The \"Vandalia\" was the first propeller ship on the Great Lakes and the second in the United States. Launched at Oswego in 1841, \"Vandalia\"'s propeller was designed by John Ericsson. Steamer activity peaked in the mid-19th century before competition from railway lines.\nIron hull construction developed on Lake Ontario during the mid-19th century but did not become widespread until the early 20th century. The first iron-hulled ship on the Great Lakes, the British paddle-wheel gunboat HMS \"Mohawk\", was launched at Kingston in 1843. The \"Passport\" and the \"Magnet\", both built for the Royal Mail Line, were launched at Kingston in 1846 and at Niagara in 1847, respectively.\nSwims across the lake.\nAs of 2012[ [update]], nearly 50 people have successfully swum across the lake. The first person who accomplished the feat was a Canadian long distance swimmer Marilyn Bell, who did it in 1954 at age 16. Toronto's Marilyn Bell Park is named in her honour. The park opened in 1984 and is east of the spot where Bell completed her swim. In 1974, Diana Nyad became the first person who swam across the lake against the current (from north to south). On August 28, 2007, 14-year-old Natalie Lambert from Kingston, Ontario, made the swim, leaving Sackets Harbor, New York, and reaching Kingston's Confederation basin less than 24 hours after she entered the lake. On August 19, 2012, 14-year-old Annaleise Carr became the youngest person to swim across the lake. She completed the 32-mile (52-km) crossing from Niagara-on-the-Lake to Marilyn Bell Park in just under 27 hours.\nSettlements.\nA large conurbation called the Golden Horseshoe occupies the lake's westernmost shores, anchored by the cities of Toronto and Hamilton. Ports on the Canadian side include St. Catharines, Oshawa, Cobourg and Kingston, near the St. Lawrence River outlet. Close to 9 million people, or over a quarter of Canada's population, live within the watershed of Lake Ontario. The American shore is largely rural, with the exception of Rochester and the much smaller ports at Oswego and Sackets Harbor. The city of Syracuse is inland, connected to the lake by the New York State Canal System. Over 2 million people live in Lake Ontario's American watershed.\nIslands.\nSeveral islands exist in the lake, the largest of which being Wolfe Island. Nearly all of Lake Ontario's islands are on the eastern and northeastern shores, between the Prince Edward County headland and the lake's outlet at Kingston, underlain by the basement rock found throughout the region. However, there exist several islands in the northwestern portion of the lake. Notable islands include:\nNavigation.\nThe Great Lakes Waterway connects the lake sidestream to the Atlantic Ocean via the Saint Lawrence Seaway and upstream to the other rivers in the chain via the Welland Canal and to Lake Erie. The Trent-Severn Waterway for pleasure boats connects Lake Ontario at the Bay of Quinte to Georgian Bay (Lake Huron) via Lake Simcoe. The Oswego Canal connects the lake at Oswego to the New York State Canal System, with outlets to the Hudson River, Lake Erie, and Lake Champlain. The Rideau Canal, also for pleasure boats, connects Lake Ontario at Kingston to the Ottawa River in downtown Ottawa, Ontario.\nSeveral lighthouses exist throughout the lake to help with navigation. Notable historic examples include:\nA land-based trail that roughly follows the lake's shoreline also exists, the Great Lakes Circle Tour and Seaway Trail. The designated scenic road systems connects all of the Great Lakes and the St. Lawrence River. As the Seaway Trail is posted on the U.S. side only, Lake Ontario is the only of the five Great Lakes to have no posted bi-national circle tour.\nNational marine sanctuary.\nThe Lake Ontario National Marine Sanctuary covers in U.S. waters in southeastern Lake Ontario. Designated on September\u00a06, 2024, the national marine sanctuary protects historic shipwrecks and an area of great cultural, historical, and spiritual importance to the Native American peoples of the Haudenosaunee Confederacy. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Office of National Marine Sanctuaries and the Government of New York jointly administer the sanctuary.\nEconomic impact.\nLake Ontario is the site of several major commercial ports including the Port of Toronto and the Port of Hamilton. Hamilton Harbour is the location of major steel production facilities.\nThe government of Ontario, which holds the lakebed rights of the Canadian portion of the lake under the Beds of Navigable Waters Act, does not permit wind power to be generated offshore. In \"Trillium Power Wind Corporation v. Ontario (Natural Resources)\", the Superior Court of Justice held Trillium Power\u2014since 2004 an \"Applicant of Record\" who had invested $35,000 in fees and, when in 2011 the Crown made a policy decision against offshore windfarms, claimed an injury of $2.25\u00a0billion\u2014disclosed no reasonable cause of action.\nThe Great Lakes once supported an industrial-scale fishery, with record hauls in 1899; overfishing later blighted the industry. However, only recreational fishing activities exist in the 21st century."}
{"id": "17948", "revid": "12109628", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=17948", "title": "Lake Michigan", "text": "One of the Great Lakes of North America\nLake Michigan ( ) is one of the five Great Lakes of North America. It is the second-largest of the Great Lakes by volume () and depth () after Lake Superior and the third-largest by surface area (), after Lake Superior and Lake Huron. To the east, its basin is conjoined with that of Lake Huron through the wide and deep Straits of Mackinac, giving it the same surface elevation as its eastern counterpart; hydrologically, the two bodies are a single lake that is, by area, the largest freshwater lake in the world.\nLake Michigan is the only Great Lake located fully in the United States; the other four are shared between the U.S. and Canada. It is the world's largest lake, by area, located fully in one country, and is shared, from west to east, by the U.S. states of Wisconsin, Illinois, Indiana, and Michigan. Ports along its shores include Chicago, Illinois, Gary, Indiana, Milwaukee and Green Bay, Wisconsin, and Muskegon, Michigan. To the north, the lake is flanked by long bays, including Green Bay in the northwest, and Grand Traverse and Little Traverse bays in the northeast. The word \"michigan\" is believed to come from the Ojibwe (\"michi-gami\" or \"mishigami\"), meaning \"great water\".\nHistory.\nSome of the most well-studied early human inhabitants of the Lake Michigan region were the Hopewell Native Americans. Their culture declined after 800 AD, when, for the following few hundred years, the region was the home of peoples known as the Late Woodland Native Americans. In the early 17th century, when Western European explorers made their first forays into the region, they encountered descendants of the Late Woodland Native Americans, mainly the historic Ojibwe, Menominee, Noquet, Sauk, Meskwaki, Ho-Chunk, Miami, Odawa and Potawatomi peoples. The French explorer Jean Nicolet is believed to have been the first European to reach Lake Michigan, possibly in 1634 or 1638. In the earliest European maps of the region, the name of Lake Illinois has been found (named for the Illinois Confederation of tribes), in addition to that of \"Michigan\". During the 1640s and 1650s, the Beaver Wars (over the fur trade with the European colonies), initiated by the Iroquois, forced a massive demographic-shift, as their western neighbors fled the violence. The Iroquois sought refuge to the west and north of Lake Michigan.\nThe Straits of Mackinac were an important Native American travel corridor and fur-trade route. Located on the southern side of the straits sits the town of Mackinaw City, Michigan, the site of Fort Michilimackinac (a reconstructed French fort founded in 1715); on the northern side is St. Ignace, Michigan, site of a French Catholic mission to the Indians (founded in 1671). In 1673, Jacques Marquette, Louis Jolliet, and their crew of five M\u00e9tis voyageurs followed Lake Michigan to Green Bay and up the Fox River, nearly to its headwaters, in their search for the Mississippi River. By the late 18th century, the eastern portions of the straits were controlled by Fort Mackinac on Mackinac Island, a British colonial and early American military base and fur trade center, founded in 1781.\nWith the advent of European exploration into the area in the late 17th century, Lake Michigan became used as part of a line of waterways leading from the Saint Lawrence River to the Mississippi River and thence to the Gulf of Mexico. French coureurs des bois and voyageurs established small ports and trading communities, such as Green Bay, on the lake during the late 17th and early 18th centuries. In the 19th century, Lake Michigan was integral to the development of Chicago and the Midwestern United States west of the lake. For example, 90% of the grain shipped from Chicago traveled by ships east over Lake Michigan during the years. The volume rarely fell below 50% after the Civil War even with the major expansion of railroad shipping.\nThe first person to reach the deep bottom of Lake Michigan was J. Val Klump, a scientist at the University of Wisconsin\u2013Milwaukee in 1985. Klump reached the bottom via submersible as part of a research expedition. The warming of Lake Michigan was the subject of a 2018 report by Purdue University. In each decade since 1980, steady increases in obscure surface temperature have occurred. This is likely to lead to decreasing native habitat and to adversely affect native species survival, including game fish.\nHydrology.\nThe Milwaukee Reef, running under Lake Michigan from a point between Milwaukee and Racine to a point between Grand Haven and Muskegon, divides the lake into northern and southern basins. Each basin has a clockwise flow of water, deriving from rivers and winds. Prevailing westerly winds tend to move the surface water toward the east, producing a moderating effect on the climate of western Michigan. There is a mean difference in summer water temperatures of 5 to 10 degrees Fahrenheit (2 to 5 degrees Celsius) between the Wisconsin and Michigan shores.\nHydrologically Michigan and Huron are the same body of water (sometimes called Lake Michigan-Huron) but are normally considered distinct. Counted together, it is the largest body of fresh water in the world by surface area. The Mackinac Bridge is generally considered the dividing line between them. The main inflow to Lake Michigan from Lake Superior, through Lake Huron, is controlled by the locks operated by the bi-national Lake Superior Board of Control.\nStatistics.\nLake Michigan is the only Great Lake that is wholly within the borders of the United States; the others are shared with Canada. Lake Michigan has a surface area of ; ( lying in Michigan, in Wisconsin, in Indiana, &amp; in Illinois) making it the largest lake entirely within one country by surface area (Lake Baikal in Russia is larger by water volume) and the fifth-largest lake in the world.\nIt is the larger half of Lake Michigan\u2013Huron, which is the largest body of fresh water in the world by surface area. It is long by wide with a shoreline long. The lake's average depth is 46 fathoms 3 feet (279\u00a0ft; 85 m), while its greatest depth is 153 fathoms 5 feet (923\u00a0ft; 281\u00a0m). It contains a volume of 1,183 cubic miles (4,932\u00a0km3) of water. Green Bay in the northwest is its largest bay. Grand Traverse Bay in its northeast is another large bay. Lake Michigan's deepest region, which lies in its northern half, is called Chippewa Basin (named after prehistoric Lake Chippewa) and is separated from South Chippewa Basin by a relatively shallower area called the Mid Lake Plateau.\nConnection to other water bodies.\nIn the mid 20th century, construction of the Saint Lawrence Seaway and Great Lakes Waterway opened the Great Lakes to ocean-going vessels. But the wider ocean-going container ships that were developed later do not fit through the locks on these routes, which limits shipping on the lakes. Lake freighters are used on the lakes that are too large to pass the locks and enter the ocean. Despite their vast size, large sections of the Great Lakes freeze in winter, interrupting most shipping. Some icebreakers ply the lakes.\nLake Michigan is connected by the Illinois Waterway to the Gulf of Mexico via the Illinois River and the Mississippi River. Commercial tug-and-barge traffic on these waterways is heavy. Pleasure boats can enter or exit the Great Lakes by way of the Erie Canal and Hudson River in New York. The Erie Canal connects to the Great Lakes at the east end of Lake Erie (at Buffalo, New York) and at the south side of Lake Ontario (at Oswego, New York).\nWater level.\nThe lake fluctuates from month to month with the highest lake levels typically occurring in summer. The normal high-water mark is above datum (\"\"). In October 1986, Lakes Michigan and Huron reached their highest level at above datum. The monthly average high-water records were broken for several months in a row in 2020.\nLake levels tend to be the lowest in winter. The normal low-water mark is below datum (\"577.5 ft or 176.0 m\"). In the winter of 1964, Lakes Michigan and Huron reached their lowest level at below datum. As with the high-water records, monthly low-water records were set each month from February 1964 through January 1965. During this twelve-month period, water levels ranged from below Chart Datum. The all-time low-water mark was eclipsed in January 2013.\nIn January 2013, Lake Michigan's monthly mean water levels dipped to an all-time low of , reaching their lowest ebb since record keeping began in 1918. The lakes were below their long-term average and had declined 17 inches since January 2012. Keith Kompoltowicz, chief of watershed hydrology for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers' district office in Detroit, explained that biggest factors leading to the lower water levels in 2013 were a combination of the \"lack of a large snowpack\" in the winter of 2011/2012 coupled with very hot and dry conditions in the summer of 2012. Since then water levels rebounded, rising more than to historical record high levels.\nDrinking water.\nLake Michigan, like the other Great Lakes, supplies drinking water to millions of people in bordering areas.\nThe Great Lakes are collectively administered by the Conference of Great Lakes and St. Lawrence Governors and Premiers, intergovernmental organization led by the governing chief executives of the Canadian provinces of Ontario and Qu\u00e9bec, and by the governors of the U.S. states of Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Minnesota, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin. The Conference came into force, in December 2008, with the enactment of laws in all of the states and the two provinces, and the enactment of a United States federal law.\nEnvironmental problems can still plague the lake. Steel mills and refineries operate near the Indiana shoreline. The \"Chicago Tribune\" reported that BP is a major polluter, dumping thousands of pounds of raw sludge into the lake every day from its Whiting, Indiana, oil refinery. In March 2014 BP's Whiting refinery was responsible for spilling more than of oil into the lake.\nShoreline.\nBeaches.\nLake Michigan has many beaches. The region is often referred to as the \"Third Coast\" of the United States, after those of the Atlantic Ocean and the Pacific Ocean. The sand is often soft and off-white, known as \"singing sands\" because of the squeaking noise (caused by high quartz content) it emits when walked upon. Some beaches have sand dunes covered in green beach grass and sand cherries, and the water is usually clear and cool, between , even in the late summer months. However, because prevailing westerly winds tend to move the surface water toward the east, there is a flow of warmer water to the Michigan shore in the summer.\nThe sand dunes located on the east shore of Lake Michigan are the largest freshwater dune system in the world. In multiple locations along the shoreline, the dunes rise several hundred feet above the lake surface. Large dune formations can be seen in many state parks, national forests and national parks along the Indiana and Michigan shoreline. Some of the most expansive and unique dune formations can be found at Indiana Dunes National Park, Saugatuck Dunes State Park, Warren Dunes State Park, Hoffmaster State Park, Silver Lake State Park, Ludington State Park, and Sleeping Bear Dunes National Lakeshore. Small dune formations can be found on the western shore of Lake Michigan at Illinois Beach State Park, and moderate-sized dune formations can be found in Kohler-Andrae State Park and Point Beach State Forest in Wisconsin. A large dune formation can be found in Whitefish Dunes State Park in Wisconsin in the Door Peninsula. Lake Michigan beaches in Northern Michigan are the only place in the world, aside from a few inland lakes in that region, where Petoskey stones, the Michigan state stone, can be found.\nThe beaches of the western coast and the northernmost part of the east coast are often rocky, with some sandy beaches. The southern and eastern beaches are typically sandy and dune-covered. This is partly because of the prevailing winds from the west (which also cause thick layers of ice to build on the eastern shore in winter). The Chicago city waterfront has been developed for parks, beaches, harbors and marinas, and residential developments connected by the Chicago Lakefront Trail. Where there are no beaches or marinas, stone or concrete revetments protect the shoreline from erosion. The Chicago lakefront is accessible for about between the city's southern and northern limits along the lake.\nCities.\nTwelve million people live along Lake Michigan's shores, mainly in the Chicago and Milwaukee metropolitan areas. The economy of many communities in northern Michigan and Door County, Wisconsin, is supported by tourism, with large seasonal populations attracted by Lake Michigan. Many seasonal residents have summer homes along the waterfront and return to other homes for the winter. The southern tip of the lake near Gary, Indiana, is heavily industrialized.\nCities on the shores of Lake Michigan include:\nIllinois\nIndiana\nMichigan\nWisconsin\nParks.\nThe National Park Service maintains the Sleeping Bear Dunes National Lakeshore and Indiana Dunes National Park. Parts of the shoreline are within the Hiawatha National Forest and the Manistee National Forest. The Manistee National Forest section of the shoreline includes the Nordhouse Dunes Wilderness. The Lake Michigan division of the Michigan Islands National Wildlife Refuge is also within the lake, as are the Green Bay National Wildlife Refuge and the Wisconsin Shipwreck Coast National Marine Sanctuary.\nThere are numerous state and local parks located on the shores of the lake or on islands within the lake:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nHuman activities.\nFishing.\nLake Michigan is home to a small variety of fish species and other organisms. It was originally home to lake whitefish, lake trout, yellow perch, panfish, largemouth bass, smallmouth bass and bowfin, as well as some species of catfish. As a result of improvements to the Welland Canal in 1918, an invasion of sea lampreys and overharvesting, there has been a decline in native lake trout populations, ultimately causing an increase in the population of another invasive species, the alewife. As a result, salmonids, including various strains of brown trout, steelhead (rainbow trout), coho and chinook salmon, were introduced as predators in order to decrease the wildlife population. This program was so successful that the introduced population of trout and salmon exploded, resulting in the creation of a large sport fishery for these introduced species. Lake Michigan is now stocked annually with steelhead, brown trout, and coho and chinook salmon, which have also begun natural reproduction in some Lake Michigan tributaries. However, several introduced invasive species, such as lampreys, round goby, zebra mussels and quagga mussels, continue to cause major changes in water clarity and fertility, resulting in knock-on changes to Lake Michigan's ecosystem, threatening the vitality of native fish populations.\nFisheries in inland waters of the United States are small compared to marine fisheries. The largest fisheries are the landings from the Great Lakes, worth about $14\u00a0million in 2001. Michigan's commercial fishery today consists mainly of 150 tribe-licensed commercial fishing operations through the Chippewa-Ottawa Resource Authority and tribes belonging to the Great Lakes Indian Fish and Wildlife Commission, which harvest 50 percent of the Great Lakes commercial catch in Michigan waters, and 45 state-licensed commercial fishing enterprises. The prime commercial species is the lake whitefish. The annual harvest declined from an average of from 1981 through to 1999 to more recent annual harvests of . The price for lake whitefish dropped from $1.04/lb. to as low as $0.40/lb during periods of high production.\nSports fishing includes salmon, whitefish, smelt, lake trout and walleye as major catches. In the late 1960s, successful stocking programs for Pacific salmon led to the development of Lake Michigan's charter fishing industry.\nShipping.\nLike all of the Great Lakes, Lake Michigan is today used as a major mode of transport for bulk goods. In 2002, 162\u00a0million net tons of dry bulk cargo were moved via the Lakes. This was, in order of volume: iron ore, grain and potash. The iron ore and much of the stone and coal are used in the steel industry. There is also some shipping of liquid and containerized cargo, but most container vessels cannot pass the locks on the Saint Lawrence Seaway because the ships are too wide. The total amount of shipping on the lakes has been on a downward trend for several years. The Port of Chicago, operated by the Illinois International Port District, has grain (14\u00a0million bushels) and bulk liquid (800,000 barrels) storage facilities along Lake Calumet. The central element of the Port District, Calumet Harbor, is maintained by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.\nFerries.\nTwo passenger and vehicle ferries operate ferry services across Lake Michigan, both connecting Wisconsin on the western shore with Michigan on the east. From May to October, the historic steamship, , operates daily between Manitowoc, Wisconsin, and Ludington, Michigan, connecting U.S. Highway 10 between the two cities. The \"Lake Express\", established in 2004, carries passengers and vehicles across the lake between Milwaukee, Wisconsin, and Muskegon, Michigan.\nTourism and recreation.\nTourism and recreation are major industries on all of the Great Lakes. A few small cruise ships operate on Lake Michigan, including a couple of sailing ships. Many other water sports are practiced on the lakes, such as yachting, sea kayaking, diving, kitesurfing and lake surfing. Great Lakes passenger steamers have been operating since the mid-19th century. Several ferries currently operate on the Great Lakes to carry passengers to various islands, including Beaver Island and Bois Blanc Island (Michigan). Currently, two car ferry services traverse Lake Michigan from around April to November: the SS Badger, a steamer from Ludington, Michigan, to Manitowoc, Wisconsin, and the Lake Express, a high speed catamaran from Milwaukee to Muskegon, Michigan.\nThe Great Lakes Circle Tour, a designated scenic road system, connects all of the Great Lakes and the St. Lawrence River. The lake is a great place to view ice volcanoes, which typically occur at the start of the winter season.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

However, even as early as 1506, Perizolo, a notary of the Holy Roman Empire, mentions him as \"Lionardo Fibonacci\".\nFibonacci popularized the Indo\u2013Arabic numeral system in the Western world primarily through his composition in 1202 of (\"Book of Calculation\") and also introduced Europe to the sequence of Fibonacci numbers, which he used as an example in .\nBiography.\nFibonacci was born around 1170 to Guglielmo, an Italian merchant and customs official who directed a trading post in Bugia, modern-day B\u00e9ja\u00efa, Algeria. Fibonacci travelled with him as a young boy. He was educated in Bugia, where he learned about the Hindu\u2013Arabic numeral system.\nFibonacci travelled around the Mediterranean coast, meeting with many merchants and learning about their systems of doing arithmetic.\nHe soon realised the many advantages of the Hindu-Arabic system, which, unlike the Roman numerals used at the time, allowed easy calculation using a place-value system. In 1202, he completed the (\"Book of Abacus\" or \"The Book of Calculation\"), which popularized Hindu\u2013Arabic numerals in Europe.\nFibonacci was a guest of Emperor Frederick II, who enjoyed mathematics and science. A member of Frederick II's court, John of Palermo, posed several questions based on Arab mathematical works for Fibonacci to solve. In 1240, the Republic of Pisa honored Fibonacci (referred to as Leonardo Bigollo) by granting him a salary in a decree that recognized him for the services that he had given to the city as an advisor on matters of accounting and instruction to citizens.\nFibonacci is thought to have died between 1240 and 1250, in Pisa.\n\"Liber Abaci\".\nIn the (1202), Fibonacci introduced the so-called \"modus Indorum\" (method of the Indians), today known as the Hindu\u2013Arabic numeral system, with ten digits including a zero and positional notation. The book showed the practical use and value of this by applying the numerals to commercial bookkeeping, converting weights and measures, calculation of interest, money-changing, and other applications. The book was well-received throughout educated Europe and had a profound influence on European thought. Replacing Roman numerals, its ancient Egyptian multiplication method, and using an abacus for calculations, was an advance in making business calculations easier and faster, which assisted the growth of banking and accounting in Europe.\nThe original 1202 manuscript is not known to exist. In a 1228 copy of the manuscript, the first section introduces the numeral system and compares it with others, such as Roman numerals, and methods to convert numbers to it. The second section explains uses in business, for example converting different currencies, and calculating profit and interest, which were important to the growing banking industry. The book also discusses irrational numbers and prime numbers.\nFibonacci sequence.\n posed and solved a problem involving the growth of a population of rabbits based on idealized assumptions. The solution, generation by generation, was a sequence of numbers later known as Fibonacci numbers. Although Fibonacci's contains the earliest known description of the sequence outside of India, the sequence had been described by Indian mathematicians as early as the sixth century.\nIn the Fibonacci sequence, each number is the sum of the previous two numbers. Fibonacci omitted the \"0\" and first \"1\" included today and began the sequence with 1, 2, 3, ... . He carried the calculation up to the thirteenth place, the value 233, though another manuscript carries it to the next place, the value 377. Fibonacci did not speak about the golden ratio as the limit of the ratio of consecutive numbers in this sequence.\nLegacy.\nIn the 19th century, a statue of Fibonacci was set in Pisa. Today it is located in the western gallery of the Camposanto, historical cemetery on the Piazza dei Miracoli.\nThere are many mathematical concepts named after Fibonacci because of a connection to the Fibonacci numbers. Examples include the Brahmagupta\u2013Fibonacci identity, the Fibonacci search technique, and the Pisano period. Beyond mathematics, namesakes of Fibonacci include the asteroid 6765 Fibonacci and the art rock band The Fibonaccis.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "17951", "revid": "12517593", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=17951", "title": "Lake Superior", "text": "Largest of the Great Lakes of North America\nLake Superior is a lake in central North America. The northernmost, westernmost, and highest of the Great Lakes, Lake Superior straddles the Canada\u2013United States border with the Canadian province of Ontario to the north and east and the U.S. states of Minnesota to the west and Michigan and Wisconsin to the south. It is the largest freshwater lake in the world by surface area and the third-largest freshwater lake by volume. It drains into Lake Huron via St. Marys River, then through the lower Great Lakes to the St. Lawrence River and ultimately the Atlantic Ocean.\nName.\nThe Ojibwe name for the lake is (in syllabics: , pronounced or in different dialects), meaning \"great sea\". Henry Wadsworth Longfellow wrote this name as \"Gitche Gumee\" in the poem \"The Song of Hiawatha\", as did Gordon Lightfoot in his song \"The Wreck of the \"Edmund Fitzgerald\"\".\nAccording to other sources, the full Ojibwe name is (\"Ojibwe's Great Sea\") or (\"Anishinaabe's Great Sea\"). The 1853 dictionary by Father Frederic Baraga, the first one written for the Ojibway language, gives the Ojibwe name as (a transliteration of ).\nIn the 17th century, the first French explorers approached the great inland sea by way of the Ottawa River and Lake Huron; they referred to their discovery as (the upper lake, i.e., above Lake Huron in elevation). Some 17th-century Jesuit missionaries referred to it as (for Alexandre de Prouville de Tracy). After taking control of the region from the French in the 1760s, following their defeat in the French and Indian War, the British anglicized the lake's name to \"Superior\", \"on account of its being superior in magnitude to any of the lakes on that vast continent\".\nHydrography.\nLake Superior empties into Lake Huron via the St. Marys River and the Soo Locks (Sault Ste. Marie locks). Lake Superior is the largest freshwater lake in the world by area and the third largest in volume, behind Lake Baikal in Siberia and Lake Tanganyika in East Africa. The Caspian Sea, while larger than Lake Superior in both surface area and volume, is brackish.\nLake Superior has a surface area of , which is approximately the size of South Carolina or Austria. It has a maximum length of and maximum breadth of . Its average depth is with a maximum depth of . Lake Superior contains 2,900 cubic\u00a0miles (12,100\u00a0km3) of water. There is enough water in Lake Superior to cover the entire land mass of North and South America to a depth of . The shoreline of the lake stretches (including islands). The lake boasts a very small ratio (1.55) of catchment area to surface area, which indicates minimal terrestrial influence.\nAmerican limnologist J. Val Klump was the first person to reach the lowest depth of Lake Superior on July 30, 1985, as part of a scientific expedition, which at 122 fathoms 1-foot () below sea level is the second-lowest spot in the continental interior of the United States and the third-lowest spot in the interior of the North American continent after Great Slave Lake in the Northwest Territories of Canada ( below sea level) and Iliamna Lake in Alaska . (Though Crater Lake is the deepest lake in the United States and deeper than Lake Superior, Crater Lake's elevation is higher and consequently its deepest point is \"above\" sea level.)\nWhile the temperature of the surface of Lake Superior varies seasonally, the temperature below is an almost constant . This variation in temperature makes the lake seasonally stratified. Twice per year, however, the water column reaches a uniform temperature of from top to bottom, and the lake waters thoroughly mix. This feature makes the lake dimictic. Because of its volume, Lake Superior has a retention time of 191 years.\nAnnual storms on Lake Superior regularly feature wave heights of over . Waves well over have been recorded.\nTributaries.\nLake Superior is fed by more than 200 rivers, including the Nipigon River, the St. Louis River, the Pigeon River, the Pic River, the White River, the Michipicoten River, the Bois Brule River and the Kaministiquia River. The lake's outlet at St. Marys River has a relatively steep gradient with rapids. The Soo Locks enable ships to bypass the rapids and to overcome the height difference between Lakes Superior and Huron.\nWater levels.\nThe lake's average surface elevation is above sea level. Until approximately 1887, the natural hydraulic conveyance through the St. Marys River rapids determined the outflow from Lake Superior. By 1921, development in support of transportation and hydroelectric power resulted in gates, locks, power canals and other control structures completely spanning St. Marys rapids. The regulating structure is known as the Compensating Works and is operated according to a regulation plan known as Plan 1977-A. Water levels, including diversions of water from the Hudson Bay watershed, are regulated by the International Lake Superior Board of Control, which was established in 1914 by the International Joint Commission.\nLake Superior's water level was at a new record low in September 2007, slightly less than the previous record low in 1926. Water levels recovered within a few days.\nThe lake's water level fluctuates from month to month, with the highest lake levels in October and November. The normal high-water mark is above the datum (). In the summer of 1985, Lake Superior reached its highest recorded level at above the datum. 2019 and 2020 set new high-water records in nearly every month.\nThe lake's lowest levels occur in March and April. The normal low-water mark is below the datum. In the winter of 1926, Lake Superior reached its lowest recorded level at below the datum. Additionally, the entire first half of the year (January to June) included record low months. The low water was a continuation of the dropping lake levels from the previous year, 1925, which set low-water records for October through December. During the nine-month period of October 1925 to June 1926, water levels ranged from below Chart Datum. In the summer of 2007 monthly historic lows were set; August at , and September at .\nClimate change.\nAccording to a study by professors at the University of Minnesota Duluth, Lake Superior may have warmed faster than its surrounding area. Summer surface temperatures in the lake appeared to have increased by about between 1979 and 2007, compared with an approximately increase in the surrounding average air temperature. The increase in the lake's surface temperature may be related to the decreasing ice cover. Less winter ice cover allows more solar radiation to penetrate and warm the water. If trends continue, Lake Superior, which freezes over completely once every 20 years, could routinely be ice-free by 2040 although more current data through 2021 does not support this trend.\nWarmer temperatures could lead to more snow in the lake effect snow belts along the shores of the lake, especially in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. Two recent consecutive winters (2013\u20132014 and 2014\u20132015) brought high ice coverage to the Great Lakes, and on March 6, 2014, overall ice coverage peaked at 92.5%, the second-highest in recorded history. Lake Superior's ice coverage further beat 2014's record in 2019, reaching 95% coverage.\nGeography.\nThe largest island in Lake Superior is Isle Royale in Michigan. Isle Royale contains several lakes, some of which also contain islands. Other well-known islands include Madeline Island in Wisconsin, Michipicoten Island in Ontario, and Grand Island (the location of the Grand Island National Recreation Area) in Michigan.\nThe larger cities on Lake Superior include the twin ports of Duluth, Minnesota, and Superior, Wisconsin; Thunder Bay, Ontario; Marquette, Michigan; and the twin cities of Sault Ste. Marie, Michigan, and Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario. Duluth-Superior, at the western end of Lake Superior, is the most inland point on the Saint Lawrence Seaway and the most inland port in the world.\nAmong the scenic places on the lake are Apostle Islands National Lakeshore, Brockway Mountain Drive on the Keweenaw Peninsula, Isle Royale National Park, Porcupine Mountains Wilderness State Park, Pukaskwa National Park, Lake Superior Provincial Park, Grand Island National Recreation Area, Sleeping Giant (Ontario) and Pictured Rocks National Lakeshore. The Great Lakes Circle Tour is a designated scenic road system connecting all of the Great Lakes and the St. Lawrence River.\nClimate.\nLake Superior's size reduces the severity of the seasons of its humid continental climate (more typically seen in locations like Nova Scotia). The water surface's slow reaction to temperature changes, seasonally ranging between around 1970, helps to moderate surrounding air temperatures in the summer (cooler with frequent sea breeze formations) and winter, and creates lake-effect snow in colder months. The hills and mountains that border the lake hold moisture and fog, particularly in the fall.\nGeology.\nThe rocks of Lake Superior's northern shore date back to the early history of the earth. During the Precambrian (between 4.5\u00a0billion and 540\u00a0million years ago) magma forcing its way to the surface created the intrusive granites of the Canadian Shield. These ancient granites can be seen on the North Shore today. It was during the Penokean orogeny, part of the process that created the Great Lakes tectonic zone, that many valuable metals were deposited. The region surrounding the lake has proved to be rich in minerals, with copper, iron, silver, gold and nickel the most frequently mined. Notable production includes gold from the Hemlo mine near Marathon, copper from the Keweenaw Peninsula and the Mamainse Point Formation, iron from the Gogebic Range, silver at Silver Islet, and uranium at Theano Point.\nThe mountains steadily eroded, depositing layers of sediments that compacted and became limestone, dolomite, taconite and the shale at Kakabeka Falls. The continental crust was later riven, creating one of the deepest rifts in the world. The lake lies in this long-extinct Mesoproterozoic rift valley, the Midcontinent Rift. Magma was injected between layers of sedimentary rock, forming diabase sills. This hard diabase protects the layers of sedimentary rock below, forming the flat-topped mesas in the Thunder Bay area. Amethyst formed in some of the cavities created by the Midcontinent Rift, and there are several amethyst mines in the Thunder Bay area.\nLava erupted from the rift and formed the black basalt rock of Michipicoten Island, Black Bay Peninsula, and St. Ignace Island.\nIn the most recent geological history, during the Wisconsin glaciation 10,000 years ago, ice covered the region at a thickness of . The land contours familiar today were carved by the advance and retreat of the ice sheet. The retreat left gravel, sand, clay and boulder deposits. Glacial meltwaters gathered in the Superior basin creating Lake Minong, a precursor to Lake Superior. Without the immense weight of the ice, the land rebounded, and a drainage outlet formed at Sault Ste. Marie, becoming today's St. Mary's River.\nHistory.\nThe first people came to the Lake Superior region 10,000 years ago after the retreat of the glaciers in the Last Glacial Period. They are known as the Plano, and they used stone-tipped spears to hunt caribou on the northwestern side of Lake Minong. The Shield Archaic peoples arrived around 5000 BC; evidence of this culture can be found at the eastern and western ends of the Canadian shore. They used bows and arrows, paddled dugout canoes, fished, hunted, mined copper for tools and weapons, and established trading networks. They are believed to be the direct ancestors of the Ojibwe and Cree. The people of the Laurel complex (c. 500 BC to AD 500) developed seine net fishing, evidence being found at rivers around Superior such as the Pic and Michipicoten. The people of the Terminal Woodland period were evident in the area from AD 900 to 1650. They were Algonquian peoples who hunted, fished and gathered berries. They used snowshoes, birch bark canoes and conical or domed lodges. At the mouth of the Michipicoten River, nine layers of encampments have been discovered. Most of the Pukaskwa Pits were likely made during this time.\nThe Anishinaabe people (an ethnic grouping including the Ojibwe/Chippewa) have inhabited the Lake Superior region for over five hundred years and were preceded by the Dakota, Meskwaki (Fox), Menominee, Nipigon, Noquet and Gros Ventres. After the arrival of Europeans, the Anishinaabe made themselves middle-men between the French fur traders and other Native peoples. They soon became the dominant Native American nation in the region: they forced out the Sioux and Fox and won a victory against the Iroquois west of Sault Ste. Marie in 1662. By the mid-18th century, the Ojibwe occupied all of Lake Superior's shores.\nIn the 18th century, as the booming fur trade supplied Europe with beaver hats, the Hudson's Bay Company had a virtual monopoly in the region until 1783, when the rival North West Company was formed. The North West Company built forts on Lake Superior at Grand Portage, Fort William, Nipigon, the Pic River, the Michipicoten River, and Sault Ste. Marie. But by 1821, with competition harming the profits of both, the companies merged under the Hudson's Bay Company name. Many towns around the lake are current or former mining areas, or engaged in processing or shipping. Today, tourism is another significant industry: the sparsely populated Lake Superior country, with its rugged shorelines and wilderness, attracts vacationers and adventurers.\nShipping.\nLake Superior has been an important link in the Great Lakes Waterway, providing a route for the transportation of iron ore as well as grain and other mined and manufactured materials. Large cargo vessels called lake freighters, as well as smaller ocean-going freighters, transport these commodities across Lake Superior. Shipping was slow to arrive at Lake Superior in the 19th century. The first steamboat to run on the lake was the \"Independence\" in 1847, whereas the first steamers on the other Great Lakes began sailing in 1816. Ice closes the lake shipping from mid-January to late March. Exact dates for the shipping season vary each year, depending on weather conditions that form and break the ice.\nShipwrecks.\nThe southern shore of Lake Superior between Grand Marais, Michigan, and Whitefish Point is known as the \"Graveyard of the Great Lakes\"; more ships have been lost around the Whitefish Point area than any other part of Lake Superior. These shipwrecks are now protected by the Whitefish Point Underwater Preserve. Storms that claimed multiple ships include the Mataafa Storm in November 1905 and the Great Lakes Storm of 1913.\nWreckage of \u2014a ore carrier that sank on October 11, 1907, during a Lake Superior storm in 77 fathoms () of water\u2014was located in August 2007. Built in Lorain, Ohio, \"Cyprus\" was launched August 17, 1907, and was lost on her second voyage hauling iron ore from Superior, Wisconsin, to Buffalo, New York, with the sole survivor among her 23 crew being Charles G. Pitz. In 1918 the last warships to sink in the Great Lakes, French minesweepers \"Inkerman\" and \"Cerisoles\", vanished in a Lake Superior storm, perhaps upon striking the uncharted danger of the Superior Shoal in an otherwise deep part of the lake. With 78 crewmembers dead, their sinking marked the largest loss of life on Lake Superior to date.\n is the last ship that sank in Lake Superior, from Whitefish Point in a storm on November 10, 1975. The wreck was immortalized by Gordon Lightfoot in his ballad \"The Wreck of the \"Edmund Fitzgerald\"\". All 29 crew members died, and no bodies were recovered. \"Edmund Fitzgerald\" was battered so intensely by Lake Superior that the ship split in half; her two pieces lie approximately apart at a depth of 88 fathoms ().\nLightfoot sings that \"Superior, they said, never gives up her dead\". This is because of the unusually cold water, under on average around 1970. Normally, bacteria decaying a sunken body will bloat it with gas, causing it to float to the surface after a few days. But Lake Superior's water is cold enough year-round to inhibit bacterial growth, and bodies tend to sink and never resurface. Joe MacInnis reported that in July 1994, explorer Frederick Shannon's Expedition 94 to the wreck of \"Edmund Fitzgerald\" discovered a man's body near the port side of her pilothouse, not far from the open door, \"fully clothed, wearing an orange life jacket, and lying face down in the sediment\".\nIn February 2024, it was announced that wreckage from the SS \"Arlington\", which sank in 1940, was discovered.\nEcology.\nMore than 80 species of fish have been found in Lake Superior. Species native to the lake include banded killifish, bloater, brook trout, burbot, cisco, lake sturgeon, lake trout, lake whitefish, longnose sucker, muskellunge, northern pike, pumpkinseed, rock bass, round whitefish, smallmouth bass, walleye, white sucker and yellow perch. In addition, many fish species have been either intentionally or accidentally introduced to Lake Superior: Atlantic salmon, brown trout, carp, chinook salmon, coho salmon, freshwater drum, pink salmon, rainbow smelt, rainbow trout, round goby, ruffe, sea lamprey and white perch.\nLake Superior has fewer dissolved nutrients relative to its water volume than the other Great Lakes and so is less productive in terms of fish populations and is an oligotrophic lake. This is a result of the underdeveloped soils found in its relatively small watershed. It is also a reflection of relatively small human population and small amount of agriculture in its watershed. However, nitrate concentrations in the lake have been continuously rising for more than a century. They are still much lower than levels considered dangerous to human health; but this steady, long-term rise is an unusual record of environmental nitrogen buildup. It may relate to anthropogenic alternations to the regional nitrogen cycle, but researchers are still unsure of the causes of this change to the lake's ecology.\nAs for other Great Lakes fish, populations have also been affected by the accidental or intentional introduction of foreign species such as the sea lamprey and Eurasian ruffe. Accidental introductions have occurred in part by the removal of natural barriers to navigation between the Great Lakes. Overfishing has also been a factor in the decline of fish populations.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "17955", "revid": "28979433", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=17955", "title": "Leipzig", "text": "Leipzig is the most populous city in the German state of Saxony. The city has a population of 628,718 inhabitants as of 2023. It is the eighth-largest city in Germany and is part of the Central German Metropolitan Region. Leipzig is located about southwest of Berlin, in the southernmost part of the North German Plain (the Leipzig Bay), at the confluence of the White Elster and its tributaries Plei\u00dfe and Parthe.\nLeipzig has been a trade city since at least the time of the Holy Roman Empire. Via Regia and the Via Imperii, two important medieval trade routes, intersected here, marking the city's economic importance. The Leipzig Trade Fair dates back to 1190. Between 1764 and 1945, the city was a centre of publishing. After the Second World War, Leipzig remained a major urban centre in East Germany. But overall, because of isolation behind the Iron Curtain, its cultural and economic importance declined. Events in Leipzig in 1989 played a significant role in precipitating the fall of communism in Central and Eastern Europe, mainly through demonstrations starting from St. Nicholas Church. Since the early 2000s, Leipzig has experienced substantial transformation, marked by urban and economic revitalisation as well as the modernisation of its transport infrastructure.\nLeipzig is home to one of the oldest universities in Europe (Leipzig University). It is the main seat of the German National Library, the seat of the German Music Archive, as well as of the German Federal Administrative Court. Leipzig Zoo is one of the most modern zoos in Europe and as of 2018 ranks first in Germany and second in Europe. Leipzig's late-19th-century Gr\u00fcnderzeit architecture consists of around 12,500 buildings. The city's central railway terminus Leipzig Hauptbahnhof is Europe's largest railway station measured by floor area. Since Leipzig City Tunnel came into operation in 2013, it has formed the centrepiece of the S-Bahn Mitteldeutschland (\"S-Bahn Central Germany\") public transit system, Germany's largest S-Bahn network.\nLeipzig has long been a major centre for music, including classical and modern dark wave. The Thomanerchor (English: St. Thomas Choir of Leipzig), a boys' choir, was founded in 1212. The Leipzig Gewandhaus Orchestra, established in 1743, is one of the oldest symphony orchestras in the world. Several well-known composers lived and worked in Leipzig, including Johann Sebastian Bach (1723 to 1750), Felix Mendelssohn (1835 to 1847), and Richard Wagner, born in 1813. The University of Music and Theatre \"Felix Mendelssohn Bartholdy\" was founded in 1843. The Oper Leipzig, one of the most prominent opera houses in Germany, was founded in 1693. During a stay in Gohlis, which is now part of the city, Friedrich Schiller wrote his poem \"Ode to Joy\".\nNames.\nA once common English spelling of the city's name was ', among many variants. The Latin name ' was also used in many languages and in the academic publications of the city's university.\nEtymology.\nThe name \"Leipzig\" is commonly held to derive from \"lipa\", the common Slavic designation for linden trees, making the city's name etymologically related to Lipetsk, Russia. Based on medieval attestations like \"Lipzk\" (c. 1190), the original Slavic name of the city has been reconstructed as \"*Lip\u044csko\", which is also reflected in similar forms in neighbouring modern Slavic languages (Sorbian/Polish \"Lipsk\", Czech \"Lipsko\"). This has, however, been questioned by more recent onomastic research based on the very oldest forms like \"Libzi\" (c. 1015).\nThe archaic Romanian name of Leipzig, , is also derived from a Slavic form. Lipscani, a historical district in the center of Bucharest, is named after it.\nEpithets.\nDue to the etymology mentioned above, \"Lindenstadt\" or \"Stadt der Linden\" (City of Linden Trees) are common poetic epithets for the city.\nAnother, somewhat old-fashioned epithet is \"Plei\u00df-Athen\" (Athens on the Plei\u00dfe River), hinting at Leipzig's long academic and literary tradition, as the seat of one of the oldest German universities and a centre of the book trade.\nIt is also referred to as \"Little Paris\" (\"Klein-Paris\") after a line from Goethe's \"Faust I\", which is partly set in the famous Leipzig restaurant \"Auerbachs Keller\".\nIn 1937 the Nazi government awarded the city the epithet \"\" (Reich Trade Fair City Leipzig).\nIn 1989 Leipzig was dubbed a Hero City (\"Heldenstadt\"), a title that the Soviet Union awarded to some of its cities for their key role in World War II. In Leipzig's case, though, this was an informal allusion to its role in the fall of the East German regime (through the Monday demonstrations).\nMore recently, the city has sometimes been nicknamed \"Hypezig\", the \"Boomtown of eastern Germany\", or \"The better Berlin\" (\"Das bessere Berlin\") and is celebrated by the media as a hip urban centre for its vibrant lifestyle and creative scene with many startups.\nGeography.\nLocation.\nLeipzig is located in the Leipzig Bay, the southernmost part of the North German Plain, which is the part of the North European Plain in Germany. The city sits on the White Elster, a river that rises in the Czech Republic and flows into the Saale south of Halle. The Plei\u00dfe and the Parthe join the White Elster in Leipzig, and the large inland delta-like landscape the three rivers form is called \"Leipziger Gew\u00e4sserknoten\". The site is characterized by swampy areas such as the Leipzig Riparian Forest (\"Leipziger Auenwald\"), though there are also some limestone areas to the north of the city. The landscape is mostly flat, though there is also some evidence of moraine and drumlins.\nAlthough there are some forest parks within the city limits, the area surrounding Leipzig is relatively unforested. During the 20th century, there were several open-pit mines in the region, many of which have been converted to lakes.\nLeipzig is also situated at the intersection of the ancient roads known as the Via Regia (King's highway), which traversed Germany in an east\u2013west direction, and the Via Imperii (Imperial highway), a north\u2013south road.\nLeipzig was a walled city in the Middle Ages and the current \"ring\" road around the historic centre of the city follows the line of the old city walls.\nSubdivision.\nSince 1992 Leipzig has been divided administratively into ten \"Stadtbezirke\" (boroughs), which in turn contain a total of 63 \"Ortsteile\" (localities). Some of these correspond to outlying villages which have been annexed by Leipzig.\nClimate.\nLike many cities in Eastern Germany, Leipzig has an oceanic climate (K\u00f6ppen: \"Cfb\"), with significant continental influences due to its inland location. Winters are cold, with an average temperature of around . Summers are generally warm, averaging at with daytime temperatures of . Precipitation in winter is about half that of the summer. The amount of sunshine differs significantly between winter and summer, with an average of around 51 hours of sunshine in December (1.7 hours per day) compared with 229 hours of sunshine in July (7.4 hours per day).\nHistory.\nOrigins.\nLeipzig was first documented in 1015 in the chronicles of Bishop Thietmar of Merseburg as \" (, VII, 25) and endowed with city and market privileges in 1165 by Otto the Rich. Leipzig Trade Fair, started in the Middle Ages, has become an event of international importance and is the oldest surviving trade fair in the world. This encouraged the growth of the Leipzig merchant bourgeoisie.\nThere are records of commercial fishing operations on the river Plei\u00dfe that, most likely, refer to Leipzig dating back to 1305, when the Margrave Dietrich the Younger granted the fishing rights to the church and convent of St Thomas.\nThere were a number of monasteries in and around the city, including a Franciscan monastery after which the Barfu\u00dfg\u00e4\u00dfchen (Barefoot Alley) is named and a monastery of Irish monks (, destroyed in 1544) near the present day (the old \").\nThe University of Leipzig was founded in 1409 and Leipzig developed into an important centre of German law and of the publishing industry in Germany, resulting, in the 19th and 20th centuries, with the Reichsgericht (Imperial Court of Justice) and the German National Library being located here.\nDuring the Thirty Years' War, two battles took place in , about outside Leipzig city walls. The first Battle of Breitenfeld took place in 1631 and the second in 1642. Both battles resulted in victories for the Swedish-led side.\nOn 24 December 1701, when Franz Conrad Romanus was mayor, an oil-fueled street lighting system was introduced. The city employed light guards who had to follow a specific schedule to ensure the punctual lighting of the 700 lanterns.\n19th century.\nThe Leipzig region was the arena of the 1813 Battle of Leipzig between Napoleonic France and an allied coalition of Prussia, Russia, Austria and Sweden. It was the largest battle in Europe before the First World War and the coalition victory ended Napoleon's presence in Germany and would ultimately lead to his first exile on Elba. The Monument to the Battle of the Nations celebrating the centenary of this event was completed in 1913. In addition to stimulating German nationalism, the war had a major impact in mobilizing a civic spirit in numerous volunteer activities. Many volunteer militias and civic associations were formed, and collaborated with churches and the press to support local and state militias, patriotic wartime mobilization, humanitarian relief and postwar commemorative practices and rituals. While over half of the Kingdom of Saxony was formally ceded to Prussia, Leipzig remained part of King Frederick Augustus I.\nWhen it was made a terminus of the first German long-distance railway to Dresden (the capital of Saxony) in 1839, Leipzig became a hub of Central European railway traffic, with Leipzig Hauptbahnhof the largest terminal station by area in Europe. The railway station has two grand entrance halls, the eastern one for the Royal Saxon State Railways and the western one for the Prussian state railways.\nIn the 19th century, Leipzig was a centre of the German and Saxon liberal movements. The first German labor party, the General German Workers' Association (\"Allgemeiner Deutscher Arbeiterverein\", ADAV) was founded in Leipzig on 23 May 1863 by Ferdinand Lassalle; about 600 workers from across Germany travelled to the foundation on the new railway. Leipzig expanded rapidly to more than 700,000 inhabitants. Huge areas were built, which mostly survived both war and post-war demolition.\n20th century.\nWith the opening of a fifth production hall in 1907, the Leipziger Baumwollspinnerei became the largest cotton mill company on the continent, housing over 240,000 spindles. Yearly production surpassed 5\u00a0million kilograms of yarn.\nDuring World War I, in 1917, the American Consulate was closed, and its building became a temporary place of stay for Americans and Allied refugees from Serbia, Romania and Japan.\nDuring the 1930s and 1940s, music was prominent throughout Leipzig. Many students attended Felix Mendelssohn Bartholdy College of Music and Theatre (then named Landeskonservatorium.) However, in 1944, it was closed due to World War II. It re-opened soon after the war ended in 1945.\nOn 22 May 1930, Carl Friedrich Goerdeler was elected mayor of Leipzig. He later became an opponent of the Nazi regime. He resigned in 1937 when, in his absence, his Nazi deputy ordered the destruction of the city's statue of Felix Mendelssohn. On Kristallnacht in 1938, the 1855 Moorish Revival Leipzig synagogue, one of the city's most architecturally significant buildings, was deliberately destroyed. Goerdeler was later executed by the Nazis on 2 February 1945.\nSeveral thousand forced labourers were stationed in Leipzig during the Second World War.\nBeginning in 1933, many Jewish citizens of Leipzig were members of the Gemeinde, a large Jewish religious community spread throughout Germany, Austria and Switzerland. In October 1935, the Gemeinde helped found the Lehrhaus (English: a house of study) in Leipzig to provide different forms of studies to Jewish students who were prohibited from attending any institutions in Germany. Jewish studies were emphasized and much of the Jewish community of Leipzig became involved.\nLike all other cities claimed by the Nazis, Leipzig was subject to aryanisation. Beginning in 1933 and increasing in 1939, Jewish business owners were forced to give up their possessions and stores. This eventually intensified to the point where Nazi officials were strong enough to evict the Jews from their own homes. They also had the power to force many of the Jews living in the city to sell their houses. Many people who sold their homes emigrated elsewhere, outside of Leipzig. Others moved to Judenh\u00e4user, which were smaller houses that acted as ghettos, housing large groups of people.\nThe Jews of Leipzig were greatly affected by the Nuremberg Laws. However, due to the Leipzig Trade Fair and the international attention it garnered, Leipzig was especially cautious about its public image. Despite this, the Leipzig authorities were not afraid to strictly apply and enforce anti-semitic measures.\nOn 20 December 1937, after the Nazis took control of the city, they renamed it Reichsmessestadt Leipzig, meaning the \"Imperial Trade Fair City Leipzig\". In early 1938, Leipzig saw an increase in Zionism through Jewish citizens. Many of these Zionists attempted to flee before deportations began. On 28 October 1938, Heinrich Himmler ordered the deportation of Polish Jews from Leipzig to Poland. The Polish Consulate sheltered 1,300 Polish Jews, preventing their deportation.\nOn 9 November 1938, as part of Kristallnacht, in Gottschedstrasse, synagogues and businesses were set on fire. Only a couple of days later, on 11 November 1938, many Jews in the Leipzig area were deported to the Buchenwald Concentration Camp. As World War II came to an end, much of Leipzig was destroyed. Following the war, the Communist Party of Germany provided aid for the reconstruction of the city.\nIn 1933, a census recorded that over 11,000 Jews were living in Leipzig. In the 1939 census, the number had fallen to roughly 4,500, and by January 1942 only 2,000 remained. In that month, these 2,000 Jews began to be deported. On 13 July 1942, 170 Jews were deported from Leipzig to Auschwitz concentration camp. On 19 September 1942, 440 Jews were deported from Leipzig to Theresienstadt concentration camp. On 18 June 1943, the remaining 18 Jews still in Leipzig were deported from Leipzig to Auschwitz. According to records of the two waves of deportations to Auschwitz there were no survivors. According to records of the Theresienstadt deportation, only 53 Jews survived.\nDuring the German invasion of Poland at the start of World War II, in September 1939, the Gestapo carried out arrests of prominent local Poles, and seized the Polish Consulate and its library. In 1941, the American Consulate was also closed by order of the German authorities. During the war, Leipzig was the location of five subcamps of the Buchenwald concentration camp, in which over 8,000 men, women and children were imprisoned, mostly Polish, Jewish, Soviet and French, but also Italian, Czech and Belgian. In April 1945, most surviving prisoners were sent on death marches to various destinations in Saxony and German-occupied Czechoslovakia, whereas prisoners of the Leipzig-Thekla subcamp who were unable to march were either burned alive, shot or beaten to death by the Gestapo, SS, \"Volkssturm\" and German civilians in the Abtnaundorf massacre. Some were rescued by Polish forced laborers of another camp; at least 67 people survived. 84 victims were buried on 27 April 1945, however, the total number of victims remains unknown.\nDuring World War II, Leipzig was repeatedly struck by Allied bombing raids, beginning in 1943 and lasting until 1945. The first raid occurred on the morning of 4 December 1943, when 442 bombers of the Royal Air Force (RAF) dropped a total amount of almost 1,400 tons of explosives and incendiaries on the city, destroying large parts of the city centre. This bombing was the largest up to that time. Due to the close proximity of many of the buildings hit, a firestorm occurred. This prompted firefighters to rush to the city; however, they were unable to control the fires. Unlike the firebombing of the neighbouring city of Dresden, this was a largely conventional bombing with high explosives rather than incendiaries. The resultant pattern of loss was a patchwork, rather than wholesale loss of its centre, but was nevertheless extensive.\nThe Allied ground advance into Germany reached Leipzig in late April 1945. The U.S. 2nd Infantry Division and U.S. 69th Infantry Division fought their way into the city on 18 April and completed its capture after fierce urban action, in which fighting was often house-to-house and block-to-block, on 19 April 1945. In April 1945, the Mayor of Leipzig, SS-\"Gruppenf\u00fchrer\" Alfred Freyberg, his wife and daughter, together with Deputy Mayor and City Treasurer Ernest Kurt Lisso, his wife, daughter and \"Volkssturm\" Major and former Mayor Walter D\u00f6nicke, all committed suicide in Leipzig City Hall.\nThe United States turned the city over to the Red Army as it pulled back from the line of contact with Soviet forces in July 1945 to the designated occupation zone boundaries. Leipzig became one of the major cities of the German Democratic Republic (East Germany).\nFollowing the end of World War II in 1945, Leipzig saw a slow return of Jews to the city. They were joined by large numbers of German refugees who had been expelled from Central and Eastern Europe in accordance with the Potsdam Agreement.\nIn the mid-20th century, the city's trade fair assumed renewed importance as a point of contact with the Comecon Eastern Europe economic bloc, of which East Germany was a member. At this time, trade fairs were held at a site in the south of the city, near the Monument to the Battle of the Nations.\nThe planned economy of the German Democratic Republic, however, was not kind to Leipzig. Before the Second World War, Leipzig had developed a mixture of industry, creative business (notably publishing), and services (including legal services). During the period of the German Democratic Republic, services became the concern of the state, concentrated in East Berlin; creative business moved to West Germany; and Leipzig was left only with heavy industry. To make matters worse, this industry was extremely polluting, making Leipzig an even less attractive city to live in. Between 1950 and the end of the German Democratic Republic, the population of Leipzig fell from 600,000 to 500,000.\nIn October 1989, after prayers for peace at St.\u00a0Nicholas Church, established in 1983 as part of the peace movement, the Monday demonstrations started as the most prominent mass protest against the East German government. The reunification of Germany, however, was at first not good for Leipzig. The centrally planned heavy industry that had become the city's specialty was, in terms of the advanced economy of reunited Germany, almost completely unviable, and closed. Within only six years, 90% of jobs in industry had vanished. As unemployment rocketed, the population fell dramatically; some 100,000 people left Leipzig in the ten years after reunification, and vacant and derelict housing became an urgent problem.\nStarting in 2000, an ambitious urban-renewal plan first stopped Leipzig's population decline and then reversed it. The plan focused on saving and improving the city's attractive historic downtown area and particularly its early 20th century building stock, and attracting new industries, partly through infrastructure improvement. However, the renewal has led to gentrification of parts of the city and has not arrested the decline of Leipzig-East.\n21st century.\nLeipzig is an important economic centre in Germany. Since the 2010s, the city has been celebrated by the media as a hip urban centre with a very high quality of living. It is often called \"The new Berlin\". Leipzig is also Germany's fastest growing city. Leipzig was the German candidate for the 2012 Summer Olympics, but was unsuccessful. After ten years of construction, the Leipzig City Tunnel opened on 14 December 2013. Leipzig forms the centrepiece of the S-Bahn Mitteldeutschland public transit system, which operates in the four German states of Saxony, Saxony-Anhalt, Thuringia and Brandenburg.\nPolitics.\nMayor.\nThe first freely elected mayor after German reunification was Hinrich Lehmann-Grube of the Social Democratic Party (SPD), who served from 1990 to 1998. The mayor was originally chosen by the city council, but since 1994 has been directly elected. Wolfgang Tiefensee, also of the SDP, served from 1998 until his resignation in 2005 to become federal Minister of Transport. He was succeeded by fellow SPD politician Burkhard Jung, who was elected in January 2006 and re-elected in 2013 and 2020. The most recent mayoral election was held on 2 February 2020, with a runoff held on 1 March, and the results were as follows:\nCity council.\nThe most recent city council election was held on 9 June 2024, and the results were as follows:\nState Landtag.\nIn the Landtag of Saxony, Leipzig is divided among eight constituencies. After the 2024 Saxony state election, the composition and representation of each was as follows:\nBundestag.\nIn the Bundestag, Leipzig constitutes two constituencies. In the 20th Bundestag, the composition and representation of each was as follows:\nDemographics.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Module:Historical populations/styles.css\"/&gt;\nLeipzig has a population of about 620,000. In 1930, the population reached its historical peak of over 700,000. It decreased steadily from 1950 to about 530,000 in 1989. In the 1990s, the population decreased rather rapidly to 437,000 in 1998. This reduction was mostly due to outward migration and suburbanisation. After almost doubling the city area by incorporation of surrounding towns in 1999, the number stabilised and started to rise again, with an increase of 1,000 in 2000. As of 2015[ [update]], Leipzig is the fastest-growing city in Germany with over 500,000 inhabitants.\nThe growth of the past 10\u201315 years has mostly been due to inward migration. In recent years, inward migration accelerated, reaching an increase of 12,917 in 2014.\nIn the years following German reunification, many people of working age took the opportunity to move to the states of the former West Germany to seek employment opportunities. This was a contributory factor to falling birth rates. Births dropped from 7,000 in 1988 to less than 3,000 in 1994. However, the number of children born in Leipzig has risen since the late 1990s. In 2011, it reached 5,490 births resulting in a RNI of \u221217.7 (\u2212393.7 in 1995).\nThe unemployment rate decreased from 18.2% in 2003 to 9.8% in 2014 and 7.6% in June 2017.\nThe percentage of the population from an immigrant background is low compared with other German cities. As of 2012[ [update]], only 5.6% of the population were foreigners, compared to the German national average of 7.7%.\nThe number of people with an immigrant background (immigrants and their children) grew from 49,323 in 2012 to 77,559 in 2016, making them 13.3% of the city's population (Leipzig's population 579,530 in 2016).\nThe largest minorities (first and second generation) in Leipzig by country of origin as of 31 December 2021 are:\nCulture, sights and cityscape.\nIn the 2010s, Leipzig was often referred to as \"Hypezig\", as overblown comparisons were made to 1990s and early 2000s Berlin. The affordability, diversity and openness of the city have attracted many young people from across Europe, leading to a trendsetting alternative atmosphere, resulting in an innovative music, dance and art scene.\nArchitecture.\nThe historic central area of Leipzig features a Renaissance-style ensemble of buildings from the sixteenth century, including the old city hall in the marketplace. There are also several baroque period trading houses and former residences of rich merchants. As Leipzig grew considerably during the economic boom of the late-nineteenth century, the town has many buildings in the historicist style representative of the era. Approximately 35% of Leipzig's flats are in buildings of this type. The new city hall, completed in 1905, is built in the same style.\nSome 90,000 apartments in Leipzig were built in buildings during Communist rule in East Germany. Although some of these have been demolished and fewer people live in this type of accommodation in recent years, a significant number still live in Plattenbau apartments. Gr\u00fcnau, for example, had about 43,600 people living in this sort of accommodation in 2016.\nThe St. Paul's Church was destroyed by the Communist government in 1968 to make room for a new main building for the university. After some debate, the city decided to establish a new, mainly secular building at the same location, called Paulinum, which was completed in 2012. Its architecture alludes to the look of the former church and it includes space for religious use by the faculty of theology, including the original altar from the old church and two newly built organs.\nMany commercial buildings were built in the 1990s as a result of tax breaks after German reunification.\nTallest buildings and structures.\nThe tallest structure in Leipzig is the chimney of the Stahl- und Hartgusswerk B\u00f6sdorf GmbH with a height of . With , the tallest building in Leipzig is the City-Hochhaus Leipzig. From 1972 to 1973 it was Germany's tallest building.\nMuseums and the arts.\nOne of the highlights of the city's contemporary arts was the Neo Rauch retrospective opening in April 2010 at the Leipzig Museum of Fine Arts. This is a show devoted to the father of the New Leipzig School of artists. According to \"The New York Times\", this scene \"has been the toast of the contemporary art world\" for the past decade. In addition, there are eleven galleries in the so-called Spinnerei.\nThe Grassi Museum complex contains three more of Leipzig's major collections: the Ethnography Museum, Applied Arts Museum and Musical Instrument Museum (the last of which is run by the University of Leipzig). The university also runs the Museum of Antiquities.\nFounded in March 2015, the G2 Kunsthalle houses the Hildebrand Collection. This private collection focuses on the so-called New Leipzig School. Leipzig's first private museum dedicated to contemporary art in Leipzig after the turn of the millennium is located in the city centre close to the famous St. Thomas Church on the third floor of the former GDR processing centre. Also dedicated to the contemporary art is the Galerie f\u00fcr Zeitgen\u00f6ssische Kunst Leipzig.\nOther museums in Leipzig include the following:\nParks and lakes.\nLeipzig is well known for its large parks. The \"Leipziger Auwald\" (riparian forest) lies mostly within the city limits. Neuseenland is an area south of Leipzig where old open-cast mines are being converted into a huge lake district. It is planned to be finished in 2060.\nMusic.\nBaroque to Modern.\nJohann Sebastian Bach spent the longest phase of his career in Leipzig, from 1723 until his death in 1750, conducting the Thomanerchor (St. Thomas Church Choir), at the St. Thomas Church, the St. Nicholas Church and the Paulinerkirche, the university church of Leipzig (destroyed in 1968). The composer Richard Wagner was born in Leipzig in 1813, in the Br\u00fchl. Robert Schumann was also active in Leipzig music, having been invited by Felix Mendelssohn when the latter established Germany's first musical conservatoire in the city in 1843. Gustav Mahler was second conductor (working under Artur Nikisch) at the Leipzig Opera from June 1886 until May 1888, and achieved his first significant recognition while there by completing and publishing Carl Maria von Weber's opera Die Drei Pintos. Mahler also completed his own 1st Symphony while living in Leipzig.\nToday the conservatory is the University of Music and Theatre Leipzig. A broad range of subjects are taught, including artistic and teacher training in all orchestral instruments, voice, interpretation, coaching, piano chamber music, orchestral conducting, choir conducting and musical composition in various musical styles. The drama departments teach acting and scriptwriting.\nThe Bach-Archiv Leipzig, an institution for the documentation and research of the life and work of Bach (and also of the Bach family), was founded in Leipzig in 1950 by Werner Neumann. The Bach-Archiv organizes the prestigious International Johann Sebastian Bach Competition, initiated in 1950 as part of a music festival marking the bicentennial of Bach's death. The competition is now held every two years in three changing categories. The Bach-Archiv also organizes performances, especially the international festival Bachfest Leipzig and runs the Bach-Museum.\nThe city's musical tradition is also reflected in the worldwide fame of the Leipzig Gewandhaus Orchestra, under its chief conductor Andris Nelsons, and the Thomanerchor.\nThe MDR Leipzig Radio Symphony Orchestra is Leipzig's second largest symphony orchestra. Its current chief conductor is Kristjan J\u00e4rvi. Both the Gewandhausorchester and the MDR Leipzig Radio Symphony Orchestra make use of in the Gewandhaus concert hall.\nFor over sixty years Leipzig has been offering a \"school concert\" programme for children in Germany, with over 140 concerts every year in venues such as the Gewandhaus and over 40,000 children attending.\nContemporary.\nLeipzig is known for its independent music scene and subcultural events. Leipzig has for thirty years been home to the (WGT), which is currently the world's largest Gothic festival, where thousands of fans of goth music gather in the early summer. The first Wave Gotik Treffen was held at the Eiskeller club, today known as Conne Island, in the Connewitz district. Mayhem's notorious album Live in Leipzig was also recorded at the Eiskeller club. \nLeipzig Pop Up was an annual music trade fair for the independent music scene as well as a music festival taking place on Pentecost weekend. Its most famous indie-labels are Moon Harbour Recordings (House) and Kann Records (House/Techno/Psychedelic). Several venues offer live music frequently, including the Moritzbastei, Tonelli's, and Noch Besser Leben.\n\"Die Prinzen\" (\"The Princes\") is a German band founded in Leipzig. With almost six million records sold, they are one of the most successful German bands. \nThe cover photo for the Beirut band's 2005 album \"Gulag Orkestar\", according to the sleeve notes, was stolen from a Leipzig library by Zach Condon.\nThe city of Leipzig is also the birthplace of Till Lindemann, best known as the lead vocalist of Rammstein, a band formed in 1994.\nSports.\nThere are more than 300 sport clubs in the city, representing 78 different disciplines. Over 400 athletic facilities are available to citizens and club members.\nFootball.\nThe German Football Association (DFB) was founded in Leipzig in 1900.

The Chemie Leipzig founded in 1950 dates back to the prewar identity rooted in the establishment of Britannia Leipzig in 1899 and its successor TuRa Leipzig. During the socialist era, the traditions of the club were continued in the East German teams through a complicated history of mergers and name changes before the emergence of FC Sachsen Leipzig in 1990, following German reunification, which continued the clubs traditions.\nRed Bull took over a local 5th division football club SSV Markranst\u00e4dt in May 2009, having previously been denied the right to buy into FC Sachsen Leipzig in 2006. The club was renamed RB Leipzig and came up through the ranks of German football, winning promotion to the Bundesliga, the highest division of German football in 2016. The club finished runners-up in its first-ever Bundesliga season and made its debut in the UEFA Champions League in 2017 and the Semi-Final in 2020.\nRB Leipzig won the DFB-Pokal football cup twice, in 2022 and 2023. \nList of Leipzig men and women's football clubs playing at state level and above:\nNote 1: The RB Leipzig women's football team was formed in 2016 and began play in the 2016\u201317 season.\nNote 2: The club began play in the 2008\u201309 season.\nIce hockey.\nSince the beginning of the 20th century, ice hockey has gained popularity, and several local clubs established departments dedicated to that sport.\nHandball.\nSC DHfK Leipzig is the men's handball club in Leipzig and were six times (1959, 1960, 1961, 1962, 1965 and 1966) the champion of East Germany handball league and was winner of EHF Champions League in 1966.

A former open-pit coal mine, it was flooded in 1999 with groundwater and developed in 2006 as a tourist area. On its southeastern shore is Germany's only pump-powered artificial whitewater slalom course, Markkleeberg Canoe Park (Kanupark Markkleeberg), a venue which rivals the Eiskanal in Augsburg for training and international canoe/kayak competition.\nLeipzig Rugby Club competes in the German Rugby Bundesliga but finished at the bottom of their group in 2013.\nLeipzig hosted the Indoor Hockey World Cup in 2015. All matches were played in Leipzig Arena, with the Netherlands coming out victorious in both the men's and women's tournaments.\nOn 1 May every year, the opening of the horse racing season is celebrated in Leipzig's Racecourse Scheibenholz.\nEducation.\nUniversity.\nLeipzig University, founded 1409, is one of Europe's oldest universities. Karl B\u00fccher, a German economist, founded the \"Institut f\u00fcr Zeitungswissenschaften\" (Institute for Newspaper Science) at the University of Leipzig in 1916. It was the first institute of its kind to be established in Europe, and it marks the commencement of academic study of media communication in Germany. \nGottfried Wilhelm Leibniz, a philosopher and mathematician, was born in Leipzig in 1646, and attended the university from 1661 to 1666. Nobel Prize laureate Werner Heisenberg worked at the university as a physics professor (from 1927 to 1942), as did Nobel Prize laureates Gustav Ludwig Hertz (physics), Wilhelm Ostwald (chemistry) and Theodor Mommsen (Nobel Prize in Literature). The 2022 Nobel Prize in Physiology and Medicine went to Svante P\u00e4\u00e4bo, an honorary professor at the university. Other former university staff include mineralogist Georg Agricola, writer Gotthold Ephraim Lessing, philosopher Ernst Bloch, founder of psychophysics Gustav Theodor Fechner, and founder of modern psychology, Wilhelm Wundt.

Its 600 students (as of 2018[ [update]]) are enrolled in courses in painting and graphics, book design/graphic design, photography and media art. The school also houses an Institute for Theory.\nThe University of Music and Theatre offers a broad range of subjects ranging from training in orchestral instruments, voice, interpretation, coaching, piano chamber music, orchestral conducting, choir conducting and musical composition to acting and scriptwriting.\nUniversity of Applied Science.\nThe Leipzig University of Applied Sciences (HTWK) has approximately 6,200 students (as of 2007[ [update]]) and is (as of 2007[ [update]]) the second biggest institution of higher education in Leipzig. It was founded in 1992, merging several older schools. As a university of applied sciences (German: ) its status is slightly below that of a university, with more emphasis on the practical parts of education. The HTWK offers many engineering courses, as well as courses in computer science, mathematics, business administration, librarianship, museum studies, and social work. It is mainly located in the south of the city.\nLeipzig Graduate School.\nThe private Leipzig Graduate School of Management, (in German \"Handelshochschule Leipzig (HHL)\"), is the oldest business school in Germany. According to The Economist, HHL is one of the best schools in the world, ranked at number six overall.\nLancaster University Leipzig.\nBranch campus of Lancaster University, it is the first public UK university with a campus in Germany. Lancaster University Leipzig was founded in 2020 and currently has a diverse international student body with more than 45 nationalities.\nResearch institutes.\nLeipzig is currently the home of twelve research institutes and the Saxon Academy of Sciences and Humanities.\nOthers.\nLeipzig is home to one of the world's oldest schools, \"Thomasschule zu Leipzig\" (St.\u00a0Thomas' School, Leipzig), which gained fame for its long association with the Bach family of musicians and composers.\nThe Lutheran Theological Seminary is a seminary of the Evangelical Lutheran Free Church in Leipzig. The seminary trains students to become pastors for the Evangelical Lutheran Free Church or for member church bodies of the Confessional Evangelical Lutheran Conference.\nEconomy.\nThe city is a location for automobile manufacturing by BMW and Porsche in large plants north of the city. In 2011 and 2012 DHL transferred the bulk of its European air operations from Brussels Airport to Leipzig/Halle Airport. Kirow Ardelt AG, the world market leader in breakdown cranes, is based in Leipzig. The city also houses the European Energy Exchange, the leading energy exchange in Central Europe. VNG \u2013 Verbundnetz Gas AG, one of Germany's large natural gas suppliers, is headquartered at Leipzig. In addition, inside its larger metropolitan area, Leipzig has developed an important petrochemical centre.\nSome of the largest employers in the area (outside of manufacturing) include software companies such as Spreadshirt and the various schools and universities in and around the Leipzig/Halle region. The University of Leipzig attracts millions of euros of investment yearly and celebrated its 600th birthday in 2009.\nLeipzig also benefits from world-leading medical research (Leipzig Heart Centre) and a growing biotechnology industry.\nMany bars, restaurants and stores in the downtown area are patronized by German and foreign tourists. Leipzig Main Train Station is the location of a shopping mall. Leipzig is one of Germany's most visited cities with over 3\u00a0million overnight stays in 2017.\nIn 2010, Leipzig was included in the top 10 cities to visit by \"The New York Times\", and ranked 39th globally out of 289 cities for innovation in the 4th Innovation Cities Index published by Australian agency 2thinknow. In 2015, Leipzig have among the 30 largest German cities the third best prospects for the future. In recent years Leipzig has often been nicknamed the \"Boomtown of eastern Germany\" or \"Hypezig\". As of 2013[ [update]] it had the highest rate of population growth of any German city.\nCompanies with operations in or around Leipzig include:\nSocio-ecological infrastructure.\nLeipzig has a dense network of socio-ecological infrastructures. Worth mentioning in the food sector are the \"Fairteiler\" of foodsharing and the numerous Community-supported agricultures, in the textile sector the \"Umsonstladen\" in Plagwitz, in the bicycle self-help workshops the \"Radsfatz\", in the computer sector the Hackerspace \"Die Dezentrale\", and in the repair sector the \"Caf\u00e9 kaputt\".\nQuality of life.\nIn December 2013, according to a study by GfK, Leipzig was ranked as the most livable city in Germany.\nIn 2015/2016, Leipzig was named by the consumer portal verbraucherzentrale.de as the second-best city for students in Germany (after Munich).\nIn a 2017 study from the Institut f\u00fcr Handelsforschung K\u00f6ln, the Leipzig inner city ranked first among all large cities in Germany due to its urban aesthetics, gastronomy, and shopping opportunities.\nAccording to HWWI/Berenberg-St\u00e4dteranking, since 2018 it also has the second-best future prospects of all cities in Germany, second to Munich in 2018 and Berlin in 2019.\nAccording to a 2017 Global Least &amp; Most Stressful Cities Ranking by Zipjet, a London-based online laundry service, Leipzig was one of the least stressful cities in the World. It was ranked 25th out of 150 cities worldwide and above Dortmund, Cologne, Frankfurt, and Berlin.\nLeipzig was named European City of the Year at the 2019 Urbanism Awards.\nAccording to the 2019 study by Forschungsinstitut Prognos, Leipzig is the most dynamic region in Germany. Within 15 years, the city climbed 230 places and occupied in 2019 rank 104 of all 401 German regions.\nLeipzig was listed as one of 52 places to go in 2020 by \"The New York Times\" and the highest-ranking German destination.\nLeipzig Hauptbahnhof has been ranked the best railway station in Germany and the third-best in Europe in a consumer organisation poll, surpassed only by St Pancras railway station and Z\u00fcrich Hauptbahnhof.\nTransport.\nFounded at the crossing of Via Regia and Via Imperii, Leipzig has been a major interchange of inter-European traffic and commerce since medieval times. After the Reunification of Germany, immense efforts to restore and expand the traffic network have been undertaken and left the city area with an excellent infrastructure.\nAir.\nLeipzig/Halle Airport is the international commercial airport of the region. It is located at the Schkeuditzer Kreuz junction northwest of Leipzig, halfway between the two major cities. The easternmost section of the new Erfurt-Leipzig/Halle line under construction gave the airport a long-distance railway station, which was also integrated into the ICE network when the railway line was completed in 2015.\nPassenger flights are operated to and from the major German hub airports, European metropolises and holiday destinations, especially to the Mediterranean region and North Africa. The airport is of international importance in the cargo sector. In Germany, it ranks second behind Frankfurt am Main, fifth in Europe and 26th worldwide (as of 2011). DHL uses the airport as its central European hub. It is also the home base of the freight airlines Aerologic and European Air Transport Leipzig.\nThe former military airport near Altenburg, Thuringia, called Leipzig\u2013Altenburg Airport, about a half-hour drive from Leipzig, was served by Ryanair until 2010.\nRailways.\nOpened in 1915, Leipzig Hauptbahnhof (lit. \"main station\") is the largest overhead railway station in Europe in terms of its built-up area. At the same time, it is an important supra-regional junction in the Intercity-Express (ICE) and Intercity network of the as well as a connection point for S-Bahn and regional traffic in the Halle/Leipzig area.\nIn Leipzig the Intercity Express routes (Hamburg\u2013)Berlin\u2013Leipzig\u2013Nuremberg\u2013Munich and Dresden\u2013Leipzig\u2013Erfurt\u2013Frankfurt am Main\u2013(Wiesbaden/Saarbr\u00fccken) intersect. Leipzig is also the starting point for the intercity lines Leipzig-Halle (Saale)\u2013Magdeburg\u2013Hannover\u2013Dortmund\u2013K\u00f6ln and \u2013Bremen\u2013Oldenburg(\u2013Norddeich Mole). Both lines complement each other at hourly intervals and also stop at Leipzig/Halle Airport. The only international connection is the daily EuroCity Leipzig-Prague.\nMost major and medium-sized towns in Saxony and southern Saxony-Anhalt can be reached without changing trains. There are also direct connections via regional express lines to Falkenberg/Elster-Cottbus, Hoyerswerda and Dessau-Magdeburg as well as Chemnitz. Neighbouring Halle (Saale) can be reached via three S-Bahn lines, two of which run via Leipzig/Halle Airport. The surrounding area of Leipzig is served by numerous regional and S-Bahn lines.\nThe city's railway connections are currently being greatly improved by major construction projects, particularly within the framework of the German Unity transport projects. The line to Berlin has been extended and has been passable at since 2006. On 13 December 2015, the high-speed line from Leipzig to Erfurt, designed for , was put into operation. Its continuation to Nuremberg followed in December 2017. This integration into the high-speed network considerably reduced the journey times of the ICE from Leipzig to Nuremberg, Munich and Frankfurt am Main. The Leipzig-Dresden railway line, which was the first German long-distance railway to go into operation in 1839, is also undergoing expansion for 200\u00a0km/h. The most important construction project in regional transport was the four-kilometer-long city tunnel, which went into operation in December 2013 as the main line of the S-Bahn Mitteldeutschland.\nThere are freight stations in the districts of Wahren and Engelsdorf. In addition, a freight traffic centre has been set up near the Schkeuditzer Kreuz junction for goods handling between road and rail, as well as a freight station on the site of the DHL hub at Leipzig/Halle Airport.\nSuburban trains.\nLeipzig is the core of the S-Bahn Mitteldeutschland line network. Together with the tram, six of the ten lines form the backbone of local public transport and an important link to the region and the neighbouring Halle. The main line of the S-Bahn consists of the underground S-Bahn stations Hauptbahnhof, Markt, Wilhelm-Leuschner-Platz and Bayerischer Bahnhof leading through the City Tunnel as well as the above-ground station Leipzig MDR. There are a total of 30 S-Bahn stations in the Leipzig city area. Endpoints of the S-Bahn lines include Wurzen, Zwickau, Dessau, and Lutherstadt Wittenberg. Two lines run to Halle, one of them via Leipzig/Halle Airport.\nWith the timetable change in December 2004, the networks of Leipzig and Halle were combined to form the Leipzig-Halle S-Bahn. However, this network only served as a transitional solution and was replaced by the S-Bahn Mitteldeutschland on 15 December 2013. At the same time, the main line tunnel, marketed as the Leipzig City Tunnel, went into operation. The tunnel, which is almost four kilometres long, crosses the entire city centre from the main railway station to the Bavarian railway station. The S-Bahn stations are up to 22 metres underground. This construction was the first to create a continuous north\u2013south axis, which had not existed until now due to the north-facing terminus station. The connection to the south of the city and the federal state will thus be greatly improved.\nTramway and buses.\nThe Leipziger Verkehrsbetriebe, existing since 1 January 1917, operate a total of 15 tram lines and 47 bus lines in the city.\nThe total length of the tram network is , making it the largest in Saxony ahead of Dresden () and the second largest in Germany after Berlin ().\nThe longest line in the Leipzig network is line 11, which connects Schkeuditz with Markkleeberg over 22 kilometres and is the only tram line in Leipzig to run in three tariff zones of the Central German Transport Association.\nNight bus lines N1 to N9 and the night tram N17 operate in the night traffic. On Saturdays, Sundays and holidays the tram line N10 and the bus line N60 also operate. The central transfer point between the bus and tram lines as well as to the S-Bahn is Leipzig Central Station.\nBicycle.\nLike most German cities, Leipzig has a traffic layout designed to be bicycle-friendly. There is an extensive cycle network. In most of the one-way central streets, cyclists are explicitly allowed to cycle both ways. A few cycle paths have been built or declared since 1990. According to the data from the 2021/22 traffic count, the Saxons' Bridge has the highest traffic occupancy with over 15,000 cyclists per day in cycling in Leipzig.\nSince 2004 there is a bicycle-sharing system. Bikes can be borrowed and returned via smartphone app or by telephone. Since 2018, the system has enabled flexible borrowing and returning of bicycles in the inner city; in this zone, bicycles can be handed in and borrowed from almost any street corner. Outside these zones, there are stations where the bikes are waiting. The current locations of the bikes can be seen via the app. There are cooperation offers with the Leipzig public transport companies and car sharing in order to offer as complete a mobility chain as possible.\nRoad.\nSeveral federal motorways pass by Leipzig: the A 14 in the north, the A 9 in the west, and the A 38 in the south. The three motorways form a triangular partial ring of the double ring Mitteldeutsche Schleife around Halle and Leipzig. To the south towards Chemnitz, the A 72 is also partly under construction.\nThe federal roads B 2, B 6, B 87, B 181, and B 184 lead through the city area.\nThe ring road (Innenstadtring), which corresponds to the course of the old city fortification, surrounds the city centre of Leipzig, which today is largely traffic-calmed.\nLeipzig has a dense network of carsharing stations. Additionally, since 2018 there is also a stationless car sharing system in Leipzig. Here the cars can be parked and booked anywhere in the inner city without having to define a specific car or period in advance. Finding and booking is done via a smartphone app.\nLeipzig is one of the few cities in Germany with vehicle for hire services that can be booked via a mobile app. In contrast to taxicab services, the start and destination must be defined beforehand and other passengers can be taken along at the same time if they share a route.\nLong-distance buses.\nIn March 2018, the Leipzig Long-Distance Bus Terminal opened a few steps outside of the Hauptbahnhof building on its east side.\nIn addition to a large number of national lines, several international lines also serve Leipzig. The cities of Bregenz, Budapest, Milan, Prague, Sofia and Zurich, among others, can be reached without having to change trains. Around 30,000 journeys and 1.5\u00a0million passengers a year are expected at the new bus station.\nSome lines also use Leipzig/Halle Airport, located at the A 9/A 14 motorway junction, and Leipziger Messe for a stop. Passengers can take the S-Bahn from there to the city centre.\nWater.\nIn the first half of the 20th century, the construction of the Elster-Saale canal, White Elster, and Saale was started in Leipzig in order to connect to the network of waterways. The outbreak of the Second World War stopped most of the work, though some may have continued through the use of forced labor. The Lindenauer port was almost completed but not yet connected to the Elster-Saale and Karl Heine Canal respectively. The Leipzig rivers (White Elster, New Luppe, Plei\u00dfe, and Parthe) in the city have largely artificial river beds and are supplemented by some channels. These waterways are suitable only for small leisure boat traffic.\nThrough the renovation and reconstruction of existing mill races and watercourses in the south of the city and flooded disused open cast mines, the city's navigable water network is being expanded. A link between Karl Heine Canal and the disused Lindenauer port was opened in 2015. Still more work was scheduled to complete the Elster-Saale canal. Such a move would allow small boats to reach the Elbe from Leipzig. The intended completion date has been postponed because of an unacceptable cost-benefit ratio.\nQuotations.\n\"Mein Leipzig lob' ich mir!

{"id": "17956", "revid": "669117", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=17956", "title": "LimeWire", "text": "Peer-to-peer file sharing application\n \nLimeWire was a free peer-to-peer file sharing client for Windows, Mac OS X, Linux, and Solaris. Created by Mark Gorton in 2000, it was most prominently a tool used for the download and distribution of pirated materials, particularly pirated music. \nBoth a zero-cost version and a purchasable \"enhanced\" version called LimeWire Pro were available; however, LimeWire Pro could be acquired for free through the standard LimeWire software, where users distributed it without authorization. LimeWire uses the gnutella network as well as the BitTorrent protocol.\nOn October 26, 2010, U.S. federal court judge Kimba Wood issued an injunction ordering Lime Wire LLC to prevent \"the searching, downloading, uploading, file trading and/or file distribution functionality, and/or all functionality\" of its software in \"Arista Records LLC v. Lime Group LLC\". A trial investigating the damages necessary to compensate the affected record labels was scheduled to begin in January 2011. As a result of the injunction, the Recording Industry Association of America initially suggested that LimeWire was responsible for $72 trillion in damages, before eventually settling for $105 million. Thereafter, the company stopped distributing the LimeWire software, and versions 5.5.11 and newer have been disabled using a backdoor installed by the company. However, version 5.5.10 and all prior versions of LimeWire remain fully functional and cannot be disabled unless a user upgrades to one of the newer versions.\nFeatures.\nWritten in the Java programming language, LimeWire can run on any computer with a Java Virtual Machine installed. Installers were provided for Apple's Mac OS X, Microsoft's Windows, and Linux. Support for Mac OS 9 and other previous versions was dropped with the release of LimeWire 4.0.10. From version 4.8 onwards, LimeWire works as a UPnP Internet Gateway Device controller in that it can automatically set up packet-forwarding rules with UPnP-capable routers.\nLimeWire offers sharing of its library through the Digital Audio Access Protocol (DAAP). As such, when LimeWire is running and configured to allow it, any files shared are detectable and downloaded on the local network by DAAP-enabled devices (e.g., Zune, iTunes). Beginning with LimeWire 4.13.9, connections can be encrypted with Transport Layer Security (TLS). Following LimeWire 4.13.11, TLS became the default connection option.\nVersion history.\nUntil October 2010, Lime Wire LLC, the New York City based developer of LimeWire, distributed two versions of the program: a basic free version, and an enhanced version, LimeWire PRO, which sold for a fee of $21.95 with 6 months of updates, or around $35.00 with 1 year of updates. The company claimed the paid version provides faster downloads and 66% better search results. This is accomplished by facilitating direct connection with up to 10 hosts of an identical searched file at any one time, whereas the free version is limited to a maximum of 8 hosts.\nBeing free software, LimeWire has spawned forks, including LionShare, an experimental software development project at Penn State University, and Acquisition, a Mac OS X-based gnutella client with a proprietary interface. Researchers at Cornell University developed a reputation management add-in called Credence that allows users to distinguish between \"genuine\" and \"suspect\" files before downloading them. An October 12, 2005, report states that some of LimeWire's contributors have forked the project and called it FrostWire.\nLimeWire was the second file sharing program after FrostWire to support firewall-to-firewall file transfers, a feature introduced in version 4.2, which was released in November 2004. LimeWire included BitTorrent support, but it was limited to three torrent uploads and three torrent downloads, which coexisted with ordinary downloads. LimeWire 5.0 added an instant messenger that uses the XMPP Protocol, a free software communication protocol. Users can chat and share files with individuals or a group of friends in their buddy list.\nFrom version 5.5.1, LimeWire has added a key activation, which requires the user to enter the unique key before activating the \"Pro\" version of the software. This has stopped people from using downloaded \"Pro\" versions without authorization. However, there are still ways to bypass this security feature, which was done when creating the \"Pirate Edition\". For example, cracked versions of LimeWire were available on the Internet (including on LimeWire itself), and people could continue using the LimeWire Pro 5.5.1 Beta, which also includes AVG for LimeWire and is the first version to include AVG. The most recent stable version of LimeWire is 5.5.16.\nVersions of LimeWire prior to 5.5.10 can still connect to the Gnutella network and users of these versions are still able to download files, even though a message is displayed concerning the injunction during the startup process of the software. LimeWire versions 5.5.11 and newer feature an auto-update feature that allowed Lime Wire LLC to disable newer versions of the LimeWire software. Older versions of LimeWire prior to version 5.5.11, however, do not include the auto-update feature and are still fully functional. As a result, neither the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) nor Lime Wire LLC have the ability to disable older versions of LimeWire, unless the user chooses to upgrade to a newer version of LimeWire.\nOn November 10, 2010, a secret group of developers called the \"Secret Dev Team\" sought to keep the application working by releasing the \"LimeWire Pirate Edition\". The software is based on LimeWire 5.6 Beta, and is aimed to allow Windows versions to still work and remove the threat of spyware or adware. The exclusive features in LimeWire PRO were also unlocked, and all security features installed by Lime Wire LLC were removed.\nForks and alternatives.\nA number of forks of LimeWire have been released, many with the goal of giving users more freedom, or in objection to design decisions made by the original developers.\nFrostWire.\nFrostWire was started in September 2004 by members of the LimeWire community, after LimeWire's distributor considered adding \"blocking\" code, in response to RIAA pressure and the threat of legal action, in light of the U.S. Supreme Court's decision in \"MGM Studios, Inc. v. Grokster, Ltd.\". When eventually activated, the code could block its users from sharing licensed files. This code was changed when lawsuits had been filed against LimeWire for P2P downloading. It had blocked all their users and redirected them to FrostWire. FrostWire has since completely moved to the BitTorrent protocol from Gnutella (LimeWire's file sharing network).\nLimeWire Pirate Edition/WireShare.\nIn November 2010, as a response to the legal challenges regarding LimeWire, an anonymous individual by the handle of Meta Pirate released a modified version of LimeWire Pro, which was named LimeWire Pirate Edition. It came without the Ask.com toolbar, advertising, spyware, and backdoors, as well as all dependencies on Lime Wire LLC servers.\nIn response to allegations that a current or former member of Lime Wire LLC staff wrote and released the software, the company has stated they were \"not behind these efforts. LimeWire does not authorize them. LimeWire is complying with the Court's October 26, 2010 injunction.\"\nThe LimeWire team, after being accused by the RIAA of being complicit in the development of LimeWire Pirate Edition, swiftly acted to shut down the LimeWire Pirate Edition website. A court order was issued to close down the website, and, to remain anonymous, Meta Pirate, the developer of LimeWire PE, did not contest the order.\nFollowing the shutdown, the original LimeWire Pirate Edition project was reforked into WireShare, with the intent to keep the Gnutella network alive and to maintain a good faith continuation of the original project (without adware or spyware); development of the software continues to this day.\nMuWire.\nMuWire was released in August 2020 as a free software program resembling LimeWire. Developed by a former LimeWire developer, it uses I2P to anonymize connections and transfers. MuWire's developer had purchased the limewire.com domain after it had been allowed to expire, and redirected traffic to MuWire's website for approximately two years, until finally selling it to an unaffiliated party.\nCriticism.\nPrior to April 2004, the free version of LimeWire was distributed with a bundled program called LimeShop (a variant of TopMoxie), which was spyware. Among other things, LimeShop monitored online purchases in order to redirect sales commissions to Lime Wire LLC. Uninstallation of LimeWire would not remove LimeShop. These objections were addressed in 2004 with the removal of all bundled software in LimeWire 3.9.4.\nIn LimeWire versions before 5.0, users could accidentally configure the software to allow access to any file on their computer, including documents with personal information. Later versions of LimeWire disabled unintentional sharing of documents or applications. In 2005, the US Federal Trade Commission issued a warning regarding the dangers of peer-to-peer file sharing network usage, due to the risk of identity theft and lawsuits.\nFor example, a 2007 identity theft scheme involving LimeWire was discovered in what the U.S. Justice Department described as its first case against someone accused of using file sharing computer programs to commit identity theft. The perpetrator had used LimeWire to search other people's computers for inadvertently shared financial information, which he used it to obtain credit cards for an online shopping spree.\nOne investigation showed that of 123 randomly selected downloaded files, 37 contained malware \u2013 about 30%. In mid-2008, a Macintosh trojan exploiting a vulnerability involving Apple Remote Desktop was distributed via LimeWire affecting users of Mac OS X Tiger and Leopard. The ability to distribute such malware and viruses was reduced in versions of LimeWire 5.0 and greater, whose default search settings excluded executable files.\nAfter several years of opposing software bundling, LimeWire released an Ask.com-powered browser toolbar in 2010, which was automatically installed unless a user opted out. LimeWire automatically received a cryptographically signed file, called simpp.xml, containing an IP block list. It was the key technology behind the now defunct cyber security firm Tiversa which is alleged to have used information from the network to pressure prospective clients into engaging the company's services.\nDownfall.\nAccording to a June 2005 report in \"The New York Times\", Lime Wire LLC was considering ceasing its distribution of LimeWire because the outcome of \"MGM v. Grokster\" \"handed a tool to judges that they can declare inducement whenever they want to\". Nevertheless, the company continued operating and was sued by Arista Records, which obtained a favorable decision in 2010. Judge Kimba Wood of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York ruled in \"Arista Records LLC v. Lime Group LLC\" that LimeWire and Gorton had committed copyright infringement, engaged in unfair competition, and induced others to commit copyright infringement. Later in the year, after losing another court battle, with the RIAA, LimeWire was ordered to disable many of its software's capabilities due to the possibility of copyright infringement. The RIAA also announced its intention to seek damages for the program's effects on various record labels. In response to the ruling, a company spokesperson said that the company planned to continue operating and would cease distributing and supporting P2P software. RIAA announced a further lawsuit in early 2011, claiming statutory damages of $72 trillion, more than triple the world's annual GDP. The figure relied on an estimate of thousands of downloads for each of the platform's 11,000 songs In May 2011, Gorton agreed to a settlement whereby the company would pay thirteen record labels approximately $105 million. Mitch Bainwol, chairman of the RIAA, referred to the \"resolution of the case [as] another milestone in the continuing evolution of online music to a legitimate marketplace that appropriately rewards creators.\"\nName reuse by unrelated companies.\nIn 2022, Austrian brothers Julian and Paul Zehetmayr bought LimeWire's intellectual property and turned it into an NFT service.&lt;ref name=\"nbcnews/rcna231623\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;\nLimeWire's name was revived in 2022 for an unrelated music-based NFT platform, an action with which Gorton expressed displeasure. The NFT marketplace was launched in July 2022, with the first NFT collection from American record producer and rapper 7 Aurelius.\nIn September 2023, LimeWire bought BlueWillow, a generative artificial intelligence tool, and became a place to share images and videos created with it.\nIn 2025, it also acquired snapdrop.net and sharedrop.io, two similar but unrelated services which allowed instant file sharing over a local network.\nIn September 2025, LimeWire acquired the Fyre Festival brand, including its intellectual property, trademarks, online domains, and social media assets, from Billy McFarland via an auction held on eBay.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "17957", "revid": "48867554", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=17957", "title": "Latveria", "text": "Fictional country in Marvel Comics\nLatveria is a fictional country appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. It is depicted within the storylines of Marvel's comic titles as a small, isolated European country ruled by the fictional Supreme Lord Doctor Doom, supposedly located in the Banat region. It is surrounded by the Carpathian Mountains, and also borders fictional Symkaria (home of Silver Sable) to the south. Its capital is Doomstadt.\nPublication history.\nLatveria first appeared in \"Fantastic Four Annual\" #2, which was published in 1964. Victor von Doom is the ruler of Latveria. Though he has been dethroned a number of times, Victor has invariably managed to return to the throne of his country within a matter of months.\nVictor also has a Council who obeys him entirely. In \"Fantastic Four\" #536 in 2006, he killed his own Prime Minister for claiming control of Latveria in his absence and threatened to kill two other ministers if they failed to find the landing spot of Thor's hammer Mj\u00f6lnir.\nDoctor Doom's style of rule can best be described as an absolute monarchy, as it was revealed that there is no legislature, and one minister boasted \"Doctor Doom decides everything. His slightest whim is Latverian law!\" It is shown Doom has devices throughout the Kingdom to watch his people and even has hidden weapons to prevent them leaving without his consent. In one story he is able to activate a force field around Latveria which prevents anybody leaving, though apparently it can be a defense against nuclear attack.\nHistory.\nLocated in southeast Europe, Latveria was formed out of land annexed from southern Hungary centuries before, and possibly land from Serbia as well as Romania.\nAt some point, Doctor Doom had his army of Servo Guards invade Rotruvia where he was successful in its annexation.\nLatveria under the Fantastic Four.\nDue to Doom's undertakings that drive him away from Latveria, the monarch is often absent. After Doom's descent into Hell, the nation became a target for conquest by the neighbouring countries. This forces Reed Richards to seize control of the country, attempting to pry the populace out from under the thumb of Doom, while at the same time disarming all of Doom's weaponry and technology, so if he ever returned, he would come back to absolutely nothing. In the process, Richards relocated Doom from Hell into a pocket dimension of his own design, and although Doom used his consciousness-switching abilities to escape, the death of his host body seemingly caused him to die as well, and the Fantastic Four pulled out of the country.\nDoom survives this and rules Latveria for a time with a 'puppet' Prime Minister and robotic enforcers.\nSeries of takeovers.\nAfter the Fantastic Four left, the United States attempted to fill the void left by Doom by establishing a democracy for the nation. The Countess Lucia von Bardas was elected as Prime Minister. However, when it was revealed that von Bardas was employing the Tinkerer to use Doom's technology to arm various tech-based villains in the United States, S.H.I.E.L.D. Commander Nick Fury took action.\nDuring \"Secret War\", Fury and a number of superheroes invaded Latveria without permission of the US Government and attempted to assassinate von Bardas. While von Bardas survived, she was horribly disfigured and sought to destroy Fury and the heroes responsible. She was killed by S.H.I.E.L.D. Agent Daisy Johnson while trying to blow up New York with the armor of the various villains she employed.\nCountry-wide disasters.\nMuch of Latveria was destroyed and the population severely reduced by an attack executed by the Marquis of Death (a.k.a. \"Dooms Master\").\nS.H.I.E.L.D., under the leadership of Iron Man and his team of U.S. sanctioned Avengers invaded Latveria after discovering Doom's (unintentional) involvement in the release of a symbiote virus on New York. The country was yet again devastated and Doom was taken into custody for crimes against humanity.\nDoom is released from prison due to the influence of H.A.M.M.E.R. director Norman Osborn. He restores his nation with the use of his time travel technology.\nAvengers Vs. X-Men.\nDuring the \"Avengers vs. X-Men\" storyline, Spider-Man fights against a Juggernaut-empowered Colossus here.\nStatistics.\nThe common geographic description of Latveria places it as a small nation, around the area where Hungary, Romania and Serbia (Vojvodina) meet in real life. To its south in the Marvel universe is the nation of Symkaria, which is depicted as a benevolent constitutional monarchy in contrast to the dictatorship to its north. The capital city of Latveria is Doomstadt, formerly Hassenstadt, renamed when Doom seized power, located just north of the Kline River. The administrative center is Castle Doom.\nDemographics.\nThe population consists of mixed European stock and Romani people, in whose welfare Von Doom takes a particular interest. Victor Von Doom, being Roma, has declared the Romani a protected class and attempts to shower them with benefits, however due to Latveria's poor economy and oppressive rule their lifestyles hardly outshine other ethnicities, and the Romani by and large live in the same fear of their own government as do fellow Latverians.\nLaw enforcement.\nBecause it lacks a native superhero populace, Latveria relies largely on Dooms' robot sentinels called Doombots to keep law and order. One of the few known Latverian superhumans is Dreadknight, whom Doom himself created by punishing Dreadknight's alter ego for hoarding ideas from him. Dreadknight has since tried to get revenge on Doctor Doom, only to be thwarted by various superheroes. Aside from superhuman activity, the Latverian military appears to function in multiple capacity; in addition to being responsible for defense of Latveria (or more accurately, keeping Victor Von Doom on the throne), they have been commissioned to make arrests and function as Latveria's secret police.\nEconomy.\nMuch of Latveria's economy depends on Doctor Doom's high-tech inventions. The country's official currency is the \"Latverian Franc\" \u2013 because Doctor Doom refuses to join the European Union or adopt the Euro. The Latverian Franc is still considered to be reasonably strong against the United States Dollar.\nState.\nLatveria is generally depicted as a rural nation with a primitive economy and a population living an almost medieval lifestyle, likely enforced by Doom. Nonetheless, the state itself is consistently depicted as a global superpower on-par with or even surpassing any nation on Earth, including the United States, and rivalled only by the likes of Wakanda. This is largely due to Doom himself being a scientific genius of the highest order, not only possessing but actually inventing numerous technological wonders, including time and interdimensional travel, personally creating a highly sophisticated robot army of myriad designs and capabilities, and frequently coming into possession of\u2014or outright creating\u2014various devices that could be classified as Weapons of Mass Destruction. Thus, despite the country being both extremely small and economically backward, it is a powerhouse in military and technological terms and therefore has a vastly disproportionate influence on global affairs relative to its size and GDP. Doom also proudly claims that the country is free of poverty, disease, famine and crime and while citizens of the nation are commonly shown to be oppressed and to live in fear of their monarch, they are also shown to be relatively well cared for, so long as they do not cross Doom. Other occasions suggest that Doom is at the centre of a self-propagated personality cult and is admired and worshipped by other segments of the populace in spite of his mistreatments and he is often demonstrated to be at least a more stable and less corrupt ruler than any other Latverian leader who has replaced him.\nOther versions.\nKing Loki.\nIn the future depicted in \"Loki: Agent of Asgard\", Doctor Doom discovers Latveria completely destroyed after King Loki destroyed the Earth. Doom attempts to prevent this future by imprisoning the Loki of the present.\n\"Marvel 1602\".\nIn the \"Marvel 1602\" storyline, Latveria is ruled by Count Otto von Doom, also known as \"Otto the Handsome\". It is inhabited by mythical beings, and Latveria experiments on intricate clockwork devices, one of which was used to kill Queen Elizabeth I of England. The native language appears to bear a close resemblance to modern German.\nMarvel 2099.\nIn the alternate future called \"Marvel 2099\", various power struggles over the fate of Latveria end with most of the country's population destroyed by chemical weapons known as \"necrotoxins\".\nMarvel Zombies.\nIn the \"Marvel Zombies\" storyline, Latveria is one of the last few outposts of humanity, as Doctor Doom gathers up the fittest and most fertile of the Latverian survivors in order to send them off to other dimensions. An army of super-zombies lay siege to Doom's castle and eventually break inside. Despite this and Doom himself being bitten, all the Latverian citizens successfully escape.\nUltimate Marvel.\nIn \"Ultimate Marvel\", Latveria was introduced as a bankrupt peasant nation, but thanks to Doctor Doom it was made the ninth richest country on Earth. The townsfolk wear Doom's dragon tattoos, which incorporate microfibers that interfaced with the brain, acting as mind control devices. Where this Latveria lies is unclear but there are Belgian Flags on display in the background in the one picture displayed of Latveria.\nIn \"Ultimate Marvel Team-Up\", Latveria was presented as an impoverished dictatorial theocracy, under \"his holiness\" President Victor Von Doom (wearing his traditional Marvel armor and cloak). They attempted, in collusion with the United States via Nick Fury, to steal the Iron Man technology from Tony Stark; this fails, partly due to the intervention of Spider-Man. At some point, however, Doom declared a holy war on the United States, creating tensions between two countries. Like most in this comic, this would be ignored and retconned away in later Ultimate Marvel titles.\nUltimate Universe.\nIn Earth-6160, a world marked by alternate history due to the interference of the Maker, Latveria is used as his seat of political power, as he reshapes the global status quo, eroding national identities and independence in favor of a new world order, creating a Council composed of leaders of regional power blocs and creating a permanent war economy between their territories, while they operate covertly as a group, keeping their local populations docile and controlled as a worldwide form of shadow government.\nIt is shown through Howard Stark's history files that the Maker arrived in 1963, establishing a futuristic enclave known as \"The City\" in Latveria, showcasing himself as a force of progress to the world and performing feats such as taking care of external threats such as Galactus and performing a moon landing. He is regarded as an Imperator, or the de facto ruler of the Earth, due to being the only one capable of keeping the public safe and disseminating technological advances on a regular base, using the organization H.A.N.D as a secret police. As Stark rebels against the Maker, he imprisons both of them and Kang inside the City, leaving two years before it opens.\nIn other media.\nMiscellaneous.\nLatveria appears in the \"Spider-Man\" newspaper strip.\nReception.\n\"Bustle\" published a humorous article about how to convince people that Latveria is a real place, saying \"Latveria doesn't \"sound\" made up [...] in this case, Latveria is very much fake \u2014 which doesn't mean you can't still have fun convincing people it's real, though.\"\n\"Screen Rant\" writes that ever since \"The Fantastic Four\" #5 was published in 1962, \"the tiny country of Latveria has long been a thorn in the side of Marvel's heroes\", noting that it was long established as a country located in Southeastern Europe, and as of 2020 its location was firmly identified as the Banat region, so that \"This fixed location for Latveria grounds the nation more fully in readers' understanding of the real world, suggesting realistic political tensions and even geographical factors which can play into future stories.\"\nMark Hibbett of Central Saint Martins notes that Latveria in 1964 was described as a small country in East Europe \"nestling in the heart of the Bavarian alps\", and he explains that \"Right from the start Latveria is presented as a very strange place, like a fairy tale village transplanted into the real world, with Jack Kirby's illustrations showing an almost medieval world of peasant cottages and gypsy caravans.\"\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Since division of integers by zero is undefined, this definition has meaning only if \"a\" and \"b\" are both different from zero. However, some authors define lcm(\"a\", 0) as 0 for all \"a\", since 0 is the only common multiple of \"a\" and 0.\nThe least common multiple of the denominators of two fractions is the \"lowest common denominator\" (lcd), and can be used for adding, subtracting or comparing the fractions.\nThe least common multiple of more than two integers \"a\", \"b\", \"c\", . . . , usually denoted by lcm(\"a\",\u00a0\"b\",\u00a0\"c\", . . .), is defined as the smallest positive integer that is divisible by each of \"a\", \"b\", \"c\", . . .\nOverview.\nA multiple of a number is the product of that number and an integer. For example, 10 is a multiple of 5 because 5 \u00d7 2 = 10, so 10 is divisible by 5 and 2. Because 10 is the smallest positive integer that is divisible by both 5 and 2, it is the least common multiple of 5 and 2. By the same principle, 10 is the least common multiple of \u22125 and \u22122 as well.\nNotation.\nThe least common multiple of two integers \"a\" and \"b\" is denoted as lcm(\"a\", \"b\"). Some older textbooks use [\"a\", \"b\"].\nformula_1\nExample.\nMultiples of 4 are:\nformula_2\nMultiples of 6 are:\nformula_3\n\"Common multiples\" of 4 and 6 are the numbers that are in both lists:\nformula_4\nIn this list, the smallest number is 12. Hence, the \"least common multiple\" is\u00a012.\nApplications.\nWhen adding, subtracting, or comparing simple fractions, the least common multiple of the denominators (often called the lowest common denominator) is used, because each of the fractions can be expressed as a fraction with this denominator. For example,\nformula_5\nwhere the denominator 42 was used, because it is the least common multiple of 21 and 6.\nGears problem.\nSuppose there are two meshing gears in a machine, having \"m\" and \"n\" teeth, respectively, and the gears are marked by a line segment drawn from the center of the first gear to the center of the second gear. When the gears begin rotating, the number of rotations the first gear must complete to realign the line segment can be calculated by using formula_6. The first gear must complete formula_7 rotations for the realignment. By that time, the second gear will have made formula_8 rotations.\nPlanetary alignment.\nSuppose there are three planets revolving around a star which take \"l\", \"m\" and \"n\" units of time, respectively, to complete their orbits. Assume that \"l\", \"m\" and \"n\" are integers. Assuming the planets started moving around the star after an initial linear alignment, all the planets attain a linear alignment again after formula_9 units of time. At this time, the first, second and third planet will have completed formula_10, formula_11 and formula_12 orbits, respectively, around the star.\nCalculation.\nThere are several ways to compute least common multiples.\nUsing the greatest common divisor.\nThe least common multiple can be computed from the greatest common divisor (gcd) with the formula\nformula_13\nTo avoid introducing integers that are larger than the result, it is convenient to use the equivalent formulas\nformula_14\nwhere the result of the division is always an integer.\nThese formulas are also valid when exactly one of \"a\" and \"b\" is 0, since gcd(\"a\", 0) = |\"a\"|. However, if both \"a\" and \"b\" are 0, these formulas would cause division by zero; so, lcm(0, 0) = 0 must be considered as a special case.\nTo return to the example above,\nformula_15\nThere are fast algorithms, such as the Euclidean algorithm for computing the gcd that do not require the numbers to be factored. For very large integers, there are even faster algorithms for the three involved operations (multiplication, gcd, and division); see Fast multiplication. As these algorithms are more efficient with factors of similar size, it is more efficient to divide the largest argument of the lcm by the gcd of the arguments, as in the example above.\nUsing prime factorization.\nThe unique factorization theorem indicates that every positive integer greater than 1 can be written in only one way as a product of prime numbers. The prime numbers can be considered as the atomic elements which, when combined, make up a composite number.\nFor example:\nformula_16\nHere, the composite number 90 is made up of one atom of the prime number 2, two atoms of the prime number 3, and one atom of the prime number 5.\nThis fact can be used to find the lcm of a set of numbers.\nExample: lcm(8,9,21)\nFactor each number and express it as a product of prime number powers.\n formula_17\nThe lcm will be the product of multiplying the highest power of each prime number together. The highest power of the three prime numbers 2, 3, and 7 is 23, 32, and 71, respectively. Thus,\nformula_18\nThis method is not as efficient as reducing to the greatest common divisor, since there is no known general efficient algorithm for integer factorization.\nThe same method can also be illustrated with a Venn diagram as follows, with the prime factorization of each of the two numbers demonstrated in each circle and \"all\" factors they share in common in the intersection. The lcm then can be found by multiplying all of the prime numbers in the diagram.\nHere is an example:\n 48 = 2 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 3,\n 180 = 2 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 5,\nsharing two \"2\"s and a \"3\" in common:\n Least common multiple = 2 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 5 = 720\n Greatest common divisor = 2 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 3 = 12\n Product = 2 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 5 = 8640\nThis also works for the greatest common divisor (gcd), except that instead of multiplying all of the numbers in the Venn diagram, one multiplies only the prime factors that are in the intersection. Thus the gcd of 48 and 180 is 2\u00a0\u00d7\u00a02\u00a0\u00d7\u00a03\u00a0=\u00a012.\nFormulas.\nFundamental theorem of arithmetic.\nAccording to the fundamental theorem of arithmetic, every integer greater than 1 can be represented uniquely as a product of prime numbers, up to the order of the factors:\nformula_19\nwhere the exponents \"n\"2, \"n\"3, ... are non-negative integers; for example, 84 = 22 31 50 71 110 130 ...\nGiven two positive integers formula_20 and formula_21, their greatest common divisor and least common multiple are given by the formulas\nformula_22\nand\nformula_23\nSince\nformula_24\nthis gives\nformula_25\nIn fact, every rational number can be written uniquely as the product of primes, if negative exponents are allowed. When this is done, the above formulas remain valid. For example:\nformula_26\nLattice-theoretic.\nThe positive integers may be partially ordered by divisibility: if \"a\" divides \"b\" (that is, if \"b\" is an integer multiple of \"a\") write \"a\" \u2264 \"b\" (or equivalently, \"b\" \u2265 \"a\"). (Note that the usual magnitude-based definition of \u2264 is not used here.)\nUnder this ordering, the positive integers become a lattice, with meet given by the gcd and join given by the lcm. The proof is straightforward, if a bit tedious; it amounts to checking that lcm and gcd satisfy the axioms for meet and join. Putting the lcm and gcd into this more general context establishes a duality between them:\n\"If a formula involving integer variables, gcd, lcm, \u2264 and \u2265 is true, then the formula obtained by switching gcd with lcm and switching \u2265 with \u2264 is also true.\" (Remember \u2264 is defined as divides).\nThe following pairs of dual formulas are special cases of general lattice-theoretic identities.\nIt can also be shown that this lattice is distributive; that is, lcm distributes over gcd and gcd distributes over lcm:\nformula_27\nformula_28\nThis identity is self-dual:\nformula_29\nOther.\nThen\nformula_30\nwhere the absolute bars || denote the cardinality of a set.\nformula_32\nIn commutative rings.\nThe least common multiple can be defined generally over commutative rings as follows:\nLet a and b be elements of a commutative ring R. A \"common multiple\" of a and b is an element m of R such that both a and b divide m (that is, there exist elements x and y of R such that \"ax\" \n \"m\" and \"by\" \n \"m\"). A \"least common multiple\" of a and b is a common multiple that is minimal, in the sense that for any other common multiple n of a and b, m divides\u00a0n.\nIn general, two elements in a commutative ring can have no least common multiple or more than one. However, any two least common multiples of the same pair of elements are associates. In a unique factorization domain, any two elements have a least common multiple. In a principal ideal domain, the least common multiple of a and b can be characterised as a generator of the intersection of the ideals generated by a and b (the intersection of a collection of ideals is always an ideal).\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "17962", "revid": "41849648", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=17962", "title": "Louis St. Laurent", "text": "Prime Minister of Canada from 1948 to 1957\nLouis Stephen St. Laurent (; February 1, 1882\u00a0\u2013 July 25, 1973) was a Canadian lawyer and politician who served as the 12th prime minister of Canada from 1948 to 1957.\nBorn and raised in southeastern Quebec, St. Laurent was a leading lawyer and supporter of the Liberal Party of Canada. In 1941, he entered politics as minister of justice under Prime Minister William Lyon Mackenzie King, and in 1942 he won a by-election in the riding of Quebec East. In 1946, St. Laurent became secretary of state for external affairs and served in that post until two years later, when he became leader of the Liberal Party and prime minister, succeeding King who had retired. St. Laurent led the party to back-to-back landslide majority governments in the federal elections of 1949 and 1953.\nSt. Laurent was the second French Canadian to serve as prime minister, following Wilfrid Laurier. His government initiated major public works projects, including the Trans-Canada Highway, the St. Lawrence Seaway, the Canso Causeway, and the Trans-Canada Pipeline. He expanded the Canadian welfare state through the introduction of equalization payments, the creation of the registered retirement savings plan (RRSP), and the implementation of the Hospital Insurance program; the latter constituting an early form of Medicare. In 1953, his government authorized the High Arctic relocation, resulting in the forced displacement of 92 Inuit to modern-day Nunavut. In foreign policy, St. Laurent oversaw Canada's entry to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and committed the third largest overall contribution of troops, ships, and aircraft to the Korean War. In 1956, under his direction, St. Laurent's secretary of state for external affairs, Lester B. Pearson, helped resolve the Suez Crisis, for which Pearson received the 1957 Nobel Peace Prize.\nSt. Laurent earned the nickname \"Uncle Louis\" as he was popular among the general public throughout his tenure, and the popularity of his government led many to predict that he would easily win the 1957 federal election. However, his decision to rush the 1956 debate on the Trans-Canada Pipeline by invoking closure led some to believe that the Liberals had become arrogant from their two decades in power. In an upset, the party was narrowly defeated by John Diefenbaker's Progressive Conservatives, ending nearly 22 years of Liberal rule. Shortly after his defeat, St. Laurent retired from politics and returned to his law practice. He is ranked highly in rankings of Canadian prime ministers. According to historian Donald Creighton, St. Laurent was \"eminently moderate, cautious...and a strong Canadian nationalist.\"\nEarly life, family, and education (1882\u20131905).\nLouis St. Laurent () was born on February 1, 1882, in Compton, Quebec, a village in the Eastern Townships, to Jean-Baptiste-Mo\u00efse Saint-Laurent, a French Canadian, and Mary Anne Broderick, an Irish Canadian. Louis was the oldest of seven children. At the time of his birth, Compton was mainly English-speaking, though it would slowly become majority French between 1901 and 1911. St. Laurent grew up fluently bilingual, as his father spoke French while his mother only spoke English. His English had a noticeable Irish brogue, while his gestures (such as a hunch of the shoulders) were French. St. Laurent was also interested in English literature as a child. The St. Laurent home would serve as a social centre for the village.\nSt. Laurent's father, Jean-Baptiste, was a Compton shopkeeper and a staunch supporter of the Liberal Party of Canada and Sir Wilfrid Laurier. Jean-Baptiste would unsuccessfully run in a provincial by-election in 1894. When Laurier led the Liberals to victory in the 1896 election, 14-year-old Louis relayed the election returns from the telephone in his father's store.\nSt. Laurent received degrees from S\u00e9minaire Saint-Charles-Borrom\u00e9e (B.A. 1902) and (LL.L. 1905). He was offered, but declined, a Rhodes Scholarship upon this graduation from Laval in 1905. In 1908, he married Jeanne Renault (1886\u20131966), with whom he had two sons and three daughters, including Jean-Paul St. Laurent.\nLegal career (1905\u20131942).\nSt. Laurent worked as a lawyer from 1905 to 1942. He also became a professor of law at Universit\u00e9 Laval in 1914. St. Laurent practised corporate, commercial and constitutional law in Quebec and became one of the country's most respected counsel. St. Laurent served as president of the Canadian Bar Association from 1930 to 1932.\nIn 1907, St. Laurent gained some attention in Quebec after he made a move that was viewed unusual at the time: he put a priest and nuns on the witness stand and cross-examined them. This occurred during his engagement in a case contesting the will of a woman who had left everything she owned to her parish priest. In 1912, St. Laurent won a case against Canadian Pacific. In 1913, he was one of the defending counsel for Harry Kendall Thaw, who was seeking to avoid extradition from Quebec.\nIn 1923, St. Laurent opened his own law office. In 1926, in a test case before the Supreme Court, St. Laurent argued for religious minority (non-Christian) rights. He was in favour of Jewish demand for representation on Montreal\u2019s Protestant Board of School Commissioners and he also supported a separate Jewish system of schools. Though St. Laurent's bid to have Jewish representation in the school board was unsuccessful, the province of Quebec recognized the right to establish separate schools for non-Christians.\nThough an ardent Liberal, Louis remained aloof from active politics for much of his life, focusing instead on his legal career and family. He became one of Quebec's leading lawyers and was so highly regarded that he was twice offered a seat as a justice on the Supreme Court of Canada, offers he declined.\nCabinet minister (1942\u20131948).\nMinister of Justice.\nIt was not until he was nearly 60 that St. Laurent finally agreed to enter politics when Liberal Prime Minister William Lyon Mackenzie King appealed to his sense of duty in late 1941. King's Quebec lieutenant, Ernest Lapointe, had died in November 1941. King believed that his Quebec lieutenant had to be strong enough and respected enough to help deal with the volatile conscription issue. King had been a junior politician when he witnessed the Conscription Crisis of 1917 during World War I and wanted to prevent the same divisions from threatening his government. Many recommended St. Laurent for the post. On these recommendations, King recruited St. Laurent to cabinet as Minister of Justice, Lapointe's former post, on 9 December. St. Laurent agreed to go to Ottawa out of a sense of duty, but only on the understanding that his foray into politics was temporary and that he would return to Quebec at the conclusion of the war. In February 1942, he won a by-election for Quebec East, Lapointe's former riding, which had been previously held by Laurier. St. Laurent supported King's decision to introduce conscription in 1944 (see Conscription Crisis of 1944). His support prevented more than a handful of Quebec Liberal Members of Parliament (MPs) from leaving the party and was therefore crucial to keeping the government and the party united. St. Laurent was King's right-hand man.\nSt. Laurent represented Canada at the 1945 San Francisco Conference that helped lead to the founding of the United Nations (UN).\nIn 1944, St. Laurent oversaw the creation of family allowances. In 1945, St. Laurent supported a program of economic reconstruction and more social welfare, which consisted of federal-provincial cost-sharing schemes for old-age pensions and hospital and medical insurance. Some officials were worried that these sweeping changes would cause disputes between the federal and provincial governments, but St. Laurent believed that Canadians identified with and supported these programs, stating that \"[they] were constantly made aware of the services which provincial governments render while they tended to think of the central government as one imposing burdens such as taxation and conscription.\"\nIn September 1945, Soviet cipher clerk Igor Gouzenko unexpectedly arrived at St. Laurent's office with evidence of a Soviet spy ring operating in Canada, the United States, and the United Kingdom. Known as the Gouzenko Affair, the revelations and subsequent investigations over the following few years showed major Soviet espionage in North America.\nMinister of external affairs.\nKing came to regard St. Laurent as his most trusted minister and natural successor. He persuaded St. Laurent that it was his duty to remain in government following the war in order to help with the construction of a post-war international order and promoted him to the position of secretary of state for external affairs (foreign minister) in 1946, a portfolio King had always kept for himself.\nIn January 1947, St. Laurent delivered a speech at the University of Toronto, highlighting the need for an independent Canadian foreign policy that would not always rely on the United Kingdom. St. Laurent's speech implied that Canadian foreign policy was only an extension of British foreign policy. He also said that Canada should have the \u201cwillingness to accept international responsibilities.\u201d\nUnited Nations.\nSt. Laurent, compelled by his belief that the UN would be ineffective in times of war and armed conflict without some military means to impose its will, advocated the adoption of a UN military force. This force he proposed would be used in situations that called for both tact and might to preserve peace or prevent combat. In 1956, this idea was actualized by St. Laurent and his secretary of state for external affairs, Lester B. Pearson, in the development of UN peacekeepers that helped to put an end to the Suez Crisis.\nSt. Laurent also believed that the UN was failing to provide international security from communism from the Soviet Union. He therefore proposed an Atlantic security organization that would supplement the UN. That would become reality in 1949, when the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) was founded. St. Laurent is seen as one of the first people in power to propose such an institution.\nAnnexation of Newfoundland.\nSt. Laurent was a strong supporter of the Dominion of Newfoundland joining Canada. He ignored objections from the government of Quebec, which had land claims against Newfoundland and demanded a right of veto over the admission of any new province or territory. St. Laurent led two negotiations with Newfoundland and Joey Smallwood in the summer of 1947 and the fall of 1948. These negotiations were successful, and on March 31, 1949, Canada annexed Newfoundland and Labrador, with St. Laurent presiding over the ceremonies in Ottawa as prime minister.\n1948 Liberal Party leadership convention.\nIn 1948, MacKenzie King retired after over 21 years in power, and quietly persuaded his senior ministers to support St. Laurent's selection as the new Liberal leader at the Liberal leadership convention that took place on August 7, 1948, exactly 29 years after King became leader. St. Laurent easily won, defeating two other opponents.\nPrime Minister (1948\u20131957).\nSt. Laurent was sworn in as prime minister of Canada on 15 November 1948, making him Canada's second French Canadian prime minister, after Wilfrid Laurier.\nSt. Laurent was the first prime minister to live in the official residence of the Prime Minister of Canada, 24 Sussex Drive (then known as 24 Sussex Street), from 1951 to 1957.\nFederal election victories.\n1949 federal election.\nSt. Laurent's first mission was to give the Liberals a new mandate. In the 1949 federal election that followed his ascension to the Liberal leadership, many wondered, including Liberal Party insiders, if St. Laurent would appeal to the post-war populace of Canada. On the campaign trail, St. Laurent's image was developed into somewhat of a 'character' and what is considered to be the first 'media image' to be used in Canadian politics. St. Laurent chatted with children, gave speeches in his shirt sleeves, and had a 'common touch' that turned out to be appealing to voters. At one event during the 1949 election campaign, he disembarked his train and instead of approaching the assembled crowd of adults and reporters, gravitated to, and began chatting with, a group of children on the platform. A reporter submitted an article entitled \"Uncle Louis can't lose!\" which earned him the nickname \"Uncle Louis\" in the media (\"Papa Louis\" in Quebec). With this common touch and broad appeal, he led the party to victory in the election against the Progressive Conservative Party (PC Party) led by George Drew. The Liberals won 191 seats \u2013 the most in Canadian history at the time, and still a record for the party. This is also the Liberals' second-most successful result in their history in terms of proportion of seats, behind the 1940 federal election.\n1953 federal election.\nSt. Laurent led the Liberals to another powerful majority in the 1953 federal election, once again defeating PC leader Drew. Though they lost 22 seats, they still had three dozen seats more than the number needed for a majority, enabling them to dominate the House of Commons.\nForeign policy.\nSt. Laurent and his cabinet oversaw Canada's expanding international role in the postwar world. His stated desire was for Canada to occupy a social, military, and economic middle power role in the post-World War II world. In 1947, he identified the five basic principles of Canadian foreign policy and five practical applications regarding Canada's international relations. Always highly sensitive to cleavages of language, religion, and region, he stressed national unity, insisting, \"that our external policies shall not destroy our unity\u00a0... for a disunited Canada will be a powerless one.\" He also stressed political liberty and rule of law in the sense of opposition to totalitarianism.\nMilitarily, St. Laurent was a leading proponent of the establishment of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) in 1949, serving as an architect and signatory of the treaty document. Involvement in such an organization marked a departure from King who had been reticent about joining a military alliance. Under his leadership, Canada supported the United Nations (UN) in the Korean War and committed the third largest overall contribution of troops, ships and aircraft to the U.N. forces to the conflict. Troops to Korea were selected on a voluntary basis. St. Laurent sent over 26,000 troops to fight in the war. In 1956, under his direction, St. Laurent's secretary of state for external affairs, Lester B. Pearson, helped solve the Suez Crisis between Great Britain, France, Israel and Egypt, bringing forward St. Laurent's 1946 views on a U.N. military force in the form of the United Nations Emergency Force (UNEF) or peacekeeping. These actions were recognized when Pearson won the 1957 Nobel Peace Prize.\nIn early 1954, St. Laurent took a 42-day long tour around the world, citing his desire to get a better picture of what he said, \"the problems which all of us have to face together.\" He visited 12 countries in total, including France, Germany, Japan, India, and Pakistan. When he returned to Canada, St. Laurent's personality and character appeared to slightly change; cabinet ministers noticed he showed signs of fatigue and indifference. Some even claimed he started to feel depressed. Author Dale C. Thomson wrote, \"[the tour was] his greatest hour but it marked as well the beginning of his decline; as such, it was a turning point both for him and for Canadian politics.\"\nSocial and economic policies.\nIt took taxation surpluses no longer needed by the wartime military and paying back in full Canada's debts accrued during the World Wars and the Great Depression. With remaining revenues, St. Laurent oversaw the expansion of Canada's social programs, including the gradual expansion of social welfare programs such as family allowances, old age pensions, government funding of university and post-secondary education and an early form of Medicare termed \"Hospital Insurance\" at the time. This scheme laid the groundwork for Tommy Douglas' healthcare system in Saskatchewan, and Pearson's nationwide universal healthcare in the late 1960s. Under this legislation, the federal government paid around 50% of the cost of provincial health plans to cover \"a basic range of inpatient services in acute, convalescent, and chronic hospital care.\" The condition for the cost-sharing agreements was that all citizens were to be entitled to these benefits, and by March 1963, 98.8% of Canadians were covered by \"Hospital Insurance\". According to historian Katherine Boothe, however, St. Laurent did not regard government health insurance to be a \"good policy idea\", instead favouring the expansion of voluntary insurance through existing plans. In 1951, for instance, St. Laurent spoke in support of the medical profession assuming \"the administration and responsibility for, a scheme that would provide prepaid medical attendance to any Canadian who needed it\".\nIn addition, St. Laurent modernized and established new social and industrial policies for the country during his time in the prime minister's office. Amongst these measures included the universalization of old-age pensions for all Canadians aged seventy and above (1951), the introduction of old age assistance for needy Canadians aged sixty-five and above (1951), the introduction of allowances for the blind (1951) and the disabled (1954), amendments to unemployment insurance in 1953 (which provided for the payment of unemployment insurance benefit to insured persons incapacitated for work due to injury or illness), \namendments to the National Housing Act (1954) which provided federal government financing to non-profit organisations as well as the provinces for the renovation or construction of hostels or housing for students, the disabled, the elderly, and families on low incomes, and unemployment assistance (1956) for unemployed employables on welfare who had exhausted (or did not qualify for) unemployment insurance benefits. Aid to farmers adversely affected by crop failures was improved, while grants to universities were doubled. \nIn 1954 a government scheme for insuring fishing vessels was established, while the following year a Fisheries Improvement Loan Act was introduced under which government guaranteed loans at 5% were provided to fishermen via the chartered banks. That same year a Women\u2019s Bureau was set up to work on projects aimed at improving the position of female workers. In 1956, equal pay was introduced in the federal civil service. In 1955 a measure was introduced aimed at maintaining gold mine employment in communities depending on this industry. Improvements were also made in benefits for veterans and their dependents. Discrimination was also banned by the 1953 Fair Employment Practices Act and in 1957 unemployment insurance was extended to fishermen. Improvements were also made in superannuation arrangements.\nSt. Laurent's government also used $100\u00a0million in death taxes to establish the Canada Council to support research in the arts, humanities, and social sciences. In 1956, using the taxation authority of the federal level of government, St. Laurent's government introduced the policy of \"equalization payments\" which redistributes taxation revenues between provinces to assist the poorer provinces in delivering government programs and services, a move that has been considered a strong one in solidifying the Canadian federation, particularly with his home province of Qu\u00e9bec.\nIn 1957, St. Laurent's government introduced the registered retirement savings plan (RRSP), a type of financial account used to hold savings and investment assets. The plan had many tax advantages and was designed to promote savings for retirement by employees and self-employed people.\nImmigration.\nIn 1948, St. Laurent's government dramatically increased immigration in order to expand Canada's labour base. St. Laurent believed that immigration was key to post-war economic growth. He also believed that immigration would create a sufficient tax base that would pay for social welfare measures that were established at the end of World War II. Over 125,000 immigrants arrived in Canada in 1948 alone, and that number would more than double to 282,000 in 1957. Large numbers of immigrants were from Southern Europe, including Italians, Greeks, and Portuguese immigrants. Their arrival shifted the balance of ethnic origins amongst Canadians, increasing the population who were of neither French nor British descent.\nIn 1956 and 1957, Canada received over 37,500 refugees from Hungary, in the wake of the 1956 Hungarian Revolution.\nInfrastructure.\nSt. Laurent's government engaged in massive public works and infrastructure projects such as building the Trans-Canada Highway (1949), the St. Lawrence Seaway (1954) and the Trans-Canada Pipeline. It was this last project that was to sow the seeds that led to the downfall of the St. Laurent government.\nSt. Laurent had to go through a series of negotiations with the United States in order to start the construction of the St. Lawrence Seaway. In order to negotiate with the U.S., St. Laurent met with president Harry S. Truman twice, in 1949 and 1951, but was unsuccessful both times. St. Laurent then threatened that Canada would build the seaway alone. Finally, in 1953 and 1954, Truman's successor, president Dwight Eisenhower, secured a deal with St. Laurent. The deal cost $470 million Canadian dollars, with Canada paying nearly three-fourths of that total and the U.S. paying about one-fourth. The seaway was completed in 1959 and expanded Canada's economic trade routes with the United States.\nOther domestic affairs.\nIn 1949, the former lawyer of many Supreme Court cases, St. Laurent ended the practice of appealing Canadian legal cases to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council of Great Britain, making the Supreme Court of Canada the highest avenue of legal appeal available to Canadians. In that same year, St. Laurent negotiated the British North America (No. 2) Act, 1949 with Britain which 'partially patriated' the Canadian Constitution, most significantly giving the Canadian Parliament the authority to amend portions of the constitution.\nIn 1949, following two referendums within the province, St. Laurent and Premier Joey Smallwood negotiated the entry of Newfoundland and Labrador into Confederation.\nWhen asked in 1949 whether he would outlaw the Communist Party in Canada, St. Laurent responded that the party posed little threat and that such measures would be drastic.\nIn 1952, St. Laurent advised Queen Elizabeth II to appoint Vincent Massey as the first Canadian-born Governor-General. Each of the aforementioned actions were and are seen as significant in furthering the cause of Canadian autonomy from Britain and developing a national identity on the international stage.\nIn 1953, St. Laurent undertook the High Arctic relocation, where 92 Inuit were moved from Inukjuak, Quebec to two communities in the Northwest Territories (now Nunavut). The relocation was a forced migration instigated by the federal government to assert its sovereignty in the Far North by the use of \"human flagpoles\", in light of both the Cold War and the disputed territorial claims to the Canadian Arctic Archipelago. The relocated Inuit were not given sufficient support to prevent extreme privation during their first years after the move. The story was the subject of a book called \"The Long Exile\", published by Melanie McGrath in 2006.\nDefeat in the 1957 federal election.\nPipeline Debate.\nThe 1956 Pipeline Debate led to the widespread impression that the Liberals had grown arrogant in power. On numerous occasions, the government invoked closure in order to curtail debate and ensure that its Pipeline Bill passed by a specific deadline. St. Laurent was criticized for a lack of restraint exercised on his minister, C.\u00a0D. Howe (who was also known as the \"Minister of Everything\"). Howe was widely perceived as extremely arrogant. Western Canadians felt particularly alienated by the government, believing that the Liberals were kowtowing to interests in Ontario and Quebec and the United States. The opposition accused the government of accepting overly costly contracts that could never be completed on schedule. In the end, the pipeline was completed early and under budget. The pipeline conflict turned out to be meaningless, insofar as the construction work was concerned, since pipe could not be obtained in 1956 from a striking American factory, and no work could have been done that year. The uproar in Parliament regarding the pipeline had a lasting impression on the electorate, and was a decisive factor in the Liberal government's 1957 defeat at the hands of the Progressive Conservative (PC) Party, led by John Diefenbaker, in the 1957 election.\nResults.\nBy 1957 St. Laurent was 75 years old and tired. His party had been in power for 22 years, and by this time had accumulated too many factions and alienated too many groups. He was ready to retire, but was persuaded to fight one last campaign. In the 1957 election, the Liberals won 200,000 more votes nationwide than the Progressive Conservatives (40.75% Liberals to 38.81% PC). However, a large portion of that overall Liberal popular vote came from huge majorities in Quebec ridings, and did not translate into seats in other parts of the country. Largely due to dominating the rest of the country, the Progressive Conservatives took the greatest number of seats with 112 seats (42% of the House) to the Liberals' 105 (39.2%). The result of the election came as a shock to many, and is considered to be one of the greatest upsets in Canadian federal political history.\nSome ministers wanted St. Laurent to stay on and offer to form a minority government, arguing that the popular vote had supported them and the party's long years of experience would make them a more effective minority. Another option circulated within the party saw the balance of power to be held by either the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation (CCF) and their 25 seats or Social Credit Party of Canada with their 15 seats. St. Laurent was encouraged by others to reach out to the CCF and at least four of six independent/small party MPs to form a coalition majority government, which would have held 134 of the 265 seats in Parliament\u201450.6% of the total. St. Laurent, however, had no desire to stay in office; he believed that the nation had passed a verdict against his government and his party. In any case, the CCF and Socreds had pledged to cooperate with a Tory government. It was very likely that St. Laurent would have been defeated on the floor of the House had he tried to stay in power with a minority government, and would not have stayed in office for long even if he survived that confidence vote. With this in mind, St. Laurent resigned on 21 June 1957\u2014ending the longest uninterrupted run in government for a party at the federal level in Canadian history.\nSupreme Court appointments.\nSt. Laurent chose the following jurists to be appointed as justices of the Supreme Court of Canada by the Governor General:\nRetirement and death (1957\u20131973).\nAfter a short period as leader of the Opposition and now more than 75 years old, St. Laurent's motivation to be involved in politics was gone. He announced his intention to retire from politics. He was succeeded as Liberal Party leader by his former secretary of state for external affairs and representative at the United Nations, Lester B. Pearson, at the party's leadership convention in January 1958.\nSt. Laurent preferred law over politics. In a 1961 interview with the CBC, he stated, \"One can be more outspoken, frank and sincere before the courts than he could be before the public audience in a political campaign.\" In that same interview, St. Laurent acknowledged that the Pipeline Debate played a major role in his 1957 loss, stating, \"Perhaps I didn't say as much as I should have; people do make mistakes you know. I did my best and, as a matter of fact, we had become accustomed to carry on as a board of directors and that displeased a part of the Canadian public.\" St. Laurent admitted that it took a while to resume his good mood after a sudden electoral loss.\nAfter his political retirement, he returned to practising law and living quietly and privately with his family. During his retirement, he was called into the public spotlight one final time in 1967 to be made a Companion of the Order of Canada, a newly created award.\nSt. Laurent was appointed a Companion of the Order of Canada on July 6, 1967. His citation reads:\nFormer Prime Minister of Canada. For his service to his country.\nLouis Stephen St. Laurent died from heart failure on July 25, 1973, in Quebec City, Quebec, aged 91 and was buried at Saint Thomas d'Aquin Cemetery in his hometown of Compton, Quebec.\nLegacy and memorials.\nSt. Laurent presided over the beginning of a new period in Canadian history, post-WW2 Canada. Many have referred to this period as \"Canada's Golden Age\". St. Laurent's government was modestly progressive, fiscally responsible, and run with business-like efficiency. St. Laurent's former senior servant, Robert Gordon Robertson, wrote, \"St Laurent's administrations from 1949 to 1956 probably gave Canada the most consistently good, financially responsible, trouble-free government the country has had in its entire history.\" One of St. Laurent's cabinet ministers, Jack Pickersgill, noted of him, \"St. Laurent had made governing Canada look so easy that the people thought anyone could do it\u2014and thus they elected John Diefenbaker.\"\nCanadian author and professor, Robert Bothwell, wrote, \"St. Laurent had many of the best characteristics of a prime minister but few of the best attributes of a politician. In his most productive years in the job, 1948 to 1954, he presided over a cabinet of strong ministers, many of them first-class politicians. His views and theirs generally coincided, though when they did not, it was the prime minister who prevailed. His fundamental commitment was to national unity, which he interpreted broadly in terms of an expansive federal power. At home and abroad he was an activist, which an abundant economy allowed him to be.\"\nSt. Laurent was ranked #4 on a survey of the first 20 prime ministers (through Jean Chr\u00e9tien) of Canada done by Canadian historians, and used by J. L. Granatstein and Norman Hillmer in their book \"Prime Ministers: Ranking Canada's Leaders\".\nThe house and grounds in Compton where St. Laurent was born were designated a National Historic Site of Canada in 1973. St. Laurent's residence at 201 Grande-All\u00e9e Est in Quebec City is protected as a Recognized Federal Heritage Building.\nCCGS Louis S. St-Laurent, a Canadian Coast Guard Heavy Arctic Icebreaker, is named after him.\nLouis St. Laurent School in Edmonton, Alberta. is named in his honour, as well as the Louis St-Laurent high school in East Angus, Quebec.\nThe riding, Louis-Saint-Laurent, is named in his honour.
