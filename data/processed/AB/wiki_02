Since its beginning, Italian cinema has influenced film movements worldwide. Italy is one of the birthplaces of art cinema and the stylistic aspect of film has been one of the most important factors in the history of Italian film. As of 2018, Italian films have won 14 Academy Awards for Best Foreign Language Film (the most of any country) as well as 12 Palmes d'Or (the second-most of any country), one Academy Award for Best Picture and many Golden Lions and Golden Bears.\nThe history of Italian cinema began a few months after the Lumi\u00e8re brothers began motion picture exhibitions. The first Italian director is considered to be Vittorio Calcina, a collaborator of the Lumi\u00e8re Brothers later active from 1896 to 1905. The first films date back to 1896 and were made in the main cities of the Italian peninsula. These brief experiments immediately met the curiosity of the popular class, encouraging operators to produce new films until they laid the foundations for the birth of a true film industry. In the early 1900s, artistic and epic films such as \"Otello\" (1906), \"The Last Days of Pompeii\" (1908), \"L'Inferno\" (1911), \"Quo Vadis\" (1913), and \"Cabiria\" (1914), were made as adaptations of books or stage plays. Italian filmmakers were using complex set designs, lavish costumes, and record budgets, to produce pioneering films. In the early years of the 20th century, silent cinema developed, bringing numerous Italian stars to the forefront until the end of World War I.\nThe oldest European avant-garde cinema movement, Italian futurism, took place in the late 1910s. After a period of decline in the 1920s, the Italian film industry was revitalized in the 1930s with the arrival of sound film. A popular Italian genre during this period, the Telefoni Bianchi, consisted of comedies with glamorous backgrounds. Calligrafismo was instead in sharp contrast to Telefoni Bianchi-American style comedies and is rather artistic, highly formalistic, expressive in complexity and deals mainly with contemporary literary material. While Italy's Fascist government provided financial support for the nation's film industry, notably the construction of the Cinecitt\u00e0 studios (the largest film studio in Europe), it also engaged in censorship, and thus many Italian films produced in the late 1930s were propaganda films. A new era took place at the end of World War II with the birth of the influential Italian neorealist movement, reaching a vast consensus of audiences and critics throughout the post-war period, and which launched the directorial careers of Luchino Visconti, Roberto Rossellini, and Vittorio De Sica. Neorealism declined in the late 1950s in favour of lighter films, such as those of the Commedia all'italiana genre and important directors like Federico Fellini and Michelangelo Antonioni. Actresses such as Sophia Loren, Giulietta Masina and Gina Lollobrigida achieved international stardom during this period.\nFrom the mid-1950s to the end of the 1970s, Commedia all'italiana and many other genres arose due to auteur cinema, and Italian cinema reached a position of great prestige both nationally and abroad. The Spaghetti Western achieved popularity in the mid-1960s, peaking with Sergio Leone's Dollars Trilogy, which featured enigmatic scores by composer Ennio Morricone, which have become popular culture icons of the Western genre. Erotic Italian thrillers, or giallo, produced by directors such as Mario Bava and Dario Argento in the 1970s, influenced the horror genre worldwide. Since the 1980s, due to multiple factors, Italian production has gone through a crisis that has not prevented the production of quality films in the 1990s and into the new millennium, thanks to a revival of Italian cinema, awarded and appreciated all over the world. During the 1980s and 1990s, directors such as Ermanno Olmi, Bernardo Bertolucci, Giuseppe Tornatore, Gabriele Salvatores and Roberto Benigni brought critical acclaim back to Italian cinema, while the most popular directors of the 2000s and 2010s were Matteo Garrone, Paolo Sorrentino, Marco Bellocchio, Nanni Moretti and Marco Tullio Giordana.\nThe country is also famed for its prestigious Venice Film Festival, the oldest film festival in the world, held annually since 1932 and awarding the Golden Lion; In 2008 the Venice Days (\"Giornate degli Autori\"), a section held in parallel to the Venice Film Festival, has produced in collaboration with Cinecitt\u00e0 studios and the Ministry of Cultural Heritage a list of a 100 films that have changed the collective memory of the country between 1942 and 1978: the \"100 Italian films to be saved\".\nThe David di Donatello Awards are one of the most prestigious awards at national level. Presented by the Accademia del Cinema Italiano in the Cinecitt\u00e0 studios, during the awards ceremony, the winners are given a miniature reproduction of the famous statue. The finalist candidates for the award, as per tradition, are first received at the Quirinal Palace by the President of Italy. The event is the Italian equivalent of the American Academy Awards.\nHistory.\n1890s.\nThe history of Italian cinema began a few months after the French Lumi\u00e8re brothers, who made the first public screening of a film on 28 December 1895, an event considered the birth of cinema, began motion picture exhibitions. The first Italian director is considered to be Vittorio Calcina, a collaborator of the Lumi\u00e8re Brothers, who became the official photographer of the House of Savoy, the Italian ruling dynasty from 1861 to 1946. In this role he filmed in 1896 the first Italian film, \"Sua Maest\u00e0 il Re Umberto e Sua Maest\u00e0 la Regina Margherita a passeggio per il parco a Monza\" (\"His Majesty the King Umberto and Her Majesty the Queen Margherita strolling through the Monza Park\"), believed to have been lost until it was rediscovered by the Cineteca Nazionale in 1979.\nThe Lumi\u00e8re brothers commenced public screenings in Italy in 1896 starting in March, in Rome and Milan; in April in Naples, Salerno and Bari; in June in Livorno; in August in Bergamo, Bologna and Ravenna; in October in Ancona; and in December in Turin, Pescara and Reggio Calabria. Not long before, in 1895, Filoteo Alberini patented his \"kinetograph\", a shooting and projecting device not unlike that of the Lumi\u00e8res brothers.\nItalian Lumi\u00e8re trainees produced short films documenting everyday life and comic strips in the late 1890s and early 1900s. Before long, other pioneers made their way. Italo Pacchioni, Arturo Ambrosio, Giovanni Vitrotti and Roberto Omegna were also active. The success of the short films was immediate. The cinema fascinated with its ability to show distant geographic realities with unprecedented precision and, vice versa, to immortalize everyday moments. Sporting events, local events, intense road traffic, the arrival of a train, visits by famous people, but also natural disasters and calamities are filmed.\nTitles of the time include, \"Arrivo del treno alla Stazione di Milano\" (\"Arrival of the train at Milan station\") (1896), \"La battaglia di neve\" (\"The snow battle\") (1896), \"La gabbia dei matti\" (\"The madmen's cage\") (1896), \"Ballo in famiglia\" (\"Family dance\") (1896), \"Il finto storpio al Castello Sforzesco\" (\"The fake cripple at the Castello Sforzesco\") (1896) and \"La Fiera di Porta Genova\" (\"The fair of Porta Genova\") (1898), all shot by Italo Pacchioni, who was also the inventor of a camera and projector, inspired by the cinematograph of Lumi\u00e8re brothers, kept at the Cineteca Italiana in Milan.\nIf the interest of the masses were enthusiastic, the technological novelty would likely be snubbed, at least at the beginning, by intellectuals and the press. Despite initial doubt, in just two years, cinema climbs the hierarchy of society, intriguing the wealthier classes. On 28 January 1897, prince Victor Emmanuel and princess Elena of Montenegro attended a screening organized by Vittorio Calcina, in a room of the Pitti Palace in Florence. Interested in experimenting with the new medium, they were filmed in \"S.A.R. il Principe di Napoli e la Principessa Elena visitano il battistero di S. Giovanni a Firenze \" (\"Their real heights the Prince of Naples and Princess Elena visit the baptistery of Saint John in Florence\") and on the day of their wedding in \"Dimostrazione popolare alle LL. AA. i Principi sposi (al Pantheon \u2013 Roma)\" (\"Popular demonstration at their heights the princes spouses (at the Pantheon \u2013 Rome)\").\n1900s.\nIn the early years of the 20th century, the phenomenon of itinerant cinemas developed throughout Italy, providing literacy of the visual medium. This innovative form of spectacle ran out, in a short time, a number of optical attractions such as magic lanterns, cinematographers, stereoscopes, panoramas and dioramas that had fueled the European imagination and favoured the circulation of a common market for images. The nascent Italian cinema, therefore, is still linked to the traditional shows of the \"commedia dell'arte\" or to those typical of circus folklore. Public screenings take place in the streets, in cafes or in variety theatres in the presence of a swindler who has the task of promoting and enriching the story.\nBetween 1903 and 1909 the itinerant cinema Italian film was quieting, until then considered as a freak phenomenon, took on consistency assuming the characteristics of an authentic industry, led by four major organizations: Titanus (originally \"Monopolio Lombardo\"), the first italian film production company and the largest and probably the most famous film house in Italy founded by Gustavo Lombardo at Naples in 1904, Cines, based in Rome; and the Turin-based companies Ambrosio Film and Itala Film. Other companies soon followed in Milan, and these early companies quickly attained a respectable production quality and were able to market their products both within Italy and abroad. Early Italian films typically consisted of adaptations of books or stage plays, such as Mario Caserini's \"Otello\" (1906) and Arturo Ambrosio's 1908 \"The Last Days of Pompeii\", an adaptation of the homonymous novel by Edward Bulwer-Lytton. Also popular during this period were films about historical figures, such as Caserini's \"Beatrice Cenci\" (1909) and Ugo Falena's \"Lucrezia Borgia\" (1910).\nIn 1905, Cines inaugurated the genre of the historical film, which in this decade gave a great fortune to many Italian filmmakers. One of the first of these films was \"La presa di Roma\" (1905), lasting 10 minutes, and made by Filoteo Alberini. The operator employs for the first time actors of theatrical origin, exploiting the historical argument in a popular and pedagogical key. The film, assimilating Manzoni's lesson of making historical fiction plausible, reconstructs the Capture of Rome on 20 September 1870.\nThe discovery of the spectacular potential of the cinematographic medium favoured the development of a cinema with great ambitions, capable of incorporating all the cultural and historical suggestions of the country. Education is an inexhaustible source of ideas, ideas that are easily assimilated not only by a cultured public but also by the masses. Dozens of characters from texts make their appearance on the big screen such as the Count of Monte Cristo, Giordano Bruno, Judith beheading Holofernes, Francesca da Rimini, Lorenzino de' Medici, Rigoletto, Count Ugolino and others. From an iconographic point of view, the main references are the great Renaissance and neoclassical artists, as well as symbolists and popular illustrations.\n1910s.\nIn the 1910s, the Italian film industry developed rapidly. In 1912, the year of the greatest expansion, 569 films were produced in Turin, 420 in Rome and 120 in Milan. Popular early Italian actors included Emilio Ghione, Alberto Collo, Bartolomeo Pagano, Amleto Novelli, Lyda Borelli, Ida Carloni Talli, Lidia Quaranta and Maria Jacobini.\n\"Lost in the Dark\", silent drama film directed by Nino Martoglio and produced in 1914, documented life in the slums of Naples, and is considered a precursor to the Italian neorealism movement of the 1940s and 1950s. The only surviving copy of this film was destroyed by Nazi German forces during the World War II. This film is based on a 1901 play of the same title by Roberto Bracco.\nIn the three years leading up to World War I, as production consolidates, mythological, comedy and drama films are exported all over the world. In the meantime, in the actor's field, the phenomenon of stardom was born which for a few years will experience unstoppable success. With the end of the decade, Rome definitively established itself as the main production center; this will remain, despite the crises that will periodically shake the industry, right up to the present day.\nHistorical blockbusters (1910s).\nThe archetypes of this film genre were \"The Last Days of Pompeii\" (1908), by Arturo Ambrosio and Luigi Maggi and \"Nero\" (1909), by Maggi himself and Arrigo Frusta. This last film was inspired by the work of Pietro Cossa who is iconographically based on the etchings of Bartolomeo Pinelli, neoclassicism and the show \"Nero, or the Destruction of Rome\" represented by the Barnum circus. Followed by \"Marin Faliero, Doge of Venice\" (1909), by Giuseppe De Liguoro, \"Otello\" (1909) by Yambo and \"L'Odissea\" (1911), by Bertolini, Padovan and De Liguoro.\n\"L'Inferno\", produced by Milano Films in 1911, even before being an adaptation of Dante's canticle, was a cinematic translation of Gustave Dor\u00e9's engravings that experiments with the integration of optical effects and stage action, and it was the first Italian feature film ever made. \"The Last Days of Pompeii\" (1913), by Eleuterio Rodolfi, used innovative special effects.\nEnrico Guazzoni's 1913 film \"Quo Vadis\" was one of the first blockbusters in the history of cinema, using thousands of extras and a lavish set design. The international success of the film marked the maturation of the genre and allows Guazzoni to make increasingly spectacular films such as \"Antony and Cleopatra\" (1913) and \"Julius Caesar\" (1914). Giovanni Pastrone's 1914 film \"Cabiria\" was an even larger production, requiring two years and a record budget to produce, it was the first epic film ever made and it is considered the most famous Italian silent film. It was also the first film in history to be shown in the White House. After Guazzoni came Emilio Ghione, Febo Mari, Carmine Gallone, Giulio Antamoro and many others who contributed to the expansion of the genre.\nAfter the great success of \"Cabiria\", with the changing tastes of the public and the first signs of the industrial crisis, the genre began to show signs of crisis. Pastrone's plan to adapt the \"Bible\" with thousands of extras remained unfulfilled. Antamoro's \"Christus\" (1916) and Guazzoni's \"The Crusaders\" (1918) remained notable for their iconographic complexity but offered no substantial novelties. Despite sporadic attempts to reconnect with the \"grandeur\" of the past, the trend of historical blockbusters was interrupted at the beginning of the 1920s.\nProto-giallo (1910s).\nIn the first and second decade of the 20th century came a prolific film production aimed at investigative and mystery content, supported by well-assorted Italian and foreign literature that favours its transposition into film. What would later take on the synthesis of the \"giallo\", in fact, was produced and distributed at the dawn of Italian cinema. The most prolific production houses in the 1910s were Cines, Ambrosio Film, Itala Film, Aquila Films, Milano Films and many others, while titles such as \"Il delitto del magistrato\" (1907), \"Il cadavere misterioso\" (1908), \"Il piccolo Sherlock Holmes\" (1909), \"L'abisso\" (1910) and \"Alibi atroce\" (1910), breached the imagination of the first cinema users who demanded a greater offer. The popular consensus is remarkable to the point of encouraging the film industry to invest further production resources since these films are also distributed on the French and Anglo-Saxon markets. Thus directors among the most prolific in this field such as Oreste Mentasti, Luigi Maggi, Arrigo Frusta and Ubaldo Maria Del Colle, together with many others less known, direct several dozen films where classic narrative elements of the silent proto-giallo (mystery, crime, investigation investigative and final twist) constitute the structural aspects of cinematic representation.\nElvira Notari, the first female director ever in Italy and one of the premieres in the history of world cinema, directed \"Carmela, la sartina di Montesanto\" (1916). While in Palermo, Lucarelli Film produced \"La cassaforte n. 8\" (1914) and \"Ipnotismo\" (1914), the Azzurri Film \"La regina della notte\" (1915), the Lumen Film \"Il romanzo fantastico del Dr. Mercanton o il giustiziere invisibile\" (1915) and \"Profumo mortale\" (1915), all films ascribable to the proto-giallo that multiplied in the following decades, becoming preparatory to the subsequent birth of the \"giallo\".\nStardom (1910s).\nBetween 1913 and 1920 there was the rise, development and decline of the phenomenon of cinematographic stardom, born with the release of \"Ma l'amor mio non muore\" (1913), by Mario Caserini. The film had great success with the public and encoded the setting and aesthetics of female stardom. Within just a few years, Eleonora Duse, Pina Menichelli, Rina De Liguoro, Leda Gys, Hesperia, Vittoria Lepanto, Mary Cleo Tarlarini and Italia Almirante Manzini established themselves.\nFilms such as \"Fior di male\" (1914), by Carmine Gallone, \"Il fuoco\" (1915), by Giovanni Pastrone, \"Rapsodia satanica\" (1917), by Nino Oxilia and \"Cenere\" (1917), by Febo Mari, changed the national costume, imposing canons of beauty, role models and objects of desire. These models, strongly stylized according to the cultural and artistic trends of the time, moved away from naturalism in favor of melodramatic acting, pictorial gesture and theatrical pose; all favored by the incessant use of close-up which focuses the attention on the expressiveness of the actress.\nComic short films (1910s).\nThe most successful comedian in Italy was Andr\u00e9 Deed, better known in Italy as \"Cretinetti\", star of comic short film for Itala Film. Its success paved the way for Marcel Fabre (\"Robinet\"), Ernesto Vaser (\"Fricot\") and many others. The only actor of a certain substance, however, was Ferdinand Guillaume, who became famous with the stage name of \"Polidor\".\nThe historical interest of these films lay in their ability to reveal the aspirations and fears of a petty-bourgeois society torn between the desire for affirmation and the uncertainties of the present. It was significant that the protagonists of Italian comedians never place themselves in open contrast with society or embody the desire for social revenge (as happens for example with Charlie Chaplin), but rather tried to integrate into a strongly desired world.\nFuturist cinema (1910s).\nItalian futurist cinema was the oldest movement of European avant-garde cinema. Italian futurism, an artistic and social movement, impacted the Italian film industry from 1916 to 1919. It influenced Russian Futurist cinema and German Expressionist cinema. Its cultural importance was considerable and influenced all subsequent avant-gardes, as well as some authors of narrative cinema; its echo expands to the dreamlike visions of some films by Alfred Hitchcock.\nFuturism emphasized dynamism, speed, technology, youth, violence, and objects such as the car, the airplane, and the industrial city. Its key figures were the Italians Filippo Tommaso Marinetti, Umberto Boccioni, Carlo Carr\u00e0, Fortunato Depero, Gino Severini, Giacomo Balla, and Luigi Russolo. It glorified modernity and aimed to liberate Italy from the weight of its past.\nThe 1916 Manifesto of Futuristic Cinematography was signed by Filippo Tommaso Marinetti, Armando Ginna, Bruno Corra, Giacomo Balla and others. To the Futurists, cinema was an ideal art form, being a fresh medium, and able to be manipulated by speed, special effects and editing. Most of the futuristic-themed films of this period have been lost, but critics cite \"Tha\u00efs\" (1917) by Anton Giulio Bragaglia as one of the most influential, serving as the main inspiration for German Expressionist cinema in the following decade.\nThe Italian film industry struggled against rising foreign competition in the years following World War I. Several major studios, among them Cines and Ambrosio, formed the Unione Cinematografica Italiana to coordinate a national strategy for film production. This effort was largely unsuccessful, however, due to a wide disconnect between production and exhibition (some movies weren't released until several years after they were produced).\n1920s.\nWith the end of World War I, Italian cinema went through a period of crisis due to many factors such as production disorganization, increased costs, technological backwardness, loss of foreign markets and inability to cope with international competition, in particular with that of Hollywood. The main causes included the lack of a generational change with a production still dominated by filmmakers and producers of literary training, unable to face the challenges of modernity. The first half of the 1920s marked a sharp decrease in production; from 350 films produced in 1921 to 60 in 1924.\nLiterature and theatre are still the preferred narrative sources. The feuilletons resist, mostly taken from classical or popular texts and directed by specialists such as Roberto Roberti and the religious blockbusters of Giulio Antamoro. On the basis of the latest generation of divas, a sentimental cinema for women spread, centred on figures on the margins of society who, instead of struggling to emancipate themselves (as happens in contemporary Hollywood cinema), go through an authentic ordeal in order to preserve their own virtue. Protest and rebellion by the female protagonists are out of the question. It is a strongly conservative cinema, tied to social rules upset by the war and in the process of dissolution throughout Europe. An exemplary case is that of \"A Woman's Story\" (1920) by Eugenio Perego, which uses an original narrative construction to propose a 19th-century morality with melodramatic tones.\nA particular genre is that of a realist setting, due to the work of the first female director of Italian cinema, Elvira Notari, who directs numerous films influenced by popular theatre and taken from famous dramas, Neapolitan songs, appendix novels or inspired by facts of chronicle. Another film with a realist setting is \"Lost in the Dark\" (1914) by director Nino Martoglio, considered by critics as a prime example of neorealist cinema.\nThe revival of Italian cinema took place at the end of the decade with the production of larger-scale films. During this period, a group of intellectuals close to the fortnightly \"cinematografo\" led by Alessandro Blasetti launched a program that was as simple as it was ambitious. Aware of the Italian cultural backwardness, they decided to break all ties with the previous tradition through a rediscovery of the peasant world, hitherto practically absent in Italian cinema. \"Sun\" (1929) by Alessandro Blasetti shows the evident influence of the Soviet and German avant-gardes in an attempt to renew Italian cinema in accordance with the interests of the fascist regime. \"Rails\" (1929) by Mario Camerini blends the traditional genre of comedy with kammerspiel and realist film, revealing the director's ability to outline the characters of the middle class. While not comparable to the best results of international cinema of the period, the works of Camerini and Blasetti testify to a generational transition between Italian directors and intellectuals, and above all an emancipation from literary models and an approach to the tastes of the public.\n1930s.\nThe sound cinema arrived in Italy in 1930, three years after the release of \"The Jazz Singer\" (1927), and immediately led to a debate on the validity of spoken cinema and its relationship with the theatre. Some directors enthusiastically face the new challenge. The advent of talkies led to stricter censorship by the Fascist government.\nThe first Italian talking picture was \"The Song of Love\" (1930) by Gennaro Righelli, which was a great success with the public. Alessandro Blasetti also experimented with the use of an optical track for sound in the film \"Resurrection\" (1931), shot before \"The Song of Love\" but released a few months later. Similar to Righelli's film is \"What Scoundrels Men Are!\" (1932) by Mario Camerini, which has the merit of making Vittorio De Sica debut on the screens. Historical films such as Blasetti's \"1860\" (1934) and Carmine Gallone's \"\" (1937) were also popular during this period.\nWith the transition to sound cinema, most of the Italian silent film actors, still linked to theatrical stylization, find themselves disqualified. The era of divas, dandies and strongmen, who barely survived the 1920s, is definitely over. Even if some performers will move on to directing or producing, the arrival of sound favours the generational change and the consequent modernization of the structures.\nItalian-born director Frank Capra received three Academy Awards for Best Director for the films \"It Happened One Night\" (1934, the first Big Five winner at the Academy Awards), \"Mr. Deeds Goes to Town\" (1936) and \"You Can't Take It with You\" (1938).\nIn 1932, the Venice Film Festival, the world's oldest film festival and one of the \"Big Three\" film festivals, alongside the Cannes Film Festival and the Berlin International Film Festival, was established.\nCinecitt\u00e0 (1930s\u2013present).\nIn 1934, the Italian government created the General Directorate for Cinema (\"Direzione Generale per le Cinematografia\"), and appointed Luigi Freddi its director. With the approval of Benito Mussolini, this directorate called for the establishment of a town southeast of Rome devoted exclusively to cinema, dubbed the Cinecitt\u00e0 (\"Cinema City\"), under the slogan \"Il cinema \u00e8 l'arma pi\u00f9 forte\" (\"Cinema is the most powerful weapon\"). The studios were constructed during the Fascist era as part of a plan to revive the Italian film industry, which had reached its low point in 1931.\nMussolini himself inaugurated the studios on 21 April 1937. Post-production units and sets were constructed and heavily used initially. Early films such as \"\" (1937) and \"The Iron Crown\" (1941) showcased the technological advancement of the studios. Seven thousand people were involved in the filming of the battle scene from \"Scipio Africanus\", and live elephants were brought in as a part of the re-enactment of the Battle of Zama.\nThe Cinecitt\u00e0 provided everything necessary for filmmaking: theatres, technical services, and even a cinematography school, the Centro Sperimentale di Cinematografia, for younger apprentices. The Cinecitt\u00e0 studios were Europe's most advanced production facilities and greatly boosted the technical quality of Italian films. Many films are still shot entirely in Cinecitt\u00e0. Benito Mussolini founded Cinecitt\u00e0 studio also for the production of Fascist propaganda until World War II.\nDuring this period, Mussolini's son, Vittorio, created a national production company and organized the work of noted authors, directors and actors (including even some political opponents), thereby creating an interesting communication network among them, which produced several noted friendships and stimulated cultural interaction.\nWith an area of 400,000 square metres (99 acres), it is still the largest film studio in Europe, and is considered the hub of Italian cinema. Filmmakers such as Federico Fellini, Roberto Rossellini, Luchino Visconti, Sergio Leone, Bernardo Bertolucci, Francis Ford Coppola, Martin Scorsese, and Mel Gibson have worked at Cinecitt\u00e0. More than 3,000 movies have been filmed there, of which 90 received an Academy Award nomination and 47 of these won it.\nTelefoni Bianchi (1930s\u20131940s).\nDuring the 1930s, light comedies known as Telefoni Bianchi (\"white telephones\") were predominant in Italian cinema. These films, which featured lavish set designs, promoted conservative values and respect for authority, and thus typically avoided the scrutiny of government censors. Telefoni Bianchi proved to be the testing ground of numerous screenwriters destined to impose themselves in the following decades (including Cesare Zavattini and Sergio Amidei), and above all of numerous set designers such as Guido Fiorini, Gino Carlo Sensani and Antonio Valente, who, by virtue, successful graphic inventions led these productions to become a kind of \"summa\" of the petty-bourgeois aesthetics of the time.\nThe first film of the genre Telefoni Bianchi was \"The Private Secretary\" (1931), by Goffredo Alessandrini. Among the authors, Mario Camerini is the most representative director of the genre. After having practiced the most diverse trends in the 1930s, he happily moved into the territory of sentimental comedy with \"What Scoundrels Men Are!\" (1932), \"Il signor Max\" (1937) and \"Department Store\" (1939). In other films, he compares himself with the Hollywood-style comedy on the model of Frank Capra (\"Heartbeat\", 1939) and the surreal one of Ren\u00e9 Clair (\"I'll Give a Million\", 1936). Camerini is interested in the figure of the typical and popular Italian, so much so that he anticipates some elements of the future Italian comedy. His major interpreter, Vittorio De Sica, will continue his lesson in \"Maddalena, Zero for Conduct\" (1940) and \"Teresa Venerd\u00ec\" (1941), emphasizing above all the direction of the actors and the care for the settings.\nOther directors include Mario Mattoli (\"Schoolgirl Diary\", 1941), Jean de Limur (\"Apparition\", 1944) and Max Neufeld (\"The House of Shame\", 1938; \"A Thousand Lire a Month\", 1939). The realist comedies of Mario Bonnard (\"Before the Postman\", 1942; \"The Peddler and the Lady\", 1943) are partially different in character, which partially deviate from the imprint of Telefoni Bianchi.\nFascist propaganda (1930s\u20131940s).\nIn the fascist propaganda cinema, at the beginning, the representations of the squads and the first fascist actions were rare. \"The Old Guard\" (1934), by Alessandro Blasetti evokes the supposed vitalistic spontaneity of squads with populist tones, but is not appreciated by official critics. \"Black Shirt\" (1933), by Giovacchino Forzano, made for the 10th anniversary of the March on Rome, celebrated the regime's policies (the reclamation of the Pontine marshes and the construction of Littoria) alternating narrative sequences with documentary passages.\nWith political consolidation, the government authority required the film industry to strengthen the regime's identification with the country's history and culture. Hence the intention to reread Italian history in an authoritarian perspective, teleologically reducing every past event to a harbinger of the \"fascist revolution\", in continuity with the historiographical work of Gioacchino Volpe. After the first attempts in this direction, aimed above all at underlining the alleged link between the Risorgimento and Fascism (\"Villafranca\" by Forzano, 1933; \"1860\" by Blasetti, 1933), the trend reached its peak just before the war. \"Cavalry\" (1936), by Goffredo Alessandrini, evokes the nobility of the Savoy fighters by presenting their deeds as anticipations of squads. \"Condottieri\" (1937) by Luis Trenker, tells the story of Giovanni delle Bande Nere, explicitly establishing a parallel with Benito Mussolini, while \"\" (1937) by Carmine Gallone (one of the greatest financial efforts of the time), it celebrates the Roman Empire and indirectly the Fascist Empire.\nThe invasion of Ethiopia gives Italian directors the opportunity to extend the horizons of the settings. \"The Great Appeal\" (1936) by Mario Camerini, exalts imperialism by describing the \"new land\" as an opportunity for work and redemption, contrasting the heroism of young soldiers with bourgeois fearlessness. The anti-pacifist controversy that accompanies colonial enterprises is also evident in \"Lo squadrone bianco\" (1936) by Augusto Genina, which combines propaganda rhetoric with notable battle sequences shot in the Italian Tripolitania desert. Most of the films celebrating the empire are predominantly documentaries, aimed at disguising the war as a struggle of civilization against barbarism. The Spanish Civil War is described in the documentaries \"Los novios de la muerte\" (1936) by Romolo Marcellini and \"Arriba Espa\u00f1a, Espa\u00f1a una, grande, libre!\" (1939) by Giorgio Ferroni, and is the backdrop for another dozen films, among which the most spectacular is \"The Siege of the Alcazar\" (1940) by Augusto Genina.\nFilms such as \"Pietro Micca\" (1938) by Aldo Vergano, \"Ettore Fieramosca\" (1938), made in the same year by Alessandro Blasetti, and \"Fanfulla da Lodi\" (1940) by Giulio Antamoro can also be counted as propaganda films (albeit indirect), in which, a pretext for the epic narration of historical events, a clear apology for dedication to the homeland (in some cases even to the point of personal sacrifice) is made in the same vein as colonial films with a contemporary setting.\nWith Italy's participation in World War II, the fascist regime further strengthens its control over production and requires a more decisive commitment to propaganda. In addition to the now canonical documentaries, short films and newsreels, there is also an increase in feature films in praise of Italian war enterprises. Among the most representative we find \"Bengasi\" (1942) by Genina, \"Gente dell'aria\" (1943) by Esodo Pratelli, \"The Three Pilots\" (1942) by Mario Mattoli (based on a screenplay by Vittorio Mussolini), \"Il treno crociato\" (1943) by Carlo Campogalliani, \"Harlem\" (1943) by Carmine Gallone and \"Men of the Mountain\" (1943) by Aldo Vergano under the supervision of Blasetti. \"Uomini sul fondo\" (1941) by Francesco De Robertis is also notable due to its almost documentary approach.\nThe most successful film of the period is \"We the Living\" (1942) by Goffredo Alessandrini, made as a single film, but then distributed in two parts due to its excessive length. Referable to the genre of anti-communist drama, this sombre melodrama (set in the Soviet Union) is inspired by the novel of the same name by the writer Ayn Rand which exalts the most radical philosophical individualism. Precisely because of this generic criticism of authoritarianism, the diptych could be interpreted as a mild accusation against the fascist regime.\nAmong the directors who give their contribution to the war propaganda, there is also Roberto Rossellini, author of a trilogy composed of \"The White Ship\" (1941), \"A Pilot Returns\" (1942) and \"The Man with a Cross\" (1943). Anticipating in some ways his works of maturity, the director adopted a modest and immediate style, which does not contrast the effectiveness of the propaganda but neither does it exalt the dominant war rhetoric; it was the same anti-spectacular approach to which he remained faithful throughout his life.\n1940s.\nNeorealism (1940s\u20131950s).\nBy the end of World War II, the Italian \"neorealist\" movement had begun to take shape. Neorealist films typically dealt with the working class (in contrast to the \"Telefoni Bianchi\"), and were shot on location. Many neorealist films, but not all, used non-professional actors. Though the term \"neorealism\" was used for the first time to describe Luchino Visconti\u2019s 1943 film, \"Ossessione\", there were several important precursors to the movement, most notably Camerini's \"What Scoundrels Men Are!\" (1932), which was the first Italian film shot entirely on location, and Blasetti's 1942 film, \"Four Steps in the Clouds\".\n\"Ossessione\" angered Fascist officials. Upon viewing the film, Vittorio Mussolini is reported to have shouted, \"This is not Italy!\" before walking out of the theatre. The film was subsequently banned in the Fascist-controlled parts of Italy. While neorealism exploded after the war and was incredibly influential at the international level, neorealist films made up only a small percentage of Italian films produced during this period, as postwar Italian moviegoers preferred escapist comedies starring actors such as Tot\u00f2 and Alberto Sordi.\nNeorealist works such as Roberto Rossellini's trilogy \"Rome, Open City\" (1945), \"Pais\u00e0\" (1946), and \"Germany, Year Zero\" (1948), with professional actors such as Anna Magnani and a number of non-professional actors, attempted to describe the difficult economic and moral conditions of postwar Italy and the changes in public mentality in everyday life. Visconti's \"The Earth Trembles\" (1948) was shot on location in a Sicilian fishing village and used local non-professional actors. Giuseppe De Santis, on other hand, used actors such as Silvana Mangano and Vittorio Gassman in his 1949 film, \"Bitter Rice\", which is set in the Po Valley during rice-harvesting season.\nPoetry and cruelty of life were harmonically combined in the works that Vittorio De Sica wrote and directed together with screenwriter Cesare Zavattini: among them, \"Shoeshine\" (1946), \"The Bicycle Thief\" (1948) and \"Miracle in Milan\" (1951). The 1952 film \"Umberto D.\" showed a poor old man with his little dog, who must beg for alms against his dignity in the loneliness of the new society. This work is perhaps De Sica's masterpiece and one of the most important works in Italian cinema. It was not a commercial success and since then it has been shown on Italian television only a few times. Yet it is perhaps the most violent attack, in the apparent quietness of the action, against the rules of the new economy, the new mentality, the new values, and it embodies both a conservative and a progressive view.\nAlthough \"Umberto D.\" is considered the end of the neorealist period, later films such as Federico Fellini's \"La Strada\" (1954) and De Sica's 1960 film \"Two Women\" (for which Sophia Loren won the Oscar for Best Actress) are grouped with the genre. Director Pier Paolo Pasolini's first film, \"Accattone\" (1961), shows a strong neorealist influence. Italian neorealist cinema influenced filmmakers around the world, and helped inspire other film movements, such as the French New Wave and the Polish Film School. The Neorealist period is often simply referred to as \"The Golden Age\" of Italian cinema by critics, filmmakers, and scholars.\nCalligrafismo (1940s).\nCalligrafismo is in sharp contrast to Telefoni Bianchi-American style comedies and is rather artistic, highly formalistic, expressive in complexity and deals mainly with contemporary literary material, above all the pieces of Italian realism from authors like Corrado Alvaro, Ennio Flaiano, Emilio Cecchi, Francesco Pasinetti, Vitaliano Brancati, Mario Bonfantini and Umberto Barbaro.\nThe best-known exponent of this genre is Mario Soldati, a long-time writer and director destined to establish himself with films of literary ancestry and solid formal structure. His films put at the centre of the story characters endowed with a dramatic and psychological strength foreign to both white-phone cinema and propaganda films, and found in works such as \"Dora Nelson\" (1939), \"Piccolo mondo antico\" (1941), \"Tragic Night\" (1942), \"Malombra\" (1942) and \"In High Places\" (1943). Luigi Chiarini, already active as a critic, deepens the trend in his \"Sleeping Beauty\" (1942), \"Street of the Five Moons\" (1942) and \"The Innkeeper\" (1944). The internal conflicts of the characters and the scenographic richness are also recurrent in the first films by Alberto Lattuada (\"Giacomo the Idealist\", 1943) and Renato Castellani (\"A Pistol Shot\", 1942), dominated by a sense of moral and cultural decay that seems to anticipate the end of the war.\nAnother important example of a calligraphic film is the film version of \"The Betrothed\" (1941), by Mario Camerini (very faithful in the staging of Manzoni's masterpiece), which due to the perceived income, became the most popular feature film between 1941 and 1942.\nAnimation (1940s\u2013present).\nThe pioneer of the Italian cartoon was Francesco Guido, better known as Gibba. Immediately after the end of World War II, he produced the first animated medium-length film of Italian cinema entitled \"L'ultimo sciusci\u00e0\" (1946), which took up themes typical of neorealism and in the following decade the feature films \"Rompicollo and I picchiatelli\", in collaboration with Antonio Attanasi. In the 1970s, after many animated documentaries, Gibba himself will return to the feature film with the erotic \"Il nano e la strega\" (1973) and \"Il racconto della giungla\" (1974). Also interesting are the contributions of the painter and set designer Emanuele Luzzati who, after some valuable short films, made in 1976 one of the masterpieces of Italian animation: \"Il flauto magico\" (\"The Magic Flute\"), based on the homonymous opera by Mozart.\nIn 1949, the designer Nino Pagot presented \"The Dynamite Brothers\" at the Venice Film Festival, one of the first animated feature films of the time, released in theatres in conjunction with \"La Rosa di Bagdad\" (1949), made by the animator Anton Gino Domeneghini. In the early 1950s, the cartoonist Romano Scarpa created the short film \"La piccola fiammiferaia\" (1953), which remains, like the two previous films, little more than an isolated case. Apart from these examples, Italian animation in the 1950s and 1960s failed to become a major reality and remains confined to the television sector, due to the various commissions provided by the Carosello container.\nBut it is with Bruno Bozzetto that the Italian cartoon reaches an international dimension: his debut feature film \"West and Soda\" (1965), an irresistible caricature of the Western genre, received acclaim from both audiences and critics. A few years later his second work entitled \"VIP my Brother Superman\" was released, distributed in 1968. After many satirical short films (centred on the popular figure of \"Signor Rossi\") he returned to the feature film with what is considered his most ambitious work, \"Allegro Non Troppo\" (1977). Inspired by the well-known Disney \"Fantasia\", it is a mixed media film, in which animated episodes are molded to the notes of many classical music pieces. Another illustrator to underline is the artist Pino Zac who in 1971 shot (again with mixed technique) \"The Nonexistent Knight\", based on the novel of the same name by Italo Calvino.\nIn the 1990s, Italian animation entered a new phase of production due to the Turin Lanterna Magica studio which in 1996, under the direction of Enzo D'Al\u00f2, created the intriguing Christmas fairy tale \"How the Toys Saved Christmas\", based on a short story by Gianni Rodari. The film was a success and paved the way for other feature films. In fact, in 1998, \"Lucky and Zorba\" based on a novel by Luis Sep\u00falveda was distributed, which attracted the favour of the public, reaching a new apex in the Italian animated cinema.\nThe director Enzo d'Al\u00f2, who separated from the Lanterna Magica studio, produced other films in the following years such as \"Momo\" (2001) and \"Opopomoz\" (2003). The Turin studio distributed on its behalf the films \"Aida of the Trees\" (2001) and \"Tot\u00f2 Sapore e la magica storia della pizza\" (2003), accompanied by a good response at the box office. In 2003, the first entirely Italian animated film in computer graphics was released entitled \"L'apetta Giulia and Signora Vita\", directed by Paolo Modugno. To underline the work \"La Storia di Leo\" (2007) by director Mario Cambi, winner, the following year, at the Giffoni Film Festival.\nIn 2010, the first Italian animated film in 3D technology was made, directed by Iginio Straffi, entitled ', based on the homonymous series; in the meantime Enzo D'Al\u00f2 returns to theatres, presenting his \"Pinocchio\" (2012). In 2012, the film \"Gladiators of Rome\", also shot in 3D technology, received credit from the public, followed by the feature film ' (2014), both again by Iginio Straffi. Finally, \"The Art of Happiness\" (2013) by Alessandro Rak, a film made in Naples by 40 authors, including only 10 designers and animators from the Mad Entertainment studio, a true absolute record for an animated film was made. \"Cinderella the Cat\" (2017), taken from the text \"Pentamerone\" by Giambattista Basile, came out of the same studio. The work won two David di Donatello's, one of which was for special effects, becoming the first animated film to be nominated, and win, in this category.\n1950s.\nStarting from the mid-1950s, Italian cinema freed itself from neorealism by tackling purely existential topics, films with different styles and points of view, often more introspective than descriptive. Thus we are witnessing a new flowering of filmmakers who contribute in a fundamental way to the development of the art.\nMichelangelo Antonioni is the first to establish himself, becoming a reference author for all contemporary cinema. This charge of novelty is recognizable from the beginning as the director's first work, \"Story of a Love Affair\" (1950), marks an indelible break with the world of neorealism and the consequent birth of a modern cinema. Antonioni investigated the world of the Italian bourgeoisie with a critical eye, left out of the post-war cinematic lens. In doing so, works of psychological research such as \"I Vinti\" (1952), \"The Lady Without Camelias\" (1953) and \"Le Amiche\" (1955), free adaptation of the short story \"Tra donne sole\" by Cesare Pavese, came to light. In 1957, he staged the unusual proletarian drama \"Il Grido\", with which he obtained critical acclaim.\nIn 1955, the David di Donatello was established, with its Best Picture category being awarded for the first time only in 1970. Named after Donatello's \"David\", a symbolic statue of the Italian Renaissance, are film awards given out each year by the \"Accademia del Cinema Italiano\" (The Academy of Italian Cinema).\nFederico Fellini (1950s\u20131990s).\nFederico Fellini is recognized as one of the greatest and most influential filmmakers of all time. Fellini won the Palme d'Or for \"La Dolce Vita\", was nominated for twelve Academy Awards, and won four in the category of Best Foreign Language Film, the most for any director in the history of the academy. He received an honorary award for Lifetime Achievement at the 65th Academy Awards in Los Angeles. His other well-known films include \"La Strada\" (1954), \"Nights of Cabiria\" (1957), \"Juliet of the Spirits\" (1967), \"Satyricon\" (1969), \"Roma\" (1972), \"Amarcord\" (1973), and \"Fellini's Casanova\" (1976).\nPersonal and highly idiosyncratic visions of society, Fellini's films are a unique combination of memory, dreams, fantasy and desire. The adjectives \"Fellinian\" and \"Felliniesque\" are \"synonymous with any kind of extravagant, fanciful, even baroque image in the cinema and in art in general\". \"La Dolce Vita\" contributed the term \"paparazzi\" to the English language, derived from Paparazzo, the photographer friend of journalist Marcello Rubini (Marcello Mastroianni).\nContemporary filmmakers such as Tim Burton, Terry Gilliam, Emir Kusturica, and David Lynch have cited Fellini's influence on their work.\nPink neorealism (1950s\u20131960s).\nAlthough \"Umberto D.\" is considered the end of the neorealist period, subsequent works turned toward lighter, sweetened and mildly optimistic atmospheres, more coherent with the improving conditions of Italy just before the economic boom; this genre became known as \"pink neorealism\".\nThe precursor of pink neorealism was Renato Castellani, who helped bring realist comedy into vogue with \"Under the Sun of Rome\" (1948) and \"It's Forever Springtime\" (1949), both shot on location and with non-professional actors, and above all with public success and criticism of \"Two Cents Worth of Hope\" (1952), which laid the foundations for pink neorealism.\nNotable films of pink neorealism, which combine popular comedy and realist motifs, are \"Pane, amore e fantasia\" (1953) by Luigi Comencini and \"Poveri ma belli\" (1957) by Dino Risi, both works are in perfect harmony with the evolution of the Italian costume. The large influx at the box office from the two films remained almost unchanged in the sequels \"Bread, Love and Jealousy\" (1954), \"Scandal in Sorrento\" (1955) and \"Pretty But Poor\" (1957), also directed by Luigi Comencini and Dino Risi.\nSimilarly, stories of daily life told with gentle irony (without losing sight of the social fabric) can be found in the work of the Milanese Luciano Emmer, whose films \"Sunday in August\" (1950), \"Three Girls from Rome\" (1952) and \"High School\" (1954), are the best-known examples. Another film of the pink neorealism genre was \"Susanna Whipped Cream\" (1957) by Steno.\nThis trend allowed some actresses to become real celebrities, such as Sophia Loren, Gina Lollobrigida, Silvana Pampanini, Lucia Bos\u00e9, Barbara Bouchet, Eleonora Rossi Drago, Silvana Mangano, Virna Lisi, Claudia Cardinale and Stefania Sandrelli. Soon pink neorealism was replaced by the Commedia all'italiana, a unique genre that, born on an ideally humouristic line, talked instead very seriously about important social themes.\nCommedia all'Italiana (1950s\u20131970s).\nCommedia all'italiana (\"Comedy in the Italian way\") is an Italian film genre born in Italy in the 1950s and developed in the following 1960s and 1970s. It is widely considered to have started with Mario Monicelli's \"Big Deal on Madonna Street\" in 1958 and derives its name from the title of Pietro Germi's \"Divorce Italian Style\", 1961. According to most of the critics, \"La Terrazza\" by Ettore Scola (1980) is the last work considered part of the Commedia all'italiana.\nRather than a specific genre, the term indicates a period (approximately from the late 1950s to the early 1970s) in which the Italian film industry was producing many successful comedies, with some common traits like satire of manners, farcical and grotesque overtones, a strong focus on \"spicy\" social issues of the period (like sexual matters, divorce, contraception, marriage of the clergy, the economic rise of the country and its various consequences, the traditional religious influence of the Catholic Church) and a prevailing middle-class setting, often characterized by a substantial background of sadness and social criticism that diluted the comic contents.\nThe genre of Commedia all'italiana differs markedly from the light and disengaged comedy from the so-called \"pink neorealism\" trend, in vogue until all of the 1950s, since, starting from the lesson of neorealism, is based on a more frank adherence in writing to reality; therefore, alongside the comic situations and plots typical of traditional comedy, always combines, with irony, a biting and sometimes bitter satire of manners, which reflects the evolution of Italian society in those years.\nThe success of films belonging to the \"Commedia all'italiana\" genre is due both to the presence of an entire generation of great actors, who knew how to masterfully embody the vices and virtues, and the attempts at emancipation but also the vulgarities of the Italians of the time, both to the careful work of directors, storytellers and screenwriters, who invented a real genre, with essentially new connotations, managing to find precious material for their cinematographic creations in the folds of a rapid evolution with many contradictions.\nAmong the actors the main representatives are Alberto Sordi, Ugo Tognazzi, Vittorio Gassman, Marcello Mastroianni and Nino Manfredi, while among the actresses is Monica Vitti. Among directors and films, in 1961 Dino Risi directed \"Una vita difficile\" (\"A Difficult Life\"), then \"Il Sorpasso\" (\"The Easy Life\"), now a cult-movie, followed by: \"I Mostri\" (\"The Monsters\", also known as \"15 From Rome\"), \"In nome del popolo italiano\" (\"In the Name of the Italian People\") and \"Profumo di donna\" (\"Scent of a Woman\"). Monicelli's works include \"La grande guerra\" (\"The Great War\"), \"I compagni\" (\"The Organizer\"), \"L'armata Brancaleone\", \"Vogliamo i colonnelli\" (\"We Want the Colonels\"), \"Romanzo popolare\" (\"Come Home and Meet My Wife\") and the \"Amici miei\" (\"My Friends\") series.\nFor the majority of critics the true and proper \"Commedia all'italiana\" is to be considered definitively waned since the beginning of the 1980s, giving way, at most, to an \"Commedia italiana\" (\"Italian comedy\").\nTot\u00f2 (1950s\u20131960s).\nAt this time, on the more commercial side of production, the phenomenon of Tot\u00f2, a Neapolitan actor who is acclaimed as the major Italian comic, exploded. His films (often with Aldo Fabrizi, Peppino De Filippo and almost always with Mario Castellani) expressed a sort of neorealistic satire, in the means of a \"guitto\" (a \"hammy\" actor) as well as with the art of the great dramatic actor he also was. Tot\u00f2 is one of the symbols of the cinema of Naples.\nA \"film-machine\" who produced dozens of titles per year, his repertoire was frequently repeated. His personal story (a prince born in the poorest \"rione\" (section of the city) of Naples), his unique twisted face, his special mimic expressions and his gestures created an inimitable personage and made him one of the most beloved Italians of the 1960s.\nSome of his best-known films are \"Fear and Sand\" by Mario Mattoli, \"Toto Tours Italy\" by Mario Mattoli, \"Toto the Sheik\" by Mario Mattoli, \"Cops and Robbers\" by Mario Monicelli, \"Toto and the Women\" by Mario Monicelli, \"Tot\u00f2 Tarzan\" by Mario Mattoli, \"Toto the Third Man\" by Mario Mattoli, \"Toto and the King of Rome\" by Mario Monicelli and Steno, \"Toto in Color\" by Steno (one of the first Italian colour movies, 1952, in Ferrania colour), \"Big Deal on Madonna Street\" by Mario Monicelli, \"Toto, Peppino, and the Hussy\" by Camillo Mastrocinque and \"The Law Is the Law\" by Christian-Jaque. Pier Paolo Pasolini's \"The Hawks and the Sparrows\" and the episode \"Che cosa sono le nuvole\" from \"Caprice Italian Style\" (the latter released after his death), showed his dramatic skills.\nDon Camillo and Peppone (1950s\u20131980s).\nA series of black-and-white films based on Don Camillo and Peppone characters created by the Italian writer and journalist Giovannino Guareschi were made between 1952 and 1965. These were French-Italian coproductions, and starred Fernandel as the Italian priest Don Camillo and Gino Cervi as Giuseppe 'Peppone' Bottazzi, the Communist Mayor of their rural town. The titles are: \"The Little World of Don Camillo\" (1952), \"The Return of Don Camillo\" (1953), \"Don Camillo's Last Round\" (1955), \"\" (1961), and \"Don Camillo in Moscow\" (1965).\nThe movies were a huge commercial success in their native countries. In 1952, \"Little World of Don Camillo\" became the highest-grossing film in both Italy and France, while \"The Return of Don Camillo\" was the second most popular film of 1953 at the Italian and French box office.\nMario Camerini began filming the film \"Don Camillo e i giovani d'oggi\", but had to stop filming due to Fernandel's falling ill, which resulted in his untimely death. The film was then realized in 1972 with Gastone Moschin playing the role of Don Camillo and Lionel Stander as Peppone.\nA new Don Camillo film, titled \"The World of Don Camillo\", was also remade in 1983, an Italian production with Terence Hill directing and also starring as Don Camillo. Colin Blakely performed Peppone in one of his last film roles.\nHollywood on the Tiber (1950s\u20131960s).\nHollywood on the Tiber is a phrase used to describe the period in the 1950s and 1960s when the Italian capital of Rome emerged as a major location for international filmmaking attracting many foreign productions to the Cinecitt\u00e0 studios, the largest film studio in Europe. By contrast to the native Italian film industry, these movies were made in English for global release. Although the primary markets for such films were American and British audiences, they enjoyed widespread popularity in other countries, including Italy.\nIn the late 1940s, Hollywood studios began to shift production abroad to Europe. Italy was, along with Britain, one of the major destinations for American film companies. Large-budget films shot at Cinecitt\u00e0 during the \"Hollywood on the Tiber\" era such as \"Quo Vadis\" (1951), \"Roman Holiday\" (1953), \"Ben-Hur\" (1959), and \"Cleopatra\" (1963) were made in English with international casts and sometimes, but not always, Italian settings or themes.\nThe heyday of what was dubbed '\"Hollywood on the Tiber\" was between 1950 and 1970, during which time many of the most famous names in world cinema made films in Italy. The phrase \"Hollywood on Tiber\", a reference to the river that runs through Rome, was coined in 1950 by \"Time\" magazine during the making of \"Quo Vadis\".\nSword-and-sandal (a.k.a. Peplum) (1950s\u20131960s).\nSword-and-sandal, also known as \"peplum\" (\"pepla\" plural), is a subgenre of largely Italian-made historical, mythological, or Biblical epics mostly set in the Greco-Roman antiquity or the Middle Ages. These films attempted to emulate the big-budget Hollywood historical epics of the time.\nWith the release of 1958's \"Hercules\", starring American bodybuilder Steve Reeves, the Italian film industry gained entree to the American film market. These films were low-budget costume/adventure dramas, and had immediate appeal with both European and American audiences. Besides the many films starring a variety of muscle men as Hercules, heroes such as Samson and Italian fictional hero Maciste were common.\nSometimes dismissed as low-quality escapist fare, the sword-and-sandal allowed newer directors such as Sergio Leone and Mario Bava a means of breaking into the film industry. Some, such as Mario Bava's \"Hercules in the Haunted World\" (Italian: Ercole Al Centro Della Terra) are considered seminal works in their own right.\nAs the genre matured, budgets sometimes increased, as evidenced in 1962's \"I sette gladiatori\" (\"The Seven Gladiators\" in 1964 US release), a wide-screen epic with impressive sets and matte-painting work. Most sword-and-sandal films were in colour, whereas previous Italian efforts had often been black and white.\nMusicarelli (1950s\u20131970s).\nMusicarello (pl. musicarelli) is a film subgenre which emerged in Italy and which is characterised by the presence in main roles of young singers, already famous among their peers, and their new record album. The genre began in the late 1950s, and had its peak of production in the 1960s.\nThe film which started the genre is considered to be \"I ragazzi del Juke-Box\" by Lucio Fulci (1959). The musicarelli were inspired by two American musicals, in particular \"Jailhouse Rock\" by Richard Thorpe (1957) and earlier \"Love Me Tender\" by Robert D. Webb (1956), both starring Elvis Presley.\nAt the heart of the musicarello is a hit song, or a song that the producers hoped would become a hit, that usually shares its title with the film itself and sometimes has lyrics depicting a part of the plot. In the films there are almost always tender and chaste love stories accompanied by the desire to have fun and dance without thoughts. Musicarelli reflect the desire and need for emancipation of young Italians, highlighting some generational frictions.\nWith the arrival of the 1968 student protests the genre started to decline, because the generational revolt became explicitly political and at the same time there was no longer music equally directed to the whole youth audience. For some time the duo Al Bano and Romina Power continued to enjoy success in musicarello films, but their films (like their songs) were a return to the traditional melody and to the musical films of the previous decades.\n1960s.\nSpaghetti Western (1960s\u20131970s).\nOn the heels of the sword-and-sandal craze, a related genre, the Spaghetti Western arose and was popular both in Italy and elsewhere. These films differed from traditional westerns by being filmed in Europe on limited budgets, but featured vivid cinematography. The term was used by foreign critics because most of these westerns were produced and directed by Italians.\nThe most popular Spaghetti Westerns were those of Sergio Leone, credited as the inventor of the genre, whose Dollars Trilogy (1964's \"A Fistful of Dollars\", an unauthorized remake of the Japanese film \"Yojimbo\" by Akira Kurosawa; 1965's \"For a Few Dollars More\", an original sequel; and 1966's \"The Good, the Bad and the Ugly\", a World-famous prequel), featuring Clint Eastwood as a character marketed as \"the Man with No Name\" and notorious scores by Ennio Morricone, came to define the genre along with \"Once Upon a Time in the West\" (1968).\nAnother popular Spaghetti Western film is Sergio Corbucci \"Django\" (1966), starring Franco Nero as the titular character, another \"Yojimbo\" plagiarism, produced to capitalize on the success of \"A Fistful of Dollars\". The original \"Django\" was followed by both an authorized sequel (1987's \"Django Strikes Again\") and an overwhelming number of unauthorized uses of the same character in other films.\nBud Spencer and Terence Hill (1960s\u20131990s).\nAlso considered Spaghetti Westerns is a film genre which combined traditional western ambience with a Commedia all'italiana-type comedy; films including \"They Call Me Trinity\" (1970) and \"Trinity Is Still My Name\" (1971), both by Enzo Barboni, which featured Bud Spencer and Terence Hill, the stage names of Carlo Pedersoli and Mario Girotti.\nTerence Hill and Bud Spencer made numerous films together. Most of their early films were Spaghetti Westerns, beginning with \"God Forgives... I Don't!\" (1967), the first part of a trilogy, followed by \"Ace High\" (1968) and \"Boot Hill\" (1969), but they also starred in comedies such as \"... All the Way, Boys!\" (1972) and \"Watch Out, We're Mad!\" (1974).\nThe next films shot by the couple of actors, almost all comedies, were \"Two Missionaries\" (1974), \"Crime Busters\" (1977), \"Odds and Evens\" (1978), \"I'm for the Hippopotamus\" (1979), \"Who Finds a Friend Finds a Treasure\" (1981), \"Go for It\" (1983), \"Double Trouble\" (1984), \"Miami Supercops\" (1985) and \"Troublemakers\" (1994).\nGiallo (1960s\u2013present).\nDuring the 1960s and 1970s, Italian filmmakers Mario Bava, Riccardo Freda, Antonio Margheriti and Dario Argento developed \"giallo\" (plural \"gialli\", from \"giallo\", Italian for \"yellow\") horror films that become classics and influenced the genre in other countries. Representative films include: \"The Girl Who Knew Too Much\" (1963), \"Castle of Blood\" (1964), \"The Bird with the Crystal Plumage\" (1970), \"Twitch of the Death Nerve\" (1971), \"Deep Red\" (1975) and \"Suspiria\" (1977).\n\"Giallo\" is a genre of mystery fiction and thrillers and often contains slasher, crime fiction, psychological thriller, psychological horror, sexploitation, and, less frequently, supernatural horror elements. \"Giallo\" developed in the mid-to-late 1960s, peaked in popularity during the 1970s, and subsequently declined in commercial mainstream filmmaking over the next few decades, though examples continue to be produced. It was a predecessor to, and had significant influence on, the later American slasher film genre.\n\"Giallo\" usually blends the atmosphere and suspense of thriller fiction with elements of horror fiction (such as slasher violence) and eroticism (similar to the French \"fantastique\" genre), and often involves a mysterious killer whose identity is not revealed until the final act of the film. Most critics agree that the \"giallo\" represents a distinct category with unique features, but there is some disagreement on what exactly defines a \"giallo\" film.\n\"Giallo\" films are generally characterized as gruesome murder-mystery thrillers that combine the suspense elements of detective fiction with scenes of shocking horror, featuring excessive bloodletting, stylish camerawork and often jarring musical arrangements. The archetypal \"giallo\" plot involves a mysterious, black-gloved psychopathic killer who stalks and butchers a series of beautiful women. While most \"gialli\" involve a human killer, some also feature a supernatural element.\nThe typical \"giallo\" protagonist is an outsider of some type, often a traveller, tourist, outcast, or even an alienated or disgraced private investigator, and frequently a young woman, often a young woman who is lonely or alone in a strange or foreign situation or environment (\"gialli\" rarely or less frequently feature law enforcement officers as chief protagonists).\nThe protagonists are generally or often unconnected to the murders before they begin and are drawn to help find the killer through their role as witnesses to one of the murders. The mystery is the identity of the killer, who is often revealed in the climax to be another key character, who conceals his or her identity with a disguise (usually some combination of hat, mask, sunglasses, gloves, and trench coat). Thus, the literary whodunit element of the \"giallo\" novels is retained, while being filtered through horror genre elements and Italy's long-standing tradition of opera and staged grand guignol drama. The structure of \"giallo\" films is also sometimes reminiscent of the so-called \"weird menace\" pulp magazine horror mystery genre alongside Edgar Allan Poe and Agatha Christie.\nPoliziotteschi (1960s\u20131970s).\nPoliziotteschi (plural of poliziottesco) films constitute a subgenre of crime and action films that emerged in Italy in the late 1960s and reached the height of their popularity in the 1970s. They are also known as \"polizieschi all'italiana\", Euro-crime, Italo-crime, spaghetti crime films', or simply Italian crime films.\nInfluenced by both 1970s French crime films and gritty 1960s and 1970s American cop films and vigilante films, poliziotteschi films were made amidst an atmosphere of socio-political turmoil in Italy and increasing Italian crime rates.\nThe films generally featured graphic and brutal violence, organized crime, car chases, vigilantism, heists, gunfights, and corruption up to the highest levels. The protagonists were generally tough working-class loners, willing to act outside a corrupt or overly bureaucratic system. Notable international actors who acted in this genre of films include Alain Delon, Henry Silva, Fred Williamson, Charles Bronson, Tomas Milian and others.\nFranco and Ciccio (1960s\u20131980s).\nFranco and Ciccio were a comedy duo formed by Italian actors Franco Franchi (1928\u20131992) and Ciccio Ingrassia (1922\u20132003), particularly popular in the 1960s and 1970s. Together, they appeared in 116 films, usually as the main characters, and occasionally as supporting characters in films featuring well-known actors such as Tot\u00f2, Domenico Modugno, Vittorio Gassman, Buster Keaton and Vincent Price.\nTheir collaboration began in 1954 in the theatre field, and ended with Franchi's death in 1992. The two made their cinema debut in 1960 with the film \"Appuntamento a Ischia\". After, seeing them in this film Modugno, who wanted them with him in his film, and remained active until 1984 when they shot their last film together, \"Kaos\", although there were some interruptions in 1973, and from 1975 to 1980.\nThey acted in films certainly made in a short time and with few means, such as those shot with director Marcello Ciorciolini, sometimes even making a dozen films in a year, often without a real script and where they often improvised on the set. Also are the 13 films directed by Lucio Fulci, who was the architect of the reversal of their typical roles by making Ciccio the serious one, the sidekick, and Franco the comic one.\nThey also worked with important directors such as Pier Paolo Pasolini and the Taviani brothers. At the time, they were considered protagonists of B movie, they were subsequently reevaluated by critics for their comedy and creative abilities, becoming the subject of study. The huge success with the public is evidenced by the box office earnings, which in the 1960s, represented 10% of the annual earnings in Italy.\nSocial and political cinema (1960s\u20131970s).\nThe auteur cinema of the 1960s continues its path by analyzing distinct themes and problems. A new authorial vision is emancipated from the surreal and existential veins of Fellini and Antonioni which sees cinema as an ideal means of denouncing corruption and malfeasance, both in the political system and in the industrial world. Thus was born the structure of the investigative film which, starting from the neorealist analysis of the facts, added to them a concise critical judgment, with the manifest intent of shaking the consciences of public opinion. This typology deliberately touches upon burning issues, often targeting the established power, with the intent of reconstructing a historical truth that is often hidden or denied.\nThe precursor of this way of understanding the director's profession was Francesco Rosi. In 1962 he inaugurated the investigation film project retracing, through a series of long flashbacks, the life of the homonym Sicilian criminal in the film \"Salvatore Giuliano\". The following year he directed Rod Steiger in \"Hands over the City\" (1963), in which he courageously denounced the collusion existing between the various organs of the State and the building exploitation in Naples. The film was awarded the Golden Lion at the Venice Film Festival.\nOne of Francesco Rosi's most famous films of denunciation is \"The Mattei Affair\" (1972), a rigorous documentary into the mysterious disappearance of Enrico Mattei, manager of Eni, a large Italian state group. The film won the Palme d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival. It became (together with the tight \"Illustrious Corpses\" (1976)) a true model for similar denunciation films produced both in Italy and abroad. Famous films of denunciation by Elio Petri are \"The Working Class Goes to Heaven\" (1971), a corrosive denunciation of life in the factory (winner of the Palme d'Or at Cannes) and \"Investigation of a Citizen Above Suspicion\" (1970). The latter (accompanied by the incisive soundtrack by Ennio Morricone) is a dry psychoanalytic thriller centred on the aberrations of power, analyzed in a pathological key. The film obtained a wide consensus, winning the Academy Award for Best International Feature Film the following year.\nArguments related to civilian cinema can be found in the work of Damiano Damiani, who with \"The Day of the Owl\" (1968) enjoyed considerable success. Other feature films include, \"Confessions of a Police Captain\" (1971), \"The Case Is Closed, Forget It\" (1971), \"How to Kill a Judge\" (1974) and \"I Am Afraid\" (1977). Also Pasquale Squitieri for the film \"Il prefetto di ferro\" (1977) and Giuliano Montaldo, who after some experiences as an actor, staged some historical and political films such as \"The Fifth Day of Peace\" (1970), \"Sacco &amp; Vanzetti\" (1971) and \"Giordano Bruno\" (1973). Also Nanni Loy for the film \"In Prison Awaiting Trial\" (1971) starring Alberto Sordi.\n1970s.\nIn the 1970s the work done by the director Lina Wertm\u00fcller was influential, who together with the well-established actors Giancarlo Giannini and Mariangela Melato, gave life to successful films such as \"The Seduction of Mimi\" (1972), \"Love and Anarchy\" (1973) and \"Swept Away\" (1974). Two years later, with \"Seven Beauties\" (1976), she obtained four nominations for the Academy Awards, making her the first woman ever to receive a nomination for best director.\nThe last protagonist of the great season of the comedy is the director Ettore Scola. Throughout the 1950s, he played the role of screenwriter, and then makes his directorial debut in 1964 with the film \"Let's Talk About Women\". In 1974, he directed his best-known film, \"We All Loved Each Other So Much\", which traces 30 years of Italian history through the stories of three friends: the lawyer Gianni Perego (Vittorio Gassman), the porter Antonio (Nino Manfredi) and the intellectual Nicola (Stefano Satta Flores). Other films include, \"Down and Dirty\" (1976) starring Nino Manfredi, and \"A Special Day\" (1977) starring Sophia Loren and Marcello Mastroianni.\nCommedia sexy all'italiana (1970s\u20131980s).\nCommedia sexy all'italiana is characterized typically by both abundant female nudity and comedy, and by the minimal weight given to social criticism that was the basic ingredient of the main commedia all'italiana genre. Stories are often set in affluent environments such as wealthy households. It is closely connected to the sexual revolution, which was extremely new and innovative for that period. For the first time, films with female nudity could be watched at the cinema. Pornography and scenes of explicit sex were still forbidden in Italian cinemas, but partial nudity was somewhat tolerated. The genre has been described as a cross between bawdy comedy and humorous erotic film with ample slapstick elements which follow more or less clich\u00e9d storylines.\nDuring this time, commedia sexy all'italiana films, described by the film critics of the time as not artistic or \"trash films\", were very popular in Italy. Today they are widely re-evaluated and have become real cult movies. They also allowed the producers of Italian cinema to have enough revenue to produce successful artistic films. These comedy films were of little artistic value and reached their popularity by confronting Italian social taboos, most notably in the sexual sphere. Actors such as Lando Buzzanca, Lino Banfi, Renzo Montagnani, Alvaro Vitali, Gloria Guida, Barbara Bouchet and Edwige Fenech owe much of their popularity to these films.\nFantozzi (1970s\u20131990s).\nThe films starring Ugo Fantozzi, a character invented by Paolo Villaggio for his television sketches and newspaper short stories, also fell within the comic satirical comedy genre. Although Villaggio's movies tend to bridge comedy with a more elevated social satire, this character had a great impact on Italian society, to such a degree that the adjective \"fantozziano\" entered the lexicon. Ugo Fantozzi represents the archetype of the average Italian of the 1970s, middle-class with a simple lifestyle with the anxieties common to an entire class of workers, being re-evaluated by critics.\nOf the many films telling of Fantozzi's misadventures, the most notable and famous were \"Fantozzi\" (1975) and \"Il secondo tragico Fantozzi\" (1976), both directed by Luciano Salce, but many others were produced. The other films were \"Fantozzi contro tutti\" (1980) directed by Neri Parenti, \"Fantozzi subisce ancora\" (1983) by Neri Parenti, \"Superfantozzi\" (1986) by Neri Parenti, \"Fantozzi va in pensione\" (1988) by Neri Parenti, \"Fantozzi alla riscossa\" (1990) by Neri Parenti, \"Fantozzi in paradiso\" (1993) by Neri Parenti, \"Fantozzi - Il ritorno\" (1996) by Neri Parenti and \"Fantozzi 2000 - La clonazione\" (1999) by Domenico Saverni.\nSceneggiata (1970s\u20131990s).\nThe sceneggiata (pl. sceneggiate) or sceneggiata napoletana is a form of musical drama typical of Naples. Beginning as a form of musical theatre after World War I, it was also adapted for cinema; sceneggiata films became especially popular in the 1970s, and contributed to the genre becoming more widely known outside Naples. The most famous actors who played dramas were Mario Merola, Mario Trevi, and Nino D'Angelo.\nThe sceneggiata can be roughly described as a \"musical soap opera\", where action and dialogue are interspersed with Neapolitan songs. Plots revolve around melodramatic themes drawing from the Neapolitan culture and tradition, including passion, jealousy, betrayal, personal deceit and treachery, honour, vengeance, and life in the world of petty crime. Songs and dialogue were originally in Neapolitan dialect, although, especially in film production, Italian has sometimes been preferred, to reach a larger audience.\n\"Sgarro alla camorra\" (i.e. \"Offence to the Camorra\", 1973), written and directed by Ettore Maria Fizzarotti and starring Mario Merola at his film debut, is regarded as the first sceneggiata film and as a prototype for the genre. It was shot in Cetara, Province of Salerno. Outside Italy, sceneggiata is mostly known in areas populated by Italian immigrants. Besides Naples, the second homeland of sceneggiata is probably Little Italy in New York City.\n1980s.\nThe 1980s was a period of decline for Italian filmmaking. In 1985, only 80 films were produced (the least since the postwar period) and the total number of audience decreased from 525 million in 1970 to 123\u00a0million. It is a physiological process that invests, in the same period as other countries, with a great cinematographic tradition such as Japan, United Kingdom and France. The era of producers ended; Carlo Ponti and Dino De Laurentiis work abroad, Goffredo Lombardo and Franco Cristaldi were no longer key figures. The crisis affects the Italian genre cinema above all, which, by virtue of the success of commercial television, is deprived of the vast majority of its audience. As a result, cinemas began showing mainly Hollywood films, which steadily took over, while many other cinemas closed.\nAmong the major artistic films of this era were \"La citt\u00e0 delle donne\", \"E la nave va\", \"Ginger and Fred\" by Fellini, \"L'albero degli zoccoli\" by Ermanno Olmi (winner of the Palme d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival), \"La notte di San Lorenzo\" by Paolo and Vittorio Taviani, Antonioni's \"Identificazione di una donna\", and \"Bianca\" and \"La messa \u00e8 finita\" by Nanni Moretti. Although not entirely Italian, Bernardo Bertolucci's \"The Last Emperor\", winner of 9 Oscars including Best Picture and Best Director, and \"Once Upon a Time in America\" of Sergio Leone came out of this period also.\n\"Non ci resta che piangere\", directed by and starring both Roberto Benigni and Massimo Troisi, is a cult movie in Italy.\nCarlo Verdone, actor, screenwriter and film director, is best known for his comedic roles in Italian classics, which he also wrote and directed. His career was jumpstarted by his first three successes, \"Un sacco bello\" (1980), \"Bianco, rosso e Verdone\" (1981) and \"Borotalco\" (1982). Since the 1990s, he has been introducing more serious subjects in his work, linked to the excesses of society and the individual's hardships in confronting it; some examples are \"Maledetto il giorno che t'ho incontrata\" (1992), \"Il mio miglior nemico\" (2006) and \"Io, loro e Lara\" (2010).\nFrancesco Nuti began his professional career as an actor in the late 1970s, when he formed the cabaret group \"Giancattivi\" together with Alessandro Benvenuti and Athina Cenci. The group took part in the TV shows \"Black Out\" and \"Non Stop\" for RAI TV, and shot their first feature film, \"West of Paperino\" (1981), written and directed by Benvenuti. The following year Nuti abandoned the trio and began a solo career with three movies directed by Maurizio Ponzi: \"What a Ghostly Silence There Is Tonight\" (1982), \"The Pool Hustlers\" (1982) and \"Son contento\" (1983). Starting in 1985, he began to direct his movies, scoring an immediate success with the films \"Casablanca, Casablanca \" and \" All the Fault of Paradise\" (1985), \"Stregati\" (1987), \"Caruso Pascoski, Son of a Pole\" (1988), \"Willy Signori e vengo da lontano\" (1990) and \"Women in Skirts\" (1991). The 1990s were however a period of decline for the Tuscan director, with poorly successful movies such as \"OcchioPinocchio\" (1994), \"Mr. Fifteen Balls\" (1998), \"Io amo Andrea\" (2000) and \"Caruso, Zero for Conduct\" (2001).\nThe cinepanettoni (singular: \"cinepanettone\") are a series of farcical comedy films, one or two of which are scheduled for release annually in Italy during the Christmas period. The films were originally produced by Aurelio De Laurentiis' Filmauro studio. These films are usually focused on the holidays of stereotypical Italians: bungling, wealthy and presumptuous members of the middle class who visit famous, glamorous or exotic places.\n1990s.\nThe economic crisis that emerged in the 1980s began to ease over the next decade. Nonetheless, the 1992\u201393 and 1993\u201394 seasons marked an all-time low in the number of films made, in the national market share (15 per cent), in the total number of viewers (under 90 million per year) and in the number of cinemas. The effect of this industrial contraction sanctions the total disappearance of Italian genre cinema in the middle of the decade, as it was no longer suitable to compete with the contemporary big Hollywood blockbusters (mainly due to the enormous budget differences available), with its directors and actors who therefore almost entirely switch to television film.\nA new generation of directors has helped return Italian cinema to a healthy level since the end of the 1980s. Probably the most noted film of the period is \"Nuovo Cinema Paradiso\", for which Giuseppe Tornatore won a 1989 Oscar (awarded in 1990) for Best Foreign Language Film. This award was followed when Gabriele Salvatores's \"Mediterraneo\" won the same prize in 1991.\n\"\" (1994), directed by the British Michael Radford and starring Massimo Troisi, received five nominations at the Academy Awards, including Best Picture and Best Actor for Troisi, and won for Best Original Score. Another exploit was in 1998 when Roberto Benigni won three Oscars for his movie \"Life Is Beautiful\" (\"La vita \u00e8 bella)\" (Best Actor for Benigni himself, Best Foreign Film, Best Music). The film was also nominated for Best Picture.\nLeonardo Pieraccioni made his directorial debut with \"The Graduates\" (1995). In 1996 he directed his breakthrough film \"The Cyclone\", which grossed Lire\u00a075\u00a0billion at the box office.\n2000s.\nWith the new millennium, the Italian film industry regained stability and critical recognition. In 1995, 93 films were produced, while in 2005, 274 films were made. In 2006, the national market share reached 31 per cent. In 2001, Nanni Moretti's film \"The Son's Room\" (\"La stanza del figlio\") received the Palme d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival. Other noteworthy recent Italian films include: \"Jona che visse nella balena\" directed by Roberto Faenza, \"Il grande cocomero\" by Francesca Archibugi, \"The Profession of Arms\" (\"Il mestiere delle armi\") by Olmi, \"L'ora di religione\" by Marco Bellocchio, \"Il ladro di bambini\", \"Lamerica\", \"The Keys to the House\" (\"Le chiavi di casa\") by Gianni Amelio, \"I'm Not Scared\" (\"Io non-ho paura\") by Gabriele Salvatores, \"Le Fate Ignoranti\", \"Facing Windows\" (\"La finestra di fronte\") by Ferzan \u00d6zpetek, \"Good Morning, Night\" (\"Buongiorno, notte\") by Marco Bellocchio, \"The Best of Youth\" (\"La meglio giovent\u00f9\") by Marco Tullio Giordana, \"The Beast in the Heart\" (\"La bestia nel cuore\") by Cristina Comencini.\nIn 2008 Paolo Sorrentino's \"Il Divo\", a biographical film based on the life of Giulio Andreotti, won the Jury prize and \"Gomorra\", a crime drama film, directed by Matteo Garrone won the Gran Prix at the Cannes Film Festival.\n2010s.\nPaolo Sorrentino's \"The Great Beauty\" (\"La Grande Bellezza\") won the 2014 Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film.\nThe two highest-grossing Italian films in Italy have both been directed by Gennaro Nunziante and starred Checco Zalone: \"Sole a catinelle\" (2013) with \u20ac51.8\u00a0million, and \"Quo Vado?\" (2016) with \u20ac65.3\u00a0million.\n\"They Call Me Jeeg\", a 2016 critically acclaimed superhero film directed by Gabriele Mainetti and starring Claudio Santamaria, won many awards, such as eight David di Donatello, two Nastro d'Argento, and a Globo d'oro.\nGianfranco Rosi's documentary film \"Fire at Sea\" (2016) won the Golden Bear at the 66th Berlin International Film Festival. \"They Call Me Jeeg\" and \"Fire at Sea\" were also selected as the Italian entry for the Best Foreign Language Film at the 89th Academy Awards, but they were not nominated.\nOther successful 2010s Italian films include: \"Vincere\" and \"The Traitor\" by Marco Bellocchio, \"The First Beautiful Thing\" (\"La prima cosa bella\"), \"Human Capital\" (\"Il capitale umano\") and \"Like Crazy\" (\"La pazza gioia\") by Paolo Virz\u00ec, \"We Have a Pope\" (\"Habemus Papam\") and \"Mia Madre\" by Nanni Moretti, \"Caesar Must Die\" (\"Cesare deve morire\") by Paolo and Vittorio Taviani, \"Don't Be Bad\" (\"Non essere cattivo\") by Claudio Caligari, \"Romanzo Criminale\" by Michele Placido (that spawned a TV series, \"Romanzo criminale - La serie\"), \"Youth\" (\"La giovinezza\") by Paolo Sorrentino, \"Suburra\" by Stefano Sollima, \"Perfect Strangers\" (\"Perfetti sconosciuti\") by Paolo Genovese, \"Mediterranea\" and \"A Ciambra\" by Jonas Carpignano, \"Italian Race\" (\"Veloce come il vento\") and \"\" (\"Il primo re\") by Matteo Rovere, and \"Tale of Tales\" (\"Il racconto dei racconti\"), \"Dogman\" and \"Pinocchio\" by Matteo Garrone.\n\"Call Me by Your Name\" (2017), the final installment in Luca Guadagnino's thematic \"Desire\" trilogy, following \"I Am Love\" (2009) and \"A Bigger Splash\" (2015), received widespread acclaim and numerous accolades, including the Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay and the nomination for Best Picture in 2018.\n\"Perfect Strangers\" by Paolo Genovese was included in the \"Guinness World Records\" as it became the most remade film in cinema history, with a total of 18 versions of the film.\n2020s.\nItalian cinema in the 2020s has been marked by a renewed interest in social issues, the emergence of new directors, and the growing influence of streaming platforms alongside traditional theatrical releases. The COVID-19 pandemic initially disrupted production and distribution, encouraging hybrid release strategies and accelerating the role of digital platforms in reaching audiences.\nAmong the decade\u2019s most notable successes is \"There\u2019s Still Tomorrow\" (\"C\u2019\u00e8 ancora domani\", 2023), whiche became the highest-grossing Italian release of the year, won six David di Donatello awards, and sparked public debate on gender roles and domestic violence. Matteo Garrone\u2019s \"Io capitano\" (2023), recounting the migration journey of two Senegalese teenagers, premiered at Venice where it won the Silver Lion for Best Director and was selected as Italy\u2019s Oscar submission. At the same festival, Stefano Sollima presented \"Adagio\" (2023), a crime drama with Pierfrancesco Favino and Toni Servillo, acclaimed as the conclusion to his Roman trilogy.\nOther successful 2020s Italian films include: \"The Life Ahead\" by Edoardo Ponti, \"Hidden Away\" by Giorgio Diritti, \"Bad Tales\" by Damiano and Fabio D'Innocenzo, \"The Predators\" by Pietro Castellitto, \"Padrenostro\" by Claudio Noce, \"Notturno\" by Gianfranco Rosi, \"The King of Laughter\" by Mario Martone, \"A Chiara\" by Jonas Carpignano, \"Freaks Out\" by Gabriele Mainetti, \"The Hand of God\" by Paolo Sorrentino, \"Nostalgia\" by Mario Martone, \"Dry\" by Paolo Giordano, \"The Hanging Sun\" by Francesco Carrozzini, \"Bones and All\" by Luca Guadagnino, \"L'immensit\u00e0\" by Emanuele Crialese and \"Robbing Mussolini\" by Renato De Maria.\n100 Italian films to be saved.\nThe list of the 100 Italian films to be saved () was created with the aim to report \"100 films that have changed the collective memory of the country between 1942 and 1978\". The project was established in 2008 by the Venice Days festival section of the 65th Venice International Film Festival, in collaboration with Cinecitt\u00e0 Holding and with the support of the Ministry of Cultural Heritage.\nThe list was edited by Fabio Ferzetti, film critic of the newspaper \"Il Messaggero\", in collaboration with film director Gianni Amelio and the writers and film critics Gian Piero Brunetta, , Gianluca Farinelli, Giovanna Grignaffini, Paolo Mereghetti, Morando Morandini, Domenico Starnone and Sergio Toffetti.\nCinematheques.\nCineteca Nazionale is a film archive located in Rome. Founded in 1949, here are 80,000 films on file, 600,000 photographs, 50,000 posters and the collection of the Italian Association for the History of Cinema Research (AIRSC). It arose from the archival heritage of the Centro Sperimentale di Cinematografia, which in 1943, had been removed by the Nazi occupiers, losing unique materials. Cineteca Italiana is a private film archive located in Milan. Established in 1947, and as a foundation in 1996, the Cineteca Italiana houses over 20,000 films and more than 100,000 photographs from the history of Italian and international cinema.

{"id": "10789", "revid": "12744189", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=10789", "title": "Cinema of Poland", "text": "The history of cinema in Poland is almost as long as the history of cinematography, and it has universally recognized achievements, even though Polish films tend to be less commercially available than films from several other European nations.\nAfter World War II, the communist government built an auteur-based national cinema, trained hundreds of new directors and empowered them to make films. Filmmakers like Roman Pola\u0144ski, Krzysztof Kie\u015blowski, Agnieszka Holland, Andrzej Wajda, Andrzej \u017bu\u0142awski, Andrzej Munk, and Jerzy Skolimowski impacted the development of Polish film-making. In more recent years, the industry has been producer-led with finance being the key to a film being made.\nHistory.\nEarly history.\nThe first cinema was founded in \u0141\u00f3d\u017a in 1899, several years after the invention of the Cinematograph. Initially dubbed \"Living Pictures Theatre\", it gained much popularity and by the end of the next decade there were cinemas in almost every major town in Poland. Arguably the first Polish filmmaker was Kazimierz Pr\u00f3szy\u0144ski, who filmed various short documentaries in Warsaw. His pleograph film camera had been patented before the Lumi\u00e8re brothers' invention and he is credited as the author of the earliest surviving Polish documentary titled \"\u015alizgawka w \u0141azienkach\" (\"Skating-rink in the Royal Baths\", also known as \"On skating-rink\"), made between 1894 and 1896, as well as the first short narrative films \"Powr\u00f3t birbanta\" (\"Rake's return home\") and \"Przygoda doro\u017ckarza\" (\"Cabman's Adventure\"), both created in 1902. Another pioneer of cinema was Boles\u0142aw Matuszewski, who became one of the first filmmakers working for the Lumi\u00e8re company - and the official \"cinematographer\" of the Russian tsars in 1897.\nThe earliest surviving short film is \"Pruska kultura\" (\"Prussian Culture\") and the earliest surviving feature film is \"Anto\u015b pierwszy raz w Warszawie\" (\"Anto\u015b for the First Time in Warsaw\"). Both of them were made in 1908, the first one by an unknown director and the second one by Antoni Fertner. The date of \"Anto\u015b\"' premi\u00e8re, October 22, 1908, is considered the founding date of the Polish film industry. Soon Polish artists started experimenting with other genres of cinema: in 1910 W\u0142adys\u0142aw Starewicz made one of the first animated cartoons in the world - and the first to use the stop motion technique, the \"Pi\u0119kna Lukanida\" (\"Beautiful Lukanida\"). By the start of World War I the cinema in Poland was already in full swing, with numerous adaptations of major works of Polish literature screened (notably the \"Dzieje grzechu\", \"Meir Ezofowicz\" and \"Nad Niemnem\").\nDuring World War I the Polish cinema crossed borders. Films made in Warsaw or Vilnius were often rebranded with German-language intertitles and shown in Berlin. That was how a young actress Pola Negri (born Barbara Apolonia Cha\u0142upiec) gained fame in Germany and eventually became one of the European super-stars of silent film.\nThe first woman to direct a film in Poland and the only female film director of the Polish silent film era was Nina Niovilla. She debuted in 1918 in Berlin, and then directed her first Polish film titled \"Tamara\" (also known under the title \"Obro\u0144cy Lwowa\") in 1919.\nDuring World War II, Polish filmmakers in Great Britain created the anti-Nazi color film \"Calling Mr. Smith\" (1943) about Nazi crimes in occupied Europe and about Nazi propaganda. It was one of the first anti-Nazi films in history being both an avant-garde and a documentary film.\"\"\nAfter WWII.\nIn November 1945, the communist government founded the film production and distribution organization Film Polski, and put the well-known Polish People's Army filmmaker Aleksander Ford in charge. Starting with a few railway carriages full of film equipment taken from the Germans they proceed to train and build a Polish film industry. The FP output was limited; only thirteen features were released between 1947 and its dissolution in 1952, concentrating on Polish suffering at the hands of the Nazis. In 1947, Ford moved to help establish the new National Film School in \u0141\u00f3d\u017a, where he taught for 20 years.\nThe industry used imported cameras and film stocks. At first ORWO black and white film stock from East Germany and then Eastman colour negative stock and ORWO print stocks for rushes and release prints. Poland made its own lighting equipment. Because of the high costs of film stock Polish films were shot with very low shooting ratios, the amount of film stock used in shooting the film to length of the finished film. The equipment and film stock were not the best and budgets were modest but the film makers received probably the best training in the world from the Polish Film School. Another advantage was Film Polski's status as a state organisation, so its film-makers had access to all Polish institutions and their cooperation in making their films. Film cameras were able to enter almost every aspect of Polish life.\nThe first film produced in Poland following the World War II was \"Zakazane piosenki\" (1946), directed by Leonard Buczkowski, which was seen by 10.8 million people (out of 23,8 total population) in its initial theatrical run. Buczkowski continued to make films regularly until his death in 1967. Other important films of the early post-World War II period were \"The Last Stage\" (1948), directed by Wanda Jakubowska, who continued to make films until the transition from communism to capitalism in 1989, and \"Border Street\" (1949), directed by Aleksander Ford.\nBy the mid-1950s, following the end of Stalinism in Poland, Film production was organised into film groups. A film group was a collection of film makers, led by an experienced film director and consisting of writers, film directors and production managers. They would write scripts, create budgets, apply for funding off the Ministry of Culture and produce the picture. They would hire actors and crew, and use studios and laboratories controlled by Film Polski.\nThe change in political climate gave rise to the Polish Film School movement, a training ground for some of the icons of the world cinematography, e.g., Roman Pola\u0144ski (\"Knife in the Water\", \"Rosemary's Baby\", \"Frantic\", \"The Pianist\") and Krzysztof Zanussi (a leading director of the so-called \"cinema of moral anxiety\" of the 1970s). Andrzej Wajda's films offer insightful analyses of the universal element of the Polish experience - the struggle to maintain dignity under the most trying circumstances. His films defined several Polish generations. In 2000, Wajda was awarded an honorary Oscar for his overall contribution to cinema. Four of his films were nominated for Best Foreign Language Film award at Academy Awards with seven other Polish directors receiving one nomination each: Roman Pola\u0144ski, Jerzy Kawalerowicz, Jerzy Hoffman, Jerzy Antczak, Agnieszka Holland, Jan Komasa and Jerzy Skolimowski. In 2015, Polish filmmaker Pawe\u0142 Pawlikowski received this award for his film \"Ida\". In 2019, he was also nominated to the award for his next film \"Cold War\" in two categories - Best Foreign Language Film and Best Director.\nIt is also important to note that during the 1980s, the People's Republic of Poland instituted the martial law to vanquish and censor all forms of opposition against the communist rule of the nation, including outlets such as cinema and radio. A notable film to have emerged during this period was Ryszard Bugajski's 1982 film \"Interrogation\" (\"Przesluchanie\"), which depicts the story of an unfortunate woman (played by Krystyna Janda) who is arrested and tortured by the secret police into confessing a crime she knows nothing about. The anti-communist nature of the film brought about the film's over seven-year ban. In 1989, the ban was repealed after the overthrow of the Communist government in Poland, and the film was shown in theaters for the first time later that year. The film is still lauded today for its audacity in depicting the cruelty of the Stalinist regime, as many artists feared persecution during that time.\nIn the 1990s, Krzysztof Kie\u015blowski won a universal acclaim with productions such as \"Dekalog\" (made for television), \"The Double Life of V\u00e9ronique\" and the \"Three Colors\" trilogy. Another of the most famous movies in Poland is Krzysztof Krauze\u2019s \"The Debt\", which became a blockbuster. It showed the brutal reality of Polish capitalism and the growth of poverty. A considerable number of Polish film directors (e.g., Agnieszka Holland and Janusz Kami\u0144ski) have worked in American studios. Polish animated films - like those by Jan Lenica and Zbigniew Rybczy\u0144ski (Oscar, 1983) - drew on a long tradition and continued to derive their inspiration from Poland's graphic arts. Other notable Polish film directors include: Tomasz Bagi\u0144ski, Ma\u0142gorzata Szumowska, Jan Jakub Kolski, Jerzy Kawalerowicz, Stanis\u0142aw Bareja and Janusz Zaorski.\nAmong prominent annual film festivals taking place in Poland are: Warsaw International Film Festival, Camerimage, International Festival of Independent Cinema Off Camera, New Horizons Film Festival as well as Gdynia Film Festival and Polish Film Awards.\nCinema audience.\nThe Communist government invested resources into building a sophisticated cinema audience. All the cinema were state owned and consisted of first run premiere cinema, local cinema and art house cinemas. Tickets were cheap and students and old people received discounts. In the city of Lodz there were 36 cinemas in the 1970s showing films from all over the world. There were the Italian films of Fellini, French comedies, American crime movies such as Don Siegel's \"Charley Varrick\" . Films were shown in their original versions with Polish subtitles. Anti-Communist and Cold War films were not shown, but a bigger restriction was the cost of some films. There were popular film magazines like \"Film\" and \"Screen\", critical magazines such as \"Kino\". This all helped to build a well informed film audience.\nPolish Film Academy.\nThe Polish Film Academy was founded in 2003 in Warsaw and aims to provide native filmmakers a forum for discussion and a way to promote the reputation of Polish cinema through publications, presentations, discussions and regular promotion of the subject in the schools.\nAwards.\nSince 2003, the winners of the Polish Film Awards are elected by the members of the academy.\nFilm schools.\nSeveral institutions, both government run and private, provide formal education in various aspects of filmmaking.\nMuseums of cinematography.\nTwo museums devoted to the history of Polish film are located in \u0141\u00f3d\u017a:\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Sister-inline/styles.css\"/&gt; Media related to at Wikimedia Commons"}

Japan has one of the oldest and largest film industries in the world; as of 2022, it was the fourth largest by number of feature films produced (634) and the third largest in terms of box office revenue ($1.5 billion).\nDuring the 1950s, a period dubbed the \"Golden Age of Japanese cinema\", the \"jidaigeki\" films of Akira Kurosawa and the sci-fi films of Ishir\u014d Honda and Eiji Tsuburaya gained Japanese cinema international praise and made these directors universally renowned and highly influential. Some Japanese films of this period are now considered some of the greatest of all time: in 2012, Yasujir\u014d Ozu's film \"Tokyo Story\" (1953) was placed at No. 3 on \"Sight &amp; Sound\"'s 100 greatest films of all time and dethroned \"Citizen Kane\" (1941) atop the \"Sight &amp; Sound\" directors' poll of the top 50 greatest films of all time, while Kurosawa's film \"Seven Samurai\" (1954) topped the BBC's 2018 survey of the 100 Greatest Foreign-Language Films. Japan has also won the Academy Award for Best International Feature Film five times, more than any other Asian country.\nAnime rose in popularity during the 1980s, with new animated films being released every summer and winter, often based upon popular anime television series. Mamoru Oshii released his landmark film \"Angel's Egg\" (1985) while Hayao Miyazaki adapted his own manga series \"Nausica\u00e4 of the Valley of Wind\" into a 1984 film of the same name, and Katsuhiro Otomo followed suit by adapting his own manga series \"Akira\" into a 1988 film of the same name. Anime continues to be massively popular around the world, especially the works of Studio Ghibli, which counts among its highest-grossing films \"Princess Mononoke\" (1997), \"Spirited Away\" (2001), \"Howl's Moving Castle\" (2004), \"Ponyo\" (2008), and \"The Boy and the Heron\" (2023). As of 2025, the top 16 highest-grossing Japanese films worldwide are all anime, and the top 10 (four of which are by Studio Ghibli) were all released in the 21st century.\nAlthough Japanese horror films have been around since the post-war era that began in 1945 and gained recognition with \"kaiju\" such as \"Godzilla\" (1954), the genre did not experience a popularity boom until the late 1990s, with films such as \"Ringu\" (1998), \"Kairo\" (2001), \"Dark Water\" (2002), \"\" (2002), \"Yogen\" (2004), and \"One Missed Call\" (2004) garnering commercial success.\nJapan's primary film studios are Toho, Toei, Shochiku, and Kadokawa, which are nicknamed the \"Big Four\" and are the only members of the Motion Picture Producers Association of Japan (MPPAJ). The Japan Academy Film Prize, hosted annually by the Nippon Academy-sh\u014d Association, was created in 1978 and is considered to be the Japanese equivalent of the Academy Awards.\nHistory.\nEarly silent era.\nThe kinetoscope, first shown commercially by Thomas Edison in the U.S. in 1894, was first shown in Japan in November 1896. The Vitascope and the Lumi\u00e8re Brothers' Cinematograph were first presented in Japan in early 1897, by businessmen such as Inabata Katsutaro. Lumi\u00e8re cameramen were the first to shoot films in Japan. Moving pictures, however, were not an entirely new experience for the Japanese because of their rich tradition of pre-cinematic devices such as \"gent\u014d\" (\"utsushi-e\") or the magic lantern. The first successful Japanese film in late 1897 showed sights in Tokyo.\nIn 1898, some ghost films were made, such as the Shir\u014d Asano shorts \"Bake Jizo\" (Jizo the Spook / \u5316\u3051\u5730\u8535) and \"Shinin no sosei\" (Resurrection of a Corpse). The first documentary, the short \"Geisha no teodori\" (\u82b8\u8005\u306e\u624b\u8e0a\u308a), was made in June 1899. Tsunekichi Shibata made a number of early films, including \"Momijigari\", an 1899 record of two famous actors performing a scene from a well-known kabuki play. Early films were influenced by traditional theater\u00a0\u2013 for example, kabuki and bunraku.\n20th century.\nAt the dawn of the 20th century, theaters in Japan hired benshi, storytellers who sat next to the screen and narrated silent movies. They were descendants of kabuki j\u014druri, k\u014ddan storytellers, theater barkers and other forms of oral storytelling. Benshi could be accompanied by music like silent films from cinema of the West. With the advent of sound in the early 1930s, the benshi gradually declined.\nIn 1908, Sh\u014dz\u014d Makino, considered the pioneering director of Japanese film, began his influential career with \"Honn\u014dji gassen\" (\u672c\u80fd\u5bfa\u5408\u6226), produced for Yokota Sh\u014dkai. Sh\u014dz\u014d recruited Matsunosuke Onoe, a former kabuki actor, to star in his productions. Onoe became Japan's first film star, appearing in over 1,000 films, mostly shorts, between 1909 and 1926. The pair pioneered the \"jidaigeki\" genre. Tokihiko Okada was a popular romantic lead of the same era.\nThe first Japanese film production studio was built in 1909 by the Yoshizawa Sh\u014dten company in Tokyo.\nThe first female Japanese performer to appear in a film professionally was the dancer/actress Tokuko Nagai Takagi, who appeared in four shorts for the American-based Thanhouser Company between 1911 and 1914.\nAmong intellectuals, critiques of Japanese cinema grew in the 1910s and eventually developed into a movement that transformed Japanese film. Film criticism began with early film magazines such as \"Katsud\u014d shashinkai\" (begun in 1909) and a full-length book written by Yasunosuke Gonda in 1914, but many early film critics often focused on chastising the work of studios like Nikkatsu and Tenkatsu for being too theatrical (using, for instance, elements from kabuki and shinpa such as onnagata) and for not utilizing what were considered more cinematic techniques to tell stories, instead relying on benshi. In what was later named the Pure Film Movement, writers in magazines such as \"Kinema Record\" called for a broader use of such cinematic techniques. Some of these critics, such as Norimasa Kaeriyama, went on to put their ideas into practice by directing such films as \"The Glow of Life\" (1918), which was one of the first films to use actresses (in this case, Harumi Hanayagi). There were parallel efforts elsewhere in the film industry. In his 1917 film \"The Captain's Daughter\" (based on the play by Choji Nakauchi, based in turn on the German film, \"Gendarm M\u00f6bius\"), Masao Inoue started using techniques new to the silent film era, such as the close-up and cut back. The Pure Film Movement was central in the development of the gendaigeki and scriptwriting.\nNew studios established around 1920, such as Shochiku and Taikatsu, aided the cause for reform. At Taikatsu, Thomas Kurihara directed films scripted by the novelist Junichiro Tanizaki, who was a strong advocate of film reform. Even Nikkatsu produced reformist films under the direction of Eiz\u014d Tanaka. By the mid-1920s, actresses had replaced onnagata and films used more of the devices pioneered by Inoue. Some of the most discussed silent films from Japan are those of Kenji Mizoguchi, whose later works (including \"Ugetsu\"/\"Ugetsu Monogatari\") retain a very high reputation.\nJapanese films gained popularity in the mid-1920s against foreign films, in part fueled by the popularity of movie stars and a new style of jidaigeki. Directors such as Daisuke It\u014d and Masahiro Makino made samurai films like \"A Diary of Chuji's Travels\" and \"Roningai\" featuring rebellious antiheroes in fast-cut fight scenes that were both critically acclaimed and commercial successes. Some stars, such as Tsumasaburo Bando, Kanj\u016br\u014d Arashi, Chiez\u014d Kataoka, Takako Irie and Utaemon Ichikawa, were inspired by Makino Film Productions and formed their own independent production companies where directors such as Hiroshi Inagaki, Mansaku Itami and Sadao Yamanaka honed their skills. Director Teinosuke Kinugasa created a production company to produce the experimental masterpiece \"A Page of Madness\", starring Masao Inoue, in 1926. Many of these companies, while surviving during the silent era against major studios like Nikkatsu, Shochiku, Teikine, and Toa Studios, could not survive the cost involved in converting to sound.\nWith the rise of left-wing political movements and labor unions at the end of the 1920s, there arose so-called tendency films with left-leaning tendencies. Directors Kenji Mizoguchi, Daisuke It\u014d, Shigeyoshi Suzuki, and Tomu Uchida were prominent examples. In contrast to these commercially produced 35 mm films, the Marxist Proletarian Film League of Japan (Prokino) made works independently in smaller gauges (such as 9.5mm and 16mm), with more radical intentions. Tendency films suffered from severe censorship heading into the 1930s, and Prokino members were arrested and the movement effectively crushed. Such moves by the government had profound effects on the expression of political dissent in 1930s cinema. Films from this period include: \"Sakanaya Honda, Jitsuroku Chushingura, Horaijima, Orochi, Maboroshi, Kurutta Ippeji, Jujiro, \", and \"Kurama Tengu\".\nThe 1923 earthquake, the bombing of Tokyo during World War II, and the natural effects of time and Japan's humidity on flammable and unstable nitrate film have resulted in a great dearth of surviving films from this period.Ref?\nUnlike in the West, silent films were still being produced in Japan well into the 1930s; as late as 1938, a third of Japanese films were silent. For instance, Yasujir\u014d Ozu's \"An Inn in Tokyo\" (1935), considered a precursor to the neorealism genre, was a silent film. A few Japanese sound shorts were made in the 1920s and 1930s, but Japan's first feature-length talkie was \"Fujiwara Yoshie no furusato\" (1930), which used the \"Mina Talkie System\". Notable talkies of this period include Mikio Naruse's \"Wife, Be Like A Rose!\" (\"Tsuma Yo Bara No Yoni\", 1935), which was one of the first Japanese films to gain a theatrical release in the U.S.; Kenji Mizoguchi's \"Sisters of the Gion\" (\"Gion no shimai\", 1936); \"Osaka Elegy\" (1936); \"The Story of the Last Chrysanthemums\" (1939); and Sadao Yamanaka's \"Humanity and Paper Balloons\" (1937).\nFilm criticism shared this vitality, with many film journals such as \"Kinema Junpo\" and newspapers printing detailed discussions of the cinema of the day, both at home and abroad. A cultured \"impressionist\" criticism pursued by critics such as Tadashi Iijima, Fuyuhiko Kitagawa, and Matsuo Kishi was dominant, but opposed by leftist critics such as Akira Iwasaki and Genj\u016b Sasa who sought an ideological critique of films.\nThe 1930s also saw increased government involvement in cinema, which was symbolized by the passing of the Film Law, which gave the state more authority over the film industry, in 1939. The government encouraged some forms of cinema, producing propaganda films and promoting documentary films (also called \"bunka eiga\" or \"culture films\"), with important documentaries being made by directors such as Fumio Kamei. Realism was in favor; film theorists such as Taihei Imamura and Heiichi Sugiyama advocated for documentary or realist drama, while directors such as Hiroshi Shimizu and Tomotaka Tasaka produced fiction films that were strongly realistic in style. Films reinforced the importance of traditional Japanese values against the rise of the Westernised modern girl, a character epitomised by Shizue Tatsuta in Ozu's 1930 film \"Young Lady\".\nWartime movies.\nBecause of World War II and the weak economy, unemployment became widespread in Japan, and the cinema industry suffered.\nDuring this period, when Japan was expanding its empire, the Japanese government saw cinema as a propaganda tool to show the glory and invincibility of the Empire of Japan. Thus, many films from this period depict patriotic and militaristic themes. In 1942, Kajiro Yamamoto's film \"The War at Sea from Hawaii to Malaya\" portrayed the attack on Pearl Harbor; the film made use of special effects directed by Eiji Tsuburaya, including a miniature scale model of Pearl Harbor itself.\nKamishibai (\u7d19\u829d\u5c45) or paper theater was a popular form of street entertainment, especially for the children. Kamishibai was often used to tell stories of Buddhist deities and the history of some Buddhist temples. In 1920 it started out as normal storytelling for the children, but in about 1932, it started to lean more to a militaristic viewpoint.\nYoshiko Yamaguchi was a very popular actress. She rose to international stardom with 22 wartime movies. The Manchukuo Film Association let her use the Chinese name Li Xianglan so she could represent Chinese roles in Japanese propaganda movies. After the war she used her official Japanese name and starred in an additional 29 movies. She was elected as a member of the Japanese parliament in the 1970s and served for 18 years.\nAkira Kurosawa made his feature film debut with \"Sugata Sanshiro\" in 1943.\nAmerican occupation.\nAfter the surrender of Japan in 1945, wartime controls and restrictions on the Japanese film industry were abolished, and the Supreme Commander for the Allied Powers (SCAP) established the Civil Information and Education Section (CIE), which came to manage the industry. All film proposals and screenplays were to be processed and approved by CIE. The script would then be processed by the Civil Censorship Detachment (CCD), which was under the direct control of American military. Pre-war and wartime films were also subject to review, and over 500 were condemned, with half of them being burned. In addition, Toho and Daiei pre-emptively destroyed films they thought to be incriminating. In November 1945, CIE announced that it would forbid films deemed to be: \nA major consequence of these restrictions was that the production of \"jidaigeki\" films, especially those involving samurai, became effectively impossible. A notable case of censorship was of the war film \"Escape at Dawn,\" written by Akira Kurosawa and Senkichi Taniguchi, which was re-written over a dozen times at the request of CIE, largely erasing the original content of the story. On the other hand, the CIE favored the production of films that reflected the policies of the Occupation, such as agricultural reform and the organization of labor unions, and promoted the peaceful redevelopment of Japan and the rights of individuals.\nSignificant movies among them are, Setsuko Hara appeared in Akira Kurosawa's \"No Regrets for Our Youth\" (1946), K\u014dzabur\u014d Yoshimura's \"A Ball at the Anjo House\" (1947), Tadashi Imai's \"Aoi sanmyaku\" (1949), etc. It gained national popularity as a star symbolizing the beginning of a new era. In Yasushi Sasaki's \"Hatachi no Seishun\" (1946), the first kiss scene of a Japanese movie was filmed. The Mainichi Film Award was also created in 1946.\nThe first movie released after the war was \"Soyokaze\", directed by Yasushi Sasaki, and the theme song \"Ringo no Uta\" was a big hit.\nThe first collaborations between Akira Kurosawa and actor Toshiro Mifune were \"Drunken Angel\" in 1948 and \"Stray Dog\" in 1949. Yasujir\u014d Ozu directed the critically and commercially successful \"Late Spring\" in 1949.\nIn the later half of the Occupation, the Reverse Course came into effect. Left-wing filmmakers displaced from the major studios in the Red Purge joined those displaced after suppression of the Toho strikes, forming a new independent film movement. Directors such as Fumio Kamei, Tadashi Imai and Satsuo Yamamoto were members of the Japanese Communist Party. Independent social realist dramas saw a small and temporary boom amid the wave of sentimental war dramas produced after the end of Occupation.\nGolden Age.\nThe 1950s are widely considered the Golden Age of Japanese cinema. Three Japanese films from this decade (\"Rashomon\", \"Seven Samurai\" and \"Tokyo Story\") appeared in the top ten of \"Sight &amp; Sound\"'s critics' and directors' polls for the best films of all time in 2002. They also appeared in the 2012 polls, with \"Tokyo Story\" (1953) dethroning \"Citizen Kane\" at the top of the 2012 directors' poll.\nWar movies covering themes previously restricted by SCAP began to be produced, such as Hideo Sekigawa's \"Listen to the Voices of the Sea\" (1950), Tadashi Imai's \"Himeyuri no T\u00f4\" (\"Tower of the Lilies,\" 1953), Keisuke Kinoshita's \"Twenty-Four Eyes\" (1954) and Kon Ichikawa's \"The Burmese Harp\" (1956). Works showcasing tragic and sentimental retrospectives of the war experience became a public phenomenon. Other films produced include \"Battleship Yamato\" (1953) and \"Eagle of the Pacific\" (1953). Under these circumstances, movies such as \"Emperor Meiji and the Russo-Japanese War\" (\u660e\u6cbb\u5929\u7687\u3068\u65e5\u9732\u5927\u6226\u4e89, 1957), where Kanj\u016br\u014d Arashi played Emperor Meiji, also appeared. It was a situation that was unthinkable before the war, the commercialization of the Emperor who was supposed to be sacred and inviolable.\nThe period after the American Occupation led to a rise in diversity in movie distribution thanks to the increased output and popularity of the film studios of Toho, Daiei, Shochiku, Nikkatsu, and Toei. This period gave rise to the six great artists of Japanese cinema: Masaki Kobayashi, Akira Kurosawa, Ishir\u014d Honda, Eiji Tsuburaya, Kenji Mizoguchi, and Yasujir\u014d Ozu. Each director dealt with the effects the war and subsequent occupation by America in unique and innovative ways. During this decade, the works of Kurosawa, Honda, and Tsuburaya would become the first Japanese films to be widely distributed in foreign theaters.\nThe decade started with Akira Kurosawa's \"Rashomon\" (1950), which won the Golden Lion at the Venice Film Festival in 1951 and the Academy Honorary Award for Best Foreign Language Film in 1952, and marked the entrance of Japanese cinema onto the world stage. It was also the breakout role for legendary star Toshiro Mifune. In 1953, \"Entotsu no mieru basho\" by Heinosuke Gosho was in competition at the 3rd Berlin International Film Festival.\nThe first Japanese film in color was \"Carmen Comes Home\" directed by Keisuke Kinoshita and released in 1951. There was also a black-and-white version of this film available. \"Tokyo File 212\" (1951) was the first American feature film to be shot entirely in Japan. The lead roles were played by Florence Marly and Robert Peyton. It featured the geisha Ichimaru in a short cameo. Suzuki Ikuzo's Tonichi Enterprises Company co-produced the film. \"Gate of Hell\", a 1953 film by Teinosuke Kinugasa, was the first movie that filmed using Eastmancolor film, \"Gate of Hell\" was both Daiei's first color film and the first Japanese color movie to be released outside Japan, receiving an Academy Honorary Award in 1954 for Best Costume Design by Sanzo Wada and an Honorary Award for Best Foreign Language Film. It also won the Palme d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival, the first Japanese film to achieve that honour.\nThe year 1954 saw two of Japan's most influential films released. The first was the Kurosawa epic \"Seven Samurai\", about a band of hired samurai who protect a helpless village from a rapacious gang of thieves. The same year, Kurosawa's friend and colleague Ishir\u014d Honda directed the anti-nuclear monster-drama \"Godzilla\", featuring award-winning effects by Eiji Tsuburaya. The latter film was first ever Japanese film to be given a wide release throughout the United States, where it was heavily re-edited, and featured new footage with actor Raymond Burr for its distribution in 1956 as \"Godzilla, King of the Monsters!\". Although it was edited for its Western release, Godzilla became an international icon of Japan and spawned an entire subgenre of \"kaiju\" films, as well as the longest-running film franchise in history. Also in 1954, another Kurosawa film, \"Ikiru\" was in competition at the 4th Berlin International Film Festival.\nIn 1955, Hiroshi Inagaki won an Academy Honorary Award for Best Foreign Language Film for of his \"Samurai\" trilogy and in 1958 won the Golden Lion at the Venice Film Festival for \"Rickshaw Man\". Kon Ichikawa directed two anti-war dramas: \"The Burmese Harp\" (1956), which was nominated for Best Foreign Language Film at the Academy Awards, and \"Fires on the Plain\" (1959), along with \"Enjo\" (1958), which was adapted from Yukio Mishima's novel \"Temple of The Golden Pavilion\". Masaki Kobayashi made three films which would collectively become known as \"The Human Condition Trilogy\": \"No Greater Love\" (1959), and \"The Road to Eternity\" (1959). The trilogy was completed in 1961, with \"A Soldier's Prayer\".\nKenji Mizoguchi, who died in 1956, ended his career with a series of masterpieces including \"The Life of Oharu\" (1952), \"Ugetsu\" (1953) and \"Sansho the Bailiff\" (1954). He won the Silver Lion at the Venice Film Festival for \"Ugetsu\". Mizoguchi's films often deal with the tragedies inflicted on women by Japanese society. Mikio Naruse made \"Repast\" (1950), \"Late Chrysanthemums\" (1954), \"Sound of the Mountain\" (1954) and \"Floating Clouds\" (1955). Yasujir\u014d Ozu began directing color films beginning with \"Equinox Flower\" (1958), and later \"Good Morning\" (1959) and \"Floating Weeds\" (1958), which was adapted from his earlier silent \"A Story of Floating Weeds\" (1934), and was shot by \"Rashomon\" and \"Sansho the Bailiff\" cinematographer Kazuo Miyagawa.\nThe Blue Ribbon Awards were established in 1950. The first winner for Best Film was \"Until We Meet Again\" by Tadashi Imai.\nThe number of films produced, and the cinema audience reached a peak in the 1960s. Most films were shown in double bills, with one half of the bill being a \"program picture\" or B movie. A typical program picture was shot in four weeks. The demand for these program pictures in quantity meant the growth of film series such as \"The Hoodlum Soldier\" or \"Akumyo\".\nThe huge level of activity of 1960s Japanese cinema also resulted in many classics. Akira Kurosawa directed the 1961 classic \"Yojimbo\". Yasujir\u014d Ozu made his final film, \"An Autumn Afternoon\", in 1962. Mikio Naruse directed the wide screen melodrama \"When a Woman Ascends the Stairs\" in 1960; his final film was 1967's \"Scattered Clouds\".\nKon Ichikawa captured the watershed 1964 Olympics in his three-hour documentary \"Tokyo Olympiad\" (1965). Seijun Suzuki was fired by Nikkatsu for \"making films that don't make any sense and don't make any money\" after his surrealist yakuza flick \"Branded to Kill\" (1967).\nThe 1960s were the peak years of the \"Japanese New Wave\" movement, which began in the 1950s and continued through the early 1970s. Nagisa Oshima, Kaneto Shindo, Masahiro Shinoda, Susumu Hani and Shohei Imamura emerged as major filmmakers during the decade. Oshima's \"Cruel Story of Youth\", \"Night and Fog in Japan\" and \"Death by Hanging\", along with Shindo's \"Onibaba\", Hani's \"Kanojo to kare\" and Imamura's \"The Insect Woman\", became some of the better-known examples of Japanese New Wave filmmaking. Documentary played a crucial role in the New Wave, as directors such as Hani, Kazuo Kuroki, Toshio Matsumoto, and Hiroshi Teshigahara moved from documentary into fiction film, while feature filmmakers like Oshima and Imamura also made documentaries. Shinsuke Ogawa and Noriaki Tsuchimoto became the most important documentarists: \"two figures [that] tower over the landscape of Japanese documentary.\"\nTeshigahara's \"Woman in the Dunes\" (1964) won the Special Jury Prize at the Cannes Film Festival, and was nominated for Best Director and Best Foreign Language Film Oscars. Masaki Kobayashi's \"Kwaidan\" (1965) also picked up the Special Jury Prize at Cannes and received a nomination for Best Foreign Language Film at the Academy Awards. \"Bushido, Samurai Saga\" by Tadashi Imai won the Golden Bear at the 13th Berlin International Film Festival. \"Immortal Love\" by Keisuke Kinoshita and \"Twin Sisters of Kyoto\" and \"Portrait of Chieko\", both by Noboru Nakamura, also received nominations for Best Foreign Language Film at the Academy Awards. \"Lost Spring\", also by Nakamura, was in competition for the Golden Bear at the 17th Berlin International Film Festival.\nThe 1970s saw the cinema audience drop due to the spread of television. Total audience declined from 1.2 billion in 1960 to 0.2 billion in 1980.\nFilm companies refused to hire top actors and directors, not even the companies' production skills to the television industry, thereby making the film companies losing money.\nFilm companies fought back in various ways, such as the bigger budget films of Kadokawa Pictures, or including increasingly sexual or violent content and language which could not be shown on television. The resulting pink film industry became the stepping stone for many young independent filmmakers. The seventies also saw the start of the \"idol eiga\", films starring young \"idols\", who would bring in audiences due to their fame and popularity.\nToshiya Fujita made the revenge film \"Lady Snowblood\" in 1973. In the same year, Yoshishige Yoshida made the film \"Coup d'\u00c9tat\", a portrait of Ikki Kita, the leader of the Japanese coup of February 1936. Its experimental cinematography and mise-en-sc\u00e8ne, as well as its avant-garde score by Toshi Ichiyanagi, garnered it wide critical acclaim within Japan.\nIn 1976, the Hochi Film Award was created. The first winner for Best Film was \"The Inugamis\" by Kon Ichikawa. Nagisa Oshima directed \"In the Realm of the Senses\" (1976), a film detailing a crime of passion involving Sada Abe set in the 1930s. Controversial for its explicit sexual content, it has never been seen uncensored in Japan.\nKinji Fukasaku completed the epic \"Battles Without Honor and Humanity\" series of yakuza films. Yoji Yamada introduced the commercially successful \"Tora-San\" series, while also directing other films, notably the popular \"The Yellow Handkerchief\", which won the first Japan Academy Prize for Best Film in 1978. New wave filmmakers Susumu Hani and Sh\u014dhei Imamura retreated to documentary work, though Imamura made a dramatic return to feature filmmaking with \"Vengeance Is Mine\" (1979).\n\"Dodes'ka-den\" by Akira Kurosawa and \"Sandakan No. 8\" by Kei Kumai were nominated to the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film.\nThe 1980s saw the decline of the major Japanese film studios and their associated chains of cinemas, with major studios Toho and Toei barely staying in business, Shochiku supported almost solely by the \"Otoko wa tsurai yo\" films, and Nikkatsu declining even further.\nOf the older generation of directors, Akira Kurosawa directed \"Kagemusha\" (1980), which won the Palme d'Or at the 1980 Cannes Film Festival, and \"Ran\" (1985). Seijun Suzuki made a comeback beginning with \"Zigeunerweisen\" in 1980. Shohei Imamura won the Palme d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival for \"The Ballad of Narayama\" (1983). Yoshishige Yoshida made \"A Promise\" (1986), his first film since 1973's \"Coup d'\u00c9tat\".\nNew directors who appeared in the 1980s include actor Juzo Itami, who directed his first film, \"The Funeral\", in 1984, and achieved critical and box office success with \"Tampopo\" in 1985. Shinji S\u014dmai, an artistically inclined populist director who made films like the youth-focused \"Typhoon Club\", and the critically acclaimed Roman porno \"Love Hotel\" among others. Kiyoshi Kurosawa, who would generate international attention beginning in the mid-1990s, made his initial debut with pink films and genre horror.\nDuring the 1980s, anime rose in popularity, with new animated movies released every summer and winter, often based upon popular anime television series. Mamoru Oshii released his landmark \"Angel's Egg\" in 1985 while Hayao Miyazaki adapted his manga series, \"Nausica\u00e4 of the Valley of Wind,\" into a feature film of the same name in 1984. Katsuhiro Otomo followed suit by adapting his own manga \"Akira\" into a feature film of the same name in 1988.\nEventually the home video made it possible to where the Japanese civilians, and eventually citizens in other countries, could watch these films individually. This would increase sales in the direct-to-video film industry, allowing for further developments, such as DVD's and eventual streaming services, to develop.\nMini theaters, a type of independent movie theater characterized by a smaller size and seating capacity in comparison to larger movie theaters, gained popularity during the 1980s. Mini theaters helped bring independent and arthouse films from other countries, as well as films produced in Japan by unknown Japanese filmmakers, to Japanese audiences.\nHeisei and Reiwa eras.\nBecause of economic recessions, the number of movie theaters in Japan had been steadily decreasing since the 1960s. The number of cinemas was under 2,000 in 1993 compared to more than 7,000 in 1960. The 1990s saw the reversal of this trend and the introduction of the multiplex in Japan. At the same time, the popularity of mini theaters continued.\nTakeshi Kitano emerged as a significant filmmaker with works such as \"Sonatine\" (1993), \"Kids Return\" (1996) and \"Hana-bi\" (1997), which was given the Golden Lion at the Venice Film Festival. Sh\u014dhei Imamura again won the Palme d'Or (shared with Iranian director Abbas Kiarostami), this time for \"The Eel\" (1997). He became the fifth two-time recipient, joining Alf Sj\u00f6berg, Francis Ford Coppola, Emir Kusturica and Bille August.\nKiyoshi Kurosawa gained international recognition following the release of \"Cure\" (1997). Takashi Miike launched a prolific career with titles such as \"Audition\" (1999), \"Dead or Alive\" (1999) and \"The Bird People in China\" (1998). Former documentary filmmaker Hirokazu Koreeda launched an acclaimed feature career with \"Maborosi\" (1996) and \"After Life\" (1999).\nHayao Miyazaki directed two mammoth box office and critical successes, \"Porco Rosso\" (1992)\u00a0\u2013 which beat \"E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial\" (1982) as the highest-grossing film in Japan\u00a0\u2013 and \"Princess Mononoke\" (1997), which also claimed the top box office spot until \"Titanic\" (1997).\nSeveral new anime directors rose to widespread recognition, bringing with them notions of anime as not only entertainment, but modern art. Mamoru Oshii released the internationally acclaimed philosophical science fiction action film \"Ghost in the Shell\" in 1996. Satoshi Kon directed the award-winning psychological thriller \"Perfect Blue\". Hideaki Anno also gained considerable recognition with \"The End of Evangelion\" in 1997.\nIn the beginning of 21st century, Japan has been referenced numerous times in popular culture, which was a relatively successful one for Japanese film industry, returning to the idea of a second Japanese New Wave\u201d in their cinematic releases. The country has appeared as a setting and topic multiple times in film, poetry, television, and music. The number of films being shown in Japan steadily increased, with about 821 films released in 2006. Films based on Japanese television series were especially popular during this period. Anime films now accounted for 60 percent of Japanese film production and would become one of the world\u2019s leading producers of animated cinema. The 1990s and 2000s are considered to be \"Japanese Cinema's Second Golden Age\", due to the immense popularity of anime, both within Japan and overseas.\nAlthough not a commercial success, \"All About Lily Chou-Chou\" directed by Shunji Iwai was honored at the Berlin, the Yokohama and the Shanghai Film Festivals in 2001. Takeshi Kitano appeared in \"Battle Royale\" and directed and starred in \"Dolls\" and \"Zatoichi\". Beginning in the late 1990s, the J-horror film genre began to boom, as films such as \"Ringu,\" \"Kairo\", \"Dark Water\", \"Yogen\", the \"Grudge\" series and \"One Missed Call\" met with commercial success. In 2004, \"\", directed by Ryuhei Kitamura, was released to celebrate the 50th anniversary of Godzilla. In 2005, director Seijun Suzuki made his 56th film, \"Princess Raccoon\". Hirokazu Koreeda claimed film festival awards around the world with two of his films \"Distance\" and \"Nobody Knows\". Female film director Naomi Kawase's film \"The Mourning Forest\" won the Grand Prix at the Cannes Film Festival in 2007. Yoji Yamada, director of the Otoko wa Tsurai yo series, made a trilogy of acclaimed revisionist samurai films, 2002's \"Twilight Samurai\", followed by \"The Hidden Blade\" in 2004 and \"Love and Honor\" in 2006. In 2008, \"Departures\" won the Academy Award for best foreign language film.\nIn anime, Hayao Miyazaki directed \"Spirited Away\" in 2001, breaking Japanese box office records and winning several awards\u2014including the Academy Award for Best Animated Feature in 2003\u2014followed by \"Howl's Moving Castle\" and \"Ponyo\" in 2004 and 2008 respectively. In 2004, Mamoru Oshii released the anime movie \"\" which received critical praise around the world. His 2008 film \"The Sky Crawlers\" was met with similarly positive international reception. Satoshi Kon also released three quieter, but nonetheless highly successful films: \"Millennium Actress\", \"Tokyo Godfathers\", and \"Paprika\". Katsuhiro Otomo released \"Steamboy\", his first animated project since the 1995 short film compilation \"Memories\", in 2004. In collaboration with Studio 4C, American director Michael Arias released \"Tekkon Kinkreet\" in 2008, to international acclaim. After several years of directing primarily lower-key live-action films, Hideaki Anno formed his own production studio and revisited his still-popular \"Evangelion\" franchise with the \"Rebuild of Evangelion\" tetralogy, a new series of films providing an alternate retelling of the original story.\nSome Hollywood directors have turned to Tokyo as a backdrop for movies set in Japan. Post-war period examples include \"Tokyo Joe\" (1949), \"My Geisha\" (1962) and the James Bond film \"You Only Live Twice\" (1967). Recent examples include \"Lost in Translation\" (2003), \"The Last Samurai\" (2003), ' (2004), ' (2004), \"The Day After Tomorrow\" (2004), \"Memoirs of a Geisha\" (2005), ' (2006), \"Babel\" (2006), \"The Day the Earth Stood Still\" (2008), \"2012\" (2009), \"Inception\" (2010), \"Emperor\" (2012), \"Pacific Rim\" (2013), \"The Wolverine\" (2013), \"Geostorm\" (2017), and ' (2019).\nSince February 2000, the Japan Film Commission Promotion Council was established. On November 16, 2001, the Japanese Foundation for the Promotion of the Arts laws were presented to the House of Representatives. These laws were intended to promote the production of media arts, including film scenery, and stipulate that the government\u00a0\u2013 on both the national and local levels\u00a0\u2013 must lend aid in order to preserve film media. The laws were passed on November 30 and came into effect on December 7. In 2003, at a gathering for the Agency of Cultural Affairs, twelve policies were proposed in a written report to allow public-made films to be promoted and shown at the Film Center of the National Museum of Modern Art.\nJapanese cinema has always been perceived as either having feminist male directors as well as female directors, furthering the notion of the importance of women in Japanese cinema. This is proven most profusely in 2009, where a symposium for the Nippon Connection Festival was held, which the entire meeting was devoted to women: as a subject, as female directors, and as their importance to Japanese cinema. The impact of women is seen in various film festivals, including \u2018Peaches,\u2019 where Japanese women graduates were allowed to display their achievements in the cinematic field willingly. Through these interpretations and diverse views of males in cinema, women have a major impact on Japanese cinema, about politically and socially: they themselves are a part of the Japanese narrative and their stories need to be studied in films for audiences to fully grasp their stories.\nFour films have so far received international recognition by being selected to compete in major film festivals: \"Caterpillar\" by K\u014dji Wakamatsu was in competition for the Golden Bear at the 60th Berlin International Film Festival and won the Silver Bear for Best Actress, \"Outrage\" by Takeshi Kitano was In Competition for the Palme d'Or at the 2010 Cannes Film Festival, \"Himizu\" by Sion Sono was in competition for the Golden Lion at the 68th Venice International Film Festival.\nIn March 2011, Japanese film and television industry was afflicted by the Tohoku earthquake and tsunami and the subsequent Fukushima nuclear disaster, which was greatly suffered due to ongoing triple disaster. However, many Japanese studios were officially closed or reorganized to prevent the triple disaster. As of result, many of Japanese studios began to reopen and production rates have increased.\nIn October 2011 (after fully reopening of Japanese film and television industry), Takashi Miike's \"\" was In Competition for the Palme d'Or at the 2012 Cannes Film Festival, the first 3D film ever to screen In Competition at Cannes. The film was co-produced by British independent producer Jeremy Thomas, who had successfully broken Japanese titles such as Nagisa Oshima's \"Merry Christmas, Mr Lawrence\" and \" Taboo\", Takeshi Kitano's \"Brother\", and Miike's \"13 Assassins\" onto the international stage as producer.\nIn 2018, Hirokazu Kore-eda won the Palme d'Or for his movie \"Shoplifters\" at the 71st Cannes Film Festival, a festival that also featured Ry\u016bsuke Hamaguchi's \"Asako I &amp; II\" in competition.\nThe 2020 Japanese epic disaster drama film \"Fukushima 50\", released on March 6, 2020, directed by Setsur\u014d Wakamatsu and written by Y\u014dichi Maekawa. The film is based on the book by Ryusho Kadota, titled \"On the Brink: The Inside Story of Fukushima Daiichi\", and it is the first Japanese film to depict the disaster. \nIn early 2020, the Japanese media industry was afflicted by the COVID-19 pandemic, which greatly suffered due to health requirements. This gave the nation its worst day of film and television industry impacted by health crises since the end of World War II. From the first (of many) 'health lockdowns' until the end of September 2021, many Japanese studios were closed or reorganized to suit the legal requirements for spread prevention which ultimately resulted in the suspension of filming for many movies, however, it did not stop from people wanting to see movies. Despite this pandemic occurring, many films were slowly being reintroduced to Japanese cinemas, which changed how Japan would approach cinema within the following years. From 2021-2022, there was the reinstating of Japanese cinema to Japanese audiences, as theater attendance had increased from the original 54.5% from 2020, to about 78% by 2022. In 2022 alone, though there was a significant decrease from 2019\u2019s numbers, there were 590 movie theatres that were open and available to the public, allowing for the public to reengage with normal activities while being amid the pandemic. \nIn October 2020 (after the reopening film industry), a Japanese anime film ' based on the ' manga series broke all box-office records in the country, becoming the highest-grossing film of all time in Japan, the highest-grossing Japanese film of all time and the highest-grossing film of 2020.\nIn October 2021, a Japanese drama-road film \"Drive My Car\" won Best Foreign Language Film at the 79th Golden Globe Awards and received the Academy Award for Best International Feature Film at the 94th Academy Awards.\nIn May 2023, a Japanese drama film \"Perfect Days\" won Best Actor and Ecumenical Jury at the 76th Cannes Film Festival. Besides that a Japanese psychological dramatic mystery thriller film \"Monster\" won Best Screenplay as well as the Queer Palm at the same festival.\nIn September 2023, a Japanese drama mystery film \"Evil Does Not Exist\" won Grand Jury and FIPRESCI Award at the 80th Venice International Film Festival and also awarded Best Film at the 2023 BFI London Film Festival.\nHayao Miyazaki's \"The Boy and the Heron\" and Takashi Yamazaki's \"Godzilla Minus One\" (both released in 2023) each won an award at the 96th Academy Awards and garnered critical acclaim. \"The Boy and the Heron\" also won Best Animated Feature Film at the 81st Golden Globe Awards, the first non-English-language animated film to do so. Likewise, \"Godzilla Minus One\" became the first foreign-language film to win the Academy Award for Best Visual Effects.\nIn July 2025, a Japanese anime film ' based on the \"Infinity Castle\" arc of ' manga series broke all box-office records in the country, becoming the highest-grossing film of all time in Japan. It is a direct sequel to the of the as well as the manga fourth, fifth, and sixth adaptations, following the film ' (2020) and the feature-length compilations ' (2023) and \"\" (2024).\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

China is the home of the largest movie and drama production complex and film studios in the world, the Oriental Movie Metropolis and Hengdian World Studios. In 2012 the country became the second-largest market in the world by box office receipts behind only the United States. In 2016, the gross box office in China was CN\u00a5 (US$). China has also become a major hub of business for Hollywood studios.\nHistory.\nBeginnings.\nMotion pictures were introduced to China in 1896. They were introduced through foreign film exhibitors in treaty ports like Shanghai and Hong Kong.68\nChina was one of the earliest countries to be exposed to the medium of film, due to Louis Lumi\u00e8re sending his cameraman to Shanghai a year after inventing cinematography. The first recorded screening of a motion picture in China took place in Shanghai on 11 August 1896 as an \"act\" on a variety bill. The first Chinese film, a recording of the Peking opera, \"Dingjun Mountain\", was made in November 1905 in Beijing. For the next decade the production companies were mainly foreign-owned, and the domestic film industry was centered on Shanghai, a thriving entrepot and the largest city in the Far East.\nPre-revolutionary period.\nThe first domestically-produced Chinese films to achieve financial success came out in 1921, most notably Yan Ruisheng, leading to increased investment in the film industry. In the early 1920s, China saw the establishment of several new film studios, such as Zhang Shichuan's Mingxing Film Company, with most popular films being at least partially based around established western genres. Following the May Thirtieth Movement, Chinese films began moving towards depictions of Chinese culture. This trend was manifested through the rise of \"traditional costume films,\" including Romance of the Western Chamber, which dramatized classical stories, especially romances, and of the Wuxia genre. This tendency towards a more \"Chinese\" Cinema, as opposed to the earlier focus on westernization, was described as the campaign to \"revive national cinema\" (\u590d\u5174\u56fd\u7247) by figures like Lo Ming-yau.\nFrom the start of the 1930s to the outbreak in earnest of the Second Sino-Japanese War, Chinese cinema grew divided along political lines, primarily due to the ongoing Chinese Civil War and internal debates surrounding the invasion of Manchuria. After the Chinese government declared a ban on films related to the war with Japan, which were deemed \"provocative,\" the \"Left-Wing Film Movement,\" which had been founded by Communist-aligned literary circles, began to grow. While opposition to Japanese imperialism, as opposed to communist ideology, acted as the catalyst for the Left-Wing movement, most films of the movement emphasized class struggle over anti-imperialism. Supporters of leftist films included many established figures in the industry, such as Zheng Zhengqiu. Left-Wing film criticism promoted realism and didacticism, with the value of film seen as tied to its ability to reflect reality and spur political action. Consequentially, most Left-Wing movement films were heavily narrative-focused, and edited in the continuity style. Films associated with the Left-Wing movement include \"The Goddess\", \"Song of the Fishermen\", \"Crossroads\", and \"Spring Silkworms\".\nActing in opposition to the leftist movement was the \"soft film\" movement propagated by Liu Na-ou. Soft film was influenced by modernism, promoting an emphasis on camerawork and editing over the more narrative-focused films of the left, with the Kino-Eye technique of Dziga Vertov frequently referenced. Critics of soft film argued that prioritizing aesthetics over ideology was wrong in a moment of political crisis.\nMain melody dramas.\nDuring the late 20th century, a period when socialist dramas were beginning to lose viewership, the Chinese government began to involve itself deeper into the world of popular culture and cinema by creating the official genre of the \"main melody\" (\u4e3b\u65cb\u5f8b \"zh\u01d4xu\u00e1nl\u01dc\"), inspired by Hollywood's strides in musical dramas. In 1987, the Ministry of Radio, Film and Television issued a statement encouraging the making of movies which emphasizes the main melody to \"invigorate national spirit and national pride\". The expression \"main melody\" refers to the musical term \"leitmotif\", which translates to the 'theme of our times', which scholars suggest is representative of China's socio-political climate and cultural context of popular cinema. These main melody films, still produced regularly in modern times, try to emulate the commercial mainstream by the use of Hollywood-style music and special effects. A significant feature of these films is the incorporation of a \"red song\", which is a song written as propaganda to support the People's Republic of China. By revolving the film around the motif of a red song, the film is able to gain traction at the box office as songs are generally thought to be more accessible than a film. Theoretically, once the red song dominates the charts, it will stir interest in the film that which it accompanies.\nMain melody dramas are often subsidized by the state and have free access to government and military personnel. The Chinese government spends between \"one and two million RMBs\" annually to support the production of films in the main melody genre. August First Film Studio, the film and TV production arm of the People's Liberation Army, is a studio that produces main melody cinema. Main melody films, which often depict past military engagements or are biopics of first-generation CCP leaders, have won several Best Picture prizes at the Golden Rooster Awards. Some of the more famous main melody dramas include the ten-hour epic \"Decisive Engagement\" (\u5927\u51b3\u6218, 1991), directed by Cai Jiawei, Yang Guangyuan and Wei Lian; \"The Opium War\" (1997), directed by Xie Jin; and \"The Founding of a Republic\" (2009), directed by Han Sanping and Fifth Generation director Huang Jianxin. \"The Founding of an Army\" (2017) was commissioned by the government to celebrate the 90th anniversary of the People's Liberation Army, and is the third instalment in The Founding of a Republic series. The film featured many young Chinese pop singers that are already well-established in the industry, including Li Yifeng, Liu Haoran, and Lay Zhang, so as to further the film's reputation as a main melody drama.\nThe sixth generation.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\nWhen faced with the complexity of real society, their hands and feet quiver, and they deliriously shoot a bunch of childish fairy tales\n \u2014 The sixth generation director Jia Zhangke's accusation of China's older filmmakers in an essay.\nThe post-1990 era has been labeled the \"return of the amateur filmmaker\" as state censorship policies after the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests produced an edgy underground film movement loosely referred to as the Sixth Generation. Owing to the lack of state funding and backing, these films were shot quickly and cheaply, using materials like 16 mm film and digital video and mostly non-professional actors and actresses, producing a documentary feel, often with long takes, hand-held cameras, and ambient sound; more akin to Italian neorealism and cin\u00e9ma v\u00e9rit\u00e9 than the often lush, far more considered productions of the Fifth Generation. Unlike the Fifth Generation, the Sixth Generation brings a more individualistic, anti-romantic life-view and pays far closer attention to contemporary urban life, especially as affected by disorientation, rebellion and dissatisfaction with China's contemporary social marketing economic tensions and comprehensive cultural background. Many were made with an extremely low budget (an example is Jia Zhangke, who shoots on digital video, and formerly on 16\u00a0mm; Wang Xiaoshuai's \"The Days\" (1993) was made for US$10,000). The title and subjects of many of these films reflect the Sixth Generation's concerns. The Sixth Generation takes an interest in marginalized individuals and the less represented fringes of society. For example, Zhang Yuan's hand-held \"Beijing Bastards\" (1993) focuses on youth punk subculture, featuring artists like Cui Jian, Dou Wei and He Yong frowned upon by many state authorities, while Jia Zhangke's debut film \"Xiao Wu\" (1997) concerns a provincial pickpocket. While many Fifth Generation filmmakers have become darlings of mainstream Chinese culture, Sixth Generation filmmakers have often experienced harsh treatment by the state's censorship and regulatory system, despite their success at international film festivals and arthouse markets.\nAs the Sixth Generation gained international exposure, many subsequent movies were joint ventures and projects with international backers, but remained quite resolutely low-key and low budget. Jia's \"Platform\" (2000) was funded in part by Takeshi Kitano's production house, while his \"Still Life\" was shot on HD video. \"Still Life\" was a surprise addition and Golden Lion winner of the 2006 Venice International Film Festival. \"Still Life\", which concerns provincial workers around the Three Gorges region, sharply contrasts with the works of Fifth Generation Chinese directors like Zhang Yimou and Chen Kaige who were at the time producing \"House of Flying Daggers\" (2004) and \"The Promise\" (2005). It featured no star of international renown and was acted mostly by non-professionals.\nMany Sixth Generation films have highlighted the negative attributes of China's entry into the modern capitalist market. Li Yang's \"Blind Shaft\" (2003) for example, is an account of two murderous con-men in the unregulated and notoriously dangerous mining industry of northern China. (Li refused the tag of Sixth Generation, although admitted he was not Fifth Generation). While Jia Zhangke's \"The World\" (2004) emphasizes the emptiness of globalization in the backdrop of an internationally themed amusement park.\nSome of the more prolific Sixth Generation directors to have emerged are Wang Xiaoshuai (\"The Days\", \"Beijing Bicycle\", \"So Long, My Son\"), Zhang Yuan (\"Beijing Bastards\", \"East Palace West Palace\"), Jia Zhangke (\"Xiao Wu\", \"Unknown Pleasures\", \"Platform\", \"The World\", \"A Touch of Sin\", \"Mountains May Depart\", \"Ash Is Purest White\"), He Jianjun (\"Postman\") and Lou Ye (\"Suzhou River\", \"Summer Palace\"). One director of their generation who does not share most of the concerns of the Sixth Generation is Lu Chuan (\"\", 2004; \"City of Life and Death\", 2010).\nNotable Sixth Generation directors.\nIn the 2018 Cannes Film Festival, two of China's Sixth generation filmmakers, Jia Zhangke and Zhang Ming \u2013 whose grim works transformed Chinese cinema in the 1990s \u2013 showed on the French Riviera. While both directors represent Chinese cinema, their profiles are quite different. The 49-year-old Jia set up the Pingyao International Film Festival in 2017 and on the other hand is Zhang, a 56-year-old film school professor who spent years working on government commissions and domestic TV shows after struggling with his own projects. Despite their different profiles, they mark an important cornerstone in Chinese cinema and are both credited with bringing Chinese movies to the international big screen. Chinese director Jia Zhangke's latest film \"Ash Is Purest White\" has been selected to compete in the official competition for the Palme d'Or of the 71st Cannes Film Festival, the highest prize awarded at the film festival. It is Jia's fifth movie, a gangster revenge drama that is his most expensive and mainstream film to date. Back in 2013, Jia won Best Screenplay Award for \"A Touch of Sin\", following nominations for \"Unknown Pleasures\" in 2002 and \"24 City\" in 2008. In 2014, he was a member of the official jury and the following year his film \"Mountains May Depart\" was nominated. According to entertainment website https://, a record number of Chinese films were submitted this year but only Jia's romantic drama was selected to compete for the Palme d'Or. Meanwhile, Zhang will make his debut at Cannes with \"The Pluto Moment\", a slow-moving relationship drama about a team of filmmakers scouting for locations and musical talent in China's rural hinterland. The film is Zhang's highest profile production so far, as it stars actor Wang Xuebing in the leading role. The film was partly financed by iQiyi, the company behind one of China's most popular online video browsing sharing sites. Diao Yinan is also a notable member of the sixth generation whose works include \"Black Coal Thin Ice\", \"Wild Goose Lake\", \"Night Train\" and \"Uniform\" which have premiered at festivals such as Cannes and received acclaim abroad.\nOther directors.\nHe Ping is a director of mostly Western-like films set in Chinese locale. His \"Swordsmen in Double Flag Town\" (1991) and \"Sun Valley\" (1995) explore narratives set in the sparse terrain of West China near the Gobi Desert. His historical drama \"Red Firecracker, Green Firecracker\" (1994) won a myriad of prizes home and abroad.\nRecent cinema has seen Chinese cinematographers direct some acclaimed films. Other than Zhang Yimou, L\u00fc Yue made \"Mr. Zhao\" (1998), a black comedy film well received abroad. Gu Changwei's minimalist epic \"Peacock\" (2005), about a quiet, ordinary Chinese family with three very different siblings in the post-Cultural Revolution era, took home the Silver Bear prize for 2005 Berlin International Film Festival. Hou Yong is another cinematographer who made films (\"Jasmine Women\", 2004) and TV series. There are actors who straddle the dual roles of acting and directing. Xu Jinglei, a popular Chinese actress, has made six movies to date. Her second film \"Letter from an Unknown Woman\" (2004) landed her the San Sebasti\u00e1n International Film Festival Best Director award. Another popular actress and director is Zhao Wei, whose directorial debut \"So Young\" (2013) was a huge box office and critical success.\nThe most highly regarded Chinese actor-director is undoubtedly Jiang Wen, who has directed several critically acclaimed movies while following on his acting career. His directorial debut, \"In the Heat of the Sun\" (1994) was the first PRC film to win Best Picture at the Golden Horse Film Awards held in Taiwan. His other films, like \"Devils on the Doorstep\" (2000, Cannes Grand Prix) and \"Let the Bullets Fly\" (2010), were similarly well received. By the early 2011, \"Let the Bullets Fly\" had become the highest grossing domestic film in China's history.\nGeneration-independent movement.\nThere is a growing number of independent seventh or post-Sixth Generation filmmakers making films with extremely low budgets and using digital equipment. They are the so-called dGeneration (for digital). These films, like those from Sixth Generation filmmakers, are mostly made outside the Chinese film system and are shown mostly on the international film festival circuit. Ying Liang and Jian Yi are two of these generation filmmakers. Ying's \"Taking Father Home\" (2005) and \"The Other Half\" (2006) are both representative of the generation trends of the feature film. Liu Jiayin made two dGeneration feature films, \"Oxhide\" (2004) and \"Oxhide II\" (2010), blurring the line between documentary and narrative film. \"Oxhide\", made by Liu when she was a film student, frames herself and her parents in their claustrophobic Beijing apartment in a narrative praised by critics. \"An Elephant Sitting Still\", considered one of the greatest film debuts in Chinese cinema, is also the only film by the late Hu Bo.\nNew documentary movement.\nTwo decades of reform and commercialization have brought dramatic social changes in mainland China, reflected not only in fiction film but in a growing documentary movement. Wu Wenguang's 70-minute \"\" (1990) is now seen as one of the first works of this \"New Documentary Movement\" (NDM) in China. \"Bumming\", made between 1988 and 1990, contains interviews with five young artists eking out a living in Beijing, subject to state authorized tasks. Shot using a camcorder, the documentary ends with four of the artists moving abroad after the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests and massacre. \"Dance with the Farm Workers\" (2001) is another documentary by Wu.\nAnother internationally acclaimed documentary is Wang Bing's nine-hour tale of deindustrialization \"\" (2003). Wang's subsequent documentaries, \"He Fengming\" (2007), \"Crude Oil\" (2008), \"Man with no name\" (2009), \"Three Sisters\" (2012) and \"Feng ai\" (2013), cemented his reputation as a leading documentarist of the movement.\nLi Hong, the first woman in the NDM, in \"Out of Phoenix Bridge\" (1997) relates the story of four young women, who moving from rural areas to the big cities like millions of other men and women, have come to Beijing to make a living.\nThe New Documentary Movement in recent times has overlapped with the dGeneration filmmaking, with most documentaries being shot cheaply and independently in the digital format. Xu Xin's \"Karamay\" (2010), Zhao Liang's \"Behemoth\", Huang Weikai's \"Disorder\" (2009), Zhao Dayong's \"Ghost Town\" (2009), Du Haibing's \"1428\" (2009), Xu Tong's \"Fortune Teller\" (2009) and Li Ning's \"Tape\" (2010) were all shot in digital format. All had made their impact in the international documentary scene and the use of digital format allows for works of vaster lengths.\nAnimation.\nBefore the 1950s.\nInspired by the success of Disney animation, the self-taught pioneers Wan brothers, Wan Laiming and Wan Guchan, made the first Chinese animated short in the 1920s, thus inaugurating the history of Chinese animation. (Chen Yuanyuan 175) Many live-action films of the Republican era also included animated sequences.\nIn 1937, the Wan brothers decided to produce \u300a\u94c1\u6247\u516c\u4e3b\u300b\" Princess Iron Fan\", which was the first Chinese animated feature film and the fourth, after the American feature films \"Snow White\", \"Gulliver's Travels\", and \"The Adventures of Pinocchio\". It was at this time that Chinese animation as an art form had risen to prominence on the world stage. Completed in 1941, the film was released under China United Pictures and aroused a great response in Asia. Japanese animator Osamu Tezuka once said that he gave up medicine after watching the cartoon and decided to pursue animation.\n1950s\u20131980s.\nDuring this golden era, Chinese animation had developed a variety of styles, including ink animation, shadow play animation, puppet animation, and so on. Some of the most representative works are \u300a\u5927\u95f9\u5929\u5bab\u300b\" Havoc in Heaven\", \u300a\u54ea\u5412\u95f9\u6d77\u300b \"Nezha's Rebellion in the Sea\" and\u300a\u5929\u4e66\u5947\u8c08\u300b \"Heavenly Book\", which have also won lofty praise and numerous awards in the world.\n1980s\u20131990s.\nAfter Deng Xiaoping's Reform Period and the \"opening up\" of China, the movies\u300a\u846b\u82a6\u5144\u5f1f\u300b \"Calabash Brothers\", \u300a\u9ed1\u732b\u8b66\u957f\u300b\"Black Cat Sheriff\", \u300a\u963f\u51e1\u63d0\u300b\"Avanti Story\" and other impressive animated movies were released. However, at this time, China still favored the Japanese's more unique, American and European-influenced animated works over the less-advanced domestic ones.\n1990s\u20132010s.\nIn the 1990s, digital production methods replaced manual hand-drawing methods; however, even with the use of advanced technology, none of the animated works were considered to be a breakthrough film. Animated films that tried to cater to all age groups, such as \"Lotus Lantern\" and \"Storm Resolution\", did not attract much attention. The only animated works that seemed to achieve popularity were the ones for catered for children, such as \"Pleasant Goat and Big Big Wolf\"\u300a\u559c\u7f8a\u7f8a\u4e0e\u7070\u592a\u72fc\u300b.\n2010s\u2013present.\nDuring this period, the technical level of Chinese domestic animation production has been established comprehensively, and 3D animation films have become the mainstream. However, as more and more foreign films (such as ones from Japan, Europe, and the United States) are being imported into China, Chinese animated works is left in the shadows of these animated foreign films.\nIt was only with the release of \u300a\u897f\u6e38\u8bb0\u4e4b\u5927\u5723\u5f52\u6765\u300b\"\" in 2015, a computer-animated film, that Chinese animated works took back the rein. The film was a huge hit and broke the record for Chinese domestic animated movies with CN\u00a5956 million at China's box office. After the success of \"Journey to the West\", several other high-quality animated films were released, such as\u300a\u5927\u9c7c\u6d77\u68e0\u300b \"Big Fish and Begonia\" and \u300a\u767d\u86c7\u7f18\u8d77\u300b \"White Snake\". Though none of these movies made headway in regards to the box office, they did make filmmakers more and more interested in animated works.\nThis all changed with the breakthrough animated film, \u300a\u54ea\u5412\u4e4b\u9b54\u7ae5\u964d\u4e16\u300b\"Ne Zha\". Released in 2019, it became the second highest-grossing film of all time in China, the highest-grossing animated non-English film, and the highest-grossing animated film in a single territory. It was with this film that Chinese animated films, as a medium, finally broke the notion in China that domestic animated films are only for children. With \"Nezha\", and a spinoff, \"Jiang Ziya\", Chinese animation has now come to be known as a veritable source of entertainment for all ages.\nNew models and the new Chinese cinema.\nCommercial successes.\nWith China's liberalization in the late 1970s and its opening up to foreign markets, commercial considerations have made its impact in post-1980s filmmaking. Traditionally arthouse movies screened seldom make enough to break even. An example is Fifth Generation director Tian Zhuangzhuang's \"The Horse Thief\" (1986), a narrative film with minimal dialog on a Tibetan horse thief. The film, showcasing exotic landscapes, was well received by Chinese and some Western arthouse audiences, but did poorly at the box office. Tian's later \"The Warrior and the Wolf\" (2010) was a similar commercial failure.\nPrior to these, there were examples of successful commercial films in the post-liberalization period. One was the romance film \"Romance on the Lu Mountain\" (1980), which was a success with older Chinese. The film broke the Guinness Book of Records as the longest-running film on a first run. Jet Li's cinematic debut \"Shaolin Temple\" (1982) was an instant hit at home and abroad (in Japan and the Southeast Asia, for example). Another successful commercial film was \"Murder in 405\u200a\" (405\u8c0b\u6740\u6848, 1980), a murder thriller. Feng Xiaogang's \"The Dream Factory\" (1997) was heralded as a turning point in Chinese movie industry, a \"hesui pian\" (Chinese New Year-screened film) which demonstrated the viability of the commercial model in China's socialist market economy. Feng has become one of the most successful commercial director in the post-1997 era. Almost all his films made high returns domestically while he used ethnic Chinese co-stars like Rosamund Kwan, Jacqueline Wu, Rene Liu and Shu Qi to boost his films' appeal. In the decade following 2010, owing to the influx of Hollywood films (though the number screened each year is curtailed), Chinese domestic cinema faces mounting challenges. The industry is growing and domestic films are starting to achieve the box office impact of major Hollywood blockbusters. However, not all domestic films are successful financially. In January 2010 James Cameron's \"Avatar\" was pulled out from non-3D theaters for Hu Mei's biopic \"Confucius\", but this move led to a backlash on Hu's film. Zhang Yang's 2005 \"Sunflower\" also made little money, but his earlier, low-budget \"Spicy Love Soup\" (1997) grossed ten times its budget of \u00a53 million. Likewise, the 2006 \"Crazy Stone\", a sleeper hit, was made for just 3 million HKD/US$400,000. In 2009\u201311, Feng's \"Aftershock\" (2009) and Jiang Wen's \"Let the Bullets Fly\" (2010) became China's highest grossing domestic films, with \"Aftershock\" earning \u00a5670 million (US$105 million) and \"Let the Bullets Fly\" \u00a5674 million (US$110 million). \"Lost in Thailand\" (2012) became the first Chinese film to reach \u00a51 billion at the Chinese box office and \"Monster Hunt\" (2015) became the first to reach CN\u00a5.\nAs of 2021, 9 of the top 10 highest-grossing films in China are domestic productions. On 8 February 2016, the Chinese box office set a new single-day gross record, with CN\u00a5, beating the previous record of CN\u00a5 on 18 July 2015. Also in February 2016, \"The Mermaid\", directed by Stephen Chow, became the highest-grossing film in China, overtaking \"Monster Hunt\". It is also the first film to reach CN\u00a5.\nUnder the influence of Hollywood science fiction movies like \"Prometheus\", published on 8 June 2012, such genres especially the space science films have risen rapidly in the Chinese film market in recent years. On 5 February 2019, the film \"The Wandering Earth\" directed by Frant Gwo reached $699.8 million worldwide, which became the third highest-grossing film in the history of Chinese cinema.\nChinese international cinema and successes abroad.\nSince the late 1980s and progressively in the 2000s, Chinese films have enjoyed considerable box office success abroad. Formerly viewed only by cineastes, its global appeal mounted after the international box office and critical success of Ang Lee's period wuxia film \"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon\" which won Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film in 2000. This multi-national production increased its appeal by featuring stars from all parts of the Chinese-speaking world. It provided an introduction to Chinese cinema (and especially the wuxia genre) for many and increased the popularity of many earlier Chinese films. To date \"Crouching Tiger\" remains the most commercially successful foreign-language film in U.S. history.\nIn 2002, Zhang Yimou's \"Hero\" was another international box office success. Its cast featured famous actors from mainland China and Hong Kong who were also known to some extent in the West, including Jet Li, Zhang Ziyi, Maggie Cheung and Tony Leung Chiu-Wai. Despite criticisms by some that these two films pander somewhat to Western tastes, \"Hero\" was a phenomenal success in most of Asia and topped the U.S. box office for two weeks, making enough in the U.S. alone to cover the production costs.\nOther films such as \"Farewell My Concubine\", \"2046\", \"Suzhou River\", \"The Road Home\" and \"House of Flying Daggers\" were critically acclaimed around the world. The Hengdian World Studios can be seen as the \"Chinese Hollywood\", with a total area of up to 330 ha. and 13 shooting bases, including a 1:1 copy of the Forbidden City.\nThe successes of \"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon\" and \"Hero\" make it difficult to demarcate the boundary between \"Mainland Chinese\" cinema and a more international-based \"Chinese-language cinema\". \"Crouching Tiger\", for example, was directed by a Taiwan-born American director (Ang Lee) who works often in Hollywood. Its pan-Chinese leads include mainland Chinese (Zhang Ziyi), Hong Kong (Chow Yun-Fat), Taiwan (Chang Chen) and Malaysian (Michelle Yeoh) actors and actresses; the film was co-produced by an array of Chinese, American, Hong Kong, and Taiwan film companies. Likewise, Lee's Chinese-language \"Lust, Caution\" (2007) drew a crew and cast from mainland China, Hong Kong and Taiwan, and includes an orchestral score by French composer Alexandre Desplat. This merging of people, resources and expertise from the three regions and the broader East Asia and the world, marks the movement of Chinese-language cinema into a domain of large scale international influence. Other examples of films in this mold include \"The Promise\" (2005), \"The Banquet\" (2006), \"Fearless\" (2006), \"The Warlords\" (2007), \"Bodyguards and Assassins\" (2009) and \"Red Cliff\" (2008\u201309). The ease with which ethnic Chinese actresses and actors straddle the mainland and Hong Kong has significantly increased the number of co-productions in Chinese-language cinema. Many of these films also feature South Korean or Japanese actors to appeal to their East Asian neighbours. Some artistes originating from the mainland, like Hu Jun, Zhang Ziyi, Tang Wei and Zhou Xun, obtained Hong Kong residency under the Quality Migrant Admission Scheme and have acted in many Hong Kong productions.\nIndustry.\nBox office and screens.\nIn 1983, there were 162,000 projection units in China, up from less than 600 at the 1949 founding of the PRC.1\nIn 1998, the Ministry of Culture revived the practice of mobile rural cinema as part of its 2131 Project which aimed to screen one movie per month per village in rural China and upgrade analog equipment to digital projectors.246 In 2003, the central government provided more than 400 film projection vans to Tibet and Xinjiang to show films in an effort to oppose what the government viewed as separatism and Westernization.249\nIn 2010, Chinese cinema was the third largest film industry by number of feature films produced annually. In 2013, China's gross box office was \u00a521.8 billion (US$3.6 billion), the second-largest film market in the world by box office receipts. In January 2013, \"Lost in Thailand\" (2012) became the first Chinese film to reach \u00a51 billion at the box office. As of May 2013, 7 of the top 10 highest-grossing films in China were domestic productions. As of 2014, around half of all tickets are sold online, with the largest ticket selling sites being Maoyan.com (82 million), Gewara.com (45 million) and Wepiao.com (28 million). In 2014, Chinese films earned \u00a51.87 billion outside China. By December 2013 there were 17,000 screens in the country. By 6 January 2014, there were 18,195 screens in the country. Greater China has around 251 IMAX theaters. There were 299 cinema chains (252 rural, 47 urban), 5,813 movie theaters and 24,317 screens in the country in 2014.\nThe country added about 8,035 screens in 2015 (at an average of 22 new screens per day, increasing its total by about 40% to around 31,627 screens, which is about 7,373 shy of the number of screens in the United States. Chinese films accounted for 61.48% of ticket sales in 2015 (up from 54% last year) with more than 60% of ticket sales being made online. Average ticket price was down about 2.5% to $5.36 in 2015. In 2015, there was 48.7% increase in the box office, with the country's population of 1.35 billion going to the movies an average of 0.8 times that year. Chinese films grossed US$ overseas in 2015. During the week of the 2016 Chinese New Year, the country set a new record for the highest box office gross during one week in one territory with US$, overtaking the previous record of US$ of 26 December 2015 to 1 January 2016 in the United States and Canada. Chinese films grossed CN\u00a5 (US$) in foreign markets in 2016.\nIn 2020, China's market for films surpassed the U.S. market to become the largest such market in the world.16\nSince the early 2020s, Chinese cinema has faced growing competition from duanju (short vertical dramas). In 2024, industry reports indicated that the duanju market surpassed the national film box office for the first time, generating over 50 billion yuan compared to 47 billion for traditional cinema. This shift reflects evolving viewing habits, especially among younger audiences.\nFilm companies.\nAs of April 2015, the largest Chinese film company by worth was Alibaba Pictures (US$8.77 billion). Other large companies include Huayi Brothers Media (US$7.9 billion), Enlight Media (US$5.98 billion) and Bona Film Group (US$542 million). The biggest distributors by market share in 2014 were: China Film Group (32.8%), Huaxia Film (22.89%), Enlight Pictures (7.75%), Bona Film Group (5.99%), Wanda Media (5.2%), Le Vision Pictures (4.1%), Huayi Brothers (2.26%), United Exhibitor Partners (2%), Heng Ye Film Distribution (1.77%) and Beijing Anshi Yingna Entertainment (1.52%). The biggest cinema chains in 2014 by box office gross were: Wanda Cinema Line (US$), China Film Stellar (393.35 million), Dadi Theater Circuit (378.17 million), Shanghai United Circuit (355.07 million), Guangzhou Jinyi Zhujiang (335.39 million), China Film South Cinema Circuit (318.71 million), Zhejiang Time Cinema (190.53 million), China Film Group Digital Cinema Line (177.42 million), Hengdian Cinema Line (170.15 million) and Beijing New Film Association (163.09 million).\nNotable independent (non-state-owned) film companies.\nHuayi Brothers is China's most powerful independent (i.e., non state-owned) entertainment company, Beijing-based Huayi Brothers is a diversified company engaged in film and TV production, distribution, theatrical exhibition, as well as talent management. Notable films include 2004's \"Kung Fu Hustle\"; and 2010's \"Aftershock\", which had a 91% rating on Rotten Tomatoes.\nBeijing Enlight Media focuses on the action and romance genres. Enlight usually places several films in China's top 20 grossers. Enlight is also a major player in China's TV series production and distribution businesses. Under the leadership of its CEO Wang Changtian, the publicly traded, Beijing-based company has achieved a market capitalization of nearly US$1 billion.\nLaw.\nIn November 2016, China passed a film law banning content deemed harmful to the \"dignity, honor and interests\" of the People's Republic and encouraging the promotion of core socialist values, approved by the National People's Congress Standing Committee. Since 2017, the industry is regulated by the Film Industry Promotion Act.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The oldest known surviving film in the world, \"Roundhay Garden Scene\" (1888), was shot in England by French inventor Louis Le Prince. Early colour films were also pioneered in the UK. Film production reached an all-time high in 1936, but the \"golden age\" of British cinema is usually thought to have occurred in the 1940s, which saw the release of the most critically acclaimed works by filmmakers such as David Lean, Michael Powell, and Carol Reed.\nMany British actors have accrued critical success and worldwide recognition, including Alec Guinness, Patrick Stewart, Julie Andrews, Michael Caine, Joan Collins, Sean Connery, Olivia Colman, Benedict Cumberbatch, Daniel Craig, Daniel Day-Lewis, Judi Dench, Helen Mirren, Olivia de Havilland, Audrey Hepburn, Anthony Hopkins, Glynis Johns, Vivien Leigh, Ian Mckellen, Peter O'Toole, Gary Oldman, Laurence Olivier, John Gielgud, Maggie Smith, Joan Plowright, Emma Thompson, Rachel Weisz, Kate Winslet and Keira Knightley. Some of the films with the largest ever box office profits have been made in the United Kingdom, including \"Harry Potter\" and \"James Bond\", the fourth and fifth highest-grossing film franchises of all time.\nThe identity of British cinema, particularly in relation to the cinema of the United States, has been the subject of various debates over the years. Its history includes competition as well as collaboration with the United States cinema in production of a huge number of film projects. British filmmakers such as Alfred Hitchcock, Christopher Nolan, and Ridley Scott achieved success combining their work with the United States filmmakers as well, as did British performers such as Charlie Chaplin and Cary Grant.\nIn 2009, British films grossed around $2\u00a0billion worldwide and achieved a market share of around 7% globally and 17% in the United Kingdom. UK box office earnings totalled \u00a31.1\u00a0billion in 2012, with 172.5\u00a0million admissions. The British Film Institute has produced a poll ranking what it considers to be the 100 greatest British films of all time. The annual BAFTA Awards hosted by the British Academy of Film and Television Arts are considered to be the British equivalent of the Academy Awards.\nHistory.\nOrigins and silent films.\nThe world's first moving picture was shot in Leeds by Louis Le Prince in 1888 and the first moving pictures developed on celluloid film were made in Hyde Park, London in 1889 by British inventor William Friese Greene, who patented the process in 1890.\nThe first people to build and run a working 35 mm camera in Britain were Robert W. Paul and Birt Acres. They made the first British film \"Incident at Clovelly Cottage\" in February 1895, shortly before falling out over the camera's patent. Soon several British film companies had opened to meet the demand for new films, such as Mitchell and Kenyon in Blackburn. The Lumi\u00e8re brothers first brought their show to London in 1896. In 1898, American producer Charles Urban expanded the London-based Warwick Trading Company to produce British films, mostly documentary and news.\nAlthough the earliest British films were of everyday events, the early 20th century saw the appearance of narrative shorts, mainly comedies and melodramas. The early films were often melodramatic in tone, and there was a distinct preference for story lines already known to the audience, in particular, adaptations of Shakespeare plays and Dickens novels.\nIn 1898, Gaumont-British Picture Corp. was founded as a subsidiary of the French Gaumont Film Company, constructing Lime Grove Studios in West London in 1915 in the first building built in Britain solely for film production. Also in 1898, Hepworth Studios was founded in Lambeth, South London by Cecil Hepworth, the Bamforths began producing films in Yorkshire, and William Haggar began producing films in Wales.\nDirected by Walter R. Booth in 1901, \"Scrooge, or, Marley's Ghost\" is the earliest film adaptation of Charles Dickens's festive novella \"A Christmas Carol\". Booth's \"The Hand of the Artist\" (1906) has been described as the first British animated film.\nIn 1902, Ealing Studios was founded by Will Barker. It has become the oldest continuously operating film studio in the world.\nIn 1902, the earliest colour film in the world was made; capturing everyday events. In 2012, it was found by the National Science and Media Museum in Bradford after lying forgotten in an old tin for 110 years. The previous title for earliest colour film, using Urban's inferior Kinemacolor process, was thought to date from 1909. The re-discovered films were made by pioneer Edward Raymond Turner from London who patented his process on 22 March 1899.\nIn 1909, Urban formed the Natural Color Kinematograph Company, which produced early colour films using his patented Kinemacolor process. This was later challenged in court by Greene, causing the company to go out of business in 1914.\nIn 1903, Cecil Hepworth and Percy Stow directed \"Alice in Wonderland\", the first film adaptation of Lewis Carroll's children's book \"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland\". Also in 1903, Frank Mottershaw of Sheffield produced the film \"A Daring Daylight Robbery\", which launched the chase genre.\nIn 1911, the Ideal Film Company was founded in Soho, London, distributing almost 400 films by 1934, and producing 80.\nIn 1913, stage director Maurice Elvey began directing British films, becoming Britain's most prolific film director, with almost 200 by 1957.\nIn 1914, Elstree Studios was founded, and acquired in 1928 by German-born Ludwig Blattner, who invented a magnetic steel tape recording system that was adopted by the BBC in 1930.\nIn 1915, the Kinematograph Renters\u2019 Society of Great Britain and Ireland was formed to represent the film distribution companies. It is the oldest film trade body in the world. It was known as the Society of Film Distributors until it changed its name again to the Film Distributors\u2019 Association (FDA).\nDuring the 1918-1920 Spanish Influenza pandemic, cinema was seen as a way to take ameliorative action, causing many health professionals to see cinema as one of the primary ways the flu spread, as there was an absence of ventilation in the cinemas. There was an outcry to \"Shut the Kinemas,\" and uneven, localized restrictions were put in place, primarily focusing on children and servicemen, including barring them from the theatre outright or requiring a 2.5 hour break each day.\nIn 1920, Gaumont opened Islington Studios, where Alfred Hitchcock got his start, selling out to Gainsborough Pictures in 1927. Also in 1920 Cricklewood Studios was founded by Sir Oswald Stoll, becoming Britain's largest film studio, known for Fu Manchu and Sherlock Holmes film series.\nIn 1920, the short-lived company Minerva Films was founded in London by the actor Leslie Howard (also producer and director) and his friend and story editor Adrian Brunel. Some of their early films include four written by A. A. Milne including \"The Bump\", starring C. Aubrey Smith; \"Twice Two\"; \"Five Pound Reward\"; and \"Bookworms\".\nBy the mid-1920s the British film industry was losing out to heavy competition from the United States, which was helped by its much larger home market \u2013 in 1914 25% of films shown in the UK were British, but by 1926 this had fallen to 5%. A slump in 1924 caused many British film studios to close, resulting in the passage of the Cinematograph Films Act 1927 to boost local production, requiring that cinemas show a certain percentage of British films. The act was technically a success, with audiences for British films becoming larger than the quota required, but it had the effect of creating a market for poor quality, low cost films, made to satisfy the quota. The \"quota quickies\", as they became known, are often blamed by historians for holding back the development of the industry. However, some British film makers, such as Michael Powell, learnt their craft making such films. The act was modified with the Cinematograph Films Act 1938 assisted the British film industry by specifying only films made by and shot in Great Britain would be included in the quota, an act that severely reduced Canadian and Australian film production.\nThe biggest star of the silent era, English comedian Charlie Chaplin, was Hollywood-based.\nThe early sound period.\nScottish solicitor John Maxwell founded British International Pictures (BIP) in 1927. Based at the former British National Pictures Studios in Elstree, the facilities original owners, including producer-director Herbert Wilcox, had run into financial difficulties. One of the company's early films, Alfred Hitchcock's \"Blackmail\" (1929), is often regarded as the first British sound feature. It was a part-talkie with a synchronised score and sound effects. Earlier in 1929, the first all-talking British feature, \"The Clue of the New Pin\" was released. It was based on a novel by Edgar Wallace, starring Donald Calthrop, Benita Home and Fred Raines, which was made by British Lion at their Beaconsfield Studios. John Maxwell's BIP became the Associated British Picture Corporation (ABPC) in 1933. ABPC's studios in Elstree came to be known as the \"porridge factory\", according to Lou Alexander, \"for reasons more likely to do with the quantity of films that the company turned out, than their quality\". Elstree (strictly speaking almost all the studios were in neighbouring Borehamwood) became the centre of the British film industry, with six film complexes over the years all in close proximity to each other.\nBy 1927, the largest cinema chains in the United Kingdom consisted of around 20 cinemas but the following year Gaumont-British expanded significantly to become the largest, controlling 180 cinemas by 1928 and up to 300 by 1929. Maxwell formed ABC Cinemas in 1927 which became a subsidiary of BIP and went on to become one of the largest in the country, together with Odeon Cinemas, founded by Oscar Deutsch, who opened his first cinema in 1928. By 1937, these three chains controlled almost a quarter of all cinemas in the country. A booking by one of these chains was indispensable for the success of any British film.\nWith the advent of sound films, many foreign actors were in less demand, with English received pronunciation commonly used; for example, the voice of Czech actress Anny Ondra in \"Blackmail\" was substituted by an off-camera Joan Barry during Ondra's scenes.\nStarting with John Grierson's \"Drifters\" (also 1929), the period saw the emergence of the school of realist Documentary Film Movement, from 1933 associated with the GPO Film Unit. It was Grierson who coined the term \"documentary\" to describe a non-fiction film, and he produced the movement's most celebrated early films, \"Night Mail\" (1936), written and directed by Basil Wright and Harry Watt, and incorporating the poem by W. H. Auden towards the end of the short.\nMusic halls also proved influential in comedy films of this period, and a number of popular personalities emerged, including George Formby, Gracie Fields, Jessie Matthews and Will Hay. These stars often made several films a year, and their productions remained important for morale purposes during World War II.\nMany of the British films with larger budgets during the 1930s were produced by London Films, founded by Hungarian \"emigre\" Alexander Korda. The success of \"The Private Life of Henry VIII\" (1933), made at British and Dominions Elstree Studios, persuaded United Artists and The Prudential to invest in Korda's Denham Film Studios, which opened in May 1936, but both investors suffered losses as a result. Korda's films before the war included \"Things to Come\", \"Rembrandt\" (both 1936) and \"Knight Without Armour\" (1937), as well as the early Technicolour films \"The Drum\" (1938) and \"The Four Feathers\" (1939). These had followed closely on from \"Wings of the Morning\" (1937), the UK's first three-strip Technicolour feature film, made by the local offshoot of 20th Century Fox. Although some of Korda's films indulged in \"unrelenting pro-Empire flag waving\", those featuring Sabu turned him into \"a huge international star\"; \"for many years\" he had the highest profile of any actor of Indian origin. Paul Robeson was also cast in leading roles when \"there were hardly any opportunities\" for African Americans \"to play challenging roles\" in their own country's productions.\nIn 1933, the British Film Institute was established as the lead organisation for film in the UK. They set up the National Film Library in 1935 (now known as the BFI National Archive), with Ernest Lindgren as its curator.\nIn 1934, J. Arthur Rank became a co-founder of British National Films Company and they helped create Pinewood Studios, which opened in 1936. Also in 1936, Rank took over General Film Distributors and in 1937, Rank founded The Rank Organisation. In 1938, General Film Distributors became affiliated with Odeon Cinemas.\nRising expenditure and over-optimistic expectations of expansion into the American market caused a financial crisis in 1937, after an all-time high of 192 films were released in 1936. Of the 640 British production companies registered between 1925 and 1936, only 20 were still active in 1937. Moreover, the Cinematograph Films Act 1927 was up for renewal. The replacement Cinematograph Films Act 1938 provided incentives, via a \"quality test\", for UK companies to make fewer films, but of higher quality, and to eliminate the \"quota quickies\". Influenced by world politics, it encouraged American investment and imports. One result was the creation of MGM-British, an English subsidiary of the largest American studio, which produced four films before the war, including \"Goodbye, Mr. Chips\" (1939).\nThe new venture was initially based at Denham Studios. Korda himself lost control of the facility in 1939 to the Rank Organisation. Circumstances forced Korda's \"The Thief of Bagdad\" (1940), a spectacular fantasy film, to be completed in California, where Korda continued his film career during the war.\nBy now contracted to Gaumont British, Alfred Hitchcock had settled on the thriller genre by the mid-1930s with \"The Man Who Knew Too Much\" (1934), \"The 39 Steps\" (1935) and \"The Lady Vanishes\" (1938). Lauded in Britain where he was dubbed \"Alfred the Great\" by \"Picturegoer\" magazine, Hitchcock's reputation was beginning to develop overseas, with a \"New York Times\" feature writer asserting; \"Three unique and valuable institutions the British have that we in America have not. Magna Carta, the Tower Bridge and Alfred Hitchcock, the greatest director of screen melodramas in the world.\" Hitchcock was then signed up to a seven-year contract by Selznick and moved to Hollywood.\nSecond World War.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\n\"The idea of a nation of devoted cinema-goers is inextricably linked with the number of classic films released during the war years. This was British cinema\u2019s \u2018golden age\u2019, a period in which filmmakers such as Humphrey Jennings, David Lean, Powell and Pressburger, and Carol Reed came to the fore.\"\nPublished in \"The Times\" on 5 September 1939, two days after Britain declared war on Germany, George Bernard Shaw\u2019s letter protested against a government order to close all places of entertainment, including cinemas. \u2018What agent of Chancellor Hitler is it who has suggested that we should all cower in darkness and terror \u201cfor the duration\u201d?\u2019. Within two weeks of the order cinemas in the provinces were reopened, followed by central London within a month. In 1940, cinema admissions figures rose, to just over 1 billion for the year, and they continued rising to over 1.5 billion in 1943, 1944 and 1945.\nHumphrey Jennings began his career as a documentary film maker just before the war, in some cases working in collaboration with co-directors. \"London Can Take It\" (with Harry Wat, 1940) detailed the Blitz while \"Listen to Britain\" (with Stewart McAllister, 1942) looked at the home front. The Crown Film Unit, part of the Ministry of Information took over the responsibilities of the GPO Film Unit in 1940. Paul Rotha and Alberto Cavalcanti were colleagues of Jennings. British films began to make use of documentary techniques; Cavalcanti joined Ealing for \"Went the Day Well?\" (1942),\nMany other films helped to shape the popular image of the nation at war. Among the best known of these films are \"In Which We Serve\" (1942), \"We Dive at Dawn\" (1943), \"Millions Like Us\" (1943) and \"The Way Ahead\" (1944). The war years also saw the emergence of The Archers partnership between director Michael Powell and the Hungarian-born writer-producer Emeric Pressburger with films such as \"The Life and Death of Colonel Blimp\" (1943) and \"A Canterbury Tale\" (1944).\nTwo Cities Films, an independent production company releasing their films through a Rank subsidiary, also made some important films, including the No\u00ebl Coward and David Lean collaborations \"This Happy Breed\" (1944) and \"Blithe Spirit\" (1945) as well as Laurence Olivier's \"Henry V\" (1944). By this time, Gainsborough Studios were releasing their series of critically derided but immensely popular period melodramas, including \"The Man in Grey\" (1943) and \"The Wicked Lady\" (1945). New stars, such as Margaret Lockwood and James Mason, emerged in the Gainsborough films.\nPost-war cinema.\nTowards the end of the 1940s, the Rank Organisation became the dominant force behind British film-making, having acquired a number of British studios and the Gaumont chain (in 1941) to add to its Odeon Cinemas. Rank's serious financial crisis in 1949, a substantial loss and debt, resulted in the contraction of its film production. In practice, Rank maintained an industry duopoly with ABPC (later absorbed by EMI) for many years.\nFor the moment, the industry hit new heights of creativity in the immediate post-war years. Among the most significant films produced during this period were David Lean's \"Brief Encounter\" (1945) and his Dickens adaptations \"Great Expectations\" (1946) and \"Oliver Twist\" (1948), Ken Annakin's comedy \"Miranda\" (1948) starring Glynis Johns, Carol Reed's thrillers \"Odd Man Out\" (1947) and \"The Third Man\" (1949), and Powell and Pressburger's \"A Matter of Life and Death\" (1946), \"Black Narcissus\" (1947) and \"The Red Shoes\" (1948), the most commercially successful film of its year in the United States. Laurence Olivier's \"Hamlet\" (also 1948), was the first non-American film to win the Academy Award for Best Picture. Ealing Studios (financially backed by Rank) began to produce their most celebrated comedies, with three of the best remembered films, \"Whisky Galore\" (1948), \"Kind Hearts and Coronets\" and \"Passport to Pimlico\" (both 1949), being on release almost simultaneously. Their portmanteau horror film \"Dead of Night\" (1945) is also particularly highly regarded.\nUnder the Import Duties Act 1932, HM Treasury levied a 75% tariff on all film imports on 6 August 1947 which became known as Dalton Duty (after Hugh Dalton then the Chancellor of the Exchequer). The tax came into effect on 8 August, applying to all imported films, of which the overwhelming majority came from the United States; American film studio revenues from the UK had been in excess of US$68 million in 1946. The following day, 9 August, the Motion Picture Association of America announced that no further films would be supplied to British cinemas until further notice. The Dalton Duty was ended on 3 May 1948 with the American studios again exported films to the UK though the Marshall Plan prohibited US film companies from taking foreign exchange out of the nations their films played in.\nFollowing the Cinematograph Film Production (Special Loans) Act 1949, the National Film Finance Corporation (NFFC) was established as a British film funding agency.\nThe Eady Levy, named after Sir Wilfred Eady was a tax on box office receipts in the United Kingdom in order to support the British Film industry. It was established in 1950 coming into effect in 1957. A direct governmental payment to British-based producers would have qualified as a subsidy under the terms of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, and would have led to objections from American film producers. An indirect levy did not qualify as a subsidy, and so was a suitable way of providing additional funding for the UK film industry whilst avoiding criticism from abroad.\nIn 1951, the National Film Theatre was initially opened in a temporary building at the Festival of Britain. It moved to its present location on the South Bank in London for the first London Film Festival on 16 October 1957 run by the BFI.\nDuring the 1950s, the British industry began to concentrate on popular comedies and World War II dramas aimed more squarely at the domestic audience. The war films were often based on true stories and made in a similar low-key style to their wartime predecessors. They helped to make stars of actors like John Mills, Jack Hawkins and Kenneth More. Some of the most successful included \"The Cruel Sea\" (1953), \"The Dam Busters\" (1954), \"The Colditz Story\" (1955) and \"Reach for the Sky\" (1956).\nThe Rank Organisation produced some comedy successes, such as \"Genevieve\" (1953). The writer/director/producer team of twin brothers John and Roy Boulting also produced a series of successful satires on British life and institutions, beginning with \"Private's Progress\" (1956), and continuing with (among others) \"Brothers in Law\" (1957), \"Carlton-Browne of the F.O.\" (1958), and \"I'm All Right Jack\" (1959). Starring in \"School for Scoundrels\" (1960), the British Film Institute thought Terry-Thomas was \"outstanding as a classic British bounder\".\nPopular comedy series included the \"Doctor\" series, beginning with \"Doctor in the House\" (1954). The series originally starred Dirk Bogarde, probably the British industry's most popular star of the 1950s, though later films had Michael Craig and Leslie Phillips in leading roles. The Carry On series began in 1958 with regular instalments appearing for the next twenty years. The Italian director-producer Mario Zampi also made a number of successful black comedies, including \"Laughter in Paradise\" (1951), \"The Naked Truth\" (1957) and \"Too Many Crooks\" (1958). Ealing Studios had continued its run of successful comedies, including \"The Lavender Hill Mob\" (1951) and \"The Ladykillers\" (1955), but the company ceased production in 1958, after the studios had already been bought by the BBC.\nLess restrictive censorship towards the end of the 1950s encouraged film producer Hammer Films to embark on their series of commercially successful horror films. Beginning with adaptations of Nigel Kneale's BBC science fiction serials \"The Quatermass Experiment\" (1955) and \"Quatermass II\" (1957), Hammer quickly graduated to \"The Curse of Frankenstein\" (1957) and \"Dracula\" (1958), both deceptively lavish and the first gothic horror films in colour. The studio turned out numerous sequels and variants, with English actors Peter Cushing and Christopher Lee being the most regular leads. \"Peeping Tom\" (1960), a now highly regarded thriller, with horror elements, set in the contemporary period, was badly received by the critics at the time, and effectively finished the career of Michael Powell, its director.\nSocial realism.\nThe British New Wave film makers attempted to produce social realist films (see also 'kitchen sink realism') attempted in commercial feature films released between around 1959 and 1963 to convey narratives about a wider spectrum of people in Britain than the country's earlier films had done. These individuals, principally Karel Reisz, Lindsay Anderson and Tony Richardson, were also involved in the short lived Oxford film journal \"Sequence\" and the \"Free Cinema\" documentary film movement. The 1956 statement of Free Cinema, the name was coined by Anderson, asserted: \"No film can be too personal. The image speaks. Sounds amplifies and comments. Size is irrelevant. Perfection is not an aim. An attitude means a style. A style means an attitude.\" Anderson, in particular, was dismissive of the commercial film industry. Their documentary films included Anderson's \"Every Day Except Christmas\", among several sponsored by Ford of Britain, and Richardson's \"Momma Don't Allow\". Another member of this group, John Schlesinger, made documentaries for the BBC's \"Monitor\" arts series.\nTogether with future James Bond co-producer Harry Saltzman, dramatist John Osborne and Tony Richardson established the company Woodfall Films to produce their early feature films. These included adaptations of Richardson's stage productions of Osborne's \"Look Back in Anger\" (1959), with Richard Burton, and \"The Entertainer\" (1960) with Laurence Olivier, both from Osborne's own screenplays. Such films as Reisz's \"Saturday Night and Sunday Morning\" (also 1960), Richardson's \"A Taste of Honey\" (1961), Schlesinger's \"A Kind of Loving\" (1962) and \"Billy Liar\" (1963), and Anderson's \"This Sporting Life\" (1963) are often associated with a new openness about working-class life or previously taboo issues.\nThe team of Basil Dearden and Michael Relph, from an earlier generation, \"probe[d] into the social issues that now confronted social stability and the establishment of the promised peacetime consensus\". \"Pool of London\" (1950). and \"Sapphire\" (1959) were early attempts to create narratives about racial tensions and an emerging multi-cultural Britain. Dearden and Relph's \"Victim\" (1961), was about the blackmail of homosexuals. Influenced by the Wolfenden report of four years earlier, which advocated the decriminalising of homosexual sexual activity, this was \"the first British film to deal explicitly with homosexuality\". Unlike the New Wave film makers though, critical responses to Dearden's and Relph's work have not generally been positive.\nThe 1960s.\nAs the 1960s progressed, American studios returned to financially supporting British films, especially those that capitalised on the \"swinging London\" image propagated by \"Time\" magazine in 1966. Films like \"Darling\", \"The Knack ...and How to Get It\" (both 1965), \"Alfie\" and \"Georgy Girl\" (both 1966), all explored this phenomenon. \"Blowup\" (also 1966), and later \"Women in Love\" (1969), showed female and then male full-frontal nudity on screen in mainstream British films for the first time.\nAt the same time, film producers Harry Saltzman and Albert R. Broccoli combined sex with exotic locations, casual violence and self-referential humour in the phenomenally successful James Bond series with Sean Connery in the leading role. The first film \"Dr. No\" (1962) was a sleeper hit in the UK and the second, \"From Russia with Love\" (1963), a hit worldwide. By the time of the third film, \"Goldfinger\" (1964), the series had become a global phenomenon, reaching its commercial peak with \"Thunderball\" the following year. The series' success led to a spy film boom with many Bond imitations. Bond co-producer Saltzman also instigated a rival series of more realistic spy films based on the novels of Len Deighton. Michael Caine starred as bespectacled spy Harry Palmer in \"The Ipcress File\" (1965), and two sequels in the next few years. Other more downbeat espionage films were adapted from John le Carr\u00e9 novels, such as \"The Spy Who Came In from the Cold\" (1965) and \"The Deadly Affair\" (1966).\nAmerican directors were regularly working in London throughout the decade, but several became permanent residents in the UK. Blacklisted in America, Joseph Losey had a significant influence on British cinema in the 1960s, particularly with his collaborations with playwright Harold Pinter and leading man Dirk Bogarde, including \"The Servant\" (1963) and \"Accident\" (1967). Voluntary exiles Richard Lester and Stanley Kubrick were also active in the UK. Lester had major hits with The Beatles film \"A Hard Day's Night\" (1964) and \"The Knack ...and How to Get It\" (1965) and Kubrick with \"Dr. Strangelove\" (1963) and \"\" (1968). While Kubrick settled in Hertfordshire in the early 1960s and would remain in England for the rest of his career, these two films retained a strong American influence. Other films of this era involved prominent filmmakers from elsewhere in Europe, \"Repulsion\" (1965) and \"Blowup\" (1966) were the first English language films of the Polish director Roman Polanski and the Italian Michelangelo Antonioni respectively.\nHistorical films as diverse as \"Lawrence of Arabia\" (1962), \"Tom Jones\" (1963), and \"A Man for All Seasons\" (1966) benefited from the investment of American studios. Major films like \"Becket\" (1964), \"Khartoum\" (1966) and \"The Charge of the Light Brigade\" (1968) were regularly mounted, while smaller-scale films, including \"Accident\" (1967), were big critical successes. Four of the decade's Academy Award winners for best picture were British productions, including six Oscars for the film musical \"Oliver!\" (1968), based on the Charles Dickens novel \"Oliver Twist\".\nAfter directing several contributions to the BBC's \"Wednesday Play\" anthology series, Ken Loach began his feature film career with the social realist \"Poor Cow\" (1967) and \"Kes\" (1969). Meanwhile, the controversy around Peter Watkins \"The War Game\" (1965), which won the Best Documentary Film Oscar in 1967, but had been suppressed by the BBC who had commissioned it, would ultimately lead Watkins to work exclusively outside Britain.\n1970s.\nAmerican studios cut back on British productions, and in many cases withdrew from financing them altogether. Films financed by American interests were still being made, including Billy Wilder's \"The Private Life of Sherlock Holmes\" (1970), but for a time funds became hard to come by.\nMore relaxed censorship also brought several controversial films, including Nicolas Roeg and Donald Cammell's \"Performance\", Ken Russell's \"The Devils\" (1971), Sam Peckinpah's \"Straw Dogs\" (1971), and Stanley Kubrick's \"A Clockwork Orange\" (1971) starring Malcolm McDowell as the leader of a gang of thugs in a dystopian future Britain.\nOther films during the early 1970s included the Edwardian drama \"The Go-Between\" (1971), which won the Palme d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival, Nicolas Roeg's Venice-set supernatural thriller \"Don't Look Now\" (1973) and Mike Hodges' gangster drama \"Get Carter\" (1971) starring Michael Caine. Alfred Hitchcock returned to Britain to shoot \"Frenzy\" (1972), Other productions such as Richard Attenborough's \"Young Winston\" (1972) and \"A Bridge Too Far\" (1977) met with mixed commercial success. The British horror film cycle associated with Hammer Film Productions, Amicus and Tigon drew to a close, despite attempts by Hammer to spice up the formula with added nudity and gore. Although some attempts were made to broaden the range of British horror films, such as with \"The Wicker Man\" (1973), these films made little impact at the box office, In 1976, British Lion, who produced \"The Wicker Man\", were finally absorbed into the film division of EMI, who had taken over ABPC in 1969. The duopoly in British cinema exhibition, via Rank and now EMI, continued.\nIn the early 1970s, the government reduced its funding of the National Film Finance Corporation so the NFFC started to operate as a consortium, including with banks, which led to them using more commercial criteria for funding British films rather than focusing on quality or new talent, moving to fund films based on TV shows such as \"Up Pompeii\" (1971).\nSome other British producers, including Hammer, turned to television for inspiration, and big screen versions of popular sitcoms like \"On the Buses\" (1971) and \"Steptoe and Son\" (1972) proved successful with domestic audiences, the former had greater domestic box office returns in its year than the Bond film, \"Diamonds Are Forever\" and in 1973, an established British actor Roger Moore was cast as Bond in, \"Live and Let Die\", it was a commercial success and Moore would continue the role for the next 12 years. Low-budget British sex comedies included the \"Confessions of\u00a0...\" series starring Robin Askwith, beginning with \"Confessions of a Window Cleaner\" (1974). More elevated comedy films came from the Monty Python team, also from television. Their two most successful films were \"Monty Python and the Holy Grail\" (1975) and \"Monty Python's Life of Brian\" (1979), the latter a major commercial success, probably at least in part due to the controversy at the time surrounding its subject.\nSome American productions did return to the major British studios in 1977\u201379, including the original \"Star Wars\" (1977) at Elstree Studios, \"Superman\" (1978) at Pinewood, and \"Alien\" (1979) at Shepperton. Successful adaptations were made in the decade of the Agatha Christie novels \"Murder on the Orient Express\" (1974) and \"Death on the Nile\" (1978). The entry of Lew Grade's company ITC into film production in the latter half of the decade brought only a few box office successes and an unsustainable number of failures\n1980s.\nIn 1980, only 31 British films were made, a 50% decline from the previous year and the lowest number since 1914, and production fell again in 1981 to 24 films. The industry suffered further blows from falling cinema attendances, which reached a record low of 54 million in 1984, and the elimination of the 1957 Eady Levy, a tax concession, in the same year. The concession had made it possible for an overseas based film company to write off a large amount of its production costs by filming in the UK \u2013 this was what attracted a succession of big-budget American productions to British studios in the 1970s. These factors led to significant changes in the industry, with the profitability of British films now \"increasingly reliant on secondary markets such as video and television, and Channel 4\u00a0... [became] a crucial part of the funding equation.\"\nWith the removal of the levy, multiplex cinemas were introduced to the United Kingdom with the opening of a ten-screen cinema by AMC Cinemas at The Point in Milton Keynes in 1985 and the number of screens in the UK increased by around 500 over the decade leading to increased attendances of almost 100 million by the end of the decade.\nThe 1980s soon saw a renewed optimism, led by smaller independent production companies such as Goldcrest, HandMade Films and Merchant Ivory Productions.\nHandmade Films, which was partly owned by George Harrison, was originally formed to take over the production of \"Monty Python's Life of Brian\", after EMI's Bernard Delfont (Lew Grade's brother) had pulled out. Handmade also bought and released the gangster drama \"The Long Good Friday\" (1980), produced by a Lew Grade subsidiary, after its original backers became cautious. Members of the Python team were involved in other comedies during the decade, including Terry Gilliam's fantasy films \"Time Bandits\" (1981) and \"Brazil\" (1985), the black comedy \"Withnail &amp; I\" (1987), and John Cleese's hit \"A Fish Called Wanda\" (1988), while Michael Palin starred in \"A Private Function\" (1984), from Alan Bennett's first screenplay for the cinema screen.\nGoldcrest producer David Puttnam has been described as \"the nearest thing to a mogul that British cinema has had in the last quarter of the 20th century.\" Under Puttnam, a generation of British directors emerged making popular films with international distribution. Some of the talent backed by Puttnam \u2014 Hugh Hudson, Ridley Scott, Alan Parker, and Adrian Lyne \u2014 had shot commercials; Puttnam himself had begun his career in the advertising industry. When Hudson's \"Chariots of Fire\" (1981) won 4 Academy Awards in 1982, including Best Picture, its writer Colin Welland declared \"the British are coming!\". When \"Gandhi\" (1982), another Goldcrest film, picked up a Best Picture Oscar, it looked as if he was right.\nIt prompted a cycle of period films \u2013 some with a large budget for a British film, such as David Lean's final film \"A Passage to India\" (1984), alongside the lower-budget Merchant Ivory adaptations of the works of E. M. Forster, such as \"A Room with a View\" (1986). But further attempts to make 'big' productions for the US market ended in failure, with Goldcrest losing its independence after \"Revolution\" (1985) and \"Absolute Beginners\" (1986) were commercial and critical flops. Another Goldcrest film, Roland Joff\u00e9's \"The Mission\" (also 1986), won the 1986 Palme d'Or, but did not go into profit either. Joff\u00e9's earlier \"The Killing Fields\" (1984) had been both a critical and financial success. These were Joff\u00e9's first two feature films and were amongst those produced by Puttnam.\nMainly outside the commercial sector, film makers from the new commonwealth countries had begun to emerge during the 1970s. Horace Ov\u00e9's \"Pressure\" (1975) had been funded by the British Film Institute as was \"A Private Enterprise\" (1974), these being the first Black British and Asian British films, respectively. The 1980s however saw a wave of new talent, with films such as Franco Rosso's \"Babylon\" (1980), Menelik Shabazz's \"Burning an Illusion\" (1981) and Po-Chih Leong's \"Ping Pong\" (1986; one of the first films about Britain's Chinese community). Many of these films were assisted by the newly formed Channel 4, which had an official remit to provide for \"minority audiences.\" Commercial success was first achieved with \"My Beautiful Laundrette\" (1985). Dealing with racial and gay issues, it was developed from Hanif Kureishi's first film script. \"My Beautiful Laundrette\" features Daniel Day-Lewis in a leading role. Day-Lewis and other young British actors who were becoming stars, such as Gary Oldman, Colin Firth, Tim Roth and Rupert Everett, were dubbed the Brit Pack.\nWith the involvement of Channel 4 in film production, talents from television moved into feature films with Stephen Frears (\"My Beautiful Laundrette\") and Mike Newell with \"Dance with a Stranger\" (1985). John Boorman, who had been working in the US, was encouraged back to the UK to make \"Hope and Glory\" (1987). Channel Four also became a major sponsor of the British Film Institute's Production Board, which backed three of Britain's most critically acclaimed filmmakers: Derek Jarman (\"The Last of England\", 1987), Terence Davies (\"Distant Voices, Still Lives\", 1988), and Peter Greenaway; the latter of whom gained surprising commercial success with \"The Draughtsman's Contract\" (1982) and \"The Cook, the Thief, His Wife &amp; Her Lover\" (1989). Stephen Woolley's company Palace Pictures also produced some successful films, including Neil Jordan's \"The Company of Wolves\" (1984) and \"Mona Lisa\" (1986), before collapsing amid a series of unsuccessful films. Amongst the other British films of the decade were Bill Forsyth's \"Gregory's Girl\" (1981) and \"Local Hero\" (1983), Lewis Gilbert's \"Educating Rita\" (1983), Peter Yates' \"The Dresser\" (1983) and Kenneth Branagh's directorial debut, \"Henry V\" (1989).\n1990s.\nCompared to the 1980s, investment in film production rose dramatically. In 1989, annual investment was a meagre \u00a3104 million. By 1996, this figure had soared to \u00a3741 million. Nevertheless, the dependence on finance from television broadcasters such as the BBC and Channel 4 meant that budgets were often low and indigenous production was very fragmented: the film industry mostly relied on Hollywood inward investment. According to critic Neil Watson, it was hoped that the \u00a390 million apportioned by the new National Lottery into three franchises (The Film Consortium, Path\u00e9 Pictures, and DNA) would fill the gap, but \"corporate and equity finance for the UK film production industry continues to be thin on the ground and most production companies operating in the sector remain hopelessly under-capitalised.\"\nThese problems were mostly compensated by PolyGram Filmed Entertainment, a film studio whose British subsidiary Working Title Films released a Richard Curtis-scripted comedy \"Four Weddings and a Funeral\" (1994). It grossed $244 million worldwide and introduced Hugh Grant to global fame, led to renewed interest and investment in British films, and set a pattern for British-set romantic comedies, including \"Sliding Doors\" (1998) and \"Notting Hill\" (1999). Other Working Titles films included \"Bean\" (1997), \"Elizabeth\" (1998) and \"Captain Corelli's Mandolin\" (2001). PFE was eventually sold and merged with Universal Pictures in 1999, the hopes and expectations of \"building a British-based company which could compete with Hollywood in its home market [had] eventually collapsed.\"\nTax incentives allowed American producers to increasingly invest in UK-based film production throughout the 1990s, including films such as \"Interview with the Vampire\" (1994), ' (1996), \"Saving Private Ryan\" (1998), ' (1999) and \"The Mummy\" (1999). Miramax also distributed Neil Jordan's acclaimed thriller \"The Crying Game\" (1992), which was generally ignored on its initial release in the UK, but was a considerable success in the United States. The same company also enjoyed some success releasing the BBC period drama \"Enchanted April\" (1992) and \"The Wings of the Dove\" (1997).\nAmong the more successful British films were the Merchant Ivory productions \"Howards End\" (1992) and \"The Remains of the Day\" (1993), Richard Attenborough's \"Shadowlands\" (1993), and Kenneth Branagh's Shakespeare adaptations. \"The Madness of King George\" (1994) proved there was still a market for British costume dramas, and other period films followed, including \"Sense and Sensibility\" (1995), \"Restoration\" (1995), \"Emma\" (1996), \"Mrs. Brown\" (1997), \"Basil\" (1998), \"Shakespeare in Love\" (1998) and \"Topsy-Turvy\" (1999).\nAfter a six-year hiatus for legal reasons the James Bond films returned to production with the 17th Bond film, \"GoldenEye\". With their traditional home Pinewood Studios fully booked, a new studio was created for the film in a former Rolls-Royce aero-engine factory at Leavesden in Hertfordshire.\nMike Leigh emerged as a significant figure in British cinema in the 1990s, with a series of films financed by Channel 4 about working and middle class life in modern England, including \"Life Is Sweet\" (1991), \"Naked\" (1993) and his biggest hit \"Secrets &amp; Lies\" (1996), which won the Palme d'Or at Cannes.\nOther new talents to emerge during the decade included the writer-director-producer team of John Hodge, Danny Boyle and Andrew Macdonald responsible for \"Shallow Grave\" (1994) and \"Trainspotting\" (1996). The latter film generated interested in other \"regional\" productions, including the Scottish films \"Small Faces\" (1996), \"Ratcatcher\" (1999) and \"My Name Is Joe\" (1998).\n2000s.\nThe first decade of the 21st century was a relatively successful one for the British film industry. Many British films found a wide international audience due to funding from BBC Films, Film 4 and the UK Film Council, and some independent production companies, such as Working Title, secured financing and distribution deals with major American studios. Working Title scored three major international successes, all starring Hugh Grant and Colin Firth, with the romantic comedies \"Bridget Jones's Diary\" (2001), which grossed $254 million worldwide; the sequel \"\", which earned $228 million; and Richard Curtis's directorial debut \"Love Actually\" (2003), which grossed $239 million. The most successful of all, Phyllida Lloyd's \"Mamma Mia!\" (2008), grossed $601 million.\nThe new decade saw a major new film series in the Harry Potter films, beginning with \"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone\" in 2001. David Heyman's company Heyday Films has produced seven sequels, with the final title released in two parts \u2013 \"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows \u2013 Part 1\" in 2010 and \"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows \u2013 Part 2\" in 2011. All were filmed at Leavesden Studios in England.\nAardman Animations' Nick Park, the creator of Wallace and Gromit and the Creature Comforts series, produced his first feature-length film, \"Chicken Run\" in 2000. Co-directed with Peter Lord, the film was a major success worldwide and one of the most successful British films of its year. Park's follow up, \"\" was another worldwide hit: it grossed $56 million at the US box office and \u00a332 million in the UK. It also won the 2005 Academy Award for Best Animated Feature.\nHowever it was usually through domestically funded features throughout the decade that British directors and films won awards at the top international film festivals. In 2003, Michael Winterbottom won the Golden Bear at the Berlin Film Festival for \"In This World\". In 2004, Mike Leigh directed \"Vera Drake\", an account of a housewife who leads a double life as an abortion provider in 1950s London. The film won the Golden Lion at the Venice Film Festival. In 2006 Stephen Frears directed \"The Queen\" based on the events surrounding the death of Princess Diana, which won the Best Actress prize at the Venice Film Festival and Academy Awards and the BAFTA for Best Film. In 2006, Ken Loach won the Palme d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival with his account of the struggle for Irish Independence in \"The Wind That Shakes the Barley\". Joe Wright's adaptation of the Ian McEwan novel \"Atonement\" was nominated for 7 Academy Awards, including Best Film and won the Golden Globe and BAFTA for Best Film. \"Slumdog Millionaire\" was filmed entirely in Mumbai with a mostly Indian cast, though with a British director (Danny Boyle), producer (Christian Colson), screenwriter (Simon Beaufoy) and star (Dev Patel)\u2014the film was all-British financed via Film4 and Celador. It has received worldwide critical acclaim. It has won four Golden Globes, seven BAFTA Awards and eight Academy Awards, including Best Director and Best Film. \"The King's Speech\", which tells the story of King George VI's attempts to overcome his speech impediment, was directed by Tom Hooper and filmed almost entirely in London. It received four Academy Awards (including Best Film, Best Director, Best Actor and Best Screenplay) in 2011.\nThe start of the 21st century saw Asian British cinema assert itself at the box office, starting with \"East Is East\" (1999) and continuing with \"Bend It Like Beckham\" (2002). Other notable British Asian films from this period include \"My Son the Fanatic\" (1997), \"Ae Fond Kiss... (2004)\", \"Mischief Night (2006)\", \"Yasmin\" (2004) and \"Four Lions\" (2010). Some argue it has brought more flexible attitudes towards casting Black and Asian British actors, with Robbie Gee and Naomie Harris take leading roles in \"Underworld\" and \"28 Days Later\" respectively.\n2005 saw the emergence of The British Urban Film Festival, a timely addition to the film festival calendar, which recognised the influence of urban and black films on UK audiences and consequently began to showcase a growing profile of films in a genre previously not otherwise regularly seen in the capital's cinemas. Then, in 2006, \"Kidulthood\", a film depicting a group of teenagers growing up on the streets of West London, had a limited release. This was successfully followed up with a sequel \"Adulthood\" (2008) that was written and directed by actor Noel Clarke. The success of \"Kidulthood\" and \"Adulthood\" led to the release of several other films in the 2000s and 2010s such as \"Bullet Boy\" (2004), \"Life and Lyrics\" (2006), \"The Intent\" (2016), its sequel \"\" (2018), \"Blue Story\" and \"Rocks\" (both 2019), all of starred Black-British actors.\nLike the 1960s, this decade saw plenty of British films directed by imported talent. The American Woody Allen shot \"Match Point\" (2005) and three later films in London. The Mexican director Alfonso Cuar\u00f3n helmed \"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban\" (2004) and \"Children of Men\" (2006); New Zealand filmmaker Jane Campion made \"Bright Star\" (2009), a film set in 19th century London; Danish director Nicolas Winding Refn made \"Bronson\" (2008), a biopic about the English criminal Michael Gordon Peterson; the Spanish filmmaker Juan Carlos Fresnadillo directed \"28 Weeks Later\" (2007), a sequel to a British horror film; and two John le Carr\u00e9 adaptations were also directed by foreigners\u2014\"The Constant Gardener\" by the Brazilian Fernando Meirelles and \"Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy\" by the Swedish Tomas Alfredson. The decade also saw English actor Daniel Craig became the new James Bond with \"Casino Royale\", the 21st entry in the official Eon Productions series.\nDespite increasing competition from film studios in Australia and Eastern Europe, British studios such as Pinewood, Shepperton and Leavesden remained successful in hosting major productions, including \"Finding Neverland\", \"Closer\", \"Batman Begins\", \"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory\", \"United 93\", \"The Phantom of the Opera\", ', \"Fantastic Mr. Fox\", \"Robin Hood\", ', \"Hugo\" and \"War Horse\".\nIn February 2007, the UK became home to Europe's first DCI-compliant fully digital multiplex cinemas with the launch of Odeon Hatfield and Odeon Surrey Quays (in London), with a total of 18 digital screens.\nIn November 2010, Warner Bros. completed the acquisition of Leavesden Film Studios, becoming the first Hollywood studio since the 1940s to have a permanent base in the UK, and announced plans to invest \u00a3100 million in the site.\nA study by the British Film Institute published in December 2013 found that of the 613 tracked British films released between 2003 and 2010 only 7% made a profit. Films with low budgets, those that cost below \u00a3500,000 to produce, were even less likely to gain a return on outlay. Of these films, only 3.1% went into the black. At the top end of budgets for the British industry, under a fifth of films that cost \u00a310million went into profit.\n2010s.\nOn 26 July 2010 it was announced that the UK Film Council, which was the main body responsible for the development of promotion of British cinema during the 2000s, would be abolished, with many of the abolished body's functions being taken over by the British Film Institute. Actors and professionals, including James McAvoy, Emily Blunt, Pete Postlethwaite, Damian Lewis, Timothy Spall, Daniel Barber and Ian Holm, campaigned against the council's abolition. The move also led American actor and director Clint Eastwood (who had filmed \"Hereafter\" in London) to write to the British Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne in August 2010 to protest the decision to close the council. Eastwood warned Osborne that the closure could result in fewer foreign production companies choosing to work in the UK. A grass-roots online campaign was launched and a petition established by supporters of the council.\nCountering this, a few professionals, including Michael Winner and Julian Fellowes, supported the Government's decision. A number of other organisations responded positively.\nAt the closure of the UK Film Council on 31 March 2011, \"The Guardian\" reported that \"The UKFC's entire annual budget was a reported \u00a33m, while the cost of closing it down and restructuring is estimated to have been almost four times that amount.\" One of the UKFC's last films, \"The King's Speech\", is estimated to have cost $15m to make and grossed $235m, besides winning several Academy Awards. UKFC invested $1.6m for a 34% share of net profits, a valuable stake that will pass to the British Film Institute.\nIn June 2012, Warner opened the re-developed Leavesden studio for business. The most commercially successful British directors in recent years are Paul Greengrass, Mike Newell, Christopher Nolan, Ridley Scott and David Yates.\nIn January 2012, at Pinewood Studios to visit film-related businesses, UK Prime Minister David Cameron said that his government had bold ambitions for the film industry: \"Our role, and that of the BFI, should be to support the sector in becoming even more dynamic and entrepreneurial, helping UK producers to make commercially successful pictures that rival the quality and impact of the best international productions. Just as the British Film Commission has played a crucial role in attracting the biggest and best international studios to produce their films here, so we must incentivise UK producers to chase new markets both here and overseas.\"\nThe film industry remains an important earner for the British economy. According to a UK Film Council press release of 20 January 2011, \u00a31.115 billion was spent on UK film production during 2010. A 2014 survey suggested that British-made films were generally more highly rated than Hollywood productions, especially when considering low-budget UK productions.\n2020s.\nIn November 2022, director Danny Boyle expressed a negative sentiment of the British film industry in recent years, stating that \"I am not sure we are great filmmakers, to be absolutely honest. As a nation, our two artforms are theatre, in a middle-class sense, and pop music, because we are extraordinary at it.\"\nThe BFI's published figures reported \u00a36.27 billion spent on film and high-end television production in 2022, with domestic UK film spend at \u00a3173.6 million. While the total spend was at a record high for the UK, the independent UK filmmaking spend decreased by 31% since 2021.\nThe UK film industry was affected by the 2023 SAG-AFTRA strike with 80% of behind-the-scenes workers surveyed stating that their jobs had been affected.\nArt cinema.\nAlthough it had been funding British experimental films as early as 1952, the British Film Institute's foundation of a production board in 1964\u2014and a substantial increase in public funding from 1971 onwards\u2014enabled it to become a dominant force in developing British art cinema in the 1970s and 80s: from the first of Bill Douglas's Trilogy \"My Childhood\" (1972), and of Terence Davies' Trilogy \"Childhood\" (1978), via Peter Greenaway's earliest films (including the surprising commercial success of \"The Draughtsman's Contract\" (1982)) and Derek Jarman's championing of the New Queer Cinema. The first full-length feature produced under the BFI's new scheme was Kevin Brownlow and Andrew Mollo's \"Winstanley\" (1975), while others included \"Moon Over the Alley\" (1975), \"Requiem for a Village\" (1975), the openly avant-garde \"Central Bazaar\" (1973), \"Pressure\" (1975) and \"A Private Enterprise\" (1974) \u2013 the last two being, respectively, the first British Black and Asian features.\nThe release of Derek Jarman's \"Jubilee\" (1978) marked the beginning of a successful period of UK art cinema, continuing into the 1980s with filmmakers like Sally Potter and Ken McMullen, and producers like Stewart Richards, with success at the Cannes Film Festival and the Academy Awards. Unlike the previous generation of British film makers who had broken into directing and production after careers in the theatre or on television, the Art Cinema Directors were mostly the products of Art Schools. Many of these filmmakers were championed in their early career by the London Film Makers Cooperative and their work was the subject of detailed theoretical analysis in the journal \"Screen Education\". Peter Greenaway was an early pioneer of the use of computer generated imagery blended with filmed footage and was also one of the first directors to film entirely on high definition video for a cinema release.\nWith the launch of Channel 4 and its Film on Four commissioning strand, Art Cinema was promoted to a wider audience. However, the Channel had a sharp change in its commissioning policy in the early 1990s and Greenaway and others were forced to seek European co-production financing.\nFilm technology.\nIn the 1970s and 1980s, British studios established a reputation for great special effects in films such as \"Superman\" (1978), \"Alien\" (1979), and \"Batman\" (1989). Some of this reputation was founded on the core of talent brought together for the filming of \"\" (1968) who subsequently worked together on series and feature films for Gerry Anderson. Thanks to the Bristol-based Aardman Animations, the UK is still recognised as a world leader in the use of stop-motion animation.\nBritish special effects technicians and production designers are known for creating visual effects at a far lower cost than their counterparts in the US, as seen in \"Time Bandits\" (1981) and \"Brazil\" (1985). This reputation has continued through the 1990s and into the 21st century with films such as the James Bond series, \"Gladiator\" (2000) and the Harry Potter franchise.\nFrom the 1990s to the present day, there has been a progressive movement from traditional film opticals to an integrated digital film environment, with special effects, cutting, colour grading, and other post-production tasks all sharing the same all-digital infrastructure. The London-based visual effects company Framestore, with Tim Webber the visual effects supervisor, have worked on some of the most technically and artistically challenging projects, including, \"The Dark Knight\" (2008) and \"Gravity\" (2013), with new techniques involved in \"Gravity\" realized by Webber and the Framestore team taking three years to complete.\nThe availability of high-speed internet has made the British film industry capable of working closely with U.S. studios as part of globally distributed productions. As of 2005, this trend is expected to continue with moves towards (currently experimental) digital distribution and projection as mainstream technologies. The British film \"This Is Not a Love Song\" (2003) was the first to be streamed live on the Internet at the same time as its cinema premiere.\nFilm festivals.\nThe United Kingdom is home to a variety of film festivals celebrating both national and international cinema. Major annual events include the BFI London Film Festival, the country's largest public film event, the Glasgow Film Festival, and Sheffield DocFest, one of the world's leading documentary festivals.\nThese festivals provide a platform for independent, documentary, and international filmmakers, as well as showcasing emerging British talent. In recent years, specialist festivals focusing on horror, LGBTQ+, and short films have also gained prominence in cities such as Manchester, Brighton, and Bristol.\nBlack British cinema.\nBlack British cinema has experienced significant growth in recent years, with directors like Steve McQueen (\"Small Axe\"), Dionne Edwards (\"Pretty Red Dress\"), and Rapman (\"Blue Story\") addressing cultural, social, and racial issues within the UK.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

With the advancements in film throughout the years feminist film theory has developed and changed to analyse the current ways of film and also go back to analyse films past. Feminists have many approaches to cinema analysis, regarding the film elements analyzed and their theoretical underpinnings.\nHistory.\nThe development of feminist film theory was influenced by second wave feminism and women's studies in the 1960s and 1970s. Initially, in the United States in the early 1970s, feminist film theory was generally based on sociological theory and focused on the function of female characters in film narratives or genres. Feminist film theory, such as Marjorie Rosen's \"Popcorn Venus: Women, Movies, and the American Dream\" (1973) and Molly Haskell\u2019s \"From Reverence to Rape: The Treatment of Women in Movies\" (1974) analyze the ways in which women are portrayed in film, and how this relates to a broader historical context. Additionally, feminist critiques also examine common stereotypes depicted in film, the extent to which the women were shown as active or passive, and the amount of screen time given to women.\nIn contrast, film theoreticians in England concerned themselves with critical theory, psychoanalysis, semiotics, and Marxism. Eventually, these ideas gained hold within the American scholarly community in the 1980s. Analysis generally focused on the meaning within a film's text and the way in which the text constructs a viewing subject. It also examined how the process of cinematic production affects how women are represented and reinforces sexism.\nBritish feminist film theorist, Laura Mulvey, best known for her essay, \"Visual Pleasure and Narrative Cinema\", written in 1973 and published in 1975 in the influential British film theory journal, \"Screen\" was influenced by the theories of Sigmund Freud and Jacques Lacan. \"Visual Pleasure\" is one of the first major essays that helped shift the orientation of film theory towards a psychoanalytic framework. Prior to Mulvey, film theorists such as Jean-Louis Baudry and Christian Metz used psychoanalytic ideas in their theoretical accounts of cinema. Mulvey's contribution, however, initiated the intersection of film theory, psychoanalysis and feminism.\nIn 1976, the journal Camera Obscura was published by beginning graduate students Janet Bergstrom, Sandy Flitterman, Elisabeth Lyon, and Constance Penley. They discussed how women were portrayed in films, but excluded from the development process. Camera Obscura is still published to this day by Duke University Press and has moved from just film theory to media studies.\nOther key influences come from Metz's essay \"The Imaginary Signifier\", \"Identification, Mirror,\" where he argues that viewing film is only possible through scopophilia (pleasure from looking, related to voyeurism), which is best exemplified in silent film. Also, according to Cynthia A. Freeland in \"Feminist Frameworks for Horror Films,\" feminist studies of horror films have focused on psychodynamics where the chief interest is \"on viewers' motives and interests in watching horror films\".\nBeginning in the early 1980s, feminist film theory began to look at film through a more intersectional lens. The film journal \"Jump Cut\" published a special issue about titled \"Lesbians and Film\" in 1981 which examined the lack of lesbian identities in film. Jane Gaines's essay \"White Privilege and Looking Relations: Race and Gender in Feminist Film Theory\" examined the erasure of black women in cinema by white male filmmakers. While Lola Young argues that filmmakers of all races fail to break away from the use to tired stereotypes when depicting black women. Other theorists who wrote about feminist film theory and race include bell hooks and Michele Wallace.\nFrom 1985 onward the Matrixial theory of artist and psychoanalyst Bracha L. Ettinger revolutionized feminist film theory. \n Her concept, from her book, The Matrixial Gaze, has established a feminine gaze and has articulated its differences from the phallic gaze and its relation to feminine as well as maternal specificities and potentialities of \"coemergence\", offering a critique of Sigmund Freud's and Jacques Lacan's psychoanalysis, is extensively used in analysis of films, by female directors, like Chantal Akerman, as well as by male directors, like Pedro Almodovar. The matrixial gaze offers the female the position of a subject, not of an object, of the gaze, while deconstructing the structure of the subject itself, and offers border-time, border-space and a possibility for compassion and witnessing. Ettinger's notions articulate the links between aesthetics, ethics and trauma.\nRecently, scholars have expanded their work to include analysis of television and digital media. Additionally, they have begun to explore notions of difference, engaging in dialogue about the differences among women (part of movement away from essentialism in feminist work more generally), the various methodologies and perspectives contained under the umbrella of feminist film theory, and the multiplicity of methods and intended effects that influence the development of films. Scholars are also taking increasingly global perspectives, responding to postcolonialist criticisms of perceived Anglo- and Eurocentrism in the academy more generally. Increased focus has been given to, \"disparate feminisms, nationalisms, and media in various locations and across class, racial, and ethnic groups throughout the world\". Scholars in recent years have also turned their attention towards women in the silent film industry and their erasure from the history of those films and women's bodies and how they are portrayed in the films. Jane Gaines's Women's Film Pioneer Project (WFPP), a database of women who worked in the silent-era film industry, has been cited as a major achievement in recognizing pioneering women in the field of silent and non-silent film by scholars such as Rachel Schaff.\nAs of recent years many believe feminist film theory to be a fading area of feminism with the massive amount of coverage currently around media studies and theory. As these areas have grown the framework created in feminist film theory have been adapted to fit into analysing other forms of media.\nKey themes.\nThe gaze and the female spectator.\nConsidering the way that films are put together, many feminist film critics have pointed to what they argue is the \"male gaze\" that predominates classical Hollywood filmmaking. Budd Boetticher summarizes the view:\n\"What counts is what the heroine provokes, or rather what she represents. She is the one, or rather the love or fear she inspires in the hero, or else the concern he feels for her, who makes him act the way he does. In herself, the woman has not the slightest importance.\"\nLaura Mulvey expands on this conception to argue that in cinema, women are typically depicted in a passive role that provides visual pleasure through scopophilia, and identification with the on-screen male actor. She asserts: \"In their traditional exhibitionist role women are simultaneously looked at and displayed, with their appearance coded for strong visual and erotic impact so that they can be said to connote \"to-be-looked-at-ness\",\" and as a result contends that in film a woman is the \"bearer of meaning, not maker of meaning.\" Mulvey argues that the psychoanalytic theory of Jacques Lacan is the key to understanding how film creates such a space for female sexual objectification and exploitation through the combination of the patriarchal order of society, and 'looking' in itself as a pleasurable act of scopophilia, as \"the cinema satisfies a primordial wish for pleasurable looking.\"\nWhile Laura Mulvey's paper has a particular place in the feminist film theory, it is important to note that her ideas regarding ways of watching the cinema (from the voyeuristic element to the feelings of identification) are important to some feminist film theorists in terms of defining spectatorship from the psychoanalytical viewpoint.\nMulvey identifies three \"looks\" or perspectives that occur in film which, she argues, serve to sexually objectify women. The first is the perspective of the male character and how he perceives the female character. The second is the perspective of the spectator as they see the female character on screen. The third \"look\" joins the first two looks together: it is the male audience member's perspective of the male character in the film. This third perspective allows the male audience to take the female character as his own personal sex object because he can relate himself, through looking, to the male character in the film.\nIn the paper, Mulvey calls for a destruction of modern film structure as the only way to free women from their sexual objectification in film. She argues for a removal of the voyeurism encoded into film by creating distance between the male spectator and the female character. The only way to do so, Mulvey argues, is by destroying the element of voyeurism and \"the invisible guest\". Mulvey also asserts that the dominance men embody is only so because women exist, as without a woman for comparison, a man and his supremacy as the controller of visual pleasure are insignificant. For Mulvey, it is the presence of the female that defines the patriarchal order of society as well as the male psychology of thought.\nMulvey's argument is likely influenced by the time period in which she was writing. \"Visual Pleasure and Narrative Cinema\" was composed during the period of second-wave feminism, which was concerned with achieving equality for women in the workplace, and with exploring the psychological implications of sexual stereotypes. Mulvey calls for an eradication of female sexual objectivity, aligning herself with second-wave feminism. She argues that in order for women to be equally represented in the workplace, women must be portrayed as men are: as lacking sexual objectification.\nMulvey proposes in her notes to the Criterion Collection DVD of Michael Powell's controversial film, \"Peeping Tom\" (a film about a homicidal voyeur who films the deaths of his victims), that the cinema spectator's own voyeurism is made shockingly obvious and even more shockingly, the spectator identifies with the perverted protagonist. The inference is that she includes female spectators in that, identifying with the male observer rather than the female object of the gaze.\nRealism and counter cinema.\nThe early work of Marjorie Rosen and Molly Haskell on the representation of women in film was part of a movement to depict women more realistically, both in documentaries and narrative cinema. The growing female presence in the film industry was seen as a positive step toward realizing this goal, by drawing attention to feminist issues and putting forth an alternative, true-to-life view of women. However, Rosen and Haskell argue that these images are still mediated by the same factors as traditional film, such as the \"moving camera, composition, editing, lighting, and all varieties of sound.\" While acknowledging the value in inserting positive representations of women in film, some critics asserted that real change would only come about from reconsidering the role of film in society, often from a semiotic point of view.\nClaire Johnston put forth the idea that women's cinema can function as \"counter cinema.\" Through consciousness of the means of production and opposition of sexist ideologies, films made by women have the potential to posit an alternative to traditional Hollywood films. Initially, the attempt to show \"real\" women was praised, eventually critics such as Eileen McGarry claimed that the \"real\" women being shown on screen were still just contrived depictions. In reaction to this article, many women filmmakers integrated \"alternative forms and experimental techniques\" to \"encourage audiences to critique the seemingly transparent images on the screen and to question the manipulative techniques of filming and editing\".\nAdditional theories.\nB. Ruby Rich argues that feminist film theory should shift to look at films in a broader sense. Rich's essay \"In the Name of Feminist Film Criticism\" claims that films by women often receive praise for certain elements, while feminist undertones are ignored. Rich goes on to say that because of this feminist theory needs to focus on how film by women are being received.\nComing from a black feminist perspective, American scholar, Bell Hooks, put forth the notion of the \u201coppositional gaze,\u201d encouraging black women not to accept stereotypical representations in film, but rather actively critique them. The \u201coppositional gaze\u201d is a response to Mulvey's \"visual pleasure\" and states that just as women do not identify with female characters that are not \"real,\" women of color should respond similarly to the one denominational caricatures of black women.\nJanet Bergstrom's article \u201cEnunciation and Sexual Difference\u201d (1979) uses Sigmund Freud's ideas of bisexual responses, arguing that women are capable of identifying with male characters and men with women characters, either successively or simultaneously. Miriam Hansen, in \"Pleasure, Ambivalence, Identification: Valentino and Female Spectatorship\" (1984) put forth the idea that women are also able to view male characters as erotic objects of desire. In \"The Master's Dollhouse: Rear Window,\" Tania Modleski argues that Hitchcock's film, \"Rear Window\", is an example of the power of male gazer and the position of the female as a prisoner of the \"master's dollhouse\".\nCarol Clover, in her popular and influential book, \"Men, Women, and Chainsaws: Gender in the Modern Horror Film\" (Princeton University Press, 1992), argues that young male viewers of the Horror Genre (young males being the primary demographic) are quite prepared to identify with the female-in-jeopardy, a key component of the horror narrative, and to identify on an unexpectedly profound level. Clover further argues that the \"final girl\" in the psychosexual subgenre of exploitation horror invariably triumphs through her own resourcefulness, and is not by any means a passive, or inevitable, victim. Laura Mulvey, in response to these and other criticisms, revisited the topic in \"Afterthoughts on 'Visual Pleasure and Narrative Cinema' inspired by \"Duel in the Sun\"\" (1981). In addressing the heterosexual female spectator, she revised her stance to argue that women can take two possible roles in relation to film: a masochistic identification with the female object of desire that is ultimately self-defeating, or an identification with men as the active viewers of the text. A new version of the gaze was offered in the early 1990s by Bracha Ettinger, who proposed the notion of the \"matrixial gaze\".\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Film theory is not to be confused with general film criticism, or film history, though these three disciplines interrelate. Although some branches of film theory are derived from linguistics and literary theory, it also originated and overlaps with the philosophy of film.\nHistory.\nEarly theory, before 1945.\nFrench philosopher Henri Bergson's \"Matter and Memory\" (1896) anticipated the development of film theory during the birth of cinema in the early twentieth century. Bergson commented on the need for new ways of thinking about movement, and coined the terms \"the movement-image\" and \"the time-image\". However, in his 1906 essay \"L'illusion cin\u00e9matographique\" (in \"L'\u00e9volution cr\u00e9atrice\"; English: \"The cinematic illusion\") he rejects film as an example of what he had in mind. Nonetheless, decades later, in \"Cin\u00e9ma I and \" (1983\u20131985), the philosopher Gilles Deleuze took \"Matter and Memory\" as the basis of his philosophy of film and revisited Bergson's concepts, combining them with the semiotics of Charles Sanders Peirce. Early film theory arose in the silent era and was mostly concerned with defining the crucial elements of the medium. Ricciotto Canudo was an early Italian film theoretician who saw cinema as \"\"plastic art in motion\", and gave cinema the label \"the Sixth Art\", later changed to \"the Seventh Art\"\".\nIn 1915, Vachel Lindsay wrote a book on film, followed a year later by Hugo M\u00fcnsterberg. Lindsay argued that films could be classified into three categories: \"action films\", \"intimate films\", as well as \"films of splendour\". According to him, the action film was \"sculpture-in-motion\", while the intimate film was \"painting-in-motion\", and splendour film \"architecture-in-motion\". He also argued against the contemporary notion of calling films \"photoplays\" and seen as filmed versions of theatre, instead seeing film with \"camera-born\" opportunities. He also described cinema as \"hieroglyphic\" in the sense of containing symbols in its images. He believed this visuality gave film the potential for universal accessibility. M\u00fcnsterberg in turn noted the analogies between cinematic techniques and certain mental processes. For example, he compared the close-up to the mind paying attention. The flashback, in turn, was similar to remembering. This was later followed by the \"formalism\" of Rudolf Arnheim, who studied how techniques influenced film as art.\nAmong early French theorists, Germaine Dulac brought the concept of \"impressionism\" to film by describing cinema that explored the malleability of the border between internal experience and external reality, for example through superimposition. \"Surrealism\" also had an influence on early French film culture. The term \"photog\u00e9nie\" was important to both, having been brought to use by Louis Delluc in 1919 and becoming widespread in its usage to capture the unique power of cinema. Jean Epstein noted how filming gives a \"personality\" or a \"spirit\" to objects while also being able to reveal \"the untrue, the unreal, the 'surreal'\". This was similar to defamiliarization used by avant-garde artists to recreate the world. He saw the close-up as the essence of \"photog\u00e9nie\". B\u00e9la Bal\u00e1zs also praised the close-up for similar reasons. Arnheim also believed defamiliarization to be a critical element of film.\nAfter the Russian Revolution, a chaotic situation in the country also created a sense of excitement at new possibilities. This gave rise to montage theory in the work of Dziga Vertov and Sergei Eisenstein. After the establishment of the Moscow Film School, Lev Kuleshov set up a workshop to study the formal structure of film, focusing on editing as \"the essence of cinematography\". This produced findings on the Kuleshov effect. Editing was also associated with the foundational Marxist concept of dialectical materialism. To this end, Eisenstein claimed that \"montage is conflict\". Eisenstein's theories were focused on montage having the ability create meaning transcending the sum of its parts with a \"thematic effect\" in a way that ideograms turned graphics into abstract symbols. Multiple scenes could work to produce themes (\"tonal montage\"), while multiple themes could create even higher levels of meaning (\"intellectual montage\"). Vertov in turn focused on developing Kino-Pravda, \"film truth,\" and the Kino-Eye, which he claimed showed a deeper truth than could be seen with the naked eye.\nLater theory, after 1945.\nIn the years after World War II, the French film critic and theorist Andr\u00e9 Bazin argued that film's essence lay in its ability to mechanically reproduce reality, not in its difference from reality. This had followed the rise of \"poetic realism\" in French cinema in the 1930s. He believed that the purpose of art is to preserve reality, even famously claiming that \"The photographic image is the object itself\". Based on this, he advocated for the use of long takes and deep focus, to reveal the \"structural depth\" of reality and finding meaning objectively in images. This was soon followed by the rise of Italian neorealism. Siegfried Kracauer was also notable for arguing that realism is the most important function of cinema.\nThe Auteur theory derived from the approach of critic and filmmaker Alexandre Astruc, among others, and was originally developed in articles in \"Cahiers du Cin\u00e9ma\", a film journal that had been co-founded by Bazin. Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut issued auteurism's manifestos in two \"Cahiers\" essays: \"Une certaine tendance du cin\u00e9ma fran\u00e7ais\" (January 1954) and \"Ali Baba et la 'Politique des auteurs'\" (February 1955). His approach was brought to American criticism by Andrew Sarris in 1962. The auteur theory was based on films depicting the directors' own worldviews and impressions of the subject matter, by varying lighting, camerawork, staging, editing, and so on. Georges Sadoul deemed a film's putative \"author\" potentially even an actor, but a film indeed collaborative. Aljean Harmetz cited major control even by film executives. David Kipen's view of screenwriter as indeed main author is termed \"Schreiber theory\".\nIn the 1960s and 1970s, film theory took up residence in academia importing concepts from established disciplines like psychoanalysis, gender studies, anthropology, literary theory, semiotics and linguistics\u2014as advanced by scholars such as Christian Metz. However, not until the late 1980s or early 1990s did film theory \"per se\" achieve much prominence in American universities by displacing the prevailing humanistic, auteur theory that had dominated cinema studies and which had been focused on the practical elements of film writing, production, editing and criticism. American scholar David Bordwell has spoken against many prominent developments in film theory since the 1970s. He uses the derogatory term \"SLAB theory\" to refer to film studies based on the ideas of Ferdinand de Saussure, Jacques Lacan, Louis Althusser, and Roland Barthes. Instead, Bordwell promotes what he describes as \"neoformalism\" (a revival of formalist film theory).\nDuring the 1990s the digital revolution in image technologies has influenced film theory in various ways. There has been a refocus onto celluloid film's ability to capture an \"indexical\" image of a moment in time by theorists like Mary Ann Doane, Philip Rosen and Laura Mulvey who was informed by psychoanalysis. From a psychoanalytical perspective, after the Lacanian notion of \"the Real\", Slavoj \u017di\u017eek offered new aspects of \"the gaze\" extensively used in contemporary film analysis. From the 1990s onward the Matrixial theory of artist and psychoanalyst Bracha L. Ettinger revolutionized feminist film theory. Her concept The Matrixial Gaze, that has established a feminine gaze and has articulated its differences from the phallic gaze and its relation to feminine as well as maternal specificities and potentialities of \"coemergence\", offering a critique of Sigmund Freud's and Jacques Lacan's psychoanalysis, is extensively used in analysis of films by female authors, like Chantal Akerman, as well as by male authors, like Pedro Almodovar. The matrixial gaze offers the female the position of a subject, not of an object, of the gaze, while deconstructing the structure of the subject itself, and offers border-time, border-space and a possibility for compassion and witnessing. Ettinger's notions articulate the links between aesthetics, ethics and trauma. There has also been a historical revisiting of early cinema screenings, practices and spectatorship modes by writers Tom Gunning, Miriam Hansen and Yuri Tsivian.\nIn \"Critical Cinema: Beyond the Theory of Practice\" (2011), Clive Meyer suggests that 'cinema is a different experience to watching a film at home or in an art gallery', and argues for film theorists to re-engage the specificity of philosophical concepts for cinema as a medium distinct from others.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "10802", "revid": "7611264", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=10802", "title": "Film noir", "text": "Style of crime drama films\nFilm noir (; ) is a style of Hollywood crime drama that emphasizes cynical attitudes and motivations. The 1940s and 1950s are generally regarded as the \"classic period\" of American film noir. Film noir of this era is associated with a low-key, black-and-white visual style that has roots in German expressionist cinematography. Many of the prototypical stories and attitudes expressed in classic noir derive from the hardboiled school of crime fiction that emerged in the United States during the Great Depression, known as noir fiction. \nThe term \"film noir\", French for \"black film\" (literal) or \"dark film\" (closer meaning), was first applied to Hollywood films by French critic Nino Frank in 1946, but was unrecognized by most American film industry professionals of that era. Frank is believed to have been inspired by the French literary publishing imprint S\u00e9rie noire, founded in 1945.\nCinema historians and critics defined the category retrospectively. Before the notion was widely adopted in the 1970s, many of the classic film noirs&lt;templatestyles src=\"Citation/styles.css\"/&gt;[a] were referred to as \"melodramas\". Whether film noir qualifies as a distinct genre or whether it should be considered a filmmaking style is a matter of ongoing and heavy debate among film scholars.\nFilm noir encompasses a range of plots; common archetypical protagonists include a private investigator (\"The Big Sleep\"), a plainclothes police officer (\"The Big Heat\"), an aging boxer (\"The Set-Up\"), a hapless grifter (\"Night and the City\"), a law-abiding citizen lured into a life of crime (\"Gun Crazy\"), a femme fatale (\"Gilda\") or simply a victim of circumstance (\"D.O.A.\"). Although film noir was originally associated with American productions, the term has been used to describe films from around the world. Many films released from the 1960s onward share attributes with film noirs of the classical period, and often treat its conventions self-referentially. Latter-day works are typically referred to as neo-noir. The clich\u00e9s of film noir have inspired parody since the mid-1940s.\nDefinition.\nThe question of what defines film noir and what sort of category it is, provokes continuing debate. \"We'd be oversimplifying things in calling film noir oneiric, strange, erotic, ambivalent, and cruel\u00a0...\"\u2014this set of attributes constitutes the first of many attempts to define film noir made by French critics Raymond Borde and \u00c9tienne Chaumeton in their 1955 book \"Panorama du film noir am\u00e9ricain 1941\u20131953\" (\"A Panorama of American Film Noir\"), the original and seminal extended treatment of the subject. They emphasize that not every noir film embodies all five attributes in equal measure\u2014one might be more dreamlike; another, particularly brutal. The authors' caveats and repeated efforts at alternative definition have been echoed in subsequent scholarship, but in the words of cinema historian Mark Bould, film noir remains an \"elusive phenomenon.\"\nThough film noir is often identified with a visual style that emphasizes low-key lighting and unbalanced compositions, films commonly identified as noir evidence a variety of visual approaches, including ones that fit comfortably within the Hollywood mainstream. Film noir similarly embraces a variety of genres, from the gangster film to the police procedural to the gothic romance to the social problem picture\u2014any example of which from the 1940s and 1950s, now seen as noir's classical era, was likely to be described as a melodrama at the time.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\nIt is night, always. The hero enters a labyrinth on a quest. He is alone and off balance. He may be desperate, in flight, or coldly calculating, imagining he is the pursuer rather than the pursued.\nA woman invariably joins him at a critical juncture, when he is most vulnerable. [Her] eventual betrayal of him (or herself) is as ambiguous as her feelings about him.\n Nicholas Christopher\n, \"Somewhere in the Night\" (1997)\nWhile many critics refer to film noir as a genre itself, others argue that it can be no such thing. Foster Hirsch defines a genre as determined by \"conventions of narrative structure, characterization, theme, and visual design.\" Hirsch, as one who has taken the position that film noir is a genre, argues that these elements are present \"in abundance.\" Hirsch notes that there are unifying features of tone, visual style and narrative sufficient to classify noir as a distinct genre.\nOthers argue that film noir is not a genre. It is often associated with an urban setting, but many classic noirs take place in small towns, suburbia, rural areas, or on the open road; setting is not a determinant, as with the Western. Similarly, while the private eye and the femme fatale are stock character types conventionally identified with noir, the majority of films in the genre feature neither. Nor does film noir rely on anything as evident as the monstrous or supernatural elements of the horror film, the speculative leaps of the science fiction film, or the song-and-dance routines of the musical.\nAn analogous case is that of the screwball comedy, widely accepted by film historians as constituting a \"genre\": screwball is defined not by a fundamental attribute, but by a general disposition and a group of elements, some\u2014but rarely and perhaps never all\u2014of which are found in each of the genre's films. Because of the diversity of noir (much greater than that of the screwball comedy), certain scholars in the field, such as film historian Thomas Schatz, treat it as not a genre but a \"style\". Alain Silver, the most widely published American critic specializing in film noir studies, refers to film noir as a \"cycle\" and a \"phenomenon\", even as he argues that it has\u2014like certain genres\u2014a consistent set of visual and thematic codes. Screenwriter Eric R. Williams labels both film noir and screwball comedy a \"pathway\" in his screenwriters taxonomy; explaining that a pathway has two parts: 1) the way the audience connects with the protagonist and 2) the trajectory the audience expects the story to follow. Other critics treat film noir as a \"mood,\" a \"series\", or simply a chosen set of films they regard as belonging to the noir \"canon.\" There is no consensus on the matter.\nBackground.\nCinematic sources.\nThe aesthetics of film noir were influenced by German Expressionism, an artistic movement of the 1910s and 1920s that involved theater, music, photography, painting, sculpture and architecture, as well as cinema. The opportunities offered by the booming Hollywood film industry and then the threat of Nazism led to the emigration of many film artists working in Germany who had been involved in the Expressionist movement or studied with its practitioners. \"M\" (1931), shot only a few years before director Fritz Lang's departure from Germany, is among the first crime films of the sound era to join a characteristically noirish visual style with a noir-type plot, in which the protagonist is a criminal (as are his most successful pursuers). Directors such as Lang, Jacques Tourneur, Robert Siodmak and Michael Curtiz brought a dramatically shadowed lighting style and a psychologically expressive approach to visual composition (\"mise-en-sc\u00e8ne\") with them to Hollywood, where they made some of the most famous classic noirs.\nBy 1931, Curtiz had already been in Hollywood for half a decade, making as many as six films a year. Movies of his such as \"20,000 Years in Sing Sing\" (1932) and \"Private Detective 62\" (1933) are among the early Hollywood sound films arguably classifiable as noir\u2014scholar Marc Vernet offers the latter as evidence that dating the initiation of film noir to 1940 or any other year is \"arbitrary\". Expressionism-orientated filmmakers had free stylistic rein in Universal horror pictures such as \"Dracula\" (1931), \"The Mummy\" (1932)\u2014the former photographed and the latter directed by the Berlin-trained Karl Freund\u2014and \"The Black Cat\" (1934), directed by Austrian \u00e9migr\u00e9 Edgar G. Ulmer. The Universal horror film that comes closest to noir, in story and sensibility, is \"The Invisible Man\" (1933), directed by Englishman James Whale and photographed by American Arthur Edeson. Edeson later photographed \"The Maltese Falcon\" (1941), widely regarded as the first major film noir of the classic era.\nJosef von Sternberg was directing in Hollywood during the same period. Films of his such as \"Shanghai Express\" (1932) and \"The Devil Is a Woman\" (1935), with their hothouse eroticism and baroque visual style anticipated central elements of classic noir. The commercial and critical success of Sternberg's silent \"Underworld\" (1927) was largely responsible for spurring a trend of Hollywood gangster films. Successful films in that genre such as \"Little Caesar\" (1931), \"The Public Enemy\" (1931) and \"Scarface\" (1932) demonstrated that there was an audience for crime dramas with morally reprehensible protagonists. An important, possibly influential, cinematic antecedent to classic noir was 1930s French poetic realism, with its romantic, fatalistic attitude and celebration of doomed heroes. The movement's sensibility is mirrored in the Warner Bros. drama \"I Am a Fugitive from a Chain Gang\" (1932), a forerunner of noir. Among films not considered noir, perhaps none had a greater effect on the development of the genre than \"Citizen Kane\" (1941), directed by Orson Welles. Its visual intricacy and complex, voiceover narrative structure are echoed in dozens of classic film noirs.\nItalian neorealism of the 1940s, with its emphasis on quasi-documentary authenticity, was an acknowledged influence on trends that emerged in American noir. \"The Lost Weekend\" (1945), directed by Billy Wilder, another Vienna-born, Berlin-trained American auteur, tells the story of an alcoholic in a manner evocative of neorealism. It also exemplifies the problem of classification: one of the first American films to be described as a film noir, it has largely disappeared from considerations of the field. Director Jules Dassin of \"The Naked City\" (1948) pointed to the neorealists as inspiring his use of location photography with non-professional extras. This semidocumentary approach characterized a substantial number of noirs in the late 1940s and early 1950s. Along with neorealism, the style had an American precedent cited by Dassin, in director Henry Hathaway's \"The House on 92nd Street\" (1945), which demonstrated the parallel influence of the cinematic newsreel.\nLiterary sources.\nThe primary literary influence on film noir was the hardboiled school of American detective and crime fiction, led in its early years by such writers as Dashiell Hammett (whose first novel, \"Red Harvest\", was published in 1929) and James M. Cain (whose \"The Postman Always Rings Twice\" appeared five years later), and popularized in pulp magazines such as \"Black Mask\". The classic film noirs \"The Maltese Falcon\" (1941) and \"The Glass Key\" (1942) were based on novels by Hammett; Cain's novels provided the basis for \"Double Indemnity\" (1944), \"Mildred Pierce\" (1945), \"The Postman Always Rings Twice\" (1946), and \"Slightly Scarlet\" (1956; adapted from \"Love's Lovely Counterfeit\"). A decade before the classic era, a story by Hammett was the source for the gangster melodrama \"City Streets\" (1931), directed by Rouben Mamoulian and photographed by Lee Garmes, who worked regularly with Sternberg. Released the month before Lang's \"M\", \"City Streets\" has a claim to being the first major film noir; both its style and story had many noir characteristics.\nRaymond Chandler, who debuted as a novelist with \"The Big Sleep\" in 1939, soon became the most famous author of the hardboiled school. Not only were Chandler's novels turned into major noirs\u2014\"Murder, My Sweet\" (1944; adapted from \"Farewell, My Lovely\"), \"The Big Sleep\" (1946), and \"Lady in the Lake\" (1947)\u2014he was an important screenwriter in the genre as well, producing the scripts for \"Double Indemnity\", \"The Blue Dahlia\" (1946), and \"Strangers on a Train\" (1951). Where Chandler, like Hammett, centered most of his novels and stories on the character of the private eye, Cain featured less heroic protagonists and focused more on psychological exposition than on crime solving; the Cain approach has come to be identified with a subset of the hardboiled genre dubbed \"noir fiction\". For much of the 1940s, one of the most prolific and successful authors of this often downbeat brand of suspense tale was Cornell Woolrich (sometimes under the pseudonym George Hopley or William Irish). No writer's published work provided the basis for more noir films of the classic period than Woolrich's: thirteen in all, including \"Black Angel\" (1946), \"Deadline at Dawn\" (1946), and \"Fear in the Night\" (1947).\nAnother crucial literary source for film noir was W. R. Burnett, whose first novel to be published was \"Little Caesar\", in 1929. It was turned into a hit for Warner Bros. in 1931; the following year, Burnett was hired to write dialogue for \"Scarface\", while \"The Beast of the City\" (1932) was adapted from one of his stories. At least one important reference work identifies the latter as a film noir despite its early date. Burnett's characteristic narrative approach fell somewhere between that of the quintessential hardboiled writers and their noir fiction compatriots\u2014his protagonists were often heroic in their own way, which happened to be that of the gangster. During the classic era, his work, either as author or screenwriter, was the basis for seven films now widely regarded as noir, including three of the most famous: \"High Sierra\" (1941), \"This Gun for Hire\" (1942), and \"The Asphalt Jungle\" (1950).\nClassic period.\nOverview.\nThe 1940s and 1950s are generally regarded as the classic period of American film noir. While \"City Streets\" and other pre-WWII crime melodramas such as \"Fury\" (1936) and \"You Only Live Once\" (1937), both directed by Fritz Lang, are categorized as full-fledged noir in Alain Silver and Elizabeth Ward's film noir encyclopedia, other critics tend to describe them as \"proto-noir\" or in similar terms.\nThe film now most commonly cited as the first true film noir is \"Stranger on the Third Floor\" (1940), directed by Latvian-born, Soviet-trained Boris Ingster. Hungarian \u00e9migr\u00e9 Peter Lorre\u2014who had starred in Lang's \"M\"\u2014was top-billed, although he did not play the primary lead. (He later played secondary roles in several other formative American noirs.) Although modestly budgeted, at the high end of the B movie scale, \"Stranger on the Third Floor\" still lost its studio, RKO, US$56,000 (), almost a third of its total cost. \"Variety\" magazine found Ingster's work: \"...too studied and when original, lacks the flare [\"sic\"] to hold attention. It's a film too arty for average audiences, and too humdrum for others.\" \"Stranger on the Third Floor\" was not recognized as the beginning of a trend, let alone a new genre, for many decades.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\nWhoever went to the movies with any regularity during 1946 was caught in the midst of Hollywood's profound postwar affection for morbid drama. From January through December deep shadows, clutching hands, exploding revolvers, sadistic villains and heroines tormented with deeply rooted diseases of the mind flashed across the screen in a panting display of psychoneurosis, unsublimated sex and murder most foul.\nDonald Marshman, \"Life\" (August 25, 1947)\nMost film noirs of the classic period were similarly low- and modestly-budgeted features without major stars\u2014B movies either literally or in spirit. In this production context, writers, directors, cinematographers, and other craftsmen were relatively free from typical big-picture constraints. There was more visual experimentation than in Hollywood filmmaking as a whole: the Expressionism now closely associated with noir and the semi-documentary style that later emerged represent two very different tendencies. Narrative structures sometimes involved convoluted flashbacks uncommon in non-noir commercial productions. In terms of content, enforcement of the Production Code ensured that no film character could literally get away with murder or be seen sharing a bed with anyone but a spouse; within those bounds, however, many films now identified as noir feature plot elements and dialogue that were very risqu\u00e9 for the time.\nThematically, film noirs were most exceptional for the relative frequency with which they centered on portrayals of women of questionable virtue\u2014a focus that had become rare in Hollywood films after the mid-1930s and the end of the pre-Code era. The signal film in this vein was \"Double Indemnity\", directed by Billy Wilder; setting the mold was Barbara Stanwyck's femme fatale, Phyllis Dietrichson\u2014an apparent nod to Marlene Dietrich, who had built her extraordinary career playing such characters for Sternberg. An A-level feature, the film's commercial success and seven Oscar nominations made it probably the most influential of the early noirs. A slew of now-renowned noir \"bad girls\" followed, such as those played by Rita Hayworth in \"Gilda\" (1946), Lana Turner in \"The Postman Always Rings Twice\" (1946), Ava Gardner in \"The Killers\" (1946), and Jane Greer in \"Out of the Past\" (1947). The iconic noir counterpart to the femme fatale, the private eye, came to the fore in films such as \"The Maltese Falcon\" (1941), with Humphrey Bogart as Sam Spade, and \"Murder, My Sweet\" (1944), with Dick Powell as Philip Marlowe.\nThe prevalence of the private eye as a lead character declined in film noir of the 1950s, a period during which several critics describe the form as becoming more focused on extreme psychologies and more exaggerated in general. A prime example is \"Kiss Me Deadly\" (1955); based on a novel by Mickey Spillane, the best-selling of all the hardboiled authors, here the protagonist is a private eye, Mike Hammer. As described by Paul Schrader, \"Robert Aldrich's teasing direction carries \"noir\" to its sleaziest and most perversely erotic. Hammer overturns the underworld in search of the 'great whatsit' [which] turns out to be\u2014joke of jokes\u2014an exploding atomic bomb.\" Orson Welles's baroquely styled \"Touch of Evil\" (1958) is frequently cited as the last noir of the classic period. Some scholars believe film noir never really ended, but continued to transform even as the characteristic noir visual style began to seem dated and changing production conditions led Hollywood in different directions\u2014in this view, post-1950s films in the noir tradition are seen as part of a continuity with classic noir. A majority of critics, however, regard comparable films made outside the classic era to be something other than genuine film noir. They regard true film noir as belonging to a temporally and geographically limited cycle or period, treating subsequent films that evoke the classics as fundamentally different due to general shifts in filmmaking style and latter-day awareness of noir as a historical source for allusion. These later films are often called neo-noir.\nDirectors and the business of noir.\nWhile the inceptive noir, \"Stranger on the Third Floor\", was a B picture directed by a virtual unknown, many of the film noirs still remembered were A-list productions by well-known film makers. Debuting as a director with \"The Maltese Falcon\" (1941), John Huston followed with \"Key Largo\" (1948) and \"The Asphalt Jungle\" (1950). Opinion is divided on the noir status of several Alfred Hitchcock thrillers from the era; at least four qualify by consensus: \"Shadow of a Doubt\" (1943), \"Notorious\" (1946), \"Strangers on a Train\" (1951) and \"The Wrong Man\" (1956), Otto Preminger's success with \"Laura\" (1944) made his name and helped demonstrate noir's adaptability to a high-gloss 20th Century-Fox presentation. Among Hollywood's most celebrated directors of the era, arguably none worked more often in a noir mode than Preminger; his other noirs include \"Fallen Angel\" (1945), \"Whirlpool\" (1949), \"Where the Sidewalk Ends\" (1950) (all for Fox) and \"Angel Face\" (1952). A half-decade after \"Double Indemnity\" and \"The Lost Weekend\", Billy Wilder made \"Sunset Boulevard\" (1950) and \"Ace in the Hole\" (1951), noirs that were not so much crime dramas as satires on Hollywood and the news media respectively. \"In a Lonely Place\" (1950) was Nicholas Ray's breakthrough; his other noirs include his debut, \"They Live by Night\" (1948) and \"On Dangerous Ground\" (1952), noted for their unusually sympathetic treatment of characters alienated from the social mainstream.\nOrson Welles had notorious problems with financing but his three film noirs were well-budgeted: \"The Lady from Shanghai\" (1947) received top-level, \"prestige\" backing, while \"The Stranger\" (1946), his most conventional film, and \"Touch of Evil\" (1958), an unmistakably personal work, were funded at levels lower but still commensurate with headlining releases. Like \"The Stranger\", Fritz Lang's \"The Woman in the Window\" (1944) was a production of the independent International Pictures. Lang's follow-up, \"Scarlet Street\" (1945), was one of the few classic noirs to be officially censored: filled with erotic innuendo, it was temporarily banned in Milwaukee, Atlanta and New York State. \"Scarlet Street\" was a semi-independent, cosponsored by Universal and Lang's Diana Productions, of which the film's co-star, Joan Bennett, was the second biggest shareholder. Lang, Bennett and her husband, the Universal veteran and Diana production head Walter Wanger, made \"Secret Beyond the Door\" (1948) in similar fashion.\nBefore leaving the United States while subject to the Hollywood blacklist, Jules Dassin made two classic noirs that also straddled the major/independent line: \"Brute Force\" (1947) and the influential documentary-style \"The Naked City\" (1948) were developed by producer Mark Hellinger, who had an \"inside/outside\" contract with Universal similar to Wanger's. Years earlier, working at Warner Bros., Hellinger had produced three films for Raoul Walsh, the proto-noirs \"They Drive by Night\" (1940), \"Manpower\" (1941) and \"High Sierra\" (1941), now regarded as a seminal work in noir's development. Walsh had no great name during his half-century as a director but his noirs \"The Man I Love\" (1947), \"White Heat\" (1949) and \"The Enforcer\" (1951) had A-list stars and are seen as important examples of the cycle. Other directors associated with top-of-the-bill Hollywood film noirs include Edward Dmytryk (\"Murder, My Sweet\" (1944), \"Crossfire\" (1947))\u2014the first important noir director to fall prey to the industry blacklist\u2014as well as Henry Hathaway (\"The Dark Corner\" (1946), \"Kiss of Death\" (1947)) and John Farrow (\"The Big Clock\" (1948), \"Night Has a Thousand Eyes\" (1948)).\nMost of the Hollywood films considered to be classic noirs fall into the category of the B movie. Some were Bs in the most precise sense, produced to run on the bottom of double bills by a low-budget unit of one of the major studios or by one of the smaller Poverty Row outfits, from the relatively well-off Monogram to shakier ventures such as Producers Releasing Corporation (PRC). Jacques Tourneur had made over thirty Hollywood Bs (a few now highly regarded, most forgotten) before directing the A-level \"Out of the Past\", described by scholar Robert Ottoson as \"the \"ne plus ultra\" of forties film noir\". Movies with budgets a step up the ladder, known as \"intermediates\" by the industry, might be treated as A or B pictures depending on the circumstances. Monogram created Allied Artists in the late 1940s to focus on this sort of production. Robert Wise (\"Born to Kill\" [1947], \"The Set-Up\" [1949]) and Anthony Mann (\"T-Men\" [1947] and \"Raw Deal\" [1948]) each made a series of impressive intermediates, many of them noirs, before graduating to steady work on big-budget productions. Mann did some of his most celebrated work with cinematographer John Alton, a specialist in what James Naremore called \"hypnotic moments of light-in-darkness\". \"He Walked by Night\" (1948), shot by Alton though credited solely to Alfred Werker, directed in large part by Mann, demonstrates their technical mastery and exemplifies the late 1940s trend of \"police procedural\" crime dramas. It was released, like other Mann-Alton noirs, by the small Eagle-Lion company; it was the inspiration for the \"Dragnet\" series, which debuted on radio in 1949 and television in 1951.\nSeveral directors associated with noir built well-respected oeuvres largely at the B-movie/intermediate level. Samuel Fuller's brutal, visually energetic films such as \"Pickup on South Street\" (1953) and \"Underworld U.S.A.\" (1961) earned him a unique reputation; his advocates praise him as \"primitive\" and \"barbarous\". Joseph H. Lewis directed noirs as diverse as \"Gun Crazy\" (1950) and \"The Big Combo\" (1955). The former\u2014whose screenplay was written by the blacklisted Dalton Trumbo, disguised by a front\u2014features a bank hold-up sequence shown in an unbroken take of over three minutes that was influential. \"The Big Combo\" was shot by John Alton and took the shadowy noir style to its outer limits. The most distinctive films of Phil Karlson (\"The Phenix City Story\" [1955] and \"The Brothers Rico\" [1957]) tell stories of vice organized on a monstrous scale. The work of other directors in this tier of the industry, such as Felix E. Feist (\"The Devil Thumbs a Ride\" [1947], \"Tomorrow Is Another Day\" [1951]), has become obscure. Edgar G. Ulmer spent most of his Hollywood career working at B studios and once in a while on projects that achieved intermediate status; for the most part, on unmistakable Bs. In 1945, while at PRC, he directed a noir cult classic, \"Detour\". Ulmer's other noirs include \"Strange Illusion\" (1945), also for PRC; \"Ruthless\" (1948), for Eagle-Lion, which had acquired PRC the previous year and \"Murder Is My Beat\" (1955), for Allied Artists.\nA number of low- and modestly-budgeted noirs were made by independent, often actor-owned, companies contracting with larger studios for distribution. Serving as producer, writer, director and top-billed performer, Hugo Haas made films like \"Pickup\" (1951), \"The Other Woman\" (1954) and Jacques Tourneur, \"The Fearmakers (1958)\". It was in this way that accomplished noir actress Ida Lupino established herself as the sole female director in Hollywood during the late 1940s and much of the 1950s. She does not appear in the best-known film she directed, \"The Hitch-Hiker\" (1953), developed by her company, The Filmakers, with support and distribution by RKO. It is one of the seven classic film noirs produced largely outside of the major studios that have been chosen for the United States National Film Registry. Of the others, one was a small-studio release: \"Detour\". Four were independent productions distributed by United Artists, the \"studio without a studio\": \"Gun Crazy\"; \"Kiss Me Deadly\"; \"D.O.A.\" (1950), directed by Rudolph Mat\u00e9 and \"Sweet Smell of Success\" (1957), directed by Alexander Mackendrick. One was an independent distributed by MGM, the industry leader: \"Force of Evil\" (1948), directed by Abraham Polonsky and starring John Garfield, both of whom were blacklisted in the 1950s. Independent production usually meant restricted circumstances but \"Sweet Smell of Success\", despite the plans of the production team, was clearly not made on the cheap, though like many other cherished A-budget noirs, it might be said to have a B-movie soul.\nPerhaps no director better displayed that spirit than the German-born Robert Siodmak, who had already made a score of films before his 1940 arrival in Hollywood. Working mostly on A features, he made eight films now regarded as classic-era noir (a figure matched only by Lang and Mann). In addition to \"The Killers\", Burt Lancaster's debut and a Hellinger/Universal co-production, Siodmak's other important contributions to the genre include 1944's \"Phantom Lady\" (a top-of-the-line B and Woolrich adaptation), the ironically titled \"Christmas Holiday\" (1944), and \"Cry of the City\" (1948). \"Criss Cross\" (1949), with Lancaster again the lead, exemplifies how Siodmak brought the virtues of the B-movie to the A noir. In addition to the relatively looser constraints on character and message at lower budgets, the nature of B production lent itself to the noir style for economic reasons: dim lighting saved on electricity and helped cloak cheap sets (mist and smoke also served the cause). Night shooting was often compelled by hurried production schedules. Plots with obscure motivations and intriguingly elliptical transitions were sometimes the consequence of hastily written scripts. There was not always enough time or money to shoot every scene. In \"Criss Cross\", Siodmak achieved these effects, wrapping them around Yvonne De Carlo, who played the most understandable of femme fatales; Dan Duryea, in one of his many charismatic villain roles; and Lancaster as an ordinary laborer turned armed robber, doomed by a romantic obsession.\nOutside the United States.\nSome critics regard classic film noir as a cycle exclusive to the United States; Alain Silver and Elizabeth Ward, for example, argue, \"With the Western, film noir shares the distinction of being an indigenous American form\u00a0... a wholly American film style.\" However, although the term \"film noir\" was originally coined to describe Hollywood movies, it was an international phenomenon. Even before the beginning of the generally accepted classic period, there were films made far from Hollywood that can be seen in retrospect as film noirs, for example, the French productions \"P\u00e9p\u00e9 le Moko\" (1937), directed by Julien Duvivier, and \"Le Jour se l\u00e8ve\" (1939), directed by Marcel Carn\u00e9. In addition, Mexico experienced a vibrant film noir period from roughly 1946 to 1952, which was around the same time film noir was blossoming in the United States.\nDuring the classic period, there were many films produced in Europe, particularly in France, that share elements of style, theme, and sensibility with American film noirs and may themselves be included in the genre's canon. In certain cases, the interrelationship with Hollywood noir is obvious: American-born director Jules Dassin moved to France in the early 1950s as a result of the Hollywood blacklist, and made one of the most famous French film noirs, \"Rififi\" (1955). Other well-known French films often classified as noir include \"Quai des Orf\u00e8vres\" (1947) and \"Les Diaboliques\" (1955), both directed by Henri-Georges Clouzot. \"Casque d'Or\" (1952), \"Touchez pas au grisbi\" (1954), and \"Le Trou\" (1960) directed by Jacques Becker; and \"Ascenseur pour l'\u00e9chafaud\" (1958), directed by Louis Malle. French director Jean-Pierre Melville is widely recognized for his tragic, minimalist film noirs\u2014\"Bob le flambeur\" (1955), from the classic period, was followed by \"Le Doulos\" (1962), \"Le deuxi\u00e8me souffle\" 1966), \"Le Samoura\u00ef\" (1967), and \"Le Cercle rouge\" (1970). In the 1960s, Greek film noirs \"\"The Secret of the Red Mantle\" and \"The Fear\"\" allowed audience for an anti-ableist reading which challenged stereotypes of disability.\nScholar Andrew Spicer argues that British film noir evidences a greater debt to French poetic realism than to the expressionistic American mode of noir. Examples of British noir (sometimes described as \"Brit noir\") from the classic period include \"Brighton Rock\" (1947), directed by John Boulting; \"They Made Me a Fugitive\" (1947), directed by Alberto Cavalcanti; \"The October Man\" (1947), directed by Roy Ward Baker; \"The Small Back Room\" (1948), directed by Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger; and \"Cast a Dark Shadow\" (1955), directed by Lewis Gilbert. Terence Fisher directed several low-budget thrillers in a noir mode for Hammer Film Productions, including \"The Last Page\" (a.k.a. \"Man Bait\"; 1952), \"Stolen Face\" (1952), and \"Murder by Proxy\" (a.k.a. \"Blackout\"; 1954). Before leaving for France, Jules Dassin had been obliged by political pressure to shoot his last English-language film of the classic noir period in Great Britain: \"Night and the City\" (1950). Though it was conceived in the United States and was not only directed by an American but also stars two American actors\u2014Richard Widmark and Gene Tierney\u2014it is technically a UK production, financed by 20th Century-Fox's British subsidiary. The most famous of classic British noirs is director Carol Reed's \"The Third Man\" (1949), from a screenplay by Graham Greene. Set in Vienna immediately after World War II, it also stars two American actors, Joseph Cotten and Orson Welles, who had appeared together in \"Citizen Kane\".\nElsewhere, Italian director Luchino Visconti adapted Cain's \"The Postman Always Rings Twice\" as \"Ossessione\" (1943), regarded both as one of the great noirs and a seminal film in the development of neorealism. (This was not even the first screen version of Cain's novel, having been preceded by the French \"Le Dernier Tournant\" in 1939.) In Japan, the celebrated Akira Kurosawa directed several films recognizable as film noirs, including \"Drunken Angel\" (1948), \"Stray Dog\" (1949), \"The Bad Sleep Well\" (1960), and \"High and Low\" (1963). Spanish author Mercedes Formica's novel \"La ciudad perdida\" (The Lost City) was adapted into film in 1955.\nAmong the first major neo-noir films\u2014the term often applied to films that consciously refer back to the classic noir tradition\u2014was the French \"Tirez sur le pianiste\" (1960), directed by Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut from a novel by one of the gloomiest of American noir fiction writers, David Goodis. Noir crime films and melodramas have been produced in many countries in the post-classic area. Some of these are quintessentially self-aware neo-noirs\u2014for example, \"Il Conformista\" (1969; Italy), \"Der Amerikanische Freund\" (1977; Germany), \"The Element of Crime\" (1984; Denmark), and \"El Aura\" (2005; Argentina). Others simply share narrative elements and a version of the hardboiled sensibility associated with classic noir, such as \"Castle of Sand\" (1974; Japan), \"Insomnia\" (1997; Norway), \"Croupier\" (1998; UK), and \"Blind Shaft\" (2003; China).\nNeo-noir and echoes of the classic mode.\nThe neo-noir film genre developed mid-way into the Cold War. This cinematological trend reflected much of the cynicism and the possibility of nuclear annihilation of the era. This new genre introduced innovations that were not available to earlier noir films. The violence was also more potent.\n1960s and 1970s.\nWhile it is hard to draw a line between some of the noir films of the early 1960s such as \"Blast of Silence\" (1961) and \"Cape Fear\" (1962) and the noirs of the late 1950s, new trends emerged in the post-classic era. \"The Manchurian Candidate\" (1962), directed by John Frankenheimer, \"Shock Corridor\" (1963), directed by Samuel Fuller, and \"Brainstorm\" (1965), directed by experienced noir character actor William Conrad, all treat the theme of mental dispossession within stylistic and tonal frameworks derived from classic film noir. \"The Manchurian Candidate\" examined the situation of American prisoners of war (POWs) during the Korean War. Incidents that occurred during the war as well as those post-war functioned as an inspiration for a \"Cold War Noir\" subgenre. The television series \"The Fugitive\" (1963\u201367) brought classic noir themes and mood to the small screen for an extended run.\nIn a different vein, films began to appear that self-consciously acknowledged the conventions of classic film noir as historical archetypes to be revived, rejected, or reimagined. These efforts typify what came to be known as neo-noir. Though several late classic noirs, \"Kiss Me Deadly\" (1955) in particular, were deeply self-knowing and post-traditional in conception, none tipped its hand so evidently as to be remarked on by American critics at the time. The first major film to overtly work this angle was French director Jean-Luc Godard's \"\u00c0 bout de souffle\" (\"Breathless\"; 1960), which pays its literal respects to Bogart and his crime films while brandishing a bold new style for a new day. In the United States, Arthur Penn (1965's \"Mickey One\", drawing inspiration from Truffaut's \"Tirez sur le pianiste\" and other French New Wave films), John Boorman (1967's \"Point Blank\", similarly caught up, though in the \"Nouvelle vague\"'s deeper waters), and Alan J. Pakula (1971's \"Klute\") directed films that knowingly related themselves to the original film noirs, inviting audiences in on the game.\nA manifest affiliation with noir traditions\u2014which, by its nature, allows different sorts of commentary on them to be inferred\u2014can also provide the basis for explicit critiques of those traditions. In 1973, director Robert Altman flipped off noir piety with \"The Long Goodbye\". Based on the novel by Raymond Chandler, it features one of Bogart's most famous characters, but in iconoclastic fashion: Philip Marlowe, the prototypical hardboiled detective, is replayed as a hapless misfit, almost laughably out of touch with contemporary mores and morality. Where Altman's subversion of the film noir mythos was so irreverent as to outrage some contemporary critics, around the same time Woody Allen was paying affectionate, at points idolatrous homage to the classic mode with \"Play It Again, Sam\" (1972). The \"blaxploitation\" film \"Shaft\" (1971), wherein Richard Roundtree plays the titular African-American private eye, John Shaft, takes conventions from classic noir.\nThe most acclaimed of the neo-noirs of the era was director Roman Polanski's 1974 \"Chinatown\". Written by Robert Towne, it is set in 1930s Los Angeles, an accustomed noir locale nudged back some few years in a way that makes the pivotal loss of innocence in the story even crueler. Where Polanski and Towne raised noir to a black apogee by turning rearward, director Martin Scorsese and screenwriter Paul Schrader brought the noir attitude crashing into the present day with \"Taxi Driver\" (1976), a crackling, bloody-minded gloss on bicentennial America. In 1978, Walter Hill wrote and directed \"The Driver\", a chase film as might have been imagined by Jean-Pierre Melville in an especially abstract mood.\nHill was already a central figure in 1970s noir of a more straightforward manner, having written the script for director Sam Peckinpah's \"The Getaway\" (1972), adapting a novel by pulp master Jim Thompson, as well as for two tough private eye films: an original screenplay for \"Hickey &amp; Boggs\" (1972) and an adaptation of a novel by Ross Macdonald, the leading literary descendant of Hammett and Chandler, for \"The Drowning Pool\" (1975). Some of the strongest 1970s noirs, in fact, were unwinking remakes of the classics, \"neo\" mostly by default: the heartbreaking \"Thieves Like Us\" (1974), directed by Altman from the same source as Ray's \"They Live by Night\", and \"Farewell, My Lovely\" (1975), the Chandler tale made classically as \"Murder, My Sweet\", remade here with Robert Mitchum in his last notable noir role. Detective series, prevalent on American television during the period, updated the hardboiled tradition in different ways, but the show conjuring the most noir tone was a horror crossover touched with shaggy, \"Long Goodbye\"-style humor: \"\" (1974\u201375), featuring a Chicago newspaper reporter investigating strange, usually supernatural occurrences.\n1980s and 1990s.\nThe turn of the decade brought Scorsese's black-and-white \"Raging Bull\" (1980, cowritten by Schrader). An acknowledged masterpiece\u2014in 2007 the American Film Institute ranked it as the greatest American film of the 1980s and the fourth greatest of all time\u2014it tells the story of a boxer's moral self-destruction that recalls in both theme and visual ambiance noir dramas such as \"Body and Soul\" (1947) and \"Champion\" (1949). From 1981, \"Body Heat\", written and directed by Lawrence Kasdan, invokes a different set of classic noir elements, this time in a humid, erotically charged Florida setting. Its success confirmed the commercial viability of neo-noir at a time when the major Hollywood studios were becoming increasingly risk averse. The mainstreaming of neo-noir is evident in such films as \"Black Widow\" (1987), \"Shattered\" (1991), and \"Final Analysis\" (1992). Few neo-noirs have made more money or more wittily updated the tradition of the noir double entendre than \"Basic Instinct\" (1992), directed by Paul Verhoeven and written by Joe Eszterhas. The film also demonstrates how neo-noir's polychrome palette can reproduce many of the expressionistic effects of classic black-and-white noir.\nLike \"Chinatown\", its more complex predecessor, Curtis Hanson's Oscar-winning \"L.A. Confidential\" (1997), based on the James Ellroy novel, demonstrates the opposite tendency\u2014the deliberately retro film noir; its tale of corrupt cops and femmes fatale is seemingly lifted straight from a film of 1953, the year in which it is set. Director David Fincher followed the immensely successful neo-noir \"Seven\" (1995) with a film that developed into a cult favorite after its original, disappointing release: \"Fight Club\" (1999), a \"sui generis\" mix of noir aesthetic, perverse comedy, speculative content, and satiric intent.\nWorking generally with much smaller budgets, brothers Joel and Ethan Coen have created one of the most extensive oeuvres influenced by classic noir, with films such as \"Blood Simple\" (1984) and \"Fargo\" (1996), the latter considered by some a supreme work in the neo-noir mode. The Coens cross noir with other generic traditions in the gangster drama \"Miller's Crossing\" (1990)\u2014loosely based on the Dashiell Hammett novels \"Red Harvest\" and \"The Glass Key\"\u2014and the comedy \"The Big Lebowski\" (1998), a tribute to Chandler and an homage to Altman's version of \"The Long Goodbye\". The characteristic work of David Lynch combines film noir tropes with scenarios driven by disturbed characters such as the sociopathic criminal played by Dennis Hopper in \"Blue Velvet\" (1986) and the delusionary protagonist of \"Lost Highway\" (1997). The \"Twin Peaks\" cycle, both the TV series (1990\u201391) and a film, \"\" (1992), puts a detective plot through a succession of bizarre spasms. David Cronenberg also mixes surrealism and noir in \"Naked Lunch\" (1991), inspired by William S. Burroughs' novel.\nPerhaps no American neo-noirs better reflect the classic noir B movie spirit than those of director-writer Quentin Tarantino. Neo-noirs of his such as \"Reservoir Dogs\" (1992) and \"Pulp Fiction\" (1994) display a relentlessly self-reflexive, sometimes tongue-in-cheek sensibility, similar to the work of the New Wave directors and the Coens. Other films from the era readily identifiable as neo-noir (some retro, some more au courant) include director John Dahl's \"Kill Me Again\" (1989), \"Red Rock West\" (1992), and \"The Last Seduction\" (1993); four adaptations of novels by Jim Thompson\u2014\"The Kill-Off\" (1989), \"After Dark, My Sweet\" (1990), \"The Grifters\" (1990), and the remake of \"The Getaway\" (1994); and many more, including adaptations of the work of other major noir fiction writers: \"The Hot Spot\" (1990), from \"Hell Hath No Fury\", by Charles Williams; \"Miami Blues\" (1990), from the novel by Charles Willeford; and \"Out of Sight\" (1998), from the novel by Elmore Leonard. Several films by director-writer David Mamet involve noir elements: \"House of Games\" (1987), \"Homicide\" (1991), \"The Spanish Prisoner\" (1997), and \"Heist\" (2001). On television, \"Moonlighting\" (1985\u201389) paid homage to classic noir while demonstrating an unusual appreciation of the sense of humor often found in the original cycle. Between 1983 and 1989, Mickey Spillane's hardboiled private eye Mike Hammer was played with wry gusto by Stacy Keach in a series and several stand-alone television films (an unsuccessful revival followed in 1997\u201398). The British miniseries \"The Singing Detective\" (1986), written by Dennis Potter, tells the story of a mystery writer named Philip Marlow; widely considered one of the finest neo-noirs in any medium, some critics rank it among the greatest television productions of all time.\nNeon-noir.\nAmong big-budget auteurs, Michael Mann has worked frequently in a neo-noir mode, with such films as \"Thief\" (1981) and \"Heat\" (1995) and the TV series \"Miami Vice\" (1984\u201389) and \"Crime Story\" (1986\u201388). Mann's output exemplifies a primary strain of neo-noir, or as it is affectionately called, \"neon noir\", in which classic themes and tropes are revisited in a contemporary setting with an up-to-date visual style and rock- or hip hop-based musical soundtrack.\nNeon-noir film borrows from and reflects many of the characteristics of the film noir: the presence of crime and violence, complex characters and plot-lines, mystery, and moral ambivalence, all of which come into play in the neon-noir sub-genre. But more than just exhibiting the superficial traits of the genre, neon-noir emphasizes the socio-critique of film noir, recalling the specific socio-cultural dimensions of the interwar years when noirs first became prominent; a time of global existential crisis, depression and the mass movement of the rural population to cities. Long shots or montages of cityscapes, often portrayed as dark and menacing, are suggestive of what Dueck referred to as a \u2018bleak societal perspective\u2019, providing a critique on global capitalism and consumerism. Other characteristics include the use of highly stylized lighting techniques such chiaroscuro, and neon signs and brightly lit buildings that provide a sense of alienation and entrapment.\nAccentuating the use of artificial and neon lighting in the films-noir of the '40s and '50s, neon-noir films accentuate this aesthetic with electrifying color and manipulated light in order to highlight their socio-cultural critiques and their references to contemporary and pop culture. In doing so, neon-noir films present the themes of urban decay, consumerist decadence and capitalism, existentialism, sexuality, and issues of race and violence in the contemporary culture, not only in America, but the globalized world at large.\nNeon-noirs seek to bring the contemporary noir, somewhat diluted under the umbrella of neo-noir, back to the exploration of culture: class, race, gender, patriarchy, and capitalism. Neon-noirs present an existential exploration of society in a hyper-technological and globalized world. Illustrating society as decadent and consumerist, and identity as confused and anxious, neon-noirs reposition the contemporary noir in the setting of urban decay, often featuring scenes set in underground city haunts: brothels, nightclubs, casinos, strip bars, pawnshops, laundromats.\nNeon-noirs were popularized in the '70s and '80s by films such as \"Taxi Driver\" (1976), \"Blade Runner\" (1982), and films from David Lynch, such as \"Blue Velvet\" (1986) and later, \"Lost Highway\" (1997). Other titles from this era included Brian De Palma's \"Blow Out\" (1981) and the Coen Brothers' debut \"Blood Simple\" (1984). More currently, films such as Harmony Korine\u2019s highly provocative \"Spring Breakers\" (2012), and Danny Boyle\u2019s \"Trance\" (2013) have been especially noted for their neon-infused rendering of film noir; while \"Trance\" was celebrated for \u2018shak(ing) the ingredients (of the noir) like colored sand in a jar\u2019, \"Spring Breakers\" notoriously produced a slew of criticism referring to its \u2018fever-dream\u2019 aesthetic and \u2018neon-caked explosion of excess\u2019 (Kohn).\nNeon-noir can be seen as a response to the over-use of the term neo-noir. While the term neo-noir functions to bring noir into the contemporary landscape, it has often been criticized for its dilution of the noir genre. Author Robert Arnett commented on its \"amorphous\" reach: \"any film featuring a detective or crime qualifies\". The neon-noir, more specifically, seeks to revive noir sensibilities in a more targeted manner of reference, focalizing socio-cultural commentary and a hyper-stylized aesthetic.\n2000s and 2010s.\nThe Coen brothers make reference to the noir tradition again with \"The Man Who Wasn't There\" (2001); a black-and-white crime melodrama set in 1949; it features a scene apparently staged to mirror one from \"Out of the Past\". Lynch's \"Mulholland Drive\" (2001) continued in his characteristic vein, making the classic noir setting of Los Angeles the venue for a noir-inflected psychological jigsaw puzzle. British-born director Christopher Nolan's black-and-white debut, \"Following\" (1998), was an overt homage to classic noir. During the new century's first decade, he was one of the leading Hollywood directors of neo-noir with the acclaimed \"Memento\" (2000) and the remake of \"Insomnia\" (2002).\nDirector Sean Penn's \"The Pledge\" (2001), though adapted from a very self-reflexive novel by Friedrich D\u00fcrrenmatt, plays noir comparatively straight, to devastating effect. Screenwriter David Ayer updated the classic noir bad-cop tale, typified by \"Shield for Murder\" (1954) and \"Rogue Cop\" (1954), with his scripts for \"Training Day\" (2001) and, adapting a story by James Ellroy, \"Dark Blue\" (2002); he later wrote and directed the even darker \"Harsh Times\" (2006). Michael Mann's \"Collateral\" (2004) features a performance by Tom Cruise as an assassin in the lineage of \"Le Samoura\u00ef\". The torments of \"The Machinist\" (2004), directed by Brad Anderson, evoke both \"Fight Club\" and \"Memento\". In 2005, Shane Black directed \"Kiss Kiss Bang Bang\", basing his screenplay in part on a crime novel by Brett Halliday, who published his first stories back in the 1920s. The film plays with an awareness not only of classic noir but also of neo-noir reflexivity itself.\nWith ultra-violent films such as \"Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance\" (2002) and \"Thirst\" (2009), Park Chan-wook of South Korea has been the most prominent director outside of the United States to work regularly in a noir mode in the new millennium. The most commercially successful neo-noir of this period has been \"Sin City\" (2005), directed by Robert Rodriguez in extravagantly stylized black and white with splashes of color. The film is based on a series of comic books created by Frank Miller (credited as the film's codirector), which are in turn openly indebted to the works of Spillane and other pulp mystery authors. Similarly, graphic novels provide the basis for \"Road to Perdition\" (2002), directed by Sam Mendes, and \"A History of Violence\" (2005), directed by David Cronenberg; the latter was voted best film of the year in the annual \"Village Voice\" poll. Writer-director Rian Johnson's \"Brick\" (2005), featuring present-day high schoolers speaking a version of 1930s hardboiled argot, won the Special Jury Prize for Originality of Vision at the Sundance Film Festival. The television series \"Veronica Mars\" (2004\u201307, 2019) and the movie \"Veronica Mars\" (2014) also brought a youth-oriented twist to film noir. Examples of this sort of generic crossover have been dubbed \"teen noir\".\nNeo-noir films released in the 2010s include Kim Jee-woon\u2019s \"I Saw the Devil\" (2010), Fred Cavaye\u2019s \"Point Blank\" (2010), Na Hong-jin\u2019s \"The Yellow Sea\" (2010), Nicolas Winding Refn\u2019s \"Drive\" (2011), Claire Denis' \"Bastards\" (2013) and Dan Gilroy's \"Nightcrawler\" (2014).\n2020s.\nThe Science Channel broadcast the 2021 science documentary series \"Killers of the Cosmos\" in a format it describes as \"space noir.\" In the series, actor Aidan Gillen in animated form serves as the host of the series while portraying a private investigator who takes on \"cases\" in which he \"hunts down\" lethal threats to humanity posed by the cosmos. The animated sequences combine the characteristics of film noir with those of a pulp fiction graphic novel set in the mid-20th century, and they link conventional live-action documentary segments in which experts describe the potentially deadly phenomena.\nScience fiction noir.\nIn the post-classic era, a significant trend in noir crossovers has involved science fiction. In Jean-Luc Godard's \"Alphaville\" (1965), Lemmy Caution is the name of the old-school private eye in the city of tomorrow. \"The Groundstar Conspiracy\" (1972) centers on another implacable investigator and an amnesiac named Welles. \"Soylent Green\" (1973), the first major American example, portrays a dystopian, near-future world via a noir detection plot; starring Charlton Heston (the lead in \"Touch of Evil\"), it also features classic noir standbys Joseph Cotten, Edward G. Robinson, and Whit Bissell. The film was directed by Richard Fleischer, who two decades before had directed several strong B noirs, including \"Armored Car Robbery\" (1950) and \"The Narrow Margin\" (1952).\nThe cynical and stylized perspective of classic film noir had a formative effect on the cyberpunk genre of science fiction that emerged in the early 1980s; the film most directly influential on cyberpunk was \"Blade Runner\" (1982), directed by Ridley Scott, which pays evocative homage to the classic noir mode (Scott subsequently directed the poignant 1987 noir crime melodrama \"Someone to Watch Over Me\"). Scholar Jamaluddin Bin Aziz has observed how \"the shadow of Philip Marlowe lingers on\" in such other \"future noir\" films as \"12 Monkeys\" (1995), \"Dark City\" (1998) and \"Minority Report\" (2002). Fincher's feature debut was \"Alien 3\" (1992), which evoked the classic noir jail film \"Brute Force\".\nDavid Cronenberg's \"Crash\" (1996), an adaptation of the speculative novel by J. G. Ballard, has been described as a \"film noir in bruise tones\". The hero is the target of investigation in \"Gattaca\" (1997), which fuses film noir motifs with a scenario indebted to \"Brave New World\". \"The Thirteenth Floor\" (1999), like \"Blade Runner\", is an explicit homage to classic noir, in this case involving speculations about virtual reality. Science fiction, noir, and anime are brought together in the Japanese films of 90s \"Ghost in the Shell\" (1995) and \"\" (2004), both directed by Mamoru Oshii. \"The Animatrix\" (2003), based on and set within the world of \"The Matrix\" film trilogy, contains an anime short film in classic noir style titled \"A Detective Story\". Anime television series with science fiction noir themes include \"Noir\" (2001) and \"Cowboy Bebop\" (1998).\nThe 2015 film \"Ex Machina\" puts an understated film noir spin on the Frankenstein mythos, with the sentient android Ava as a potential \"femme fatale\", her creator Nathan embodying the abusive husband or father trope, and her would-be rescuer Caleb as a \"clueless drifter\" enthralled by Ava.\nRural/outback noir.\nA sub-genre of noir fiction has been named \"rural noir\" in the US; and sometimes \"outback noir\" in Australia. Many rural noir novels have been adapted for film and TV series in both countries, such as \"Ozark\", \"No Country for Old Men\", and \"Big Sky\" in the US, and \"Troppo\", \"The Dry\" (and its sequel \"\"), \"Scrublands\", and \"High Country\" (2024) in Australia.\nIn Australia, outback noir increasingly includes issues relating to Indigenous Australians, such as the dispossession of land from Aboriginal peoples and racism. Filmmaker Ivan Sen is known for his exploration of such themes in his \"Mystery Road\" TV series and film of the same name with its prequel \"Goldstone\", and his more recent award-winning film \"Limbo\" (2023).\nParodies.\nFilm noir has been parodied many times in many manners. In 1945, Danny Kaye starred in what appears to be the first intentional film noir parody, \"Wonder Man\". That same year, Deanna Durbin was the singing lead in the comedic noir \"Lady on a Train\", which makes fun of Woolrich-brand wistful miserablism. Bob Hope inaugurated the private-eye noir parody with \"My Favorite Brunette\" (1947), playing a baby-photographer who is mistaken for an ironfisted detective. In 1947 as well, The Bowery Boys appeared in \"Hard Boiled Mahoney\", which had a similar mistaken-identity plot; they spoofed the genre once more in \"Private Eyes\" (1953). Two RKO productions starring Robert Mitchum take film noir over the border into self-parody: \"The Big Steal\" (1949), directed by Don Siegel, and \"His Kind of Woman\" (1951).&lt;templatestyles src=\"Citation/styles.css\"/&gt;[b] The \"Girl Hunt\" ballet in Vincente Minnelli's \"The Band Wagon\" (1953) is a ten-minute distillation of\u2014and play on\u2014noir in dance. \"The Cheap Detective\" (1978), starring Peter Falk, is a broad spoof of several films, including the Bogart classics \"The Maltese Falcon\" and \"Casablanca\". Carl Reiner's black-and-white \"Dead Men Don't Wear Plaid\" (1982) appropriates clips of classic noirs for a farcical pastiche, while his \"Fatal Instinct\" (1993) sends up noir classic (\"Double Indemnity\") and neo-noir (\"Basic Instinct\"). Robert Zemeckis's \"Who Framed Roger Rabbit\" (1988) develops a noir plot set in 1940s Los Angeles around a host of cartoon characters.\nNoir parodies come in darker tones as well. \"Murder by Contract\" (1958), directed by Irving Lerner, is a deadpan joke on noir, with a denouement as bleak as any of the films it kids. An ultra-low-budget Columbia Pictures production, it may qualify as the first intentional example of what is now called a neo-noir film; it was likely a source of inspiration for both Melville's \"Le Samoura\u00ef\" and Scorsese's \"Taxi Driver\". Belying its parodic strain, \"The Long Goodbye\"'s final act is seriously grave. \"Taxi Driver\" caustically deconstructs the \"dark\" crime film, taking it to an absurd extreme and then offering a conclusion that manages to mock every possible anticipated ending\u2014triumphant, tragic, artfully ambivalent\u2014while being each, all at once. Flirting with splatter status even more brazenly, the Coens' \"Blood Simple\" is both an exacting pastiche and a gross exaggeration of classic noir. Adapted by director Robinson Devor from a novel by Charles Willeford, \"The Woman Chaser\" (1999) sends up not just the noir mode but the entire Hollywood filmmaking process, with each shot seemingly staged as the visual equivalent of an acerbic Marlowe wisecrack.\nIn other media, the television series \"Sledge Hammer!\" (1986\u201388) lampoons noir, along with such topics as capital punishment, gun fetishism, and Dirty Harry. \"Sesame Street\" (1969\u2013curr.) occasionally casts Kermit the Frog as a private eye; the sketches refer to some of the typical motifs of noir films, in particular the voiceover. Garrison Keillor's radio program \"A Prairie Home Companion\" features the recurring character Guy Noir, a hardboiled detective whose adventures always wander into farce (Guy also appears in the Altman-directed film based on Keillor's show). Firesign Theatre's Nick Danger has trodden the same not-so-mean streets, both on radio and in comedy albums. Cartoons such as \"Garfield's Babes and Bullets\" (1989) and comic strip characters such as Tracer Bullet of \"Calvin and Hobbes\" have parodied both film noir and the kindred hardboiled tradition\u2014one of the sources from which film noir sprang and which it now overshadows. \"It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia\" parodied the noir genre in its season 14 episode \"The Janitor Always Mops Twice.\"\nIdentifying characteristics.\nIn their original 1955 canon of film noir, Raymond Borde and Etienne Chaumeton identified twenty-two Hollywood films released between 1941 and 1952 as core examples; they listed another fifty-nine American films from the period as significantly related to the field of noir. A half-century later, film historians and critics had come to agree on a canon of approximately three hundred films from 1940 to 1958. There remain, however, many differences of opinion over whether other films of the era, among them a number of well-known ones, qualify as film noirs or not. For instance, \"The Night of the Hunter\" (1955), starring Robert Mitchum in an acclaimed performance, is treated as a film noir by some critics, but not by others. Some critics include \"Suspicion\" (1941), directed by Alfred Hitchcock, in their catalogues of noir; others ignore it. Concerning films made either before or after the classic period, or outside of the United States at any time, consensus is even rarer.\nTo support their categorization of certain films as noirs and their rejection of others, many critics refer to a set of elements they see as marking examples of the mode. The question of what constitutes the set of noir's identifying characteristics is a fundamental source of controversy. For instance, critics tend to define the model film noir as having a tragic or bleak conclusion, but many acknowledged classics of the genre have clearly happy endings (e.g., \"Stranger on the Third Floor,\" \"The Big Sleep\", \"Dark Passage\", and \"The Dark Corner\"), while the tone of many other noir denouements is ambivalent. Some critics perceive classic noir's hallmark as a distinctive visual style. Others, observing that there is actually considerable stylistic variety among noirs, instead emphasize plot and character type. Still others focus on mood and attitude. No survey of classic noir's identifying characteristics can therefore be considered definitive. In the 1990s and 2000s, critics have increasingly turned their attention to that diverse field of films called neo-noir; once again, there is even less consensus about the defining attributes of such films made outside the classic period. Roger Ebert offered \"A Guide to Film Noir\", writing that \"Film noir is...\nVisual style.\nThe low-key lighting schemes of many classic film noirs are associated with stark light/dark contrasts and dramatic shadow patterning\u2014a style known as chiaroscuro (a term adopted from Renaissance painting).&lt;templatestyles src=\"Citation/styles.css\"/&gt;[c] The shadows of Venetian blinds or banister rods, cast upon an actor, a wall, or an entire set, are an iconic visual in noir and had already become a clich\u00e9 well before the neo-noir era. Characters' faces may be partially or wholly obscured by darkness\u2014a relative rarity in conventional Hollywood filmmaking. While black-and-white cinematography is considered by many to be one of the essential attributes of classic noir, the color films \"Leave Her to Heaven\" (1945) and \"Niagara\" (1953) are routinely included in noir filmographies, while \"Slightly Scarlet\" (1956), \"Party Girl\" (1958), and \"Vertigo\" (1958) are classified as noir by varying numbers of critics.\nFilm noir is also known for its use of low-angle, wide-angle, and skewed, or Dutch angle shots. Other devices of disorientation relatively common in film noir include shots of people reflected in one or more mirrors, shots through curved or frosted glass or other distorting objects (such as during the strangulation scene in \"Strangers on a Train\"), and special effects sequences of a sometimes bizarre nature. Night-for-night shooting, as opposed to the Hollywood norm of day-for-night, was often employed. From the mid-1940s forward, location shooting became increasingly frequent in noir.\nIn an analysis of the visual approach of \"Kiss Me Deadly\", a late and self-consciously stylized example of classic noir, critic Alain Silver describes how cinematographic choices emphasize the story's themes and mood. In one scene, the characters, seen through a \"confusion of angular shapes\", thus appear \"caught in a tangible vortex or enclosed in a trap.\" Silver makes a case for how \"side light is used\u00a0... to reflect character ambivalence\", while shots of characters in which they are lit from below \"conform to a convention of visual expression which associates shadows cast upward of the face with the unnatural and ominous\".\nCertain technological advancements in film stock allowed for film noir to achieve its distinctive look. Beginning in 1935, Eastman Kodak released a new, higher-speed film stock, which found particular usage in documentary/newsreel-types of filmmaking where on-location shooting was required. Cinematographers soon caught on to the potential for this new technology and began using it. The advantage of this new film stock was that, because it captured light faster, the film cells could effectively absorb more light with each exposure, eliminating the need to flood the set with light. Thus, cinematographers could be far more expressive in their lighting, allowing for darker scenes dominated by shadows. However, by the 1950s, the very unstable nitrate film stock was universally replaced with the far more stable acetate \"safety film.\" The trade-off, however, was that this film stock produced an image with significantly less contrast. Thus, the high-contrast, black-and-white imagery that was essential to film noir effectively disappeared with the more greyscale imagery of the acetate, and it forced the other elements of film noir to be emphasized.\nStructure and narrational devices.\nFilm noirs tend to have unusually convoluted story lines, frequently involving flashbacks and other editing techniques that disrupt and sometimes obscure the narrative sequence. Framing the entire primary narrative as a flashback is also a standard device. Voiceover narration, sometimes used as a structuring device, came to be seen as a noir hallmark; while classic noir is generally associated with first-person narration (i.e., by the protagonist), Stephen Neale notes that third-person narration is common among noirs of the semidocumentary style. Neo-noirs as varied as \"The Element of Crime\" (surrealist), \"After Dark, My Sweet\" (retro), and \"Kiss Kiss Bang Bang\" (meta) have employed the flashback/voiceover combination.\nBold experiments in cinematic storytelling were sometimes attempted during the classic era: \"Lady in the Lake\", for example, is shot entirely from the point of view of protagonist Philip Marlowe; the face of star (and director) Robert Montgomery is seen only in mirrors. \"The Chase\" (1946) takes oneirism and fatalism as the basis for its fantastical narrative system, redolent of certain horror stories, but with little precedent in the context of a putatively realistic genre. In their different ways, both \"Sunset Boulevard\" and \"D.O.A.\" are tales told by dead men. Latter-day noir has been in the forefront of structural experimentation in popular cinema, as exemplified by such films as \"Pulp Fiction\", \"Fight Club\", and \"Memento\".\nPlots, characters, and settings.\nCrime, usually murder, is an element of almost all film noirs; in addition to standard-issue greed, jealousy is frequently the criminal motivation. A crime investigation\u2014by a private eye, a police detective (sometimes acting alone), or a concerned amateur\u2014is the most prevalent, but far from dominant, basic plot. In other common plots the protagonists are implicated in heists or con games, or in murderous conspiracies often involving adulterous affairs. False suspicions and accusations of crime are frequent plot elements, as are betrayals and double-crosses. According to J. David Slocum, \"protagonists assume the literal identities of dead men in nearly fifteen percent of all noir.\" Amnesia is fairly epidemic\u2014\"noir's version of the common cold\", in the words of film historian Lee Server.\nFilm noirs tend to revolve around heroes who are more flawed and morally questionable than the norm, often fall guys of one sort or another. The characteristic protagonists of noir are described by many critics as \"alienated\"; in the words of Silver and Ward, \"filled with existential bitterness\". Certain archetypal characters appear in many film noirs\u2014hardboiled detectives, femme fatales, corrupt policemen, jealous husbands, intrepid claims adjusters, and down-and-out writers. Among characters of every stripe, cigarette smoking is rampant. From historical commentators to neo-noir pictures to pop culture ephemera, the private eye and the femme fatale have been adopted as the quintessential film noir figures, though they do not appear in most films now regarded as classic noir. Of the twenty-six National Film Registry noirs, in only four does the star play a private eye: \"The Maltese Falcon\", \"The Big Sleep\", \"Out of the Past\", and \"Kiss Me Deadly\". Just four others readily qualify as detective stories: \"Laura\", \"The Killers\", \"The Naked City\", and \"Touch of Evil\". There is usually an element of drug or alcohol use, particularly as part of the detective's method to solving the crime, as an example the character of Mike Hammer in the 1955 film \"Kiss Me Deadly\" who walks into a bar saying \"Give me a double bourbon, and leave the bottle\". Chaumeton and Borde have argued that film noir grew out of the \"literature of drugs and alcohol\".\nFilm noir is often associated with an urban setting, and a few cities\u2014Los Angeles, San Francisco, New York, and Chicago, in particular\u2014are the location of many of the classic films. In the eyes of many critics, the city is presented in noir as a \"labyrinth\" or \"maze\". Bars, lounges, nightclubs, and gambling dens are frequently the scene of action. The climaxes of a substantial number of film noirs take place in visually complex, often industrial settings, such as refineries, factories, trainyards, power plants\u2014most famously the explosive conclusion of \"White Heat\", set at a chemical plant. In the popular (and, frequently enough, critical) imagination, in noir it is always night and it always raining.\nA substantial trend within latter-day noir\u2014dubbed \"film soleil\" by critic D. K. Holm\u2014heads in precisely the opposite direction, with tales of deception, seduction, and corruption exploiting bright, sun-baked settings, stereotypically the desert or open water, to searing effect. Significant predecessors from the classic and early post-classic eras include \"The Lady from Shanghai\"; the Robert Ryan vehicle \"Inferno\" (1953); the French adaptation of Patricia Highsmith's \"The Talented Mr. Ripley\", \"Plein soleil\" (\"Purple Noon\" in the United States, more accurately rendered elsewhere as \"Blazing Sun\" or \"Full Sun\"; 1960); and director Don Siegel's version of \"The Killers\" (1964). The tendency was at its peak during the late 1980s and 1990s, with films such as \"Dead Calm\" (1989), \"After Dark, My Sweet\" (1990), \"The Hot Spot\" (1990), \"Delusion\" (1991), \"Red Rock West\" (1993) and the television series \"Miami Vice\".\nWorldview, morality, and tone.\nFilm noir is often described as essentially pessimistic. The noir stories that are regarded as most characteristic tell of people trapped in unwanted situations (which, in general, they did not cause but are responsible for exacerbating), striving against random, uncaring fate, and are frequently doomed. The films are seen as depicting a world that is inherently corrupt. Classic film noir has been associated by many critics with the American social landscape of the era\u2014in particular, with a sense of heightened anxiety and alienation that is said to have followed World War II. In author Nicholas Christopher's opinion, \"it is as if the war, and the social eruptions in its aftermath, unleashed demons that had been bottled up in the national psyche.\" Film noirs, especially those of the 1950s and the height of the Red Scare, are often said to reflect cultural paranoia; \"Kiss Me Deadly\" is the noir most frequently marshaled as evidence for this claim.\nFilm noir is often said to be defined by \"moral ambiguity\", yet the Production Code obliged almost all classic noirs to see that steadfast virtue was ultimately rewarded and vice, in the absence of shame and redemption, severely punished (however dramatically incredible the final rendering of mandatory justice might be). A substantial number of latter-day noirs flout such conventions: vice emerges triumphant in films as varied as the grim \"Chinatown\" and the ribald \"Hot Spot\".\nThe tone of film noir is generally regarded as downbeat; some critics experience it as darker still\u2014\"overwhelmingly black\", according to Robert Ottoson. Influential critic (and filmmaker) Paul Schrader wrote in a seminal 1972 essay that \"\"film noir\" is defined by tone\", a tone he seems to perceive as \"hopeless\". In describing the adaptation of \"Double Indemnity,\" noir analyst Foster Hirsch describes the \"requisite hopeless tone\" achieved by the filmmakers, which appears to characterize his view of noir as a whole. On the other hand, definitive film noirs such as \"The Big Sleep\", \"The Lady from Shanghai\", \"Scarlet Street\" and \"Double Indemnity\" itself are famed for their hardboiled repartee, often imbued with sexual innuendo and self-reflexive humor.\nMusic.\nThe music of film noir was typically orchestral, per the Hollywood norm, but often with added dissonance. Many of the prime composers, like the directors and cameramen, were European \u00e9migr\u00e9s, e.g., Max Steiner (\"The Big Sleep\", \"Mildred Pierce\"), Mikl\u00f3s R\u00f3zsa (\"Double Indemnity\", \"The Killers\", \"Criss Cross\"), and Franz Waxman (\"Fury\", \"Sunset Boulevard\", \"Night and the City\"). \"Double Indemnity\" is a seminal score, initially disliked by Paramount's music director for its harshness but strongly endorsed by director Billy Wilder and studio chief Buddy DeSylva. There is a widespread popular impression that \"sleazy\" jazz saxophone and pizzicato bass constitute the sound of noir, but those characteristics arose much later, as in the late-1950s music of Henry Mancini for \"Touch of Evil\" and television's \"Peter Gunn\". Bernard Herrmann's score for \"Taxi Driver\" makes heavy use of saxophone.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSuggested reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "10803", "revid": "39191556", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=10803", "title": "Finno-Ugric languages", "text": "Disputed subdivision of the Uralic languages\nFinno-Ugric () is a traditional linguistic grouping of all languages in the Uralic language family except for the Samoyedic languages. Its once commonly accepted status as a subfamily of Uralic is based on criteria formulated in the 19th century and is criticized by contemporary linguists such as Tapani Salminen and Ante Aikio. The three most spoken Uralic languages, Hungarian, Finnish, and Estonian, are all included in Finno-Ugric.\nThe term \"Finno-Ugric\", which originally referred to the entire family, is occasionally used as a synonym for the term \"Uralic\", which includes the Samoyedic languages, as commonly happens when a language family is expanded with further discoveries. Before the 20th century, the language family might be referred to as \"Finnish\", \"Ugric\", \"Finno-Hungarian\" or with a variety of other names. The name \"Finno-Ugric\" came into general use in the late 19th or early 20th century.\nStatus.\nThe validity of Finno-Ugric as a phylogenic grouping is currently disputed, with some linguists maintaining that the Finno-Permic languages are as distinct from the Ugric languages as they are from the Samoyedic languages spoken in Siberia, or even that none of the Finno-Ugric, Finno-Permic, or Ugric branches has been established. Received opinion is that the easternmost (and last discovered) Samoyed had separated first and the branching into Ugric and Finno-Permic took place later, but this reconstruction does not have strong support in the linguistic data.\nOrigins.\nAttempts at reconstructing a Proto-Finno-Ugric proto-language, a common ancestor of all Uralic languages except for the Samoyedic languages, are largely indistinguishable from Proto-Uralic, suggesting that Finno-Ugric might not be a historical grouping but a geographical one, with Samoyedic being distinct by lexical borrowing rather than actually being historically divergent. It has been proposed that the area in which Proto-Finno-Ugric was spoken reached between the Baltic Sea and the Ural Mountains.\nTraditionally, the main set of evidence for the genetic proposal of Proto-Finno-Ugric has come from vocabulary. A large amount of vocabulary (e.g. the numerals \"one\", \"three\", \"four\" and \"six\"; the body-part terms \"hand\", \"head\") is only reconstructed up to the Proto-Finno-Ugric level, and only words with a Samoyedic equivalent have been reconstructed for Proto-Uralic. That methodology has been criticised, as no coherent explanation other than inheritance has been presented for the origin of most of the Finno-Ugric vocabulary (though a small number has been explained as old loanwords from Indo-Iranian languages or perhaps other Indo-European languages).\nThe Samoyedic group has undergone a longer period of independent development, and its divergent vocabulary could be caused by mechanisms of replacement such as language contact. (The Finno-Ugric group is usually dated to approximately 4,000 years ago, the Samoyedic a little over 2,000.) Proponents of the traditional binary division note, however, that the invocation of extensive contact influence on vocabulary is at odds with the grammatical conservatism of Samoyedic.\nThe consonant \"*\u0161\" (voiceless postalveolar fricative, ) has not been conclusively shown to occur in the traditional Proto-Uralic lexicon, but it is attested in some of the Proto-Finno-Ugric material. Another feature attested in the Finno-Ugric vocabulary is that \"*i\" now behaves as a neutral vowel with respect to front-back vowel harmony, and thus there are roots such as \"*niwa-\" \"to remove the hair from hides\".\nRegular sound changes proposed for this stage are few and remain open to interpretation. Sammallahti (1988) proposes five, following Janhunen's (1981) reconstruction of Proto-Finno-Permic:\nSammallahti (1988) further reconstructs sound changes \"*oo\", \"*ee\" \u2192 \"*a\", \"*\u00e4\" (merging with original \"*a\", \"*\u00e4\") for the development from Proto-Finno-Ugric to Proto-Ugric. Similar sound laws are required for other languages as well. Thus, the origin and raising of long vowels may actually belong at a later stage, and the development of these words from Proto-Uralic to Proto-Ugric can be summarized as simple loss of \"*x\" (if it existed in the first place at all; vowel length only surfaces consistently in the Baltic-Finnic languages.) The proposed raising of \"*o\" has been alternatively interpreted instead as a lowering \"*u\" \u2192 \"*o\" in Samoyedic (PU *\"lumi\" \u2192 \"*lom\u0259\" \u2192 Proto-Samoyedic \"*jom\").\nJanhunen (2007, 2009) notes a number of derivational innovations in Finno-Ugric, including \"*\u0144oma\" \"hare\" \u2192 \"*\u0144oma-la\", (vs. Samoyedic \"*\u0144om\u00e5\"), \"*pexli\" \"side\" \u2192 \"*peel-ka\" \u2192 \"*pelka\" \"thumb\", though involving Proto-Uralic derivational elements.\nStructural features.\nThe Finno-Ugric group is not typologically distinct from Uralic as a whole: the most widespread structural features among the group all extend to the Samoyedic languages as well.\nCommon vocabulary.\nLoanwords.\nOne argument in favor of the Finno-Ugric grouping has come from loanwords. Several loans from the Indo-Iranian languages are present in most or all of the Finno-Ugric branches, while being absent from Samoyedic. However, the majority of them have irregular sound correspondences and have a limited distribution, suggesting that they were borrowed after Uralic had already diversified into its nine branches.\nNumbers.\nThe number systems among the Finno-Ugric languages are particularly distinct from the Samoyedic languages: only the numerals \"2\", \"5\", and \"7\" have cognates in Samoyedic, while also the numerals, \"1\", \"3\", \"4\", \"6\", \"10\" are shared by all or most Finno-Ugric languages.\nBelow are the numbers 1 to 10 in several Finno-Ugric languages. Forms in \"italic\" do not descend from the reconstructed forms.\nThe number '2' descends in Ugric from a front-vocalic variant *kekt\u00e4.\nThe numbers '9' and '8' in Finnic through Mari are considered to be derived from the numbers '1' and '2' as '10\u20131' and '10\u20132'. One reconstruction is *\"yk+teksa\" and *\"kak+teksa\", respectively, where *\"teksa\" cf. \"deka\" is an Indo-European loan; the difference between /t/ and /d/ is not phonemic, unlike in Indo-European. Another analysis is *\"ykt-e-ksa\", *\"kakt-e-ksa\", with *\"e\" being the negative verb.\nFinno-Ugric Swadesh lists.\n100-word Swadesh lists for certain Finno-Ugric languages can be compared and contrasted at the Rosetta Project website:\nhttps://, https://, https://, and https://.\nSpeakers.\nThe four largest ethnic groups that speak Finno-Ugric languages are the Hungarians (14.5 million), Finns (6.5 million), Estonians (1.1 million), and Mordvins (0.85 million). Majorities of three (the Hungarians, Finns, and Estonians) inhabit their respective nation states in Europe, i.e. Hungary, Finland, and Estonia, while a large minority of Mordvins inhabit the federal Mordovian Republic within Russia (Russian Federation).\nThe indigenous area of the S\u00e1mi people is known as S\u00e1pmi and it consists of the northern parts of the Fennoscandian Peninsula. Some other peoples that speak Finno-Ugric languages have been assigned formerly autonomous republics within Russia. These are the Karelians (Republic of Karelia), Komi (Komi Republic), Udmurts (Udmurt Republic) and Mari (Mari El Republic). The Khanty-Mansi Autonomous Okrug was set up for the Khanty and Mansi of Russia. A once-autonomous Komi-Permyak Okrug was set up for a region of high Komi habitation outside the Komi Republic.\nSome of the ethnicities speaking Finno-Ugric languages are:\nInternational Finno-Ugric societies.\nIn the Finno-Ugric countries of Finland, Estonia and Hungary that find themselves surrounded by speakers of unrelated tongues, language origins and language history have long been relevant to national identity. In 1992, the 1st \"World Congress of Finno-Ugric Peoples\" was organized in Syktyvkar in the Komi Republic in Russia, the 2nd World Congress in 1996 in Budapest in Hungary, the 3rd Congress in 2000 in Helsinki in Finland, the 4th Congress in 2004 in Tallinn in Estonia, the 5th Congress in 2008 in Khanty-Mansiysk in Russia, the 6th Congress in 2012 in Si\u00f3fok in Hungary, the 7th Congress in 2016 in Lahti in Finland, and the 8th Congress in 2021 in Tartu in Estonia. The members of the Finno-Ugric Peoples' Consultative Committee include: the Erzyas, Estonians, Finns, Hungarians, Ingrian Finns, Ingrians, Karelians, Khants, Komis, Mansis, Maris, Mokshas, Nenetses, Permian Komis, Saamis, Tver Karelians, Udmurts, Vepsians; Observers: Livonians, Setos.\nIn 2007, the 1st \"Festival of the Finno-Ugric Peoples\" was hosted by President Vladimir Putin of Russia, and visited by Finnish President, Tarja Halonen, and Hungarian Prime Minister, Ferenc Gyurcs\u00e1ny.\nThe International Finno-Ugric Students' Conference (IFUSCO) is organised annually by students of Finno-Ugric languages to bring together people from all over the world who are interested in the languages and cultures. The first conference was held in 1984 in G\u00f6ttingen in Germany. IFUSCO features presentations and workshops on topics such as linguistics, ethnography, history and more.\nThe International Congress for Finno-Ugric Studies is the largest scientific meeting of scientists studying the culture and languages of Finno-Ugric peoples, held every five years. The first congress was organized in 1960 in Budapest, the last congress took place in 2022 in Vienna, the next congress is planned to be held in Tartu, Estonia, in 2025.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "10808", "revid": "50977933", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=10808", "title": "Freestyle music", "text": "Electronic dance music genre\nFreestyle music, also known as Freestyle, Latin freestyle or Latin hip-hop, and sometimes Latin Rap is a form of electronic dance music that emerged in the New York metropolitan area, Philadelphia, and Miami, primarily among second generation Hispanic Americans and Italian Americans. \nAn important precursor to freestyle is 1982's \"Planet Rock\" by Afrika Bambaataa &amp; Soul Sonic Force. Shannon's 1983 hit \"Let the Music Play\" is often considered the first freestyle song and the first major song recorded by a Latin American artist is \"Please Don't Go\" by Nayobe from 1984. From there, freestyle gained a large presence in American clubs, especially in New York and Miami. Radio airplay followed in the mid-1980s.\nPerformers such as Expos\u00e9, Lisa Lisa and Cult Jam, Stevie B and Sweet Sensation gained mainstream chart success with the genre in the late 1980s and early 1990s, but its popularity largely faded by the end of the decade. Both classic and newer freestyle output remain popular as a niche genre in Brazil (where it is an influence on \"funk carioca\"), Germany and Canada.\nHistory.\n1982\u20131987: Origin.\nFreestyle music developed in the early 1980s, primarily simultaneously in the Hispanic (mainly Puerto Rican/Latin) communities of Upper Manhattan, Brooklyn, and The Bronx and in the Italian-American communities in Brooklyn, the Bronx, other boroughs of New York City, New Jersey, Westchester County and Long Island. It initially was a fusion of synthetic instrumentation and syncopated percussion of 1980s electro, as favored by fans of breakdancing. Sampling, as found in synth-pop music and hip-hop, was incorporated. Key influences include Afrika Bambaataa &amp; Soul Sonic Force's \"Planet Rock\" (1982) and Shannon's \"Let the Music Play\" (1983), the latter was a top-ten \"Billboard\" Hot 100 hit. \nIn 1984, a Latin presence was established when the first song recorded in the genre by a Latin American artist, \"Please Don't Go\", by newcomer Nayobe (a singer from Brooklyn and of Cuban descent) was recorded and released. The song became a success, reaching No. 23 on the \"Billboard\" Hot Dance Music/Club Play chart. In 1985, a Spanish version of the song was released with the title \"No Te Vayas\". By 1987, freestyle began getting more airplay on American pop radio stations. Songs such as \"Come Go with Me\" by Expos\u00e9, \"Show Me\" by the Cover Girls, \"Fascinated\" by Company B, \"Silent Morning\" by Noel, and \"Catch Me (I'm Falling)\" by Pretty Poison, brought freestyle into the mainstream. House music, based partly on disco rhythms, was by 1992 challenging the relatively upbeat, syncopated freestyle sound. Pitchfork considers the Miami Mix of ABC's single \"When Smokey Sings\" to be proto-freestyle, despite that version being released in 1987. \nMany early or popular freestyle artists and DJs were of Hispanic or Italian descent, including Jellybean, Tony Torres, Raul Soto, Roman Ricardo, Mickey Garcia (who is of both Italian and Puerto Rican descent), Lil Suzy, and Nocera, which was one reason for the style's popularity among Hispanic Americans and Italian Americans in the New York City area and Philadelphia.\n1988: Pop crossover.\nFreestyle's Top 40 Radio airplay started to really take off by 1987, and it began to disappear from the airwaves in the early 1990s as radio stations moved to Top 40-only formats. Artists such as George Lamond, Expos\u00e9, Sweet Sensation, and Stevie B were still heard on mainstream radio, but other notable freestyle artists did not fare as well. Carlos Berrios and Platinum producer Frankie Cutlass used a freestyle production on \"Temptation\" by Corina and \"Together Forever\" by Lisette Melendez. The songs were released in 1991, almost simultaneously, and caused a resurgence in the style when they were embraced by Top 40 radio. \"Temptation\" reached the number 6 spot on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 Chart. These hits were followed by the success of Lisa Lisa and Cult Jam, who had been one of the earliest freestyle acts. Their records were produced by Full Force, who had also worked with UTFO and James Brown.\nSeveral primarily freestyle artists released ballads during the 1980s and early 1990s that crossed over to the pop charts and charted higher than their previous work. These include \"Seasons Change\" by Expos\u00e9, \"Thinking of You\" by Sa-Fire, \"One More Try\" by Timmy T, \"Because I Love You (The Postman Song)\" by Stevie B, and \"If Wishes Came True\" by Sweet Sensation. Brenda K. Starr reached the Hot 100 with her ballad \"I Still Believe\". Freestyle shortly thereafter gave way to mainstream pop artists such as MC Hammer, Paula Abdul, Bobby Brown, New Kids on the Block, and Milli Vanilli (with some artists utilizing elements of freestyle beginning in the 1980s) using hip hop beats and electro samples in a mainstream form with slicker production and MTV-friendly videos. These artists were successful on crossover stations as well as R&amp;B stations, and freestyle was replaced as an underground genre by newer styles such as new jack swing, trance and Eurodance. Despite this, some freestyle acts managed to garner hits well into the 1990s, with acts such as Cynthia and Rockell scoring minor hits on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 as late as 1998. As this new music style took over many big cities in America, the labels that signed these artists such as Columbia, Warner Bros, and other labels did not know how to market these artists originally. Instead of pushing this style of music as a solidified sound, the labels separated the cities. This caused the Miami sound of freestyle music to be more popularized through the radio compared to NYC's sound at the time. The labels who pushed out low quality tracks ended up hurting themselves, instead of making the track a quality piece of music.\nPost-freestyle era.\nFreestyle remained a largely underground genre with a sizable following in New York, but has recently seen a comeback in the cities where the music originally experienced its greatest success. New York City impresario Steve Sylvester and producer Sal Abbatiello of Fever Records launched Stevie Sly's Freestyle Party show at the Manhattan live music venue, Coda on April 1, 2004. The show featured Judy Torres, Cynthia, and the Cover Girls and was attended by several celebrity guests. The Coda show was successful, and was followed by a summer 2006 Madison Square Garden concert that showcased freestyle's most successful performers. New freestyle releases are popular with enthusiasts and newcomers alike. Miami rapper Pitbull collaborated with Miami freestyle artist Stevie B to create an updated version of Stevie B's hit, \"Spring Love\".\nCurrently, freestyle music continues to have a thriving fanbase in certain parts of the country, with New York City Italian-American DJs such as Bad Boy Joe and Louie DeVito helping to maintain an active freestyle scene in the NYC metro area.\nInfluence on other genres.\nNYC hard house.\nAs Latin freestyle in the late 1980s and early 1990s gradually became superseded with house music, dance-pop, and regular hip hop on one front and Spanish-language pop music with marginal Latin freestyle influences on another, \"harder strain\" of house music originating in New York City was known to incorporate elements of Latin freestyle and the old school hip hop sound. Principal architects of the genre were Todd Terry (early instances include \"Alright Alright,\" and \"Dum Dum Cry\") and Nitro Deluxe. Deluxe's \"This Brutal House,\" fusing Latin percussion and the New York electro sound of Man Parrish with brash house music, proved to have an impact on the United Kingdom's club music scene, presaging the early 1990s British rave scene.\nTerminology.\nThe genre was recognized as a subgenre of hip-hop in the mid-1980s. It was dominated by \"hard\" electro beats of the type used primarily at the time in hip-hop music. Freestyle was more appreciated in larger cities.\nFreestyle scenes.\nNew York.\n\"Let the Music Play\" by Shannon, is often named as the genre's first hit, and its sound, called \"The Shannon Sound\", as the foundation of the genre, although also known as the beginnings of the electro genre which then gave birth to techno. Afrika Bambaataa's \"Planet Rock\" was arguably the first freestyle song produced. \"Let the Music Play\" eventually became freestyle's biggest hit, and still receives frequent airplay. Its producers Chris Barbosa and Mark Liggett changed and redefined the electro funk sound with the addition of Latin-American rhythms and a syncopated drum-machine sound.\nIn March 2013, Radio City Music Hall hosted a freestyle concert. Top freestyle artists included in the line-up were TKA, Safire, Judy Torres, Cynthia, Cover Girls, Lisa Lisa, Shannon, Noel, and Lisette Melendez. Originally scheduled as a one-night event, a second night was added shortly after the first night was sold out in a matter of days.\nMiami.\nRadio stations nationwide began to play hits by artists like TKA, Sweet Sensation, Expos\u00e9, and Sa-Fire on the same playlists as Michael Jackson and Madonna. \"(You Are My) All and All\" by Joyce Sims became the first freestyle record to cross over into the R&amp;B market, and was one of the first to reach the European market. Radio station WPOW/Power 96 was noted for exposing freestyle to South Florida in the mid-'80s through the early '90s, as well as mixing in some local Miami bass into its playlist.\n'Pretty Tony' Butler produced several hits on Miami's Jam-Packed Records, including Debbie Deb's \"When I Hear Music\" and \"Lookout Weekend\", and Trinere's \"I'll Be All You'll Ever Need\" and \"They're Playing Our Song\". Company B, Stevie B, Paris by Air, Linear, Will to Power and Expos\u00e9's later hits defined Miami freestyle. Tolga Katas is credited as one of the first people to create a hit record entirely on a computer, and produced Stevie B's \"Party Your Body\", \"In My Eyes\" and \"Dreamin' of Love\". Katas' record label Futura Records was an incubator for artists such as Linear, who achieved international success after a move from Futura to Atlantic Records.\nPhiladelphia.\nThe groundbreaking \"Nightime\" by Pretty Poison featuring red headed diva Jade Starling in 1984 initially put Philadelphia on the freestyle map. Their follow-up \"Catch Me I'm Falling\" was a worldwide hit and brought freestyle to American Bandstand, Soul Train, Solid Gold and the Arsenio Hall Show. \"Catch Me I'm Falling\" broke on the street during the summer of 1987 and was the #1 single at WCAU (98 Hot Hits) and #2 at WUSL (Power 99) during the first two weeks of July. Virgin Records was quick to sign Pretty Poison helping to usher in the avalanche of other major label signings from the expanding freestyle scene.\nSeveral freestyle acts followed on the heels of Pretty Poison emerging from the metropolitan Philadelphia, PA area in the early 1990s, benefiting from both the clubs and the overnight success of then-Dance friendly Rhythmic Top 40 WIOQ. Artists such as T.P.E. (The Philadelphia Experiment) enjoyed regional success.\nCalifornia.\nFreestyle had a notable following in California, especially Los Angeles, the Central Valley, San Francisco Bay, and San Diego. California's large Latino community enjoyed the sounds of America's East Coast club scene, and a number of California artists became popular with East Coast freestyle enthusiasts. In Northern California, primarily San Francisco and San Jose, they leaned toward a similar rhythm dance to hi-NRG, so most of the Californian freestyle emerged from the southern regions of the Bay Area and Los Angeles.\nTimmy T, Bernadette, Caleb-B, SF Spanish Fly, Angelina, One Voice, M:G, Stephanie Fastro and The S Factor were from the Bay Area. \nThe Filipino American community in California also embraced freestyle music during the late 1980s and early 1990s. Jaya was one of the first Filipino-American freestyle singers, reaching number 44 in 1990 with \"If You Leave Me Now\".\nCanada.\nFreestyle's popularity spread outward from the Greater Toronto Area's Italian, Hispanic/Latino and Greek populations in the late 1980s and early 1990s. It was showcased alongside house music in various Toronto nightclubs, but by the mid-1990s was replaced almost entirely by house music.\nLil' Suzy released several 12-inch singles and performed live on the Canadian live dance music television program \"Electric Circus\". Montreal singer Nancy Martinez's 1986 single \"For Tonight\" would become the first Canadian freestyle single to reach the top 40 on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 chart, while the Montreal girl group reached the Canadian chart with \"Ole Ole\" in 2000.\nElsewhere in the world.\nPerformers and producers associated with the style also came from around the world, including Turkish-American Murat Konar (the writer and singer of Information Society's \"Running\"), Paul Lekakis from Greece, Asian artist Leonard (Leon Youngboy) who released the song \"Youngboys\", and British musicians including Freeez, Paul Hardcastle, Samantha Fox (whose singles \"Naughty Girls (Need Love Too)\", \"Love House\" and \"I Wanna Have Some Fun\" were all top 10 chart hits), and even Robin Gibb of the Bee Gees, who also adopted the freestyle sound in his 1984 album \"Secret Agent\", having worked with producer Chris Barbosa. \nSeveral British new wave and synth-pop bands also teamed up with freestyle producers or were influenced by the genre, and released freestyle songs or remixes. These include Duran Duran whose song \"Notorious\" was remixed by the Latin Rascals, and whose album \"Big Thing\" contained several freestyle inspired songs such as \"All She Wants Is\"; New Order who teamed up with Arthur Baker, producing and co-writing the track \"Confusion\"; Erasure and the Der Deutsche mixes of their song \"Blue Savannah\"; and the Pet Shop Boys, whose song \"Domino Dancing\" was produced by Miami-based freestyle producer Lewis Martine\u00e9. Australian act I'm Talking utilized freestyle elements into their singles \"Trust Me\" and \"Do You Wanna Be?\", both becoming top ten hits in their native Australia.\nRecord labels.\n[Cutting Records]\n[MicMac Records]\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "10810", "revid": "42513654", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=10810", "title": "Fantasy (psychology)", "text": "Mental faculty of drawing imagination and desire in the human brain\nIn psychoanalytic theory, fantasy is a broad range of mental experiences, mediated by the faculty of imagination in the human brain, and marked by an expression of certain desires through vivid mental imagery. Fantasies are generally associated with scenarios that are impossible or unlikely to happen.\nSexual fantasies are a common type of fantasy.\nConscious fantasy.\nIn everyday life, individuals often find their thoughts \"pursue a series of fantasies concerning things they wish they could do or wish they had done ... fantasies of control or of sovereign choice ... daydreams.\"\nGeorge Eman Vaillant in his study of defence mechanisms took as a central example of \"an immature defence ... \"fantasy\" \u2014 living in a 'Walter Mitty' dream world where you imagine you are successful and popular, instead of making real efforts to make friends and succeed at a job.\"\nOther researchers and theorists find that fantasy has beneficial elements\u00a0\u2014 providing \"small regressions and compensatory wish fulfilments which are recuperative in effect.\" Research by Deirdre Barrett reports that people differ radically in the vividness, as well as frequency of fantasy, and that those who have the most elaborately developed fantasy life are often the people who make productive use of their imaginations in art, literature, or by being especially creative and innovative in more traditional professions.\nFreud and fantasy.\nAccording to Sigmund Freud, a fantasy is constructed around multiple, often repressed wishes, and employs disguise to mask and mark the very defensive processes by which desire is enacted. The subject's desire to maintain distance from the repressed wish and simultaneously experience it opens up a type of third person syntax allowing for multiple entry into the fantasy. Therefore, in fantasy, vision is multiplied\u2014it becomes possible to see from more than one position at the same time, to see oneself and to see oneself seeing oneself, to divide vision and dislocate subjectivity. This radical omission of the \"I\" position creates space for all those processes that depend upon such a center, including not only identification but also the field and organization of vision itself.\nFor Freud, sexuality is linked from the very beginning to an object of fantasy. However, \"the object to be rediscovered is not the lost object, but its substitute by displacement; the lost object is the object of self-preservation, of hunger, and the object one seeks to re-find in sexuality is an object displaced in relation to that first object.\" This initial scene of fantasy is created out of the frustrated infants' deflection away from the instinctual need for milk and nourishment towards a phantasmization of the mother's breast, which is in close proximity to the instinctual need. Now bodily pleasure is derived from the sucking of the mother's breast itself. The mouth that was the original source of nourishment is now the mouth that takes pleasure in its own sucking. This substitution of the breast for milk and the breast for a phantasmic scene represents a further level of mediation which is increasingly psychic. The child cannot experience the pleasure of milk without the psychic re-inscription of the scene in the mind. \"The finding of an object is in fact a re-finding of it.\" It is in the movement and constant restaging away from the instinct that desire is constituted and mobilized.\nFreud and daydreams.\nA similarly positive view of fantasy was taken by Sigmund Freud who considered fantasy () a defence mechanism. He considered that men and women \"cannot subsist on the scanty satisfaction which they can extort from reality. 'We simply cannot do without auxiliary constructions,' as Theodor Fontane once said ... [without] dwelling on imaginary wish fulfillments.\" As childhood adaptation to the reality principle developed, so too \"one species of thought activity was split off; it was kept free from reality-testing and remained subordinated to the pleasure principle alone. This activity is \"fantasying\" ... continued as \"day-dreaming\".\" He compared such phantasising to the way a \"nature reserve preserves its original state where everything ... including what is useless and even what is noxious, can grow and proliferate there as it pleases.\"\nDaydreams for Freud were thus a valuable resource. \"These day-dreams are cathected with a large amount of interest; they are carefully cherished by the subject and usually concealed with a great deal of sensitivity ... such phantasies may be unconscious just as well as conscious.\" He considered these fantasies to include a great deal of the true constitutional essence of a personality, and that the energetic man \"is one who succeeds by his efforts in turning his wishful phantasies into reality,\" whereas the artist \"can transform his phantasies into artistic creations instead of into symptoms ... the doom of neurosis.\"\nKlein and unconscious fantasy.\nMelanie Klein extended Freud's concept of fantasy to cover the developing child's relationship to a world of internal objects. In her thought, this kind of \"play activity inside the person is known as 'unconscious phantasy' (deliberately spelled with 'ph' to distinguish it from the word 'fantasy'). And these phantasies are often very violent and aggressive. They are different from ordinary day-dreams or 'fantasies'.\"\nThe term \"fantasy\" became a central issue with the development of the Kleinian group as a distinctive strand within the British Psycho-Analytical Society, and was at the heart of the so-called controversial discussions of the wartime years. \"A paper by Susan Isaacs (1952) on 'The nature and function of Phantasy' ... has been generally accepted by the Klein group in London as a fundamental statement of their position.\" As a defining feature, \"Kleinian psychoanalysts regard the unconscious as made up of phantasies of relations with objects. These are thought of as primary and innate, and as the mental representations of instincts ... the psychological equivalents in the mind of defence mechanisms.\"\nIsaacs considered that \"unconscious phantasies exert a continuous influence throughout life, both in normal and neurotic people, the difference lying in the specific character of the dominant phantasies.\" Most schools of psychoanalytic thought would now accept that both in analysis and life, we perceive reality through a veil of unconscious phantasy. Isaacs however claimed that \"Freud's 'hallucinatory wish-fulfilment' and his 'introjection' and 'projection' are the basis of the fantasy life,\" and how far unconscious phantasy was a genuine development of Freud's ideas, how far it represented the formation of a new psychoanalytic paradigm, is perhaps the key question of the controversial discussions.\nLacan, fantasy, and desire.\nLacan engaged from early on with \"the phantasies revealed by Melanie Klein ... the \"imago\" of the mother ... this shadow of the \"bad internal objects\"\" \u2014 with the Imaginary. Increasingly, however, it was Freud's idea of fantasy as a kind of \"screen-memory, representing something of more importance with which it was in some way connected\" that was for him of greater importance. Lacan came to believe that \"the phantasy is never anything more than the screen that conceals something quite primary, something determinate in the function of repetition.\"\nPhantasies thus both link to and block off the individual's unconscious, his kernel or real core: \"subject and real are to be situated on either side of the split, in the resistance of the phantasy\", which thus comes close to the centre of the individual's personality and its splits and conflicts. \"The subject situates himself as determined by the phantasy ... whether in the dream or in any of the more or less well-developed forms of day-dreaming;\" and as a rule \"a subject's fantasies are close variations on a single theme ... the 'fundamental fantasy' ... minimizing the variations in meaning which might otherwise cause a problem for desire.\"\nThe goal of therapy thus became \"\"la travers\u00e9e du fantasme\", the crossing over, traversal, or traversing of the fundamental fantasy.\" For Lacan, \"The traversing of fantasy involves the subject's assumption of a new position with respect to the Other as language and the Other as desire ... a utopian moment beyond neurosis.\" The question he was left with was \"What, then, does he who has passed through the experience ... who has traversed the radical phantasy ... become?.\"\nThe \"fantasy principle\".\nThe postmodern intersubjectivity of the 21st century has seen a new interest in fantasy as a form of interpersonal communication. Here, we are told, \"We need to go beyond the pleasure principle, the reality principle, and repetition compulsion to ... the \"fantasy principle\" - not, as Freud did, reduce fantasies to wishes ... [but consider] all other imaginable emotions\" and thus envisage emotional fantasies as a possible means of moving beyond stereotypes to more nuanced forms of personal and social relating.\nSuch a perspective \"sees emotions as central to developing fantasies about each other that are not determined by collective 'typifications'.\"\nIn mental disorders.\nNarcissistic personality disorder.\nTwo diagnostic criteria narcissistic personality disorder are:\nSchizophrenia.\nFantasy is a common symptom in individuals with schizophrenia; they depict specific patterns of high-neurological activities in their brains' default mode network, which possibly constitute the biomarker of these fantasies.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

This article gives an overview of surnames around the world.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:TOC limit/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSpanish-speaking countries.\nArgentina.\nIn Argentina, normally only one family name, the father's paternal family name, is used and registered, as in English-speaking countries. However, it is possible to use both the paternal and maternal name. For example, if \"Ana Laura Melachenko\" and \"Emanuel Dar\u00edo Guerrero\" had a daughter named \"Adabel Anah\u00ed\", her full name could be \"Adabel Anah\u00ed Guerrero Melachenko\". Women, however, do not change their family names upon marriage and continue to use their birth family names instead of their husband's family names. However, women have traditionally, and some still choose to use the old Spanish custom of adjoining \"de\" and her husband's surname to her own name. For example, if Paula Segovia marries Felipe Cossia, she might keep her birth name or become \"Paula Segovia de Cossia\" or \"Paula Cossia\".\nThere are some province offices where a married woman can use only her birth name, and some others where she has to use the complete name, for legal purposes. The Argentine Civilian Code states both uses are correct, but police offices and passports are issued with the complete name. Today most women prefer to maintain their birth name given that \"de\" can be interpreted as meaning they belong to their husbands.\nWhen Eva Duarte married Juan Domingo Per\u00f3n, she could be addressed as Eva Duarte de Per\u00f3n, but the preferred style was Eva Per\u00f3n, or the familiar and affectionate \"Evita\" (little Eva).\nCombined names come from old traditional families and are considered one last name, but are rare. Although Argentina is a Spanish-speaking country, it is also composed of other varied European influences, such as Italian, French, Russian, German, etc.\nChildren typically use their fathers' last names only. Some state offices have started to use both last names, in the traditional father then mother order, to reduce the risk of a person being mistaken for others using the same name combinations, e.g. if Eva Duarte and Juan Per\u00f3n had a child named Juan, he might be misidentified if he were called \"Juan Per\u00f3n\", but not if he was known as Juan Per\u00f3n Duarte.\nIn early 2008, some new legislation is under consideration that will place the mother's last name ahead the father's last name, as it is done in Portuguese-speaking countries and only optionally in Spain, despite Argentina being a Spanish-speaking country.\nChile.\nIn Chile, marriage has no effect at all on either of the spouses' names, so people keep their birth names for all their life, no matter how many times marital status, theirs or that of their parents, may change. However, in some upper-class circles or in older couples, even though considered to be old-fashioned, it is still customary for a wife to use her husband's name as reference, as in \"Do\u00f1a Mar\u00eda In\u00e9s de Ram\u00edrez\" (literally Lady Mar\u00eda In\u00e9s (wife) of Ram\u00edrez).\nChildren will always bear the surname of the father followed by that of the mother, but if there is no known father and the mother is single, the children can bear either both of her mother's surnames or the mother's first surname followed by any of the surnames of the mother's parents or grandparents, or the child may bear the mother's first surname twice in a row.\nFrench-speaking countries.\nFrance \nBelgium \nCanadian \nGerman-speaking countries.\nThere are about 850,000 different family names in Germany. German family names most often derive from given names, geographical names, occupational designations, bodily attributes or even traits of character. Hyphenations notwithstanding, they mostly consist of a single word; in those rare cases where the family name is linked to the given names by particles such as \"von\" or \"zu\", they usually indicate noble ancestry. Not all noble families used these names (see Riedesel), while some farm families, particularly in Westphalia, used the particle \"von\" or \"zu\" followed by their farm or former farm's name as a family name (see \"Meyer zu Erpen\").\nFamily names in German-speaking countries are usually positioned last, after all given names. There are exceptions, however: in parts of Austria and Bavaria and the Alemannic-speaking areas, the family name is regularly put in front of the first given name. Also in many \u2013 especially rural \u2013 parts of Germany, to emphasize family affiliation there is often an inversion in colloquial use, in which the family name becomes a possessive: \"R\u00fcters Erich\", for example, would be Erich of the R\u00fcter family.\nIn Germany today, upon marriage, both partners can choose to keep their birth name or choose either partner's name as the common name. In the latter case the partner whose name was not chosen can keep their birth name hyphenated to the new name (e.g. \"Schmidt\" and \"Meyer\" choose to marry under the name \"Meyer\". The former \"Schmidt\" can choose to be called \"Meyer\", \"Schmidt-Meyer\" or \"Meyer-Schmidt\"), but any children will only get the single common name. In the case that both partners keep their birth name they must decide on one of the two family names for all their future children. (German name)\nChanging one's family name for reasons other than marriage, divorce or adoption is possible only if the application is approved by the responsible government agency. In Germany, permission will usually be granted if:\nOtherwise, name changes will normally not be granted.\nDutch-speaking countries.\nThe Netherlands and Belgium (Flanders)\nNordic countries.\nIn the Nordic countries, family names often, but certainly not always, originate from a patronymic. In Denmark and Norway, the corresponding ending is \"-sen\", as in \"Karlsen\". Names ending with \"dotter/datter\" (daughter), such as \"Olofsdotter\", are rare but occurring, and only apply to women. Today, the patronymic names are passed on similarly to family names in other Western countries, and a person's father does not have to be called Karl if he or she has the surname Karlsson. However, in 2006 Denmark reinstated patronymic and matronymic surnames as an option. Thus, parents Karl Larsen and Anna Hansen can name a son Karlsen or Annasen and a daughter Karlsdotter or Annasdotter.\nBefore the 19th century there was the same system in Scandinavia as in Iceland today. Noble families, however, as a rule adopted a family name, which could refer to a presumed or real forefather or to the family's coat of arms. In many surviving family noble names, such as \"Silfversparre\" (\"silver chevron\"; in modern spelling, \"Silver-\") or \"Stiernhielm\" (\"star-helmet\"; in modernized spelling, \"stj\u00e4rnhj\u00e4lm\"), the spelling is obsolete, but since it applies to a name, remains unchanged. (Some names from relatively modern times also use archaic or otherwise aberrant spelling as a stylistic trait; e.g. \"-quist\" instead of standard \"-kvist\" \"twig\" or \"-gr\u00e9n\" instead of standard \"-gren\", \"branch\".)\nLater on, people from the Scandinavian middle classes, particularly artisans and town dwellers, adopted names in a similar fashion to that of the nobility. Family names joining two elements from nature such as the Swedish \"Bergman\" (\"mountain man\"), \"Holmberg\" (\"island mountain\"), \"Lindgren\" (\"linden branch\"), \"Sandstr\u00f6m\" (\"sand stream\") and \"\u00c5kerlund\" (\"field meadow\") were quite frequent and remain common today. The same is true for similar Norwegian and Danish names.\nAnother common practice was to adopt one's place of origin as a middle or surname.\nEven more important a driver of change was the need, for administrative purposes, to develop a system under which each individual had a \"stable\" name from birth to death. In the old days, people would be known by their name, patronymic and the farm they lived at. This last element would change if a person got a new job, bought a new farm, or otherwise came to live somewhere else. (This is part of the origin, in this part of the world, of the custom of women changing their names upon marriage. Originally it indicated, basically, a change of address, and from older times, there are numerous examples of men doing the same thing). The many patronymic names may derive from the fact that people who moved from the country to the cities, also gave up the name of the farm they came from. As a worker, you passed by your father's name, and this name passed on to the next generation as a family name. Einar Gerhardsen, the Norwegian prime minister, used a true patronym, as his father was named Gerhard Olsen (Gerhard, the son of Ola). Gerhardsen passed his own patronym on to his children as a family name. This has been common in many working-class families. The tradition of keeping the farm name as a family name got stronger during the first half of the 20th century in Norway.\nThese names often indicated the place of residence of the family. For this reason, Denmark and Norway have a very high incidence of last names derived from those of farms, many signified by the suffixes like \"-b\u00f8\", \"-rud\", \"-heim/-um\", \"-land\" or \"-set\" (these being examples from Norway). In Denmark, the most common suffix is \"-gaard\" \u2014 the modern spelling is \"g\u00e5rd\" in Danish and can be either \"g\u00e5rd\" or \"gard\" in Norwegian, but as in Sweden, archaic spelling persists in surnames. The most well-known example of this kind of surname is probably \"Kierkegaard\" (combined by the words \"kirke/kierke\" (= church) and \"gaard\" (= farm) meaning \"the farm located by the Church\". It is, however, a common misunderstanding that the name relates to its direct translation: churchyard/cemetery), but many others could be cited. It should also be noted that, since the names in question are derived from the original owners' domiciles, the possession of this kind of name is no longer an indicator of affinity with others who bear it.\nIn many cases, names were taken from the nature around them. In Norway, for instance, there is an abundance of surnames based on coastal geography, with suffixes like \"-strand\", \"-\u00f8y\", \"-holm\", \"-vik\", \"-fjord\" or \"-nes\". Like the names derived from farms, most of these family names reflected the family's place of residence at the time the family name was \"fixed\", however. A family name such as Swedish \"Dahlgren\" is derived from \"dahl\" meaning valley and \"gren\" meaning branch; or similarly \"Upvall\" meaning \"upper-valley\"; It depends on the country, language, and dialect.\nSweden.\nIn Scandinavia family names often, but certainly not always, originate from a patronymic. Later on, people from the Scandinavian middle classes, particularly artisans and town dwellers, adopted surnames in a similar fashion to that of the gentry. Family names joining two elements from nature such as the Swedish \"Bergman\" (\"mountain man\"), \"Holmberg\" (\"island mountain\"), \"Lindgren\" (\"linden branch\"), \"Sandstr\u00f6m\" (\"sand stream\") and \"\u00c5kerlund\" (\"field grove\") were quite frequent and remain common today.\nFinland.\nFinland including Karelia and Estonia was the eastern part of The Kingdom of Sweden from its unification around 1100\u20131200 AD until the year 1809 when Finland was conquered by Russia. During the Russian revolution 1917, Finland proclaimed the republic Finland and Sweden and many European countries rapidly acknowledged the new nation Finland. Finland has mainly Finnish (increasing) and Swedish (decreasing) surnames and first names. There are two predominant surname traditions among the \"Finnish\" in Finland: the West Finnish and the East Finnish. The surname traditions of \"Swedish-speaking\" farmers, fishermen and craftsmen resembles the West Finnish tradition, while smaller populations of \"Sami\" and \"Romani people\" have traditions of their own. Finland was exposed to a very small immigration from Russia, so Russian names barely exists.\nUntil the mid-20th century, Finland was a predominantly agrarian society, and the names of West Finns were based on their association with a particular area, farm, or homestead, e.g. \"Jaakko Jussila\" (\"Jaakko from the farm of Jussi\"). On the other hand, the East Finnish surname tradition dates back to at least the 13th century. There, the Savonians pursued slash-and-burn agriculture which necessitated moving several times during a person's lifetime. This in turn required the families to have surnames, which were in wide use among the common folk as early as the 13th century. By the mid-16th century, the East Finnish surnames had become hereditary. Typically, the oldest East Finnish surnames were formed from the first names of the patriarchs of the families, e.g. \"Ik\u00e4valko\", \"Termonen\", \"Pentik\u00e4inen\". In the 16th, 17th, and 18th centuries, new names were most often formed by adding the name of the former or current place of living (e.g. \"Puumalainen\" &lt; Puumala). In the East Finnish tradition, the women carried the family name of their fathers in female form (e.g. \"Puumalatar\" &lt; \"Puumalainen\"). By the 19th century, this practice fell into disuse due to the influence of the West-European surname tradition.\nIn Western Finland, agrarian names dominated, and the last name of the person was usually given according to the farm or holding they lived on. In 1921, surnames became compulsory for all Finns. At this point, the agrarian names were usually adopted as surnames. A typical feature of such names is the addition of prefixes \"Ala-\" (Sub-) or \"Yl\u00e4-\" (Up-), giving the location of the holding along a waterway in relation of the main holding. (e.g. \"Yli-Ojanper\u00e4\", \"Ala-Verronen\"). The Swedish speaking farmers along the coast of \u00d6sterbotten usually used two surnames \u2013 one which pointed out the father's name (e.g. \"Eriksson\", \"Andersson\", \"Johansson\") and one which related to the farm or the land their family or bigger family owned or had some connection to (e.g. \"Holm\", \"Fant\", \"Westerg\u00e5rd\", \"Kloo\"). So a full name could be \"Johan Karlsson Kvist\", for his daughter \"Elvira Johansdotter Kvist\", and when she married a man with the Ahlskog farm, Elvira kept the first surname Johansdotter but changed the second surname to her husbands (e.g. \"Elvira Johansdotter Ahlskog\"). During the 20th century they started to drop the -son surname while they kept the second. So in Western Finland the Swedish speaking had names like \"Johan Varg\", \"Karl Viskas\", \"Sebastian Byskata\" and \"Elin Loo\", while the Swedes in Sweden at the other side of the Baltic Sea kept surnames ending with \"-son\" (e.g. \"Johan Eriksson\", \"Thor Andersson\", \"Anna-Karin Johansson\").\nA third tradition of surnames was introduced in south Finland by the Swedish-speaking upper and middle classes, which used typical German and Swedish surnames. By custom, all Finnish-speaking persons who were able to get a position of some status in urban or learned society, discarded their Finnish name, adopting a Swedish, German or (in the case of clergy) Latin surname. In the case of enlisted soldiers, the new name was given regardless of the wishes of the individual.\nIn the late 19th and early 20th century, the overall modernization process, and especially the political movement of fennicization, caused a movement for adoption of Finnish surnames. At that time, many persons with a Swedish or otherwise foreign surname changed their family name to a Finnish one. The features of nature with endings \"-o/\u00f6\", \"-nen\" (\"Meri\u00f6\" &lt; \"Meri\" \"sea\", \"Nieminen\" &lt; \"Niemi\" \"point\") are typical of the names of this era, as well as more or less direct translations of Swedish names (\"Paasivirta\" &lt; \"H\u00e4llstr\u00f6m\").\nIn 21st-century Finland, the use of surnames follows the German model. Every person is legally obligated to have a first and last name. At most, three first names are allowed. The Finnish married couple may adopt the name of either spouse, or either spouse (or both spouses) may decide to use a double name. The parents may choose either surname or the double surname for their children, but all siblings must share the same surname. All persons have the right to change their surname once without any specific reason. A surname that is un-Finnish, contrary to the usages of the Swedish or Finnish languages, or is in use by any person residing in Finland cannot be accepted as the new name, unless valid family reasons or religious or national customs give a reason for waiving this requirement. However, persons may change their surname to any surname that has ever been used by their ancestors if they can prove such claim. Some immigrants have had difficulty naming their children, as they must choose from an approved list based on the family's household language.\nIn the Finnish language, both the root of the surname and the first name can be modified by consonant gradation regularly when inflected to a case.\nIceland.\nIn Iceland, most people have no family name; a person's last name is most commonly a patronymic, i.e. derived from the father's first name. For example, when a man called \"Karl\" has a daughter called \"Anna\" and a son called \"Magn\u00fas\", their full names will typically be \"Anna Karlsd\u00f3ttir\" (\"Karl's daughter\") and \"Magn\u00fas Karlsson\" (\"Karl's son\"). The name is not changed upon marriage.\nSlavic world.\nSlavic countries are noted for having masculine and feminine versions for many (but not all) of their names. In most countries the use of a feminine form is obligatory in official documents as well as in other communication, except for foreigners. In some countries only the male form figures in official use (Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Montenegro, Serbia, Slovenia), but in communication (speech, print) a feminine form is often used.\nIn Slovenia the last name of a female is the same as the male form in official use (identification documents, letters). In speech and descriptive writing (literature, newspapers) a female form of the last name is regularly used.\nIf the name has no suffix, it may or may not have a feminine version. Sometimes it has the ending changed (such as the addition of \"-a\"). In the Czech Republic and Slovakia, suffixless names, such as those of German origin, are feminized by adding \"-ov\u00e1\" (for example, \"Schusterov\u00e1\").\nBulgaria.\nBulgarian names usually consist of three components \u2013 given name, patronymic (based on father's name), family name.\nGiven names have many variations, but the most common names have Christian/Greek (e.g. Maria, Ivan, Christo, Peter, Pavel), Slavic (Ognyan, Miroslav, Tihomir) or Protobulgarian (Krum, Asparukh) (pre-Christian) origin.\nFather's names normally consist of the father's first name and the \"-ov\" (male) or \"-ova\" (female) or \"-ovi\" (plural) suffix.\nFamily names usually also end with the \"-ov\", \"-ev\" (male) or \"-ova\", \"-eva\" (female) or \"-ovi\", \"-evi\" (plural) suffix.\nIn many cases (depending on the name root) the suffixes can be also \"-ski\" (male and plural) or \"-ska\" (female); \"-ovski\", \"-evski\" (male and plural) or \"-ovska\", \"-evska\" (female); \"-in\" (male) or \"-ina\" (female) or \"-ini\" (plural); etc.\nThe meaning of the suffixes is similar to the English word \"of\", expressing membership in/belonging to a family.\nFor example, the family name Ivanova means a person belonging to the Ivanovi family.\nA father's name Petrov means son of Peter.\nRegarding the different meaning of the suffixes, \"-ov\", \"-ev\"/\"-ova\", \"-eva\" are used for expressing relationship to the father and \"-in\"/\"-ina\" for relationship to the mother (often for orphans whose father is dead).\nCzechia and Slovakia.\nNames of Czech people consist of given name (\"k\u0159estn\u00ed jm\u00e9no\") and surname (\"p\u0159\u00edjmen\u00ed\"). Usage of the second or middle name is not common. Feminine names are usually derived from masculine ones by a suffix \"-ov\u00e1\" (\"Nov\u00e1kov\u00e1\") or \"-\u00e1\" for names being originally adjectives (\"Vesel\u00e1\"), sometimes with a little change of original name's ending (\"Sedl\u00e1\u010dkov\u00e1\" from \"Sedl\u00e1\u010dek\" or \"Svobodov\u00e1\" from \"Svoboda\"). Women usually change their family names when they get married. The family names are usually nouns (\"Svoboda\", \"Kr\u00e1l\", \"R\u016f\u017ei\u010dka\", \"Dvo\u0159\u00e1k\", \"Bene\u0161\"), adjectives (\"Novotn\u00fd\", \"\u010cern\u00fd\", \"Vesel\u00fd\") or past participles of verbs (\"Posp\u00ed\u0161il\"). There are also a couple of names with more complicated origin which are actually complete sentences (\"Sko\u010ddopole\", \"Hrejsemnou\" or \"V\u00edt\u00e1mv\u00e1s\"). The most common Czech family name is \"Nov\u00e1k\" / \"Nov\u00e1kov\u00e1\".\nIn addition, many Czechs and some Slovaks have German surnames due to mixing between the ethnic groups over the past thousand years. Deriving women's names from German and other foreign names is often problematic since foreign names do not suit Czech language rules, although most commonly \"-ov\u00e1\" is simply added (\"Schmidtov\u00e1\"; umlauts are often, but not always, dropped, e.g. \"M\u00fcllerov\u00e1\"), or the German name is respelled with Czech spelling (\"\u0160mitov\u00e1\"). Hungarian names, which can be found fairly commonly among Slovaks, can also be either left unchanged (Hungarian \"Nagy\", fem. \"Nagyov\u00e1\") or respelled according to Czech/Slovak orthography (masc. \"Na\u010f\", fem. \"Na\u010fov\u00e1\").\nPoland.\nIn Poland and most of the former Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth, surnames first appeared during the late Middle Ages. They initially denoted the differences between various people living in the same town or village and bearing the same name. The conventions were similar to those of English surnames, using occupations, patronymic descent, geographic origins, or personal characteristics. Thus, early surnames indicating occupation include \"Karczmarz\" (\"innkeeper\"), \"Kowal\" (\"blacksmith\"), \"Z\u0142otnik\" (\"gold smith\") and \"Bednarczyk\" (\"young cooper\"), while those indicating patronymic descent include \"Szczepaniak\" (\"Son of \"Szczepan\"), \"J\u00f3zefowicz\" (\"Son of \"J\u00f3zef\"), and \"Ka\u017amirkiewicz\" (\"Son of \"Kazimierz\"\"). Similarly, early surnames like \"Mazur\" (\"the one from Mazury\") indicated geographic origin, while ones like \"Nowak\" (\"the new one\"), \"Bia\u0142y\" (\"the pale one\"), and \"Wielgus\" (\"the big one\") indicated personal characteristics.\nIn the early 16th century, (the Polish Renaissance), toponymic names became common, especially among the nobility. Initially, the surnames were in a form of \"[first name] \"z\" (\"de\", \"of\") [location]\". Later, most surnames were changed to adjective forms, e.g. \"Jakub Wi\u015blicki\" (\"James of Wi\u015blica\") and \"Zbigniew Ole\u015bnicki\" (\"\"Zbigniew\" of Ole\u015bnica\"), with masculine suffixes \"-ski\", \"-cki\", \"-dzki\" and \"-icz\" or respective feminine suffixes \"-ska\", \"-cka\", \"-dzka\" and \"-icz\" on the east of Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth. Names formed this way are adjectives grammatically, and therefore change their form depending on sex; for example, \"Jan Kowalski\" and \"Maria Kowalska\" collectively use the plural \"Kowalscy\".\nNames with masculine suffixes \"-ski\", \"-cki\", and \"-dzki\", and corresponding feminine suffixes \"-ska\", \"-cka\", and \"-dzka\" became associated with noble origin. Many people from lower classes successively changed their surnames to fit this pattern. This produced many \"Kowalski\"s, \"Bednarski\"s, \"Kaczmarski\"s and so on.\nA separate class of surnames derive from the names of noble clans. These are used either as separate names or the first part of a double-barrelled name. Thus, persons named \"Jan Nieczuja\" and \"Krzysztof Nieczuja-Machocki\" might be related. Similarly, after World War I and World War II, many members of Polish underground organizations adopted their war-time pseudonyms as the first part of their surnames. \"Edward Rydz\" thus became Marshal of Poland \"Edward \u015amig\u0142y-Rydz\" and \"Zdzis\u0142aw Jeziora\u0144ski\" became \"Jan Nowak-Jeziora\u0144ski\".\nRussia.\nA full Russian name consists of personal (given) name, patronymic, and family name (surname).\nMost Russian family names originated from patronymics, that is, father's name usually formed by adding the adjective suffix \"-ov(a)\" or \"-ev(a)\". Contemporary patronymics, however, have a substantive suffix \"-ich\" for masculine and the adjective suffix \"-na\" for feminine.\nFor example, the proverbial triad of most common Russian surnames follows:\nFeminine forms of these surnames have the ending \"-a\":\nSuch a pattern of name formation is not unique to Russia or even to the Eastern and Southern Slavs in general; quite common are also names derived from professions, places of origin, and personal characteristics, with various suffixes (e.g. \"-in(a)\" and \"-sky (-skaya)\").\nProfessions:\nPlaces of origin:\nPersonal characteristics:\nA considerable number of \"artificial\" names exists, for example, those given to seminary graduates; such names were based on Great Feasts of the Orthodox Church or Christian virtues.\nGreat Orthodox Feasts:\nChristian virtues:\nMany freed serfs were given surnames after those of their former owners. For example, a serf of the Demidov family might be named \"Demidovsky\", which translates roughly as \"belonging to Demidov\" or \"one of Demidov's bunch\".\nGrammatically, Russian family names follow the same rules as other nouns or adjectives (names ending with \"-oy\", \"-aya\" are grammatically adjectives), with exceptions: some names do not change in different cases and have the same form in both genders (for example, \"Sedykh\", \"Lata\").\nUkraine and Belarus.\nUkrainian and Belarusian names evolved from the same Old East Slavic and Ruthenian language (western Rus') origins. Ukrainian and Belarusian names share many characteristics with family names from other Slavic cultures. Most prominent are the shared root words and suffixes. For example, the root \"koval\" (blacksmith) compares to the Polish \"kowal\", and the root \"bab\" (woman) is shared with Polish, Slovakian, and Czech. The suffix \"-vych\" (son of) corresponds to the South Slavic \"-vic\", the Russian \"-vich\", and the Polish \"-wicz\", while \"-sky\", \"-ski\", and \"-ska\" are shared with both Polish and Russian, and \"-ak\" with Polish.\nHowever some suffixes are more uniquely characteristic to Ukrainian and Belarusian names, especially: \"-chuk\" (Western Ukraine), \"-enko\" (all other Ukraine) (both son of), \"-ko\" (little [masculine]), \"-ka\" (little [feminine]), \"-shyn\", and \"-uk\". See, for example, Mihalko, Ukrainian Presidents Leonid Kravchuk, and Viktor Yushchenko, Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko, or former Soviet diplomat Andrei Gromyko. Such Ukrainian and Belarusian names can also be found in Russia, Poland, or even other Slavic countries (e.g. Croatian general Zvonimir \u010cervenko), but are due to importation by Ukrainian, Belarusian, or Rusyn ancestors.\nSouth Slavs.\nEndings in -i\u0107 and -i\u010d.\nSurnames of some South Slavic groups such as Serbs, Croatian Serbs, Montenegrins, and Bosniaks traditionally end with the suffixes \"-i\u0107\" and \"-vi\u0107\" (often transliterated to English and other western languages as \"ic\", \"ich\", \"vic\" or \"vich\". The v is added in the case of a name to which \"-i\u0107\" is appended would otherwise end with a vowel, to avoid double vowels with the \"i\" in \"-i\u0107\".) These are a diminutive indicating descent i.e. \"son of\". In some cases the family name was derived from a profession (e.g. blacksmith \u2013 \"Kova\u010d\" \u2192 \"Kova\u010devi\u0107\").\nAn analogous ending is also common in Slovenia. As the Slovenian language does not have the softer consonant \"\u0107\", in Slovene words and names only \"\u010d\" is used. So that people from the former Yugoslavia need not change their names, in official documents \"\u0107\" is also allowed (as well as \"\u0110 / \u0111\"). Thus, one may have two surname variants, e.g.: Bo\u017ei\u010d, Tom\u0161i\u010d (Slovenian origin or assimilated) and Bo\u017ei\u0107, Tom\u0161i\u0107 (roots from the Serbo-Croat language continuum area). Slovene names ending in -i\u010d do not necessarily have a patrimonial origin.\nIn general family names in all of these countries follow this pattern with some family names being typically Serbian, some typically Croat and yet others being common throughout the whole linguistic region.\nChildren usually inherit their fathers' family name. In an older naming convention which was common in Serbia up until the mid-19th century, a person's name would consist of three distinct parts: the person's given name, the patronymic derived from the father's personal name, and the family name, as seen, for example, in the name of the language reformer Vuk Stefanovi\u0107 Karad\u017ei\u0107.\nOfficial family names do not have distinct male or female forms, except in North Macedonia, though a somewhat archaic unofficial form of adding suffixes to family names to form female form persists, with \"-eva\", implying \"daughter of\" or \"female descendant of\" or \"-ka\", implying \"wife of\" or \"married to\". In Slovenia the feminine form of a surname (\"-eva\" or \"-ova\") is regularly used in non-official communication (speech, print), but not for official IDs or other legal documents.\nBosniak Muslim names follow the same formation pattern but are usually derived from proper names of Islamic origin, often combining archaic Islamic or feudal Turkish titles i.e. Mulaomerovi\u0107, \u0160abanovi\u0107, Had\u017eihafizbegovi\u0107, etc. Also related to Islamic influence is the prefix \"Had\u017ei-\" found in some family names. Regardless of religion, this prefix was derived from the honorary title which a distinguished ancestor earned by making a pilgrimage to either Christian or Islamic holy places; Had\u017eibegi\u0107, being a Bosniak Muslim example, and Had\u017eianti\u0107 an Orthodox Christian one.\nIn Croatia where tribal affiliations persisted longer, Lika, Herzegovina etc., originally a family name, came to signify practically all people living in one area, clan land or holding of the nobles. The \u0160ubi\u0107 family owned land around the Zrin River in the Central Croatian region of Banovina. The surname became \u0160ubi\u0107 Zrinski, the most famous being Nikola \u0160ubi\u0107 Zrinski.\nIn Montenegro and Herzegovina, family names came to signify all people living within one clan or bratstvo. As there exists a strong tradition of inheriting personal names from grandparents to grandchildren, an additional patronymic usually using suffix \"-ov\" had to be introduced to make distinctions between two persons bearing the same personal name and the same family name and living within same area. A noted example is Marko Miljanov Popovi\u0107, i.e. Marko, son of Miljan, from Popovi\u0107 family.\nDue to discriminatory laws in the Austro-Hungarian Empire, some Serb families of Vojvodina discarded the suffix \"-i\u0107\" in an attempt to mask their ethnicity and avoid heavy taxation.\nThe prefix \"Pop-\" in Serbian names indicates descent from a priest, for example Gordana Pop Lazi\u0107, i.e. descendant of Pop Laza.\nSome Serbian family names include prefixes of Turkish origin, such as \"Uzun-\" meaning tall, or \"Kara-\", black. Such names were derived from nicknames of family ancestors. A famous example is Kara\u0111or\u0111evi\u0107, descendants of \u0110or\u0111e Petrovi\u0107, known as Kara\u0111or\u0111e or Black \u0110or\u0111e.\nEndings -ov and -ski.\nAmong the Bulgarians, another South Slavic people, the typical surname suffix is \"-ov\" (Ivanov, Kovachev), although other popular suffixes also exist.\nIn North Macedonia, the most popular suffix today is \"-ski\".\nSlovenia.\nSlovenes have a great variety of surnames, most of them differentiated according to region. Surnames ending in -i\u010d are by far less frequent than among Croats and Serbs. There are typically Slovenian surnames ending in -i\u010d, such as Bla\u017ei\u010d, Stani\u010d, Maru\u0161i\u010d. Many Slovenian surnames, especially in the Slovenian Littoral, end in -\u010di\u010d (Gregor\u010di\u010d, Kocijan\u010di\u010d, Miklav\u010di\u010d, etc.), which is uncommon for other South Slavic peoples (except the neighboring Croats, e.g. Kova\u010di\u0107, Jela\u010di\u0107, Kranj\u010di\u0107, etc.). On the other hand, surname endings in -ski and -ov are rare, they can denote a noble origin (especially for the -ski, if it completes a toponym) or a foreign (mostly Czech) origin. One of the most typical Slovene surname endings is -nik (Rupnik, Pu\u010dnik, Ple\u010dnik, Poga\u010dnik, Podobnik) and other used surname endings are -lin (Pavlin, Mehlin, Ahlin, Ferlin), -ar (Mlakar, Ravnikar, Smrekar Tisnikar) and -lj (Rugelj, Pucelj, Bagatelj, Bricelj). Many Slovenian surnames are linked to Medieval rural settlement patterns. Surnames like Novak (literally, \"the new one\") or Hribar (from \"hrib\", hill) were given to the peasants settled in newly established farms, usually in high mountains. Peasant families were also named according to the owner of the land which they cultivated: thus, the surname Kralj (King) or Cesar (Emperor) was given to those working on royal estates, \u0160kof (Bishop) or Vidmar to those working on ecclesiastical lands, etc. Many Slovenian surnames are named after animals (Medved \u2013 bear, Volk, Vovk or Vouk \u2013 wolf, Golob \u2013 pigeon, Strnad \u2013 yellowhammer, Orel \u2013 eagle, Lisjak \u2013 fox, or Zajec \u2013 rabbit, etc.) or plants P\u0161enica \u2013 wheat, Slak \u2013 bindweed, Hrast \u2013 oak, etc. Many are named after neighbouring peoples: Horvat, Hrovat, or Hrovatin (Croat), Furlan (Friulian), Nemec (German), Lah (Italian), Vogrin, Vogri\u010d or Vogrin\u010di\u010d (Hungarian), Vo\u0161njak (Bosnian), \u010ceh (Czech), Turk (Turk), or different Slovene regions: Kranjc, Kranjec or Krajnc (from Carniola), Kra\u0161evec (from the Karst Plateau), Koro\u0161ec (from Carinthia), Ko\u010devar or Ho\u010devar (from the Gottschee county).\nUse of feminine surnames in Slovenia.\nIn Slovenia last name of a female is the same as the male form in official use (identification documents, letters). In speech and descriptive writing (literature, newspapers) a female form of the last name is regularly used. Examples: Novak (m.) &amp; Novakova (f.), Kralj (m.) &amp; Kraljeva (f.), Mali (m.) &amp; Malijeva (f.). Usually surenames on -ova are used together with the title/gender: gospa Novakova (Mrs. Novakova), gospa Kraljeva (Mrs. Kraljeva), gospodi\u010dna Malijeva (Miss Malijeva, if unmarried), etc. or with the name. So we have Maja Novak on the ID card and Novakova Maja (extremely rarely Maja Novakova) in communication; Tja\u0161a Mali and Malijeva Tja\u0161a (rarely Tja\u0161a Malijeva); respectively. Diminutive forms of last names for females are also available: Novakovka, Kraljevka. As for pronunciation, in Slovenian there is some leeway regarding accentuation. Depending on the region or local usage, you may have either N\u00f3vak &amp; N\u00f3vakova or, more frequently, Nov\u00e1k &amp; Nov\u00e1kova. Accent marks are normally not used.\nArabic-speaking countries.\nThe given name is always followed by the father's first name, then the father's family surname.\nSome surnames have a prefix of \"ibn\"- (\"ould\"- in Mauritania) meaning \"son of\".\nThe surnames follow similar rules defining a relation to a clan, family, place etc.\nSome Arab countries have differences due to historic rule by the Ottoman Empire or due to being a different minority.\nA large number of Arabic last names start with \"Al-\" which means \"The\"\nArab States of the Persian Gulf:\nNames mainly consist of the person's name followed by the father's first name connected by the word \"ibn\" or \"bin\" (meaning \"son of\"). The last name either refers to the name of the tribe the person belongs to, or to the region, city, or town he/she originates from. In exceptional cases, members of the royal families or ancient tribes mainly, the title (usually H.M./H.E., Prince, or Sheikh) is included in the beginning as a prefix, and the first name can be followed by four names, his father, his grandfather, and great \u2013 grandfather, as a representation of the purity of blood and to show the pride one has for his ancestry.\nIn Arabic-speaking Levantine countries (Jordan, Lebanon, Palestine, Syria) it's common to have family names associated with a certain profession or craft, such as \"Al-Haddad\"/\"Haddad\" which means \"Blacksmith\" or \"Al-Najjar\"/\"Najjar\" which means \"Carpenter\".\nIndian Subcontinent.\nIndia.\nIn India, surnames are placed as last names or before first names, which often denote: village of origin, caste, clan, office of authority their ancestors held, or trades of their ancestors. The use of surnames is a relatively new convention, introduced during British colonisation. Typically, parts of northern India follow English-speaking Western naming conventions by having a given name followed by a surname. This is not necessarily the case in southern India, where people may adopt a surname out of necessity when migrating or travelling abroad.\nThe largest variety of surnames is found in the states of Maharashtra and Goa, which numbers more than the rest of India together. Here surnames are placed last, the order being: the given name, followed by the father's name, followed by the family name. The majority of surnames are derived from the place where the family lived, with the 'kar' (Marathi and Konkani) suffix, for example, Mumbaikar, Punekar, Aurangabadkar, Tendulkar, Parrikar, Mangeshkar, Mahendrakar. Another common variety found in Maharashtra and Goa are the ones ending in 'e'. These are usually more archaic than the 'Kar's and usually denote medieval clans or professions like Rane, Salunkhe, Gupte, Bhonsle, Ranadive, Rahane, Hazare, Apte, Satpute, Shinde, Sathe, Londhe, Salve, Kale, Gore, Godbole, etc.\nIn Andhra Pradesh and Telangana, surnames usually denote family names. It is easy to track family history and the caste they belonged to using a surname.\nIn Odisha and West Bengal, surnames denote the caste they belong. There are also several local surnames like Das, Patnaik, Mohanty, Jena etc.\nIn Kerala, surnames denote the caste they belong. There are also several local surnames like Nair, Menon, Panikkar etc.\nIt is a common in Kerala, Tamil Nadu, and some other parts of South India that the spouse adopts her husband's first name instead of his family or surname name after marriage. The son or daughter also adopts the father's name as his or her last name\nIn Rajasthan, the community name and sometimes the gotra or clan name are used as surnames. Usage of community name as surname include: Charan, Jat, Meena, Rajput, etc. Sometimes, the faith name (for example: Jain) can also be used as a surname.\nIndia is a country with numerous distinct cultural and linguistic groups. Thus, Indian surnames, where formalized, fall into seven general types.\nSurnames are based on:\nThe convention is to write the first name followed by middle names and surname. It is common to use the father's first name as the middle name or last name even though it is not universal. In some Indian states like Maharashtra, official documents list the family name first, followed by a comma and the given names.\nIn modern times, in urban areas at least, this practice is not universal and some wives either suffix their husband's surname or do not alter their surnames at all. In some rural areas, particularly in North India, wives may also take a new first name after their nuptials. Children inherit their surnames from their father.\nJains generally use Jain, Shah, Firodia, Singhal or Gupta as their last names. Sikhs generally use the words \"Singh\" (\"lion\") and \"Kaur\" (\"princess\") as surnames added to the otherwise unisex first names of men and women, respectively. It is also common to use a different surname after Singh in which case Singh or Kaur are used as middle names (Montek Singh Ahluwalia, Surinder Kaur Badal). The tenth Guru of Sikhism ordered (Hukamnama) that any man who considered himself a Sikh must use \"Singh\" in his name and any woman who considered herself a Sikh must use \"Kaur\" in her name. Other middle names or honorifics that are sometimes used as surnames include Kumar, Dev, Lal, and Chand.\nThe modern-day spellings of names originated when families translated their surnames to English, with no standardization across the country. Variations are regional, based on how the name was translated from the local language to English in the 18th, 19th and 20th centuries during British rule. Therefore, it is understood in the local traditions that Baranwal and Barnwal represent the same name derived from Uttar Pradesh and Punjab respectively. Similarly, Tagore derives from Bengal while Thakur is from Hindi-speaking areas. The officially recorded spellings tended to become the standard for that family. In the modern times, some states have attempted standardization, particularly where the surnames were corrupted because of the early British insistence of shortening them for convenience. Thus Bandopadhyay became Banerji, Mukhopadhay became Mukherji, Chattopadhyay became Chatterji, etc. This coupled with various other spelling variations created several surnames based on the original surnames. The West Bengal Government now insists on re-converting all the variations to their original form when the child is enrolled in school.\nSome parts of Sri Lanka, Thailand, Nepal, Myanmar, and Indonesia have similar patronymic customs to those of India.\nNepal.\nNepali surnames are divided into three origins; Indo-Aryan languages, Tibeto-Burman languages and indigenous origins. Surnames of Khas community contains toponyms as Ghimire, Dahal, Pokharel, Sapkota from respective villages, occupational names as (Adhikari, Bhandari, Karki, Thapa). Many Khas surnames includes suffix as -wal, -al as in Katwal, Silwal, Khanal, Khulal, Rijal. Kshatriya titles such as Bista, Kunwar, Rana, Rawal, Shah, Thakuri, Chand, were taken as surnames by various Kshetri and Thakuris. Khatri Kshetris share surnames with mainstream Pahari Bahuns. Other popular Chhetri surnames include Basnyat, Bogati, Budhathoki, Khadka, Mahat, Raut. Similarly, Brahmin surnames such as Acharya, Joshi, Pandit, Sharma, Upadhyay were taken by Pahari Bahuns. Bahuns bear distinct surnames as Kattel, and share surnames with mainstream Bahuns. Other Bahun surnames include Aryal, Bhattarai, Banskota, Chaulagain, Devkota, Dhakal, Gyawali, Koirala, Mainali, Pandey, Panta, Paudel, Regmi, Subedi, Lamsal, and Dhungel. Khas-Dalits surnames include Kami, Bishwakarma or B.K., Damai, Mijar, Pariyar, Sarki. Newar groups of multiethnic background bears both Indo-Aryan surnames (like Shrestha, Pradhan) and indigenous surnames like Maharjan, Dangol. Magars bear surnames derived from Khas peoples such as Baral, Budhathoki, Lamichhane, Thapa and indigenous origins as Gharti, Pun, Pulami. Other Himalayan Mongoloid castes bears Tibeto-Burmese surnames like Gurung, Tamang, Thakali, Sherpa. Various Kiranti ethnic group contains many Indo-Aryan surnames of Khas origin which were awarded by the government of Khas peoples. These surnames are Rai, Subba depending upon job and position hold by them. Terai community consists both Indo-Aryan and Indigenous origin surnames. Terai Brahmins bears surnames as Jha. Nepalese Muslims bears Islamic surnames such as Ali, Ansari, Begum, Khan, Mohammad, Pathan. Other common Terai surnames are Kayastha.\nPakistan.\nIn Pakistan, surnames reflect a mixture of ethnic, tribal, ancestral, and religious identities rather than a single national naming convention. The naming structure has been shaped by centuries of Arabic, Persian, Central Asian, and South Asian influences, and includes both inherited family names and traditional patronymics.\nArabic-derived surnames such as Syed, Siddiqui, Naqvi, Abbasi, and Farooqi often indicate claimed lineage from early Islamic figures or ancestry from the Middle East. Many Pakistanis also carry surnames linked to Central Asia and Iran, including Mir, Mirza, Bukhari, Kashani, Ghaznavi, and Qizilbash.\nTribal and clan-based surnames remain common among Pashtuns, Baloch, Sindhi, and Punjabi communities. Examples include Afridi, Khattak, Yousafzai, Bugti, Mengal, Leghari, Awan, and Janjua. Such names often denote the bearer's ancestral tribe, lineage, or region of origin.\nToponymic surnames derived from South Asian cities or regions, such as Delhvi, Bilgrami, Lakhnavi, and Barelvi, reflect ancestral migration from northern India during or after the Partition.\nIn official documents, Pakistani names usually follow the pattern: \"Given name, son/daughter of [father's name], of [tribe or family name], resident of [place]\". In everyday use, people in Pakistan generally address one another by their given or first names rather than by surnames. The use of surnames is more common in formal documents or when indicating family, tribal, or ancestral affiliation.\nSinosphere.\nIn modern Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Taiwanese, and Vietnamese, traditional personal name is followed the Eastern order, with the family name is placed before the given names, although this order may not be observed in translation. Generally speaking, Chinese, Korean, and Vietnamese names do not alter their order in English (such as Mao Zedong and Chiang Kai-shek; Kim Jong-il and Park Chung Hee; Ho Chi Minh and Ngo Dinh Diem) but Japanese names do (Shinzo Abe). However, numerous exceptions exist, particularly for people born in English-speaking countries such as Yo-Yo Ma.\nThis is sometimes systematized but not all are conformant: \nFor example about some badminton players, with surnames are visually emphasized in all capital letters or bold:\nChinese family names have many types of origins, some claiming dates as early as the legendary Yellow Emperor (2nd millennium BC):\nIn history, some changed their surnames due to a naming taboo (from Zhuang \u838a to Yan \u56b4 during the era of Liu Zhuang \u5289\u838a) or when the imperial surname was awarded by the Emperor (the imperial surname Li was often bestowed on senior officers during the Tang dynasty).\nIn modern times, some Chinese adopt an English name in addition to their native given names: e.g., (\"Li Zh\u00f9m\u00edng\") adopted the English name Martin Lee. Particularly in Hong Kong and Singapore, the convention is to write both names together: Martin Lee Chu-ming. Owing to the confusion this can cause, a further convention is sometimes observed of capitalizing the surname: Martin LEE Chu-ming. Sometimes, however, the Chinese given name is forced into the Western system as a middle name (\"Martin Chu-ming Lee\"); less often, the English given name is forced into the Chinese system (\"Lee Chu-ming Martin\").\nIn Japan, the civil law forces a common surname for every married couple, unless in a case of international marriage. In most cases, women surrender their surnames upon marriage, and use the surnames of their husbands. However, a convention that a man uses his wife's family name if the wife is an only child is sometimes observed. A similar tradition called \"ru zhui\" (\u5165\u8d05) is common among Chinese when the bride's family is wealthy and has no son but wants the heir to pass on their assets under the same family name. The Chinese character \"zhui\" (\u8d05) carries a money radical (\u8c9d), which implies that this tradition was originally based on financial reasons. All their offspring carry the mother's family name. If the groom is the first born with an obligation to carry his own ancestor's name, a compromise may be reached in that the first male child carries the mother's family name while subsequent offspring carry the father's family name. The tradition is still in use in many Chinese communities outside mainland China, but largely disused in China because of social changes from communism. Due to the economic reform in the past decade, accumulation and inheritance of personal wealth made a comeback to the Chinese society. It is unknown if this financially motivated tradition would also come back to mainland China.\nIn Chinese, Korean, Vietnamese and Singaporean cultures, women keep their own surnames, while the family as a whole is referred to by the surnames of the husbands.\nIn Hong Kong, some women would be known to the public with the surnames of their husbands preceding their own surnames, such as Anson Chan Fang On Sang. Anson is an English given name, On Sang is the given name in Chinese, Chan is the surname of Anson's husband, and Fang is her own surname. A name change on legal documents is not necessary. In Hong Kong's English publications, her family names would have been presented in small cap letters to resolve ambiguity, e.g. Anson C F On Sang in full or simply Anson Chan in short form.\nIn Macau, some people have their names in Portuguese spelt with some Portuguese style, such as \"Carlos do Rosario Tchiang\".\nChinese women in Canada, especially Hongkongers in Toronto, would preserve their maiden names before the surnames of their husbands when written in English, for instance, Rosa Chan Leung, where Chan is the maiden name, and Leung is the surname of the husband.\nIn Chinese, Korean, and Vietnamese, surnames are predominantly monosyllabic (written with one character), though a small number of common disyllabic (or written with two characters) surnames exists (e.g. the Chinese name \"Ouyang\", the Korean name \"Jegal\" and the Vietnamese name \"T\u00f4n Th\u1ea5t\").\nMany Chinese, Korean, and Vietnamese surnames are of the same origin, but simply pronounced differently and even transliterated differently overseas in Western nations. For example, the common Chinese surnames Chen, Chan, Chin, Cheng and Tan, the Korean surname Jin, as well as the Vietnamese surname Tr\u1ea7n are often all the same exact character \u9673. The common Korean surname Kim is also the common Chinese surname Jin, and written \u91d1. The common Mandarin surnames Lin or Lim (\u6797) is also one and the same as the common Cantonese or Vietnamese surname L\u00e2m and Korean family name Lim (written/pronounced as \"Im\" in South Korea). There are people with the surname of Hayashi (\u6797) in Japan too. The common Chinese surname \u674e, translated to English as Lee, is, in Chinese, the same character but transliterated as Li according to pinyin convention. Lee is also a common surname of Koreans, and the character is identical. Conversely in Vietnam, around 30% of all have the surname Nguyen. This may be because when a new dynasty took power in Vietnam it was custom to adopt that dynasty's surname. The last dynasty in Vietnam was the Nguyen dynasty, so as a result, many people have this surname.\nAfrica.\nBurundi and Rwanda.\nIn Burundi and Rwanda, most, if not all surnames have God in it, for example, Hakizimana (meaning God cures), Nshimirimana (I thank God) or Havyarimana/Habyarimana (God gives birth). But not all surnames end with the suffix -imana. Irakoze is one of these (technically meaning Thank God, though it is hard to translate it correctly in English or probably any other language). Surnames are often different among immediate family members, as parents frequently choose unique surnames for each child, and women keep their maiden names when married. Surnames are placed before given names and frequently written in capital letters, e.g. HAKIZIMANA Jacques.\nEast Africa.\nIn several Northeast Bantu languages such as Kamba, Taita and Kikuyu in Kenya the word \"wa\" (meaning \"of\") is inserted before the surname, for instance, Mugo wa Kibiru (Kikuyu) and Mekatilili wa Menza (Mijikenda).\nEthiopia and Eritrea.\nThe patronymic custom in most of the Horn of Africa gives children the father's first name as their surname. The family then gives the child its first name. Middle names are unknown. So, for example, a person's name might be \"Bereket Mekonen \". In this case, \"Bereket\" is the first name and \"Mekonen\" is the surname, and also the first name of the father.\nThe paternal grandfather's name is often used if there is a requirement to identify a person further, for example, in school registration. Also, different cultures and tribes use the father's or grandfather's given name as the family's name. For example, some Oromos use Warra Ali to mean families of Ali, where Ali, is either the householder, a father or grandfather.\nIn Ethiopia, the customs surrounding the bestowal and use of family names is as varied and complex as the cultures to be found there. There are so many cultures, nations or tribes, that currently there can be no one formula whereby to demonstrate a clear pattern of Ethiopian family names. In general, however, Ethiopians use their father's name as a surname in most instances where identification is necessary, sometimes employing both father's and grandfather's names together where exigency dictates.\nMany people in Eritrea have Italian surnames, but all of these are owned by Eritreans of Italian descent.\nLibya.\nLibya's names and surnames have a strong Islamic/Arab nature, with some Turkish influence from Ottoman Empire rule of nearly 400 years.\nAmazigh, Touareg and other minorities also have their own name/surname traditions.\nDue to its location as a trade route and the different cultures that had their impact on Libya throughout history, one can find names that could have originated in neighboring countries, including clan names from the Arabian Peninsula, and Turkish names derived from military rank or status (\"Basha\", \"Agha\").\nOther countries.\nAlbania.\nA full Albanian name consists of a given name (), patronymic () and family name (), for example \"Agron Mark Gjoni\". The patronymic is simply the given name of the individual's father, with no suffix added. The family name is typically a noun in the definite form or at the very least ends with a vowel or -j (an approximant close to -i). Many traditional last names end with -aj (previously -anj), which is more prevalent in certain regions of Albania and Kosovo. Family names are usually patrilineal, however, the mother's surname can be legally added if so wished by the parents.\nProper names in Albanian are fully declinable like any noun (e.g. \"Marinelda\", genitive case \"i/e Marineld\u00ebs\" \"of Marinelda\").\nArmenia.\nArmenian surnames almost always have the ending () transliterated into English as -yan or -ian (spelled -ean (\u0565\u0561\u0576) in Western Armenian and pre-Soviet Eastern Armenian, of Ancient Armenian or Iranian origin, presumably meaning \"son of\"), though names with that ending can also be found among Persians and a few other nationalities. Armenian surnames can derive from a geographic location, profession, noble rank, personal characteristic or personal name of an ancestor. Armenians in the diaspora sometimes adapt their surnames to help assimilation. In Russia, many have changed -yan to -ov (or -ova for women). In Turkey, many have changed the ending to -o\u011flu (also meaning \"son of\"). In English and French-speaking countries, many have shortened their name by removing the ending (for example Charles Aznavour). In ancient Armenia, many noble names ended with the locative -t'si (example, Khorenatsi) or -uni (Bagratuni). Several modern Armenian names also have a Turkish suffix which appears before -ian/-yan: -lian denotes a placename; -djian denotes a profession. Some Western Armenian names have a particle Der, while their Eastern counterparts have Ter. This particle indicates an ancestor who was a priest (Armenian priests can choose to marry or remain celibate, but married priests cannot become a bishop). Thus someone named Der Bedrosian (Western) or Ter Petrosian (Eastern) is a descendant of an Armenian priest. The convention is still in use today: the children of a priest named Hagop Sarkisian would be called Der Sarkisian. Other examples of Armenian surnames: Adonts, Sakunts, Vardanyants, Rshtuni.\nAzerbaijan.\nIt was common for Azerbaijani names to have 3 components: given name, father's name and family name. However, in recent years it is becoming increasingly popular to only have 2 components: first name and surname.\nWhile under Soviet rule, it was mandatory for Azerbaijanis to register their names, but most people did not have surnames. This was normally circumvented by taking the individual's father's name and adding a Russian suffixes such as \"-yev\"/\"-ov\" for men and \"-yeva/-ova\" for women (meaning \"born of\"). For example, from \"Ali\" we get \"Aliyev\" and \"Aliyeva\" and from \"Husein\" we get \"Huseinov\" and \"Huseinova\". However, as the Soviet era came to an end, many Azerbaijanis dropped these endings in an attempt to derussify. Some chose to replace these with traditional suffixes like \"-zade\" (Persian for \"born of\") and \"-li/-lu\" (Turkish for \"with\" or \"belonging to\"), \"-oglu/-oghlu\" (Turkish for \"son of\"). Some chose to drop the suffixes entirely.\nGeorgia.\nMost eastern Georgian surnames end with the suffix of \"-shvili\", Georgian for \"child\" or \"offspring\", e.g. Kartveli\"shvili\", \"son of Kartvel (Georgian)\". Western Georgian surnames most commonly have the suffix \"-dze\", Georgian for \"son\", e.g. Laba\"dze\". Mingrelian surnames usually end in \"-ia\", \"-ua\" or \"-ava\". Other location-specific endings exist: in Svaneti \"-iani\", meaning \"belonging to\", or \"hailing from\", is common. In the eastern Georgian highlands common endings are \"-uri\" and \"-uli\". Some noble family names end in \"-eli\", meaning \"of (someplace)\".\nIn Georgian, the surname is not normally used as the polite form of address; instead, the given name is used together with a title in the vocative case, denoted by -o. For instance, Nikoloz Kartvelishvili is politely addressed as \"bat'ono Nikoloz\": \"Sir (literally master of a feudal manor) Nikoloz\". Women are addressed politely as \"kalbat'ono\", literally \"woman-master\".\nGreece and Cyprus.\nGreek surnames are most commonly patronymics. Occupation, characteristic, or ethnic background and location/origin-based surnames names also occur; they are sometimes supplemented by nicknames.\nCommonly, Greek male surnames end in -s, which is the common ending for Greek masculine proper nouns in the nominative case. Exceptionally, some end in -ou, indicating the genitive case of this proper noun for patronymic reasons.\nAlthough surnames are static today, dynamic and changing patronym usage survives in middle names in Greece where the genitive of the father's first name is commonly the middle name.\nBecause of their codification in the Modern Greek state, surnames have Katharevousa forms even though Katharevousa is no longer the official standard. Thus, the Ancient Greek name Eleutherios forms the Modern Greek proper name Lefteris, and former vernacular practice (prefixing the surname to the proper name) was to call John Eleutherios Leftero-giannis.\nModern practice is to call the same person Giannis Eleftheriou: the proper name is vernacular (and not Ioannis), but the surname is an archaic genitive. However, children are almost always baptised with the archaic form of the name so in official matters, the child will be referred to as Ioannis Eleftheriou and not Giannis Eleftheriou.\nFemale surnames are most often in the Katharevousa genitive case of a male name. This is an innovation of the Modern Greek state; Byzantine practice was to form a feminine counterpart of the male surname (e.g. masculine Palaiologos, Byzantine feminine Palaiologina, Modern feminine Palaiologou).\nIn the past, women would change their surname when married to that of their husband (again in the genitive case) signifying the transfer of \"dependence\" from the father to the husband. In earlier Modern Greek society, women were named with -aina as a feminine suffix on the husband's first name: \"Giorgaina\", \"Mrs George\", \"Wife of George\". Nowadays, a woman's legal surname does not change upon marriage, though she can use the husband's surname socially. Children usually receive the paternal surname, though in rare cases, if the bride and groom have agreed before the marriage, the children can receive the maternal surname.\nSome surnames are prefixed with Papa-, indicating ancestry from a priest, e.g. \"Papageorgiou\", the \"son of a priest named George\". Others, like Archi- and Mastro- signify \"boss\" and \"tradesman\" respectively.\nPrefixes such as Konto-, Makro-, and Chondro- describe body characteristics, such as \"short\", \"tall/long\" and \"fat\". \"Gero-\" and \"Palaio-\" signify \"old\" or \"wise\".\nOther prefixes include Hadji- (\u03a7\u03b1\u03bd\u03c4\u03b6\u03ae- or \u03a7\u03b1\u03bd\u03c4\u03b6\u03b9-) which was an honorific deriving from the Arabic Hadj or pilgrimage, and indicate that the person had made a pilgrimage (in the case of Christians, to Jerusalem) and Kara- which is attributed to the Turkish word for \"black\" deriving from the Ottoman Empire era. The Turkish suffix -oglou (derived from a patronym, \"-o\u011flu\" in Turkish) can also be found. Although they are of course more common among Greece's Muslim minority, they still can be found among the Christian majority, often Greeks or Karamanlides who were pressured to leave Turkey after the Turkish Republic was founded (since Turkish surnames only date to the founding of the Republic, when Atat\u00fcrk made them compulsory).\nArvanitic surnames also exist; an example is \"Tzanavaras\" or \"Tzavaras\", from the Arvanitic word \"\u00e7anavar\" or \"\u00e7avar\" meaning \"brave\" (\"pallikari\" in Greek).\nMost Greek patronymic suffixes are diminutives, which vary by region. The most common Hellenic patronymic suffixes are:\nOthers, less common, are:\nEither the surname or the given name may come first in different contexts; in newspapers and in informal uses, the order is \"given name + surname\", while in official documents and forums (tax forms, registrations, military service, school forms), the surname is often listed or said first.\nHungary.\nIn Hungarian, like Asian languages but unlike most other European ones (see French and German above for exceptions), the family name is placed before the given names. This usage does not apply to non-Hungarian names, for example \"Tony Blair\" will remain \"Tony Blair\" when written in Hungarian texts.\nNames of Hungarian individuals, however, appear in Western order in English writing.\nIndonesia.\nIndonesians comprise more than 600 ethnic groups. Not all of these groups traditionally have surnames, and in the populous Java surnames are not common at all \u2013 regardless of which one of the six officially recognized religions the name carrier profess, nor there are a legally separate group of surnames. For instance, a Christian Javanese woman named \"Agnes Mega Rosalin\" has three forenames and no surname. \"Agnes\" is her Christian name, but \"Mega\" can be the first name she uses and the name which she is addressed with. \"Rosalin\" is only a middle name. Nonetheless, Indonesians are well aware of the custom of family names, which is known as \"marga\" or \"fam\", and such names have become a specific kind of identifier. People can tell what a person's heritage is by his or her family or clan name.\nJavanese people are the majority in Indonesia, and most do not have any surname. There are some individuals, especially the old generation, who have only one name, such as \"Suharto\" and \"Sukarno\". These are not only common with the Javanese but also with other Indonesian ethnic groups who do not have the tradition of surnames. If, however, they are Muslims, they might opt to follow Arabic naming customs, but Indonesian Muslims do not automatically follow Arabic name traditions.\nIn conjunction with migration to Europe or America, Indonesians without surnames often adopt a surname based on some family name or middle name. The forms for visa application many Western countries use, has a square for writing the last name which cannot be left unfilled by the applicant.\nMost Chinese Indonesians substituted their Chinese surnames with Indonesian-sounding surnames due to political pressure from 1965 to 1998 under Suharto's regime.\nIranian/Persian/Kazan.\nPersian last names may be:\nSuffixes include: -an (plural suffix), -i (\"of\"), -zad/-zadeh (\"born of\"), -pur (\"son of\"), -nejad (\"from the race of\"), -nia (\"descendant of\"), -mand (\"having or pertaining to\"), -vand (\"succeeding\"), -far (\"holder of\"), -doost (\"-phile\"), -khah (\"seeking of\"), -manesh (\"having the manner of\"), -ian/-yan, -gar and -chi (\"whose vocation pertains\").\nAn example is names of geographical locations plus \"-i\": Irani (\"Iranian\"), Gilani (\"of Gilan province\"), Tabrizi (\"of the city of Tabriz\").\nAnother example is last names that indicate relation to religious groups such as Zoroastrian (e.g. Goshtaspi, Namiranian, Azargoshasp), Jewish (e.g. Yaghubian [Jacobean], Hayyem [Life], Shaul [Saul]) or Muslim (e.g. Alavi, Islamnia, Montazeri)\nLast names are arbitrary; their holder need not to have any relation with their meaning.\nTraditionally in Iran, the wife does not take her husband's surname, although children take the surname of their father. Individual reactions notwithstanding, it is possible to call a married woman by her husband's surname. This is facilitated by the fact that English words \"Mrs.\", \"Miss\", \"Woman\", \"Lady\" and \"Wife (of)\" in a polite context are all translated into \"\u062e\u0627\u0646\u0645\" (Khaanom). Context, however, is important: \"\u062e\u0627\u0646\u0645 \u06af\u0644\u062f\u0648\u0633\u062a\" (Khaanom Goldust) may, for instance, refer to the daughter of Mr. Goldust instead of his wife.\nWhen most of Iranian surnames are used with a name, the name will be ended with a suffix _E or _ie (of) such as Hasan_e roshan (Hasan is name and roshan is surname) that means Hasan of Roshan or Mosa_ie saiidi (Muses of saiidi). The _e is not for surname and it is difficult to say it is a part of surname.\nItaly.\nItaly has around 350,000 surnames. Most of them derive from the following sources: patronym or ilk (e.g. \"Francesco di Marco\", \"Francis, son of Mark\" or \"Eduardo de Filippo\", \"Edward belonging to the family of Philip\"), occupation (e.g. \"Enzo Ferrari\", \"Heinz (of the) Blacksmiths\"), personal characteristic (e.g. nicknames or pet names like \"Dario Forte\", \"Darius the Strong\"), geographic origin (e.g. \"Elisabetta Romano\", \"Elisabeth from Rome\") and objects (e.g. \"Carlo Sacchi\", \"Charles Bags\"). The two most common Italian family names, \"Russo\" and \"Rossi\", mean the same thing, \"Red\", possibly referring to the hair color.\nBoth Western and Eastern orders are used for full names: the given name usually comes first, but the family name may come first in administrative settings; lists are usually indexed according to the last name.\nSince 1975, women have kept their own surname when married, but until recently (2000) they could have added the surname of the husband according to the civil code, although it was a very seldom-used practice. In recent years, the husband's surname cannot be used in any official situation. In some unofficial situations, sometimes both surnames are written (the proper first), sometimes separated by \"in\" (e.g. \"Anna Mauri in Crivelli\") or, in case of widows, \"ved.\" (\"vedova\").\nLatvia.\nLatvian male surnames usually end in \"-s\", \"-\u0161\" or \"-is\" whereas the female versions of the same names end in \"-a\" or \"-e\" or \"s\" in both unmarried and married women.\nBefore the emancipation from serfdom (1817 in Courland, 1819 in Vidzeme, 1861 in Latgale) only noblemen, free craftsmen or people living in towns had surnames. Therefore, the oldest Latvian surnames originate from German or Low German, reflecting the dominance of German as an official language in Latvia till the 19th century. Examples: \"Meijers/Meijere\" (German: \"Meier\", farm administrator; akin to Mayor), \"Millers/Millere\" (German: \"M\u00fcller\", miller), \"\u0160mits/\u0160mite\" (German: \"Schmidt\", smith), \"\u0160ulcs/\u0160ulce, \u0160ulca\" (German: \"Schultz\" or \"Schulz\", constable), \"Ulmanis\" (German: \"Ullmann\", a person from Ulm), \"Godmanis\" (a God-man), \"P\u0113tersons\" (son of Peter). Some Latvian surnames, mainly from Latgale are of Polish or Belarusian origin by changing the final \"-ski/-cki\" to \"-skis/-ckis\", \"-czyk\" to \"-\u010diks\" or \"-vich/-wicz\" to \"-vi\u010ds\", such as \"Sokolovkis/Sokolovska\", \"Baldun\u010diks/Baldun\u010dika\" or \"Ratkevi\u010ds/Ratkevi\u010da\".\nMost Latvian peasants received their surnames in 1826 (in Vidzeme), in 1835 (in Courland), and in 1866 (in Latgale). Diminutives were the most common form of family names. Examples: \"Kalni\u0146\u0161/Kalni\u0146a\" (small hill), \"B\u0113rzi\u0146\u0161/B\u0113rzi\u0146a\" (small birch).\nNowadays many Latvians of Slavic descent have surnames of Russian, Belarusian, or Ukrainian origin, for example \"Volkovs/Volkova\" or \"Anto\u0146enko\".\nLithuania.\nLithuanian names follow the Baltic distinction between male and female suffixes of names, although the details are different. Male surnames usually end in \"-a\", \"-as\", \"-aitis\", \"-ys\", \"-ius\", or \"-us\", whereas the female versions change these suffixes to \"-ait\u0117, -yt\u0117, -i\u016bt\u0117\", and \"-ut\u0117\" respectively (if unmarried), \"-ien\u0117\" (if married), or \"-\u0117\" (not indicating the marital status). Some Lithuanians have names of Polish or another Slavic origin, which are made to conform to Lithuanian by changing the final \"-ski\" to \"-skas\", such as \"Sadauskas\", with the female version bein -\"skait\u0117\" (if unmarried), \"-skien\u0117\" (if married), or \"-sk\u0117\" (not indicating the marital status).\nMalta.\nDifferent cultures have their impact on the demographics of the Maltese islands, and this is evident in the various surnames Maltese people bear nowadays. There are very few Maltese surnames per se: the few that originate from Maltese places of origin include Chircop (Kirkop), Lia (Lija), Balzan (Balzan), Valletta (Valletta), and Sciberras (Xebb ir-Ras Hill, on which Valletta was built). The village of Munxar, on Gozo, is characterised by the majority of its population having one of two surnames, either Curmi or DeBrincat. In Gozo, the surnames Bajada and Farrugia are also common.\nCustoms.\nIn line with traditional Christian practice, women generally assume their husband's surname after legal marriage, and this is passed on to any children the couple may bear. Some women opt to retain their old name, for professional/personal reasons, or combine their surname with that of their husband.\nList of surnames by language of origin.\nSicilian and Italian surnames.\nSicilian and Italian surnames are common due to the close vicinity to Malta. Sicilians were the first to colonise the Maltese islands. Common examples include Azzopardi, Bonello, Cauchi, Farrugia, Gauci, Rizzo, Schembri, Tabone, Vassallo, Vella.\nSiculo-Arabic surnames.\nArabic surnames occur in part due to the early presence of the Arabs in Malta. Common examples include Sammut, Camilleri, Zammit, and Xuereb.\nFrench surnames.\nCommon examples include Depuis, Montfort, Monsenuier, Tafel.\nEnglish surnames.\nEnglish surnames exist for a number of reasons, but mainly due to migration as well as Malta forming a part of the British Empire in the 19th century and most of the 20th. Common examples include Bone, Harding, Atkins, Mattocks, Smith, Jones, Woods, Turner, Littlejohn.\nGerman surnames.\nSurnames from foreign countries from the Middle Ages include German, such as von Brockdorff, Hyzler, and Schranz.\nSpanish surnames.\nCommon surnames of Spanish origin include Abela, Galdes, Herrera, and Guzman.\nGreek surnames.\nMany of the earliest Maltese surnames are Siculo-Greek, e.g. Cilia, Calleja, Brincat, Cauchi. Much less common are recent surnames from Greece; examples include Dacoutros, and Trakosopoulos.\nJewish surnames.\nThe original Jewish community of Malta and Gozo has left no trace of their presence on the islands since they were expelled in January 1493.\nMongolia.\nMongolians do not use surnames in the way that most Westerners, Chinese or Japanese do. Since the socialist period, patronymics \u2013 then called \"ovog\", now called \"etsgiin ner\" \u2013 are used instead of a surname. If the father's name is unknown, a matronymic is used. The patro- or matronymic is written before the given name. Therefore, if a man with given name Tsakhia has a son, and gives the son the name Elbegdorj, the son's full name is Tsakhia Elbegdorj. Very frequently, the patronymic is given in genitive case, i.e. Tsakhiagiin Elbegdorj. However, the patronymic is rather insignificant in everyday use and usually just given as an initial \u2013 Ts. Elbegdorj. People are normally just referred to and addressed by their given name (Elbegdorj \"guai\" \u2013 Mr. Elbegdorj), and if two people share a common given name, they are usually just kept apart by their initials, not by the full patronymic.\nSince 2000, Mongolians have been officially using clan names \u2013 \"ovog\", the same word that had been used for the patronymics before \u2013 on their IDs. Many people chose the names of the ancient clans and tribes such Borjigin, Besud, Jalair, etc. Also many extended families chose the names of the native places of their ancestors. Some chose the names of their most ancient known ancestor. Some just decided to pass their own given names (or modifications of their given names) to their descendants as clan names. Some chose other attributes of their lives as surnames. G\u00fcrragchaa chose Sansar (Cosmos). Clan names precede the patronymics and given names, e.g. Besud Tsakhiagiin Elbegdorj. These clan names have a significance and are included in Mongolian passports.\nMyanmar (Burma).\nPeople from Myanmar or Burmese, have no family names. This, to some, is the only known Asian people having no family names at all. Some of those from Myanmar or Burma, who are familiar with European or American cultures, began to put to their younger generations with a family name \u2013 adopted from the notable ancestors. For example, Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi is the daughter of the late Father of Independence General Aung San; Hayma Ne Win, is the daughter of the famous actor Kawleikgyin Ne Win etc.\nPhilippines.\nUntil the middle of the 19th century, there was no standardization of surnames in the Philippines. There were native Filipinos without surnames, others whose surnames deliberately did not match that of their families, as well as those who took certain surnames simply because they had a certain prestige, usually ones related to the Roman Catholic religion, such as de los Santos (\"of the saints\") and de la Cruz (\"of the cross\"), or of local nobility such as of rajahs or \"datus\".\nOn 21 November 1849, the Spanish Governor-General of the Philippines, Narciso Claver\u00eda y Zald\u00faa, decreed an end to these arbitrary practices, the systematic distribution of surnames to Filipinos without prior surnames and the universal implementation of the Spanish naming system. This produced the \"Cat\u00e1logo alfab\u00e9tico de apellidos\" (\"Alphabetical Catalogue of Surnames\"), which listed permitted surnames with origins in Spanish, Filipino, and Hispanized Chinese words, names, and numbers. Thus, many Spanish-sounding Filipino surnames are not surnames common to the rest of the Spanish-speaking world. The book contained many words coming from Spanish and the Philippine languages such as Tagalog, as well as many Basque and Catalan surnames.\nThe colonial authorities implemented this decree because many Christianized Filipinos assumed religious names. There soon were too many people surnamed \"de los Santos\" (\"of the saints\"), \"de la Cruz\" (\"of the cross\"), \"del Rosario\" (\"of the Rosary\") etc., which made it difficult for the Spanish colonists to control the Filipino people, and most importantly, to collect taxes. These extremely common names were also banned by the decree unless the name has been used by a family for at least four generations. This Spanish naming custom also countered the native custom before the Spanish period, wherein siblings assumed different surnames. Claver\u00eda's decree was enforced to different degrees in different parts of the colony.\nBecause of this implementation of Spanish naming customs, of the arrangement \"given name + paternal surname + maternal surname\", in the Philippines, a Spanish surname does not necessarily denote Spanish ancestry.\nIn practice, the application of this decree varied from municipality to municipality. Most municipalities received surnames starting with only one initial letter; in others, this was not well enforced. For example, the majority of residents of the island of Banton in the province of Romblon have surnames starting with F such as \"Fabicon\", \"Fallarme\", \"Fadrilan\", and \"Ferran\". Other examples are most cities and towns in Albay, Catanduanes, Ilocos Sur and Marinduque, where the majority of their residents have surnames beginning with a particular letter.\nThus, although perhaps a majority of Filipinos have Spanish surnames, such a surname does not indicate Spanish ancestry. In addition, most Filipinos currently do not use Spanish accented letters in their Spanish derived names. The lack of accents in Filipino Spanish has been attributed to the lack of accents on the predominantly American typewriters after the United States gained control of the Philippines.\nThe vast majority of Filipinos follow a naming system in the American order (i.e. given name + middle name + surname), which is the reverse of the Spanish naming order (i.e. given name + paternal surname + maternal surname). Children take the mother's surname as their middle name, followed by their father's as their surname; for example, a son of Juan de la Cruz and his wife Mar\u00eda Agbayani may be David Agbayani de la Cruz. Women usually take the surnames of their husband upon marriage, and consequently lose their maiden middle names; so upon her marriage to David de la Cruz, the full name of Laura Yuchengco Macaraeg would become Laura Macaraeg de la Cruz. Their maiden last names automatically become their middle names upon marriage.\nThere are other sources for surnames. Many Filipinos also have Chinese-derived surnames, which in some cases could indicate Chinese ancestry. Many Hispanized Chinese numerals and other Hispanized Chinese words, however, were also among the surnames in the \"Cat\u00e1logo alfab\u00e9tico de apellidos\". For those whose surname may indicate Chinese ancestry, analysis of the surname may help to pinpoint when those ancestors arrived in the Philippines. A Hispanized Chinese surname such as Cojuangco suggests an 18th-century arrival while a Chinese surname such as Lim suggests a relatively recent immigration. Some Chinese surnames such as Tiu-Laurel are composed of the immigrant Chinese ancestor's surname as well as the name of that ancestor's godparent on receiving Christian baptism.\nIn the predominantly Muslim areas of the southern Philippines, adoption of surnames was influenced by Islamic religious terms. As a result, surnames among Filipino Muslims are largely Arabic-based, and include such surnames as Hassan and Haradji.\nThere are also Filipinos who, to this day, have no surnames at all, particularly if they come from indigenous cultural communities.\nNaming customs in the Philippines.\nPrior to the establishment of the Philippines as a US territory during the earlier part of the 20th century, Filipinos usually followed Iberian naming customs. However, upon the promulgation of the Family Code of 1987, Filipinos formalized adopting the American system of using their surnames.\nA common Filipino name will consist of the given name (mostly 2 given names are given), the initial letter of the mother's maiden name and finally the father's surname (i.e. Lucy Anne C. de Guzman). Also, women are allowed to retain their maiden name or use both her and her husband's surname as a double-barreled surname, separated by a dash. This is common in feminist circles or when the woman holds a prominent office (e.g. Gloria Macapagal Arroyo, Miriam Defensor Santiago). In more traditional circles, especially those who belong to the prominent families in the provinces, the custom of the woman being addressed as \"Mrs. Husband's Full Name\" is still common.\nFor widows, who chose to marry again, two norms are in existence. For those who were widowed before the Family Code, the full name of the woman remains while the surname of the deceased husband is attached. That is, Maria Andres, who was widowed by Ignacio Dimaculangan will have the name Maria Andres viuda de Dimaculangan. If she chooses to marry again, this name will still continue to exist while the surname of the new husband is attached. Thus, if Maria marries Rene de los Santos, her new name will be Maria Andres viuda de Dimaculangan de los Santos.\nHowever, a new norm is also in existence. The woman may choose to use her husband's surname to be one of her middle names. Thus, Maria Andres viuda de Dimaculangan de los Santos may also be called Maria A.D. de los Santos.\nChildren will however automatically inherit their father's surname if they are considered legitimate. If the child is born out of wedlock, the mother will automatically pass her surname to the child, unless the father gives a written acknowledgment of paternity. The father may also choose to give the child both his parents' surnames if he wishes (that is Gustavo Paredes, whose parents are Eulogio Paredes and Juliana Angeles, while having Maria Solis as a wife, may name his child Kevin S. Angeles-Paredes.\nIn some Tagalog regions, the norm of giving patronyms, or in some cases matronyms, is also accepted. These names are of course not official, since family names in the Philippines are inherited. It is not uncommon to refer to someone as Juan anak ni Pablo (John, the son of Paul) or Juan apo ni Teofilo (John, the grandson of Theophilus).\nRomania.\nIn Romania, like in most of Europe, it is customary for a child to take his father's family name, and a wife to take her husband's last name. However, this is not compulsory\u00a0\u2013 spouses and parents are allowed to choose other options too, as the law is flexible (see Art. 282, Art. 449 Art. 450. of the Civil Code of Romania).\nUntil the 19th century, the names were primarily of the form \"[given name] [father's name] [grandfather's name]\". The few exceptions are usually famous people or the nobility (boyars). The name reform introduced around 1850 had the names changed to a western style, most likely imported from France, consisting of a given name followed by a family name.\nAs such, the name is called \"prenume\" (French \"pr\u00e9nom\"), while the family name is called \"nume\" or, when otherwise ambiguous, \"nume de familie\" (\"family name\"). Although not mandatory, middle names are common.\nHistorically, when the family name reform was introduced in the mid-19th century, the default was to use a patronym, or a matronym when the father was dead or unknown. A common convention was to append the suffix \"-escu\" to the father's name, e.g. \"Anghelescu\" (\"\"Anghel's\" child\") and \"Petrescu\" (\"\"Petre's\" child\"). (The \"-escu\" seems to come from Latin \"-iscum\", thus being cognate with Italian \"-esco\" and French \"-esque\".) Another common convention was to append the suffix \"-eanu\" to the name of the place of origin, e.g. \"Munteanu\" (\"from the mountains\") and \"Moldoveanu\" (\"from \"Moldova\"\"). These uniquely Romanian suffixes strongly identify ancestral nationality.\nThere are also descriptive family names derived from occupations, nicknames, and events, e.g. \"Botezatu\" (\"baptised\"), \"Barbu\" (\"bushy bearded\"), \"Prodan\" (\"foster\"), \"B\u0103lan\" (\"blond\"), \"Fieraru\" (\"smith\"), \"Croitoru\" (\"tailor\"), \"P\u0103curaru\" (\"shepherd\").\nRomanian family names remain the same regardless of the sex of the person.\nAlthough given names appear before family names in most Romanian contexts, official documents invert the order, ostensibly for filing purposes. Correspondingly, Romanians occasionally introduce themselves with their family names first, e.g. a student signing a test paper in school.\nRomanians bearing names of non-Romanian origin often adopt Romanianised versions of their ancestral surnames. For example, \"Jurovschi\" for Polish \"\u017burowski\", or Popovici for Serbian Popovi\u0107 (\"son of a priest\"), which preserves the original pronunciation of the surname through transliteration. In some cases, these changes were mandated by the state.\nTurkey.\nIn Turkey, following the Surname Law imposed in 1934 in the context of Atat\u00fcrk's Reforms, every family living in Turkey was given a family name. The surname was generally selected by the elderly people of the family and could be any Turkish word (or a permitted word for families belonging to official minority groups).\nSome of the most common family names in Turkey are \"Y\u0131lmaz\" ('undaunted'), \"Do\u011fan\" ('falcon'), \"\u015eahin\" ('hawk'), \"Y\u0131ld\u0131r\u0131m\" ('thunderbolt'), \"\u015eim\u015fek\" ('lightning'), \"\u00d6zt\u00fcrk\" ('purely Turkish').\nPatronymic surnames do not necessarily refer to ancestry, or in most cases cannot be traced back historically. The most usual Turkish patronymic suffix is \"\u2013o\u011flu\"; \"\u2013ov(a)\", \"\u2013yev(a)\" and \"\u2013zade\" also occur in the surnames of Azeri or other Turkic descendants.\nOfficial minorities like Armenians, Greeks, and Jews have surnames in their own mother languages.\nThe Armenian families living in Turkey usually have Armenian surnames and generally have the suffix \"\u2013yan\", \"\u2013ian\", or, using Turkish spelling, \"-can\". Greek descendants usually have Greek surnames which might have Greek suffixes like \"\u2013ou\", \"\u2013aki(s)\", \"\u2013poulos/poulou\", \"\u2013idis/idou\", \"\u2013iadis/iadou\" or prefixes like \"papa\u2013\".\nThe Sephardic Jews who were expelled from Spain and settled in Turkey in 1492 have both Jewish/Hebrew surnames, and Spanish surnames, usually indicating their native regions, cities or villages back in Spain, like \"De Leon\" or \"Toledano\".\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

One franc is typically divided into 100 centimes. The name is said to derive from the Latin inscription \"francorum rex\" (King of the Franks) used on early French coins and until the 18th century, or from the French \"franc\", meaning \"frank\" (and \"free\" in certain contexts, such as \"coup franc\", \"free kick\").\nThe countries that use francs today include Switzerland, Liechtenstein, and most of Francophone Africa. The Swiss franc is a major world currency today due to the prominence of Swiss financial institutions.\nBefore the introduction of the euro in 1999, francs were also used in France, Belgium and Luxembourg, while Andorra and Monaco accepted the French franc as legal tender (Mon\u00e9gasque franc). The franc was also used in French colonies including Algeria and Cambodia. The franc is sometimes Italianised or Hispanicised as the \"franco\", for instance in Luccan franco.\nOrigins.\nThe franc was originally a French gold coin of 3.87\u00a0g minted in 1360 on the occasion of the release of King John II (\"the Good\"), held by the English since his capture at the Battle of Poitiers four years earlier. It was equivalent to one \"livre tournois\" (Tours pound).\nFrench franc.\nThe French franc was originally a gold coin issued in France from 1360 until 1380, then a silver coin issued between 1575 and 1641. The franc finally became the national currency from 1795 until 1999 (franc coins and notes were legal tender until 2002). Though abolished as a legal coin by King Louis XIII in 1641 in favor of the gold louis and silver \u00e9cu, the term franc continued to be used in common parlance for the livre tournois. The franc was also minted for many of the former French colonies, such as Morocco, Algeria, French West Africa, and others. Today, after independence, many of these countries continue to use the franc as their standard denomination.\nThe value of the French franc was locked to the euro at 1 euro = 6.55957 FRF on 31 December 1998, and after the introduction of the euro notes and coins, ceased to be legal tender after 28 February 2002, although they were still exchangeable at banks until 19 February 2012.\nCFA and CFP francs.\nFourteen African countries use the franc CFA (in west Africa, \"Communaut\u00e9 financi\u00e8re africaine\"; in equatorial Africa, \"Coop\u00e9ration financi\u00e8re en Afrique centrale\"), originally (1945) worth 1.7 French francs and then from 1948, 2 francs (from 1960: 0.02 new franc) but after January 1994 worth only 0.01 French franc. Therefore, from January 1999, 1 CFA franc is equivalent to \u20ac0.00152449.\nA separate (franc CFP) circulates in France's Pacific territories, worth \u20ac0.0084 (formerly 0.055 French franc).\nComorian franc.\nIn 1981, the Comoros established an arrangement with the French government similar to that of the CFA franc. Originally, 50 Comorian francs were worth 1 French franc. In January 1994, the rate was changed to 75 Comorian francs to the French franc. Since 1999, the currency has been pegged to the euro.\nBelgian franc and Luxembourg franc.\nThe conquest of most of western Europe by Revolutionary and Napoleonic France led to the franc's wide circulation. Following independence from the Kingdom of the Netherlands, the new Kingdom of Belgium in 1832 adopted its own Belgian franc, equivalent to the French one, followed by Luxembourg adopting the Luxembourgish franc in 1848 and Switzerland in 1850. Newly unified Italy adopted the lira on a similar basis in 1862.\nIn 1865, France, Belgium, Switzerland and Italy created the Latin Monetary Union (to be joined by Spain and Greece in 1868): each would possess a national currency unit (franc, lira, peseta, drachma) worth 4.5\u00a0g of silver or of gold (fine), all freely exchangeable at a rate of 1:1. In the 1870s the gold value was made the fixed standard, a situation which was to continue until 1914.\nIn 1926, Belgium as well as France experienced depreciation and an abrupt collapse of confidence, leading to the introduction of a new gold currency for international transactions, the \"belga\" of 5 francs, and the country's withdrawal from the monetary union, which ceased to exist at the end of the year. The 1921 monetary union of Belgium and Luxembourg survived and formed the basis for full economic union in 1932.\nLike the French franc, the Belgian and Luxembourg francs ceased to exist on 1 January 1999, when they became fixed at 1\u00a0EUR = 40.3399\u00a0BEF/LUF, thus a Belgian or Luxembourg franc was worth \u20ac0.024789. Old franc coins and notes lost their legal tender status on 28 February 2002.\nOne Luxembourg franc was equal to one Belgian franc. Belgian francs were legal tender inside Luxembourg, and Luxembourg francs were legal tender in the whole of Belgium. (In reality, Luxembourg francs were only accepted as means of payment by shops and businesses in the Belgian province of Luxembourg adjacent to the independent Grand Duchy of Luxembourg, this for historical reasons.)\nThe equivalent name of the Belgian franc in Dutch and German, Belgium's other official languages, was . As mentioned before, in Luxembourg the franc was called (plural ) in Luxembourgish.\nSwiss franc and Liechtenstein franc.\nThe Swiss franc (ISO code: CHF or 756; ; ), which appreciated significantly against the new European currency from April to September 2000, remains one of the world's strongest currencies, worth as of \u00a02023[ [update]] just over one euro. The Swiss franc is used in Switzerland and in Liechtenstein. Liechtenstein retains the ability to mint its own currency, the Liechtenstein franc, which it does from time to time for commemorative or emergency purposes.\nThe name of the country \"Swiss Confederation\" is found on some of the coins in Latin (\"Confoederatio Helvetica\"), as Switzerland has four official languages, all of which are used on the notes. The denomination is abbreviated \"Fr.\" on the coins which is the abbreviation in all four languages.\nSaar franc.\nThe Saar franc, linked at par to the French franc, was introduced in the Saar Protectorate in 1948. On 1 January 1957, the territory joined the Federal Republic of Germany, nevertheless, in its new member state of Saarland, the Saar franc continued to be the currency until 6 July 1959.\nThe name of the Saar franc in German, the main official language in the Protectorate, was \"Franken\". Coins displaying German inscriptions and the coat of arms of the Protectorate were circulated and used together with French francs. As banknotes, only French franc bills existed."}

{"id": "10819", "revid": "48035214", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=10819", "title": "Federal Reserve", "text": "Central banking system of the US\nThe Federal Reserve System (often shortened to the Federal Reserve, or simply the Fed) is the central banking system of the United States. It was created on December 23, 1913, with the enactment of the Federal Reserve Act, after a series of financial panics (particularly the panic of 1907) led to the desire for central control of the monetary system in order to alleviate financial crises. Although an instrument of the U.S. government, the Federal Reserve System considers itself \"an independent central bank because its monetary policy decisions do not have to be approved by the president or by anyone else in the executive or legislative branches of government, it does not receive funding appropriated by Congress, and the terms of the members of the board of governors span multiple presidential and congressional terms.\" Over the years, events such as the Great Depression in the 1930s and the Great Recession during the 2000s have led to the expansion of the roles and responsibilities of the Federal Reserve System.\nCongress established three key objectives for monetary policy in the Federal Reserve Act: maximizing employment, stabilizing prices, and moderating long-term interest rates. The first two objectives are sometimes referred to as the Federal Reserve's dual mandate. Its duties have expanded over the years, and include supervising and regulating banks, maintaining the stability of the financial system, and providing financial services to depository institutions, the U.S. government, and foreign official institutions. The Fed also conducts research into the economy and provides numerous publications, such as the Beige Book and the FRED database.\nThe Federal Reserve System is composed of several layers. It is governed by the presidentially appointed board of governors or Federal Reserve Board (FRB). Twelve regional Federal Reserve Banks, located in cities throughout the nation, regulate and oversee privately owned commercial banks. Nationally chartered commercial banks are required to hold stock in, and can elect some board members of, the Federal Reserve Bank of their region.\nThe Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) sets monetary policy by adjusting the target for the federal funds rate, which generally influences market interest rates and, in turn, US economic activity via the monetary transmission mechanism. The FOMC consists of all seven members of the board of governors and the twelve regional Federal Reserve Bank presidents, though only five bank presidents vote at a time: the president of the New York Fed and four others who rotate through one-year voting terms. There are also various advisory councils. It has a structure unique among central banks, and is also unusual in that the United States Department of the Treasury, an entity outside of the central bank, prints the currency used.\nThe federal government sets the salaries of the board's seven governors, and it receives all the system's annual profits after dividends on member banks' capital investments are paid, and an account surplus is maintained. In 2015, the Federal Reserve earned a net income of $100.2 billion and transferred $97.7 billion to the U.S. Treasury, and 2020 earnings were approximately $88.6 billion with remittances to the U.S. Treasury of $86.9 billion. The Federal Reserve has been criticized for its approach to managing inflation, perceived lack of transparency, and its role in economic downturns. Figures such as Milton Friedman and Ron Paul have argued that its actions, such as expansionary policies and bailouts, contribute to inflation, asset bubbles, and moral hazard. Critics have also noted that the shift from the gold standard to fiat currency has led to long-term inflation and financial instability, with some calling for the Fed's abolition or greater accountability through audits.\nPurpose.\nBefore the founding of the Federal Reserve System, the United States underwent several financial crises. A particularly severe crisis in 1907 led Congress to enact the Federal Reserve Act in 1913. The primary declared motivation for creating the Federal Reserve System was to address banking panics. Other stated purposes, are \"to furnish an elastic currency, to afford means of rediscounting commercial paper, [and] to establish a more effective supervision of banking in the United States\". \nToday, the purposes of the Federal Reserve include the responsibilities to:\nFractional-reserve bank.\nBanks usually invest the majority of the funds received from depositors. However, banking institutions in the United States are required to hold reserves\u200d\u2014\u200camounts of currency and deposits in other banks\u200d\u2014\u200cequal to a fraction of the amount of the bank's deposit liabilities owed to customers. This practice is called fractional-reserve banking. On rare occasions, too many of the bank's customers will withdraw their savings such that the bank cannot continue operating on its own; this is called a bank run. Bank runs can lead to a multitude of social and economic problems. The Federal Reserve System was designed as an attempt to prevent or minimize the occurrence of bank runs, and possibly act as a lender of last resort when a bank run occurs. Many economists, following Nobel laureate Milton Friedman, believe that the Federal Reserve inappropriately refused to lend money to small banks during the bank runs of 1929; Friedman argued that this contributed to the Great Depression.\nCheck clearing system.\nBefore the establishment of the Federal Reserve, during times of economic uncertainty, some banks refused to clear checks from certain other banks, which led to large-scale bank failure in the early 20th-century. Hence, a national check-clearing system was created in the Federal Reserve System. The Federal Reserve can physically accept and transport cheques.\nLender of last resort.\nIn the United States of America, the Federal Reserve serves as the lender of last resort to those institutions that cannot obtain credit elsewhere, institutions the collapse of which would have serious implications for the economy. It took over this role from the private sector clearing houses which operated during the . The availability of liquidity is intended to prevent bank runs.\nFluctuations.\nReserve Banks provide liquidity to banks to meet short-term needs stemming from seasonal fluctuations in deposits or unexpected withdrawals through its discount window and credit operations. Longer-term liquidity may also be provided in exceptional circumstances. The rate the Fed charges banks for these loans is called the discount rate (officially the primary credit rate). By making these loans, the Fed serves as a buffer against unexpected day-to-day fluctuations in reserve demand and supply. This contributes to the effective functioning of the banking system, alleviates pressure in the reserves market, and reduces the extent of unexpected movements in the interest rates. For example, on September 16, 2008, the Federal Reserve Board authorized an $85\u00a0billion loan to stave off the bankruptcy of international insurance giant American International Group (AIG).\nCentral bank.\nAs the central bank of the United States, the Fed serves as a banker's bank and as the government's bank. As the banker's bank, it helps to assure the safety and efficiency of the payments system. As the government's bank or fiscal agent, the Fed processes a variety of financial transactions involving trillions of dollars. The U.S. Treasury keeps a checking account with the Federal Reserve, through which incoming federal tax deposits and outgoing government payments are handled. As part of this service relationship, the Fed sells and redeems U.S. government securities such as savings bonds and Treasury bills, notes and bonds. It also issues the nation's coin and paper currency. The U.S. Treasury, through its Bureau of the Mint and Bureau of Engraving and Printing, actually produces the nation's cash supply and, in effect, sells the paper currency to the Federal Reserve Banks at manufacturing cost, and the coins at face value. The Federal Reserve Banks then distribute it to other financial institutions in various ways. During the Fiscal Year 2020, the Bureau of Engraving and Printing delivered 57.95\u00a0billion notes at an average cost of 7.4 cents per note.\nFederal funds.\nFederal funds, officially Federal Reserve Deposits, are the reserve balances that private banks keep at their local Federal Reserve Bank. These balances are the namesake reserves of the Federal Reserve System. The purpose of keeping funds at a Federal Reserve Bank is to have a mechanism for private banks to lend funds to one another. This market for funds plays an important role in the Federal Reserve System as it is the basis for its monetary policy work. Monetary policy is put into effect partly by influencing how much interest the private banks charge each other for the lending of these funds. Federal reserve accounts contain federal reserve credit, which can be converted into federal reserve notes.\nBank regulator.\nThe Federal Reserve regulates private banks. The system was designed out of a compromise between the competing philosophies of privatization and government regulation. In 2006 Donald L. Kohn, vice chairman of the board of governors, summarized the history of this compromise:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Agrarian and progressive interests, led by William Jennings Bryan, favored a central bank under public, rather than banker, control. However, the vast majority of the nation's bankers, concerned about government intervention in the banking business, opposed a central bank structure directed by political appointees.\nThe legislation that Congress ultimately adopted in 1913 reflected a hard-fought battle to balance these two competing views and created the hybrid public-private, centralized-decentralized structure that we have today.\nIn the structure of the Federal Reserve System, private banks elect members of the board of directors at their regional Federal Reserve Bank while the members of the board of governors are selected by the president of the United States and confirmed by the United States Senate.\nGovernment regulation and supervision.\nThe Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System has a number of supervisory and regulatory responsibilities in the U.S. banking system, but not complete responsibility. A general description of the types of regulation and supervision involved in the U.S. banking system is given by the Federal Reserve:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The Board also plays a major role in the supervision and regulation of the U.S. banking system. It has supervisory responsibilities for state-chartered banks that are members of the Federal Reserve System, bank holding companies (companies that control banks), the foreign activities of member banks, the U.S. activities of foreign banks, and Edge Act and \"agreement corporations\" (limited-purpose institutions that engage in a foreign banking business). The Board and, under delegated authority, the Federal Reserve Banks, supervise approximately 900 state member banks and 5,000 bank holding companies. Other federal agencies also serve as the primary federal supervisors of commercial banks; the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency supervises national banks, and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation supervises state banks that are not members of the Federal Reserve System.\nSome regulations issued by the Board apply to the entire banking industry, whereas others apply only to member banks, that is, state banks that have chosen to join the Federal Reserve System and national banks, which by law must be members of the System. The Board also issues regulations to carry out major federal laws governing consumer credit protection, such as the Truth in Lending, Equal Credit Opportunity, and Home Mortgage Disclosure Acts. Many of these consumer protection regulations apply to various lenders outside the banking industry as well as to banks.\nMembers of the Board of Governors are in continual contact with other policy makers in government. They frequently testify before congressional committees on the economy, monetary policy, banking supervision and regulation, consumer credit protection, financial markets, and other matters.\nThe Board has regular contact with members of the President's Council of Economic Advisers and other key economic officials. The Chair also meets from time to time with the President of the United States and has regular meetings with the Secretary of the Treasury. The Chair has formal responsibilities in the international arena as well.The Federal Banking Agency Audit Act, enacted in 1978 as Public Law 95-320 and 31 U.S.C. section 714 establish that the board of governors of the Federal Reserve System and the Federal Reserve banks may be audited by the Government Accountability Office (GAO). The GAO has authority to audit check-processing, currency storage and shipments, and some regulatory and bank examination functions \u2013 though there are restrictions to what the GAO may audit. \nRegulatory and oversight responsibilities.\nThe board of directors of each Federal Reserve Bank District also has regulatory and supervisory responsibilities. If the board of directors of a district bank has judged that a member bank is performing or behaving poorly, it will report this to the board of governors. This policy is described in law:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Each Federal reserve bank shall keep itself informed of the general character and amount of the loans and investments of its member banks with a view to ascertaining whether undue use is being made of bank credit for the speculative carrying of or trading in securities, real estate, or commodities, or for any other purpose inconsistent with the maintenance of sound credit conditions; and, in determining whether to grant or refuse advances, rediscounts, or other credit accommodations, the Federal reserve bank shall give consideration to such information. The chairman of the Federal reserve bank shall report to the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System any such undue use of bank credit by any member bank, together with his recommendation. Whenever, in the judgment of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, any member bank is making such undue use of bank credit, the Board may, in its discretion, after reasonable notice and an opportunity for a hearing, suspend such bank from the use of the credit facilities of the Federal Reserve System and may terminate such suspension or may renew it from time to time.\nNational payments system.\nIn the Depository Institutions Deregulation and Monetary Control Act of 1980, Congress reaffirmed that the Federal Reserve should promote an efficient nationwide payments system. The act subjects all depository institutions, not just member commercial banks, to reserve requirements and grants them equal access to Reserve Bank payment services. The twelve Federal Reserve Banks provide banking services to depository institutions and to the federal government. For depository institutions, they maintain accounts and provide various payment services, including collecting checks, electronically transferring funds, and distributing and receiving currency and coin. For the federal government, the Reserve Banks act as fiscal agents, paying Treasury checks; processing electronic payments; and issuing, transferring, and redeeming U.S. government securities.\nThe Federal Reserve plays a role in the nation's retail and wholesale payments systems by providing financial services to depository institutions. Retail payments are generally for relatively small-dollar amounts and often involve a depository institution's retail clients. The Reserve Banks' retail banking services include distributing currency and coin, collecting checks, electronically transferring funds through FedACH (the Federal Reserve's automated clearing house system), and beginning in 2023, facilitating instant payments using the FedNow service. The Reserve Banks' wholesale banking services include electronically transferring funds through the Fedwire Funds Service and transferring securities issued by the U.S. government, its agencies, and certain other entities through the Fedwire Securities Service. Unlike retail services, wholesale payments are generally for large-dollar amounts and often involve a depository institution's large corporate customers or counterparties.\nStructure.\nThe Federal Reserve System has a \"unique structure that is both public and private\" and is described as \"independent within the government\" rather than \"independent of government\". The System does not draw upon public funding, and derives its authority and purpose from the Federal Reserve Act, which was passed by Congress in 1913 and is subject to Congressional modification or repeal. The four main components of the Federal Reserve System are the board of governors, the Federal Open Market Committee, the twelve regional Federal Reserve Banks, and the member banks throughout the country.\nBoard of governors.\nThe seven-member board of governors is a large federal agency that functions in business oversight by examining national banks. It is charged with the overseeing of the 12 District Reserve Banks and setting national monetary policy. It also supervises and regulates the U.S. banking system in general. Governors are appointed by the president of the United States and confirmed by the Senate for staggered 14-year terms. One term begins every two years, on February 1 of even-numbered years, and members serving a full term cannot be renominated for a second term. \"[U]pon the expiration of their terms of office, members of the Board shall continue to serve until their successors are appointed and have qualified.\" The law provides for the removal of a member of the board by the president of the United States \"for cause\". The board is required to make an annual report of operations to the Speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives.\nThe chair and vice chair of the board of governors are appointed by the president of the United States from among the sitting governors. They both serve a four-year term and they can be renominated as many times as the president chooses, until their terms on the board of governors expire.\nList of members of the board of governors.\nThe current members of the board of governors are:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFederal Open Market Committee.\nThe Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) consists of 12 members, seven from the board of governors and five from the regional Federal Reserve Bank presidents, and must obtain consensus on all decisions. The FOMC oversees and sets policy on open market operations, the principal tool of national monetary policy. The FOMC also directs operations undertaken by the Federal Reserve in foreign exchange markets. All Regional Reserve Bank presidents contribute to the committee's assessment of the economy and of policy options, but only the five presidents who are then members of the FOMC vote on policy decisions. The FOMC determines its own internal organization and, by tradition, elects the chair of the board of governors as its chair and the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York as its vice chair. Formal meetings typically are held eight times each year in Washington, D.C.\nThere is very strong consensus among economists against politicising the FOMC.\nFederal Advisory Council.\nThe Federal Advisory Council (FAC) is a statutory body established under the Federal Reserve Act of 1913 to provide the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System with insights and recommendations from the banking industry and regional economic perspectives. Comprising one representative from each of the 12 Federal Reserve Districts, the Council meets at least four times annually in Washington, D.C. to discuss economic and banking issues and offer advisory opinions to the Board. Each Federal Reserve Bank\u2019s board of directors selects its district\u2019s representative, typically a senior executive from a member bank, ensuring diverse geographic and institutional input.\nFederal Reserve Banks.\nThere are 12 Federal Reserve Banks, each of which is responsible for member banks located in its district. They are located in Boston, New York, Philadelphia, Cleveland, Richmond, Atlanta, Chicago, St. Louis, Minneapolis, Kansas City, Dallas, and San Francisco. The size of each district was set based upon the population distribution of the United States when the Federal Reserve Act was passed. The charter and organization of each bank is established by law and cannot be altered by the member banks. Each regional bank has a president, who is the chief executive officer of their bank. Each president is nominated by their bank's board of directors, but the nomination is contingent upon approval by the board of governors. Presidents serve five-year terms and may be reappointed. \nMember banks.\nA member bank is a private institution and owns stock in its regional Federal Reserve Bank. All nationally chartered banks hold stock in one of the Federal Reserve Banks. State chartered banks may choose to be members (and hold stock in their regional Federal Reserve bank) upon meeting certain standards. The amount of stock a member bank must own is equal to 3% of its combined capital and surplus. About 38% of U.S. banks are members of their regional Federal Reserve Bank.\nHolding stock in a Federal Reserve bank is not like owning stock in a publicly traded company. These stocks cannot be sold or traded, and member banks do not control the Federal Reserve Bank as a result of owning this stock. From their Regional Bank, member banks with $10\u00a0billion or less in assets receive a dividend of 6%, while member banks with more than $10\u00a0billion in assets receive the lesser of 6% or the current 10-year Treasury auction rate. The remainder of the regional Federal Reserve Banks' profits is given over to the United States Treasury Department. In 2015, the Federal Reserve Banks made a profit of $100.2\u00a0billion and distributed $2.5\u00a0billion in dividends to member banks as well as returning $97.7\u00a0billion to the U.S. Treasury.\nAccountability.\nAn external auditor selected by the audit committee of the Federal Reserve System regularly audits the Board of Governors and the Federal Reserve Banks. The GAO will audit some activities of the Board of Governors. These audits do not cover \"most of the Fed's monetary policy actions or decisions, including discount window lending, open-market operations and any other transactions made under the direction of the Federal Open Market Committee\" ...[nor may the GAO audit] \"dealings with foreign governments and other central banks.\"\nThe annual and quarterly financial statements prepared by the Federal Reserve System conform to a basis of accounting that is set by the Federal Reserve Board and does not conform to Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) or government Cost Accounting Standards (CAS). The financial reporting standards are defined in the Financial Accounting Manual for the Federal Reserve Banks. The cost accounting standards are defined in the Planning and Control System Manual. As of 2012[ [update]], the Federal Reserve Board has been publishing unaudited financial reports for the Federal Reserve banks every quarter.\nOn November 7, 2008, Bloomberg L.P. brought a lawsuit against the board of governors of the Federal Reserve System to force the board to reveal the identities of firms for which it provided guarantees during the 2008 financial crisis. Bloomberg, L.P. won at the trial court and the Fed's appeals were rejected at both the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit and the U.S. Supreme Court. The data was released on March 31, 2011.\nMonetary policy.\nThe term \"monetary policy\" refers to the actions undertaken by a central bank, such as the Federal Reserve, to influence economic activity (the overall demand for goods and services) to help promote national economic goals. The Federal Reserve Act of 1913 gave the Federal Reserve authority to set monetary policy in the United States. The Fed's mandate for monetary policy is commonly known as the dual mandate of promoting maximum employment and stable prices, the latter being interpreted as a stable inflation rate of 2 percent per year on average. The Fed's monetary policy influences economic activity by influencing the general level of interest rates in the economy, which again via the monetary transmission mechanism affects households' and firms' demand for goods and services and in turn employment and inflation.\nInterbank lending.\nThe Federal Reserve sets monetary policy by influencing the federal funds rate, which is the rate of interbank lending of reserve balances. The rate that banks charge each other for these loans is determined in the interbank market, and the Federal Reserve influences this rate through the \"tools\" of monetary policy described in the \"Tools\" section below. The federal funds rate is a short-term interest rate that the FOMC focuses on, which affects the longer-term interest rates throughout the economy. The Federal Reserve explained the implementation of its monetary policy in 2021:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nChanges in the target for the federal funds rate affect overall financial conditions through various channels, including subsequent changes in the market interest rates that commercial banks and other lenders charge on short-term and longer-term loans, and changes in asset prices and in currency exchange rates, which again affects private consumption, investment and net export. By easening or tightening the stance of monetary policy, i.e. lowering or raising its target for the federal funds rate, the Fed can either spur or restrain growth in the overall US demand for goods and services.\nTools.\nThere are four main tools of monetary policy that the Federal Reserve uses to implement its monetary policy:\nFederal funds rate.\nThe Federal Reserve System implements monetary policy largely by targeting the federal funds rate. This is the interest rate that banks charge each other for overnight loans of federal funds, which are the reserves held by banks at the Fed. This rate is actually determined by the market and is not explicitly mandated by the Fed. The Fed therefore tries to align the effective federal funds rate with the targeted rate, mainly by adjusting its IORB rate. The Federal Reserve System usually adjusts the federal funds rate target by 0.25% or 0.50% at a time.\nInterest on reserve balances.\nThe interest on reserve balances (IORB) is the interest that the Fed pays on funds held by commercial banks in their reserve balance accounts at the individual Federal Reserve System banks. It is an administrated interest rate (i.e. set directly by the Fed as opposed to a market interest rate which is determined by the forces of supply and demand). As banks are unlikely to lend their reserves in the FFR market for less than they get paid by the Fed, the IORB guides the effective FFR and is used as the primary tool of the Fed's monetary policy.\nOpen market operations.\nOpen market operations are done through the sale and purchase of United States Treasury securities, or \"Treasurys\". The Federal Reserve buys Treasurys both directly and via primary dealers, which have accounts at depository institutions.\nThe Federal Reserve's objective for open market operations has varied over the years. During the 1980s, the focus gradually shifted toward attaining a specified level of the federal funds rate (the rate that banks charge each other for overnight loans of federal funds, which are the reserves held by banks at the Fed), a process that was largely complete by the end of the decade.\nUntil the 2008 financial crisis, the Fed used open market operations as its primary tool to adjust the supply of reserve balances in order to keep the federal funds rate around the Fed's target. This regime is also known as a limited reserves regime. After the 2008 financial crisis, the Federal Reserve has adopted a so-called ample reserves regime where open market operations leading to modest changes in the supply of reserves are no longer effective in influencing the FFR. Instead the Fed uses its administered rates, in particular the IORB rate, to influence the FFR. However, open market operations are still an important maintenance tool in the overall framework of the conduct of monetary policy as they are used for ensuring that reserves remain ample.\nRepurchase agreements.\nTo smooth temporary or cyclical changes in the money supply, the desk engages in repurchase agreements (repos) with its primary dealers. Repos are essentially secured, short-term lending by the Fed. On the day of the transaction, the Fed deposits money in a primary dealer's reserve account, and receives the promised securities as collateral. When the transaction matures, the process unwinds: the Fed returns the collateral and charges the primary dealer's reserve account for the principal and accrued interest. The term of the repo (the time between settlement and maturity) can vary from 1 day (called an overnight repo) to 65 days.\nDiscount window and discount rate.\nThe Federal Reserve System also directly sets the discount rate, which is the interest rate for \"discount window lending\", overnight loans that member banks borrow directly from the Fed. This rate is generally set at a rate close to 100 basis points above the target federal funds rate. The idea is to encourage banks to seek alternative funding before using the \"discount rate\" option. The equivalent operation by the European Central Bank is referred to as the \"marginal lending facility\".\nBoth the discount rate and the federal funds rate influence the prime rate, which is usually about 3 percentage points higher than the federal funds rate.\nTerm Deposit facility.\nThe Term Deposit facility is a program through which the Federal Reserve Banks offer interest-bearing term deposits to eligible institutions. It is intended to facilitate the implementation of monetary policy by providing a tool by which the Federal Reserve can manage the aggregate quantity of reserve balances held by depository institutions. Funds placed in term deposits are removed from the accounts of participating institutions for the life of the term deposit and thus drain reserve balances from the banking system. The program was announced December 9, 2009, and approved April 30, 2010, with an effective date of June 4, 2010. Fed Chair Ben S. Bernanke, testifying before the House Committee on Financial Services, stated that the Term Deposit Facility would be used to reverse the expansion of credit during the Great Recession, by drawing funds out of the money markets into the Federal Reserve Banks. It would therefore result in increased market interest rates, acting as a brake on economic activity and inflation. The Federal Reserve authorized up to five \"small-value offerings\" in 2010 as a pilot program. After three of the offering auctions were successfully completed, it was announced that small-value auctions would continue on an ongoing basis.\nQuantitative easing (QE) policy.\nA little-used tool of the Federal Reserve is the quantitative easing policy. Under that policy, the Federal Reserve buys back corporate bonds and mortgage backed securities held by banks or other financial institutions. This in effect puts money back into the financial institutions and allows them to make loans and conduct normal business.\nThe bursting of the United States housing bubble prompted the Fed to buy mortgage-backed securities for the first time in November 2008. Over six weeks, a total of $1.25\u00a0trillion were purchased in order to stabilize the housing market, about one-fifth of all U.S. government-backed mortgages.\nExpired policy tools.\nReserve requirements.\nAn instrument of monetary policy adjustment historically employed by the Federal Reserve System was the fractional reserve requirement, also known as the required reserve ratio. The required reserve ratio set the balance that the Federal Reserve System required a depository institution to hold in the Federal Reserve Banks. The required reserve ratio was set by the board of governors of the Federal Reserve System. The reserve requirements have changed over time and some history of these changes is published by the Federal Reserve.\nAs a response to the 2008 financial crisis, the Federal Reserve started making interest payments on depository institutions' required and excess reserve balances. The payment of interest on excess reserves gave the central bank greater opportunity to address credit market conditions while maintaining the federal funds rate close to the target rate set by the FOMC. The reserve requirement did not play a significant role in the post-2008 interest-on-excess-reserves regime, and in March 2020, the reserve ratio was set to zero for all banks, which meant that no bank was required to hold any reserves, and hence the reserve requirement effectively ceased to exist, though the legal framework exists for it to be reinstated at any time.\nTemporary policy tools during the 2008 financial crisis.\nIn order to address problems related to the subprime mortgage crisis and United States housing bubble, several new tools were created. The first new tool, called the Term auction facility, was added on December 12, 2007. It was announced as a temporary tool, but remained in place for a prolonged period of time. Creation of the second new tool, called the Term Securities Lending Facility, was announced on March 11, 2008. The main difference between these two facilities was that the Term auction Facility was used to inject cash into the banking system whereas the Term securities Lending Facility was used to inject treasury securities into the banking system. Creation of the third tool, called the Primary Dealer Credit Facility (PDCF), was announced on March 16, 2008. The PDCF was a fundamental change in Federal Reserve policy because it enabled the Fed to lend directly to primary dealers, which was previously against Fed policy. The differences between these three facilities was described by the Federal Reserve:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The Term auction Facility program offers term funding to depository institutions via a bi-weekly auction, for fixed amounts of credit. The Term securities Lending Facility will be an auction for a fixed amount of lending of Treasury general collateral in exchange for OMO-eligible and AAA/Aaa rated private-label residential mortgage-backed securities. The Primary Dealer Credit Facility now allows eligible primary dealers to borrow at the existing Discount Rate for up to 120 days.\nSome measures taken by the Federal Reserve to address the 2008 financial crisis had not been used since the Great Depression.\nTerm auction facility.\nThe Term auction Facility was a program in which the Federal Reserve auctioned term funds to depository institutions. The creation of this facility was announced by the Federal Reserve on December 12, 2007, and was done in conjunction with the Bank of Canada, the Bank of England, the European Central Bank, and the Swiss National Bank to address elevated pressures in short-term funding markets. The reason it was created was that banks were not lending funds to one another and banks in need of funds were refusing to go to the discount window. Banks were not lending money to each other because there was a fear that the loans would not be paid back. Banks refused to go to the discount window because it was usually associated with the stigma of bank failure. Under the Term auction Facility, the identity of the banks in need of funds was protected in order to avoid the stigma of bank failure. Foreign exchange swap lines with the European Central Bank and Swiss National Bank were opened so the banks in Europe could have access to U.S. dollars. The final Term Auction Facility auction was carried out on March 8, 2010.\nTerm securities lending facility.\nThe Term securities Lending Facility was a 28-day facility that offered Treasury general collateral to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York's primary dealers in exchange for other program-eligible collateral. It was intended to promote liquidity in the financing markets for Treasury and other collateral and thus to foster the functioning of financial markets more generally. Like the Term auction Facility, the TSLF was done in conjunction with the Bank of Canada, the Bank of England, the European Central Bank, and the Swiss National Bank. The resource allowed dealers to switch debt that was less liquid for U.S. government securities that were easily tradable. The currency swap lines with the European Central Bank and Swiss National Bank were increased. The TSLF was closed on February 1, 2010.\nPrimary dealer credit facility.\nThe Primary Dealer Credit Facility (PDCF) was an overnight loan facility that provided funding to primary dealers in exchange for a specified range of eligible collateral and was intended to foster the functioning of financial markets more generally. The PDCF established in 2008 was closed on February 1, 2010, alongside other crisis-era facilities. A new PDCF was introduced in March 2020 in response to COVID-19-related market disruptions, and that facility ceased extending credit in 2021.\nAsset Backed Commercial Paper Money Market Mutual Fund Liquidity Facility.\nThe Asset Backed Commercial Paper Money Market Mutual Fund Liquidity Facility (ABCPMMMFLF) was also called the AMLF. The Facility began operations on September 22, 2008, and was closed on February 1, 2010. All U.S. depository institutions, bank holding companies (parent companies or U.S. broker-dealer affiliates), or U.S. branches and agencies of foreign banks were eligible to borrow under this facility pursuant to the discretion of the FRBB.\nCollateral eligible for pledge under the Facility was required to meet the following criteria:\nCommercial Paper Funding Facility.\nOn October 7, 2008, the Federal Reserve further expanded the collateral it would loan against to include commercial paper using the Commercial Paper Funding Facility (CPFF). The action made the Fed a crucial source of credit for non-financial businesses in addition to commercial banks and investment firms. Fed officials said they would buy as much of the debt as necessary to get the market functioning again. They refused to say how much that might be, but they noted that around $1.3 trillion worth of commercial paper would qualify. There was $1.61 trillion in outstanding commercial paper, seasonally adjusted, on the market as of 2008[ [update]], according to the most recent data from the Fed. That was down from $1.70 trillion in the previous week. Since the summer of 2007, the market had shrunk from more than $2.2 trillion. This program lent out a total $738 billion before it was closed. Forty-five out of 81 of the companies participating in this program were foreign firms. Research shows that Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) recipients were twice as likely to participate in the program than other commercial paper issuers who did not take advantage of the TARP bailout. The Fed incurred no losses from the CPFF.\nIn response to the economic disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, the Federal Reserve reintroduced the Commercial Paper Funding Facility (CPFF) on March 17, 2020, to support the flow of credit to households and businesses by purchasing eligible commercial paper. The CPFF was modeled after the 2008 crisis-era facility and aimed to stabilize the commercial paper market. The facility ceased operations on March 31, 2021, and is not in place as of April 2025.\nTerm Asset-Backed Security Loan Facility.\nThe Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility (TALF) was a temporary program announced on November 25, 2008, and launched in March 2009 by the Federal Reserve in collaboration with the U.S. Treasury to stimulate consumer and business lending. It provided non-recourse loans to investors to purchase asset-backed securities (ABS), such as auto loans, student loans, and credit card receivables, aiming to enhance liquidity in these markets. The facility ceased issuing new loans in June 2010 and was fully wound down by 2015. As a significant tool during the 2008 financial crisis, TALF focused on ABS markets rather than direct banking system liquidity, distinguishing it from other crisis-era facilities.\nHistory.\nCentral banking in the United States, 1791\u20131913.\nThe first attempt at a national currency was during the American Revolutionary War. In 1775, the Continental Congress, as well as the states, began issuing paper currency, calling the bills \"Continentals\". The Continentals were backed only by future tax revenue, and were used to help finance the Revolutionary War. Overprinting, as well as British counterfeiting, caused the value of the Continental to diminish quickly. This experience with paper money led the United States to strip the power to issue Bills of Credit (paper money) from a draft of the new Constitution on August 16, 1787, as well as banning such issuance by the various states, and limiting the states' ability to make anything but gold or silver coin legal tender on August 28.\nIn 1791, the government granted the First Bank of the United States a charter to operate as the U.S. central bank until 1811. The First Bank of the United States came to an end under President Madison when Congress refused to renew its charter. The Second Bank of the United States was established in 1816, and lost its authority to be the central bank of the U.S. twenty years later under President Jackson when its charter expired. Both banks were based upon the Bank of England. Ultimately, a third national bank, known as the Federal Reserve, was established in 1913 and still exists to this day.\nFirst Central Bank, 1791 and Second Central Bank, 1816.\nThe first U.S. institution with central banking responsibilities was the First Bank of the United States, chartered by Congress and signed into law by President George Washington on February 25, 1791, at the urging of Alexander Hamilton. This was done despite strong opposition from Thomas Jefferson and James Madison, among numerous others. The charter was for twenty years and expired in 1811 under President Madison, when Congress refused to renew it.\nIn 1816, however, Madison revived it in the form of the Second Bank of the United States. Years later, early renewal of the bank's charter became the primary issue in the reelection of President Andrew Jackson. After Jackson, who was opposed to the central bank, was reelected, he pulled the government's funds out of the bank. Jackson was the only President to completely pay off the national debt but his efforts to close the bank contributed to the Panic of 1837. The bank's charter was not renewed in 1836, and it would fully dissolve after several years as a private corporation.\nFrom 1837 to 1862, in the Free Banking Era there was no formal central bank. From 1846 to 1921, an Independent Treasury System ruled.\nFrom 1863 to 1913, a system of national banks was instituted by the 1863 National Banking Act during which a series of bank panics, in 1873, 1893, and 1907 occurred.\nCreation of Third Central Bank, 1907\u20131913.\nThe main motivation for the third central banking system came from the Panic of 1907, which caused a renewed desire among legislators, economists, and bankers for an overhaul of the monetary system. During the last quarter of the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th century, the United States economy went through a series of financial panics. According to many economists, the previous national banking system had two main weaknesses: an inelastic currency and a lack of liquidity. In 1908, Congress enacted the Aldrich\u2013Vreeland Act, which provided for an emergency currency and established the National Monetary Commission to study banking and currency reform. The National Monetary Commission returned with recommendations which were repeatedly rejected by Congress. A revision crafted during a secret meeting on Jekyll Island by Senator Aldrich and representatives of the nation's top finance and industrial groups later became the basis of the Federal Reserve Act.\nFederal Reserve Act, 1913.\nThe head of the bipartisan National Monetary Commission was financial expert and Senate Republican leader Nelson Aldrich. Aldrich set up two commissions \u2013 one to study the American monetary system in depth and the other, headed by Aldrich himself, to study the European central banking systems and report on them.\nIn early November 1910, Aldrich met with five well known members of the New York banking community to devise a central banking bill. Paul Warburg, an attendee of the meeting and longtime advocate of central banking in the U.S., later wrote that Aldrich was \"bewildered at all that he had absorbed abroad and he was faced with the difficult task of writing a highly technical bill while being harassed by the daily grind of his parliamentary duties\". After ten days of deliberation, the bill, which would later be referred to as the \"Aldrich Plan\", was agreed upon. It had several key components, including a central bank with a Washington-based headquarters and fifteen branches located throughout the U.S. in geographically strategic locations, and a uniform elastic currency based on gold and commercial paper. Aldrich believed a central banking system with no political involvement was best, but was convinced by Warburg that a plan with no public control was not politically feasible. The compromise involved representation of the public sector on the board of directors.\nAldrich's bill met much opposition from politicians. Critics charged Aldrich of being biased due to his close ties to wealthy bankers such as J. P. Morgan and John D. Rockefeller Jr., Aldrich's son-in-law. Most Republicans favored the Aldrich Plan, but it lacked enough support in Congress to pass because rural and western states viewed it as favoring the \"eastern establishment\". In contrast, progressive Democrats favored a reserve system owned and operated by the government; they believed that public ownership of the central bank would end Wall Street's control of the American currency supply. Conservative Democrats fought for a privately owned, yet decentralized, reserve system, which would still be free of Wall Street's control.\nThe original Aldrich Plan was dealt a fatal blow in 1912, when Democrats won the White House and Congress. Nonetheless, President Woodrow Wilson believed that the Aldrich plan would suffice with a few modifications. The plan became the basis for the Federal Reserve Act, which was proposed by Senator Robert Owen in May 1913. The primary difference between the two bills was the transfer of control of the board of directors (called the Federal Open Market Committee in the Federal Reserve Act) to the government. The bill passed Congress on December 23, 1913, on a mostly partisan basis, with most Democrats voting \"yea\" and most Republicans voting \"nay\".\nThe House voted on December 22, 1913, with 298 voting yes to 60 voting no. The Senate voted 43\u201325 on December 23, 1913. President Woodrow Wilson signed the bill later that day.\nFederal Reserve era, 1913\u2013present.\nKey laws affecting the Federal Reserve have been:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nThe Banking Act of 1935 created the modern structure of the Federal Reserve and placed monetary decisions beyond presidential control, thus enshrining the independence of the Federal Reserve.\nEconomic data.\nThe Federal Reserve records and publishes large amounts of data, including the Board of Governors' Economic Data and Research page, Statistical Releases and Historical Data Page, and the St. Louis Fed's FRED (Federal Reserve Economic Data) page. The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) examines many economic indicators prior to determining monetary policy. Some economists have criticised the economic data compiled by the Fed. The Fed sponsors much of the monetary economics research in the U.S., and Lawrence H. White objects that this makes it less likely for researchers to publish findings challenging the status quo.\nNet worth of households and nonprofit organizations.\nThe net worth of households and nonprofit organizations in the United States is published by the Federal Reserve in a report titled \"Flow of Funds\". At the end of the third quarter of fiscal year 2012, this value was $64.8 trillion. At the end of the first quarter of fiscal year 2014, this value was $95.5 trillion. As of the fourth quarter of 2024, the net worth of households and nonprofit organizations reached $172.7 trillion, driven primarily by gains in corporate equity and real estate values.\nMoney supply.\nThe most common measures are named M0 (narrowest), M1, M2, and M3. In the United States they are defined by the Federal Reserve as follows:\nThe Federal Reserve stopped publishing M3 statistics in March 2006, saying that the data cost a lot to collect but did not provide significantly useful information. The other three money supply measures continue to be provided in detail.\nPersonal consumption expenditures price index.\nThe personal consumption expenditures price index, also referred to as simply the PCE price index, is used as one measure of the value of money. It is a United States-wide indicator of the average increase in prices for all domestic personal consumption. Using a variety of data including United States Consumer Price Index and U.S. Producer Price Index prices, it is derived from the largest component of the gross domestic product in the BEA's National Income and Product Accounts, personal consumption expenditures.\nOne of the Fed's main roles is to maintain price stability, which means that the Fed's ability to keep a low inflation rate is a long-term measure of their success. Although the Fed is not required to maintain inflation within a specific range, their long run target for the growth of the PCE price index is between 1.5 and 2 percent. There has been debate among policy makers as to whether the Federal Reserve should have a specific inflation targeting policy.\nInflation and the economy.\nMost mainstream economists favor a low, steady rate of inflation. Chief economist, and advisor to the Federal Reserve, the Congressional Budget Office and the Council of Economic Advisers, Diane C. Swonk observed, in 2022, that \"From the Fed's perspective, you have to remember inflation is kind of like cancer. If you don't deal with it now with something that may be painful, you could have something that metastasized and becomes much more chronic later on.\"\nLow (as opposed to zero or negative) inflation may reduce the severity of economic recessions by enabling the labor market to adjust more quickly in a downturn, and reduce the risk that a liquidity trap prevents monetary policy from stabilizing the economy. The task of keeping the rate of inflation low and stable is usually given to monetary authorities.\nBudget.\nThe Federal Reserve is self-funded. Over 90% of Fed revenues come from open market operations, specifically the interest on the portfolio of Treasury securities as well as \"capital gains/losses\" that may arise from the buying/selling of the securities and their derivatives as part of Open Market Operations. The balance of revenues come from sales of financial services (check and electronic payment processing) and discount window loans. \nThe Federal Reserve Board creates a budget report once per year for Congress. There are two reports with budget information. The one that lists the complete balance statements with income and expenses, as well as the net profit or loss, is the large report simply titled, \"Annual Report\". It also includes data about employment throughout the system. The other report, which explains in more detail the expenses of the different aspects of the whole system, is called \"Annual Report: Budget Review\".\nRemittance payments to the Treasury.\nThe Federal Reserve has been remitting interest that it has been receiving back to the United States Treasury. Most of the assets the Fed holds are U.S. Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities that it has been purchasing as part of quantitative easing since the 2008 financial crisis. In 2022, the Fed started quantitative tightening (QT) and selling these assets and taking a loss on them in the secondary bond market. As a result, the nearly $100billion that it was remitting annually to the Treasury, is expected to be discontinued during QT.\nIn 2023, the Federal Reserve reported a net negative income of $114.3 billion. This triggered the creation of a deferred asset liability on the Federal Reserve balance sheet booked as \"Interest on Federal Reserve notes due to U.S. Treasury\" totaling $133.3 billion. The deferred asset is the amount of net excess revenues the Federal Reserve must realize before remittances can continue. It does not have any impact on the ability of the Federal Reserve to conduct monetary policy or meet its obligations. The Federal Reserve has estimated the deferred asset will last until mid-2027.\nBalance sheet.\nOne of the keys to understanding the Federal Reserve is the Federal Reserve balance sheet (or balance statement). In accordance with Section 11 of the Federal Reserve Act, the board of governors of the Federal Reserve System publishes once each week the \"Consolidated Statement of Condition of All Federal Reserve Banks\" showing the condition of each Federal Reserve bank and a consolidated statement for all Federal Reserve banks. The board of governors requires that excess earnings of the Reserve Banks be transferred to the Treasury as interest on Federal Reserve notes.\nThe Federal Reserve releases its balance sheet every Thursday. Below is the balance sheet as of 2021[ [update]] (in billions of dollars):\nIn addition, the balance sheet also indicates which assets are held as collateral against Federal Reserve Notes.\nAs of August 2024, the Fed's total assets on balance sheet are $7.139 trillion.\nCriticism.\nThe Federal Reserve System has faced various criticisms since its inception in 1913. Some of the most common critiques focus on its monetary policy, lack of transparency, and its potential role in exacerbating financial instability. Critics argue that the Fed\u2019s expansionary policies\u2014such as lowering interest rates and increasing the money supply\u2014can lead to inflation, asset bubbles, and economic distortions. Prominent economists like Milton Friedman have criticized the Fed for contributing to economic downturns, including its role in the Great Depression. Libertarian figures such as Ron Paul have been especially vocal in calling for greater accountability and transparency within the Fed, advocating for measures such as auditing the Federal Reserve to ensure it serves the public interest rather than benefiting large financial institutions. Additionally, some critics, including Rand Paul, argue that the Fed disproportionately serves the interests of the banking elite, given the backgrounds of many of its officials in finance and banking, leading to potential conflicts of interest and policies that favor Wall Street over the general economy.\nAnother area of criticism is the Federal Reserve\u2019s departure from the gold standard in 1971, which many argue has contributed to long-term inflationary pressures and a devaluation of the U.S. dollar. Ron Paul believes the Fed should be abolished and replaced with a return to the gold standard. Advocates of Austrian economics, such as Ludwig von Mises and Murray Rothbard, believe that the move to fiat currency destabilized the monetary system and undermined financial stability. The Federal Reserve\u2019s handling of the 2008 financial crisis has also been a focal point of criticism, with some arguing that the Fed\u2019s response\u2014bailing out large banks and financial institutions\u2014created moral hazard and worsened the economic collapse.\nDuring COVID-19 pandemic, the Federal Reserve's policies such as increasing its bank reserves, quantitative easing (QE), and keeping interest rates near zero until March 2022 had been criticised by economists, especially monetarists, as greatly contributing to the inflation spike which peaked at a record high in half a century.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBundled references.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "10821", "revid": "20483999", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=10821", "title": "Francium", "text": "element with atomic number 87 (Fr)\nFrancium is a chemical element; it has symbol Fr and atomic number 87. It is extremely radioactive; its most stable isotope, francium-223 (originally called \"actinium\u00a0K\" after the natural decay chain in which it appears), has a half-life of only 22\u00a0minutes. It is the second-most electropositive element, behind only caesium, and is the second rarest naturally occurring element (after astatine). Francium's isotopes decay quickly into astatine, radium, and radon. The electronic structure of a francium atom is [Rn] 7s1; thus, the element is classed as an alkali metal.\nAs a consequence of its extreme instability, bulk francium has never been seen. Because of the general appearance of the other elements in its periodic table column, it is presumed that francium would appear as a highly reactive metal if enough could be collected together to be viewed as a bulk solid or liquid. Obtaining such a sample is highly improbable since the extreme heat of decay resulting from its short half-life would immediately vaporize any viewable quantity of the element.\nFrancium was discovered by Marguerite Perey in France (from which the element takes its name) on January 7, 1939. Before its discovery, francium was referred to as \"eka-caesium\" or \"ekacaesium\" because of its conjectured existence below caesium in the periodic table. It was the last element first discovered in nature, rather than by synthesis. Outside the laboratory, francium is extremely rare, with trace amounts found in uranium ores, where the isotope francium-223 (in the family of uranium-235) continually forms and decays. As little as exists at any given time throughout the Earth's crust; aside from francium-223 and francium-221, its other isotopes are entirely synthetic. The largest amount produced in the laboratory was a cluster of more than 300,000 atoms.\nCharacteristics.\nFrancium is one of the most unstable of the naturally occurring elements: its longest-lived isotope, francium-223, has a half-life of only 22\u00a0minutes. The only comparable element is astatine, whose most stable natural isotope, astatine-219 (the alpha daughter of francium-223), has a half-life of 56\u00a0seconds, although synthetic astatine-210 is much longer-lived with a half-life of 8.1\u00a0hours. All isotopes of francium decay into astatine, radium, or radon. Francium-223 also has a shorter half-life than the longest-lived isotope known of each element up to and including element 105, dubnium.\nFrancium is an alkali metal whose chemical properties mostly resemble those of caesium. A heavy element with a single valence electron, it has the highest equivalent weight of any element. Liquid francium\u2014if created\u2014should have a surface tension of 0.05092\u00a0N/m at its melting point. Francium's melting point was estimated to be around ; a value of is also often encountered. The melting point is uncertain because of the element's extreme rarity and radioactivity; a different extrapolation based on Dmitri Mendeleev's method gave . A calculation based on the melting temperatures of binary ionic crystals gives . The estimated boiling point of is also uncertain; the estimates and , as well as the extrapolation from Mendeleev's method of , have also been suggested. The density of francium is expected to be around 2.48\u00a0g/cm3 (Mendeleev's method extrapolates 2.4\u00a0g/cm3).\nLinus Pauling estimated the electronegativity of francium at 0.7 on the Pauling scale, the same as caesium; the value for caesium has since been refined to 0.79, but there are no experimental data to allow a refinement of the value for francium. Francium has a slightly higher ionization energy than caesium, 392.811(4)\u00a0kJ/mol as opposed to 375.7041(2)\u00a0kJ/mol for caesium, as would be expected from relativistic effects, and this would imply that caesium is the less electronegative of the two. Francium should also have a higher electron affinity than caesium and the Fr\u2212 ion should be more polarizable than the Cs\u2212 ion.\nCompounds.\nAs a result of francium's instability, its salts are only known to a small extent. Francium coprecipitates with several caesium salts, such as caesium perchlorate, which results in small amounts of francium perchlorate. This coprecipitation can be used to isolate francium, by adapting the radiocaesium coprecipitation method of Lawrence E. Glendenin and C. M. Nelson. It will additionally coprecipitate with many other caesium salts, including the iodate, the picrate, the tartrate (also rubidium tartrate), the chloroplatinate, and the silicotungstate. It also coprecipitates with silicotungstic acid, and with perchloric acid, without another alkali metal as a carrier, which leads to other methods of separation.\nFrancium perchlorate.\nFrancium perchlorate is produced by the reaction of francium chloride and sodium perchlorate. The francium perchlorate coprecipitates with caesium perchlorate. This coprecipitation can be used to isolate francium, by adapting the radiocaesium coprecipitation method of Lawrence E. Glendenin and C. M. Nelson. However, this method is unreliable in separating thallium, which also coprecipitates with caesium. Francium perchlorate's entropy is expected to be 42.7\u00a0e.u (178.7 J mol\u22121 K\u22121).\nFrancium halides.\nFrancium halides are all soluble in water and are expected to be white solids. They are expected to be produced by the reaction of the corresponding halogens. For example, francium chloride would be produced by the reaction of francium and chlorine. Francium chloride has been studied as a pathway to separate francium from other elements, by using the high vapour pressure of the compound, although francium fluoride would have a higher vapour pressure.\nOther compounds.\nFrancium nitrate, sulfate, hydroxide, carbonate, acetate, and oxalate, are all soluble in water, while the iodate, picrate, tartrate, chloroplatinate, and silicotungstate are insoluble. The insolubility of these compounds are used to extract francium from other radioactive products, such as zirconium, niobium, molybdenum, tin, antimony, the method mentioned in the section above. Francium oxide is believed to disproportionate to the peroxide and francium metal. The CsFr molecule is predicted to have the heavier element (francium) at the negative end of the dipole, unlike all known heterodiatomic alkali metal molecules. Francium superoxide (FrO2) is expected to have a more covalent character than its lighter congeners; this is attributed to the 6p electrons in francium being more involved in the francium\u2013oxygen bonding. The relativistic destabilisation of the 6p3/2 spinor may make francium compounds in oxidation states higher than +1 possible, such as [FrVF6]\u2212; but this has not been experimentally confirmed.\nIsotopes.\nThere are 37 known isotopes of francium ranging in atomic mass from 197 to 233. Francium has seven metastable nuclear isomers. Francium-223 and francium-221 are the only isotopes that occur in nature, with the former being far more common.\nFrancium-223 is the most stable isotope, with a half-life of 21.8\u00a0minutes, and it is highly unlikely that an isotope of francium with a longer half-life will ever be discovered or synthesized. Francium-223 is a fifth product of the uranium-235 decay series as a daughter isotope of actinium-227; thorium-227 is the more common daughter. Francium-223 then decays into radium-223 by beta decay (1.149\u00a0MeV decay energy), with a minor (0.006%) alpha decay path to astatine-219 (5.4\u00a0MeV decay energy).\nFrancium-221 has a half-life of 4.8\u00a0minutes. It is the ninth product of the neptunium decay series as a daughter isotope of actinium-225. Francium-221 then decays into astatine-217 by alpha decay (6.457\u00a0MeV decay energy). Although all primordial 237Np is extinct, the neptunium decay series continues to exist naturally in tiny traces due to (n,2n) knockout reactions in natural 238U. Francium-222, with a half-life of 14\u00a0minutes, may be produced as a result of the beta decay of natural radon-222; this process has nonetheless not yet been observed, and it is unknown whether this process is energetically possible.\nThe least stable ground state isotope is francium-215, with a half-life of 90\u00a0ns: it undergoes a 9.54\u00a0MeV alpha decay to astatine-211.\nApplications.\nDue to its instability and rarity, there are no commercial applications for francium. It has been used for research purposes in the fields of chemistry\nand of atomic structure. Its use as a potential diagnostic aid for various cancers has also been explored, but this application has been deemed impractical.\nFrancium's ability to be synthesized, trapped, and cooled, along with its relatively simple atomic structure, has made it the subject of specialized spectroscopy experiments. These experiments have led to more specific information regarding energy levels and the coupling constants between subatomic particles. Studies on the light emitted by laser-trapped francium-210 ions have provided accurate data on transitions between atomic energy levels which are fairly similar to those predicted by quantum theory. Francium is a prospective candidate for searching for CP violation.\nHistory.\nAs early as 1870, chemists thought that there should be an alkali metal beyond caesium, with an atomic number of 87. It was then referred to by the provisional name \"eka-caesium\".\nErroneous and incomplete discoveries.\nIn 1914, Stefan Meyer, Viktor F. Hess, and Friedrich Paneth (working in Vienna) made measurements of alpha radiation from various substances, including 227Ac. They observed the possibility of a minor alpha branch of this nuclide, though follow-up work could not be done due to the outbreak of World War I. Their observations were not precise and sure enough for them to announce the discovery of element 87, though it is likely that they did indeed observe the decay of 227Ac to 223Fr.\nSoviet chemist Dmitry Dobroserdov was the first scientist to claim to have found eka-caesium, or francium. In 1925, he observed weak radioactivity in a sample of potassium, another alkali metal, and incorrectly concluded that eka-caesium was contaminating the sample (the radioactivity from the sample was from the naturally occurring potassium radioisotope, potassium-40). He then published a thesis on his predictions of the properties of eka-caesium, in which he named the element \"russium\" after his home country. Shortly thereafter, Dobroserdov began to focus on his teaching career at the Polytechnic Institute of Odesa, and he did not pursue the element further.\nThe following year, English chemists Gerald J. F. Druce and Frederick H. Loring analyzed X-ray photographs of manganese(II) sulfate. They observed spectral lines which they presumed to be of eka-caesium. They announced their discovery of element 87 and proposed the name \"alkalinium\", as it would be the heaviest alkali metal.\nIn 1930, Fred Allison of the Alabama Polytechnic Institute claimed to have discovered element 87 (in addition to 85) when analyzing pollucite and lepidolite using his magneto-optical machine. Allison requested that it be named \"virginium\" after his home state of Virginia, along with the symbols Vi and Vm. In 1934, H.G. MacPherson of UC Berkeley disproved the effectiveness of Allison's device and the validity of his discovery.\nIn 1936, Romanian physicist Horia Hulubei and his French colleague Yvette Cauchois also analyzed pollucite, this time using their high-resolution X-ray apparatus. They observed several weak emission lines, which they presumed to be those of element 87. Hulubei and Cauchois reported their discovery and proposed the name \"moldavium\", along with the symbol Ml, after Moldavia, the Romanian province where Hulubei was born. In 1937, Hulubei's work was criticized by American physicist F. H. Hirsh Jr., who rejected Hulubei's research methods. Hirsh was certain that eka-caesium would not be found in nature, and that Hulubei had instead observed mercury or bismuth X-ray lines. Hulubei insisted that his X-ray apparatus and methods were too accurate to make such a mistake. Because of this, Jean Baptiste Perrin, Nobel Prize winner and Hulubei's mentor, endorsed moldavium as the true eka-caesium over Marguerite Perey's recently discovered francium. Perey took pains to be accurate and detailed in her criticism of Hulubei's work, and finally she was credited as the sole discoverer of element 87. All other previous purported discoveries of element 87 were ruled out due to francium's very limited half-life.\nPerey's analysis.\nEka-caesium was discovered on January 7, 1939, by Marguerite Perey of the Curie Institute in Paris, when she purified a sample of actinium-227 which had been reported to have a decay energy of 220\u00a0keV. Perey noticed decay particles with an energy level below 80\u00a0keV. Perey thought this decay activity might have been caused by a previously unidentified decay product, one which was separated during purification, but emerged again out of the pure actinium-227. Various tests eliminated the possibility of the unknown element being thorium, radium, lead, bismuth, or thallium. The new product exhibited chemical properties of an alkali metal (such as coprecipitating with caesium salts), which led Perey to believe that it was element 87, produced by the alpha decay of actinium-227. Perey then attempted to determine the proportion of beta decay to alpha decay in actinium-227. Her first test put the alpha branching at 0.6%, a figure which she later revised to 1%.\nPerey named the new isotope \"actinium-K\" (it is now referred to as francium-223) and in 1946, she proposed the name \"catium\" (Cm) for her newly discovered element, as she believed it to be the most electropositive cation of the elements. Ir\u00e8ne Joliot-Curie, one of Perey's supervisors, opposed the name due to its connotation of \"cat\" rather than \"cation\"; furthermore, the symbol coincided with that which had since been assigned to curium. Perey then suggested \"francium\", after France. This name was officially adopted by the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) in 1949, becoming the second element after gallium to be named after France. It was assigned the symbol Fa, but it was revised to the current Fr shortly thereafter. Francium was the last element discovered in nature, rather than synthesized, following hafnium and rhenium. Further research into francium's structure was carried out by, among others, Sylvain Lieberman and his team at CERN in the 1970s and 1980s.\nOccurrence.\n223Fr is the result of the alpha decay of 227Ac and can be found in trace amounts in uranium minerals. In a given sample of uranium, there is estimated to be only one francium atom for every 1 \u00d7 1018 uranium atoms. Only about of francium is present naturally in the earth's crust.\nProduction.\nFrancium can be synthesized by a fusion reaction when a gold-197 target is bombarded with a beam of oxygen-18 atoms from a linear accelerator in a process originally developed at the physics department of the State University of New York at Stony Brook in 1995. Depending on the energy of the oxygen beam, the reaction can yield francium isotopes with masses of 209, 210, and 211.\n197Au + 18O \u2192 209Fr + 6 n\n197Au + 18O \u2192 210Fr + 5 n\n197Au + 18O \u2192 211Fr + 4 n\nThe francium atoms leave the gold target as ions, which are neutralized by collision with yttrium and then isolated in a magneto-optical trap (MOT) in a gaseous unconsolidated state. Although the atoms only remain in the trap for about 30 seconds before escaping or undergoing nuclear decay, the process supplies a continual stream of fresh atoms. The result is a steady state containing a fairly constant number of atoms for a much longer time. The original apparatus could trap up to a few thousand atoms, while a later improved design could trap over 300,000 at a time. Sensitive measurements of the light emitted and absorbed by the trapped atoms provided the first experimental results on various transitions between atomic energy levels in francium. Initial measurements show very good agreement between experimental values and calculations based on quantum theory. The research project using this production method relocated to TRIUMF in 2012, where over 106 francium atoms have been held at a time, including large amounts of 209Fr in addition to 207Fr and 221Fr.\nOther synthesis methods include bombarding radium with neutrons, and bombarding thorium with protons, deuterons, or helium ions.\n223Fr can also be isolated from samples of its parent 227Ac, the francium being milked via elution with NH4Cl\u2013CrO3 from an actinium-containing cation exchanger and purified by passing the solution through a silicon dioxide compound loaded with barium sulfate.\nIn 1996, the Stony Brook group trapped 3000 atoms in their MOT, which was enough for a video camera to capture the light given off by the atoms as they fluoresce. Francium has not been synthesized in amounts large enough to weigh.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It is an actinide and the heaviest element that can be formed by neutron bombardment of lighter elements, and hence the last element that can be prepared in macroscopic quantities, although pure fermium metal has not been prepared yet. A total of 20 isotopes are known, with 257Fm being the longest-lived with a half-life of 100.5 days.\nFermium was discovered in the debris of the first hydrogen bomb explosion in 1952, and named after Enrico Fermi, one of the pioneers of nuclear physics. Its chemistry is typical for the late actinides, with a preponderance of the +3 oxidation state but also an accessible +2 oxidation state. Owing to the small amounts of produced fermium and all of its isotopes having relatively short half-lives, there are currently no uses for it outside basic scientific research.\nDiscovery.\nFermium was first discovered in the fallout from the 'Ivy Mike' nuclear test (1\u00a0November 1952), the first successful test of a hydrogen bomb. Initial examination of the debris from the explosion had shown the production of a new isotope of plutonium, Pu: this could only have formed by the absorption of six neutrons by a uranium-238 nucleus followed by two \u03b2\u2212\u00a0decays. At the time, the absorption of neutrons by a heavy nucleus was thought to be a rare process, but the identification of Pu raised the possibility that still more neutrons could have been absorbed by the uranium nuclei, leading to new elements.\nElement\u00a099 (einsteinium) was quickly discovered on filter papers which had been flown through clouds from the explosion (the same sampling technique that had been used to discover Pu). It was then identified in December 1952 by Albert Ghiorso and co-workers at the University of California at Berkeley. They discovered the isotope 253Es (half-life ) that was made by the capture of 15 neutrons by uranium-238 nuclei \u2013 which then underwent seven successive beta decays:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Numbered block/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSome 238U atoms, however, could capture another amount of neutrons (most likely, 16 or 17).\nThe discovery of fermium (\"Z\" \n 100) required more material, as the yield was expected to be at least an order of magnitude lower than that of element\u00a099, and so contaminated coral from the Enewetak atoll (where the test had taken place) was shipped to the University of California Radiation Laboratory in Berkeley, California, for processing and analysis. About two months after the test, a new component was isolated emitting high-energy \u03b1-particles () with a half-life of about a day. With such a short half-life, it could only arise from the \u03b2\u2212\u00a0decay of an isotope of einsteinium, and so had to be an isotope of the new element\u00a0100: it was quickly identified as 255Fm (\"t\" \nThe discovery of the new elements, and the new data on neutron capture, was initially kept secret on the orders of the U.S.\u00a0military until 1955 due to Cold War tensions. Nevertheless, the Berkeley team was able to prepare elements 99 and 100 by civilian means, through the neutron bombardment of plutonium-239, and published this work in 1954 with the disclaimer that it was not the first studies that had been carried out on the elements. The \"Ivy Mike\" studies were declassified and published in 1955.\nThe Berkeley team had been worried that another group might discover lighter isotopes of element\u00a0100 through ion-bombardment techniques before they could publish their classified research, and this proved to be the case. A group at the Nobel Institute for Physics in Stockholm independently discovered the element, producing an isotope later confirmed to be 250Fm (\"t\"1/2 \n ) by bombarding a U target with oxygen-16 ions, and published their work in May 1954. Nevertheless, the priority of the Berkeley team was generally recognized, and with it the prerogative to name the new element in honour of Enrico Fermi, the developer of the first artificial self-sustained nuclear reactor. Fermi was still alive when the name was proposed, but had died by the time it became official.\nIsotopes.\nThere are 20 known isotopes of fermium, with atomic weights of 241 to 260, of which 257Fm is the longest-lived with a half-life of 100.5\u00a0days. Other isotopes are considerably shorter: 253Fm has a half-life of 3 days, 252Fm of 25.4\u00a0h, 255Fm of 20.1\u00a0h, while 251Fm of 5.3\u00a0h, 254Fm of 3.2\u00a0h, and 256Fm of 2.67\u00a0hours. All the remaining ones have half-lives ranging from 30 minutes to less than a millisecond.\nThe neutron capture product of fermium-257, 258Fm, undergoes spontaneous fission with a half-life of just 370(14)\u00a0microseconds; 259Fm and 260Fm also undergo spontaneous fission (\"t\"1/2\u00a0= 1.5(3)\u00a0s and 4\u00a0ms respectively). This means that neutron capture does not create nuclides with a mass number greater than 257, unless carried out at extremely high flux, as in a nuclear explosion (or the astrophysical r-process), since no accessible fermium isotopes undergo beta minus decay to the next element, mendelevium. Because of this impediment in forming heavier isotopes, these short-lived isotopes 258\u2013260Fm constitute the \"fermium gap.\"\nDeliberate attempts at nuclear explosion synthesis, however, also failed to create heavier nuclei, and as a result were deemed not worth continuing,\nOccurrence.\nProduction.\nFermium is produced by the bombardment of lighter actinides with neutrons in a nuclear reactor. Fermium-257 is the heaviest isotope that is obtained via neutron capture, and can only be produced in picogram quantities. The major source is the 85\u00a0MW High Flux Isotope Reactor (HFIR) at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory in Tennessee, USA, which is dedicated to the production of transcurium (\"Z\"\u00a0&gt;\u00a096) elements. Lower mass fermium isotopes are available in greater quantities, though these isotopes (254Fm and 255Fm) are comparatively short-lived. In a \"typical processing campaign\" at Oak Ridge, tens of grams of curium are irradiated to produce decigram quantities of californium, milligram quantities of berkelium and einsteinium, and picogram quantities of fermium. However, nanogram quantities of fermium can be prepared for specific experiments. The quantities of fermium produced in 20\u2013200\u00a0kiloton thermonuclear explosions is believed to be of the order of milligrams, although it is mixed in with a huge quantity of debris; 4.0\u00a0picograms of 257Fm was recovered from 10\u00a0kilograms of debris from the \"Hutch\" test (16\u00a0July 1969). The Hutch experiment produced an estimated total of 250 micrograms of 257Fm.\nAfter production, the fermium must be separated from other actinides and from lanthanide fission products. This is usually achieved by ion-exchange chromatography, with the standard process using a cation exchanger such as Dowex\u00a050 or T eluted with a solution of ammonium \u03b1-hydroxyisobutyrate. Smaller cations form more stable complexes with the \u03b1-hydroxyisobutyrate anion, and so are preferentially eluted from the column. A rapid fractional crystallization method has also been described.\nAlthough the most stable isotope of fermium is 257Fm, with a half-life of 100.5\u00a0days, most studies are conducted on 255Fm (\"t\"1/2\u00a0= 20.07(7)\u00a0hours), since this isotope can be easily isolated as required as the decay product of 255Es (\"t\"1/2\u00a0= 39.8(12)\u00a0days).\nSynthesis in nuclear explosions.\nThe analysis of the debris at the 10-megaton \"Ivy Mike\" nuclear test was a part of long-term project, one of the goals of which was studying the efficiency of production of transuranium elements in high-power nuclear explosions. The motivation for these experiments was as follows: synthesis of such elements from uranium requires multiple neutron capture. The probability of such events increases with the neutron flux, and nuclear explosions are the most powerful neutron sources, providing densities on the order 1023 neutrons/cm2 within a microsecond, i.e. about 1029 neutrons/(cm2\u00b7s). For comparison, the flux of the HFIR reactor is 5\u00d71015 neutrons/(cm2\u00b7s). A dedicated laboratory was set up right at Enewetak Atoll for preliminary analysis of debris, as some isotopes could have decayed by the time the debris samples reached the U.S. The laboratory was receiving samples for analysis, as soon as possible, from airplanes equipped with paper filters which flew over the atoll after the tests. Whereas it was hoped to discover new chemical elements heavier than fermium, those were not found after a series of megaton explosions conducted between 1954 and 1956 at the atoll.\nThe atmospheric results were supplemented by the underground test data accumulated in the 1960s at the Nevada Test Site, as it was hoped that powerful explosions conducted in confined space might result in improved yields and heavier isotopes. Apart from traditional uranium charges, combinations of uranium with americium and thorium have been tried, as well as a mixed plutonium-neptunium charge. They were less successful in terms of yield (of material), which was attributed to stronger losses of heavy isotopes due to enhanced fission rates in heavy-element charges. Isolation of the products was found to be rather problematic, as the explosions were spreading debris through melting and vaporizing rocks under the great depth of 300\u2013600 meters, and drilling to such depth in order to extract the products was both slow and inefficient in terms of collected volumes.\nAmong the nine underground tests, which were carried between 1962 and 1969 and codenamed Anacostia (5.2 kilotons, 1962), Kennebec (&lt;5 kilotons, 1963), Par (38 kilotons, 1964), Barbel (&lt;20 kilotons, 1964), Tweed (&lt;20 kilotons, 1965), Cyclamen (13 kilotons, 1966), Kankakee (20\u2013200 kilotons, 1966), Vulcan (25 kilotons, 1966) and Hutch (20\u2013200 kilotons, 1969), the last one was most powerful and had the highest yield of transuranium elements. In the dependence on the atomic mass number, the yield showed a saw-tooth behavior with the lower values for odd isotopes, due to their higher fission rates. The major practical problem of the entire proposal, however, was collecting the radioactive debris dispersed by the powerful blast. Aircraft filters adsorbed only about 4\u00d710-14 of the total amount and collection of tons of corals at Enewetak Atoll increased this fraction by only two orders of magnitude. Extraction of about 500 kilograms of underground rocks 60 days after the Hutch explosion recovered only about 10\u22127 of the total charge. The amount of transuranium elements in this 500-kg batch was only 30 times higher than in a 0.4\u00a0kg rock picked up 7 days after the test. This observation demonstrated the highly nonlinear dependence of the transuranium elements yield on the amount of retrieved radioactive rock. In order to accelerate sample collection after the explosion, shafts were drilled at the site not after but before the test, so that the explosion would expel radioactive material from the epicenter, through the shafts, to collecting volumes near the surface. This method was tried in the Anacostia and Kennebec tests and instantly provided hundreds of kilograms of material, but with actinide concentrations 3 times lower than in samples obtained after drilling; whereas such a method could have been efficient in scientific studies of short-lived isotopes, it could not improve the overall collection efficiency of the produced actinides.\nThough no new elements (apart from einsteinium and fermium) could be detected in the nuclear test debris, and the total yields of transuranium elements were disappointingly low, these tests did provide significantly higher amounts of rare heavy isotopes than previously available in laboratories. For example, 6\u00d7109 atoms of 257Fm could be recovered after the Hutch detonation. They were then used in the studies of thermal-neutron induced fission of 257Fm and in discovery of a new fermium isotope 258Fm. Also, the rare isotope 250Cm was synthesized in large quantities, which is very difficult to produce in nuclear reactors from its progenitor 249Cm; the half-life of 249Cm (64 minutes) is much too short for months-long reactor irradiations, but is very \"long\" on the explosion timescale.\nNatural occurrence.\nBecause of the short half-life of all known isotopes of fermium, any primordial fermium, that is fermium present on Earth during its formation, has decayed by now. Synthesis of fermium from naturally occurring uranium and thorium in the Earth's crust requires multiple neutron captures, which is extremely unlikely. Therefore, most fermium is produced on Earth in laboratories, high-power nuclear reactors, or in nuclear tests, and is present for only a few months afterward.\nThe transuranic elements up to fermium should have been present in the natural nuclear fission reactor at Oklo, but any quantities produced then would have long since decayed away.\nChemistry.\nThe chemistry of fermium has only been studied in solution using tracer techniques, and no solid compounds have been prepared. Under normal conditions, fermium exists in solution as the Fm3+ ion, which has a hydration number of 16.9 and an acid dissociation constant of 1.6\u00d710\u22124 (p\"K\"a\u00a0= 3.8). Fm3+ forms complexes with a wide variety of organic ligands with hard donor atoms such as oxygen, and these complexes are usually more stable than those of the preceding actinides. It also forms anionic complexes with ligands such as chloride or nitrate and, again, these complexes appear to be more stable than those formed by einsteinium or californium. It is believed that the bonding in the complexes of the later actinides is mostly ionic in character: the Fm3+ ion is expected to be smaller than the preceding An3+ ions because of the higher effective nuclear charge of fermium, and hence fermium would be expected to form shorter and stronger metal\u2013ligand bonds.\nFermium(III) can be fairly easily reduced to fermium(II), for example with samarium(II) chloride, with which fermium(II) coprecipitates. In the precipitate, the compound fermium(II) chloride (FmCl2) was produced, though it was not purified or studied in isolation. The electrode potential has been estimated to be similar to that of the ytterbium(III)/(II) couple, or about \u22121.15\u00a0V with respect to the standard hydrogen electrode, a value which agrees with theoretical calculations. The Fm2+/Fm0 couple has an electrode potential of \u22122.37(10)\u00a0V based on polarographic measurements.\nToxicity.\nThough few people come in contact with fermium, the International Commission on Radiological Protection has set annual exposure limits for the two most stable isotopes. For fermium-253, the ingestion limit was set at 107 becquerels (1 Bq equals one decay per second), and the inhalation limit at 105 Bq; for fermium-257, at 105 Bq and 4,000 Bq respectively.\nNotes and references.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He has maintained worldwide renown as a leading composer of his era whose \"poetic genius was based on a professional technique that was without equal in his generation\".\nChopin was born in \u017belazowa Wola and grew up in Warsaw, which in 1815 became part of Congress Poland. A child prodigy, he completed his musical education and composed his early works in Warsaw before leaving Poland at age 20, less than a month before the outbreak of the November 1830 Uprising; at 21, he settled in Paris. Thereafter he gave only 30 public performances, preferring the more intimate atmosphere of the salon. He supported himself, selling his compositions and giving piano lessons, for which he was in high demand. Chopin formed a friendship with Franz Liszt and was admired by many musical contemporaries, including Robert Schumann. After a failed engagement to Maria Wodzi\u0144ska from 1836 to 1837, he maintained an often troubled relationship with the French writer Aurore Dupin (known by her pen name George Sand). A brief and unhappy visit to Mallorca with Sand in 1838\u201339 proved one of his most productive periods of composition. In his final years he was supported financially by his admirer Jane Stirling. In poor health most of his life, Chopin died in Paris in 1849 at age 39.\nAll of Chopin's compositions feature the piano. Most are for solo piano, though he also wrote two piano concertos before leaving Warsaw, some chamber music, and 19 songs set to Polish lyrics. His piano pieces are technically demanding and expanded the limits of the instrument; his own performances were noted for their nuance and sensitivity. Chopin's major piano works include mazurkas, waltzes, nocturnes, polonaises, the instrumental \"ballade\" (which Chopin created as an instrumental genre), \u00e9tudes, impromptus, scherzi, preludes, and sonatas, some published only posthumously. Among the influences on his style of composition were Polish folk music, the classical tradition of Mozart and Schubert, and the atmosphere of the Paris salons, of which he was a frequent guest. His innovations in style, harmony, and musical form, and his association of music with nationalism, were influential throughout and after the late Romantic period.\nChopin's music, his status as one of music's earliest celebrities, his indirect association with political insurrection, his high-profile love life, and his early death have made him a leading symbol of the Romantic era. His works remain popular, and he has been the subject of numerous films and biographies of varying historical fidelity. Among his many memorials is the Fryderyk Chopin Institute, which was created by the Polish parliament to research and promote his life and works, and which hosts the prestigious International Chopin Piano Competition, devoted entirely to his works.\nLife.\nEarly life.\nChildhood.\nFr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Fran\u00e7ois Chopin was born in \u017belazowa Wola, 46 kilometres () west of Warsaw, in what was then the Duchy of Warsaw, a Polish state established by Napoleon. The parish baptismal record, which is dated 23 April 1810, gives his birthday as 22 February 1810, and cites his given names in the Latin form (in Polish, he was ). The composer and his family used the birthdate 1 March, which is now generally accepted as the correct date.\nHis father, Nicolas Chopin, was a Frenchman from Lorraine who had emigrated to Poland in 1787 at the age of sixteen. He married Justyna Krzy\u017canowska, a poor relative of the Skarbeks, one of the families for whom he worked. Chopin was baptised in the same Catholic church where his parents had married, in Broch\u00f3w. His eighteen-year-old godfather, for whom he was named, was Fryderyk Skarbek, a pupil of Nicolas Chopin. Chopin was the second child of Nicolas and Justyna and their only son; he had an elder sister, Ludwika, and two younger sisters, Izabela and Emilia, whose death at the age of 14 was probably from tuberculosis. Nicolas Chopin was devoted to his adopted homeland, and insisted on the use of the Polish language in the household.\nIn October 1810, six months after Chopin's birth, the family moved to Warsaw, where his father acquired a post teaching French at the Warsaw Lyceum, then housed in the Saxon Palace. Chopin lived with his family on the Palace grounds. His father played the flute and violin; his mother played the piano and gave lessons to boys in the boarding house that the Chopins kept. Chopin was of slight build, and even in early childhood was prone to illnesses.\nChopin may have had some piano instruction from his mother, but his first professional music tutor, from 1816 to 1821, was the Czech-born pianist Wojciech \u017bywny. His elder sister Ludwika also took lessons from \u017bywny, and occasionally played duets with her brother. It quickly became apparent that he was a child prodigy. By the age of seven he had begun giving public concerts, and in 1817, he composed two polonaises, in G minor and B\u266d major. His next work, a polonaise in A\u266d major of 1821, dedicated to \u017bywny, is his earliest surviving musical manuscript.\nIn 1817, the Saxon Palace was requisitioned by Warsaw's Russian governor for military use, and the Warsaw Lyceum was reestablished in the Kazimierz Palace (today the rectorate of Warsaw University). Chopin and his family moved to a building, which still survives, adjacent to the Kazimierz Palace. During this period, he was sometimes invited to the Belweder Palace as playmate to the son of the ruler of Russian Poland, Grand Duke Konstantin Pavlovich of Russia; he played the piano for Konstantin Pavlovich and composed a march for him. Julian Ursyn Niemcewicz, in his dramatic eclogue, \"\" (\"Our Discourses\", 1818), attested to \"little Chopin's\" popularity.\nEducation.\nFrom September 1823 to 1826, Chopin attended the Warsaw Lyceum, where he received organ lessons from the Czech musician Wilhelm W\u00fcrfel during his first year. In the autumn of 1826 he began a three-year course under the Silesian composer J\u00f3zef Elsner at the Warsaw Conservatory, studying music theory, figured bass, and composition. Throughout this period he continued to compose and to give recitals in concerts and salons in Warsaw. He was engaged by the inventors of the \"aeolomelodicon\" (a combination of piano and mechanical organ), and on this instrument in May 1825 he performed his own improvisation and part of a concerto by Moscheles. The success of this concert led to an invitation to give a recital on a similar instrument (the \"aeolopantaleon\") before Tsar Alexander I, who was visiting Warsaw; the Tsar presented him with a diamond ring. At a subsequent aeolopantaleon concert on 10 June 1825, Chopin performed his Rondo Op. 1. This was the first of his works to be commercially published and earned him his first mention in the foreign press, when the Leipzig praised his \"wealth of musical ideas\".\nFrom 1824 until 1828, Chopin spent his vacations away from Warsaw, at a number of locations. In 1824 and 1825, at Szafarnia, he was a guest of Dominik Dziewanowski, the father of a schoolmate. Here, for the first time, he encountered Polish rural folk music. His letters home from Szafarnia (to which he gave the title \"The Szafarnia Courier\"), written in a very modern and lively Polish, amused his family with their spoofing of the Warsaw newspapers and demonstrated the youngster's literary gift.\nIn 1827, soon after the death of Chopin's youngest sister Emilia, the family moved from the Warsaw University building, adjacent to the Kazimierz Palace, to lodgings just across the street from the university, in the south annex of the Krasi\u0144ski Palace (aka \"Czapski Palace\") on Krakowskie Przedmie\u015bcie, where Chopin lived until he left Warsaw in 1830. Here his parents continued running their boarding house for male students. Four boarders at his parents' apartments became Chopin's intimates: Tytus Woyciechowski, Jan Nepomucen Bia\u0142ob\u0142ocki, Jan Matuszy\u0144ski, and Julian Fontana. The latter two would become part of his Paris milieu.\nChopin was friendly with members of Warsaw's young artistic and intellectual world, including Fontana, J\u00f3zef Bohdan Zaleski, and Stefan Witwicki. Chopin's final Conservatory report (July 1829) read: \"Chopin F., third-year student, exceptional talent, musical genius.\" In 1829, Ambro\u017cy Mieroszewski executed a set of portraits of Chopin family members, including the first known portrait of the composer.\nLetters from Chopin to Woyciechowski in the period 1829\u201330 (when Chopin was about twenty) contain apparent homoerotic references to dreams and to offered kisses.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;I am going to wash now; don't kiss me, I'm not washed yet. You? If I were smeared with the oils of Byzantium, you would not kiss me unless I forced you to it by magnetism. There's some kind of power in nature. Today you will dream of kissing me! I have got to pay you out for the horrible dream you gave me last night.\u2014\u200a\nAccording to Adam Zamoyski, such expressions \"were, and to some extent still are, common currency in Polish and carry no greater implication than the 'love'\" concluding letters today. \"The spirit of the times, pervaded by the Romantic movement in art and literature, favoured extreme expression of feeling\u00a0... Whilst the possibility cannot be ruled out entirely, it is unlikely that the two were ever lovers.\" \nChopin's biographer Alan Walker considers that, insofar as such expressions could be perceived as homosexual in nature, they would not denote more than a passing phase in Chopin's life, or be the result\u00a0\u2013 in Walker's words\u00a0\u2013 of a \"mental twist\". The musicologist Jeffrey Kallberg notes that concepts of sexual practice and identity were very different in Chopin's time, so modern interpretation is problematic. Other scholars argue that these are clear, or potential, demonstrations of homosexual impulses on Chopin's part.\nProbably in early 1829, Chopin met the singer Konstancja G\u0142adkowska and developed an intense affection for her, although it is not clear that he ever addressed her directly on the matter. In a letter to Woyciechowski of 3 October 1829 he refers to his \"ideal, whom I have served faithfully for six months, though without ever saying a word to her about my feelings; whom I dream of, who inspired the Adagio of my Concerto\". All of Chopin's biographers, following the lead of Frederick Niecks, agree that this \"ideal\" was G\u0142adkowska. After what would be Chopin's farewell concert in Warsaw in October 1830, which included the concerto, played by the composer, and G\u0142adkowska singing an aria by Gioachino Rossini, the two exchanged rings, and two weeks later she wrote in his album some affectionate lines bidding him farewell. After Chopin left Warsaw, he and G\u0142adkowska did not meet and apparently did not correspond.\nCareer.\nTravel and domestic success.\nIn September 1828, Chopin, while still a student, visited Berlin with a family friend, zoologist Feliks Jarocki, enjoying operas directed by Gaspare Spontini and attending concerts by Carl Friedrich Zelter, Felix Mendelssohn, and other celebrities. On an 1829 return trip to Berlin, he was a guest of Prince Antoni Radziwi\u0142\u0142, governor of the Grand Duchy of Posen\u00a0\u2013 himself an accomplished composer and aspiring cellist. For the prince and his pianist daughter Wanda, he composed his Introduction and Polonaise brillante in C major for cello and piano, Op.\u00a03.\nBack in Warsaw that year, Chopin heard Niccol\u00f2 Paganini play the violin, and composed a set of variations, . It may have been this experience that encouraged him to commence writing his first \u00c9tudes (1829\u20131832), exploring the capacities of his own instrument. After completing his studies at the Warsaw Conservatory, he made his debut in Vienna. He gave two piano concerts and received many favourable reviews\u00a0\u2013 in addition to some commenting (in Chopin's own words) that he was \"too delicate for those accustomed to the piano-bashing of local artists\". In the first of these concerts, he premiered his Variations on, Op.\u00a02 (variations on a duet from Mozart's opera \"Don Giovanni\") for piano and orchestra. He returned to Warsaw in September 1829, where he premiered his Piano Concerto No. 2 in F minor, Op.\u00a021 on 17 March 1830.\nChopin's successes as a composer and performer opened the door to western Europe for him, and on 2 November 1830, he set out, in the words of Zdzis\u0142aw Jachimecki, \"into the wide world, with no very clearly defined aim, forever\". With Woyciechowski, he headed for Austria again, intending to go on to Italy. Later that month, in Warsaw, the November 1830 Uprising broke out, and Woyciechowski returned to Poland to enlist. Chopin, now alone in Vienna, was nostalgic for his homeland, and wrote to a friend, \"I curse the moment of my departure.\" When in September 1831 he learned, while travelling from Vienna to Paris, that the uprising had been crushed, he expressed his anguish in the pages of his private journal: \"Oh God!\u00a0... You are there, and yet you do not take vengeance!\". The journal is now in the National Library of Poland. Jachimecki ascribes to these events the composer's maturing \"into an inspired national bard who intuited the past, present and future of his native Poland\".\nParis.\nWhen he left Warsaw on 2 November 1830, Chopin had intended to go to Italy, but violent unrest there made that a dangerous destination. His next choice was Paris; difficulties obtaining a visa from Russian authorities resulted in him obtaining transit permission from the French. In later years he would quote the passport's endorsement (\"In transit to London via Paris\"), joking that he was in the city \"only in passing\". Chopin arrived in Paris on 5 October 1831; he would never return to Poland, thus becoming one of many expatriates of the Polish Great Emigration. In France, he used the French versions of his given names, and after receiving French citizenship in 1835, he travelled on a French passport. Chopin remained close to his fellow Poles in exile as friends and confidants. He never felt fully comfortable speaking French or considered himself to be French, despite his father's French origins. According to Adam Zamoyski, he always saw himself as a Pole.\nIn Paris, Chopin encountered artists and other distinguished figures and found many opportunities to exercise his talents and achieve celebrity. During his years in Paris, he was to become acquainted with, among many others, Hector Berlioz, Franz Liszt, Ferdinand Hiller, Heinrich Heine, Eug\u00e8ne Delacroix, Alfred de Vigny, and Friedrich Kalkbrenner, who introduced him to the piano manufacturer Camille Pleyel. This was the beginning of a long and close association between the composer and Pleyel's instruments. Chopin was also acquainted with the poet Adam Mickiewicz, principal of the Polish Literary Society, some of whose verses he set as songs. He also was more than once guest of Marquis Astolphe de Custine, one of his fervent admirers, playing his works in Custine's salon.\nTwo Polish friends in Paris were also to play important roles in Chopin's life there. A fellow student at the Warsaw Conservatory, Julian Fontana, had originally tried unsuccessfully to establish himself in England; Fontana was to become, in the words of the music historian Jim Samson, Chopin's \"general factotum and copyist\". Albert Grzyma\u0142a, who in Paris became a wealthy financier and society figure, often acted as Chopin's adviser and, in Zamoyski's words, \"gradually began to fill the role of elder brother in [his] life\".\nOn 7 December 1831, Chopin received the first major endorsement from an outstanding contemporary when Robert Schumann, reviewing the Op. 2 Variations in the (his first published article on music), declared: \"Hats off, gentlemen! A genius.\" On 25 February 1832 Chopin gave a debut Paris concert in the at 9 rue Cadet, which drew universal admiration. The critic Fran\u00e7ois-Joseph F\u00e9tis wrote in the : \"Here is a young man who\u00a0... taking no model, has found, if not a complete renewal of piano music,\u00a0... an abundance of original ideas of a kind to be found nowhere else\u00a0...\" After this concert, Chopin realised that his essentially intimate keyboard technique was not optimal for large concert spaces. Later that year he was introduced to the wealthy Rothschild banking family, whose patronage also opened doors for him to other private salons (social gatherings of the aristocracy and artistic and literary elite). By the end of 1832 Chopin had established himself among the Parisian musical elite and had earned the respect of his peers such as Hiller, Liszt, and Berlioz. He no longer depended financially upon his father, and in the winter of 1832, he began earning a handsome income from publishing his works and teaching piano to affluent students from all over Europe. This freed him from the strains of public concert-giving, which he disliked.\nChopin seldom performed publicly in Paris. In later years he generally gave a single annual concert at the Salle Pleyel, a venue that seated three hundred. He played more frequently at salons but preferred playing at his own Paris apartment for small groups of friends. The musicologist Arthur Hedley has observed that \"As a pianist Chopin was unique in acquiring a reputation of the highest order on the basis of a minimum of public appearances\u00a0\u2013 few more than thirty in the course of his lifetime.\" The list of musicians who took part in some of his concerts indicates the richness of Parisian artistic life during this period. Examples include a concert on 23 March 1833, in which Chopin, Liszt, and Hiller performed (on pianos) a concerto by J. S. Bach for three keyboards; and, on 3 March 1838, a concert in which Chopin, his pupil Adolphe Gutmann, Charles-Valentin Alkan, and Alkan's teacher Joseph Zimmermann performed Alkan's arrangement, for eight hands, of two movements from Beethoven's 7th symphony. Chopin was also involved in the composition of Liszt's \"Hexameron\"; he wrote the sixth (and final) variation on Bellini's theme. Chopin's music soon found success with publishers, and in 1833, he contracted with Maurice Schlesinger, who arranged for it to be published not only in France but, through his family connections, also in Germany and England.\nIn the spring of 1834, Chopin attended the Lower Rhenish Music Festival in Aix-la-Chapelle with Hiller, and it was there that Chopin met Felix Mendelssohn. After the festival, the three visited D\u00fcsseldorf, where Mendelssohn had been appointed musical director. They spent what Mendelssohn described as \"a very agreeable day\", playing and discussing music at his piano, and met Friedrich Wilhelm Schadow, director of the Academy of Art, and some of his eminent pupils such as Lessing, Bendemann, Hildebrandt and Sohn. In 1835, Chopin went to Carlsbad, where he spent time with his parents; it was the last time he would see them. On his way back to Paris, he met old friends from Warsaw, the Wodzi\u0144skis, their sons, and their daughters, amongst which Maria, whom he occasionally had given piano lessons in Poland. This meeting prompted him to stay for two weeks in Dresden, when he had previously intended to return to Paris via Leipzig. The sixteen-year-old girl's portrait of the composer has been considered, along with Delacroix's, as among the best likenesses of Chopin.\nIn October he finally reached Leipzig, where he met Schumann, Clara Wieck, and Mendelssohn, who organised for him a performance of his own oratorio \"St. Paul\", and who considered him \"a perfect musician\". In July 1836 Chopin travelled to Marienbad and Dresden to be with the Wodzi\u0144ski family, and in September he proposed to Maria, whose mother Countess Wodzi\u0144ska approved in principle. Chopin went on to Leipzig, where he presented Schumann with his G minor Ballade. At the end of 1836, he sent Maria an album in which his sister Ludwika had inscribed seven of his songs, and his 1830 Nocturne in C\u266f minor, \"Lento con gran espresisione\". The anodyne thanks he received from Maria proved to be the last letter he was to have from her. Chopin placed the letters he had received from Maria and her mother into a large envelope, wrote on it the words \"My sorrow\" (), and to the end of his life retained in a desk drawer this keepsake of the second love of his life.\nFranz Liszt.\nAlthough it is not known exactly when Chopin first met Franz Liszt after arriving in Paris, on 12 December 1831, he mentioned in a letter to his friend Woyciechowski that \"I have met Rossini, Cherubini, Baillot, etc.\u00a0\u2013 also Kalkbrenner. You would not believe how curious I was about Herz, Liszt, Hiller, etc.\" Liszt was in attendance at Chopin's Parisian debut on 26 February 1832 at the Salle Pleyel, which led him to remark: \"The most vigorous applause seemed not to suffice to our enthusiasm in the presence of this talented musician, who revealed a new phase of poetic sentiment combined with such happy innovation in the form of his art.\"\nThe two became friends, and for many years lived close to each other in Paris, Chopin at 38 , and Liszt at the on the , a few blocks away. They performed together on seven occasions between 1833 and 1841. The first, on 2 April 1833, was at a benefit concert organised by Hector Berlioz for his bankrupt Shakespearean actress wife Harriet Smithson, during which they played George Onslow's \"Sonata in F minor\" for piano duet. Later joint appearances included a benefit concert for the Benevolent Association of Polish Ladies in Paris. Their last appearance together in public was for a charity concert conducted for the Beethoven Monument in Bonn, held at the Salle Pleyel and the Paris Conservatory on 25 and 26 April 1841.\nAlthough the two displayed great respect and admiration for each other, their friendship was uneasy and had some qualities of a love\u2013hate relationship. Harold C. Schonberg believes that Chopin displayed a \"tinge of jealousy and spite\" towards Liszt's virtuosity on the piano, and others have also argued that he had become enchanted with Liszt's theatricality, showmanship, and success. Liszt was the dedicatee of Chopin's Op. 10 , and his performance of them prompted the composer to write to Hiller, \"I should like to rob him of the way he plays my studies.\" However, Chopin expressed annoyance in 1843 when Liszt performed one of his nocturnes with the addition of numerous intricate embellishments, at which Chopin remarked that he should play the music as written or not play it at all, forcing an apology. Most biographers of Chopin state that after this the two had little to do with each other, although in his letters dated as late as 1848 he still referred to him as \"my friend Liszt\". Some commentators point to events in the two men's romantic lives which led to a rift between them; there are claims that Liszt had displayed jealousy of his mistress Marie d'Agoult's obsession with Chopin, while others believe that Chopin had become concerned about Liszt's growing relationship with George Sand.\nGeorge Sand.\nIn 1836, at a party hosted by Marie d'Agoult, Chopin met the French author George Sand (born [Amantine] Aurore [Lucile] Dupin). Short (under five feet, or 152\u00a0cm), dark, big-eyed and a cigar smoker, she initially repelled Chopin, who remarked, \"What an unattractive person \"la Sand\" is. Is she really a woman?\" However, by early 1837 Maria Wodzi\u0144ska's mother had made it clear to Chopin in correspondence that a marriage with her daughter was unlikely to proceed. It is thought that she was influenced by his poor health and possibly also by rumours about his associations with women such as d'Agoult and Sand. Chopin finally placed the letters from Maria and her mother in a package on which he wrote, in Polish, \"My Sorrow\". Sand, in a letter to Grzyma\u0142a of June 1838, admitted strong feelings for the composer and debated whether to abandon a current affair to begin a relationship with Chopin; she asked Grzyma\u0142a to assess Chopin's relationship with Maria Wodzi\u0144ska, without realising that the affair, at least from Maria's side, was over.\nIn June 1837, Chopin visited London incognito in the company of the piano manufacturer Camille Pleyel, where he played at a musical soir\u00e9e at the house of English piano maker James Broadwood. On his return to Paris his association with Sand began in earnest, and by July 1838 they had become lovers. Sand, who was six years older than the composer and had had a series of lovers, wrote at this time: \"I must say I was confused and amazed at the effect this little creature had on me\u00a0... I have still not recovered from my astonishment, and if I were a proud person I should be feeling humiliated at having been carried away\u00a0...\" The two spent a miserable winter on Mallorca (8 November 1838 to 13 February 1839), where, together with Sand's two children, they had journeyed in the hope of improving Chopin's health and that of Sand's 15-year-old son Maurice, and also to escape the threats of Sand's former lover F\u00e9licien Mallefille. After discovering that the couple were not married, the deeply traditional Catholic people of Mallorca became inhospitable, making accommodation difficult to find. This compelled the group to take lodgings in a former Carthusian monastery in Valldemossa, which gave little shelter from the cold winter weather.\nOn 3 December 1838, Chopin complained about his bad health and the incompetence of the doctors in Mallorca, commenting: \"The three most celebrated doctors on the island have seen me\u00a0... The first said I was dead, the second that I am dying, and the third that I'm going to die.\" He also had problems having his Pleyel piano sent to him, having to rely in the meantime on a piano made in Palma by Juan Bauza. The Pleyel piano finally arrived from Paris in December, just shortly before Chopin and Sand left the island. Chopin wrote to Pleyel in January 1839: \"I am sending you my Preludes [Op. 28]. I finished them on your little piano, which arrived in the best possible condition in spite of the sea, the bad weather and the Palma customs.\" Chopin was also able to undertake work while in Mallorca on his Ballade No. 2, Op. 38; on two Polonaises, Op. 40; and on the Scherzo No. 3, Op. 39.\nAlthough this period had been productive, the bad weather had such a detrimental effect on Chopin's health that Sand determined to leave the island. To avoid further customs duties, Sand sold the piano to a local French couple, the Canuts. The group travelled first to Barcelona, then to Marseille, where they stayed for a few months while Chopin convalesced. While in Marseille, Chopin made a rare appearance at the organ during a requiem mass for the tenor Adolphe Nourrit on 24 April 1839, playing a transcription of Franz Schubert's (D. 939). George Sand gives a description of Chopin's playing in a letter of 28 April 1839:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Chopin sacrificed himself by playing the organ at the Elevation \u2013 and what an organ! Anyhow our boy made the best of it by using the less discordant stops, and he played Schubert's , not with a passionate and glowing tone that Nourrit used, but with a plaintive sound as soft as an echo from another world. Two or three at most among those present felt its meaning and had tears in their eyes.\nIn May 1839, they headed to Sand's estate at Nohant for the summer, where they spent most of the following summers until 1846. In autumn they returned to Paris, where Chopin's apartment at 5 rue Tronchet was close to Sand's rented accommodation on the rue Pigalle. He frequently visited Sand in the evenings, but both retained some independence. (In 1842, he and Sand moved to the Square d'Orl\u00e9ans, living in adjacent buildings.)\nOn 26 July 1840, Chopin and Sand were present at the dress rehearsal of Berlioz's , composed to commemorate the tenth anniversary of the July Revolution. Chopin was reportedly unimpressed with the composition. \nDuring the summers at Nohant, particularly in the years 1839\u20131843 (except 1840), Chopin found quiet, productive days during which he composed many works, including his Polonaise in A\u266d major, Op. 53. Sand compellingly describes Chopin's creative process: an inspiration, its painstaking elaboration \u2013 sometimes amid tormented weeping and complaining, with hundreds of changes in concept \u2013 only to return finally to the initial idea.\nAmong the visitors to Nohant were Delacroix and the mezzo-soprano Pauline Viardot, whom Chopin had advised on piano technique and composition. Delacroix gives an account of staying at Nohant in a letter of 7 June 1842:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The hosts could not be more pleasant in entertaining me. When we are not all together at dinner, lunch, playing billiards, or walking, each of us stays in his room, reading or lounging around on a couch. Sometimes, through the window which opens on the garden, a gust of music wafts up from Chopin at work. All this mingles with the songs of nightingales and the fragrance of roses.\nDecline.\nFrom 1842 onwards, Chopin showed signs of serious illness. After a solo recital in Paris on 21 February 1842, he wrote to Grzyma\u0142a: \"I have to lie in bed all day long, my mouth and tonsils are aching so much.\" He was forced by illness to decline a written invitation from Alkan to participate in a repeat performance of the Beethoven 7th Symphony arrangement at \u00c9rard's on 1 March 1843. Late in 1844, Charles Hall\u00e9 visited Chopin and found him \"hardly able to move, bent like a half-opened penknife and evidently in great pain\", although his spirits returned when he started to play the piano for his visitor. Chopin's health continued to deteriorate, particularly from this time onwards. Modern research suggests that apart from any other illnesses, he may also have suffered from temporal lobe epilepsy.\nChopin's output as a composer throughout this period declined in quantity year by year. Whereas in 1841 he had written a dozen works, only six were written in 1842 and six shorter pieces in 1843. In 1844 he wrote only the Op. 58 sonata. 1845 saw the completion of three mazurkas (Op. 59). Although these works were more refined than many of his earlier compositions, Zamoyski concludes that \"his powers of concentration were failing and his inspiration was beset by anguish, both emotional and intellectual\". Chopin's relations with Sand were soured in 1846 by problems involving her daughter Solange and Solange's fianc\u00e9, the young fortune-hunting sculptor Auguste Cl\u00e9singer. The composer frequently took Solange's side in quarrels with her mother; he also faced jealousy from Sand's son Maurice. Moreover, Chopin was indifferent to Sand's radical political pursuits, including her enthusiasm for the February Revolution of 1848.\nAs the composer's illness progressed, Sand had become less of a lover and more of a nurse to Chopin, whom she called her \"third child\". In letters to third parties she vented her impatience, referring to him as a \"child\", a \"poor angel\", a \"sufferer\", and a \"beloved little corpse\". In 1847, Sand published her novel \"Lucrezia Floriani\", whose main characters\u00a0\u2013 a rich actress and a prince in weak health\u00a0\u2013 could be interpreted as Sand and Chopin. In Chopin's presence, Sand read the manuscript aloud to Delacroix, who was both shocked and mystified by its implications, writing that \"Madame Sand was perfectly at ease and Chopin could hardly stop making admiring comments\". That year their relationship ended following an angry correspondence which, in Sand's words, made \"a strange conclusion to nine years of exclusive friendship\". Grzyma\u0142a, who had followed their romance from the beginning, commented, \"If [Chopin] had not had the misfortune of meeting G. S. [George Sand], who poisoned his whole being, he would have lived to be Cherubini's age.\" Chopin would die two years later at thirty-nine; the composer Luigi Cherubini had died in Paris in 1842 at the age of 81.\nTour of Great Britain.\nChopin's public popularity as a virtuoso began to wane, as did the number of his pupils, and this, together with the political strife and instability of the time, caused him to struggle financially. In February 1848, with the cellist Auguste Franchomme, he gave his last Paris concert, which included three movements of the Cello Sonata Op. 65.\nIn April, during the 1848 Revolution in Paris, he left for London, where he performed at several concerts and numerous receptions in great houses. This tour was suggested to him by his Scottish pupil Jane Stirling and her elder sister. Stirling also made all the logistical arrangements and provided much of the necessary funding.\nIn London, Chopin took lodgings at Dover Street, where the firm of Broadwood provided him with a grand piano. At his first engagement, on 15 May at Stafford House, the audience included Queen Victoria and Prince Albert. The Prince, who was himself a talented musician, moved close to the keyboard to view Chopin's technique. Broadwood also arranged concerts for him; among those attending were the author William Makepeace Thackeray and the singer Jenny Lind. Chopin was also sought after for piano lessons, for which he charged the high fee of one guinea per hour, and for private recitals for which the fee was 20 guineas. At a concert on 7 July he shared the platform with Viardot, who sang arrangements of some of his mazurkas to Spanish texts. A few days later, he performed for Thomas Carlyle and his wife Jane at their home in Chelsea. On 28 August he played at a concert in Manchester's Gentlemen's Concert Hall, sharing the stage with Marietta Alboni and Lorenzo Salvi.\nIn late summer he was invited by Jane Stirling to visit Scotland, where he stayed at Calder House near Edinburgh and at Johnstone Castle in Renfrewshire, both owned by members of Stirling's family. She clearly had a notion of going beyond mere friendship, and Chopin was obliged to make it clear to her that this could not be so. He wrote at this time to Grzyma\u0142a: \"My Scottish ladies are kind, but such bores\", and responding to a rumour about his involvement, answered that he was \"closer to the grave than the nuptial bed\". He gave a public concert in Glasgow on 27 September, and another in Edinburgh at the Hopetoun Rooms on Queen Street (now Erskine House) on 4 October. In late October 1848, while staying at 10 Warriston Crescent in Edinburgh with the Polish physician Adam \u0141yszczy\u0144ski, he wrote out his last will and testament\u00a0\u2013 \"a kind of disposition to be made of my stuff in the future, if I should drop dead somewhere\", he wrote to Grzyma\u0142a.\nChopin made his last public appearance on a concert platform at London's Guildhall on 16 November 1848, when, in a final patriotic gesture, he played for the benefit of Polish refugees. This gesture proved to be a mistake, as most of the participants were more interested in the dancing and refreshments than in Chopin's piano artistry, which drained him. By this time he was very seriously ill, weighing under 45\u00a0kg (99 lb), and his doctors were aware that his sickness was at a terminal stage.\nAt the end of November Chopin returned to Paris. He passed the winter in unremitting illness, but gave occasional lessons and was visited by friends, including Delacroix and Franchomme. Occasionally he played, or accompanied the singing of Delfina Potocka, for his friends. During the summer of 1849, his friends found him an apartment in Chaillot, out of the centre of the city, for which the rent was secretly subsidised by an admirer, Princess Yekaterina Dmitrievna Soutzos-Obreskova. He was visited here by Jenny Lind in June 1849.\nDeath and funeral.\nWith his health further deteriorating, Chopin desired to have a family member with him. In June 1849 his sister Ludwika came to Paris with her husband and daughter, and in September, he took an apartment at the H\u00f4tel Baudard de Saint-James on the Place Vend\u00f4me, with rent possibly supported by Jane Stirling. After 15 October, when his condition took a marked turn for the worse, only a handful of his closest friends remained with him. Viardot remarked sardonically, though, that \"all the grand Parisian ladies considered it to faint in his room\".\nSome of his friends provided music at his request; among them, Potocka sang and Franchomme played the cello. Chopin bequeathed his unfinished notes on a piano tuition method, , to Alkan for completion. On 17 October, after midnight, the physician leaned over him and asked whether he was suffering greatly. \"No longer\", he replied. He died a few minutes before 2 a.m. He was 39. Those present at the deathbed appear to have included his sister Ludwika, Fr. Aleksander Je\u0142owicki, Princess Marcelina Czartoryska, Sand's daughter Solange, and his close friend Thomas Albrecht. Later that morning, Solange's husband Cl\u00e9singer made Chopin's death mask and a cast of his left hand.\nThe funeral, held at the Church of the Madeleine in Paris, was delayed almost two weeks until 30 October. Entrance was restricted to ticket holders, as many people were expected to attend. Over 3,000 people arrived without invitations, from as far as London, Berlin and Vienna, and were excluded.\nMozart's Requiem was sung at the funeral; the soloists were Jeanne-Ana\u00efs Castellan, Viardot, Alexis Dupont, and Luigi Lablache; Chopin's Preludes No.\u00a04 in E minor and No.\u00a06 in B minor were played by organist Alfred Lef\u00e9bure-W\u00e9ly. The funeral procession to P\u00e8re Lachaise Cemetery, which included Chopin's sister Ludwika, was led by the aged Prince Adam Czartoryski. The pallbearers included Delacroix, Franchomme, and Camille Pleyel. At the graveside, the \"Funeral March\" from Chopin's Piano Sonata No. 2 was played, in Reber's instrumentation.\nChopin's tombstone, featuring the muse of music, Euterpe, weeping over a broken lyre, was designed and sculpted by Cl\u00e9singer and installed on the anniversary of his death in 1850. The expenses of the monument, amounting to 4,500 francs, were covered by Jane Stirling, who also paid for the return of the composer's sister Ludwika to Warsaw. As requested by Chopin, Ludwika took his heart (which had been removed by his doctor Jean Cruveilhier and preserved in alcohol in a vase) back to Poland in 1850. She also took a collection of 200 letters from Sand to Chopin; after 1851 these were returned to Sand, who destroyed them.\nChopin's disease and the cause of his death have been topics of debate. His death certificate gave the cause as tuberculosis, and his physician, Cruveilhier, was then the leading French authority on this disease. Other possibilities advanced have included cystic fibrosis, cirrhosis, and alpha 1-antitrypsin deficiency. A visual examination of Chopin's preserved heart (the jar was not opened), conducted in 2014 and first published in the \"American Journal of Medicine\" in 2017, suggested that the likely cause of his death was a rare case of pericarditis caused by complications of chronic tuberculosis.\nMusic.\nOverview.\nOver 230 works of Chopin survive; some compositions from early childhood have been lost. All his known works involve the piano, and only a few range beyond solo piano music, as either piano concertos, songs or chamber music.\nChopin was educated in the tradition of Beethoven, Haydn, Mozart, and Clementi; he used Clementi's piano method with his students. He was also influenced by Hummel's development of virtuoso, yet Mozartian, piano technique. He cited Bach and Mozart as the two most important composers in shaping his musical outlook. Chopin's early works are in the style of the \"brilliant\" keyboard pieces of his era as exemplified by the works of Ignaz Moscheles, Friedrich Kalkbrenner, and others. Less direct in the earlier period are the influences of Polish folk music and of Italian opera. Much of what became his typical style of ornamentation (for example, his \"fioriture\") is taken from singing. His melodic lines were increasingly reminiscent of the modes and features of the music of his native country, such as drones.\nChopin took the new salon genre of the nocturne, invented by the Irish composer John Field, to a deeper level of sophistication. He was the first to write ballades and scherzi as individual concert pieces. He essentially established a new genre with his own set of free-standing preludes (Op.\u00a028, published 1839). He exploited the poetic potential of the concept of the concert \u00e9tude, already being developed in the 1820s and 1830s by Liszt, Clementi, and Moscheles, in his two sets of studies (Op.\u00a010 published in 1833, Op.\u00a025 in 1837).\nChopin also endowed popular dance forms with a greater range of melody and expression. Chopin's mazurkas, while originating in the traditional Polish dance (the \"mazurek\"), differed from the traditional variety in that they were written for the concert hall rather than the dance hall; as J. Barrie Jones puts it, \"it was Chopin who put the mazurka on the European musical map\". The series of seven polonaises published in his lifetime (another nine were published posthumously), beginning with the Op.\u00a026 pair (published 1836), set a new standard for music in the form. His waltzes were also written specifically for the salon recital rather than the ballroom and are frequently at rather faster tempos than their dance-floor equivalents.\nTitles, opus numbers and editions.\nSome of Chopin's well-known pieces have acquired descriptive titles, such as the \"Revolutionary\" \u00c9tude (Op.\u00a010,\u00a0No.\u00a012), and the \"Minute Waltz\" (Op.\u00a064,\u00a0No.\u00a01). However, except for his \"Funeral March\", the composer never named an instrumental work beyond genre and number, leaving all potential extramusical associations to the listener; the names by which many of his pieces are known were invented by others. There is no evidence to suggest that the \"Revolutionary\" \u00c9tude was written with the failed Polish uprising against Russia in mind; it merely appeared at that time. The \"Funeral March\", the third movement of his Sonata No. 2 (Op.\u00a035), the one case where he did give a title, was written before the rest of the sonata, but no specific event or death is known to have inspired it.\nThe last opus number that Chopin himself used was 65, allocated to the Cello Sonata in G minor. He expressed a deathbed wish that all his unpublished manuscripts be destroyed. At the request of the composer's mother and sisters, however, his musical executor Julian Fontana selected 23 unpublished piano pieces and grouped them into eight further opus numbers (Opp. 66\u201373), published in 1855. In 1857, 17 Polish songs that Chopin wrote at various stages of his life were collected and published as Op. 74, though their order within the opus did not reflect the order of composition.\nWorks published since 1857 have received alternative catalogue designations instead of opus numbers. The most up-to-date catalogue is maintained by the Fryderyk Chopin Institute at its Internet Chopin Information Centre. The older Kobyla\u0144ska Catalogue (usually represented by the initials 'KK'), named for its compiler, the Polish musicologist Krystyna Kobyla\u0144ska, is still considered an important scholarly reference. The most recent catalogue of posthumously published works is that of the National Edition of the Works of Fryderyk Chopin, represented by the initials 'WN'.\nChopin's original publishers included Maurice Schlesinger and Camille Pleyel. His works soon began to appear in popular 19th-century piano anthologies. The first collected edition was by Breitkopf &amp; H\u00e4rtel (1878\u20131902). Among modern scholarly editions of Chopin's works is the version named after Paderewski (although he died before the work had begun), published between 1949 and 1961. However, scholarly opinion has moved against this edition. The more recent Polish National Edition, edited by Jan Ekier and published between 1967 and 2010, is recommended to contestants of the Chopin Competition. Both editions contain detailed explanations and discussions regarding choices and sources.\nChopin published his music in France, England, and the German states (i.e. he worked with as many as three separate publishers for each piece or set of pieces) due to the copyright laws of the time. Thus there are often three different \"first editions\" of each work. Each edition is different from the others; Chopin edited them separately, and at times he did some revision to the music while editing it. Furthermore, Chopin provided his publishers with varying sources, including autographs, annotated proofsheets, and scribal copies. Only recently have these differences gained greater recognition.\nForm and harmony.\nImprovisation stands at the centre of Chopin's creative processes. However, this does not imply impulsive rambling: Nicholas Temperley writes that \"improvisation is designed for an audience, and its starting-point is that audience's expectations, which include the current conventions of musical form\". The works for piano and orchestra, including the two concertos, are held by Temperley to be \"merely vehicles for brilliant piano playing\u00a0... formally longwinded and extremely conservative\". After the piano concertos (which are both early, dating from 1830), Chopin made no attempts at large-scale multi-movement forms, save for his late sonatas for piano and cello; \"instead he achieved near-perfection in pieces of simple general design but subtle and complex cell-structure\". Rosen suggests that an important aspect of Chopin's individuality is his flexible handling of the four-bar phrase as a structural unit.\nJ. Barrie Jones suggests that \"amongst the works that Chopin intended for concert use, the four ballades and four scherzi stand supreme\", and adds that \"the Barcarolle Op.\u00a060 stands apart as an example of Chopin's rich harmonic palette coupled with an Italianate warmth of melody\". Temperley opines that these works, which contain \"immense variety of mood, thematic material and structural detail\", are based on an extended \"departure and return\" form; \"the more the middle section is extended, and the further it departs in key, mood and theme, from the opening idea, the more important and dramatic is the reprise when it at last comes\".\nChopin's mazurkas and waltzes are all in straightforward ternary or episodic form, sometimes with a coda. The mazurkas often show more folk features than many of his other works, sometimes including modal scales and harmonies and the use of drone basses. However, some also show unusual sophistication, for example, Op.\u00a063 No.\u00a03, which includes a canon at one beat's distance, a great rarity in music.\nChopin's polonaises show a marked advance on those of his Polish predecessors in the form (who included his teachers \u017bywny and Elsner). As with the traditional polonaise, Chopin's works are in triple time and typically display a martial rhythm in their melodies, accompaniments, and cadences. Unlike most of their precursors, they also require a formidable playing technique.\nHis nocturnes are more structured, and of greater emotional depth, than those of Field, whom Chopin met in 1832. Many of the Chopin nocturnes have middle sections marked by agitated expression (and often making very difficult demands on the performer), which heightens their dramatic character.\nChopin's \u00e9tudes are largely in straightforward ternary form. He used them to teach his own technique of piano playing\u00a0\u2013 for instance playing double thirds (Op.\u00a025, No.\u00a06), playing in octaves (Op.\u00a025, No.\u00a010), and playing repeated notes (Op.\u00a010, No.\u00a0 7).\nThe preludes, many of which are very brief, were described by Schumann as \"the beginnings of studies\". Inspired by J. S. Bach's \"The Well-Tempered Clavier\", Chopin's preludes move up the circle of fifths (rather than Bach's chromatic scale sequence) to create a prelude in each major and minor tonality. The preludes were perhaps not intended to be played as a group, and may even have been used by him and later pianists as generic preludes to others of his pieces, or even to music by other composers. This is suggested by Kenneth Hamilton, who has noted a 1922 recording by Ferruccio Busoni in which the Prelude Op.\u00a028 No.\u00a07 is followed by the \u00c9tude Op.\u00a010 No.\u00a05.\nThe two mature Chopin piano sonatas (No.\u00a02, Op.\u00a035, written in 1839 and No.\u00a03, Op.\u00a058, written in 1844) are in four movements. In Op.\u00a035, Chopin combined within a formal large musical structure many elements of his virtuosic piano technique\u00a0\u2013 \"a kind of dialogue between the public pianism of the brilliant style and the German sonata principle\". This sonata has been considered as showing the influences of both Bach and Beethoven. The Prelude from Bach's Suite No. 6 in D major for cello (BWV 1012) is quoted; and there are references to the Sonata Opus 26 by Beethoven, which, like Chopin's Op. 35, has a funeral march as its slow movement. The last movement of Chopin's Op. 35, a brief (75-bar) perpetuum mobile in which the hands play in unmodified octave unison throughout, was found shocking and unmusical by contemporaries, including Schumann. The Op.\u00a058 sonata is closer to the German tradition, including many passages of complex counterpoint, \"worthy of Brahms\" according to Samson.\nChopin's harmonic innovations may have arisen partly from his keyboard improvisation technique. In his works, Temperley says, \"novel harmonic effects often result from the combination of ordinary appoggiaturas or passing notes with melodic figures of accompaniment\", and cadences are delayed by the use of chords outside the home key (neapolitan sixths and diminished sevenths) or by sudden shifts to remote keys. Chord progressions sometimes anticipate the shifting tonality of later composers such as Claude Debussy, as does Chopin's use of modal harmony.\nTechnique and performance style.\nIn 1841, L\u00e9on Escudier wrote of a recital given by Chopin that year, \"One may say that Chopin is the creator of a school of piano and a school of composition. In truth, nothing equals the lightness, the sweetness with which the composer preludes on the piano; moreover nothing may be compared to his works full of originality, distinction and grace.\" Chopin refused to conform to a standard method of playing and believed that there was no set technique for playing well. His style was based extensively on his use of a very independent finger technique. In his he wrote: \"Everything is a matter of knowing good fingering\u00a0... we need no less to use the rest of the hand, the wrist, the forearm and the upper arm.\" He further stated: \"One needs only to study a certain position of the hand in relation to the keys to obtain with ease the most beautiful quality of sound, to know how to play short notes and long notes, and [to attain] unlimited dexterity.\" The consequences of this approach to technique in Chopin's music include the frequent use of the entire range of the keyboard, passages in double octaves and other chord groupings, swiftly repeated notes, the use of grace notes, and the use of contrasting rhythms (four against three, for example) between the hands.\nJonathan Bellman writes that modern concert performance style\u00a0\u2013 set in the \"conservatory\" tradition of late 19th- and 20th-century music schools, and suitable for large auditoria or recordings\u00a0\u2013 militates against what is known of Chopin's more intimate performance technique. The composer himself said to a pupil that \"concerts are never real music, you have to give up the idea of hearing in them all the most beautiful things of art\". Contemporary accounts indicate that in performance, Chopin avoided rigid procedures sometimes incorrectly attributed to him, such as \"always crescendo to a high note\", but that he was concerned with expressive phrasing, rhythmic consistency and sensitive colouring. Berlioz wrote in 1853 that Chopin \"has created a kind of chromatic embroidery\u00a0... whose effect is so strange and piquant as to be impossible to describe\u00a0... virtually nobody but Chopin himself can play this music and give it this unusual turn\". Hiller wrote that \"What in the hands of others was elegant embellishment, in his hands became a colourful wreath of flowers.\"\nChopin's music is frequently played with \"rubato\", \"the practice in performance of disregarding strict time, 'robbing' some note-values for expressive effect\". There are differing opinions as to how much, and what type, of \"rubato\" is appropriate for his works. Charles Rosen comments that \"most of the written-out indications of rubato in Chopin are to be found in his mazurkas\u00a0... It is probable that Chopin used the older form of rubato so important to Mozart\u00a0... [where] the melody note in the right hand is delayed until after the note in the bass\u00a0... An allied form of this rubato is the arpeggiation of the chords thereby delaying the melody note; according to Chopin's pupil Karol Mikuli, Chopin was firmly opposed to this practice.\"\nChopin's pupil Friederike M\u00fcller wrote:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;[His] playing was always noble and beautiful; his tones sang, whether in full \"forte\" or softest \"piano\". He took infinite pains to teach his pupils this \"legato\", \"cantabile\" style of playing. His most severe criticism was 'He\u00a0\u2013 or she\u00a0\u2013 does not know how to join two notes together.' He also demanded the strictest adherence to rhythm. He hated all lingering and dragging, misplaced \"rubatos\", as well as exaggerated \"ritardandos\"\u00a0[...] and it is precisely in this respect that people make such terrible errors in playing his works.\nInstruments.\nWhen living in Warsaw, Chopin composed and played on an instrument built by the piano-maker Fryderyk Buchholtz. Later in Paris Chopin purchased a piano from Pleyel. He rated Pleyel's pianos as \"non plus ultra\" (\"nothing better\"). Franz Liszt befriended Chopin in Paris and described the sound of Chopin's Pleyel as being \"the marriage of crystal and water\". While in London in 1848, Chopin mentioned his pianos in his letters: \"I have a large drawing-room with three pianos, a Pleyel, a Broadwood and an Erard.\"\nPolish identity.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\nThe \"Polish character\" of Chopin's work is unquestionable; not because he also wrote polonaises and mazurkas\u00a0... which forms\u00a0... were often stuffed with alien ideological and literary contents from the outside.\u00a0... As an artist he looked for forms that stood apart from the literary-dramatic character of music which was a feature of Romanticism, as a Pole he reflected in his work the very essence of the tragic break in the history of the people and instinctively aspired to give the deepest expression of his nation\u00a0... For he understood that he could invest his music with the most enduring and truly Polish qualities only by liberating art from the confines of dramatic and historical contents. This attitude toward the question of \"national music\"\u00a0\u2013 an inspired solution to his art\u00a0\u2013 was the reason why Chopin's works have come to be understood everywhere outside of Poland\u00a0... Therein lies the strange riddle of his eternal vigour.\nKarol Szymanowski, 1923\nWith his mazurkas and polonaises, Chopin has been credited with introducing to music a new sense of nationalism. Schumann, in his 1836 review of the piano concertos, highlighted the composer's strong feelings for his native Poland, writing:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Now that the Poles are in deep mourning [after the failure of the November Uprising of 1830], their appeal to us artists is even stronger\u00a0... If the mighty autocrat in the north [i.e. Nicholas I of Russia] could know that in Chopin's works, in the simple strains of his mazurkas, there lurks a dangerous enemy, he would place a ban on his music. Chopin's works are cannon buried in flowers!\nThe biography of Chopin published in 1863 under the name of Franz Liszt (but probably written by Carolyne zu Sayn-Wittgenstein) states that Chopin \"must be ranked among the first musicians\u00a0... individualizing in themselves the poetic sense of an entire nation\".\nSome modern commentators have argued against exaggerating Chopin's primacy as a \"nationalist\" or \"patriotic\" composer. George Golos refers to earlier \"nationalist\" composers in Central Europe, including Poland's Micha\u0142 Kleofas Ogi\u0144ski and Franciszek Lessel, who utilised polonaise and mazurka forms. Barbara Milewski suggests that Chopin's experience of Polish music came more from \"urbanised\" Warsaw versions than from folk music, and that attempts by Jachimecki and others to demonstrate genuine folk music in his works are without basis. Richard Taruskin impugns Schumann's attitude toward Chopin's works as patronising, and comments that Chopin \"felt his Polish patriotism deeply and sincerely\" but consciously modelled his works on the tradition of Bach, Beethoven, Schubert, and Field.\nA reconciliation of these views is suggested by William Atwood:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Undoubtedly [Chopin's] use of traditional musical forms like the polonaise and mazurka roused nationalistic sentiments and a sense of cohesiveness amongst those Poles scattered across Europe and the New World\u00a0... While some sought solace in [them], others found them a source of strength in their continuing struggle for freedom. Although Chopin's music undoubtedly came to him intuitively rather than through any conscious patriotic design, it served all the same to symbolize the will of the Polish people\u00a0...\nReception and influence.\nJones comments that \"Chopin's unique position as a composer, despite the fact that virtually everything he wrote was for the piano, has rarely been questioned.\" He also notes that Chopin was fortunate to arrive in Paris in 1831\u00a0\u2013 \"the artistic environment, the publishers who were willing to print his music, the wealthy and aristocratic who paid what Chopin asked for their lessons\"\u00a0\u2013 and these factors, as well as his musical genius, also fuelled his contemporary and later reputation. While his illness and his love affairs conform to some of the stereotypes of romanticism, the rarity of his public recitals (as opposed to performances at fashionable Paris soir\u00e9es) led Arthur Hutchings to suggest that \"his lack of Byronic flamboyance [and] his aristocratic reclusiveness make him exceptional\" among his romantic contemporaries such as Liszt and Henri Herz.\nChopin's qualities as a pianist and composer were recognised by many of his fellow musicians. Schumann named a piece for him in his suite \"Carnaval\", and Chopin later dedicated his Ballade No. 2 in F major to Schumann. Elements of Chopin's music can be found in many of Liszt's later works. Liszt later transcribed for piano six of Chopin's Polish songs. A less fraught friendship was with Alkan, with whom he discussed elements of folk music, and who was deeply affected by Chopin's death.\nIn Paris, Chopin had a number of pupils, including Friedericke M\u00fcller, who left memoirs of his teaching and the prodigy Carl Filtsch, to whom both Chopin and Sand became dedicated, Chopin giving him three lessons a week; Filtsch was the only pupil to whom Chopin gave lessons in composition, and, exceptionally, he on several occasions shared a concert platform with him. Two of Chopin's long-standing pupils, Karol Mikuli and Georges Mathias, were themselves piano teachers and passed on details of his playing to their students, some of whom (such as Raoul Koczalski) were to make recordings of his music. Other pianists and composers influenced by Chopin's style include Louis Moreau Gottschalk, \u00c9douard Wolff, and Pierre Zimmermann. Debussy dedicated his own 1915 piano \u00c9tudes to the memory of Chopin; he frequently played Chopin's music during his studies at the Paris Conservatoire, and undertook the editing of Chopin's piano music for the publisher Jacques Durand.\nPolish composers of the following generation included virtuosi such as Moritz Moszkowski; but, in the opinion of J. Barrie Jones, his \"one worthy successor\" among his compatriots was Karol Szymanowski. Edvard Grieg, Anton\u00edn Dvo\u0159\u00e1k, Isaac Alb\u00e9niz, Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky, and Sergei Rachmaninoff, among others, are regarded by critics as having been influenced by Chopin's use of national modes and idioms. Alexander Scriabin was devoted to the music of Chopin, and his early published works include nineteen mazurkas as well as numerous \u00e9tudes and preludes; his teacher Nikolai Zverev drilled him in Chopin's works to improve his virtuosity as a performer. In the 20th century, composers who paid homage to (or in some cases parodied) the music of Chopin included George Crumb, Leopold Godowsky, Bohuslav Martin\u016f, Darius Milhaud, Igor Stravinsky, and Heitor Villa-Lobos.\nChopin's music was used in the 1909 ballet \"Chopiniana\", choreographed by Michel Fokine and orchestrated by Alexander Glazunov. Sergei Diaghilev commissioned additional orchestrations\u00a0\u2013 from Stravinsky, Anatoly Lyadov, Sergei Taneyev, and Nikolai Tcherepnin\u00a0\u2013 for later productions, which used the title . Other noted composers have created orchestrations for the ballet, including Benjamin Britten, Roy Douglas, Alexander Gretchaninov, Gordon Jacob, and Maurice Ravel, whose score is lost.Musicologist Erinn Knyt writes: \"In the nineteenth century Chopin and his music were commonly viewed as effeminate, androgynous, childish, sickly, and 'ethnically other.'\" Music historian Jeffrey Kallberg says that in Chopin's time, \"listeners to the genre of the piano nocturne often couched their reactions in feminine imagery\", and he cites many examples of such reactions to Chopin's nocturnes. One reason for this may be \"demographic\"\u00a0\u2013 there were more female than male piano players, and playing such \"romantic\" pieces was seen by male critics as a female domestic pastime. Such genderization was not commonly applied to other genres among Chopin's works, such as the scherzo or the polonaise. The cultural historian Edward Said has cited the demonstrations by pianist and writer Charles Rosen, in the latter's book \"The Romantic Generation\", of Chopin's skills in \"planning, polyphony, and sheer harmonic creativity\", as effectively overthrowing any legend of Chopin \"as a swooning, 'inspired', small-scale salon composer\".\nChopin's music remains very popular and is regularly performed, recorded and broadcast worldwide. The world's oldest monographic music competition, the International Chopin Piano Competition, founded in 1927, is held every five years in Warsaw. \nThe Fryderyk Chopin Institute lists over eighty societies worldwide devoted to the composer and his music. The Institute site also lists over 1500 performances of Chopin works on YouTube as of March\u00a02021[ [update]].\nRecordings.\nThe British Library notes that \"Chopin's works have been recorded by all the great pianists of the recording era.\" The earliest recording was an 1895 performance by Paul Pabst of the Nocturne in E major, Op. 62, No. 2. The British Library site makes available a number of historic recordings, including some by Alfred Cortot, Ignaz Friedman, Vladimir Horowitz, Benno Moiseiwitsch, Ignacy Jan Paderewski, Arthur Rubinstein, Xaver Scharwenka, Josef Hofmann, Vladimir de Pachmann, Moriz Rosenthal and many others. A select discography of recordings of Chopin works by pianists representing the various pedagogic traditions stemming from Chopin is given by James Methuen-Campbell in his work tracing the lineage and character of those traditions.\nNumerous recordings of Chopin's works are available. On the occasion of the composer's bicentenary, the critics of \"The New York Times\" recommended performances by the following contemporary pianists (among many others): Martha Argerich, Vladimir Ashkenazy, Emanuel Ax, Evgeny Kissin, Ivan Moravec, Murray Perahia, Maria Jo\u00e3o Pires, Maurizio Pollini, Alexandre Tharaud, Yundi, and Krystian Zimerman. The Warsaw Chopin Society organises the \"Grand prix du disque de F. Chopin\" for notable Chopin recordings, held every five years.\nIn literature, stage, film, and television.\nChopin has figured extensively in Polish literature, both in serious critical studies and in fictional treatments. The earliest manifestation was probably an 1830 sonnet on Chopin by Leon Ulrich. French writers on Chopin (apart from Sand) have included Marcel Proust and Andr\u00e9 Gide, and he has also featured in works by Gottfried Benn and Boris Pasternak.\nThere are numerous English-language biographies of Chopin. \nPossibly the first venture into fictional treatments of Chopin's life was a fanciful operatic version of some of its events: \"Chopin\" (1901). The music\u00a0\u2013 based on Chopin's own\u00a0\u2013 was assembled by Giacomo Orefice, with a libretto by Angiolo Orvieto.\nChopin's life has been fictionalised in numerous films. As early as 1919, Chopin's relationships with three women\u00a0\u2013 his youth sweetheart Mariolka, then Polish singer Sonja Radkowska, and later George Sand\u00a0\u2013 were portrayed in the German silent film \"Nocturno der Liebe\" (1919). The 1945 biographical film \"A Song to Remember\" earned Cornel Wilde an Academy Award nomination as Best Actor for his portrayal of the composer. Other film treatments have included (1928) by Henry Roussel, with Pierre Blanchar as Chopin; \"Impromptu\" (1991), starring Hugh Grant as Chopin; (1991); and \"\" (2002).\nChopin's life was described in a 1999 BBC \"Omnibus\" documentary by Andr\u00e1s Schiff and Mischa Scorer, in a 2010 documentary by Angelo Bozzolini and Roberto Prosseda for Italian television, and in a 2010 BBC Four documentary, \"Chopin\u00a0\u2013 The Women Behind The Music\".\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nExternal links.\nMusic scores"}
{"id": "10825", "revid": "38962780", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=10825", "title": "Free Democratic Party (Germany)", "text": "Political party in Germany\nThe Free Democratic Party (, FDP, ) is a liberal political party in Germany. The FDP was founded in 1948 by members of former liberal political parties in Germany before World War II, namely the German Democratic Party and the German People's Party. For most of the second half of the 20th century, particularly from 1961 to 1982, the FDP held the balance of power in the Bundestag. It has been a junior coalition partner to both the CDU/CSU (1949\u20131956, 1961\u20131966, 1982\u20131998, and 2009\u20132013) and Social Democratic Party (SPD; 1969\u20131982 and 2021\u20132024).\nIn the 2013 federal election, the FDP failed to win any directly elected seats in the Bundestag and came up short of the 5 percent threshold to qualify for list representation, being left without representation in the Bundestag for the first time in its history. In the 2017 federal election, the FDP regained its representation in the Bundestag, receiving 10.6% of the vote. From the 2021 federal election to the 2024 German government crisis, the FDP was part of governing Scholz cabinet in a \"traffic light coalition\" with the SPD and the Greens. In the 2025 federal election, the party again failed to win any directly elected seats and came up short of the 5 percent threshold to qualify for list representation, leaving the party with no seats in the Bundestag.\nApart from a brief progressive and social liberal period in the 1970s (\"Freiburger Thesen\"), the FDP has traditionally been located in the centre-right of the political spectrum. Since the 1980s, the party, consistently with its ordoliberal tradition, has pushed economic liberalism and has aligned itself closely to the promotion of free markets and privatization. The FDP is a member of the Liberal International, the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, and Renew Europe.\nHistory.\nPredecessors.\nThe history of liberal parties in Germany dates back to 1861, when the German Progress Party (DFP) was founded, being the first political party in the modern sense in Germany. From the establishment of the National Liberal Party in 1867 until the demise of the Weimar Republic in 1933, the liberal-democratic camp was divided into a national-liberal and a left-liberal line of tradition. After 1918, the national-liberal strain was represented by the German People's Party (DVP), the left-liberal one by the German Democratic Party (DDP, which merged into the German State Party in 1930). Both parties played an important role in government during the Weimar Republic era, but successively lost votes during the rise of the Nazi Party beginning in the late-1920s. After the Nazi seizure of power, both liberal parties agreed to the Enabling Act of 1933 and subsequently dissolved themselves. During the 12 years of Hitler's rule, some former liberals collaborated with the Nazis (e.g. economy minister Hjalmar Schacht), while others resisted actively against Nazism, with some Liberal leaning members and former members of the military joining up with Henning von Tresckow (e.g. the Solf Circle).\nSoon after World War II, the Soviet Union pushed for the creation of licensed anti-fascist parties in its occupation zone in East Germany. In July 1945, former DDP politicians Wilhelm K\u00fclz, Eugen Schiffer, and Waldemar Koch called for the establishment of a pan-German liberal party. Their Liberal-Democratic Party (LDP) was soon licensed by the Soviet Military Administration in Germany, under the condition that the new party joined the pro-Soviet Democratic Bloc.\nIn September 1945, citizens in Hamburg\u2014including the anti-Nazi resistance circle Association Free Hamburg\u2014established the \"Party of Free Democrats\" (PFD) as a bourgeois left-wing party and the first liberal Party in the Western occupation zones. The German Democratic Party was revived in some states of the Western occupation zones (in the Southwestern states of W\u00fcrttemberg-Baden and W\u00fcrttemberg-Hohenzollern under the name of Democratic People's Party).\nMany former members of DDP and DVP however agreed to finally overcome the traditional split of German liberalism into a national-liberal and a left-liberal branch, aiming for the creation of a united liberal party. In October 1945 a liberal coalition party was founded in the state of Bremen under the name of Bremen Democratic People's Party. In January 1946, liberal state parties of the British occupation zone merged into the Free Democratic Party of the British Zone (FDP). A similar state party in Hesse, called the Liberal Democratic Party, was licensed by the U.S. military government in January 1946. In the state of Bavaria, a Free Democratic Party was founded in May 1946.\nIn the first post-war state elections in 1946, liberal parties performed well in W\u00fcrttemberg-Baden (16.8%), Bremen (18.3%), Hamburg (18.2%) and Greater Berlin (still undivided; 9.3%). The LDP was especially strong in the October 1946 state elections of the Soviet zone\u2014the last free parliamentary election in East Germany\u2014obtaining an average of 24.6% (highest in Saxony-Anhalt, 29.9%, and Thuringia, 28.5%), thwarting an absolute majority of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany (SED) that was favoured by the Soviet occupation power. This disappointment to the Communists led to a change of electoral laws in the Soviet zone, cutting the autonomy of non-socialist parties including the LDP and forcing it to join the SED-dominated National Front, making it a dependent bloc party.\nThe Democratic Party of Germany (DPD) was established in Rothenburg ob der Tauber on 17 March 1947 as a pan-German party of liberals from all four occupation zones. Its leaders were Theodor Heuss (representing the DVP of W\u00fcrttemberg-Baden in the American zone) and Wilhelm K\u00fclz (representing the LDP of the Soviet zone). However, the project failed in January 1948 as a result of disputes over K\u00fclz's pro-Soviet direction.\nFounding of the party.\nThe Free Democratic Party was established on 11\u201312 December 1948 in Heppenheim, in Hesse, as an association of all 13 liberal state parties in the three Western zones of occupation. As such, the party included former members of the pre-1933 German People's Party (DVP) which represented the more conservative and national tradition of German liberalism and members from the social liberal German Democratic Party (DDP). The proposed name, Liberal Democratic Party, was rejected by the delegates, who voted 64 to 25 in favour of the name Free Democratic Party (FDP).\nThe party's first chairman was Theodor Heuss, a member of the Democratic People's Party in W\u00fcrttemberg-Baden; his deputy was Franz Bl\u00fccher of the FDP in the British Zone. The place for the party's foundation was chosen deliberately: the \"Heppenheim Assembly\" was held at the Hotel \"Halber Mond\" on 10 October 1847, a meeting of moderate liberals who were preparing for what would be, within a few months, the German revolutions of 1848\u20131849.\n1949\u20131969: reconstruction of Germany.\nIn the first elections to the Bundestag on 14 August 1949, the FDP won a vote share of 11.9 percent (with 12 direct mandates, particularly in Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg and Hesse), and thus obtained 52 of 402 seats. In September of the same year the FDP chairman Theodor Heuss was elected the first President of the Federal Republic of Germany. In his 1954 re-election, he received the best election result to date of a President with 871 of 1018 votes (85.6 percent) of the Federal Assembly. Adenauer was also elected on the proposal of the new German President with an extremely narrow majority as the first Chancellor. The FDP participated with the CDU/CSU and the national-conservative German Party (DP) in Adenauer's coalition cabinet; they had three ministers: Franz Bl\u00fccher (Vice-Chancellor), Thomas Dehler (justice), and Eberhard Wildermuth (housing).\nOn the most important economic, social and German national issues, the FDP agreed with their coalition partners, the CDU/CSU. However, the FDP offered to middle-class voters a secular party that refused the religious schools and accused the opposition parties of clericalization. The FDP said they were known also as a consistent representative of the market economy, while the CDU was then dominated nominally from the Ahlen Programme, which allowed a Third Way between capitalism and socialism. Ludwig Erhard, the father of the social market economy, had his followers in the early years of the Federal Republic in the CDU/CSU rather than in the FDP. The FDP won Hesse's 1950 state election with 31.8 percent, the best result in its history, through appealing to East Germans displaced by the war by including them on their ticket.\nUp to the 1950s, several of the FDP's regional organizations were to the right of the CDU/CSU, particularly the Hesse, Lower Saxony, and North Rhine-Westphalia branches where Friedrich Middelhauve tried to foster a National Rally as a third bloc next to Social Democrats and Christian Democrats. This was criticized by the social liberals around Theodor Heuss who distanced himself from the \"Nazi FDP\" branches. Under the influence of the party's right wing, the Free Democrats campaigned against West Germany's denazification provisions and courted even former office-holders of the Third Reich with nationalist values. At their party conference in Munich in 1951, they demanded the release of all \"so-called war criminals\" and welcomed the establishment of the \"Association of German soldiers\" of former Wehrmacht and SS members to advance the integration of the Nazi forces in democracy. These FDP members were seen as part of the far-right extremist bloc, along with the German Party in West Germany, by US intelligence officials. The 1953 Naumann Circle, named after Werner Naumann, consisted of a group of former Nazis who tried to infiltrate the party. After the British occupation authorities had arrested seven prominent members of the Naumann Circle, the FDP federal board installed a commission of inquiry, chaired by Thomas Dehler, which particularly sharply criticized the situation in the North Rhine-Westphalian FDP. In the following years, the right wing lost power, and the extreme right increasingly sought areas of activity outside the FDP. In the 1953 federal election, the FDP received 9.5 percent of the party votes, 10.8 percent of the primary vote (with 14 direct mandates, particularly in Hamburg, Lower Saxony, Hesse, W\u00fcrttemberg, and Bavaria) and 48 of 487 seats.\nIn the second term of the Bundestag, the South German Liberal Democrats gained influence in the party controlling the party leadership between 1954 and 1960. Thomas Dehler, a representative of a more social-liberal course from Bavaria took over as party and parliamentary leader. The former Minister of Justice Dehler, who in 1933 suffered persecution by the Nazis, was known for his populist rhetorics and tried to emancipate the party from Adenauer's CDU/CSU. In the mid-1950s, there were some disagreements between Dehler and Adenauer over foreign policy issues, particularly the founding of the European Defence Community and the Saar statute. The FDP took an emphatically nationalist stance on both issues. In 1956, the infights between Dehler and Adenauer culminated in a government crisis: The FDP in North Rhine-Westphalia terminated their alliance with the Christian Democrats and formed a new state government with the Social Democratic Party of Germany and the German Center Party which led to a party split. 16 members of parliament, including former party leader Franz Bl\u00fccher and the four federal ministers from the FDP left their party and founded the short-lived Free People's Party (FVP). Whilst the FVP continued the government coalition with Adenauer's CDU/CSU and merged with the right-wing German Party in 1957, the FDP took it to the opposition for the first time in its history.\nOnly one of the smaller post-war parties, the FDP survived despite many problems. In the 1957 federal elections they still reached 7.7 percent of the vote and held 41 of 497 seats in the Bundestag. However, they still remained in opposition because the Union won an absolute majority. At the federal party meeting in Berlin at the end of January 1957, Thomas Dehler was replaced as party chairman by another liberal democrat from South Germany, Reinhold Maier, who was able to stabilize his party before he made way for Erich Mende from North Rhine-Westphalia in 1960. With Mende as party leader the FDP went into the 1961 federal election with the promise of ending Konrad Adenauer's leadership and gained 12.8 percent nationwide, the best result until then. After the election, however, the FDP again formed a coalition with Adenauer's CDU on the condition that he would retire as chancellor after two years. These events led to the FDP being nicknamed the (\"pushover party\"). In the 1962 Spiegel affair, the FDP temporarily withdrew their ministers from the federal government forcing Defence Minister Franz-Josef Strau\u00df to resign. In accordance with his agreement with the FDP, Adenauer resigned from his chancellorship in October 1963, making place for Ludwig Erhard who appointed FDP leader Erich Mende as Vice Chancellor and Minister of All-German Affairs.\nIn the 1965 federal elections the FDP gained 9.5 percent. The Free Democrats initially renewed their alliance with the CDU under Erhard but the coalition broke up in 1966 on the issue of tax increases. During the 1966-1969 Grand coalition the party led the opposition. Under their new chairman, Walter Scheel, there were signs of a change both in foreign policy and in party strategy: For the first time, the FDP opened up to a coalition with the SPD on a federal level, embracing foreign minister Willy Brandt's Ostpolitik.\n1969\u20131982: social changes and crises.\nThe 1969 West German federal election led to the first social-liberal coalition between Social Democrats and Free Democrats in German post-war history. Even though the Christian Democrats won the election, the Free Democrats rejected a new centre-right alliance and opted for a centre-left coalition under the new Chancellor Willy Brandt. With FDP leader Walter Scheel as Vice Chancellor and Foreign Minister, the liberals initiated a new controversial Ostpolitik effectively normalizing relations between capitalist-democratic West Germany and communist-led East Germany. Within the FDP, this policy was quite controversial, especially after the \"de facto\" recognition of the Oder-Neisse line by the 1970 Treaty of Warsaw.\nIn July 1970, right-wing members founded a \"non-partisan\" organization called the National-Liberal Action with the goal of breaking up the SPD/FDP coalition government. A little later, members of parliament Siegfried Zoglmann, Heinz Starke and former party leader Erich Mende left the party with Starke and Mende joining the CDU and Zoglmann founding a new splinter party called German Union \"(Deutsche Union)\". This led to the 1972 snap elections from which the SPD/FDP government emerged even stronger. In 1974, party leader Walter Scheel was the second Liberal to be elected Federal President after Theodor Heuss. He was succeeded by Interior Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher as the new FDP leader and Foreign Minister who continued the centre-left coalition under new SPD Chancellor Helmut Schmidt.\nThe party's centre-left strategy was supported by a new party manifesto, the 1971 Freiburg Theses (\"Freiburger Thesen\") which set the party on a progressive and social liberal course. Among other things, the party committed itself to \"self-determination\", \"democratization of society\", a \"reform of capitalism\" and a form of ecoliberalism which prioritized \"environmental protection over profit and personal gains\". However, in 1977, the progressive liberal Freiburg Theses were supplemented and partially revised by the more economically liberal Kiel Theses (\"Kieler Thesen\"), effectively setting the party back on a classical liberal course.\nEven prior to the 1980 West German federal election, cooperation between Social Democrats and Free Democrats seemed to come to an end but the candidacy of CSU chairman Franz Josef Strauss for chancellor led both parties to once again renew their coalition government.\n1982\u20131998: Kohl government, economic transition and reunification.\nIn the fall of 1982, the FDP reneged on its coalition agreement with the SPD and instead threw its support behind the CDU/CSU. On 1 October, the FDP and CDU/CSU were able to oust Schmidt and replace him with CDU party chairman Helmut Kohl as the new Chancellor. The coalition change resulted in severe internal conflicts, and the FDP then lost about 20 percent of its 86,500 members, as reflected in the general election in 1983 by a drop from 10.6 percent to 7.0 percent. The members went mostly to the SPD, the Greens and newly formed splinter parties, such as the left-liberal party Liberal Democrats (LD). The exiting members included the former FDP General Secretary and later EU Commissioner G\u00fcnter Verheugen.\nAt the party convention in November 1982, the Schleswig-Holstein state chairman Uwe Ronneburger challenged Hans-Dietrich Genscher as party chairman. Ronneburger received 186 of the votes\u2014about 40 percent\u2014and was just narrowly defeated by Genscher who went on to act as party chairman as well as Vice Chancellor and Foreign Minister in the new Kohl government. In the following federal election campaigns during the 1980s and 1990s, the party sided with the CDU and CSU, the main conservative parties in Germany.\nin 1980, FDP members who did not agree with the politics of the left-leaning FDP youth organization Young Democrats founded the Young Liberals (JuLis). For a time JuLis and the Young Democrats operated side by side, until the JuLis became the sole official youth wing of the FDP in 1983. The Young Democrats split from the FDP and were left as a party-independent youth organization ultimately merging with a marxist youth group to form the \"Young Democrats/Young Left\" in 1992.\nDuring the \"Peaceful Revolution\" of 1989 in the GDR, a couple of new liberal parties emerged from the opposition, like the Free Democratic Party (East Germany) or the German Forum Party. Prior to the March 1990 Volkskammer elections they joined the established Liberal Democratic Party, who had previously acted as a pro-communist bloc party on the side of the SED, to form the Alliance of Free Democrats (BFD). In the Volkskammer election of March 1990 the Association of Free Democrats was heavily supported by the West German FDP and polled 5.28% of the votes. Most of the seats went to Liberal Democratic Party members, whose leader Rainer Ortleb became their parliamentary leader. It then participated in the last GDR government led by Lothar de Maizi\u00e8re. After the Liberal Democratic Party and another former bloc party, the National Democratic Party of Germany, merged into the new party \"Association of Free Democrats\" in late March, the several liberal parties all united with the West German FDP in August 1990 to form the first all-German party. The merger brought the Free Democrats a great, albeit short-lived, increase in membership and assets of DM 6.3 million in cash and property.\nAt the time of reunification, the FDP's objective was a special economic zone in the former East Germany, but the party could not prevail against the CDU/CSU. In the first all-German Bundestag elections, the centre-right Kohl coalition was confirmed, the FDP received 11.0 percent of the valid votes (79 seats) and won in Genscher's city of birth Halle (Saale) the first direct mandate since 1957. During the 1990s, the FDP won between 6.2 and 11 percent of the vote in Bundestag elections.\nIn the second half of the 1990s, however, the FDP had to contend with a series of electoral defeats at local and state level, which led to it falling out of twelve of the 16 state parliaments and the European Parliament between 1993 and 1995. The party was derisively referred to as the 'lady without an abdomen'. At the same time, the party was shaken by new infights between the left and right wings. In 1996, Federal Minister of Justice Sabine Leutheusser-Schnarrenberger, a prominent representative of the party's social liberal wing, resigned in protest to the government's policy of expanding the state's right to interfere in citizens' private domain by means of acoustic observation \"(Gro\u00dfer Lauschangriff\", literally \"big eavesdropping attack\"). On the other hand, former Public Prosecutor General Alexander von Stahl tried to rebuild the party's national liberal wing in an ultimately failed attempt to bring the FDP onto a right-wing course modelled on J\u00f6rg Haider's FP\u00d6 in Austria.\nThese infights contributed to the CDU/CSU-FDP defeat in the 1998 German federal election which ended the 16-year centre-right coalition in Germany and the FDP's nearly three decade reign in government. For the first time since 1969 (apart from a brief period in 1982), the Free Democrats now found themselves in opposition and out of power on a federal level.\n2002 and 2005 federal elections.\nFollowing their electoral defeat, the party developed a strategy of equidistance to the CDU and SPD championed by North Rhine-Westfalia state party leader J\u00fcrgen M\u00f6llemann who led the party to a good result in the 2000 state elections. At their 2001 party conference in D\u00fcsseldorf, outgoing party leader Wolfgang Gerhardt was replaced by a 39 year old Guido Westerwelle who became the youngest FDP leader in history. The party conference also adopted a strategy developed by M\u00f6llemann which became known as 'Project 18'. It aimed at winning new groups of voters through new forms of communication and presentation and at profiling the party as an independent force autonomous from SPD and CDU. The name referred to the electoral goal of tripling the party's share of the vote from 6% to 18%. While Westerwelle and M\u00f6llemann generated a lot of media attention, the party was once again embroiled in controversy on Westerwelle's perceived lack of seriousness in his election campaign (\"Spa\u00dfwahlkampf\") and on M\u00f6llemann's alleged right-wing populism. Many critics interpreted the use of the number 18 as a hidden right-wing extremist symbol (a code for the letters A and H, meaning Adolf Hitler) and an attempt to attract voters on the far right. In addition, M\u00f6llemann launched a leaflet campaign with harsh criticism of the Israeli government under Ariel Sharon and the German-Jewish journalist Michel Friedman, which critics interpreted as anti-Semitism. Amid controversy over a possible right-wing populist orientation associated with this, the FDP ultimately achieved 7.4% instead of the targeted 18 per cent in the 2002 German federal election.\nIn the 2005 general election the party won 9.8 percent of the vote and 61 federal deputies, an unpredicted improvement from prior opinion polls. It is believed that this was partly due to tactical voting by CDU and Christian Social Union of Bavaria (CSU) alliance supporters who hoped for stronger market-oriented economic reforms than the CDU/CSU alliance called for. However, because the CDU did worse than predicted, the FDP and the CDU/CSU alliance were unable to form a coalition government. At other times, for example after the 2002 federal election, a coalition between the FDP and CDU/CSU was impossible primarily because of the weak results of the FDP.\nThe CDU/CSU parties had achieved the third-worst performance in German postwar history with only 35.2 percent of the votes. Therefore, the FDP was unable to form a coalition with its preferred partners, the CDU/CSU parties. As a result, the party was considered as a potential member of two other political coalitions, following the election. One possibility was a partnership between the FDP, the Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD) and the Alliance 90/The Greens, known as a \"traffic light coalition\", named after the colors of the three parties. This coalition was ruled out, because the FDP considered the Social Democrats and the Greens insufficiently committed to market-oriented economic reform. The other possibility was a CDU-FDP-Green coalition, known as a \"Jamaica coalition\" because of the colours of the three parties. This coalition wasn't concluded either, since the Greens ruled out participation in any coalition with the CDU/CSU. Instead, the CDU formed a Grand coalition with the SPD, and the FDP entered the opposition. FDP leader Guido Westerwelle became the unofficial leader of the opposition by virtue of the FDP's position as the largest opposition party in the Bundestag.\nIn the 2009 European election, the FDP received 11% of the national vote (2,888,084 votes in total) and returned 12 MEPs.\n2009\u20132013: Merkel II government.\nIn the September 2009 federal elections, the FDP increased its share of the vote by 4.8 percentage points to 14.6%, an all-time record. This percentage was enough to offset a decline in the CDU/CSU's vote compared to 2005, to create a CDU-FDP centre-right governing coalition in the Bundestag with a 53% majority of seats. On election night, party leader Westerwelle said his party would work to ensure that civil liberties were respected and that Germany got an \"equitable tax system and better education opportunities\".\nThe party also made gains in the two state elections held at the same time, acquiring sufficient seats for a CDU-FDP coalition in the northernmost state, Schleswig-Holstein, and gaining enough votes in left-leaning Brandenburg to clear the 5% hurdle to enter that state's parliament.\nHowever, after reaching its best ever election result in 2009, the FDP's support collapsed. The party's policy pledges were put on hold by Merkel as the Great Recession unfolded and with the onset of the European debt crisis in 2010. By the end of 2010, the party's support had dropped to as low as 5%. The FDP retained their seats in the state elections in North Rhine-Westphalia, which was held six months after the federal election, but out of the seven state elections that have been held since 2009, the FDP have lost all their seats in five of them due to failing to cross the 5% threshold.\nSupport for the party further eroded amid infighting and an internal rebellion over euro-area bailouts during the debt crisis.\nWesterwelle stepped down as party leader following the 2011 state elections, in which the party was wiped out in Saxony-Anhalt and Rhineland-Palatinate and lost half its seats in Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg. Westerwelle was replaced in May 2011 by Philipp R\u00f6sler. R\u00f6sler was the first cabinet minister and vice-chancellor of Asian background in Germany. R\u00f6sler was the first cabinet minister and vice-chancellor of Asian background in Germany. The change in leadership failed to revive the FDP's fortunes, however, and in the next series of state elections, the party lost all its seats in Bremen, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, and Berlin. In Berlin, the party lost nearly 75% of the support they had had in the previous election.\nIn March 2012, the FDP lost all their state-level representation in the 2012 Saarland state election. However, this was offset by the Schleswig-Holstein state elections, when they achieved 8% of the vote, which was a severe loss of seats but still over the 5% threshold. In the snap elections in North Rhine-Westphalia a week later, the FDP not only crossed the electoral threshold, but also increased its share of the votes to 2 percentage points higher than in the previous state election. This was attributed to the local leadership of Christian Lindner.\n2013 federal election.\nThe FDP last won a directly elected seat in 1990, in Halle\u2014the only time it has won a directly elected seat since 1957. The party's inability to win directly elected seats came back to haunt it at the 2013 election, in which it came up just short of the 5% threshold. With no directly elected seats, the FDP was shut out of the Bundestag for the first time since 1949. After the previous chairman Philipp R\u00f6sler then resigned, Christian Lindner took over the leadership of the party.\n2014 European and state elections.\nIn the 2014 European parliament elections, the FDP received 3.4% of the national vote (986,253 votes in total) and returned 3 MEPs. In the 2014 Brandenburg state election the party experienced a 5.8% down-swing and lost all their representatives in the Brandenburg state parliament. In the 2014 Saxony state election, the party experienced a 5.2% down-swing, again losing all of its seats. In the 2014 Thuringian state election a similar phenomenon was repeated with the party falling below the 5% threshold following a 5.1% drop in popular vote.\n2015\u20132020.\nThe party managed to enter parliament in the 2015 Bremen state election with the party receiving 6.5% of the vote and gaining 6 seats. However, it failed to get into government as a coalition between the Social Democrats and the Greens was created. In the 2016 Mecklenburg-Vorpommern state election the party failed to get into parliament despite increasing its vote share by 0.3%. The party did manage to get into parliament in Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg, gaining 3% of the vote and a total of 12 seats. This represents a five-seat improvement over their previous results. In the 2016 Berlin state election the party gained 4.9% of the vote and 12 seats but still failed to get into government. A red-red-green coalition was instead formed relegating the FDP to the opposition. In the 2016 Rhineland-Palatinate state election, the party managed to enter parliament receiving 6.2% of the vote and 7 seats. It also managed to enter government under a traffic light coalition. In 2016 Saxony-Anhalt state election the party narrowly missed the 5% threshold, receiving 4.9% of the vote and therefore receiving zero seats despite a 1% swing in their favour.\nThe 2017 North Rhine-Westphalia state election was widely considered a test of the party's future as their chairman Christian Lindner was also leading the party in that state. The party experienced a 4% swing in its favour gaining 6 seats and entering into a coalition with the CDU with a bare majority. In the 2017 Saarland state election the party again failed to gain any seats despite a 1% swing in their favour. The party gained 3 seats and increased its vote share by 3.2% in the 2017 Schleswig-Holstein state election. This success was often credited to their state chairman Wolfgang Kubicki. They also managed to re-enter the government under a Jamaica coalition.\nIn the 2017 federal election the party scored 10.7% of votes and re-entered the Bundestag, winning 80 seats. After the election, a Jamaica coalition was considered between the CDU, Greens, and FDP. However, FDP chief Christian Lindner walked out of the coalition talks due to a disagreement over European migration policy, saying \"It is better not to govern than to govern badly.\" As a result, the CDU/CSU formed another grand coalition with the SPD.\nThe FDP won 5.4% and 5 seats in the 2019 European election.\nIn the October 2019 Thuringian state election, the FDP won seats in the Landtag of Thuringia for the first time since 2009. It exceeded the 5% threshold by just 5 votes. In February 2020, the FDP's Thomas Kemmerich was elected Minister-President of Thuringia by the Landtag with the likely support of the CDU and AfD, becoming the second member of the FDP to serve as head of government in a German state. This was also the first time a head of government had been elected with the support of AfD. Under intense pressure from state and federal politicians, Kemmerich resigned the following day, stating he would seek new elections. The next month, he was replaced by Bodo Ramelow of The Left; the FDP did not run a candidate in the second vote for Minister-President.\n2021\u2013present.\nIn 2021, the FDP returned to the Saxony-Anhalt state parliament after five years of absence. They had similar success in Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg and Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, but faced setbacks in Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg, Berlin and Rhineland-Palatinate.\nIn the September 2021 federal election, the CDU/CSU under Armin Laschet was defeated. The FDP saw both its vote share and number of seats grow, to 11.5% and 92 seats respectively. As a result, the SPD, Greens, and FDP entered talks to form an \"Ampelkoalition\" (traffic light coalition). In the agreement finalized on 24 November, the FDP held four federal ministries in the Scholz cabinet (Finance, Justice, Digital and Transport and Education and Research).\nAfter the comeback in the Federal Government, the FDP saw poor approval in national opinion polls, and started falling out of multiple state parliaments. In March 2022, the FDP didn't win any seats in Saarland. Then in October it lost all 11 of their seats in Lower Saxony. It also lost all 12 seats in the 2023 Berlin repeat state election, and in May they lost over half their seats in North Rhine-Westphalia and Schleswig-Holstein. In the 2023 Bavarian state election, where Martin Hagen led the party, it lost all 11 seats. The FDP were similarly wiped out in the 2024 Thuringian state election, where Thomas Kemmerich lost his party's 5 seats, again in the 2024 Saxony state election, where the FDP achieved less than 1% of the vote, and lastly in the 2025 Hamburg state election, where the party lost its last constituency sit, making a total of six states where the party was wiped out since 2021.\nIn the 2024 European Parliament elections the party kept on 5 seats, coming in sixth, behind the newly formed BSW.\nIn November 2024, Christian Lindner was fired as Minister of Finance. The FDP leaving the coalition meant the collapse of the traffic light government. With the crisis taking place the four ministries held by the party were lost, as Marco Buschmann and Bettina Stark-Watzinger resigned. However, Digital and Transport minister Volker Wissing decided to resign from the FDP instead in order to stay in cabinet. On the same month controversy was sparked after Die Zeit and S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung reported that the crisis was in fact a deliberate strategy by the FDP, planned for weeks in advance, in a paper with heavy use of militaristic terminology, including the word D-Day, a reference to allied invasion of Normany during WWII. The reports contradicted declarations by the party leader Lindner on Scholz \"calculated break\" of the governing coalition.\nIn the subsequent snap election, FDP failed to reach the 5% threshold needed for parliamentary representation and as a result lost all their seats in Bundestag again. Christian Lindner and Wolfgang Kubicki would resign from party leadership.\nIdeology and platform.\nThe FDP's political position has variously been described as centrist, centre-right, and right-wing. The FDP has been described as liberal, conservative liberal, classical liberal, and liberal conservative. Others have described the party as fiscally conservative, libertarian, or right-libertarian.\nThe FDP is a predominantly classical-liberal inspired party, both in the sense of supporting free market economic policies and in the sense of policies emphasizing the minimization of government interference in individual affairs. During election campaigning, the party has emphasised support for tax cuts, reductions in government spending and balanced budgets. The party has also been described by various media sources as neoliberal. Scholars of political science have historically identified the FDP as closer to the CDU/CSU bloc than to the Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD) on economic issues but closer to the SPD and the Greens on issues such as civil liberties, education, defense, and foreign policy. The FDP has oriented itself towards a centrist position between the CDU and the SPD; however, it is to the right of the CDU in its socioeconomics perspective, environmental and labour policies.\nThe party is a traditional supporter of ordoliberalism, having been influenced by the economic theories of Wilhelm R\u00f6pke and Alexander R\u00fcstow. Otto Graf Lambsdorff, who served as Federal Minister of Economics, is a historical FDP grandee who was a proponent of ordoliberalism. In 1971 during its federal social-liberal coalition with the SPD, the FDP published the Freiburger Thesis programme, heralding an ideological move towards reformism and social liberalism, and support for environmental protection. However, the party's 1977 Kiel Theses and 1985 Liberal Manifesto returned the FDP towards its traditional free-market, ordoliberal approach. Historical members of the party's social-liberal wing included Gerhart Baum and Werner Maihofer, a faction who remained organised as the Freiberg Circle. Alternatively to the liberal-orientated wings of the party are a conservative or national-conservative wing, influenced by the populist and nationalist developments of the Freedom Party of Austria and the New Right. The FDP's national-conservative wing has included individuals such as Rainer Zitelmann, Klaus Rainer R\u00f6hl, Alexander von Stahl, and J\u00fcrgen M\u00f6llemann, and was organised as the Liberal Offensive. M\u00f6llemann in particular was noted for his role during the 2002 federal election in attempting to push the party in a right-wing populist direction, albeit ultimately with poor electoral results.\nDuring the 2017 federal election, the party called for Germany to adopt an immigration channel using a Canada-style points-based immigration system; spend up to 3% of GDP on defense and international security; phase out the solidarity surcharge tax (which was first levied in 1991 to pay for the costs of absorbing East Germany after German reunification); cut taxes by 30 billion euro (twice the amount of the tax cut proposed by the CDU); and improve road infrastructure by spending 2 billion euro annually for each of the next two decades, to be funded by selling government stakes in Deutsche Bahn, Deutsche Telekom, and Deutsche Post. The FDP also called for the improvement of Germany's digital infrastructure, the establishment of a Ministry of Digital Affairs, and greater investment in education.\nThe party supports replacement migration in response to the decline and aging of Germany's population. In 2020, Christian D\u00fcrr said that Germany should accept 500,000 immigrants per year. The party also supports allowing dual citizenship (in contrast to the CDU/CSU, which opposes it) but also supports requiring third-generation immigrants to select a single nationality.\nThe FDP supports the legalization of cannabis in Germany, and opposes proposals to heighten Internet surveillance. The FDP supports same-sex marriage in Germany. The FDP supports legalisation of altruistic surrogacy. The FDP has mixed views on European integration. In its 2009 campaign manifesto, the FDP pledged support for ratification of the Lisbon Treaty as well as EU reforms aimed at enhancing transparency and democratic responsiveness, reducing bureaucracy, establishing stringent curbs on the EU budget, and fully liberalizing the Single Market. At its January 2019 congress ahead of the 2019 European Parliament election, FDP's manifesto called for further EU reforms, including reducing the number of European Commissioners to 18 from the current 28, abolishing the European Economic and Social Committee, and ending the European Parliament's \"traveling circus\" between Brussels and Strasbourg. Vice chairwoman and Deputy Leader Nicola Beer stated: \"We want both more and less Europe.\"\nElectorate.\nIn 1940s and 1950s, the FDP was the only German party strongly in favour of market economy, while the CDU/CSU was still adhering to a \"third way\" between capitalism and socialism. Initially founded as a party uniting liberals and nationalists, the early FDP wanted former Nazis to be reintegrated into society and demanded a release of Nazi war criminals.\nThe party's membership has historically been largely male; in 1995, less than one-third of the party's members were women, and in the 1980s women made up less than one-tenth of the party's national executive committee. By the 1990s, the percentage of women on the FDP's national executive committee rose to 20%.\nThe party tends to draw its support from professionals and self-employed Germans. It lacks consistent support from a voting bloc, such as the trade union membership that supports the SPD or the church membership that supports the CDU/CSU, and thus has historically only garnered a small group of \"Stammw\u00e4hler\" (core voters) who consistently vote for the party.\nIn the 2021 elections, the FDP was the second-most popular party among voters under age 30; among this demographic, the Greens won 22% of the vote, the FDP 19%, the SPD 17%, the CDU/CSU 11%, Die Linke 8%, and the AfD 8%. According to Deutsche Welle in 2021, voters for both the FDP and the Greens are similar in being younger, politically centrist professionals living in cities, unlike left working-class voters and right Christian voters.\nEuropean representation.\nIn the European Parliament the Free Democratic Party sits in the Renew Europe group with five MEPs.\nElection results.\nFederal parliament (\"Bundestag\").\nBelow are charts of the results that the FDP has secured in each election to the federal Bundestag.

The original document is scanned with a fax machine (or a telecopier), which processes the contents (text or images) as a single fixed graphic image, converting it into a bitmap, and then transmitting it through the telephone system in the form of audio-frequency tones. The receiving fax machine interprets the tones and reconstructs the image, printing a paper copy. Early systems used direct conversions of image darkness to audio tone in a continuous or analog manner. Since the 1980s, most machines transmit an audio-encoded digital representation of the page, using data compression to transmit areas that are all-white or all-black, more quickly. \nInitially a niche product, fax machines became ubiquitous in offices in the 1980s and 1990s. However, they have largely been rendered obsolete by Internet-based technologies such as email and the World Wide Web, but are still used in some medical administration and law enforcement settings. \nHistory.\nWire transmission.\nScottish inventor Alexander Bain worked on chemical-mechanical fax-type devices and in 1846 Bain was able to reproduce graphic signs in laboratory experiments. He received British patent 9745 on May 27, 1843, for his \"Electric Printing Telegraph\". Frederick Bakewell made several improvements on Bain's design and demonstrated a telefax machine. The Pantelegraph was invented by the Italian physicist Giovanni Caselli. He introduced the first commercial telefax service between Paris and Lyon in 1865, some 11 years before the invention of the telephone.\nIn 1880, English inventor Shelford Bidwell constructed the \"scanning phototelegraph\" that was the first telefax machine to scan any two-dimensional original, not requiring manual plotting or drawing. An account of Henry Sutton's \"telephane\" was published in 1896. Around 1900, German physicist Arthur Korn invented the \"Bildtelegraph\", widespread in continental Europe especially following a widely noticed transmission of a wanted-person photograph from Paris to London in 1908, used until the wider distribution of the radiofax. Its main competitors were the \"B\u00e9linographe\" by \u00c9douard Belin first, then since the 1930s the \"Hellschreiber\", invented in 1929 by German inventor Rudolf Hell, a pioneer in mechanical image scanning and transmission.\nThe 1888 invention of the telautograph by Elisha Gray marked a further development in fax technology by making it possible for users to send signatures over long distances. This was used for verifying identification or ownership over long distances.\nOn May 19, 1924, scientists of the AT&amp;T Corporation \"by a new process of transmitting pictures by electricity\" sent 15 photographs by telephone from Cleveland to New York City, such photos being suitable for newspaper reproduction. Previously, photographs had been sent over the radio using this process.\nThe Western Union \"Deskfax\" fax machine, announced in 1948, was a compact machine that fit comfortably on a desktop, using special spark printer paper.\nWireless transmission.\nAs a designer for the Radio Corporation of America (RCA), in 1924, Richard H. Ranger invented the wireless photoradiogram, or transoceanic radio facsimile, the forerunner of today's \"fax\" machines. A photograph of President Calvin Coolidge sent from New York to London on November 29, 1924, became the first photo picture reproduced by transoceanic radio facsimile. Commercial use of Ranger's product began two years later. Also in 1924, Herbert E. Ives of AT&amp;T transmitted and reconstructed the first color facsimile, a natural-color photograph of silent film star Rudolph Valentino in period costume, using red, green and blue color separations.\nBeginning in the late 1930s, the Finch Facsimile system was used to transmit a \"radio newspaper\" to private homes via commercial AM radio stations and ordinary radio receivers equipped with Finch's printer, which used thermal paper. Sensing a new and potentially golden opportunity, competitors soon entered the field, but the printer and special paper were expensive luxuries, AM radio transmission was very slow and vulnerable to static, and the newspaper was too small. After more than ten years of repeated attempts by Finch and others to establish such a service as a viable business, the public, apparently quite content with its cheaper and much more substantial home-delivered daily newspapers, and with conventional spoken radio bulletins to provide any \"hot\" news, still showed only a passing curiosity about the new medium.\nBy the late 1940s, radiofax receivers were sufficiently miniaturized to be fitted beneath the dashboard of Western Union's \"Telecar\" telegram delivery vehicles.\nIn the 1960s, the United States Army transmitted the first photograph via satellite facsimile to Puerto Rico from the Deal Test Site using the Courier satellite.\nRadio fax is still in limited use today for transmitting weather charts and information to ships at sea. The closely related technology of slow-scan television is still used by amateur radio operators.\nTelephone transmission.\nIn 1964, Xerox Corporation introduced (and patented) what many consider to be the first commercialized version of the modern fax machine, under the name (LDX) or Long Distance Xerography. This model was superseded two years later with a unit that would set the standard for fax machines for years to come. Up until this point facsimile machines were very expensive and hard to operate. In 1966, Xerox released the Magnafax Telecopiers, a smaller, facsimile machine. This unit was far easier to operate and could be connected to any standard telephone line. This machine was capable of transmitting a letter-sized document in about six minutes. The first sub-minute, digital fax machine was developed by Dacom, which built on digital data compression technology originally developed at Lockheed for satellite communication.\nAnalog facsimile machines worked by optical scanning of a document or drawing spinning on a drum. The reflected light, varying in intensity according to the light and dark areas of the document, was focused on a photocell so that the current in a circuit varied with the amount of light. This current was used to control a tone generator (a modulator), the current determining the frequency of the tone produced. This audio tone was then transmitted using an acoustic coupler (a speaker, in this case) attached to the microphone of a common telephone handset. At the receiving end, a handset's speaker was attached to an acoustic coupler (a microphone), and a demodulator converted the varying tone into a variable current that controlled the mechanical movement of a pen or pencil to reproduce the image on a blank sheet of paper on an identical drum rotating at the same rate.\nDigital transmission and height of popularity.\nBy the late 1970s, many companies around the world (especially Japanese firms) had entered the fax market, and prices for long-distance faxing in 1978 were significantly lower than they had been in 1968, both at high and low speeds. Faxes had become useful to large newspapers and multinational corporations, and some digital methods were being developed. However, the rise of the market was fairly slow. Individual manufacturers had purposefully developed incompatible transmission methods in order to prevent their customers from buying from competitors. The CCITT (later ITU-T) Recommendation T.3, defining group 2 fax machines, was the first to offer interoperability in 1976, with a speed of three minutes per page. \nIn 1980, the CCITT's Recommendation T.4 promised groundbreaking interoperability for digital fax machines, with transmission times of just 40 seconds per page. Accompanying this, a new wave of more compact, faster and efficient fax machines hit the market, leading to two decades of ubiquitous faxing in business contexts. Xerox continued to refine the fax machine for years after their ground-breaking first machine. In later years it would be combined with copier equipment to create the hybrid machines we have today that copy, scan and fax. Some of the lesser known capabilities of the Xerox fax technologies included their Ethernet enabled Fax Services on their 8000 workstations in the early 1980s.\nIn 1985, Hank Magnuski, founder of GammaLink, produced the first computer fax board, called GammaFax. Such boards could provide voice telephony via Analog Expansion Bus.\nIn the 21st century.\nAlthough businesses usually maintain some kind of fax capability, the technology has faced increasing competition from Internet-based alternatives. In some countries, such as Germany, because electronic signatures on contracts are not yet recognized by law, while faxed contracts with copies of signatures are, fax machines enjoy continuing support in business. In Japan, faxes are still used extensively as of September 2020 for cultural reasons, including widespread preference for handwriting over typing. They are available for sending to both domestic and international recipients from over 81% of all convenience stores nationwide. Convenience-store fax machines commonly print the slightly re-sized content of the sent fax in the electronic confirmation-slip, in A4 paper size. Use of fax machines for reporting cases during the COVID-19 pandemic has been criticised in Japan for introducing data errors and delays in reporting, slowing response efforts to contain the spread of infections and hindering the transition to remote work.\nIn many corporate environments, freestanding fax machines have been replaced by fax servers and other computerized systems capable of receiving and storing incoming faxes electronically, and then routing them to users on paper or via an email (which may be secured). Such systems have the advantage of reducing costs by eliminating unnecessary printouts and reducing the number of inbound analog phone lines needed by an office.\nThe once ubiquitous fax machine has also begun to disappear from the small office and home office environments. Remotely hosted fax-server services are widely available from VoIP and e-mail providers. Users can send and receive faxes using them with their existing e-mail accounts instead of dedicated hardware and fax lines. Personal computers have also long been able to handle incoming and outgoing faxes using analog modems or ISDN. These solutions are often ideally suited for users who only very occasionally need to use fax services. In July 2017 the United Kingdom's National Health Service was said to be the world's largest purchaser of fax machines because the digital revolution has largely bypassed it. In June 2018 the Labour Party said that the NHS had at least 11,620 fax machines in operation and in December the Department of Health and Social Care said that no more fax machines could be bought from 2019 and that the existing ones must be replaced by secure email by March 31, 2020.\nLeeds Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust, generally viewed as digitally advanced in the NHS, was engaged in a process of removing its fax machines in early 2019. This involved quite a lot of e-fax solutions because of the need to communicate with pharmacies and nursing homes which may not have access to the NHS email system and may need something in their paper records.\nIn 2018 two-thirds of Canadian doctors reported that they primarily used fax machines to communicate with other doctors. Faxes are still seen as safer and more secure and electronic systems are often unable to communicate with each other.\nHospitals are the leading users for fax machines in the United States where some doctors prefer fax machines over emails, often due to concerns about accidentally violating HIPAA.\nCapabilities.\nThere are several indicators of fax capabilities: group, class, data transmission rate, and conformance with ITU-T (formerly CCITT) recommendations. Since the 1968 Carterfone decision, most fax machines have been designed to connect to standard PSTN lines and telephone numbers.\nGroup.\nAnalog.\nGroup 1 and 2 faxes are sent in the same manner as a frame of analog television, with each scanned line transmitted as a continuous analog signal. Horizontal resolution depended upon the quality of the scanner, transmission line, and the printer. Analog fax machines are obsolete and no longer manufactured. ITU-T Recommendations T.2 and T.3 were withdrawn as obsolete in July 1996.\nDigital.\nA major breakthrough in the development of the modern facsimile system was the result of digital technology, where the analog signal from scanners was digitized and then compressed, resulting in the ability to transmit high rates of data across standard phone lines. The first digital fax machine was the Dacom Rapidfax first sold in late 1960s, which incorporated digital data compression technology developed by Lockheed for transmission of images from satellites.\nGroup 3 and 4 faxes are digital formats and take advantage of digital compression methods to greatly reduce transmission times.\nFax Over IP (FoIP) can transmit and receive pre-digitized documents using ITU-T recommendation T.38 to send digitised images over an IP network using JPEG compression. T.38 is designed to work with VoIP services and often supported by analog telephone adapters used by legacy fax machines that need to connect through a VoIP service. Scanned documents are limited to the amount of time the user takes to load the document in a scanner and for the device to process a digital file. The resolution can vary from as little as 150\u00a0DPI to 9600\u00a0DPI or more. This type of faxing is not related to the e-mail\u2013to\u2013fax service that still uses fax modems at least one way.\nClass.\nComputer modems are often designated by a particular fax class, which indicates how much processing is offloaded from the computer's CPU to the fax modem.\nData transmission rate.\nSeveral different telephone-line modulation techniques are used by fax machines. They are negotiated during the fax-modem handshake, and the fax devices will use the highest data rate that both fax devices support, usually a minimum of 14.4\u00a0kbit/s for Group\u00a03 fax.\n\"Super Group\u00a03\" faxes use V.34bis modulation that allows a data rate of up to 33.6\u00a0kbit/s.\nCompression.\nAs well as specifying the resolution (and allowable physical size) of the image being faxed, the ITU-T\u00a0T.4 recommendation specifies two compression methods for decreasing the amount of data that needs to be transmitted between the fax machines to transfer the image. The two methods defined in T.4 are:\nAn additional method is specified in T.6:\nLater, other compression techniques were added as options to ITU-T recommendation T.30, such as the more efficient JBIG (T.82, T.85) for bi-level content, and JPEG (T.81), T.43, MRC (T.44), and T.45 for grayscale, palette, and colour content. Fax machines can negotiate at the start of the T.30 session to use the best technique implemented on both sides.\nModified Huffman.\nModified Huffman (MH), specified in T.4 as the one-dimensional coding scheme, is a codebook-based run-length encoding scheme optimised to efficiently compress whitespace. As most faxes consist mostly of white space, this minimises the transmission time of most faxes. Each line scanned is compressed independently of its predecessor and successor.\nModified READ.\nModified READ, specified as an optional two-dimensional coding scheme in T.4, encodes the first scanned line using MH. The next line is compared to the first, the differences determined, and then the differences are encoded and transmitted. This is effective, as most lines differ little from their predecessor. This is not continued to the end of the fax transmission, but only for a limited number of lines until the process is reset, and a new \"first line\" encoded with MH is produced. This limited number of lines is to prevent errors propagating throughout the whole fax, as the standard does not provide for error correction. This is an optional facility, and some fax machines do not use MR in order to minimise the amount of computation required by the machine. The limited number of lines is 2 for \"Standard\"-resolution faxes, and 4 for \"Fine\"-resolution faxes.\nModified Modified READ.\nThe ITU-T T.6 recommendation adds a further compression type of Modified Modified READ (MMR), which simply allows a greater number of lines to be coded by MR than in T.4. This is because T.6 makes the assumption that the transmission is over a circuit with a low number of line errors, such as digital ISDN. In this case, the number of lines for which the differences are encoded is not limited.\nJBIG.\nIn 1999, ITU-T recommendation T.30 added JBIG (ITU-T T.82) as another lossless bi-level compression algorithm, or more precisely a \"fax profile\" subset of JBIG (ITU-T T.85). JBIG-compressed pages result in 20% to 50% faster transmission than MMR-compressed pages, and up to 30 times faster transmission if the page includes halftone images.\nJBIG performs adaptive compression, that is, both the encoder and decoder collect statistical information about the transmitted image from the pixels transmitted so far, in order to predict the probability for each next pixel being either black or white. For each new pixel, JBIG looks at ten nearby, previously transmitted pixels. It counts, how often in the past the next pixel has been black or white in the same neighborhood, and estimates from that the probability distribution of the next pixel. This is fed into an arithmetic coder, which adds only a small fraction of a bit to the output sequence if the more probable pixel is then encountered.\nThe ITU-T T.85 \"fax profile\" constrains some optional features of the full JBIG standard, such that codecs do not have to keep data about more than the last three pixel rows of an image in memory at any time. This allows the streaming of \"endless\" images, where the height of the image may not be known until the last row is transmitted.\nITU-T T.30 allows fax machines to negotiate one of two options of the T.85 \"fax profile\":\nMatsushita Whiteline Skip.\nA proprietary compression scheme employed on Panasonic fax machines is Matsushita Whiteline Skip (MWS). It can be overlaid on the other compression schemes, but is operative only when two Panasonic machines are communicating with one another. This system detects the blank scanned areas between lines of text, and then compresses several blank scan lines into the data space of a single character. (JBIG implements a similar technique called \"typical prediction\", if header flag TPBON is set to 1.)\nTypical characteristics.\nGroup 3 fax machines transfer one or a few printed or handwritten pages per minute in black-and-white (bitonal) at a resolution of 204\u00d798 (normal) or 204\u00d7196 (fine) dots per square inch. The transfer rate is 14.4\u00a0kbit/s or higher for modems and some fax machines, but fax machines support speeds beginning with 2400 bit/s and typically operate at 9600 bit/s. The transferred image formats are called ITU-T (formerly CCITT) fax group 3 or 4. Group 3 faxes have the suffix codice_1 and the MIME type codice_2.\nThe most basic fax mode transfers in black and white only. The original page is scanned in a resolution of 1728 pixels/line and 1145 lines/page (for A4). The resulting raw data is compressed using a modified Huffman code optimized for written text, achieving average compression factors of around 20. Typically a page needs 10\u00a0s for transmission, instead of about three minutes for the same uncompressed raw data of 1728\u00d71145 bits at a speed of 9600\u00a0bit/s. The compression method uses a Huffman codebook for run lengths of black and white runs in a single scanned line, and it can also use the fact that two adjacent scanlines are usually quite similar, saving bandwidth by encoding only the differences.\nFax classes denote the way fax programs interact with fax hardware. Available classes include Class 1, Class 2, Class 2.0 and 2.1, and Intel CAS. Many modems support at least class 1 and often either Class 2 or Class 2.0. Which is preferable to use depends on factors such as hardware, software, modem firmware, and expected use.\nPrinting process.\nFax machines from the 1970s to the 1990s often used direct thermal printers with rolls of thermal paper as their printing technology, but since the mid-1990s there has been a transition towards plain-paper faxes: thermal transfer printers, inkjet printers and laser printers.\nOne of the advantages of inkjet printing is that inkjets can affordably print in color; therefore, many of the inkjet-based fax machines claim to have color fax capability. There is a standard called ITU-T30e (formally ITU-T Recommendation T.30 Annex E ) for faxing in color; however, it is not widely supported, so many of the color fax machines can only fax in color to machines from the same manufacturer.\nStroke speed.\nStroke speed in facsimile systems is the rate at which a fixed line perpendicular to the direction of scanning is crossed in one direction by a scanning or recording spot. Stroke speed is usually expressed as a number of strokes per minute. When the fax system scans in both directions, the stroke speed is twice this number. In most conventional 20th century mechanical systems, the stroke speed is equivalent to drum speed.\nFax paper.\nAs a precaution, thermal fax paper is typically not accepted in archives or as documentary evidence in some courts of law unless photocopied. This is because the image-forming coating is eradicable and brittle, and it tends to detach from the medium after a long time in storage.\nFax tone.\nA CNG tone is an 1100\u00a0Hz tone transmitted by a fax machine when it calls another fax machine. Fax tones can cause complications when implementing fax over IP.\nInternet fax.\nOne popular alternative is to subscribe to an Internet fax service and send and receive faxes from a personal computers using an existing email account. No software, fax server or fax machine is needed. Faxes are received as attached TIFF or PDF files, or in proprietary formats that require the use of the service provider's software. Faxes can be sent or retrieved from anywhere at any time that a user can get Internet access. Some services offer secure faxing to comply with stringent HIPAA and Gramm\u2013Leach\u2013Bliley Act requirements to keep medical information and financial information private and secure. Utilizing a fax service provider does not require paper, a dedicated fax line, or consumable resources.\nAnother alternative to a physical fax machine is to make use of computer software which sends and receives faxes utilizing fax servers and unified messaging. A virtual (email) fax can be printed out and then signed and scanned back into a computer to be emailed. Also the sender can attach a digital signature to the document file.\nWith the surging popularity of mobile phones, virtual fax machines can now be downloaded as applications for Android and iOS. These applications make use of the phone's internal camera to scan fax documents for upload or they can import from various cloud services.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "10827", "revid": "49281287", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=10827", "title": "Film crew", "text": "Group of people involved in some phase of the making of a film\nA film crew is a group of people, hired by a production company, for the purpose of producing a film or motion picture. The crew is distinguished from the cast, as the cast are understood to be the actors who appear in front of the camera or provide voices for characters in the film. The crew is also separate from the producers, as the producers are the ones who own a portion of either the film studio or the film's intellectual property rights. A film crew is divided into different departments, each of which specializes in a specific aspect of the production. Film crew positions have evolved over the years, spurred by technological change, but many traditional jobs date from the early 20th century and are common across jurisdictions and filmmaking cultures.\nMotion picture projects have three discrete stages: development, production, and distribution. Within the production stage there are also three clearly defined sequential phases (pre-production, principal photography, and post-production) and many film crew positions are associated with only one or two of the phases. Distinctions are also made between above-the-line personnel (such as the director, screenwriter, and producers) who begin their involvement during the project's development stage, and the below-the-line technical crew involved only with the production stage.\nDirector.\nA director is the person who directs the making of a film. The director most often has the highest authority on a film set. Generally, a director controls a film's artistic and dramatic aspects and visualizes the screenplay (or script) while guiding the technical crew and actors in the fulfillment of that vision. The director has a key role in choosing the cast members, production design, and the creative aspects of filmmaking. Under European Union law, the director is viewed as the author of the film.\nThe director gives direction to the cast and crew, and creates an overall vision through which a film eventually becomes realized or noticed. Directors need to be able to mediate differences in creative visions and stay within the boundaries of the film's budget. There are many pathways to becoming a film director. Some directors started as screenwriters, cinematographers, film editors, or actors. Other directors have attended a film school. Directors use different approaches. Some outline a general plotline and let the actors improvise dialogue, while others control every aspect, and demand that the actors and crew follow instructions precisely. Some directors also write their own screenplays or collaborate on screenplays with long-standing writing partners. Some directors edit or appear in their films, or compose the music score for their films.\nProduction.\nProduction is generally not considered a department as such, but rather as a series of functional groups. These include the film's producers and executive producers and production office staff such as the production manager, the production coordinator, and their assistants; the various assistant directors; the accounting staff and sometimes the locations manager and their assistants.\n A film producer creates the conditions for filmmaking. The producer initiates, coordinates, supervises, and controls matters such as fund raising, hiring key personnel, and arranging for distributors. The producer is involved throughout all phases of the film making process from development to completion of a project. There may be several producers on a film who may take a role in a number of areas, such as development, financing or production.\n An executive producer (EP) is a producer who was not involved in the technical aspects of the filmmaking process in the original definition, but has played a financial or creative role in ensuring that the project goes into production. Today, however, the title has become ambiguous, particularly in feature films. Since the 1980s, it has become increasingly common for the line producer to be given the title of executive producer, while the initiating producer takes the \"produced by\" credit. On other projects, the reverse happens, with the line producer taking the \"produced by\" credit. So the two credits have become effectively interchangeable, with no precise definition.\n The line producer is the liaison between the studio or producer and the production manager, responsible for managing the production budget. The title is associated with the idea that they are the person who is \"on the line\" on a day-to-day basis, and responsible for lining up the resources needed.\n Production assistants, referred to as PAs, assist in the production office or in various departments with general tasks, such as assisting the first assistant director with set operations.\n The production manager supervises the physical aspects of the production (not the creative aspects) including personnel, technology, budget, and scheduling. It is the production manager's responsibility to make sure the filming stays on schedule and within its budget. The PM also helps manage the day-to-day budget by managing operating costs such as salaries, production costs, and everyday equipment rental costs. The PM often works under the supervision of a line producer and directly supervises the production coordinator.\n The assistant production manager is the assistant to the production manager (PM) and carries out various jobs for the PM. Normally only big budget Hollywood feature films have an assistant PM.\n The unit manager fulfills the same role as the production manager but for secondary \"unit\" shooting. In some functional structures, the unit manager subsumes the role of the transport coordinator.\n The production coordinator is the information nexus of the production, responsible for organizing all the logistics from hiring crew, renting equipment, and booking talent. The PC is an integral part of film production.\n The first assistant director (1st AD) assists the production manager and director. The ultimate aim of any 1st AD is to ensure the film comes in on schedule while maintaining a safe working environment in which the director, principal artists (actors) and crew can be focused on their work. They oversee day-to-day management of the cast and crew scheduling, equipment, script, and set. A 1st AD may also be responsible for directing background action for major shots or the entirety of relatively minor shots, at the director's discretion.\n The second assistant director (2nd AD) is the chief assistant of the 1st AD and helps carry out those tasks delegated to the 1st AD. The 2nd AD may also direct background action and extras in addition to helping the 1st AD with scheduling, booking, etc. The 2nd AD is responsible for creating call sheets that let the crew know the schedule and important details about the shooting day.\n Sometimes other assistant directors are needed such as in Canadian and British functional structures the 3rd assistant director (3rd AD) and even trainee assistant directors (trainee AD). In the American system there are 2nd 2nd assistant director (2nd 2nd AD). Normally in the American system 2nd 2nd ADs control big crowd extras and make sure if shooting on location none of the public get into shots.\n Production accountants manage the money and ensure the production comes in on budget and everyone gets paid. The industry is notorious for unusual accounting methods which are collectively labelled Hollywood accounting. Production accountants are often assisted by assistant accountants, sometimes called clerks, responsible for accounts receivable, accounts payable and payroll.\n Oversees the locations department and its staff, typically reporting directly to the production manager or assistant director (or even director or executive producer). Location manager is responsible for final clearing (or guaranteeing permission to use) a location for filming and must often assist production and finance departments in maintaining budget management regarding actual location/permit fees as well as labor costs to production for the locations department at large.\n Works with the location manager and the various departments in arranging technical scouts for the essential staff (grips, electric, camera, etc.) to see options which the location manager has selected for filming. The assistant location manager will be onset during the filming process to oversee the operation, whereas the location manager continues pre-production from elsewhere (generally an office) on the upcoming locations. (On most location-based television shows, there will be two assistant location managers that alternate episodes, allowing one to prep an upcoming episode while the other is on set with the current one)\n Does much of the actual research, footwork and photography to document location possibilities. Often the location manager will do some scouting themselves, as well as the assistant location manager.\n Hired by the location manager to be on set before, during, and after the filming process. General responsibilities include arriving first at the location to allow the set dressers into the set for preparation; maintaining the cleanliness of the location areas during filming; fielding complaints from neighbours; and ultimately, at the end of the filming, making sure it seems as though the film crew was never there. There are generally one to three assistants on a shoot at any given time.\n This position exists generally on larger budget productions. The locations PA is the assistant who is almost never on set, but instead is always prepping a location or \"wrapping\" a location; that is, when a location requires several days of setup and breakdown preceding and following the day(s) of filming. A location production assistant is what a set production assistant is in Canada.\nDigital service.\nSince the turn of the 21st century, several additional professionals are now routinely listed in the production credits on most major motion pictures.\n The publicist liaises between the film production and the media. They create press releases, in collaboration with the producers, and work with the unit still photographer.\n Entertainment lawyers negotiate contracts, clear licensing rights for any intellectual property used in the film, obtain tax credits from local governments, and take care of immigration paperwork when cast or crew cross international borders to shoot on location.\n A system administrator or sysadmin, is a person employed to maintain and operate a computer system or network. This role is increasingly important for digital monitors on set, digital intermediate editing and post production, digital effects, digital sound, and sometimes for full digital production.\n Also known as the continuity person, the script supervisor keeps track of what parts of the script have been filmed and makes notes of any deviations between what was actually filmed and what appeared in the script. They make notes on every shot, and keep track of props, blocking, and other details to ensure continuity between shots and scenes. An important part of a script supervisor's job is to make sure that the actors' movements, the directions they are looking in a shot, particularly when speaking to or responding to another actor, plus the positions of props they are using and every thing else matches from shot to shot. If there is an apparent mismatch, the director must be informed immediately so that it can be reshot before the lighting setup is changed or at least before the location is wrapped and the set is struck. Not only does the job of script supervisor require a great deal of awareness and meticulous note-taking skills, it also requires much diplomacy to advise the director that they may have a problem editing something just recorded. The script supervisor is also in charge of providing the \"official\" scene numbers and take numbers to the second camera assistant (clapper loader in some countries) for the slate, as well as to the sound mixer, and to clearly note which take the director has chosen to be used (as a \"print\", in film terms) in the finished product. All of this information is then relayed to the editor every day after shooting has wrapped in the form of copies made of both the script supervisor's notes as well as their matching script pages.\n The casting director chooses the actors for the characters of the movie. This usually involves inviting potential actors to read an excerpt from the script for an audition.\n The cast PA assists the actors of the film. This usually involves personal and technical requests, that might be highly sensible and private or common domain or knowledge.\n The director of photography (sometimes shortened to DP or DoP) is in charge of the look of the \"frame\" of the movie shots, hence the name \"photography\". They are the chief of the camera and lighting crew of the film. The DP makes decisions on lighting and framing of shots in conjunction with the film's director. Typically, the director tells the DP how they want a shot to look, and the DP chooses the correct lens, filter, lighting and composition to achieve the desired aesthetic effect. The DP is the senior creative crew member after the director.\n The term cinematographer is usually synonymous with director of photography, though some professionals insist this only applies when the director of photography and camera operator are the same person.\n The camera operator uses the camera at the direction of the cinematographer, director of photography, or the film director to capture the scenes on film or video. Generally, a cinematographer or director of photography does not operate the camera, but sometimes these jobs may be combined.\n The first assistant camera, 1st AC or focus puller, is responsible for keeping the camera in focus as it is shooting, as well as building the camera at the beginning of the day and taking it apart at the end. They also thread the film when a new magazine is loaded.\n The second assistant camera, 2nd AC or clapper loader, operates the clapperboard commonly referred to in the United States as a \"slate\" at the beginning of each take and loads the raw film stock or blank videocassette into the camera magazines between takes, if there is no additional specifically designated film loader. The 2nd AC is also in charge of overseeing the meticulously kept notebooks that record when the film stock is received, used, and sent to the lab for processing. Additionally, the 2nd AC oversees organization of camera equipment and transport of the equipment from one shooting location to another.\n The film loader transfers motion picture film from the manufacturer's light-tight canisters to the camera magazines for attachment to the camera by the 2nd AC. After exposure during filming, the loader then removes the film from the magazines and places it back into the light-tight cans for transport to the laboratory. It is the responsibility of the loader to manage the inventory of film and communicate with the 1st AC on the film usage and remaining stock throughout the day. On small production crews, this job is often combined with the 2nd AC. With the prevalence of digital photography, this role is taken on by the digital imaging technician.\n The camera PA, camera intern or camera trainee, assists the crew while learning the trade of the camera assistant, operator or cinematographer.\n On digital photography productions the digital imaging technician, or DIT, is responsible for the coordination of the internal workings of the digital camera. Under the direction of the cinematographer or director of photography, the DIT will make adjustments to the multitude of variables available in most professional digital cameras to creatively or technically manipulate the resulting image. It may also be the responsibility of the DIT to archive and manage the digital data, create compressed dailies from raw footage and prepare all digital images for post-production.\n A steadicam operator is someone who is skilled at operating a steadicam (trademark for a camera stabilization rig). This person is usually one of the camera operators on the production.\n This technician operates a motion control rig, which essentially is a 'camera robot' able to consistently repeat camera moves for special effects uses. Motion control rigs are typically rented with an experienced operator.\n The Set Photographer is the person who creates film stills, still photographic images specifically intended for use in the marketing and publicity. \n The gaffer is the head of the lighting department, responsible for the design of the lighting plan for a production. Sometimes the gaffer is credited as chief lighting technician.\n The best boy electric is the chief assistant to the gaffer. They are not usually on set, but dealing with upkeep of the lighting truck, rentals, manpower, and other logistics. Sometimes the best boy electric is credited as assistant chief lighting technician.\n Also called electrics or lamp operators, lighting technicians are involved with setting up and controlling lighting equipment and temporary power distribution on set.\nCamera and lighting.\nGrip.\nGrips are trained lighting and rigging technicians. Their main responsibility is to work closely with the electrical department to put in the non-electrical components of lighting set-ups required for a shot, such as flags, overheads, and bounces. On the sound stage, they move and adjust major set pieces when something needs to be moved to get a camera into position. In addition to lifting heavy objects and setting rigging points for lights, they also report to the key grip. In the US and Canada, grips may belong to the International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees.\n The key grip is the chief grip on a set, and is the head of the set operations department. The key grip works with the director of photography to help set up the set and to achieve correct lighting and blocking. They are also used to manoeuver the cameras around the set.\n The best boy is chief assistant to the key grip. They are also responsible for organizing the grip truck throughout the day.\n The grip in charge of operating the camera dollies and camera cranes is called the dolly grip. They place, level, and move the dolly track, then push and pull the dolly, and usually a camera operator and camera assistant as riders.\n The production sound mixer (or sound recordist) is the head of the sound department on location and is responsible for the operation of the audio mixer and recorder(s) which receive feeds from the microphones on set. It is their responsibility to decide how they will deploy their team to capture the sound for each shot, select which microphones will be used for each setup, mix audio from all of the microphones in real time into a \"mix track\" that will be used while viewing rushes and during the edit, and sometimes in the final film, and to maintain logs of audio related issues for post production. The sound mixer is considered a department head, and is thus completely responsible for all aspects of production sound.\n The boom operator, first assistant sound or \"1st AS\", is responsible for using microphones on the end of boom poles (lightweight telescopic poles made of aluminium, or more commonly, carbon fibre) held above actor's heads during a scene to capture dialogue. It is also their responsibility to relay information from the \"floor\" back to the production sound mixer regarding upcoming shots, troublesome noises that the mixer will need to be made aware of if they can not be silenced, and for mounting radio microphones on actors. In France, the boom operator is called the perchman.\n The second assistant sound, utility sound technician, or \"2nd AS\", is the assistant to the boom operator and is responsible for moving and preparing sound equipment for use around the set while the boom op watches rehearsals and prepares for the next shot, as well as handling wireless audio feeds to the director, script supervisor and producers, and laying carpet and other sound dampening materials in locations with problematic floors or a troublesome acoustic. In addition, the 2nd AS is regularly called upon to operate a second boom in scenes with a larger number of actors or where actors are physically spaced too far apart for the 1st AS to cover all of the dialogue with one microphone. The 2nd AS also regularly aids in the radio mic'ing of cast when there are a large number of actors in a scene. The term \"sound utility technician\" is now considered an outdated term by BECTU in the UK and 2nd AS is preferred, with sound utility technician as a role being omitted from recent versions of the rate card. The role is sometimes informally known as a \"cable wrangler\" or \"cable boy\".\nArt department.\nThe art department in a major feature film can often number hundreds of people. Usually it is considered to include several sub-departments: the art department proper, with its art director, set designers and draftsmen; set decoration, under the set decorator; props, under the props master/mistress; construction, headed by the construction coordinator; scenic, headed by the key scenic artist; and special effects.\n The production designer is responsible for creating the visual appearance of the film \u2013 settings, costumes, character makeup; all taken as a unit. The production designer works closely with the director and the director of photography to achieve the look of the film.\nArt (sets and graphic art).\nWithin the overall art department is a sub-department, also called the art department \u2013 which can be confusing. This consists of the people who design the sets and create the graphic art.\n The art director reports to the production designer, and more directly oversees artists and craftspeople, such as the set designers, graphic artists, and illustrators who give form to the production design as it develops. The art director works closely with the construction coordinator and key scenic artist to oversee the aesthetic and textural details of sets as they are realized. Typically, the art director oversees the budget and schedule of the overall art department. On large-budget productions with numerous sets and several art directors, one might be credited as supervising art director or senior art director.\n In the organizational system used in Ireland or the United Kingdom, the standby art director monitors the art department's work on set during filming on behalf of the production designer. They work closely with the standby painters and standby carpenters, and co-ordinate any changes to the set during filming. In the North American system, this work is shared between the props master and the on-set dresser.\n The first, second and third assistant art directors carry out the instructions of the art director. Their work often involves measuring locations and collecting other pertinent information for the production designer. Sometimes a set designer is also the first assistant art director. In this capacity, they manage the workflow and act as the foreman of the drawing office.\n The illustrator draws or paints visual representations of the designs to communicate the ideas imagined by the production designer. Illustrators are sometimes credited as concept artists.\n The graphic artist is responsible for the design and creation of all graphic elements, including: signs, billboards, posters, logos, nameplates, and automotive-wrapping \u2014 that are created specifically for the film. They will often create several versions of a design, the preferred of which then being chosen by the production designer. On certain productions, they may also be employed, under the direction of the props master, in the creation of small, printed items, such as fliers, receipts, bills of sale, etc.\n The set designer is the draftsman, often an architect, who realizes the structures or interior spaces called for by the production designer.\n The set decorator is in charge of the decorating of a film set, which includes the furnishings and all the other objects that will be seen in the film. They work closely with the production designer and coordinate with the art director. In recognition of the set decorator's importance, the Academy Award for art direction is given jointly to both the production designer and the set decorator.\n The buyer works with, and reports to, the set decorator. The buyer locates, and then purchases or rents the set dressing. Then there is the Leadman. The leadman (or leadperson) is the foreman of the set dressing crew, often referred to as the swing gang. They also assist the set decorator.\n The set dressers apply and remove the \"dressing\"; i.e., furniture, drapery, carpets, wall signs, vinyl decals \u2013 everything one would find in a location, (even doorknobs and wall sockets, when such items do not fall under the purview of construction.) Most of the swing gang's work occurs before and after the shooting crew arrives, but one set dresser remains with the shooting crew and is known as the on-set dresser. In some countries, such as Ireland or the United Kingdom, the set dressing department is referred to as dressing props department. Informally, in the US, the department is often referred to simply as \"set dec\".\n The greensman or greensperson is a specialised set dresser dealing with the artistic arrangement or landscape design of plant material, sometimes real and sometimes artificial, and usually a combination of both. Depending on the scope of the greens work in a film, the greensperson may report to the art director or may report directly to the production designer. If a significant amount of greens work is required in a film, then the greens may be an identifiable sub-department, with its own team \u2013 often of a size numbering double figures \u2013 and hierarchy (e.g., greensmaster, greens supervisor, foreperson, leading hand, laborers). Specialists from other areas of the art dept. (e.g., fabricators, sculptors, painters, scenics) may also be drafted to work exclusively on greens.\n The construction coordinator oversees the construction of all the sets. The coordinator orders materials, schedules the work, and supervises the often sizeable construction crew of carpenters, painters and labourers. In some jurisdictions the construction coordinator is called the construction manager.\n The head carpenter is the foreman of a gang of carpenters and laborers.\n The propmaker (prop fabricator), as the name implies, builds the props that are used for the film. In US jurisdictions, propmakers are carpenters who build props and sets, and are often technicians skilled in wood and metalwork.\n The key scenic artist (scenic charge) is responsible for the surface treatments of the sets. This includes special paint treatments such as aging and gilding, as well as simulating the appearance of wood, stone, brick, metal, stained glass\u2014anything called for by the production designer. The key scenic artist supervises the crew of painters, and is often a master craftsperson. In the UK, the above responsibilities would normally be those of the head painter, and the scenic artist is responsible for producing artist painted backings. In the US, a key scenic is called the charge scenic.\n The Head of the Plastering Department is responsible for managing fibrous plasterers, who are highly skilled plasters who can re-create any period, using mold making and casting abilities.\n The propmaster or mistress is in charge of finding and managing all the props that appear in the film. These include any items handled by actors that are not part of the scenery or costumes, and all consumable food items that appear on screen. Job responsibilities include purchasing, renting, and manufacturing anything actors handle or touch. In period works, it is the propmaster's job to ensure that the props provided are accurate to the time period. The propmistress usually has several assistants. The assistant propmaster is the person running the set and in charge of working directly with the actors, director, and on-set crew. \n Any film that uses a prop gun that is a \"realistic imitation firearm\" should have a weapons master. The weapons master, sometimes credited as the armorer, weapons specialist, weapons handler, weapons wrangler, or weapons coordinator, is a film-crew specialist who works with the propmaster, director, actors, stunt coordinator, and script supervisor. The weapons master is specifically responsible for maintaining control of any prop weapons, including firearms, knives, swords, bows, and staff weapons.\n The costume designer is responsible for all the clothing and costumes worn by all the actors that appear on screen. They are also responsible for designing, planning, and organizing the construction of the garments down to the fabric, colors, and sizes. The costume designer works closely with the director to understand and interpret \"character\", and counsels with the production designer to achieve an overall tone of the film. In large productions, the costume designer will usually have one or more assistant costume designers.\n The costume supervisor works closely with the designer. In addition to helping with the design of the costumes, they manage the wardrobe workspace. They supervise construction or sourcing of garments, hiring and firing of support staff, budget, paperwork, and department logistics. It is also called the wardrobe supervisor, although this term is used less and less.\n The key costumer is employed on larger productions to manage the set costumers, and to handle the star's wardrobe needs.\n The costume standby is present on set at all times. It is his or her responsibility to monitor the quality and continuity of the actors and actresses costumes before and during takes. she or he will also assist the actors and actresses with dressing.\n A breakdown artist may be employed during the pre-production period to break down garments. This specialized job includes making new clothing appear dirty, faded, and worn.\n On large productions a buyer may be employed to source and purchase fabrics and garments. A buyer might also be referred to as a shopper. This distinction is often made when the lead actor in a production has control over their wardrobe, and they may personally hire this person.\n A costume technician who fits or tailors costumes, usually on set. They might also be called fitter, seamstress, or tailor. Some celebrity actors have favorite cutters, and larger productions may hire several and have them on set at the same time, particularly in period film projects that might have complicated or expensive extras wardrobe.\nCostume department.\nHair and make-up.\nSome actors or actresses have personal makeup artists or hair stylists.\n The makeup designer is the department head that answers directly to the director and production designer. They are responsible for planning makeup designs for all leading and supporting cast. Their department includes all cosmetic makeup, body makeup and if special effects are involved, the makeup designer will consult with a special effects makeup team to create all prosthetics and SFX makeup in a production. It is common that the makeup designer performs makeup applications on lead cast, with assistance, and allows other crew members to work with supporting and minor roles. The designer will normally execute especially complicated or important makeup processes that are to be featured on camera.\nSpecial effects.\nThe special effects department oversees the mechanical effects (also called physical or practical effects) that create optical illusions during live-action shooting. It is not to be confused with the visual effects department, which adds photographic effects during filming to be altered later during video editing in the post-production process.\n The special effects supervisor instructs the special effects crew on how to design moving set elements and props that will safely break, explode, burn, collapse and implode without destroying the film set. He or she is also responsible for reproducing weather conditions and other on-camera magic.\n The SFX assistants carry out the instructions of the special effects supervisor, building set pieces like breakaway furniture and cities in miniature, lighting pyrotechnics, and setting up rigging equipment for stunts.\n Where the film requires a stunt and involves the use of stunt performers, the stunt coordinator will arrange the casting and performance of the stunt, working closely with the director and the 1st AD.\n Films and TV programs in general should always have a set or unit medic on set at all times from construction, through filming and to strike but a film unit that has stunts must always have trained senior EMT(A) or Paramedic on Set.\n The film editor is the creative head of the post production department and is responsible for assembling the picture into a cohesive edited story, with the help of the director. They are primarily responsible for selecting performances of the actors with the director, adjusting the tempo, pace, and structure of the final edited film. In some cases, the editor may help restructure the story of a film differently from the original script to focus a story point, or increase an emotional response from the audience. They are also involved with providing feedback on the sound mix, visual effects, and music with the director. They can also collaborate with the colorist and director of photography to adjust framing for mood or eye trace. There are usually several assistant editors who creatively support the editor as well as manage footage and data for the entire post production team.\n Post-production supervisors are responsible for the post-production process, during which they maintain clarity of information and good channels of communication between the producer, editor, supervising sound editor, the facilities companies (such as film labs, CGI studios and negative cutters) and the production accountant. Although this is not a creative role, it is pivotal in ensuring that the film's post-production budget is manageable and achievable, and that all deadlines are met. Because large amounts of money are involved, and most of a film's budget is spent during production, the post-production period can often be difficult and challenging.\n The negative cutter cuts and splices the negatives as directed by the film editor, and then provides the assembled negative reels to the lab for prints (positives for projection) to be made.\n With a photochemical process, the color timer adjusts the color of the film via printer lights for greater consistency in the film's colors. With a digital intermediate process, the colorist can use digital tools in manipulating the image and has greater creative freedom in changing the aesthetic of a film.\n A telecine colorist is responsible for a \"grade\", a look that has been created with a grading system, which adjusts brightness, contrast and color.\nPost-production.\nVisual effects.\nVisual effects commonly refers to post-production alterations of the film's images. The on set VFX crew works to prepare shots and plates for future visual effects. This may include adding tracking markers, taking and asking for reference plates and helping the director understand the limitations and ease of certain shots that will effect the future post production. A VFX crew can also work alongside the special effects department for any on-set optical effects that need physical representation during filming (on camera).\n The visual effects producer works with the visual effects supervisor to break down the script into storyboards, and advises the director as to how she or he should approach the scenes. Together they determine which sequences are to be shot as live action elements, which would work well in miniature, and which (if any) should be computer generated.\n VFX creative directors are very much like production designers, except they direct and supervise the creative side of the film's visual effects. The position is particularly in demand for films with massive amounts of computer generated imagery and scenes.\n The visual effects supervisor is in charge of the VFX crew, working with production and the film's director to achieve the desired in-camera optical effects of the film.\n The visual effects editor incorporates visual effects into the current cuts of live action sequences, producing multiple versions of each shot. Altered scenes are then evaluated by the visual effects supervisor and creative director for aesthetic and technical direction, and by the producers for review and final editing.\n A compositor is a visual effects artist responsible for compositing images from different sources such as video, film, computer generated 3D imagery, 2D animations, matte paintings, photographs, and text.\n Rotoscope and paint artists may rotoscope the footage, manually creating mattes for use in compositing. They may also paint visual information into or out of a scene, such as removing wires and rigs, logos, dust busting, scratch removal, etc.\n Matte painters draw and paint entire sets or extend portions of an existing set.\n The sound designer, or supervising sound editor, is in charge of the post-production sound of a movie. Sometimes this may involve great creative license, and other times it may simply mean working with the director and editor to balance the sound to their liking.\n The dialogue editor is responsible for assembling and editing all the dialog in the soundtrack.\n The sound editor is responsible for assembling and editing all the sound effects in the soundtrack.\n The re-recording mixer balances all of the sounds prepared by the dialogue, music and effects editors, and finalizes the film's audio track.\n The music supervisor works with the composer, mixers and editors to create and integrate the film's music. In Hollywood, a music supervisor's primary responsibility is to act as liaison between the film production and the recording industry, negotiating the use rights for all source music used in a film.\n The composer is responsible for writing the musical score for a film.\n The foley artist is the person who creates the post-sync sound effects for a film. These sound effects are recorded in sync to picture and are mostly body movements, footsteps or object manipulations. The most common reason for recording these effects live to picture is the fact that such sounds are lost when the dialogue is removed to be replaced by a foreign-language version. Unsatisfactorily recorded sync sound effects can also be replaced with foley effects. Foley artists are also known as foley walkers. Foley is named after its first known practitioner, an early Hollywood sound editor named Jack Foley.\n A conductor is supposed to be knowledgeable of special synchronization procedures to conduct the score to an orchestra. An orchestrator is someone who furthers the composer's notes and symbols and fills out the intended notation for the film score.\n A score's recorder is someone who records the film score and a score's mixer is someone who mixes the film score.\n A music preparer is someone who prepares out the score for orchestra performers and who copies out the music.\n A music editor is someone who edits the film score and works with the composer to make sure it goes with the film.\n Additional orchestration people work with the conductor and orchestrator, and edit the film score.\nPrevisualization.\nPrevisualization (also known as previs, previz, pre-rendering, preview, or wireframe windows) is the visualizing of complex scenes in a film before filming. It is also a concept in still photography. It is also used to describe techniques such as storyboarding, either in the form of charcoal sketches or in digital technology, in the planning and conceptualization of film scenes.\nAnimation.\nAnimation film crews have many of the same roles and departments as live-action films (including directing, production, editing, camera, sound, etc.), but nearly all on-set departments (lighting, electrical, grip, sets, props, costume, hair, makeup, special effects, and stunts) were traditionally replaced with a single animation department made up of various types of animators (character, effects, in-betweeners, cleanup, etc.). In traditional animation, the nature of the medium meant that everything was literally flattened into the drawn lines and solid colors that became the characters, making nearly all live-action positions irrelevant. Because animation has traditionally been so labor-intensive and thus expensive, animation films normally have a separate story department in which storyboard artists painstakingly develop scenes to make sure they make sense before they are actually animated.\nHowever, since the turn of the 21st century, modern 3D computer graphics and computer animation have made possible a level of rich detail never seen before. Many animated films now have specialized artists and animators who act as the virtual equivalent of lighting technicians, grips, costume designers, props masters, set decorators, set dressers, and cinematographers. They make artistic decisions strongly similar to those of their live-action counterparts, but implement them in a virtual space that exists only in software rather than on a physical set. There have been major breakthroughs in the simulation of hair since 2005, meaning that hairstylists have been called in since then to consult on a few animation projects.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "10828", "revid": "44085581", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=10828", "title": "Fear", "text": "Basic emotion induced by a perceived threat\nFear is an unpleasant subjective emotional state arising in response to perceived dangers or threats and which, when experienced, is typically associated with physiological and psychological changes. These changes frequently lead to behavioral reactions such as fight-or-flight responses or, in extreme cases, immobilization (freeze response). Unlike most (perhaps all) other animals, humans can experience fear in response to a present or anticipated stimulus and to imagined events.\nMost internalizing psychopathologies (depression, anxiety, suicidal thoughts and behaviors, and so forth) are associated with and maintained by dysfunctional, anxious, or fearful feelings and thoughts. Phobias, or exaggerated and often disabling fears, are usually similarly dysfunctional.\nFear is often framed as a distinct product of evolution. This hypothesis, however, is becoming increasingly problematic because the psychological, (neuro)physiological, and behavioral changes and features associated with fear are consistently found to be shared with other negative, highly arousing emotional states such as anger, sadness, disgust, and anxiety. A more scientifically defensible product of evolution is \"flexibility\", or the capacity to both change bodily states and address bodily needs through various behaviors, and, later, for humans, through language too (e.g., by employing categories like \"fear\"). Attributing fear to nonverbal animals, whether an invertebrate or vertebrate, is equally problematic because the human observer is always imposing that label. Nonverbal animals displaying an emotion \"akin to fear\" are rather fundamentally exhibiting reflexive defensive behaviors\u2014your fear may be their withdrawal, avoidance, or defensiveness. It is therefore no surprise that human fear, along with other negative emotions, is inextricably linked to culture, social context, and trait-level differences.\nPhysiological signs.\nMany physiological changes in the body are associated with fear, summarized as the fight-or-flight response. An innate response for coping with danger, it works by accelerating the breathing rate (hyperventilation), heart rate, vasoconstriction of the peripheral blood vessels leading to blood pooling, dilating the pupils, increasing muscle tension including the muscles attached to each hair follicle to contract and causing \"goosebumps\", or more clinically, piloerection (making a cold person warmer or a frightened animal look more impressive), sweating, increased blood glucose (hyperglycemia), increased serum calcium, increase in white blood cells called neutrophilic leukocytes, alertness leading to sleep disturbance and \"butterflies in the stomach\" (dyspepsia). This primitive mechanism may help an organism survive by either running away or fighting the danger. With the series of physiological changes, the consciousness realizes an emotion of fear.\nThere are observable physical reactions in individuals who experience fear. An individual might experience a feeling of dizziness, lightheadedness, like they are being choked, sweating, shortness of breath, vomiting or nausea, numbness or shaking and any other like symptoms. These bodily reactions inform the individual that they are afraid and should proceed to remove or get away from the stimulus that is causing that fear.\nIn the CNN article \"This is your brain on a haunted house\u201d, the appeal of haunted houses have people arguing on why we pay to be scared. The primal thrill of surviving the experience is the main reason. This feeling which is part of a booming, billion-dollar Halloween industry biologically causes fright triggers and a fight-or-flight response (amygdala and cortisol surge) but also releases pleasurable neurochemicals like dopamine (from novelty) and Oxycontin (from bonding). Experts emphasize that the key to enjoyment is the combination of intense terror and safety, as visitors know the threat is merely a theatrical illusion. Culturally, the experience provides a catharsis for fears of death and an escape from a mundane daily life, allowing attendees to feel confident and brave afterward. \nCauses.\nAn influential categorization of stimuli causing fear was proposed by psychologist Jeffrey Alan Gray; namely, intensity, novelty, special evolutionary dangers, stimuli arising during social interaction, and conditioned stimuli. Another categorization was proposed by Archer, who, besides conditioned fear stimuli, categorized fear-evoking (as well as aggression-evoking) stimuli into three groups; namely, pain, novelty, and frustration, although he also described \"looming\", which refers to an object rapidly moving towards the visual sensors of a subject, and can be categorized as \"intensity\". Russell described a more functional categorization of fear-evoking stimuli, in which for instance novelty is a variable affecting more than one category: 1) Predator stimuli (including movement, suddenness, proximity, but also learned and innate predator stimuli); 2) Physical environmental dangers (including intensity and heights); 3) Stimuli associated with increased risk of predation and other dangers (including novelty, openness, illumination, and being alone); 4) Stimuli stemming from conspecifics (including novelty, movement, and spacing behavior); 5) Species-predictable fear stimuli and experience (special evolutionary dangers); and 6) Fear stimuli that are not species predictable (conditioned fear stimuli).\nNature.\nAlthough many fears are learned, the capacity to fear is part of human nature. Many studies have found that certain fears (e.g., animals, heights) are much more common than others (e.g., flowers, clouds). These fears are also easier to induce in the laboratory. This phenomenon is known as preparedness. Because early humans that were quick to fear dangerous situations were more likely to survive and reproduce; preparedness is theorized to be a genetic effect that is the result of natural selection.\nFrom an evolutionary psychology or evolutionary psychiatry perspective, different fears may be different adaptations that have been useful in our evolutionary past. They may have developed during different time periods. Some fears, such as fear of heights (acrophobia), may be common to all mammals and developed during the mesozoic period. Other fears, such as fear of snakes, may be common to all simians and developed during the cenozoic time period (the still-ongoing geological era encompassing the last 66 million of history). Still others, such as fear of mice and insects, may be unique to humans and developed during the Paleolithic and Neolithic time periods (when mice and insects became important carriers of infectious diseases and harmful for crops and stored foods). \nConditioning.\nNonhuman animals and humans innovate specific fears as a result of learning. This has been studied in psychology as fear conditioning, beginning with John B. Watson's Little Albert experiment in 1920, which was inspired after observing a child with an irrational fear of dogs. In this study, an 11-month-old boy was conditioned to fear a white rat in the laboratory. The fear became generalized to include other white, furry objects, such as a rabbit, dog, and even a Santa Claus mask with white cotton balls in the beard.\nFear can be learned by experiencing or watching a frightening traumatic accident. For example, a child falling into a well and struggling to get out may develop a fear of wells, heights (acrophobia), enclosed spaces (claustrophobia), or water (aquaphobia). There are studies looking at areas of the brain that are affected in relation to fear. When looking at these areas (such as the amygdala), it was proposed that a person learns to fear regardless of whether they themselves have experienced trauma, or if they have observed the fear in others. In a study completed by Andreas Olsson, Katherine I. Nearing and Elizabeth A. Phelps, the amygdala were affected both when subjects observed someone else being submitted to an aversive event, knowing that the same treatment awaited themselves, and when subjects were subsequently placed in a fear-provoking situation. This suggests that fear can develop in both conditions, not just simply from personal history.\nFear is affected by cultural and historical context. For example, in the early 20th century, many Americans feared polio, a disease that can lead to paralysis. There are consistent cross-cultural differences in how people respond to fear. Display rules affect how likely people are to express the facial expression of fear and other emotions.\nFear of victimization is a function of perceived risk and seriousness of potential harm.\nCommon triggers.\nPhobias.\nAccording to surveys, some of the most common fears are of demons and ghosts, the existence of evil powers, cockroaches, spiders, snakes, heights, water, enclosed spaces, tunnels, bridges, needles, social rejection, failure, examinations, and public speaking.\nRegionally some may more so fear terrorist attacks, death, war, criminal or gang violence, being alone, the future, nuclear war, flying, clowns, intimacy, people, and driving.\nUncertainty.\nFear of the unknown or irrational fear is caused by negative thinking (worry) which arises from anxiety accompanied by a subjective sense of apprehension or dread. Irrational fear shares a common neural pathway with other fears, a pathway that engages the nervous system to mobilize bodily resources in the face of danger or threat. Many people are scared of the \"unknown\". The irrational fear can branch out to many areas such as the hereafter, the next ten years or even tomorrow. Chronic irrational fear has deleterious effects since the elicitor stimulus is commonly absent or perceived from delusions. Such fear can create comorbidity with the anxiety disorder umbrella. Being scared may cause people to experience anticipatory fear of what may lie ahead rather than planning and evaluating for the same. For example, \"continuation of scholarly education\" is perceived by many educators as a risk that may cause them fear and stress, and they would rather teach things they've been taught than go and do research.\nThe ambiguity of situations that tend to be uncertain and unpredictable can cause anxiety in addition to other psychological and physical problems in some populations; especially those who engage it constantly, for example, in war-ridden places or in places of conflict, terrorism, abuse, etc. Poor parenting that instills fear can also debilitate a child's psyche development or personality. For example, parents tell their children not to talk to strangers in order to protect them. In school, they would be motivated to not show fear in talking with strangers, but to be assertive and also aware of the risks and the environment in which it takes place. Ambiguous and mixed messages like this can affect their self-esteem and self-confidence. Researchers say talking to strangers is not something to be thwarted but allowed in a parent's presence if required. Developing a sense of equanimity to handle various situations is often advocated as an antidote to irrational fear and as an essential skill by a number of ancient philosophies.\nFear of the unknown (FOTU) \"may be a, or possibly the, fundamental fear\" from early times when there were many threats to life.\nBehavior.\nAlthough fear behavior varies from species to species, it is often divided into two main categories; namely, avoidance/flight and immobility. To these, different researchers have added different categories, such as threat display and attack, protective responses (including startle and looming responses), defensive burying, and social responses (including alarm vocalizations and submission). Finally, immobility is often divided into freezing and tonic immobility.\nThe decision as to which particular fear behavior to perform is determined by the level of fear as well as the specific context, such as environmental characteristics (escape route present, distance to refuge), the presence of a discrete and localized threat, the distance between threat and subject, threat characteristics (speed, size, directness of approach), the characteristics of the subject under threat (size, physical condition, speed, degree of crypsis, protective morphological structures), social conditions (group size), and the amount of experience with the type of the threat.\nMechanism.\nOften laboratory studies with rats are conducted to examine the acquisition and extinction of conditioned fear responses. In 2004, researchers conditioned rats (\"Rattus norvegicus\") to fear a certain stimulus, through electric shock. The researchers were able to then cause an extinction of this conditioned fear, to a point that no medications or drugs were able to further aid in the extinction process. The rats showed signs of avoidance learning, not fear, but simply avoiding the area that brought pain to the test rats. The avoidance learning of rats is seen as a conditioned response, and therefore the behavior can be unconditioned, as supported by the earlier research.\nSpecies-specific defense reactions (SSDRs) or avoidance learning in nature is the specific tendency to avoid certain threats or stimuli, it is how animals survive in the wild. Humans and animals both share these species-specific defense reactions, such as the flight-or-fight, which also include pseudo-aggression, fake or intimidating aggression and freeze response to threats, which is controlled by the sympathetic nervous system. These SSDRs are learned very quickly through social interactions between others of the same species, other species, and interaction with the environment. These acquired sets of reactions or responses are not easily forgotten. The animal that survives is the animal that already knows what to fear and how to avoid this threat. An example in humans is the reaction to the sight of a snake, many jump backwards before cognitively realizing what they are jumping away from, and in some cases, it is a stick rather than a snake.\nAs with many functions of the brain, there are various regions of the brain involved in deciphering fear in humans and other nonhuman species. The amygdala communicates both directions between the prefrontal cortex, hypothalamus, the sensory cortex, the hippocampus, thalamus, septum, and the brainstem. The amygdala plays an important role in SSDR, such as the ventral amygdalofugal, which is essential for associative learning, and SSDRs are learned through interaction with the environment and others of the same species. An emotional response is created only after the signals have been relayed between the different regions of the brain, and activating the sympathetic nervous systems; which controls the flight, fight, freeze, fright, and faint response. Often a damaged amygdala can cause impairment in the recognition of fear (like the human case of patient S.M.). This impairment can cause different species to lack the sensation of fear, and often can become overly confident, confronting larger peers, or walking up to predatory creatures.\nRobert C. Bolles (1970), a researcher at University of Washington, wanted to understand species-specific defense reactions and avoidance learning among animals, but found that the theories of avoidance learning and the tools that were used to measure this tendency were out of touch with the natural world. He theorized the species-specific defense reaction (SSDR). There are three forms of SSDRs: flight, fight (pseudo-aggression), or freeze. Even domesticated animals have SSDRs, and in those moments it is seen that animals revert to atavistic standards and become \"wild\" again. Dr. Bolles states that responses are often dependent on the reinforcement of a safety signal, and not the aversive conditioned stimuli. This safety signal can be a source of feedback or even stimulus change. Intrinsic feedback or information coming from within, muscle twitches, increased heart rate, are seen to be more important in SSDRs than extrinsic feedback, stimuli that comes from the external environment. Dr. Bolles found that most creatures have some intrinsic set of fears, to help assure survival of the species. Rats will run away from any shocking event, and pigeons will flap their wings harder when threatened. The wing flapping in pigeons and the scattered running of rats are considered species-specific defense reactions or behaviors. Bolles believed that SSDRs are conditioned through Pavlovian conditioning, and not operant conditioning; SSDRs arise from the association between the environmental stimuli and adverse events. Michael S. Fanselow conducted an experiment, to test some specific defense reactions, he observed that rats in two different shock situations responded differently, based on instinct or defensive topography, rather than contextual information.\nSpecies-specific defense responses are created out of fear, and are essential for survival. Rats that lack the gene stathmin show no avoidance learning, or a lack of fear, and will often walk directly up to cats and be eaten. Animals use these SSDRs to continue living, to help increase their chance of fitness, by surviving long enough to procreate. Humans and animals alike have created fear to know what should be avoided, and this fear can be learned through association with others in the community, or learned through personal experience with a creature, species, or situations that should be avoided. SSDRs are an evolutionary adaptation that has been seen in many species throughout the world including rats, chimpanzees, prairie dogs, and even humans, an adaptation created to help individual creatures survive in a hostile world.\nFear learning changes across the lifetime due to natural developmental changes in the brain. This includes changes in the prefrontal cortex and the amygdala.\nThe visual exploration of an emotional face does not follow a fixed pattern but modulated by the emotional content of the face. Scheller et al. found that participants paid more attention to the eyes when recognising fearful or neutral faces, while the mouth was fixated on when happy faces are presented, irrespective of task demands and spatial locations of face stimuli. These findings were replicated when fearful eyes are presented and when canonical face configurations are distorted for fearful, neutral and happy expressions.\nNeurocircuitry in mammals.\nThe brain structures that are the center of most neurobiological events associated with fear are the two amygdalae, located behind the pituitary gland. Each amygdala is part of a circuitry of fear learning. They are essential for proper adaptation to stress and specific modulation of emotional learning memory. In the presence of a threatening stimulus, the amygdalae generate the secretion of hormones that influence fear and aggression. Once a response to the stimulus in the form of fear or aggression commences, the amygdalae may elicit the release of hormones into the body to put the person into a state of alertness, in which they are ready to move, run, fight, etc. This defensive response is generally referred to in physiology as the fight-or-flight response regulated by the hypothalamus, part of the limbic system. Once the person is in safe mode, meaning that there are no longer any potential threats surrounding them, the amygdalae will send this information to the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) where it is stored for similar future situations, which is known as memory consolidation.\nSome of the hormones involved during the state of fight-or-flight include epinephrine, which regulates heart rate and metabolism as well as dilating blood vessels and air passages, norepinephrine increasing heart rate, blood flow to skeletal muscles and the release of glucose from energy stores, and cortisol which increases blood sugar, increases circulating neutrophilic leukocytes, calcium amongst other things.\nAfter a situation which incites fear occurs, the amygdalae and hippocampus record the event through synaptic plasticity. The stimulation to the hippocampus will cause the individual to remember many details surrounding the situation. Plasticity and memory formation in the amygdala are generated by activation of the neurons in the region. Experimental data supports the notion that synaptic plasticity of the neurons leading to the lateral amygdalae occurs with fear conditioning. In some cases, this forms permanent fear responses such as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) or a phobia. MRI and fMRI scans have shown that the amygdalae in individuals diagnosed with such disorders including bipolar or panic disorder are larger and wired for a higher level of fear.\nPathogens can suppress amygdala activity. Rats infected with the toxoplasmosis parasite become less fearful of cats, sometimes even seeking out their urine-marked areas. This behavior often leads to them being eaten by cats. The parasite then reproduces within the body of the cat. There is evidence that the parasite concentrates itself in the amygdala of infected rats. In a separate experiment, rats with lesions in the amygdala did not express fear or anxiety towards unwanted stimuli. These rats pulled on levers supplying food that sometimes sent out electrical shocks. While they learned to avoid pressing on them, they did not distance themselves from these shock-inducing levers.\nSeveral brain structures other than the amygdalae have also been observed to be activated when individuals are presented with fearful vs. neutral faces, namely the occipitocerebellar regions including the fusiform gyrus and the inferior parietal / superior temporal gyri. Fearful eyes, brows and mouth seem to separately reproduce these brain responses. Scientists from Zurich studies show that the hormone oxytocin related to stress and sex reduces activity in your brain fear center.\nPheromones and contagion.\nIn threatening situations, insects, aquatic organisms, birds, reptiles, and mammals emit odorant substances, initially called alarm substances, which are chemical signals now called alarm pheromones. This is to defend themselves and at the same time to inform members of the same species of danger and leads to observable behavior change like freezing, defensive behavior, or dispersion depending on circumstances and species. For example, stressed rats release odorant cues that cause other rats to move away from the source of the signal.\nAfter the discovery of pheromones in 1959, alarm pheromones were first described in 1968 in ants and earthworms, and four years later also found in mammals, both mice and rats. Over the next two decades, identification and characterization of these pheromones proceeded in all manner of insects and sea animals, including fish, but it was not until 1990 that more insight into mammalian alarm pheromones was gleaned.\nIn 1985, a link between odors released by stressed rats and pain perception was discovered: unstressed rats exposed to these odors developed opioid-mediated analgesia. In 1997, researchers found that bees became less responsive to pain after they had been stimulated with isoamyl acetate, a chemical smelling of banana, and a component of bee alarm pheromone. The experiment also showed that the bees' fear-induced pain tolerance was mediated by an endorphin.\nBy using the forced swimming test in rats as a model of fear-induction, the first mammalian \"alarm substance\" was found. In 1991, this \"alarm substance\" was shown to fulfill criteria for pheromones: well-defined behavioral effect, species specificity, minimal influence of experience and control for nonspecific arousal. Rat activity testing with the alarm pheromone, and their preference/avoidance for odors from cylinders containing the pheromone, showed that the pheromone had very low volatility.\nIn 1993 a connection between alarm chemosignals in mice and their immune response was found. Pheromone production in mice was found to be associated with or mediated by the pituitary gland in 1994.\nIn 2004, it was demonstrated that rats' alarm pheromones had different effects on the \"recipient\" rat (the rat perceiving the pheromone) depending which body region they were released from: Pheromone production from the face modified behavior in the recipient rat, e.g. caused sniffing or movement, whereas pheromone secreted from the rat's anal area induced autonomic nervous system stress responses, like an increase in core body temperature. Further experiments showed that when a rat perceived alarm pheromones, it increased its defensive and risk assessment behavior, and its acoustic startle reflex was enhanced.\nIt was not until 2011 that a link between severe pain, neuroinflammation and alarm pheromones release in rats was found: real time RT-PCR analysis of rat brain tissues indicated that shocking the footpad of a rat increased its production of proinflammatory cytokines in deep brain structures, namely of IL-1\u03b2, heteronuclear Corticotropin-releasing hormone and c-fos mRNA expressions in both the paraventricular nucleus and the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, and it increased stress hormone levels in plasma (corticosterone).\nThe neurocircuit for how rats perceive alarm pheromones was shown to be related to the hypothalamus, brainstem, and amygdalae, all of which are evolutionary ancient structures deep inside or in the case of the brainstem underneath the brain away from the cortex, and involved in the fight-or-flight response, as is the case in humans.\nAlarm pheromone-induced anxiety in rats has been used to evaluate the degree to which anxiolytics can alleviate anxiety in humans. For this, the change in the acoustic startle reflex of rats with alarm pheromone-induced anxiety (i.e. reduction of defensiveness) has been measured. Pretreatment of rats with one of five anxiolytics used in clinical medicine was able to reduce their anxiety: namely midazolam, phenelzine (a nonselective monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitor), propranolol, a nonselective beta blocker, clonidine, an alpha 2 adrenergic agonist or CP-154,526, a corticotropin-releasing hormone antagonist.\nFaulty development of odor discrimination impairs the perception of pheromones and pheromone-related behavior, like aggressive behavior and mating in male rats: The enzyme Mitogen-activated protein kinase 7 (MAPK7) has been implicated in regulating the development of the olfactory bulb and odor discrimination and it is highly expressed in developing rat brains, but absent in most regions of adult rat brains. Conditional deletion of the MAPK7gene in mouse neural stem cells impairs several pheromone-mediated behaviors, including aggression and mating in male mice. These behavior impairments were not caused by a reduction in the level of testosterone, by physical immobility, by heightened fear or anxiety or by depression. Using mouse urine as a natural pheromone-containing solution, it has been shown that the impairment was associated with defective detection of related pheromones, and with changes in their inborn preference for pheromones related to sexual and reproductive activities.\nLastly, alleviation of an acute fear response because a friendly peer (or in biological language: an affiliative conspecific) tends and befriends is called \"social buffering\". The term is in analogy to the 1985 \"buffering\" hypothesis in psychology, where social support has been proven to mitigate the negative health effects of alarm pheromone mediated distress. The role of a \"social pheromone\" is suggested by the recent discovery that olfactory signals are responsible in mediating the \"social buffering\" in male rats. \"Social buffering\" was also observed to mitigate the conditioned fear responses of honeybees. A bee colony exposed to an environment of high threat of predation did not show increased aggression and aggressive-like gene expression patterns in individual bees, but decreased aggression. That the bees did not simply habituate to threats is suggested by the fact that the disturbed colonies also decreased their foraging.\nBiologists have proposed in 2012 that fear pheromones evolved as molecules of \"keystone significance\", a term coined in analogy to keystone species. Pheromones may determine species compositions and affect rates of energy and material exchange in an ecological community. Thus pheromones generate structure in a food web and play critical roles in maintaining natural systems.\nHumans.\nEvidence of chemosensory alarm signals in humans has emerged slowly: Although alarm pheromones have not been physically isolated and their chemical structures have not been identified in humans so far, there is evidence for their presence. Androstadienone, for example, a steroidal, endogenous odorant, is a pheromone candidate found in human sweat, axillary hair and plasma. The closely related compound androstenone is involved in communicating dominance, aggression or competition; sex hormone influences on androstenone perception in humans showed a high testosterone level related to heightened androstenone sensitivity in men, a high testosterone level related to unhappiness in response to androstenone in men, and a high estradiol level related to disliking of androstenone in women.\nA German study from 2006 showed when anxiety-induced versus exercise-induced human sweat from a dozen people was pooled and offered to seven study participants, of five able to olfactorily distinguish exercise-induced sweat from room air, three could also distinguish exercise-induced sweat from anxiety induced sweat. The acoustic startle reflex response to a sound when sensing anxiety sweat was larger than when sensing exercise-induced sweat, as measured by electromyography analysis of the orbital muscle, which is responsible for the eyeblink component. This showed for the first time that fear chemosignals can modulate the startle reflex in humans without emotional mediation; fear chemosignals primed the recipient's \"defensive behavior\" prior to the subjects' conscious attention on the acoustic startle reflex level.\nIn analogy to the social buffering of rats and honeybees in response to chemosignals, induction of empathy by \"smelling anxiety\" of another person has been found in humans.\nA study from 2013 provided brain imaging evidence that human responses to fear chemosignals may be gender-specific. Researchers collected alarm-induced sweat and exercise-induced sweat from donors extracted it, pooled it and presented it to 16 unrelated people undergoing functional brain MRI. While stress-induced sweat from males produced a comparably strong emotional response in both females and males, stress-induced sweat from females produced markedly stronger arousal in women than in men. Statistical tests pinpointed this gender-specificity to the right amygdala and strongest in the superficial nuclei. Since no significant differences were found in the olfactory bulb, the response to female fear-induced signals is likely based on processing the meaning, i.e. on the emotional level, rather than the strength of chemosensory cues from each gender, i.e. the perceptual level.\nAn approach-avoidance task was set up where volunteers seeing either an angry or a happy cartoon face on a computer screen pushed away or pulled toward them a joystick as fast as possible. Volunteers smelling androstadienone, masked with clove oil scent responded faster, especially to angry faces than those smelling clove oil only, which was interpreted as androstadienone-related activation of the fear system. A potential mechanism of action is, that androstadienone alters the \"emotional face processing\". Androstadienone is known to influence the activity of the fusiform gyrus which is relevant for face recognition.\nCognitive-consistency theory.\nCognitive-consistency theories assume that \"when two or more simultaneously active cognitive structures are logically inconsistent, arousal is increased, which activates processes with the expected consequence of increasing consistency and decreasing arousal.\" In this context, it has been proposed that fear behavior is caused by an inconsistency between a preferred, or expected, situation and the actually perceived situation, and functions to remove the inconsistent stimulus from the perceptual field, for instance by fleeing or hiding, thereby resolving the inconsistency. This approach puts fear in a broader perspective, also involving aggression and curiosity. When the inconsistency between perception and expectancy is small, learning as a result of curiosity reduces inconsistency by updating expectancy to match perception. If the inconsistency is larger, fear or aggressive behavior may be employed to alter the perception in order to make it match expectancy, depending on the size of the inconsistency as well as the specific context. Aggressive behavior is assumed to alter perception by forcefully manipulating it into matching the expected situation, while in some cases thwarted escape may also trigger aggressive behavior in an attempt to remove the thwarting stimulus.\nResearch.\nIn order to improve our understanding of the neural and behavioral mechanisms of adaptive and maladaptive fear, investigators use a variety of translational animal models. These models are particularly important for research that would be too invasive for human studies. Rodents such as mice and rats are common animal models, but other species are used. Certain aspects of fear research still requires more research such as sex, gender, and age differences.\nModels.\nThese animal models include, but are not limited to, fear conditioning, predator-based psychosocial stress, single prolonged stress, chronic stress models, inescapable foot/tail shocks, immobilization or restraint, and stress enhanced fear learning. While the stress and fear paradigms differ between the models, they tend to involve aspects such as acquisition, generalization, extinction, cognitive regulation, and reconsolidation.\nPavlovian.\nFear conditioning, also known as Pavlovian or classical conditioning, is a process of learning that involves pairing a neutral stimulus with an unconditional stimulus (US). A neutral stimulus is something like a bell, tone, or room that does not elicit a response normally where a US is a stimulus that results in a natural or unconditioned response (UR) \u2013 in Pavlov's famous experiment the neutral stimulus is a bell and the US would be food with the dog's salvation being the UR. Pairing the neutral stimulus and the US results in the UR occurring not only with the US but also the neutral stimulus. When this occurs the neutral stimulus is referred to as the conditional stimulus (CS) and the response the conditional response (CR). In the fear conditioning model of Pavlovian conditioning the US is an aversive stimulus such as a shock, tone, or unpleasant odor.\nPredator-based psychosocial stress.\nPredator-based psychosocial stress (PPS) involves a more naturalistic approach to fear learning. Predators such as a cat, a snake, or urine from a fox or cat are used along with other stressors such as immobilization or restraint in order to generate instinctual fear responses.\nChronic stress models.\nChronic stress models include chronic variable stress, chronic social defeat, and chronic mild stress. These models are often used to study how long-term or prolonged stress/pain can alter fear learning and disorders.\nSingle prolonged stress.\nSingle prolonged stress (SPS) is a fear model that is often used to study PTSD. Its paradigm involves multiple stressors such as immobilization, a force swim, and exposure to ether delivered concurrently to the subject. This is used to study non-naturalistic, uncontrollable situations that can cause a maladaptive fear responses that is seen in a lot of anxiety and traumatic based disorders.\nStress enhanced fear learning.\nStress enhanced fear learning (SEFL) like SPS is often used to study the maladaptive fear learning involved in PTSD and other traumatic based disorders. SEFL involves a single extreme stressor such as a large number of footshocks simulating a single traumatic stressor that somehow enhances and alters future fear learning.\nManagement.\nPharmaceutical.\nA drug treatment for fear conditioning and phobias via the amygdalae is the use of glucocorticoids. In one study, glucocorticoid receptors in the central nuclei of the amygdalae were disrupted in order to better understand the mechanisms of fear and fear conditioning. The glucocorticoid receptors were inhibited using lentiviral vectors containing Cre-recombinase injected into mice. Results showed that disruption of the glucocorticoid receptors prevented conditioned fear behavior. The mice were subjected to auditory cues which caused them to freeze normally. A reduction of freezing was observed in the mice that had inhibited glucocorticoid receptors.\nPsychological.\nCognitive behavioral therapy has been successful in helping people overcome their fear. Because fear is more complex than just forgetting or deleting memories, an active and successful approach involves people repeatedly confronting their fears. By confronting their fears in a safe manner a person can suppress the \"fear-triggering memories\" or stimuli.\nExposure therapy has known to have helped up to 90% of people with specific phobias to significantly decrease their fear over time.\nAnother psychological treatment is systematic desensitization, which is a type of behavior therapy used to completely remove the fear or produce a disgusted response to this fear and replace it. The replacement that occurs will be relaxation and will occur through conditioning. Through conditioning treatments, muscle tensioning will lessen and deep breathing techniques will aid in de-tensioning.\nLiterary and religious.\nThere are other methods for treating or coping with one's fear, such as writing down rational thoughts regarding fears. Journal entries are a healthy method of expressing one's fears without compromising safety or causing uncertainty. Another suggestion is a fear ladder. To create a fear ladder, one must write down all of their fears and score them on a scale of one to ten. Next, the person addresses their phobia, starting with the lowest number.\nReligion can help some individuals cope with fear.\nIncapability.\nPeople who have damage to their amygdalae, which can be caused by a rare genetic disease known as Urbach\u2013Wiethe disease, are unable to experience fear. The disease destroys both amygdalae in late childhood. Since the discovery of the disease, there have only been 400 recorded cases. A lack of fear can allow someone to get into a dangerous situation they otherwise would have avoided.\nSociety and culture.\nDeath.\nThe fear of the end of life and its existence is, in other words, the fear of death. Historically, attempts were made to reduce this fear by performing rituals which have helped collect the cultural ideas that we now have in the present. These rituals also helped preserve the cultural ideas. The results and methods of human existence had been changing at the same time that social formation was changing.\nWhen people are faced with their own thoughts of death, they either accept that they are dying or will die because they have lived a full life or they will experience fear. A theory was developed in response to this, which is called the terror management theory. The theory states that a person's cultural worldviews (religion, values, etc.) will mitigate the terror associated with the fear of death through avoidance. To help manage their terror, they find solace in their death-denying beliefs, such as their religion. Another way people cope with their death related fears is pushing any thoughts of death into the future or by avoiding these thoughts all together through distractions. Although there are methods for one coping with the terror associated with their fear of death, not everyone suffers from these same uncertainties. People who believe they have lived life to the \"fullest\" typically do not fear death.\nDeath anxiety is multidimensional; it covers \"fears related to one's own death, the death of others, fear of the unknown after death, fear of obliteration, and fear of the dying process, which includes fear of a slow death and a painful death\".\nThe Yale philosopher Shelly Kagan examined fear of death in a 2007 Yale open course by examining the following questions: Is fear of death a reasonable appropriate response? What conditions are required and what are appropriate conditions for feeling fear of death? What is meant by fear, and how much fear is appropriate? According to Kagan for fear in general to make sense, three conditions should be met:\nThe amount of fear should be appropriate to the size of \"the bad\". If the three conditions are not met, fear is an inappropriate emotion. He argues, that death does not meet the first two criteria, even if death is a \"deprivation of good things\" and even if one believes in a painful afterlife. Because death is certain, it also does not meet the third criterion, but he grants that the unpredictability of when one dies \"may\" be cause to a sense of fear.\nIn a 2003 study of 167 women and 121 men, aged 65\u201387, low self-efficacy predicted fear of the unknown after death and fear of dying for women and men better than demographics, social support, and physical health. Fear of death was measured by a \"Multidimensional Fear of Death Scale\" which included the 8 subscales Fear of Dying, Fear of the Dead, Fear of Being Destroyed, Fear for Significant Others, Fear of the Unknown, Fear of Conscious Death, Fear for the Body After Death, and Fear of Premature Death. In hierarchical multiple regression analysis, the most potent predictors of death fears were low \"spiritual health efficacy\", defined as beliefs relating to one's perceived ability to generate spiritually based faith and inner strength, and low \"instrumental efficacy\", defined as beliefs relating to one's perceived ability to manage activities of daily living.\nPsychologists have tested the hypotheses that fear of death motivates religious commitment, and that assurances about an afterlife alleviate the fear, with equivocal results. Religiosity can be related to fear of death when the afterlife is portrayed as time of punishment. \"Intrinsic religiosity\", as opposed to mere \"formal religious involvement\", has been found to be negatively correlated with death anxiety. In a 1976 study of people of various Christian denominations, those who were most firm in their faith, who attended religious services weekly, were the least afraid of dying. The survey found a negative correlation between fear of death and \"religious concern\".\nIn a 2006 study of white, Christian men and women the hypothesis was tested that traditional, church-centered religiousness and de-institutionalized spiritual seeking are ways of approaching fear of death in old age. Both religiousness and spirituality were related to positive psychosocial functioning, but only church-centered religiousness protected subjects against the fear of death.\nReligion.\nStatius in the \"Thebaid\" (Book 3, line 661) aired the irreverent suggestion that \"fear first made gods in the world\".\nFrom a Christian theological perspective, the word \"fear\" can encompass more than simple dread. Robert B. Strimple says that fear includes the \"... convergence of awe, reverence, adoration, humility..\". Some translations of the Bible, such as the New International Version, sometimes express the concept of \"fear\" with the word \"reverence\".\nA similar phrase, \"God-fearing\", is sometimes used as a rough synonym for \"pious\". It is a standard translation for the Arabic word taqwa (; \"forbearance, restraint\") in Muslim contexts. In Judaism, \"fear of God\" describes obedience to Jewish law even when invisible to others.\nManipulation.\nFear may be politically and culturally manipulated to persuade citizenry of ideas which would otherwise be widely rejected or dissuade citizenry from ideas which would otherwise be widely supported. In contexts of disasters, nation-states manage the fear not only to provide their citizens with an explanation about the event or blaming some minorities, but also to adjust their previous beliefs.\nFear can alter how a person thinks or reacts to situations because fear has the power to inhibit one's rational way of thinking. As a result, people who do not experience fear, are able to use fear as a tool to manipulate others. People who are experiencing fear, seek preservation through safety and can be manipulated by a person who is there to provide that safety that is being sought after. \"When we're afraid, a manipulator can talk us out of the truth we see right in front of us. Words become more real than reality\" By this, a manipulator can use our fear to manipulate us out the truth and instead make us believe and trust in their truth. Politicians are notorious for using fear to manipulate the people into supporting their policies. This strategy taps into primal human emotions, leveraging fear of the unknown, external threats, or perceived dangers to influence decision-making.\nFiction and mythology.\nFear is found and reflected in mythology and folklore as well as in works of fiction such as novels and films.\nWorks of dystopian and (post)apocalyptic fiction convey the fears and anxieties of societies.\nThe fear of the world's end is about as old as civilization itself. In a 1967 study, Frank Kermode suggests that the failure of religious prophecies led to a shift in how society apprehends this ancient mode. Scientific and critical thought supplanting religious and mythical thought as well as a public emancipation may be the cause of eschatology becoming replaced by more realistic scenarios. Such might constructively provoke discussion and steps to be taken to prevent depicted catastrophes.\n\"The Story of the Youth Who Went Forth to Learn What Fear Was\" is a German fairy tale dealing with the topic of not knowing fear.\nMany stories also include characters who fear the antagonist of the plot. One important characteristic of historical and mythical heroes across cultures is to be fearless in the face of big and often lethal enemies.\n\"The Magnus Archives\" is a fiction horror podcast written by Jonathan Sims and directed by Alexander J. Newall that, among other things, formulates an archetypal ontology of fear through the dissemination of case files at a paranormal research institute set in a world where the metaphysical basis of paranormal activity and unexplainable horrors is fear incarnate. The diegesis states that true categorization of fear is impossible, that fear is all one unknowable thing; however, there exists an ontological structure of fear archetypes in this universe proposed by a fictional version of the architect Robert Smirke. It is a unique construction of fear in that it is not based on the science or neurology of fear, but on thematic and experiential connections between different phobias. For example, the fear of disease and vermin comes from the same place as the fear of abusive relationships, as both lie in fearing corruptions to the self. The final season of the podcast consists almost entirely of poetic meditations on the nature of fear.\nFear in art has been explored by the Japanese scholar Kyoko Nakano, in a series of books and a 2017 exhibition about \"kowai-e\" (lit. scary pictures).\nAthletics.\nIn the world of athletics, fear is often used as a means of motivation to not fail. This situation involves using fear in a way that increases the chances of a positive outcome. In this case, the fear that is being created is initially a cognitive state to the receiver. This initial state is what generates the first response of the athlete, this response generates a possibility of fight or flight reaction by the athlete (receiver), which in turn will increase or decrease the possibility of success or failure in the certain situation for the athlete. The amount of time that the athlete has to determine this decision is small but it is still enough time for the receiver to make a determination through cognition. Even though the decision is made quickly, the decision is determined through past events that have been experienced by the athlete. The results of these past events will determine how the athlete will make his cognitive decision in the split second that he or she has.\nFear of failure as described above has been studied frequently in the field of sport psychology. Many scholars have tried to determine how often fear of failure is triggered within athletes, as well as what personalities of athletes most often choose to use this type of motivation. Studies have also been conducted to determine the success rate of this method of motivation.\nMurray's Exploration in Personal (1938) was one of the first studies that actually identified fear of failure as an actual motive to avoid failure or to achieve success. His studies suggested that inavoidance, the need to avoid failure, was found in many college-aged men during the time of his research in 1938. This was a monumental finding in the field of psychology because it allowed other researchers to better clarify how fear of failure can actually be a determinant of creating achievement goals as well as how it could be used in the actual act of achievement.\nIn the context of sport, a model was created by R.S. Lazarus in 1991 that uses the cognitive-motivational-relational theory of emotion. \n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nAnother study was done in 2001 by Conroy, Poczwardowski, and Henschen that created five aversive consequences of failing that have been repeated over time. The five categories include (a) experiencing shame and embarrassment, (b) devaluing one's self-estimate, (c) having an uncertain future, (d) important others losing interest, (e) upsetting important others. These five categories can help one infer the possibility of an individual to associate failure with one of these threat categories, which will lead them to experiencing fear of failure.\nIn summary, the two studies that were done above created a more precise definition of fear of failure, which is \"a dispositional tendency to experience apprehension and anxiety in evaluative situations because individuals have learned that failure is associated with aversive consequences\".\nThe author and internet content creator John Green wrote about \"the yips\"\u2014a common colloquialism for a debilitating, often chronic manifestation of athletic anxiety experienced by some professional athletes\u2014in an essay for his podcast and novel \"The Anthropocene Reviewed\". Green discusses famous examples of when athletic anxiety has ruined careers and juxtaposes it with the nature of general anxiety as a whole. Green settles, however, on a conclusion for the essay evoking resilience and hope in the human condition by describing a circumstance where the baseball player Rick Ankiel reset his career back to the minor leagues as an outfielder after getting the yips as a major league pitcher.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Such teams could be selected to play in a match against an opposing team, to represent a football club, group, state or nation, an all-star team or even selected as a hypothetical team (such as a dream team or team of the century) and never play an actual match.\nThe difference between a football team and a football club is incorporation, a football club is an entity which is formed and governed by a committee and has members which may consist of supporters in addition to players. The benefit of club formation is that it gives teams access to additional volunteer or paid support staff, facilities and equipment. \nSummary.\nThere are several varieties of football, including association football, gridiron football, Australian rules football, Gaelic football, rugby league and rugby union. The number of players selected for each team, within these varieties and their associated codes, can vary substantially. Sometimes, the word \"team\" may be limited to those who play on the field in a match and does not always include other players who may take part as replacements or emergency players. \"Football squad\" may be used to be inclusive of these support and reserve players.\nThe words team and club are sometimes used interchangeably by supporters, typically referring to the team within the club playing in the highest division or competition. A football club is a type of sports club which is an organized or incorporated body. Typically these will have a committee, secretary, president, or chairperson, registrar and members. Football clubs typically have a set of rules, including rules under which they play and are themselves typically members of a league or association which are affiliated with a governing body within their sport. Clubs may field multiple teams from their registered players (which may participate in several different divisions or leagues). A club is responsible for ensuring the continued existence of its teams in their respective competitions. The oldest football clubs date back to the early 19th century. While records exist for most incorporated clubs, they do not exist for all football clubs. Standalone clubs are usually run like businesses and appear on official registers. However many football clubs were formed as part of larger organisations (schools, athletic clubs, societies) and therefore public records of their formation and operation may not be kept unless they compete with other teams. Football clubs may also be dormant for periods and be re-formed (for example going into recess for reasons such as war or lack of a league or competition to participate in) and even switch between football codes. Likewise, a football club may fold if it becomes insolvent or is incapable of fielding a team to play matches.\nVariation of player numbers among football codes.\nThe number of players that take part in the sport simultaneously, thus forming the team are:\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Its name in English is \"ef\" (pronounced ), and the plural is \"efs\".\nHistory.\nThe origin of \u27e8F\u27e9 is the Semitic letter \"waw\", which represented a sound like or . It probably originally depicted either a hook or a club. It may have been based on a comparable Egyptian hieroglyph such as (transliterated as \u1e25(dj)): T3\nThe Phoenician form of the letter was adopted into Greek as a vowel, \"upsilon\" (which resembled its descendant \u27e8Y\u27e9 but was also the ancestor of the Roman letters \u27e8U\u27e9, \u27e8V\u27e9, and \u27e8W\u27e9); and, with another form, as a consonant, \"digamma\", which indicated the pronunciation , as in Phoenician. Latin \u27e8F\u27e9, despite being pronounced differently, is ultimately descended from digamma and closely resembles it in form.\nAfter sound changes eliminated from most dialects of Greek (Doric Greek retained it), \"digamma\" was used only as a numeral. However, the Greek alphabet also gave rise to other alphabets, and some of these retained letters descended from digamma. In the Etruscan alphabet, \u27e8F\u27e9 probably represented , as in Greek, and the Etruscans formed the digraph \u27e8FH\u27e9 to represent . (At the time these letters were borrowed, there was no Greek letter that represented /f/: the Greek letter phi \u27e8\u03a6\u27e9 then represented an aspirated voiceless bilabial plosive , although in Modern Greek it has come to represent .) The Etruscan digraph may have been inspired by the rare use of \u27e8\u03dc\u0397\u27e9 in archaic Greek inscriptions for a dialectal sound like , e.g. in the reflexive pronoun \u03dc\u0397\u0395, which corresponds to Classical \u1f15 \"h\u00e9\" (see ).\nWhen the Romans adopted the alphabet, they used \u27e8V\u27e9 (from Greek \"upsilon\") not only for the vowel , but also for the corresponding semivowel , leaving \u27e8F\u27e9 available for . Initially, \u27e8FH\u27e9 was also used for this sound in Latin, but the \u27e8H\u27e9 was soon dropped. And so out of the various \"vav\" variants in the Mediterranean world, the letter F entered the Roman alphabet attached to a sound which the Greeks did not have. The Roman alphabet forms the basis of the alphabet used today for English and many other languages.\nThe lowercase \u27e8f\u27e9 is not related to the visually similar long s, \u27e8\u017f\u27e9 (or medial s). The use of the \"long s\" largely died out by the beginning of the 19th century, mostly to prevent confusion with \u27e8f\u27e9 when using a short mid-bar.\nUse in writing systems.\nEnglish.\nIn the English writing system \u27e8f\u27e9 is used to represent the sound , the voiceless labiodental fricative. It is often doubled at the end of words. Exceptionally, it represents the voiced labiodental fricative in the common word \"of\" and its derivatives.\nF is the eleventh least frequently used letter in the English language (after G, Y, P, B, V, K, J, X, Q, and Z), with a frequency of about 2.23% in words.\nOther languages.\nIn the writing systems of other languages, \u27e8f\u27e9 commonly represents , or .\nOther systems.\nThe International Phonetic Alphabet uses \u27e8\u27e9 to represent the voiceless labiodental fricative.\nOther representations.\nComputing.\nThese are the code points for the forms of the letter in various systems:\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

This slows down the decomposition and rancidification process. Food preservation may also include processes that inhibit visual deterioration, such as the enzymatic browning reaction in apples after they are cut during food preparation. By preserving food, food waste can be reduced, which is an important way to decrease production costs and increase the efficiency of food systems, improve food security and nutrition and contribute towards environmental sustainability. For instance, it can reduce the environmental impact of food production.\nMany processes designed to preserve food involve more than one food preservation method. Preserving fruit by turning it into jam, for example, involves boiling (to reduce the fruit's moisture content and to kill bacteria, etc.), sugaring (to prevent their re-growth) and sealing within an airtight jar (to prevent recontamination).\nDifferent food preservation methods have different impacts on the quality of the food and food systems. Some traditional methods of preserving food have been shown to have a lower energy input and carbon footprint compared to modern methods. Some methods of food preservation are also known to create carcinogens.\nTraditional techniques.\nSome techniques of food preservation pre-date the dawn of agriculture. Others were discovered more recently.\nBoiling.\nBoiling liquids can kill any existing microbes. Milk and water are often boiled to kill any harmful microbes that may be present in them.\nBurial.\nBurial of food can preserve it due to a variety of factors: lack of light, lack of oxygen, cool temperatures, pH level, or desiccants in the soil. Burial may be combined with other methods such as salting or fermentation. Most foods can be preserved in soil that is very dry and salty (thus a desiccant) such as sand, or soil that is frozen.\nMany root vegetables are very resistant to spoilage and require no other preservation than storage in cool dark conditions, for example by burial in the ground, such as in a storage clamp (not to be confused with a root cellar). Cabbage was traditionally buried during autumn in northern US farms for preservation. Some methods keep it crispy while other methods produce sauerkraut. A similar process is used in the traditional production of kimchi.\nSometimes meat is buried under conditions that cause preservation. If buried on hot coals or ashes, the heat can kill pathogens, the dry ash can desiccate, and the earth can block oxygen and further contamination. If buried where the earth is very cold, the earth acts like a refrigerator, or, in areas of permafrost, a freezer.\nIn Odisha, India, it is practical to store rice by burying it underground. This method helps to store for three to six months during the dry season.\nButter and similar substances have been preserved as bog butter in Irish peat bogs for centuries. Century eggs are traditionally created by placing eggs in alkaline mud (or other alkaline substance), resulting in their \"inorganic\" fermentation through raised pH instead of spoiling. The fermentation preserves them and breaks down some of the complex, less flavorful proteins and fats into simpler, more flavorful ones.\nCanning.\nCanning involves cooking food, sealing it in sterilized cans or jars, and boiling the containers to kill or weaken any remaining bacteria as a form of sterilization. It was invented by the French confectioner Nicolas Appert. By 1806, this process was used by the French Navy to preserve meat, fruit, vegetables, and even milk. Although Appert had discovered a new way of preservation, it was not understood until 1864 when Louis Pasteur found the relationship between microorganisms, food spoilage, and illness.\nFoods have varying degrees of natural protection against spoilage and may require that the final step occurs in a pressure cooker. High-acid fruits like strawberries require no preservatives to can and only a short boiling cycle, whereas marginal vegetables such as carrots require longer boiling and the addition of other acidic elements. Low-acid foods, such as vegetables and meats, require pressure canning. Food preserved by canning or bottling is at immediate risk of spoilage once the can or bottle has been opened.\nLack of quality control in the canning process may allow ingress of water or micro-organisms. Most such failures are rapidly detected as decomposition within the can cause gas production and the can will swell or burst. However, there have been examples of poor manufacture (underprocessing) and poor hygiene allowing contamination of canned food by the obligate anaerobe \"Clostridium botulinum\", which produces an acute toxin within the food, leading to severe illness or death. This organism produces no gas or obvious taste and remains undetected by taste or smell. Its toxin is denatured by cooking, however. Cooked mushrooms, when handled poorly and then canned, can support the growth of \"Staphylococcus aureus\", which produces a toxin that is not destroyed by canning or subsequent reheating.\nConfit.\nMeat can be preserved by salting it, cooking it at or near in some kind of fat (such as lard or tallow), and then storing it immersed in the fat. These preparations were popular in Europe before refrigerators became ubiquitous. They are still popular in France, where the term originates. The preparation will keep longer if stored in a cold cellar or buried in cold ground.\nCooling.\nCooling preserves food by slowing down the growth and reproduction of microorganisms and the action of enzymes that causes the food to rot. The introduction of commercial and domestic refrigerators drastically improved the diets of many in the Western world by allowing food such as fresh fruit, salads and dairy products to be stored safely for longer periods, particularly during warm weather.\nBefore the era of mechanical refrigeration, cooling for food storage occurred in the forms of root cellars and iceboxes. Rural people often did their own ice cutting, whereas town and city dwellers often relied on the ice trade. Today, root cellaring remains popular among people who value various goals, including local food, heirloom crops, traditional home cooking techniques, family farming, frugality, self-sufficiency, organic farming, and others.\nCuring.\nCuring is any of various food preservation and flavoring processes of foods such as meat, fish and vegetables, by the addition of salt, with the aim of drawing moisture out of the food by the process of osmosis. Because curing increases the solute concentration in the food and hence decreases its water potential, the food becomes inhospitable for the microbial growth that causes food spoilage. Smoking and salting techniques improve on the drying process and add antimicrobial agents that aid in preservation. Smoke deposits a number of pyrolysis products onto the food, including the phenols syringol, guaiacol and catechol. Salt accelerates the drying process using osmosis and also inhibits the growth of several common strains of bacteria. More recently nitrites have been used to cure meat, contributing a characteristic pink colour.\nIn 2015, the International Agency for Research on Cancer of the World Health Organization classified processed meat\u2014i.e., meat that has undergone salting, curing, and smoking\u2014as \"carcinogenic to humans\".\nDrying.\nThe earliest form of curing is drying, which has been in use since ancient times, the earliest known practice dates back to 12,000 B.C. by inhabitants of the modern Asian and Middle Eastern regions. Water is traditionally removed through evaporation by using methods such as air drying, sun drying, smoking or wind drying, although today electric food dehydrators can be used to speed the drying process and ensure more consistent results.\nFermentation.\nSome foods, such as many cheeses, wines, and beers, are prepared by fermentation. This involves cultivating specific microorganisms to combat spoilage from other, less benign organisms. These microorganisms keep pathogens in check by producing acid or alcohol, which eventually creates an environment toxic for themselves and other microorganisms.\nMethods of fermentation include, but are not limited to, starter microorganisms, salt, hops, controlled (usually cool) temperatures and controlled (usually low) levels of oxygen. These methods are used to create the specific controlled conditions that will support the desirable organisms that produce food fit for human consumption. Fermentation is the microbial conversion of starch and sugars into alcohol. Not only can fermentation produce alcohol, but it can also be a valuable preservation technique. Fermentation can also make foods more nutritious and palatable.\nWater was also turned into alcoholic beverages through fermentation. When water is used to make beer, the boiling during the brewing process may kill bacteria that could make people sick. The barley and other ingredients also infuse the drink with nutrients, and the microorganisms can also produce vitamins as they ferment. However, the common belief that premodern people avoided drinking ordinary water is a myth. While people avoided drinking dirty or polluted water, they also avoided using it for the production of beer and wine. Water was visually inspected, smelled, tasted, filtered, and boiled if necessary. It was used for drinking as well as for diluting wine, cooking, and many other processes.\nFreezing.\nFreezing is also one of the most commonly used processes, both commercially and domestically, for preserving a very wide range of foods, including prepared foods that would not have required freezing in their unprepared state. For example, potato waffles are stored in the freezer, but potatoes themselves require only a cool dark place to ensure many months' storage. Cold stores provide large-volume, long-term storage for strategic food stocks held in case of national emergency in many countries.\nHeating.\nHeating to temperatures which are sufficient to kill microorganisms inside the food is a method used with perpetual stews.\nJellying.\nFood may be preserved by cooking in a material that solidifies to form a gel. Such materials include gelatin, agar, maize flour, and arrowroot flour.\nSome animal flesh forms a protein gel when cooked. Eels and elvers, and sipunculid worms, are a delicacy in Xiamen, China, as are jellied eels in the East End of London, where they are eaten with mashed potatoes. British cuisine has a rich tradition of potted meats. Meat off-cuts were, until the 1950s, preserved in aspic, a gel made from gelatin and clarified meat broth. Another form of preservation is setting the cooked food in a container and covering it with a layer of fat. Potted chicken liver can be prepared in this way, and so can potted shrimps, to be served on toast. Calf's foot jelly used to be prepared for invalids.\nJellying is one of the steps in producing traditional p\u00e2t\u00e9s. Many jugged meats (see below) are also jellied.\nAnother type of jellying is fruit preserves, which are preparations of cooked fruits, vegetables and sugar, often stored in glass jam jars and Mason jars. Many varieties of fruit preserves are made globally, including sweet fruit preserves, such as those made from strawberry or apricot, and savory preserves, such as those made from tomatoes or squash. The ingredients used and how they are prepared determine the type of preserves; jams, jellies, and marmalades are all examples of different styles of fruit preserves that vary based upon the fruit used. In English, the word \"preserves\", in plural form, is used to describe all types of jams and jellies.\nJugging.\nMeat can be preserved by jugging. Jugging is the process of stewing the meat (commonly game or fish) in a covered earthenware jug or casserole. The animal to be jugged is usually cut into pieces, placed into a tightly sealed jug with brine or gravy, and stewed. Red wine and/or the animal's own blood is sometimes added to the cooking liquid. Jugging was a popular method of preserving meat up until the middle of the 20th century.\n\"Kangina\".\nIn rural Afghanistan, grapes are preserved in disc-shaped vessels made of mud and straw, called \"kangina\". The vessels, which can preserve fresh grapes for up to 6 months, passively control their internal environments to restrict gas exchange and water loss, prolonging the lives of late-harvested grapes stored within them.\nLye.\nSodium hydroxide (lye) makes food too alkaline for bacterial growth. Lye will saponify fats in the food, which will change its flavor and texture. Lutefisk uses lye in its preparation, as do some olive recipes. Modern recipes for century eggs also call for lye.\nPickling.\nPickling is a method of preserving food in an edible, antimicrobial liquid. Pickling can be broadly classified into two categories: chemical pickling and fermentation pickling.\nIn chemical pickling, the food is placed in an edible liquid that inhibits or kills bacteria and other microorganisms. Typical pickling agents include brine (high in salt), vinegar, alcohol, and vegetable oil. Many chemical pickling processes also involve heating or boiling so that the food being preserved becomes saturated with the pickling agent. Common chemically pickled foods include cucumbers, peppers, corned beef, herring, and eggs, as well as mixed vegetables such as piccalilli.\nIn fermentation pickling, bacteria in the liquid produce organic acids as preservation agents, typically by a process that produces lactic acid through the presence of lactobacillales. Fermented pickles include sauerkraut, nukazuke, kimchi, and surstr\u00f6mming.\nSugaring.\nThe earliest cultures have used sugar as a preservative, and it was commonplace to store fruit in honey. \"Sugar tends to draw water from the microbes (plasmolysis). This process leaves the microbial cells dehydrated, thus killing them. In this way, the food will remain safe from microbial spoilage.\" \nIn northern climates without sufficient sun to dry foods, preserves are made by heating the fruit with sugar. Sugar is used to preserve fruits, either in an antimicrobial syrup with fruit such as apples, pears, peaches, apricots, and plums, or in crystallized form where the preserved material is cooked in sugar to the point of crystallization and the resultant product is then stored dry. The latter method is used for the skins of citrus fruit (candied peel), angelica, and ginger.\nModern industrial techniques.\nTechniques of food preservation were developed in research laboratories for commercial applications.\nAseptic processing.\nAseptic processing works by placing sterilized food (typically by heat, see ultra-high temperature processing) into sterilized packaging material under sterile conditions. The result is a sealed, sterile food product similar to canned food, but depending on the technique used, damage to food quality is typically reduced compared to canned food. A greater variety of packaging materials can be used as well.\nBesides UHT, aseptic processing may be used in conjunction with any of the microbe-reduction technologies listed below. With pasteurization and \"high pressure pasteurization\", the food may not be completely sterilized (instead achieving a specified log reduction), but the use of sterile packaging and environments is retained.\nPasteurization.\nPasteurization is a process for preservation of liquid food. It was originally applied to combat the souring of young local wines. Today, the process is mainly applied to dairy products. In this method, milk is heated at about for 15\u201330 seconds to kill the bacteria present in it and cooling it quickly to to prevent the remaining bacteria from growing. The milk is then stored in sterilized bottles or pouches in cold places. This method was invented by Louis Pasteur, a French chemist, in 1862.\nVacuum packing.\nVacuum-packing stores food in a vacuum environment, usually in an air-tight bag or bottle. The vacuum environment strips bacteria of oxygen needed for survival. Vacuum-packing is commonly used for storing nuts to reduce loss of flavor from oxidization. A major drawback to vacuum packaging, at the consumer level, is that vacuum sealing can deform contents and rob certain foods, such as cheese, of its flavor.\nPreservatives.\nPreservative food additives can be \"antimicrobial\" \u2013 which inhibit the growth of bacteria or fungi, including mold \u2013 or \"antioxidant\", such as oxygen absorbers, which inhibit the oxidation of food constituents. Common antimicrobial preservatives include nisin, sorbates, calcium propionate, sodium nitrate/nitrite, sulfites (sulfur dioxide, sodium bisulfite, potassium hydrogen sulfite, etc.), EDTA, hinokitiol, and \u03b5-polylysine. Antioxidants include tocopherols (Vitamin E), butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA) and butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT). Other preservatives include ethanol.\nThere is also another approach of impregnating packaging materials (plastic films or other) with antioxidants and antimicrobials.\nIrradiation.\nIrradiation of food is the exposure of food to ionizing radiation. Multiple types of ionizing radiation can be used, including beta particles (high-energy electrons) and gamma rays (emitted from radioactive sources such as cobalt-60 or cesium-137). Irradiation can kill bacteria, molds, and insect pests, reduce the ripening and spoiling of fruits, and at higher doses induce sterility. The technology may be compared to pasteurization; it is sometimes called \"cold pasteurization\", as the product is not heated. Irradiation may allow lower-quality or contaminated foods to be rendered marketable.\nNational and international expert bodies have declared food irradiation as \"wholesome\"; organizations of the United Nations, such as the World Health Organization and Food and Agriculture Organization, endorse food irradiation. Consumers may have a negative view of irradiated food based on the misconception that such food is radioactive; in fact, irradiated food does not and cannot become radioactive. Activists have also opposed food irradiation for other reasons, for example, arguing that irradiation can be used to sterilize contaminated food without resolving the underlying cause of the contamination. International legislation on whether food may be irradiated or not varies worldwide from no regulation to a full ban.\nApproximately 500,000 tons of food items are irradiated per year worldwide in over 40 countries. These are mainly spices and condiments, with an increasing segment of fresh fruit irradiated for fruit fly quarantine.\nPulsed electric field electroporation.\nPulsed electric field (PEF) electroporation is a method for processing cells by means of brief pulses of a strong electric field. PEF holds potential as a type of low-temperature alternative pasteurization process for sterilizing food products. In PEF processing, a substance is placed between two electrodes, then the pulsed electric field is applied. The electric field enlarges the pores of the cell membranes, which kills the cells and releases their contents. PEF for food processing is a developing technology still being researched. There have been limited industrial applications of PEF processing for the pasteurization of fruit juices. To date, several PEF treated juices are available on the market in Europe. Furthermore, for several years a juice pasteurization application in the US has used PEF. For cell disintegration purposes especially potato processors show great interest in PEF technology as an efficient alternative for their preheaters. Potato applications are already operational in the US and Canada. There are also commercial PEF potato applications in various countries in Europe, as well as in Australia, India, and China.\nModified atmosphere.\nModifying atmosphere is a way to preserve food by operating on the atmosphere around it. It is often used to package:\nNonthermal plasma.\nThis process subjects the surface of food to a \"flame\" of ionized gas molecules, such as helium or nitrogen. This causes micro-organisms to die off on the surface.\nHigh-pressure food preservation.\nHigh pressure can be used to disable harmful microorganisms and spoilage enzymes while retaining the food's fresh appearance, flavor, texture and nutrients. By 2005, the process was being used for products ranging from orange juice to guacamole to deli meats and widely sold. Depending on temperature and pressure settings, HP processing can achieve either pasteurization-equivalent log reduction or go all the way to achieve sterilization of all microbes.\nBiopreservation.\nBiopreservation is the use of natural or controlled microbiota or antimicrobials as a way of preserving food and extending its shelf life. Beneficial bacteria or the fermentation products produced by these bacteria are used in biopreservation to control spoilage and render pathogens inactive in food. It is a benign ecological approach which is gaining increasing attention.\nLactic acid bacteria (LAB) have antagonistic properties that make them particularly useful as biopreservatives. When LABs compete for nutrients, their metabolites often include active antimicrobials such as lactic acid, acetic acid, hydrogen peroxide, and peptide bacteriocins. Some LABs produce the antimicrobial nisin, which is a particularly effective preservative.\nLAB bacteriocins are used in the present day as an integral part of hurdle technology. Using them in combination with other preservative techniques can effectively control spoilage bacteria and other pathogens, and can inhibit the activities of a wide spectrum of organisms, including inherently resistant Gram-negative bacteria.\nHurdle technology.\nHurdle technology is a method of ensuring that pathogens in food products can be eliminated or controlled by combining more than one approach. These approaches can be thought of as \"hurdles\" the pathogen has to overcome if it is to remain active in the food. The right combination of hurdles can ensure all pathogens are eliminated or rendered harmless in the final product.\nHurdle technology has been defined by Leistner (2000) as an intelligent combination of hurdles that secures the microbial safety and stability as well as the organoleptic and nutritional quality and the economic viability of food products. The organoleptic quality of the food refers to its sensory properties, that is its look, taste, smell, and texture.\nExamples of hurdles in a food system are high temperature during processing, low temperature during storage, increasing the acidity, lowering the water activity or redox potential, and the presence of preservatives or biopreservatives. According to the type of pathogens and how risky they are, the intensity of the hurdles can be adjusted individually to meet consumer preferences in an economical way, without sacrificing the safety of the product.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "10835", "revid": "18731412", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=10835", "title": "Frequency modulation", "text": "Electronic method of transmitting information with a carrier wave\nFrequency modulation (FM) is a signal modulation technique used in electronic communication, originally for transmitting messages with a radio wave. In frequency modulation a carrier wave is varied in its instantaneous frequency in proportion to a property, primarily the instantaneous amplitude, of a message signal, such as an audio signal. The technology is used in telecommunications, radio broadcasting, signal processing, and .\nIn analog frequency modulation, such as radio broadcasting of voice and music, the instantaneous frequency deviation, i.e. the difference between the frequency of the carrier and its center frequency, has a functional relation to the modulating signal amplitude.\nDigital data can be encoded and transmitted with a type of frequency modulation known as frequency-shift keying (FSK), in which the instantaneous frequency of the carrier is shifted among a set of frequencies. The frequencies may represent digits, such as \"0\" and \"1\". FSK is widely used in computer modems such as fax modems, telephone caller ID systems, garage door openers, and other low-frequency transmissions. Radioteletype also uses FSK.\nFrequency modulation is widely used for FM radio broadcasting. It is also used in telemetry, radar, seismic prospecting, and monitoring newborns for seizures via EEG, two-way radio systems, sound synthesis, magnetic tape-recording systems and some video-transmission systems. In radio transmission, an advantage of frequency modulation is that it has a larger signal-to-noise ratio and therefore rejects radio frequency interference better than an equal power amplitude modulation (AM) signal. For this reason, most music is broadcast over FM radio.\nFrequency modulation and phase modulation are the two complementary principal methods of angle modulation; phase modulation is often used as an intermediate step to achieve frequency modulation. These methods contrast with amplitude modulation, in which the amplitude of the carrier wave varies, while the frequency and phase remain constant.\nFM Signal.\nAccording to Nahin, \"To apply the baseband signal of a microphone output directly to the transmitter antenna won't work, because ...a quarter-wavelength antenna at audio frequencies is physically enormous. To have a reasonably sized antenna requires a transmitter signal at frequencies considerably higher than those of the bandwidth spectrum; that is, the baseband spectrum must be upshifted to the radio frequencies.\" This is called signal modulation. According to Bertrand, \"Frequency modulation is a method of modulating a carrier wave whereby the modulating audio causes the instantaneous frequency of the carrier to change. Without modulation, an FM transmitter produces a single carrier frequency.\"\nThe FM signal produced by a sinusoidal carrier of frequency \u03c9c, modulated by an audio tone of frequency \u03c9a with amplitude A, can be written as:\nformula_1\nWe need the instantaneous frequency, which describes a frequency varying above and below the carrier frequency at the audio tone frequency, which we derive by using Carson's time derivative method:\nformula_2\nThe amplitude factor kA\u03c9a defines the maximum Frequency deviation around \u03c9c. Dividing by \u03c9a, gives us the modulation index kA, which \"is the ratio of the amount of frequency deviation to the audio modulating frequency.\"\nWhile most of the energy of the signal is contained within \"fc\" \u00b1 \"f\"\u0394, it can be shown by Fourier analysis that a wider range of frequencies is required to precisely represent an FM signal. The frequency spectrum of an actual FM signal has components extending infinitely, although their amplitude decreases and higher-order components are often neglected in practical design problems.\nSinusoidal baseband signal.\nMathematically, a baseband modulating signal may be approximated by a sinusoidal continuous wave signal with a frequency \"fm\". This method is also named as single-tone modulation. The integral of such a signal formula_3 is:\nformula_4\nIn this case, the expression for y(t) above simplifies to:\nformula_5\nwhere the amplitude formula_6 of the modulating sinusoid is represented in the peak deviation formula_7 (see frequency deviation).\nThe harmonic distribution of a sine wave carrier modulated by such a sinusoidal signal can be represented with Bessel functions; this provides the basis for a mathematical understanding of frequency modulation in the frequency domain.\nModulation index.\nAs in other modulation systems, the modulation index indicates by how much the modulated variable varies around its unmodulated level. It relates to variations in the carrier frequency:\nformula_8\nwhere formula_9 is the highest frequency component present in the modulating signal \"x\"\"m\"(\"t\"), and formula_10 is the peak frequency-deviation\u00a0\u2013 i.e. the maximum deviation of the \"instantaneous frequency\" from the carrier frequency. For a sine wave modulation, the modulation index is seen to be the ratio of the peak frequency deviation of the carrier wave to the frequency of the modulating sine wave.\nIf formula_11, the modulation is called narrowband FM (NFM), and its bandwidth is approximately formula_12. Sometimes modulation index formula_13\u00a0is considered NFM and other modulation indices are considered wideband FM (WFM or FM).\nFor digital modulation systems, for example, binary frequency shift keying (BFSK), where a binary signal modulates the carrier, the modulation index is given by:\nformula_14\nwhere formula_15 is the symbol period, and formula_16 is used as the highest frequency of the modulating binary waveform by convention, even though it would be more accurate to say it is the highest \"fundamental\" of the modulating binary waveform. In the case of digital modulation, the carrier formula_17 is never transmitted. Rather, one of two frequencies is transmitted, either formula_18 or formula_19, depending on the binary state 0 or 1 of the modulation signal.\nIf formula_20, the modulation is called \"wideband FM\" and its bandwidth is approximately formula_21. While wideband FM uses more bandwidth, it can improve the signal-to-noise ratio significantly; for example, doubling the value of formula_10, while keeping formula_23 constant, results in an eight-fold improvement in the signal-to-noise ratio. (Compare this with chirp spread spectrum, which uses extremely wide frequency deviations to achieve processing gains comparable to traditional, better-known spread-spectrum modes).\nWith a tone-modulated FM\u00a0wave, if the modulation frequency is held constant and the modulation index is increased, the (non-negligible) bandwidth of the FM signal increases but the spacing between spectra remains the same; some spectral components decrease in strength as others increase. If the frequency deviation is held constant and the modulation frequency increased, the spacing between spectra increases.\nFrequency modulation can be classified as narrowband if the change in the carrier frequency is about the same as the signal frequency, or as wideband if the change in the carrier frequency is much higher (modulation index\u00a0&gt;\u00a01) than the signal frequency. For example, narrowband FM (NFM) is used for two-way radio systems such as Family Radio Service, in which the carrier is allowed to deviate only 2.5\u00a0kHz above and below the center frequency with speech signals of no more than 3.5\u00a0kHz bandwidth. Wideband FM is used for FM broadcasting, in which music and speech are transmitted with up to 75\u00a0kHz deviation from the center frequency and carry audio with up to a 20\u00a0kHz bandwidth and subcarriers up to 92\u00a0kHz.\nBessel functions.\nIn his 1922 FM paper, Carson pointed out an infinite number of side frequencies are generated when a carrier frequency is modulated by a signal frequency, the amplitudes expressed as Bessel functions. The separation is determined by the frequency of the modulating signal, and the amplitude dependent upon the modulation index. A table of Bessel functions of the first kind is used to determine the side frequency amplitudes. \nFor the case of a carrier modulated by a single sine wave, the resulting frequency spectrum can be calculated using Bessel functions of the first kind, as a function of the sideband number and the modulation index. The carrier and sideband amplitudes are illustrated for different modulation indices of FM signals. For particular values of the modulation index, the carrier amplitude becomes zero and all the signal power is in the sidebands.\nSince the sidebands are on both sides of the carrier, their count is doubled, and then multiplied by the modulating frequency to find the bandwidth. For example, 3\u00a0kHz deviation modulated by a 2.2\u00a0kHz audio tone produces a modulation index of 1.36. Suppose that we limit ourselves to only those sidebands that have a relative amplitude of at least 0.01. Then, examining the chart shows this modulation index will produce three sidebands. These three sidebands, when doubled, gives us (6 \u00d7 2.2\u00a0kHz) or a 13.2\u00a0kHz required bandwidth.\nCarson's rule.\nA rule of thumb, \"Carson's rule\" states that the frequency-modulated signal lies within a bandwidth formula_24 of:\nformula_25\nwhere formula_26, as defined above, is the peak deviation of the instantaneous frequency formula_27 from the center carrier frequency formula_28, formula_29 is the modulation index which is the ratio of frequency deviation to highest frequency in the modulating signal, and formula_9is the highest frequency in the modulating signal.\nCarson's rule can only be applied to sinusoidal signals. For non-sinusoidal signals:\nformula_31\nwhere W is the highest frequency in the modulating signal but non-sinusoidal in nature and D is the Deviation ratio which is the ratio of frequency deviation to highest frequency of modulating non-sinusoidal signal.\nNoise reduction.\nFM provides improved signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), as compared for example with AM. Compared with an optimum AM scheme, FM typically has poorer SNR below a certain signal level called the noise threshold, but above a higher level \u2013 the full improvement or full quieting threshold \u2013 the SNR is much improved over AM. The improvement depends on modulation level and deviation. For typical voice communications channels, improvements are typically 5\u201315\u00a0dB. FM broadcasting using wider deviation can achieve even greater improvements. Additional techniques, such as pre-emphasis of higher audio frequencies with corresponding de-emphasis in the receiver, are generally used to improve overall SNR in FM circuits. Since FM signals have constant amplitude, FM receivers normally have limiters that remove AM noise, further improving SNR.\nImplementation.\nModulation.\nFM signals can be generated using either direct or indirect frequency modulation:\nDemodulation.\nMany FM detector circuits exist. A common method for recovering the information signal is through a Foster\u2013Seeley discriminator or ratio detector. A phase-locked loop can be used as an FM demodulator. \"Slope detection\" demodulates an FM signal by using a tuned circuit which has its resonant frequency slightly offset from the carrier. The input FM wave of constant amplitude and instantaneous frequency, is converted to an FM wave with instantaneous frequency and instantaneous amplitude, which is then sent to an envelop detector. AM receivers may detect some FM transmissions by this means, although it does not provide an efficient means of detection for FM broadcasts.\nIn software-defined radio implementations, the demodulation may be carried out by using the Hilbert transform (implemented as a filter) to recover the instantaneous phase, and thereafter differentiating this phase (using another filter) to recover the instantaneous frequency. Alternatively, a complex mixer followed by a bandpass filter may be used to translate the signal to baseband, and then proceeding as before. For sampled signals, phase detection, and therefore frequency modulation detection, can be approximated by taking the IQ (complex) sample and multiplying it with the complex conjugate of the previous IQ sample, formula_32. If the demodulated signal is sampled at or above Nyquist, this allows for recovery of near-instantaneous phase changes.\nApplications.\nDoppler effect.\nIn 1968, Schnitzler noted certain bats lower the animal echolocation emission frequency by 13 to 16 kHz, compensating for Doppler shifts caused by the bat\u2019s own movement. Doppler shift compensation, dynamic frequency modulation, ensures that the returning echo frequency is optimally adjusted for the bat's auditory fovea.\nMagnetic tape storage.\nFM is also used at intermediate frequencies by analog VCR systems (including VHS) to record the luminance (black and white) portions of the video signal. Commonly, the chrominance component is recorded as a conventional AM signal, using the higher-frequency FM signal as bias. FM is the only feasible method of recording the luminance (\"black-and-white\") component of video to (and retrieving video from) magnetic tape without distortion; video signals have a large range of frequency components \u2013 from a few hertz to several megahertz, too wide for equalizers to work with due to electronic noise below \u221260\u00a0dB. FM also keeps the tape at saturation level, acting as a form of noise reduction; a limiter can mask variations in playback output, and the FM capture effect removes print-through and pre-echo. A continuous pilot-tone, if added to the signal \u2013 as was done on V2000 and many Hi-band formats \u2013 can keep mechanical jitter under control and assist timebase correction.\nThese FM systems are unusual, in that they have a ratio of carrier to maximum modulation frequency of less than two; contrast this with FM audio broadcasting, where the ratio is around 10,000. Consider, for example, a 6-MHz carrier modulated at a 3.5-MHz rate; by Bessel analysis, the first sidebands are on 9.5 and 2.5\u00a0MHz and the second sidebands are on 13\u00a0MHz and \u22121\u00a0MHz. The result is a reversed-phase sideband on +1\u00a0MHz; on demodulation, this results in unwanted output at 6 \u2013 1 = 5\u00a0MHz. The system must be designed so that this unwanted output is reduced to an acceptable level.\nSound.\nFM is also used at audio frequencies to synthesize sound. This technique, known as FM synthesis, was popularized by early digital synthesizers and became a standard feature in several generations of personal computer sound cards.\nRadio.\nEdwin Howard Armstrong (1890\u20131954) was an American electrical engineer who invented wideband frequency modulation (FM) radio.\nHe patented the regenerative circuit in 1914, the superheterodyne receiver in 1918 and the super-regenerative circuit in 1922. Armstrong presented his paper, \"A Method of Reducing Disturbances in Radio Signaling by a System of Frequency Modulation\", (which first described FM radio) before the New York section of the Institute of Radio Engineers on November 6, 1935. The paper was published in 1936. The first experimental station, W2XMN, went on the air in 1937.\nAs the name implies, wideband FM (WFM) requires a wider signal bandwidth than amplitude modulation by an equivalent modulating signal; this also makes the signal more robust against noise and interference. Frequency modulation is also more robust against signal-amplitude-fading phenomena. As a result, FM was chosen as the modulation standard for high frequency, high fidelity radio transmission, hence the term \"FM radio\" (although for many years the BBC called it \"VHF radio\" because commercial FM broadcasting uses part of the VHF band\u00a0\u2013 the FM broadcast band). FM receivers employ a special detector for FM signals and exhibit a phenomenon known as the \"capture effect\", in which the tuner \"captures\" the stronger of two stations on the same frequency while rejecting the other (compare this with a similar situation on an AM receiver, where both stations can be heard simultaneously). Frequency drift or a lack of selectivity may cause one station to be overtaken by another on an adjacent channel. Frequency drift was a problem in early (or inexpensive) receivers; inadequate selectivity may affect any tuner.\nA wideband FM signal can also be used to carry a stereo signal; this is done with multiplexing and demultiplexing before and after the FM process. The FM modulation and demodulation process is identical in stereo and monaural processes.\nFM is commonly used at VHF radio frequencies for high-fidelity broadcasts of music and speech. In broadcast services, where audio fidelity is important, wideband FM is generally used. Analog TV sound is also broadcast using FM. Narrowband FM is used for voice communications in commercial and amateur radio settings. In two-way radio, narrowband FM (NBFM) is used to conserve bandwidth for land mobile, marine mobile and other radio services.\nA high-efficiency radio-frequency switching amplifier can be used to transmit FM signals (and other constant-amplitude signals). For a given signal strength (measured at the receiver antenna), switching amplifiers use less battery power and typically cost less than a linear amplifier. This gives FM another advantage over other modulation methods requiring linear amplifiers, such as AM and QAM.\nThere are reports that on October 5, 1924, Professor Mikhail A. Bonch-Bruevich, during a scientific and technical conversation in the Nizhny Novgorod Radio Laboratory, reported about his new method of telephony, based on a change in the period of oscillations. Demonstration of frequency modulation was carried out on the laboratory model.\nHearing assistive technology.\nFrequency modulated systems are a widespread and commercially available assistive technology that make speech more understandable by improving the signal-to-noise ratio in the user's ear. They are also called \"auditory trainers\", a term which refers to any sound amplification system not classified as a hearing aid. They intensify signal levels from the source by 15 to 20 decibels. FM systems are used by hearing-impaired people as well as children whose listening is affected by disorders such as auditory processing disorder or ADHD. For people with sensorineural hearing loss, FM systems result in better speech perception than hearing aids. They can be coupled with behind-the-ear hearing aids to allow the user to alternate the setting. FM systems are more convenient and cost-effective than alternatives such as cochlear implants, but many users use FM systems infrequently due to their conspicuousness and need for recharging.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Rationality is based on reason or facts. Faith is belief in inspiration, revelation, or authority. The word \"faith\" sometimes refers to a belief that is held independently or in spite of reason or empirical evidence, or it can refer to belief based upon a degree of evidential warrant.\nRelationship between faith and reason.\nRationalists point out that many people hold irrational beliefs, for many reasons. There may be evolutionary causes for irrational beliefs\u2014irrational beliefs may increase our ability to survive and reproduce.\nOne more reason for irrational beliefs can perhaps be explained by operant conditioning. For example, in one study by B. F. Skinner in 1948, pigeons were awarded grain at regular time intervals regardless of their behaviour. The result was that each of the pigeons developed their own idiosyncratic response which had become associated with the consequence of receiving grain.\nBelievers in the value of faith\u2014for example those who believe salvation is possible through faith alone\u2014frequently suggest that everyone holds beliefs arrived at by faith, not reason.\nOne form of belief held \"by faith\" may be seen existing in a faith as based on warrant. In this view some degree of evidence provides warrant for faith; it consists in other words in \"explain[ing] great things by small.\"\nChristianity.\nCatholic views.\nThomas Aquinas was the first to write a full treatment of the relationship, differences, and similarities between faith, which he calls \"an intellectual assent\", and reason.\n\"Dei Filius\" was a dogmatic constitution of the First Vatican Council on the Roman Catholic faith. It was adopted unanimously on 24 April 1870. It states that \"not only can faith and reason never be opposed to one another, but they are of mutual aid one to the other\".\nRecent popes have spoken about faith and rationality: \"Fides et ratio\", an encyclical letter promulgated by Pope John Paul II on 14 September 1998, deals with the relationship between faith and reason. Pope Benedict XVI's Regensburg lecture, delivered on 12 September 2006, was on the subject of \"faith, reason and the university\".\nReformed views.\nAlvin Plantinga upholds that faith may be the result of evidence testifying to the reliability of the source of truth claims, but although it may involve this, he sees faith as being the result of hearing the truth of the gospel with the internal persuasion by the Holy Spirit moving and enabling him to believe. \"Christian belief is produced in the believer by the internal instigation of the Holy Spirit, endorsing the teachings of Scripture, which is itself divinely inspired by the Holy Spirit. The result of the work of the Holy Spirit is faith.\"\nEvangelical views.\nAmerican biblical scholar Archibald Thomas Robertson stated that the Greek word \"pistis\" used for faith in the New Testament (over two hundred forty times), and rendered \"assurance\" in Acts 17:31 (KJV), is \"an old verb to furnish, used regularly by Demosthenes for bringing forward evidence.\" Likewise Tom Price (Oxford Centre for Christian Apologetics) affirms that when the New Testament talks about faith positively it only uses words derived from the Greek root [pistis] which means \"to be persuaded.\"\nIn contrast to faith meaning blind trust, in the absence of evidence, even in the teeth of evidence, Alister McGrath quotes Oxford Anglican theologian W. H. Griffith-Thomas (1861\u20131924), who states faith is \"not blind, but intelligent\" and \"commences with the conviction of the mind based on adequate evidence\", which McGrath sees as \"a good and reliable definition, synthesizing the core elements of the characteristic Christian understanding of faith.\"\nJewish views.\nThe 14th-century Jewish philosopher Levi ben Gerson tried to reconcile faith and reason. He wrote: \"the Law cannot prevent us from considering to be true that which our reason urges us to believe.\"\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

F-waves are the second of two late voltage changes observed after stimulation is applied to the skin surface above the distal region of a nerve, in addition to the H-reflex (Hoffman's Reflex) which is a muscle reaction in response to electrical stimulation of innervating sensory fibers. Traversal of F-waves along the entire length of peripheral nerves between the spinal cord and muscle, allows for assessment of motor nerve conduction between distal stimulation sites in the arm and leg, and related motoneurons (MN's) in the cervical and lumbosacral cord. F-waves are able to assess both afferent and efferent loops of the alpha motor neuron in its entirety. As such, various properties of F-wave motor nerve conduction are analyzed in nerve conduction studies (NCS), and often used to assess polyneuropathies, resulting from states of neuronal demyelination and loss of peripheral axonal integrity.\nWith respect to its nomenclature, the F-wave is so named as it was initially studied in the smaller muscles of the foot. The observation of F-waves in the same motor units (MU) as those present in the direct motor response (M), along with the presence of F-waves in deafferented animal and human models, indicates that F-waves require direct activation of motor axons to be elicited, and do not involve conduction along afferent sensory nerves. Thus, the F-wave is considered a wave, as opposed to a reflex.\nPhysiology.\nF-waves are evoked by strong electrical stimuli (supramaximal) applied to the skin surface above the distal portion of a nerve. This impulse travels both in orthodromic fashion (towards the muscle fibers) and antidromic fashion (towards the cell body in the spinal cord) along the alpha motor neuron. As the orthodromic impulse reaches innervated muscle fibers, a strong direct motor response (M) is evoked in these muscle fibers, resulting in a primary compound muscle action potential (CMAP). As the antidromic impulse reaches the cell bodies within the anterior horn of the motor neuron pool by retrograde transmission, a select portion of these alpha motor neurons, (roughly 5-10% of available motor neurons), 'backfire' or rebound. This antidromic 'backfiring' elicits an orthodromic impulse that follows back down the alpha motor neuron, towards innervated muscle fibers. Conventionally, axonal segments of motor neurons previously depolarized by preceding antidromic impulses enter a hyperpolarized state, disallowing the travel of impulses along them. However, these same axonal segments remains excitable or relatively depolarized for a sufficient period of time, allowing for rapid antidromic backfiring, and thus the continuation of the orthodromic impulse towards innervated muscle fibers. This successive orthodromic stimulus then evokes a smaller population of muscle fibers, resulting in a smaller CMAP known as an F-wave.\nSeveral physiological factors may possibly influence the presence of F-waves after peripheral nerve stimulation. The shape and size of F-waves, along with the probability of their presence is small, as a high degree of variability exists in motor unit (MU) activation for any given stimulation. Thus, the generation of CMAP's which elicit F-waves is subject to the variability in activation of motor units in a given pool over successive stimuli. Moreover, stimulation of peripheral nerve fibers account for both orthodromic impulses (along sensory fibers, towards the dorsal horn), as well as antidromic activity (along alpha motor neurons towards the ventral horn). Antidromic activity along collateral branches of alpha motor neurons may result in the activation of inhibitory Renshaw cells or direct inhibitory collaterals between motorneurons. Inhibition by these means may lower excitability of adjacent motor neurons and decrease the potential for antidromic backfiring and resultant F-waves; although it has been argued Renshaw cells preferentially inhibit smaller alpha motor neurons limited influence on modulation of antidromic backfiring.\nBecause a different population of anterior horn cells is stimulated with each stimulation, F waves are characterized as ubiquitous, low amplitude, late motor responses, which can vary in amplitude, latency and configuration across a series of stimuli.\nProperties.\nF waves can be analyzed by several properties including:\nMeasurements.\nSeveral measurements can be done on the F responses, including:\nThe minimal F wave latency is typically 25-32 ms in the upper extremities and 45-56 ms in the lower extremities.\nF wave persistence is the number of F waves obtained per the number of stimulations, which is normally 80-100% (or above 50%).\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Edible fruits in particular have long propagated using the movements of humans and other animals in a symbiotic relationship that is the means for seed dispersal for the one group and nutrition for the other; humans, and many other animals, have become dependent on fruits as a source of food. Consequently, fruits account for a substantial fraction of the world's agricultural output, and some (such as the apple and the pomegranate) have acquired extensive cultural and symbolic meanings.\nIn common language and culinary usage, \"fruit\" normally means the seed-associated fleshy structures (or produce) of plants that typically are sweet (or sour) and edible in the raw state, such as apples, bananas, grapes, lemons, oranges, and strawberries. In botanical usage, the term \"fruit\" also includes many structures that are not commonly called as such in everyday language, such as nuts, bean pods, corn kernels, tomatoes, and wheat grains.\nBotanical vs. culinary.\nMany common language terms used for fruit and seeds differ from botanical classifications. For example, in botany, a \"fruit\" is a ripened ovary or carpel that contains seeds, e.g., an orange, pomegranate, tomato or a pumpkin. A \"nut\" is a type of fruit (and not a seed), and a \"seed\" is a ripened ovule.\nIn culinary language, a \"fruit\" is the sweet- or not sweet- (even sour-) tasting produce of a specific plant (e.g., a peach, pear or lemon); \"nuts\" are hard, oily, non-sweet plant produce in shells (e.g. hazelnut, acorn). \"Vegetables\", so-called, typically are savory or non-sweet produce (e.g. zucchini, lettuce, broccoli, and tomato). But some may be sweet-tasting (sweet potato).\nExamples of botanically classified fruit that are typically called vegetables include cucumber, pumpkin, and squash or other winter squashes (all are cucurbits); beans, peanuts, and peas (all legumes); and corn, eggplant, bell pepper (or sweet pepper), and tomato. Many spices are fruits, botanically speaking, including black pepper, chili pepper, cumin and allspice. In contrast, rhubarb is often called a fruit when used in making pies, but the edible produce of rhubarb is actually the leaf stalk or petiole of the plant. Edible gymnosperm seeds are often given fruit names, e.g., ginkgo nuts and pine nuts.\nBotanically, a cereal grain, such as corn, rice, or wheat is a kind of fruit (termed a caryopsis). However, the fruit wall is thin and fused to the seed coat, so almost all the edible grain-fruit is actually a seed.\nStructure.\nThe outer layer, often edible, of most fruits is called the \"pericarp\". Typically formed from the ovary, it surrounds the seeds; in some species, however, other structural tissues contribute to or form the edible portion. The pericarp may be described in three layers from outer to inner, i.e., the \"epicarp\", \"mesocarp\" and \"endocarp\".\nFruit that bears a prominent pointed terminal projection is said to be \"beaked\".\nDevelopment.\nA fruit results from the fertilizing and maturing of one or more flowers. The gynoecium, which contains the \"stigma-style-ovary\" system, is centered in the flower-head, and it forms all or part of the fruit. Inside the ovary(ies) are one or more ovules. Here begins a complex sequence called \"double fertilization\": a female gametophyte produces an egg cell for the purpose of fertilization. (A female gametophyte is called a \"megagametophyte\", and also called the \"embryo sac\".) After double fertilization, the ovules will become seeds.\nOvules are fertilized in a process that starts with pollination, which is the movement of pollen from the stamens to the stigma-style-ovary system within the flower-head. After pollination, a pollen tube grows from the (deposited) pollen through the stigma down the style into the ovary to the ovule. Two sperm are transferred from the pollen to a megagametophyte. Within the megagametophyte, one sperm unites with the egg, forming a zygote, while the second sperm enters the central cell forming the endosperm mother cell, which completes the double fertilization process. Later, the zygote will give rise to the embryo of the seed, and the endosperm mother cell will give rise to endosperm, a nutritive tissue used by the embryo.\nFruit formation is associated with meiosis, a central aspect of sexual reproduction in flowering plants. During meiosis homologous chromosomes replicate, recombine and randomly segregate, and then undergo segregation of sister chromatids to produce haploid cells. Union of haploid nuclei from pollen and ovule (fertilisation), occurring either by self- or cross-pollination, leads to the formation of a diploid zygote that can then develop into an embryo within the emerging seed. Repeated fertilisations within the ovary are accompanied by maturation of the ovary to form the fruit.\nAs the ovules develop into seeds, the ovary begins to ripen and the ovary wall, the \"pericarp\", may become fleshy (as in berries or drupes), or it may form a hard outer covering (as in nuts). In some multi-seeded fruits, the extent to which a fleshy structure develops is proportional to the number of fertilized ovules. The pericarp typically is differentiated into two or three distinct layers; these are called the \"exocarp\" (outer layer, also called epicarp), \"mesocarp\" (middle layer), and \"endocarp\" (inner layer).\nIn some fruits, the sepals, petals, stamens or the style of the flower fall away as the fleshy fruit ripens. However, for simple fruits derived from an \"inferior ovary\" \u2013 i.e., one that lies below the attachment of other floral parts \u2013 there are parts (including petals, sepals, and stamens) that fuse with the ovary and ripen with it. For such a case, when floral parts other than the ovary form a significant part of the fruit that develops, it is called an accessory fruit. Examples of accessory fruits include apple, rose hip, strawberry, and pineapple.\nBecause several parts of the flower besides the ovary may contribute to the structure of a fruit, it is important to understand how a particular fruit forms. There are three general modes of fruit development:\nClassification of fruits.\nConsistent with the three modes of fruit development, plant scientists have classified fruits into three main groups: simple fruits, aggregate fruits, and multiple (or composite) fruits. The groupings reflect how the ovary and other flower organs are arranged and how the fruits develop, but they are not evolutionarily relevant as diverse plant taxa may be in the same group.\nWhile the section of a fungus that produces spores is called a \"fruiting\" body, fungi are members of the fungi kingdom and not of the plant kingdom.\nSimple fruits.\nSimple fruits are the result of the ripening-to-fruit of a simple or compound ovary in a \"single flower\" with a \"single pistil\". In contrast, a single flower with numerous pistils typically produces an aggregate fruit; and the merging of several flowers, or a 'multiple' of flowers, results in a 'multiple' fruit. A simple fruit is further classified as either dry or fleshy.\nTo distribute their seeds, dry fruits may split open and discharge their seeds to the winds, which is called dehiscence. Or the distribution process may rely upon the decay and degradation of the fruit to expose the seeds; or it may rely upon the eating of fruit and excreting of seeds by frugivores \u2013 both are called indehiscence. Fleshy fruits do not split open, but they also are indehiscent and they may also rely on frugivores for distribution of their seeds. Typically, the entire outer layer of the ovary wall ripens into a potentially edible pericarp.\nTypes of dry simple fruits, (with examples) include:\nFruits in which part or all of the \"pericarp\" (fruit wall) is fleshy at maturity are termed \"fleshy simple fruits\".\nTypes of fleshy simple fruits, (with examples) include:\nBerries.\nBerries are a type of simple fleshy fruit that issue from a single ovary. (The ovary itself may be compound, with several carpels.) The botanical term \"true berry\" includes grapes, currants, cucumbers, eggplants (aubergines), tomatoes, chili peppers, and bananas, but excludes certain fruits that are called \"-berry\" by culinary custom or by common usage of the term \u2013 such as strawberries and raspberries. Berries may be formed from one or more carpels (i.e., from the simple or compound ovary) from the same, single flower. Seeds typically are embedded in the fleshy interior of the ovary.\nExamples include:\nThe strawberry, regardless of its appearance, is classified as a dry, not a fleshy fruit. Botanically, it is not a berry; it is an aggregate-accessory fruit, the latter term meaning the fleshy part is derived not from the plant's ovaries but from the receptacle that holds the ovaries. Numerous dry achenes are attached to the outside of the fruit-flesh; they appear to be seeds but each is actually an ovary of a flower, with a seed inside.\nSchizocarps are dry fruits, though some appear to be fleshy. They originate from syncarpous ovaries but do not actually dehisce; rather, they split into segments with one or more seeds. They include a number of different forms from a wide range of families, including carrot, parsnip, parsley, cumin.\nAggregate fruits.\nAn aggregate fruit is also called an aggregation, or \"etaerio\"; it develops from a single flower that presents numerous simple pistils. Each pistil contains one carpel; together, they form a fruitlet. The ultimate (fruiting) development of the aggregation of pistils is called an \"aggregate fruit\", \"etaerio fruit\", or simply an \"etaerio\".\nDifferent types of aggregate fruits can produce different etaerios, such as achenes, drupelets, follicles, and berries.\nSome other broadly recognized species and their etaerios (or aggregations) are:\nThe pistils of the raspberry are called \"drupelets\" because each pistil is like a small drupe attached to the receptacle. In some bramble fruits, such as blackberry, the receptacle, an accessory part, elongates and then develops as part of the fruit, making the blackberry an aggregate-accessory fruit. The strawberry is also an aggregate-accessory fruit, of which the seeds are contained in the achenes. Notably in all these examples, the fruit develops from a single flower, with numerous pistils.\nHybrid fruits.\nHybrid fruits are created through the controlled speciation of fruits that creates new varieties and cross-breeds. Hybrids are grown using plant propagation to create new cultivars. This may introduce an entirely new type of fruit or improve the properties of an existing fruit.\nMultiple fruits.\nA multiple fruit is formed from a cluster of flowers, (a 'multiple' of flowers) \u2013 also called an \"inflorescence\". Each ('smallish') flower produces a single fruitlet, which, as all develop, all merge into one mass of fruit. Examples include pineapple, fig, mulberry, Osage orange, and breadfruit. An inflorescence (a cluster) of white flowers, called a head, is produced first. After fertilization, each flower in the cluster develops into a drupe; as the drupes expand, they develop as a \"connate\" organ, merging into a multiple fleshy fruit called a \"syncarp\".\nProgressive stages of multiple flowering and fruit development can be observed on a single branch of the Indian mulberry, or \"noni\". During the sequence of development, a progression of second, third, and more inflorescences are initiated in turn at the head of the branch or stem.\nAccessory fruit forms.\nFruits may incorporate tissues derived from other floral parts besides the ovary, including the receptacle, hypanthium, petals, or sepals. Accessory fruits occur in all three classes of fruit development \u2013 simple, aggregate, and multiple. Accessory fruits are frequently designated by the hyphenated term showing both characters. For example, a pineapple is a multiple-accessory fruit, a blackberry is an aggregate-accessory fruit, and an apple is a simple-accessory fruit.\nSeedless fruits.\nSeedlessness is an important feature of some fruits of commerce. Commercial cultivars of bananas and pineapples are examples of seedless fruits. Some cultivars of citrus fruits (especially grapefruit, mandarin oranges, navel oranges, satsumas), table grapes, and of watermelons are valued for their seedlessness. In some species, seedlessness is the result of \"parthenocarpy\", where fruits set without fertilization. Parthenocarpic fruit-set may (or may not) require pollination, but most seedless citrus fruits require a stimulus from pollination to produce fruit. Seedless bananas and grapes are triploids, and seedlessness results from the abortion of the embryonic plant that is produced by fertilization, a phenomenon known as \"stenospermocarpy\", which requires normal pollination and fertilization.\nSeed dispersal.\nVariations in fruit structures largely depend on the modes of dispersal applied to their seeds. Dispersal is achieved by wind or water, by explosive dehiscence, and by interactions with animals.\nSome fruits present their outer skins or shells coated with spikes or hooked burrs; these evolved either to deter would-be foragers from feeding on them or to serve to attach themselves to the hair, feathers, legs, or clothing of animals, thereby using them as dispersal agents. These plants are termed zoochorous; common examples include cocklebur, unicorn plant, and beggarticks (or Spanish needle).\nBy developments of mutual evolution, the fleshy produce of fruits typically appeals to hungry animals, such that the seeds contained within are taken in, carried away, and later deposited (i.e., defecated) at a distance from the parent plant. Likewise, the nutritious, oily kernels of nuts typically motivate birds and squirrels to hoard them, burying them in soil to retrieve later during the winter of scarcity; thereby, uneaten seeds are sown effectively under natural conditions to germinate and grow a new plant some distance away from the parent.\nOther fruits have evolved flattened and elongated wings or helicopter-like blades, e.g., elm, maple, and tuliptree. This mechanism increases dispersal distance away from the parent via wind. Other wind-dispersed fruit have tiny \"parachutes\", e.g., dandelion, milkweed, salsify.\nCoconut fruits can float thousands of miles in the ocean, thereby spreading their seeds. Other fruits that can disperse via water are nipa palm and screw pine.\nSome fruits have evolved propulsive mechanisms that fling seeds substantial distances \u2013 perhaps up to in the case of the sandbox tree \u2013 via explosive dehiscence or other such mechanisms (see impatiens and squirting cucumber).\nFood uses.\n A large variety of fruits \u2013 fleshy (simple) fruits from apples to berries to watermelon; dry (simple) fruits including beans and rice and coconuts; aggregate fruits including strawberries, raspberries, blackberries, pawpaw; and multiple fruits such as pineapple, fig, mulberries \u2013 are commercially valuable as human food. They are eaten both fresh and as jams, marmalade and other fruit preserves. They are used extensively in manufactured and processed foods (cakes, cookies, baked goods, flavorings, ice cream, yogurt, canned vegetables, frozen vegetables and meals) and beverages such as fruit juices and alcoholic beverages (brandy, fruit beer, wine). Spices like vanilla, black pepper, paprika, and allspice are derived from berries. Olive fruit is pressed for olive oil and similar processing is applied to other oil-bearing fruits and vegetables. Some fruits are available all year round, while others (such as blackberries and apricots in the UK) are subject to seasonal availability.\nFruits are also used for socializing and gift-giving in the form of fruit baskets and fruit bouquets.\nTypically, many botanical fruits \u2013 \"vegetables\" in culinary parlance \u2013 (including tomato, green beans, leaf greens, bell pepper, cucumber, eggplant, okra, pumpkin, squash, zucchini) are bought and sold daily in fresh produce markets and greengroceries and carried back to kitchens, at home or restaurant, for preparation of meals.\nStorage.\nAll fruits benefit from proper post-harvest care, and in many fruits, the plant hormone ethylene causes ripening. Therefore, maintaining most fruits in an efficient cold chain is optimal for post-harvest storage, with the aim of extending and ensuring shelf life.\nNutritional value.\nA meta-analysis of 83 studies showed fruit or vegetable consumption is associated with reduced markers of inflammation (reduced tumor necrosis factor and C-reactive protein) and enhanced immune cell profile (increased gamma delta T cells).\nVarious culinary fruits provide significant amounts of fiber and water, and many are generally high in vitamin C. An overview of numerous studies showed that fruits (e.g., whole apples or whole oranges) are satisfying (filling) by simply eating and chewing them.\nThe dietary fiber consumed in eating fruit promotes satiety, and may help to control body weight and aid reduction of blood cholesterol, a risk factor for cardiovascular diseases. Fruit consumption is under preliminary research for the potential to improve nutrition and affect chronic diseases. Regular consumption of fruit is generally associated with reduced risks of several diseases and functional declines associated with aging.\nFood safety.\nFor food safety, the CDC recommends proper fruit handling and preparation to reduce the risk of food contamination and foodborne illness. Fresh fruits and vegetables should be carefully selected; at the store, they should not be damaged or bruised; and precut pieces should be refrigerated or surrounded by ice.\nAll fruits and vegetables should be rinsed before eating. This recommendation also applies to produce with rinds or skins that are not eaten. It should be done just before preparing or eating to avoid premature spoilage.\nFruits and vegetables should be kept separate from raw foods like meat, poultry, and seafood, as well as from utensils that have come in contact with raw foods. Fruits and vegetables that are not going to be cooked should be thrown away if they have touched raw meat, poultry, seafood, or eggs.\nAll cut, peeled, or cooked fruits and vegetables should be refrigerated within two hours. After a certain time, harmful bacteria may grow on them and increase the risk of foodborne illness.\nAllergies.\nFruit allergies make up about 10 percent of all food-related allergies.\nNonfood uses.\nBecause fruits have been such a major part of the human diet, various cultures have developed many different uses for fruits they do not depend on for food.

The month has 28 days in common years and 29 in leap years, with the 29th day being called the \"leap day\". February is the third and last month of meteorological winter in the Northern Hemisphere. In the Southern Hemisphere, February is the third and last month of meteorological summer, being the seasonal equivalent of August in the Northern Hemisphere. February is preceded by the first month of the year, January, and is succeeded by the third month of the year, March.\nPronunciation.\n\"February\" can be pronounced in several different ways. The beginning of the word is commonly pronounced either as or ; many people drop the first \"r\", replacing it with , as if it were spelled \"Febuary\". This comes about by analogy with \"January\" (), as well as by a dissimilation effect whereby having two \"r\"s close to each other causes one to change. The ending of the word is pronounced in the US and in the UK.\nHistory.\nThe Roman month was named after the Latin term , which means \"purification\", via the purification ritual held on February 15 (full moon) in the old lunar Roman calendar. January and February were the last two months to be added to the Roman calendar, since the Romans originally considered winter a monthless period of the year. They were added by Numa Pompilius about 713\u00a0BC. February remained the last month of the calendar year until the time of the decemvirs (c.\u2009450\u00a0BC), when it became the second month. At certain times February was truncated to 23 or 24 days, and a 27-day intercalary month, Intercalaris, was occasionally inserted immediately after February to realign the year with the seasons.\nFebruary observances in Ancient Rome included Amburbium (precise date unknown), Sementivae (February 2), Februa (February 13\u201315), Lupercalia (February 13\u201315), Parentalia (February 13\u201322), Quirinalia (February 17), Feralia (February 21), Caristia (February 22), Terminalia (February 23), Regifugium (February 24), and Agonium Martiale (February 27). These days do not correspond to the modern Gregorian calendar.\nUnder the reforms that instituted the Julian calendar, Intercalaris was abolished, leap years occurred regularly every fourth year, and in leap years February gained a 29th day. Thereafter, it remained the second month of the calendar year, meaning the order that months are displayed (January, February, March,\u00a0..., December) within a year-at-a-glance calendar. Even during the Middle Ages, when the numbered Anno Domini year began on March 25 or December 25, the second month was February whenever all twelve months were displayed in order. The Gregorian calendar reforms made slight changes to the system for determining which years were leap years, but also contained a 29-day February.\nHistorical names for February include the Old English terms Solmonath (mud month) and Kale-monath (named for cabbage) as well as Charlemagne's designation Hornung. In Finnish, the month is called , meaning \"month of the pearl\"; when snow melts on tree branches, it forms droplets, and as these freeze again, they are like pearls of ice. In Polish and Ukrainian, respectively, the month is called or (), meaning the month of ice or hard frost. In Macedonian the month is (), meaning month of cutting (wood). In Czech, it is called , meaning month of submerging (of river ice).\nIn Slovene, February is traditionally called , related to icicles or Candlemas. This name originates from , written as in the \"New Carniolan Almanac\" from 1775 and changed to its final form by Franc Metelko in his \"New Almanac\" from 1824. The name was also spelled , meaning \"the month of cutting down of trees\". In 1848, a proposal was put forward in \"Kmetijske in rokodelske novice\" by the Slovene Society of Ljubljana to call this month (related to ice melting), but it did not stick. The idea was proposed by a priest, Bla\u017e Poto\u010dnik. Another name of February in Slovene was , after the mythological character Vesna.\nPatterns.\nHaving only 28 days in common years, February is the only month of the year that can pass without a single full moon. Using Coordinated Universal Time as the basis for determining the date and time of a full moon, this last happened in 2018 and will next happen in 2037. The same is true regarding a new moon: again using Coordinated Universal Time as the basis, this last happened in 2014 and will next happen in 2033.\nFebruary is also the only month of the calendar that, at intervals alternating between one of six years and two of eleven years, has exactly four full 7-day weeks. In countries that start their week on a Monday, it occurs as part of a common year starting on Friday, in which February 1st is a Monday and the 28th is a Sunday; the most recent occurrence was 2021, and the next one will be 2027. In countries that start their week on a Sunday, it occurs in a common year starting on Thursday; the most recent occurrence was 2015 and the next occurrence will be 2026. The pattern is broken by a skipped leap year, but no leap year has been skipped since 1900 and no others will be skipped until 2100.\nAstronomy.\nFebruary meteor showers include the Alpha Centaurids (appearing in early February), the March Virginids (lasting from February 14 to April 25, peaking around March 20), the Delta Cancrids (appearing December 14 to February 14, peaking on January 17), the Omicron Centaurids (late January through February, peaking in mid-February), Theta Centaurids (January 23 \u2013 March 12, only visible in the southern hemisphere), Eta Virginids (February 24 and March 27, peaking around March 18), and Pi Virginids (February 13 and April 8, peaking between March 3 and March 9).\nSymbols.\nThe zodiac signs of February are Aquarius (until February 18) and Pisces (February 19 onward).\nIts birth flowers are the violet (\"Viola\"), the common primrose (\"Primula vulgaris\"), and the Iris. Its birthstone is the amethyst, which symbolizes piety, humility, spiritual wisdom, and sincerity.\nObservances.\n\"This list does not necessarily imply either official status nor general observance.\"\nNon-Gregorian.\n\"(All Baha'i, Islamic, and Jewish observances begin at the sundown prior to the date listed, and end at sundown of the date in question unless otherwise noted.)\"\nMovable.\nFirst Saturday\nFirst Sunday \nFirst Week of February (first Monday, ending on Sunday)\nFirst Monday\nFirst Friday \nSecond Saturday \nSecond Sunday\nSecond Monday\nSecond Tuesday \nWeek of February 22 \nThird Monday\nThird Thursday\nThird Friday \nLast Friday\nLast Saturday\nLast day of February\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Although the first lady's role has never been codified or officially defined, she figures prominently in the political and social life of the United States. The first lady of the United States traditionally acts as the hostess of the White House. Historically, when a president has been unmarried or a widower, he has usually asked a relative to act as White House hostess.\nWhile the household always had domestic staff, since the early 20th century, the first lady has been assisted by her event staff, which has grown over the years to include communications, personal, and program staff, who comprise the Office of the First Lady (OFA).\nSince the 1900s, the role of first lady has changed considerably. It has come to include involvement in political campaigns, management of the White House, championship of social causes, and representation of the president at official and ceremonial occasions. Additionally, over the years individual first ladies have held influence in a range of sectors, from fashion to public opinion on policy, as well as advocacy for female empowerment. The current first lady, since January 20, 2025, is Melania Trump, wife of President Donald Trump.\nOrigins of the title.\nThe use of the title first lady to describe the spouse or hostess of an executive began in the United States. In the early days of the republic, there was not a generally accepted title for the wife of the president. Many early first ladies expressed their own preference for how they were addressed, including the use of such titles as \"Lady\", \"Mrs. President\" and \"Mrs. Presidentress\"; Martha Washington was often referred to as \"Lady Washington\". One of the earliest uses of the term \"First Lady\" was applied to her in an 1838 newspaper article that appeared in the \"St. Johnsbury Caledonian\", the author, \"Mrs. Sigourney\", discusses how Martha Washington had not changed, even after her husband George became president. She wrote that \"The first lady of the nation still preserved the habits of early life. Indulging in no indolence, she left the pillow at dawn, and after breakfast, retired to her chamber for an hour for the study of the scriptures and devotion.\"\nAccording to popular belief, Dolley Madison was referred to as first lady in 1849 at her funeral in a eulogy delivered by President Zachary Taylor; however, no written record of this eulogy exists, nor did any of the newspapers of her day refer to her by that title. Sometime after 1849, the title began being used in Washington, D.C., social circles. The first person to have the title applied to her while she was actually holding the office was Harriet Lane, the niece of James Buchanan; \"Leslie's Illustrated Newspaper\" used the phrase to describe her in an 1860 article about her duties as White House hostess. Another of the earliest known written examples comes from a November 3, 1863, diary entry of William Howard Russell, in which he referred to gossip about \"the First Lady in the Land\", referring to Mary Todd Lincoln. The title first gained nationwide recognition in 1877, when newspaper journalist Mary C. Ames referred to Lucy Webb Hayes as \"the First Lady of the Land\" while reporting on the inauguration of Rutherford B. Hayes. The frequent reporting on Lucy Hayes' activities helped spread use of the title outside Washington. A popular 1911 comedic play about Dolley Madison by playwright Charles Nirdlinger, titled \"The First Lady in the Land\", popularized the title further. By the 1930s, it was in wide use. Use of the title later spread from the United States to other nations.\nWhen Edith Wilson took control of her husband's schedule in 1919 after he had a debilitating stroke, one Republican senator labeled her \"the Presidentress who had fulfilled the dream of the suffragettes by changing her title from First Lady to Acting First Man\". According to the Nexis database, the abbreviation FLOTUS (pronounced ) was first used in 1983 by Donnie Radcliffe, writing in \"The Washington Post\".\nNon-spouses in the role.\nSeveral women (at least thirteen) who were not presidents' wives have served as first lady, as when the president was a bachelor or widower, or when the wife of the president was unable to fulfill the duties of the first lady herself. In these cases, the position has been filled by a female relative of the president, such as Jefferson's daughter Martha Jefferson Randolph, Jackson's daughter-in-law Sarah Yorke Jackson and his wife's niece Emily Donelson, Taylor's daughter Mary Elizabeth Bliss, Benjamin Harrison's daughter Mary Harrison McKee, Buchanan's niece Harriet Lane, Chester A. Arthur's sister Mary Arthur McElroy and Cleveland's sister Rose Cleveland. Some presidents have also had family members temporarily step in while their wives were temporarily unable to fulfill the duties of first lady. This included Susan Ford, who would assist her father with hostess duties while her mother, Betty Ford, was recovering from breast cancer.\nPotential male title.\nEach of the 45 presidents of the United States have been men, and all have either had their wives, or a female hostess, assume the role of first lady. Thus, a male equivalent of the title of first lady has never been needed.\nIn 2016, as Hillary Clinton became the first woman to win a major party's presidential nomination, questions were raised as to what her husband Bill Clinton would be titled if she were to win the presidency. During the campaign, the title of First Gentleman of the United States was most frequently suggested for Bill Clinton, although as a former president himself, he might have been called \"Mr. President\". In addition, state governors' male spouses are typically called the first gentleman of their respective state (for example, Michael Haley was the first gentleman of South Carolina while his wife, Nikki, served as governor). Ultimately, Hillary Clinton lost the election, rendering this a moot point.\nIn 2021, Kamala Harris took office as vice president, making her husband Doug Emhoff the first male spouse of a nationally elected officeholder in the United States. Emhoff assumed the title of second gentleman of the United States (\"gentleman\" replacing \"lady\" in the title) making it likely that any future male spouse of a president will be given the title of first gentleman. Harris would later go on to replace President Joe Biden as the Democratic presidential nominee in the 2024 presidential election. Had Harris' presidential campaign been successful, Emhoff would presumably have been granted the title of first gentleman. However, Harris lost the election, again rendering this a moot point.\nRole.\nThe role of the first lady is neither an elected nor appointed one and is not a position within the United States Government, carrying only ceremonial duties. Nonetheless, first ladies have held a highly visible position in American society. The role of the first lady has evolved over the centuries. She is, first and foremost, the hostess of the White House. She organizes and attends official ceremonies and functions of state either along with, or in place of, the president. Lisa Burns identifies four successive main themes of the first ladyship: as public woman (1900\u20131929); as political celebrity (1932\u20131961); as political activist (1964\u20131977); and as political interloper (1980\u20132001).\nMartha Washington created the role and hosted many affairs of state at the national capital (New York and Philadelphia). This socializing became known as the Republican Court and provided elite women with opportunities to play backstage political roles. Both Martha Washington and Abigail Adams were treated as if they were \"ladies\" of the British royal court.\nDolley Madison popularized the first ladyship by engaging in efforts to assist orphans and women, by dressing in elegant fashions and attracting newspaper coverage, and by risking her life to save iconic treasures during the War of 1812. Madison set the standard for the ladyship and her actions were the model for nearly every first lady until Eleanor Roosevelt in the 1930s. Roosevelt traveled widely and spoke to many groups, often voicing personal opinions to the left of the president's. She authored a weekly newspaper column and hosted a radio show. Jacqueline Kennedy led an effort to redecorate and restore the White House.\nMany first ladies became significant fashion trendsetters. Some have exercised a degree of political influence by virtue of being an important advisor to the president.\nOver the course of the 20th century, it became increasingly common for first ladies to select specific causes to promote, usually ones that are not politically divisive. It is common for the first lady to hire a staff to support these activities. Lady Bird Johnson pioneered environmental protection and beautification. Pat Nixon encouraged volunteerism and traveled extensively abroad; Betty Ford supported women's rights; Rosalynn Carter aided those with mental disabilities; Nancy Reagan founded the Just Say No drug awareness campaign; Barbara Bush promoted literacy; Hillary Clinton sought to reform the healthcare system in the U.S.; Laura Bush supported women's rights groups, and encouraged childhood literacy. Michelle Obama became identified with supporting military families and tackling childhood obesity; and Jill Biden focused her support on military families and White House history. The current first lady Melania Trump has used her position to help children, including prevention of cyberbullying and support for those whose lives are affected by drugs. She has also used her position as first lady to fight against non-consensual intimate imagery (\"revenge porn\") or deepfakes posted to online sites and social media applications, typically made with assistance through artificial intelligence, which helped influence the passing of the TAKE IT DOWN Act.\nSince 1964, the incumbent and all living former first ladies are honorary members of the board of trustees of the National Cultural Center, the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts.\nNear the end of her husband's presidency, Hillary Clinton became the first first lady to seek political office, when she ran for United States Senate. During the campaign, her daughter Chelsea took over much of the first lady's role. Victorious, Clinton served as junior senator from New York from 2001 to 2009, when she resigned to become President Obama's secretary of state. Later, she was the Democratic Party nominee for president in the 2016 election, but lost to Donald Trump.\nSome first ladies have taken on larger roles in their husbands' administrations. Hillary Clinton played a prominent role in shaping public healthcare policy. Others, like Rosalynn Carter, regularly attended Cabinet meetings, often sitting quietly in the back of the room. More recently, Jill Biden has also participated in Cabinet meetings, stitting at the cabinet table alongside Cabinet officers.\nOffice of the First Lady.\nThe Office of the First Lady of the United States is accountable to the first lady for her to carry out her duties as hostess of the White House, and is also in charge of all social and ceremonial events of the White House. The first lady has her own staff that includes a chief of staff, press secretary, White House social secretary, and chief floral designer. The Office of the First Lady is an entity of the White House Office, a branch of the Executive Office of the President. When First Lady Hillary Clinton decided to pursue a run for Senator of New York, she set aside her duties as first lady and moved to Chappaqua, New York, to establish state residency. She resumed her duties as first lady after winning her senatorial campaign, and retained her duties as both first lady and a U.S. senator for the seventeen-day overlap before Bill Clinton's term came to an end.\nCollections.\nEstablished in 1912, the First Ladies Collection has been one of the most popular attractions at the Smithsonian Institution. The original exhibition opened in 1914 and was one of the first at the Smithsonian to prominently feature women. Originally focused largely on fashion, the exhibition now delves deeper into the contributions of first ladies to the and American society. In 2008, \"First Ladies at the Smithsonian\" opened at the National Museum of American History as part of its reopening year celebration. That exhibition served as a bridge to the museum's expanded exhibition on first ladies' history that opened on November 19, 2011. \"The First Ladies\" explores the unofficial but important position of first lady and the ways that different women have shaped the role to make their own contributions to the presidential administrations and the nation. The exhibition features 26 dresses and more than 160 other objects, ranging from those of Martha Washington to Melania Trump, and includes White House china, personal possessions and other objects from the Smithsonian's unique collection of first ladies' materials.\nInfluence.\nSome first ladies have garnered attention for their dress and style. Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis, for instance, became a global fashion icon: her style was copied by commercial manufacturers and imitated by many young women, and she was named to the International Best Dressed List Hall of Fame in 1965. Mamie Eisenhower was named one of the twelve best-dressed women in the country by the New York Dress Institute every year that she was First Lady. The \"Mamie Look\" involved a full-skirted dress, charm bracelets, pearls, little hats, and bobbed, banged hair. Michelle Obama also received significant attention for her fashion choices: style writer Robin Givhan praised her in \"The Daily Beast\", arguing that the First Lady's style had helped to enhance the public image of the office.\nCauses and initiatives.\nSince the 1920s, many first ladies have become public speakers, adopting specific causes. It also became common for the first lady to hire a staff to support her agenda. Recent causes of the first lady are:\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He also wrote short stories and worked as a newspaper journalist, photographer, book reviewer, ecological consultant, and lecturer.\n\"Dune\" is the best-selling science fiction novel of all time, and the series is a classic of the science-fiction genre. The series has been adapted numerous times, including the feature film David Lynch's \"Dune\" (1984), the miniseries \"Frank Herbert's Dune\" (2000) and \"Children of Dune\" (2003), and a motion picture trilogy currently in production, with Denis Villeneuve's \"Dune\" (2021) and \"\" (2024) having been released.\nBiography.\nEarly life.\nFranklin Patrick Herbert Jr. was born on October 8, 1920, in Tacoma, Washington, to Franklin Patrick Herbert Sr. and Eileen (n\u00e9e McCarthy) Herbert. His paternal grandparents had come west in 1905 to join Burley Colony in Kitsap County, one of many utopian communes springing up in Washington State beginning in the 1890s. His upbringing included spending a lot of time on the rural Olympic and Kitsap Peninsulas. He was fascinated by books, could read much of the newspaper before the age of five, had an excellent memory, and learned quickly. He had an early interest in photography, buying a Kodak box camera at age ten, a new folding camera in his early teens, and a color film camera in the mid-1930s. Due to his parents' drinking, he ran away from home with his little sister, 5-year-old Patricia Lou, in 1938 to live with Frank's favorite maternal aunt, Peggy \"Violet\" Rowntree, and her husband, Ken Rowntree, Sr. Within weeks, Patricia moved back home. But Frank, 18, remained with his aunt and uncle.\nEducation.\nHe enrolled in high school at Salem High School (now North Salem High School), where he graduated the next year. In 1939, his parents and sister had moved to Los Angeles, California, so Frank followed them. He lied about his age to get his first newspaper job at the \"Glendale Star\". Herbert then returned to Salem in 1940 where he worked for the \"Oregon Statesman\" newspaper (now \"Statesman Journal\") in a variety of positions, including photographer.\nHerbert married Flora Lillian Parkinson in San Pedro, California, in 1941. They had one daughter, Penelope (b. February 16, 1942), and divorced in 1943. During 1942, after the U.S. entry into World War II, he served in the U.S. Navy's Seabees for six months as a photographer, but suffered a head injury and was given a medical discharge. Herbert subsequently moved to Portland, Oregon where he reported for \"The Oregon Journal\".\nAfter the war, Herbert attended the University of Washington, where he met Beverly Ann Stuart at a creative writing class in 1946. They were the only students who had sold any work for publication; Herbert had sold two pulp adventure stories to magazines, the first to \"Esquire\" in 1945 titled \"Survival of the Cunning\", and Stuart had sold a story to \"Modern Romance\" magazine. They married in Seattle in 1946, and had two sons, Brian (b. 1947) and Bruce Calvin Herbert who died from AIDS-related pneumonia (1951\u20131993). In 1949 Herbert and his wife moved to California to work on the Santa Rosa \"Press-Democrat\". Here they befriended the psychologists Ralph and Irene Slattery. The Slatterys introduced Herbert to the work of several thinkers who would influence his writing, including Freud, Jung, Jaspers and Heidegger; they also familiarized Herbert with Zen Buddhism.\nHerbert never graduated from college. According to his son Brian, he wanted to study only what interested him and so did not complete the required curriculum. He returned to journalism and worked at the \"Seattle Star\" and the \"Oregon Statesman\". He was a writer and editor for the \"San Francisco Examiner\"'s \"California Living\" magazine for a decade.\nEarly career.\nIn a 1973 interview, Herbert stated that he had been reading science fiction \"about ten years\" before he began writing in the genre, and he listed his favorite authors as H. G. Wells, Robert A. Heinlein, Poul Anderson and Jack Vance.\nHerbert's first science fiction story, \"Looking for Something\", was published in the April 1952 issue of \"Startling Stories\", then a monthly edited by Samuel Mines. Three more of his stories appeared in 1954 issues of \"Astounding Science Fiction\" and \"Amazing Stories\". His career as a novelist began in 1955 with the serial publication of \"Under Pressure\" in \"Astounding\" from November 1955; afterward it was issued as a book by Doubleday titled \"The Dragon in the Sea\". The story explored sanity and madness in the environment of a 21st-century submarine and predicted worldwide conflicts over oil consumption and production. It was a critical success but not a major commercial one. During this time Herbert also worked as a speechwriter for Republican senator Guy Cordon.\n\"Dune\".\nHerbert began researching \"Dune\" in 1959. He was able to devote himself wholeheartedly to his writing career because his wife returned to work full-time as an advertising writer for department stores, becoming their breadwinner during the 1960s. The novel \"Dune\" was published in 1965, which spearheaded the \"Dune\" franchise. He later told Willis E. McNelly that the novel originated when he was assigned to write a magazine article about sand dunes in the Oregon Dunes near Florence, Oregon. He got overinvolved and ended up with far more raw material than needed for an article; while the article was never written, it planted in Herbert the seed that would become \"Dune\".\n\"Dune\" took six years of research and writing to complete, and was much longer than other commercial science fiction of the time. Herbert's environmental work in Oregon formed the basis of the speculative ecological work of the Fremen, which parallels real-world efforts and tactics of sand dune management. \"Analog\" (formerly \"Astounding\", but still edited by John W. Campbell) published it in two parts comprising eight installments, \"Dune World\" from December 1963 and \"Prophet of Dune\" in 1965. It was then rejected by nearly twenty book publishers. One editor prophetically wrote, \"I might be making the mistake of the decade, but...\"\nSterling E. Lanier, an editor of Chilton Book Company (known mainly for its auto-repair manuals), had read the Dune serials and offered a $7,500 advance plus future royalties for the rights to publish them as a hardcover book. Herbert rewrote much of his text.\n\"Dune\" was soon a critical success. It won the Nebula Award for Best Novel in 1965 and shared the Hugo Award in 1966 with \"...And Call Me Conrad\" by Roger Zelazny.\n\"Dune\" was not an immediate bestseller, although by 1968 Herbert had made $20,000 from it, far more than most science fiction novels of the time. It was not, however, enough to let him take up full-time writing. The publication of \"Dune\" did open doors for him; he was the \"Seattle Post-Intelligencer\"'s education writer from 1969 to 1972 and lecturer in general studies and interdisciplinary studies at the University of Washington (1970\u20131972). He worked in Vietnam and Pakistan as a social and ecological consultant in 1972, and in 1973 he was director-photographer of the television show \"The Tillers\".\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;I don't worry about inspiration or anything like that... later, coming back and reading what I have produced, I am unable to detect the difference between what came easily and when I had to sit down and say, \"Well, now it's writing time and now I'll write.\"\u2014\u200a\nBy the end of 1972, Herbert had retired from newspaper writing and became a full-time fiction writer. During the 1970s and 1980s, he enjoyed considerable commercial success as an author. He divided his time between homes in Hawaii and Washington's Olympic Peninsula; his home in Port Townsend on the peninsula was intended to be an \"ecological demonstration project\". During this time he wrote numerous books and pushed ecological and philosophical ideas. He continued his \"Dune\" saga with \"Dune Messiah\" (1969), \"Children of Dune\" (1976), \"God Emperor of Dune\" (1981), \"Heretics of Dune\" (1984) and \"\" (1985). Herbert planned to write a seventh novel to conclude the series, but his death in 1986 left storylines unresolved.\nOther works by Herbert include \"The Godmakers\" (1972), \"The Dosadi Experiment\" (1977), \"The White Plague\" (1982) and the books he wrote in partnership with Bill Ransom: \"The Jesus Incident\" (1979), \"The Lazarus Effect\" (1983) and \"The Ascension Factor\" (1988), which were sequels to Herbert's 1966 novel \"\". He also helped launch the career of Terry Brooks with a very positive review of Brooks' first novel, \"The Sword of Shannara\", in 1977.\nSuccess, family changes, and death.\nHerbert's change in fortune was shadowed by tragedy. In 1974, his wife Beverly underwent treatment for lung cancer. She lived ten more years, but her health was adversely affected by the treatment. In October 1978, Herbert was the featured speaker at the Octocon II science fiction convention held at the El Rancho Tropicana in Santa Rosa, California. In 1979, he met anthropologist Jim Funaro with whom he conceived the Contact Conference. In June 1981, Herbert was a guest of honour at Advention '81 in Adelaide, South Australia. Beverly Herbert died on February 7, 1984. Herbert completed and published \"Heretics of Dune\" that year. In his afterword to 1985's \"\", Herbert included a dedication to Beverly.\nThe year 1984 was a tumultuous year in Herbert's life. During this same year of his wife's death, his career took off with the release of David Lynch's film version of \"Dune\". Despite high expectations, a big-budget production design and an A-list cast, the movie drew mostly poor reviews in the United States. However, despite a disappointing response in the US, the film was a critical and commercial success in Europe and Japan.\nIn 1985, after Beverly's death, Herbert married his former Putnam representative Theresa Shackleford. The same year he published \"Chapterhouse: Dune\", which tied up many of the saga's story threads. This would be Herbert's final single work (the collection \"Eye\" was published that year, and \"Man of Two Worlds\" was published in 1986). He died of a massive pulmonary embolism while recovering from surgery for pancreatic cancer on February 11, 1986, in Madison, Wisconsin, aged 65.\nPolitical views.\nHerbert was a Republican and an environmentalist. His political views have been variously described as conservative, reactionist, and libertarian. Herbert was politically active within the Republican Party, and worked as a speechwriter for several politicians, including Senator Guy Cordon. Herbert also volunteered on the campaign of Republican William Bantz in the 1958 Washington Senate election, who unsuccessfully challenged the incumbent Democrat Henry M. Jackson.\nHerbert was a critic of the Soviet Union. He was a distant relative of the Republican senator Joseph McCarthy, whom he referred to as \"Cousin Joe\". However, he was appalled to learn of McCarthy's blacklisting of suspected communists from working in certain careers and believed that he was endangering essential freedoms of citizens of the United States. Herbert also opposed American involvement in the war in Vietnam. He was also critical of welfare, arguing that it increased dependence on the state.\nHerbert believed that governments lie to protect themselves and that, following the Watergate scandal, President Richard Nixon had unwittingly taught an important lesson in not trusting government. He considered Nixon a better president than John F. Kennedy, calling the latter \"one of the most dangerous presidents this country ever had.\" He praised President Ronald Reagan, for his pro-family and pro-individualist stances, while opposing his foreign policy.\nIn \"Chapterhouse: Dune\", he wrote:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;All governments suffer a recurring problem: Power attracts pathological personalities. It is not that power corrupts but that it is magnetic to the corruptible. Such people have a tendency to become drunk on violence, a condition to which they are quickly addicted. \u2014\u200aFrank Herbert believed civil service to be \"one of the most serious errors we made as a democracy\" and that bureaucracy negatively impacts the lives of people in all forms of government. He stated that \"every such bureaucracy eventually becomes an aristocracy\" and uses preferential treatment and nepotism in favor of bureaucrats as his main arguments.\nIdeas and themes.\nFrank Herbert used his science fiction novels to explore complex ideas involving philosophy, religion, psychology, politics and ecology. The underlying thrust of his work was a fascination with the question of human survival and evolution. Herbert has attracted a dedicated fan base, many of whom have attempted to read everything he wrote (fiction or non-fiction); indeed, such was the devotion of some of his readers that Herbert was at times asked if he was founding a cult, a proposition which he very much rejected.\nThere are a number of key themes found in Herbert's work:\nFrank Herbert refrained from offering his readers formulaic answers to many of the questions he explored.\nStatus and influence on science fiction.\n\"Dune\" and the \"Dune\" saga constitute one of the world's best-selling science fiction series and novels; \"Dune\" in particular has received widespread critical acclaim, winning the Nebula Award in 1965 and sharing the Hugo Award in 1966, and is frequently considered one of the best science fiction novels ever, if not the best. \"Locus\" subscribers voted it the all-time best SF novel in 1975, again in 1987, and the best \"before 1990\" in 1998.\n\"Dune\" is considered a landmark novel for a number of reasons:\nHerbert never again equalled the critical acclaim he received for \"Dune\". Neither his sequels to \"Dune\" nor any of his other books won a Hugo or Nebula Award, although almost all of them were \"New York Times\" Best Sellers.\nMalcolm Edwards wrote, in \"The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction\":\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Much of Herbert's work makes difficult reading. His ideas were genuinely developed concepts, not merely decorative notions, but they were sometimes embodied in excessively complicated plots and articulated in prose which did not always match the level of thinking [...] His best novels, however, were the work of a speculative intellect with few rivals in modern science fiction.\nThe Science Fiction Hall of Fame inducted Herbert in 2006.\nCalifornia State University, Fullerton's Pollack Library has several of Herbert's draft manuscripts of \"Dune\" and other works, with the author's notes, in their Frank Herbert Archives.\nMetro Parks Tacoma built Dune Peninsula and the Frank Herbert Trail at Point Defiance Park in July 2019 to honor the hometown writer.\nBibliography.\nPosthumously published works.\nBeginning in 2012, Herbert's estate and WordFire Press have released four previously unpublished novels in e-book and paperback formats: \"High-Opp\" (2012), \"Angels' Fall\" (2013), \"A Game of Authors\" (2013), and \"A Thorn in the Bush\" (2014).\nIn recent years, Frank Herbert's son Brian Herbert and author Kevin J. Anderson have added to the \"Dune\" franchise, using notes left behind by Frank Herbert and discovered over a decade after his death. Brian Herbert and Anderson have written three prequel trilogies (\"Prelude to Dune\", \"Legends of Dune\" and \"Great Schools of Dune\") exploring the history of the \"Dune\" universe before the events of the original novel, two novels that take place between novels of the original \"Dune\" sequels (with plans for more), as well as two post-\"Chapterhouse Dune\" novels that complete the original series (\"Hunters of Dune\" and \"Sandworms of Dune\") based on Frank Herbert's own \"Dune 7\" outline.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Typically they are the creation of one individual, while natural languages evolve out of a particular culture or people group, and other conlangs may have group involvement. Fictional languages are also distinct from natural languages in that they have no native speakers. By contrast, the constructed language of Esperanto now has native speakers.\nFictional languages are intended to be the languages of a fictional world and are often designed with the intent of giving more depth, and an appearance of plausibility, to the fictional worlds with which they are associated. The goal of the author may be to have their characters communicate in a fashion which is both alien and dislocated. Within their fictional world, these languages do function as natural languages, helping to identify certain races or people groups and set them apart from others.\nWhile some less-formed fictional languages are created as distorted versions or dialects of a pre-existing natural language, many are independently designed conlangs with their own lexicon (some more robust than others) and rules of grammar. Some of the latter are fully formed enough to be learned as a speakable language, and many subcultures exist of those who are 'fluent' in one or more of these fictional languages. Often after the creator of a fictional language has accomplished their task, the fandom of that fictional universe will pick up where the creator left off and continue to flesh out the language, making it more like a natural language and therefore more usable.\nPurpose.\nFictional languages are separated from artistic languages by both purpose and relative completion: a fictional language often has the least amount of grammar and vocabulary possible, and rarely extends beyond the absolutely necessary. At the same time, some others have developed languages in detail for their own sake, such as J. R. R. Tolkien's Quenya and Sindarin (two Elvish languages), \"Star Trek\"'s Klingon language and \"Avatar\"'s Na'vi language which exist as functioning, usable languages.\nBy analogy with the word \"conlang\", the term \"conworld\" is used to describe these fictional worlds, inhabited by fictional constructed cultures. The conworld influences vocabulary (what words the language will have for flora and fauna, articles of clothing, objects of technology, religious concepts, names of places and tribes, etc.), as well as influencing other factors such as pronouns, or how their cultures view the break-off points between colors or the gender and age of family members. Sound is also a directing factor, as creators seek to show their audience through phonology the type of race or people group to whom the language belongs.\nCommercial fictional languages.\nCommercial fictional languages are those languages created for use in various commercial media, such as:\nWhile some languages are created purely from the desire of the creator, language creation can be a profession. In 1974, Victoria Fromkin was the first person hired to create a language (\"Land of the Lost\"'s Paku). Since then, notable professional language creators have included Marc Okrand (Klingon), David Peterson (Dothraki and others in \"Game of Thrones\"), and Paul Frommer (Na'vi).\nAlien languages.\nA notable subgenre of fictional languages are alien languages, the ones that are used or might be used by putative extraterrestrial life forms. Alien languages are subject of both science fiction and scientific research. Perhaps the most fully developed fictional alien language is the Klingon language of the \"Star Trek\" universe \u2013 a fully developed constructed language.\nThe problem of alien language has confronted generations of science fiction writers; some have created fictional languages for their characters to use, while others have circumvented the problem through translation devices or other fantastic technology. For example, the \"Star Trek\" universe makes use of a \"universal translator\", which explains why such different races, often meeting for the first time, are able to communicate with each other. Another more humorous example would be the Babel fish from \"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy\", an aurally-inserted fish that instantaneously translates alien speech to the speaker's native language.\nWhile in many cases an alien language is but an element of a fictional reality, in a number of science fiction works the core of the plot involves linguistic and psychological problems of communication between various alien species.\nVisual alien languages.\nA further subgenre of alien languages are those that are visual, rather than auditory. Notable examples of this type are Sherman's Circular Gallifreyan from BBC's \"Doctor Who\" series and the heptapod's written language, which is distinct from their spoken language, from the 2016 film \"Arrival\".\nInternet-based fictional languages.\nInternet-based fictional languages are hosted along with their \"conworlds\" on the internet, and based at these sites, becoming known to the world through the visitors to these sites. Verdurian, the language of Mark Rosenfelder's Verduria on the planet of Almea, is an Internet-based fictional language.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "10854", "revid": "37698590", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=10854", "title": "Formula One", "text": "Motorsport championship held worldwide\nFormula One (F1) is the highest class of worldwide racing for open-wheel, single-seater formula racing cars sanctioned by the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA). The FIA Formula One World Championship has been one of the world's premier forms of motorsport since its inaugural running in 1950 and is often considered to be the pinnacle of motorsport. The word \"formula\" in the name refers to the set of rules all participant cars must follow. A Formula One season consists of a series of races, known as Grands Prix. Grands Prix take place in multiple countries and continents on either purpose-built circuits or closed roads.\nA points scoring system is used at Grands Prix to determine two annual World Championships: one for the drivers, and one for the constructors\u2014now synonymous with teams. Each driver must hold a valid Super Licence, the highest class of racing licence the FIA issues, and the races must be held on Grade One tracks, the highest grade rating the FIA issues for tracks.\nFormula One cars are the world's fastest regulated road-course racing cars, owing to high cornering speeds achieved by generating large amounts of aerodynamic downforce, most of which is generated by front and rear wings, as well as underbody tunnels. The cars depend on electronics, aerodynamics, suspension, and tyres. Traction control, launch control, automatic shifting, and other electronic driving aids were first banned in . They were briefly reintroduced in but were banned once more in and later .\nWith the average annual cost of running a team\u2014e.g., designing, building, and maintaining cars; staff payroll; transport\u2014at approximately million as of 2018 (though the cost cap stands at million), Formula One's financial and political battles are widely reported. The Formula One Group is owned by Liberty Media, which acquired it in 2017 for billion. The United Kingdom is the hub of Formula One racing, with six out of the ten teams based there.\nHistory.\nFormula One originated from the World Manufacturers' Championship (1925\u20131930) and European Drivers' Championship (1931\u20131939). The \"formula\" is a set of rules that all participants' cars must follow. Formula One was a formula agreed upon in 1946 to officially become effective in 1947. The first Grand Prix in accordance with the new regulations was the 1946 Turin Grand Prix, anticipating the formula's official start. Before World War II, a number of Grand Prix racing organisations made suggestions for a new championship to replace the European Championship, but due to the suspension of racing during the conflict, the new International Formula for cars did not become formalised until 1946, to become effective in 1947. The new World Championship was instituted to commence in 1950.\nThe first world championship race, the 1950 British Grand Prix, took place at Silverstone Circuit in the United Kingdom on 13\u00a0May 1950. Giuseppe Farina, competing for Alfa Romeo, won the first Drivers' World Championship, narrowly defeating his teammate Juan Manuel Fangio. Fangio won the championship in , , , , and . This set the record for the most World Championships won by a single driver, a record that stood for 46 years until Michael Schumacher won his sixth championship in 2003.\nA Constructors' Championship was added in the 1958 season. Stirling Moss, despite often being regarded as one of the greatest Formula One drivers in the 1950s and 1960s, never won the Formula One championship. Between 1955 and 1961, Moss finished second in the championship four times and third the other three times. Fangio won 24 of the 52 races he entered\u2014still the record for the highest Formula One winning percentage by an individual driver.\nPromoters also held races following Formula One regulations outside the championship for many years. These events often took place on circuits that were not always suitable for the World Championship and featured local cars and drivers as well as those competing in the championship. For example, South Africa's domestic Formula One championship from 1960 to 1975 used locally built or modified cars in addition to recently retired world championship cars. Similarly, the British Formula One Championship utilised second-hand cars from manufacturers like Lotus and Fittipaldi Automotive fitted with DFV from 1978 to 1980. The increasing cost of competition, however, made such competitions less common in the 1970s. 1983 saw the last non-championship Formula One race; the 1983 Race of Champions at Brands Hatch, won by reigning World Champion Keke Rosberg in a Williams-Cosworth in a close fight with American Danny Sullivan.\nTechnological developments.\nThe first major technological development in the series was Bugatti's introduction of mid-engined cars. Jack Brabham, the world champion in , , and , soon proved the mid-engine's superiority over all other engine positions. By , all teams had switched to mid-engined cars. The Ferguson P99, a four-wheel drive design, was the last front-engined Formula One car to enter a world championship race. It entered the 1961 British Grand Prix, the only front-engined car to compete that year.\nIn , Lotus introduced a car with an aluminium-sheet monocoque chassis instead of the traditional space-frame design. This proved to be the greatest technological breakthrough since the introduction of mid-engined cars.\nIn , sponsorship was introduced to the sport. Team Gunston became the first team to run cigarette sponsorship on its Brabham cars, which privately entered in orange, brown, and gold colours of Gunston cigarettes in the 1968 South African Grand Prix on 1\u00a0January 1968. Five months later, Lotus, initially using the British racing green, followed this example when it entered its cars painted in the red, gold, and white colours of Imperial Tobacco's Gold Leaf livery at the 1968 Spanish Grand Prix.\nAerodynamic downforce slowly gained importance in car design with the appearance of aerofoils during the 1968 season. The wings were introduced by Lotus's owner, Colin Chapman, who installed modest front wings and a rear spoiler on his Lotus 49B at the 1968 Monaco Grand Prix. In the late 1970s, Lotus introduced ground-effect aerodynamics, previously used on Jim Hall's Chaparral 2J in 1970, that provided enormous downforce and greatly increased cornering speeds. The aerodynamic forces pressing the cars to the track were up to five times the car's weight. As a result, extremely stiff springs were needed to maintain a constant ride height, leaving the suspension virtually solid. This meant that the drivers depended entirely on the tyres for any small amount of cushioning of the car and driver from irregularities of the road surface.\nBig business.\nBeginning in the 1970s, Bernie Ecclestone rearranged the management of Formula One's commercial rights; he is widely credited with transforming the series into the multi-billion dollar business it now is. When Ecclestone bought the Brabham team in 1971, he gained a seat on the Formula One Constructors' Association, and in 1978, he became its president. Previously, the circuit owners controlled the income of the teams and negotiated with each individually; Ecclestone persuaded the teams to \"hunt as a pack\" through FOCA. He offered Formula One to circuit owners as a package they could take or leave. In return for the package, almost all that was required was to surrender trackside advertising.\nThe formation of the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale du Sport Automobile (FISA) in 1979 set off the FISA\u2013FOCA war, during which FISA and its president, Jean-Marie Balestre, argued repeatedly with FOCA over television revenues and technical regulations. \"The Guardian\" said that Ecclestone and Max Mosley \"used [FOCA] to wage a guerrilla war with a very long-term aim in view\". FOCA threatened to establish a rival series and boycotted a Grand Prix, and FISA withdrew its sanction from races. The result was the 1981 Concorde Agreement, which guaranteed technical stability, as teams were to be given reasonable notice of new regulations. The teams signed a second Concorde Agreement in 1992 and a third in 1997.\nFISA imposed a ban on ground-effect aerodynamics from . But by then, turbocharged engines, which Renault had pioneered in , were producing over and were essential to be competitive. By , a BMW turbocharged engine achieved a flash reading of pressure, estimated to be over in qualifying for the Italian Grand Prix. The next year, power in race trim reached around , with boost pressure limited to only . These cars were the most powerful open-wheel circuit racing cars ever. To reduce engine power output and thus speeds, the FIA limited fuel tank capacity in , and boost pressures in , before banning turbocharged engines completely in .\nThe development of electronic driver aids began in the 1980s. Lotus began to develop a system of active suspension, which first appeared in 1983 on the Lotus 92. By 1987, this system had been perfected and was driven to victory by Ayrton Senna in the Monaco Grand Prix that year. In the early 1990s, other teams followed suit, and semi-automatic gearboxes and traction control were a natural progression. The FIA, due to complaints that technology was determining races' outcomes more than driver skill, banned many such aids for the season. This resulted in cars that previously depended on electronic aids becoming very \"twitchy\" and difficult to drive. Observers felt the ban on driver aids was in name only, as they \"proved difficult to police effectively\".\nThe rivalry between Ayrton Senna and Alain Prost became F1's central focus in and continued until Prost retired at the end of . Senna died at the 1994 San Marino Grand Prix after crashing into a wall on the exit of the Tamburello curve. Roland Ratzenberger also died in an accident during Saturday qualifying that weekend.\nSince Senna's and Ratzenberger's deaths, the FIA has used safety as a reason to impose rule changes that otherwise, under the Concorde Agreement, would have had to be agreed upon by all the teams. The resultant 'narrow track' era from onwards, resulted in cars with smaller rear tyres, a narrower track overall, and the introduction of grooved tyres to reduce mechanical grip. According to the FIA, the objective behind this decision was to reduce cornering speeds and produce racing similar to rainy conditions by enforcing a smaller contact patch between the tyre and the track.\nNo driver died of injuries sustained on the track at the wheel of a Formula One car for 20 years until the 2014 Japanese Grand Prix, where Jules Bianchi collided with a recovery vehicle after aquaplaning off the circuit, dying nine months later from his injuries.\nManufacturers' return.\n Michael Schumacher and Ferrari won five consecutive Drivers' Championships and six consecutive Constructors' Championships. Schumacher set many new records, including those for Grand Prix wins, wins in a season, and most Drivers' Championships. Schumacher's championship streak ended on 25\u00a0September 2005, when Renault driver Fernando Alonso became Formula One's youngest champion at that time (until Lewis Hamilton in and followed by Sebastian Vettel in 2010). In 2006, Renault and Alonso won both titles again. Schumacher retired at the end of 2006 after 16 years in Formula One, but came out of retirement for the 2010 season, racing for the newly formed Mercedes works team, following the rebrand of Brawn GP.\nDuring this period, FIA frequently changed the championship rules with the intention of improving the on-track action and cutting costs. Team orders, legal since the championship started in 1950, were banned in 2002, after several incidents in which teams openly manipulated race results, generating negative publicity, most famously by Ferrari at the 2002 Austrian Grand Prix. Other changes included the qualifying format, the point-scoring system, the technical regulations, and rules specifying how long engines and tyres must last. A 'tyre war' between suppliers Michelin and Bridgestone saw lap times fall. At the 2005 United States Grand Prix at Indianapolis, seven out of ten teams did not race when their Michelin tyres were deemed unsafe for use, leading to Bridgestone becoming the sole tyre supplier to Formula One for the 2007 season by default. On 20\u00a0December 2007, Bridgestone signed a contract that officially made it the exclusive tyre supplier for the next three seasons.\nManufacturers' decline and return of the privateers.\nIn 2008 and 2009, Honda, BMW, and Toyota all withdrew from Formula One racing within a year, blaming the economic recession. This resulted in the end of manufacturer dominance of the sport. The Honda F1 team went through a management buyout to become Brawn GP, with Ross Brawn and Nick Fry running and owning the majority of the organisation. Brawn GP laid off hundreds of employees, but won the year's world championships. BMW F1 was bought out by the original founder of the team, Peter Sauber. The Lotus F1 Team was another, formerly manufacturer-owned team that reverted to \"privateer\" ownership, together with the buy-out of the Renault team by Genii Capital investors. A link with its previous owners, however, still survived, with its car continuing to be powered by a Renault engine until 2018.\nMcLaren also announced that it was to reacquire the shares in its team from Mercedes-Benz. McLaren's partnership with Mercedes was reported to have started to sour after the former was guilty of spying on Ferrari. Hence, during the 2010 season, Mercedes-Benz re-entered the series as a manufacturer after it purchased Brawn GP and split with McLaren after 15 seasons with the team.\nDuring the season, Formula One was gripped by the FIA\u2013FOTA dispute. FIA President Max Mosley proposed numerous cost-cutting measures for the next season, including an optional budget cap for the teams; teams electing to take the budget cap would be granted greater technical freedom, adjustable front and rear wings, and an engine not subject to a rev limiter. The Formula One Teams Association (FOTA) believed that allowing some teams to have such technical freedom would have created a two-tier championship, and thus requested urgent talks with the FIA. Talks broke down and the FOTA teams, with the exception of Williams and Force India, announced that 'they had no choice' but to form a breakaway championship series.\nOn 24 June, Formula One's governing body and the teams reached an agreement to prevent a breakaway series. It was agreed that teams must cut spending to the level of the early 1990s within two years; exact figures were not specified, and Max Mosley agreed he would not stand for reelection to the FIA presidency in October. Following further disagreements, after Mosley suggested he would stand for reelection, FOTA made it clear that breakaway plans were still being pursued. On 8\u00a0July, FOTA issued a press release stating it had been informed it was not entered for the 2010 season, and an FIA press release said the FOTA representatives had walked out of the meeting. On 1\u00a0August, it was announced that the FIA and FOTA had signed a new Concorde Agreement, bringing an end to the crisis and securing the sport's future until 2012.\nTo compensate for the loss of manufacturer teams, four new teams were accepted entry into the 2010 season ahead of a much anticipated 'cost-cap'. Entrants included a reborn Team Lotus\u2014led by a Malaysian consortium including Tony Fernandes, the boss of Air Asia; Hispania Racing\u2014the first Spanish Formula One team; and Virgin Racing\u2014Richard Branson's entry into the series following a successful partnership with Brawn the year before. They were also joined by the US F1 Team, which planned to run out of the United States as the only non-European-based team in the sport. Financial issues befell the squad before they even made the grid. Despite the entry of these new teams, the proposed cost-cap was repealed and these teams\u2014which did not have the budgets of the midfield and top-order teams\u2014ran around at the back of the field until they collapsed; HRT in 2012, Caterham (formerly Lotus) in 2014, and Manor (formerly Virgin, then Marussia), having survived falling into administration in 2014, at the end of 2016.\nHybrid era.\nA major rule change in saw the 2.4-litre naturally aspirated V8 engines replaced by 1.6-litre turbocharged hybrid power units. This prompted Honda to return to the series in 2015 as the championship's fourth power unit manufacturer. Mercedes emerged as the dominant force, with Lewis Hamilton winning the championship, closely followed by his main rival and teammate, Nico Rosberg, with the team winning 16 out of the 19 races that season. The team continued this form in the next two seasons, again winning 16 races in before taking a record 19 wins in 2016, with Hamilton claiming the title in the former year and Rosberg winning it in the latter by five points. The 2016 season also saw a new team, Haas, join the grid, while Max Verstappen became the youngest-ever race winner at age 18 in Spain.\nAfter revised aerodynamic regulations were introduced, the 2017 and 2018 seasons featured a title battle between Mercedes and Ferrari. Mercedes ultimately won the titles with multiple races to spare and continued to dominate until 2020. In 2021, the Honda-powered Red Bull team began to seriously challenge Mercedes, with Verstappen beating Hamilton to the Drivers' Championship after a season-long battle that saw the pair exchange the championship lead multiple times.\nThis era has seen an increase in car manufacturers' presence in the sport. After Honda's return as an engine manufacturer in 2015, Renault came back as a team in 2016 upon buying back the Lotus F1 Team. In 2018, Aston Martin and Alfa Romeo became Red Bull and Sauber's title sponsors, respectively. Sauber was rebranded as Alfa Romeo Racing for the 2019 season. Racing Point part-owner Lawrence Stroll bought a stake in Aston Martin to rebrand the Racing Point team as Aston Martin for the 2021 season. In August 2020, all ten F1 teams signed a new Concorde Agreement committing them to the sport until 2025, including a $145 million budget cap for car development to support equal competition and sustainable development.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic forced the series to adapt to budgetary and logistical limitations. A significant overhaul of the technical regulations intended to be introduced in the 2021 season was pushed back to 2022, with constructors instead using their 2020 chassis for two seasons and a token system limiting which parts could be modified introduced. The start of the season was delayed by several months, and both it and seasons were subject to several postponements, cancellations, and rescheduling of races due to shifting restrictions on international travel. Many races took place behind closed doors and with only essential personnel present to maintain social distancing.\nIn 2022, the F1 governing body announced a major rule and car design change intended to promote closer racing through the use of ground effects, new aerodynamics, larger wheels with low-profile tyres, and redesigned nose and wing regulations. Red Bull emerged as the dominant force after the rule shakeup. The 2022 and 2023 Constructors' and Drivers' Championships were won by Red Bull and Verstappen, with multiple races to spare.\nIn early 2024, the Formula One landscape underwent a significant change in the sphere of team sponsorships and collaborations. Having competed for five seasons under the Alfa Romeo name, Sauber introduced a title partnership with the online casino Stake, resulting in the team's new identity as Stake F1 Team Kick Sauber. Sauber will hold Stake's sponsorship name until the end of 2025, after which it will become the Audi works team for the 2026 season onwards. Scuderia AlphaTauri, Red Bull's junior team, dropped its name and took on sponsors from Hugo Boss and Cash App, becoming Visa Cash App RB, or VCARB for 2024. Also in 2024, Formula One announced partnerships with Mattel to release Hot Wheels die-cast cars, and with Lego, with the first new sets releasing in 2025. In early 2025, Cadillac received final approval to join the Formula One grid as an 11th team for the 2026 season onward.\nRacing and strategy.\nA Formula One Grand Prix event spans a weekend. It typically begins with two free practice sessions on Friday and one free practice session on Saturday. Additional drivers (commonly known as third drivers) are allowed to run on Fridays, but only two cars may be used per team, requiring a race driver to give up their seat. A qualifying session is held after the last free practice session. This session determines the starting order for the race on Sunday.\nTyre rules.\nEach driver is allotted four sets of intermediate tyres, three sets of wet-weather tyres and thirteen sets of dry-weather tyres for each race weekend. All unused tyres must be returned.\nQualifying.\nFor much of the sport's history, qualifying sessions differed little from practice sessions; drivers would have one or more sessions in which to set their fastest time, with the grid order determined by each driver's best single lap, with the fastest getting first place on the grid, referred to as pole position. From 1996 to 2002, the format was a one-hour shootout. Following this, the rules were changed again because the teams were not running in the early part of the session to take advantage of better track conditions later on.\nThe current qualifying format, known as \"knock-out\" qualifying, was introduced in the 2006 season. It is divided into three stages, referred to as Q1, Q2, and Q3. Drivers may complete as many laps as they choose in an attempt to progress to the next stage, with the slowest drivers being eliminated at the end of each round. Any timed lap started before the end of that period may be completed and will count toward that driver's placement. The number of cars eliminated in each session is dependent on the total number of cars entered into the championship.\nAs of 2025[ [update]], with 20 cars on the grid, Q1 runs for 18 minutes and eliminates the slowest five drivers. During this session, any driver whose best lap takes longer than 107% of the fastest time in Q1 will not be allowed to start the race without permission from the stewards. In Q2, the 15 remaining drivers have 15 minutes to set one of the ten fastest times and proceed to the next period. Finally, Q3 lasts 12 minutes and determines the first ten grid positions.\nEach car is allocated one set of the softest tyres for use in Q3. The cars that qualify for Q3 must return them after session; the cars that do not qualify for round can use them during the race. Any penalties that affect grid position are applied at the end of qualifying.\nSprints.\n2021 saw the trialling of a 'sprint qualifying' race on the Saturday of three race weekends, with the intention of testing a new approach to qualifying. The traditional qualifying would determine the starting order for the sprint, and the result of the sprint would then determine the start order for the Grand Prix. From 2023, sprint races no longer impacted the start order for the main race, which would be determined by traditional qualifying. Sprints would have their own qualifying session, titled the 'sprint shootout'. Sprint qualifying sessions are run much shorter than traditional qualifying, and each session requires teams to fit new tyres, mediums for SQ1 and SQ2, and softs for SQ3.\nRace.\nThe race begins with a warm-up lap, known as the formation lap, after which the cars assemble on the starting grid in the order they qualified. This allows drivers to check the condition of the track and their car, gives the tyres a chance to warm up to increase traction and grip, and provides the pit crews time to clear themselves and their equipment from the grid for the race start.\nOnce all the cars have formed on the grid, the medical car positions itself behind the pack. Five red lights are then illuminated at intervals of one second above the track; before being extinguished simultaneously after an unspecified time to signal the start of the race. The start procedure may be aborted in the event of a serious accident or dangerous conditions or if a driver stalls on the grid or on the track in an unsafe position, signalled by raising their arm. The race may also be started from behind the Safety Car if a racing start is considered excessively dangerous, such as in extremely heavy rainfall. There is no formation lap in such circumstances.\nThroughout the race, drivers may make pit stops to change tyres and repair damage. Three dry tyre compounds, with different durability and adhesion characteristics, are available to drivers. Under wet conditions, drivers may switch to one of two specialised wet weather tyres with additional grooves. Over the course of a race, drivers must make at least one pit stop and use two different available compounds.\nThe race typically finishes when the leader has completed the predetermined number of laps. Positions for drivers on the same lap are then determined in the order that they cross the finish line. Lapped cars that have completed at least 90% of the distance are then classified according to their relative track position and number of laps completed. Races can, however, be paused or ended early if the conditions become unsafe. In the case of suspension, a ten-minute warning is given before the race is resumed behind the safety car.\nRace director.\nThis role involves managing the logistics of each F1 Grand Prix, enforcing FIA rules and controlling the lights at the start of each race. The race director can also refer incidents to the race stewards, who may give penalties, such as drive-through penalties (or stop-and-go penalties), demotions on a pre-race start grid, race disqualifications, and fines should parties break regulations. As of the 2024 Las Vegas Grand Prix, the race director is Rui Marques, with Herbie Blash as a permanent advisor.\nSafety car.\nIn the event of an incident that risks the safety of competitors or trackside race marshals, race officials may choose to deploy the safety car. This neutralises the race, with drivers required to follow the safety car in race order at reduced speed, and overtaking is not allowed. Cars that have been lapped may, if permitted by the race director, be allowed to unlap themselves in order to ensure a smoother restart. The safety car remains on the track until the danger is cleared. After it comes in, the race restarts with a rolling start, with the leading car taking over its role until they reach the timing line. Pit stops under a safety car are permitted, and in many cases can offer a great advantage to teams who are able to pit and change tyres prior to the end of the safety car period.\nMercedes-Benz has supplied a variety of its AMG models to Formula One to use as the safety car since 1996. From 2021 onwards, Aston Martin has supplied the Vantage to share duties with Mercedes-AMGs. Since 2000, the main safety car driver has been German ex-racing driver Bernd Mayl\u00e4nder. He is usually joined by FIA technical assistant Richard Darker, who relays information between the safety car and race control.\nVirtual Safety Car (VSC).\nIn 2014, the FIA established an \"accident panel\" to investigate the circumstances surrounding Jules Bianchi's fatal crash at the Japanese Grand Prix. They were tasked with identifying measures to reduce the risk of similar incidents, particularly in situations where deploying a safety car is not justified and yellow flags alone are inadequate.\nOne of the proposed recommendations was the introduction of a Virtual Safety Car period during which drivers must keep their lap times above a pre-determined minimum, also known as keeping a positive delta. The system was first implemented during the 2015 Monaco Grand Prix.\nFlags.\nFlags specifications and usage are prescribed by Appendix H of the FIA's International Sporting Code.\nPoints system.\nVarious systems for awarding championship points have been used since 1950. The current system, in place since 2010, awards the top ten cars points in the Drivers' and Constructors' Championships, with the winner receiving 25 points. Points won at each race are added up, and the driver and constructor with the most points at the end of the season are crowned World Champions.\nA driver must be classified in order to receive points. They must complete at least 90% of the race distance in order to receive points. Therefore, it is possible for a driver to receive points even if they retired before the end of the race.\nFrom some time between the 1977 and 1980 seasons to the end of the 2021 season, if less than 75% of the race laps were completed by the winner, then only half of the points listed in the table were awarded to the drivers and constructors. The half points rule was replaced by a distance-dependent, gradual scale system for 2022.\nConstructors.\nA Formula One constructor is the entity credited for designing the chassis and the engine. If both are designed by the same company, they receive sole credit as the constructor (e.g., Ferrari). If they are designed by different companies, both are credited, with the name of the chassis designer being placed before that of the engine designer (e.g., McLaren-Mercedes). All constructors are scored individually, even if they share a chassis or engine with another constructor. Entering a new team in the Formula One World Championship requires a $450 million up-front payment to the FIA, which is then shared equally among the existing teams.\nSince , Formula One teams have been required to build the chassis in which they compete. This requirement distinguishes Formula One from series such as the IndyCar Series which allows teams to purchase chassis, and \"spec series\", like Formula 2, which require all cars be built to identical specifications. Despite this rule, however, two teams used chassis built by other teams in 2007. Super Aguri started the season using a modified Honda Racing RA106 chassis, while Scuderia Toro Rosso used the same chassis used as the parent Red Bull Racing team, which was formally designed by a separate subsidiary. The use of these loopholes was ended for 2010 with the publication of new technical regulations, which require each constructor to own the intellectual property rights to their chassis,\nNine out of the ten teams competing in Formula One have some form of base in England, in an area centred around Oxfordshire called \"Motorsport Valley\". Ferrari is the only team to not have an English presence and have both their chassis and engine assembly in Maranello, Italy. Racing Bulls is based close to Ferrari in Faenza but also has a base in Milton Keynes, whilst Sauber is based in Hinwil, Switzerland, with a \"technology centre\" in Bicester. Haas is U.S.-based and has its primary base in Kannapolis, North Carolina, with another facility in Banbury and a design office in Maranello. The Cadillac team joining the grid in 2026 is set to have bases in Fishers, Indiana, Warren, Michigan, and Silverstone.\nDrivers.\nEvery team in Formula One must run two cars in every session in a Grand Prix weekend, and every team may use up to four drivers in a season. A team may also run two additional drivers during Free Practice sessions, which are often used to test potential new drivers for a career as a Formula One driver or gain experienced drivers to evaluate the car. Most drivers are typically contracted for at least the duration of a season, with driver changes taking place in-between seasons. Recent years, however, have seen a move away from this trend, with teams replacing drivers like Daniel Ricciardo, Logan Sargeant and Jack Doohan mid-season.\nEach competitor must be in the possession of an FIA Super Licence to compete in a Grand Prix, which is issued to drivers who have met the criteria of success in junior motorsport categories and have achieved of running in a Formula One car in 2 days. Teams can also contract reserve drivers to stand in for regular drivers when necessary and develop the team's car. With the reduction in testing, however, the reserve drivers' role mainly takes places on a simulator, such as \"rFpro\", which is used by most of the F1 teams.\nEach driver chooses an unassigned number from 2 to 99 (excluding 17, which was retired following the death of Jules Bianchi) upon entering Formula One and keeps that number during their time in the series. The number one is reserved for the reigning Drivers' Champion, who retains their previous number and may choose to use it instead of the number one. At the onset of the championship, numbers were allocated by race organisers on an ad hoc basis from race to race.\nPermanent numbers were introduced for the season. Teams were allocated numbers in ascending order based on the Constructors' Championship standings at the end of the 1973 season. The teams would hold those numbers from season to season with the exception of the team with the World Drivers' Champion, which would swap its numbers with the one and two of the previous champion's team. New entrants were allocated spare numbers, with the exception of the number 13, which has only ever been used by Divina Galica and Pastor Maldonado.\nAs teams kept their numbers for long periods of time, car numbers became associated with a team, such as Ferrari's 27 and 28. A different system was used from to . At the start of each season, the current Drivers' Champion was designated number one, their teammate number two, and the rest of the teams assigned ascending numbers according to the previous season's Constructors' Championship order.\nAs of 2024[ [update]], a total of 34 separate drivers have won the World Drivers' Championship, with Michael Schumacher and Lewis Hamilton holding the record for most championships with seven. Jochen Rindt is the only posthumous World Champion, after his points total was not surpassed despite his fatal accident at the 1970 Italian Grand Prix, with 4 races still remaining in the season. Drivers from the United Kingdom have been the most successful in the sport, with 20 championships among 10 drivers and 204 wins as of 2025[ [update]].\nPhysical demands.\nDriving in Formula One is highly demanding physically with drivers typically burning around 1,000 calories per hour and losing up to 5% of their body weight per race. A key reason for the physical demands is the extreme g-force generated by driving at high speeds, with modern Formula One cars capable of generating forces of up to 6.5 \"g\"s when cornering (i.e. feeling a force equivalent to six and a half times their body weight), 6 \"g\"s when braking, and 2 \"g\"s when accelerating. Another factor is the high temperature inside the car, as the engine is mounted directly behind the driver. The temperature in the cockpit of a Formula One car can be as high as , and drivers have to wear several layers of fireproof clothing. The steering wheel and brake pedal also require considerable strength to operate. Before the introduction of power steering in the 2000s, drivers had to cope with steering forces of up to , while achieving maximum braking power requires drivers to apply around of force to the brake pedal.\nEvery extra kilogram of weight noticeably reduces a drivers performance, as such, they must be light - though a minimum limit of has been enforced by the FIA \"in the interests of well-being\". They also need to train on cardiovascular fitness since heart rates can, on average, exceed 170 bpm during a race.\nFeeder series.\nMost F1 drivers start in kart racing competitions and then progress through traditional entry level European single-seater series such as Formula Ford, Formula Renault, and Formula 4. From there, drivers typically progress to higher-level regional championships at the Formula Three level. This included championships like British F3 and European F3 historically, although similar series now hold the Formula Regional designation. In addition to this, there are also international F3 championships, including GP3 and its present-day successor, FIA F3. The highest level series on the F1 ladder is the FIA Formula 2 Championship. In the past, the top level series was GP2 (2005\u20132016), International Formula 3000 (1985\u20132004 under the Formula 3000 class), and Formula Two (1948\u20131984).\nDrivers are not required to have competed at all levels to enter Formula One. British F3 has supplied many F1 drivers, with champions, including Nigel Mansell, Ayrton Senna, and Mika H\u00e4kkinen having moved straight from that series to Formula One. Max Verstappen made his F1 debut following a single season in European F3. More rarely a driver may be picked from an even lower level, as was the case with 2007 World Champion Kimi R\u00e4ikk\u00f6nen, who went straight from Formula Renault to F1.\nAmerican open-wheel car racing has also contributed to the Formula One grid. CART champions Mario Andretti and Jacques Villeneuve became F1 World Champions, while Juan Pablo Montoya won seven races in F1.\nGrands Prix.\nThe number of Grands Prix held in a season has varied over the years. The inaugural World Championship season comprised only seven races, alongside several non-championship Formula One events. These, however, came to an end in 1983. The season contained 24 races, the highest number of World Championship races in one season.\nSix of the original seven races took place in Europe; the only non-European race that counted towards the World Championship in 1950 was the Indianapolis 500, which was held to different regulations. Some of these races pre-dated the formation of the World Championship, such as the French Grand Prix. Over time, the F1 championship gradually expanded to other non-European countries. Argentina hosted the first South American Grand Prix in , and Morocco hosted the first African Grand Prix in . Asia and Oceania followed (Japan in and Australia in ), and the first race in the Middle East was held in . The 19 races of the season were spread over every populated continent except for Africa, with 10 Grands Prix held outside Europe.\nThe British and Italian Grands Prix are the only events to have been held every Formula One season. The Monaco Grand Prix was first held in 1929 and has run continuously since 1955 (with the exception of 2020) and is widely considered to be one of the most important and prestigious automobile races in the world.\nAll Grands Prix have traditionally been run during the day, until the inaugural Singapore Grand Prix hosted the first Formula One night race in 2008, which was followed by the day\u2013night Abu Dhabi Grand Prix in 2009 and the Bahrain Grand Prix, which was converted to a night race in 2014. Other Grands Prix in Asia have had their start times adjusted to benefit the European television audience.\nContracted Grands Prix.\nThe following twenty-four Grands Prix have a contract to be hosted at the listed circuits for the season:\u00a0\nCircuits.\nFormula One races are held on Grade A tracks, the highest grade-rating issued by the FIA for tracks. Under the current regulations, circuit layouts and lap distances may vary considerably, provided that each Grand Prix covers a total race distance of . While most tracks run in a clockwise direction, there are a handful of tracks in the Championship that run anticlockwise.\nA typical circuit features a stretch of straight road on which the starting grid is situated, with the pit lane normally located right next to it. The pit lane is home to each team's garage, where cars are stored and serviced before a race. During a pit stop, drivers enter the pit lane to change their tyres, receive repairs or aerodynamic adjustments from their pit crew, or retire from the race (if the car is in a condition to do so). Prior to the 2010 season, pit stops also facilitated mid-race refueling of the cars. Special pit roads and track markings help to make sure drivers pit and rejoin the track safely.\nAs of 2025[ [update]], most of the circuits are specially constructed for competition, but the calendar also features several circuits that use converted public streets to varying degrees. These tracks include Monaco, Melbourne, Singapore, Baku, Miami, Jeddah, and Las Vegas. Three-time World champion Nelson Piquet famously described racing in Monaco as \"like riding a bicycle around your living room\".\nCircuit design to protect the safety of drivers is becoming increasingly sophisticated. Several of the new circuits in F1, especially those designed by Hermann Tilke, however, have also been criticised as lacking the \"flow\" of such classics as Spa-Francorchamps and Imola. His redesign of the Hockenheim circuit in Germany, for example, while providing more capacity for grandstands and eliminating extremely long and dangerous straights, has been frowned upon by many who argue that part of the character of the Hockenheim circuit was the long and blinding straights into dark forest sections. These newer circuits are generally agreed to meet the safety standards of modern Formula One better than the older ones.\nThe Circuit of the Americas in Austin, the Sochi Autodrom in Sochi, and the Baku City Circuit in Azerbaijan have all been introduced as brand new tracks since 2012. In 2020, Algarve International Circuit debuted on the F1 calendar as the venue of the Portuguese Grand Prix, with the country having last hosted a race in 1996. In 2021, Circuit Zandvoort returned to the F1 calendar as the Dutch Grand Prix, having last hosted a race in 1985. The Las Vegas Grand Prix entered the series in 2023.\nCars and technology.\nModern Formula One cars are mid-engined, hybrid, semi-open cockpit, open-wheel, single-seaters. The chassis is made largely of carbon-fibre composites, rendering it light but extremely stiff and strong. The whole car, including the driver but not fuel, weighs only \u2013 the minimum weight set by the regulations. If the construction of the car is lighter than the minimum, it can be ballasted to add the necessary weight. The race teams take advantage of this by placing this ballast at the extreme bottom of the chassis, thereby locating the centre of gravity as low as possible in order to improve handling and weight transfer.\nAerodynamic downforce generated by the \"wings\" mounted to the front and rear of Formula One cars alongside ground effect created by low air pressure under the flat bottom of the car, plays a large role in determining its speed. Downforce of 2.5 times the car's weight can be achieved at full speed, and a lateral force with a magnitude of up to 3.5 times that of the force of gravity (3.5g) in cornering.\nThe other major factor controlling the cornering speed of the cars is the design of the tyres. From to , Formula One did not use \"slicks\" as in most other circuit racing series. Instead, each tyre had four large circumferential grooves on its surface designed to limit the cornering speed of the cars. Slick tyres were reintroduced by Formula One in the season, and are now exclusively supplied by Pirelli. Formula One cars must also have four wheels made of the same metallic material, which must be one of two magnesium alloys specified by the FIA. Magnesium alloy wheels made by forging are used to achieve maximum unsprung rotating weight reduction. As of 2022, the wheels are covered with standardised wheel covers, the wheel diameter has increased from 13 inches to 18 inches, and small winglets have been placed over the front tyres.\nFor most of the 21st century, Formula One cars have used double wishbone or multilink at the front and rear, with pushrod operated springs and dampers on the chassis, though there have been some notable exceptions. In 2009, the Red Bull Racing RB5 used a pullrod suspension at the rear. Ferrari used a pullrod suspension at both the front and rear in their car. In , the McLaren MCL36 and the Red Bull Racing RB18 switched to a pullrod front suspension and push rod rear suspension. Carbon-carbon disc brakes are used for reduced weight and increased frictional performance. The carbon material enhances the brakes by maintaining an effective performance under extreme heat. To optimise this, the brakes feature 1,000 ventilation holes, ensuring maximum performance and cooling.\nIn , the technical regulations were altered considerably in order to reduce the turbulence produced by the aerodynamics of the car. This includes a redesigned front and rear wing, larger wheels with a lower tyre profile, wheel covers, small winglets, the banning of barge boards, and the reintroduction of Ground effect downforce production. These changes have been made to allow cars to follow another at a much closer distance, without extending the gap due to a lower downforce caused by \"dirty air\".\nIn 2014, the engines were changed from a 2.4-litre naturally aspirated V8 to turbocharged 1.6-litre V6 power units. These run on unleaded fuel closely resembling publicly available petrol, get a significant amount of their power from electric motors and include energy recovery technology. The 2006 generation of engines spun up to 20,000\u00a0rpm and produced over . Following the engine specification freeze, this was reduced to 19,000\u00a0rpm with limited development allowed in and 18,000\u00a0rpm in 2009.\nA wide variety of technologies, including active suspension, are banned under the current regulations. Despite this, the current generation of cars can reach speeds in excess of at some circuits. The highest straight line speed recorded during a Grand Prix was , set by Juan Pablo Montoya during the 2005 Italian Grand Prix. During qualifying for the 2016 European Grand Prix, Valtteri Bottas set a record top speed of 378\u00a0km/h (234.9\u00a0mph).\nAs of 2019[ [update]], each team may have no more than two cars available for use at any time. Each driver is limited to four engines during a championship season. They are also allowed one new gearbox for every six consecutive races and three power units per season, following which they incur grid penalties.\nRevenue and profits.\nFor much of the sport's history, engine costs varied significantly between teams. In 2006, Honda, Toyota, McLaren-Mercedes, and Ferrari each spent an estimated $200\u00a0million, Renault $125\u00a0million, while Cosworth developed its V8 for just $15\u00a0million. From 2007, however, the sporting regulations banned performance-related engine development. The estimated cost of running a team was approximated to million as of 2018.\nFormula One teams pay entry fees of $500,000, plus $5,000 per point scored the previous year or $6,000 per point for the winner of the Constructors' Championship. Formula One drivers pay a FIA Super Licence fee, which in 2013 was \u20ac10,000 plus \u20ac1,000 per point.\nThere have been controversies with the way profits are shared among the teams. The smaller teams have complained that the profits are unevenly shared, favouring established top teams. In September 2015, Force India and Sauber officially lodged a complaint with the European Union against Formula One, questioning the governance and stating that the system of dividing revenues and determining the rules is unfair and unlawful.\nThe cost of building a brand-new permanent circuit can be up to hundreds of millions of dollars, while the cost of converting a public road into a temporary circuit is much less. The Shanghai International Circuit cost over $300\u00a0million, and the Istanbul Park circuit cost $150\u00a0million to build.\nIn the second quarter of 2020, Formula One reported a loss revenue of $122\u00a0million, and an income of $24\u00a0million. This was a result of the delay of the racing championship start due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The company grossed revenues of $620\u00a0million for the same quarter the previous year.\nCost cap.\nWhen Formula 1 began in 1950, the sport's governing body did not have any regulations limiting the spending of a team. Over time, this led to a teams with large budgets performing significantly better than their competitors. For instance, in 2019, Mercedes, the Constructors' Champion, spent $420 million, while the lowest-scoring teams, Williams and Haas, spent only $125 million and $150 million, respectively.\nTo curb the growing advantage that these wealthier teams gained from extensive track time, the FIA first introduced a ban on unlimited private testing, before eventually implementing a cost cap of $175 million in 2021. It was reduced to $145 million soon after due to the economic turmoil caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. It fell further to $140 million in 2022, before settling at $135 million for the next three years.\nCritics have argued that the cap might not be sufficient to close the gap in competition because it excludes certain expenses like driver salaries, compensation for the three highest paid-staff members, and marketing costs. In practice, however, the cost cap seems to have helped teams maximise efficiency and foster innovation within their financial means. McLaren started the 2023 season as the slowest car on the track, with their drivers finishing outside the points. Seven months later, they were the fastest car on the grid in both qualifying and race pace, and, in 2024, they won the constructors' championship.\nFuture.\nThe expense of Formula One has seen the FIA and the Formula One Commission attempt to create new regulations to lower the costs for a team to compete in the sport.\nFollowing their purchase of the commercial rights to the series in 2017, Liberty Media announced their vision for the future of Formula One at the 2018 Bahrain Grand Prix. The proposal identified five key areas, including streamlining the governance of the sport, emphasising cost-effectiveness, maintaining the sport's relevance to road cars, and encouraging new manufacturers to enter the championship whilst enabling them to be competitive.\nOn 19 August 2020, it was announced that all 10 teams had signed the new Concorde Agreement. This came into effect at the start of the 2021 season and changed how prize money and TV revenue are distributed.\nEnvironmental impact.\nFormula One has initiated a plan to become carbon neutral by 2030. By 2025, all events should have become \"sustainable\", including eliminating single-use plastics and ensuring all waste is reused, recycled or composted.\nA report conducted by Formula One estimated that the series was responsible for 256,000\u00a0tonnes of carbon dioxide emissions in the 2019 season, finding that 45% of emissions were from logistics and 0.7% were from emissions from the cars themselves.\nIn January 2020, FIA and Formula One signed the United Nations Sports for Climate Action framework. From the 2021 season onwards, all cars increased the bio-component of their fuel, using E10 fuel, rather than the 5.75% of ethanol previously used. This percentage is expected to grow again in the future. In December 2020, the FIA claimed that it had developed a fuel with 100% sustainability to be used in Formula One from either 2025 or 2026, when new engine regulations come into force.\nSocial inequities.\nPrior to the beginning of the 2020 Formula One World Championship, F1 announced and launched the #WeRaceAsOne initiative. The initiative primarily focuses on visible displays of solidarity in the fight against racism on Grand Prix Weekends, as well as the creation of a Formula 1 Task Force that will \"listen to people from across the paddock [...] and make conclusions on the actions required to improve the diversity and opportunity in Formula 1 at all levels\". The move stems from the growing questions about racism and global inequalities perpetuated by the sport.\nIn addition to organization-wide measures, individual teams have also acknowledged deficiencies in the sport's cultural and political activism. During the 2020 season, the Mercedes-AMG Petronas F1 Team conducted a study of its racial composition and found that approximately 95% of its workforce was white. In effort to change this, they ran a black livery to promote anti-racism messages and also launched the Accelerate 25 programme. The program vows that approximately 25% of all new hires to the team will come from underrepresented minorities in the series until 2025.\nThe 20 drivers on the grid also stood in solidarity on multiple occasions in the fight against racism, both on and off the track. Following the murder of George Floyd in the summer of 2020, all twenty drivers wore \"End Racism\" shirts and took part in an organised anti-racism protest during the pre-race formalities. In the following season, Lewis Hamilton remained vocal through his race weekend attire, with other drivers occasionally wearing change-demanding clothing.\nWomen in Formula One.\nSince the creation of Formula One in 1950, five women have competed in a Grand Prix, only one of whom finished within the points. The involvement of women in the Formula One paddock has ranged from team principals, race engineers and strategists to media and communications personnel. With the release of the Netflix show, , female viewership of the series has risen. In 2019, 20% of the total Formula One viewership was female, and by 2022 this number had increased to 40%.\nDrivers.\nMaria Teresa de Filippis was the first woman to compete in the series at the 1958 Monaco Grand Prix. She drove in a total of five Grand Prix, racing under the Italian flag, and has been hailed a pioneer of women in motorsport.\nLella Lombardi is the only woman to place within the points at a Formula One Grand Prix. She competed in three seasons, entering seventeen races and starting twelve. After finishing sixth in the 1975 Spanish Grand Prix, Lombardi became the first and only woman to score points during an official Formula Grand Prix. Due to the race not reaching full completion, half points were awarded, and Lombardi only gained 0.5 points.\nDesir\u00e9 Wilson is the only woman to win a Formula One race of any kind, winning the second round of the 1980 Aurora AFX F1 Championship.\nGiovanna Amati was the last female driver to attempt to qualify for a Formula One Grand Prix. In 1992, she was signed by Brabham and participated in three races\u2014South Africa, Mexico, and Brazil\u2014but failed to qualify for any of them. Amati faced significant challenges, including an underperforming car and limited testing opportunities. She was replaced by Damon Hill after Brabham struggled with financial difficulties and performance issues. Her participation also marked the last time a female driver was officially listed on an F1 entry list until Susie Wolff took part in free practice sessions for Williams during her four years with the team as a development driver.\nIn 2022, Formula One announced the creation of F1 Academy in an effort to \"change perceptions and inspire the next generation of girls\". It is the only female single-seater racing championship. Its inaugural championship was won by Marta Garc\u00eda of Prema Racing. The establishment of F1 Academy has attracted significant levels of attention to women in motorsport. Netflix premiered a docuseries in 2025 about the academy. In addition to this, companies like Tommy Hilfiger, Charlotte Tilbury, and Puma have become sponsors due to its increasing popularity.\nTeam personnel.\nAustrian Monisha Kaltenborn became the sport's first-ever female team principal when she took over the role at Sauber Formula 1 Team in 2010. English Claire Williams became the only other woman to ever manage a Formula 1 team when she assumed the role of Deputy Team Principal for Williams Racing in 2013.\nAs of 2025[ [update]], Hannah Schmitz holds the role of principal strategy engineer at Red Bull Racing. She has been with the team since 2009 and has played a strong presence in its victories in 2021, 2022, and 2023. Beginning in 2025, Laura M\u00fcller has served as the race engineer for Esteban Ocon at Haas, making her the first woman to serve as a race engineer on a full-time basis.\nMedia coverage.\nFormula One is broadcast live or tape delayed in almost every country and territory and attracts one of the largest global television audiences. The cumulative television audience for the 2001 season, which was broadcast to 200 territories, was calculated to be 54\u00a0billion, and has since fallen to 1.55 billion.\nAll broadcasters are provided with an identical world feed produced by Formula One Management. Previously, this footage was provided by local broadcasters who had one feed for all, or two separate feeds \u2013 a feed for local viewers and a feed for international viewers. This approach was significantly criticised as viewers would tend to miss out on important action and incidents due to local biases.\nAn enhanced package called F1 Digital+ was launched by FOM in 1996, which included live broadcast of all sessions live as well as additional channels including onboard and pit-lane cameras. It was initially only offered in Germany, Austria, and Switzerland, though it later became available in France, Italy, Spain, and the UK. The service was never financially viable and was discontinued at the end of 2002.\nThe official Formula One website has live timing charts that can be used during the race to follow the leaderboard in real time. An official application has been available for the Apple App Store since 2009, and on Google Play since 2011, that shows users a real-time feed of driver positions, timing, and commentary. On 26\u00a0November 2017, Formula One unveiled a new logo, which replaced the previous \"flying one\" in use since 1993.\nIn March 2018, Formula One announced the launch of F1 TV, an over-the-top streaming platform that lets viewers watch multiple simultaneous video feeds and timing screens in addition to traditional directed race footage and commentary. In April 2024, FOM launched a free ad-supported streaming television channel known as the Formula 1 Channel in the United States, which plays classic Grands Prix, documentaries, and analysis from past races.\nTelevision broadcasters.\nIn the United Kingdom, several companies have retained the right to broadcast races. In 2012, Sky launched a dedicated channel, Sky Sports F1, which covered all races live without commercial interruption as well as live practice and qualifying sessions, along with F1 programming, including interviews, archive action and magazine shows. BBC retained similar rights until 2015, when they ended their contract three years earlier than planned. The free-to-air TV rights were picked up by Channel 4 until the end of the 2018 season. As of 2025, BBC Radio 5 Live, 5 Sports Extra, and BBC Sounds have rights to such coverage until 2028.\nIn South East Asia, the Middle East, and North Africa, Formula One is broadcast by beIN Sports. In India, sessions are broadcast by streaming service FanCode and satellite television provider Tata Play. In China, the rights are held by Tencent, Guangdong TV, and Shanghai TV.\nIn the United States, ESPN has held the rights since 2013, carrying the broadcast and commentary feed provided by Sky Sports UK. According to \"The Athletic\", the fee paid by ESPN is estimated at $90 million per year as of 2025, with the current deal set to expire after the 2025 season. Ahead of the 2025 United States Grand Prix, it was announced that Apple Inc. had acquired the U.S. rights to Formula One under a five-year deal; most coverage will be exclusive to Apple TV subscribers, with practice sessions and selected races available for free.\nIn Germany, Austria, Italy, and Switzerland, the exclusive rights are held by pay TV broadcaster Sky Sport. The rights were previously shared with free-to-air channel RTL for many years, which had broadcast all Formula One qualifying and racing sessions since 1991, but lost its rights after the 2020 season due to being outbid by Sky Sport. Despite no longer holding the rights themselves, RTL has broadcast selected sessions on free-to-air television and its streaming service RTL+ as part of various sublicensing agreements with Sky Sport.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "10855", "revid": "50879089", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=10855", "title": "Franco Baresi", "text": "Italian footballer (born 1960)\nFranchino Baresi (; born 8 May 1960) is an Italian football youth team coach and a former player and manager. He mainly played as a sweeper or as a central defender, and spent his entire 20-year career with Serie A club AC Milan, captaining the club for 15 seasons. Widely regarded as one of the greatest defenders of all time, he was ranked 19th in \"World Soccer\" magazine's list of the 100 greatest players of the 20th century. With Milan, he won three UEFA Champions League titles, six Serie A titles, four Supercoppa Italiana titles, two European Super Cups and two Intercontinental Cups, as well as a World Cup with Italy.\nWith the Italy national team, he was a member of the Italian squad that won the 1982 FIFA World Cup. He also played in the 1990 World Cup, where he was named in the FIFA World Cup All-Star Team, finishing third in the competition. At the 1994 World Cup, he was named Italy's captain and was part of the squad that reached the final, although he would miss a penalty in the resulting shoot-out as Brazil lifted the trophy. Baresi also represented Italy at two UEFA European Championships, in 1980 and 1988, and at the 1984 Olympics, reaching the semi-finals on each occasion.\nThe younger brother of former footballer Giuseppe Baresi, after joining the Milan senior team as a youngster, Franco Baresi was initially nicknamed \"Piscinin\", Milanese for \"little one\". Due to his skill and success, he was later known as \"Kaiser Franz\", a reference to fellow sweeper Franz Beckenbauer. In 1999, he was voted Milan's Player of the Century. After his final season at Milan in 1997, the club retired Baresi's shirt number 6. He was named by Pel\u00e9 one of the 125 Greatest Living Footballers at the FIFA centenary awards ceremony in 2004. Baresi was inducted into the Italian Football Hall of Fame in 2013.\nEarly life.\nBaresi grew up in a farmstead on the outskirts of a small north Italian town, Travagliato. He did not watch football on television until he was 10.\nClub career.\nOriginally an AC Milan youth product, Baresi went on to spend his entire 20-year professional career with AC Milan, making his Serie A debut at age 17 during the 1977\u201378 season on 23 April 1978. He had initially been rejected by the Inter Milan youth team, who chose his brother Giuseppe instead, hence the Milan youth team signed Franco Baresi. The two brothers ended up captaining their respective teams shortly after, with their image while exchanging pennants became the trademark of Milan's \"derby della Madonnina\" throughout the 80s.\nThe following season, he was made a member of the starting 11, playing as a sweeper or as a centreback, winning the 1978\u201379 Serie A title, Milan's tenth overall, playing alongside Fabio Capello and Gianni Rivera.\nThis success was soon followed by a dark period in the club's history, when Milan was relegated to Serie B twice during the early 1980s. Milan were relegated in 1980 for being involved in the match fixing scandal of 1980, and once again after finishing third-last in the 1981\u201382 season, after having just returned to Serie A the previous season, after winning the 1980\u201381 Serie B title. Despite being a member of the Euro 1980 Italy squad that had finished fourth, and the 1982 World Cup-winning team, Baresi elected to stay with Milan, winning the Serie B title for the second time during the 1982\u201383 season and bringing Milan back to Serie A. After Aldo Maldera and Fulvio Collovati left the club in 1982, Baresi was appointed Milan's captain, at age 22, and would hold this position for much of his time at the club, becoming a symbol and a leader for the team. During this bleak period for Milan, Baresi did manage to win a Mitropa Cup in 1982 and reached the Coppa Italia final during 1984\u201385 season, although the team failed to dominate in Serie A.\nDuring the end of the 1980s and the first half of the 1990s, Baresi was at the heart of a notable all-Italian defence alongside Paolo Maldini, Alessandro Costacurta, Mauro Tassotti and later Christian Panucci, under managers Arrigo Sacchi and Fabio Capello, a defence which is regarded by many as one of the greatest of all time. When the attacking Dutch trio of Marco van Basten, Ruud Gullit and Frank Rijkaard arrived at the club in the late 1980s, Milan began a period of domestic and international triumphs, and between 1987 and 1996, at the height of the club's success, the Milan squad contained many Italian and international stars, such as Roberto Donadoni, Carlo Ancelotti, Marco van Basten, Ruud Gullit, Frank Rijkaard and later Demetrio Albertini, Dejan Savi\u0107evi\u0107, Zvonimir Boban, Marcel Desailly, George Weah, Jean-Pierre Papin, Brian Laudrup and Roberto Baggio. Under Sacchi, Milan won the Serie A title in 1987\u201388, with Baresi helping Milan to concede only 14 goals. This title was immediately followed by a Supercoppa Italiana in 1988 the next season, and back-to-back European Cups in 1988\u201389 and 1989\u201390; In the 1990 European Cup Final, Baresi turned in a dominant performance as the team's captain, helping Milan to defend the European Cup title and keep a clean sheet in a 1\u20130 victory over Benfica. Baresi was also runner-up to teammate Van Basten for the Ballon d'Or in 1989, finishing ahead of his other teammate Frank Rijkaard, and was named Serie A Footballer of the Year in 1989\u201390. Milan also reached the Coppa Italia final during the 1989\u201390 season.\nBaresi went on to win four more Serie A titles with Milan under Fabio Capello, including three consecutive titles in 1991\u201392, 1992\u201393 and the 1993\u201394 seasons. Baresi helped Milan win the 1991\u201392 title undefeated, helping Milan to go unbeaten for an Italian record of 58 matches. Milan also scored a record 74 goals that season. During the 1993\u201394 season, Baresi helped Milan concede a mere 15 goals in Serie A, helping the club to finish the season with the best defence. Baresi also won three consecutive Supercoppa Italiana under Capello, in 1992, 1993 and 1994. Milan also reached three consecutive UEFA Champions League finals during the 1992\u201393, 1993\u201394 and 1994\u201395 seasons, losing to Marseille in 1992\u201393 and Ajax in 1994\u201395. Baresi won the third European Cup/UEFA Champions League of his career in 1993\u201394 when Milan defeated Johan Cruyff's Barcelona \"Dream Team\" 4\u20130 in the final. Baresi also managed to win the 1994 European Super Cup, although Milan were defeated in the 1994 Intercontinental Cup, the 1993 European Super Cup and the 1993 Intercontinental Cup. Under Capello, Milan and Baresi were able to capture another Serie A title during 1995\u201396 season, Baresi's sixth.\nBaresi retired at the end of the 1996\u201397 Serie A season, at age 37. In his 20 seasons with Milan, he won six Serie A titles, three European Cup/UEFA Champions League titles (reaching five finals in total), two Intercontinental Cups (four finals in total), three European Supercups (four finals in total), four Supercoppa Italiana (five finals in total), two Serie B titles and a Mitropa Cup. He scored 31 goals for Milan, 21 of which were on penalties, and, despite being a defender, he was the top scorer of the Coppa Italia during the 1989\u201390 season, the only trophy which he failed to win with Milan, reaching the final twice during his career. His final goal for Milan was scored in a 2\u20131 win against Padova on 27 August 1995. In his honour, Milan retired his number 6 shirt, which he had worn throughout his career. The captain's armband, which he had worn for 15 seasons, was handed over to Paolo Maldini. Milan organised a celebration match in his honour, which was played on 28 October 1997 at the San Siro, featuring many footballing stars.\nInternational career.\nAt age 20, while still playing in the Italy under-21 side, Baresi was named in Italy's 22-man squad for the 1980 European Championship (along with his older brother Giuseppe) by manager Enzo Bearzot. The tournament was held on home soil and Italy finished fourth. However, unlike his brother, Franco Baresi did not play a single match in the tournament. Euro 1980 would be the only time the two brothers were on the Italy squad together at a major tournament. At age 22, Baresi was named in Italy's squad for the 1982 FIFA World Cup. The \"Azzurri\" won their third World Cup, defeating West Germany in the final, but Baresi, once again, was not selected to play a match throughout the tournament. Baresi was also a member of the Italy squad that took part in the 1984 Olympics. Italy finished in fourth place after a semi-final defeat to Brazil, and losing the bronze medal match to Yugoslavia. Baresi scored a goal against the United States during the group stage.\nBaresi won his first senior international cap in a 1984 UEFA Championship qualifying match against Romania in Florence, on 14 December 1982, a 0\u20130 draw. Italy, however, ultimately failed to qualify for the final tournament.\nBaresi was not included in Italy's squad for the 1986 World Cup by coach Enzo Bearzot, who saw him as being more of a midfielder than a defender (although his brother Giuseppe was selected as a defender for the World Cup, as well as Roberto Tricella). He returned to the team for the 1988 European Championship, playing as a sweeper, where Italy reached the semi-finals under Azeglio Vicini, becoming an undisputed first team member and playing in every match. He made his first appearance in a World Cup finals match in the 1990 tournament, which was held on home soil, and he played in every match as one of the starting centre-backs, as Italy finished in third-place, after being eliminated by defending champions Argentina in a penalty shootout in the semi-finals. Baresi helped the Italian defence to keep five consecutive clean sheets, only conceding two goals, and going unbeaten for a World Cup record of 518 minutes, until they were beaten by an Argentinian equaliser in the semi-final. His performances earned him a spot on the 1990 World Cup Team of the tournament.\nAfter replacing Giuseppe Bergomi as captain for the 1994 World Cup under his former manager at Milan, Arrigo Sacchi, Baresi sustained an injury to his meniscus in Italy's second group match, a 1\u20130 win against Norway, and missed most of the tournament. He returned to the squad 25 days later, in time for the final, with a dominant defensive performance, helping Italy to keep a clean sheet against Brazil, despite the key defensive absences of his Milan teammates Alessandro Costacurta and Mauro Tassotti. After a 0\u20130 deadlock following extra time, the match went to a penalty shootout, and Baresi subsequently missed his penalty, suffering from severe cramps and fatigue. Following misses by Daniele Massaro and Roberto Baggio, Italy were defeated by Brazil in the penalty shootout.\nFollowing the World Cup defeat, Baresi made one more appearance for Italy, in an away UEFA Euro 1996 qualifying match against Slovenia on 7 September 1994, which ended in a 1\u20131 draw. Baresi subsequently retired from the national side at age 34, passing the captain's armband to his Milan teammate Paolo Maldini. Baresi amassed 81 caps for Italy, scoring one goal in a friendly win against the Soviet Union, and he is one of seven players to have achieved the rare feat of winning Gold, Silver and Bronze FIFA World Cup medals during his international career.\nStyle of play.\nBaresi is regarded as one of the greatest defenders of all time. He played his entire 20-year career with Milan, becoming a club legend. At Milan, he formed one of the most formidable defensive units of all time, alongside Paolo Maldini, Alessandro Costacurta, Mauro Tassotti, Filippo Galli and later Christian Panucci. He was a complete and consistent defender who combined power with elegance and was gifted with outstanding physical and mental attributes, such as pace, strength, tenacity, concentration and stamina, which made him effective in the air, despite his lack of notable height for a centre-back.\nAlthough Baresi was capable of playing anywhere along the backline, he primarily excelled as a centreback and as sweeper, where he combined his defensive attributes, and his ability to read the game, with his excellent vision, technique, distribution and ball skills. These qualities also enabled him to excel in a zonal marking system, maintain a high defensive line, and play the offside trap, in particular during his time at Milan under Sacchi; indeed, Baresi came to be known for often raising his arm towards the linesman whenever his team attempted to play the offside trap. Baresi's passing range, technical ability and ball control allowed him to advance forward into the midfield to start attacking plays from the back, enabling him to function as a secondary playmaker for his team, and also play as a defensive or central midfielder when necessary. Despite being a defender, he was also an accurate penalty kick taker. Baresi was known for being a strong and accurate tackler, who was very good at winning back possession, and at anticipating and intercepting plays, due to his acute tactical intelligence, speed of thought, marking ability and positional sense. A precocious talent in his youth, throughout the course of his career, he also stood out for his professionalism, athleticism, longevity, and discipline in training, as well as his outstanding leadership, commanding presence on the pitch and his organisational skills; indeed, he captained both Milan and the Italy national team.\nBaresi also shares the record of most own goals scored in Serie A history (eight, along with Riccardo Ferri).\nCoaching career.\nOn 1 June 2002, Baresi was officially appointed as director of football at Fulham, but tensions between Baresi and then Fulham manager Jean Tigana led to resignation from the club in August.\nHe was appointed head coach of Milan's \"Primavera\" Under-20 squad. In 2006, he was moved by the club to coach the \"Berretti\" Under-19 squad, with his former teammate Filippo Galli replacing him at the helm of the Primavera squad. He retired from coaching and was replaced by Roberto Bertuzzo.\nPersonal life.\nFranco Baresi is the younger brother of Inter Milan legendary defender Giuseppe Baresi. As youngsters, both players had tryouts for Inter, but Franco was rejected, and purchased by local rivals Milan. As he was the younger player, Franco was initially known as \"Baresi 2\". However, due to Franco's eventual great success and popularity throughout his career, which surpassed even that of his older brother's, Giuseppe later became known as \"the other Baresi\", despite also achieving notable success.\nIn 1981, Baresi suffered from a blood infection that forced him out of play for nearly four months and worsened his health to the point of him needing a wheelchair. While in treatment, he participated in a medical research for the disease.\nIn August 2025, Baresi had a lung surgery, with a pulmonary nodule removed from his body. Then, he began a course of immunotherapy as a means of cancer prevention.\nMedia.\nBaresi is featured in the EA Sports football video game series \"FIFA 14\"'s Classic XI \u2013 a multi-national all-star team, along with compatriots Bruno Conti, Gianni Rivera and Giacinto Facchetti. He was also named in the Ultimate Team Legends in \"FIFA 15\".\nCareer statistics.\nClub.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\n\"Scores and results list Italy's goal tally first, score column indicates score after each Baresi goal.\"\nHonours.\nAC Milan\nIndividual\nOrders\n* 4th Class / Officer: \"Ufficiale Ordine al Merito della Repubblica Italiana\": 1991\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "10857", "revid": "28481209", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=10857", "title": "Stage (stratigraphy)", "text": "Unit in stratigraphy\nIn chronostratigraphy, a stage is a succession of rock strata laid down in a single age on the geologic timescale, which usually represents millions of years of deposition. A given stage of rock and the corresponding age of time will by convention have the same name, and the same boundaries.\nRock series are divided into stages, just as geological epochs are divided into ages. Stages are divided into smaller stratigraphic units called chronozones or substages, and added together into superstages.\nThe term faunal stage is sometimes used, referring to the fact that the same fauna (animals) are found throughout the layer (by definition).\nDefinition.\nStages are primarily defined by a consistent set of fossils (biostratigraphy) or a consistent magnetic polarity (see paleomagnetism) in the rock. Usually one or more index fossils that are common, found worldwide, easily recognized, and limited to a single, or at most a few, stages are used to define the stage's bottom. \nThus, for example in the local North American subdivision, a paleontologist finding fragments of the trilobite \"Olenellus\" would identify the beds as being from the Waucoban Stage whereas fragments of a later trilobite such as \"Elrathia\" would identify the stage as Albertan. \nStages were important in the 19th and early 20th centuries as they were the major tool available for dating and correlating rock units prior to the development of seismology and radioactive dating in the second half of the 20th century. Microscopic analysis of the rock (petrology) is also sometimes useful in confirming that a given segment of rock is from a particular age.\nOriginally, faunal stages were only defined regionally. As additional stratigraphic and geochronologic tools were developed, they were defined over ever broader areas. More recently, the adjective \"faunal\" has been dropped as regional and global correlations of rock sequences have become relatively certain and there is less need for faunal labels to define the age of formations. A tendency developed to use European and, to a lesser extent, Asian stage names for the same time period worldwide, even though the faunas in other regions often had little in common with the stage as originally defined.\nInternational standardization.\nBoundaries and names are established by the International Commission on Stratigraphy (ICS) of the International Union of Geological Sciences. As of 2008, the ICS is nearly finished with a task begun in 1974, subdividing the Phanerozoic eonothem into internationally accepted stages using two types of benchmark. For younger stages, a Global Boundary Stratotype Section and Point (GSSP), a physical outcrop clearly demonstrates the boundary. For older stages, a Global Standard Stratigraphic Age (GSSA) is an absolute date. The benchmarks will give a much greater certainty that results can be compared with confidence in the date determinations, and such results will have farther scope than any evaluation based solely on local knowledge and conditions. \nIn many regions local subdivisions and classification criteria are still used along with the newer internationally coordinated uniform system, but once the research establishes a more complete international system, it is expected that local systems will be abandoned.\nStages and lithostratigraphy.\nStages can include many lithostratigraphic units (for example formations, beds, members, etc.) of differing rock types that were being laid down in different environments at the same time. In the same way, a lithostratigraphic unit can include a number of stages or parts of them.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
