It is Afghanistan's second largest city, after Kabul, with a population of about 614,118 in 2015. It is the capital of Kandahar Province and the centre of the larger cultural region called Loy Kandahar.\nThe region around Kandahar is one of the oldest known areas of human settlement. A major fortified city existed at the site of Kandahar, probably as early as c. 1000\u2013750 BC, and it became an important outpost of the Achaemenid Empire in the 6th century BC. Alexander the Great laid the foundation of what is now Old Kandahar (in the southern section of the city) in the 4th century BC and named it Alexandria Arachosia. Many empires have long fought over the city due to its strategic location along the trade routes of southern, central and western Asia. In 1709, Mirwais Hotak made the region an independent kingdom and made Kandahar the capital of the Hotak dynasty. In 1747, Ahmad Shah Durrani, founder of the Durrani dynasty, made Kandahar the capital of the Afghan Empire.\nKandahar is the founding city and spiritual center of the Taliban. Despite the capital of Afghanistan being Kabul, where the government administration is based, Kandahar is the seat of power in Afghanistan as the supreme leader and his spiritual advisers are based there. Kandahar has therefore been called the \"de facto\" capital of Afghanistan, though the Taliban maintain Kabul as the official capital.\nKandahar is one of the most culturally significant cities of the Pashtun community and has been their traditional seat of power for more than 300 years. It is a major trading center for fresh and dried fruit, including food grains, sheep, wool, cotton, silk, and felt. The region produces fine fruits, especially pomegranates and grapes, and the city has plants for canning, drying, and packing fruits. Kandahar continues to experience violence, with numerous armed clashes, bombings, and attacks that harm civilians.\nName.\nThe modern name of the city derives from the name of the original city built here, Alexandria. This city (often referred to as Alexandria in Arachosia to distinguish it from other Alexandrias) was founded after the invasion of Alexander the Great in 330 BC. The name \"Alexander\" in the local Pashto language is rendered as \"Iskandar\". It is believed that over time this transformed into \"Scandar\", and eventually the modern \"Kandahar\". The change of the name from \"Scandar\" to Candar is mentioned by the 16th-century Portuguese historian Jo\u00e3o de Barros in his most famous work, \"D\u00e9cadas da \u00c1sia\".\nA folk etymology offered is that the word \"kand\" or \"qand\" in Persian and Pashto (the local languages) is the origin of the word \"candy\". The name \"Candahar\" or \"Kandahar\" in this form probably translates to candy area. This probably has to do with the location being fertile and historically known for producing fine grapes, pomegranates, apricots, melons and other sweet fruits.\nErnst Herzfeld claimed Kandahar perpetuated the name of the Indo-Parthian king Gondophares, who re-founded the city under the name Gundopharron. However, modern historians and linguists generally find this derivation implausible.\nHistory.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\nTimeline of Kandahar (Alexandria Arachosia)&lt;br&gt;\n\u00a0Macedonia 330 BC\u2013312 BC&lt;br&gt;\n\u00a0Seleucid Empire 312 BC\u2013304 BC&lt;br&gt;\n\u00a0Maurya Empire 304 BC\u2013204 BC&lt;br&gt;\n\u00a0Seleucid Empire 204 BC\u2013c. 180 BC&lt;br&gt;\n\u00a0Greco-Bactrian Kingdom 180 BC \u2013 c. 150 BC&lt;br&gt;\n\u00a0Yavana Kingdom c. 150 BC\u2013142 BC&lt;br&gt;\n\u00a0Indo-Scythians 142 BC\u201332 BC&lt;br&gt;\n\u00a0Parthian Empire 32 BC\u201319 CE&lt;br&gt;\n\u00a0Indo-Parthian Kingdom 19\u201336&lt;br&gt;\n\u00a0Kushan Empire 36\u2013230&lt;br&gt;\n\u00a0Sasanian Empire 230\u2013645&lt;br&gt;\n\u00a0Rashidun Caliphate 645\u2013661&lt;br&gt;\n\u00a0Umayyad Caliphate 661\u2013750&lt;br&gt;\n Abbasid Caliphate 750\u2013861&lt;br&gt;\n\u00a0Saffarid dynasty 861\u2013977&lt;br&gt;\n\u00a0Ghaznavid Empire 977\u20131175&lt;br&gt;\n\u00a0Ghurid dynasty 1175\u20131207&lt;br&gt;\n\u00a0Khwarazmian Empire 1207\u20131222&lt;br&gt;\n\u00a0Mongol Empire 1222\u20131256&lt;br&gt;\n Ilkhanate 1256\u20131347&lt;br&gt;\n\u00a0Kart dynasty 1347\u20131382&lt;br&gt;\n Timurid Empire 1382\u20131507&lt;br&gt;\n Mughal Empire 1507\u20131649&lt;br&gt;\n Safavid Empire 1649\u20131711&lt;br&gt;\n Hotak dynasty 1711\u20131738&lt;br&gt;\n Afsharid Empire 1738\u20131747&lt;br&gt;\n\u00a0Durrani Empire 1747\u20131818&lt;br&gt;\n Principality of Kandahar 1818\u20131839&lt;br&gt;\n United Kingdom (Company Raj) 1839\u20131842&lt;br&gt;\n Principality of Kandahar 1842\u20131855&lt;br&gt;\n Afghanistan 1855\u2013present\nPrehistory.\nExcavations of prehistoric sites by archaeologists such as Louis Dupree and others suggest that the region around Kandahar is one of the oldest known human settlements known so far.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;N. Dupree\u2014\u200a\nBritish excavations in the 1970s discovered that Kandahar existed as a large fortified city during the early 1st millennium BC; while this earliest period at Kandahar has not been precisely dated via radiocarbon, ceramic comparisons with the latest period at the major Bronze Age city of Mundigak have suggested an approximate time-frame of 1000 to 750 BC. This fortified city became an important outpost of the Achaemenid Empire in the 6th to 4th centuries BC, and formed part of the province of Arachosia.\nAncient history.\nThe main inhabitants of Arachosia were the \"Pakhtas\", an ancient Indo-Iranian tribe, who might have been among the ancestors of today's Pashtuns. Mundigak served as the provincial capital of Arachosia and was ruled by the Medes followed by the Achaemenids until the arrival of the Macedonians. The now known \"Old Kandahar\" was founded in 330 BC by Alexander the Great, near the site of the ancient city of Mundigak (established around 3000 BC era). Kandahar was named \"Alexandria\", a name given to some cities that Alexander founded during his conquests.\nKandahar was a frequent target for conquest because of its strategic location in Asia, controlling the main trade route linking the Indian subcontinent with the Middle East and Central Asia. The territory became part of the Seleucid Empire after the death of Alexander. The city eventually became part of the Greco-Bactrian Kingdom (250 BC \u2013 125 BC), and continued that way for two hundred years under the later Indo-Greek Kingdom (180 BC \u2013 10 AD). \nIt is mentioned by Strabo that a treaty of friendship was established eventually between the Greeks and the Mauryas (Indians). While the Diadochi were warring amongst themselves, the Mauryas were developing in the northern part of the Indian subcontinent. The founder of the empire, Chandragupta Maurya, confronted a Macedonian invasion force led by Seleucus I in 305 BC and following a brief conflict, an agreement was reached as Seleucus ceded Gandhara and Arachosia and areas south of Bagram to the Mauryas. During the 120 years of the Mauryas in southern Afghanistan, Buddhism was introduced and eventually become one of the major religions alongside Zoroastrianism.\nInscriptions made by Emperor Ashoka, a fragment of Edict 13 in Greek, as well as a full Edict, written in both Greek and Aramaic has been discovered in Kandahar. It is said to be written in excellent Classical Greek, using sophisticated philosophical terms. In this Edict, Ashoka the great used the word Eusebeia (\"Piety\") as the Greek translation for the ubiquitous \"Dharma\" of his other Edicts written in Prakrit.\nMedieval history.\nIslamic conquest\nBetween the 7th and 9th century, the Kandahar region was ruled by the Zunbil dynasty and considered part of the Indian subcontinent, though it was an Eastern Iranic realm which followed Zurvanism. In the 7th century AD, Arab armies conquered the region but failed to convert the entire \npopulation to Islam.The leader of the expedition was Abbad ibn Ziyad, who governed Sijistan between 673 and 681. In AD 870, Yaqub ibn Layth Saffari, a local ruler of the Saffarid dynasty, conquered Kandahar and environs in the name of Islam.\nGhanavids\nIt is believed that the Zunbil dynasty governed the Kandahar region from the 7th century until the late 9th century AD. Kandahar was taken by Sultan Mahmud of Ghazni in the 11th century followed by the Ghurids of Ghor.\nKandahar appears to have been renamed \"Tegin\u0101b\u0101d\" in the 10th\u201312th centuries, but the origin of the new name is unclear. During this period, nearby Panjway served as the administrative center for the area. However, Kandahar was of much more strategic importance, to the extent that Minhaj-i-Siraj attributes the downfall of the Ghaznavids to the loss of Kandahar. The city's name was changed back to Kandahar by the 13th century, after Ala ad-Din Husayn Jahansuz sacked Lashkari Bazar, near Bost. Again, the reason for the name change is not clear.\nMongols\nKandahar was besieged by a Mongol army in 1221, although Jalal al-Din Mangburni defeated them. In 1251, upon accession to the Mongol throne, M\u00f6ngke Khan granted Kandahar, along with other lands in Afghanistan, to Shams ad-Din Mohammad Kart of the Kart dynasty. However, the city is mentioned as being under Chagatai control in 1260\u201361; Kandahar didn't come under Kart control until 1281. Later, in 1318, a Chagatai prince raised an army from Kandahar against the Ilkhanid governor of Sistan. Kandahar was described by Ibn Battuta in 1333 as a large and prosperous town three nights journey from Ghazni.\nTamerlane, founder of the Timurid Empire, captured Kandahar in 1383. He appointed his grandson Pir Muhammad as governor of Kandahar in 1390. Following his death in 1405, the city was ruled by other Timurid governors. Kandahar was entrusted to the Arghuns in the late 15th century, who eventually achieved independence from the Timurids. Guru Nanak, the founder of Sikhism, is believed to have visited the town (c. 1521 AD) during his important journey between Hindustan and Mecca in Arabia.\nMughal and Safavid Era\nTamerlane's descendant, Babur, the founder of the Mughal Empire, annexed Kandahar in 1508. In 1554, Babur's son, Humayun, handed it over to the Safavid Shah Tahmasp in return of 12,000 soldiers he received from the Shah to reconquer India. In 1595, Humayun's son Akbar the Great reconquered the city by diplomacy. Akbar died in 1605 and when this news reached the Persian court, Shah Abbas ordered his army to besiege the city which continued until early 1606 and finally failed due to the reinforcements sent by the Mughal Emperor Jahangir that forced the Safavid retreat. In the Mughal\u2013Safavid War, Kandahar was once again lost to the Safavids. In 1698, Balochs under Samandar Khan and Mir Abdullah Khan Ahmadzai of Kalat State captured Kandahar again. Kandahar was regarded as important to the Mughal Empire because it was one of the gateways to India, and Mughal control over Kandahar helped to prevent foreign intrusions.\nThe memory of the wars fought over Kandahar at this time is preserved in the epic poem \"Qandah\u0101r-n\u0101ma\" (\"The Campaign Against Qandah\u0101r\"), a major work of Saib Tabrizi which is a classic of Persian literature.\nModern (1709\u2013present).\nMirwais Hotak, chief of the Ghilji tribe, revolted in 1709 by killing Gurgin Khan, an ethnic Georgian subject and governor of the Shia Safavid Persians. After establishing the Hotak dynasty in Kandahar, Mirwais and his army successfully defeated subsequent expeditions by Kay Khusraw and Rustam Kh\u00e1n. Mirwais resisted attempts by the Persian government who were seeking to convert the Afghans from Sunni to the Shia sect of Islam. He died of a natural death in November 1715 and was succeeded by his brother Abdul Aziz, but after being suspected of giving Kandahar's sovereignty back to the Persians he was killed by his nephew Mahmud Hotak.\nIn 1722, Mahmud led an army of Afghans to the Safavid capital Isfahan and proclaimed himself King of Persia. The Hotak dynasty was eventually removed from power by a new Persian ruler, Nader Shah. In 1738, Nader Shah invaded Afghanistan and destroyed the now \"Old Kandahar\", which was held by Hussain Hotak and his Ghilji tribes. In the meantime, Nader Shah freed Ahmad Khan (later Ahmad Shah Durrani) and his brother Zulfikar who were held prisoners by the Hotak ruler. Before leaving southern Afghanistan for Delhi in India, Nader Shah laid out the foundation for a new town to be built next to the destroyed ancient city, naming it \"Naderabad\". His rule ended in June 1747 after being murdered by his Persian guards.\nAhmad Shah Durrani, chief of the Durrani tribe, gained control of Kandahar and made it the capital of his new Afghan Empire in October 1747. Initially, Ahmad Shah had trouble finding land on which to build his city. His own tribe had no extensive lands and others who had, such as the Alikozai and Barakzai, refused to give up their lands. Only the Popalzai finally offered him his pick of their lands. The foundations for the city were laid in June 1761. Once begun, the city was built with grand proportions. It was laid out in the form of a regular rectangle with a circumference of three miles; walls 30 feet thick at the bottom and 15 feet at the top, rose 27 feet high to enclose it. Outside, the walls were ringed by a moat 24 feet wide. Six mammoth gateways pierced these walls: the Eid Gah Gate on the north, the Shikarpur Gate on the south; the Herat and Top Khana Gates on the west; and, the Bar Durrani and Kabul Gates on the east. At its peak, Ahmad Shah's empire included present-day Afghanistan, Pakistan, the Khorasan and Kohistan provinces of Iran, along with Punjab in India. In October 1772, Ahmad Shah retired and died from a natural cause. A new city was laid out by Ahmad Shah and is dominated by his mausoleum, which is adjacent to the Mosque of the Cloak in the centre of the city. By 1776, his eldest son Timur Shah had transferred Afghanistan's main capital, due to several conflicts with various Pashtun tribes, from Kandahar to Kabul, where the Durrani legacy continued.\nFrom 1818 to 1855, Kandahar was ruled by half-brothers of Dost Mohammad Khan as an independent principality. In September 1826, Syed Ahmad Shaheed's followers arrived to Kandahar in search of volunteers to help them wage jihad against the Sikh invaders to what is now Pakistan. Led by Ranjit Singh, the Sikhs had captured several of Afghanistan's territories in the east, including what is now Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Kashmir. More than 400 local Kandahar warriors assembled themselves for the jihad. Sayed Din Mohammad Kandharai was appointed as their leader.\nBritish war\nBritish-led Indian forces from neighbouring British India invaded the city in 1839, during the First Anglo-Afghan War, but withdrew in 1842. In November 1855, Dost Mohammad Khan conquered Kandahar. The British and Indian forces returned in 1878 during the Second Anglo-Afghan War. They emerged from the city in July 1880 to confront the forces of Ayub Khan, but were defeated at the Battle of Maiwand. They were again forced to withdraw a few years later, despite winning the Battle of Kandahar.\nKandahar remained peaceful for the next 100 years, except during 1929 when loyalists of Habibullah Kalakani (Bache Saqqaw) placed the fortified city on lock-down and began torturing its population. Nobody was allowed to enter or leave from within the city's tall defensive walls, and as a result of this many people suffered after running out of food supplies. This lasted until October 1929 when Nadir Khan and his Afghan army came to eliminate Kalakani, known as the Tajik bandit from the village of Kalakan in northern Kabul Province.\nDuring Zahir Shah's rule, the city slowly began expanding by adding modern style streets and housing schemes. Although Kandahar remained less international than Kabul, with fewer foreigners in residence and thus no market for coffee, jam, potatoes, or other European produce, a modest German community took root there in the 1930s. Engineers and factory managers, accompanied by their spouses, arrived to supervise wool-processing plants. A Siemens electrical station powered these emerging industries, signaling a step toward the broader modernization taking shape across Afghanistan during this period.\nIn the 1960s, during the rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union, Kandahar International Airport was built by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers next to the city. The U.S. also completed several other major projects in Kandahar and in other parts of southern Afghanistan. In the meantime, Soviet engineers were busy building major infrastructures in other parts of the country, such as Bagram Airfield and Kabul International Airport.\nDuring the 1980s, Soviet\u2013Afghan War, Kandahar city (and the province as a whole) witnessed heavy fighting as it became a centre of resistance as the mujahideen forces waged a strong guerrilla warfare against the Soviet-backed government, who tightly held on control of the city. Government and Soviet troops surrounded the city and subjected it to heavy air bombardment in which many civilians lost their lives. In January 1982 indiscriminate shelling and bombing by the Soviets killed hundreds. 300 civilians were killed during Soviet bombings in July 1984. It was under siege again in April 1986. The city's population was reduced from 200,000 before the war to no more than 25,000 inhabitants, following a months-long campaign of carpet bombing and bulldozing by the Soviets and Afghan communist soldiers in 1987. Kandahar International Airport was used by the Soviet Army during their ten-year troop placement in the country. The city also became a battle ground for the US and Pakistani-backed forces against the pro-Communist government of Afghanistan.\nKandahar underwent a complete sociopolitical collapse in the early 1990s, driven in part by the divide-and-rule tactics of the communist governor-general, Nur ul-Haq Ulumi, who manipulated rival mujahideen factions against each other, and by the rampant greed within both the communist and mujahideen militias. After the Soviet withdrawal and the collapse of Najibullah's government in 1992, Kandahar fell to local mujahideen commander, Gul Agha Sherzai. However Sherzai lacked authority against other local commanders which led to lawlessness in the city, and fighting in 1993. During this time, banditry, rape, and murder became rampant in Kandahar, creating a demand for a more moral and unified alternative. This led to the rise of the \"talibs\" (students), who eventually formed the Taliban movement. By the spring of 1994, the nucleus of the Taliban emirate had begun to take shape, and that year, they launched operations to dismantle warlord militia checkpoints around the city. The talibs gained considerable popularity and legitimacy during this period by defeating these predatory warlords.\nIn August 1994, the Taliban, under Mullah Omar, captured Kandahar from commander Mullah Naqib almost without a fight and turned the city into their headquarters. The capture of Afghanistan's second-largest city marked the Taliban's transformation from a fledgling militia into an Islamic emirate, solidifying their legitimacy as a governing authority through the imposition of a strict interpretation of Islamic law. Formal education for girls was banned as well as the consumption of TV, films, music with instrumental accompaniments, and the playing of sports. In December 1999, a hijacked Indian Airlines Flight 814 plane by Pakistani militants loyal to Harkat-ul-Mujahideen landed at Kandahar International Airport and kept the passengers hostage as part of a demand to release three Pakistani militants from prison in India.\n21st century.\nIn October 2001, as part of Operation Enduring Freedom, the United States Navy began hitting targets inside the city by precision-guided cruise missiles that were fired from the Persian Gulf. These targets were the airport and buildings that were occupied by the Taliban, including Arab families who had arrived several years earlier and were residing in the area. About a month later, the Taliban began surrendering in mass numbers to a private militia that had been formed by Gul Agha Sherzai and Hamid Karzai. Kandahar once again fell into the hands of Sherzai, who had control over the area before the rise of the Taliban. He was transferred in 2003 and replaced by Yousef Pashtun until Asadullah Khalid took the post in 2005. Toryalai Wesa was appointed Governor of the province by President Hamid Karzai in December 2008 after Rahmatullah Raufi's four-month rule.\nIn 2002, Kandahar International Airport started to be used by members of the United States armed forces and NATO's International Security Assistance Force (ISAF). NATO began training the newly formed Afghan National Police and provided security responsibility of the city. The military of Afghanistan, backed by NATO forces, gradually expanded its authority and presence throughout most of the country. The 205th Corps of the Afghan National Army was based at Kandahar and provided military assistance to the south of the country. The Canadian Forces maintained their military command headquarters at Kandahar, heading the Regional Command South of the NATO led International Security Assistance Force in Kandahar Province. The Taliban also had supporters inside the city reporting on events.\nNATO forces expanded the Afghan police force for the prevention of a Taliban comeback in Kandahar, the militants' \"spiritual birthplace\" and a strategic key to ward off the Taliban insurgency, as a part of a larger effort that also aimed to deliver services such as electricity and clean drinking water that the Taliban could not provide \u2013 encouraging support for the government in a city that was once the Taliban's headquarters. The most significant battle between NATO troops and the Taliban lasted throughout the summer of 2006, culminating in Operation Medusa. The Taliban failed to defeat the Western troops in open warfare, which marked a turn in their tactics towards IED emplacement. In June 2008, it was reported that over 1,000 inmates had escaped from Sarposa prison. In Spring 2010, the province and the city of Kandahar became a target of American operations following \"Operation Moshtarak\" in the neighbouring Helmand Province. In March 2010, U.S. and NATO commanders released details of plans for the biggest offensive of the war against the Taliban insurgency.\nIn May 2010, Kandahar International Airport became subject of a combined rocket and ground attack by insurgents, following similar attacks on Kabul and Bagram in the preceding weeks. Although this attack did not lead to many casualties on the side of NATO forces, it did show that the militants are still capable of launching multiple, coordinated operations in Afghanistan. In June 2010, a shura was held by Afghan President Hamid Karzai with tribal and religious leaders of the Kandahar region. The meeting highlighted the need for support of NATO-led forces in order to stabilize parts of the province.\nBy 2011, Kandahar became known as the assassination city of Afghanistan after witnessing many targeted killings. In July Ahmed Wali Karzai, brother of President Hamid Karzai, was shot by his long time head of security. Soon after the Quetta Shura of the Taliban claimed responsibility. The next day an Islamic cleric (mulla) of the famous Red Mosque in the Shahr-e Naw area of the city and a number of other people were killed by a Taliban suicide bomber who had hidden explosives inside his turban. On 27 July 2011, the mayor of the city, Ghulam Haider Hamidi, was assassinated by another Taliban militant who had hidden explosives in his turban. Two deputy mayors had been killed in 2010, while many tribal elders and Islamic clerics have also been assassinated in the last several years. The overwhelming majority of the victims in the attacks are ordinary Afghan civilians. On 6 June 2012, at least 21 civilians were killed and 50 others injured when two Taliban suicide bombers on motorcycles blew themselves up in a market area near Kandahar International Airport.\nOn 4 May 2020, a policewoman was assassinated in the centre of Kandahar, making her the fifth policewoman to be killed during the previous two months in Kandahar. No group claimed responsibility for the killing of the policewomen by the end of the day of the reported event.\nOn 12 August 2021, the Taliban recaptured Kandahar. After days of brutal clashes with ANA soldiers retreating from the city, the Taliban were finally able to capture the city. It became the twelfth provincial capital to be seized by Taliban as part of the wider 2021 Taliban offensive.\nOn 15 October 2021, four suicide bombers killed dozens at a Shia mosque in the city.\nGeography.\nThe Arghandab River runs along the west of Kandahar. The city has 15 districts and a total land area of 27,337 hectares. The total number of dwellings in Kandahar is 61,902.\nOnly 64% of families in Kandahar have access to safe drinking water; 22% of households have access to safe toilet facilities; and 27% of households have access to electricity, with the remainder dependent on public power. Kandahar's transportation infrastructure is well-developed, with 76.8% of the province's roads capable of carrying car traffic in all seasons. However, there are no roads in a minor portion of the province (3.3 percent). In terms of telecommunications, Kandahar City and major roadways are covered by the three major mobile networks AWCC, Roshan, and MTN.\nLand use.\nKandahar is the regional hub in southern Afghanistan, close to the border with Pakistan. Non-built up land use accounts for 59% of the total land area. Within the built-up area, vacant plots occupy a slightly higher percentage of land (36%) than residential land (34%). There is a significant commercial cluster along the road to Pakistan in District 5. India, Iran and Pakistan have consulates here for trade, military and political links.\nClimate.\nKandahar has a hot semi-arid climate (K\u00f6ppen \"BSh\"), that borders on a hot desert climate (\"BWh\"), characterised by little precipitation and high variation between summer and winter temperatures. Summers start in mid-May, last until late September, and are extremely dry. Temperatures peak in July with a 24-hour daily average of around . They are followed by dry autumns from early October to late November, with days still averaging in the 20s \u00b0C (above 68\u00a0\u00b0F) into November, although nights are sharply cooler. Winter begins in December and sees most of its precipitation in the form of rain. Temperatures average in January, although lows can drop well below freezing. They end in early March and are followed by a pleasant spring until late April with temperatures generally in the upper 10s \u00b0C to lower 30s \u00b0C (65\u201388\u00a0\u00b0F) range. Sunny weather dominates year-round, especially in summer, when rainfall is extremely rare. The annual mean temperature is .\nTransport.\nKandahar International Airport serves as southern Afghanistan's main airport for domestic and international flights. It is also used as a major military base as well as shipping and receiving of supplies for the NATO armies. The entire area in and around the airport is heavily guarded but a section is designated for civilian passengers. Most international flights are to the UAE, Iran, India, Saudi Arabia, and Pakistan.\nKandahar is connected to Quetta Pakistan via Chaman and Kabul by the Kabul-Kandahar Highway and to Herat by the Kandahar-Herat Highway. There is a bus station located at the start of the Kabul-Kandahar Highway, where a number of privately owned older-model Mercedes-Benz coach buses are available to take passengers to most major cities of the country. Kandahar is also connected by road to Quetta in neighbouring Pakistan. Due to the ongoing war, the route to Kabul has become increasingly dangerous as insurgent attacks on convoys and destruction of bridges make it an unreliable link between the two cities.\nCommuters in the city of Kandahar use the public bus system (Milli Bus), and taxicabs and rickshaws are common. Private vehicle use is increasing, partially due to road and highway improvements. Large dealerships are importing cars from Dubai, UAE.\nDemographics.\nKandahar has a population of approximately 1,057,500 people in 2008. In the province, there are around 14,445 households, with an average of seven individuals per home. Around 68 percent of Kandahar's population resides in rural districts, with males accounting for 51 percent of the population. Pashtuns are the province's largest ethnic group. Major Pashtun tribes such as the Durrani including Barakzai, Popalzai, Alkozai, Noorzai, Ishaqzai, Achakzai, Maku, and Qizilbash Shia's and Khilji are included. More than 98 percent of the population speaks Pashtu. Only a small percentage of the population speaks Balochi language and Dari. Kochi people (Pashtun Nomads) also live in Kandahar province, and their numbers fluctuate depending on the season, with estimates stating approximately 79,000 in the winter and 39,000 in the summer.\nThe population of Kandahar numbers approximately 651,484 as of 2021[ [update]]. The Pashtuns make up the overwhelming majority population of the city and province \nPashto is the main language in the city and the region. Persian is also understood by a few number of the city dwellers, especially those serving in the government. Both are the official languages of Afghanistan. A 2006 compendium of provincial data prepared by the Afghan Ministry of Rural Rehabilitation and Development and United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA) states:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nThe Pashtun culture, history, traditions, clothing and Pashtunwali is dominant in this region.\nEducation.\nBefore the 1978 coup in Kabul, the majority of the city's population was enrolled in schools. Nearly all of the elite class of the city fled to neighboring Pakistan during the early 1980s, and from there they began immigrating to North America, Europe, Australia and other parts of the world.\nThe two oldest known schools are Ahmad Shah Baba High School and Zarghona Ana High School. There are a number of new schools that opened in the last decade, with more being built in the future as the city's population grows with the large returning Afghans from neighboring countries. Afghan Turk High Schools is one of the top private schools in the city.\nThe main university is the Kandahar University. A number of private higher education institutions have also opened in the last decade such as Benawa Institute of Higher Education, Mirwais Neeka Institute of Higher Education, Malalay Institute of Higher Education and Saba Institute of Higher Education.\nThe adult literacy rate ratio was 16.8% in 2012.https:// \nCommunications.\nTelecommunication services in the city are provided by Afghan Wireless, Roshan, Etisalat, MTN Group and Afghan Telecom. In November 2006, the Afghan Ministry of Communications signed a $64.5 million agreement with ZTE for the establishment of a countrywide fibre optical cable network. This was intended to improve telephone, internet, television and radio broadcast services not just in Kandahar but throughout the country.\nPlaces of interest.\nThe tomb of Ahmad Shah Durrani is located in the city centre, which also houses Durrani's brass helmet and other personal items. In front of Durrani's mausoleum is the Shrine of the Cloak, containing one of the most valued relics in the Islamic world, which was given by the Emir of Bokhara (Murad Beg) to Ahmad Shah Durrani. The Sacred Cloak is kept locked away, taken out only at times of great crisis. Mullah Omar took it out in November 1996 and displayed it to a crowd of \"ulema\" of religious scholars to have himself declared Amir al-Mu'minin (Commander of the Faithful). Prior to that it was taken out when the city was struck by a cholera epidemic in the 1930s.\nThe village of \"Sher Surkh\" is located southeast of the city, in the suburbs of the old city of Nadirabad. Kandahar Museum is located at the western end of the third block of buildings lining the main road east of \"Eidgah Durwaza\" (gate). It has many paintings by the now famous Ghiyassuddin, painted while he was a young teacher in Kandahar. He is acknowledged among Afghanistan's leading artists.\nJust to the north of the city, off its northeast corner at the end of \"buria\" (matting) bazaar, there is a shrine dedicated to a saint who lived in Kandahar more than 300 years ago. The grave of \"Hazratji Baba\", long to signify his greatness, but otherwise covered solely by rock chips, is undecorated save for tall pennants at its head. A monument to Islamic martyrs stands in the centre of Kandahar's main square, called \"Da Shahidanu Chawk\", which was built in the 1940s.\nThe \"Chilzina\" is a rock-cut chamber above the plain at the end of the rugged chain of mountains forming the western defence of Kandahar's \"Old City\". This is here that Ashoka's Kandahar Bilingual Rock Inscription was found. Forty steps, about, lead to the chamber, which is guarded by two chained lions, defaced, and inscribed with an account of Mughal conquest. The rugged cliffs from which the \"Chilzina\" was hewn form the natural western bastion of the \"Old City\" of Kandahar, which was destroyed in 1738 by Nadir Shah Afshar of Persia.\nA short distance from \"Chilzina\", going west on the main highway, a bright blue dome appears on the right. This is the mausoleum of Mirwais Hotak, the Ghiljai chieftain who declared Kandahar's independence from the Persians in 1709. The shrine of Baba Wali Kandhari (Baba Sahib), its terraces shaded by pomegranate groves beside the Arghandab River, is also very popular for picnics and afternoon outings. He was a Muslim pir who had a strange encounter with Guru Nanak at Hasan Abdal in what is now Attock District of Pakistan. The shrine of Baba Wali is important to Muslims and Sikhs. Close to Baba Wali's shrine is a military base established by the United States armed forces in about 2007.\nDevelopment and modernization.\nDecades of war left Kandahar and the rest of the country destroyed and depopulated, but in recent years billions of dollars began pouring in for construction purposes and millions of expats have returned to Afghanistan. New residential areas have been established around the city, and a number of modern style buildings have been constructed.\nSome residents of the city have access to clean drinking water and electricity, and the government is working to extend these services to every home. The city relies on electricity from the Kajaki hydroelectricity plant in neighbouring Helmand, which is being upgraded or expanded. About north of the city is the Dahla Dam, the second largest dam in Afghanistan.\nThe \"Aino Mina\" is a new housing project for up to two million people on the northern edge of the city. Originally called the \"Kandahar Valley\" and started by Mahmud Karzai, it was announced that the project would build up to 20,000 single-family homes and associated infrastructure such as roads, water and sewer systems, and community buildings, including schools.\nIt recently won 2 awards, the \"Residential Project\" and \"Sustainable Project\" of the Year at the Middle East Architect Awards. Many of the high-ranking government employees and civil servants as well as wealthy businessmen live in this area, which is a more secured community in Kandahar. Work on the next $100\u00a0million scheme was initiated in 2011.\nAlso, construction of Hamidi Township in the Morchi Kotal area of the city began in August 2011. It is named after Ghulam Haider Hamidi, the mayor of Kandahar who was assassinated by militants in late July 2011. Situated along the Kandahar-Uruzgan Highway in the northeast of the city, the new township will have 2,000 residential and commercial plots. Including new roads, schools, commercial markets, clinics, canals and other facilities.\nAbout east of Kandahar, a huge industrial park is under construction with modern facilities. The park will have professional management for the daily maintenance of public roads, internal streets, common areas, parking areas, 24 hours perimeter security, access control for vehicles and persons.\nNeighborhoods.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nCultural sites and parks.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nMosques and shrines.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nShopping.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nHospitals.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nNotable people.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFootnotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\nPublished in the 19th century\nPublished in the 20th century\nPublished in the 21st century"}

He was one of the earliest promoters of the Protestant Reformation in Silesia.\nSchwenckfeld came to Reformation principles through Thomas M\u00fcntzer and Andreas Karlstadt. However, he developed his own principles and fell out with Martin Luther over the eucharistic controversy (1524). He had his own views on the sacraments, known as the Heavenly Flesh doctrine, that were developed in close association with Valentin Crautwald, his humanist colleague. His followers became a new sect, which was outlawed in Germany. Its ideas were influenced by Anabaptism, Pietism in Europe, and Puritanism in England.\nMany of his followers were persecuted in Europe and thus forced to either convert or flee. Because of this, there are Schwenkfelder Church congregations in the United States, which was then the Thirteen Colonies of British America until American independence was achieved following the American Revolutionary War.\nEarly life and education.\nSchwenckfeld was born in Ossig near Liegnitz, Silesia now Osiek, near Legnica, Poland, to noble parents in 1489. Between 1505 and 1507, he was a student in Cologne. In 1507, he enrolled at the University of Frankfurt on the Oder. Between 1511 and 1523, Schwenckfeld served the Duchy of Liegnitz as an adviser to Duke Charles I (1511\u20131515), Duke George I (1515\u20131518), and Duke Frederick II (1518\u20131523).\nCareer.\nIn 1518 or 1519, Schwenckfeld experienced an awakening that he called a \"visitation of God\". Martin Luther's writings had a deep influence on Schwenckfeld, and he embraced the \"Lutheran\" Reformation and became a student of the scriptures. In 1521, Schwenckfeld began to preach the gospel, and in 1522 won Duke Friedrich II over to Protestantism. He organized a Brotherhood of his converts for the purpose of study and prayer in 1523. In 1525, he rejected Luther's idea of real presence and came to a spiritual interpretation of the Lord's Supper, which was subsequently rejected by Luther. \nSchwenckfeld began to teach that the true believer ate the spiritual body of Christ. He pushed for reformation wherever he went, but also criticized reformers that he thought went to extremes. He emphasized that for one to be a true Christian, one must not change only outwardly but inwardly. Because of the communion and other controversies, Schwenckfeld broke with Luther and followed what some describe as a \"middle way\". Because of his break from Luther and the Magisterial Reformation, scholars typically categorize Schwenckfeld as a member of the Radical Reformation. He voluntarily exiled himself from Silesia in 1529 in order to relieve pressure on and embarrassment of his duke. He lived in Strasbourg from 1529 to 1534, and then in Swabia.\nTeachings.\nSome of the teachings of Schwenckfeld included opposition to war, secret societies, and oath-taking, that the government had no right to command one's conscience, that regeneration is by grace through inner work of the Spirit, that believers feed on Christ spiritually, and that believers must give evidence of regeneration. He rejected infant baptism, outward church forms, and \"denominations\". His views on the Eucharist prompted Luther to publish several sermons on the subject in his 1526 \"The Sacrament of the Body and Blood of Christ\u2014Against the Fanatics\".\nPublications.\nIn 1540 Luther expelled Schwenckfeld from Silesia. In 1541, Schwenckfeld published the \"Great Confession on the Glory of Christ\". Many considered the writing to be heretical. He taught that Christ had two natures, divine and human, but that he became progressively more divine. He also published a number of works about interpreting the scriptures during the 1550s, often responding to the rebuttals of the Lutheran Reformer Matthias Flacius Illyricus.\nSchwenckfeld's \"Theriotropheum Silesiae\" is considered the world's oldest published local faunal list, containing a list of the animals of Silesia, including 150 bird species.\nDeath.\nIn 1561, Schwenckfeld became sick with dysentery, and gradually grew weaker until he died in Ulm on the morning of December 10, 1561. Due to his enemies, the fact of his death and the place of his burial were kept secret.\nSchwenkfelder Church.\nSchwenckfeld did not organize a separate church during his lifetime, but followers seemed to gather around his writings and sermons. In 1700, there were about 1,500 of them in Lower Silesia. Many fled Lower Silesia under persecution of the Austrian emperor, and some found refuge on the lands of Count Nicolaus Ludwig Zinzendorf and his . These followers became known as Schwenkfelders. A group arrived in Philadelphia in 1731, followed by five more migrations up to 1737. In 1782, the Society of Schwenkfelders was formed, and in 1909 the Schwenkfelder Church was organized.\nSchwenkfelder Church has remained small with approximately 2,695 total members as of 2010, and four churches, including Schwenkfelder Missionary Church in Philadelphia. Each of its the existing churches are within a radius of Philadelphia.\nSchwenkfelder Library &amp; Heritage Center.\nSchwenkfelder Library &amp; Heritage Center is a small museum, library and archives in Pennsburg, Pennsylvania. It is the only institution dedicated to the preservation and interpretation of the history of Schwenkfelder, including Schwenckfeld, the Radical Reformation, religious toleration, the Schwenkfelders in Europe and America, and the Schwenkfelder Church. The Schwenkfelder Library &amp; Heritage Center hosts exhibits and programs throughout the year.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

With more than twenty optical and two radio telescopes, it is one of the largest gatherings of astronomical instruments in the Earth's northern hemisphere.\nKitt Peak National Observatory was founded in 1958. It is home to what was the largest solar telescope in the world, and many large astronomical telescopes of the late 20th century in the United States.\nThe observatory was administered by the National Optical Astronomy Observatory (NOAO) from the early 1980s until 2019, after which it was overseen by NOIRLab.\nIn June 2022, the Contreras Fire led to the evacuation of Kitt Peak. The fire reached the summit at 2 a.m. on Friday, June 17. Four non-scientific buildings, including a dormitory, were lost in the fire. 15 months later in September 2023, the observatory reopened to the public.\nGeneral information.\nKitt Peak was selected by its first director, Aden B. Meinel, in 1958 as the site for a national observatory under contract with the National Science Foundation (NSF) and was administered by the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy. The land was leased from the Tohono O\u02bcodham under a perpetual agreement. The second director (1960 to 1971) was Nicholas U. Mayall. In 1982, NOAO was formed to consolidate the management of three optical observatories \u2014 Kitt Peak; the National Solar Observatory facilities at Kitt Peak and Sacramento Peak, New Mexico; and the Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory in Chile. The observatory sites are under lease from the Tohono O'odham Nation at the amount of a quarter dollar per acre yearly, which was overwhelmingly approved by the Council in the 1950s. In 2005, the Tohono O'odham Nation brought suit against the National Science Foundation to stop further construction of gamma ray detectors in the Gardens of the Sacred Tohono O'odham Spirit I'itoi, which are just below the summit.\nThe largest optical instruments at KPNO are the Mayall 4 meter telescope and the WIYN 3.5-meter telescope; there are also several two- and one-meter class telescopes. The McMath\u2013Pierce solar telescope was for many decades the largest solar telescope in the world and the largest unobstructed reflector (no secondary mirror in the path of incoming light). The ARO 12m Radio Telescope is also at the location.\nKitt Peak is famous for hosting the first telescope (an old 91\u00a0cm reflector) used to search for near-Earth asteroids, and calculating the probability of an impact with planet Earth.\nKitt Peak hosts an array of programs for the public to take part in, including:\nKitt Peak's Southeastern Association for Research and Astronomy (SARA) Telescope was featured in the WIPB-PBS documentary, \"Seeing Stars in Indiana\". The project followed SARA astronomers from Ball State University to the observatory and featured time-lapse images from various points around Kitt Peak.\nA major project started in the 2010s is the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) for the 4-meter Mayall telescope, for conducting spectrographic astronomical surveys of distant galaxies probing the expansion history of the universe and the mysterious physics of dark energy.\nHistory.\nThe Kitt Peak National Observatory of the United States was dedicated on March 16, 1960. At the dedication a 36-inch telescope and various facilities were ready. Construction was underway for the then planned 84 inch telescope. (i.e. the KPNO 2.1 meter)\nThe 84 inch (2.1 m) had its first light in September 1964.\nOver the decades the mountaintop hosted many telescopes, and achieved a variety of discoveries. Some examples of astronomical research KPNO contributed to include the study of dark matter, cosmic distances, high-redshift galaxies, and the Bo\u00f6tes Void. In addition, the observatory has engaged in variety of public outreach and education programs.\nIn 2018, KPNO established plans for its \"Windows on the Universe Center for Astronomy Outreach.\"\nNotable discoveries.\nIn 1976 the Mayall Telescope was used to discover methane ice on Pluto.\nThe 90\u00a0cm Spacewatch telescope was used to discover the Kuiper belt body, 20000 Varuna in the year 2000. This was discovered by an astronomer noticing the slow moving object in a blink comparison.\nClimate.\nDue to its high elevation, the observatory experiences a subtropical highland climate (Cfb) with a much cooler and wetter climate throughout the year than most of the Sonoran Desert.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He is known for his groundbreaking work in electronic music, having been called the \"father of electronic music\", for introducing controlled chance (aleatory techniques) into serial composition, and for musical spatialization.\nStockhausen was educated at the Hochschule f\u00fcr Musik K\u00f6ln and the University of Cologne, later studying with Olivier Messiaen in Paris and with Werner Meyer-Eppler at the University of Bonn. As one of the leading figures of the Darmstadt School, his compositions and theories were and remain widely influential, not only on composers of art music, but also on jazz and popular music. His works, composed over a period of nearly sixty years, eschew traditional forms. In addition to electronic music\u00a0\u2013 both with and without live performers\u00a0\u2013 they range from miniatures for musical boxes through works for solo instruments, songs, chamber music, choral and orchestral music, to a cycle of seven full-length operas. His theoretical and other writings comprise ten large volumes. He received numerous prizes and distinctions for his compositions, recordings, and for the scores produced by his publishing company.\nHis notable compositions include the series of nineteen \"Klavierst\u00fccke\" (Piano Pieces), \"Kontra-Punkte\" for ten instruments, the electronic/musique-concr\u00e8te \"Gesang der J\u00fcnglinge\", \"Gruppen\" for three orchestras, the percussion solo \"Zyklus\", \"Kontakte\", the cantata \"Momente\", the live-electronic \"Mikrophonie I\", \"Hymnen\", \"Stimmung\" for six vocalists, \"Aus den sieben Tagen\", \"Mantra\" for two pianos and electronics, \"Tierkreis\", \"Inori\" for soloists and orchestra, and the gigantic opera cycle \"Licht\".\nHe died at the age of 79, on 5 December 2007 at his home in K\u00fcrten, Germany.\nBiography.\nChildhood.\nStockhausen was born in Burg M\u00f6drath, the \"castle\" of the village of M\u00f6drath. The village, located near Kerpen in the Cologne region, was displaced in 1956 to make way for lignite strip mining, but the castle itself still stands. Despite its name, the building is more a manor house than a castle. Built in 1830 by a local businessman named Arend, it was called by locals \"Burg M\u00f6drath\". From 1925 to 1932 it was the maternity home of the Bergheim district, and after the war it served for a time as a shelter for war refugees. In 1950, the owners, the D\u00fcsseldorf chapter of the Knights of Malta, turned it into an orphanage, but it was subsequently returned to private ownership and became a private residence again. In 2017, an anonymous patron purchased the house and opened it in April 2017 as an exhibition space for modern art, with the first floor to be used as the permanent home of the museum of the WDR Electronic Music Studio, where Stockhausen had worked from 1953 until shortly before WDR closed the studio in 2000.\nHis father, Simon Stockhausen, was a schoolteacher, and his mother Gertrud (n\u00e9e Stupp) was the daughter of a prosperous family of farmers in Neurath in the Cologne Bight. A daughter, Katherina, was born the year after Karlheinz, and a second son, Hermann-Josef (\"Herm\u00e4nnchen\") followed in 1932. Gertrud played the piano and accompanied her own singing but, after three pregnancies in as many years, experienced a mental breakdown and was institutionalized in December 1932, followed a few months later by the death of her younger son, Hermann.\nFrom the age of seven, Stockhausen lived in Altenberg, where he received his first piano lessons from the Protestant organist of the Altenberger Dom, Franz-Josef Kloth. In 1938, his father remarried. His new wife, Luzia, had been the family's housekeeper. The couple had two daughters. Because his relationship with his new stepmother was less than happy, in January 1942 Karlheinz became a boarder at the teachers' training college in Xanten, where he continued his piano training and also studied oboe and violin. In 1941, he learned that his mother had died, ostensibly from leukemia, although everyone at the same hospital had supposedly died of the same disease. It was generally understood that she had been a victim of the Nazi policy of killing \"useless eaters\". The official letter to the family falsely claimed she had died 16 June 1941, but recent research by Lisa Quernes, a student at the Landesmusikgymnasium in Montabaur, has determined that she was murdered in the gas chamber, along with 89 other people, at the Hadamar Killing Facility in Hesse-Nassau on 27 May 1941. Stockhausen dramatized his mother's death in hospital by lethal injection, in Act 1 scene 2 (\"\") of the opera \"Donnerstag aus Licht\".\nIn late 1944, Stockhausen was conscripted to serve as a stretcher bearer in Bedburg. In February 1945, he met his father for the last time in Altenberg. Simon, who was on leave from the front, told his son, \"I'm not coming back. Look after things.\" By the end of the war, his father was regarded as missing in action, and may have been killed in Hungary. A comrade later reported to Karlheinz that he saw his father wounded in action. Fifty-five years after the fact, a journalist writing for \"The Guardian\" stated that Simon Stockhausen was killed in Hungary in 1945.\nEducation.\nFrom 1947 to 1951, Stockhausen studied music pedagogy and piano at the Hochschule f\u00fcr Musik K\u00f6ln (Cologne Conservatory of Music) and musicology, philosophy, and German studies at the University of Cologne. He had training in harmony and counterpoint, the latter with Hermann Schroeder, but he did not develop a real interest in composition until 1950. He was admitted at the end of that year to the class of Swiss composer Frank Martin, who had just begun a seven-year tenure in Cologne. At the Darmst\u00e4dter Ferienkurse in 1951, Stockhausen met Belgian composer Karel Goeyvaerts, who had just completed studies with Olivier Messiaen (analysis) and Darius Milhaud (composition) in Paris, and Stockhausen resolved to do likewise. He arrived in Paris on 8 January 1952 and began attending Messiaen's courses in aesthetics and analysis, as well as Milhaud's composition classes. He continued with Messiaen for a year, but he was disappointed with Milhaud and abandoned his lessons after a few weeks. In March 1953, he left Paris to take up a position as assistant to Herbert Eimert at the newly established Electronic Music Studio of Nordwestdeutscher Rundfunk (NWDR) (from 1 January 1955, Westdeutscher Rundfunk, or WDR) in Cologne. In 1963, he succeeded Eimert as director of the studio. From 1954 to 1956, he studied phonetics, acoustics, and information theory with Werner Meyer-Eppler at the University of Bonn. Together with Eimert, Stockhausen edited the journal \"Die Reihe\" from 1955 to 1962.\nCareer and adult life.\nFamily and home.\nOn 29 December 1951, in Hamburg, Stockhausen married Doris Andreae. Together they had four children: Suja (b. 1953), Christel (b. 1956), Markus (b. 1957), and Majella (b. 1961). They were divorced in 1965. On 3 April 1967, in San Francisco, he married Mary Bauermeister, with whom he had two children: Julika (b. 22 January 1966) and Simon (b. 1967). They were divorced in 1972.\nFour of Stockhausen's children became professional musicians, and he composed some of his works specifically for them. A large number of pieces for the trumpet\u00a0\u2013 from \"Sirius\" (1975\u201377) to the trumpet version of \"In Freundschaft\" (1997)\u00a0\u2013 were composed for and premi\u00e8red by his son Markus. Markus, at the age of 4 years, had performed the part of The Child in the Cologne premi\u00e8re of \"Originale\", alternating performances with his sister Christel. \"Klavierst\u00fcck XII\" and \"Klavierst\u00fcck XIII\" (and their versions as scenes from the operas \"Donnerstag aus Licht\" and \"Samstag aus Licht\") were written for his daughter Majella, and were first performed by her at the ages of 16 and 20, respectively. The saxophone duet in the second act of \"Donnerstag aus Licht\", and a number of synthesizer parts in the \"Licht\" operas, including \"Klavierst\u00fcck XV\" (\"Synthi-Fou\") from \"Dienstag\", were composed for his son Simon, who also assisted his father in the production of the electronic music from \"Freitag aus Licht\". His daughter Christel is a flautist who performed and gave a course on interpretation of \"Tierkreis\" in 1977, later published as an article.\nIn 1961, Stockhausen acquired a parcel of land in the vicinity of K\u00fcrten, a village east of Cologne, near Bergisch Gladbach in the Bergisches Land. He had a house built there, which was designed to his specifications by the architect Erich Schneider-Wessling, and he resided there from its completion in the autumn of 1965.\nTeaching.\nAfter lecturing at the Internationale Ferienkurse f\u00fcr Neue Musik at Darmstadt (first in 1953), Stockhausen gave lectures and concerts in Europe, North America, and Asia. He was guest professor of composition at the University of Pennsylvania in 1965 and at the University of California, Davis in 1966\u201367. He founded and directed the Cologne Courses for New Music from 1963 to 1968, and was appointed Professor of Composition at the Hochschule f\u00fcr Musik K\u00f6ln in 1971, where he taught until 1977. In 1998, he founded the Stockhausen Courses, which are held annually in K\u00fcrten.\nPublishing activities.\nFrom the mid-1950s onward, Stockhausen designed (and in some cases arranged to have printed) his own musical scores for his publisher, Universal Edition, which often involved unconventional devices. The score for his piece \"Refrain\", for instance, includes a rotatable (refrain) on a transparent plastic strip. Early in the 1970s, he ended his agreement with Universal Edition and began publishing his own scores under the Stockhausen-Verlag imprint. This arrangement allowed him to extend his notational innovations (for example, dynamics in \"Weltparlament\" [the first scene of \"Mittwoch aus Licht\"] are coded in colour) and resulted in eight German Music Publishers Society Awards between 1992 (\"Luzifers Tanz\") and 2005 (\"Hoch-Zeiten\", from \"Sonntag aus Licht\"). The \"Momente\" score, published just before Stockhausen's death in 2007, won this prize for the ninth time.\nIn the early 1990s, Stockhausen reacquired the licenses to most of the recordings of his music he had made to that point, and started his own record company to make this music permanently available on Compact Disc.\nDeath.\nStockhausen died of sudden heart failure on the morning of 5 December 2007 in K\u00fcrten, North Rhine-Westphalia. The night before, he had finished a recently commissioned work for performance by the Mozart Orchestra of Bologna. He was 79 years old.\nCompositions.\nStockhausen wrote 370 individual works. He often departs radically from musical tradition and his work is influenced by Olivier Messiaen, Edgard Var\u00e8se, and Anton Webern, as well as by film and by painters such as Piet Mondrian and Paul Klee.\n1950s.\nStockhausen began to compose in earnest only during his third year at the conservatory. His early student compositions remained out of the public eye until, in 1971, he published \"Ch\u00f6re f\u00fcr Doris\", \"Drei Lieder\" for alto voice and chamber orchestra, \"Choral\" for a cappella choir (all three from 1950), and a Sonatine for violin and piano (1951).\nIn August 1951, just after his first Darmstadt visit, Stockhausen began working with a form of athematic serial composition that rejected the twelve-tone technique of Schoenberg. He characterized many of these earliest compositions (together with the music of other, like-minded composers of the period) as \"punktuelle Musik\", \"punctual\" or \"pointist\" music, commonly mistranslated as \"pointillist\", though one critic concluded after analysing several of these early works that Stockhausen \"never really composed punctually\". Compositions from this phase include \"Kreuzspiel\" (1951), the \"Klavierst\u00fccke I\u2013IV\" (1952\u00a0\u2013 the fourth of this first set of four \"Klavierst\u00fccke\", titled \"Klavierst\u00fcck IV\", is specifically cited by Stockhausen as an example of \"punctual music\", and the first (unpublished) versions of \"Punkte\" and \"Kontra-Punkte\" (1952). However, several works from these same years show Stockhausen formulating his \"first really ground-breaking contribution to the theory and, above all, practice of composition\", that of \"group composition\", found in Stockhausen's works as early as 1952 and continuing throughout his compositional career. This principle was first publicly described by Stockhausen in a radio talk from December 1955, titled \"Gruppenkomposition: \"Klavierst\u00fcck I\"\".\nIn December 1952, he composed a \"Konkrete Et\u00fcde\", realized in Pierre Schaeffer's Paris musique concr\u00e8te studio. In March 1953, he moved to the NWDR studio in Cologne and turned to electronic music with two \"Electronic Studies\" (1953 and 1954), and then introducing spatial placements of sound sources with his mixed \"concr\u00e8te\" and electronic work \"Gesang der J\u00fcnglinge\" (1955\u201356). Experiences gained from the \"Studies\" made plain that it was an unacceptable oversimplification to regard timbres as stable entities. Reinforced by his studies with Meyer-Eppler, beginning in 1955, Stockhausen formulated new \"statistical\" criteria for composition, focussing attention on the aleatoric, directional tendencies of sound movement, \"the change from one state to another, with or without returning motion, as opposed to a fixed state\". Stockhausen later wrote, describing this period in his compositional work, \"The first revolution occurred from 1952/53 as \"musique concr\u00e8te\", \"electronic tape music\", and \"space music\", entailing composition with transformers, generators, modulators, magnetophones, etc; the integration of all concrete and abstract (synthetic) sound possibilities (also all noises), and the controlled projection of sound in space\". His position as \"the leading German composer of his generation\" was established with \"Gesang der J\u00fcnglinge\" and three concurrently composed pieces in different media: \"Zeitma\u00dfe\" for five woodwinds, \"Gruppen\" for three orchestras, and \"Klavierst\u00fcck XI\". The principles underlying the latter three compositions are presented in Stockhausen's best-known theoretical article, \"... wie die Zeit vergeht ...\" (\"... How Time Passes ...\"), first published in 1957 in vol. 3 of \"Die Reihe\".\nHis work with electronic music and its utter fixity led him to explore modes of instrumental and vocal music in which performers' individual capabilities and the circumstances of a particular performance (e.g., hall acoustics) may determine certain aspects of a composition. He called this \"variable form\". In other cases, a work may be presented from a number of different perspectives. In \"Zyklus\" (1959), for example, he began using graphic notation for instrumental music. The score is written so that the performance can start on any page, and it may be read upside down, or from right to left, as the performer chooses. Still other works permit different routes through the constituent parts. Stockhausen called both of these possibilities \"polyvalent form\", which may be either open form (essentially incomplete, pointing beyond its frame), as with \"Klavierst\u00fcck XI\" (1956), or \"closed form\" (complete and self-contained) as with \"Momente\" (1962\u201364/69).\nIn many of his works, elements are played off against one another, simultaneously and successively: in \"Kontra-Punkte\" (\"Against Points\", 1952\u201353), which, in its revised form became his official \"opus 1\", a process leading from an initial \"point\" texture of isolated notes toward a florid, ornamental ending is opposed by a tendency from diversity (six timbres, dynamics, and durations) toward uniformity (timbre of solo piano, a nearly constant soft dynamic, and fairly even durations). In \"Gruppen\" (1955\u201357), fanfares and passages of varying speed (superimposed durations based on the harmonic series) are occasionally flung between three full orchestras, giving the impression of movement in space.\nIn his \"Kontakte\" for electronic sounds (optionally with piano and percussion) (1958\u201360), he achieved for the first time an isomorphism of the four parameters of pitch, duration, dynamics, and timbre.\n1960s.\nIn 1960, Stockhausen returned to the composition of vocal music (for the first time since \"Gesang der J\u00fcnglinge\") with \"Carr\u00e9\" for four orchestras and four choirs. Two years later, he began an expansive cantata titled \"Momente\" (1962\u201364/69), for solo soprano, four choir groups and thirteen instrumentalists. In 1963, Stockhausen created \"Plus-Minus\", \"2 \u00d7 7 pages for realisation\" containing basic note materials and a complex system of transformations to which those materials are to be subjected in order to produce an unlimited number of different compositions. Through the rest of the 1960s, he continued to explore such possibilities of \"process composition\" in works for live performance, such as \"Prozession\" (1967), \"Kurzwellen\", and \"Spiral\" (both 1968), culminating in the verbally described \"intuitive music\" compositions of \"Aus den sieben Tagen\" (1968) and \"F\u00fcr kommende Zeiten\" (1968\u201370). Some of his later works, such as \"Ylem\" (1972) and the first three parts of \"Herbstmusik\" (1974), also fall under this rubric. Several of these process compositions were featured in the all-day programmes presented at Expo 70, for which Stockhausen composed two more similar pieces, \"Pole\" for two players, and \"Expo\" for three. In other compositions, such as \"Stop\" for orchestra (1965), \"Adieu\" for wind quintet (1966), and the \"Dr. K Sextett\", which was written in 1968\u201369 in honour of Alfred Kalmus of Universal Edition, he presented his performers with more restricted improvisational possibilities.\nHe pioneered live electronics in \"Mixtur\" (1964/67/2003) for orchestra and electronics, \"Mikrophonie I\" (1964) for tam-tam, two microphones, two filters with potentiometers (6 players), \"Mikrophonie II\" (1965) for choir, Hammond organ, and four ring modulators, and \"Solo\" for a melody instrument with feedback (1966). Improvisation also plays a part in all of these works, but especially in \"Solo\". He also composed two electronic works for tape, \"Telemusik\" (1966) and \"Hymnen\" (1966\u201367). The latter also exists in a version with partially improvising soloists, and the third of its four \"regions\" in a version with orchestra. At this time, Stockhausen also began to incorporate pre-existent music from world traditions into his compositions. \"Telemusik\" was the first overt example of this trend.\nIn 1968, Stockhausen composed the vocal sextet \"Stimmung\", for the Collegium Vocale K\u00f6ln, an hour-long work based entirely on the overtones of a low B-flat. In the following year, he created \"Fresco\" for four orchestral groups, a \"Wandelmusik\" (\"foyer music\") composition. This was intended to be played for about five hours in the foyers and grounds of the Beethovenhalle auditorium complex in Bonn, before, after, and during a group of (in part simultaneous) concerts of his music in the auditoriums of the facility. The overall project was given the title \"Musik f\u00fcr die Beethovenhalle\". This had precedents in two collective-composition seminar projects that Stockhausen gave at Darmstadt in 1967 and 1968: \"Ensemble\" and \"Musik f\u00fcr ein Haus\", and would have successors in the \"park music\" composition for five spatially separated groups, \"Sternklang\" (\"Star Sounds\") of 1971, the orchestral work \"Trans\", composed in the same year and the thirteen simultaneous \"musical scenes for soloists and duets\" titled \"Alphabet f\u00fcr Li\u00e8ge\" (1972).\nSpace music and Expo '70.\nSince the mid-1950s, Stockhausen had been developing concepts of spatialization in his works, not only in electronic music, such as the 5-channel \"Gesang der J\u00fcnglinge\" (1955\u201356) and \"Telemusik\" (1966), and 4-channel \"Kontakte\" (1958\u201360) and \"Hymnen\" (1966\u201367). Instrumental/vocal works like \"Gruppen\" for three orchestras (1955\u201357) and \"Carr\u00e9\" for four orchestras and four choirs (1959\u201360) also exhibit this trait. In lectures such as \"Music in Space\" from 1958, he called for new kinds of concert halls to be built, \"suited to the requirements of spatial music\". His idea was &lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;a spherical space which is fitted all around with loudspeakers. In the middle of this spherical space a sound-permeable, transparent platform would be suspended for the listeners. They could hear music composed for such standardized spaces coming from above, from below and from all points of the compass. In 1968, the West German government invited Stockhausen to collaborate on the German Pavilion at the 1970 World Fair in Osaka and to create a joint multimedia project for it with artist Otto Piene. Other collaborators on the project included the pavilion's architect, Fritz Bornemann, Fritz Winckel, director of the Electronic Music Studio at Technische Universit\u00e4t Berlin, and engineer Max Mengeringhausen. The pavilion theme was \"gardens of music\", in keeping with which Bornemann intended \"planting\" the exhibition halls beneath a broad lawn, with a connected auditorium \"sprouting\" above ground. Initially, Bornemann conceived this auditorium in the form of an amphitheatre, with a central orchestra podium and surrounding audience space. In the summer of 1968, Stockhausen met with Bornemann and persuaded him to change this conception to a spherical space with the audience in the centre, surrounded by loudspeaker groups in seven rings at different \"latitudes\" around the interior walls of the sphere.\nAlthough Stockhausen and Piene's planned multimedia project, titled \"Hinab-Hinauf\", was developed in detail, the World Fair committee rejected their concept as too extravagant and instead asked Stockhausen to present daily five-hour programs of his music. Stockhausen's works were performed for 5\u00bd hours every day over a period of 183 days to a total audience of about a million listeners. According to Stockhausen's biographer, Michael Kurtz, \"Many visitors felt the spherical auditorium to be an oasis of calm amidst the general hubbub, and after a while it became one of the main attractions of Expo 1970\".\n1970s.\nBeginning with \"Mantra\" for two pianos and electronics (1970), Stockhausen turned to formula composition, a technique which involves the projection and multiplication of a single, double, or triple melodic-line formula. Sometimes, as in \"Mantra\" and the large orchestral composition with mime soloists, \"Inori\", the simple formula is stated at the outset as an introduction. He continued to use this technique (e.g., in the two related solo-clarinet pieces, \"Harlekin\" [Harlequin] and \"Der kleine Harlekin\" [The Little Harlequin] of 1975, and the orchestral \"Jubil\u00e4um\" [Jubilee] of 1977) through the completion of the opera-cycle \"Licht\" in 2003. Some works from the 1970s did not employ formula technique\u00a0\u2013 e.g., the vocal duet \"Am Himmel wandre ich\" (In the Sky I am Walking, one of the 13 components of the multimedia \"Alphabet f\u00fcr Li\u00e8ge\", 1972, which Stockhausen developed in conversation with the British biophysicist and lecturer on mystical aspects of sound vibration Jill Purce), \"Laub und Regen\" (Leaves and Rain, from the theatre piece \"Herbstmusik\" (1974), the unaccompanied-clarinet composition \"Amour\", and the choral opera \"Atmen gibt das Leben\" (Breathing Gives Life, 1974/77)\u00a0\u2013 but nevertheless share its simpler, melodically oriented style. Two such pieces, \"Tierkreis\" (\"Zodiac\", 1974\u201375) and \"In Freundschaft\" (In Friendship, 1977, a solo piece with versions for virtually every orchestral instrument), have become Stockhausen's most widely performed and recorded compositions.\nThis dramatic simplification of style provided a model for a new generation of German composers, loosely associated under the label \"neue Einfachheit\" or New Simplicity. The best-known of these composers is Wolfgang Rihm, who studied with Stockhausen in 1972\u201373. His orchestral composition \"Sub-Kontur\" (1974\u201375) quotes the formula of Stockhausen's \"Inori\" (1973\u201374), and he has also acknowledged the influence of \"Momente\" on this work.\nOther large works by Stockhausen from this decade include the orchestral \"Trans\" (1971) and two music-theatre compositions utilizing the \"Tierkreis\" melodies: \"Musik im Bauch\" (\"Music in the Belly\") for six percussionists (1975), and the science-fiction \"opera\" \"Sirius\" (1975\u201377) for eight-channel electronic music with soprano, bass, trumpet, and bass clarinet, which has four different versions for the four seasons, each lasting over an hour and a half.\n1977\u20132003.\nBetween 1977 and 2003, Stockhausen composed seven operas in a cycle titled \"Licht: Die sieben Tage der Woche\" (\"Light: The Seven Days of the Week\"). The \"Licht\" cycle deals with the traits associated in various historical traditions with each weekday (Monday = birth and fertility, Tuesday = conflict and war, Wednesday = reconciliation and cooperation, Thursday = traveling and learning, etc.) and with the relationships between three archetypal characters: Michael, Lucifer, and Eve. Each of these characters dominates one of the operas (\"Donnerstag\" [Thursday], \"Samstag\" [Saturday], and \"Montag\" [Monday], respectively), the three possible pairings are foregrounded in three others, and the equal combination of all three is featured in \"Mittwoch\" (Wednesday).\nStockhausen's conception of opera was based significantly on ceremony and ritual, with influence from the Japanese Noh theatre, as well as Judeo-Christian and Vedic traditions. In 1968, at the time of the composition of \"Aus den sieben Tagen\", Stockhausen had read a biography by Satprem about the Bengali guru Sri Aurobindo, and subsequently he also read many of the published writings by Aurobindo himself. The title of \"Licht\" owes something to Aurobindo's theory of \"Agni\" (the Hindu and Vedic fire deity), developed from two basic premises of nuclear physics; Stockhausen's definition of a formula and, especially, his conception of the \"Licht\" superformula, also owes a great deal to Sri Aurobindo's category of the \"supramental\". Similarly, his approach to voice and text sometimes departed from traditional usage: Characters were as likely to be portrayed by instrumentalists or dancers as by singers, and a few parts of \"Licht\" (e.g., \"Luzifers Traum\" from \"Samstag\", \"Welt-Parlament\" from \"Mittwoch\", \"Lichter-Wasser\" and \"Hoch-Zeiten\" from \"Sonntag\") use written or improvised texts in simulated or invented languages.\nThe seven operas were not composed in \"weekday order\" but rather starting (apart from \"Jahreslauf\" in 1977, which became the first act of \"Dienstag\") with the \"solo\" operas and working toward the more complex ones: \"Donnerstag\" (1978\u201380), \"Samstag\" (1981\u201383), \"Montag\" (1984\u201388), \"Dienstag\" (1977/1987\u201391), \"Freitag\" (1991\u201394), \"Mittwoch\" (1995\u201397), and finally \"Sonntag\" (1998\u20132003).\nStockhausen had dreams of flying throughout his life, and these dreams are reflected in the \"Helikopter-Streichquartett\" (the third scene of \"Mittwoch aus Licht\"), completed in 1993. In it, the four members of a string quartet perform in four helicopters flying independent flight paths over the countryside near the concert hall. The sounds they play are mixed together with the sounds of the helicopters and played through speakers to the audience in the hall. Videos of the performers are also transmitted back to the concert hall. The performers are synchronized with the aid of a click track, transmitted to them and heard over headphones.\nThe first performance of the piece took place in Amsterdam on 26 June 1995, as part of the Holland Festival. Despite its extremely unusual nature, the piece has been given several performances, including one on 22 August 2003 as part of the Salzburg Festival to open the Hangar-7 venue, and the German premi\u00e8re on 17 June 2007 in Braunschweig as part of the Stadt der Wissenschaft 2007 Festival. The work has also been recorded by the Arditti Quartet.\nIn 1999 he was invited by Walter Fink to be the ninth composer featured in the annual Komponistenportr\u00e4t of the Rheingau Musik Festival.\nIn 1999, BBC producer Rodney Wilson asked Stockhausen to collaborate with Stephen and Timothy Quay on a film for the fourth series of Sound on Film International. Although Stockhausen's music had been used for films previously (most notably, parts of Hymnen in Nicolas Roeg's \"Walkabout\" in 1971), this was the first time he had been asked to provide music specially for the purpose. He adapted 21 minutes of material taken from his electronic music for \"Freitag aus Licht\", calling the result \"Zwei Paare\" (Two Couples), and the Brothers Quay created their animated film, which they titled \"In Absentia\", based only on their reactions to the music and the simple suggestion that a window might be an idea to use. When, at a preview screening, Stockhausen saw the film, which shows a madwoman writing letters from a bleak asylum cell, he was moved to tears. The Brothers Quay were astonished to learn that his mother had been \"imprisoned by the Nazis in an asylum, where she later died. ... This was a very moving moment for us as well, especially because we had made the film without knowing any of this\".\n2003\u20132007.\nAfter completing \"Licht\", Stockhausen embarked on a new cycle of compositions based on the hours of the day, \"Klang\" (\"Sound\"). Twenty-one of these pieces were completed before Stockhausen's death. The first four works from this cycle are First Hour: \"Himmelfahrt\" (Ascension), for organ or synthesizer, soprano and tenor (2004\u20132005); Second Hour: \"Freude\" (Joy) for two harps (2005); Third Hour: \"Nat\u00fcrliche Dauern\" (Natural Durations) for piano (2005\u20132006); and Fourth Hour: \"Himmels-T\u00fcr\" (Heaven's Door) for a percussionist and a little girl (2005). The Fifth Hour, \"Harmonien\" (Harmonies), is a solo in three versions for flute, bass clarinet, and trumpet (2006). The Sixth through Twelfth hours are chamber-music works based on the material from the Fifth Hour. The Thirteenth Hour, \"Cosmic Pulses\", is an electronic work made by superimposing 24 layers of sound, each having its own spatial motion, among eight loudspeakers placed around the concert hall. Hours 14 through 21 are solo pieces for bass voice, baritone voice, basset-horn, horn, tenor voice, soprano voice, soprano saxophone, and flute, respectively, each with electronic accompaniment of a different set of three layers from \"Cosmic Pulses\". The twenty-one completed pieces were first performed together as a cycle at the Festival MusikTriennale K\u00f6ln on 8\u20139 May 2010, in 176 individual concerts.\nTheories.\nIn the 1950s and early 1960s, Stockhausen published a series of articles that established his importance in the area of music theory. Although these include analyses of music by Mozart, Debussy, Bart\u00f3k, Stravinsky, Goeyvaerts, Boulez, Nono, Johannes Fritsch, Michael von Biel, and, especially, Webern, the items on compositional theory directly related to his own work are regarded as the most important generally. \"Indeed, the \"Texte\" come closer than anything else currently available to providing a general compositional theory for the postwar period\". His most celebrated article is \"...\u00a0wie die Zeit vergeht\u00a0...\" (\"...\u00a0How Time Passes\u00a0...\"), first published in the third volume of \"Die Reihe\" (1957). In it, he expounds a number of temporal conceptions underlying his instrumental compositions \"Zeitma\u00dfe\", \"Gruppen\", and \"Klavierst\u00fcck XI\". In particular, this article develops (1) a scale of twelve tempos analogous to the chromatic pitch scale, (2) a technique of building progressively smaller, integral subdivisions over a basic (fundamental) duration, analogous to the overtone series, (3) musical application of the concept of the partial field (time fields and field sizes) in both successive and simultaneous proportions, (4) methods of projecting large-scale form from a series of proportions, (5) the concept of \"statistical\" composition, (6) the concept of \"action duration\" and the associated \"variable form\", and (7) the notion of the \"directionless temporal field\" and with it, \"polyvalent form\".\nOther important articles from this period include \"Elektronische und Instrumentale Musik\" (\"Electronic and Instrumental Music\", 1958), \"Musik im Raum\" (\"Music in Space\", 1958), \"Musik und Graphik\" (\"Music and Graphics\", 1959), \"Momentform\" (1960), \"Die Einheit der musikalischen Zeit\" (\"The Unity of Musical Time\", 1961), and \"Erfindung und Entdeckung\" (\"Invention and Discovery\", 1961), the last summing up the ideas developed up to 1961. Taken together, these temporal theories suggested that the entire compositional structure could be conceived as \"timbre\": since \"the different experienced components such as colour, harmony and melody, meter and rhythm, dynamics, and form correspond to the different segmental ranges of this unified time\", the total musical result at any given compositional level is simply the \"spectrum\" of a more basic duration\u00a0\u2013 i.e., its \"timbre\", perceived as the overall effect of the overtone structure of that duration, now taken to include not only the \"rhythmic\" subdivisions of the duration but also their relative \"dynamic\" strength, \"envelope\", etc.\nCompositionally considered, this produced a change of focus from the individual tone to a whole complex of tones related to one another by virtue of their relation to a \"fundamental\"\u00a0\u2013 a change that was probably the most important compositional development of the latter part of the 1950s, not only for Stockhausen's music but for \"advanced\" music in general. Some of these ideas, considered from a purely theoretical point of view (divorced from their context as explanations of particular compositions) drew significant critical fire. For this reason, Stockhausen ceased publishing such articles for a number of years, as he felt that \"many useless polemics\" about these texts had arisen, and he preferred to concentrate his attention on composing.\nThrough the 1960s, although he taught and lectured publicly, Stockhausen published little of an analytical or theoretical nature. Only in 1970 did he again begin publishing theoretical articles, with \"Kriterien\", the abstract for his six seminar lectures for the Darmst\u00e4dter Ferienkurse. The seminars themselves, covering seven topics (\"Micro- and Macro-Continuum\", \"Collage and Metacollage\", \"Expansion of the Scale of Tempos\", \"Feedback\", \"Spectral Harmony\u00a0\u2013 Formant Modulation\", \"Expansion of Dynamics \u2013A Principle of \"Mikrophonie I\"\", and \"Space Music\u00a0\u2013 Spatial Forming and Notation\") were published only posthumously.\nHis collected writings were published in \"Texte zur Musik\", including his compositional theories and analyses on music as a general phenomenon.\nReception.\nMusical influence.\nStockhausen has been described as \"one of the great visionaries of 20th-century music\". His two early \"Electronic Studies\" (especially the second) had a powerful influence on the subsequent development of electronic music in the 1950s and 1960s, particularly in the work of the Italian Franco Evangelisti and the Poles Andrzej Dobrowolski and W\u0142odzimierz Koto\u0144ski. The influence of his \"Kontra-Punkte\", \"Zeitma\u00dfe\" and \"Gruppen\" may be seen in the work of many composers, including Igor Stravinsky's \"Threni\" (1957\u201358) and \"Movements\" for piano and orchestra (1958\u201359) and other works up to the \"Variations: Aldous Huxley in Memoriam\" (1963\u201364), whose rhythms \"are likely to have been inspired, at least in part, by certain passages from Stockhausen's \"Gruppen\"\". Though music of Stockhausen's generation may seem an unlikely influence, Stravinsky said in a 1957 conversation: I have all around me the spectacle of composers who, after their generation has had its decade of influence and fashion, seal themselves off from further development and from the next generation (as I say this, exceptions come to mind, Krenek, for instance). Of course, it requires greater effort to learn from one's juniors, and their manners are not invariably good. But when you are seventy-five and your generation has overlapped with four younger ones, it behooves you not to decide in advance \"how far composers can go\", but to try to discover whatever new thing it is makes the new generation new.\nAmongst British composers, Sir Harrison Birtwistle readily acknowledges the influence of Stockhausen's \"Zeitma\u00dfe\" (especially on his two wind quintets, \"Refrains and Choruses\" and \"Five Distances\") and \"Gruppen\" on his work more generally. Brian Ferneyhough says that, although the \"technical and speculative innovations\" of \"Klavierst\u00fccke I\u2013IV\", \"Kreuzspiel\" and \"Kontra-Punkte\" escaped him on first encounter, they nevertheless produced a \"sharp emotion, the result of a beneficial shock engendered by their boldness\" and provided \"an important source of motivation (rather than of imitation) for my own investigations\". While still in school, he became fascinated upon hearing the British premi\u00e8re of \"Gruppen\", and listened many times to the recording of this performance, while trying to penetrate its secrets\u00a0\u2013 how it always seemed to be about to explode, but managed nevertheless to escape unscathed in its core\u00a0\u2013 but scarcely managed to grasp it. Retrospectively, it is clear that from this confusion was born my interest for the formal questions which remain until today. Although it eventually evolved in a direction of its own, Ferneyhough's 1967 wind sextet, \"Prometheus\", began as a wind quintet with cor anglais, stemming directly from an encounter with Stockhausen's \"Zeitma\u00dfe\". With respect to Stockhausen's later work, he said, I have never subscribed (whatever the inevitable personal distance) to the thesis according to which the many transformations of vocabulary characterizing Stockhausen's development are the obvious sign of his inability to carry out the early vision of strict order that he had in his youth. On the contrary, it seems to me that the constant reconsideration of his premises has led to the maintenance of a remarkably tough thread of historical consciousness which will become clearer with time. ... I doubt that there has been a single composer of the intervening generation who, even if for a short time, did not see the world of music differently thanks to the work of Stockhausen. In a short essay describing Stockhausen's influence on his own work, Richard Barrett concludes that \"Stockhausen remains the composer whose next work I look forward most to hearing, apart from myself of course\" and names as works that have had particular impact on his musical thinking \"Mantra\", \"Gruppen\", \"Carr\u00e9\", \"Klavierst\u00fcck X\", \"Inori\", and \"Jubil\u00e4um\".\nFrench composer and conductor Pierre Boulez once declared, \"Stockhausen is the greatest living composer, and the only one whom I recognize as my peer\". Boulez also acknowledged the influence of performing Stockhausen's \"Zeitma\u00dfe\" on his subsequent development as a conductor. Another French composer, Jean-Claude \u00c9loy, regards Stockhausen as the most important composer of the second half of the 20th century, and cites virtually \"all his catalog of works\" as \"a powerful discoveration [\"sic\"], and a true revelation\".\nDutch composer Louis Andriessen acknowledged the influence of Stockhausen's \"Momente\" in his pivotal work \"Contra tempus\" of 1968. German composer Wolfgang Rihm, who studied with Stockhausen, was influenced by \"Momente\", \"Hymnen\", and \"Inori\".\nAt the Cologne ISCM Festival in 1960, the Danish composer Per N\u00f8rg\u00e5rd heard Stockhausen's \"Kontakte\" as well as pieces by Kagel, Boulez, and Berio. He was profoundly affected by what he heard and his music suddenly changed into \"a far more discontinuous and disjunct style, involving elements of strict organization in all parameters, some degree of aleatoricism and controlled improvisation, together with an interest in collage from other musics\".\nJazz musicians such as Miles Davis, Charles Mingus, Herbie Hancock, Yusef Lateef, and Anthony Braxton cite Stockhausen as an influence.\nStockhausen was influential within pop and rock music as well. Frank Zappa acknowledges Stockhausen in the liner notes of \"Freak Out!\", his 1966 debut with The Mothers of Invention. On the back of The Who's second LP released in the US, \"Happy Jack\", their primary composer and guitarist Pete Townshend, is said to have \"an interest in Stockhausen\". Rick Wright and Roger Waters of Pink Floyd also acknowledge Stockhausen as an influence. San Francisco psychedelic groups Jefferson Airplane and the Grateful Dead are said to have done the same; Stockhausen said that the Grateful Dead were \"well orientated toward new music\". Founding members of Cologne-based experimental band Can, Irmin Schmidt and Holger Czukay, both studied with Stockhausen at the Cologne Courses for New Music. German electronic pioneers Kraftwerk also say they studied with Stockhausen, and Icelandic vocalist Bj\u00f6rk has acknowledged Stockhausen's influence.\nWider cultural renown.\nStockhausen, along with John Cage, is one of the few avant-garde composers to have succeeded in penetrating the popular consciousness. The Beatles included his face on the cover of \"Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band\". In particular, \"A Day in the Life\" (1967) and \"Revolution 9\" (1968) were influenced by Stockhausen's electronic music. Stockhausen's name, and the perceived strangeness and supposed unlistenability of his music, was even a punchline in cartoons, as documented on a page on the official Stockhausen website (http://). Perhaps the most caustic remark about Stockhausen was attributed to Sir Thomas Beecham. Asked, \"Have you heard any Stockhausen?\" he is alleged to have replied, \"No, but I believe I have trodden in some\".\nStockhausen's fame is also reflected in works of literature. For example, he is mentioned in Philip K. Dick's 1974 novel \"Flow My Tears, the Policeman Said\", and in Thomas Pynchon's 1966 novel \"The Crying of Lot 49\". The Pynchon novel features \"The Scope\", a bar with \"a strict electronic music policy\". Protagonist Oedipa Maas asks \"a hip graybeard\" about a \"sudden chorus of whoops and yibbles\" coming out of \"a kind of jukebox.\" He replies, \"That's by Stockhausen ... the early crowd tends to dig your Radio Cologne sound. Later on we really swing\".\nThe French writer Michel Butor acknowledges that Stockhausen's music \"taught me a lot\", mentioning in particular the electronic works \"Gesang der J\u00fcnglinge\" and \"Hymnen\".\nLater in his life, Stockhausen was portrayed by at least one journalist, John O'Mahony of the \"Guardian\" newspaper, as an eccentric, for example being alleged to live an effectively polygamous lifestyle with two women, to whom O'Mahony referred as his \"wives\", while at the same time stating he was not married to either of them. In the same article, O'Mahony says Stockhausen said he was born on a planet orbiting the star Sirius. In the German newspaper \"Die Zeit\", Stockhausen stated that he was educated at Sirius (see Sirius star system below).\nIn 1995, BBC Radio 3 sent Stockhausen a package of recordings from contemporary techno and ambient music artists Aphex Twin, Richie Hawtin (Plastikman), Scanner and Daniel Pemberton, and asked him for his opinion on the music. In August of that year, Radio 3 reporter Dick Witts interviewed Stockhausen about these pieces for a broadcast in October, called \"The Technocrats\" and asked what advice he would give these young musicians. Stockhausen made suggestions to each and they were then invited to respond. All but Plastikman obliged.\nCritical reception.\nRobin Maconie finds that, \"Compared to the work of his contemporaries, Stockhausen's music has a depth and rational integrity that is quite outstanding... His researches, initially guided by Meyer-Eppler, have a coherence unlike any other composer then or since\". Maconie also compares Stockhausen to Beethoven: \"If a genius is someone whose ideas survive all attempts at explanation, then by that definition Stockhausen is the nearest thing to Beethoven this century has produced. Reason? His music lasts\", and \"As Stravinsky said, one never thinks of Beethoven as a superb orchestrator because the quality of invention transcends mere craftsmanship. It is the same with Stockhausen: the intensity of imagination gives rise to musical impressions of an elemental and seemingly unfathomable beauty, arising from necessity rather than conscious design\".\nChristopher Ballantine, comparing the categories of experimental and avant-garde music, concludes that Perhaps more than any other contemporary composer, Stockhausen exists at the point where the dialectic between experimental and avant-garde music becomes manifest; it is in him, more obviously than anywhere else, that these diverse approaches converge. This alone would seem to suggest his remarkable significance.\nIgor Stravinsky expressed great, but not uncritical, enthusiasm for Stockhausen's music in the conversation books with Robert Craft, and for years organised private listening sessions with friends in his home where he played tapes of Stockhausen's latest works. In an interview published in March 1968, however, he says of an unidentified person, I have been listening all week to the piano music of a composer now greatly esteemed for his ability to stay an hour or so ahead of his time, but I find the alternation of note-clumps and silences of which it consists more monotonous than the foursquares of the dullest eighteenth-century music. The following October, a report in \"Sovetskaia Muzyka\" translated this sentence (and a few others from the same article) into Russian, substituting for the conjunction \"but\" the phrase \"Ia imeiu v vidu Karlkheintsa Shtokkhauzena\" (\"I am referring to Karlheinz Stockhausen\"). When this translation was quoted in Druskin's Stravinsky biography, the field was widened to \"all\" of Stockhausen's compositions and Druskin adds for good measure, \"indeed, works he calls unnecessary, useless and uninteresting\", again quoting from the same \"Sovetskaia Muzyka\" article, even though it had made plain that the characterization was of American \"university composers\".\nControversy.\nThroughout his career, Stockhausen excited controversy. Thomas Ulrich writes that Stockhausen's music displays high expectations about \"shaping and transforming the world, about the truth of life and of reality, about the creative departure into a future determined by spirit\", so that his work \"like no other in the history of new music, has a polarizing effect, arouses passion, and provokes drastic opposition, even hatred\". In reply to a question during an interview on the Bavarian Radio on 4 September 1960, reprinted as a foreword to his first collection of writings, Stockhausen said: &lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;I have often been reproached\u00a0\u2013 especially recently\u00a0\u2013 for being too candid, and through this making not a few enemies for myself\u00a0\u2013 being undiplomatic. ... It must be admitted: I am not gifted as an esotericist, not as a mystic or a hermit, and not as a diplomat; it corresponds that my love of my fellow humans expresses itself in candour ... I hope my enemies will not on this account destroy me; I also hope my enemies find forms of retort that I can find richly fanciful, witty, pertinent, instructive\u00a0\u2013 that grant me respect through a noble and truly humane form of enmity.\nAfter the student revolts in 1968, musical life in Germany became highly politicized, and Stockhausen found himself a target for criticism, especially from the leftist camp who wanted music \"in the service of the class struggle\". Among those critics were his former students Konrad Boehmer and Cornelius Cardew, who denounced his former teacher as a \"servant of capitalism\". Some critics held that Stockhausen was too elitist, while others complained he was too mystical.\nScandal at the \"Fresco\" premiere.\nAs reported in the German magazine \"Der Spiegel\", the premi\u00e8re (and only performance to date) on 15 November 1969 of Stockhausen's work \"Fresco\" for four orchestral groups (playing in four different locations) was the scene of a scandal. The rehearsals were already marked by objections from the orchestral musicians questioning such directions as \"glissandos no faster than one octave per minute\" and others phoning the artists' union to clarify whether they really had to perform the Stockhausen work as part of the orchestra. In the backstage warm-up room at the premiere a hand-lettered sign could be seen saying: \"We're playing, otherwise we would be fired\". During the premi\u00e8re the parts on some music stands suddenly were replaced by placards reading things like \"Stockhausen-Zoo. Please don't feed\", that someone had planted. Some musicians, fed up with the monkeyshines, left after an hour, though the performance was planned for four to five hours. Stockhausen fans protested, while Stockhausen foes were needling the musicians asking: \"How can you possibly participate in such crap?\" (\"Wie k\u00f6nnt ihr blo\u00df so eine Schei\u00dfe machen!\"). At one point someone managed to switch off the stand lights, leaving the musicians in the dark. After 260 minutes the performance ended with no-one participating any longer.\nSirius star system.\nIn an obituary in the German newspaper \"Die Zeit\", Karlheinz Stockhausen was quoted as having said: \"I was educated at Sirius and want to return to there, although I am still living in K\u00fcrten near Cologne.\" On hearing about this, conductor Michael Gielen stated: \"When he said he knew what was happening at Sirius, I turned away from him in horror. I haven't listened to a note since.\" He called Stockhausen's statements \"hubris\" and \"nonsense\", while at the same time defending his own belief in astrology: \"Why should these large celestial bodies exist if they do not stand for something? I cannot imagine that there is anything senseless in the universe. There is much we do not understand\".\n11 September attacks.\nIn a press conference in Hamburg on 16 September 2001, Stockhausen was asked by a journalist whether the characters in \"Licht\" were for him \"merely some figures out of a common cultural history\" or rather \"material appearances\". Stockhausen replied, \"I pray daily to Michael, but not to Lucifer. I have renounced him. But he is very much present, like in New York recently.\" The same journalist then asked how the events of 11 September had affected him, and how he viewed reports of the attack in connection with the harmony of humanity represented in \"Hymnen\". He answered:Well, what happened there is, of course\u00a0\u2013 now all of you must adjust your brains\u00a0\u2013 the biggest work of art there has ever been. The fact that spirits achieve with one act something which we in music could never dream of, that people practise ten years madly, fanatically for a concert. And then die. [Hesitantly.] And that is the greatest work of art that exists for the whole Cosmos. Just imagine what happened there. There are people who are so concentrated on this single performance, and then five thousand people are driven to Resurrection. In one moment. I couldn't do that. Compared to that, we are nothing, as composers. [...] It is a crime, you know of course, because the people did not agree to it. They did not come to the \"concert\". That is obvious. And nobody had told them: \"You could be killed in the process.\"\nAs a result of the reaction to the press report of Stockhausen's comments, a four-day festival of his work in Hamburg was cancelled. In addition, his pianist daughter announced to the press that she would no longer appear under the name \"Stockhausen\". In a subsequent message, he stated that the press had published \"false, defamatory reports\" about his comments, and said:\nAt the press conference in Hamburg, I was asked if Michael, Eve and Lucifer were historical figures of the past and I answered that they exist now, for example Lucifer in New York. In my work, I have defined Lucifer as the cosmic spirit of rebellion, of anarchy. He uses his high degree of intelligence to destroy creation. He does not know love. After further questions about the events in America, I said that such a plan appeared to be Lucifer's greatest work of art. Of course I used the designation \"work of art\" to mean the work of destruction personified in Lucifer. In the context of my other comments this was unequivocal.\nHonours.\nAmongst the numerous honours and distinctions that were bestowed upon Stockhausen are:\nReferences.\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

His novels \"The Sky Road\" and \"The Night Sessions\" won the BSFA Award. MacLeod's novels have been nominated for the Arthur C. Clarke, Hugo, Nebula, Locus, and Campbell Memorial awards for best novel on multiple occasions. In 2024 MacLeod was one of the Guests of Honour at the 82nd World Science Fiction Convention in Glasgow.\nA techno-utopianist, MacLeod makes frequent use of libertarian socialist themes in his work; he is a three-time winner of the libertarian Prometheus Award. He sits on the advisory board of the Edinburgh Science Festival. \nBiography.\nMacLeod was born in Stornoway, Scotland, in 1954. He graduated from University of Glasgow with a degree in zoology in 1976, and he worked as a computer programmer and wrote a master's thesis on biomechanics. He was a Trotskyist activist during the 1970s and early 1980s. MacLeod is opposed to Scottish independence.\nPersonal life.\nMarried with two children, MacLeod lived in South Queensferry near Edinburgh, before moving to Gourock (on the Firth of Clyde) in June 2017. His wife died in August 2024.\nWriting.\nMacLeod belongs to a group of British science fiction writers who specialise in hard science fiction and space opera. His contemporaries include Neal Asher, Stephen Baxter, Iain M. Banks, Peter F. Hamilton, Paul J. McAuley, Alastair Reynolds, Adam Roberts, Charles Stross, Richard K. Morgan, and Liz Williams.\nMacLeod's science fiction novels often explore socialist, communist, and anarchist political ideas, especially Trotskyism and anarcho-capitalism (or extreme economic libertarianism). Technical themes encompass singularities, divergent human cultural evolution, and post-human cyborg-resurrection. MacLeod's general outlook can be best described as techno-utopian socialist, though unlike a majority of techno-utopians, he has expressed great scepticism over the possibility and especially the desirability of strong AI.\nMacLeod is known for frequent in-jokes and puns on the intersection between socialist ideologies and computer programming, as well as other fields. For example, his chapter titles such as \"Trusted Third Parties\" or \"Revolutionary Platform\" usually have double (or multiple) meanings. A fictional future programmers union is called \"Information Workers of the World Wide Web\", or the \"Webblies\", a reference to the real Industrial Workers of the World union, who are nicknamed the \"Wobblies\". The Webblies concept formed a central part of the novel \"For the Win\" by Cory Doctorow, and MacLeod is acknowledged as coining the term. Doctorow and Charles Stross also used one of MacLeod's references to the singularity\u2014as \"the rapture for nerds\"\u2014as the title for their collaborative novel \"Rapture of the Nerds\" (although MacLeod denies coining the phrase). There are also many references to or puns on zoology and palaeontology. For example, in the novel \"The Stone Canal\", the title of the book and many of its described places are named after anatomical features of marine invertebrates such as starfish.\nBooks about MacLeod.\nThe Science Fiction Foundation have published an analysis of MacLeod's work titled \"The True Knowledge Of Ken MacLeod\", edited by Andrew M. Butler and Farah Mendlesohn. In addition to critical essays, it contains material by MacLeod himself, including his introduction to the German edition of Iain M. Banks' novel \"Consider Phlebas\".\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "17270", "revid": "28481209", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=17270", "title": "Kanem\u2013Bornu Empire", "text": "Empire around Lake Chad, Africa, c. 700\u20131902\nThe Kanem\u2013Bornu Empire was an empire based around Lake Chad that once ruled areas which are now part of Nigeria, Niger, Cameroon, Libya, Algeria, Sudan, and Chad. The empire was sustained by the prosperous trans-Saharan trade and was one of the oldest and longest-lived empires in African history.\nThe early history of the Kanem\u2013Bornu Empire is poorly known. The empire is believed to have been founded around the year 700, though later and earlier dates have also been proposed. The Duguwa dynasty ruled the empire from their capital Njimi in the Kanem region (in modern-day Chad) and used the ruling title \"mai\". In the 11th century, the empire converted to Islam and the Duguwa were replaced with the Sayfawa dynasty. The Kanem-based empire was brought to its zenith by the 13th-century \"mai\" Dunama II Dibalemi. The empire exerted considerable control over Saharan trade routes and exported salt, ivory, slaves, and animal products. The salt industry was particularly prosperous, with the empire able to provide salt across the surrounding region.\nEconomic factors and conflict with the Bilala people caused the empire to lose Kanem in the 14th century. \"Mai\" Umar I Idrismi re-centered the empire in the Bornu region (in modern-day Nigeria), formerly a tributary state. A century of political instability followed, until \"mai\" Ali I Gaji founded Ngazargamu as a new permanent capital. Although Kanem was later recovered by \"mai\" Idris III Katagarmabe, scholars sometimes divide the Kanem\u2013Bornu Empire into an earlier \"Kanem Empire\" and later \"Bornu Empire\". The Bornu-based empire was brought to the peak of its power and influence under \"mai\" Idris IV Alooma in the late 16th century. Although Kanem\u2013Bornu remained powerful for long thereafter, the empire began a slow but steady decline in the 17th century due to changing economic patterns and environmental conditions, and conflicts with various neighbors.\nThe empire nearly fell during the Fula jihads in the early 19th century, which saw the center of power in the region shift west to the Sokoto Caliphate. In the aftermath of the jihads, the Sayfawa dynasty was supplanted by the al-Kanemi dynasty, who ruled with the title \"shehu\" (sheikh). In 1893, Kanem\u2013Bornu was conquered by the Sudanese warlord Rabih az-Zubayr, who transformed the empire into a brutal military dictatorship. Subsequent civil unrest was exploited by France and Britain. Although the al-Kanemi dynasty was restored in 1900, they governed under colonial suzerainty. The empire's territories were incorporated into the French, British, and German colonial empires in 1902. Remnants of the Kanem\u2013Bornu regime survive today in the form of the non-sovereign Borno and Dikwa emirates, two traditional states in Borno State, Nigeria.\nNomenclature.\nThe name \"Kanem\u2013Bornu Empire\" (or \"Kanem\u2013Borno Empire\") is a historiographical name used to cover the entire history of the state ruled by the Duguwa, Sayfawa, and al-Kanemi dynasties. \"Kanem\u2013Bornu\" was not a native or contemporary name used by the empire. The name is an amalgamation of the two main central regions of the empire over the course of its history: Kanem in modern-day Chad and Bornu (or Borno) in modern-day Nigeria. Since the empire rarely exerted direct control over both regions and its center was always based in only one of them, the name is somewhat anachronistic. Modern scholars sometime use the loss of Kanem and re-centering of the empire in Bornu in the 14th century as the dividing point between an early \"Kanem Empire\" and later \"Bornu Empire\".\n\"Kanem\" was the native name of the original core territory of the empire. The name might derive from the word \"anem\", which still carries the meaning \"south\" in the Teda and Kanuri languages. From the 9th to 11th centuries, foreign Arabic sources identify the state as the \"kingdom of the Zagh\u0101wa\" and as \"K\u0101nem\". The name \"Bornu\" or \"Borno\" only appears in sources from the 14th century onwards, connected to the new core territory west of Lake Chad, and eventually came to function as the native name for the entire state. Of the two spellings, \"Borno\" is more correct since it more accurately reflects how the name is pronounced in the Kanuri language. The spelling \"Bornu\" remains common in historical treatments but is sometimes regarded as a colonial spelling. When European colonial powers encountered the state in the 19th century, they referred to it as the Empire of Borno (\"Empire du Bornou\" in French).\nReferring to Kanem\u2013Bornu as an empire has its root in 19th and 20th-century eurocentric historiography and serves to stress the longevity and importance of the state. The Historian R\u00e9mi Dewi\u00e8re has suggested that the state should instead be called a sultanate (e.g. \"Kanem Sultanate\", \"Borno Sultanate\") to \"decolonize the history of Islamic Africa\". \nMedieval European maps sometimes feature a kingdom in Kanem\u2013Bornu's general location referred to as \"Organa\" or the \"Regnum Organa\" (Kingdom of Organa), which has traditionally been identified with Kanem\u2013Bornu.' Modern scholars generally treat \"Organa\" as unidentified,' with Kanem\u2013Bornu,' Ife,' and Ghana' considered potential identifications. The name \"Organa\" and its association with Western-style heraldic symbols (often a palm tree) is indicative of medieval Europe knowing next to nothing about sub-Saharan Africa.'\nAlternative names to \"Kanem\u2013Bornu Empire\" sometimes used by modern scholars include \"Sayfawa Empire\" (after the longest-lived ruling dynasty), and \"Kanuri Empire\" or \"Kanembu Empire\" (after dominant ethnic groups).\nHistory.\nMedieval period (c. 700\u20131472).\nOrigin and early history (c. 700\u20131000).\nThe early history of Kanem is poorly known and subject to debate. The empire is believed to have originated in the lands between Lake Chad and the Bahr el Ghazal River, with a core territory in the region of Kanem (northeast of Lake Chad). Lake Chad was positioned along key trade routes, ideally situated between Egypt and Sudan in the east, various West African states in the west, and the Sahara Desert in the north.\nHumans lived in the inner Chad Basin at least as far back as the 6th millennium BCE. The region is known to have acquired iron-smelting technology by the 5th century BCE and experienced increased agricultural activity around that time as well as the formation of permanent villages. By the 5th century CE, the people in Kanem had acquired the camel, either from North Africa or the Nile Valley. The appearance of the camel is believed to have facilitated the rich trans-Saharan trade, though archaeological evidence of this trade in pre-Islamic times is next to non-existent. Control of this trade led to the rise of stratified societies which eventually coalesced into kingdoms. One scholar, Dierk Lange, has proposed that Kanem's establishment was connected to refugees from the fall of the Neo-Assyrian Empire in the 7th century BCE, though this hypothesis has been criticised for lack of evidence and has found no acceptance among other researchers.\nThe process of state formation in Kanem is in large part unknown. The history of the Kanem Empire may go back as far as the 8th century and perhaps even earlier. The empire's foundation is typically dated to c. 700, though some place it as late as c. 900 or as early as c. 600. The earliest known written record of Kanem comes from the Arab geographer Al-Ya'qubi in 872. The empire's first capital was probably Njimi, east of Lake Chad, and its rulers assumed the title \"mai\". The site of Njimi has never been satisfactorily located, despite attempts to find it since the mid-19th century. Although only limited surveys of the original core of the empire have been conducted, the capital may have been built of impermanent materials. Some later Arab sources suggest that it was a \"city of tents\" in its original incarnation. Archaeological evidence from Koro Toro suggests that the region surrounding Kanem saw a considerable development of iron production between c. 500 and c. 1000, the formative centuries of Kanem.\nThe empire was probably founded by the Zaghawa people, pastoralists from the Ennedi Plateau, but grew to encompass several other ethnic groups, such as the Toubou people in the north. The empire consisted of various groups, including nomadic pastoralists, agriculturalists, and people accustomed to iron-working and horsemanship. The different groups eventually gave rise to the Kanembu people, who speak the Nilo-Saharan Kanembu language. The early empire grew wealthy and powerful through the export of slaves in exchange for horses, and the raiding of its neighbors.\nThe early Kanem Empire was ruled by the Duguwa dynasty, an aristocratic group who may have chosen \"mai\"s among themselves. Arab sources connect the Duguwa to the Zaghawa. It has also been suggested that they were Kanembu. The modern-day Haddad people in Chad may also have some historical connection to the Duguwa dynasty. Later legend, reflecting a desire to connect Kanem to the greater Islamic world, claimed that the Duguwa were descendants of migrants from the Arabian peninsula, who intermarried with the indigenous people around Lake Chad. Later tradition identifies \"mai\" Susam as the first ruler of the empire. The Duguwa dynasty gets its name from the empire's third ruler, Dugu (or Duku).\nThe political history of the Kanem\u2013Bornu Empire is largely reconstructed through the \"girgam\", the empire's royal chronicle. The \"girgam\" was preserved through oral tradition before transcriptions by European scholars in the mid-19th century. The \"girgam\" is not entirely reliable since it was preserved orally, incorporates some Biblical figures in its early sections, and contains some contradictions between different versions. There is however a large degree of agreement across different versions of the \"girgam\" as to the names of rulers and the lengths of their reigns.\nConversion to Islam (c. 1000\u20131380).\nIslam reached modern-day Chad already in the time of the Umayyad Caliphate (661\u2013750), when Arab raiders reached Fezzan and the Tibesti Mountains. The religion was probably introduced to Kanem from the north by either the Toubou people or trans-Saharan traders. Islam was probably an important influence within the empire from as early as the mid-8th or 9th century. Portions of the population may have early on converted to Ibadi Islam, as happened in Gao to the northwest. The early rulers of Kanem approached Islam carefully since they perceived the religion to contain some dangerous ideas, such as the equality of all believers before God. In traditional local religions, the ruler was often accorded superhuman powers and unlimited authority.\nThe first Muslim ruler of Kanem was the 11th-century \"mai\" Hu (or Hawwa), who may have been a woman. Hu's successor, Selema I, may have been overthrown in the second half of the 11th century by \"mai\" Hummay, who established the new Sayfawa dynasty. Hu and Selema may have been Ibadi Muslim, whereas Hummay's dynasty was Sunni Muslim. The Sayfawa were Kanembu in origin but claimed descent from the Yemeni noble Sayf ibn D\u012b Yazan, a well-known legendary hero in the medieval Islamic world. Sayf and Susam were identified as the same figure in later Kanem\u2013Bornu tradition. Other African dynasties of this time sometimes made similar claims to Arab origin as a source of prestige. \nLater tradition credited the conversion of the Sayfawa dynasty to a scholar named Muhammad bin Mani, from whom many later Kanemi and Bornuan scholars and religious officials claimed descent. Following the conversion to Islam by the rulers, conversions also increased among the general populace. Since Islam did not permit the enslavement of Muslims, it was not in the interest of the \"mai\"s to force conversion beyond certain limits, so as to continue to facilitate the need for slaves in local and trans-Saharan markets. The trans-Saharan trade sustained the empire, which was able to levy taxes and duties on trade goods. Through the trade passing through the empire, Kanem had access to most of the technology and knowledge of its time and could flourish and expand.\nInformation from the \"Akhb\u0101r al-zam\u0101n\", written between the late 10th to 11th century, states that Kanem by then was already a \"vast and large\" kingdom that was partly on the Nile and at war with Nubians. Kanem transitioned into a true empire through expansion to the Kaouar oases in the 11th century. Several archaeological sites have been identified in the oases, remains of former settlements, though they are yet to be excavated. It is believed that the northernmost settlements catered to travelers whereas the southern oasis settlements were focused on the salt trade. Through control of the trade routes to the north, the Kanem Empire exported ivory, slaves, and animal products. Foreign products, including weapons, books, beads, and cloth, were imported into the empire. In the 11th century, regulated taxation of the farmers around the capital at Njimi started to replace the previous patterns of nomad raiding and extortion.\nIncreasing Islamisation of Kanem is evident from the 11th century onwards and Kanem had developed into a literate society by the 12th century, when the scribes of the empire are recorded to have developed an original script style, the \"barn\u0101w\u012b\". In the 13th century, a ruler of Kanem is recorded to have gone on Hajj to Mecca. Shortly afterwards, the 13th-century \"mai\" Dunama II Dibalemi is recorded to have \"opened\" the \"mune\", an important religious artefact of unclear nature. Dunama II brought Kanem to the zenith of its power. He commanded a cavalry of 40,000 horsemen and extended his rule as far as the Fezzan. Wars against the Sao, southwest of Lake Chad, were justified in the name of a \"jihad\", and captives were sold as slaves in exchange for further horses from North Africa. Pilgrimages to Mecca became a common occurrence, so much so that a hostel for pilgrims and students from Kanem was founded in Cairo. In 1257, the \"mai\" sent a giraffe as a gift to Muhammad I al-Mustansir of the Hafsid dynasty in Ifriqiya.\nEra of Instability (c. 1380\u20131472).\nIn the 13th century, the \"mai\"s came into conflict with the Bilala people, who lived within the empire. The Bilala leaders may have been a cadet branch of the Sayfawa dynasty. Conflict may have been motivated by the increased Islamisation alienating the more traditionalist Bilala. Kanem was at the same time becoming overstretched, suffering from pastures becoming overgrazed and dried out, lacking the natural resources required for a state of its size, and having become too dependent on the personal authority of the \"mai\". The Medieval Warm Period also contributed to the drying up of Lake Chad, the heart of the empire. The empire began to be plagued by increasing internal and external conflict, as well as wars of succession.\nThe 14th century saw the beginning of the so-called \"Era of Instability\", plagued by both internal and external conflict. In the 14th century, around the year 1380, the Bilala were able to oust the Sayfawa from power in Kanem and capture Njimi. Imperial control of the lands east of Lake Chad was terminated, and the Bilala would rule there independently until the 16th century. The rulers of the Bilala declared themselves sultans, established a proper aristocracy, and posed a serious political alternative to the Sayfawa in the region surrounding Lake Chad. Mamluk chancery manuals from the time accord the Bilala the same diplomatic status as the Sayfawa.\n\"Mai\" Umar I Idrismi relocated across Lake Chad to Bornu in the west, a former tributary territory established in the 13th century. The Sayfawa quickly regrouped in Bornu, re-establishing a powerful kingdom there, and the \"mai\"s continued to rule as they had in Kanem. Intermarriages between the Kanembu people and the local Sao may have given rise to the modern-day Kanuri people, who are often linked to the Kanem\u2013Bornu Empire. The empire continued to be plagued by political instability in the form of repeated civil wars between descendants of \"mai\" Dawud Nikalemi (\"Dawudids\") and \"mai\" Idris I Nikalemi (\"Idrisids\"). Between about 1390 and 1470, no less than 15 \"mai\"s occupied the throne, ruling in rapid succession. The civil wars impacted regions as far away from the imperial core as Hausaland and Darfur through economic upheaval and migrations of refugees.\nAfter the fall of Njimi, the empire lacked a permanent capital for about a century, with the court of the \"mai\" constantly moving from one site to another. Very little information survives on the movements and locations of the \"mai\"s in this period. Prior to the foundation of the permanent capital of Ngazargamu c. 1472, the \"mai\" had apparently resided at a site called Garu Kime for seven years and seven months. This site may correspond to modern-day Monguno.\nModern period (1472\u20131893).\nImperial apex (1472\u20131650).\nThe Idrisid \"mai\" Ali I Gaji emerged victorious from the civil wars of the 14th and 15th century. Adapting to the more urbanised society of Bornu, the empire became centered on a network of walled settlements that formed the core of its power. In c. 1472, Ali founded the empire's first substantial capital city, Ngazargamu, on the shores of the Yobe River. Ngazargamu served as a firm basis of political authority and was ideally positioned at the southern terminus of the trans-Saharan trade routes, and closer to emerging trade centers in Hausaland than previous capitals. The city became the focal point of the central Sudan region for the next three centuries. After the foundation of Ngazargamu, some of the \"mai\"s went so far as to call themselves caliphs. Indigenous practices and beliefs continued to persist even at this date, such as the \"mai\" customarily appearing behind a veil or screen. \nThe empire expanded in the 15th and 16th centuries. The \"mai\"s fought against various neighboring powers, such as the Hausa city-states and Kotoko principalities in the south and the Wandala along the Mandara Mountains. The most formidable enemy to arise in this period was the Songhai Empire in the west, which competed for influence over Hausaland and sometimes raided Bornuan territory. Kanem itself was reconquered by Ali I's son \"mai\" Idris III Katagarmabe in the early 1500s, though the center of the empire continued to remain in Bornu, probably because the area was more productive agriculturally and better suited to raise cattle. Idris sealed peace between the Sayfawa and Bilala through a diplomatic marriage and the Bilala were allowed to continue to govern Kanem as vassals. In the west, Idris III failed to conquer the Kingdom of Kano but was recognised as the kingdom's suzerain and was paid tribute. By the reign of Idris III's son \"mai\" Muhammad VI Aminami, the empire had fully regained its former prominence in the trans-Saharan trade. Through the political influence of Bornu, the Kanuri language spread over a wide area.' So-called Old Kanembu was also a prominent language, though reserved for Islamic scholarly studies.'\nThe empire experienced some decline in the 1550s and 1560s due to famine and revolts against imperial suzerainty. In the 1570s, the threat posed by the Songhai Empire led \"mai\" Idris IV Alooma to seek an alliance with the Ottoman Empire. Bornu had been in contact with the Ottomans since the Ottoman conquest of Tripoli (1551), and Ottoman mercenaries had been enlisted in various local conflicts. Prior to Alooma's reign, Ottoman firearms and tactical superiority had helped with conquests in the south and west of Bornu. Through diplomacy with Ottoman sultan Murad III, Alooma secured Turkish muskets, as well as military training by Turkish instructors for the Bornuan army. Alooma was an ambitious ruler, who led several military campaigns and brought the empire to the height of its power. Although the actual territorial expansion of the state under Alooma was relatively minor, the subjugation of internal non-Muslim groups contributed to consolidating the state and long-distance diplomacy encouraged trade and cultural development.\nBy the end of the 16th century, Bornu's sphere of influence extended from Hausaland to the Bahr el Ghazal River, and from south of Lake Chad to the Fezzan. The collapse of the Songhai Empire in 1591 and the decline of cities such as Timbuktu and Djenn\u00e9 made Bornu the new center of Islamic learning in central Africa, playing a crucial role in the local intellectual ecosystem. Alooma's reign was followed by a period of stabilisation in the early 17th century. Islam spread further into rural areas of the empire during this time and Sufism experienced a surge in popularity.\nDecline (1650\u20131807).\nThe empire began to experience slow economic decline as early as the 15th century because of the increase in trade via the Atlantic Ocean. In the 17th century, Bornu's control over the trans-Saharan trade was increasingly challenged. Ottoman officials in Tripolitania periodically attempted to increase their own influence over the trade, sometimes creating agreements with Bornu and sometimes attempting to establish their own monopoly. The empire also came into conflict with the Tuareg over control of the trans-Saharan trade routes. Under Tuareg pressure, the empire slowly lost the Kaouar oases and its control over the trade routes and was forced to establish defensive military outposts along its northern, western, and eastern borders.\nSeveral new neighboring states fought to increase their influence to the detriment of Bornu and imperial vassal states came under repeated attacks. In around 1630, The Wadai Sultanate drove the Bilala out of Kanem, forcing the empire to militarily intervene in order to secure the eastern side of Lake Chad. The Bilala were forced to flee east, re-establishing themselves around Lake Fitri. Bornu established new buffer states in the north and west to protect against the growing power of Kano and the Sultanate of Agadez. The imperial core was consolidated through the annexation of several frontier states, such as the Kotoko city-states. Despite military buildup, the empire abandoned certain military innovations. By the end of the 17th century, Bornuan armies had for instance ceased to use gunpowder weapons. Despite its declining power, the empire continued to be the main military power in the Chad Basin.\nThe Little Ice Age (16th\u201319th centuries) heavily impacted Lake Chad and the surrounding region, causing a drought while regions further south experienced increased fertility. Although Lake Chad reached its largest size since the 13th century, the lands surrounding the lake were rendered extremely dry, likely contributing to large-scale emigration of Bornuans. Trans-Saharan trade continued to be prosperous through the 17th century but new alternate trade roads were also established by powers such as the Hausa city-states and Wadai. Trade eventually decline to such a level that large empires could no longer be sustained, giving rise to smaller kingdoms and political chaos.\nTuareg invasions and a famine in the latter half of the 17th century quickened the decline of the empire. Imperial expansion and military power stagnated in the 18th century. In the early 18th century, \"mai\" Hamdan Dunamami repeatedly fought against the neighboring Mandara Kingdom. A few decades later, under \"mai\" Ali IV Kalirgima, the conflict with the Mandara Kingdom culminated in an 1781 invasion of Bornu and the defeat of the imperial army. \nFula jihads and the \"shehu\"s (1807\u20131893).\nIn the late 18th and early 19th century, a wave of Islamic revival swept through western and central Africa, partly motivated by competition between nomadic (largely Fulani) and settled populations for land. From 1804 onwards, the religious leader Usman dan Fodio began a series of military campaigns (the Fula jihads), at first against the various states in Hausaland. The campaigns resulted in Usman being named \"\u02beAm\u012br al-Mu\u02bemin\u012bn\" by his followers, and the establishment of the vast Sokoto Caliphate. The rise of the Sokoto Caliphate shifted the cultural, economic, and political center of the region to the west and abruptly ended the traditional pre-eminent position of the Kanem\u2013Bornu Empire. Due to internal strife, losses against Mandara, and perhaps a recent plague, Bornu was particularly vulnerable to attacks at the time. The \"jihad\" had reached the empire by 1807. The Fulani denounced the people of Bornu as inadequate Muslims and captured most of the western provinces of the empire.\nIn 1808, under \"mai\" Ahmad Alimi, the Fulani captured and destroyed Ngazargamu. Much of the imperial core had by that time fallen into the hands of the invaders. In the same year, the local Islamic scholar Muhammad al-Amin al-Kanemi was drawn into local conflicts with the Fulani in Bornu and managed to defeat some Fulani troops in the region of Ngala. Al-Kanemi's victory garnered him the attention of the new \"mai\" Dunama IX Lefiami, who summoned him to assist in the defense of the empire. Under al-Kanemi's leadership, the empire, despite its decline, proved strong enough to resist the Fulani invaders. Al-Kanemi received a large personal fiefdom, centered at Ngurno, and organised a large slave-heavy cavalry army, supported by Kanembu spearmen and Arab light cavalry. He also led a propaganda campaign against the Fulani jihadists, questioning what right they had to wage holy war against Bornu. The Fulani were driven away from the empire and \"mai\" Dunama was restored to power. Dunama briefly reoccupied what remained of Ngazargamu but soon abandoned the former capital in 1809 since it was too close to the Fulani frontier. To the ire of his people, Dunama retreated east but could not decide on a new site for a permanent capital, instead only spending a few months in any one given place.Court intrigue, partly related to the great power awarded to al-Kanemi, led to Dunama being deposed by his courtiers in 1811, replaced with \"mai\" Muhammad IX Ngileruma. Under Muhammad Ngileruma, a new imperial capital was established at Kafela, close to al-Kanemi's seat at Ngurno. Al-Kanemi supported Dunama's restoration in 1814 but then began to act more independently. Al-Kanemi became the \"de facto\" ruler of the empire and centralised power under himself. The \"mai\" was continued to serve as a nominal ruler for a few decades. In 1814, al-Kanemi assumed the style of \"shehu\" (sheikh) and established a new seat, Kukawa, which grew into one of the great metropolises of sub-Saharan Africa. In 1817, Dunama plotted to eliminate al-Kanemi but was himself killed and replaced with the young puppet \"mai\" Ibrahim IV Lefiami. At the death of al-Kanemi in 1837, he was succeeded as \"shehu\" by his son Umar Kura. Umar faced some resistance from both associates of his father and from the puppet \"mai\", but quickly took power. Ibrahim later tried to depose Umar through a civil war but was killed in 1846. Ibrahim was briefly succeeded by his son, \"mai\" Ali V Minargema, who was also defeated and killed in battle. The thousand-year office of \"mai\" came to an end and Umar and his successors assumed \"de jure\" power over the empire, though still with the title of \"shehu\". Kafela was destroyed and Kukawa became the empire's formal capital.Bornu under the \"shehu\"s was substantially weaker than the state had been a few centuries earlier. Much of its former western territory remained under the Sokoto Caliphate and the state was cut off from the trans-Saharan trade in the north. The economic basis of the state had been further weakened by European pressure to end the slave trade. An economic crisis in Europe had also caused alternate export goods, such as ivory and ostrich feathers, to lose their value. By the 1850s, the army the empire was able to muster numbered about 10,000 cavalry (500 armored) and a larger number of infantry. These numbers were a sharp decline from the army fielded by al-Kanemi mere decades prior, which numbered 30,000 cavalry and 9,000 spearmen.\nBornu became of interest to various European powers during the Scramble for Africa. In treaties and agreements in the 1890s, France and the United Kingdom worked to designate \"spheres of influence\" in Africa. During this time, French and British representatives attempted to sign treaties with the \"shehu\"s of Bornu to eventually justify claims to the entire Bornuan territory in future negotiations. The French were particularly interested since they sought to link their existing colonies in Senegal, Algeria, and Congo. In 1890, the Royal Niger Company attempted to sign a treaty with \"shehu\" Ashimi but their representatives were dismissed after spending two months in Kukawa. The \"shehu\" then hoisted the flag of the Ottoman Empire as a symbol of his non-recognition of British authority. Parfait-Louis Monteil eventually managed to secure diplomatic relations with Bornu on behalf of France in 1892. By the time the French attempted to make use of this relationship, Bornu had been captured by the Sudanese invader Rabih az-Zubayr.\nFall of Kanem\u2013Bornu (1893\u20131902).\nRabih az-Zubayr's empire (1893\u20131900).\nRabih az-Zubayr was a Sudanese adventurer and slave raider who entered Bornuan territory in 1892/1893. Rabih's forces captured Karnak Logone, the capital of a small sultanate on the southeastern border of Bornu proper, and ejected the local population. With the fortified Karnak Logone as a base, Rabih could harvest resources from the vicinity and advance to Amja, on the Bornu border. \"Shehu\" Ashimi sent an army led by the experienced general Momman Tahr against Rabih. Rabih defeated Tahr's army at the battle of Amja, and Tahr was captured and executed. In August 1893, a second battle took place at Lekarawa, near Ngala. Rabih decisively defeated a Bornu army led by \"shehu\" Ashimi and his nephew Kyari. Ashimi and a few other survivors fled across the Yobe River, abandoning Kukawa.\nRabih spent some time at Kukawa but settled on Dikwa as a capital, on account of its better communications and water supply. Rabih's takeover was opposed by the people of Bornu and most of the empire initially remained loyal to the al-Kanemi dynasty. A peasant revolt led by a man identified as \"mallam\" Gantur managed to defeat one of Rabih's commanders before being put down. Shortly after the fall of Kukawa, Kyari seized power as the new \"shehu\" and Ashimi was assassinated in the aftermath. Kyari faced Rabih in battle on the banks of the Yobe River in February/March 1894. Rabih again emerged victorious and Kiyari was captured and executed. Kiyari's brother Sanda Wuduroma made his way to southern Bornu, where he was proclaimed \"shehu\", but he was captured and executed after less than a month. Kukawa was plundered and burned, with its 120,000\u2013200,000 inhabitants killed, enslaved, or dispersed.\nThe death of Sanda Wuduroma left Rabih as the undisputed master of Bornu. The unprecedented conquest marked the first time the empire came under foreign domination. Geopolitically, Rabih largely behaved as his predecessors, working to maintain the borders of the empire and dominate the various lesser vassal states that surrounded the imperial core. His rule was however exceptionally brutal, marked by cruel punishments, heavy taxation, and an unprecedented concentration of power. Rabih established a military dictatorship under himself as emir and a tiny military council (the \"Zubat al-Kubar\"). Rabih's commanders transitioned into being the main holders of fiefs in the empire. Those provincial rulers and courtiers who submitted to Rabih's forces were allowed to retain their holdings, albeit under close supervision of military commanders stationed at Dikwa. When local rulers became difficult to deal with, they were executed. In most cases, Rabih attempted to find replacements within their immediate families. Despite his brutality, Rabih's rule was in some ways also fairer and less corrupt than the aristocratic rule of the \"shehu\"s that had preceded him. Although taxation was heavy, the tax rate was also fixed and taxes were collected only once a year. Most of the state income was spent on the army and defense; Rabih did establish a palace at Dikwa, but little money was otherwise spent on personal luxuries, in stark contrast to the \"shehu\"s.\nDomestically, Rabih's greatest focus was on tax collection and supplies. Although highly efficient, the tax system was extortionate on the people and taxes were so heavy and brutally collected that it inspired revolts and migrations out of the empire. Revolts were met with brutal punishments; an 1896 uprising in Nganzai led to the execution of over a hundred rebel leaders. Much of the money collected was spent on Rabih's palace and on the army. The plunder and mass displacement of people under Rabih, combined with the uncertainty created by the conquest, strongly impacted the Bornu economy, especially the agricultural sector. The state's formerly productive agricultural base was destroyed and Rabih was unable to revive it. Agriculture was further negatively affected by Rabih's army raiding villages for food, which fanned further unrest.\nRabih's conquest of Bornu was a threat to the colonial boundaries and spheres of influence envisioned in negotiations between the United Kingdom, France, and the German Empire. The British chose to recognise Rabih as a legitimate ruler of the empire, referring to him as the \"Sultan of Borno\". The French opted to deem Rabih illegitimate, since they could then justify conquests of parts of his empire. In 1899, Rabih had the French explorer Ferdinand de B\u00e9hagle killed and France responded by invading his empire. The French were easily able to recruit local allies in the war. Rabih was at first successful against the French under \u00c9mile Gentil, but was eventually defeated and killed at the battle of Kouss\u00e9ri (22 April 1900).\nAl-Kanemi restoration (1900\u20131902).\nThe death of Rabih created a power vacuum in the empire, paving the way for colonial occupation. Both the French and British worked to influence the struggles between the various claimants. By the time French forces came into contact with surviving princes of the al-Kanemi dynasty, the al-Kanemi forces had already regrouped under a recognised claimant, Sanda Kura, son of the \"shehu\" Ibrahim Kura.\nWhen the French reached Sanda Kura's forces, they agreed to recognise him as the new \"shehu\" and he was invested as such by his followers on 14 January 1900. After Rabih's death at Kouss\u00e9ri, Rabih's son Fadlallah collected his family and property at Dikwa and then retreated south with an army numbering 5,000, pursued by the French. Sanda Kura was installed as Bornu's new ruler at Dikwa. The French soon grew dissatisfied with Sanda Kura's governance. He was removed from office in July/August and deported to Congo in October. In his place at Dikwa, the French installed his more pliable brother Abubakar Garbai as \"shehu\".\nFrench and British colonialism brought an end to the Kanem\u2013Bornu Empire in 1902. Fadlallah tried to secure British support as ruler but his army was reached by French forces at Gujba on 23 August 1901 and Fadlallah was killed in the ensuing battle. Although left without a figurehead, British forces occupied much of Bornu in March 1902, put under the Northern Nigeria Protectorate. In 1902, Abubakar Garbai left Dikwa to become the figurehead \"shehu\" of \"British Borno\". The circumstances of this is unclear; British colonial sources claim that he was invited and accepted the invitation, whereas German colonial sources from the same time claim that he was kidnapped by British troops. Abubakar Garbai left Dikwa in the care of Sanda Mandarama, a brother of the former \"shehu\" Kiyari and the city was occupied by the French in April 1902 and incorporated into French Chad. Later in the same year, Dikwa was transferred to German control and became part of the German colony of Kamerun.\nLegacy and scholarship.\nSome of the people in the former empire, particularly the Toubou people, continued to resist colonisation, supported by the Ottoman Empire and the Senussi order. Resistance had largely died down by 1920, and the European colonies became firmly established. The division of the al-Kanemi dynasty under British and German rule has survived to the present in the Borno and Dikwa emirates, two traditional states in Nigeria.\nEuropean colonisation dismantled the political and economic organisation of the area around Lake Chad.' Bornu went on to suffer from certain political and economical marginalisation by all of the colonial empires in the region, increased by the former country being cut up between different colonial linguistic spheres (e.g. the Anglophone Nigeria and Francophone Chad).' In the 1950s, new Kanuri nationalist movements developed in Nigeria, mobilising against perceived Hausa domination in northern Nigeria and calling for restoring the territory of the late Kanem\u2013Bornu Empire. Nationalist and secessionist movements increased in prominence in the 1970s which was a factor in the 1976 creation of the new Borno State in Nigeria. Kanuri nationalist movements experienced another prominent period in the 1990s, when they expanded to also include the Kanembu people. Nationalist groups sometimes refer to a proposed state covering Bornu and Kanem as \"Kanowra\". In the early 21st century, continued marginalisation of the Bornu region, traceable back to colonisation and division of the former empire, led to the emergence of terrorist groups such as Boko Haram.\nThe first European history of the Kanem\u2013Bornu Empire was written by the 19th-century German traveler Heinrich Barth and published as part of his descriptions of journeys in the Sahel region (1858). Later travelers, such as Gustav Nachtigal, as well as colonial administrators, such as Richmond Palmer and Yves Urvoy, also wrote histories of Bornu, relying on Barth's work and on their own translations of sources. These 19th- and early 20th-century sources generally reflect racist and imperialist agendas of the contemporary colonial powers. Because Bornu was marginalised during colonisation, as well as after decolonisation, the Kanem\u2013Bornu Empire was long neglected in historiography. Colonial historiographies were for the most part focused on the central regions of respective colonies, and thus on powers such as Sokoto, Songhai, Mali, and Ghana. Modern scholarship on the Kanem\u2013Bornu Empire began to take shape in Nigeria in the 1960s and grew considerably in the 1970s. Kanem\u2013Bornu scholarship has also increased in Europe and the United States since the 1970s, relying on new archaeological discoveries and analyses of local Arabic-language sources, oral sources, and Ottoman documents.\nGovernment and military.\nSovereign and nobility.\nThe title of \"mai\" is variously equated to emperor or king. After the conversion to Islam, the rulers of Kanem began to be referred to as \"sultan\" and \"emir\" in both internal and external sources, alongside the traditional style of \"mai\". Any son of a \"mai\" was qualified to become the next \"mai\", which sometimes led to succession conflict and civil war. Persistent conflict and rival claims plagued much of the empire's history and virtually no \"mai\" was ever completely secure on the throne.\nAt some point after the conversion to Islam, perhaps in the reign of Dunama II Dibalemi in the 13th century, the empire transitioned to a feudal political system. Around this time there appeared a class of princes (\"maina\"), and a large system of titles was developed, including styles such as \"arjinoma\", \"yerima\", and \"tegoma\". Court titles such as \"musterema\" (chief eunuch) and \"ciroma\" (heir to the throne) also began to appear. Notable female figures include the \"gumsu\" (main wife of the \"mai\"), the \"mairatin\" (princesses), and the \"magram\" (official sister of the \"mai\").\nThe court of the \"mai\" was characterised by much formality and ceremony. The \"mai\" held audience with the court from the \"zanadir\", a wooden cage. Courtiers often wore overly large turbans and excessive shirts to match their physical appearance to their social status. After 1846, the \"shehu\"s adopted some elements of the preceding \"mai\"s. Their court was made more formal, though not to the same extent as that of the \"mai\"s (the \"zanadir\" was for instance not adopted). Some of the former imperial titles were applied to the \"shehu\"'s household; his senior wife became known as the \"ya gumsu\", and traditional noble titles such as \"musterema\" and \"yerima\" continued to be used.\nThe \"mai\", and later the \"shehu\", was assisted in government by a council of state, referred to as \"nokuna\" or \"majilis\". The council was typically composed of twelve royal, religious, and military notables (the exact officeholders could vary), though the precise governmental arrangement was flexible and subject to periodic change.\nFief administration.\nAdministration of fiefs in the Kanem\u2013Bornu Empire was handled through the \"chima\" system, first devised under the Sayfawa and later inherited by both the al-Kanemi dynasty and Rabih az-Zubayr. All land in the empire formally belonged to the sovereign. Fiefs were awarded by the \"mais\" and \"shehu\"s to any persons they wished, including courtiers (\"kogunawa\"), princes (\"abbawa\"), princesses (\"nanawa\"), and religious clerics (\"ulama\"). Fief-holders could live in the lands given to them, or live in the capital and subsist on the revenue generated. Frontier fiefs could be given to military commanders, especially those of the lower classes, serving to strengthen the borders and further integrating the imperial periphery with the center. Some fiefs became attached to certain offices over time and became hereditary. Most fiefs reverted back to the \"mai\" or \"shehu\" after the death of the holder; the ruler could then reassign it as they wished, either within or outside the former holder's family. Fiefs could also be revoked in the lifetime of a holder, or be sold to another person by the holder themself.\nThere were two classes of \"chima\" holders, \"chima gana\" (junior \"chima\") and \"chima kura\" (senior \"chima\"). \"Chima kura\"s were the formal owners of a fief and could own multiple territories throughout the empire. From the time of Ali I Gaji onwards, fief holders lived at the capital, while the individual fiefs were administered on their behalf by \"chima gana\"s. The only notable figure in the nobility to not reside in the capital itself was the \"galadima\", a high-ranking governor of the western provinces. As day-to-day overseers, the power of a \"chima gana\" within their territory was near unlimited, as long as taxes and tribute was paid to the central government, law and order was maintained, and armies were raised when demanded by the sovereign.\nThe number and size of the fiefs in the empire varied throughout its history. By 1893, the empire was divided into 524 fiefs, administered by 104 \"chima kura\". Fiefs could be composed of a single village or a whole district.\nMilitary and warfare.\nBy c. 1000, the army of the Kanem\u2013Bornu Empire had developed into a powerful force, strong enough to control the trade routes in the vicinity of the imperial core. Military campaigns outside the territory of the empire were for most of its history focused on raiding and establishing tributary relationships, rather than outright conquest. When troops were needed, they were raised through the \"chima\" fief system.\nThe empire relied on cavalry as the central part of the military, with the horses imported through trade with North Africa. At the time of Dunama II Dibalemi in the 13th century, the empire had a force of 40,000 cavalry. Under Idris IV Alooma in the 16th century, the army was modernised through the import of firearms, and the help of Ottoman mercenaries and military advisors. The use of cavalry was further expanded, camel corps were introduced for long-distance expeditions, fortified camps began to be used, and a fleet of ferries was created for logistics and river crossings. Firearms were also introduced but had ceased to be used by the end of the 17th century. The empire was still able to field 30,000 cavalry and 9,000 spearmen under Muhammad al-Kanemi in the Fula jihads, but its size had rapidly declined to about 10,000 cavalry by the 1850s.\nThe highest-ranking general and commander of the army bore the title \"kaigama\", and often came from a slave background. From the 15th to 19th century, the \"kaigama\" had their own impressive palace in Ngazargamu. The origin of the title \"kaigama\" is unclear. It appears to translate to \"master of Kaiga\", perhaps originally referring to a district southwest of Lake Chad. Great trust was placed in the ability of the \"kaigama\"; a battlefield defeat often resulted in the \"kaigama\" being replaced. Some \"kaigama\"s were influential and powerful enough to confront and depose a \"mai\".\nSociety.\nThe Kanem\u2013Bornu Empire's active contact with North Africa resulted not only in trade and diplomacy, but also garnered the empire some cosmopolitan influence and contacts. The empire had considerable influence in its overall region, with both Nguzargamu and the later Kukawa having been important centers in the Sudan region. At the height of the Sayfawa dynasty's rule, the safety provided by the state and the firm grasp it had on the trade routes led to a common saying that even \"a lone woman clad in gold might walk with none to fear but God\". Although imperial power gradually declined over the course of its last centuries, the empire continued to hold symbolic importance among its neighbors. In 1800, virtually all of Hausaland was still nominally tributaries of the empire and sent annual gifts to the \"mai\".\nDue to the advance of Islam and Kanurisation among the populace of the empire, Kanem and Bornu gradually developed from highly diverse realms in the Middle Ages to a relatively homogenous country by 1800, ruled by a powerful aristocracy. Sunni Maliki Islamic law was applied in the empire, supported by scholars trained in schools in North Africa, the Middle East, and (from at least the 15th century) within the empire itself. The peasant population of the empire was slower to convert to Islam than the aristocracy, but efforts from the Middle Ages onwards were made by religious teachers known as \"mallam\"s. The \"mallam\"s roamed rural areas of the empire and by 1800 there were many so-called \"mallam villages\", where educated men farmed and studied together, exempt from taxes.\nThe agriculture of the empire was probably similar to the agriculture of the region today. Crops were planted at the beginning of the rainy season (June\u2013October). The main crops were varities of guinea corn and millet. Other crops were also cultivated, such as maize, onion, rice, cucumber, peanuts, and calabash, but on a lesser scale. In the dry season, people lived off stored grain and other staple foods.\nRecords of women in the history of the Kanem\u2013Bornu Empire are rare. The limited source material that is known indicates that women were important and valued in diplomacy, long-distance correspondence, and military logistics. 17th-century sources from North Africa indicate that women from Bornu were active members of the population, sometimes on the international stage. Noblewomen from Bornu sometimes accompanied diplomatic missions and learnt different languages to communicate with women of other countries. During military campaigns, women could be put in charge of organising supplies.\nAs was the case for other states in the region, slavery was an important factor in the society and economy of the Kanem\u2013Bornu Empire. Slaves were collected through trade, tribute from other states, and through raids and war, mainly against non-Muslim neighbors. Slaves were variously sold through the trans-Saharan trade or kept locally. Local slaves were used in many different tasks, for instance in agricultural production. Whereas commoners worked their own lands and paid taxes, aristocrats acquired slaves to work for them. Slaves were also used for military purposes and the empire relied heavily on slaves for its cavalry armies.\nEconomy.\nRegional and long-distance trade of commodities formed the core of the economy of Kanem and Bornu. The empire produced salt, textile, and agricultural products which were sold through the trans-Saharan trade. The salt industry was particularly prosperous, producing perhaps 6500\u20139000 tons per year. The empire likely supplied salt across the entire surrounding region. Slaves were also an important export and the Kanem\u2013Bornu Empire participated actively in the trans-Saharan slave trade until the end of the 19th century. Slaves from Bornu are first recorded in the Mediterranean in the 16th century, when Bornu ambassadors sold them in exchange for Ottoman horses and firearms.\nLittle is known of what goods were imported by the Kanem\u2013Bornu Empire.' It is likely that traders imported books, paper, and textiles, since the empire is known to have established Islamic schools and certain rulers are recorded to have wore clothes made in Tunis.' Based on known historical patterns of trade between sub-Saharan Africa and North Africa, the empire is also likely to have imported horses, copper, and various manufactured products.\nThe main currencies historically used in the Kanem\u2013Bornu Empire were copper and coined silver, cowrie shells, and cotton strips. Cowrie shells were officially recognised as currency only in 1848, due to the economic power of the Sokoto Caliphate where they were also widespread as currency. This move made Bornu dependent on the Sokoto Caliphate's monetary system. In the last few centuries the empire also recognised some European currencies, with the Spanish dollar and later the Maria Theresa thaler at points serving as standard currencies. In the early 19th century, \"shehu\" Muhammad al-Kanemi and his son \"shehu\" Umar asked various British consuls in North Africa for coining machines so that they could establish their own currency, the \"Bornoan dirham\". This project was abandoned after the British declined their requests.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

After holding a series of propaganda posts, in 1948 he became the head of the propaganda department in Moldavia, serving under Leonid Brezhnev.

In this capacity, he became responsible for setting the agenda for the Politburo and drafting Central Committee decrees. By 1971 Chernenko became a full member of the Central Committee and later a full member of the Politburo in 1978.\nFollowing the death of Yuri Andropov, Chernenko was elected General Secretary of the party's Central Committee on 13 February 1984 and Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet on 11 April 1984. Despite assuming offices associated with the Soviet Union's highest authority, Chernenko's power was significantly undermined by his failing health and lack of support among the \"nomenklatura\" who viewed him as a transitional figurehead. Thus, he was compelled to rule the country as part of an unofficial triumvirate alongside Defense Minister Dmitry Ustinov and Foreign Minister Andrei Gromyko for most of his tenure. After leading the party for less than 13 months, Chernenko died on 10 March 1985 and was succeeded as General Secretary by Mikhail Gorbachev.\nEarly life and political career.\nOrigins.\nChernenko was born to a poor family in the Siberian village of Bolshaya Tes (now in Novosyolovsky District, Krasnoyarsk Krai) on 24 September 1911.\nChernenko joined the Komsomol (Communist Youth League) in 1929. By 1931 he became a full member of the ruling Communist Party. From 1930 to 1933, he served in the Soviet frontier guards on the Soviet\u2013Chinese border. After completing his military service, he returned to Krasnoyarsk as a propagandist. In 1933 he worked in the Propaganda Department of the Novosyolovsky District Party Committee. A few years later he was promoted to head of the same department in Uyarsk Raykom.\nChernenko steadily rose through the Party ranks, becoming the Director of the Krasnoyarsk House of Party Enlightenment before being named Deputy Head of the Agitprop Department of Krasnoyarsk's Territorial Committee in 1939. In the early 1940s, he began a close relationship with Fyodor Kulakov and was named Secretary of the Territorial Party Committee for Propaganda. By 1945 he acquired a diploma from a party training school in Moscow then later finished a correspondence course for schoolteachers in 1953.\nRise to the Soviet leadership.\nThe turning point in Chernenko's career was his assignment in 1948 to head the Communist Party's propaganda department in the Moldavian Soviet Socialist Republic. There, he met and won the confidence of Leonid Brezhnev, the first secretary of the Moldavian branch of the Communist Party from 1950 to 1952 and future leader of the Soviet Union. Chernenko followed Brezhnev in 1956 to fill a similar propaganda post in the CPSU Central Committee in Moscow. In 1960 after Brezhnev was named chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet (i.e. the titular head of state of the Soviet Union), Chernenko became his chief of staff.\nIn 1965, Chernenko was nominated head of the General Department of the Central Committee, and given the mandate to set the Politburo agenda as well as prepare drafts of numerous Central Committee decrees and resolutions. He also monitored telephone wiretaps and covert listening devices in various offices of the top Party members. Another of his jobs was to sign hundreds of Party documents daily, a job he did for the next 20 years. Even after he became General Secretary of the Party, he continued to sign papers referring to the General Department (when he could no longer physically sign documents, a facsimile was used instead).\nIn 1971, Chernenko was promoted to full membership in the Central Committee: overseeing Party work over the Letter Bureau, dealing with correspondence. In 1976 he was elected secretary of the Letter Bureau. He became Candidate in 1977, and in 1978 a full member of the Politburo, second to the General Secretary in the Party hierarchy.\nDuring Brezhnev's final years, Chernenko became fully immersed in ideological Party work: heading Soviet delegations abroad, accompanying Brezhnev to important meetings and conferences, and working as a member of the commission that revised the Soviet Constitution in 1977. In 1979, he took part in the Vienna arms limitation talks.\nAfter Brezhnev's death in November 1982, there was speculation that the position of General Secretary would fall to Chernenko, but he was unable to rally enough support for his candidacy. Ultimately, KGB chief Yuri Andropov eventually won the position.\nLeader of the Soviet Union (1984\u20131985).\nYuri Andropov died on 9 February 1984 at age 69 in Moscow Central Clinical Hospital of kidney failure. Chernenko was then elected to replace Andropov even though the latter stated he wanted Mikhail Gorbachev to succeed him. Chernenko was also terminally ill himself.\nAt the time of his ascent to the country's top post, Chernenko was primarily viewed as a transitional leader who could give the Politburo's \"Old Guard\" time to choose an acceptable candidate from the next generation of Soviet leadership. In the interim, Chernenko's authority was severely limited by his lack of support within the party and his deteriorating health which led him to miss meetings with increasing frequency. At Andropov's funeral, he could barely read the eulogy. Therefore, he was forced to govern the country as part of a triumvirate alongside Defense Minister Dmitriy Ustinov and Foreign Minister Andrei Gromyko. According to historian Vladislav M. Zubok, \"Ustinov and Gromyko retained a virtual monopoly in [Soviet] military and foreign affairs\" as a result of Chernenko's feeble hold on power.\nChernenko represented a return to the policies of the late Brezhnev era. Nevertheless, he supported a greater role for the labour unions, and reform in education and propaganda. The one major personnel change Chernenko made was the dismissal of the Chief of the General Staff, Marshal Nikolai Ogarkov. Ogarkov was subsequently replaced by Marshal Sergey Akhromeyev.\nIn foreign policy, he negotiated a trade deal with China. Despite calls for renewed d\u00e9tente, Chernenko did little to prevent the escalation of the Cold War with the United States. For example, in 1984 the Soviet Union prevented a visit to West Germany by East German leader Erich Honecker. However, in late autumn of 1984, the U.S. and the Soviet Union did agree to resume arms control talks in early 1985. In November 1984 Chernenko met with Britain's Labour Party leader, Neil Kinnock.\nIn 1980 the United States led an international boycott of the Summer Olympics held in Moscow in protest at the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. The following 1984 Summer Olympics were due to be held in Los Angeles, California. On 8 May 1984, under Chernenko's leadership, the USSR announced its intention not to participate in the Games, claiming \"security concerns and chauvinistic sentiments and an anti-Soviet hysteria being whipped up in the United States\". The boycott was joined by 14 Eastern Bloc satellites and allies, including Cuba (but not Romania). The action was widely seen as revenge for the U.S.-led boycott of the Moscow Games. The boycotting countries organised their own \"Friendship Games\" in the summer of 1984.\nBefore his death, Chernenko signed preliminary documents stating that on 9 May 1985, on the day of the 40th Victory Day Parade, the city of Volgograd would be renamed to Stalingrad. In his letter to Stalin's daughter Svetlana Alliluyeva, he wrote about \"the upcoming restoration of justice in relation to the memory and heritage of I.V. Stalin\", which presumably referred to Stalin's political rehabilitation.\nHealth problems, death and legacy.\nChernenko started smoking at the age of nine, and he was always known to be a heavy smoker as an adult. Long before his election as general secretary, he had developed emphysema and right-sided heart failure. In 1983, he had been absent from his duties for three months due to bronchitis, pleurisy and pneumonia. Historian John Lewis Gaddis described him as \"an enfeebled geriatric so zombie-like as to be beyond assessing intelligence reports, alarming or not\" when he succeeded Andropov in 1984.\nIn early 1984, Chernenko was hospitalized for over a month but kept working by sending the Politburo notes and letters. During the summer, his doctors sent him to Kislovodsk for the mineral spas, but on the day of his arrival at the resort Chernenko's health deteriorated, and he contracted pneumonia. Chernenko did not return to the Kremlin until later in 1984. He awarded Orders to cosmonauts and writers in his office, but was unable to walk through the corridors and was driven in a wheelchair. By the end of 1984, Chernenko could hardly leave the Central Clinical Hospital, a heavily guarded facility in west Moscow, and the Politburo was affixing a facsimile of his signature to all letters, as Chernenko had done with Andropov's when he was dying. Chernenko's illness was first acknowledged publicly on 22 February 1985 by the First Secretary of the Moscow City Committee, Viktor Grishin, during a televised election rally in Kuibyshev Borough of northeast Moscow. Two days later, in a televised scene that shocked the nation, Grishin dragged the terminally ill Chernenko from his hospital bed to a ballot box to vote. On 28 February 1985, Chernenko appeared once more on television to receive parliamentary credentials and read out a brief statement on his electoral victory: \"the election campaign is over and now it is time to carry out the tasks set for us by the voters and the Communists who have spoken out\".\nEmphysema and the associated lung and heart damage worsened significantly for Chernenko in the last three weeks of February 1985. According to the Chief Kremlin doctor, Yevgeniy Chazov, Chernenko had also developed both chronic hepatitis and cirrhosis of the liver. On 10 March at 15:00, Chernenko fell into a coma and died later that evening at 19:20, at age 73. An autopsy revealed the cause of death to be a combination of chronic emphysema, an enlarged and damaged heart, congestive heart failure and liver cirrhosis. A three-day period of mourning across the country was announced. India, Brazil, Iraq, Syria and Nicaragua all declared three days of mourning; Pakistan North Korea and Guinea-Bissau declared two days of mourning; East Germany, Yugoslavia and Czechoslovakia declared one day of mourning.\nChernenko became the third Soviet leader to die in two and a half years. Upon being informed in the middle of the night of his death, U.S. President Ronald Reagan is reported to have remarked, \"How am I supposed to get anyplace with the Russians if they keep dying on me?\"\nChernenko was honored with a state funeral and is buried in the Kremlin Wall Necropolis, in one of the twelve individual tombs located between the Lenin Mausoleum and the Kremlin wall. He is the last person to have been interred there.\nThe impact of Chernenko\u2014or the lack thereof\u2014was evident in the way in which his death was reported in the Soviet press. Soviet newspapers carried stories about Chernenko's death and Gorbachev's selection on the same day. The papers had the same format: page 1 reported the party Central Committee session on 11 March that elected Mikhail Gorbachev and printed the new leader's biography and a large photograph of him; page 2 announced the demise of Chernenko and printed his obituary.\nAfter the death of a Soviet leader it was customary for his successors to open his safe. When Gorbachev had Chernenko's safe opened, it was found to contain a small folder of personal papers and several large bundles of money; more money was found in his desk. It is not known where he had obtained the money or what he intended to use it for.\nPersonal life.\nChernenko had a son with his first wife, Faina Vassilyevna Chernenko, named Albert. With his second wife, Anna Dmitrevna Lyubimova, who married him in 1944, he had two daughters, Yelena and Vera, and a son, Vladimir. In 2015 archival documents were published, according to which Chernenko had many more wives, and many more children with them; this circumstance, perhaps, was the reason for the slowing of Chernenko's career growth in the 1940s.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "17273", "revid": "1311334939", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=17273", "title": "Komondor", "text": "The Komondor (), also known as the Hungarian sheepdog, is a large, white-coloured Hungarian breed of livestock guardian dog with a long, corded coat.\nSometimes referred to as 'mop dogs' due to their appearance, the Komondors are a long-established dog breed commonly employed to guard livestock and other property. The Komondor was brought to Europe by the Cumans and the oldest known mention of it is in a Hungarian codex from 1544. The Komondor breed has been declared one of Hungary\u2019s national treasures, to be preserved and protected from modification.\nEtymology and history.\nKomondors were brought to Hungary by Cumans, the Turkic speaking, nomadic people who settled in Hungary during the 12th and 13th century. The name Komondor derives from \"*Koman-dor\", meaning \"Cuman dog\". The breed descends from Tibetan dogs and came from Asia with the Cumans, whose homeland might have been near the Yellow River. In the late 10th century, Mongols began to expand their territories at the expense of the Cumans, forcing them to move westwards. Fleeing from the Mongols, they reached the borders of Hungary in the 12th century. Cumans were granted asylum and settled in Hungary in 1239 under K\u00f6ten Khan. Komondor remains have been found in Cuman gravesites.\nThe name \"quman-dur\" means \"belonging to the Cumans\" or \"the dog of the Cumans\", thus distinguishing it from a similar Hungarian sheepdog breed which later merged with the Komondor. The name Komondor is found for the first time written in 1544 in the \"History of King Astiagis\" by P\u00e9ter K\u00e1konyi, in Early Modern Hungarian. Later, in 1673, John Amos Comenius mentions the Komondor in one of his works. \nToday, the Komondor is a fairly common breed in Hungary, its country of origin. Many Komondors were killed during World War II and local stories say that this was because when the Germans (and then the Russians) invaded, they had to kill the dog before they could capture a farm or house that it guarded.\nThe Komondor is related to the South Russian Ovcharka, the Puli and, by extension, the Pumi, the Mudi, the Polish Lowland Sheepdog, the Schapendoes, the Bearded collie, and the Old English sheepdog. In 1947, the Komondor was used to acquire fresh blood in the rare South Russian Ovcharka. In the 1970s, another Komondor cross was made. It is also believed to be related to the Briard, the Catalonian Sheepdog, the C\u00e3o da Serra de Aires, the Pyrenean Shepherd and the Bergamasco shepherd, but the Bergamasco has flocks unlike the Komondor.\nThe two Hungarian breeds of livestock guardian dogs have evolved independently. This is because the Komondor was developed by a group of people who called it the Kuman-dor, the dog of the Cumans, and the Kuvasz was bred by a different people - the Magyars. For much of Hungary's early history, these two peoples lived in separate areas in Hungary, spoke different languages and so did not mix. As a result, their dogs have little, if any at all, admixture.\nDescription.\nThe Komondor is a large breed of dog\u2014many are over tall. The body is covered with a heavy, matted, corded coat. They have robust bodies, strongly muscled with long legs and a short back. The tail is carried with a slight curl. The body when seen sideways, forms a prone rectangle. The length of body is slightly longer than the height at withers. The Komondor has a broad head with the muzzle slightly shorter than half of the length of the head with an even and complete scissor bite. Nose and lips are always black.\nThe minimum height of female Komondors is at the withers, with an average height of . The minimum height of male Komondors is with an average height of . No upper height limit is given. Komondor females on average weigh between and Komondor males weigh on average between .\nAppearance.\nThe Komondor's coat is a long, thick, and strikingly corded white coat, about 20 \u2013 27\u00a0cm long (the heaviest amount of fur in the canine world), which resembles dreadlocks or a mop. The puppy coat is soft and fluffy. However, the coat is wavy and tends to curl as the puppy matures. A fully mature coat is formed naturally from the soft undercoat and the coarser outer coat combining to form tassels or cords and will take about two years to form. Some help is needed in separating the cords so the dog does not turn into one large matted mess. The length of the cords increases with time as the coat grows. Moulting is minimal with this breed, contrary to what one might think (once cords are fully formed). The only substantial shedding occurs as a puppy before the dreadlocks fully form. The Komondor is born with only a white coat, unlike the similar-looking Puli, which can be white, black, or sometimes grayish. However, a working Komondor's coat may be discolored by the elements and may appear off-white if not washed regularly. Traditionally, the coat protects the Komondor from possible wolves' bites as the bites would not penetrate the thick coat. The coat of the Komondor takes about two and a half days to dry after a bath.\nTemperament.\nThe Komondor is built for livestock guarding. Its temperament is like that of most livestock guarding dogs; it is calm and steady when things are normal, but, in case of trouble, the dog will fearlessly defend its charges. It was bred to think and act independently and make decisions on its own.\nThe Komondor is affectionate with its family, and gentle with the children and friends of the family. Although wary of strangers, they can accept them when it is clear that no harm is imminent, being instinctively very protective of its family, home, and possessions. \nThe Komondor is very good with other family pets, often very protective over them, but is intolerant to trespassing animals and is not a good dog for an apartment. The dog is vigilant and will rest in the daytime, keeping an eye on its surroundings, but at night is constantly moving, patrolling the place, moving up and down around its whole territory. The dogs will usually knock down intruders and keep them down until its owner arrives. \nHungarian Komondor breeders used to say that an intruder may be allowed to enter the property guarded by a Komondor, but he will not be allowed to leave or escape.\nUses.\nThe breed has a natural guardian instinct and an inherent ability to guard livestock. An athletic dog, the Komondor is fast and powerful and will leap at a predator to drive it off or knock it down. It can be used successfully to guard sheep against wolves or bears. It is a big, strong dog breed, armored with a thick coat. The coat provides protection against wild animals, weather and vegetation. The coat looks similar to that of a sheep so it can easily blend into a flock and camouflage itself giving it an advantage when predators such as wolves attack. The Komondor is one breed of livestock guardian dog which has seen a vast increase in use as a guardian of sheep and goats in the United States to protect against predators such as coyotes, cougars, bears, and other predators.\nTraining.\nDue to the Komondor's size, power, speed and temperament, a lack of obedience training can result in danger to others. Komondors generally take well to training if started early (ideally between 4\u20138 months). A Komondor can become obstinate when bored, so it is imperative that training sessions be upbeat and happy. Praise is a must, as are consistent and humane corrections. Once a Komondor gets away with unfriendly or hostile behavior, it will always think such behavior is appropriate. Therefore, consistent corrections even with a young puppy are necessary to ensure a well-adjusted adult. Socialization is also extremely important. The Komondor should be exposed to new situations, people and other dogs while still a puppy. Because it is a natural guard dog, a Komondor that is not properly socialized may react in an excessively aggressive manner when confronted with a new situation or person.\nBreed-specific legislation requires some breeds to be muzzled in public places. Romania is the only country that requires Komondors to be muzzled.\nIn popular culture.\nThe cover of Beck\u2019s 1996 album \"Odelay\" is a photo of a Komondor jumping over a hurdle, taken by canine photographer Joan Ludwig (1914\u20132004) for the July 1977 issue of the American Kennel Club's \"Gazette\".\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "17274", "revid": "46807820", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=17274", "title": "Keeshond", "text": "Dog breed\nThe Keeshond ( , plur. Keeshonden) is a medium-sized dog with a plush, two-layer coat of silver and black fur with a ruff and a curled tail. Their closest relatives are the German spitzes such as the \"Gro\u00dfspitz\" (Large Spitz), \"Mittelspitz\" (Medium Spitz), \"Kleinspitz\" (Miniature Spitz), \"Zwergspitz\" (Dwarf-Spitz) or Pomeranian.\nThe Keeshond was previously known as the Dutch Barge Dog, as it was frequently seen on barges traveling the canals and rivers of the Netherlands. The Keeshond was the symbol of the Patriot faction in the Netherlands during political unrest in the years immediately preceding the French Revolution.\nIn the late 19th century, the breed was developed in England from imports obtained in both the Netherlands and Germany. In 1930, the Keeshond was first registered with the American Kennel Club.\nDescription.\nAppearance.\nA member of the spitz group of dogs, the Keeshond in American Kennel Club (AKC) standard is to tall and \u00a0\u00b1\u00a0 in the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Cynologique Internationale (FCI) standard and weighs to . Sturdily built, they have a typical spitz appearance. Neither coarse nor refined, they have a wedge-shaped head, medium-length muzzle with a definite stop, small pointed ears, and an expressive face. The tail is tightly curled and, in profile, should be carried such that it is indistinguishable from the compact body of the dog.\nCoat.\nLike most spitz-type dogs, the Keeshond has a dense double coat, with a thick ruff around the neck. Typically, the males of this breed will have a thicker, more pronounced ruff than the females. The body should be abundantly covered with long, straight, harsh hair standing well out from a thick, downy undercoat. The hair on the legs should be smooth and short, except for a feathering on the front legs and \"trousers\" on the hind legs. The hair on the tail should be profuse, forming a rich plume. The head, including muzzle, skull, and ears, should be covered with smooth, soft, short hair\u2014velvety in texture on the ears. The coat must not part down the back.\nCoat care requires line brushing on a fairly regular basis. The Keeshond typically 'blows' its undercoat once a year for males, twice a year for females. During this time, the loss of coat is excessive and their guard hairs will lie flat to their back. It usually takes two weeks for the 'blow' to complete, in order for new undercoat to begin growing back in. A Keeshond should never be shaved, as their undercoat provides a natural barrier against heat and cold. Keeping their coat in good condition will allow efficient insulation in both hot and cold weather.\nColor.\nThe color should be a mixture of grey and black and some white as well. The undercoat should be very pale grey or cream (not tawny). The hair of the outer coat is black tipped, the length of the black tips producing the characteristic shading of color. The color may vary from light to dark, but any pronounced deviation from the grey color is not permissible. The plume of the tail should be very light grey when curled on back and the tip of the tail should be black. Legs and feet should be cream. Ears should be very dark\u2014almost black.\nShoulder line markings (light grey) should be well defined. The color of the ruff and \"trousers\" is generally lighter than that of the body. \"Spectacles\" and shadings, as later described, are characteristic of the breed and must be present to some degree. There should be no pronounced white markings.\nAccording to the American Kennel Club breed standard, the legs and feet are to be cream; feet that are totally black or white are severe faults. Black markings more than halfway down the foreleg, except for pencilling, are faulted.\nThe other important marking is the \"spectacles\", a delicate dark line running from the outer corner of each eye toward the lower corner of each ear, which, coupled with markings forming short eyebrows, is necessary for the distinct expressive look of the breed. All markings should be clear, not muddled or broken. Absence of the spectacles is considered a serious fault. The eyes should be dark brown, almond-shaped with black eye rims.\nEars should be small, dark, triangular, and erect.\nTemperament.\nKeeshonden tend to be very playful, with quick reflexes and strong jumping ability. They are thoughtful, eager to please and very quick learners, which means they are also quick to learn things their humans did not intend to teach them. However, Keeshonden make excellent agility and obedience dogs. In fact, so amenable to proper training is this bright, sturdy dog that they have been successfully trained to serve as guide dogs for the blind; only their lack of size has prevented them from being more widely used in this role.\nThey love children and are excellent family dogs, preferring to be close to their humans whenever possible. They generally get along with other dogs as well and will enjoy a good chase around the yard. Keeshonden are very intuitive and empathetic and are often used as comfort dogs. Most notably, at least one Keeshond, Tikva, was at Ground Zero following the September 11 attacks to help comfort the rescue workers. The breed has a tendency to become especially clingy towards their owners, more so than most other breeds. If their owner is out, or in another room behind a closed door, they may sit, waiting for their owner to reappear, even if there are other people nearby. Many have been referred to as their \"owner's shadow\", or \"velcro dogs\".\nThey are known by their loud, distinctive bark. Throughout the centuries, the Keeshond has been very popular as a watch dog on barges on canals in the Netherlands and middle Europe. This trait is evident to this day, and they are alert dogs that warn their owners of any new visitors. Although loud and alert, Keeshonden are not aggressive towards visitors. They generally welcome visitors affectionately once their family has accepted them. Unfortunately, barking may become a problem if not properly handled. Keeshonden that are kept in a yard, and not allowed to be with their humans, are unhappy and often become nuisance barkers. \nThe Keeshond is very bright in work and obedience. The Keeshond ranks 18th in Stanley Coren's \"The Intelligence of Dogs\", being of excellent working/obedience intelligence. This intelligence makes a Keeshond a good choice for the dog owner who is willing to help a dog learn the right lessons, but also entails added responsibility.\nHealth.\nKeeshonden are generally a very healthy breed. Though congenital health issues are not common, the conditions which have been known to sometimes occur in Keeshonden are hip dysplasia, luxating patellas (trick knee), epilepsy, Cushing's disease, diabetes, primary hyperparathyroidism, and hypothyroidism. Von Willebrand's disease has been known in Keeshonden but is very rare. An accurate https:// (or PHPT) has recently been developed at Cornell University. As with any breed, it is important when buying a puppy to make sure that both parents have been tested and certified free from inherited problems. Test results may be obtained from the breeder, and directly from the Orthopaedic Foundation For Animals site.\nA 2024 UK study found a life expectancy 12.3 years based on a sample of 55 deaths for the breed compared to an average of 12.7 for purebreeds and 12 for crossbreeds.\nHistory.\nThe Keeshond was named after the 18th-century Dutch Patriot, Cornelis (Kees) de Gyselaer (spelled 'Gijzelaar' in Modern Dutch), leader of the rebellion against the House of Orange. The dog became the rebels' symbol; and, when the House of Orange returned to power, this breed almost disappeared. The word 'keeshond' is a compound word: 'Kees' is a nickname for Cornelius (de Gyselaer), and 'hond' is the Dutch word for dog. In the Netherlands, \"keeshond\" is the term for German Spitzes that encompass them all from the toy or dwarf (Pomeranian) to the Wolfspitz (Keeshond). The sole difference among the German Spitzes is their coloring and size guidelines. There are debates over the origin of the breed; many English references point to the Keeshond as we know it originating in the Netherlands. On the other hand, according to the FCI, the breed is cited as being part of the German Spitz family, originating in Germany along with the Pomeranian (toy or dwarf German Spitz) and American Eskimo dog (small or standard German Spitz).\nThe first standard for \"Wolfspitz\" was posted at the Dog Show of 1880 in Berlin. The Club for German Spitzes was founded in 1899. The German standard was revised in 1901 to specify the characteristic color that we know today, \"silver grey tipped with black\". In the late 19th century the \"Overweight Pomeranian\", a white German Spitz and most likely a Standard German Spitz, was shown in the British Kennel Club. The \"Overweight Pomeranian\" was no longer recognized by the British Kennel Club in 1915. In the 1920s, Baroness van Hardenbroeck took an interest in the breed and began to build it up again. The Nederlandse Keeshond Club was formed in 1924. The Dutch Barge Dog Club of England was formed in 1925 by Mrs. Wingfield-Digby and accepted into the British Kennel Club in 1926, when the breed and the club were renamed to Keeshond.\nCarl Hinderer is credited with bringing his Schloss Adelsburg Kennel, which he founded in 1922 in Germany, with him to America in 1923. His German Champion Wolfspitz followed him two by two in 1926. At that time, less than ten years after World War I, Germany was not regarded fondly in England and America; and the Wolfspitz/Keeshond was not recognized by the AKC. Consequently, Hinderer had to register each puppy born in the U.S. with his club in Germany. Despite this, he joined the Maryland KC and attended local shows.\nHinderer regularly wrote to the AKC, including the New York headquarters, to promote the Wolfspitz. While going through New York on his way to Germany in 1930, Hinderer visited the AKC offices and presented \"Wachter\", his Germany champion, to AKC President, Dr. DeMond, who promptly agreed to start the recognition process, with some caveats including changing the name to Keeshond, and asked Hinderer to bring back all the relevant data from Germany. Hinderer also translated the German standard to English for the AKC. The Keeshond was accepted for AKC registration in 1930.\nDespite intense lobbying the FCI would not accept the Keeshond as a separate breed since it viewed the Wolfspitz and Keeshond as identical. In 1997, the German Spitz Club updated its standard so that the typically smaller Keeshond preferred in America and other English-speaking countries could be included. This greatly expanded the gene pool and unified the standard internationally for the first time. Now bred for many generations as a companion dog, the Keeshond easily becomes a loving family member.\nAs a result of the breed's history and friendly disposition, Keeshonden are sometimes referred to as \"The Smiling Dutchman\".\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

While many other rifles of its era use an integral box magazine loaded by a charger or stripper clip, the magazine of the Krag\u2013J\u00f8rgensen is integral with the receiver (the part of the rifle that houses the operating parts), featuring an opening on the right hand side with a hinged cover. Instead of a charger, single cartridges are inserted through the side opening, and are pushed up, around, and into the action by a spring follower. Later, similar to a charger, a claw type clip would be made for the Krag that allowed the magazine to be loaded all at once, also known as the Krag \"speedloader magazine\".\nThe design presents both advantages and disadvantages compared with a top-loading \"box\" magazine. Normal loading was one cartridge at a time, and this could be done more easily with a Krag than a rifle with a \"box\" magazine. In fact, several cartridges can be dumped into the opened magazine of a Krag at once with no need for careful placement, and when shutting the magazine-door the cartridges are forced to line up correctly inside the magazine. The design was also easy to \"top off\", and unlike most top-loading magazines, the Krag\u2013J\u00f8rgensen's magazine could be topped up without opening the rifle's bolt. The Krag\u2013J\u00f8rgensen is a popular rifle among collectors, and is valued by shooters for its smooth action.\nEarly development.\nThe 1880s were the decade where smokeless powder came into general use, and the calibre of various service rifles diminished as new small-bore, high-velocity cartridges using smokeless propellant were developed. Many nations adopted repeating bolt-action rifles using such cartridges during this decade.\nEven though Norway had adopted the repeating Jarmann rifle in 1884, it was soon clear that it was at best an interim weapon. Ole Krag, captain in the Norwegian Army and director of Kongsberg V\u00e5penfabrikk (the government weapons factory), therefore continued the development of small arms, as he had since at least 1866. Not satisfied with the tubular magazine of the Jarmann rifle and his earlier Krag\u2013Petersson rifle (adopted by the Royal Norwegian Navy in 1876), he enlisted the help of master gunsmith Erik J\u00f8rgensen. Together, they developed the \"capsule\" magazine. The principal feature of the capsule magazine was that instead of being a straight box protruding below the stock of the rifle, it wrapped around the bolt action. Early models contained ten rounds and were fitted to modified versions of the Jarmann\u2014though they could be adapted to any bolt-action rifle.\nIn 1886, Denmark was on the verge of adopting a new rifle for its armed forces. One of the early prototypes of the new rifle was sent to Denmark. The feedback given by the Danes was vital in the further development of the weapon. The test performed in Denmark revealed the need to lighten the rifle, as well as the possible benefits of a completely new action. Krag and J\u00f8rgensen therefore decided to convert the magazine into what they referred to as a \"half-capsule\", containing only five rounds of ammunition instead of the previous ten. They also, over the next several months, combined what they considered the best ideas from other gunsmiths with a number of their own ideas to design a distinct bolt action for their rifle. The long extractor, situated on top of the bolt, was inspired by the Jarmann mechanism, while the use of curved surfaces for cocking and ejecting the spent round was probably inspired by the designs from Mauser. For a time after the weapon was adopted by Denmark they experimented with dual frontal locking lugs, but decided against it on grounds of cost and weight. The ammunition of the day did not need dual frontal locking lugs, and the bolt already had three lugs\u2014one in front, one just in front of the bolt handle, and the bolt handle itself\u2014which were considered more than strong enough.\nThe rifle had a feature known as a magazine cut-off. This is a switch on the left rear of the receiver. When flipped up (on the Norwegian Krag-J rifles and carbines), the cut-off does not allow cartridges in the internal magazine to be fed into the chamber by the advancing bolt. This was intended to be used for when soldiers were comfortably firing at distant targets. After each shot, the soldier would take a round out of his pouch and load it directly into the chamber as if he was using single-shot rifle. The rounds in the magazine are thus held in reserve. If the enemy suddenly charged or the soldier was ordered to charge, the soldier could then retract the cut-off for up to five rounds of rapid shooting. The M1903 Springfield that replaced the Krags had a magazine cutoff, as did the SMLE (Lee\u2013Enfield) until 1915.\nDanish Krag\u2013J\u00f8rgensen rifles.\nAfter strenuous tests, Denmark adopted the Krag\u2013J\u00f8rgensen rifle on July 3, 1889. The Danish rifle differed in several key areas from the weapons later adopted by the United States and Norway, particularly in its use of a forward (as opposed to downward) hinged magazine door, the use of rimmed ammunition, and the use of an outer steel liner for the barrel.\nThe Danish Krag\u2013J\u00f8rgensen was chambered for the 8\u00d758R cartridge (0.31 in / 7.87\u00a0mm), and was at least in the early years used as a single shooter with the magazine in reserve. It stayed in service right up to the German invasion of Denmark on April 9, 1940. Danish Krags were given the German identification code \"Scharfsch\u00fctzen-Gewehr 312(d)\".\nSubtypes of the Danish Krag\u2013J\u00f8rgensen.\nWhile information on the various subtypes of the Krag\u2013J\u00f8rgensen used in Denmark has proven difficult to find, at least the following subtypes were manufactured:\nAmerican Krag\u2013J\u00f8rgensen rifles.\nJust like many other armed forces, the United States Military was searching for a new rifle in the early 1890s. A competition was held in 1892, comparing 53 rifle designs including Lee, Krag, Mannlicher, Mauser, and Schmidt\u2013Rubin. The trials were held at Governors Island, New York, and the finalists were all foreign manufacturers\u2014the Krag, the Lee, and the Mauser. The contract was awarded to the Krag design in August 1892, with initial production deferred as the result of protests from domestic inventors and arms manufacturers. Two rifle designers, Russell and Livermore, even sued the US government over the initial selection of the Krag, forcing a review of the testing results in April and May 1893. In spite of this, an improved form of the Krag\u2013J\u00f8rgensen was again selected, and was awarded the contract. The primary reason for the selection of the Krag appears to have been its magazine design, which could be topped off as needed without raising and retracting the bolt (thus putting the rifle temporarily out of action). Ordnance officials also believed the Krag's magazine cutoff and lower reloading speed to be an advantage, one which conserved ammunition on the battlefield. This magazine design would later resurface as a distinct disadvantage once U.S. soldiers encountered Spanish troops armed with the charger-loaded 1893 7mm Spanish Mauser in the Spanish\u2013American War.\nAround 500,000 \"Krags\" in .30 Army (.30-40) calibre were produced at the Springfield Armory in Massachusetts from 1894 to 1904. The Krag\u2013J\u00f8rgensen rifle in .30 Army found use in the Boxer Rebellion, the Spanish\u2013American War, and the Philippine\u2013American War. A few carbines were used by United States cavalry units fighting Apaches in New Mexico Territory and preventing poaching in Yellowstone National Park. Two-thousand rifles were taken to France by the United States Army 10th\u201319th engineers (railway) during World War I; but there is no evidence of use by front-line combat units during that conflict.\nThe US 'Krags' were chambered for the rimmed \"cartridge, caliber 30, U.S. Army\", round, also known as the .30 U.S., .30 Army, or .30 Government, and, more popularly, by its civilian name, the .30-40 Krag. The .30 Army was the first smokeless powder round adopted by the U.S. military, but its civilian name retained the \"caliber-charge\" designation of earlier black powder cartridges. Thus the .30-40 Krag employs a round-nose 220-grain (14 g) cupro-nickel jacketed .30 caliber (7.62\u00a0mm) bullet propelled by 40 grains (3 g) of smokeless powder to a muzzle velocity of approximately 2000 feet (600 m) per second. As with the .30-30 Winchester, it is the use of black powder nomenclature that leads to the incorrect assumption that the .30-40 Krag was once a black powder cartridge.\nIn U.S. service, the Krag eventually proved uncompetitive with Mauser-derived designs, most notably in combat operations in Cuba and the Philippines during the Spanish\u2013American War. It served as the U.S. military's primary rifle for only 12 years, when it was replaced by the M1903 Springfield rifle in 1906 and many units did not receive it until 1908 and later. Surplused Krags were given to the US Navy where they remained in second line service (to arm shore parties, boarding parties, and the like or stored in crates in the holds of older ships) well into the 1930s. US Marines were still using Krags in Nicaragua in the late 1920s.\nSubtypes of the Krag\u2013J\u00f8rgensen used in the United States.\nThere were at least nine different models of the American Krag\u2013J\u00f8rgensen:\nA few prototype Model 1898 sniper rifles were assembled with Cataract telescopic sights for limited testing. In 1901, 100 Model 1898 rifles, and 100 Model 1899 carbines were fitted with a Parkhurst clip loading attachment to test use of Mauser-type stripper clips. In 1902, 100 rifles were made with barrels in an effort to develop one model acceptable to both infantry and cavalry. The so-called \"NRA carbines\" were rifles cut down to carbine length for sale to members of the National Rifle Association of America beginning in 1926 as a means of keeping skilled armoury workmen employed at Benicia Arsenal.\nIn the Caribbean and Latin America.\nIn the early 20th century, the United States also distributed the Krag to some Caribbean countries in which US forces intervened. These included Haiti, where they equipped the Gendarmerie d'Ha\u00efti (newly founded in 1915) with surplus Krags. A 1919 letter to the Marine Commandant from the First Provisional Brigade in Port-au-Prince noted: \"\"...[A]bout 2,000 bandits infest the hills... I don't believe that in all Haiti there are more than 400 to 500 rifles, if that many. They are very short of ammunition.. They use our ammunition and the Krag by tying a piece of goatskin on string around the base of the cartridge.\"\nThe 1916-1924 American occupation of the Dominican Republic resulted in a small flow of Krags to that country. The Guardia Nacional Dominicana issued the received Krag rifles, though the rifles broke down quickly when issued to unfamiliar Dominican troops, and spare parts were hard to obtain. The discovery of Krag bullets in victims' bodies in the 1937 Parsley massacre was taken by US observers as evidence of the government's involvement in the killings. At the start of World War II, the Dominican government had 1,860 Krags on-hand, supplementing their over 2,000 Spanish Mausers.\nIn Nicaragua, to support the government of Adolfo D\u00edaz, the American government provided Krags to the newly formed Guardia Nacional in 1925. Selling them an additional 3,000 rifles in 1927. In 1961, Cuban militias were still fielding some Krag-J\u00f8rgensons during the Bay of Pigs invasion.\nIn Africa.\nIn 1919, the United States provided discounted arms sales to the Liberians, giving them a number of Springfield Krag rifles, in addition to Peabody and Mauser rifles.\nNorwegian Krag\u2013J\u00f8rgensen rifles.\nThe Swedish-Norwegian Rifle Commission started its work in 1891. One of their first tasks was to find the best possible calibre for the new weapon. After extensive ballistic tests where different calibres were tested (8\u00a0mm, 7.5\u00a0mm, 7\u00a0mm, 6.5\u00a0mm etc.), the optimal caliber was determined to be 6.5\u00a0mm (0.256\u00a0in). Following this decision, a joint Norwegian-Swedish commission was established in December 1893. This commission worked through a series of meetings to decide on the different measurements for the cartridge case. A rimless cartridge case of 55\u00a0mm length was approved, and each possible measurement (diameter at base, diameter at neck, angle of case, angle of shoulder etc.) was decided upon. The corresponding dimensions of the cartridge chamber to be used in a future service rifle was also determined. The cartridge became what is later known as 6.5\u00d755mm. The round of ammunition is also known as 6.5\u00d755 Krag, 6.5\u00d755 Scan (Scandinavia), 6.5\u00d755 Mauser, 6.5\u00d755 Swedish, and 6.5\u00d755 Nor (Norwegian), but they all referred to the same cartridge.\nSome historians have assumed that there was a difference in cartridge blueprint measurements between Swedish and Norwegian 6.5\u00d755mm ammunition, but this may be unintentional. Due to different interpretations of the blueprint standard, i.e. the standards of manufacturing using maximum chamber in the Krag vs. minimum chamber in the Swedish Mauser, a small percentage of the ammunition produced in Norway proved to be slightly oversize when chambered in the Swedish Mauser action, i.e. requiring a push on the bolt handle to chamber in the Swedish arm. A rumour arose not long after the 6.5\u00d755mm cartridge was adopted that one could use Swedish ammunition in Norwegian rifles, but not Norwegian ammunition in Swedish rifles. Some even alleged that this incompatibility was deliberate, to give Norway the tactical advantage of using captured ammunition in a war, while denying the same advantage to the Swedes. However, after the rumour first surfaced in 1900, the issue was examined by the Swedish military. They declared the difference to be insignificant, and that both the Swedish and Norwegian ammunition was within the specified parameters laid down. Despite this finding, the Swedish weapon-historian Josef Alm repeated the rumour in a book in the 1930s, leading many to believe that there was a significant difference between the ammunition manufactured in Norway and Sweden. It is worth noting that Sweden would later adopt a 6.5\u00d755mm rifle with a much stronger Mauser bolt action, the m/94 carbine in 1894 and the m/96 rifle in 1896, both of which were proof-tested with loads generating significantly more pressure than those used to proof the Norwegian Krag action.\nOnce the question of ammunition was settled, the Norwegians started looking at a modern arm to fire their newly designed cartridge. The processing was modelled on the US Army Ordnance selection process and considered, among other things, sharp-shooting at different ranges, shooting with defective or dirty ammunition, rapidity of shooting, conservation of ammunition, corrosion resistance, and ease of assembly and disassembly. After the test, three rifles were shortlisted:\nAbout fifty Krag\u2013J\u00f8rgensen rifles were produced in 1893 and issued to soldiers for field testing. The reports were good, and a few modifications were later incorporated into the design. For example, to prevent double feed manlfunctions, the extractor was redesigned to replace push feed with controlled feed, and sear leaf spring was replaced by a coil spring.\nDespite the fact that both the Mannlicher and Mauser submissions were significantly faster to reload than the Krag, the latter, having been designed in Norway, was selected. As in the United States, rapidity of fire was deemed to be of lesser importance in an era when current military philosophy still emphasized precise aimed fire and conservation of ammunition. Instead, the magazine was looked upon as a reserve, to be used only when authorized by a commanding officer. The Krag\u2013J\u00f8rgensen was formally adopted as the new rifle for the Norwegian Army on April 21, 1894.\nA total of more than 215,000 Krag\u2013J\u00f8rgensen rifles and carbines were built at the Kongsberg Arms Factory in Norway. 33,500 additional M/1894 rifles were produced at Steyr (\u00d6sterreichische Waffenfabrik Gesellschaft) in 1896\u20131897 under contracts for the Norwegian Army (29,000 rifles) and the Civilian Marksmanship Organisation (4,500 rifles). The various subtypes of Krag\u2013J\u00f8rgensen replaced all rifles and carbines previously used by the Norwegian armed forces, notably the Jarmann M1884, the Krag\u2013Petersson and the last of the remaining Remington M1867 and modified kammerladers rimfire rifles and carbines.\nNorwegian-style Krag rifles in Boer service.\nA number of 1896 and 1897 Steyr-manufactured Krag rifles resembling the M1894 Norwegian and chambered in 6.5\u00d755, but lacking some Norwegian inspection markings and having serial numbers outside the sequences of those produced for Norway, were in Boer hands during the Second Boer War (1899\u20131902), most have serial numbers below 900. Markings show these rifles were manufactured by Steyr concurrently with a large order of M1894 rifles made for Norway. Some parts of rejected Norwegian rifles may have been used in these weapons\u2014many small parts have serial numbers that do not match receiver numbers, these mismatched small parts sometimes have numbers in ranges of rifles made for Norway, yet appear original to the rifle. Photographs of high-ranking Boer officers holding M1894-like rifles exist. Cartridge casings in 6.5\u00d755 have been found on the Magersfontein battlefield and may have been fired by such M1894-like rifles. Some sources state that about 100 1896-date and at least about 200 1897-date rifles reached the Boers. Some rifles meeting this description exist in South African museums with Boer-war documentation, and in England documented as captured bring-backs. A few rifles having Norwegian inspector stamps and serial numbers in the civilian marksmanship organization serial number range are also known to be in South African museums and may have been used by Boer forces\u2014it is suspected that these may have arrived in South Africa with a small Scandinavian volunteer force that fought for the Boers. A small number of Steyr 1897 M1894-like 6.5\u00d755 rifles with 3-digit serial numbers outside the Norwegian contract ranges and in the same range as these Boer Krags, and lacking Norwegian inspection stamps like the low-numbered 1897 rifles in South African museums, are known to exist in the US\u2014it is not known if these have Boer connections or were initially delivered elsewhere.\nSubtypes of the Krag\u2013J\u00f8rgensen used in Norway.\nThe Krag\u2013J\u00f8rgensen was produced in Norway for a very long time, and in a number of different variations. The major military models are the following:\nIn addition, most models were produced for the civilian market as well. After World War II a limited number of Krag\u2013J\u00f8rgensens were made in purely civilian models.\nBayonets for Norwegian Krag\u2013J\u00f8rgensen.\nThe Swedish-Norwegian Rifle Commission only briefly looked into bayonets, focusing on selecting the best possible rifle. However, their report mentions that they have experimented with knife bayonets and spike bayonets, both in loose forms and in folding forms. Very few of the experimental bayonets are known today.\nThe bayonet that was finally approved, probably alongside the rifle itself, was a knife bayonet. Later on, longer bayonets were approved as well, and renewed experiments with spike bayonets took place during the development of the M/1912.\nA number of special bayonets and oddities were experimented with during the time the Krag\u2013J\u00f8rgensen was a Norwegian service rifle, two of which are mentioned here.\nProduction for Nazi Germany during World War II.\nDuring the occupation of Norway by Nazi Germany, the German forces demanded that Kongsberg V\u00e5penfabrikk build weapons for the German armed forces. They placed large orders for the Krag\u2013J\u00f8rgensen, the Colt M1914 (license-produced Colt M1911), and 40\u00a0mm anti-aircraft guns. However, production was kept down by sabotage and slow work by the employees. Out of the total of 13,450 rifles ordered by the Germans, only between 3,350 and 3,800 were actually delivered. Early deliveries were identical to the M1894, but with German proof marks and substandard workmanship compared to M1894 produced earlier. During the war the model was altered to be externally more like the German Kar98K. This was achieved by shortening the barrel by 15\u00a0cm (6\u00a0inches) down to 61.3\u00a0cm (24\u00a0inches) and shortening the stock by 18\u00a0cm (7\u00a0inches), and adding a front sight hood similar to that of the Kar98K. These shortened Krag\u2013J\u00f8rgensen's were known in Norway as the \"Stomperud-Krag\", nicknamed after the main character from Norwegian comedy comic strip Nr. 91 Stomperud. A number of the Krag\u2013J\u00f8rgensens manufactured for the Germans have been described as \"bastards\", created from mismatched parts left over from previous production.\nExperiments with using the German standard issue 7.92\u00d757mm ammunition, a cartridge as powerful as the .30-06 and the modern 7.62 mm NATO, also took place.\nWhile information on the Wehrmacht's use of the Krag\u2013J\u00f8rgensen is hard to find, it is assumed that it was issued primarily to second line units since the Wehrmacht attempted to only issue firearms in standard calibres to front line troops. It was also issued to the Hird\u2014the armed part of Nasjonal Samling (NS) (\"National Unity\"), the national-socialist party of Vidkun Quisling's puppet government. It is further likely that the experiments with 7.92\u00a0mm ammunition means that the Germans considered a wider use of the Krag\u2013J\u00f8rgensen.\nPost-war production.\nA few Krag\u2013J\u00f8rgensen rifles were put together after 1945, for sale to civilian hunters and sharpshooters, among them 1600 of the so-called \"Stomperud Krag\". While there were at no point any plans for re-equipping the Norwegian Army with the Krag\u2013J\u00f8rgensen, attempts were made to adapt it to firing more modern, high-powered ammunition like the .30-06 and 7.62mm NATO rounds. While this was found to be possible, it required a new barrel (or relined barrels) and modification to the bolt and receiver. The resulting cost of the conversion was about the same as that of a new gun of a more modern design. The last Krag\u2013J\u00f8rgensen rifles in production were the M/1948 Elgrifle (moose rifle), of which 500 were made in 1948\u201349 and the M/1951 Elgrifle (moose rifle), of which 1000 were made in 1950\u201351.\nAs a civilian target rifle.\nBefore the Sauer 200 STR was approved as the new standard Scandinavian target rifle, rebarreled and re-stocked Krag\u2013J\u00f8rgensen rifles were the standard Norwegian target rifle together with the Kongsberg-Mauser M59 and M67. The Krag was preferred for shooting on covered ranges and in fair weather, and dominated on the speed-shooting exercises due to its smooth action, and very fast loading with a spring speedloader, however it was known to change its point of impact under wet conditions due to the single front locking lug. Thus, many shooters had both a Krag and a \"Mauser\" for varying conditions.\nSpecial Krag\u2013J\u00f8rgensen rifles / carbines and oddities.\nThe Krag\u2013J\u00f8rgensen was manufactured for almost 60 years in Norway. During this time several special models and prototypes were designed and manufactured. Some of these special weapons were meant as an aid in production or to meet a specific demand, but there were also various attempts to increase the firepower of the weapon.\nModel rifles.\nThe so-called \"model rifles\" were used both when the various sub types were approved and as a guide for manufacturing. Basically, the model rifle or model carbine was a specially manufactured weapon that showed how the approved weapon should be. They were numbered and stored separately. Several model rifles and carbines were manufactured for things like a change in surface treatment or other seemingly minor things. There were especially many model rifles made for the M1894, since several were sent to Steyr in Austria to work as controls and models.\nHarpoon rifles.\nA small number of Krag\u2013J\u00f8rgensen rifles were converted into harpoon guns, in the same fashion as Jarmann M1884s were converted to Jarmann harpoon rifles. It was realized that converting the Jarmann was more cost efficient than converting the Krag\u2013J\u00f8rgensen, so further conversions was halted. It is not known how many were converted in this way.\nModified for belt feed.\nThe factory museum at Kongsberg Weapon Factory preserved a prototype of an M1894 modified for belt feed. Although no documentation has been uncovered, it's clear that the rifle has been modified at an early stage in the manufacturing process to use the same feed belts that were used on the Hotchkiss heavy machine gun in use in the Norwegian Army at the time.\nThe backward and forward movement of the bolt operates a mechanism that moves the belt through the receiver, presenting fresh rounds for the weapon. While this may have been advantageous while fighting from fixed fortifications, it cannot have been very practical for the user of the rifle to carry a long feed belt with him in the field. Even so, it is an interesting and early attempt to increase the firepower of the Krag\u2013J\u00f8rgensen.\nLieutenant Tobiensen's \"speed loader\".\nIn 1923 Lieutenant Tobiesen, working at Kongsberg Weapon Factory, designed what he called a \"speed loader for repeating rifles\". It can be seen as a new attempt to increase the firepower of the Krag\u2013J\u00f8rgensen, just as the attempt to convert it to belt feed. The design consisted of a modified cover that let the user of the rifle attach a magazine from the Madsen light machine gun. The cover had a selector switch, allowing the user to select if he wanted to use the Krag\u2013J\u00f8rgensen's internal magazine with its 5 rounds of ammunition, or if he wanted to use the external magazine with 25 rounds.\nThe design was considered promising enough that eight prototypes were manufactured and tested. However, in testing it was revealed that the heavy magazine mounted on the side of the weapon not only made the rifle more cumbersome to carry and use, but also made it twist sideways. It was decided that the \"speed loader\" was not a practical design for military use and no further manufacture took place.\nIn 1926, a group of seal hunters approached Kongsberg Weapon Factory and asked to purchase a number of speedloaders for use when hunting seals from small boats. They were turned down due to the high cost of manufacturing a limited number of the devices.\nModified to self loaders.\nAt the same time that the Hotchkiss heavy machine gun was introduced to the Norwegian Army, some people started considering modifying the Krag\u2013J\u00f8rgensen to semi-automatic fire. Doing so would have multiplied the firepower of the infantry, allowing more weight of fire to be brought at a target. Most of the designs put forward were not very well thought out and few of the designers knew enough about firearms to be able to calculate the pressures and dimensions necessary. However, two designs were investigated further, and eventually one prototype was built.\nSunngaard's automatic rifle.\nIn 1915 Sergeant Sunngaard proposed a design for making the Krag\u2013J\u00f8rgensen into a selfloading rifle. The design was considered over a period of time before it was declared to be 'quite without value', primarily because the requisite pressure would not be attainable without major redesign of the rifle. For this reason, no prototype was made.\nSelf-loading device SNABB 38.\nIn 1938 a Swedish design called the SNABB was considered. This was a modification that could be made to virtually any bolt-action rifle allowing it to be converted into a self-loading weapon, therefore presenting a chance to cut costs as compared to manufacturing new weapons. The device used gas pressure to operate the bolt handle with the help of a runner. The modification was deemed by some to be unnecessarily complicated. A separate pistolgrip was needed, and the receiver needed major modifications.\nA prototype was manufactured in the autumn of 1938 and tested for several months. While moderately successful, the modification would cost about three times as much as originally thought, and the project was dropped due to lack of funds.\nAmmunition.\nThe various Krag\u2013J\u00f8rgensens were manufactured for a wide variety of ammunition. Apart from various civilian calibres, the rifle was manufactured for the following service ammunition:\nContrary to some rumors, the Krag\u2013J\u00f8rgensen action can be modified to fire modern, high-power cartridges. During World War II, and also in the early 1950s, several were produced in 7.92\u00d757mm, which can hardly be considered a low-power cartridge. A number of Krag\u2013J\u00f8rgensens have also been converted to .30-06 and 7.62\u00d751mm NATO for target shooting and hunting. However, it must be stressed that these were all late-production Norwegian Krag\u2013J\u00f8rgensen rifles, made in an era when metallurgy was vastly more advanced than when the American Krag\u2013J\u00f8rgensen rifles were made. Krag\u2013J\u00f8rgensen rifles also only have a single locking lug.\nNonetheless, older rifles may benefit from milder loads. Modern European 6.5\u00d755mm rounds are sometimes loaded to a CIP maximum of 55000 PSI, but 6.5\u00d755mm rounds marked \"safe for the Krag\" are loaded to a milder 40600 PSI. SAAMI specifications call for maximum average pressure of 46000 PSI, sufficient for with a 160 grain bullet.\nComparison of service rifles.\nWhat follows is a comparison between the Danish, American and Norwegian service weapons.\nComparison with contemporary rifles.\nAt the time of adoption in Denmark, the United States and Norway, the Krag\u2013J\u00f8rgensen was seen as the best available rifle. Here it is compared with rifles of later decades. In the U.S. trials, the Krag competed against the Mauser Model 92 (as well as many other designs), not the improved Model 98.

The caldera is part of a volcanic island group (Krakatoa archipelago) comprising four islands. Two of them are known as Lang and Verlaten; another, Rakata, is the only remnant of an island, also called Krakatoa, mostly destroyed by an eruption in 1883 which created the caldera.\nIn 1927, a fourth island, Anak Krakatoa, or \"Child of Krakatoa\", emerged from the caldera formed in 1883. There has been new eruptive activity since the late 20th century, with a large collapse causing the 2018 Sunda Strait tsunami.\nHistorical significance.\nThe most notable eruptions of Krakatoa culminated in a series of massive explosions over 26\u201327 August 1883, which were among the most violent volcanic events in recorded history.\nWith an estimated Volcanic explosivity index (VEI) of 6, the eruption was equivalent to \u2014about 13,000 times the nuclear yield of the Little Boy bomb (13 to 16 kt) dropped on Hiroshima, Japan, during World War II, and four times the yield of Tsar Bomba, the most powerful nuclear device ever detonated at 50 Mt.\nThe 1883 eruption ejected approximately of rock. The cataclysmic explosion was heard away in Alice Springs, Australia, and on the island of Rodrigues near Mauritius, to the west.\nAccording to the official records of the Dutch East Indies colony, 165 villages and towns were destroyed near Krakatoa, and 132 were seriously damaged. At least 36,417 people died, and many more thousands were injured, mostly from the tsunamis that followed the explosion. The eruption destroyed two-thirds of the island of Krakatoa.\nEruptions in the area since 1927 have built a new island at the same location, named \"Anak Krakatau\" (which is Indonesian for \"Child of Krakatoa\"). Periodic eruptions have continued since, with recent eruptions in 2009, 2010, 2011, and 2012, and a major collapse in 2018. In late 2011, this island had a radius of roughly , and a highest point of about above sea level, growing each year.\nIn 2017, the height of Anak Krakatau was reported as over above sea level; following a collapse in December 2018, the height was reduced to 110 meters (361\u00a0ft).\nEtymology.\nOne of the earliest mentions of the name Krakatoa is in the Old Sundanese text Bujangga Manik, which was probably written in western Java in the late 15th century. Here Krakatoa is referred to as \"the island of Rakata, a mountain in the middle of the sea\" (\"pulo Rakata gunung ti tengah sagara\", f. 27v). Although there are earlier descriptions in European sources of an island in the Sunda Strait with a \"pointed mountain,\" the earliest mention of Krakatoa by name in the western world was on a 1611 map by Lucas Janszoon Waghenaer, who labelled the island \"Pulo Carcata\" (\"pulo\" is the Sundanese word for \"island\"). About two dozen variants have been found, including \"Crackatouw,\" \"Cracatoa,\" and \"Krakatao\" (in an older Portuguese-based spelling). The first known appearance of the spelling \"Krakatau\" was by Wouter Schouten, who passed by \"the high tree-covered island of Krakatau\" in October 1658.\nThe origin of the Indonesian name \"Krakatau\" is uncertain. The main theories are:\nThe Smithsonian Institution's Global Volcanism Program cites the Indonesian name, \"Krakatau,\" as the correct name, but says that \"Krakatoa\" is often employed.\nGeographical setting.\nIndonesia has over 130 active volcanoes, the most of any nation. They make up the axis of the Indonesian island arc system produced by northeastward subduction of the Indo-Australian Plate. A majority of these volcanoes lie along Indonesia's two largest islands, Java and Sumatra. These two islands are separated by the Sunda Strait located at a bend in the axis of the island arc. Krakatau is directly above the subduction zone of the Eurasian Plate and the Indo-Australian Plate where the plate boundaries make a sharp change of direction, possibly resulting in an unusually weak crust in the region.\nPre-1883 history.\nAt some point in prehistory, an earlier caldera-forming eruption had occurred, leaving as remnants Verlaten (or \"Sertung\"); Lang (also known as Rakata Kecil, or Panjang); Poolsche Hoed (\"Polish Hat\"); and the base of Rakata. Later, at least two more cones (Perboewatan and Danan) formed and eventually joined with Rakata, forming the main island of Krakatoa. At the time of the 1883 eruption, the Krakatoa group comprised Lang, Verlaten, and Krakatoa itself, an island long by wide. There were also the tree-covered islet near Lang (Poolsche Hoed) and several small rocky islets or banks between Krakatoa and Verlaten.\nThere were three volcanic cones on Krakatoa island: Rakata, () to the south; Danan, () near the center; and Perboewatan, () to the north.\nAD 416 event.\nThe Javanese \"\" (\"Pustaka Raja\"), a 19th-century compilation of historical traditions from Central Java, records that in the year 338 \u015aaka (416 AD):\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;A thundering sound was heard from the mountain Batuwara [now called Pulosari, an extinct volcano in Bantam, the nearest to the Sunda Strait] which was answered by a similar noise from Kapi, lying westward of the modern Bantam [(Banten) is the westernmost province in Java, so this seems to indicate that Krakatoa is meant]. A great glowing fire, which reached the sky, came out of the last-named mountain; the whole world was greatly shaken and violent thundering, accompanied by heavy rain and storms took place, but not only did not this heavy rain extinguish the eruption of the fire of the mountain Kapi, but augmented the fire; the noise was fearful, at last the mountain Kapi with a tremendous roar burst into pieces and sank into the deepest of the earth. The water of the sea rose and inundated the land, the country to the east of the mountain Batuwara, to the mountain Rajabasa [the most southerly volcano in Sumatra], was inundated by the sea; the inhabitants of the northern part of the Sunda country to the mountain Rajabasa were drowned and swept away with all property ... The water subsided but the land on which Kapi stood became sea, and Java and Sumatra were divided into two parts.\nThe \"Pustaka Raja\" does not draw on primary sources for its description of this event, and its historical reliability is highly dubious. It is therefore impossible to verify its description of this eruption. There is no geological evidence presented that substantiates this eruption. David Keys, Ken Wohletz, and others have postulated that a violent volcanic eruption, possibly of Krakatoa, in 535 was responsible for the global climate changes of 535\u2013536. Drilling projects in Sunda Strait ruled out any possibility that an eruption took place in 535 AD.\nMiddle Ages.\nThornton mentions that Krakatoa was known as \"The Fire Mountain\" during Java's Sailendra dynasty, with records of seven eruptive events between the 9th and 16th centuries. These have been tentatively dated as having occurred in 850, 950, 1050, 1150, 1320, and 1530.\n1680.\nIn February 1681, Johann Wilhelm Vogel, a Dutch mining engineer at Salida, Sumatra (near Padang), on his way to Batavia (now Jakarta) passed through the Sunda Strait. In his diary he wrote:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;...I saw with amazement that the island of Krakatoa, on my first trip to Sumatra [June 1679] completely green and healthy with trees, lay completely burnt and barren in front of our eyes and that at four locations was throwing up large chunks of fire. And when I asked the ship's Captain when the aforementioned island had erupted, he told me that this had happened in May 1680 ... He showed me a piece of pumice as big as his fist.\nVogel spent several months in Batavia, returning to Sumatra in November 1681. On the same ship were several other Dutch travellers, including Elias Hesse, a writer. Hesse's journal reports:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;...on the 19th [of November 1681] we again lifted anchor and proceeded first to the north of us to the island of Sleepzie (Sebesi), uninhabited, ... and then still north of the island of Krakatou, which erupted about a year ago and also is uninhabited. The rising smoke column of this island can be seen from miles away; we were with our ship very close to shore and we could see the trees sticking out high on the mountain, and which looked completely burned, but we could not see the fire itself.\nThe eruption was also reported by a Bengali sea captain, who wrote of the event later, but had not recorded it at the time in the ship's log. Neither Vogel nor Hesse mention Krakatoa in any real detail in their other passages, and no other travellers at the time mention an eruption or evidence of one. (In November 1681, a pepper crop was being offered for sale by inhabitants.)\nSimon Winchester maintains, in his 2003 book \"\", that the 1680 eruption was depicted in an eighteenth-century etching by Dutch cartographer Jan van Schley called \"Het Brandende Eiland\", \"The Burning Island,\" writing that \"it was a depiction, without a doubt, of the otherwise little-chronicled eruption that supposedly took place in 1680.\"\nIn 1880, Verbeek investigated a fresh unweathered lava flow at the northern coast of Perboewatan, which he claimed could not have been more than two centuries old.\nVisit by HMS \"Discovery\".\nIn February 1780, the crews of and , on the way home after Captain James Cook's death in Hawai\u02bbi, stopped for a few days on Krakatoa. They found a freshwater and a hot spring on the island. They described the natives who then lived on the island as \"friendly\" and made several sketches (In his journal, John Ledyard calls the island \"Cocoterra\").\nVisit by USS \"Peacock\".\nEdmund Roberts calls the island \"Crokatoa\" in his journal. A paraphrased account follows: \nOn 8 September 1832, US sloop-of-war \"Peacock\" anchored off the north end, also visiting Lang Island, in search of inhabitants, fresh water and yams. It was found difficult to land anywhere, due to a heavy surf and to the coral having extended itself to a considerable distance from the shore. Hot springs boiling furiously up, through many fathoms of water, were found on the eastern side of Krakatoa, from the shore. Roberts, Captain Geisinger, and marine lieutenant Fowler visited Forsaken island, having mistaken the singing of locusts for the sound of running water. The boat glided over crystal clear water, over an extensive and highly beautiful submarine garden. Corals of every shape and hue were there, some resembling sunflowers and mushrooms, others cabbages from in diameter, while a third type bore a striking likeness to the rose. The hillsides were typical of tropical climate; large flocks of parrots, monkeys in great variety, wild-mango and orange groves\u2014a superb scene of plants and flowers of every description, glowing in vivid tints of purple, red, blue, brown, and green\u2014but not water or provisions.\nDutch activity.\nIn 1620, the Dutch set up a naval station on the islands and somewhat later a shipyard was built. Sometime in the late 17th century, an attempt was made to establish a pepper plantation on Krakatoa, but the islands were generally ignored by the Dutch East India Company. In 1809, a penal colony was established at an unspecified location, which was in operation for about a decade. By the 1880s, the islands were without permanent inhabitants; the nearest settlement was the nearby island of Sebesi (about away) with a population of 3,000.\nSeveral surveys and mariners' charts were made, and the islands were little explored or studied. An 1854 map of the islands was used in an English chart, which shows some difference from a Dutch chart made in 1874. In July 1880, Rogier Verbeek made an official survey of the islands, but was allowed to spend only a few hours there. He was able to collect samples from several places, and his investigation later proved important in judging the geological impact of the 1883 eruption.\n1883 eruption.\nWhile seismic activity around the volcano was intense in the years preceding the cataclysmic 1883 eruption, a series of lesser eruptions began on 20 May 1883. The volcano released huge plumes of steam and ash lasting until late August.\nOn 27 August, a series of four huge explosions almost destroyed the island. The explosions were so violent that they were heard away in Perth, Western Australia, and the island of Rodrigues near Mauritius, away. The pressure wave from the third and most violent explosion was recorded on barographs around the world. Several barographs recorded the wave seven times over the course of five days: four times with the wave travelling away from the volcano to its antipodal point, and three times travelling back to the volcano; the wave rounded the globe three and a half times. Ash was propelled to a height of . It was reported that the sound of the eruption was so loud that anyone within would have gone deaf.\nThe combined effects of pyroclastic flows, volcanic ashes, and tsunamis had disastrous results in the region and worldwide. The death toll recorded by the Dutch authorities was 36,417, although some sources put the estimate at more than 120,000. There are numerous documented reports of groups of human skeletons floating across the Indian Ocean on rafts of volcanic pumice and washing up on the east coast of Africa up to a year after the eruption. Summer temperatures in the northern hemisphere fell by an average of in the year following the eruption.\nAftermath.\nAnak Krakatau.\nVerbeek, in his report on the eruption, predicted that any new activity would manifest itself in the region which had been between Perboewatan and Danan. This prediction came true on 29 December 1927, when a submarine lava dome in the area of Perboewatan showed evidence of eruptions (an earlier event in the same area had been reported in June 1927). A new island volcano rose above the waterline a few days later. The eruptions were initially of pumice and ash, and that island and the two islands that followed were quickly eroded away by the sea. Eventually, a fourth island, named Anak Krakatau (meaning \"child of Krakatoa\" in Indonesian), broke water in August 1930 and produced lava flows more quickly than the waves could erode them.\nPolitical.\nOn October 2, 1883, five weeks after the eruption, a Dutch soldier was repeatedly stabbed by a bearded, white-robed man while paying for tobacco in the small town of Serang. The would-be assassin was never captured, but a similarly-dressed man attacked a sentry at the garrison six weeks later, blaming the Dutch for bringing divine vengeance upon the area. The \"extreme religious zeal\" noted by the man's interrogators seen as widespread, and historians suggest it was exploited by rising Muslim conservatives and anticolonial leaders (such as Abdul Karim Amrullah) to foment the Banten Peasant's Revolt in 1888, and to prey upon the Dutch conscience made uneasy by \"Max Havelaar\" and subsequent revelations of abuses. \nThe explosion was the first natural disaster in history whose effects were definitively felt worldwide and whose cause was known, following the development of transoceanic communication cables. Winchester suggests the disaster marks the birth of an era of global awareness.\nBiological research.\nThe islands have become a major case study of island biogeography and founder populations in an ecosystem being built from the ground up in an environment virtually cleaned.\nThe islands had been little studied or biologically surveyed before the 1883 catastrophe\u2014only two pre-1883 biological collections are known: one of plant specimens and the other part of a shell collection. From descriptions and drawings made by , the flora appears to have been representative of a typical Javan tropical climax forest. The pre-1883 fauna is virtually unknown but was probably typical of the smaller islands in the area.\nBotanical studies.\nFrom a biological perspective, the \"Krakatau problem\" refers to the question of whether the islands were completely sterilized by the 1883 eruption or whether some indigenous life survived. When the first researchers reached the islands in May 1884, the only living thing they found was a spider in a crevice on the south side of Rakata. Life quickly recolonized the islands, however; Verbeek's visit in October 1884 found grass shoots already growing. The eastern side of the island has been extensively vegetated by trees and shrubs, presumably brought there as seeds washed up by ocean currents or carried in birds' droppings (or brought by natives and scientific investigators). However, the floral ecosystem on Rakata is considerably vulnerable to environmental factors, and has been damaged by recent eruptions at Anak Krakatau.\nHandl's occupancy.\nIn 1914, plans were to set aside Rakata as a nature preserve. In 1916, Johann Handl, a German \"pumice collector\", obtained a permit to mine pumice, against \"strong community objections\", apparently to get away from World War I. His lease of (basically the eastern half of the island) was to be for 30 years. Handl took up residence on the south coast of Rakata, where he built a house and planted a garden along with \"four European families and about 30 coolies\". Handl found un-burned wood below the 1883 ash deposits while digging, and fresh water was found below . He and his entourage stayed there for four years, but left due to \"violation of the terms of the lease.\" It is his party that is believed to have inadvertently introduced the black rat to the island, which quickly proliferated.\nConservation.\nKrakatoa was declared as a nature reserve in 1921, corresponding to IUCN management category Ia (strict nature reserve). Along with several other nature reserves, it was proposed as a national park in 1980. In 1991, \"Ujung Kulon National Park and Krakatau Nature Reserve\" was inscribed as an UNESCO World Heritage Site, matching Natural criteria (vii) and (x). Ujung Kulon National Park was officially established in 1992, including Krakatoa.\nIn popular culture.\nA large part of the 1947 children's novel \"The Twenty-One Balloons\" by William Pene du Bois takes place on Krakatoa, just before and then during the 1883 eruption. In Pene du Bois's tale, 25 families have established a fanciful colony drawing vast wealth from fictional diamond mines on the island until the eruption scatters the inhabitants and destroys the mines.\nKrakatoa has been featured as a subject and a part of the story in various television and film dramas. In the 1953 film \"Fair Wind to Java\", an American sea captain and a pirate leader race one another to recover a fortune in diamonds hidden on Krakatoa, which begins its final eruption as they search the island for the treasure. \nIn 1961, the anthology series \"\" ended its run with the episode \"Eye Witness,\" which dramatized the mysterious reporting of Krakatoa's eruption weeks before the news could have reached the newspaper in Boston.\nThe island was a prominent part of the plot of '\"Crack of Doom,\" episode six of the Irwin Allen television series \"The Time Tunnel\" in 1966.\nIt was also featured as the main part of the story line in the 1969 film, \"Krakatoa, East of Java\" (retitled \"Volcano\" in a re-release in the 1970s; the title contains a rather large geographical error, as Krakatoa is \"west\" of Java), which depicts an effort to salvage a priceless cargo of pearls located perilously close to the erupting volcano.\nAn Indonesian martial arts action film, \"Krakatau\" (1977), starring Dicky Zulkarnaen and Advent Bangun, set the story on the mountain.\nThe 1984 video game \"Escape from Krakatoa\" imagines a helicopter rescue from the erupting Krakatoa volcano. \nIt has been the subject of a 2006 television drama, \"Krakatoa: Volcano of Destruction\" and again in 2008 as \"Krakatoa\".\nIn Klaus Teuber's board game \"Seafarers of Catan\", the \"Krakatoa Variant\" is a scenario involving an island composed of three volcano tiles.\nIn 1973, the American progressive rock band Styx released a spoken-word track called \"Krakatoa\" on its album \"The Serpent Is Rising.\" Written by then-guitarist John Curulewski along with Paul Beaver and Bernie Krause, the song tells the story of Krakatoa's eruption and the subsequent return of life to the island.\nThe British heavy metal band Saxon also released a song about the 1883 eruption of Krakatoa, called \"Krakatoa\", on the 2010 re-release of its 1985 album \"Innocence Is No Excuse\".\nReferences.\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography.\n\"See Krakatoa documentary and historical materials\""}

The word is often used to refer to the Moscow Kremlin, and metonymically to the government based there. Other such fortresses are called \"detinets\", such as the Novgorod Detinets.\nEtymology.\nThe Russian word is of uncertain origin. Different versions include the word originating from the Turkic languages, the Greek language or from Baltic languages. The word may share the same root as \"kremen\"' (Russian: , , ), meaning 'flint'.\nHistory.\nThe term \"kremlin\" (also \"kremnik\") is first encountered in chronicles of 1317 in accounts of the construction of the Tver Kremlin, where a wooden city-fortress was erected, which was clayed and whitewashed. The term \"detinets\" (such as in the Novgorod Detinets) is considered to be older and was kept in the Novgorod region, while the term \"krom\" (such as in the Pskov Krom) was more often used in the Pskov region. In other Russian regions, such as in the Moscow and Tver regions, fortresses in the center of cities began to use the term \"kremlin\" instead, which superseded the term \"detinets\" in the 14th and 15th centuries.\nWooden fortresses were erected everywhere in the Russian state\u2014from the far eastern lands to the Swedish border. They were numerous in the south, where they served as a link of fortified fortification zones cutting off the way to the central regions from Crimean Tatars. Aesthetically wooden fortresses were not inferior to stone ones\u2014and we can regret that the towers of wooden kremlins have not survived to this day. Wooden fortresses were built quickly: in 1638 in Mtsensk fortress walls of Bolshoi Ostrog and Pletny Gorod with a total length of about 3 kilometres with 13 towers and almost one hundred meters long bridge over the River Zusha were erected in 20 days. The town of Sviyazhsk was built similarly during the Kazan campaign in the spring of 1551: fortress walls about 2.5 kilometres long, many churches and houses were erected in a month.\nLater on, many Kremlins were rebuilt and strengthened. Thus, the Moscow Kremlin under Ivan III was reconstructed using brick.\nIn the 16th and 17th centuries, about 30 stone fortresses were built in the Russian state. New kremlins have regular geometric forms in plan (Zaraisky and Tula Kremlins). The Tula Kremlin is unique because it was built in a valley (which was possible because of undeveloped siege artillery of nomad Tatars).\nConstruction of the Kremlin lasted until the turn of the 17th and 18th centuries. The last kremlin structure \u2013 the Tobolsk Kremlin \u2013 was built using stone between 1699 and 1717 in the town of Tobolsk (the easternmost kremlin in Russia).\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The phenomenon is closely connected with the technology life cycle.\nIt is stated that the period of a wave ranges from forty to sixty years, the cycles consist of alternating intervals of high sectoral growth and intervals of relatively slow growth.\nLong wave theory is not accepted by most academic economists. Among economists who accept it, there is a lack of agreement about both the cause of the waves and the start and end years of particular waves. Among critics of the theory, the consensus is that it involves recognizing patterns that may not exist (apophenia).\nHistory of concept.\nThe Soviet economist Nikolai Kondratiev (also written Kondratieff or Kondratyev) was the first to bring these observations to international attention in his book \"The Long Waves in Economic Life\" (1926) alongside other works written in the same decade. In 1939, Joseph Schumpeter suggested naming the cycles \"Kondratieff waves\" in his honor. The underlying idea is closely linked to organic composition of capital.\nTwo Dutch economists, Jacob van Gelderen and Salomon de Wolff, had previously argued for the existence of 50- to 60-year cycles in 1913 and 1924, respectively.\nSince the inception of the theory, various studies have expanded the range of possible cycles, finding longer or shorter cycles in the data. The Marxist scholar Ernest Mandel revived interest in long-wave theory with his 1964 essay predicting the end of the long boom after five years and in his Alfred Marshall lectures in 1979. However, in Mandel's theory long waves are the result of the normal business cycle and noneconomic factors, such as wars.\nIn 1996, George Modelski and William R. Thompson published a book documenting K-Waves dating back to 930 AD in China. Separately, Michael Snyder wrote: \"economic cycle theories have enabled some analysts to correctly predict the timing of recessions, stock market peaks and stock market crashes over the past couple of decades\".\nThe historian Eric Hobsbawm also wrote of the theory: \"That good predictions have proved possible on the basis of Kondratiev Long Waves\u2014this is not very common in economics\u2014has convinced many historians and even some economists that there is something in them, even if we don't know what\".\nUS economist Anwar Shaikh analyses the movement of the general price level - prices expressed in gold - in the US and the UK since 1890 and identifies three long cycles with troughs ca. in 1895, 1939 and 1982. With this model 2018 was another trough between the third and a possible future fourth cycle.\nCharacteristics of the cycle.\nKondratiev identified three phases in the cycle, namely expansion, stagnation and recession. More common today is the division into four periods with a turning point (collapse) between expansion and stagnation.\nWriting in the 1920s, Kondratiev proposed to apply the theory to the 19th century:\nThe long cycle supposedly affects all sectors of an economy. Kondratiev focused on prices and interest rates, seeing the ascendant phase as characterized by an increase in prices and low interest rates while the other phase consists of a decrease in prices and high interest rates. Subsequent analysis concentrated on output.\nExplanations of the cycle.\nTechnological innovation theory.\nAccording to the innovation theory, these waves arise from the bunching of basic innovations that launch technological revolutions that in turn create leading industrial or commercial sectors. Kondratiev's ideas were taken up by Joseph Schumpeter in the 1930s. The theory hypothesized the existence of very long-run macroeconomic and price cycles, originally estimated to last 50\u201354 years.\nIn recent decades there has been considerable progress in historical economics and the history of technology, and numerous investigations of the relationship between technological innovation and economic cycles. Some of the works involving long cycle research and technology include Mensch (1979), Tylecote (1991), the International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA) (Marchetti, Ayres), Freeman and Lou\u00e7\u00e3 (2001), Andrey Korotayev and Carlota Perez.\nPerez (2002) places the phases on a logistic or \"S\" curve, with the following labels: the beginning of a technological era as irruption, the ascent as frenzy, the rapid build out as synergy and the completion as maturity.\nDemographic theory.\nBecause people have fairly typical spending patterns through their life cycle, such as spending on schooling, marriage, first car purchase, first home purchase, upgrade home purchase, maximum earnings period, maximum retirement savings and retirement, demographic anomalies such as baby booms and busts exert a rather predictable influence on the economy over a long time period. The Easterlin hypothesis deals with the post-war baby-boom. Harry Dent has written extensively on demographics and economic cycles. Tylecote (1991) devoted a chapter to demographics and the long cycle.\nLand speculation.\nGeorgists such as Mason Gaffney, Fred Foldvary and Fred Harrison argue that land speculation is the driving force behind the boom and bust cycle. Land is a finite resource which is necessary for all production and they claim that because exclusive usage rights are traded around, this creates speculative bubbles which can be exacerbated by overzealous borrowing and lending. As early as 1997, a number of Georgists predicted that a depression would occur in 2008.\nDebt deflation.\nDebt deflation is a theory of economic cycles which holds that recessions and depressions are due to the overall level of debt shrinking (deflating). Hence, the credit cycle is the cause of the economic cycle.\nThe theory was developed by Irving Fisher following the Wall Street Crash of 1929 and the ensuing Great Depression. Debt deflation was largely ignored in favor of the ideas of John Maynard Keynes in Keynesian economics, but it has enjoyed a resurgence of interest since the 1980s, both in mainstream economics and in the heterodox school of post-Keynesian economics and has subsequently been developed by such post-Keynesian economists as Hyman Minsky and Steve Keen.\nModern modifications of Kondratiev theory.\nThere are several modern timing versions of the cycle although most are based on either of two causes: one on technology and the other on the credit cycle.\nAdditionally, there are several versions of the technological cycles and they are best interpreted using diffusion curves of leading industries. For example, railways only started in the 1830s, with steady growth for the next 45 years. It was after Bessemer steel was introduced that railroads had their highest growth rates. However, this period is usually labeled the age of steel. Measured by value added, the leading industry in the U.S. from 1880 to 1920 was machinery, followed by iron and steel.\nAny influence of technology during the cycle that began in the Industrial Revolution pertains mainly to England. The U.S. was a commodity producer and was more influenced by agricultural commodity prices. There was a commodity price cycle based on increasing consumption causing tight supplies and rising prices. That allowed new land to the west to be purchased and after four or five years to be cleared and be in production, driving down prices and causing a depression as in 1819 and 1839. By the 1850s, the U.S. was becoming industrialized.\nThe technological cycles can be labeled as follows:\nSome argue that this logic can be extended. The custom of classifying periods of human development by its dominating general purpose technology has surely been borrowed from historians, starting with the Stone Age. Including those, authors distinguish three different long-term metaparadigms, each with different long waves. The first focused on the transformation of material, including stone, bronze, and iron. The second, often referred to as the Industrial Revolution and Second Industrial Revolution, was dedicated to the transformation of energy, including water, steam, electric, and combustion power. Finally, the most recent metaparadigm aims at transforming information. It started out with the proliferation of communication and stored data and has now entered the age of algorithms, which aims at creating automated processes to convert the existing information into actionable knowledge.\nSeveral papers on the relationship between technology and the economy were written by researchers at the International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA). A concise version of Kondratiev cycles can be found in the work of Robert Ayres (1989) in which he gives a historical overview of the relationships of the most significant technologies. Cesare Marchetti published on Kondretiev waves and on the diffusion of innovations. Arnulf Gr\u00fcbler's book (1990) gives a detailed account of the diffusion of infrastructures including canals, railroads, highways and airlines, with findings that the principal infrastructures have midpoints spaced in time corresponding to 55-year K wavelengths, with railroads and highways taking almost a century to complete. Gr\u00fcbler devotes a chapter to the long economic wave. In 1996, Giancarlo Pallavicini published the ratio between the long Kondratiev wave and information technology and communication.\nKorotayev et al. recently employed spectral analysis and claimed that it confirmed the presence of Kondratiev waves in the world GDP dynamics at an acceptable level of statistical significance. Korotayev et al. also detected shorter business cycles, dating the Kuznets to about 17 years and calling it the third harmonic of the Kondratiev, meaning that there are three Kuznets cycles per Kondratiev.\nLeo A. Nefiodow shows that the fifth Kondratieff ended with the global economic crisis of 2000\u20132003 while the new, sixth Kondratieff started simultaneously. According to Leo A. Nefiodow, the carrier of this new long cycle will be health in a holistic sense\u2014including its physical, psychological, mental, social, ecological and spiritual aspects; the basic innovations of the sixth Kondratieff are \"psychosocial health\" and \"biotechnology\".\nMore recently, the physicist and systems scientist Tessaleno Devezas advanced a causal model for the long wave phenomenon based on a generation-learning model and a nonlinear dynamic behaviour of information systems. In both works, a complete theory is presented containing not only the explanation for the existence of K-Waves, but also and for the first time an explanation for the timing of a K-Wave (\u224860 years = two generations).\nA specific modification of the theory of Kondratieff cycles was developed by Daniel \u0160mihula. \u0160mihula identified six long-waves within modern society and the capitalist economy, each of which was initiated by a specific technological revolution:\nUnlike Kondratieff and Schumpeter, \u0160mihula believed that each new cycle is shorter than its predecessor. His main stress is put on technological progress and new technologies as decisive factors of any long-time economic development. Each of these waves has its innovation phase which is described as a technological revolution and an application phase in which the number of revolutionary innovations falls and attention focuses on exploiting and extending existing innovations. As soon as an innovation or a series of innovations becomes available, it becomes more efficient to invest in its adoption, extension and use than in creating new innovations. Each wave of technological innovations can be characterized by the area in which the most revolutionary changes took place (\"leading sectors\").\nEvery wave of innovations lasts approximately until the profits from the new innovation or sector fall to the level of other, older, more traditional sectors. It is a situation when the new technology, which originally increased a capacity to utilize new sources from nature, reached its limits and it is not possible to overcome this limit without an application of another new technology.\nAt the end of an application phase of any wave there is typically an economic crisis and economic stagnation. The 2008 financial crisis is a result of the coming end of the \"wave of the Information and telecommunications technological revolution\". Some authors have started to predict what the sixth wave might be, such as James Bradfield Moody and Bianca Nogrady who forecast that it will be driven by resource efficiency and clean technology. On the other hand, \u0160mihula himself considers the waves of technological innovations during the modern age (after 1600 AD) only as a part of a much longer \"chain\" of technological revolutions going back to the pre-modern era. It means he believes that we can find long economic cycles (analogical to Kondratiev cycles in modern economy) dependent on technological revolutions even in the Middle Ages and the Ancient era.\nCriticism of Kondratiev theory.\nLong wave theory is not accepted by many academic economists. However, it is important for innovation-based, development and evolutionary economics. Yet, among economists who accept it, there has been no formal universal agreement about the standards that should be used universally to place the start and end years for each wave. Agreement of start and end years can be +1 to 3 years for each 40- to 65-year cycle.\nHealth economist and biostatistician Andreas J. W. Goldschmidt searched for patterns and proposed that there is a phase shift and overlap of the so-called Kondratiev cycles of IT and health (shown in the figure). He argued that historical growth phases in combination with key technologies do not necessarily imply the existence of regular cycles in general. Goldschmidt is of the opinion that different fundamental innovations and their economic stimuli do not exclude each other as they mostly vary in length and their benefit is not applicable to all participants in a market.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

She is a patron of the Julia Margaret Cameron Trust, which runs the museum of the Victorian pioneer photographer.\nEarly life and education.\nStark was born in New York. Her parents were Wilbur Stark, a writer and producer, and Kathi Norris, a writer and television presenter in New York City. She is the youngest of three children. At the time of her birth, the family lived in Manhattan. Her grandfather, Edwin Earl Norris, was a cabinetmaker and musician, playing horn and viola in the Newark Symphony Orchestra. Her mother's family were Presbyterians. After a divorce in the 1960s, her mother remarried.\nKoo Stark attended the Hewitt School in New York and the Glendower Preparatory School in Kensington, London. After training at a stage school, she began her acting career.\nCareer.\nActing.\nHer first film role was in the comedy \"All I Want Is You... and You... and You...\" (1974), produced by her father. In 1975 she appeared in \"Las adolescentes\" (The Adolescents), opposite Anthony Andrews, and starred in an episode of \"Shades of Greene\".\nAlso that year she had an uncredited role as a bridesmaid in \"The Rocky Horror Picture Show\". Her best-remembered performance is the lead role in the erotic film \"Emily\" (1976), directed by Henry Herbert, 17th Earl of Pembroke. Uncertain whether to accept the part, Stark did so on the advice of Graham Greene, with whom she had worked the year before. Of working with her in \"Emily\", actor Victor Spinetti later wrote \"I found Koo Stark to be an enchanting girl and terribly bright and interesting\".\nShe also appeared in \"Cruel Passion\" (1977), a film based on the novel \"Justine\". Around the same time, she played the part of Camie Marstrap in \"Star Wars\" (1977); the scenes in which she appeared were cut from the film before its original release, but can be seen in \"\" (1998).\nStark also began to work as a fashion model, particularly for Norman Parkinson. In February 1981, she was an understudy in the Edward Albee play \"Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?\" at the National Theatre.\nShe appeared in the comedy \"Eat the Rich\" (1987), and then featured in \"Timeslides\", an episode of the sci-fi show \"Red Dwarf\" (1989), playing Lady Sabrina Mulholland-Jjones, the fianc\u00e9e of a more successful Dave Lister. \nIn September 1987, she returned to the stage, taking the part of Vera Claythorne in Agatha Christie's \"And Then There Were None\" at the Duke of York's Theatre. The \"London Theatre Record\" posed the question \"Why has a girl so obviously three-dimensional chosen a part so obviously two-dimensional?\" She played Miss Scarlett in the 1991 series of \"Cluedo\", succeeding Toyah Willcox and befriending Rula Lenska.\nPhotography.\nStark has worked as a photographer since the 1980s, and may have been the first person to turn the tables on the pursuing paparazzi by taking photos of them. Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor has told how in 1983 a photographic printer, Gene Nocon, invited Stark to take photographs of people taking photos of her, for his exhibition, \"Personal Points of View\", planned for October. She persuaded Nocon to include Andrew's work as well. Her early photographs led to a book deal, for which she took lessons from Norman Parkinson. She travelled to Tobago, where he lived, and he became her mentor. Her book \"Contrasts\" (1985) included about a hundred of her photographs. She went on to study the work of leading photographers, including Angus McBean, whom she met and photographed, developing her interests in photography to include reportage, portraits, landscapes, still life, and other work.\nThe book \"Contrasts\" was launched at Hamiltons Gallery, London, in September 1985, at an exhibition of the same name. In 1994, the Gallery Bar at the Grosvenor House Hotel in Park Lane hosted an exhibition called 'The Stark Image', forty photographs by Stark, including several previously unpublished. In 1998, her work was featured at the Como Lario in Holbein Place, Belgravia. In July 2001 she had an exhibition called 'Stark Images\" at the Fruitmarket Gallery in Edinburgh, duplicated from June to July 2001 at Dimbola Lodge on the Isle of Wight. A solo exhibition of portraits was at the Winter Gardens, Ventnor, from September to October 2010, and another at Dimbola Lodge from February to April 2011.\nOn 22 April 1987, a charity auction at Christie's, St James's, for the Campaign to Protect Rural England, featured signed work by David Bailey, Patrick Lichfield, Don McCullin, Terence Donovan, Fay Godwin, Heather Angel, Clive Arrowsmith, Linda McCartney, Koo Stark, and fifteen others, Views by Stark, including some of Kirby Muxloe Castle, were in G. H. Davies's \"England's Glory\" (1987), a CPRE book launched at the same time.\nPictures by Stark have appeared in \"Country Life\" and other magazines. Several of her portraits are in the National Portrait Gallery, and work is also in the collections of the Victoria and Albert Museum, both in London.\nA Leica user, Stark has said her camera transcends mere function and is a personal friend. A solo exhibition hosted by the Leica gallery in Mayfair in May 2017 was entitled \"Kintsugi\", a Japanese word for a way of renovating things that have been broken. Stark explained the title: \"Kintsugi is a way of learning to see individual beauty, and to appreciate the value of experience and honesty. It is the antithesis of digital, airbrushed, Photoshop-homogenised 'beauty'.\" In August the exhibition was repeated in Manchester, to mark the opening of a new Leica store there.\nPersonal life.\nStark has been a practising Buddhist since meeting the Dalai Lama. She continues to live in London and is a member of the Chelsea Arts Club. She is a Patron of the Julia Margaret Cameron Trust, at Dimbola Lodge on the Isle of Wight, home of the Victorian pioneer photographer Julia Margaret Cameron.\nRelationships.\nStark met the then Prince Andrew (later known as Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor) in February 1981, and they were close for some two years, before and after his active service in the Falklands War. Tina Brown has claimed that this was Mountbatten-Windsor's only serious love affair. In October 1982 they took a holiday together on the island of Mustique. According to Lady Colin Campbell, Mountbatten-Windsor was in love, and the Queen was \"much taken with the elegant, intelligent, and discreet Koo\". However, in 1983, after 18 months of dating, they split up under pressure from the Queen. In 1997, Mountbatten-Windsor became the godfather of Stark's daughter, and in 2015, when he was accused by Virginia Roberts over the Jeffrey Epstein connection, Stark came to his defence, stating that he was a good man and she could help to rebut the claims.\nStark married Tim Jeffries, manager of a photographic gallery, in August 1984, at St Saviour's, Chalk Farm, with the minister, Christopher Neil-Smith, commenting that \"It was such a quiet affair you wouldn't have known it was happening.\" They stayed together for a year, later divorcing.\nShe was later engaged to Warren Walker, an American banker, but he cancelled their wedding before the birth of their daughter, Tatiana, in May 1997.\nLegal cases.\nIn 1988, Stark brought a successful libel action against \"The Mail on Sunday\" over an untrue story headed 'Koo dated Andy after she wed'. In 1989, \"The Spectator\" reported that she had received \u00a3300,000 from one newspaper \"for years of inaccurate persecution\" and was also collecting money from others.\nIn another libel action in 2007, Stark won an apology and substantial damages from \"Zoo Weekly\" magazine, which had described her as a porn star. She commented \"I am relieved that my name has been cleared of this false, highly damaging and serious allegation which has been proved to be completely untrue.\" In 2011 \"The Daily Telegraph\" called her an early \"Kate Middleton prototype\" and suggested that if she had not appeared in the film \"Emily\" early in her career she might have gone on to become the Duchess of York.\nIn November 2012, Stark appeared at Hammersmith magistrates court accused of stealing a painting by Dutch master Anthonie van Borssom, worth \u00a340,000, from the home of her ex-partner, American financier Warren Walker. She strenuously denied the allegation. Before the matter came to trial, the painting was returned to Walker and by agreement the prosecution was abandoned.\nIn November 2022, Stark was awarded substantial damages and received an apology in a court case brought against \"Daily Mail\"'s parent company for a 2019 article which falsely referred to her as \"a soft porn actress\".\nHealth.\nAbout 1993, Stark was hit by a taxi in Old Compton Street, London, losing two teeth and also suffering a deep wound to her forehead, after a collision with her camera. This accident left her temporarily disfigured, but the wound eventually healed leaving a small scar just under the hair-line.\nIn 2002 Stark was diagnosed with breast cancer and underwent a double mastectomy and chemotherapy, causing her to lose her hair for a time.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He was one of the original five Marshals of the Soviet Union, the second highest military rank of the Soviet Union (junior to the Generalissimo of the Soviet Union, which was a post only held by Joseph Stalin), and served as Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet, the nominal Soviet head of state, from 1953 to 1960.\nBorn to a Russian worker's family in Ukraine, Voroshilov took part in the Russian Revolution of 1917 as an early member of the Bolsheviks. He served with distinction at the Battle of Tsaritsyn, during which he became a close friend of Stalin. Voroshilov was elected to the Central Committee of the Communist Party in 1921, and in 1925 Stalin appointed him People's Commissar for Military and Navy Affairs (later People's Commissar for Defence). In 1926, he became a full member of the Politburo. In 1935, Voroshilov was named a Marshal of the Soviet Union.\nAt the outbreak of World War II, Voroshilov was held responsible for Soviet failures in Finland during the Winter War and was replaced as Defense Commissar by Semyon Timoshenko. Following the German invasion in June 1941, he was recalled and appointed to the State Defense Committee. Voroshilov failed to stop the German encirclement of Leningrad and was again relieved from his command in September 1941.\nAfter the war, Voroshilov oversaw the establishment of a socialist regime in Hungary. Following Stalin's death in 1953, Voroshilov was appointed Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet. His fortunes declined during the rise of Nikita Khrushchev and the Supreme Soviet turned against him. He peacefully resigned in 1960, although he came out of retirement in 1966 and re-joined the party. Voroshilov died in 1969 at the age of 88.\nEarly life.\nVoroshilov was born in the settlement of Verkhnyeye, Bakhmut uyezd, Yekaterinoslav Governorate, Russian Empire (now part of Lysychansk city in Luhansk Oblast, Ukraine). His father, a former soldier, was employed at different times as a railway worker or miner, and went through periods of unemployment. According to the Soviet Major General Petro Grigorenko, Voroshilov himself alluded to the heritage of his birth-country (Ukraine) and to the previous family name of \"Voroshylo\".\nIn his published autobiography, Voroshilov described a childhood of extreme hardship, working from the age of six or seven, and receiving frequent beatings from wealthy peasants, which left him with a lifelong aversion to 'kulaks'. He grew up illiterate, until he was able to enroll in a newly opened school in a nearby village, at the age of 12, and received two years' schooling. During his school years, Voroshilov became a close friend and almost a member of the family of Semyon Ryzhkov.\nIn 1896, he started work in a factory near his home village, where he led a strike in 1899. In 1903, he enrolled in a German owned factory in Luhansk (which was renamed Voroshilov during the Stalin era). There, he joined the Bolsheviks, and acted as a strike leader during the 1905 revolution. In April 1906, he travelled to Stockholm for the Fourth Congress of the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party (RSDLP), using the provocative pseudonym 'Volodya Antimekov' or Anti-Menshevik. In Stockholm, he shared a room with the delegate from Georgia, Josif Dzhugashvili, later known as Stalin.\nIn spring 1907, he travelled to London for the Fifth RSDLP Congress. On his return, he was arrested and deported to Arkhangelsk, but in December he escaped and moved to Baku, where Stalin was also active. Arrested again in 1908, he was released from exile in 1912, and for a time worked in an ordnance factory in Tsaritsyn (Stalingrad/Volgagrad).\nRussian Revolution and Civil War.\nVoroshilov was in Petrograd (St Petersburg) during the February Revolution, but returned to Luhansk, where he was chairman of the town soviet, and was elected to the Constituent Assembly. His military career began early in 1918, when he was given command of the Fifth Ukrainian Army, which was made up of a few scattered units, who were driven out of Ukraine by the German army. After a long, hazardous retreat, his group reached Tsaritsyn, where Stalin was posted in summer 1918 as representative of the central party leadership, and where Voroshilov was given command of the Tenth Army. Stalin and Voroshilov led the Red Army's 1918 defense of Tsaritsyn. They also sponsored the creation of the first Red Cavalry unit, commanded by Semyon Budyonny, which was composed chiefly of peasants from southern Russia. In Tsaritsyn, Voroshilov clashed with Leon Trotsky, the People's Commissar for War, who considered him undisciplined and unfit to command an army, and in October 1918 threatened him with court martial. Voroshilov was transferred to Ukraine, as commander of the Kharkiv military district, and later People's Commissar for War in the Ukraine soviet republic. He sided with the 'Military Opposition', who opposed the formation of a centralised army, preferring to rely on local mobile units, and objected to the recruitment into the Red Army of former officers from the Tsarist army. Later, during the Polish\u2013Soviet War, Voroshilov was political commissar with Budienny's First Cavalry.\nI\nInterwar period.\nVoroshilov served as a member of the Central Committee from his election in 1921 until 1961. In April 1921, he was appointed commander of the North Caucasus military district. In March 1924, he was promoted to the post of commander of the Moscow military district. In 1925, after the death of Mikhail Frunze, Voroshilov was appointed People's Commissar for Military and Navy Affairs and Chairman of the Revolutionary Military Council of the USSR, a post he held until 1934. Despite the high offices he held, Voroshilov appears not to have been part in the inner leadership. In November 1930, the chairman of the Russian government, Sergey Syrtsov, alleged that a \"tiny group\", which excluded Voroshilov but included nominally much less senior figures such as Pavel Postyshev, was making decisions \"behind the back of the Politburo\".\nHis main accomplishment in this period was to move key Soviet war industries east of the Urals, so that the Soviet Union could strategically retreat, while keeping its manufacturing capability intact. Frunze's political position adhered to that of the Troika (Grigory Zinoviev, Lev Kamenev, Stalin), but Stalin preferred to have a close, personal ally in charge (as opposed to Frunze, a \"Zinovievite\"). Frunze was urged by a group of Stalin's hand-picked doctors to have surgery to treat an old stomach ulcer, despite previous doctors' recommendations to avoid surgery and Frunze's own unwillingness. He died on the operating table of a massive overdose of chloroform, an anaesthetic. Voroshilov became a full member of the newly formed Politburo in 1926, remaining a member until 1960.\nVoroshilov was appointed People's Commissar (Minister) for Defence in 1934 and a Marshal of the Soviet Union in 1935.\nThe Great Purge.\nDuring the first of the Moscow trials, in August 1936, Voroshilov was one of four Politburo members who signed the order that appeals for clemency were to be denied and that the defendants were to be executed without delay. He was also of the main speakers at the March 1937 plenum of the Central Committee, which ended with the arrests of Nikolai Bukharin and Alexei Rykov, whom Voroshilov denounced as \"renegades\".\nIn the early stages, he seemed to have believed that the purge would not affect the armed forces, and was seemingly unprepared for the arrest of Marshal Tukhachevsky and others in April and May. Voroshilov did not personally share the paranoia towards upper-class elements of the officer corps. He openly declared that the saboteurs in the Red Army were few in number and tried to save the lives of officers like , who would serve with distinction during the Second World War, and Sokolov-Strakhov, and he was sometimes successful. But on 30 May, he telephoned the commander of the Ukraine military district, Iona Yakir, ordering him to take a train to Moscow for a meeting of the Military Revolutionary Council, knowing that he would be arrested on the way. When the Council met on 1 June 1937, Voroshilov vacated the chair to deliver a report in which he said, apologetically: \"I could not believe we would reveal so many and such scoundrels in the ranks of the highest command of our glorious, our valiant Workers' and Peasants' Army.\"\nAfter that, he played a central role in Stalin's Great Purge of the 1930s, denouncing many of his own military colleagues and subordinates when asked to do so by Stalin. He wrote personal letters to exiled former Soviet officers and diplomats such as commissar Mikhail Ostrovsky, asking them to return voluntarily to the Soviet Union and falsely reassuring them that they would not face retribution from authorities. Voroshilov personally signed 185 documented execution lists, fourth among the Soviet leadership after Molotov, Stalin and Kaganovich. He had no problem denouncing officers he disliked such as Tukhachevsky.\nDespite taking part in the purging of many \"mechanisers\" (supporters of wide usage of tanks rather than cavalry) from the Red Army, Voroshilov became convinced that reliance on cavalry should be decreased while more modern arms should receive higher priority. Marshal Budyonny tried to recruit him to his cause of protecting the status of cavalry in the Red Army but Voroshilov openly declared his intention to do the opposite. He praised the army's combined arms warfare capabilities as well as the high quality and ability to take initiative of the officers during the 1936 summer manoeuvers. However he also pointed out issues in the Red Army as a whole in his full report. Among the issues he pointed out were insufficient communication, ineffective staffs, insufficient cooperation between arms, and the rudimentary nature of the command structure in tank units and other modern arms.\nWhen the Great Purge ended, some reforms were undertaken by the high command to reconcile Red Army doctrine (for example deep operations doctrine) with the real state of the Red Army. The politically appointed commanders of the post-purge Red Army saw that the army, especially after the purge, was not suitable to carry out deep operations style warfare. Commanders such as Voroshilov and Kulik were among the instigators of these reforms which positively impacted the Red Army. These commanders themselves turned out not to be able to carry out such operations in practice. Voroshilov and Kulik turned out to be unable to put these reforms into practice. One of these reforms was a reorganization of Red Army field units which accidentally moved Red Army organization to a far less advanced state than it had been in 1936. This reorganization was conceived by Kulik but put into practice by Voroshilov.\nWhen territorial units were abolished Voroshilov noted that among the reasons for disbanding them was inability to train conscripts in the use of modern technology. He had openly proclaimed that the system was inadequate in an era in which imperialist powers (such as Germany) were expanding the capabilities of their armies. The territorial units had been very unpopular, not only with Voroshilov, but with the Red Army leadership a whole. They were hopelessly ineffective: territorial conscript Alexey Grigorovich Maslov noted that he never fired a shot during his training, while it was noted that these units only underwent real training in the one month a year when experienced veterans returned.\nWorld War II.\nVoroshilov commanded Soviet troops during the Winter War from November 1939 to January 1940 but, due to poor Soviet planning and Voroshilov's incompetence as a general, the Red Army suffered about 320,000 casualties compared to 70,000 Finnish casualties. When the leadership gathered at Stalin's dacha at Kuntsevo, Stalin shouted at Voroshilov for the losses; Voroshilov replied in kind, blaming the failure on Stalin for eliminating the Red Army's best generals in his purges. Voroshilov followed this retort by smashing a platter of food on the table. Nikita Khrushchev said it was the only time he ever witnessed such an outburst. Voroshilov was nonetheless made the scapegoat for the initial failures in Finland. He was later replaced as Defense Commissar by Semyon Timoshenko. Voroshilov was then made Deputy Premier responsible for cultural matters.\nVoroshilov initially argued that thousands of Polish army officers captured in September 1939 should be released, but he later signed the order for their execution in the Katyn massacre of 1940.\nBetween 1941 and 1944, Voroshilov was a member of the State Defense Committee.\nAfter the German invasion of the Soviet Union in June 1941, Voroshilov became commander of the short-lived Northwestern Direction (July to August 1941), controlling several fronts. In September 1941 he commanded the Leningrad Front. Working alongside military commander Andrei Zhdanov as German advances threatened to cut off Leningrad, he displayed considerable personal bravery in defiance of heavy shelling at Ivanovskoye; at one point he rallied retreating troops and personally led a counter-attack against German tanks armed only with a pistol. However, the style of counterattack he launched had long since been abandoned by strategists and drew mostly contempt from his military colleagues; he failed to prevent the Germans from surrounding Leningrad and he was dismissed from his post and replaced by Georgy Zhukov on 8 September 1941. Stalin had a political need for popular wartime leaders, however, and Voroshilov remained as an important figurehead.\nPost war.\nHungary.\nBetween 1945 and 1947, Voroshilov supervised the establishment of the socialist republic in postwar Hungary. He attributed the poor showing of the Hungarian Communist Party in the October 1945 Budapest municipal elections to the number of minorities in leadership positions, arguing that it was \"detrimental to the party that its leaders are not of Hungarian origin\".\n1952\u20131953 Soviet leadership.\nIn 1952, Voroshilov was appointed a member of the Presidium of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union.\nStalin's death on 5 March 1953 prompted major changes in the Soviet leadership. On 15 March 1953, Voroshilov was approved as Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet (i.e., the head of state) with Nikita Khrushchev as First Secretary of the Communist Party and Georgy Malenkov as Premier of the Soviet Union. Voroshilov, Malenkov, and Khrushchev brought about the 26 June 1953 arrest of Lavrenty Beria after Stalin's death.\nOne of Voroshilov's responsibilities as chairman of the Presidium was to oversee the appeal review of Soviet death row inmates. Analysis by Jeffrey S. Hardy and Yana Skorobogatov describe his role thus:\n\"Chairman Voroshilov presided over the meetings and clearly had the most influential voice, but split votes were not uncommon and Voroshilov was sometimes outvoted... Throughout his tenure as Presidium chair, he behaved like someone who believed that one should follow established procedure and not act too quickly in matters of life and death.\"\nHardy and Skorobogatov indicate that Voroshilov frequently exerted his influence on the committee toward leniency, especially in the case of those who expressed repentance in their appeal documents and those convicted of crimes of passion or under the influence of alcohol; he judged those convicted of political crimes or acts with financial motives more harshly. During his tenure, many individuals sentenced to death had their punishments commuted to prison terms of varying lengths. The authors of the study observe that his successor, Brezhnev, took a noticeably harder line in appeals cases.\nHowever, the contrast between Voroshilov's relatively magnanimous attitude toward pardon cases in the 1950s with his well-documented participation in the deadly purges of the 1930s (as described above) was noted even at the time by Khrushchev, who asked him, \"So when were you acting according to your conscience, then or now?\"\nFall from grace.\nAfter Khrushchev removed most of the Stalinists like Molotov and Malenkov from the party, Voroshilov's career began to fade. On 7 May 1960, the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union granted Voroshilov's request for retirement and elected Leonid Brezhnev chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Council (the head of state). The Central Committee also relieved him of duties as a member of the Party Presidium (as the Politburo had been called since 1952) on 16 July 1960. In October 1961, his political defeat was complete at the 22nd party congress when he was excluded from election to the Central Committee.\nFollowing Khrushchev's fall from power, Soviet leader Brezhnev brought Voroshilov out of retirement into a figurehead political post. Voroshilov was again re-elected to the Central Committee in 1966. Voroshilov was awarded a second medal of Hero of the Soviet Union 1968.\nDeath.\nDuring a winter night in 1969, Voroshilov started to feel unwell. His family proposed to call an ambulance immediately, but he adamantly refused. In the morning he put on his military uniform, and after calling a car, he went to the hospital himself, fully decorated. Voroshilov died on 2 December, at the age of 88, and was buried in the Kremlin Wall Necropolis, in one of the twelve individual tombs located between the Lenin Mausoleum and the Kremlin wall.\nPersonal life.\nVoroshilov was married to Ekaterina Voroshilova, born Golda Gorbman, a Ukrainian Jew from Mardarovka. She changed her name when she converted to Orthodox Christianity in order to be allowed to marry Voroshilov. They met while both were exiled in Arkhangelsk, where Ekaterina was sent in 1906. While both serving on the Tsaritsyn Front in 1918, where Ekaterina was helping orphans, they adopted a four-year-old orphan boy who they named Petya. They also adopted the children of Mikhail Frunze following his death in 1925. During Stalin's rule, they lived in the Kremlin at the Horse Guards.\nHis personality as it was described by Molotov in 1974: \"Voroshilov was nice, but only in certain times. He always stood for the political line of the party, because he was from a working class, a common man, very good orator. He was clean, yes. And he was personally devoted to Stalin. But his devotion was not very strong. However in this period he advocated Stalin very actively, supported him in everything, though not entirely sure in everything. It also affected their relationship. This is a very complex issue. This must be taken into account to understand why Stalin treated him critically and not invited him at all our conversations. At least at private ones. But he came by himself. Stalin frowned. Under Khrushchev, Voroshilov behaved badly.\"\nHonours and awards.\nSoviet Union.\nThe Kliment Voroshilov (KV) series of tanks, used in World War II, was named after him. Two towns were also named after him: Voroshilovsk in Donbas (now Alchevsk) Voroshilovgrad in Ukraine (now changed back to the historical Luhansk) and Voroshilov in the Soviet Far East (now renamed Ussuriysk after the Ussuri river), as well as the General Staff Academy in Moscow. Stavropol was called Voroshilovsk from 1935 to 1943.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

A former competitor in women's singles, Yamaguchi is the 1992 Olympic champion, a two-time World champion (1991 and 1992), and the 1992 U.S. champion. In 1992, she became the first Asian American to win a gold medal in a Winter Olympic competition. As a pairs skater with Rudy Galindo, she is the 1988 World Junior champion and a two-time national champion (1989 and 1990).\nAfter Yamaguchi retired from competition in 1992, she performed in shows and participated in the professional competition circuit. She won the World Professional Figure Skating Championships four times in her career (1992, 1994, 1996 and 1997). In 2005, Yamaguchi was inducted into the U.S. Olympic Hall of Fame, and in 2008, she became the celebrity champion in the sixth season of \"Dancing with the Stars\".\nYamaguchi is an author and has published five books. \"Dream Big, Little Pig!,\" for which she received the Gelett Burgess Children's Book Award, appeared on \"The New York Times\" Best Seller list.\nEarly life.\nYamaguchi was born on July 12, 1971, in Hayward, California, to Jim Yamaguchi, a dentist, and Carole (n\u00e9e Doi), a medical secretary. Yamaguchi is Sansei (a third-generation descendant of Japanese emigrants). Her paternal grandparents and maternal great-grandparents emigrated to the United States from Japan, originating from Wakayama Prefecture and Saga Prefecture. Yamaguchi's grandparents were sent to an internment camp during World War II, where her mother was born. Her maternal grandfather, George A. Doi, was in the U.S. Army and fought in Germany and France during World War II during the time his family was interned at the Heart Mountain and Amache camps. Research done in 2010 by Harvard Professor Henry Louis Gates Jr. for the PBS series \"Faces of America\" showed that Yamaguchi's heritage can be traced back to Wakayama and Saga prefectures in Japan and that her paternal grandfather, Tatsuichi Yamaguchi, emigrated to Hawaii in 1899.\nYamaguchi and her siblings, Brett and Lori, grew up in Fremont, California. In order to accommodate her training schedule, Yamaguchi was home-schooled for her first two years of high school, but attended Mission San Jose High School for her junior and senior years, where she graduated.\nCompetitive skating career.\nEarly career.\nYamaguchi was born with bi-lateral clubfoot, resulting in serial leg casting for most of the first year of her life followed by corrective shoes and bracing, and began skating as physical therapy when she was 4 or 5 after seeing Peggy Fleming and Dorothy Hamill in the Ice Follies and Ice Capades.\nFrom sixth grade on, Yamaguchi practiced from 5 a.m. to 10 a.m. before school and sometimes after school. Her mother would drive her to the rink every morning at 4 a.m. and wait for her to finish. She would also accompany Yamaguchi to competitions a couple of times a month.\nPairs career.\nIn 1986, Yamaguchi won the junior title at the U.S. championships with Rudy Galindo. Two years later, Yamaguchi won the singles and, with Galindo, the pairs titles at the 1988 World Junior Championships; Galindo had won the 1987 World Junior Championship in singles. In 1989 Yamaguchi and Galindo won the senior pairs title at the U.S. Championships. They won the title again in 1990.\nAs a pairs team, Yamaguchi and Galindo were unusual in that they were both accomplished singles skaters, which allowed them to consistently perform difficult elements like side by side triple flip jumps, which even twenty years later it would still be considered a very difficult pair element. They also jumped and spun in opposite directions, Yamaguchi counter-clockwise, and Galindo clockwise, which gave them an unusual look on the ice. In 1990, Yamaguchi decided to focus solely on singles. Galindo went on to have a successful singles career as well, winning the 1996 U.S. championships and the 1996 World bronze medal.\nSingles career.\n1989\u201390 season: Goodwill Games gold.\nYamaguchi won her first major international gold medal in figure skating at the 1990 Goodwill Games.\n1990\u201391 season: First world title.\nIn 1991, Yamaguchi moved to Edmonton, Alberta, to train with coach Christy Ness. There, she took psychology courses at the University of Alberta. The same year, Yamaguchi placed second to Tonya Harding at the U.S. championships, her third consecutive silver medal at Nationals, with a free skate that included a fall on a triple Salchow but also six clean triple jumps. The following month in Munich, Germany, Yamaguchi won the 1991 World Championships. That year, the American ladies team, consisting of Yamaguchi, Harding and Nancy Kerrigan, became the only national ladies team to have its members sweep the Worlds podium until the 2021 World Figure Skating Championships, when Anna Shcherbakova, Elizaveta Tuktamysheva and Alexandra Trusova swept the podium representing FSR.\n1991\u201392 season: Olympic gold and second world title.\nIn 1992, Yamaguchi won her first U.S. title and gained a spot to the 1992 Winter Olympics in Albertville, France. Joining her on the U.S. team were again Kerrigan and Harding. While Harding and Japan's Midori Ito were consistently landing the difficult triple Axel jump in competition, Yamaguchi instead focused on her artistry and her triple-triple combinations in hopes of becoming a more well-rounded skater. Both Harding and Ito fell on their triple Axels at the Olympics (though Ito successfully landed the jump later on in her long program after missing the first time), allowing Yamaguchi to win the gold, despite errors in her free program, including putting a hand to the ice on a triple loop and a double salchow instead of a planned triple. She later explained her mindset during the long program: \"You just do your best and forget the rest.\" Yamaguchi went on to successfully defend her World title that same year.\nProfessional skating career.\nYamaguchi planned to start the 1992-93 competitive season at Prague Skate in Czechoslovakia in November but U.S Figure Skating insisted that all its skaters compete at Skate America, which was due to take place a month earlier in October. Skate America became a source of contention between the federation and Yamaguchi, who was unable to be ready in time due to a busy schedule with commercial appearances and speaking engagements following her wins at the 1992 Winter Olympics and 1992 World Championships. As a result, Yamaguchi decided to turn professional after the 1991\u201392 competitive season and immediately started competing on the pro competition circuit, starting with the World Professional Figure Skating Championships in December 1992 where she captured her first world pro gold. By the time she stopped competing as a professional, she had become a four-time professional world champion (1992, 1994, 1996 and 1997). She finished second in 1993 behind Midori Ito and in 1995 behind Yuka Sato.\nShe toured extensively with Stars On Ice for over a decade. Originally, Stars On Ice was a 30-city tour, but when Yamaguchi joined, it quickly became a 60-city tour due to her ability to captivate an audience. She collaborated with a variety of choreographers to create diverse programs. \"A lot of us on the Stars on Ice tour took pride in trying to stay innovative and bring something new to the ice every year,\" Yamaguchi noted.\nPublic life and popular culture.\nSponsorships, endorsements and partnerships.\nIn the ensuing months and years after she stood atop the podium in Albertville in 1992, Yamaguchi showed up on cereal boxes like Kellogg's Special K, on Hallmark Christmas ornaments, in ads for Got Milk? and Hoechst Celanese, as well as commercials for brands, fast food chains and department store chains like Mervyn's, Wendy's, DuraSoft and Entenmann's doughnuts. She was also featured in ads for Campbell Soup, a sponsor of U.S. Figure Skating at the time. In 2010, Yamaguchi was engaged by P&amp;G to help kick off its \"Thanks Mom\" program in connection with the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver. She also collaborated with OPI and General Electric in 2011 and appeared in a TV spot for department store retail chain Kohl's in 2012. In 2018, Yamaguchi worked with the Milk Life Campaign that aims to explain the significance of milk in a well-balanced, nutritious diet. As part of the campaign, Yamaguchi recreated her \"Got Milk?\" ad from the 1990s and was photographed by Annie Leibowitz.\nMattel unveiled a new Barbie doll based on Yamaguchi in April 2024. The Yamaguchi Barbie doll is dressed in a detailed replication of Yamaguchi's gold and black costume from the 1992 Winter Olympics in Albertville. Yamaguchi has been represented by IMG since 1992.\nTelevision.\nYamaguchi made a public service video with the California Raisins in 1993 called \"Hip to be Fit: Starring Kristi Yamaguchi and The California Raisins.\" She has appeared as herself on shows like \"Everybody Loves Raymond, Fresh Off the Boat,\" \"Hell's Kitchen and Freedom: A History of US\" as well as in films like \"\", \"Frosted Pink\", and the Disney Channel original movie \"Go Figure\". In 2006, Yamaguchi was the host of WE tv series \"Skating's Next Star\", created and produced by Major League Figure Skating. Yamaguchi was a local commentator on figure skating for San Jose TV station KNTV (NBC 11) during the 2006 Winter Olympics. In 2010, Yamaguchi worked as a daily NBC Olympics skating broadcast analyst on NBC's Universal Sports Network. During the 2010 Winter Olympics, Yamaguchi was also a special correspondent for the \"Today Show\".\nShe performed in numerous television skating specials, including the Disney special \"Aladdin on Ice\", in which she played Princess Jasmine, and in 2016 she hosted the \"Colgate Skating Series\" on ABC, a show featuring skaters such as Nancy Kerrigan, Paul Wylie, and Todd Eldridge, who performed with their families. In 2023, Yamaguchi made an appearance in Carolyn Taylor's documentary comedy series \"I Have Nothing\" that follows Taylor's comical quest to choreograph a pairs skating routine set to Whitney Houston's 1993 hit song \"I Have Nothing.\"\nOn May 20, 2008, Yamaguchi became the champion of the sixth season of ABC's \"Dancing with the Stars,\" where she was paired with Mark Ballas. Yamaguchi became the first female winner since Kelly Monaco in season 1. Yamaguchi made a special appearance in the finale of the 16th season where she danced alongside Dorothy Hamill, and in November 2017, she returned to the 25th season in week eight to participate in a jazz trio with Lindsey Stirling and Mark Ballas.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBooks and magazines.\nYamaguchi authored five books. She released \"Figure Skating for Dummies\" in 1997 followed by \"Always Dream\", \"Pure Gold\" in 1998. In 2011, she published her award-winning children's book, \"Dream Big, Little Pig\", which was No. 2 on the \"New York Times\" bestseller list and received the Gelett Burgess Children's Book Award. A portion of the proceeds went to the Always Dream Foundation to support early childhood literacy programs. A sequel, \"It's a Big World Little Pig\", was published March 6, 2012. \"Cara's Kindness\", which was illustrated by Pixar artist John Lee, was released in 2016.\nThroughout the years, Yamaguchi has graced the covers of \"Sports Illustrated\", \"People\", and other magazines.\nFashion.\nIn early 2012, Yamaguchi created a woman's active wear line focused on function, comfort, and style to empower women to look good and feel good. The lifestyle brand is called Tsu.ya by Kristi Yamaguchi. \"[Tsu.ya] is actually my middle name, and it was my grand-mother's name [and] a nod to my Japanese heritage. We put the period in there because we thought it would break it up and make it easier to pronounce,\" remarked Yamaguchi. Tsu.ya donates a portion of its proceeds to support early childhood literacy through Yamaguchi's Always Dream Foundation.\nIn February 2009, Kristi walked the runway with nineteen other celebrity women at the Heart Truth fashion show that took place during New York Fashion Week to raise awareness about heart disease. The Heart Truth, a national health education program, created and introduced the Red Dress as the national symbol for women and heart disease awareness in 2002, and a selection of the red designer dresses seen on the runway were later auctioned off.\nPhilanthropy and supported causes.\nIn 1996, Yamaguchi established the Always Dream Foundation for children. The goal of the foundation is to provide funding for after school programs, computers, back-to-school clothes for underprivileged children, and summer camps for kids with disabilities. Commenting in 2009, she explained her inspiration for the project: \"I was inspired by the Make-A-Wish Foundation to make a positive difference in children's lives. We've been helping out various children's organizations, which is rewarding. Our latest project is a playground designed so that kids of all abilities can play side by side. That's our focus now.\" In 2011, Yamaguchi worked with the American Lung Association, promoting their \"Faces of Influenza\" campaign.\nAlso in 2011, Kristi and the Always Dream Foundation Board decided to narrow the foundation's focus to early childhood literacy. This change was inspired by Kristi's role as a mother of two young daughters, as well as her new venture as a children's book author. In 2012, the foundation forged a partnership with Raising A Reader and the digital children's library myON, to create the Always Reading program, which integrated traditional books with e-books and 21st century technology in both the classroom and home environment. Between 2012 and 2018, the Always Reading program served more than 10,000 students and families at 24 Title 1 schools in California, Hawai\u02bbi, and Arizona.\nIn 2018, after two years of assessment and evaluation, the Always Dream Foundation worked with an expert team of education advisors to redesign the Always Reading program with the goal of targeting the home environment and supporting family engagement in reading. The Always Reading pilot program was implemented in two classrooms in Oakland, CA.\nIn 2020, Always Dream dropped the name \"Foundation\" to reflect their work as a direct service nonprofit and officially became \"https://.\" During the COVID-19 pandemic, the non-profit supplied tablets stocked with digital books, as well as internet access through a mobile data plan, to students in need. Yamaguchi was selected as one of the 2023 \"CNN Heroes\" for her work with the Always Dream Foundation.\nAccolades and impact.\nFigure skating had long been the domain of white Americans and Europeans. Yamaguchi finished ahead of two Japanese skaters at a competition in 1988 but the medal ceremony was delayed while organizers tried to track down a Japanese flag for Yamaguchi, unaware that she was American. Yamaguchi was the first Asian American to win gold at a Winter Olympic Games, paving the way for Asian American skaters that came after her like two-time Olympic medalist Michelle Kwan, 2022 Olympic champion and Team gold medalist Nathan Chen, Olympic Team gold medalist Karen Chen, and 2025 World champion Alysa Liu. Five of the sixteen athletes on the U.S. team at the 2022 Winter Olympics in Beijing were of Asian descent. Four years earlier at the 2018 Games in PyeongChang, there were seven with ice dance siblings Maia Shibutani and Alex Shibutani.\nYamaguchi has received numerous awards in recognition of her achievements and impact. She was the recipient of the Inspiration Award at the 2008 Asian Excellence Awards. Two days after her Dancing with the Stars champion crowning, she received the 2008 Sonja Henie Award from the Professional Skaters Association. Among her other awards are the Thurman Munson Award, Women's Sports Foundation Flo Hyman Award, the Heisman Humanitarian Award, the Great Sports Legends Award as well as the Jesse Owens Olympic Spirit Award. She is also a member of the U.S. Olympic Committee Olympic Hall of Fame, World Skating Hall of Fame, and the US Figure Skating Hall of Fame.\nPolitics.\nYamaguchi identifies as a conservative Republican; yet, she stated in 2009 that she appreciated then-president Barack Obama as a \"decision-maker\", nonetheless criticizing in the same interview the state of the economy under his leadership.\nIn April 2024, Yamaguchi attended the state dinner for Japan hosted by Democratic president Joe Biden. Yamaguchi backed Biden during the 2020 presidential election.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "17292", "revid": "753665", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=17292", "title": "Krzysztof Penderecki", "text": "Polish composer and conductor (1933\u20132020)\nKrzysztof Eugeniusz Penderecki (; 23 November 1933 \u2013 29 March 2020) was a Polish composer and conductor. His best-known works include \"Threnody to the Victims of Hiroshima\", Symphony No. 3, his \"St Luke Passion\", \"Polish Requiem\", \"Anaklasis\" and \"Utrenja\". His \"oeuvre\" includes five operas, eight symphonies and other orchestral pieces, a variety of instrumental concertos, choral settings of mainly religious texts, as well as chamber and instrumental works.\nAfter graduating from the Academy of Music in Krakow, he became a teacher there and began his career as a composer in 1959 during the Warsaw Autumn festival. His \"Threnody to the Victims of Hiroshima\" for string orchestra and the choral work \"St. Luke Passion\" have received popular acclaim. His first opera, \"The Devils of Loudun\", was not immediately successful. In the mid-1970s, Penderecki became a professor at the Yale School of Music. From the mid-1970s his composition style changed, with his first violin concerto focusing on the semitone and the tritone. His choral work \"Polish Requiem\" was written in the 1980s and expanded in 1993 and 2005.\nPenderecki won many prestigious awards, including the Prix Italia in 1967 and 1968; the Wihuri Sibelius Prize of 1983; four Grammy Awards in 1987, 1998 (twice), and 2017; the Wolf Prize in Arts in 1987; and the University of Louisville Grawemeyer Award for Music Composition in 1992. In 2012, Sean Michaels of \"The Guardian\" called him \"arguably Poland's greatest living composer\". In 2020 the composer's Alma Mater, the Academy of Music in Krak\u00f3w, was named after Krzysztof Penderecki.\nEarly life, family and education.\nPenderecki was born on 23 November 1933 in D\u0119bica, the son of Zofia and Tadeusz Penderecki, a lawyer. His grandfather Micha\u0142 Penderecki was a native of Tenetnyky village near Rohatyn (now Ukraine) and belonged to the Ukrainian Greek Catholic church. He married Stefania Szylkiewicz of Armenian origin from Stanislau (now Ivano-Frankivsk in Ukraine) and they later moved to D\u0119bica. The rest of the Penderecki family retained Ukrainian identity and some still live in their ancestral village. Krzysztof met them upon his visits to Ukraine in the 1990s. On his mother's side his grandfather, Robert Berger, was a highly talented painter and director of the local bank at the time of Penderecki's birth; Robert's father Johann, a German Protestant, moved to D\u0119bica from Breslau (now Wroc\u0142aw) in the mid-19th century. Out of love for his wife, he subsequently converted to Catholicism. \nKrzysztof was the youngest of three siblings; his sister, Barbara, was married to a mining engineer, and his older brother, Janusz, was studying law and medicine at the time of his birth. Tadeusz was a violinist and also played piano.\nWhen the Second World War broke out in 1939, Penderecki's family moved out of their apartment, for the Ministry of Food was to operate there. After the war, Penderecki began attending grammar school in 1946. He began studying the violin under Stanis\u0142aw Dar\u0142ak, D\u0119bica's military bandmaster who organized an orchestra for the local music society after the war. Upon graduating from grammar school, Penderecki moved to Krak\u00f3w in 1951, where he attended Jagiellonian University.\nHe studied violin with Stanis\u0142aw Tawroszewicz and music theory with Franciszek Sko\u0142yszewski. In 1954, Penderecki entered the Academy of Music in Krak\u00f3w and, having finished his studies on violin after his first year, focused entirely on composition. Penderecki's main teacher there was Artur Malawski, a composer known for his choral and orchestral works, as well as chamber music and songs. After Malawski's death in 1957, Penderecki took further lessons with Stanis\u0142aw Wiechowicz, a composer primarily known for his choral works. At the time, the 1956 overthrow of Stalinism in Poland lifted strict cultural censorship and opened the door to a wave of creativity.\nCareer.\n1958\u20131962: first compositions.\nUpon graduating from the Academy of Music in Krak\u00f3w in 1958, Penderecki took up a teaching post at the academy. His early works show the influence of Anton Webern and Pierre Boulez (Penderecki was also influenced by Igor Stravinsky). Penderecki's international recognition began in 1959 at the Warsaw Autumn with the premieres of the works \"Strophen\", \"Psalms of David\", and \"Emanations\", but the piece that truly brought him to international attention was \"Threnody to the Victims of Hiroshima\" (see threnody and atomic bombing of Hiroshima), written in 1960 for 52 string instruments. In it, he makes use of extended instrumental techniques (for example, playing behind the bridge, bowing on the tailpiece). There are many novel textures in the work, which makes extensive use of tone clusters. He originally titled the work \"8' 37\"\", but decided to dedicate it to the victims of Hiroshima.\n\"Fluorescences\" followed a year later; it increases the orchestral density with more wind and brass, and an enormous percussion section of 32 instruments for six players, including a Mexican g\u00fciro, typewriters, gongs and other unusual instruments. The piece was composed for the Donaueschingen Festival of contemporary music of 1962, and its performance was regarded as provocative and controversial. Even the score appeared revolutionary; the form of graphic notation that Penderecki had developed rejected the familiar look of notes on a staff, instead representing music as morphing sounds. His intentions at this stage were quite Cagean: 'All I'm interested in is liberating sound beyond all tradition'.\nAnother noteworthy piece of this period is the \"Canon\" for 52 strings and 2 tapes. This is in a similar style to other pieces in the late 1950s in its use of sound masses, dramatically juxtaposed with traditional means although the use of standard techniques or idioms is often disguised or distorted. Indeed, the Canon brings to mind the choral tradition and indeed the composer has the players sing, albeit with the performance indication of \"bocca chiusa\" (with closed mouth) at various points; nevertheless, Penderecki uses the 52 'voices' of the string orchestra to play in massed glissandi and harmonics at times \u2013 this is then recorded by one of the tapes for playback later on in the piece. It was performed at the Warsaw Autumn Festival in 1962 and caused a riot although curiously the rioters were young music students and not older concertgoers.\nAt the same time, he started composing music for theater and film. The first theater performance with Penderecki's music was \"Z\u0142oty kluczyk\" (\"Golden Little Key\") by Yekaterina Borysowa directed by W\u0142adys\u0142aw Jarema (premiered on 12 May 1957 in Krakow at the \"Groteska\" Puppet Theater). In 1959, at the Cartoon Film Studio in Bielsko-Bia\u0142a, he composed the music for the first animated film, \"Bulandra i diabe\u0142\" (\"Coal Miner Bulandra and Devil\"), directed by Jerzy Zitzman and Lechos\u0142aw Marsza\u0142ek.\nIn 1959, he wrote the score for Jan \u0141omnicki's first short fiction film, \"Nie ma ko\u0144ca wielkiej wojny\" (\"There is no End to the Great War\", WFDiF Warszawa). In the following years he created over twenty original musical settings for dramatic and over 40 puppet performances, and composed original music for at least eleven documentary and feature films as well as for twenty-five animated films for adults and children.\n\"The St. Luke Passion\".\nThe large-scale \"St. Luke Passion\" (1963\u201366) brought Penderecki further popular acclaim, not least because it was devoutly religious, yet written in an avant-garde musical language, and composed within Communist Eastern Europe. Various different musical styles can be seen in the piece. The experimental textures, such as were employed in the \"Threnody\", are balanced by the work's Baroque form and the occasional use of more traditional harmonic and melodic writing. Penderecki makes use of serialism in this piece, and one of the tone rows he uses includes the BACH motif, which acts as a bridge between the conventional and more experimental elements. The Stabat Mater section toward the end of the piece concludes on a simple chord of D major, and this gesture is repeated at the very end of the work, which finishes on a triumphant E major chord. These are the only tonal harmonies in the work, and both come as a surprise to the listener; Penderecki's use of tonal triads such as these remains a controversial aspect of the work.\nPenderecki continued to write sacred music. In the early 1970s he wrote a Dies irae, a Magnificat, and Canticum Canticorum Salomonis (Song of Songs) for chorus and orchestra.\n\"De Natura Sonoris\" and other pieces in the 1960s and early 1970s.\nPenderecki's preoccupation with sound culminated in \"De Natura Sonoris I\" (1966), which frequently calls upon the orchestra to use non-standard playing techniques to produce original sounds and colours. A sequel, \"De Natura Sonoris II\", was composed in 1971: with its more limited orchestra, it incorporates more elements of post-Romanticism than its predecessor. This foreshadowed Penderecki's renunciation of the avant-garde in the mid-1970s, although both pieces feature dramatic glissandos, dense clusters, use of harmonics, and unusual instruments (the musical saw features in the second piece).\nIn 1968 Penderecki received the State Prize 1st class. During the jubilee of the People's Republic of Poland he received the Commander's Cross (1974) and the Knight's Cross of Order of Polonia Restituta (1964).\nTowards the end of the decade, Penderecki received a commission to write for the 25th anniversary of the founding of the United Nations. The result was \"Kosmogonia\", a piece of twenty minutes for three soloists (soprano, tenor, bass), mixed choir and orchestra. The Los Angeles Philharmonic premiered the piece on 24 October 1970 with Zubin Mehta as conductor and Robert Nagy as tenor. The piece uses texts from ancient writers Sophocles and Ovid in addition to contemporary statements from Soviet and American astronauts to musically explore the idea of the cosmos.\n1970s\u20132020: later years.\nIn the mid-1970s, while he was a professor at the Yale School of Music, Penderecki's style began to change. The Violin Concerto No. 1 largely leaves behind the dense tone clusters with which he had been associated, and instead focuses on two melodic intervals: the semitone and the tritone. This direction continued with the Symphony No. 2 (1980), which is harmonically and melodically quite straightforward; the symphony is sometimes referred to as the \"Christmas Symphony\" due to the opening phrase of the Christmas carol \"Silent Night\" appearing three times during the work.\nPenderecki explained this shift by stating that he had come to feel that the experimentation of the avant-garde had gone too far from the expressive, non-formal qualities of Western music: 'The avant-garde gave one an illusion of universalism. The musical world of Stockhausen, Nono, Boulez and Cage was for us, the young \u2014 hemmed in by the aesthetics of socialist realism, then the official canon in our country \u2014 a liberation...I was quick to realise however, that this novelty, this experimentation, and formal speculation, is more destructive than constructive; I realised the Utopian quality of its Promethean tone'. Penderecki concluded that he was 'saved from the avant-garde snare of formalism by a return to tradition'. Penderecki wrote relatively little chamber music. However, compositions for smaller ensembles range in date from the start of his career to the end, reflecting the changes his style of writing has undergone.\nIn 1975 the Lyric Opera of Chicago asked him to write a work to commemorate the US Bicentennial in 1976; this became the opera \"Paradise Lost\" Owing to delays to the project, however, it did not see its premiere until 1978. The music continued to illustrate Penderecki's move away from avant-garde techniques. It is tonal music, and the composer explained: \"This is not music by the angry young man I used to be\".\nIn 1980, Penderecki was commissioned by Solidarity to compose a piece to accompany the unveiling of a statue at the Gda\u0144sk shipyards to commemorate those killed in anti-government riots there in 1970. Penderecki responded with \"Lacrimosa\", which he later expanded into one of the best-known works of his later period, the \"Polish Requiem\" (1980\u201384, 1993, 2005). Later, he tended towards more traditionally conceived tonal constructs, as heard in works such as the Cello Concerto No. 2 and the Credo, which received the Grammy Award for best choral performance for the world-premiere recording made by the Oregon Bach Festival, which commissioned the piece. The same year, Penderecki was awarded the Prince of Asturias Prize in Spain, one of the highest honours given in Spain to individuals, entities, organizations or others from around the world who make notable achievements in the sciences, arts, humanities, or public affairs. Invited by Walter Fink, he was the eleventh composer featured in the annual Komponistenportr\u00e4t of the Rheingau Musik Festival in 2001. He conducted the Credo on the occasion of the 70th birthday of Helmuth Rilling, 29 May 2003. Penderecki received an honorary doctorate from the Seoul National University, Korea, in 2005 and the University of M\u00fcnster, Germany, in 2006. His notable students include Chester Biscardi and Walter Mays.\nIn celebration of his 75th birthday, he conducted three of his works at the Rheingau Musik Festival in 2008, among them Ciaccona from the \"Polish Requiem\".\nIn 2010, he worked on an opera based on \"Ph\u00e8dre\" by Racine for 2014, which was never realized, and expressed his wish to write a 9th symphony. In 2014, he was engaged in the creation of a choral work to coincide with the Armenian genocide centennial. In 2018, he conducted Credo in Kyiv at the 29th Kyiv Music Fest, marking the centenary of Polish independence.\nPersonal life.\nPenderecki had three children, firstly a daughter Beata with pianist Barbara Penderecka (n\u00e9e Graca), whom he married in 1954; they later divorced. He then had a son, \u0141ukasz (b. 1966), and daughter, Dominika (b. 1971), with his second wife, El\u017cbieta Penderecka (n\u00e9e Solecka), whom he married on 19 December 1965. He lived in the Krak\u00f3w suburb of Wola Justowska. Penderecki was a keen gardener, and established a 16-hectare arboretum near his manor house in Lus\u0142awice.\nPenderecki died at his home in Krak\u00f3w, Poland, on 29 March 2020, after a long illness. He was buried at the National Pantheon in Krak\u00f3w on 29 March 2022.\nLegacy and influence.\nIn 1979, a bronze bust by artist Marian Konieczny honouring Penderecki was unveiled in The Gallery of Composers' Portraits at the Pomeranian Philharmonic in Bydgoszcz. His monument is located on the Celebrity Alley at the Scout Square (\"Skwer Harcerski\") in Kielce.\nThe Led Zeppelin guitarist and founding member Jimmy Page was an admirer of the composer's groundbreaking work \"Threnody to the Victims of Hiroshima\" during his teenage years. This would be reflected later by Page's use of the violin bow on his guitar.\nThe composer and Radiohead guitarist Jonny Greenwood cited Penderecki as a major influence. For Radiohead's 1997 album \"OK Computer\", Greenwood wrote a part for 16 stringed instruments playing quarter tones apart, inspired by Penderecki. Greenwood visited Penderecki in 2012 and wrote a work for strings, \"48 Responses to Polymorphia\", which Penderecki conducted in various performances throughout Europe. Penderecki credited Greenwood for introducing his music to a new generation.\nWorks.\nPenderecki's compositions include operas, symphonies, choral works, as well as chamber and instrumental music.\nFilm and television scores.\nKrzysztof Penderecki composed between 1959 and 1968 original music for at least eleven documentary and feature films, including The Saragossa Manuscript (1965), as well as for twenty-five animated films for adults and children.\nSome of Penderecki's music has been adapted for film soundtracks. \"The Exorcist\" (1973) features his String Quartet and \"Kanon For Orchestra and Tape\"; fragments of the Cello Concerto and \"The Devils of Loudun\". Writing about \"The Exorcist\", the film critic for \"The New Republic\" wrote that 'even the music is faultless, most of it by Krzysztof Penderecki, who at last is where he belongs'. Stanley Kubrick's \"The Shining\" (1980) features six pieces of Penderecki's music: \"Utrenja II: Ewangelia\", \"Utrenja II: Kanon Paschy\", \"The Awakening of Jacob\", \"De Natura Sonoris No. 1\", \"De Natura Sonoris No. 2\" and \"Polymorphia\". David Lynch has used Penderecki's music in the soundtracks of the films \"Wild at Heart\" (1990), \"Inland Empire\" (2006), and the TV series \"Twin Peaks\" (2017). In the film \"Fearless\" (1993) by Peter Weir, the piece \"Polymorphia\" was once again used for an intense plane crash scene, seen from the point of view of the passenger played by Jeff Bridges. Penderecki's \"Threnody for the Victims of Hiroshima\" was also used during one of the final sequences in the film \"Children of Men\" (2006). Penderecki composed music for Andrzej Wajda's 2007 Academy Award nominated film \"Katy\u0144\", while Martin Scorsese's \"Shutter Island\" (2010) featured his Symphony No. 3 and \"Fluorescences\".\nHonors and awards.\nPenderecki was an honorary doctor and honorary professor of several universities: Georgetown University, Washington, D.C., University of Glasgow, Moscow Tchaikovsky Conservatory, Fryderyk Chopin Music Academy in Warsaw, Seoul National University, Universities of Rochester, Bordeaux, Leuven, Belgrade, Madrid, Poznan and St. Olaf College (Northfield, Minnesota), Duquesne University, Pontifical Catholic University of Peru, University of Pittsburgh (PA), University of St. Petersburg, Beijing Conservatory, Yale University and Westf\u00e4lische Wilhelms-Universit\u00e4t in M\u00fcnster (Westphalia) (2006 Faculty of Arts).\nHe was an honorary member of the following academies and music companies: Royal Academy of Music (London), Accademia Nazionale di Santa Cecilia (Rome), Royal Swedish Academy of Music (Stockholm), Academy of Arts (London), Academia Nacional de Bellas Artes (Buenos Aires), the Society of Friends of Music in Vienna, Academy of Arts in Berlin, Acad\u00e9mie Internationale de Philosophie et de l'Art in Bern, and the Acad\u00e9mie Nationale des Sciences, Belles-lettres et Arts in Bordeaux. In 2009, he became an honorary citizen of the city of Bydgoszcz.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The name is a compound of \"Paul Kruger\", the former President of the South African Republic (depicted on the obverse), and \"rand\", the South African unit of currency. On the reverse side of the Krugerrand is a pronking springbok, South Africa's national animal.\nBy 1980, the Krugerrand accounted for more than 90% of the global gold coin market and was the number one choice for investors buying gold. However, during the 1980s and 1990s, Krugerrands fell out of favor as some Western countries forbade import of the Krugerrand because of its association with the apartheid government of South Africa.\nUnlike virtually all other modern bullion coins, Krugerrands have no nominal face value. Yet they are considered legal tender in South Africa by the South African Reserve Bank Act (SARBA) of 1989 based solely on their gold content. This feature distinguishes them from contemporary sovereign bullion coins like the American gold eagle which have face values that are merely symbolic and far below the market value of their metal content. The Krugerrand\u2019s \"denomination\" is therefore implicitly \u2018one ounce of fine gold\u2019 (or the fractional equivalent). The only significant historical parallel is the British gold sovereign, which likewise bears no face value but is legally recognized as one pound sterling.\nTo celebrate the Krugerrand's 50 year anniversary in 2017, the Rand Refinery began minting silver versions with the same overall design as the gold coin. According to the online collector database Numista, the non-commemorative, 1 oz silver bullion Krugerrands have been minted regularly ever since.\nHistory.\nThe Krugerrand was introduced in 1967 as a vehicle for private ownership of gold. Like most circulating gold coins from the pre-World War 1 era, the Krugerrand was minted in a 22k copper-gold alloy far more durable than pure gold. By 1980, the Krugerrand accounted for 90% of the global gold coin market. That year, South Africa introduced three smaller coins containing of gold.\nEconomic sanctions against South Africa for its policy of apartheid made the Krugerrand an illegal import in many Western countries during the 1970s and 1980s, with the United States, which had historically been the largest market for the coin, banning imports in 1985: the previous year, over US$600 million of Krugerrands had been marketed in the country. Although gold coin imports could be sanctioned, gold imports could not be sanctioned more generally at the time, due to the West's reliance on South African gold production, so this did not have a great effect on the South African economy.\nMost of these sanctions were removed in 1991 after the South African government took steps to end its apartheid policies.\nBy 2017, over 53 million troy ounces of gold Krugerrands have been sold since their launch in 1967, comprising more than 60 million individual coins (including bullion and fractional sizes).\nVariations and imitations.\nDuring the bull market in gold of the 1970s, the gold Krugerrand quickly became the primary choice for gold investors worldwide. Over 36 million gold bullion Krugerrands were minted from 1970-1980. Between 1974 and 1985, it is estimated that 22 million gold Krugerrand coins were imported into the United States alone. This huge success of the Krugerrand encouraged other gold-producing countries to mint and issue gold bullion coins of their own, including the Canadian Gold Maple Leaf in 1979, the Australian Nugget in 1987, the Chinese Gold Panda in 1982, the American Gold Eagle in 1986, and the British Britannia coin in 1987.\nProperties.\nThe coin is so named because the obverse, designed by Otto Schultz, bears the face of Boer statesman Paul Kruger, four-term president of the old South African Republic. The reverse depicts a springbok, the national animal of South Africa. The image was designed by Coert Steynberg and was previously used on the reverse of the earlier South African five shillings (1947-51 and 1953-59) and 50-cent (1961-64) coins. The name \"South Africa\" and the gold content are inscribed in both Afrikaans and English (as can be seen on the pictures of the coin).\nConfusingly among modern gold bullion coins, the specified weight (1 troy oz etc.) refers to the \"precious metals content only\". This is why the 1 troy oz. Krugerrand \"actually\" weighs 1.09 troy oz. (33.9 g) total.\nThe word \"Krugerrand\" is a registered trademark owned by Rand Refinery Limited, of Germiston.\nProof Krugerrands.\nThe South African Mint Company produces limited edition proof Krugerrands intended to be collector's items rather than financial assets. These coins are sold at prices significantly above market bullion value (like all proof coins). They can be distinguished from the bullion Krugerrands both by the crispness of its design and by the number of serrations on the coin's edge. Proof coins have 220 edge serrations, while bullion coins have 160.\n50th Anniversary Krugerrands.\n2017 marked the 50th year of issuance (1967\u20132017), and to commemorate the anniversary, the South African Mint produced \"Premium Uncirculated\" versions in 0.9167 fine (or 22 k pure) gold. Additionally, the first platinum (0.999 fine) and silver (0.999 fine) Krugerrands were minted. The issue limit for these commemorative platinum, gold, and silver coins was 2,017 for platinum, 5,000 for gold, and 1,000,000 for silver. The commemorative issues are distinguished by a '50' privy seal mark above the springbok design on the reverse for the platinum and silver issues and to the right of the springbok design on the gold issues. In addition to the \"Premium Uncirculated\" issue, 15,000 silver \"Proof\" Krugerrands were also issued, as well as \"Proof\" Krugerrands in gold and platinum.\nExport control.\nThe South African Reserve Bank restricts the exportation of Krugerrands by a South African resident to a non-resident to a maximum of R30,000 (about US$2,100 or \u20ac1,870 as of June 2018[ [update]]). Visitors to South Africa can export up to 15 coins by declaring the items to the South African Revenue Service.\nCharitable donations.\nIn the 21st century, Krugerrands have received media attention in the United States after anonymous donors have left the valuable coin in the Salvation Army's annual \"Christmas Kettle\" donation jars in various cities around the country.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

In the course of the 19th century the relatively short-lived dynasty was supported by the Russian Empire and was opposed to the Austrian-supported House of Obrenovi\u0107. The two houses subsequently vied for the throne for several generations. \nFollowing the assassination of the Obrenovi\u0107 King Alexander I of Serbia in 1903, the Serbian Parliament chose Kara\u0111or\u0111e's grandson, Peter I Kara\u0111or\u0111evi\u0107, then living in exile, to occupy the throne of the Kingdom of Serbia. He was duly crowned as King Peter I, and shortly before the end of World War I in 1918, representatives of the three peoples proclaimed a Kingdom of the Serbs, Croats and Slovenes with Peter I as sovereign. In 1929, the kingdom was renamed Yugoslavia, under Alexander I, the son of Peter I. In November 1945 the family lost their throne when the League of Communists of Yugoslavia seized power during the reign of Peter II.\nName.\nIn English, the family name can be anglicized as Karageorgevitch (e.g., as with Prince Bojidar Karageorgevitch and Prince Philip Karageorgevitch) or romanised as Karadjordjevic. Its origin is as a patronym of the sobriquet \"Kara\u0111or\u0111e\", bestowed upon the family's founder, \u0110or\u0111e Petrovi\u0107, at the end of the 18th century. \nIn 1796, Osman Pazvanto\u011flu, the renegade governor of the Ottoman Sanjak of Vidin, who had rejected the authority of the Sublime Porte, launched an invasion of the Pashalik of Belgrade, governed by Hadji Mustafa Pasha since 1793. Overwhelmed, Mustafa Pasha formed a Serbian national militia to help stop the incursion. \u0110or\u0111e Petrovi\u0107 joined the militia and became a \"boluk-bashi\" (), leading a company of 100 men. After the Serb militias joined the war on Mustafa Pasha's side, Pazvanto\u011flu suffered a string of defeats. He retreated to Vidin, which was subsequently besieged. The war against Pazvanto\u011flu marked the first time that Petrovi\u0107 had distinguished himself in the eyes of the Ottomans, who bestowed upon him the sobriquet \"Black George\" (; ), partly because of his dark hair and partly because of his sinister reputation.\nAncestry.\nAccording to some researchers, Kara\u0111or\u0111e's paternal ancestors most likely migrated from the Highlands (in what is today Montenegro) to \u0160umadija during the Second Great Serb Migration in 1737\u201339 under the leadership of Patriarch \u0160akabenta, as a result of the Austro-Turkish War (in which Serbs took part). Serbian historiography accepted the theory that Kara\u0111or\u0111e's ancestors came from Vasojevi\u0107i.\nSome conjecture has arisen about where the family ended up after arriving in \u0160umadija. According to Rado\u0161 Lju\u0161i\u0107, Kara\u0111or\u0111e's ancestors most likely hailed from Vasojevi\u0107i, but he has said there is no certain historical information on Kara\u0111or\u0111e's ancestors or where they came from, folklore being the only real source. Most likely, Kara\u0111or\u0111e's ancestors hailed from Vasojevi\u0107i. Grigorije Bo\u017eovi\u0107 (1880\u20131945) claimed that the family were \"Srbljaci\" (natives) in Vasojevi\u0107i territory. Contributing to \"Srbljak\" theory is the fact that the family celebrated St Clement as their Slava until 1890, while the patron saint of Vasojevi\u0107i, i.e. Vaso's descendants, is Archangel Michael. King Peter I was allowed to change his Slava to St Andrew the First-called by Belgrade Metropolitan Mihailo in 1890, following the death of his wife, Princess Zorka, thus honoring the date on the Julian calendar when Serbian rebels liberated Belgrade during the First Serbian Uprising. \nFurthermore, King Peter chose Voivode of Vasojevi\u0107i Miljan Vukov Ve\u0161ovi\u0107 to be his bridesman during his wedding to princess Zorka in 1883. Upon being asked by his future father-in-law prince Nicholas why he chose Miljan amongst various Voivodes of Montenegro, he replied that he chose him because of \"heroism and relation\" describing him as \"Vojvode of my own blood and kin\". His son, Alexander, who was born in Cetinje was nicknamed \"Montenegrin\". The Vasojevi\u0107i tribe claim descent from Stefan Konstantin of the Nemanji\u0107 dynasty. The Vasojevi\u0107i were proud of Kara\u0111or\u0111e, and saw him as their kinsman. Montenegrin politician and Vasojevi\u0107 Gavro Vukovi\u0107, supported this theory. Accordingly, Alexander Kara\u0111or\u0111evi\u0107 (1806\u20131885) was given the title \"Voivode of Vasojevi\u0107i\" by Petar II in 1840. Other theories include: Montenegrin historian Miomir Da\u0161i\u0107 claimed that Kara\u0111or\u0111e's family originated from the Gure\u0161i\u0107i from Podgorica in Montenegro. Folklorist Dragutin Vukovi\u0107 believed that Tripko Kne\u017eevi\u0107\u2013Guri\u0161 was Kara\u0111or\u0111e's great-grandfather; Vuki\u0107evi\u0107, writing in 1907, said that in the surroundings of Podgorica, there is a local claim that Kara\u0111or\u0111e's ancestors initially came from Vranj.\nThe family claimed descent from the Vasojevi\u0107i tribe (in Montenegro) and had emigrated in the late 1730s or early 1740s. The family lived in Ma\u010ditevo (in Suva Reka), from where grandfather Jovan moved to Vi\u0161evac, while Jovan's brother Radak moved to Mramorac.\nHeads of the House since 1945.\nThe Kara\u0111or\u0111evi\u0107i are active in Serbian society in various ways. There is a view that constitutional parliamentary monarchy would be the ultimate solution for stability, unity, and continuity in Serbia. In addition, the family supports Serbia as a democratic country with a future in the European Union.\nThe last crown prince of Yugoslavia, Alexander, has lived in Belgrade at the Dedinje Royal Palace since 2001. As the only son of the last king, Peter II, who never abdicated, and the last official heir of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia he claims to be the rightful heir to the Serbian throne in the event of restoration. At the palace, Alexander regularly receives religious leaders and strives, as opportunity permits, to demonstrate his commitment to human rights and to democracy. The family are also much engaged in humanitarian work. Crown Princess Katherine has a humanitarian foundation while Crown Prince Alexander heads the Foundation for Culture and Education, whose activities include student scholarships, and summer camps for children.\nOn 27 April 2022, Prince Peter Karageorgevitch renounced his title of Hereditary prince \u2013 for himself and his descendants \u2013 and his younger brother Prince Philip became their father's heir apparent. The ceremony took place at Casa de Pilatos in Seville, Spain. Present were Peter's and Philip's mother Princess Maria Da Gloria of Orl\u00e9ans-Braganza, Duchess of Segorbe and their stepfather Ignacio, 19th Duke of Segorbe; Philip's wife Princess Danica; their half-sister Sol, Countess of Ampurias; Ljubodrag Gruji\u0107, a member of the Crown Council and Chancellor of the Orders and Herald of the House of Kara\u0111or\u0111evi\u0107; and Nikola Stankovi\u0107, Chief of Staff of the Crown Prince.\nSerbia and Yugoslavia.\nThe Kara\u0111or\u0111evi\u0107 family initially was a Serbian Royal House, then the Royal House of the Serbs, Croats and Slovenes and then the Royal House of Yugoslavia. When they last reigned they were called the Royal House of Yugoslavia.\nCrown Prince Alexander was born in London but on property temporarily recognized by the United Kingdom's government as subject to the sovereignty of the Yugoslav crown, on which occasion it was publicly declared that the Crown Prince had been born on the native soil of the land he was expected to eventually rule.\nMale descendants of Kara\u0111or\u0111e.\nThe list below includes male members of the Kara\u0111or\u0111evi\u0107 dynasty.

Under the influence of Johann Gottfried Herder, he was for 13 years headmaster at the gymnasium and consistorial councillor in Weimar, from 1790 to 1804. For the remaining 31 years of his life, he resided at Dresden as director of the Museum of Antiquities, and was active as a journalist and public lecturer. As a schoolmaster, he had published a considerable number of pedagogic and philological programs. In 1810, B\u00f6ttiger with Swiss painter Heinrich Meyer released a monograph on the painting in the Vatican known as the \"Aldobrandini marriage\". His archaeological works, mainly produced at Dresden, fall into three groups:\nThe first of these is private antiquities, best represented by his \"Sabina, or morning scenes in the dressing room of a wealthy Roman lady\" (; 1803, 2 vols.; 2nd edition, 1806), which was translated into French and served as a model for Wilhelm Adolf Becker's \"Gallus\" and \"Charicles\". The second, the Greek theatre, which B\u00f6ttiger had been interested in since his time as a drama critic in Weimar; his unfavorable review of August Wilhelm Schlegel's \"Ion\" was withdrawn at the request of Goethe. It was mainly as a schoolmaster in Weimar that he wrote his papers on the distribution of the parts, on the masks and dresses, and on the machinery of the ancient stage, as well as a dissertation on the masks of the Furies in 1801. Thirdly, he worked in the domain of ancient art and mythology; his work in this area was popular but, according to some 20th-century critics, superficial.\nHis accomplishments in Dresden led him to be noticed by the court of the Kingdom of Saxony, and he was the Aulic councilor of the kings of Saxony. B\u00f6ttiger supplied the descriptive letter-press to the 1797 German edition of Tischbein's reproductions from William Hamilton's second collection of Greek vases, and thus introduced the study of Greek vase-painting into Germany. He published lectures on the history of ancient sculpture in 1806, and painting in 1811, and edited the three volumes of an archaeological periodical called \"Amalthea\" from 1820 to 1825, which included contributions from the most eminent classical archaeologists of the day.\nIn 1832 B\u00f6ttiger was elected a member of the French Institute. He died in Dresden. His pupil, who edited many of B\u00f6ttiger's works after his death, was the German classicist Karl Julius Sillig. There are two medals that were commissioned for him. One on the occasion of his 70th birthday in 1830 and the other after he died.\nHis son, Karl Wilhelm B\u00f6ttiger (15 August 1790 \u2013 26 November 1862; not to be confused with the Swedish writer Carl Wilhelm B\u00f6ttiger), was a historian and biographer of his father. He wrote \"Karl August B\u00f6ttiger. Eine biographische Skizze\", a biographical sketch (Leipzig, 1837). From his father's papers, he edited the posthumous work \"Litterarische Zust\u00e4nde und Zeitgenossen\" (Literary circumstances and contemporaries, 2 vols., Leipzig, 1838). Karl Wilhelm B\u00f6ttiger contributed the history of Saxony to Heeren and Ukert's \"Europ\u00e4ische Staatengeschichte\", and his \"Allgemeine Geschichte f\u00fcr Schule und Haus\" (Universal history for school and home) and \"Deutsche Geschichte f\u00fcr Schule und Haus\" (German history for school and home) passed through many editions. From 1821 until his death he was professor of history in Erlangen.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Ferdinand Braun", "text": "German applied physicist (1850\u20131918)\nKarl Ferdinand Braun (; 6 June 1850 \u2013 20 April 1918) was a German applied physicist who shared the 1909 Nobel Prize in Physics with Guglielmo Marconi for their contributions to the development of radio. With his two circuit system, long range radio transmissions and modern telecommunications were made possible. His invention of the phased array antenna in 1905 led to the development of radar, smart antennas, and MIMO. He built the first cathode-ray tube in 1897, which led to the development of television, and the first semiconductor diode in 1874, which co-started the development of electronics and electronic engineering.\nBraun was a co-founder of Telefunken, one of the pioneering communications and television companies. He has been called the \"father of television\" (shared with inventors like Paul Nipkow), the \"great-grandfather of every semiconductor ever manufactured\", and a co-father of radiotelegraphy, together with Marconi, laying the foundation for all modern wireless systems.\nBiography.\nEducation and career.\nKarl Ferdinand Braun was born on 6 June 1850 in Fulda, Hesse-Kassel.\nIn 1868, Braun started studying physics, chemistry, and mathematics at the University of Marburg. In 1869, he transferred to the University of Berlin and became an assistant to Heinrich Magnus, who died the following year; he continued his training with Georg Quincke. In 1872, he received his Ph.D. with a thesis on vibrating strings, and subsequently followed Quincke to the University of Wuerzburg as an assistant.\nIn 1874, Braun accepted a teaching appointment at the in Leipzig. In 1876, he returned to the University of Marburg as Extraordinary Professor of Theoretical Physics, and in 1880 was invited to fill a similar post at the University of Strassburg. He was made Professor of Physics at the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology in 1883, and was invited by the University of Tuebingen in 1885. In 1895, he returned to Strassburg as Principal of the Physics Institute.\nRadio work.\nIn 1897, Braun joined the line of wireless pioneers. His major contributions to the development of radio were the introduction of a closed tuned circuit in the generating part of the transmitter, its separation from the radiating part (the antenna) by means of inductive coupling, and later on the usage of crystals for receiving purposes. Around 1898, he invented a crystal detector . Wireless telegraphy claimed his full attention in 1898, and for many years after that he applied himself almost exclusively to the task of solving its problems. He had written extensively on wireless subjects and was well known through his many contributions to \"The Electrician\" and other scientific journals. In 1899, he applied for the patent \"Wireless electro transmission of signals over surfaces\". Also in 1899, he is said to have applied for a patent on \"Electro telegraphy by means of condensers and induction coils\".\nPioneers working on wireless devices eventually came to a limit of distance they could cover; connecting the antenna directly to the spark gap produced only a heavily damped pulse train. There were only a few cycles before oscillations ceased. Braun's circuit afforded a much longer sustained oscillation because the energy encountered less losses swinging between coil and Leyden jars. And by means of inductive antenna coupling the radiator was better matched to the generator. The resultant stronger and less bandwidth consuming signals bridged a much longer distance.\nIn 1905, Braun invented the phased array antenna; he described in his Nobel Prize lecture how he carefully arranged three antennas to transmit a directional signal. This invention led to the development of radar, smart antennas, and MIMO. \nBraun's British patent on tuning was used by Guglielmo Marconi in many of his tuning patents. Marconi used Braun's patents (among others). Marconi would later admit to Braun himself that he had \"borrowed\" portions of Braun's work. In 1909, Braun and Marconi were jointly awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics \"in recognition of their contributions to the development of wireless telegraphy\"; the prize awarded to Braun depicts this design. He experimented initially at the University of Strassburg, not long before he bridged a distance of 42 km to Mutzig. In spring 1899, Braun, accompanied by his colleagues Cantor and Zenneck, went to Cuxhaven to continue their experiments at the North Sea. On 24 September 1900, radio telegraphy signals were exchanged regularly with the island of Heligoland over a distance of 62 km. Light vessels in the river Elbe and a coast station at Cuxhaven commenced a regular radio telegraph service.\nLater life and death.\nIn 1914, Braun went to New York in the United States to be a witness for the defense in a lawsuit regarding a \npatent claim by the Marconi Company against Telefunken's wireless station in Sayville. He was a Lutheran\nAfter the U.S. entered World War I in 1917, Braun was detained\u2014but could move freely within Brooklyn\u2014where he died the following year on 20 April at the age of 67.\nInventions and discoveries.\nSemiconductor.\nIn 1874, Braun discovered the asymmetric conduction properties of certain materials, which became the foundation for the point-contact rectifier. This discovery showed that certain metal-semiconductor junctions could conduct electricity more easily in one direction than the other, a crucial property for diodes.\nBraun's work with semiconductors led to the development of the first point-contact diode, often credited as a basic semiconductor device that allowed the rectification of alternating current into direct current. This is important because it was one of the first real-world applications of semiconducting materials, paving the way for future semiconductor devices that would later evolve into modern diodes, transistors, and other semiconductor technology.\nBraun's discoveries were instrumental in the early development of electronics and helped lay the groundwork for the semiconductor industry we know today.\nCathode-ray tube.\nBraun's enduring fame is largely due to his invention of the cathode-ray tube (CRT), which is still commonly referred to as the \"Braun tube\"; today, the term typically refers to a high-vacuum tube, in which an electron beam can be deflected in both horizontal and vertical directions. The first version, developed in Strassburg in 1897, was far from perfect; it featured a cold cathode and a moderate vacuum, which required a 100,000 V acceleration voltage to produce a visible trace of the magnetically deflected beam. Furthermore, magnetic deflection affected only one direction, while the other was controlled by a rotating mirror placed in front of the phosphorescent screen. \nHowever, industry immediately recognized the potential of the invention, leading to its further development. By 1899, his assistant, Jonathan Zenneck, introduced oscillations to magnetically control the Y deflection, and later improvements included the addition of a heated cathode, a Wehnelt cylinder, and high-vacuum technology. This tube was not only used for oscilloscopes, but also for fully electronic television transmission as a picture tube for television sets, although Braun had considered it unsuitable for television.\nThe CRT became the cornerstone in developing fully electronic television, being a part of every TV, computer, and any other screen setup till the introduction of the LCD screen at the end of the 20th century. It is still occasionally called the \"Braun tube\" in German-speaking countries () and other countries such as Korea (\ube0c\ub77c\uc6b4\uad00: \"Buraun-kwan\") and Japan (: \"Buraun-kan\").\nRadio receiver.\nFollowing the invention of his tube, Braun began researching in the field of wireless telegraphy. A key issue in early radio technology was the development of a reliable receiver. Braun, as a physicist, was accustomed to working under reproducible experimental conditions, which the commonly used coherer receivers at the time failed to meet. He replaced the coherer with a crystal detector, which greatly improved the sensitivity of the receiver, although the crystal detector required frequent re-adjustment. It was only later that the electron tube replaced the crystal detector, although devices like germanium diodes continued to be used in simpler receivers for some time. The first FM radar systems still employed a crystal detector.\nIn late 1898, the technology was commercialized when the chocolate manufacturer from Cologne, Ludwig Stollwerck, founded a consortium to exploit Braun's patents, contributing 560,000 marks in capital. After the successful transmission of signals over longer distances, the consortium was transformed into the \"Professor Braun\u2019s Telegraphy Company,\" which eventually became Telefunken AG. They set up the first world-wide network of communications, and was the first in the world to sell electronic televisions with cathode-ray tubes in Germany in 1934. In 1900, Stollwerck facilitated contact with Professor August Raps, head of the Siemens &amp; Halske Telegraph Construction Company, which later took over the development of the apparatus.\nSee more: Crystal detector\nRadio transmitter.\nBraun also made significant contributions to radio transmission technology. While Guglielmo Marconi had developed his transmitter primarily through empirical methods, Braun was able to improve it by focusing on the underlying physics. Originally, the resonant and antenna circuits were combined, but he separated them into two parts: a primary circuit consisting of a capacitor and spark gap, and an antenna circuit inductively coupled to it. This innovation allowed for greater energy transmission in the system.\nBy 1898, the resulting powerful systems made the term \"long-distance telegraphy\" more appropriate, as the maximum range, previously limited to 20 km, steadily increased. On 24 September 1900, a radio link was successfully established between Cuxhaven and Helgoland over a distance of 62 km. On 12 December 1901, Marconi received radio signals at his station in Poldhu, Cornwall, at Signal Hill in St. Johns, Newfoundland, using a transmitter designed in Braun's circuit. Whether this reception actually occurred remains debated in the literature.\nMeanwhile, Braun attempted to replace the spark-gap transmitter, which produced damped oscillations, with AC generators that generated undamped oscillations, though he was unable to implement a feedback loop using electron tubes at the time.\nTogether with Georg Graf von Arco and Adolf Slaby, Braun was part of the team that developed the concept for \"mobile stations for wireless telegraphy for military purposes,\" which in 1903 led to a practical implementation by AEG and Siemens &amp; Halske. The system consisted of two horse-drawn wagons: one with all the transmitting and receiving equipment, including a battery, and the other with auxiliary and reserve supplies. This allowed the wagons to be separated in difficult terrain, as the station could still operate with just the front wagon.\nSee more: Wireless telegraphy\nAntennas.\nBraun also focused on early problems in directional radio\u2014the alignment of transmitting and receiving antennas. He was among the first to achieve directed radiation and optimized antenna performance through calculations.\nElectroscope.\nBraun is also credited with the invention of the pointer electroscope, which was named after him.\nSID Karl Ferdinand Braun Prize.\nIn 1987, the Society for Information Display created the Karl Ferdinand Braun Prize, awarded for an outstanding technical achievement in display technology.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It is a high-altitude mountain pass lying at an elevation of above sea level in the Karakoram. It holds a significant strategic position on the northern border of Pakistan, specifically in the Gilgit-Baltistan's Hunza and Nagar districts. Additionally, it is positioned on the southwestern border of China with Pakistan, in the Xinjiang region.\nNear Khunjerab Pass, there is another pass known as Mutsjliga Pass, which stands at an elevation of and is located at approximately .\nEtymology.\nThe word \"\u062e\u0646\u062c\u0631\u0627\u0628\" in the local Wakhi language means 'waterfall house'. It is derived from two words, \"\u062e\u0648\u0646\"-\"Khun\" means house and \"\u062c\u0631\u0627\u0628\"-\"Jerab\" means a creek coming from a spring or a waterfall.\nNotability.\nThe Khunjerab Pass holds several distinctions, including being the highest paved international border crossing globally and serving as the highest point along the Karakoram Highway. The construction of the road across this pass was completed in 1982, and it has since supplanted the previously unpaved Mintaka and Kilik passes as the principal route across the formidable Karakoram Range.\nThe decision to use the Khunjerab Pass for the Karakoram Highway was made in 1966. China citing the fact that Mintaka would be more susceptible to air strikes, recommended the steeper Khunjerab Pass instead.\nOn the Pakistani-administered side, the pass is from the National Park station and checkpoint in Dih, from the customs and immigration post in Sost, from Gilgit, and from Islamabad.\nOn the Chinese side, the pass is the southwest terminus of China National Highway 314 (G314) and is from Tashkurgan, from Kashgar and from Urumqi. The Chinese port of entry is located along the road from the pass in Tashkurgan County.\nThe long, relatively flat pass is often snow-covered during the winter season and as a consequence is generally closed for heavy vehicles from November 30 to May 1 and for all vehicles from December 30 to April 1.

His concept of Suprematism sought to develop a form of expression that moved as far as possible from the world of natural forms (objectivity) and subject matter in order to access \"the supremacy of pure feeling\" and spirituality. Born in Kiev, modern-day Ukraine, to an ethnic Polish family, Malevich was active primarily in Russia and became a leading artist of the Russian avant-garde. His work has been also associated with the Ukrainian avant-garde, and he is a central figure in the history of modern art in Central and Eastern Europe more broadly.\nEarly in his career, Malevich worked in multiple styles, assimilating Impressionism, Symbolism, Fauvism, and Cubism through reproductions and the works acquired by contemporary Russian collectors. In the early 1910s, he collaborated with other avant-garde Russian artists, including Mikhail Larionov and Natalia Goncharova. After World War I, Malevich gradually simplified his approach, producing key works of pure geometric forms on minimal grounds. His abstract painting \"Black Square\" (1915) marked the most radically non-representational painting yet exhibited and drew \"an uncrossable line (\u2026) between old art and new art\". Malevich also articulated his theories in texts such as \"From Cubism and Futurism to Suprematism\" (1915) and \"The Non-Objective World\" (1926).\nHis trajectory mirrored the upheavals around the October Revolution of 1917. In 1918, Malevich began teaching in Vitebsk along with Marc Chagall. In 1919, he founded the UNOVIS artists collective and had a solo show at the Sixteenth State Exhibition in Moscow in 1919. His reputation spread westward with solo exhibitions in Warsaw and Berlin in 1927. This marked the first and only time Malevich ever left Russia. From 1928 to 1930 he taught at the Kiev Art Institute alongside Alexander Bogomazov, Victor Palmov, and Vladimir Tatlin, while publishing in the Kharkiv magazine \"Nova Generatsiia\" (New Generation). Repression of the intelligentsia soon forced him back to Leningrad. By the early 1930s, Stalin's restrictive cultural policy and the subsequent imposition of Socialist Realism had prompted Malevich to return to figuration and to paint in a representational style. Diagnosed with cancer in 1933, he was not allowed to leave the Soviet Union to seek treatment abroad. While constrained by his progressing illness and Stalin's cultural policies, Malevich painted and exhibited his work until his death. He died from cancer on 15 May 1935, at age 56.\nHis art and his writings influenced Eastern and Central European contemporaries such as El Lissitzky, Lyubov Popova, Alexander Rodchenko and Henryk Sta\u017cewski, as well as generations of later abstract artists, such as Ad Reinhardt and the Minimalists. He was celebrated posthumously in major exhibits at the Museum of Modern Art (1936), the Guggenheim Museum (1973), and the Stedelijk Museum in Amsterdam (1989), which has a large collection of his work. In the 1990s, the ownership claims of museums to many Malevich works began to be disputed by his heirs.\nEarly life (1879-1905).\nKazimir Severinovich Malevich was born on either 23 (O.S. 11) February or 26 (O.S. 14) February 1879, to Severin (Seweryn) Antonovich and Liudviga (Ludwika) Alexandrovna.5 His parents, who were Polish, had fled Poland following the failed January Uprising of 1863 against Russian rule.32 Lucjan Malewicz, Kazimir's uncle, was a Catholic priest and one of the leaders of the 1863 insurrection.92 The family subsequently settled near Kiev (modern-day Kyiv, Ukraine) in Kiev Governorate of the Russian Empire. Kazimir was the first of fourteen children, only nine of whom survived into adulthood.32 His parents were Roman Catholic, though his father attended Orthodox services as well. The primary language spoken within Malevich\u2019s household was Polish,40 but he also spoke Russian, as well as Ukrainian due to his childhood surroundings. \nMalevich's father worked as manager at several different sugar refineries.5 Between 1889 and 1896, Malevich's family relocated multiple times due to his father's job. In 1889, they moved to Parkhomovka near Kharkov (modern-day Ukraine).5 In Parkhomovka, Malevich attended a two-year agricultural school and taught himself to paint in a simple peasant style, drawing inspiration from rural surroundings.5 About four years later, the family relocated to Voltochok near Konotop, which was near centers of Polish cultural activity at the time.32 There, Malevich met the composer Nikolai Roslavets. He later briefly attended classes at the Kiev School of Drawing under the encouragement of the realist painter Mykola Pymonenko.5\nKursk and Moscow (1896-1905).\nIn 1896, the family moved to Kursk (modern-day Russia), where Malevich encountered several Russian artists, such as Lev Kvachevsky, with whom he often worked outdoors.5 By Malevich's own admission, his dedication to painting would make him the \"black sheep\" of the family.32 Through reproductions, Malevich also became familiar with the work of the \"Peredvizhniki\" (\"Wanderers\"), including Ivan Shishkin and Ilia Repin, two leading Russian Realist painters.5 In 1896, he began working as a technical draughtsman at the Moscow-Kursk-Voronezh railway company.32\nMalevich would later describe 1898 as the year he began exhibiting his work, although there is no evidence for this claim.32 In 1899, he met his first wife, Kazimira Ivanovna Zgleits, who was eight years his senior. They had two children, Galina and Anatolii, the latter of whom dies of typhoid in his early childhood. His father died in 1902, at the age of fifty-seven, and in 1903, Malevich held an exhibition at the Society for the Support of Primary Education in Kursk.32\nRecognizing his style as increasingly more Impressionistic, Malevich intended to receive academic training in Moscow. By 1904, as more French art was being reproduced and discussed in Russia in the magazine \"Mir iskusstva\", Malevich had also become acquainted with the work of Paul Gauguin. Malevich and other artists in Moscow gained an early exposure to Western modern art through the private collections of Sergei Shchukin and Ivan Morozov.10 Their acquisitions ranged from French Impressionism to paintings by Paul C\u00e9zanne and Gauguin, and were later expanded to include the works of the key Parisian avant-garde artists, such as Pablo Picasso and Henri Matisse.\nMalevich is said to have visited both collections soon after his first arrival in Moscow in the fall of 1904. Similarities between his \"Apple Tree in Blossom\" (1904) and Alfred Sisley\u2019s \"Villeneuve-la-Garenne\" (1872), then in Shchukin\u2019s collection, have been cited as an early indication of the collectors\u2019 influence on Malevich\u2019s oeuvre. In October 1904, Vladimir Lenin, the Bolshevik leader and political activist, returns to Russia from exile. At the time, anti-government sentiment in Russia was gaining momentum, intensifying after Bloody Sunday in St. Petersburg in January 1905, when Tsarist forces killed numerous protesters. On October 17, 1905, Nicholas II issued the October Manifesto, granting limited voting rights to the middle class.32 In November, the government suppressed further revolutionary activity through military force. In his autobiography, Malevich later claimed to have taken part in the Battle of the Barricades in Moscow in December 1905, an attempt to sustain the revolution against the Tsarist regime.32\nMoscow and the avant-garde (1906-1915).\nEarly years in Moscow (1906\u20131910).\nMalevich settled in Moscow, along with his family and his mother, in the spring of 1906.32 There, Malevich attended the studio of Fedor Rerberg, who was known to prepare his students for applications to the Moscow School of Painting, Sculpture and Architecture. Despite Malevich's multiple attempts to apply to the Moscow art school, however, he was never offered admission.32 In 1907, the \"Blue Rose Exhibition\" of a group of Moscow Symbolist painters\u2014part of a broader early 20th-century movement that rejected naturalism in favor of mystical themes and dreamlike imagery\u2014left a deep impression on the artist.33 The impact of Symbolism on Malevich during that period is evident in paintings such as \"The Triumph of Heaven\" (1907) and \"The Shroud of Christ\" (1908).9 \nBy 1908, he developed a strong interest in Russian icons and Russian folk art.33 At the same time, more Western avant-garde influences reached Moscow, including through the activities of the \"Golden Fleece\" group, who in 1908 organized a major exhibition of Russian and Western European art that included works by Vincent van Gogh, Matisse, Georges Braque, Gauguin, and C\u00e9zanne.33 In 1909, the group also published in their journal a Russian translation of Matisse's treatise \"Notes on Painting\" (1908) and Shchukin opened his collection to the public.33 In September 1909, Malevich's planned visit to Paris was cancelled when a sale of his painting fell through. Later that year, he met his future second wife Sofia Mikhailovna Rafalovich.33\n\"Knave of Diamonds\" and \"Donkey\u2019s Tail\" (1910\u20131912).\nIn December 1910, Malevich took part in the first of a series of exhibitions of an artistic collective \"Knave of Diamonds\". According to Malevich the name \"Knave\" (or \"Jack\") \"stood for youth\" and \"diamonds\" for \"beautiful youth\".33 The group was founded by Natalia Goncharova and Mikhail Larionov, leading figures of the Moscow avant-garde, who sought to combine the modernist Western vocabularies of artists like C\u00e9zanne with the traditions of Russian folk art. Years later, in 1924, Malevich claimed that the \"Knave of Diamonds\" exhibition \"shook severely the aesthetic foundations and consequently the foundation of art in society and criticism\". During that time, Malevich took on some commercial projects as a way to support himself financially. In 1911, he worked with the company Brocard &amp; Co., designing a bottle for their eau de cologne called \"Severny\", which was used by the company through the mid-1920s. The base of the bottle consisted of a jagged form resembling an iceberg and the stopper featured a small figurine of a polar bear.\nAlso in 1911, Malevich participated in the second exhibition of the avant-garde group \"Soyuz Molodyozhi\" (Union of Youth) in St. Petersburg, where he showed some of his Cubist-inspired paintings. Other artists included Goncharova, Larionov, Vladimir Tatlin, and David Burliuk.33 That year, Goncharova and Larionov\u2014both of whom had a strong influence on Malevich during that period\u2014broke away from the \"Knave of Diamonds\" to establish the \"Donkey's Tail\" collective. Intending to focus more on Russian subject matter, they embraced a deliberately \"primitive\" approach, favoring flattened forms and simplified visual structures. Unlike their Western European counterparts\u2014such as Picasso, whose turn to the \"primitive\" appropriated non-Western imagery mediated through French colonial conquests\u2014the Moscow Neo-Primitivists drew on domestic sources, especially Russian peasant culture and folk imagery like the \"lubok\". Art historians have since noted that even as Russian artists sought to ground their work in local traditions, they continued to rely heavily on the formal vocabularies of the Western avant-garde. In March 1912, Malevich took part in \"Donkey\u2019s Tail\" exhibition in Moscow that ran through April, which included his recent works, such as the figurative and peasant-inspired gouache paintings titled \"Floor Polishers\" (1911-12) and \"Washerwoman\" (1911).\n\"Target\" Exhibition and Cubo-Futurism (1913).\nBy 1913, the influence of Italian Futurism on Russian contemporary art had become more pronounced. Excerpts of the \"Manifesto of Futurism\", written by Filippo Tommaso Marinetti, were already published in Russia in 1909.33 Its call to reject the past, glorify modernity, and embrace speed, dynamism, and aggressive provocation resonated with the Russian avant-garde. Adapting some of the futurist rhetoric, artists like Burliuk and Malevich shifted Marinetti\u2019s celebration of machines and violence more toward linguistic experimentation and cognitive transformation. Among such experiments was a technique called \"zaum\", or \u201ctransrational\u201d language, wherein Russian Futurist technique used invented sounds and words to bypass reason and evoke a higher reality. In a letter sent to his friend, composer Mikhail Matyushin, in the spring of 1913, Malevich wrote:40\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;We have come to reject reason, but we have rejected reason because a different kind of reason has arisen within us, one which might be called transrational [zaum] if compared with the one which we have rejected; it also has its own law, construction and meaning, and only when we have cognized it will our works be founded on the truly new law of transrationalism.\u2014\u200aAround that time, Burliuk led a Russian futurist parade in Moscow, where artists with painted faces recited futurist poetry.64 In March 1913, Malevich participated in the \"Target\" exhibition in Moscow together with Goncharova and Larionov, continuing to reinterpret Futurist vocabularies to \"suggest movement by breaking cone shapes into almost unrecognizable forms\".8 Malevich described himself in this period as working in a \u201cCubo-Futurist\u201d style. Among other paintings, Malevich exhibited \"Morning in the Country after Snowstorm\" and \"Knifegrinder or Principle of Glittering\", both made in 1912, at \"Target\" for the first time. That same year, the Cubo-Futurist opera, \"Victory Over the Sun\", debuted in at Luna Park Theater in St. Petersburg.64 The opera featured a libretto by Aleksei Kruchenykh written in \"zaum\", dissonant music by Matyushin, and stage and costume designs by Malevich. Its allegorical plot depicts the Sun\u2014symbolizing the old order\u2014being captured and buried, reflecting the Futurist celebration of technological progress and the rejection of past traditions. For one scene Malevich designed a curtain with the outline of a square, which he later identified as the first appearance of his \"Black Square\".64 Although the production was poorly received by contemporary audiences, it prefigured Malevich\u2019s subsequent development of abstract painting.\nParis Salon and Wartime Works (1914).\nIn March 1914, Malevich was invited by Nikolai Kubin to participate in the \"Salon des Ind\u00e9pendants\" in Paris.65 He sent several of his works to be shown at the Salon, including \"Samovar\" from 1913, a Cubist depiction of a traditional Eastern European metal container used to heat boil water.65 Malevich also co-illustrated, with Pavel Filonov, \"Selected Poems with Postscript, 1907\u20131914\" by Velimir Khlebnikov and another work by Khlebnikov in 1914 titled \"Roar! Gauntlets, 1908\u20131914\", with Vladimir Burliuk. On June 28, 1914, Archduke Franz Ferdinand was assassinated in Sarajevo, precipitating the outbreak of the Great War (later known as World War I). Sometime in the fall or winter of 1914, Malevich made \"Reservist of the First Division\", an Cubo-Futurist work that incorporated collage, a post stamp with an image of Tsar Nicholas, printed text, and a thermometer affixed to the canvas, among other non-traditional compositional elements. Scattering multiple political, cultural, and military references across abstract geometric planes, the work has been interepreted by some as reflecting Malevich's own status as an army reservist. He also created a series of propagandistic chromolithographs in various formats in support of Russia's entry into the war.407 These prints were accompanied by captions by Vladimir Mayakovsky and published by the Moscow-based publication house Segodniashnii Lubok (Contemporary Lubok). While the prints drew on folk-art traditions of the \"lubok\" and emphasized bold blocks of pure color, the \"Reservist\" relied on Cubo-Futurist collage and abstraction; together, these works signaled formal strategies of flat planes and geometric ordering that further anticipated Malevich\u2019s turn to Suprematism the following year.407\nSuprematism (1915-1918).\nIn 1915, Malevich laid down the foundations of Suprematism when he published his manifesto, \"From Cubism to Suprematism\". In 1915\u20131916, he worked with other Suprematist artists in a peasant/artisan co-operative in Skoptsi and Verbovka village. In 1916\u20131917, he participated in exhibitions of the Jack of Diamonds group in Moscow together with Nathan Altman, David Burliuk, Aleksandra Ekster and others. Famous examples of his Suprematist works include \"Black Square\" (1915) and \"White On White\" (1918).\nMalevich exhibited his first \"Black Square\", now at the Tretyakov Gallery in Moscow, at the Last Futurist Exhibition 0,10 in Petrograd (Saint Petersburg) in 1915. A black square placed against the sun appeared for the first time in the 1913 scenic designs for the Futurist opera \"Victory over the Sun\". The second \"Black Square\" was painted around 1923. Some believe that the third \"Black Square\" (also at the Tretyakov Gallery) was painted in 1929 for Malevich's solo exhibition, because of the poor condition of the 1915 square. One more \"Black Square\", the smallest and probably the last, may have been intended as a diptych together with the \"Red Square\" (though of smaller size) for the exhibition Artists of the RSFSR: 15 Years, held in Leningrad (1932). The two squares, Black and Red, were the centerpiece of the show. This last square, despite the author's note \"1913\" on the reverse, is believed to have been created in the late twenties or early thirties, for there are no earlier mentions of it.\nWhile Malevich's ideas and theories behind Suprematism were grounded in a belief in the spiritual and transformative power of art, he saw Suprematism as a way to access a higher, more pure realm of artistic expression and to tap into the spiritual through abstraction. Thus, the overarching philosophy of Suprematism expressed in various manifestos would be that he \"transformed himself in the zero of form and dragged himself out of the rubbish-heap of illusion and the pit of naturalism. He destroyed the ring of the horizon and escaped from the circle of objects, moving from the horizon-ring to the circle of spirit\".\nMalevich's student Anna Leporskaya observed that Malevich \"neither knew nor understood what the black square contained. He thought it so important an event in his creation that for a whole week he was unable to eat, drink or sleep\". In 1918, Malevich decorated a play, \"Mystery-Bouffe\", by Vladimir Mayakovskiy produced by Vsevolod Meyerhold. He was interested in aerial photography and aviation, which led him to abstractions inspired by or derived from aerial landscapes.\nPainting technique.\nAccording to an observation by radiologist and art historian Milda Victurina, one of the features of Kazimir Malevich's painting technique was the layering of paints one on another to get a special kind of colour spots. For example, Malevich used two layers of colour for the red spot\u2014the lower black and the upper red. The light ray going through these colour layers is perceived by the viewer not as red, but with a touch of darkness. This technique of superimposing the two colours allowed experts to identify fakes of Malevich's work, which generally lacked it.\nPost-revolutionary years (1918-1935).\nAfter the October Revolution (1917), the Russian Civil War ensued. Between 1918 and 1919, Malevich became a member of the Collegium on the Arts of Narkompros, the Commission for the Protection of Monuments and the Museums Commission. He taught at the Vitebsk Practical Art School in Belarus (1919\u20131922) alongside Marc Chagall, the Leningrad Academy of Arts (1922\u20131927), the Kiev Art Institute (1928\u20131930), and the House of the Arts in Leningrad (1930). He wrote the book \"The Non-Objective World\", which was published in Munich in 1926 and translated into English in 1959. In it, he outlines his Suprematist theories.\nFollowing the Bolshevik victory in the Civil War, the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics was established in 1922, led by Vladimir Lenin. In 1923, Malevich was appointed director of Petrograd State Institute of Artistic Culture, which was forced to close in 1926 after a Communist party newspaper called it \"a government-supported monastery\" rife with \"counterrevolutionary sermonizing and artistic debauchery.\" The Soviet state was by then heavily promoting an idealized, propagandistic style of art called Socialist Realism\u2014a style Malevich had spent his entire career repudiating. Nevertheless, he swam with the current, and was quietly tolerated by the Communists.\nStalinism and censorship.\nMalevich's assumption that a shifting in the attitudes of the Soviet authorities toward the modernist art movement would take place after the death of Vladimir Lenin in 1924 and Leon Trotsky's fall from power was proven correct in a couple of years, when the government of Joseph Stalin turned against forms of abstraction, considering them a type of \"bourgeois\" art, that could not express social realities. As a consequence, many of his works were confiscated and he was removed from his teaching position.\nIn autumn 1930, he was arrested and interrogated by the OGPU in Leningrad, accused of Polish espionage, and threatened with execution. He was released from imprisonment in early December. Critics derided Malevich's art as a negation of everything good and pure: love of life and love of nature. The Westernizer artist and art historian Alexandre Benois was one such critic. Malevich responded that art can advance and develop for art's sake alone, saying that \"art does not need us, and it never did\". In 1934, Socialist Realism was officially imposed as the only permissible form of artistic expression in the Soviet Union, effectively banning avant-garde art.\nTravel to Poland and Germany (1927).\nIn March 1927, Malevich traveled to Warsaw where he exhibited his work at the Polish Arts Club housed in the Polonia Hotel.248 He met with several Polish artists, including his former students W\u0142adys\u0142aw Strzemi\u0144ski (whose own theory of Unism was highly influenced by Malevich), sculptor Katarzyna Kobro and Henryk Sta\u017cewski, a prominent abstract painter associated with the Polish Constructivist movement.\nWhile generally greeted with enthusiasm, Malevich faced criticism from some contemporary artists, including Mieczys\u0142aw Szczuka, who argued that Suprematism, as understood by Malevich, was no longer relevant for Polish utilitarianism-oriented avant-garde and that the artist was \"a Romantic who loves painterly means for their own sake\". Art historian Matthew Drutt notes that despite these criticisms, Malevich's Warsaw exhibition and the lecture on Suprematism he had delivered during his visit had a lasting effect on Polish modernism.19 At the end of March 1927, Malevich and Tadeusz Peiper, a Polish poet and art critic who was the editor of the literary journal \"Zwrotnica\", left Warsaw for Berlin. In April that year, him and Peiper visited the Bauhaus in Dessau, where they met with Walter Gropius and L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Moholy-Nagy.19\nMalevich returned to Berlin in May 1927 to participate in the Great Berlin Art Exhibition. Over seventy of his works, including paintings, gouaches, charts, and drawings that spanned the entirety of the artist's oeuvre, were displayed at the exhibition.20 The Berlin show has been described as \"a defining moment in Malevich's career in terms of the reception of his work in the West\" and it became a \"primary source of knowledge of Malevich's oeuvre for the next fifty years\".21 He arranged to leave most of the paintings behind when he returned to the Soviet Union.\nDeath.\nMalevich died of cancer in Leningrad on 15 May 1935. On his deathbed, Malevich had been exhibited with the \"Black Square\" above him, and mourners at his funeral rally were permitted to wave a banner bearing a black square. Malevich had asked to be buried under an oak tree on the outskirts of Nemchinovka, a place to which he felt a special bond. His ashes were sent to Nemchinovka, and buried in a field near his dacha. Nikolai Suetin, a friend of Malevich's and a fellow artist, designed a white cube with a black square to mark the burial site. The memorial was destroyed during World War II. The city of Leningrad bestowed a pension on Malevich's mother and daughter.\nIn Nazi Germany his works were banned as \"Degenerate Art\". In 2013, an apartment block was built on the place of the tomb and burial site of Kazimir Malevich. Another nearby monument to Malevich, put up in 1988, is now also situated on the grounds of a gated community.\nNationality and ethnicity.\nMost academic literature and museum collections identify Malevich as a Russian painter, based on his integral role in shaping the Russian avant-garde, centered primarily around Moscow and Petrograd (modern-day St. Petersburg), and the fact that he achieved prominence while living and working in the Russian Empire and later, from 1922 until his death in 1935, the Soviet Union. However, his nationality has been a subject of scholarly dispute. Based on surviving correspondence, some scholars have also suggested that Malevich considered Russia an \"adopted place to live and work\" rather than a \"true homeland\".\nPolish.\nMalevich's family was one of the millions of Poles who lived within the Russian Empire following the Partitions of Poland. Kazimir Malevich was born near Kiev on lands that had previously been part of the Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth of parents who were ethnic Poles. Both Polish and Russian were native languages of Malevich, who would sign his artwork in the Polish form of his name as \"Kazimierz Malewicz\". His mother Ludwika wrote poetry in Polish and sang Polish songs, and kept a record of the Polish families living in the area. In a 1926 visa application to travel to France, Malewicz claimed \"Polish\" as his nationality. French art historian Andrei Nakov, who re-established Malevich's birth year as 1879 (and not 1878), has argued for restoration of the Polish spelling of Malevich's name.\nIn 1985, Polish performance artist Zbigniew Warpechowski performed \"Citizenship for a Pure Feeling of Kazimierz Malewicz\" as an homage to the great artist and critique of Polish authorities that refused to grant Polish citizenship to Kazimir Malevich. In 2013, Malevich's family in New York City and fans founded the not-for-profit \"The Rectangular Circle of Friends of Kazimierz Malewicz\", whose dedicated goal is to promote awareness of Kazimir's Polish ethnicity.\nUkrainian.\nAccording to Russian scholars Tatiana Mikhienko and Irina Vakar, the secret police file from Malevich's arrest on September 20, 1930 indicates that Malevich declared his nationality as Ukrainian. Scholar Marie Gasper-Hulvat notes that this may have been in part motivated by Malevich's desire to avoid anti-Polish discrimination, since Ukraine was at that time part of the Soviet Union. It is sometimes claimed that he self-identified as a Ukrainian throughout his life. Similarly, the French art historian Gilles N\u00e9ret claimed that Malevich, while at times identifying as Polish \"out of tact or mischief\" and using the Polish spelling of his name, always emphasized his Ukrainian background.7\nFollowing the Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2022 there has been more political and cultural pressure to reconsider his Russian nationality and to identify him instead as Ukrainian painter. This push resulted in the Metropolitan Museum of Art relabeling him as Ukrainian painter, and later Stedelijk Museum labeling him as \"Ukrainian painter of Polish origin\". The relabeling caused a backlash from Russia, including a statement of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. However, the consensus among art historians, including those of Ukrainian origin, is that whereas the discussion (related to the Russian colonialism) clearly needs to take place among all involved parties, it has not yet occurred, and the question concerning the identity of Malevich has not been solved as of 2023.\nLegacy.\nAlfred H. Barr Jr. included several paintings in the groundbreaking exhibition \"Cubism and Abstract Art\" at the Museum of Modern Art in New York in 1936. In 1939, the Museum of Non-Objective Painting opened in New York, whose founder, Solomon R. Guggenheim\u2014an early and passionate collector of the Russian avant-garde\u2014was inspired by the same aesthetic ideals and spiritual quest that exemplified Malevich's art.\nThe first U.S. retrospective of Malevich's work in 1973 at the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum provoked a flood of interest and further intensified his impact on postwar American and European artists. However, most of Malevich's work and the story of the Russian avant-garde remained under lock and key until Glasnost. In 1989, the Stedelijk Museum in Amsterdam held the West's first large-scale Malevich retrospective, including the paintings they owned and works from the collection of Russian art critic Nikolai Khardzhiev.\nCollections.\nMalevich's works are held in several major art museums, including the State Tretyakov Gallery in Moscow, and in New York, the Museum of Modern Art and the Guggenheim Museum. The Stedelijk Museum in Amsterdam owns 24 Malevich paintings, more than any other museum outside of Russia. Another major collection of Malevich works is held by the State Museum of Contemporary Art in Thessaloniki.\nArt market.\n\"Black Square\", the fourth version of his magnum opus painted in the 1920s, was discovered in 1993 in Samara and purchased by Inkombank for US$250,000. In April 2002, the painting was auctioned for an equivalent of US$1 million. The purchase was financed by the Russian philanthropist Vladimir Potanin, who donated funds to the Russian Ministry of Culture, and ultimately, to the State Hermitage Museum collection. According to the Hermitage website, this was the largest private contribution to state art museums since the October Revolution.\nIn 2008, the Stedelijk Museum restituted five works to the heirs of Malevich's family from a group that had been left in Berlin by Malevich, and acquired by the gallery in 1958, in exchange for undisputed title to the remaining pictures. On 3 November 2008, one of these works entitled \"Suprematist Composition\" from 1916, set the world record for any Russian work of art and any work sold at auction for that year, selling at Sotheby's in New York City for just over US$60 million (surpassing his previous record of US$17 million set in 2000). In May 2018, the same painting, \"Suprematist Composition\" (1916), sold at Christie's New York for over US$85 million (including fees), a record auction price for a Russian work of art.\nIn popular culture.\nMalevich's life inspires many references featuring events and the paintings as players. The smuggling of Malevich paintings out of Russia is a key to the plot line of writer Martin Cruz Smith's thriller \"Red Square\". Noah Charney's novel, \"The Art Thief\" tells the story of two stolen Malevich \"White on White\" paintings, and discusses the implications of Malevich's radical Suprematist compositions on the art world. British artist Keith Coventry has used Malevich's paintings to make comments on modernism, in particular his Estate Paintings. Malevich's work also is featured prominently in the Lars von Trier film, \"Melancholia\". At the Closing Ceremony of the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi, Malevich visual themes were featured (via projections) in a section on 20th century Russian modern art.\nIn 2015, a local businessman in Konotop, Sumy Oblast, Ukraine commissioned Yurii Vedmid to create a monument of Kazimir Malevich, who lived there from 1894 to 1895. In 2016, it became the communal property of the Konotop community and was relocated to the city square outside the House of Trade.\nAutobiographies.\nMalevich wrote two biographical essays, a shorter one in 1923\u201325, and a much longer account in 1933, representing the artist's explanation of his own evolution up to the appearance of suprematism at the 1915 \"0\u201310\" exhibition in Petrograd.\nBoth are published in:\nAbridged and revised translations are published in:\nThe 1923\u201325 autobiography appears in:\nThe 1933 autobiography appears in:\nFootnotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He served as education minister from 1976 to 1977 under Takeo Fukuda, and from 1985 to 1986 under Yasuhiro Nakasone. In 1989, Kaifu became prime minister after the resignations of the last two premiers, Noboru Takeshita and Sosuke Uno, amid various scandals; he was chosen in part because of his clean image. During his tenure, Kaifu worked to improve relations with China and made large financial contributions to the coalition in the Persian Gulf War. After his attempts at political reform were unsuccessful, Kaifu resigned as prime minister in 1991 and was replaced by Kiichi Miyazawa.\nEarly life and education.\nKaifu was born on 2 January 1931, in Nagoya City, the eldest of six brothers. His family's business Nakamura Photo Studio was established by his grandfather in the Meiji era, and was situated next to the Matsuzakaya flagship department store.\nKaifu took the exam to the Aichi Prefectural Asahigaoka Senior High School, and while of the eleven students who took the test from the same school, nine were accepted and two, including Kaifu, were not. As part of the student labor mobilization during the war, he was placed in a Mitsui Heavy Industry factory where he assembled airplane engine parts day and night. In 1945, he was accepted in the Youth Airman Academy of the Imperial Japanese Army, but the war ended before his planned enrolment in October. He was then educated at Chuo University and Waseda University.\nPolitical career.\nA member of the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), Kaifu ran successfully for the 1960 Japanese general election and took office as the youngest member of the National Diet. He served for sixteen terms, totaling 48 years.\nKaifu was education minister before rising to lead the party after the resignations of Noboru Takeshita and S\u014dsuke Uno. Facing Yoshiro Hayashi and Shintaro Ishihara, Kaifu was elected on the platform of clean leadership. He became the 76th Prime Minister of Japan in August 1989.\nPremiership (1989\u20131991).\nOn 10 August 1991, Kaifu became the first leader of a major country to make an official visit to China and break China's diplomatic isolation after the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests and massacre. Kaifu ended Japan's participation in economic sanctions against China and offered $949.9 million in loans and an additional $1.5 million in emergency aid following flood damage in southern China in June and July. In 1991 he sent the Maritime Self-Defense Force to the Persian Gulf in the wake of the Gulf War.\nThroughout his two Cabinets, Kaifu's faction was too small to push through the reforms he sought, and the continuing repercussions of the Sagawa Express scandal caused problems. He resigned in November 1991 and was replaced by Kiichi Miyazawa.\nIn 1994, he left the LDP to become head of the newly-founded New Frontier Party. He was then nominated by Ichir\u014d Ozawa and Tsutomu Hata as prime minister in June 1994 against the LDP-Socialist coalition candidate Tomiichi Murayama but lost in the Diet vote. He supported Ozawa's party until he returned to LDP in 2003. He was defeated in the election of 2009 by DPJ candidate Mitsunori Okamoto, which witnessed the end of almost uninterrupted LDP dominance since 1955. At the time of his defeat, he was the longest-serving member of the lower house of the Diet, and he was also the first former prime minister to be defeated at a re-election since 1963.\nPersonal life.\nOn 17 November 1957, Kaifu married Sachiyo Yanagihara (born 30 April 1933), a female assistant to Member of the House of Representatives. The couple had a son, Masaki, and a daughter, Mutsumi.\nDeath.\nKaifu died of pneumonia at a Tokyo hospital on 9 January 2022, at the age of 91. The announcement of his death to the media was delayed until 14 January.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nExternal links.\n "}
{"id": "17303", "revid": "48293121", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=17303", "title": "Kakinomoto no Hitomaro", "text": "Japanese poet\n was a Japanese \"waka\" poet and aristocrat of the late Asuka period. He was the most prominent of the poets included in the \"Man'y\u014dsh\u016b\", the oldest \"waka\" anthology, but apart from what can be gleaned from hints in the \"Man'y\u014dsh\u016b\", the details of his life are largely uncertain. He was born to the Kakinomoto clan, based in Yamato Province, probably in the 650s, and likely died in Iwami Province around 709.\nHe served as court poet to Empress Jit\u014d, creating many works praising the imperial family, and is best remembered for his elegies for various imperial princes. He also composed well-regarded travel poems.\nHe is ranked as one of the Thirty-six Poetry Immortals. \u014ctomo no Yakamochi, the presumed compiler of the \"Man'y\u014dsh\u016b\", and Ki no Tsurayuki, the principal compiler of the \"Kokin Wakash\u016b\", praised Hitomaro as \"Sanshi no Mon\" (\u5c71\u67ff\u306e\u9580) and \"Uta no Hijiri\" (\u6b4c\u306e\u8056) respectively. From the Heian period on, he was often called Hito-maru (\u4eba\u4e38). He has come to be revered as a god of poetry and scholarship, and is considered one of the four greatest poets in Japanese history, along with Fujiwara no Teika, S\u014dgi and Bash\u014d.\nLife.\nSources.\nThe sole early source for the life of the poet Kakinomoto no Hitomaro is the \"Man'y\u014dsh\u016b\". His name does not appear in any of the official court documents, perhaps on account of his low rank.\nAncestry.\nHitomaro was born into the Kakinomoto clan, an offshoot of the ancient Wani clan. Centred in the northeastern part of the Nara Basin, the Wani clan had furnished many imperial consorts in the fourth through sixth centuries, and extended their influence from Yamato Province to Yamashiro, \u014cmi, Tanba and Harima provinces. Many of their clan traditions (including genealogies, songs, and tales) are preserved in the \"Nihon Shoki\" and, especially, the \"Kojiki\". The Kakinomoto clan were headquartered in either Shinj\u014d, Nara or, perhaps more likely, the Ichinomoto area of Tenri, Nara. The main Wani clan were also based in this area, so the Kakinomoto clan may have had a particularly close relationship with their parent clan. According to the \"Shinsen Sh\u014djiroku\", the clan's name derives from the persimmon (\"kaki\") tree that grew on their land during the reign of Emperor Bidatsu.\nThe Kakinomoto clan had their hereditary title promoted from Omi to Ason in the eleventh month (see \"Japanese calendar\") of 684. According to the \"Nihon Shoki\", Kakinomoto no Saru, the probable head of the clan, had been among ten people appointed \"sh\u014dkinge\", equivalent to Junior Fifth Rank, in the twelfth month of 681. These facts lead Watase to conjecture that the Kakinomoto clan may have had some literary success in the court of Emperor Tenmu. According to the \"Shoku Nihongi\", Saru died in 708, having attained the Junior Fourth Rank, Lower Grade.\nThere are several theories regarding the relationship of this Kakinomoto no Saru to the poet Hitomaro, including the former being the latter's father, brother, uncle, or them being the same person. The theory that they were the same person has been advanced by Takeshi Umehara, but has little supporting evidence. While the other theories cannot be confirmed, it is certain that they were members of the same clan (probably close relatives), and were active at the same time. It is likely that their mutual activity at court had a significant effect on each other.\nBirth and early life.\nThe year in which he was born is not known, nor can much be said with certainty about any aspects of his life beyond his poetic activities. Watase tentatively takes Hitomaro as being 21 years old (by Japanese reckoning) between 673 and 675, which would put his birth between 653 and 655.\nEmperor Tenmu's reign.\nThe earliest dated work attributed to him in the \"Man'y\u014dsh\u016b\" is his Tanabata poem (\"Man'y\u014dsh\u016b\" 2033) composed in the ninth year of Emperor Tenmu's reign (680). The content of this poem reveals an awareness of the mythology that, according to the preface to the \"Kojiki\" (completed in 712) had begun to be compiled during Tenmu's reign. Watase also observes that Hitomaro's having composed a Tanabata poem means that he was probably attending Tanabata gatherings during this period. A significant number of poems in the \"Kakinomoto no Ason Hitomaro Kash\u016b\" were apparently recorded by Hitomaro before 690, and are characteristic of court poetry, leading to the conclusion that he was active at court from the early part of Emperor Tenmu's reign. From this point he was active in recording and composing love poems at court.\nWatase speculates that Hitomaro came to court in the service of the High Chamberlain in response to an imperial edict in 673.\nBased on Hitomaro's poetic activities during Empress Jit\u014d's reign, there are a few possibilities for where Hitomaro was serving at Tenmu's court. Watase presents three principal theories: first under the empress-consort Princess Uno-no-sarara (who later became Empress Jit\u014d); second under Crown Prince Kusakabe; third in the palace of Prince Osakabe.\nReigns of Empress Jit\u014d and Emperor Monmu.\nHitomaro acted as a court poet during the reigns of Empress Jit\u014d and Emperor Monmu. In the fourth month of 689, Prince Kusakabe died, and Hitomaro composed an elegy commemorating the prince. He also composed an elegy for Princess Asuka, who died in the fourth month of 700, and a poem commemorating an imperial visit to Kii Province.\nHis poetic composition flourished during the period in which Empress Jit\u014d was active (both during her reign and after her retirement). He composed poetry for numerous members of the imperial family, including the empress, Prince Kusakabe, Prince Karu, Prince Takechi, Prince Osakabe, Prince Naga, Prince Yuge, Prince Toneri, Prince Niitabe, Princess Hatsusebe and Princess Asuka. He apparently composed poetry in Yamato Province (his home), Yamashiro Province and \u014cmi Province in the north, Kii Province in the south, Shikoku, Ky\u016bsh\u016b and the Seto Inland Sea in the west, as well as Iwami Province in the northwest.\nSusumu Nakanishi remarks that the fact that he did not apparently compose elegies for emperors themselves, and that most of his poems centre around princes and princesses, indicates that he was probably a writer affiliated with the literary circles that formed around these junior members of the imperial family.\nLater life and death.\nThe ordering of poems, and their headnotes, in volume 2 of the \"Man'y\u014dsh\u016b\", implies that Hitomaro died shortly before the moving of the capital to Nara in 710. He would have been in Iwami Province, at the Sixth Rank or lower.\nThe date, site and manner of his death are a matter of scholarly debate, due to some contradictory details that are gleaned from poems attributed to Hitomaro and his wife . Taking Watase's rough dates, he would have been in his mid-fifties in 709, when Watase speculates he died. Mokichi Sait\u014d postulated that Hitomaro died in an epidemic that swept Iwami and Izumo provinces in 707. Hitomaro's final poem gives the strong impression that he met his death in the mountains.\nSait\u014d was convinced he had located the site of the Kamoyama of the above poem and erected a monument there, but two poems by Yosami that immediately follow the above in the \"Man'y\u014dsh\u016b\" suggest otherwise, as they mention \"shells\" (\u8c9d \"kai\") and a \"Stone River\" (\u77f3\u5ddd \"Ishikawa\"), neither of which seem likely in the context of Sait\u014d's Kamoyama.\nThe above-quoted translation is based on Sait\u014d's interpretation of \"kai\" as referring to a \"ravine\" (\u5ce1). Other scholars take the presence of \"shells\" as meaning Hitomaro died near the mouth of a river where it meets the sea. (This interpretation would give the translation \"Alas! he lies buried, men say, / With the shells of the Stone River.\")\nThere is no river named \"Ishikawa\" near the present Kamoyama; Sait\u014d explained this as \"Ishikawa\" perhaps being an archaic name for upper part of another river.\nAn unknown member of the Tajihi clan wrote a response to Yosami in the persona of Hitomaro, very clearly connecting Hitomaro's death to the sea.\nWorks.\nHitomaro was a court poet during the reigns of Empress Jit\u014d and Emperor Monmu, with most of his dateable poems coming from the last decade or so of the seventh century. He apparently left a private collection, the so-called \"Kakinomoto no Ason Hitomaro Kash\u016b\", which does not survive as an independent work but was cited extensively by the compilers of the \"Man'y\u014dsh\u016b\".\n18 \"ch\u014dka\" and 67 \"tanka\" (of which 36 are envoys to his long poems) are directly attributed to him in the \"Man'y\u014dsh\u016b\". All are located in the first four books of the collection. Of these, six \"ch\u014dka\" and 29 \"tanka\" are classified as \"z\u014dka\" (miscellaneous poems), three \"ch\u014dka\" and 13 \"tanka\" as \"s\u014dmon\" (mutual exchanges of love poetry), and nine \"ch\u014dka\" and 25 \"tanka\" as \"banka\" (elegies). Of note is the fact that he contributed \"ch\u014dka\" to all three categories, and that he composed so many \"banka\".\nBroken down by topic, the above poems include:\nFrom the above it can be said that Hitomaro's poetry was primarily about affairs of the court, but that he also showed a marked preference for poems on travel.\nIn addition to the 85 poems directly attributed to Hitomaro by the \"Man'y\u014dsh\u016b\", two \"ch\u014dka\" and three \"tanka\" in books 3 and 9 are said to be traditionally attributed to Hitomaro. Additionally, there is one Hitomaro \"tanka\" in book 15 said to have been recited in 736 by an envoy sent to Silla. Including these \"traditional\" Hitomaro poems, that gives 20 \"ch\u014dka\" and 71 \"tanka\". It is quite possible that a significant number of these poems were incorrectly attributed to Hitomaro by tradition. In addition to Hitomaro's own compositions, there are also many poems said to have been recorded by him in his personal collection, the \"Kakinomoto no Asomi Hitomaro Kash\u016b\" (\u67ff\u672c\u671d\u81e3\u4eba\u9ebf\u6b4c\u96c6). The \"Hitomaro Kash\u016b\" included 333 \"tanka\", 35 \"sed\u014dka\", and two \"ch\u014dka\". This adds up to a total figure of close to 500 poems directly associated with Hitomaro.\nCharacteristic style.\nHitomaro is known for his solemn and mournful elegies of members of the imperial family, whom he described in his courtly poems as \"gods\" and \"children of the sun\". He incorporated elements of the national mythology seen in the \"Kojiki\" and \"Nihon Shoki\" and historical narrative in his poetry. While he is known for his poems praising the imperial family, his poetry is also filled with human sensitivity and a new, fresh \"folkiness\".\nHis lament for the \u014cmi capital is noted for its vivid, sentimental descriptions of the ruins, while his elegy for Prince Takechi powerfully evokes the Jinshin War. His Yoshino and Samine Island poems praise splendidly the natural scenery and the divinity of the Japanese islands, and his Iwami exchange vividly describes the powerful emotions of being separated from the woman he loved. His romantic poems convey honest emotions, and his travel poems exquisitely describe the mood of the courtiers on these trips. He shed tears for the deaths of even random commoners on country paths and court women whose names he did not even know.\nWatase credits him with the creation of an ancient lyricism that expressed both human sentiment and sincere emotions across both his poems of praise and mourning.\nReception.\nThere is evidence that Hitomaro exerted direct influence on the poetry composed during his own time. For example, poems 171 through 193 of Book 1 of the \"Man'y\u014dsh\u016b\" bear similarities to his work. It is generally accepted that the court poets of the following generation (the so-called \"third period\" of \"Man'y\u014d\" poetry), including Yamabe no Akahito, were influenced by Hitomaro's courtly poems. \u014ctomo no Yakamochi, a poet of the \"fourth period\" who probably had a hand in the final compilation of the collection, held Hitomaro in high regard, praising him as \"Sanshi no Mon\" (\u5c71\u67ff\u306e\u9580). As discussed above, the death of Hitomaro appears to have already taken on some legendary characteristics.\nIn his Japanese preface to the tenth-century \"Kokin Wakash\u016b\", Ki no Tsurayuki referred to Hitomaro as \"Uta no Hijiri\" (\"Saint of Poetry\"). In the Heian period the practice of Hitomaru-eigu (\u4eba\u4e38\u5f71\u4f9b) also gained currency, showing that Hitomaro had already begun to be apotheosized. Hitomaro's divinity status continued to grow in the Kamakura and Muromachi periods. The Edo period scholars Keich\u016b and Kamo no Mabuchi tended to reject the various legends about Hitomaro.\nIn Akashi, Hy\u014dgo Prefecture there is a Kakinomoto Shrine dedicated to him, commemorating an early Heian belief that Hitomaro's spirit came to rest in Akashi, an area the historical Hitomaro probably visited multiple times.\nHitomaro is today ranked, along with Fujiwara no Teika, S\u014dgi and Bash\u014d, as one of the four greatest poets in Japanese history.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nWorks cited.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "17304", "revid": "28481209", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=17304", "title": "Karl Ernst von Baer", "text": "Baltic German scientist (1792\u20131876)\nKarl Ernst Ritter von Baer Edler von Huthorn (; 28 February\u00a0[O.S. 17 February]\u00a01792 \u2013 28 November\u00a0[O.S. 16 November]\u00a01876) was a Baltic German scientist and explorer. Baer was a naturalist, biologist, geologist, meteorologist, geographer, and is considered a, or the, founding father of embryology. He was a member of the Russian Academy of Sciences, a co-founder of the Russian Geographical Society, and the first president of the Russian Entomological Society, making him one of the most distinguished Baltic German scientists.\nLife.\nKarl Ernst von Baer was born into the Baltic German noble Baer family in the Piep Manor , Jerwen County, Governorate of Estonia (in present-day L\u00e4\u00e4ne-Viru County, Estonia), as a knight by birthright. His patrilineal ancestors were of Westphalian origin and originated in Osnabr\u00fcck. He spent his early childhood at Lasila manor, Estonia. He was educated at the Knight and Cathedral School in Reval (Tallinn) and the Imperial University of Dorpat (Tartu). In 1812, during his tenure at the university, he was sent to Riga to aid the city after Napoleon's armies had laid siege to it. As he attempted to help the sick and wounded, he realised that his education at Dorpat had been inadequate, and upon his graduation, he notified his father that he would need to go abroad to \"finish\" his education. In his autobiography, his discontent with his education at Dorpat inspired him to write a lengthy appraisal of education in general, a summary that dominated the content of the book. After leaving Tartu, he continued his education in Berlin, Vienna, and W\u00fcrzburg, where Ignaz D\u00f6llinger introduced him to the new field of embryology.\nIn 1817, he became a professor at K\u00f6nigsberg University and full professor of zoology in 1821, and of anatomy in 1826. In 1829, he taught briefly in St Petersburg, but returned to K\u00f6nigsberg (Kaliningrad). In 1834, Baer moved back to St Petersburg and joined the St Petersburg Academy of Sciences, first in zoology (1834\u201346) and then in comparative anatomy and physiology (1846\u201362). His interests while there were anatomy, ichthyology, ethnography, anthropology, and geography. While embryology had kept his attention in K\u00f6nigsberg, then in Russia von Baer engaged in a great deal of field research, including the exploration of the island Novaya Zemlya. The last years of his life (1867\u201376) were spent in Dorpat, where he became a major critic of Charles Darwin.\nContributions.\nEmbryology.\nVon Baer studied the embryonic development of animals, discovering the blastula stage of development and the notochord. Together with Heinz Christian Pander and based on the work by Caspar Friedrich Wolff, he described the germ layer theory of development (ectoderm, mesoderm, and endoderm) as a principle in a variety of species, laying the foundation for comparative embryology in the book \"\u00dcber Entwickelungsgeschichte der Thiere\" (1828). In 1826, Baer discovered the mammalian ovum. The human ovum was first described by Edgar Allen in 1928. In 1827, he completed research \"Ovi Mammalium et Hominis genesi\" for St Petersburg's Academy of Science (published at Leipzig). In 1827 von Baer became the first person to observe human ova. Only in 1876 did Oscar Hertwig prove that fertilization is due to fusion of an egg and sperm cell.\nVon Baer formulated what became known as Baer's laws of embryology:\nPermafrost research.\nBaer was a genius scientist covering not only the topics of embryology and ethnology, he also was especially interested in the geography of the northern parts of Russia, and explored Novaya Zemlya in 1837. In these arctic environments, he was studying periglacial features, permafrost occurrences, and collecting biological specimens. Other travels led him to subarctic regions of the North Cape and Lapland, but also to the Caspian Sea. He was one of the founders of the Russian Geographical Society.\nThanks to Baer's research expeditions, the scientific investigation of permafrost began in Russia. Baer recorded the importance of permafrost research even before 1837 when observing in detail the geothermal gradient from a 116.7 m deep shaft in Yakutsk. At the end of the 1830s, he recommended sending expeditions to explore permafrost in Siberia and suggested Alexander von Middendorff as leader. Baer's expedition instructions written for Middendorff comprised over 200 pages. Baer summarised his knowledge in 1842/43 in a print-ready typescript. The German title is \u201eMaterialien zur Kenntniss des unverg\u00e4nglichen Boden-Eises in Sibirien\u201c (Materials for the Knowledge of the Perennial Ground Ice in Siberia). This world's first permafrost textbook was conceived as a complete work for printing. But it remained lost for more than 150 years. However, from 1838 onwards, Baer published a larger number of small publications on permafrost. Numerous of Baer's papers on permafrost were already published as early as 1837 and 1838. Well known was his paper \"On the Ground Ice or Frozen Soil of Siberia\", published in the Journal of the Royal Geographical Society of London (1838, pp.\u00a0210\u2013213) and reprinted 1839 in the American Journal of Sciences and Arts by S. Silliman. There are many other publications and small notes on permafrost by Baer, as shown in the Karl Ernst von Baer museum in Tartu (Estonia), now part of the Estonian University of Life Sciences.\nThere are quite a number of studies in Russian about the origin of permafrost research. Russian authors usually relate with it the name Alexander von Middendorff (1815\u20131894), as he did much scientific work during the years 1842\u20131845 concerning permafrost on Taimyr Peninsula and in East-Siberia. However, Russian scientists during the 1940s also realised, that it was K. E. Baer who initiated this expedition and that the origin of scientific permafrost research must be fixed with Baer's thorough earlier scientific work. They even believed, that the scepticism about the permafrost findings and publications of Middendorff would not have risen, if Baer's original \"materials for the study of the perennial ground-ice\" would have been published in 1842 as intended. This was realised also by the Russian Academy of Sciences that honoured Baer with the publication of a tentative Russian translation done already in 1842 by Sumgin. These facts were completely forgotten until after the Second World War.\nIn North America, permafrost research started after the Second World War with the creation of the Cold Regions Research and Engineering Laboratory (CRREL), a division of the US army. It was realised that the understanding of frozen ground and permafrost are essential factors in strategic northern areas during the Cold War. In the Soviet Union, the Melnikov Permafrost Institute in Yakutsk had similar aims. The first post-World War major contact between groups of senior Russian and American frozen ground researchers took place in November 1963 in Yakutsk.However, Baer's permafrost textbook remained still undiscovered.\nThus in 2001 the discovery and annotated publication of the typescript from 1843 in the library archives of the University of Giessen was a scientific sensation. The full text of Baer's work is available online (234 pages). The editor Lorenz King added to the facsimile reprint a preface in English, two colour permafrost maps of Eurasia and some figures of permafrost features. Baer's text is introduced with detailed comments and references on additional 66 pages written by the Estonian historian Erki Tammiksaar.\nBaer's observations on permafrost distribution and his periglacial morphological descriptions are largely still correct today. He distinguished between \"continental\" and \"insular\" permafrost, saw the temporary existence of permafrost and postulated the formation and further development of permafrost as a result of the complex physio-geographical, geological and floristic site conditions. With his permafrost classification Baer laid the foundation for the modern permafrost terminology of the International Permafrost Association. With his compilation and analysis of all available data on ground ice and permafrost, Karl Ernst von Baer must be given the attribute \"founder of scientific permafrost research\".\nEvolution.\nFrom his studies of comparative embryology, Baer had believed in the transmutation of species but rejected later in his career the theory of natural selection proposed by Charles Darwin. He produced an early tree-like branching diagram illustrating the sequential origins of derived character states in vertebrate embryos during ontogeny that implies a pattern of phylogenetic relationship.\nIn the fifth edition of \"On the Origin of Species\" published in 1869, Charles Darwin added a \"\" giving due credit to naturalists who had preceded him in publishing the opinion that species undergo modification, and that the existing forms of life have descended by true generation from pre-existing forms. According to Darwin:\n\"Von Baer, towards whom all zoologists feel so profound a respect, expressed about the year 1859... his conviction, chiefly grounded on the laws of geographical distribution, that forms now perfectly distinct have descended from a single parent-form.\"\nHe was a pioneer in studying biological time \u2013 the perception of time in different organisms. Baer believed in a teleological force in nature which directed evolution (orthogenesis).\nOther topics.\nThe term Baer's law is also applied to the unconfirmed proposition that in the Northern Hemisphere, erosion occurs mostly on the right banks of rivers, and in the Southern Hemisphere on the left banks. In its more thorough formulation, which Baer never formulated himself, the erosion of rivers depends on the direction of flow, as well. For example, in the Northern Hemisphere, a section of river flowing in a north\u2013south direction, according to the theory, erodes on its right bank due to the coriolis effect, while in an east\u2013west section there is no preference. However, this was repudiated by Albert Einstein's tea leaf paradox.\nBaer investigated peculiar landforms in the vicinity of Volga Delta: groups of knolls with heights up to 25 m named Baer knolls after him.\nAwards and distinctions.\nIn 1849, he was elected a foreign honorary of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. He was elected a foreign member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences in 1850. In 1852, he was conferred the title of Honorary Fellow of the University of Tartu. He was the president of the Estonian Naturalists' Society in 1869\u20131876, and was a co-founder and first president of the Russian Entomological Society. In 1875, he became a foreign member of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences.\nLegacy.\nA statue honouring him can be found on Toome Hill in Tartu, as well as at Lasila manor, Estonia, and at the Zoological Museum in St Petersburg, Russia. In Tartu, there is also located Baer House which also functions as Baer Museum.\nBefore the Estonian conversion to the euro, the 2-kroon bank note bore his portrait. Baer Island in the Kara Sea was named after Karl Ernst von Baer for his important contributions to the research of arctic meteorology between 1830 and 1840. A duck, Baer's pochard, was also named after him.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The resolutions argued that the states had the right and the duty to declare unconstitutional those acts of Congress that the Constitution did not authorize. In doing so, they argued for states' rights and strict construction of the Constitution. The Kentucky and Virginia Resolutions of 1798 were written secretly by Vice President Thomas Jefferson and James Madison, respectively.\nThe principles stated in the resolutions became known as the \"Principles of '98\". Adherents argued that the states could judge the constitutionality of federal government laws and decrees. The Kentucky Resolutions of 1798 argued that each individual state has the power to declare that federal laws are unconstitutional and void. The Kentucky Resolution of 1799 added that when the states determine that a law is unconstitutional, nullification by the states is the proper remedy. The Virginia Resolutions of 1798 refer to \"interposition\" to express the idea that the states have a right to \"interpose\" to prevent harm caused by unconstitutional laws. The Virginia Resolutions contemplated joint action by the states.\nThe Resolutions were produced primarily as campaign material for the 1800 United States presidential election and had been controversial since their passage, eliciting disapproval from ten state legislatures. Ron Chernow assessed the theoretical damage of the resolutions as \"deep and lasting ... a recipe for disunion\". George Washington was so appalled by them that he told Patrick Henry that if \"systematically and pertinaciously pursued\", they would \"dissolve the union or produce coercion\". Their influence reverberated right up to the Civil War and beyond. In the years leading up to the Nullification Crisis, the resolutions divided Jeffersonian democrats, with states' rights proponents such as John C. Calhoun supporting the Principles of '98 and President Andrew Jackson opposing them. Years later, the passage of the Fugitive Slave Act of 1850 led anti-slavery activists to quote the Resolutions to support their calls on Northern states to nullify what they considered unconstitutional enforcement of the law.\nProvisions of the Resolutions.\nThe resolutions opposed the federal Alien and Sedition Acts, which extended the powers of the federal government. They argued that the Constitution was a \"compact\" or agreement among the states. Therefore, the federal government had no right to exercise powers not specifically delegated to it. If the federal government assumed such powers, its acts could be declared unconstitutional by the states. So, states could decide the constitutionality of laws passed by Congress. Kentucky's Resolution 1 stated:\nThat the several states composing the United States of America are not united on the principle of unlimited submission to their general government; but that, by compact, under the style and title of a Constitution for the United States, and of amendments thereto, they constituted a general government for special purposes, delegated to that government certain definite powers, reserving, each state to itself, the residuary mass of right to their own self-government; and that whensoever the general government assumes undelegated powers, its acts are unauthoritative, void, and of no force; that to this compact each state acceded as a state, and is an integral party, its co-States forming, as to itself, the other party; that this government, created by this compact, was not made the exclusive or final judge of the extent of the powers delegated to itself, since that would have made its discretion, and not the Constitution, the measure of its powers; but that, as in all other cases of compact among powers having no common judge, each party has an equal right to judge for itself, as well of infractions as of the mode and measure of redress.\nA key provision of the Kentucky Resolutions was Resolution 2, which denied Congress more than a few penal powers by arguing that Congress had no authority to punish crimes other than those specifically named in the Constitution. The Alien and Sedition Acts were asserted to be unconstitutional, and therefore void, because they dealt with crimes not mentioned in the Constitution:\nThat the Constitution of the United States, having delegated to Congress a power to punish treason, counterfeiting the securities and current coin of the United States, piracies, and felonies committed on the high seas, and offenses against the law of nations, and no other crimes, whatsoever; and it being true as a general principle, and one of the amendments to the Constitution having also declared, that \"the powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people,\" therefore the act of Congress, passed on the 14th day of July, 1798, and intitled \"An Act in addition to the act intitled An Act for the punishment of certain crimes against the United States,\" as also the act passed by them on the\u2014day of June, 1798, intitled \"An Act to punish frauds committed on the bank of the United States,\" (and all their other acts which assume to create, define, or punish crimes, other than those so enumerated in the Constitution,) are altogether void, and of no force whatsoever.\nThe Virginia Resolution of 1798 also relied on the compact theory and asserted that the states have the right to determine whether actions of the federal government exceed constitutional limits. The Virginia Resolution introduced the idea that the states may \"interpose\" when the federal government acts unconstitutionally, in their opinion:\nThat this Assembly doth explicitly and peremptorily declare, that it views the powers of the federal government as resulting from the compact to which the states are parties, as limited by the plain sense and intention of the instrument constituting that compact, as no further valid than they are authorized by the grants enumerated in that compact; and that, in case of a deliberate, palpable, and dangerous exercise of other powers, not granted by the said compact, the states, who are parties thereto, have the right, and are in duty bound, to interpose, for arresting the progress of the evil, and for maintaining, within their respective limits, the authorities, rights and liberties, appertaining to them.\nHistory of the Resolutions.\nThere were two sets of Kentucky Resolutions. The Kentucky General Assembly passed the first resolution on November 16, 1798, and the second on December 3, 1799. Jefferson wrote the 1798 Resolutions. The author of the 1799 Resolutions is not known with certainty. Both resolutions were stewarded by John Breckinridge who was falsely believed to have been their author.\nJames Madison wrote the Virginia Resolution. The Virginia General Assembly passed it on December 24, 1798.\nThe Kentucky Resolutions of 1798 stated that acts of the national government beyond the scope of its constitutional powers are \"unauthoritative, void, and of no force\". While Jefferson's draft of the 1798 Resolutions had claimed that each state has a right of \"nullification\" of unconstitutional laws, that language did not appear in the final form of those Resolutions. Rather than purporting to nullify the Alien and Sedition Acts, the 1798 Resolutions called on the other states to join Kentucky \"in declaring these acts void and of no force\" and \"in requesting their repeal at the next session of Congress\".\nThe Kentucky Resolutions of 1799 were written to respond to the states who had rejected the 1798 Resolutions. The 1799 Resolutions used the term \"nullification\", which had been deleted from Jefferson's draft of the 1798 Resolutions, resolving: \"That the several states who formed [the Constitution], being sovereign and independent, have the unquestionable right to judge of its infraction; and, That a nullification, by those sovereignties, of all unauthorized acts done under color of that instrument, is the rightful remedy.\" The 1799 Resolutions did not assert that Kentucky would unilaterally refuse to enforce the Alien and Sedition Acts. Rather, the 1799 Resolutions declared that Kentucky \"will bow to the laws of the Union\" but would continue \"to oppose in a constitutional manner\" the Alien and Sedition Acts. The 1799 Resolutions concluded by stating that Kentucky was entering its \"solemn protest\" against those Acts.\nThe Virginia Resolution did not refer to \"nullification\", but instead used the idea of \"interposition\" by the states. The Resolution stated that when the national government acts beyond the scope of the Constitution, the states \"have the right, and are in duty bound, to interpose, for arresting the progress of the evil, and for maintaining, within their respective limits, the authorities, rights and liberties, appertaining to them\". The Virginia Resolution did not indicate what form this \"interposition\" might take or what effect it would have. The Virginia Resolutions appealed to the other states for agreement and cooperation.\nNumerous scholars (including Koch and Ammon) have noted that Madison had the words \"void, and of no force or effect\" excised from the Virginia Resolutions before adoption. Madison later explained that he did this because an individual state does not have the right to declare a federal law null and void. Rather, Madison explained that \"interposition\" involved a collective action of the states, not a refusal by an individual state to enforce federal law, and that the deletion of the words \"void, and of no force or effect\" was intended to make clear that no individual state could nullify federal law.\nThe Kentucky Resolutions of 1799, while claiming the right of nullification, did not assert that individual states could exercise that right. Rather, nullification was described as an action to be taken by \"the several states\" who formed the Constitution. The Kentucky Resolutions thus ended up proposing joint action, as did the Virginia Resolution.\nThe Resolutions joined the foundational beliefs of Jefferson's party and were used as party documents in the 1800 election. As they had been shepherded to passage in the Virginia House of Delegates by John Taylor of Caroline, they became part of the heritage of the \"Old Republicans\". Taylor rejoiced in what the House of Delegates had made of Madison's draft: it had read the claim that the Alien and Sedition Acts were unconstitutional as meaning that they had \"no force or effect\" in Virginia\u2014that is, that they were void. Future Virginia Governor and U.S. Secretary of War James Barbour concluded that \"unconstitutional\" included \"void, and of no force or effect\", and that Madison's textual change did not affect the meaning. Madison himself strongly denied this reading of the Resolution.\nThe long-term importance of the Resolutions lies not in their attack on the Alien and Sedition Acts, but rather in their strong statements of states' rights theory, which led to the rather different concepts of nullification and interposition.\nResponses of other states.\nThe resolutions were submitted to the other states for approval, but with no success. Seven states formally responded to Kentucky and Virginia by rejecting the Resolutions and three other states passed resolutions expressing disapproval, with the other four states taking no action. No other state affirmed the resolutions. At least six states responded to the Resolutions by taking the position that the constitutionality of acts of Congress is a question for the federal courts, not the state legislatures. For example, Vermont's resolution stated: \"It belongs not to state legislatures to decide on the constitutionality of laws made by the general government; this power being exclusively vested in the judiciary courts of the Union.\" In New Hampshire, newspapers treated them as military threats and replied with foreshadowings of civil war. \"We think it highly probable that Virginia and Kentucky will be sadly disappointed in their infernal plan of exciting insurrections and tumults,\" proclaimed one. The state legislature's unanimous reply was blunt:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\"Resolved\", That the legislature of New Hampshire unequivocally express a firm resolution to maintain and defend the Constitution of the United States, and the Constitution of this state, against every aggression, either foreign or domestic, and that they will support the government of the United States in all measures warranted by the former.\nThat the state legislatures are not the proper tribunals to determine the constitutionality of the laws of the general government; that the duty of such decision is properly and exclusively confided to the judicial department.\nAlexander Hamilton, then building up the army, suggested sending it into Virginia, on some \"obvious pretext\". Measures would be taken, Hamilton hinted to an ally in Congress, \"to act upon the laws and put Virginia to the Test of resistance\". At the Virginia General Assembly, delegate John Mathews was said to have objected to the passing of the resolutions by \"tearing them into pieces and trampling them underfoot.\"\nThe Report of 1800.\nIn January 1800, the Virginia General Assembly passed the Report of 1800, a document written by Madison to respond to criticism of the Virginia Resolution by other states. The Report of 1800 reviewed and affirmed each part of the Virginia Resolution, affirming that the states have the right to declare that a federal action is unconstitutional. The Report went on to assert that a declaration of unconstitutionality by a state would be an expression of opinion, without legal effect. The purpose of such a declaration, said Madison, was to mobilize public opinion and to elicit cooperation from other states. Madison indicated that the power to make binding constitutional determinations remained in the federal courts:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;It has been said, that it belongs to the judiciary of the United States, and not the state legislatures, to declare the meaning of the Federal Constitution.\u00a0... [T]he declarations of [the citizens or the state legislature], whether affirming or denying the constitutionality of measures of the Federal Government\u00a0... are expressions of opinion, unaccompanied with any other effect than what they may produce on opinion, by exciting reflection. The expositions of the judiciary, on the other hand, are carried into immediate effect by force. The former may lead to a change in the legislative expression of the general will; possibly to a change in the opinion of the judiciary; the latter enforces the general will, whilst that will and that opinion continue unchanged.\nMadison then argued that a state, after declaring a federal law unconstitutional, could take action by communicating with other states, attempting to enlist their support, petitioning Congress to repeal the law in question, introducing amendments to the Constitution in Congress, or calling a constitutional convention.\nHowever, in the same document Madison explicitly argued that the states retain the ultimate power to decide about the constitutionality of the federal laws, in \"extreme cases\" such as the Alien and Sedition Act. The Supreme Court can decide in the last resort only in those cases which pertain to the acts of other branches of the federal government, but cannot takeover the ultimate decision-making power from the states which are the \"sovereign parties\" in the Constitutional compact. According to Madison states could override not only the Congressional acts, but also the decisions of the Supreme Court:\nThe resolution supposes that dangerous powers, not delegated, may not only be usurped and executed by the other departments, but that the judicial department, also, may exercise or sanction dangerous powers beyond the grant of the Constitution; and, consequently, that the ultimate right of the parties to the Constitution, to judge whether the compact has been dangerously violated, must extend to violations by one delegated authority as well as by another\u2014by the judiciary as well as by the executive, or the legislature.\nHowever true, therefore, it may be, that the judicial department is, in all questions submitted to it by the forms of the Constitution, to decide in the last resort, this resort must necessarily be deemed the last in relation to the authorities of the other departments of the government; not in relation to the rights of the parties to the constitutional compact, from which the judicial, as well as the other departments, hold their delegated trusts. On any other hypothesis, the delegation of judicial power would annul the authority delegating it; and the concurrence of this department with the others in usurped powers, might subvert forever, and beyond the possible reach of any rightful remedy, the very Constitution which all were instituted to preserve.\nMadison later strongly denied that individual states have the right to nullify federal law.\nInfluence of the Resolutions.\nAlthough the New England states rejected the Kentucky and Virginia Resolutions in 1798\u201399, several years later, the state governments of Massachusetts, Connecticut, and Rhode Island threatened to ignore the Embargo Act of 1807 based on the authority of states to stand up to laws deemed by those states to be unconstitutional. Rhode Island justified its position on the embargo act based on the explicit language of interposition. However, none of these states actually passed a resolution nullifying the Embargo Act. Instead, they challenged it in court, appealed to Congress for its repeal, and proposed several constitutional amendments.\nSeveral years later, Massachusetts and Connecticut asserted their right to test constitutionality when instructed to send their militias to defend the coast during the War of 1812. Connecticut and Massachusetts questioned another embargo passed in 1813. Both states objected, including this statement from the Massachusetts legislature, or General Court:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;A power to regulate commerce is abused, when employed to destroy it; and a manifest and voluntary abuse of power sanctions the right of resistance, as much as a direct and palpable usurpation. The sovereignty reserved to the states, was reserved to protect the citizens from acts of violence by the United States, as well as for purposes of domestic regulation. We spurn the idea that the free, sovereign and independent State of Massachusetts is reduced to a mere municipal corporation, without power to protect its people, and to defend them from oppression, from whatever quarter it comes. Whenever the national compact is violated, and the citizens of this State are oppressed by cruel and unauthorized laws, this Legislature is bound to interpose its power, and wrest from the oppressor its victim.\nMassachusetts and Connecticut, along with representatives of some other New England states, held a convention in 1814 that issued a statement asserting the right of interposition. But the statement did not attempt to nullify federal law. Rather, it made an appeal to Congress to provide for the defense of New England and proposed several constitutional amendments.\nThe Nullification Crisis.\nDuring the \"nullification crisis\" of 1828\u20131833, South Carolina passed an purporting to nullify two federal tariff laws. South Carolina asserted that the Tariff of 1828 and the Tariff of 1832 were beyond the authority of the Constitution, and therefore were \"null, void, and no law, nor binding upon this State, its officers or citizens\". Andrew Jackson issued a proclamation against the doctrine of nullification, stating: \"I consider ... the power to annul a law of the United States, assumed by one State, incompatible with the existence of the Union, contradicted expressly by the letter of the Constitution, unauthorized by its spirit, inconsistent with every principle on which it was founded, and destructive of the great object for which it was formed.\" He also denied the right to secede: \"The Constitution ... forms a government not a league. ... To say that any State may at pleasure secede from the Union is to say that the United States is not a nation.\"\nJames Madison also opposed South Carolina's position on nullification. Madison argued that he had never intended his Virginia Resolution to suggest that each individual state had the power to nullify an act of Congress. Madison wrote: \"But it follows, from no view of the subject, that a nullification of a law of the U. S. can as is now contended, belong rightfully to a single State, as one of the parties to the Constitution; the State not ceasing to avow its adherence to the Constitution. A plainer contradiction in terms, or a more fatal inlet to anarchy, cannot be imagined.\" Madison explained that when the Virginia Legislature passed the Virginia Resolution, the \"interposition\" it contemplated was \"a concurring and cooperating interposition of the States, not that of a single State. ... [T]he Legislature expressly disclaimed the idea that a declaration of a State, that a law of the U. S. was unconstitutional, had the effect of annulling the law.\" Madison went on to argue that the purpose of the Virginia Resolution had been to elicit cooperation by the other states in seeking change through means provided in the Constitution, such as an amendment.\nThe compact theory.\nThe Supreme Court rejected the compact theory in several nineteenth century cases, undermining the basis for the Kentucky and Virginia resolutions. In cases such as \"Martin v. Hunter's Lessee\", \"McCulloch v. Maryland\", and \"Texas v. White\", the Court asserted that the Constitution was established directly by the people, rather than being a compact among the states. Abraham Lincoln also rejected the compact theory saying the Constitution was a binding contract among the states and no contract can be changed unilaterally by one party.\nSchool desegregation.\nIn 1954, the Supreme Court decided \"Brown v. Board of Education\", which ruled that segregated schools violate the Constitution. Many people in southern states strongly opposed the \"Brown\" decision. James J. Kilpatrick, an editor of the \"Richmond News Leader\", wrote a series of editorials urging \"massive resistance\" to integration of the schools. Kilpatrick, relying on the Virginia Resolution, revived the idea of interposition by the states as a constitutional basis for resisting federal government action. A number of southern states, including Arkansas, Louisiana, Virginia, and Florida, subsequently passed interposition and nullification laws in an effort to prevent integration of their schools.\nIn the case of \"Cooper v. Aaron\", the Supreme Court unanimously rejected Arkansas' effort to use nullification and interposition. The Supreme Court held that under the Supremacy Clause, federal law was controlling and the states did not have the power to evade the application of federal law. The Court specifically rejected the contention that Arkansas' legislature and governor had the power to nullify the \"Brown\" decision.\nIn a similar case arising from Louisiana's interposition act, \"Bush v. Orleans Parish School Board\", the Supreme Court affirmed the decision of a federal district court that rejected interposition. The district court stated: \"The conclusion is clear that interposition is not a constitutional doctrine. If taken seriously, it is illegal defiance of constitutional authority. Otherwise, 'it amounted to no more than a protest, an escape valve through which the legislators blew off steam to relieve their tensions.' ... However solemn or spirited, interposition resolutions have no legal efficacy.\"\nImportance of the Resolutions.\nMerrill Peterson, Jefferson's otherwise very favorable biographer, emphasizes the negative long-term impact of the Resolutions, calling them \"dangerous\" and a product of \"hysteria\":\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nJefferson's biographer Dumas Malone argued that the Kentucky resolution might have gotten Jefferson impeached for treason, had his actions become known at the time. In writing the Kentucky Resolutions, Jefferson warned that, \"unless arrested at the threshold\", the Alien and Sedition Acts would \"necessarily drive these states into revolution and blood.\" Historian Ron Chernow says of this \"he wasn't calling for peaceful protests or civil disobedience: he was calling for outright rebellion, if needed, against the federal government of which he was vice president.\" Jefferson \"thus set forth a radical doctrine of states' rights that effectively undermined the constitution.\" Chernow argues that neither Jefferson nor Madison sensed that they had sponsored measures as inimical as the Alien and Sedition Acts themselves. Historian Garry Wills argued \"Their nullification effort, if others had picked it up, would have been a greater threat to freedom than the misguided [alien and sedition] laws, which were soon rendered feckless by ridicule and electoral pressure\". The theoretical damage of the Kentucky and Virginia resolutions was \"deep and lasting, and was a recipe for disunion\". George Washington was so appalled by them that he told Patrick Henry that if \"systematically and pertinaciously pursued\", they would \"dissolve the union or produce coercion\". The influence of Jefferson's doctrine of states' rights reverberated right up to the Civil War and beyond. Future president James Garfield, at the close of the Civil War, said that Jefferson's Kentucky Resolution \"contained the germ of nullification and secession, and we are today reaping the fruits\".\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Their first film was \"Hoffmeyer's Legacy\" (1912), with Mann playing the part of police chief Tehiezel, but their popularity stemmed from the 1913 short \"The Bangville Police\" starring Mabel Normand.\nAs early as 1914, Sennett shifted the Keystone Cops from starring roles to background ensemble in support of comedians such as Charlie Chaplin and Fatty Arbuckle.\nThe Keystone Cops served as supporting players for Chaplin, Marie Dressler and Mabel Normand in the first full-length Sennett comedy feature \"Tillie's Punctured Romance\" (1914); \"Mabel's New Hero\" (1913) with Normand and Arbuckle; \"Making a Living\" (1914) with Chaplin in his first pre-Tramp screen appearance; \"In the Clutches of the Gang\" (1914) with Normand, Arbuckle, and Al St. John; and \"Wished on Mabel\" (1915) with Arbuckle and Normand, among others.\nComic actors Chester Conklin, Jimmy Finlayson, and Ford Sterling were also Keystone Cops, as was director Del Lord.\nThe original Keystone Cops were George Jeske, Bobby Dunn, Mack Riley, Charles Avery, Slim Summerville, Edgar Kennedy, and Hank Mann. In 2010, the lost short \"A Thief Catcher\" was discovered at an antique sale in Michigan. It was filmed in 1914 and stars Ford Sterling, Mack Swain, Edgar Kennedy, and Al St. John and includes a previously unknown appearance of Charlie Chaplin as a Keystone Cop.\nRevivals.\nMack Sennett continued to use the Keystone Cops intermittently through the 1920s, but their popularity had waned by the time that sound films arrived. In 1935, director Ralph Staub staged a revival of the Sennett gang for his Warner Brothers short subject \"Keystone Hotel\", featuring a re-creation of the Cops clutching at their hats, leaping in the air in surprise, running energetically in any direction, and taking extreme pratfalls. The Staub version of the Keystone Cops became a template for later re-creations. 20th Century Fox's 1939 film \"Hollywood Cavalcade\" had Buster Keaton in a Keystone chase scene. \"Abbott and Costello Meet the Keystone Kops\" (1955) included a lengthy chase scene, showcasing a group of stuntmen dressed as Sennett's squad. (Two original Keystone Cops in this film were Heinie Conklin as an elderly studio guard and Hank Mann as a prop man. Sennett also starred in a cameo appearance as himself).\nRichard Lester's \"A Hard Day's Night\" (1964) has a scene in which the Beatles are chased around the streets by police in the manner of the Keystone Cops to the tune of \"Can't Buy Me Love\".\nIn Sydney, Australia, in the 1960s, Rod Hull, Desmond Tester and Penny Spence featured in a local homage series of TV comedy shorts, \"Caper Cops\". \"It\u2019s a direct steal of the American \"Keystone Kops\" [sic], but this is Sydney, Australia, in the late 1960s and who cares...\" said creator/star Hull.\nMel Brooks directed a car chase scene in the Keystone Cops' style in his comedy film \"Silent Movie\" (1976).\nCanceled cartoon shorts.\nIn the late 1960s, Warner Bros.-Seven Arts was going to create a series of animated cartoon short films based on the Keystone Cops, before being scrapped permanently following the closure of Warner's original animation studio in 1969.\nIn popular culture.\nThe name has since been used to criticize any group for its mistakes and lack of coordination, particularly if either trait was exhibited after a great deal of energy and activity. For example, in criticizing the Department of Homeland Security's response to Hurricane Katrina, Senator Joseph Lieberman claimed that emergency workers under DHS chief Michael Chertoff \"ran around like Keystone Kops, uncertain about what they were supposed to do or uncertain how to do it.\"\nIn sport, the term has come into common usage by television commentators, particularly in the United Kingdom and Ireland. The rugby commentator Liam Toland uses the term to describe a team's incompetent performance on the pitch. The phrase \"Keystone Cops defending\" has become a catchphrase for describing a situation in an English football match where a defensive error or a series of defensive errors leads to a goal. The term was also used in American football commentary to describe the play of the New York Jets against the New England Patriots in the 2012 Butt Fumble game, with sportscaster Cris Collinsworth declaring \"This is the Keystone Cops\", after the Jets gave up 21 points in 51 seconds.\nAccording to Dave Filoni, supervising director of the animated television series \"\", the look of the GU-series Guardian police droids is based on the appearance of the Keystone Cops.\nThe 1983 video game \"Keystone Kapers\", released for the Atari 2600, 5200, MSX and Colecovision, by Activision, featured Officer Keystone Kelly.\nThe open-source 1987 video game \"NetHack\" features Keystone Cops as a type of enemy, appearing whenever a player steals from an in-game shop.\nIn 2025, the term has been parodied in various articles in \"The Daily Beast\", to mock FBI director Kash Patel by calling him \"Keystone Kash\".\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Many years of development and testing led to the CC8S, the company's first street-legal production car, which was introduced in 2002.\nIn 2006, Koenigsegg began production of the CCX, which uses an engine created in-house specifically for the car. The goal was to develop a car homologated for use worldwide, particularly the United States whose strict regulations did not allow the import of earlier Koenigsegg models.\nIn March 2009, the CCXR was listed by \"Forbes\" as one of \"the world's most beautiful cars\".\nIn December 2010, the Agera won the BBC Top Gear Hypercar of the Year Award.\nApart from developing, manufacturing and selling the Koenigsegg line of sports cars, Koenigsegg is also involved in \"green technology\" development programmes beginning with the CCXR (\"Flower Power\") flex-fuel sports car and continuing through the present with the Jesko. Koenigsegg is also active in development programs of plug-in electric cars' systems and next-generation reciprocating engine technologies. Koenigsegg has also developed a camless piston engine which found its first application in the Gemera, which was introduced in 2020.\nKoenigsegg develops and produces most of the main systems, subsystems and components needed for its cars in-house instead of relying on subcontractors.\nIn January 2019, Koenigsegg sold a 20% stake in the company to Swedish electric car manufacturer (Egstrand &amp; Lundgren), National Electric Vehicle Sweden (NEVS), for US$.\nKoenigsegg has since then bought the stake back from NEVS in 2021 and owns 100% of the company again.\nIn mid-2023, Koenigsegg inaugurated a new factory, engineering and R&amp;D facilities and a showroom in \u00c4ngelholm. At the end of 2023, Koenigsegg had just under 800 employees.\nHistory.\nFactory history.\nChristian von Koenigsegg got the idea to build his own car after watching the Norwegian stop-motion animated movie \"The Pinchcliffe Grand Prix\" in his youth. At 22 years old, Koenigsegg gathered from investors and founded Koenigsegg Automotive in 1994.\nInitially, Koenigsegg Automotive was based in Olofstr\u00f6m. In the early 2000s, the company moved to \u00c4ngelholm. On 22 February 2003, one of the production facilities caught fire and was badly damaged. Koenigsegg then acquired an abandoned air field to use as his new factory building and in late 2003, one of the two large fighter-jet hangars and an office building were converted into a car factory. Since then, the company is located near the still-active \u00c4ngelholm airport. Koenigsegg controls and uses the former military runway for shakedown runs of production cars and high-speed testing.\nIn July 2023 Koenigsegg opened a newly built factory, close to the old factory building in \u00c4ngeholm, doubling the production capacity.\nPrototypes and production.\nThe initial design of the CC was penned down by Christian von Koenigsegg. Industrial designer David Crafoord realised the sketches as a 1:5 scale model. This model was later scaled up in order to create the base plug for the initial Koenigsegg prototype that was finished in 1996. During the next years, the prototype went through extensive testing and several new prototypes were built. The prototypes initially used an Audi V8 engine but after the engine supply contract fell through, the next candidate was the Flat-12 race engine developed by Motori Moderni for the Scuderia Coloni Formula one team, in which this engine was raced under the Subaru badge in the 1990 season. These Subaru 1235 engines were purchased and modified for use in the CC; this deal failed when the founder of Motori Moderni died, sending the company into bankruptcy.\nKoenigsegg developed its own engine based on the Ford Modular architecture in 2012. It later developed its own engines from scratch, including control systems and transmissions, which is very unusual for a small size sports car producer.\nBadge.\nThe Koenigsegg badge was designed in 1994 by Jacob L\u00e5ftman, based on the heraldic coat of arms of the von Koenigsegg family. The shield has been the family's coat of arms since the 12th century when a family member was knighted by the Holy Roman Empire.\nGhost Badge.\nAfter moving into the abandoned airfield, which once housed a Swedish Air Force squadron, Koenigsegg adopted the \"ghost symbol\" that the squadron had on its planes as a tribute. The badge is seen on models built in the factory that was converted from its hangar.\nAttempted purchase of Saab.\nOn 12 June 2009, the media reported that Koenigsegg Group, consisting of Koenigsegg Automotive AB, Christian von Koenigsegg, B\u00e5rd Eker and a group of investors led by Mark Bishop had signed a letter of intent with Saab to take over the brand from General Motors. General Motors confirmed on 16 June that they had chosen Koenigsegg Group as the buyer of Saab Automobile. The deal, set to close 30 September 2009, included US$ in financing from the European Investment Bank, guaranteed by the Swedish government. By comparison, in 2008 Koenigsegg with its staff of 45 produced 18 cars at an average price of US$; Saab employed 3,400 workers and made more than 93,000 cars.\nGeneral Motors announced on 18 August that the deal had been signed, although certain financing details remained to be completed. On 9 September 2009, Koenigsegg announced that BAIC was going to join as a minority stakeholder in Koenigsegg.\nIn November 2009, Koenigsegg decided not to finalise the purchase of Saab and therefore left the negotiations. Koenigsegg stated that its decision was due to the uncertain timing of finalisation of the takeover.\nModels.\nA Koenigsegg CC prototype was first publicised in 1996, while the full carbon fibre production prototype having white paintwork was finally unveiled at the 2000 Paris Motor Show. Stephan Reeckmann became the first customer of the brand, placing a deposit in 2001. Another customer took delivery of a red CC8S in 2002 at the Geneva Auto Show and four more cars were built that year. Koenigsegg was established in Asia later that year with a premiere at the Seoul Auto Show. In 2004, the new CCR, which was basically a high performance variant of the CC8S, was unveiled at the Geneva Auto Show; only 14 were produced.\nIn 2006, Koenigsegg introduced the CCX, a new model, that was developed in order to meet worldwide regulations for road use. This meant the car had to go through extensive development in order to meet the latest and most stringent safety and emission standards that the world's authorities demanded; Koenigsegg had to, for example, develop its own engines and other related technologies.\nIn 2007, Koenigsegg premiered the CCXR, a biofuel/flex-fuel version of the CCX. The car features a modified engine, fuel system, and engine management system that enables the car to run on normal gasoline or ethanol, and in any mixture between these two fuels. Ethanol has a higher octane rating compared to regular fuel.\nIn 2009, Koenigsegg released information about a special edition car called the \"Trevita\", of which three were planned to be made but only two were finished due to technical problems. The \"Trevita\", which translates into English as \"three whites\", has a body made entirely of Koenigsegg's proprietary material consisting of diamond-coated carbon fibre. The \"Trevita\" is based on the CCXR, and therefore has a power output of when running on biofuel.\nIn 2010 Koenigsegg released information at the 2010 Geneva Motor Show about a new model called the Agera, which translates into English as \"take action/act\". The Agera features a Koenigsegg developed 5.0-litre V8 engine coupled with variable turbo geometry turbochargers having a power output of , mated to a newly developed 7-speed dual clutch transmission. The Agera's design follows a clear lineage from the previous Koenigsegg sports cars, but adds many special new features, such as a wider front track, new styling and aerodynamic features, and a new interior; including a new lighting technique called \"Ghost Light\" by the manufacturer which consists of microscopic holes to hide the interior lighting until it is turned on, which then shines through what appears to be solid aluminium. Production of the Agera ended in July 2018 after being in production for eight years when two of the three final edition cars were presented to its customers.\nAt the 2015 Geneva Motor Show, Koenigsegg presented a new model named the \"Regera\", which translates into English as to \"reign\" or \"rule\". The Regera uses the Koenigsegg Direct Drive (KDD) transmission. Below , motive power is by two electric motors on the rear wheels and the internal combustion engine (ICE) is disconnected. Above , the ICE is connected by a fixed ratio transmission with no gearbox, torque vectoring by the previously mentioned electric motors and boosted by a third electric motor attached to the driveshaft.\nKoenigsegg initially based its engine on a V8 engine block from Ford Racing. These engines powered the initial run of the CC monikered cars. The block for the V8 in the CCX (Competition Coupe Ten, to celebrate ten years of the company) was cast for Koenigsegg by Grainger &amp; Worrall of the UK who also cast the block for the Agera's 5.0-litre engine.\nIn late 2018, Koenigsegg showed potential customers in Australia the replacement of the Agera via VR. Teaser sketches were released by the company at the same time. Initially, the model was rumoured to be called \"Ragnarok\" but the public unveil of the car at the 2019 Geneva Motor Show revealed the name to be Jesko, after the founder's father Jesko von Koenigsegg.\nThe Jesko uses a development of the 5.0-litre V8 engine used in the Agera which has a power output of on normal gasoline and has a power output of and of torque at 5,100 rpm on E85 biofuel. The engine is mated to a 9-speed multi-clutch transmission having seven clutches called the \"Light Speed Transmission\" (LST) by the manufacturer. The focus of this transmission is to have faster shift times. The car will come in either a high-downforce, track-oriented or a low-drag, high speed Absolut variant.\nOn 3 March 2020, the Gemera was unveiled on an online broadcast. It is scheduled to be released to the public in 2022. There will be a limited production of 300 units. This will be Koenigsegg's first four-seater vehicle. The vehicle is powered by a small engine called the Koenigsegg TFG (Tiny Friendly Giant). The car also features full-length Koenigsegg Automated Twisted Synchrohelix Actuation Doors (KATSAD).\nRecords.\nOn 28 February 2005, at 12:08 pm local time, in Nard\u00f2, Italy, the CCR broke the Guinness World Record for the fastest production car in the world, having attained on the Nard\u00f2 Ring (a circular track of circumference), breaking the record previously held by the McLaren F1.\nIt held the record until September 2005 when the Bugatti Veyron broke the record again by attaining a speed of , proven both by \"Car and Driver\" and \"Top Gear\". Both of the records set by Bugatti and McLaren were set on Volkswagen's own test-track Ehra-Lessien, which features a straight.\nIn 2008 the German magazine \"sport auto\" conducted a test for production cars, with the CCX winning the event in a total time of 29.2 seconds. The CCX also accelerated from 0\u2013200\u00a0km/h in 9.3 seconds.\nIn September 2011, the Agera R broke the Guinness World Record for 0\u2013300\u00a0km/h with a time of 14.53 seconds and a 0\u2013300\u20130\u00a0km/h time of 21.19 seconds. Koenigsegg improved this record with the One:1 on 8 June 2015. It attained 0\u2013300\u00a0km/h in 11.92 seconds and 0\u2013300\u20130\u00a0km/h in 17.95 seconds (a 3.24 sec improvement over the 2011 Koenigsegg Agera R record), it also attained 0\u2013322\u00a0km/h (0\u2013200\u00a0mph) in 14.328 seconds and 0\u2013322\u20130\u00a0km/h in 20.71 seconds.\nOn 1 October 2017, an Agera RS set an unofficial record for with a time of 36.44 seconds. The record was set at the Vandel Airfield in Denmark and broke the record of 42 seconds set by the Bugatti Chiron a few weeks prior.\nOn 4 November 2017, an Agera RS set a new record for the world's fastest production car with an average speed of with Koenigsegg test driver Niklas Lilja behind the wheel. The record breaking run was done on a closed section of Nevada State Route 160 in Pahrump, Nevada, United States. On the same day they also beat its own 0\u2013400\u20130\u00a0km/h record they set a few weeks prior (33.29 seconds compared to the old record of 36.44 seconds). It was later confirmed via the instrumentation that the car topped out at 457.94\u00a0km/h (284.55\u00a0mph).\nOn 23 September 2019, Koenigsegg set a new 0\u2013400\u20130\u00a0km/h world record when a Koenigsegg Regera completed the run in 31.49 seconds. This was 1.8 seconds faster than Koenigsegg's previously unbeaten record, set by the Agera RS in 2017.\nOn 16 June 2023, the Regera again broke the 0\u2013400\u20130\u00a0km/h acceleration record with an improved time of 28.81 seconds. The new record attempt came one month after the Regera's first record was broken by the Rimac Nevera, which achieved a time of 29.93 seconds. The record was set at \u00d6rebro Airport by Koenigsegg development driver Markus Lundh, who cited improvements in the track surface and the new Michelin Cup 2 R tyres as reasons for the faster run.\nOver the new record run, the car accelerated from 0\u2013400\u00a0km/h in 20.68 seconds over a distance of and decelerated to a controlled stop in 8.13 seconds over a distance of . The total distance used for the record was .\nOn 18 August 2024, the Jesko Attack set the production car lap record at Laguna Seca with a time of 1:24.86, even though neither Koenigsegg test driver Markus Lundh nor the Jesko had ever been on that track before.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It is a semi-exclave on the Baltic Sea within the historical Baltic region of Prussia, bordered by Poland to the south Lithuania to the north and east, and the Baltic Sea to the west. The largest city and administrative centre is the city of Kaliningrad. The port city of Baltiysk is Russia's only port on the Baltic Sea that remains ice-free in winter. Kaliningrad Oblast had a population of roughly one million in the 2021 Russian census. It has an area of .\nVarious peoples, including Lithuanians, Germans, and Poles, lived on the land which is now Kaliningrad. The territory was formerly the northern part of East Prussia. With the defeat of Nazi Germany in World War II, the territory was annexed to the Russian SFSR by the Soviet Union. Following the post-war migration and flight and expulsion of Germans, the territory was populated with Soviet citizens, mostly Russians.\nHistory.\nThe territory of what is now the Kaliningrad Oblast used to be inhabited by the Old Prussians and other Western Balts, prior to the Teutonic conquest in the early Late Middle Ages. Afterwards, it was settled by Germans (especially the western part), Lithuanians (especially Lithuania Minor) and Poles (especially K\u00f6nigsberg, , and the current southern border strip). The Old Prussians became extinct due to Germanisation in the first half of the 18th century. The Lithuanian-inhabited areas of the Teutonic State were known as Lithuania Minor, which encompassed all of modern Kaliningrad Oblast until the 18th century.\nLate Middle Ages.\nIn the 13th century, the Teutonic Order conquered the region and established the State of the Teutonic Order, a theocracy. In 1255, on the foundations of a destroyed Sambian settlement known as , the Teutonic Order founded the city of K\u00f6nigsberg (modern Kaliningrad), naming it in honour of Ottokar II of Bohemia.\nThe Northern Crusades, including the Lithuanian Crusade, were partly motivated by colonization. The German colonist peasants, craftsmen, and merchants were predominantly concentrated in the southern part of the Teutonic State and did not move into Nadruvia and Skalvia due to the Lithuanian military threat.\nIn 1454, following a request by the anti-Teutonic Prussian Confederation, the territory was incorporated to the Kingdom of Poland by King Casimir IV Jagiellon, an event that sparked the Thirteen Years' War (1454\u20131466). After Poland's victory in the war with the Second Peace of Thorn, the State of the Teutonic Order became a vassal of Poland, also considered an integral part of \"one and indivisible\" Kingdom of Poland. During this war, the capital of the Teutonic state was moved from Marienburg (now Malbork) to K\u00f6nigsberg in 1457. When the rulers of Prussia were vassals of the King of Poland from 1466 to 1660, there were few German colonists.\nEarly modern period.\nAfter the Teutonic Order lost the war of 1519\u20131521 with Poland, the Teutonic Order remained a vassal of the Kingdom of Poland. In 1525, Grand Master Albert of Brandenburg secularized the Teutonic Order's Prussian branch and established himself as ruler of the Duchy of Prussia, the first Protestant state in Europe. K\u00f6nigsberg was the residence of the Duke of Prussia from 1525 until 1701, and was the Duchy of Prussia's capital until 1660, when the capital moved to Berlin.\nPolish and Lithuanian culture blossomed in K\u00f6nigsberg, with the city being the place of publication of the first Polish- and Lithuanian-language cathechisms (by Jan Seklucjan and Martynas Ma\u017evydas), the first Polish translation of the New Testament, \"Grammatica Litvanica\", the first Lithuanian grammar book, and the Albertina University being the second oldest university of the Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth, after receiving a royal privilege from King Sigismund II Augustus in 1560. Polish printing continued for centuries with the last Polish publication in 1931.\nIn 1577, the Duke of Prussia forbade serfs\u2014who were mostly Old Prussians, Lithuanians, and Masurians\u2014to leave the land that was the property of the German knights who became proprietary nobles.\nIn 1618, the Duchy merged with the Margraviate of Brandenburg to form Brandenburg-Prussia, remaining under Polish suzerainty until 1660. There was strong opposition to the separation of the region from Poland, especially in K\u00f6nigsberg. A confederation was formed in the city to maintain Poland's sovereignty over the city and region. The Brandenburg Elector and his army, however, entered the city and abducted and imprisoned the leader of the city's anti-Elector opposition Hieronymus Roth. In 1663, the city burghers, forced by Elector Frederick William, swore an oath of allegiance to him, however, in the same ceremony they still also pledged allegiance to Poland.\nIn 1724, King Frederick William I of Prussia prohibited Poles, Samogitians and Jews from settling in Lithuania Minor, and initiated German colonization to change the region's ethnic composition. In 1734\u20131736, K\u00f6nigsberg was the place of stay of Polish King Stanis\u0142aw Leszczy\u0144ski during the War of the Polish Succession. In 1756 Russia decided to go to war with the Kingdom of Prussia and annex the territory, which was then to be offered to Poland as part of a territorial exchange desired by Russia. The territory was occupied and annexed by Russia in 1758 during the Seven Years' War before being returned to Prussia in 1762 when Russia switched sides in the war. It was then reorganized into the province of East Prussia within the Kingdom of Prussia in 1773.\nThe current oblast also contains the now abandoned village of Narmeln (), which was not part of Ducal Prussia, but of the Pomeranian Voivodeship of the Kingdom of Poland until its annexation by the Kingdom of Prussia the Second Partition of Poland in 1793, and is thus part of the historic region of Pomerania.\n19th century.\nNapoleonic invasion and occupation.\nAfter the defeats of Jena\u2013Auerstedt, the Kingdom of Prussia was invaded and Berlin was occupied by the French. The Court of Prussia fled to K\u00f6nigsberg, asking for Russian help. Russia intervened, leading to the bloody Battle of Eylau and Battle of Friedland in 1807. Following a French victory in the latter, both sides signed the Treaties of Tilsit.\nHistorical ethnic and religious structure.\nIn 1817, East Prussia had 796,204 Protestants, 120,123 Catholics, 2,389 Jews, and 864 Mennonites.\nIn 1824, shortly before its merger with West Prussia, the population of East Prussia was 1,080,000 people. According to Karl Andree, Germans were slightly more than half of the people, while 280,000 (~26%) were ethnically Polish and 200,000 (~19%) were ethnically Lithuanian. As of 1819, there were also 20,000-strong ethnic Curonian and Latvian minorities as well as 2,400 Jews, according to Georg Hassel. Similar numbers are given by August von Haxthausen in his 1839 book, with a breakdown by county. However, the majority of East Prussian Polish and Lithuanian inhabitants were Lutherans, not Catholics like their ethnic kinsmen across the border in the Russian Empire. Only in southern Warmia did Catholic Poles\u2014so called Warmians (not to be confused with predominantly Protestant Masurians)\u2014comprise the majority of the population, numbering 26,067 people (~81%) in county Allenstein (Polish: Olsztyn) in 1837.\nGerman culture and Germanization.\nIn the 19th century, East Prussia was commonly viewed by German commentators as culturally backwards and a part of the \"German mission in the East\" rather than a core German territory. Pan-Germanist politician criticised the lack of folk identity and imagined community: \"It is the case that there is almost no common folk identity [Landsmannschaften] among the Poseners and Prussians at all. [...] Who can recognise a Posener or Prussian by dialect and character? Distinct features hardly exist.\" While the north of East Prussia was overwhelmingly German, the south was majority Slavic and mostly composed of Poles and Masurians. There was also a slight Lithuanian majority in the north-eastern area of East Prussia, Lithuania Minor. Regional and local identities were particularly strong in East Prussia - local Polish population often identified with Masuria rather than Poland, and Prussian Lithuanians also did not actively identify themselves with the Lithuanian nation. Moreover, confessional identity often prevailed over the national one - German authorities were concerned about the \"Catholic-Polish axis\"; German Catholics were alienated from the German nation because of the Kulturkampf legislation, and tended to support the Polish national movement. An East German newspaper \"Thorner Zeitung\" reported in 1871 that \"not only Polish Catholics, but also a great number of German Catholics, are willing to vote for a Polish party candidate\".\nBy the end of the 19th century, East Prussia had a significant Polish minority, and German nationalist circles warned of the prospect of Polonization of East Prussia. The perceived weakness of Germanness of East Prussia was also reinforced by the Ostflucht, as East Prussia suffered from both underindustrialisation and rural overpopulation. After 1876, farm prices in East Prussia fell by 20 percent, which encouraged local landowners to hire foreign workers from Congress Poland, incidentally strengthening the Polish element in the region. The increased Slavic immigration to the region generated by the requirement of the Junkers for cheap labour and better economic conditions in West Germany caused many German inhabitants to leave the region. Most Germans moved to work in the industrial heartland of western Germany, while others migrated abroad. Poles and Lithuanians of East Prussia also had much higher birth-rate and natural increase rates than the Germans, and rarely emigrated. Discussing the situation in East Prussia, Polish geographer Stanis\u0142aw Srokowski remarked:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The Poles who live in the southern and western parts of East Prussia and the Lithuanians of the north-west have succeeded better than the Germans in reconciling their mode of life with their earnings. This has, of course, led to a lower standard of life, but it has enabled them to adapt themselves to actual conditions and even to prosper where the Germans fail. Moreover, both these national minorities in East Prussia are bound to the soil by centuries of tradition: they are not comparative new-comers like the majority of the Germans there. For these reasons, the Poles and Lithuanians in that province hardly ever emigrate from the land of their birth, especially as the emigration in question is not so attractive for them as for the Germans: proceeding to central or western Germany, the former would really be going to a foreign country, amongst people not speaking their language and having other customs than theirs.\nThe Memel Territory (Klaip\u0117da region), formerly part of northeastern East Prussia as well as Prussian Lithuania, was annexed by Lithuania in 1923. In 1938, Nazi Germany radically renamed about a third of the place names of this area, replacing Old Prussian and Lithuanian names with newly invented German names.\n20th century.\nWorld War I and II.\nIn September 1914, after hostilities began between the German Empire on the one hand and France and Russia on the other, the Imperial German Army was about to seize Paris, and the French urged Russia to attack East Prussia. Nicholas II launched a major attack, resulting in a Russian victory in the Battle of Gumbinnen. The Russian army arrived at the outskirts of the city of K\u00f6nigsberg but did not take it and settled at Insterburg. This Russian victory and East Prussia's occupation by Russia saved Paris by forcing the Germans to send many troops to their East provinces. Later, Hindenburg and Ludendorff pushed Russia back at the battle of Tannenberg, thereby liberating East Prussia from Russian troops. Yet Russian troops remained in the easternmost part of the region until early 1915.\nDuring World War II, the Hohenbruch concentration camp was operated at modern Gromovo mostly interring Polish prisoners, as well as several subcamps of the Stutthof concentration camp, the Oflag 52, Oflag 60 and Dulag Luft prisoner-of-war camps, and a camp interring Romani people in K\u00f6nigsberg (see \"Romani Holocaust\").\nOn 29 August 1944, Soviet troops reached the border of East Prussia. By January 1945, they had taken all of East Prussia except for the area around K\u00f6nigsberg. Many inhabitants fled west at this time. During the last days of the war, over two million people fled, anticipating imminent Red Army conquest, and were evacuated by sea.\nSoviet annexation.\nInitially, at the end of World War II in 1945, the current southern border strip passed under Polish control with Polish administration organized in the towns of Gierdawy and I\u0142awka, however, the area was eventually annexed by the Soviet Union and included within the Kaliningrad Oblast.\nUnder the Potsdam Agreement of 1 August 1945, K\u00f6nigsberg became part of the Soviet Union pending the final determination of territorial borders at an anticipated peace settlement. This final determination eventually took place on 12 September 1990 when the Treaty on the Final Settlement with Respect to Germany was signed. The excerpt from the initial agreement pertaining to the partition of East Prussia, including the area surrounding K\u00f6nigsberg, is as follows (note that K\u00f6nigsberg is spelt \"Koenigsberg\" in the original document):\nVI. CITY OF KOENIGSBERG AND THE ADJACENT AREAThe Conference examined a proposal by the Soviet Government that pending the final determination of territorial questions at the peace settlement, the section of the western frontier of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics which is adjacent to the Baltic Sea should pass from a point on the eastern shore of the Bay of Danzig to the east, north of Braunsberg\u00a0\u2013 Goldep, to the meeting point of the frontiers of Lithuania, the Polish Republic and East Prussia.\nThe Conference has agreed in principle to the proposal of the Soviet Government concerning the ultimate transfer to the Soviet Union of the city of Koenigsberg and the area adjacent to it as described above, subject to expert examination of the actual frontier.\nU.S. president Harry Truman and British prime minister Clement Attlee supported the proposal of the Conference at the forthcoming peace settlement.\nIn 1946, K\u00f6nigsberg was added as a semi-exclave to the Russian SFSR and renamed Kaliningrad, after the Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR Mikhail Kalinin. Kalinin was unrelated to the city, and there were already cities named in honour of Kalinin in the Soviet Union, namely \"Kalinin\" (now Tver) and \"Kaliningrad\" (now Korolev, Moscow Oblast). The German language was replaced with the Russian language, and the remaining German population was expelled between 1947 and 1948. The territory was then re-populated with Soviet citizens, mostly ethnic Russians but to a lesser extent also Ukrainians and Belarusians.\nSome historians speculate that it may have originally been offered to the Lithuanian SSR because the resolution from the conference specifies that Kaliningrad's border would be at the (pre-war) Lithuanian frontier. According to some historians, Joseph Stalin created it as an oblast separate from the Lithuanian SSR because it further separated the Baltic states from the West. Others think that the reason was that the region was far too strategic for the USSR to leave it in the hands of another SSR other than the Russian one. In the 1950s, Nikita Khrushchev offered the entire Kaliningrad Oblast to the Lithuanian SSR but Antanas Snie\u010dkus refused to accept the territory because it would add at least a million ethnic Russians to Lithuania proper.\nIn the Soviet era, the city was completely closed and, with the exception of rare visits of friendship from neighboring Poland, it was practically not visited by foreigners. In 1950, there were 1,165,000 inhabitants, which was only half the number of the pre-war population. The old city was not restored, and the ruins of the K\u00f6nigsberg Castle were demolished in the late 1960s, on Leonid Brezhnev's personal orders, despite the protests of architects, historians and residents of the city. \nThe reconstruction of the oblast, threatened by hunger in the immediate post-war years, was carried out through an ambitious policy of oceanic fishing with the creation of one of the main fishing harbours of the USSR in Kaliningrad city. Fishing not only fed the regional economy but also was a basis for social and scientific development, in particular oceanography. From 1953 to 1962, a monument to Stalin stood on Victory Square. In 1973, the town hall was turned into the House of Soviets. In 1975, the trolleybus was launched again. In 1980, a concert hall was opened in the building of the former Lutheran Church of the Holy Family. In 1986, the Kreuzkirche building was transferred to the Russian Orthodox Church.\nIn 1957, an agreement was signed and later came into force which delimited the border between the Polish People's Republic (a Soviet satellite state at the time) and the Soviet Union.\nIn 2010, the German magazine \"Der Spiegel\" published a report claiming that Kaliningrad had been offered to Germany in 1990 (against payment). The offer was not seriously considered by the West German government which, at the time, saw reunification with East Germany as a higher priority. However, this story was later denied by Mikhail Gorbachev.\nRecent history.\nThe independence of Lithuania in 1990 and full dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991 isolated Kaliningrad from the rest of Russia, having previously been joined by other Soviet republics. This isolation became more severe when both Poland and Lithuania joined NATO and the European Union and imposed strict border controls on Kaliningrad Oblast. All military and civilian land links between the region and the rest of Russia now must pass through members of NATO and the EU. Thus far, the EU has rejected Russian proposals for visa-free travel between Kaliningrad and the rest of Russia. Travel arrangements based on the \"Facilitated Transit Document (FTD)\" and \"Facilitated Rail Transit Document (FRTD)\" have been made. Kaliningrad Oblast's geographic isolation has badly affected its economic situation. Concurrent significant reduction in the size of the Russian military garrison has hurt as well, since previously the military was a major local employer.\nSome of the region's cultural heritage, most notably the K\u00f6nigsberg Cathedral, was restored in the 1990s, as citizens started to examine previously ignored German past.\nOn 12 January 1996, Kaliningrad Oblast and Sverdlovsk Oblast became the first oblasts of Russia to sign a power-sharing treaty with the federal government, granting them autonomy. However, this agreement was abolished on 31 May 2002.\nAfter 1991, some ethnic Germans emigrated to the area, such as Volga Germans from other parts of Russia and Kazakhstan. These Germans are overwhelmingly Russian-speaking and as such were rejected for resettlement within Germany under Germany's new rules. A similar migration by Poles from the lands of the former Soviet Union to the Kaliningrad Oblast occurred at this time as well. The situation has begun to change, albeit slowly. Germany, Lithuania, and Poland have renewed contact with Kaliningrad Oblast, through town twinning and other projects. This has helped to promote interest in the history and culture of the East Prussian and Lietuvininkai communities.\nIn July 2007, Russian First Deputy Prime Minister Sergei Ivanov declared that if US-controlled missile defense systems were deployed in Poland, then nuclear weapons might be deployed in Kaliningrad. On 5 November 2008, Russian president Dmitry Medvedev said that installing missiles in Kaliningrad was almost a certainty. These plans were suspended in January 2009, but implemented in October 2016. In 2011, a long-range Voronezh radar was commissioned to monitor missile launches within about . The radar is situated in the settlement of Pionersky in Kaliningrad Oblast.\nA few months after the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, Lithuania started implementing EU sanctions, which blocked about 50% of the goods being imported into Kaliningrad by rail. Food, medicine, and passenger travel were exempted. Russia protested against the sanctions and announced it would increase shipments by sea. In May 2023, Poland officially adopted a new name for the Kaliningrad region, changing it from \"Obw\u00f3d Kaliningradzki\" to \"Obw\u00f3d Kr\u00f3lewiecki\", \"Kr\u00f3lewiec\" being the historical Polish name for the city of Kaliningrad. The reason given for the change is that Mikhail Kalinin, a member of the Soviet Politburo, was among those responsible for the Katyn massacre, having co-signed the order to murder thousands of Polish prisoners of war.\nGeography.\nKaliningrad is the only Russian Baltic Sea port that is ice-free all year and hence plays an important role in the maintenance of the country's Baltic Fleet.\nThe oblast is mainly flat, as the highest point is the Gora Dozor hill near the tripoint of the Poland\u2013Russia border/Lithuania\u2013Russia border.\nAs an exclave of Russia, it is surrounded by Poland (Pomeranian and Warmian-Masurian Voivodeships), Lithuania (Klaip\u0117da, Marijampol\u0117, and Taurag\u0117 Counties) and the Baltic Sea. It can be considered a semi-exclave or semi-enclave because it has sea access. The end of the river Neman forms part of the Lithuania\u2013Russia border.\nNotable geographical features include the Curonian Lagoon (shared with Lithuania) and the Vistula Lagoon (shared with Poland). The oblast's largest river is the Pregolya. The river starts as a confluence of the Instruch and the Angrapa and drains into the Baltic Sea through the Vistula Lagoon. Its length, strictly under the name \"Pregolya\", is ; when including the Angrapa, is it long.\nMajor cities and towns include:\n\u2020 Pre-1946 (the German-language names were also used in English in this period)\nClimate.\nThe climate of Kaliningrad Oblast gradually transitions from oceanic to humid continental depending on distance from the Baltic Sea moderation. It remains very mild by Russian standards with winters above freezing without the hot summers associated with the Russian interior on similar latitudes. The local climate is slightly wetter than similar latitudes farther west, but infrequent ice days lead to low snow accumulation regardless.\nPolitics.\nAnton Alikhanov was governor of Kaliningrad Oblast from 2017 until May 2024, when he was appointed as Minister of Industry and Trade. \nThe region's legislative body is the 40-seat Kaliningrad Oblast Duma.\nDemographics.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Module:Historical populations/styles.css\"/&gt;\nPopulation.\nAs of the 2021 census, the population of the oblast was 1,027,678. Earlier censuses recorded a population of 955,281 in 2002 and 871,283 in 1989.\nEthnic groups.\nAccording to the 2021 census, the ethnic composition of the oblast was as follows:\nTotal fertility rate\nVital statistics for 2024:\nTotal fertility rate (2024):\n1.20 children per woman\nLife expectancy (2021): \nTotal \u2014 70.99 years (male\u00a0\u2014 66.51, female\u00a0\u2014 75.25)\nReligion.\nAccording to a 2012 survey, 34% of the population of Kaliningrad Oblast declared themselves to be \"spiritual but not religious\", 30.9% adhered to the Russian Orthodox Church, 22% were atheist, and 11.1% followed other religions or did not answer the question, 1% were unaffiliated generic Christians, and 1% were Roman Catholic.\nUntil 1945, the region was overwhelmingly Lutheran, with a small number of Roman Catholics and Jews. The state church of Prussia was dominant in the region. Although it had been both Reformed and Lutheran since 1817, there was an overwhelming Lutheran majority and very few Reformed adherents in East Prussia.\nEconomy.\nIn 2022, the gross regional domestic product of Kaliningrad Oblast was \u20bd738 billion or US$10.6 billion and around US$10,000 per capita.\nThe existence of the oblast's ice-free port and proximity to the European Union are economic advantages. It also has the world's largest deposits of amber. The region has developed its tourism infrastructure and promotes attractions such as the Curonian Spit.\nTo address the oblast's high rate of unemployment, in 1996 Russian authorities granted the oblast a special economic status that provided tax incentives intended to attract investors. The oblast's economy benefited substantially and boomed. A US$45\u00a0million airport terminal was opened. The European Commission provided funds for business projects under its special program for the region. Both economic output and trade with the countries of the EU increased.\nIndustry.\nCar and truck assembly (GM, BMW, Kia, Yuejin by Avtotor) and the production of auto parts are major industries in Kaliningrad Oblast. There are shipbuilding facilities in Kaliningrad and Sovetsk. Food processing is a mature industry in the region, with Miratorg operating a sizeable food processing factory. OKB Fakel, a world leader in the field of Hall thruster development, as well as a leading Russian developer and manufacturer of electric propulsion systems, is based in Neman. The company employs 960 people. General Satellite (GS) is the biggest employer in Gusev city, manufacturing products such as satellite receivers, cardboard packaging, and nanomaterials.\nNatural resources.\nMore than 90% of the world's known amber deposits are in Kaliningrad Oblast. Because of this, many Russians refer to the region as \"Amber Land\" (). Until recently, raw amber was exported for processing to other countries. In 2013, the Russian government banned the export of raw amber in order to boost the amber processing industry in Russia.\nThere are small oil reservoirs beneath the Baltic Sea not far from Kaliningrad's shore. Small-scale offshore exploration started in 2004. Poland, Lithuania, and some local NGOs voiced concerns about possible environmental effects.\nFishing.\nFishing is an important regional industry, with big fishing ports in Kaliningrad and Pionersky. There are smaller fishing ports in Svetly and Rybachy.\nPower generation.\nWith the desynchronization of the electricity systems of Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia from the Russian UPS synchronous area in February 2025, and their subsequent connection to the Continental Europe Synchronous Area (CESA) via Poland, the Kaliningrad electrical grid became islanded from any other system.\nAverage yearly power consumption in the Kaliningrad Oblast was 3.5\u00a0TWh in 2004, of which local power generation provided just 0.235\u00a0TWh. The balance was imported from neighbouring countries. A new Kaliningrad power station was built in 2005, providing 50% of the oblast's energy needs. This station was expanded in 2010, making the oblast independent from electricity imports.\nIn 2008, planning began for the construction of two nuclear power reactors, with costs estimated at \u20ac5\u00a0billion (US$8\u00a0billion). The project was suspended in May 2013. In 2014, the project was abandoned in response to environmental concerns and lack of support.\nLNG from St. Petersburg supplied some of the energy in the Oblast.\nAgriculture.\nThe grain blight \"Fusarium graminearum\" in the oblast is genetically 3ADON, like the blight's strain in Finland and Saint Petersburg. The researchers who discovered the genetic commonality speculate the cause may be a shared population that is distinct from other \"F.graminearum\" populations elsewhere.\nReferences.\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nGeneral and cited sources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

According to the traditional account, he inherited the throne of D\u00e1l Riada from his father Alp\u00edn mac Echdach, founder of the Alp\u00ednid dynasty. Kenneth I conquered the kingdom of the Picts in 843\u2013850 and began a campaign to seize and assimilate the Picts, for which he was posthumously nicknamed \"An Ferbasach\" (\"The Conqueror\"). He fought the Britons of the Kingdom of Strathclyde and the invading Vikings from Scandinavia. Forteviot became the capital of his kingdom and Kenneth relocated relics, including the Stone of Scone from the abandoned abbey on Iona, to his new domain.\nKenneth I is traditionally considered the founder of Scotland, which was then known as Alba in Gaelic, although like his immediate successors, he bore the title of King of the Picts. It was Donald II that first bore the title of King of Alba as recorded by the Annals of Ulster and the Chronicon Scotorum. One chronicle calls Kenneth the first Scottish lawgiver but there is no information about the laws he passed.\nOrigin.\nAccording to the genealogy of the Scottish kings, Kenneth's father was Alp\u00edn mac Echdach, the King of D\u00e1l Riada, which existed in what is now western Scotland. Alp\u00edn is considered to be the grandson of \u00c1ed Find, a descendant of Cen\u00e9l nGabr\u00e1in, who ruled in D\u00e1l Riada. The \"Synchronism of the Irish Kings\" lists Alp\u00edn among the kings of Scotland. Modern historians are sceptical about the reign of Alp\u00edn in D\u00e1l Riada and his relationship with \u00c1ed, and believe this misconception is the result of negligence on the part of the scribes in some texts. The genealogy of the kings of Scotland and D\u00e1l Riada dates back to an original manuscript that was written during the reign of Malcolm III in the mid-to-late 11th century. The Rawlinson B 502 manuscript provides the following ancestry for Kenneth:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;... son of son of son of son of son of son of son of son of son of son of ...\nThere is very limited information about Alp\u00edn, Kenneth's father. Some of D\u00e1l Riada's royal lists, which contain many scribal errors, say he ruled from 841 to 843. The \"Chronicle of Huntingdon\", which was written in the late 13th century, states Alp\u00edn defeated the Picts at Galloway but the Picts then defeated him in a battle that took place in the same year, during which Alp\u00edn was killed. According to the chronicle, Alp\u00edn died on 20 July 834. This date is given in other sources but several researchers claim the date was probably copied from another source and the year of his death was obtained by recalculating the dates in the erroneous royal lists so they attribute Alp\u00edn's date of death to 840 or 841.\nKenneth's grandmother (Alpin's mother), is said to have been a Pictish princess, the sister of Constantine I and \u00d3engus II. According to the Pictish tradition, a female representative of the royal dynasty could inherit the crown. This origin gave Kenneth a legitimate claim to the Pictish throne.\nKenneth I had at least one brother, Donald I, who succeeded him as king.\nLife and reign.\nEarly years.\nKenneth MacAlpin is believed to have been born around 810 on the island of Iona, which is part of modern-day Scotland. After his father's death, Kenneth succeeded him as the King of D\u00e1l Riada. His coronation took place in 840 or 841. One of the main sources on Kenneth's life is the 10th century \"Chronicle of the Kings of Alba\" which describes the reigns of Scottish kings from Kenneth I to Kenneth II (r.\u2009971\u00a0\u2013\u00a0995).\nConquest of Pictavia.\nAccording to the \"Chronicle of the Kings of Alba\", Kenneth came to a region that was inhabited by the Picts, during the second year of his reign in D\u00e1l Riada. Having defeated the Picts, Kenneth ruled there for 16 years. According to the \"Annals of Ulster\", compiled in the 15th century, he became the King of the Picts in 842 or 843 and died in 858. Although some sources state Kenneth ruled the Picts from 841 to 856, according to the \"Chronicle of Melrose\", he became king in 843, a date that is generally accepted by most modern-day historians.\nIn the first half of the 9th century, the geopolitical situation in D\u00e1l Riada deteriorated. Almost the entire territory of the kingdom was mountainous and was filled with uneasy terrain. Kenneth's realm lay between the powerful Kingdom of Strathclyde in the south and the Druim Alban mountain ridge in the east. It was difficult to pass through the provinces of D\u00e1l Riada, most of the land was infertile, and the kingdom had lost its western territories in the Hebrides to the Vikings, who had settled in the area and were raiding the borders of D\u00e1l Riada. These conditions may have forced Kenneth to attack the Picts.\nAfter the death of E\u00f3ganan mac \u00d3engusa in the Battle of 839, Uurad, and then Bridei VI succeeded him as the King of the Picts. According to List One, Uurad's reign lasted three years, while Bridei VI reigned for a year. According to List Two, Uurad reigned for two years, while Bridei VI's reign lasted a month. The reigns of Uurad's three sons were also present in List Two. Based on these accounts, the Pictish kingdom fell in 849 or 850. Many sources dating to the following periods state that the historical kingdom of the Picts and the Scots unified in 850. List Two states that the last Pictish King was killed in Forteviot or Scone. This is probably a reference to MacAlpin's treason, a medieval legend first recorded in the 12th century by Giraldus Cambrensis. According to the legend, a Pictish nobleman is invited by the Scots to a meeting or a feast in Scone and is treacherously killed there. At the same time, List One gives the year 843 as the date when Kenneth received the title of King of the Picts.\nSources do not detail Kenneth's conquest of Pictavia. No chronicle mentions either Kenneth's continuing his father's campaign against the Picts or his supposed claim to the Pictish crown. Modern-day historians suggest Kenneth was a descendant of Pictish kings through his mother or had ties with them through his wife. Kenneth's grandmother (Alpin's mother), was also said to have been a Pictish princess, the sister of Constantine I and \u00d3engus II. It is likely the death of E\u00f3gananhe, \"Chronicle of Huntingdon\" gives the following interpretation of the events that took place after E\u00f3ganan's death:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Kynadius [Kenneth] succeeded his father Alpin in his kingdom, and that in the seventh year of his reign [the year 839], while the Danish pirates, having occupied the Pictish shores, had crushed the Picts, who were defending themselves, with a great slaughter, Kynadius, passing into their remaining territories, turned his arms against them, and having slain many, compelled them to take flight, and was the first king of the Scots who acquired the monarchy of the whole of Alban, and ruled in it over the Scots.\nIt is likely Kenneth killed the Pictish leaders and destroyed their armies during his conquest of Pictavia, after which he devastated the whole country. The \"Annals of the Four Masters\" record a single battle during Kenneth's campaign, which according to Isabel Henderson, proves the Picts did not show any significant resistance to Kenneth's forces, however, more evidence will have to be presented.\nKing of Alba.\nAccording to historical tradition, a new kingdom was formed after Kenneth annexed the kingdom of the Picts. This kingdom's Gaelic name was Alba, which was later replaced with Scotia and Scotland. The rulers of the kingdom initially held the title of King of Alba, however in reality it wasn't until at least 42 years after Kenneth's death that the title King of Alba was ever used. Kenneth is retroactively listed in the royal lists dating to later periods as the first King of Scotland; modern historians, however, argue the final unification of the kingdom took place half a century later and that Kenneth's main political achievement should be considered the creation of a new dynasty. This dynasty sought to dominate all of Scotland, under which the Scots assimilated the Picts, resulting in the quick disappearance of the Picts' language and institutions.\nAfter the conquest of Pictavia, the Scots from D\u00e1l Riada began to migrate \"en masse\" to the territories populated by the Picts. The list of Pictish kings concludes in 850 and the list of kings of D\u00e1l Riada also ends around the same time, meaning the title ceased to exist. Kenneth I and his administration moved to Pictavia; it is possible the Scots moved to the region before the war and that such settlements played a major role in the selection of Scone as the capital of the Kingdom. Kenneth moved relics from an abandoned abbey on Iona, where Viking raids made life untenable, to Dunkeld, which was the centre of the Church of Scotland, in 848 or 849, according to the \"Chronicle of the Kings of Alba\". The coronation stone was also moved from the island to Scone, for which it is referred to as the Stone of Scone. According to archaeological excavations, Forteviot was probably originally a royal residence but the place is not mentioned in the chronicles after the death of Donald I. The mass migration of Scots to the east most likely led to the assimilation of the Picts. Although the Irish annals, which date to the late 9th century, mention the title King of the Picts, the Picts may not have remained independent. The Pictish civil system and clerical laws were completely replaced with the Scottish legal system, and it is likely similar changes occurred in other spheres of the Pictish society. The Picts did not revolt against this assimilation process.\nThe \"Chronicle of the Kings of Alba\" describes the events that occurred during Kenneth's reign without specifying their dates. He invaded Lothian in the Kingdom of Northumbria six times, and captured the towns of Melrose and Dunbar, and razed them. The Celtic Britons from the Kingdom of Strathclyde attacked Kenneth's kingdom and burnt Dunblane. Furthermore, Viking invaders raided Pictavia, ravaging the territories \"from Clunie to Dunkeld\".\nKenneth strengthened his power by arranging royal marriages with neighbouring states, marrying his daughters to the kings of Strathclyde and Ireland. According to the \"Chronicle of Melrose\", Kenneth was one of the first Scottish lawgivers but his laws have not survived to the 21st century.\nDeath and succession.\nAccording to the \"Annals of Ulster\", Kenneth died in 858. The \"Chronicle of the Kings of Alba\" states he died in February in Forteviot due to a tumour. Historians suggest this date might be 13 February. Kenneth was buried in Iona Abbey. Succession in the kingdom was carried out in the form of tanistry so Kenneth's successor was his brother Donald I rather than his eldest son. After the death of Donald I, Kenneth's sons, Causant\u00edn mac Cin\u00e1eda and \u00c1ed mac Cin\u00e1eda, inherited the crown. The Alp\u00ednid dynasty, which ruled Scotland until the beginning of the 11th century, was formed during this period.\nContemporaneous Irish annals give Kenneth and his immediate successors the title King of the Picts, but do not call him the King of Fortriu, a title that was only given to four Pictish kings who reigned in the 7th to 9th centuries. It is possible the use of the title of King of the Picts was in reference to Kenneth and his immediate successors' claim to all of Pictavia, though there is very little evidence of the extent of their domain.\nFamily.\nThe name of Kenneth's wife is unknown.

While at the Los Alamos Laboratory, Fuchs was responsible for many significant theoretical calculations relating to the first nuclear weapons and, later, early models of the hydrogen bomb. After his conviction in 1950, he served nine years in prison in the United Kingdom, then migrated to East Germany where he resumed his career as a physicist and scientific leader.\nThe son of a Lutheran pastor, Fuchs attended the University of Leipzig, where his father was a professor of theology, and became involved in student politics, joining the student branch of the Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD), and the \"Reichsbanner Schwarz-Rot-Gold\", an SPD-allied paramilitary organisation. He was expelled from the SPD in 1932, and joined the Communist Party of Germany (KPD). He went into hiding after the 1933 Reichstag fire and the subsequent persecution of communists in Nazi Germany, and fled to the United Kingdom, where he received his PhD from the University of Bristol under the supervision of Nevill Francis Mott, and his DSc from the University of Edinburgh, where he worked as an assistant to Max Born.\nAfter the Second World War broke out in Europe, he was interned in the Isle of Man, and later in Canada. After he returned to Britain in 1941, he became an assistant to Rudolf Peierls, working on \"Tube Alloys\"\u2014the British atomic bomb project. He began passing information on the project to the Soviet Union through Ursula Kuczynski, codenamed \"Sonya\", a German communist and a major in Soviet military intelligence who had worked with Richard Sorge's spy ring in the Far East. In 1943, Fuchs and Peierls went to Columbia University, in New York City, to work on the Manhattan Project. In August 1944, Fuchs joined the Theoretical Physics Division at the Los Alamos Laboratory, working under Hans Bethe. His chief area of expertise was the problem of implosion, necessary for the development of the plutonium bomb. After the war, he returned to the UK and worked at the Atomic Energy Research Establishment at Harwell as head of the Theoretical Physics Division.\nIn January 1950, Fuchs confessed that he had passed information to the Soviets over a seven-year period beginning in 1942. A British court sentenced him to fourteen years' imprisonment and he was subsequently stripped of his British citizenship. He was released in 1959, after serving nine years, and migrated to the German Democratic Republic (East Germany), where he was elected to the Academy of Sciences and became a member of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany (SED) central committee. He was later appointed deputy director of the Central Institute for Nuclear Physics in Dresden, where he served until his retirement in 1979.\nPost Cold War declassified information states that the Russians freely acknowledged that Fuchs gave them the fission bomb.\nEarly life.\nKlaus Emil Julius Fuchs was born in R\u00fcsselsheim, Grand Duchy of Hesse, on 29 December 1911, the third of four children of a Lutheran pastor, Emil Fuchs, and his wife Else Wagner. His father served in the army during World War I but later became a pacifist and a socialist, joining the Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD) in 1912. He eventually became a Quaker. Fuchs had an older brother Gerhard, an older sister Elisabeth, and a younger sister, Kristel. The family moved to Eisenach, where Fuchs attended the \"Martin-Luther Gymnasium\", and took his \"Abitur\". At school, Fuchs and his siblings were taunted over his father's unpopular socialist political views, which they came to share. They became known as the \"red foxes\", Fuchs being the German word for fox.\nFuchs was left-handed, but was forced to write with his right hand.\nFuchs entered the University of Leipzig in 1930, where his father was a professor of theology. He became involved in student politics, joining the student branch of the SPD, a party that his father had joined in 1921, and the \"Reichsbanner Schwarz-Rot-Gold\", the party's paramilitary organisation. His father took up a new position as professor of religion at the Pedagogical Academy in Kiel, and in the autumn Fuchs transferred to the University of Kiel, which his brother Gerhard and sister Elisabeth also attended. Fuchs continued his studies in mathematics and physics at the university. In October 1931, his mother committed suicide by drinking hydrochloric acid. The family later discovered that his maternal grandmother had also taken her own life.\nIn the March 1932 German presidential election, the SPD supported Paul von Hindenburg for President, fearing that a split vote would hand the job to the Nazi Party (NSDAP) candidate, Adolf Hitler. However, when the Communist Party of Germany (KPD) ran its own candidate, Ernst Th\u00e4lmann, Fuchs offered to speak for him, and was expelled from the SPD. That year Fuchs and all three of his siblings joined the KPD. Fuchs and his brother Gerhard were active speakers at public meetings, and occasionally attempted to disrupt NSDAP gatherings. At one such gathering, Fuchs was beaten up and thrown into a river.\nWhen Hitler became Chancellor of Germany in January 1933, Fuchs decided to leave Kiel, where the NSDAP was particularly strong and he was a well-known KPD member. He enrolled at the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Physics in Berlin. On 28 February, while on a train to Berlin for a secret KPD meeting, he read a newspaper article on the Reichstag fire. Fuchs correctly assumed that opposition parties would be blamed for the fire, and surreptitiously removed his hammer and sickle lapel pin. Fellow party members urged him to continue his studies in another country. He went into hiding for five months in the apartment of a fellow party member. In August 1933, he attended an anti-fascist conference in Paris chaired by Henri Barbusse, where he met an English couple, Ronald and Jessie Gunn, who invited him to stay with them in Clapton, Somerset. He was expelled from the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute in October 1933.\nRefugee in Britain.\nFuchs arrived in England on 24 September 1933. Jessie Gunn was a member of the Wills family, the heirs to Imperial Tobacco and benefactors of the University of Bristol. She arranged for Fuchs to meet Nevill Francis Mott, Bristol's professor of physics, and he agreed to take Fuchs on as a research assistant. Fuchs earned his PhD in physics there in 1937. A paper on \"A Quantum Mechanical Calculation of the Elastic Constants of Monovalent Metals\" was published in the \"Proceedings of the Royal Society\" in 1936. By this time, Mott had a number of German refugees working for him, and lacked positions for them all. He did not think that Fuchs would make much of a teacher, so he arranged a research post for Fuchs, at the University of Edinburgh working under Max Born, who was himself a German refugee. Fuchs published papers with Born on \"The Statistical Mechanics of Condensing Systems\" and \"On Fluctuations in Electromagnetic radiation\" in the \"Proceedings of the Royal Society\". He also received a Doctorate in Science degree from Edinburgh. Fuchs proudly posted copies back to his father, Emil, in Germany.\nIn Germany, Emil had been dismissed from his academic post, and, disillusioned with the Lutheran Church's support of the NSDAP, had become a Quaker in 1933. He was arrested for speaking out against the government and was held for a month. His daughter, Elisabeth, married a fellow communist, Gustav Kittowski, with whom she had a child they named Klaus. Elisabeth and Kittowski were arrested in 1933, and sentenced to 18 months imprisonment but were freed at Christmas. Emil's son, Gerhard, and his wife Karin were arrested in 1934 and spent the next two years in prison. Gerhard, Karin, Elisabeth and Kittowski established a car rental agency in Berlin, which they used to smuggle Jews and opponents of the government out of Germany.\nAfter Emil was arrested in 1933, his other daughter, Kristel, fled to Zurich, where she studied education and psychology at the University of Zurich. She returned to Berlin in 1934, where she too worked at the car rental agency. In 1936, Emil arranged with Quaker friends in the United States for Kristel to attend Swarthmore College there. She visited her brother, Klaus Fuchs, in England \"en route\" to America, where she eventually married an American communist, Robert Heineman, and settled in Cambridge, Massachusetts. She became a permanent resident in the United States in May 1938. In 1936, Kittowski and Elisabeth were arrested again, and the rental cars were impounded. Gerhard and Karin fled to Czechoslovakia. Elisabeth was released and went to live with her father, Emil, while Kittowski, sentenced to six years, later escaped from prison and also made his way to Czechoslovakia. In August 1939, Elisabeth died by suicide by throwing herself off a bridge in the path of an oncoming train, leaving Emil to raise her young son, Klaus.\nSecond World War.\nFuchs applied to become a British subject in August 1939, but his application had not been processed before the Second World War broke out in Europe in September 1939. There was a classification system for enemy aliens, but Born provided Fuchs with a reference that said that he had been a member of the SPD from 1930 to 1932, and an anti-Nazi. There matters stood until June 1940, when the police arrived and took Fuchs into custody. He was first interned on the Isle of Man and then, in July, he was sent to internment camps in Canada, first on the Plains of Abraham in Quebec City and later at a site near Sherbrooke, Quebec. During his internment in 1940, he continued to work and published four more papers with Born: \"The Mass Centre in Relativity\", \"Reciprocity, Part II: Scalar Wave Functions\", \"Reciprocity, Part III: Reciprocal Wave Functions\" and \"Reciprocity, Part IV: Spinor Wave Functions\", and one by himself, \"On the Statistical Method in Nuclear Theory\".\nWhile interned in Quebec, he joined a communist discussion group led by Hans Kahle. Kahle was a KPD member who had fought in the Spanish Civil War. After fleeing to Britain with his family, Kahle had helped J\u00fcrgen Kuczynski organise the KPD in Britain. Kristel arranged for mathematics professor Israel Halperin, the brother-in-law of a friend of hers, Wendell H. Furry, to send Fuchs some magazines, likely scientific journals. Max Born lobbied for his release. On Christmas Day 1940, Fuchs and Kahle were among the first group of internees to board a ship to return to Britain.\nFuchs returned to Edinburgh in January, and resumed working for Born. In May 1941, he was approached by Rudolf Peierls of the University of Birmingham to work on the \"Tube Alloys\" programme \u2013 the British atomic bomb research project. Despite wartime restrictions, he became a British subject on 31 July 1942 and signed an Official Secrets Act declaration form. As accommodation was scarce in wartime Birmingham, he stayed with Rudolf and Genia Peierls. Fuchs and Peierls did some important work together, which included a fundamental paper about isotope separation.\nSoon after, Fuchs contacted J\u00fcrgen Kuczynski, who was now teaching at the London School of Economics. Kuczynski put him in contact with Simon Davidovitch Kremer (codename: \"Alexander\"; 1900-1991), the secretary to the military attach\u00e9 at the Soviet Union's embassy, who worked for the GRU (Russian: \"\u0413\u043b\u0430\u0432\u043d\u043e\u0435 \u0420\u0430\u0437\u0432\u0435\u0434\u044b\u0432\u0430\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e\u0435 \u0423\u043f\u0440\u0430\u0432\u043b\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435\"), the Red Army's foreign military intelligence directorate. After three meetings, Fuchs was teamed up with a courier so he would not have to find excuses to travel to London. She was Ursula Kuczynski (codename: \"Sonya\"), the sister of J\u00fcrgen Kuczynski. She was a German communist, a major in Soviet Military Intelligence and an experienced agent who had worked with Richard Sorge's spy ring in the Far East.\nIn late 1943, Fuchs (codename: \"Rest\"; he became \"Charles\" in May 1944), transferred along with Peierls to Columbia University, in New York City, to work on gaseous diffusion as a means of uranium enrichment for the Manhattan Project. Although Fuchs was \"an asset\" of GRU in Britain, his \"control\" was transferred to the NKGB (Russian: \"\u041d\u0430\u0440\u043e\u0434\u043d\u044b\u0439 K\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0441\u0441\u0430\u0440\u0438\u0430\u0442 \u0413\u043e\u0441\u0443\u0434\u0430\u0440\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0435\u043d\u043d\u043e\u0439 \u0411\u0435\u0437\u043e\u043f\u0430\u0441\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0438\"), the Soviet Union's civilian intelligence organisation, when he moved to New York. He spent Christmas 1943 with Kristel and her family in Cambridge. He was contacted by Harry Gold (codename: \"Raymond\"), an NKGB agent in early 1944.\nFrom August 1944, Fuchs worked in the Theoretical Physics Division at the Los Alamos Laboratory, under Hans Bethe. His chief area of expertise was the problem of imploding the fissionable core of the plutonium bomb. At one point, Fuchs did calculation work that Edward Teller had refused to do because of lack of interest. He was the author of techniques (such as the still-used Fuchs-Nordheim method) for calculating the energy of a fissile assembly that goes highly prompt critical, and his report on blast waves is still considered a classic. Fuchs was one of the many Los Alamos scientists present at the Trinity test in July 1945.\nSocially, Fuchs was later judged as someone who kept to himself, and never talked about politics. He was fairly well-liked. He dated grade school teachers Evelyn Kline and Jean Parker, and occasionally served as a babysitter for other scientists. He befriended Richard Feynman. Fuchs and Peierls were the only members of the British Mission to Los Alamos who owned cars, and Fuchs lent his Buick to Feynman so Feynman could visit his dying wife in a hospital in Albuquerque. When Fuchs was discovered to be a spy, his former colleagues were shocked. The postwar director of Los Alamos, Norris Bradbury, later said that:\nFuchs was a strange man. I knew him, though not well. A very popular, very reticent bachelor, who was welcome at parties because of his nice manners. He worked very hard; worked very hard for us, for this country. His trouble was that he worked very hard for Russia, too. Basically, he hated the Germans bitterly. He had an undying hatred and he simply thought this country was not working hard enough to assist the Russians to defeat the Germans. Well, he was in his own odd way loyal to the United States. He suffered from a double loyalty.\nFuchs's main courier in the United States was Harry Gold, a chemist who lived in Philadelphia, but was willing to travel to wherever Fuchs was. Allen Weinstein, the author of \"The Haunted Wood: Soviet Espionage in America\" (1999), has pointed out: \"The NKVD had chosen Gold, an experienced group handler, as Fuchs's contact on the grounds that it was safer than having him meet directly with a Russian operative, but Semyon Semyonov was ultimately responsible for the Fuchs relationship.\"\nGold reported after his first meeting with Klaus Fuchs:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;He (Fuchs) obviously worked with our people before and he is fully aware of what he is doing. \u2026 He is a mathematical physicist \u2026 most likely a very brilliant man to have such a position at his age (he looks about 30). We took a long walk after dinner. \u2026 He is a member of a British mission to the U.S. working under the direct control of the U.S. Army. \u2026 The work involves mainly separating the isotopes... and is being done thusly: The electronic method has been developed at Berkeley, California, and is being carried out at a place known only as Camp Y. \u2026 Simultaneously, the diffusion method is being tried here in the East. \u2026 Should the diffusion method prove successful, it will be used as a preliminary step in the separation, with the final work being done by the electronic method. They hope to have the electronic method ready early in 1945 and the diffusion method in July 1945, but (Fuchs) says the latter estimate is optimistic. (Fuchs) says there is much being withheld from the British. Even Niels Bohr, who is now in the country incognito as Nicholas Baker, has not been told everything. \nAfter the end of the war, in April 1946, he attended a conference at Los Alamos that discussed the possibility of a thermonuclear weapon; one month later, he filed a patent with John von Neumann, describing a thermonuclear weapon design the two had collaborated on. Though it was not a viable design, it was the first instance of the idea of radiation implosion being part of a weapon design. Radiation implosion would later become a core part of the successful Teller\u2013Ulam design for thermonuclear weapons, but its importance was not appreciated at the time. Bethe considered Fuchs \"one of the most valuable men in my division\" and \"one of the best theoretical physicists we had.\"\nPost-war activities.\nAt the request of Norris Bradbury, who had replaced Robert Oppenheimer as director of the Los Alamos Laboratory in October 1945, Fuchs stayed on at the laboratory into 1946 to help with preparations for the Operation Crossroads weapons tests. The US Atomic Energy Act of 1946 (McMahon Act) prohibited the transfer of information on nuclear research to any foreign country, including Britain, without explicit official authority, and Fuchs supplied highly classified U.S. information to nuclear scientists in Britain and to his Soviet contacts.\nAs of 2014[ [update]], British official files on Fuchs were still being withheld. As of 2020[ [update]], the National Archives listed one dossier on Fuchs, KV 2/1263, including the \"Prosecution file. With summary of early interrogations ... and details of the scientific/technical information passed to the Russians\". The date of release of this material was not stated. According to an October 2020 book review, author Nancy Thorndike Greenspan \"appears to have had access to some of the Fuchs files that have been withheld at Kew, such as the AB/1 series, which has been closed for access for most human beings\".\nFuchs was highly regarded as a scientist by the British, who wanted him to return to the United Kingdom to work on Britain's postwar nuclear weapons programme. He returned in August 1946 and became the head of the Theoretical Physics Division at the Atomic Energy Research Establishment at Harwell. From late 1947 to May 1949 he gave Alexander Feklisov, his Soviet case officer, the principal theoretical outline for creating a hydrogen bomb and the initial drafts for its development as the work progressed in England and America. Meeting with Feklisov six times, he provided the results of the test at Eniwetok Atoll of uranium and plutonium bombs and the key data on production of uranium-235.\nAlso in 1947, Fuchs attended a conference of the Combined Policy Committee (CPC), which was created to facilitate exchange of atomic secrets at the highest levels of governments of the United States, United Kingdom and Canada. Donald Maclean, another Soviet spy, was also in attendance as British co-secretary of CPC.\nDetection and confession.\nBy September 1949, information from the Venona project indicated to GCHQ that Fuchs was a spy, but the British intelligence services were wary of indicating the source of their information. The Soviets had broken off contact with him in February. Fuchs may have been subsequently tipped off by Kim Philby. After a great deal of research for his 2019 biography, \"Trinity\", Frank Close confirmed that while MI5 suspected Fuchs for over two years, \"it was decrypters at GCHQ who supplied clear proof of his guilt ... not the crack American team that is normally given all the credit\", according to a review of the book.\nUnder interrogation by MI5 officer William Skardon at an informal meeting in December 1949, Fuchs initially denied being a spy and was not detained. According to Nancy Thorndike Greenspan, author of a 2020 book, \"Atomic Spy: The Dark Lives of Klaus Fuchs\", Skardon told Fuchs that if he admitted his earlier espionage activity, he could be permitted to continue to work at Harwell. In October 1949, Fuchs had approached Henry Arnold, the head of security at Harwell, with the news that his father had been given a chair at the University of Leipzig in East Germany, and this information became a factor as well. In early January Fuchs was informed that he must resign his position at Harwell because of his father's appointment in East Germany. He was offered help in finding a university post.\nMeeting with Skardon for a fourth time on 24 January 1950, Fuchs voluntarily confessed that he had shared information with the Soviets. According to Nancy Thorndike Greenspan, Skardon's report on their meeting \"made no mention of his promise to Fuchs to stay on at Harwell if he confessed\", but at the subsequent debriefing it was agreed \"to maintain FUCHS in his present state of mind, and for this state of mind to be in no way disturbed\". To make it possible to prosecute Fuchs, Skardon proposed that Fuchs be asked to prepare a signed statement, which he then did at the War Office in London. The document included the statement \"I was given the chance of admitting it and staying at Harwell or clearing out.\"\nThree days later, he also directed a statement more technical in content to Michael Perrin, the deputy controller of atomic energy within the Ministry of Supply. Fuchs told interrogators that the NKGB had acquired an agent in Berkeley, California, who had informed the Soviet Union about electromagnetic separation research of uranium-235 in 1942 or earlier. Fuchs's statements to British and American intelligence agencies were used to implicate Harry Gold, a key witness in the trials of David Greenglass and Julius and Ethel Rosenberg in the United States. Fuchs later stated that he passed detailed information on the project to the Soviet Union through courier Harry Gold in 1945, and further information about Edward Teller's unworkable \"Super\" design for a hydrogen bomb in 1946 and 1947. Fuchs also stated that \"The last time when I handed over information [to Russian authorities] was in February or March 1949\".\nFuchs was arrested on 2 February 1950, charged with violations of the Official Secrets Act. Nancy Thorndike Greenspan quotes from police notes on a visit between fellow scientist Peierls and Fuchs in detention shortly after the news of the arrest broke. When Peierls asked Fuchs why he had spied, Fuchs answered: \"Knowledge of atomic research should not be the private property of any one country but should be shared with the rest of the world for the benefit of mankind.\"\nValue of data to Soviet project.\nHans Bethe once said that Fuchs was the only physicist he knew to have truly changed history. Considering that the pace of the Soviet programme was set primarily by the amount of uranium that it could procure, it is difficult for scholars to counterfactually judge how much time or effort was saved. Prior to the opening up of the Soviet archives in the early 1990s, scholars and analysts tended to assume that the Soviets would have applied any technical intelligence as directly as possible. However historical work after the end of the Cold War revealed that the head of the Soviet atomic project, Lavrenti Beria, did not entirely trust either his intelligence sources, nor his own scientists, and so instead used the intelligence information as a third-party check and guide, rather than exploiting it directly. Most of the scientists working on the Soviet bomb project were, accordingly, unaware that they were using any intelligence information as part of their research. Because of these conditions, it is hard to evaluate whether Fuchs's information had an accelerating effect on the research, or if it even saved much effort, as the Soviets tended to re-do the research results independently anyway. And in many respects, the Soviet programme was not simply a recapitulation of the Manhattan Project: it explored several approaches that were not done during the war, such as the successful development of the gas centrifuge method of enrichment.\nFuchs's own assessment of the effects of his actions, as reflected in an interview with Perrin after his arrest, was he thought he could have saved the Soviets \"several years\" time (\"one year at least\") because they could have started the development of the weapon design so that it was ready by the time sufficient fissile material became available:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;He stated that his best estimate is that the information furnished by him speeded up the production of an A-Bomb by Russia by several years because it permitted them to start on the development of the explosion \"[sic: explosive]\" and have this ready by the time the fissionable material was ready. He concluded that the Russian scientists are as good as scientists in England and the United States but there are fewer good scientists in Russia than the other two countries. He stated that he gave the Russians nothing that would speed up the production of plutonium and estimated that if he had given the same data which he gave the Russians to the United States as of the date of his arrival in the United States, he would have speeded the U.S. production of the A-Bomb only slightly. He did pass on to his Russian espionage contact what he learned concerning the production of plutonium during the final period of his work at Los Alamos. He stated that the information furnished by him alone could have speeded up the production of an A-Bomb by Russia by one year at least. He indicated that if the Russians had information on the plutonium process from any other source, the data furnished by him could have been of material assistance on this plutonium phase.\nFuchs, however, was not told how the Soviets would or would not use his information, and though certain questions from his espionage contacts suggested to him that the Soviets had additional sources within the Manhattan Project, he was unaware of their identities and knowledge. He told Perrin that he was himself \"extremely surprised\" at the speed at which the Soviets developed their own atomic bomb, \"as he had been convinced that the information he had given could not have been applied so quickly and that the Russians would not have had the engineering design and construction facilities that would be needed to build large production plants in such a short time.\"\nThe information that Fuchs was able to give the Soviet Union about the Manhattan Project was much more extensive, and much more technically precise, than that available from other, later-discovered atomic spies like David Greenglass or Theodore Hall. According to Fuchs's interview with Perrin after capture, among his other disclosures, he gave the Soviets:\nWhether the information Fuchs passed relating to the hydrogen bomb would have been useful is still debated. Most scholars agree with Hans Bethe's 1952 assessment, which concluded that by the time Fuchs left the thermonuclear programme in mid-1946, too little was known about the mechanism of the hydrogen bomb for his information to be useful to the Soviet Union. Fuchs's knowledge and own work was in the context of the original, erroneous \"Runaway Super\" idea, which was not abandoned until early 1950 in the face of new calculations that showed it would not work. The United States only developed a new, successful approach\u2014the Teller\u2013Ulam design\u2014in early 1951. Fuchs could not give away the secret of the hydrogen bomb, as neither he, nor anyone else, knew it prior to his arrest in 1950.\nThe Soviet hydrogen bomb work also investigated the \"Runaway Super\" idea, and also found it to be a dead-end. Their own independent reinvention of the Teller\u2013Ulam principle was accomplished through a different approach than in the United States. The Soviet physicist German Goncharov has noted that while Fuchs's early work did not help Soviet efforts towards the hydrogen bomb, it was in retrospect closer to the right approach than any scientists (Soviet or American) recognised at the time. It contained in it the seed of the idea of radiation implosion, which turned out to be of great importance to the final design. In this way, Fuchs's work was a \"precursor\" of the Teller\u2013Ulam design, but only recognisable as such after the fact, as it was still missing some of the key elements of it and done in the context of a fundamentally different weapon.\nThe revelation of Fuchs's espionage increased the rift between the United States and the United Kingdom on matters of atomic energy. Prior to it, the US and UK had been planning to collaborate more fully again on nuclear matters, something that had been put on hold after the passing of the Atomic Energy Act of 1946. \"Whatever hopes had existed for a tightly-integrated programme with the British and Canadians died with the Fuchs revelation\", as historians Richard G. Hewlett and Francis Duncan put it. The Anglo-American \"Special Relationship\" would ultimately be repaired by the mid-1950s.\nTrial and imprisonment.\nFuchs was prosecuted by Sir Hartley Shawcross and was convicted on 1 March 1950 of four counts of breaking the Official Secrets Act by \"communicating information to a potential enemy.\" Fuchs had entered guilty pleas, and his barrister Derek Curtis-Bennett limited his case to a general plea in mitigation on the grounds of his state of mind and desire to assist the Soviets in defeating the Nazis and winning the war. Fuchs consented to the advice not to raise the question of inducement in his decision to admit guilt.\nAfter a trial lasting less than 90 minutes that was based on his confession, Lord Goddard sentenced Fuchs to 14 years' imprisonment, the maximum for espionage. The judge argued that his crime could not have been considered treason (which was a capital crime), because the Soviet Union was classed as an ally at the time. On 21 February 1951, he was formally stripped of his British citizenship.\nThe head of the British H-bomb project, Sir William Penney, visited Fuchs in prison in 1952. While imprisoned, Fuchs was friendly with the Irish Republican Army prisoner Seamus Murphy with whom he played chess and helped to escape.\nFuchs was released on 23 June 1959 after he had served nine years and four months of his sentence (as was then required in England where long-term prisoners were entitled by law to one third off for good behaviour in prison) at Wakefield Prison and promptly emigrated to the German Democratic Republic (GDR).\nCareer in East Germany.\nOn arrival at Berlin Sch\u00f6nefeld Airport in the GDR, Fuchs was met by Margarete \"Grete\" Keilson, a friend from his years as a student communist. They were married on 9 September 1959.\nIn the GDR, Fuchs continued his scientific career and achieved considerable prominence as a leader of research. He became a member of the SED central committee in 1967, and in 1972 was elected to the Academy of Sciences where from 1974 to 1978 he was the head of the research area of physics, nuclear and materials science; he was then appointed deputy director of the Central Institute for Nuclear Physics in Rossendorf, Dresden, where he served until he retired in 1979. From 1984, Fuchs was head of the scientific councils for energetic basic research and for fundamentals of microelectronics. He received the Patriotic Order of Merit, the Order of Karl Marx and the National Prize of East Germany.\nIn \"The Nuclear Express: A Political History of the Bomb and Its Proliferation\" (2009) by Thomas Reed and Daniel Stillman, it is argued that a tutorial Fuchs gave to Qian Sanqiang and other Chinese physicists helped them to develop the first Chinese atomic bomb, the \"596\", which was tested five years later. Three historians of nuclear weapons history, Robert S. Norris, Jeremy Bernstein, and Peter D. Zimmerman, challenged this particular assertion as \"unsubstantiated conjecture\" and asserted that \"The Nuclear Express\" is \"an ambitious but deeply flawed book\".\nDeath.\nFuchs died in East Berlin on 28 January 1988. He was cremated and honoured with burial in the section of Berlin's Friedrichsfelde Cemetery.\nIn popular culture.\nHe was portrayed by Denis Forest in the 1987 television miniseries \"Race for the Bomb\".\nA documentary film about Fuchs, \"V\u00e4ter der tausend Sonnen\" (\"Fathers of a Thousand Suns\"), was released in 1990.\n\"Dark Sun\" (1995) by Richard Rhodes features a clerihew about Fuchs:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nIn 2022, Fuchs was the primary focus of the second season of the BBC World Service's podcast \"The Bomb\".\nHe is portrayed by American actor Christopher Denham in the 2023 film \"Oppenheimer\".\nIn 2025 he appeared as a key character in the Rory Clements novel, \"A Cold Wind From Moscow\".\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "17318", "revid": "23316696", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=17318", "title": "Konstantin Stanislavski", "text": "Russian actor and theatre director (1863\u20131938)\nKonstantin Sergeyevich Stanislavski (; Russian: , ; n\u00e9\u00a0Alekseyev; 17 January\u00a0[O.S. 5 January]\u00a01863\u00a0\u2013 7 August 1938) was a seminal Russian and Soviet theatre practitioner. He was widely recognized as an outstanding character actor, and the many productions that he directed garnered him a reputation as one of the leading theatre directors of his generation. His principal fame and influence, however, rests on his \"system\" of actor training, preparation, and rehearsal technique.\nStanislavski (his stage name) performed and directed as an amateur until the age of 33, when he co-founded the world-famous Moscow Art Theatre (MAT) company with Vladimir Nemirovich-Danchenko, following a legendary 18-hour discussion. Its influential tours of Europe (1906) and the US (1923\u201324), and its landmark productions of \"The Seagull\" (1898) and \"Hamlet\" (1911\u201312), established his reputation and opened new possibilities for the art of the theatre. By means of the MAT, Stanislavski was instrumental in promoting the new Russian drama of his day\u2014principally the work of Anton Chekhov, Maxim Gorky, and Mikhail Bulgakov\u2014to audiences in Moscow and around the world; he also staged acclaimed productions of a wide range of classical Russian and European plays.\nHe collaborated with the director and designer Edward Gordon Craig and was formative in the development of several other major practitioners, including Vsevolod Meyerhold (whom Stanislavski considered his \"sole heir in the theatre\"), Yevgeny Vakhtangov, and Michael Chekhov. At the MAT's 30th anniversary celebrations in 1928, a massive heart attack on-stage put an end to his acting career (though he waited until the curtain fell before seeking medical assistance). He continued to direct, teach, and write about acting until his death a few weeks before the publication of the first volume of his life's great work, the acting manual \"An Actor's Work\" (1938). He was awarded the Order of the Red Banner of Labour and the Order of Lenin and was the first to be granted the title of People's Artist of the USSR.\nStanislavski wrote that \"there is nothing more tedious than an actor's biography\" and that \"actors should be banned from talking about themselves\". At the request of a US publisher, however, he reluctantly agreed to write his autobiography, \"My Life in Art\" (first published in English in 1924 and a revised, Russian-language edition in 1926), though its account of his artistic development is not always accurate. Three English-language biographies have been published: David Magarshack's \"Stanislavsky: A Life\" (1950); Jean Benedetti's \"Stanislavski: His Life and Art\" (1988, revised and expanded 1999). and Nikolai M Gorchakov's \"Stanislavsky Directs\" (1954). An out-of-print English translation of Elena Poliakova's 1977 Russian biography of Stanislavski was also published in 1982.\nOverview of the system.\nStanislavski subjected his acting and direction to a rigorous process of artistic self-analysis and reflection. His system of acting developed out of his persistent efforts to remove the blocks that he encountered in his performances, beginning with a major crisis in 1906. He produced his early work using an external, director-centred technique that strove for an organic unity of all its elements\u2014in each production he planned the interpretation of every role, blocking, and the \"mise en sc\u00e8ne\" in detail in advance. He also introduced into the production process a period of discussion and detailed analysis of the play by the cast. Despite the success that this approach brought, particularly with his Naturalistic stagings of the plays of Anton Chekhov and Maxim Gorky, Stanislavski remained dissatisfied.\nBoth his struggles with Chekhov's drama (out of which his notion of subtext emerged) and his experiments with Symbolism encouraged a greater attention to \"inner action\" and a more intensive investigation of the actor's process. He began to develop the more actor-centred techniques of \"psychological realism\" and his focus shifted from his productions to rehearsal process and pedagogy. He pioneered the use of theatre studios as a laboratory in which to innovate actor training and to experiment with new forms of theatre. Stanislavski organised his techniques into a coherent, systematic methodology, which built on three major strands of influence: (1) the director-centred, unified aesthetic and disciplined, ensemble approach of the Meiningen company; (2) the actor-centred realism of the Maly; and (3) the Naturalistic staging of Antoine and the independent theatre movement.\nThe system cultivates what Stanislavski calls the \"art of experiencing\" (to which he contrasts the \"art of representation\"). It mobilises the actor's conscious thought and will to activate other, less-controllable psychological processes\u2014such as emotional experience and subconscious behaviour\u2014sympathetically and indirectly. In rehearsal, the actor searches for inner motives to justify action and the definition of what the character seeks to achieve at any given moment (a \"task\"). Stanislavski's earliest reference to his system appears in 1909, the same year that he first incorporated it into his rehearsal process. The MAT adopted it as its official rehearsal method in 1911.\nLater, Stanislavski further elaborated the system with a more physically grounded rehearsal process that came to be known as the \"Method of Physical Action\". Minimising at-the-table discussions, he now encouraged an \"active analysis\", in which the sequence of dramatic situations is improvised. \"The best analysis of a play\", Stanislavski argued, \"is to take action in the given circumstances.\"\nJust as the First Studio, led by his assistant and close friend Leopold Sulerzhitsky, had provided the forum in which he developed his initial ideas for the system during the 1910s, he hoped to secure his final legacy by opening another studio in 1935, in which the Method of Physical Action would be taught. The Opera-Dramatic Studio embodied the most complete implementation of the training exercises described in his manuals. Meanwhile, the transmission of his earlier work via the students of the First Studio was revolutionising acting in the West. With the arrival of Socialist realism in the USSR, the MAT and Stanislavski's system were enthroned as exemplary models.\nFamily background and early influences.\nStanislavski had a privileged youth, growing up in one of the richest families in Russia, the Alekseyevs. He was born Konstantin Sergeyevich Alekseyev\u2014he adopted the stage name \"Stanislavski\" in 1884 to keep his performance activities secret from his parents. Up until the communist revolution in 1917, Stanislavski often used his inherited wealth to fund his experiments in acting and directing. His family's discouragement meant that he appeared only as an amateur until he was thirty three.\nAs a child, Stanislavski was interested in the circus, the ballet, and puppetry. Later, his family's two private theatres provided a forum for his theatrical impulses. After his debut performance at one in 1877, he started what would become a lifelong series of notebooks filled with critical observations on his acting, aphorisms, and problems\u2014it was from this habit of self-analysis and critique that Stanislavski's system later emerged. Stanislavski chose not to attend university, preferring to work in the family business.\nIncreasingly interested in \"experiencing the role\", Stanislavski experimented with maintaining a characterization in real life. In 1884, he began vocal training under Fyodor Komissarzhevsky, with whom he also explored the coordination of body and voice. A year later, Stanislavski briefly studied at the Moscow Theatre School but, disappointed with its approach, he left after little more than two weeks. Instead, he devoted particular attention to the performances of the Maly Theatre, the home of Russian psychological realism (as developed in the 19th century by Alexander Pushkin, Nikolai Gogol and Mikhail Shchepkin).\nShchepkin's legacy included a disciplined, ensemble approach, extensive rehearsals, and the use of careful observation, self-knowledge, imagination, and emotion as the cornerstones of the craft. Stanislavski called the Maly his \"university\". One of Shchepkin's students, Glikeriya Fedotova, taught Stanislavski; she instilled in him the rejection of inspiration as the basis of the actor's art, stressed the importance of training and discipline, and encouraged the practice of responsive interaction with other actors that Stanislavski came to call \"communication\". As well as the artists of the Maly, performances given by foreign stars influenced Stanislavski. The effortless, emotive, and clear playing of the Italian Ernesto Rossi, who performed major Shakespearean tragic protagonists in Moscow in 1877, particularly impressed him. So too did Tommaso Salvini's 1882 performance of Othello.\nAmateur work as an actor and director.\nBy now well known as an amateur actor, at the age of twenty-five, Stanslavski co-founded a Society of Art and Literature. Under its auspices, he performed in plays by Moli\u00e8re, Schiller, Pushkin, and Ostrovsky, as well as gaining his first experiences as a director. He became interested in the aesthetic theories of Vissarion Belinsky, from whom he took his conception of the role of the artist.\nOn 5 July\u00a0[O.S. 23 June]\u00a01889, Stanislavski married Maria Lilina (the stage name of Maria Petrovna Perevostchikova). Their first child, Xenia, died of pneumonia in May 1890, less than two months after she was born. Their second daughter, Kira, was born on 2 August\u00a0[O.S. 21 July]\u00a01891. In January 1893, Stanislavski's father died. Their son Igor was born on 26 September\u00a0[O.S. 14 September]\u00a01894.\nIn February 1891, Stanislavski directed Leo Tolstoy's \"The Fruits of Enlightenment\" for the Society of Art and Literature, in what he later described as his first fully independent directorial work. But it was not until 1893 he first met the great realist novelist and playwright that became another important influence on him. Five years later, the MAT would be his response to Tolstoy's demand for simplicity, directness, and accessibility in art.\nStanislavski's directorial methods at this time were closely modelled on the disciplined, autocratic approach of Ludwig Chronegk, the director of the Meiningen Ensemble. In \"My Life in Art\" (1924), Stanislavski described this approach as one in which the director is \"forced to work without the help of the actor\". From 1894 onward, Stanislavski began to assemble detailed prompt-books that included a directorial commentary on the entire play and from which not even the smallest detail was allowed to deviate.\nWhereas the Ensemble's effects tended toward the grandiose, Stanislavski introduced lyrical elaborations through the \"mise-en-sc\u00e8ne\" that dramatised more mundane and ordinary elements of life, in keeping with Belinsky's ideas about the \"poetry of the real\". Using his rigid and detailed control of all theatrical elements, including the strict choreography of the actors' every gesture, in Stanislavski's words \"the inner kernel of the play was revealed by itself\". Analysing the Society's production of \"Othello\" (1896), Jean Benedetti observes that:\nStanislavski uses the theatre and its technical possibilities as an instrument of expression, a language, in its own right. The dramatic meaning is in the staging itself. [...] He went through the whole play in a completely different way, not relying on the text as such, with quotes from important speeches, not providing a 'literary' explanation, but speaking in terms of the play's dynamic, its action, the thoughts and feelings of the protagonists, the world in which they lived. His account flowed uninterruptedly from moment to moment.\nBenedetti argues that Stanislavski's task at this stage was to unite the realistic tradition of the creative actor inherited from Shchepkin and Gogol with the director-centred, organically unified Naturalistic aesthetic of the Meiningen approach. That synthesis would emerge eventually, but only in the wake of Stanislavski's directorial struggles with Symbolist theatre and an artistic crisis in his work as an actor. \"The task of our generation\", Stanislavski wrote as he was about to found the Moscow Art Theatre and begin his professional life in the theatre, is \"to liberate art from outmoded tradition, from tired clich\u00e9 and to give greater freedom to imagination and creative ability.\"\nCreation of the Moscow Art Theatre.\nStanislavski's historic meeting with Vladimir Nemirovich-Danchenko on 4 July\u00a0[O.S. 22 June]\u00a01897 led to the creation of what was called initially the \"Moscow Public-Accessible Theatre\", but which came to be known as the Moscow Art Theatre (MAT). Their eighteen-hour-long discussion has acquired a legendary status in the history of theatre.\nNemirovich was a successful playwright, critic, theatre director, and acting teacher at the Philharmonic School who, like Stanislavski, was committed to the idea of a popular theatre. Their abilities complemented one another: Stanislavski brought his directorial talent for creating vivid stage images and selecting significant details; Nemirovich, his talent for dramatic and literary analysis, his professional expertise, and his ability to manage a theatre. Stanislavski later compared their discussions to the Treaty of Versailles, their scope was so wide-ranging; they agreed on the conventional practices they wished to abandon and, on the basis of the working method they found they had in common, defined the policy of their new theatre.\nStanislavski and Nemirovich planned a professional company with an ensemble ethos that discouraged individual vanity; they would create a realistic theatre of international renown, with popular prices for seats, whose organically unified aesthetic would bring together the techniques of the Meiningen Ensemble and those of Andr\u00e9 Antoine's Th\u00e9\u00e2tre Libre (which Stanislavski had seen during trips to Paris). Nemirovich assumed that Stanislavski would fund the theatre as a privately owned business, but Stanislavski insisted on a limited, joint stock company. Viktor Simov, whom Stanislavski had met in 1896, was engaged as the company's principal designer.\nIn his opening speech on the first day of rehearsals, 26 June\u00a0[O.S. 14 June]\u00a01898, Stanislavski stressed the \"social character\" of their collective undertaking. In an atmosphere more like a university than a theatre, as Stanislavski described it, the company was introduced to his working method of extensive reading and research and detailed rehearsals in which the action was defined at the table before being explored physically. Stanislavski's lifelong relationship with Vsevolod Meyerhold began during these rehearsals; by the end of June, Meyerhold was so impressed with Stanislavski's directorial skills that he declared him a genius.\nNaturalism at the MAT.\nThe lasting significance of Stanislavski's early work at the MAT lies in its development of a Naturalistic performance mode. In 1898, Stanislavski co-directed with Nemirovich the first of his productions of the work of Anton Chekhov. The MAT production of \"The Seagull\" was a crucial milestone for the fledgling company that has been described as \"one of the greatest events in the history of Russian theatre and one of the greatest new developments in the history of world drama.\" Despite its 80 hours of rehearsal\u2014a considerable length by the standards of the conventional practice of the day\u2014Stanislavski felt it was under-rehearsed. The production's success was due to the fidelity of its delicate representation of everyday life, its intimate, ensemble playing, and the resonance of its mood of despondent uncertainty with the psychological disposition of the Russian intelligentsia of the time.\nStanislavski went on to direct the successful premi\u00e8res of Chekhov's other major plays: \"Uncle Vanya\" in 1899 (in which he played Astrov), \"Three Sisters\" in 1901 (playing Vershinin), and \"The Cherry Orchard\" in 1904 (playing Gaev). Stanislavski's encounter with Chekhov's drama proved crucial to the creative development of both men. His ensemble approach and attention to the psychological realities of its characters revived Chekhov's interest in writing for the stage, while Chekhov's unwillingness to explain or expand on the text forced Stanislavski to dig beneath its surface in ways that were new in theatre.\nIn response to Stanislavski's encouragement, Maxim Gorky promised to launch his playwrighting career with the MAT. In 1902, Stanislavski directed the premi\u00e8re productions of the first two of Gorky's plays, \"The Philistines\" and \"The Lower Depths\". As part of the rehearsal preparations for the latter, Stanislavski took the company to visit Khitrov Market, where they talked to its down-and-outs and soaked up its atmosphere of destitution. Stanislavski based his characterisation of Satin on an ex-officer he met there, who had fallen into poverty through gambling. \"The Lower Depths\" was a triumph that matched the production of \"The Seagull\" four years earlier, though Stanislavski regarded his performance as external and mechanical.\nThe productions of \"The Cherry Orchard\" and \"The Lower Depths\" remained in the MAT's repertoire for decades. Along with Chekhov and Gorky, the drama of Henrik Ibsen formed an important part of Stanislavski's work at this time\u2014in its first two decades, the MAT staged more plays by Ibsen than any other playwright. In its first decade, Stanislavski directed \"Hedda Gabler\" (in which he played L\u00f8vborg), \"An Enemy of the People\" (playing Dr Stockmann, his favorite role), \"The Wild Duck\", and \"Ghosts\". \"More's the pity I was not a Scandinavian and never saw how Ibsen was played in Scandinavia,\" Stanislavski wrote, because \"those who have been there tell me that he is interpreted as simply, as true to life, as we play Chekhov\". He also staged other important Naturalistic works, including Gerhart Hauptmann's \"Drayman Henschel\", \"Lonely People\", and \"Michael Kramer\" and Leo Tolstoy's \"The Power of Darkness\".\nSymbolism and the Theatre-Studio.\nIn 1904, Stanislavski finally acted on a suggestion made by Chekhov two years earlier that he stage several one-act plays by Maurice Maeterlinck, the Belgian Symbolist. Despite his enthusiasm, however, Stanislavski struggled to realise a theatrical approach to the static, lyrical dramas. When the triple bill consisting of \"The Blind\", \"Intruder\", and \"Interior\" opened on 15 October [O.S. 2 October], the experiment was deemed a failure.\nMeyerhold, prompted by Stanislavski's positive response to his new ideas about Symbolist theatre, proposed that they form a \"theatre studio\" (a term which he invented) that would function as \"a laboratory for the experiments of more or less experienced actors.\" The Theatre-Studio aimed to develop Meyerhold's aesthetic ideas into new theatrical forms that would return the MAT to the forefront of the avant-garde and Stanislavski's socially conscious ideas for a network of \"people's theatres\" that would reform Russian theatrical culture as a whole. Central to Meyerhold's approach was the use of improvisation to develop the performances.\nWhen the studio presented a work-in-progress, Stanislavski was encouraged; when performed in a fully equipped theatre in Moscow, however, it was regarded as a failure, and the studio folded. Meyerhold drew an important lesson: \"one must first educate a new actor and only then put new tasks before him\", he wrote, adding that \"Stanislavski, too, came to such a conclusion.\" Reflecting in 1908 on the Theatre-Studio's demise, Stanislavski wrote that \"our theatre found its future among its ruins.\" Nemirovich disapproved of what he described as the malign influence of Meyerhold on Stanislavski's work at this time.\nStanislavski engaged two important new collaborators in 1905: Liubov Gurevich became his literary advisor, and Leopold Sulerzhitsky became his personal assistant. Stanislavski revised his interpretation of the role of Trigorin (and Meyerhold reprised his role as Konstantin) when the MAT revived its production of Chekhov's \"The Seagull\" on 13 October\u00a0[O.S. 30 September]\u00a01905.\nThis was the year of the abortive revolution in Russia. Stanislavski signed a protest against the violence of the secret police, Cossack troops, and the right-wing extremist paramilitary \"Black Hundreds\", which was submitted to the Duma on the 3 November [O.S. 21 October]. Rehearsals for the MAT's production of Alexander Griboyedov's classic verse comedy \"Woe from Wit\" were interrupted by gun-battles on the streets outside. Stanislavski and Nemirovich closed the theatre and embarked on the company's first tour outside of Russia.\nEuropean tour and artistic crisis.\nThe MAT's first European tour began on 23 February\u00a0[O.S. 10 February]\u00a01906 in Berlin, where they played to an audience that included Max Reinhardt, Gerhart Hauptmann, Arthur Schnitzler, and Eleonora Duse. \"It's as though we were the revelation\", Stanislavski wrote of the rapturous acclaim they received. The success of the tour provided financial security for the company, garnered an international reputation for their work, and made a significant impact on European theatre. The tour also provoked a major artistic crisis for Stanislavski that had a significant impact on \"his\" future direction. From his attempts to resolve this crisis, his system would eventually emerge.\nSometime in March 1906, Jean Benedetti suggests that it was during \"An Enemy of the People\"\u2014Stanislavski became aware that he was acting without a flow of inner impulses and feelings and that as a consequence his performance had become mechanical. He spent June and July in Finland on holiday, where he studied, wrote, and reflected. With his notebooks on his own experience from 1889 onwards, he attempted to analyze \"the foundation stones of our art\" and the actor's creative process in particular. He began to formulate a psychological approach to controlling the actor's process in a \"Manual on Dramatic Art\".\nProductions as research into working methods.\nStanislavski's activities began to move in a very different direction: his productions became opportunities for research, he was more interested in the process of rehearsal than its product, and his attention shifted away from the MAT towards its satellite projects\u2014the theatre studios\u2014in which he would develop his system. On his return to Moscow, he explored his new psychological approach in his production of Knut Hamsun's Symbolist play \"The Drama of Life\". Nemirovich was particularly hostile to his new methods, and their relationship continued to deteriorate in this period. In a statement made on 9 February\u00a0[O.S. 27 January]\u00a01908, Stanislavski marked a significant shift in his directorial method and stressed the crucial contribution he now expected from a creative actor:\nThe committee is wrong if it thinks that the director's preparatory work in the study is necessary, as previously, when he alone decided the whole plan and all the details of the production, wrote the \"mise en sc\u00e8ne\" and answered all the actors' questions for them. The director is no longer king, as before, when the actor possessed no clear individuality. [...] It is essential to understand this\u2014rehearsals are divided into two stages: the first stage is one of experiment when the cast helps the director, the second is creating the performance when the director helps the cast.\nStanislavski's preparations for Maeterlinck's \"The Blue Bird\" (which was to become his most famous production to-date) included improvisations and other exercises to stimulate the actors' imaginations; Nemirovich described one in which the cast imitated various animals. In rehearsals he sought ways to encourage his actors' will to create afresh in every performance. He focused on the search for inner motives to justify action and the definition of what the characters are seeking to achieve at any given moment (what he would come to call their \"task\"). This use of the actor's conscious thought and will was designed to activate other, less-controllable psychological processes\u2014such as emotional experience and subconscious behaviour\u2014sympathetically and indirectly.\nNoting the importance to great actors' performances of their ability to remain relaxed, he discovered that he could abolish physical tension by focusing his attention on the specific action that the play demanded; when his concentration wavered, his tension returned. \"What fascinates me most\", Stanislavski wrote in May 1908, \"is the rhythm of feelings, the development of affective memory and the psycho-physiology of the creative process.\" His interest in the creative use of the actor's personal experiences was spurred by a chance conversation in Germany in July that led him to the work of French psychologist Th\u00e9odule-Armand Ribot. His \"affective memory\" contributed to the technique that Stanislavski would come to call \"emotion memory\".\nTogether, these elements formed a new vocabulary with which he explored a \"return to realism\" in a production of Gogol's \"The Government Inspector\" as soon as \"The Blue Bird\" had opened. At a theatre conference on 21 March\u00a0[O.S. 8 March]\u00a01909, Stanislavski delivered a paper on his emerging system that stressed the role of his techniques of the \"magic if\" (which encourages the actor to respond to the fictional circumstances of the play \"as if\" they were real) and emotion memory. He developed his ideas about three trends in the history of acting, which were to appear eventually in the opening chapters of \"An Actor's Work\": \"stock-in-trade\" acting, the art of representation, and the art of experiencing (his own approach).\nStanislavski's production of \"A Month in the Country\" (1909) was a watershed in his artistic development. Breaking the MAT's tradition of open rehearsals, he prepared Turgenev's play in private. They began with a discussion of what he would come to call the \"through-line\" for the characters (their emotional development and the way they change over the course of the play). This production is the earliest recorded instance of his practice of analysing the action of the script into discrete \"bits\".\nAt this stage in the development of his approach, Stanislavski's technique was to identify the emotional state contained in the psychological experience of the character during each bit and, through the use of the actor's emotional memory, to forge a subjective connection to it. Only after two months of rehearsals were the actors permitted to physicalise the text. Stanislavski insisted that they should play the actions that their discussions around the table had identified. Having realised a particular emotional state in a physical action, he assumed at this point in his experiments, the actor's repetition of that action would evoke the desired emotion. As with his experiments in \"The Drama of Life\", they also explored non-verbal communication, whereby scenes were rehearsed as \"silent \"\u00e9tudes\"\" with actors interacting \"only with their eyes\". The production's success when it opened in December 1909 seemed to prove the validity of his new methodology.\nLate in 1910, Gorky invited Stanislavski to join him in Capri, where they discussed actor training and Stanislavski's emerging \"grammar\". Inspired by a popular theatre performance in Naples that employed the techniques of the \"commedia dell'arte\", Gorky suggested that they form a company, modeled on the medieval strolling players, in which a playwright and group of young actors would devise new plays together using improvisation. Stanislavski would develop this use of improvisation in his work with his First Studio.\nStaging the classics.\nIn his treatment of the classics, Stanislavski believed that it was legitimate for actors and directors to ignore the playwright's intentions for a play's staging. One of his most important\u2014a collaboration with Edward Gordon Craig on a production of \"Hamlet\"\u2014became a landmark of 20th-century theatrical modernism. Stanislavski hoped to prove that his recently developed system for creating internally justified, realistic acting could meet the formal demands of a classic play. Craig envisioned a Symbolist monodrama in which every aspect of production would be subjugated to the protagonist: it would present a dream-like vision as seen through Hamlet's eyes.\nDespite these contrasting approaches, the two practitioners did share some artistic assumptions; the system had developed out of Stanislavski's experiments with Symbolist drama, which had shifted his attention from a Naturalistic external surface to the characters' subtextual, inner world. Both had stressed the importance of achieving a unity of all theatrical elements in their work. Their production attracted enthusiastic and unprecedented worldwide attention for the theatre, placing it \"on the cultural map for Western Europe\", and it has come to be regarded as a seminal event that revolutionised the staging of Shakespeare's plays. It became \"one of the most famous and passionately discussed productions in the history of the modern stage.\"\nIncreasingly absorbed by his teaching, in 1913 Stanislavski held open rehearsals for his production of Moli\u00e8re's \"The Imaginary Invalid\" as a demonstration of the system. As with his production of \"Hamlet\" and his next, Goldoni's \"The Mistress of the Inn\", he was keen to assay his system in the crucible of a classical text. He began to inflect his technique of dividing the action of the play into bits with an emphasis on improvisation; he would progress from analysis, through free improvisation, to the language of the text:\nI divide the work into \"large bits\" clarifying the nature of each bit. Then, immediately, in my own words, I play each bit, observing all the curves. Then I go through the experiences of each bit ten times or so with its curves (not in a fixed way, not being consistent). Then I follow the successive bits in the book. And finally, I make the transition, imperceptibly, to the experiences as expressed in the actual words of the part.\nStanislavski's struggles with both Moli\u00e8re and Goldoni comedies revealed the importance of an appropriate definition of what he calls a character's \"super-task\" (the core problem that unites and subordinates the character's moment-to-moment tasks). This impacted particularly on the actors' ability to serve the plays' genre, because an unsatisfactory definition produced tragic rather than comic performances.\nOther European classics directed by Stanislavski include: Shakespeare's \"The Merchant of Venice\", \"Twelfth Night\", and \"Othello\", an unfinished production of Moli\u00e8re's \"Tartuffe\", and Beaumarchais's \"The Marriage of Figaro\". Other classics of the Russian theatre directed by Stanislavki include: several plays by Ivan Turgenev, Griboyedov's \"Woe from Wit\", Gogol's \"The Government Inspector\", and plays by Tolstoy, Ostrovsky, and Pushkin.\nStudios and the search for a system.\nFollowing the success of his production of \"A Month in the Country\", Stanislavski made repeated requests to the board of the MAT for proper facilities to pursue his pedagogical work with young actors. Gorky encouraged him not to found a drama school to teach inexperienced beginners, but rather\u2014following the example of the Theatre-Studio of 1905\u2014to create a studio for research and experiment that would train young professionals.\nStanislavski created the First Studio on 14 September\u00a0[O.S. 1 September]\u00a01912. Its founding members included Yevgeny Vakhtangov, Michael Chekhov, Richard Boleslawski, and Maria Ouspenskaya, all of whom would exert a considerable influence on the subsequent history of theatre. Stanislavski selected Suler (as Gorky had nicknamed Sulerzhitsky) to lead the studio. In a focused, intense atmosphere, their work emphasised experimentation, improvisation, and self-discovery. Following Gorky's suggestions about devising new plays through improvisation, they searched for \"the creative process common to authors, actors and directors\".\nStanislavski created the Second Studio of the MAT in 1916, in response to a production of Zinaida Gippius' \"The Green Ring\" that a group of young actors had prepared independently. With a greater focus on pedagogical work than the First Studio, the Second Studio provided the environment in which Stanislavski developed the training techniques that would form the basis for his manual \"An Actor's Work\" (1938).\nA significant influence on the development of the system came from Stanislavski's experience teaching and directing at his Opera Studio, which was founded in 1918. He hoped that the successful application of his system to opera, with its inescapable conventionality and artifice, would demonstrate the universality of his approach to performance and unite the work of Mikhail Shchepkin and Feodor Chaliapin. From this experience, Stanislavski's notion of \"tempo-rhythm\" emerged. He invited Serge Wolkonsky to teach diction and Lev Pospekhin to teach expressive movement and dance, and attended both of their classes as a student.\nFrom the First World War to the October Revolution.\nStanislavski spent the summer of 1914 in Marienbad where, as he had in 1906, he researched the history of theatre and theories of acting to clarify the discoveries that his practical experiments had produced. When the First World War broke out, Stanislavski was in Munich. \"It seemed to me\", he wrote of the atmosphere at the train station in an article detailing his experiences, \"that death was hovering everywhere.\"\nThe train was stopped at Immenstadt, where German soldiers denounced him as a Russian spy. Held in a room at the station with a large crowd with \"the faces of wild beasts\" baying at its windows, Stanislavski believed he was to be executed. He remembered that he was carrying an official document that mentioned having played to Kaiser Wilhelm during their tour of 1906 that, when he showed it to the officers, produced a change of attitude towards his group. They were placed on a slow train to Kempten. Gurevich later related how during the journey Stanislavski surprised her when he whispered that:\n[E]vents of recent days had given him a clear impression of the superficiality of all that was called human culture, bourgeois culture, that a completely different kind of life was needed, where all needs were reduced to the minimum, where there was work\u2014real artistic work\u2014on behalf of the people, for those who had not yet been consumed by this bourgeois culture.\nIn Kempten they were again ordered into one of the station's rooms, where Stanislavski overheard the German soldiers complain of a lack of ammunition; it was only this, he understood, that prevented their execution. The following morning they were placed on a train and eventually returned to Russia via Switzerland and France.\nTurning to the classics of Russian theatre, the MAT revived Griboyedov's comedy \"Woe from Wit\" and planned to stage three of Pushkin's \"little tragedies\" in early 1915. Stanislavski continued to develop his system, explaining at an open rehearsal for \"Woe from Wit\" his concept of the state of \"I am being\". This term marks the stage in the rehearsal process when the distinction between actor and character blurs (producing the \"actor/role\"), subconscious behavior takes the lead, and the actor feels fully present in the dramatic moment. He stressed the importance to achieving this state of a focus on action (\"What would I do if\u00a0...\") rather than emotion (\"How would I feel if\u00a0...\"): \"You must ask the kinds of questions that lead to dynamic action.\" Instead of forcing emotion, he explained, actors should notice what is happening, attend to their relationships with the other actors, and try to understand \"through the senses\" the fictional world that surrounds them.\nWhen he prepared for his role in Pushkin's \"Mozart and Salieri\", Stanislavski created a biography for Salieri in which he imagined the character's memories of each incident mentioned in the play, his relationships with the other people involved, and the circumstances that had impacted on Salieri's life. When he attempted to render all of this detail in performance, however, the subtext overwhelmed the text; overladen with heavy pauses, Pushkin's verse was fragmented to the point of incomprehensibility. His struggles with this role prompted him to attend more closely to the structure and dynamics of language in drama; to that end, he studied Serge Wolkonsky's \"The Expressive Word\" (1913).\nThe French theatre practitioner Jacques Copeau contacted Stanislavski in October 1916. As a result of his conversations with Edward Gordon Craig, Copeau had come to believe that his work at the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre du Vieux-Colombier shared a common approach with Stanislavski's investigations at the MAT. On 30 December\u00a0[O.S. 17 December]\u00a01916, Stanislavski's assistant and closest friend, Leopold Sulerzhitsky, died from chronic nephritis. Reflecting on their relationship in 1931, Stanislavski said that Suler had understood him completely and that no one, since, had replaced him.\nRevolutions of 1917 and the Civil War years.\nStanislavski welcomed the February Revolution of 1917 and its overthrow of the absolute monarchy as a \"miraculous liberation of Russia\". With the October Revolution later in the year, the MAT closed for a few weeks and the First Studio was occupied by revolutionaries. Stanislavski thought that the social upheavals presented an opportunity to realize his long-standing ambitions to establish a Russian popular theatre that would provide, as the title of an essay he prepared that year put it, \"The Aesthetic Education of the Popular Masses\".\nVladimir Lenin, who became a frequent visitor to the MAT after the revolution, praised Stanislavski as \"a real artist\" and indicated that, in his opinion, Stanislavski's approach was \"the direction the theatre should take.\" The revolutions of that year brought about an abrupt change in Stanislavski's finances when his factories were nationalized, which left his wage from the MAT as his only source of income. On 29 August 1918 Stanislavski, along with several others from the MAT, was arrested by the Cheka, though he was released the following day.\nDuring the years of the Civil War, Stanislavski concentrated on teaching his system, directing (both at the MAT and its studios), and bringing performances of the classics to new audiences (such as factory workers and the Red Army). Several articles on Stanislavski and his system were published, but none were written by him. On 5 March 1921, Stanislavski was evicted from his large house on Carriage Row, where he had lived since 1903. Following the personal intervention of Lenin (prompted by Anatoly Lunacharsky), Stanislavski was rehoused at 6 Leontievski Lane, not far from the MAT. He was to live there until his death in 1938. On 29 May 1922, Stanislavski's favourite pupil, the director Yevgeny Vakhtangov, died of cancer.\nMAT tours in Europe and the United States.\nIn the wake of the temporary withdrawal of the state subsidy to the MAT that came with the New Economic Policy in 1921, Stanislavski and Nemirovich planned a tour to Europe and the US to augment the company's finances. The tour began in Berlin, where Stanislavski arrived on 18 September 1922, and proceeded to Prague, Zagreb, and Paris, where he was welcomed at the station by Jacques H\u00e9bertot, Aur\u00e9lien Lugn\u00e9-Po\u00eb, and Jacques Copeau. In Paris, he also met Andr\u00e9 Antoine, Louis Jouvet, Isadora Duncan, Firmin G\u00e9mier, and Harley Granville-Barker. He discussed with Copeau the possibility of establishing an international theatre studio and attended performances by Ermete Zacconi, whose control of his performance, economic expressivity, and ability both to \"experience\" and \"represent\" the role impressed him.\nThe company sailed to New York City and arrived on 4 January 1923. When reporters asked about their repertoire, Stanislavski explained that \"America wants to see what Europe already knows.\" David Belasco, Sergei Rachmaninoff, and Feodor Chaliapin attended the opening night performance. Thanks in part to a vigorous publicity campaign that the American producer, Morris Gest, orchestrated, the tour garnered substantial critical praise, although it was not a financial success.\nAs actors (among whom was the young Lee Strasberg) flocked to the performances to learn from the company, the tour made a substantial contribution to the development of American acting. Richard Boleslavsky presented a series of lectures on Stanislavski's system (which were eventually published as \"Acting: The First Six Lessons\" in 1933). A performance of \"Three Sisters\" on 31 March 1923 concluded the season in New York, after which they travelled to Chicago, Philadelphia, and Boston.\nAt the request of a US publisher, Stanislavski reluctantly agreed to write his autobiography, \"My Life in Art\", since his proposals for an account of the system or a history of the MAT and its approach had been rejected. He returned to Europe during the summer where he worked on the book and, in September, began rehearsals for a second tour. The company returned to New York on 7 November and went on to perform in Philadelphia, Boston, New Haven, Hartford, Washington, D.C., Brooklyn, Newark, Pittsburgh, Chicago, and Detroit. On 20 March 1924, Stanislavski met President Calvin Coolidge at the White House. They were introduced by a translator, Elizabeth Hapgood, with whom he would later collaborate on \"An Actor Prepares\". The company left the US on 17 May 1924.\nSoviet productions.\nOn his return to Moscow in August 1924, Stanislavski began with the help of Gurevich to make substantial revisions to his autobiography, in preparation for a definitive Russian-language edition, which was published in September 1926. He continued to act, reprising the role of Astrov in a new production of \"Uncle Vanya\" (his performance of which was described as \"staggering\"). With Nemirovich away touring with his Music Studio, Stanislavski led the MAT for two years, during which time the company thrived.\nWith a company fully versed in his system, Stanislavski's work on Mikhail Bulgakov's \"The Days of the Turbins\" focused on the tempo-rhythm of the production's dramatic structure and the through-lines of action for the individual characters and the play as a whole. \"See everything in terms of action,\" he advised them. Aware of the disapproval of Bulgakov felt by the Repertory Committee (\"Glavrepertkom\") of the People's Commissariat for Education, Stanislavski threatened to close the theatre if the play was banned. Despite substantial hostility from the press, the production was a box-office success.\nIn an attempt to render a classic play relevant to a contemporary Soviet audience, Stanislavski re-located the action in his fast and free-flowing production of Pierre Beaumarchais' 18th-century comedy \"The Marriage of Figaro\" to pre-Revolutionary France and emphasised the democratic point of view of Figaro and Susanna, in preference to that of the aristocratic Count Almaviva. His working methods contributed innovations to the system: the analysis of scenes in terms of concrete physical tasks and the use of the \"line of the day\" for each character.\nIn preference to the tightly controlled, Meiningen-inspired scoring of the \"mise en sc\u00e8ne\" with which he had choreographed crowd scenes in his early years, he now worked in terms of broad physical tasks: actors responded truthfully to the circumstances of scenes with sequences of improvised adaptations that attempted to solve concrete, physical problems. For the \"line of the day,\" an actor elaborates in detail the events that supposedly occur to the character \"off-stage\", in order to form a continuum of experience (the \"line\" of the character's life that day) that helps to justify his or her behaviour \"on-stage\". This means that the actor develops a relationship to where (as a character) he has just come from and to where he intends to go when leaving the scene. The production was a great success, garnering ten curtain calls on opening night. Thanks to its cohesive unity and rhythmic qualities, it is recognised as one of Stanislavski's major achievements.\nWith a performance of extracts from its major productions\u2014including the first act of \"Three Sisters\" in which Stanislavski played Vershinin\u2014the MAT celebrated its 30-year jubilee on 29 October 1928. While performing Stanislavski suffered a massive heart attack, although he continued until the curtain call, after which he collapsed. With that, his acting career came to an end.\nA manual for actors.\nWhile on holiday in August 1926, Stanislavski began to develop what would become \"An Actor's Work\", his manual for actors written in the form of a fictional student's diary. Ideally, Stanislavski felt, it would consist of two volumes: the first would detail the actor's inner experiencing and outer, physical embodiment; the second would address rehearsal processes. Since the Soviet publishers used a format that would have made the first volume unwieldy, however, in practice this became three volumes\u2014inner experiencing, outer characterisation, and rehearsal\u2014each of which would be published separately, as it became ready.\nThe danger that such an arrangement would obscure the mutual interdependence of these parts in the system as a whole would be avoided, Stanislavski hoped, by means of an initial overview that would stress their integration in his psycho-physical approach; as it turned out, however, he never wrote the overview and many English-language readers came to confuse the first volume on psychological processes\u2014published in a heavily abridged version in the US as \"An Actor Prepares\" (1936)\u2014with the system as a whole.\nThe two editors\u2014Hapgood with the American edition and Gurevich with the Russian\u2014made conflicting demands on Stanislavski. Gurevich became increasingly concerned that splitting \"An Actor's Work\" into two books would not only encourage misunderstandings of the unity and mutual implication of the psychological and physical aspects of the system, but would also give its Soviet critics grounds on which to attack it: \"to accuse you of dualism, spiritualism, idealism, etc.\" Frustrated with Stanislavski's tendency to tinker with details in preference to addressing more important missing sections, in May 1932 she terminated her involvement. Hapgood echoed Gurevich's frustration.\nIn 1933, Stanislavski worked on the second half of \"An Actor's Work\". By 1935, a version of the first volume was ready for publication in America, to which the publishers made significant abridgements. A significantly different and far more complete Russian edition, \"An Actor's Work on Himself, Part I\", was not published until 1938, just after Stanislavski's death. The second part of \"An Actor's Work on Himself\" was published in the Soviet Union in 1948; an English-language variant, \"Building a Character\", was published a year later. The third volume, \"An Actor's Work on a Role\", was published in the Soviet Union in 1957; its nearest English-language equivalent, \"Creating a Role\", was published in 1961. The differences between the Russian and English-language editions of volumes two and three were even greater than those of the first volume. In 2008, an English-language translation of the complete Russian edition of \"An Actor's Work\" was published, with one of \"An Actor's Work on a Role\" following in 2010.\nDevelopment of the Method of Physical Action.\nWhile recuperating in Nice at the end of 1929, Stanislavski began a production plan for Shakespeare's \"Othello\". Hoping to use this as the basis for \"An Actor's Work on a Role\", his plan offers the earliest exposition of the rehearsal process that became known as his Method of Physical Action. He first explored this approach practically in his work on \"Three Sisters\" and \"Carmen\" in 1934 and \"Moli\u00e8re\" in 1935.\nIn contrast to his earlier method of working on a play\u2014which involved extensive readings and analysis around a table before any attempt to physicalise its action\u2014Stanislavski now encouraged his actors to explore the action through its \"active analysis\". He felt that too much discussion in the early stages of rehearsal confused and inhibited the actors. Instead, focusing on the simplest physical actions, they improvised the sequence of dramatic situations given in the play. \"The best analysis of a play\", he argued, \"is to take action in the given circumstances.\" If the actor justified and committed to the truth of the actions (which are easier to shape and control than emotional responses), Stanislavski reasoned, they would evoke truthful thoughts and feelings.\nStanislavski's attitude to the use of emotion memory in rehearsals (as distinct from its use in actor training) had shifted over the years. Ideally, he felt, an instinctive identification with a character's situation should arouse an emotional response. The use of emotion memory in lieu of that had demonstrated a propensity for encouraging self-indulgence or hysteria in the actor. Its direct approach to feeling, Stanislavski felt, more often produced a block than the desired expression. Instead, an indirect approach to the subconscious via a focus on actions (supported by a commitment to the given circumstances and imaginative \"Magic Ifs\") was a more reliable means of luring the appropriate emotional response.\nThis shift in approach corresponded both with an increased attention to the structure and dynamic of the play as a whole and with a greater prominence given to the distinction between the planning of a role and its performance. In performance the actor is aware of only one step at a time, Stanislavski reasoned, but this focus risks the loss of the overall dynamic of a role in the welter of moment-to-moment detail. Consequently, the actor must also adopt a different point of view in order to plan the role in relation to its dramatic structure; this might involve adjusting the performance by holding back at certain moments and playing full out at others. A sense of the whole thereby informs the playing of each episode. Borrowing a term from Henry Irving, Stanislavski called this the \"perspective of the role\".\nEvery afternoon for five weeks during the summer of 1934 in Paris, Stanislavski worked with the American actress Stella Adler, who had sought his assistance with the blocks she had confronted in her performances. Given the emphasis that emotion memory had received in New York City, Adler was surprised to find that Stanislavski rejected the technique except as a last resort. The news that this was Stanislavski's approach would have significant repercussions in the US; Lee Strasberg angrily rejected it and refused to modify his version of the system.\nPolitical fortunes under Stalin.\nFollowing his heart attack in 1928, for the last decade of his life Stanislavski conducted most of his work writing, directing rehearsals, and teaching in his home on Leontievski Lane. In line with Joseph Stalin's policy of \"isolation and preservation\" towards certain internationally famous cultural figures, Stanislavski lived in a state of internal exile in Moscow. This protected him from the worst excesses of Stalin's \"Great Terror\".\nA number of articles critical of the terminology of Stanislavski's system appeared in the run-up to a RAPP conference in early 1931, at which the attacks continued. The system stood accused of philosophical idealism, of a-historicism, of disguising social and political problems under ethical and moral terms, and of \"biological psychologism\" (or \"the suggestion of fixed qualities in nature\"). In the wake of the first congress of the USSR Union of Writers (chaired by Maxim Gorky in August 1934), however, Socialist realism was established as the official party line in aesthetic matters. While the new policy would have disastrous consequences for the Soviet avant-garde, the MAT and Stanislavski's system were enthroned as exemplary models.\nFinal work at the Opera-Dramatic Studio.\nGiven the difficulties he had with completing his manual for actors, Stanislavski decided that he needed to found a new studio if he was to ensure his legacy. \"Our school will produce not just individuals,\" he wrote, \"but a whole company\". In June 1935, he began to instruct a group of teachers in the training techniques of the system and the rehearsal processes of the Method of Physical Action. Twenty students (out of 3,500 auditionees) were accepted for the dramatic section of the Opera-Dramatic Studio, where classes began on 15 November. Stanislavski arranged a curriculum of four years of study that focused exclusively on technique and method\u2014two years of the work detailed later in \"An Actor's Work\" and two of that in \"An Actor's Work on a Role\".\nOnce the students were acquainted with the training techniques of the first two years, Stanislavski selected \"Hamlet\" and \"Romeo and Juliet\" for their work on roles. He worked with the students in March and April 1937, focusing on their sequences of physical actions, on establishing their through-lines of action, and on rehearsing scenes anew in terms of the actors' tasks. By June 1938, the students were ready for their first public showing, at which they performed a selection of scenes to a small number of spectators. The Opera-Dramatic Studio embodied the most complete implementation of the training exercises that Stanislavski described in his manuals.\nFrom late 1936 onwards, Stanislavski began to meet regularly with Vsevolod Meyerhold, with whom he discussed the possibility of developing a common theatrical language. In 1938, they made plans to work together on a production and discussed a synthesis of Stanislavski's Method of Physical Action and Meyerhold's biomechanical training. On 8 March, Meyerhold took over the rehearsals for \"Rigoletto\", the staging of which he completed after Stanislavski's death. On his deathbed, Stanislavski declared to Yuri Bakhrushin that Meyerhold was \"my sole heir in the theatre\u2014here or anywhere else\". Stalin's police tortured and killed Meyerhold in February 1940.\nStanislavski died in his home at 3:45\u00a0pm on 7 August 1938, having probably suffered another heart attack five days earlier. Thousands of people attended his funeral. Three weeks after his death, his widow, Lilina, received an advanced copy of the Russian-language edition of the first volume of \"An Actor's Work\"\u2014the \"labour of his life\", as she called it. Stanislavski was buried in the Novodevichy Cemetery in Moscow, not far from the grave of Anton Chekhov.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\nPrimary sources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSecondary sources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

With an estimated population of 7.1 million people, Greater Khartoum is the largest urban area in Sudan.\nKhartoum is located at the confluence of the White Nile \u2013 flowing north from Lake Victoria \u2013 and the Blue Nile, flowing west from Lake Tana in Ethiopia. Divided by these two parts of the Nile, the Khartoum metropolitan area is a tripartite metropolis consisting of Khartoum proper and linked by bridges to Khartoum North ( ) and Omdurman ( ) to the west. The place where the two Niles meet is known as \"al-Mogran\" or \"al-Muqran\" (; English: \"The Confluence\").\nKhartoum was founded in 1821 by Muhammad Ali Pasha, north of the ancient city of Soba. In 1882 the British Empire took control of the Egyptian government, leaving the administration of Sudan in the hands of the Egyptians. At the outbreak of the Mahdist War, the British attempted to evacuate Anglo-Egyptian garrisons from Sudan but the Siege of Khartoum in 1884 resulted in the capture of the city by Mahdist forces and a massacre of the defending Anglo-Egyptian garrison. In 1898 it was reoccupied by British forces and was the seat of Anglo-Egyptian Sudan's government until 1956.\nIn 1956, the city was designated as the capital of an independent Sudan. Three hostages were killed during the attack on the Saudi Embassy in Khartoum in 1973.\nIn 2008, the Justice and Equality Movement engaged in combat in the city with the Sudanese Armed Forces as part of the War in Darfur. The Khartoum massacre occurred in 2019 during the Sudanese Revolution. Between 2023 and 2025, the city saw extensive combat during the civil war involving the armed forces and the Rapid Support Forces (RSF), affecting Khartoum International Airport and other critical sites. In 2025, the Sudanese armed forces recaptured Khartoum from the RSF, leaving widespread destruction.\nKhartoum is an economic and trade center in North Africa, with rail lines from Port Sudan and El-Obeid. It is served by Khartoum International Airport with the New Khartoum International Airport under construction. Several national and cultural institutions are in Khartoum and its metropolitan area, including the National Museum of Sudan, the Khalifa House Museum, the University of Khartoum, and the Sudan University of Science and Technology.\nEtymology.\nThe origin of the word \"Khartoum\" is uncertain. Some Scholars posit that the name derives from the Dinka words (Dinka-Bor dialect) or (as is the pronunciation in various Dinka dialects), translating to \"place where rivers meet\". This is supported by historical accounts which place the Dinka homeland in central Sudan (around present-day Khartoum) as recently as the 13th-17th centuries A.D.\nOne folk etymology is that it is derived from Arabic ( 'trunk' or 'hose'), probably referring to the narrow strip of land extending between the Blue and White Niles. \nCaptain J.A. Grant, who reached Khartoum in 1863 with Captain Speke's expedition, thought the name was most probably from the Arabic ( 'safflower', i.e., \"Carthamus tinctorius\"), which was cultivated extensively in Egypt for its oil to be used as fuel. Some scholars speculate that the word derives from the Nubian word , meaning \"the abode of Atum\", Atum being the Nubian and Egyptian god of creation. Other Beja scholars suggest \"Khartoum\" is derived from the Beja word , \"meeting\". Sociologist Vincent J. Donovan notes that in the Nilotic Maa language of the Maasai people, means \"we have acquired\" and that the geographical location of Khartoum is where Maasai oral tradition claims that the ancestors of the Maasai first acquired cattle.\nHistory.\n19th century.\nIn 1821, Khartoum was established north of the ancient city of Soba, by Isma'il Kamil Pasha, the third son of Egypt's ruler, Muhammad Ali Pasha, who had just incorporated Sudan into his realm. Originally, Khartoum served as an outpost for the Egyptian Army. Egypt shifted the seat of the colonial government from Wad Madani to Khartoum in 1823, which became a permanent settlement and underwent rapid development in the next decades. With its elevation to capital status, Khartoum quickly grew into a regional center of trade, serving as a rest area on the caravan route from Ethiopia to Egypt, but also becoming a major focal point for the slave trade.\nA significant change took place in 1854, when most of the city was destroyed by heavy rains and floods. It was rebuilt with houses made out of mud and stones, replacing those made out of thatch and straw. Khartoum also became the seat of several European consulates and the Apostolic Vicariate of Central Africa. European pressure and influence forced Egypt to close the city's public slave market in 1854, although slaves continued to be sold and trafficked in large numbers, specifically from the Blue Nile region and the Nuba Mountains, as well as down the White Nile (the Dinka and Shilluk territories). According to the British explorer Samuel Baker, who visited Khartoum in 1862, slavery was the industry \"that kept Khartoum going as a bustling town\". \nOn 13 March 1884, troops loyal to the Mahdi Muhammad Ahmad began the siege of Khartoum against the Egyptian garrison led by the British General Charles George Gordon. Despite being fortified by trenches and a wall connecting the Blue and White Niles, the city was conquered by the Mahdists on 26 January 1885 and the entire garrison was annihilated. Many of the inhabitants were massacred or enslaved and the survivors were deported to the newly established Omdurman, while Khartoum was largely destroyed and abandoned. \nWith the reconquest of Sudan by Anglo-Egyptian forces in 1898, Khartoum was established as the capital of Anglo-Egyptian Sudan. Herbert Kitchener became Governor-General of the Sudan in September 1898, and began a programme of reconstruction, Khartoum was rebuilt according to a street plan in the shape of the Union Jack. Khartoum Bahri was established as a garrison comprising a dockyard and a railhead to Egypt, while Omdurman, remained the most populous part and largely kept its old shape. He ordered the mosques of Khartoum rebuilt and guaranteed freedom of religion to all citizens. He also prevented Christian missionaries from trying to proselytize the local Muslims.\n20th century.\nThe city rapidly grew and developed under British administration. Under Reginald Wingate (1899\u20131916), the Governor-General's Palace in Khartoum was rebuilt using red bricks, with sandstone used for the corners. The buildings in Khartoum proper were modeled after Victorian architecture, with a distinct Middle Eastern influence as well as Mediterranean-style windows and balconies. The Gordon Memorial College (now the University of Khartoum) was opened in 1903, and a new railway to Port Sudan was completed in 1919. These developments prompted large migration from rural areas, resulting in an increase in the city's population. By 1930, Khartoum was estimated to have a population of over 50,000.\nKhartoum continued to grow after it was declared the capital of the newly independent Republic of Sudan in 1956. Within the following years, the Municipal Stadium, the Khartoum American School and the Bank of Sudan would be established. This large scale development would spurred rural to urban migration, by 1964 Khartoum's population had ballooned to 185,000. In the 1973 census Khartoum would have a population of 334,000 inhabitants.\nIn 1973, the city was the site of a hostage crisis in which members of Black September held 10 hostages at the Saudi Arabian embassy, five of them diplomats. The US ambassador, the US deputy ambassador, and the Belgian \"charg\u00e9 d'affaires\" were murdered. The remaining hostages were released. A 1973 United States Department of State document, declassified in 2006, concluded: \"The Khartoum operation was planned and carried out with the full knowledge and personal approval of Yasser Arafat.\"\nIn 1977, the first oil pipeline between Khartoum and Port Sudan was completed. The Organization of African Unity summit of 18\u201322 July 1978 was held in Khartoum, during which Sudan was awarded the OAU presidency.\nThroughout the 1970s and 1980s, Khartoum was the destination of hundreds of thousands of refugees fleeing conflicts in neighboring nations such as Chad, Eritrea, Ethiopia and Uganda. Many Eritrean and Ethiopian refugees assimilated into society, while others settled in large slums on the city's outskirts. Since the mid-1980s, large numbers of refugees from South Sudan and Darfur \u2013 fleeing the violence of the Second Sudanese Civil War and Darfur conflict \u2013 have settled around Khartoum.\nIn 1991, Osama bin Laden purchased a house in the affluent al-Riyadh neighborhood of the city and another in Soba. He lived there until 1996, when he was banished from the country. Following the 1998 U.S. embassy bombings, the United States accused bin Laden's al-Qaeda group and, on 20 August, launched cruise missile attacks on the al-Shifa pharmaceutical factory in Khartoum North. The factory's destruction created diplomatic tension between the U.S. and Sudan. The factory ruins are now a tourist attraction.\nIn November 1991, the government of President Omar al-Bashir sought to remove half the population from the city. The residents, deemed squatters, were mostly southern Sudanese whom the government feared could be potential rebel sympathizers. Around 425,000 people were placed in five \"Peace Camps\" in the desert an hour's drive from Khartoum. The camps were watched over by heavily armed security guards, many relief agencies were banned from assisting, and \"the nearest food was at a market four miles away, a vast journey in the desert heat\". Many residents were reduced to having only burlap sacks as housing. The intentional displacement was part of a large urban renewal plan backed by the housing minister, Sharaf Bannaga.\n21st century.\nThe sudden death of SPLA head and vice-president of Sudan John Garang in late July 2005, was followed by three days of violent riots in the capital. Order was finally restored after southern Sudanese politicians and tribal leaders sent strong messages to the rioters. The death toll was at least 24, as youths from southern Sudan attacked northern Sudanese and clashed with security forces.\nThe African Union summit of 16\u201324 January 2006 was held in Khartoum; as was the Arab League summit of 28\u201329 March 2006, during which they elected Sudan the Arab League presidency.\nOn 10 May 2008, the Darfur rebel group Justice and Equality Movement attacked the city with the goal of toppling Omar al-Bashir's government. The Sudanese government held off the assault.\nOn 23 October 2012, an explosion at the Yarmouk munitions factory killed two people and injured another person. The Sudanese government claimed that the explosion was the result of an Israeli airstrike.\nOn 3 June 2019, Khartoum was the site of the Khartoum massacre, where over 100 dissidents were murdered (the government said 61 were killed), hundreds more injured and 70 women raped by Rapid Support Forces (RSF) soldiers in order to forcefully disperse the peaceful protests calling for a civilian government.\nOn 1 July 2020, activists demanded that al-Zibar Basha street in Khartoum be renamed. Al-Zubayr Rahma Mansur was a slave trader and the al-Zibar Basha street leads to the military base where the 2019 Khartoum massacre took place.\nOn 26 October 2021, the city was locked down following a military coup that left at least 7 dead, triggering protests and calls for a general strike. Prime minister Abdalla Hamdok was arrested during the coup, and held along with other cabinet members in an unknown location.\nOn 15 April 2023, fighting between the Sudanese Armed Forces and the RSF broke out across Sudan, including in Khartoum. Fighting was reported at the presidential palace, the RSF's headquarters, Khartoum International Airport and Merowe Airport, which the RSF claimed to have captured. The Sudanese Armed Forces regained full control of Khartoum on 26 March 2025.\nGeography.\nLocation.\nKhartoum is located at the confluence of the Blue Nile and the White Nile. \nKhartoum is relatively flat, at elevation , as the Nile flows northeast past Omdurman to Shendi, at elevation about away.\nClimate.\nKhartoum features a hot desert climate (K\u00f6ppen climate classification \"BWh\") with a dry season occurring during winter, typical of the Saharo-Sahelian zone, which marks the progressive passage between the Sahara Desert's vast arid areas and the Sahel's vast semi-arid areas. The climate is extremely dry for most of the year, with about eight months when average rainfall is lower than . The very long dry season is itself divided into a warm, very dry season between November and February, as well as a very hot, dry season between March and May. During this part of the year, hot, dry continental trade winds from deserts, such as the harmattan, sweep over the region; the weather is stable and very dry.\nThe very irregular, very brief, rainy season lasts about 1 month as the maximum rainfall is recorded in August, with about . The rainy season is characterized by a seasonal reverse of wind regimes, when the Intertropical Convergence Zone goes northerly. Average annual rainfall is very low, with only of precipitation. Khartoum records on average six days with or more and 19 days with or more of rainfall. The highest temperatures occur during two periods in the year: the first at the late dry season, when average high temperatures consistently exceed from April to June, and the second at the early dry season, when average high temperatures exceed in September and October. Temperatures cool off somewhat during the night, with Khartoum's lowest average low temperature of the year, in January, just above . Khartoum is one of the hottest major cities on Earth, with annual mean temperatures hovering around . The city also has very warm winters. In no month does the average monthly high temperature fall below . This is something not seen in other major cities with hot desert climates, such as Riyadh, Baghdad and Phoenix.\nDemographics.\nAlmost 250,000 Syrians lived in Khartoum as of 2019, representing 5% of the total population of the city. Most are young men who have fled war in Syria. Sudan was the only country in the world to accept travelers carrying a Syrian passport who lacked a visa.\nEconomy.\nAfter the signing of the historic Comprehensive Peace Agreement between the Government of Sudan and the Sudan People's Liberation Movement (SPLA), the Government of Sudan began a massive development project. In 2007, the biggest projects in Khartoum were the Al-Mogran Development Project, two five-star hotels, a new airport, El Mek Nimr Bridge (finished in October 2007) and the Tuti Bridge that links Khartoum to Tuti Island.\nIn the 21st century, Khartoum developed based on Sudan's oil wealth (although the independence of South Sudan in 2011 affected the economy of Sudan negatively). The center of the city has tree-lined streets. Khartoum has the highest concentration of economic activity in the country. This has changed as major economic developments take place in other parts of the country, like oil exploration in the south, the Giad Industrial Complex in Al Jazirah state and White Nile Sugar Project in Central Sudan, and the Merowe Dam in the North.\nAmong the city's industries are printing, glass manufacturing, food processing, and textiles. Petroleum products are now produced in the far north of Khartoum state, providing fuel and jobs for the city. One of Sudan's largest refineries is located in northern Khartoum.\nRetailing.\nThe Souq al Arabi is Khartoum's largest open air market. The souq is spread over several blocks in the center of Khartoum proper just south of the Great Mosque (Mesjid al-Kabir) and the minibus station. It is divided into separate sections, including one focused entirely on gold.\nAl Qasr Street and Al Jamhoriyah Street are considered the most famous high streets in Khartoum State.\nAfra Mall is located in the southern suburb of Arkeweet. The Afra Mall has a supermarket, retail outlets, coffee shops, a bowling alley, movie theaters, and a children's playground.\nIn 2011, Sudan opened the Hotel Section and part of the food court of the new, Corinthia Hotel Tower. The Mall/Shopping section is still under construction.\nEducation.\nKhartoum is the main location for most of Sudan's top educational bodies. There are four main levels of education:\nTransportation.\nKhartoum is home to the largest airport in Sudan, Khartoum International Airport. It is the main hub for Sudan Airways, Sudan's main carrier. A new airport was planned for the southern outskirts of the city, but with Khartoum's rapid growth and consequent urban sprawl, the airport is still located in the heart of the city.\nKhartoum's transportation is limited to the vehicular road system, with buses and personal vehicles comprising the main types of vehicles. As with many cities in the continent, parts of Khartoum are connected through privately owned buses.\nKhartoum has a number of bridges across both tributaries of the Nile. The Mac Nimir Bridge, the Blue Nile Road &amp; Railway Bridge, the Cooper Bridge (also known as the Armed Forces Bridge), and the Elmansheya Bridge span the Blue Nile, connecting Khartoum to Khartoum North. The Omdurman Bridge, the Victory Bridge, and the Al-Dabbasin Bridge span the White Nile, connecting Khartoum to Omdurman. The Tuti Bridge connects Tuti Island with Khartoum. Prior to the construction of the Tuti Bridge in 2008, residents of Tuti Island relied on water taxis to cross the Blue Nile into Khartoum.\nKhartoum has rail lines from Wadi Halfa, Port Sudan on the Red Sea, and El Obeid. All are operated by Sudan Railways.\nArchitecture.\nThe architecture of Khartoum reflects the city's history since the early 1820s and is marked by both native Sudanese, Turkish, British and modern buildings. In general, the architecture of Sudan reflects a wide diversity in its shapes, materials, and use.\nSince independence, the people of Sudan have introduced new infrastructure and technology, which has led to new and innovative building concepts, ideas and construction techniques.\nCulture.\nMuseums.\nThe largest museum in Sudan is the National Museum of Sudan. Founded in 1971, it contains works from different epochs of Sudanese history. Among the exhibits are two Egyptian temples of Buhen and Semna, originally built by Pharaoh Hatshepsut and Pharaoh Tuthmosis III, respectively, but relocated to Khartoum upon the flooding of Lake Nasser.\nThe Republican Palace Museum, opened in 2000, is located in the former Anglican All Saints' cathedral on Sharia al-Jama'a, next to the historical Presidential Palace.\nThe Ethnographic Museum is located on Sharia al-Jama'a, close to the Mac Nimir Bridge.\nBotanical gardens.\nKhartoum is home to one of the oldest botanical gardens in Africa, National Botanical Garden in the Mogran district of the city.\nClubs.\nKhartoum is home to several clubs, including the Blue Nile Sailing Club, social clubs such as the German Club, the Greek Club, the Coptic Club, the Syrian Club and the International Club, as well as football clubs Al Khartoum SC and Al Ahli Khartoum.\nPlaces of worship.\nThe places of worship in Khartoum primarily consist of Muslim mosques. There are also Christian churches and temples: Coptic Orthodox Church, St. Matthew's Cathedral, Khartoum, Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Khartoum (Catholic Church), Sudan Interior Church (Baptist World Alliance), the Greek Orthodox Church of the Annunciation and Presbyterian Church in Sudan (World Communion of Reformed Churches).\nIn popular culture.\nLiterature.\nKhartoum's unique history and cultural significance have inspired literary works that explore its past, present, and future. For example, in \"Reading Khartoum\", the city is depicted as a space shaped by movement, political instability, and socio-cultural changes, resulting in underlying layers of meanings and ambiguity. Arabic-written poetry also offers a personalized glimpse of the city, reflecting its distinct cultural appearance and setting it apart from other Arab and African cities.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

A white, nontoxic solid, it is a common dicarboxylic acid. Relevant to its biological roles, it exists in water as its conjugate base \u03b1-ketoglutarate. It is also classified as a 2-ketocarboxylic acid. \u03b2-Ketoglutaric acid is an isomer. \"Ketoglutaric acid\" and \"ketoglutarate\", when not qualified as \u03b1 or \u03b2, almost always refers respectively to \u03b1-ketoglutaric acid or \u03b1-ketoglutarate.\n\u03b1-Ketoglutarate is an intermediate in the citric acid cycle, a cycle that supplies the energy to cells. It is also an intermediate in or product of several other metabolic pathways. These include its being a component of metabolic pathways that: make amino acids and in the process regulate the cellular levels of carbon, nitrogen, and ammonia; reduce the cellular levels of potentially toxic reactive oxygen species; and synthesize the neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid. It also acts as a direct stimulator of, or cofactor (i.e., required for but does not itself stimulate) for various cellular functions as defined in studies that are primarily preclinical (i.e., conducted in animal models of disease or on animal or human tissues). These studies have provided evidence that \u03b1-ketoglutarate contributes to regulating: kidney function; the benefits that resistance exercise has in reducing obesity, strengthening muscles, and preventing muscle atrophy; glucose tolerance as defined in glucose tolerance tests; aging and the development of changes that are associated with aging including old age-related disorders and diseases; the development and/or progression of certain types of cancer and inflammations; and the differentiation of immature T cells into mature T cells.\nFunctions.\nMetabolic interactions.\nCitric acid cycle.\n\u03b1-Ketoglutarate is a component of the citric acid cycle, a cyclical metabolic pathway located in the mitochondria. This cycle supplies the energy that cells need by sequentially metabolizing (indicated by \u2192) citrate through seven intermediate metabolites and then converting the eighth intermediate metabolite, oxaloacetate, back to citrate:\ncitrate \u2192 cis-aconitate \u2192 isocitrate \u2192 \u03b1-ketoglutarate \u2192 succinyl-CoA \u2192 succinate \u2192 fumarate \u2192 malate \u2192 oxaloacetate \u2192 citrate\nIn this cycle, the enzyme isocitrate dehydrogenase 3 converts isocitrate (isocitrate has 4 isomers of which only the (\u2212)-d-threo-isomer is the naturally occurring isomer in the citric acid cycle.) to \u03b1-ketoglutarate which in the next step is converted to succinyl-CoA by the oxoglutarate dehydrogenase complex of enzymes.\nAside from the citric acid cycle, \u03b1-ketoglutarate is made by a) glutaminolysis in which the enzyme glutaminase removes the amino group from glutamine to form glutamate which is converted to \u03b1-ketoglutarate by any one of three enzymes, glutamate dehydrogenase, alanine transaminase, or aspartate transaminase (see The glutaminolytic pathways); and various pyridoxal phosphate-dependent transamination reactions mediated by, e.g., the alanine transaminase enzyme, in which glutamate is converted to \u03b1-Ketoglutarate by \"donating\" its to other compounds (see transamination). Acting in these pathways, \u03b1-ketoglutarate contributes to the production of amino acids such as glutamine, proline, arginine, and lysine as well as the lowering of cellular carbon and nitrogen (i.e., N) levels; this prevents excessive levels of these two potentially toxic elements from accumulating in cells and tissues. The neurotoxin, ammonia (i.e., ), is also prevented form accumulating in tissues. In this metabolic pathway the group on an amino acid is transferred to \u03b1-ketoglutarate; this forms the \u03b1-keto acid of the original amino acid and the amine-containing product of \u03b1-ketoglutarate, glutamate. The cellular glutamate passes into the circulation and is taken up by the liver where it delivers its acquired group to the urea cycle. In effect, the latter pathway removes excess ammonia from the body in the form of urinary urea.\nReactive oxygen species.\n\u03b1-Ketoglutarate is one of the non-enzymatic antioxidant agents. It reacts with hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) to form succinate, carbon dioxide (i.e., ), and water (i.e., () thereby lowering the levels of H2O2. Additionally, \u03b1-ketoglutarate increases the activity of superoxide dismutase, which converts the highly toxic (O2-) radical to molecular oxygen (i.e., O2) and H2O2.\nFormation of the neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid.\nA study conducted on the GABAergic neurons (i.e., nerve cells) in the neocortex of rat brains reported that the cytosolic form of the aspartate transaminase enzyme metabolizes \u03b1-ketoglutarate to glutamate which in turn is metabolized by glutamic acid decarboxylase to the inhibitory neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid. These metabolic reactions occur at the ends of the inhibitory axons of the GABAergic neurons and result in the release of gamma-aminobutyric acid which then inhibits the activation of nearby neurons.\nBioactions of \u03b1-Ketoglutarate.\nOXGR1 receptor-dependent bioactions.\nOXGR1 (also known as GPR99) is a G protein-coupled receptor, i.e., a receptor located on the surface membrane of cells that binds certain ligands and is thereby stimulated to activate G proteins that elicit pre-programmed responses in their parent cells. OXGR1 was identified as a receptor for: a) \u03b1-ketoglutarate in 2004; b) three leukotrienes viz., leukotrienes E4, C4, and D4 in 2013. and c) itaconate in 2023. These ligands have the following relative potencies in stimulating responses in OXGR1-bearing cells (Note that LTE4 can stimulate OXGR1 at concentrations far lower than those of the other four ligands):\nLTE4 \u00bb LTC4 = LTD4 &gt; \u03b1-ketoglutarate = itaconate.\nIt may be difficult to determine if an OXGR1-stimulating agent elicits a functional response by activating OXGR1 as opposed to some other mechanism. To make this distinction, studies have shown that the action of an OXGR1-activating agent on cultured cells, cultured tissues, or animals does not occur or is reduced when these cells, tissues, or animals have been altered so that they do not express or express greatly reduced levels of the OXGR1 protein, or when their actions are inhibited by an OXGR1 receptor antagonists. OXGR1 is inhibited by Montelukast, a well-known inhibitor of the cysteinyl leukotriene receptor 1, i.e., the receptor for LTD4, LTC4, and LTE4. Montelukast also blocks the binding of these leukotrienes to, and thereby inhibits their activation of, OXGR1. One study presented evidence suggesting that \u03b1-ketoglutarate binds to OXGR1. It is assumed that Montelukast similarly blocks \u03b1-ketoglutarate's binding to, and thereby inhibits its activation of OXGR1.\nKidney functions.\nThe pendrin protein promotes the electroneutral exchange of tissue chloride (Cl\u2212) for urinary bicarbonate (HCO3\u2212) in the apical surfaces (i.e., surfaces facing the urine) of the kidney's renal \u03b2-intercalated cells (also termed type B intercalated cells) and non-\u03b1 non-\u03b2 intercalated cells (also termed non-A non-B intercalated cells) in the kidney's collecting duct system (i.e., CDS). A study in mice found that OXGR1 colocalizes with pendrin in the \u03b2-intercalated cells and non-\u03b1 non-\u03b2 intercalated cells lining the tubules of their kidney's CDS. The intercalated cells in the CDS tubules isolated from mice used pendrin in cooperation with the electroneutral sodium bicarbonate exchanger 1 protein to mediate the Cl\u2212 for HCO3\u2212 exchange. \u03b1-Ketoglutarate stimulated the rate of this exchange in CDS tubules isolated from control mice (i.e., mice that had the \"Oxgr1\" gene and protein) but not in CDS tubules isolated from \"Oxgr1\" gene knockout mice (i.e., mice that lacked the \"Oxgr1\" gene and protein). This study also showed that the \u03b1-ketoglutarate in the blood of mice filtered through their kidney's glomeruli into the proximal tubules and loops of Henle where it was reabsorbed. Mice drinking water with a basic pH (i.e., &gt;7) due to the addition of sodium bicarbonate and mice lacking the \"Oxgr1\" gene and protein who drink water without sodium bicarbonate had urines that were more basic (i.e., pH about 7.8) and contained higher levels of urinary \u03b1-ketoglutarate than control mice drinking water without this additive. Furthermore, \"Oxgr1\" gene knockout mice drinking sodium bicarbonate-rich water developed metabolic alkalosis (body tissue pH levels higher than normal) that was associated with blood bicarbonate levels significantly higher and blood chloride levels significantly lower than those in control mice drinking the sodium bicarbonate-rich water. Several other studies confirmed these findings and reported that cells in the proximal tubules of mice synthesize \u03b1-ketoglutarate and either broke it down thereby reducing its urine levels or secreted it into the tubules' lumens thereby increasing its urine levels. Another study showed that a) \"In silico\" computer simulations strongly suggested that \u03b1-ketoglutarate bound to mouse OXGPR1; b) suspensions of canal duct cells isolated from the collecting ducts, loops of Henle, vasa recta, and interstitium of mouse kidneys raised their cytosolic ionic calcium, i.e., Ca2+ levels in response to \u03b1-ketoglutarate but this response (which is an indicator of cell activation) was blocked by pretreating the cells with Montelukast; and c) compared to mice not treated with streptozotocin, streptozotocin-induced diabetic mice (an animal disease model of diabetes) urinated only a small amount of the ionic sodium () that they drank or received by intravenous injections; Montelukast reversed this defect in the streptozotocin-pretreated mice. These results indicate that in mice: a) \u03b1-ketoglutarate stimulates kidney OXGR1 to activate pendrin-mediated reabsorption of sodium and chloride by type B and non-A\u2013non-B intercalated cells; b) high alkaline (i.e., sodium bicarbonate) intake produces significant increases in urine pH and \u03b1-ketoglutarate levels and impairs secretion of bicarbonate into the CDS tubules' lumens; c) the acid\u2013base balance (i.e., levels of acids relative to their bases) in the face of high alkali intake depends on the activation of OXGR1 by \u03b1-ketoglutarate; d) alkaline loading directly or indirectly stimulates \u03b1-ketoglutarate secretion into the kidney's proximal tubules where further down these tubules it activates OXGR1 and thereby the absorption and secretion of various agents that contribute to restoring a physiologically normal acid-base balance; and e) \u03b1-ketoglutarate stimulates OXGR1-bearing CDS cells to raise their levels of cytosolic Ca2+) and in diabetic mice (and presumably other conditions involving high levels of blood and/or urine glucose) to increase these cells uptake of .\nResistance exercise, obesity, and muscle atrophy.\nResistance exercise is exercising a muscle or muscle group against external resistance (see strength training). Studies have found that: a) mice feeding on a high fat or normal diet and given the resistance exercise of repeatedly climbing up a 1 meter ladder for 40 minutes had higher levels of \u03b1-ketoglutarate in their blood and seven muscles than non-exercising mice feeding respectively on the high fat or normal diet; b) mice conducting ladder climbing for several weeks and eating a high fat diet developed lower fat tissue masses and higher lean tissue masses than non-exercising mice on this diet; c) mice not in exercise training fed \u03b1-ketoglutarate likewise developed lower fat tissue and higher lean tissue masses than \u03b1-ketoglutarate-unfed, non-exercising mice; d) OXGR1 was strongly expressed in the mouse adrenal gland inner medullas and either resistance training or oral \u03b1-ketoglutarate increased this tissue's levels of the mRNA that is responsible for the synthesis of OXGR1; e) \u03b1-ketoglutarate stimulated chromaffin cells isolated from mouse adrenal glands to release epinephrine but reduction of these cells' OXGR1 levels by small interfering RNA reduced this response; f) \u03b1-ketoglutarate increased the blood serum levels of epinephrine in mice expressing OXGR1 but not in \"Oxgr1\" gene knockout mice (i.e., mice lacking the \"OXGR1\" gene and protein); g) mice on the high fat diet challenged with \u03b1-ketoglutarate increased their blood serum levels of epinephrine and developed lower fat tissue masses and higher lean tissue masses but neither \"OXGR1\" gene knockout mice nor mice that had only their adrenal glands' \"OXGR1\" gene knocked out showed these responses; and h) \"OXGR1\" gene knockout mice fed the high fat diet developed muscle protein degradation, muscle atrophy (i.e., wasting), and falls in body weight whereas control mice did not show these fat diet-induced changes. These findings indicate that in mice resistance exercise increases muscle production as well as serum levels of \u03b1-ketoglutarate which in turn suppresses diet-induced obesity (i.e., low body fat and high lean body masses) at least in part by stimulating the OXGR1 on adrenal gland chromaffin cells to release epinephrine. Another study reported that middle\u2010aged, i.e., 10\u2010month\u2010old, mice had lower serum levels of \u03b1-ketoglutarate than 2\u2010month\u2010old mice. Middle aged mice fed a high fat diet gained body weight and fat mass in the lower parts of their bodies and had impaired glucose tolerance as defined in glucose tolerance tests. Adding \u03b1-ketoglutarate to the drinking water of these mice inhibited the development of these changes. These results suggest that drinking the \u03b1-ketoglutarate-rich water replenished the otherwise diminished supplies of \u03b1-ketoglutarate in middle aged mice; the replenished supply of \u03b1-ketoglutarate thereby became available to suppress obesity and improve glucose tolerance. Finally, a study in rats feed a low fat or high fat diet for 27 weeks and drinking \u03b1-ketoglutarate-rich water for the last 12 weeks of this 27 week period decreased their fat issue masses and increased their whole-body insulin sensitivity as defined in glucose tolerance tests. Rats fed either of these diets but not given \u03b1-ketoglutarate-rich water did not show these changes. This study indicates that \u03b1-ketoglutarate regulates body fat mass and insulin sensitivity in rats as well as mice.\nOXGR1 receptor-independent bioactions.\nThe following actions of \u03b1-ketoglutarate have not been evaluated for their dependency on activating OXGR1 and are here assumed to be OXGR1-independent. Futures studies are needed to determine if OXGR1 contributes in whole or part to these actions of \u03b1-ketoglutarate.\nAging and diseases associated with aging.\n\u03b1-Ketoglutarate has been reported to increase the life span and/or delay the development of old age-related diseases in a species of roundworms and in mice. It nearly doubled the life span and delayed age-related deteriorations (e.g., decline in rapid, coordinated body movements) of \"Caenorhabditis elegans\" roundworms when added to their cell cultures. Similarly, mice fed a diet high in calcium-bound \u03b1-ketoglutarate had a longer life span and shorter length of time in which they suffered old age-related morbidities (e.g., increased frailty, hair loss, and changes in body weight). Cell cultures of splenocytes (i.e., primarily T cells) from the \u03b1-ketoglutarate-fed mice produced higher levels of the anti-inflammatory cytokine, interleukin-10, than splenocytes from mice not fed \u03b1-ketoglutarate. (Chronic low-grade inflammation which might be inhibited by interleukin-10, is associated with the development of old age-related disorders and diseases.)\nAs individuals age, their DNA develops additions of a methyl group (-) to a cystine adjacent to a guanine (termed a CpG island) in an increasing number of CpG islands close to certain genes. These methylations often suppress the expression of the genes to which they are close. Assays (termed epigenetic clock tests) that determine the presence of methylations of cystines in CpG islands for genes have been used to define an individual's biological age. The Rejuvant study reported that the median and range of the biological age of females before treatment was 62.15 (range, 46.4 to 73) years and fell to 55.55 (range 33.4 to 63.7) years after an average of 7 months treatment. These values for men were 61.85 (range 41.9 to 79.7) years before and 53.3 (33 to 74.9) years after treatment. Overall, the combined group of males and females showed an average fall in biological age of 8 years compared to before treatment. The \"p\"-value for this difference was extraordinarily significant, i.e., 6.538x10-12, in showing that this treatment decreased the participants' biological ages. However, the study did not: a) include a control group (i.e., concurrent study of individuals taking a placebo instead of Rejuvant\u00ae); b) determine if the retinyl palmitate, vitamin A, and/or calcium given with \u03b1-ketoglutarate contributed to the changes in biological ages; and c) disclose which genes were tracked for the methylation of their CpG island. The study recommended that studies need to include control groups taking a placebo or the appropriate dosages of retinyl palmitate, vitamin A, and calcium. Also, TruMe Labs, who were the maker and marketer of the biological age assay used in this study, sponsored part of the study and contributed three of its employees as authors to the study.\nFe2+/\u03b1-ketoglutarate-dependent dioxygenase enzymes and TET enzymes.\n\u03b1-Ketoglutarate is a cofactor that activates histone-lysine demethylase protein superfamily. This superfamily consists of two groups, the FAD-dependent amine oxidases which do not require \u03b1-ketoglutarate for activation and the Fe2+/\u03b1-ketoglutarate-dependent dioxygenases (Fe2+ is the ferrous form of iron, i.e., Fe2+). The latter group of more than 30 enzymes is classified into 7 subfamilies termed histone lysine demethylases, i.e., HDM2 to HDM7, with each subfamily having multiple members. These HDMs are characterized by containing a Jumonji C (JmjC) protein domain. They function as dioxygenases or hydroxylases to remove methyl groups from the lysine residues on the histones enveloping DNA and thereby alter the expression of diverse genes. These altered gene expressions lead to a wide range of changes in the functions of various cell types and thereby caused the development and/or progression of various cancers, pathological inflammations, and other disorders (see \u03b1-Ketoglutarate-dependent demethylase biological functions). The TET enzymes (i.e., ten-eleven translocation (TET) methylcytosine dioxygenase family of enzymes) consists of three members, TET-1, TET-2, and TET-3. Like the Fe2+/\u03b1-ketoglutarate-dependent dioxygenases, all three TET enzymes require Fe2+ and \u03b1-ketoglutarate as cofactors to become activated. Unlike the dioxygenases, however, they remove methyl groups from the 5-methylcytosines of DNA sites that regulate the expression of nearby genes. These demethylations have a variety of effects including, similar to the Fe2+/\u03b1-ketoglutarate-dependent dioxygenases, alteration of the development and/or progression of various cancers, immune responses, and other disorders (see functions of TET enzymes).\n\u03b2-Ketoglutaric acid and TET-2.\n\u03b2-Ketoglutaric acid has been detected in the saliva of individuals chewing betel quid, a complex mixture derived from betel nuts mixed with various other materials. Chronic chewing betel quid is associated with the development of certain cancers, particularly those in the oral cavity. The study showed that \u03b2-ketoglutaric acid bound to the cancer-promoting protein TET-2 thereby inhibiting \u03b1-ketoglutarate's binding to this protein. Since \u03b1-ketoglutarate's binding of TET-2 is thought to be required for it to activate TET-2, the study suggested that \u03b2-ketoglutaric acid may not fulfill the requirements for TET-2 to be activatable and therefore may prove able to block \u03b1-ketoglutarate's cancer-promoting as well as inflammation-promoting and other actions that involve its activation of TET-2.\nImmune regulation.\nUnder glutamine-deprived conditions, \u03b1-ketoglutarate promotes na\u00efve CD4+ T cells differentiation into inflammation-promoting Th1 cells while inhibiting their differentiation into inflammation-inhibiting Treg cells thereby promoting certain inflammation responses.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

In the Keynesian view, aggregate demand does not necessarily equal the productive capacity of the economy. It is influenced by a host of factors that sometimes behave erratically and impact production, employment, and inflation.\nKeynesian economists generally argue that aggregate demand is volatile and unstable and that, consequently, a market economy often experiences inefficient macroeconomic outcomes, including recessions when demand is too low and inflation when demand is too high. Further, they argue that these economic fluctuations can be mitigated by economic policy responses coordinated between a government and their central bank. In particular, fiscal policy actions taken by the government and monetary policy actions taken by the central bank, can help stabilize economic output, inflation, and unemployment over the business cycle. Keynesian economists generally advocate a regulated market economy \u2013 predominantly private sector, but with an active role for government intervention during recessions and depressions.\nKeynesian economics developed during and after the Great Depression from the ideas presented by Keynes in his 1936 book, \"The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money\". Keynes' approach was a stark contrast to the aggregate supply-focused classical economics that preceded his book. Interpreting Keynes's work is a contentious topic, and several schools of economic thought claim his legacy.\nKeynesian economics has developed new directions to study wider social and institutional patterns during the past several decades. Post-Keynesian and New Keynesian economists have developed Keynesian thought by adding concepts about income distribution and labor market frictions and institutional reform. Alejandro Antonio advocates for \u201cequality of place\u201d instead of \u201cequality of opportunity\u201d by supporting structural economic changes and universal service access and worker protections. Greenwald and Stiglitz represent New Keynesian economists who show how contemporary market failures regarding credit rationing and wage rigidity can lead to unemployment persistence in modern economies. Scholars including K.H. Lee explain how uncertainty remains important according to Keynes because expectations and conventions together with psychological behaviour known as \"animal spirits\" affect investment and demand. Tregub's empirical research of French consumption patterns between 2001 and 2011 serves as contemporary evidence for demand-based economic interventions. The ongoing developments prove that Keynesian economics functions as a dynamic and lasting framework to handle economic crises and create inclusive economic policies.\nKeynesian economics, as part of the neoclassical synthesis, served as the standard macroeconomic model in the developed nations during the later part of the Great Depression, World War II, and the post-war economic expansion (1945\u20131973). It was developed in part to attempt to explain the Great Depression and to help economists understand future crises. It lost some influence following the oil shock and resulting stagflation of the 1970s. Keynesian economics was later redeveloped as New Keynesian economics, becoming part of the contemporary new neoclassical synthesis, that forms current-day mainstream macroeconomics. The 2008 financial crisis sparked the 2008\u20132009 Keynesian resurgence by governments around the world.\nHistorical context.\nPre-Keynesian macroeconomics.\nMacroeconomics is the study of the factors applying to an economy as a whole. Important macroeconomic variables include the overall price level, the interest rate, the level of employment, and income (or equivalently output) measured in real terms.\nThe classical tradition of partial equilibrium theory had been to split the economy into separate markets, each of whose equilibrium conditions could be stated as a single equation determining a single variable. The theoretical apparatus of supply and demand curves developed by Fleeming Jenkin and Alfred Marshall provided a unified mathematical basis for this approach, which the Lausanne School generalized to general equilibrium theory.\nFor macroeconomics, relevant partial theories included the Quantity theory of money determining the price level and the classical theory of the interest rate. In regards to employment, the condition referred to by Keynes as the \"first postulate of classical economics\" stated that the wage is equal to the marginal product, which is a direct application of the marginalist principles developed during the nineteenth century (see \"The General Theory\"). Keynes sought to supplant all three aspects of the classical theory.\nPrecursors of Keynesianism.\nAlthough Keynes's work was crystallized and given impetus by the advent of the Great Depression, it was part of a long-running debate within economics over the existence and nature of general gluts. A number of the policies Keynes advocated to address the Great Depression (notably government deficit spending at times of low private investment or consumption), and many of the theoretical ideas he proposed (effective demand, the multiplier, the paradox of thrift), had been advanced by authors in the 19th and early 20th centuries. (E.g. J. M. Robertson raised the paradox of thrift in 1892.) Keynes's unique contribution was to provide a \"general theory\" of these, which proved acceptable to the economic establishment.\nAn intellectual precursor of Keynesian economics was underconsumption theories associated with John Law, Thomas Malthus, the Birmingham School of Thomas Attwood, and the American economists William Trufant Foster and Waddill Catchings, who were influential in the 1920s and 1930s. Underconsumptionists were, like Keynes after them, concerned with failure of aggregate demand to attain potential output, calling this \"underconsumption\" (focusing on the demand side), rather than \"overproduction\" (which would focus on the supply side), and advocating economic interventionism. Keynes specifically discussed underconsumption (which he wrote \"under-consumption\") in the \"General Theory,\" in http:// and http://.\nNumerous concepts were developed earlier and independently of Keynes by the Stockholm school during the 1930s; these accomplishments were described in a 1937 article, published in response to the 1936 \"General Theory,\" sharing the Swedish discoveries.\nKeynes's early writings.\nIn 1923, Keynes published his first contribution to economic theory, \"A Tract on Monetary Reform\", whose point of view is classical but incorporates ideas that later played a part in the \"General Theory\". In particular, looking at the hyperinflation in European economies, he drew attention to the opportunity cost of holding money (identified with inflation rather than interest) and its influence on the velocity of circulation.\nIn 1930, he published \"A Treatise on Money\", intended as a broad treatment of its subject \"which would confirm his stature as a serious academic scholar, rather than just as the author of stinging polemics\", and marks a large step in the direction of his later views. In it, he attributes unemployment to wage stickiness and treats saving and investment as governed by independent decisions: the former varying positively with the interest rate, the latter negatively. The velocity of circulation is expressed as a function of the rate of interest. He interpreted his treatment of liquidity as implying a purely monetary theory of interest.\nKeynes's younger colleagues of the Cambridge Circus and Ralph Hawtrey believed that his arguments implicitly assumed full employment, and this influenced the direction of his subsequent work. During 1933, he wrote essays on various economic topics \"all of which are cast in terms of movement of output as a whole\".\nDevelopment of \"The General Theory\".\nAt the time that Keynes wrote the General Theory, it had been a tenet of mainstream economic thought that the economy would automatically revert to a state of general equilibrium: it had been assumed that, because the needs of consumers are always greater than the capacity of the producers to satisfy those needs, everything that is produced would eventually be consumed once the appropriate price was found for it. This perception is reflected in Say's law and in the writing of David Ricardo, which states that individuals produce so that they can either consume what they have manufactured or sell their output so that they can buy someone else's output. This argument rests upon the assumption that if a surplus of goods or services exists, they would naturally drop in price to the point where they would be consumed.\nGiven the backdrop of high and persistent unemployment during the Great Depression, Keynes argued that there was no guarantee that the goods that individuals produce would be met with adequate effective demand, and periods of high unemployment could be expected, especially when the economy was contracting in size. He saw the economy as unable to maintain itself at full employment automatically, and believed that it was necessary for the government to step in and put purchasing power into the hands of the working population through government spending. Thus, according to Keynesian theory, some individually rational microeconomic-level actions such as not investing savings in the goods and services produced by the economy, if taken collectively by a large proportion of individuals and firms, can lead to outcomes wherein the economy operates below its potential output and growth rate.\nPrior to Keynes, a situation in which aggregate demand for goods and services did not meet supply was referred to by classical economists as a \"general glut\", although there was disagreement among them as to whether a general glut was possible. Keynes argued that when a glut occurred, it was the over-reaction of producers and the laying off of workers that led to a fall in demand and perpetuated the problem. Keynesians therefore advocate an active stabilization policy to reduce the amplitude of the business cycle, which they rank among the most serious of economic problems. According to the theory, government spending can be used to increase aggregate demand, thus increasing economic activity, reducing unemployment and deflation.\nOrigins of the multiplier.\nThe Liberal Party fought the 1929 General Election on a promise to \"reduce levels of unemployment to normal within one year by utilising the stagnant labour force in vast schemes of national development\". David Lloyd George launched his campaign in March with a policy document, \"We can cure unemployment,\" which tentatively claimed that, \"Public works would lead to a second round of spending as the workers spent their wages.\" Two months later Keynes, then nearing completion of his \"Treatise on money\", and Hubert Henderson collaborated on a political pamphlet seeking to \"provide academically respectable economic arguments\" for Lloyd George's policies. It was titled \"Can Lloyd George do it?\" and endorsed the claim that \"greater trade activity would make for greater trade activity ... with a cumulative effect\". This became the mechanism of the \"ratio\" published by Richard Kahn in his 1931 paper \"The relation of home investment to unemployment\", described by Alvin Hansen as \"one of the great landmarks of economic analysis\". The \"ratio\" was soon rechristened the \"multiplier\" at Keynes's suggestion.\nThe multiplier of Kahn's paper is based on a respending mechanism familiar nowadays from textbooks. Samuelson puts it as follows:\nLet's suppose that I hire unemployed resources to build a $1000 woodshed. My carpenters and lumber producers will get an extra $1000 of income... If they all have a marginal propensity to consume of 2/3, they will now spend $666.67 on new consumption goods. The producers of these goods will now have extra incomes... they in turn will spend $444.44 ... Thus an endless chain of \"secondary consumption respending\" is set in motion by my \"primary\" investment of $1000.\nSamuelson's treatment closely follows Joan Robinson's account of 1937 and is the main channel by which the multiplier has influenced Keynesian theory. It differs significantly from Kahn's paper and even more from Keynes's book.\nThe designation of the initial spending as \"investment\" and the employment-creating respending as \"consumption\" echoes Kahn faithfully, though he gives no reason why initial consumption or subsequent investment respending should not have exactly the same effects. Henry Hazlitt, who considered Keynes as much a culprit as Kahn and Samuelson, wrote that ...\n... in connection with the multiplier (and indeed most of the time) what Keynes is referring to as \"investment\" really means \"any addition to spending for any purpose\"... The word \"investment\" is being used in a Pickwickian, or Keynesian, sense.\nKahn envisaged money as being passed from hand to hand, creating employment at each step, until it came to rest in a \"cul-de-sac\" (Hansen's term was \"leakage\"); the only \"culs-de-sac\" he acknowledged were imports and hoarding, although he also said that a rise in prices might dilute the multiplier effect. Jens Warming recognised that personal saving had to be considered, treating it as a \"leakage\" (p.\u00a0214) while recognising on p.\u00a0217 that it might in fact be invested.\nThe textbook multiplier gives the impression that making society richer is the easiest thing in the world: the government just needs to spend more. In Kahn's paper, it is harder. For him, the initial expenditure must not be a diversion of funds from other uses, but an increase in the total expenditure: something impossible \u2013 if understood in real terms \u2013 under the classical theory that the level of expenditure is limited by the economy's income/output. On page 174, Kahn rejects the claim that the effect of public works is at the expense of expenditure elsewhere, admitting that this might arise if the revenue is raised by taxation, but says that other available means have no such consequences. As an example, he suggests that the money may be raised by borrowing from banks, since ...\n... it is always within the power of the banking system to advance to the Government the cost of the roads without in any way affecting the flow of investment along the normal channels.\nThis assumes that banks are free to create resources to answer any demand. But Kahn adds that ...\n... no such hypothesis is really necessary. For it will be demonstrated later on that, \"pari passu\" with the building of roads, funds are released from various sources at precisely the rate that is required to pay the cost of the roads.\nThe demonstration relies on \"Mr Meade's relation\" (due to James Meade) asserting that the total amount of money that disappears into \"culs-de-sac\" is equal to the original outlay, which in Kahn's words \"should bring relief and consolation to those who are worried about the monetary sources\" (p.\u00a0189).\nA respending multiplier had been proposed earlier by Hawtrey in a 1928 Treasury memorandum (\"with imports as the only leakage\"), but the idea was discarded in his own subsequent writings. Soon afterwards the Australian economist Lyndhurst Giblin published a multiplier analysis in a 1930 lecture (again with imports as the only leakage). The idea itself was much older. Some Dutch mercantilists had believed in an infinite multiplier for military expenditure (assuming no import \"leakage\"), since ...\n... a war could support itself for an unlimited period if only money remained in the country ... For if money itself is \"consumed\", this simply means that it passes into someone else's possession, and this process may continue indefinitely. Multiplier doctrines had subsequently been expressed in more theoretical terms by the Dane Julius Wulff (1896), the Australian Alfred de Lissa (late 1890s), the German/American Nicholas Johannsen (same period), and the Dane Fr. Johannsen (1925/1927). Kahn himself said that the idea was given to him as a child by his father.\nPublic policy debates.\nAs the 1929 election approached \"Keynes was becoming a strong public advocate of capital development\" as a public measure to alleviate unemployment. Winston Churchill, the Conservative Chancellor, took the opposite view:\nIt is the orthodox Treasury dogma, steadfastly held ... [that] very little additional employment and no permanent additional employment can, in fact, be created by State borrowing and State expenditure.\nKeynes pounced on a flaw in the Treasury view. Cross-examining Sir Richard Hopkins, a Second Secretary in the Treasury, before the Macmillan Committee on Finance and Industry in 1930 he referred to the \"first proposition\" that \"schemes of capital development are of no use for reducing unemployment\" and asked whether \"it would be a misunderstanding of the Treasury view to say that they hold to the first proposition\". Hopkins responded that \"The first proposition goes much too far. The first proposition would ascribe to us an absolute and rigid dogma, would it not?\"\nLater the same year, speaking in a newly created Committee of Economists, Keynes tried to use Kahn's emerging multiplier theory to argue for public works, \"but Pigou's and Henderson's objections ensured that there was no sign of this in the final product\". In 1933 he gave wider publicity to his support for Kahn's multiplier in a series of articles titled \"The road to prosperity\" in \"The Times\" newspaper.\nA. C. Pigou was at the time the sole economics professor at Cambridge. He had a continuing interest in the subject of unemployment, having expressed the view in his popular \"Unemployment\" (1913) that it was caused by \"maladjustment between wage-rates and demand\" \u2013 a view Keynes may have shared prior to the years of the \"General Theory\". Nor were his practical recommendations very different: \"on many occasions in the thirties\" Pigou \"gave public support [...] to State action designed to stimulate employment\". Where the two men differed is in the link between theory and practice. Keynes was seeking to build theoretical foundations to support his recommendations for public works while Pigou showed no disposition to move away from classical doctrine. Referring to him and Dennis Robertson, Keynes asked rhetorically: \"Why do they insist on maintaining theories from which their own practical conclusions cannot possibly follow?\"\nThe \"General Theory\".\nKeynes set forward the ideas that became the basis for Keynesian economics in his main work, \"The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money\" (1936). It was written during the Great Depression, when unemployment rose to 25% in the United States and as high as 33% in some countries. It is almost wholly theoretical, enlivened by occasional passages of satire and social commentary. The book had a profound impact on economic thought, and ever since it was published there has been debate over its meaning.\nKeynes and classical economics.\nKeynes begins the \"General Theory\" with a summary of the classical theory of employment, which he encapsulates in his formulation of Say's Law as the dictum \"Supply creates its own demand\".\nHe also wrote that although his theory was explained in terms of an Anglo-Saxon \"laissez faire\" economy, his theory was also more general in the sense that it would be easier to adapt to \"totalitarian states\" than a free market policy would.\nUnder the classical theory, the wage rate is determined by the marginal productivity of labour, and as many people are employed as are willing to work at that rate. Unemployment may arise through friction or may be \"voluntary\", in the sense that it arises from a refusal to accept employment owing to \"legislation or social practices ... or mere human obstinacy\", but \"...the classical postulates do not admit of the possibility of the third category,\" which Keynes defines as \"involuntary unemployment\".\nKeynes raises two objections to the classical theory's assumption that \"wage bargains ... determine the real wage\". The first lies in the fact that \"labour stipulates (within limits) for a money-wage rather than a real wage\". The second is that classical theory assumes that, \"The real wages of labour depend on the wage bargains which labour makes with the entrepreneurs,\" whereas, \"If money wages change, one would have expected the classical school to argue that prices would change in almost the same proportion, leaving the real wage and the level of unemployment practically the same as before.\" Keynes considers his second objection the more fundamental, but most commentators concentrate on his first one: it has been argued that the quantity theory of money protects the classical school from the conclusion Keynes expected from it.\nKeynesian unemployment.\nSaving and investment.\nSaving is that part of income not devoted to consumption, and consumption is that part of expenditure not allocated to investment, i.e., to durable goods. Hence saving encompasses hoarding (the accumulation of income as cash) and the purchase of durable goods. The existence of net hoarding, or of a demand to hoard, is not admitted by the simplified liquidity preference model of the \"General Theory\".\nOnce he rejects the classical theory that unemployment is due to excessive wages, Keynes proposes an alternative based on the relationship between saving and investment. In his view, unemployment arises whenever entrepreneurs' incentive to invest fails to keep pace with society's propensity to save (\"propensity\" is one of Keynes's synonyms for \"demand\"). The levels of saving and investment are necessarily equal, and income is therefore held down to a level where the desire to save is no greater than the incentive to invest.\nThe incentive to invest arises from the interplay between the physical circumstances of production and psychological anticipations of future profitability; but once these things are given the incentive is independent of income and depends solely on the rate of interest \"r\". Keynes designates its value as a function of \"r\" as the \"schedule of the marginal efficiency of capital\".\nThe propensity to save behaves quite differently. Saving is simply that part of income not devoted to consumption, and:\n... the prevailing psychological law seems to be that when aggregate income increases, consumption expenditure will also increase but to a somewhat lesser extent.\nKeynes adds that \"this psychological law was of the utmost importance in the development of my own thought\".\nLiquidity preference.\nKeynes viewed the money supply as one of the main determinants of the state of the real economy. The significance he attributed to it is one of the innovative features of his work, and was influential on the politically hostile monetarist school.\nMoney supply comes into play through the \"liquidity preference\" function, which is the demand function that corresponds to money supply. It specifies the amount of money people will seek to hold according to the state of the economy. In Keynes's first (and simplest) account \u2013 that of Chapter 13 \u2013 liquidity preference is determined solely by the interest rates \"r\"\u2014which is seen as the earnings forgone by holding wealth in liquid form: hence liquidity preference can be written \"L\"(\"r\" ) and in equilibrium must equal the externally fixed money supply \"M\u0302\".\nKeynes's economic model.\nMoney supply, saving and investment combine to determine the level of income as illustrated in the diagram, where the top graph shows money supply (on the vertical axis) against interest rate. \"M\u0302\" determines the ruling interest rate \"r\u0302\" through the liquidity preference function. The rate of interest determines the level of investment \"\u00ce t\"hrough the schedule of the marginal efficiency of capital, shown as a blue curve in the lower graph. The red curves in the same diagram show what the propensities to save are for different incomes \"Y\"\u202f; and the income \"\u0176\" corresponding to the equilibrium state of the economy must be the one for which the implied level of saving at the established interest rate is equal to \"\u00ce\".\nIn Keynes's more complicated liquidity preference theory (presented in Chapter 15) the demand for money depends on income as well as on the interest rate and the analysis becomes more complicated. Keynes never fully integrated his second liquidity preference doctrine with the rest of his theory, leaving that to John Hicks: see the IS-LM model below.\nWage rigidity.\nKeynes rejects the classical explanation of unemployment based on wage rigidity, but it is not clear what effect the wage rate has on unemployment in his system. He treats wages of all workers as proportional to a single rate set by collective bargaining, and chooses his units so that this rate never appears separately in his discussion. It is present implicitly in those quantities he expresses in wage units, while being absent from those he expresses in money terms. It is therefore difficult to see whether, and in what way, his results differ for a different wage rate, nor is it clear what he thought about the matter.\nRemedies for unemployment.\nMonetary remedies.\nAn increase in the money supply, according to Keynes's theory, leads to a drop in the interest rate and an increase in the amount of investment that can be undertaken profitably, bringing with it an increase in total income.\nFiscal remedies.\nKeynes' name is associated with fiscal, rather than monetary, measures but they receive only passing (and often satirical) reference in the \"General Theory\". He mentions \"increased public works\" as an example of something that brings employment through the \"multiplier\", but this is before he develops the relevant theory, and he does not follow up when he gets to the theory.\nLater in the same chapter he tells us that:\nAncient Egypt was doubly fortunate, and doubtless owed to this its fabled wealth, in that it possessed two activities, namely, pyramid-building as well as the search for the precious metals, the fruits of which, since they could not serve the needs of man by being consumed, did not stale with abundance. The Middle Ages built cathedrals and sang dirges. Two pyramids, two masses for the dead, are twice as good as one; but not so two railways from London to York.\nBut again, he does not get back to his implied recommendation to engage in public works, even if not fully justified from their direct benefits, when he constructs the theory. On the contrary he later advises us that ...\n... our final task might be to select those variables which can be deliberately controlled or managed by central authority in the kind of system in which we actually live ...\nand this appears to look forward to a future publication rather than to a subsequent chapter of the \"General Theory\".\nKeynesian models and concepts.\nAggregate demand.\nKeynes' view of saving and investment was his most important departure from the classical outlook. It can be illustrated using the \"Keynesian cross\" devised by Paul Samuelson. The horizontal axis denotes total income and the purple curve shows \"C\"\u202f(\"Y\"\u202f), the propensity to consume, whose complement \"S\"\u202f(\"Y\"\u202f) is the propensity to save: the sum of these two functions is equal to total income, which is shown by the broken line at 45\u00b0.\nThe horizontal blue line \"I\"\u202f(\"r\"\u202f) is the schedule of the marginal efficiency of capital whose value is independent of \"Y\". The schedule of the marginal efficiency of capital is dependent on the interest rate, specifically the interest rate cost of a new investment. If the interest rate charged by the financial sector to the productive sector is below the marginal efficiency of capital at that level of technology and capital intensity then investment is positive and grows the lower the interest rate is, given the diminishing return of capital. If the interest rate is above the marginal efficiency of capital then investment is equal to zero. Keynes interprets this as the demand for investment and denotes the sum of demands for consumption and investment as \"aggregate demand\", plotted as a separate curve. Aggregate demand must equal total income, so equilibrium income must be determined by the point where the aggregate demand curve crosses the 45\u00b0 line. This is the same horizontal position as the intersection of \"I\"\u202f(\"r\"\u202f) with \"S\"\u202f(\"Y\"\u202f).\nThe equation \"I\"\u202f(\"r\"\u202f)\u00a0=\u00a0\"S\"\u202f(\"Y\"\u202f) had been accepted by the classics, who had viewed it as the condition of equilibrium between supply and demand for investment funds and as determining the interest rate (see the classical theory of interest). But insofar as they had had a concept of aggregate demand, they had seen the demand for investment as being given by \"S\"\u202f(\"Y\"\u202f), since for them saving was simply the indirect purchase of capital goods, with the result that aggregate demand was equal to total income as an identity rather than as an equilibrium condition. Keynes takes note of this view in Chapter 2, where he finds it present in the early writings of Alfred Marshall but adds that \"the doctrine is never stated to-day in this crude form\".\nThe equation \"I\"\u202f(\"r\"\u202f)\u00a0=\u00a0\"S\"\u202f(\"Y\"\u202f) is accepted by Keynes for some or all of the following reasons:\nThe Keynesian multiplier.\nKeynes introduces his discussion of the multiplier in Chapter 10 with a reference to Kahn's earlier paper (see below). He designates Kahn's multiplier the \"employment multiplier\" in distinction to his own \"investment multiplier\" and says that the two are only \"a little different\". Kahn's multiplier has consequently been understood by much of the Keynesian literature as playing a major role in Keynes's own theory, an interpretation encouraged by the difficulty of understanding Keynes's presentation. Kahn's multiplier gives the title (\"The multiplier model\") to the account of Keynesian theory in Samuelson's \"Economics\" and is almost as prominent in Alvin Hansen's \"Guide to Keynes\" and in Joan Robinson's \"Introduction to the Theory of Employment\".\nKeynes states that there is ...\n... a confusion between the logical theory of the multiplier, which holds good continuously, without time-lag ... and the consequence of an expansion in the capital goods industries which take gradual effect, subject to a time-lag, and only after an interval ...\nand implies that he is adopting the former theory. And when the multiplier eventually emerges as a component of Keynes's theory (in Chapter\u00a018) it turns out to be simply a measure of the change of one variable in response to a change in another. The schedule of the marginal efficiency of capital is identified as one of the independent variables of the economic system: \"What [it] tells us, is ... the point to which the output of new investment will be pushed ...\" The multiplier then gives \"the ratio ... between an increment of investment and the corresponding increment of aggregate income\".\nG. L. S. Shackle regarded Keynes' move away from Kahn's multiplier as ...\n... a retrograde step ... For when we look upon the Multiplier as an instantaneous functional relation ... we are merely using the word Multiplier to stand for an alternative way of looking at the marginal propensity to consume ...,\nwhich G. M. Ambrosi cites as an instance of \"a Keynesian commentator who would have liked Keynes to have written something less 'retrograde'\".\nThe value Keynes assigns to his multiplier is the reciprocal of the marginal propensity to save: \"k\"\u202f\u00a0=\u00a01\u202f/\u202f\"S\"\u202f'(\"Y\"\u202f). This is the same as the formula for Kahn's multiplier in a closed economy assuming that all saving (including the purchase of durable goods), and not just hoarding, constitutes leakage. Keynes gave his formula almost the status of a definition (it is put forward in advance of any explanation). His multiplier is indeed the value of \"the ratio ... between an increment of investment and the corresponding increment of aggregate income\" as Keynes derived it from his Chapter\u00a013 model of liquidity preference, which implies that income must bear the entire effect of a change in investment. But under his Chapter\u00a015 model a change in the schedule of the marginal efficiency of capital has an effect shared between the interest rate and income in proportions depending on the partial derivatives of the liquidity preference function. Keynes did not investigate the question of whether his formula for multiplier needed revision.\nThe liquidity trap.\nThe liquidity trap is a phenomenon that may impede the effectiveness of monetary policies in reducing unemployment.\nEconomists generally think the rate of interest will not fall below a certain limit, often seen as zero or a slightly negative number. Keynes suggested that the limit might be appreciably greater than zero but did not attach much practical significance to it. The term \"liquidity trap\" was coined by Dennis Robertson in his comments on the \"General Theory\", but it was John Hicks in \"Mr. Keynes and the Classics\" who recognised the significance of a slightly different concept.\nIf the economy is in a position such that the liquidity preference curve is almost vertical, as must happen as the lower limit on \"r\" is approached, then a change in the money supply \"M\u0302\" makes almost no difference to the equilibrium rate of interest \"r\u0302\" or, unless there is compensating steepness in the other curves, to the resulting income \"\u0176\". As Hicks put it, \"Monetary means will not force down the rate of interest any further.\"\nPaul Krugman has worked extensively on the liquidity trap, claiming that it was the problem confronting the Japanese economy around the turn of the millennium. In his later words:\nShort-term interest rates were close to zero, long-term rates were at historical lows, yet private investment spending remained insufficient to bring the economy out of deflation. In that environment, monetary policy was just as ineffective as Keynes described. Attempts by the Bank of Japan to increase the money supply simply added to already ample bank reserves and public holdings of cash...\nThe IS\u2013LM model.\nHicks showed how to analyse Keynes' system when liquidity preference is a function of income as well as of the rate of interest. Keynes's admission of income as an influence on the demand for money is a step back in the direction of classical theory, and Hicks takes a further step in the same direction by generalizing the propensity to save to take both \"Y\" and \"r\" as arguments. Less classically he extends this generalization to the schedule of the marginal efficiency of capital.\nThe IS-LM model uses two equations to express Keynes' model. The first, now written \"I\" (\"Y\", \"r\" )\u202f=\u202f\"S\" (\"Y\",\"r\" ), expresses the principle of effective demand. We may construct a graph on (\"Y\", \"r\" ) coordinates and draw a line connecting those points satisfying the equation: this is the \"IS\" curve. In the same way we can write the equation of equilibrium between liquidity preference and the money supply as \"L\"(\"Y\"\u202f,\"r\"\u202f)\u202f=\u202f\"M\u0302\" and draw a second curve \u2013 the \"LM\" curve \u2013 connecting points that satisfy it. The equilibrium values \"\u0176\" of total income and \"r\u0302\" of interest rate are then given by the point of intersection of the two curves.\nIf we follow Keynes's initial account under which liquidity preference depends only on the interest rate \"r\", then the \"LM\" curve is horizontal.\nJoan Robinson commented that:\n... modern teaching has been confused by J. R. Hicks' attempt to reduce the \"General Theory\" to a version of static equilibrium with the formula IS\u2013LM. Hicks has now repented and changed his name from J. R. to John, but it will take a long time for the effects of his teaching to wear off.\nHicks subsequently relapsed.\nKeynesian economic policies.\nActive fiscal policy.\nKeynes argued that the solution to the Great Depression was to stimulate the country (\"incentive to invest\") through some combination of two approaches:\nIf the interest rate at which businesses and consumers can borrow decreases, investments that were previously uneconomic become profitable, and large consumer sales normally financed through debt (such as houses, automobiles, and, historically, even appliances like refrigerators) become more affordable. A principal function of central banks in countries that have them is to influence this interest rate through a variety of mechanisms collectively called \"monetary policy\". This is how monetary policy that reduces interest rates is thought to stimulate economic activity, i.e., \"grow the economy\"\u2014and why it is called \"expansionary\" monetary policy.\nExpansionary fiscal policy consists of increasing net public spending, which the government can effect by a) taxing less, b) spending more, or c) both. Investment and consumption by government raises demand for businesses' products and for employment, reversing the effects of the aforementioned imbalance. If desired spending exceeds revenue, the government finances the difference by borrowing from capital markets by issuing government bonds. This is called deficit spending. Two points are important to note at this point. First, deficits are not required for expansionary fiscal policy, and second, it is only \"change\" in net spending that can stimulate or depress the economy. For example, if a government ran a deficit of 10% both last year and this year, this would represent neutral fiscal policy. In fact, if it ran a deficit of 10% last year and 5% this year, this would actually be contractionary. On the other hand, if the government ran a surplus of 10% of GDP last year and 5% this year, that would be expansionary fiscal policy, despite never running a deficit at all.\nContrary to some critical characterizations of it, Keynesianism does not consist solely of deficit spending, since it recommends adjusting fiscal policies according to cyclical circumstances. An example of a counter-cyclical policy is raising taxes to cool the economy and to prevent inflation when there is abundant demand-side growth, and engaging in deficit spending on labour-intensive infrastructure projects to stimulate employment and stabilize wages during economic downturns.\nKeynes's ideas influenced US President Franklin D. Roosevelt's view that insufficient buying-power caused the Depression. During his presidency, Roosevelt adopted some aspects of Keynesian economics, especially after 1937, when, in the depths of the Depression, the United States suffered from recession yet again following fiscal contraction. But to many the true success of Keynesian policy can be seen at the onset of World War II, which provided a kick to the world economy, removed uncertainty, and forced the rebuilding of destroyed capital. Keynesian ideas became almost official in social-democratic Europe after the war and in the U.S. in the 1960s.\nThe Keynesian advocacy of deficit spending contrasted with the classical and neoclassical economic analysis of fiscal policy. They admitted that fiscal stimulus could actuate production. But, to these schools, there was no reason to believe that this stimulation would outrun the side-effects that \"crowd out\" private investment: first, it would increase the demand for labour and raise wages, hurting profitability; Second, a government deficit increases the stock of government bonds, reducing their market price and encouraging high interest rates, making it more expensive for business to finance fixed investment. Thus, efforts to stimulate the economy would be self-defeating.\nThe Keynesian response is that such fiscal policy is appropriate only when unemployment is persistently high, above the non-accelerating inflation rate of unemployment (NAIRU). In that case, crowding out is minimal. Further, private investment can be \"crowded in\": Fiscal stimulus raises the market for business output, raising cash flow and profitability, spurring business optimism. To Keynes, this accelerator effect meant that government and business could be \"complements\" rather than substitutes in this situation.\nSecond, as the stimulus occurs, gross domestic product rises\u2014raising the amount of saving, helping to finance the increase in fixed investment. Finally, government outlays need not always be wasteful: government investment in public goods that is not provided by profit-seekers encourages the private sector's growth. That is, government spending on such things as basic research, public health, education, and infrastructure could help the long-term growth of \"potential output\".\nIn Keynes's theory, there must be significant slack in the labour market before fiscal expansion is justified.\nKeynesian economists believe that adding to profits and incomes during boom cycles through tax cuts, and removing income and profits from the economy through cuts in spending during downturns, tends to exacerbate the negative effects of the business cycle. This effect is especially pronounced when the government controls a large fraction of the economy, as increased tax revenue may aid investment in state enterprises in downturns, and decreased state revenue and investment harm those enterprises.\nViews on trade imbalance.\nIn the last few years of his life, Keynes was much preoccupied with the question of balance in international trade. He was the leader of the British delegation to the United Nations Monetary and Financial Conference in 1944 that established the Bretton Woods system of international currency management.\nHe was the principal author of a proposal \u2013 the so-called Keynes Plan \u2013 for an International Clearing Union. The two governing principles of the plan were that the problem of settling outstanding balances should be solved by 'creating' additional 'international money', and that debtor and creditor should be treated almost alike as disturbers of equilibrium. In the event, though, the plans were rejected, in part because \"American opinion was naturally reluctant to accept the principle of equality of treatment so novel in debtor-creditor relationships\".\nThe new system is not founded on free trade (liberalization of foreign trade) but rather on regulating international trade to eliminate trade imbalances. Nations with a surplus would have a powerful incentive to get rid of it, which would automatically clear other nations' deficits. Keynes proposed a global bank that would issue its own currency\u2014the \"bancor\"\u2014which was exchangeable with national currencies at fixed rates of exchange and would become the unit of account between nations, which means it would be used to measure a country's trade deficit or trade surplus. Every country would have an overdraft facility in its bancor account at the International Clearing Union. He pointed out that surpluses lead to weak global aggregate demand \u2013 countries running surpluses exert a \"negative externality\" on trading partners, and posed far more than those in deficit, a threat to global prosperity. Keynes thought that surplus countries should be taxed to avoid trade imbalances.\nIn \"\"National Self-Sufficiency\" The Yale Review, Vol. 22, no. 4 (June 1933)\", he already highlighted the problems created by free trade.\nHis view, supported by many economists and commentators at the time, was that creditor nations may be just as responsible as debtor nations for disequilibrium in exchanges and that both should be under an obligation to bring trade back into a state of balance. Failure for them to do so could have serious consequences. In the words of Geoffrey Crowther, then editor of \"The Economist\", \"If the economic relationships between nations are not, by one means or another, brought fairly close to balance, then there is no set of financial arrangements that can rescue the world from the impoverishing results of chaos.\"\nThese ideas were informed by events prior to the Great Depression when \u2013 in the opinion of Keynes and others \u2013 international lending, primarily by the U.S., exceeded the capacity of sound investment and so got diverted into non-productive and speculative uses, which in turn invited default and a sudden stop to the process of lending.\nInfluenced by Keynes, economic texts in the immediate post-war period put a significant emphasis on balance in trade. For example, the second edition of the popular introductory textbook, \"An Outline of Money\", devoted the last three of its ten chapters to questions of foreign exchange management and in particular the 'problem of balance'. However, in more recent years, since the end of the Bretton Woods system in 1971, with the increasing influence of Monetarist schools of thought in the 1980s, and particularly in the face of large sustained trade imbalances, these concerns \u2013 and particularly concerns about the destabilizing effects of large trade surpluses \u2013 have largely disappeared from mainstream economics discourse and Keynes' insights have slipped from view. They received attention again during the 2008 financial crisis.\nViews on free trade and protectionism.\nThe turning point of the Great Depression.\nAt the beginning of his career, Keynes was an economist close to Alfred Marshall, deeply convinced of the benefits of free trade. From the crisis of 1929 onwards, noting the commitment of the British authorities to defend the gold parity of the pound sterling and the rigidity of nominal wages, he gradually adhered to protectionist measures.\nOn 5 November 1929, when heard by the Macmillan Committee to bring the British economy out of the crisis, Keynes indicated that the introduction of tariffs on imports would help to rebalance the trade balance. The committee's report states in a section entitled \"import control and export aid\", that in an economy where there is not full employment, the introduction of tariffs can improve production and employment. Thus the reduction of the trade deficit favours the country's growth.\nIn January 1930, in the Economic Advisory Council, Keynes proposed the introduction of a system of protection to reduce imports. In the autumn of 1930, he proposed a uniform tariff of 10% on all imports and subsidies of the same rate for all exports. In the \"Treatise on Money\", published in the autumn of 1930, he took up the idea of tariffs or other trade restrictions with the aim of reducing the volume of imports and rebalancing the balance of trade.\nOn 7 March 1931, in the \"New Statesman and Nation\", he wrote an article entitled \"Proposal for a Tariff Revenue\". He pointed out that the reduction of wages led to a reduction in national demand which constrained markets. Instead, he proposes the idea of an expansionary policy combined with a tariff system to neutralize the effects on the balance of trade. The application of customs tariffs seemed to him \"unavoidable, whoever the Chancellor of the Exchequer might be\". Thus, for Keynes, an economic recovery policy is only fully effective if the trade deficit is eliminated. He proposed a 15% tax on manufactured and semi-manufactured goods and 5% on certain foodstuffs and raw materials, with others needed for exports exempted (wool, cotton).\nIn 1932, in an article entitled \"The Pro- and Anti-Tariffs\", published in \"The Listener\", he envisaged the protection of farmers and certain sectors such as the automobile and iron and steel industries, considering them indispensable to Britain.\nThe critique of the theory of comparative advantage.\nIn the post-crisis situation of 1929, Keynes judged the assumptions of the free trade model unrealistic. He criticized, for example, the neoclassical assumption of wage adjustment.\nAs early as 1930, in a note to the Economic Advisory Council, he doubted the intensity of the gain from specialization in the case of manufactured goods. While participating in the MacMillan Committee, he admitted that he no longer \"believed in a very high degree of national specialisation\" and refused to \"abandon any industry which is unable, for the moment, to survive\". He also criticized the static dimension of the theory of comparative advantage, which, in his view, by fixing comparative advantages definitively, led in practice to a waste of national resources.\nIn the Daily Mail of 13 March 1931, he called the assumption of perfect sectoral labour mobility \"nonsense\" since it states that a person made unemployed contributes to a reduction in the wage rate until he finds a job. But for Keynes, this change of job may involve costs (job search, training) and is not always possible. Generally speaking, for Keynes, the assumptions of full employment and automatic return to equilibrium discredit the theory of comparative advantage.\nIn July 1933, he published an article in the \"New Statesman and Nation\" entitled \"National Self-Sufficiency\", in which he criticized the argument of the specialization of economies, which is the basis of free trade. He thus proposed the search for a certain degree of self-sufficiency. Instead of the specialization of economies advocated by the Ricardian theory of comparative advantage, he prefers the maintenance of a diversity of activities for nations. In it he refutes the principle of peacemaking trade. His vision of trade became that of a system where foreign capitalists compete for new markets. He defends the idea of producing on national soil when possible and reasonable and expresses sympathy for the advocates of protectionism. \nHe notes in \"National Self-Sufficiency\":\nHe also writes in \"National Self-Sufficiency\":{\nLater, Keynes had a written correspondence with James Meade centred on the issue of import restrictions. Keynes and Meade discussed the best choice between quota and tariff. In March 1944 Keynes began a discussion with Marcus Fleming after the latter had written an article entitled \"Quotas versus depreciation\". On this occasion, we see that he has definitely taken a protectionist stance after the Great Depression. He considered that quotas could be more effective than currency depreciation in dealing with external imbalances. Thus, for Keynes, currency depreciation was no longer sufficient, and protectionist measures became necessary to avoid trade deficits. To avoid the return of crises due to a self-regulating economic system, it seemed essential to him to regulate trade and stop free trade (deregulation of foreign trade).\nHe points out that countries that import more than they export weaken their economies. When the trade deficit increases, unemployment rises and GDP slows down. And surplus countries exert a \"negative externality\" on their trading partners. They get richer at the expense of others and destroy the output of their trading partners. John Maynard Keynes believed that the products of surplus countries should be taxed to avoid trade imbalances. Thus he no longer believes in the theory of comparative advantage\u00a0(on which free trade is based) which states that the trade deficit does not matter, since trade is mutually beneficial.\nThis also explains his desire to replace the liberalization of international trade (Free Trade) with a regulatory system aimed at eliminating trade imbalances in his proposals for the Bretton Woods Agreement.\nPostwar Keynesianism.\nKeynes's ideas became widely accepted after World War II, and until the early 1970s, Keynesian economics provided the main inspiration for economic policy makers in Western industrialized countries. Governments prepared high quality economic statistics on an ongoing basis and tried to base their policies on the Keynesian theory that had become the norm. In the early era of social liberalism and social democracy, most western capitalist countries enjoyed low, stable unemployment and modest inflation, an era called the Golden Age of Capitalism.\nIn terms of policy, the twin tools of post-war Keynesian economics were fiscal policy and monetary policy. While these are credited to Keynes, others, such as economic historian David Colander, argue that they are, rather, due to the interpretation of Keynes by Abba Lerner in his theory of functional finance, and should instead be called \"Lernerian\" rather than \"Keynesian\".\nThrough the 1950s, moderate degrees of government demand leading industrial development, and use of fiscal and monetary counter-cyclical policies continued, and reached a peak in the \"go go\" 1960s, where it seemed to many Keynesians that prosperity was now permanent. In 1971, Republican US President Richard Nixon even proclaimed \"I am now a Keynesian in economics.\"\nBeginning in the late 1960s, a new classical macroeconomics movement arose, critical of Keynesian assumptions (see sticky prices), and seemed, especially in the 1970s, to explain certain phenomena better. It was characterized by explicit and rigorous adherence to microfoundations, as well as use of increasingly sophisticated mathematical modelling.\nWith the oil shock of 1973, and the economic problems of the 1970s, Keynesian economics began to fall out of favour. During this time, many economies experienced high and rising unemployment, coupled with high and rising inflation, contradicting the Phillips curve's prediction. This stagflation meant that the simultaneous application of expansionary (anti-recession) and contractionary (anti-inflation) policies appeared necessary. This dilemma led to the end of the Keynesian near-consensus of the 1960s, and the rise throughout the 1970s of ideas based upon more classical analysis, including monetarism, supply-side economics, and new classical economics.\nHowever, by the late 1980s, certain failures of the new classical models, both theoretical (see Real business cycle theory) and empirical (see the \"Volcker recession\") hastened the emergence of New Keynesian economics, a school that sought to unite the most realistic aspects of Keynesian and neo-classical assumptions and place them on more rigorous theoretical foundation than ever before.\nOne line of thinking, utilized also as a critique of the notably high unemployment and potentially disappointing GNP growth rates associated with the new classical models by the mid-1980s, was to emphasize low unemployment and maximal economic growth at the cost of somewhat higher inflation (its consequences kept in check by indexing and other methods, and its overall rate kept lower and steadier by such potential policies as Martin Weitzman's share economy).\nSchools.\nMultiple schools of economic thought that trace their legacy to Keynes currently exist, the notable ones being neo-Keynesian economics, New Keynesian economics, post-Keynesian economics, and the new neoclassical synthesis. Keynes's biographer Robert Skidelsky writes that the post-Keynesian school has remained closest to the spirit of Keynes's work in following his monetary theory and rejecting the neutrality of money. Today these ideas, regardless of provenance, are referred to in academia under the rubric of \"Keynesian economics\", due to Keynes's role in consolidating, elaborating, and popularizing them.\nIn the postwar era, Keynesian analysis was combined with neoclassical economics to produce what is generally termed the \"neoclassical synthesis\", yielding neo-Keynesian economics, which dominated mainstream macroeconomic thought. Though it was widely held that there was no strong automatic tendency to full employment, many believed that if government policy were used to ensure it, the economy would behave as neoclassical theory predicted. This post-war domination by neo-Keynesian economics was broken during the stagflation of the 1970s. There was a lack of consensus among macroeconomists in the 1980s, and during this period New Keynesian economics was developed, ultimately becoming- along with new classical macroeconomics- a part of the current consensus, known as the new neoclassical synthesis.\nPost-Keynesian economists, on the other hand, reject the neoclassical synthesis and, in general, neoclassical economics applied to the macroeconomy. Post-Keynesian economics is a heterodox school that holds that both neo-Keynesian economics and New Keynesian economics are incorrect, and a misinterpretation of Keynes's ideas. The post-Keynesian school encompasses a variety of perspectives, but has been far less influential than the other more mainstream Keynesian schools.\nInterpretations of Keynes have emphasized his stress on the international coordination of Keynesian policies, the need for international economic institutions, and the ways in which economic forces could lead to war or could promote peace.\nKeynesianism and liberalism.\nIn a 2014 paper, economist Alan Blinder argues that, \"for not very good reasons\", public opinion in the United States has associated Keynesianism with liberalism, and he states that such is incorrect. For example, both Presidents Ronald Reagan (1981\u201389) and George W. Bush (2001\u201309) supported policies that were, in fact, Keynesian, even though both men were conservative leaders. And tax cuts can provide highly helpful fiscal stimulus during a recession, just as much as infrastructure spending can. Blinder concludes: \"If you are not teaching your students that 'Keynesianism' is neither conservative nor liberal, you should be.\"\nOther schools of economic thought.\nThe Keynesian schools of economics are situated alongside a number of other schools that have the same perspectives on what the economic issues are, but differ on what causes them and how best to resolve them. Today, most of these schools of thought have been subsumed into modern macroeconomic theory.\nStockholm School.\nThe Stockholm school rose to prominence at about the same time that Keynes published his General Theory and shared a common concern in business cycles and unemployment. The second generation of Swedish economists also advocated government intervention through spending during economic downturns although opinions are divided over whether they conceived the essence of Keynes's theory before he did.\nMonetarism.\nThere was debate between monetarists and Keynesians in the 1960s over the role of government in stabilizing the economy. Both monetarists and Keynesians agree that issues such as business cycles, unemployment, and deflation are caused by inadequate demand. However, they had fundamentally different perspectives on the capacity of the economy to find its own equilibrium, and the degree of government intervention that would be appropriate. Keynesians emphasized the use of discretionary fiscal policy and monetary policy, while monetarists argued the primacy of monetary policy, and that it should be rules-based.\nThe debate was largely resolved in the 1980s. Since then, economists have largely agreed that central banks should bear the primary responsibility for stabilizing the economy, and that monetary policy should largely follow the Taylor rule \u2013 which many economists credit with the Great Moderation. The 2008 financial crisis, however, has convinced many economists and governments of the need for fiscal interventions and highlighted the difficulty in stimulating economies through monetary policy alone during a liquidity trap.\nMarxism and Public choice.\nSome Marxist economists criticized Keynesian economics. For example, in his 1946 appraisal Paul Sweezy\u2014while admitting that there was much in the \"General Theory\"'s analysis of effective demand that Marxists could draw on\u2014described Keynes as a prisoner of his neoclassical upbringing. Sweezy argued that Keynes had never been able to view the capitalist system as a totality. He argued that Keynes regarded the class struggle carelessly, and overlooked the class role of the capitalist state, which he treated as a \"deus ex machina\", and some other points. While Micha\u0142 Kalecki was generally enthusiastic about the Keynesian Revolution, he predicted that it would not endure, in his article \"Political Aspects of Full Employment\". In the article Kalecki predicted that the full employment delivered by Keynesian policy would eventually lead to a more assertive working class and weakening of the social position of business leaders, causing the elite to use their political power to force the displacement of the Keynesian policy even though profits would be higher than under a laissez faire system: The elites would not care about risking the higher profits in the pursuit of reclaiming prestige in the society and the political power.\nJames M. Buchanan criticized Keynesian economics on the grounds that governments would in practice be unlikely to implement theoretically optimal policies. The implicit assumption underlying the Keynesian fiscal revolution, according to Buchanan, was that economic policy would be made by wise men, acting without regard to political pressures or opportunities, and guided by disinterested economic technocrats. He argued that this was an unrealistic assumption about political, bureaucratic and electoral behaviour. Buchanan blamed Keynesian economics for what he considered a decline in America's fiscal discipline. Buchanan argued that deficit spending would evolve into a permanent disconnect between spending and revenue, precisely because it brings short-term gains, so, ending up institutionalizing irresponsibility in the federal government, the largest and most central institution in our society.\nMartin Feldstein argues that the legacy of Keynesian economics\u2013the misdiagnosis of unemployment, the fear of saving, and the unjustified government intervention\u2013affected the fundamental ideas of policy makers.\nMilton Friedman thought that Keynes's political bequest was harmful for two reasons. First, he thought whatever the economic analysis, benevolent dictatorship is likely sooner or later to lead to a totalitarian society. Second, he thought Keynes's economic theories appealed to a group far broader than economists primarily because of their link to his political approach.\nAlex Tabarrok argues that Keynesian politics\u2013as distinct from Keynesian policies\u2013has failed pretty much whenever it's been tried, at least in liberal democracies.\nIn response to this argument, John Quiggin, wrote about these theories' implication for a liberal democratic order. He thought that if it is generally accepted that democratic politics is nothing more than a battleground for competing interest groups, then reality will come to resemble the model.\nPaul Krugman wrote \"I don't think we need to take that as an immutable fact of life; but still, what are the alternatives?\"\nDaniel Kuehn, criticized James M. Buchanan. He argued, \"if you have a problem with politicians \u2013 criticize politicians,\" not Keynes. He also argued that empirical evidence makes it pretty clear that Buchanan was wrong.\nJames Tobin argued, if advising government officials, politicians, voters, it's not for economists to play games with them.\nKeynes implicitly rejected this argument, in \"soon or late it is ideas not vested interests which are dangerous for good or evil.\"\nBrad DeLong has argued that politics is the main motivator behind objections to the view that government should try to serve a stabilizing macroeconomic role. Paul Krugman argued that a regime that by and large lets markets work, but in which the government is ready both to rein in excesses and fight slumps is inherently unstable, due to intellectual instability, political instability, and financial instability.\nNew classical.\nAnother influential school of thought was based on the Lucas critique of Keynesian economics. This called for greater consistency with microeconomic theory based on rational choice theory, and in particular emphasized the idea of rational expectations. Lucas and others argued that Keynesian economics required remarkably foolish and short-sighted behaviour from people, which totally contradicted the economic understanding of their behaviour at a micro level. New classical economics introduced a set of macroeconomic theories that were based on optimizing microeconomic behaviour. These models have been developed into the real business-cycle theory, which argues that business cycle fluctuations can to a large extent be accounted for by real (in contrast to nominal) shocks.\nBeginning in the late 1950s new classical macroeconomists began to disagree with the methodology employed by Keynes and his successors. Keynesians emphasized the dependence of consumption on disposable income and, also, of investment on current profits and current cash flow. In addition, Keynesians posited a Phillips curve that tied nominal wage inflation to unemployment rate. To support these theories, Keynesians typically traced the logical foundations of their model (using introspection) and supported their assumptions with statistical evidence. New classical theorists demanded that macroeconomics be grounded on the same foundations as microeconomic theory, profit-maximizing firms and rational, utility-maximizing consumers.\nThe result of this shift in methodology produced several important divergences from Keynesian macroeconomics:\nAustrian school.\nF.A. Hayek, an Austrian-style economist described Keynesianism as a system of \"economics of abundance\" stating it is, \"a system of economics which is based on the assumption that no real scarcity exists, and that the only scarcity with which we need concern ourselves is the artificial scarcity created by the determination of people not to sell their services and products below certain arbitrarily fixed prices.\" Ludwig von Mises, another Austrian economist, describes a Keynesian system as believing it can solve most problems with \"more money and credit\" which leads to a system of \"inflationism\" in which \"prices (of goods) rise higher and higher.\" Murray Rothbard wrote that Keynesian-style governmental regulation of money and credit created a \"dismal monetary and banking situation,\" since it allows for the central bankers that have the exclusive ability to print money to be \"unchecked and out of control.\" Rothbard went on to say in an interview that, \"There is one good thing about (Karl) Marx: he was not a Keynesian.\"\nOthers.\nThe social historian C. J. Coventry argues in \"Keynes from Below: A Social History of Second World War Keynesian Economics\" (2023) that Keynes and Keynesian economics was unpopular in the United Kingdom and Australia in the 1940s. Many workers and trades unions, as well as figures in the British Labour Party and Australian Labor Party, saw Keynesianism as a means of stopping socialism. Keynes was largely supported by business leaders, bankers and conservative parties, or tripartite third way Catholics eager to avoid socialism after the Second World War. While Coventry agrees that the Keynesianism has considerable benefits, he argues that these benefits arose from the next phase of capitalism with many of the disadvantages being forced onto peoples in the third world, such as in British Malaya where there was bloodshed for crucial resources.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The same amount of work is done by the object when decelerating from its current speed to a state of rest.\nThe SI unit of energy is the joule, while the English unit of energy is the foot-pound.\nIn relativistic mechanics, formula_1 is a good approximation of kinetic energy only when \"v\" is much less than the speed of light.\nHistory and etymology.\nThe adjective \"kinetic\" has its roots in the Greek word \u03ba\u03af\u03bd\u03b7\u03c3\u03b9\u03c2 \"kinesis\", meaning \"motion\". The dichotomy between kinetic energy and potential energy can be traced back to Aristotle's concepts of actuality and potentiality. \nThe principle of classical mechanics that \"E\" \u221d \"mv\"2 is conserved was developed by Gottfried Leibniz and Johann Bernoulli, who described kinetic energy as the \"living force\" or \"vis viva\". Willem 's Gravesande of the Netherlands provided experimental evidence of this relationship in 1722. By dropping weights from different heights into a block of clay, Gravesande determined that their penetration depth was proportional to the square of their impact speed. \u00c9milie du Ch\u00e2telet recognized the implications of the experiment and published an explanation.\nThe terms \"kinetic energy\" and \"work\" in their present scientific meanings date back to the mid-19th century. Early understandings of these ideas can be attributed to Thomas Young, who in his 1802 lecture to the Royal Society, was the first to use the term \"energy\" to refer to kinetic energy in its modern sense, instead of \"vis viva\". Gaspard-Gustave Coriolis published in 1829 the paper titled \"Du Calcul de l'Effet des Machines\" outlining the mathematics of kinetic energy. William Thomson, later Lord Kelvin, is given the credit for coining the term \"kinetic energy\" c. 1849\u20131851. William Rankine, who had introduced the term \"potential energy\" in 1853, and the phrase \"actual energy\" to complement it, later cites William Thomson and Peter Tait as substituting the word \"kinetic\" for \"actual\".\nOverview.\nEnergy occurs in many forms, including chemical energy, thermal energy, electromagnetic radiation, gravitational energy, electric energy, elastic energy, nuclear energy, and rest energy. These can be categorized in two main classes: potential energy and kinetic energy. Kinetic energy is the movement energy of an object. Kinetic energy can be transferred between objects and transformed into other kinds of energy.\nKinetic energy may be best understood by examples that demonstrate how it is transformed to and from other forms of energy. For example, a cyclist transfers chemical energy provided by food to the bicycle and cyclist's store of kinetic energy as they increase their speed. On a level surface, this speed can be maintained without further work, except to overcome air resistance and friction. The chemical energy has been converted into kinetic energy, the energy of motion, but the process is not completely efficient and produces thermal energy within the cyclist.\nThe kinetic energy in the moving cyclist and the bicycle can be converted to other forms. For example, the cyclist could encounter a hill just high enough to coast up, so that the bicycle comes to a complete halt at the top. The kinetic energy has now largely been converted to gravitational potential energy that can be released by freewheeling down the other side of the hill. Since the bicycle lost some of its energy to friction, it never regains all of its speed without additional pedaling. The energy is not destroyed; it has only been converted to another form by friction. Alternatively, the cyclist could connect a dynamo to one of the wheels and generate some electrical energy on the descent. The bicycle would be traveling slower at the bottom of the hill than without the generator because some of the energy has been diverted into electrical energy. Another possibility would be for the cyclist to apply the brakes, in which case the kinetic energy would be dissipated through friction as heat.\nLike any physical quantity that is a function of velocity, the kinetic energy of an object depends on the relationship between the object and the observer's frame of reference. Thus, the kinetic energy of an object is not invariant.\nSpacecraft use chemical energy to launch and gain considerable kinetic energy to reach orbital velocity. In an entirely circular orbit, this kinetic energy remains constant because there is almost no friction in near-earth space. However, it becomes apparent at re-entry when some of the kinetic energy is converted to heat. If the orbit is elliptical or hyperbolic, then throughout the orbit kinetic and potential energy are exchanged; kinetic energy is greatest and potential energy lowest at closest approach to the earth or other massive body, while potential energy is greatest and kinetic energy the lowest at maximum distance. Disregarding loss or gain however, the sum of the kinetic and potential energy remains constant.\nKinetic energy can be passed from one object to another. In the game of billiards, the player imposes kinetic energy on the cue ball by striking it with the cue stick. If the cue ball collides with another ball, it slows down dramatically, and the ball it hit accelerates as the kinetic energy is passed on to it. Collisions in billiards are effectively elastic collisions, in which kinetic energy is preserved. In inelastic collisions, kinetic energy is dissipated in various forms of energy, such as heat, sound and binding energy (breaking bound structures).\nFlywheels have been developed as a method of energy storage. This illustrates that kinetic energy is also stored in rotational motion.\nSeveral mathematical descriptions of kinetic energy exist that describe it in the appropriate physical situation. For objects and processes in common human experience, the formula mv2 given by classical mechanics is suitable. However, if the speed of the object is comparable to the speed of light, relativistic effects become significant and the relativistic formula is used. If the object is on the atomic or sub-atomic scale, quantum mechanical effects are significant, and a quantum mechanical model must be employed.\nKinetic energy for non-relativistic velocity.\nTreatments of kinetic energy depend upon the relative velocity of objects compared to the fixed speed of light. Speeds experienced directly by humans are non-relativisitic; higher speeds require the theory of relativity. \nKinetic energy of rigid bodies.\nIn classical mechanics, the kinetic energy of a \"point object\" (an object so small that its mass can be assumed to exist at one point), or a non-rotating rigid body depends on the mass of the body as well as its speed. The kinetic energy is equal to half the product of the mass and the square of the speed. In formula form:\nformula_3\nwhere formula_4 is the mass and formula_5 is the speed (magnitude of the velocity) of the body. In SI units, mass is measured in kilograms, speed in metres per second, and the resulting kinetic energy is in joules.\nFor example, one would calculate the kinetic energy of an 80\u00a0kg mass (about 180\u00a0lbs) traveling at 18\u00a0metres per second (about 40\u00a0mph, or 65\u00a0km/h) as\nformula_6\nWhen a person throws a ball, the person does work on it to give it speed as it leaves the hand. The moving ball can then hit something and push it, doing work on what it hits. The kinetic energy of a moving object is equal to the work required to bring it from rest to that speed, or the work the object can do while being brought to rest: net force \u00d7 displacement = kinetic energy, i.e.,\nformula_7\nSince the kinetic energy increases with the square of the speed, an object doubling its speed has four times as much kinetic energy. For example, a car traveling twice as fast as another requires four times as much distance to stop, assuming a constant braking force. As a consequence of this quadrupling, it takes four times the work to double the speed.\nThe kinetic energy of an object is related to its momentum by the equation:\nformula_8\nwhere:\nFor the \"translational kinetic energy,\" that is the kinetic energy associated with rectilinear motion, of a rigid body with constant mass formula_4, whose center of mass is moving in a straight line with speed formula_5, as seen above is equal to\nformula_13\nwhere:\nThe kinetic energy of any entity depends on the reference frame in which it is measured. However, the total energy of an isolated system, i.e. one in which energy can neither enter nor leave, does not change over time in the reference frame in which it is measured. Thus, the chemical energy converted to kinetic energy by a rocket engine is divided differently between the rocket ship and its exhaust stream depending upon the chosen reference frame. This is called the Oberth effect. But the total energy of the system, including kinetic energy, fuel chemical energy, heat, etc., is conserved over time, regardless of the choice of reference frame. Different observers moving with different reference frames would however disagree on the value of this conserved energy.\nThe kinetic energy of such systems depends on the choice of reference frame: the reference frame that gives the minimum value of that energy is the center of momentum frame, i.e. the reference frame in which the total momentum of the system is zero. This minimum kinetic energy contributes to the invariant mass of the system as a whole.\nDerivation.\nWithout vector calculus.\nThe work W done by a force \"F\" on an object over a distance \"s\" parallel to \"F\" equals \nformula_16\nUsing Newton's second law \nformula_17 \nwith \"m\" the mass and \"a\" the acceleration of the object and \nformula_18\nthe distance traveled by the accelerated object in time \"t\", we find with formula_19 for the velocity \"v\" of the object\nformula_20\nWith vector calculus.\nThe work done in accelerating a particle with mass \"m\" during the infinitesimal time interval \"dt\" is given by the dot product of \"force\" F and the infinitesimal \"displacement\" \"d\"x\nformula_21\nwhere we have assumed the relationship p\u00a0=\u00a0\"m\"\u00a0v and the validity of Newton's second law. (However, also see the special relativistic derivation below.)\nApplying the product rule we see that:\nformula_22\nTherefore (assuming constant mass so that \"dm\" = 0), we have\nformula_23\nSince this is a total differential (that is, it only depends on the final state, not how the particle got there), we can integrate it and call the result kinetic energy:\nformula_24\nThis equation states that the kinetic energy (\"E\"k) is equal to the integral of the dot product of the momentum (p) of a body and the infinitesimal change of the velocity (v) of the body. It is assumed that the body starts with no kinetic energy when it is at rest (motionless).\nRotating bodies.\nIf a rigid body Q is rotating about any line through the center of mass then it has \"rotational kinetic energy\" (formula_25) which is simply the sum of the kinetic energies of its moving parts, and is thus given by:\nformula_26\nwhere:\n(In this equation the moment of inertia must be taken about an axis through the center of mass and the rotation measured by \u03c9 must be around that axis; more general equations exist for systems where the object is subject to wobble due to its eccentric shape).\nKinetic energy of systems.\nA system of bodies may have internal kinetic energy due to the relative motion of the bodies in the system. For example, in the Solar System the planets and planetoids are orbiting the Sun. In a tank of gas, the molecules are moving in all directions. The kinetic energy of the system is the sum of the kinetic energies of the bodies it contains.\nA macroscopic body that is stationary (i.e. a reference frame has been chosen to correspond to the body's center of momentum) may have various kinds of internal energy at the molecular or atomic level, which may be regarded as kinetic energy, due to molecular translation, rotation, and vibration, electron translation and spin, and nuclear spin. These all contribute to the body's mass, as provided by the special theory of relativity. When discussing movements of a macroscopic body, the kinetic energy referred to is usually that of the macroscopic movement only. However, all internal energies of all types contribute to a body's mass, inertia, and total energy.\nFluid dynamics.\nIn fluid dynamics, the kinetic energy per unit volume at each point in an incompressible fluid flow field is called the dynamic pressure at that point.\nformula_3\nDividing by V, the unit of volume:\nformula_30\nwhere formula_31 is the dynamic pressure, and \u03c1 is the density of the incompressible fluid.\nFrame of reference.\nThe speed, and thus the kinetic energy of a single object is frame-dependent (relative): it can take any non-negative value, by choosing a suitable inertial frame of reference. For example, a bullet passing an observer has kinetic energy in the reference frame of this observer. The same bullet is stationary to an observer moving with the same velocity as the bullet, and so has zero kinetic energy. By contrast, the total kinetic energy of a system of objects cannot be reduced to zero by a suitable choice of the inertial reference frame, unless all the objects have the same velocity. In any other case, the total kinetic energy has a non-zero minimum, as no inertial reference frame can be chosen in which all the objects are stationary. This minimum kinetic energy contributes to the system's invariant mass, which is independent of the reference frame.\nThe total kinetic energy of a system depends on the inertial frame of reference: it is the sum of the total kinetic energy in a center of momentum frame and the kinetic energy the total mass would have if it were concentrated in the center of mass.\nThis may be simply shown: let formula_32 be the relative velocity of the center of mass frame \"i\" in the frame \"k\". Since\nformula_33\nThen,\nformula_34\nHowever, let formula_35 the kinetic energy in the center of mass frame, formula_36 would be simply the total momentum that is by definition zero in the center of mass frame, and let the total mass: formula_37. Substituting, we get:\nformula_38\nThus the kinetic energy of a system is lowest to center of momentum reference frames, i.e., frames of reference in which the center of mass is stationary (either the center of mass frame or any other center of momentum frame). In any different frame of reference, there is additional kinetic energy corresponding to the total mass moving at the speed of the center of mass. The kinetic energy of the system in the center of momentum frame is a quantity that is invariant (all observers see it to be the same).\nRotation in systems.\nIt sometimes is convenient to split the total kinetic energy of a body into the sum of the body's center-of-mass translational kinetic energy and the energy of rotation around the center of mass (rotational energy):\nformula_39\nwhere:\nThus the kinetic energy of a tennis ball in flight is the kinetic energy due to its rotation, plus the kinetic energy due to its translation.\nRelativistic kinetic energy.\nIf a body's speed relative to an inertial frame is a significant fraction of the speed of light, it is necessary to use relativistic mechanics to calculate its kinetic energy relative to that frame.\nIn relativistic mechanics, energy combines with momentum in a way analogous to the combination of time and space into spacetime. The energy component in the inertial frame can be expressed as: \nformula_40\nwhere formula_41 and formula_4 is the object's (rest) mass, formula_5 speed, and \"c\" the speed of light in vacuum. If the body is at rest in the inertial frame, formula_44 and formula_45, so formula_46. The rest energy of an object is its rest mass in units where formula_47. In SI units, formula_48. The kinetic energy can then be defined as the total energy minus the rest energy:\nformula_49\nAnother way to describe the kinetic energy is to start with the total energy given by the energy-momentum relation:\nformula_50\nHere formula_51 is the relativistic expression for linear momentum, where formula_41 and formula_4 is the object's (rest) mass, formula_5 speed, and \"c\" the speed of light in vacuum.\nThen kinetic energy is the total relativistic energy minus the rest energy:\nformula_55\nAt low speeds, the square root can be expanded and the rest energy drops out, giving the Newtonian kinetic energy. \nLow speed limit.\nThe mathematical by-product of this calculation is the mass\u2013energy equivalence formula, that mass and energy are essentially the same thing:\nformula_56\nAt a low speed (\"v\" \u226a \"c\"), the relativistic kinetic energy is approximated well by the classical kinetic energy. To see this, apply the binomial approximation or take the first two terms of the Taylor expansion in powers of formula_57 for the reciprocal square root:\nformula_58\nSo, the total energy formula_59 can be partitioned into the rest mass energy plus the non-relativistic kinetic energy at low speeds.\nWhen objects move at a speed much slower than light (e.g. in everyday phenomena on Earth), the first two terms of the series predominate. The next term in the Taylor series approximation\nformula_60\nis small for low speeds. For example, for a speed of the correction to the non-relativistic kinetic energy is 0.0417\u00a0J/kg (on a non-relativistic kinetic energy of 50\u00a0MJ/kg) and for a speed of 100\u00a0km/s it is 417\u00a0J/kg (on a non-relativistic kinetic energy of 5\u00a0GJ/kg).\nThe relativistic relation between kinetic energy and momentum is given by\nformula_61\nThis can also be expanded as a Taylor series, the first term of which is the simple expression from Newtonian mechanics:\nformula_62\nThis suggests that the formulae for energy and momentum are not special and axiomatic, but concepts emerging from the equivalence of mass and energy and the principles of relativity.\nGeneral relativity.\nUsing the convention that\nformula_63\nwhere the four-velocity of a particle is\nformula_64\nand formula_65 is the proper time of the particle, there is also an expression for the kinetic energy of the particle in general relativity.\nIf the particle has momentum\nformula_66\nas it passes by an observer with four-velocity \"u\"obs, then the expression for total energy of the particle as observed (measured in a local inertial frame) is\nformula_67\nand the kinetic energy can be expressed as the total energy minus the rest energy:\nformula_68\nConsider the case of a metric that is diagonal and spatially isotropic (\"g\"\"tt\", \"g\"\"ss\", \"g\"\"ss\", \"g\"\"ss\"). Since\nformula_69\nwhere \"v\"\u03b1 is the ordinary velocity measured w.r.t. the coordinate system, we get\nformula_70\nSolving for \"u\"t gives\nformula_71\nThus for a stationary observer (\"v\" = 0)\nformula_72\nand thus the kinetic energy takes the form\nformula_73\nFactoring out the rest energy gives:\nformula_74\nThis expression reduces to the special relativistic case for the flat-space metric where\nformula_75\nIn the Newtonian approximation to general relativity\nformula_76\nwhere \u03a6 is the Newtonian gravitational potential. This means clocks run slower and measuring rods are shorter near massive bodies.\nKinetic energy in quantum mechanics.\nIn quantum mechanics, observables like kinetic energy are represented as operators. For one particle of mass \"m\", the kinetic energy operator appears as a term in the Hamiltonian and is defined in terms of the more fundamental momentum operator formula_77. The kinetic energy operator in the non-relativistic case can be written as\nformula_78\nNotice that this can be obtained by replacing formula_9 by formula_77 in the classical expression for kinetic energy in terms of momentum,\nformula_81\nIn the Schr\u00f6dinger picture, formula_77 takes the form formula_83 where the derivative is taken with respect to position coordinates and hence\nformula_84\nThe expectation value of the electron kinetic energy, formula_85, for a system of \"N\" electrons described by the wavefunction formula_86 is a sum of 1-electron operator expectation values:\nformula_87\nwhere formula_88 is the mass of the electron and formula_89 is the Laplacian operator acting upon the coordinates of the \"i\"th electron and the summation runs over all electrons.\nThe density functional formalism of quantum mechanics requires knowledge of the electron density \"only\", i.e., it formally does not require knowledge of the wavefunction. Given an electron density formula_90, the exact N-electron kinetic energy functional is unknown; however, for the specific case of a 1-electron system, the kinetic energy can be written as\nformula_91\nwhere formula_92 is known as the von Weizs\u00e4cker kinetic energy functional.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Subsequently numbered the 60th Regiment of Foot, the regiment served for more than 200 years throughout the British Empire. In 1958, the regiment joined the Oxfordshire and Buckinghamshire Light Infantry and the Rifle Brigade in the Green Jackets Brigade and in 1966 the three regiments were formally amalgamated to become the Royal Green Jackets. The KRRC became the 2nd Battalion, Royal Green Jackets. On the disbandment of the 1st Battalion, Royal Green Jackets in 1992, the RGJ's KRRC battalion was redesignated as the 1st Battalion, Royal Green Jackets, eventually becoming 2nd Battalion, The Rifles in 2007.\nHistory.\nFrench and Indian War.\nThe King's Royal Rifle Corps was raised in the American colonies in 1756 as the 62nd (Royal American) Regiment to defend the colonies against attack by the French and their indigenous allies. After Braddock's defeat in 1755, royal approval for a new regiment, as well as funds, were granted by parliament just before Christmas 1755 \u2013 hence the regiment's traditional birthday of Christmas Day. However, parliamentary delays meant that it was 4 March 1756 before a special act of parliament created four battalions of 1,000 men each to include foreigners for service in the Americas.\nA regimental history compiled in 1879 states that, in November 1755, Parliament voted the sum of \u00a381,000 for the purpose of raising a regiment of four battalions, each one thousand strong, for service in British North America. To provide experienced personnel, Parliament passed the Commissions to Foreign Protestants Act 1756 (29 Geo. 2. c. 5) The Earl of Loudoun, who as commander-in-chief of the Forces in North America, was appointed colonel-in-chief of the regiment. About fifty officers' commissions were given to Germans and Swiss, and none were allowed to rise above the rank of lieutenant-colonel.\nAccording to a modern history of the regiment, the idea for creating this unique force was proposed by Jacques Prevost, a Swiss soldier and adventurer who was a friend of the Duke of Cumberland (the Duke was the King's third son and also Commander-in-Chief of the Forces). Prevost recognised the need for soldiers who understood forest warfare, unlike the regulars who were brought to America in 1755 by General Edward Braddock.\nThe regiment was intended to combine the characteristics of a colonial corps with those of a foreign legion. Swiss and German forest fighting experts, American colonists and volunteers from other British Army regiments were recruited. These men were Protestants, an important consideration for fighting against the predominantly Catholic French. The officers were also recruited from Europe \u2013 not from the American colonies \u2013 and consisted of English, Scots, Irish, Dutch, Swiss and Germans. It was the first time foreign officers were commissioned as British Army officers. In total, the regiment consisted of 101 officers, 240 non-commissioned officers and 4,160 enlisted men. The battalions were raised on Governors Island, New York. The regiment was renumbered the 60th (Royal American) Regiment in February 1757 when the 50th (Shirley's) and 51st (Pepperrell's) foot regiments were removed from the British Army roll after their surrender at Fort Oswego.\nAmong the distinguished foreign officers given commissions in the 60th (Royal Americans) was Henry Bouquet, a Swiss citizen, whose forward-looking ideas on tactics, training and man-management (including the unofficial introduction of the rifle and more practical clothing suited to bush-fighting) would come to be accepted as standard in the British Army many years in the future. Bouquet was commanding officer of the 1st battalion, and with his fellow battalion commanders, worked to form units that were better suited to warfare in the forests and lakes of northeast America.\nElements of the new regiment fought at Louisbourg in June 1758, the Cape Sable Campaign in September 1758 and Quebec in September 1759, and finally the Montreal Campaign from July to September 1760 which finally wrested Canada from France. At Quebec General James Wolfe is said to have granted the 60th the motto (Swift and Bold). To reward and maintain their service and loyalty, Parliament passed the American Protestant Soldier Naturalization Act 1762 (2 Geo. 3. c. 25), which offered British naturalization to those officers, engineers and soldiers who had or would serve for two years, with certain conditions and on the model of the Plantation Act 1740.\nThese earlier engagements were conventional battles on the European model, but fighting during Pontiac's War in 1763 was of a very different character. The frontier war threatened the British control of North America. The new regiment at first lost several outlying garrisons such as Fort Michilimackinac, later a detachment fought under Bouquet's leadership at the victory of Bushy Run in August 1763.\nThe 60th was uniformed and equipped in a similar manner to other British regiments with red coats and cocked hats or grenadier caps, but on campaign, swords were replaced with hatchets, and coats and hats cut down for ease of movement in the woods.\nAmerican War of Independence.\nTwo additional battalions of the regiment (the 3rd and 4th battalions) were raised in England in 1775, principally of men recruited from England and Hanover in 1775 for service in the American War of Independence. After assembly in the Isle of Wight, both battalions were sent in 1776 to Florida where they were joined by detachments from 1st and 2nd Battalions. These battalions were deployed to Georgia and were involved in skirmishes at Sudbury in January 1779, the Battle of Brier Creek in March 1779, the Siege of Savannah in October 1779 where elements from the 4th Battalion captured the colour of the 2nd South Carolina Regiment, and at Augusta in September 1780. The 3rd battalion later took part in the British defense of the Gulf Coast. Elements of the battalion fought at the Battle at The Village and the Siege of Pensacola. The 3rd and 4th battalions were disbanded in June 1783.\nNapoleonic Wars.\nDuring the Napoleonic Wars, the regiment saw action in the Peninsular War. The first four battalions had been raised as regular line battalions, but in 1797 a 5th battalion had been raised on Barbados, with additional companies formed on the Isle of Wight, and equipped entirely with rifles. The troops of the 5th battalion were so effective that Sir Arthur Wellesley recommended their use to the divisional commanders describing them as the \"most useful, active and brave troops in the field\".\nA 7th battalion was raised specifically for service in the American War of 1812.\nAnglo-Egyptian War and Second Boer War.\nAfter the Napoleonic Wars, the regiment received a new title: first, in 1815, its name was changed to The Duke of York's Own Rifle Corps and then, in 1830, to the King's Royal Rifle Corps (KRRC). In 1858, the Rifle Depot at Winchester was made their headquarters. The regiment served in the Anglo-Egyptian War in 1882. During the rest of the 1800s, the unit also was active in China, Canada (Wolseley expedition), Afghanistan, India, Burma and South Africa. The regiment was deployed during the Second Boer War from the outset playing a key role in the first battle at Talana Hill. Two officers from the regiment were awarded the Victoria Cross; Lieutenant Frederick Roberts and Lieutenant Llewelyn Alberic Emilius Price-Davies. Private Frederick Corbett also received the Victoria Cross for his action at Kafr Dowar, Egypt, on 5 August 1882; his VC was later rescinded when he was convicted of embezzlement, theft, and being absent without leave.\nFollowing the end of the war in South Africa, the 1st battalion was transferred to Malta, where it arrived in October 1902.\nIn 1908, the Volunteers and Militia were reorganised nationally, with the former becoming the Territorial Force and the latter the Special Reserve; the regiment now had two Reserve but no Territorial battalions.\nFirst World War.\nRegular Army.\nThe 1st Battalion landed at Rouen as part of the 6th Brigade in the 2nd Division in August 1914 for service on the Western Front. It saw action at the Battle of Mons in August 1914, the First Battle of the Marne and the First Battle of the Aisne in September 1914 and First Battle of Ypres in October 1914. It fought at the Battle of Festubert in May 1915, the Battle of Loos in September 1915 and the Battle of the Somme in Autumn 1916 before taking part in the advance to the Hindenburg Line, the Battle of Arras in November 1917, the Battle of Cambrai in November 1917, the Second Battle of the Somme in Autumn 1918 and the Battle of the Selle in October 1918.\nThe 2nd Battalion landed at Le Havre as part of the 2nd Brigade in the 1st Division in August 1914 for service on the Western Front and saw action at the Battle of Aubers Ridge in May 1915.\nThe 3rd Battalion landed at Le Havre as part of the 80th Brigade in the 27th Division in December 1914 for service on the Western Front and saw action at the Second Battle of Ypres in April 1915.\nThe 4th Battalion landed at Le Havre as part of the 80th Brigade in the 27th Division in December 1914 for service on the Western Front and saw action at the Second Battle of Ypres in April 1915 but moved to Salonika in November 1915 before returning to France in June 1918.\nTerritorial force.\nThe regiment did not have any territorial force battalions.\nNew armies.\nThe 7th (Service) Battalion landed at Boulogne-sur-Mer as part of the 41st Brigade in the 14th (Light) Division in August 1914 for service on the Western Front and saw action in the Second Battle of Ypres in May 1915, the Battle of Delville Wood in July 1916 and the Battle of Flers\u2013Courcelette in September 1916 as well as the advance to the Hindenburg Line, the Battle of Arras in April 1917, the Battle of Langemark in August 1917, the First Battle of Passchendaele in October 1917 and the Second Battle of Passchendaele in November 1917 before taking part in the Battle of St Quentin in March 1918 and the Battle of the Avre in April 1918.\nThe 8th (Service) Battalion landed at Boulogne-sur-Mer as part of the 41st Brigade in the 14th (Light) Division in May 1915 for service on the Western Front and saw action in most of the same battles as the 7th Battalion. The 9th (Service) Battalion landed at Boulogne-sur-Mer as part of the 42nd Brigade in the 14th (Light) Division in May 1915 for service on the Western Front and saw action in most of the same battles as the 7th and 8th battalions.\nThe 10th (Service) Battalion and 11th (Service) Battalion landed at Boulogne-sur-Mer as part of the 59th Brigade in the 20th (Light) Division in July 1915 for service on the Western Front and saw action at the Battle of Mont Sorrel in June 1916, the Battle of Delville Wood in July 1916 and the Battle of Guillemont in September 1916 as well as the Battle of Flers\u2013Courcelette in September 1916, the Battle of Morval in September 1916 and the Battle of Le Transloy in October 1916 before taking part in the advance to the Hindenburg Line, the Battle of Langemarck in August 1917, the Battle of the Menin Road Ridge in September 1917, the Battle of Polygon Wood in September 1917 and the Battle of Cambrai in November 1917.\nThe 12th (Service) Battalion landed at Boulogne-sur-Mer as part of the 60th Brigade in the 20th (Light) Division in July 1915 for service on the Western Front and saw action in most of the same battles as the 10th and 11th Battalions.\nThe 13th (Service) Battalion landed at Boulogne-sur-Mer as part of the 111th Brigade in the 37th Division in July 1915 for service on the Western Front and saw action at the Battle of Morval in September 1916, the advance to the Hindenburg Line and the Battle of Arras in April 1917 as well as the Battle of Passchendaele in Autumn 1917, the Battle of Cambrai in November 1917 and the Hundred Days Offensive in Autumn 1918 before taking part in the Battles of the Hindenburg Line and the Final Advance in Picardy.\nThe 16th (Service) Battalion (Church Lads' Brigade) landed at Le Havre as part of the 100th Brigade in the 33rd Division in November 1915 for service on the Western Front.\nThe 17th (Service) Battalion (British Empire League) landed at Le Havre as part of the 117th Brigade in the 39th Division in March 1916 for service on the Western Front.\nThe 18th (Service) Battalion (Arts &amp; Crafts) landed at Le Havre as part of the 122nd Brigade in the 41st Division on 3 May 1916 for service on the Western Front.\nThe 20th (Service) Battalion (British Empire League Pioneers) landed at Le Havre as pioneer battalion for the 3rd Division in March 1916 for service on the Western Front.\nThe 21st (Service) Battalion (Yeoman Rifles) landed in France as part of the 124th Brigade in the 41st Division in May 1916 for service on the Western Front but moved to Italy in November 1917 before returning to France in March 1918.\nSeven members of the regiment received the Victoria Cross.\nInter-war years.\nAfter 1918, the unit returned to garrison duties in India, Palestine and Ireland. In 1922, the regiment was reduced from four to two battalions with the third and fourth being disbanded. In 1926, the Regiment was reorganised as one of the first mechanised infantry regiments.\nSecond World War.\nThe 1st Battalion, KRRC, commanded initially by Lieutenant Colonel William Gott, was deployed to North Africa upon war's outbreak and saw action as part of the pivot group within the 7th Armoured Division at the Battle of Sidi Rezegh in November 1941, the First Battle of El Alamein in July 1942 and the Second Battle of El Alamein in October 1942 during the Western Desert Campaign. Rifleman John Beeley was awarded a posthumous Victoria Cross for his actions during Operation Crusader in North Africa in late 1941. The battalion, now part of the 2nd Armoured Brigade of the 1st Armoured Division, was then engaged in action throughout the final stages of the Tunisian Campaign. The battalion, now commanded by Lieutenant Colonel Edward Williams, served in the Italian Campaign then with the independent 9th Armoured Brigade and finally the 6th Armoured Division's 61st Infantry Brigade.\nThe 2nd Battalion, KRRC, commanded by Lieutenant Colonel Thomas Wilson, was part of the British Expeditionary Force (BEF) that landed in France in May 1940. The battalion, which was part of the 30th Infantry Brigade, 1st Armoured Division, and now commanded by Lieutenant Colonel Euan Miller, was lost in the defence of Calais, where the brigade slowed the German advance and enabled the Dunkirk evacuation to proceed. The battalion was reformed in the summer of 1940 under the command of Lieutenant Colonel George Erskine and transferred to the 22nd Armoured Brigade of the 1st Armoured Division. The reformed battalion took part in the Battle of Gazala in May 1942 and the Second Battle of El Alamein in October 1942 during the North African Campaign, forming part of the division's 7th Motor Brigade during the latter engagement and transferring to 4th Armoured Brigade in January 1943. Now under Lieutenant Colonel W. Heathcote-Amory, the battalion continued serving with 4th Armoured Brigade in the Normandy landings in June 1944 and the subsequent campaign in North-West Europe, finally leaving 1st Division six days after VE Day. Two officers of note served with the battalion in its final campaign of the war, Roland Gibbs and Edwin Bramall.\nThe 1st Battalion of the Queen Victoria's Rifles (QFR) was a Territorial Army (TA) unit which had been closely associated with the KRRC. The battalion, commanded by Lieutenant Colonel J. A. M. Elison-Mccartney, was initially part of the TA 1st London Division, serving as the division's motorcycle battalion. However, like the 2nd Battalion, it was also lost in the defence of Calais in May 1940. The battalion was later reformed in the United Kingdom and, in December 1940, transferred to the 27th Armoured Brigade, part of the newly formed 9th Armoured Division.\nThe 9th Battalion (The Rangers) was deployed to the Mediterranean theatre as part of the 1st Armoured Brigade in the 7th Armoured Division. It saw action in the Greek campaign in April 1941 before being disbanded in August 1942.\nRoyal Green Jackets and The Rifles.\nIn 1958 for administrative purposes, the KRRC was brigaded with the Oxfordshire and Buckinghamshire Light Infantry and the Rifle Brigade to form the Green Jackets Brigade. In 1958, the regiment was re-titled the 2nd Green Jackets, the King's Royal Rifle Corps, while the two other regiments of the Green Jackets Brigade were re-titled the 1st Green Jackets (43rd and 52nd) and 3rd Green Jackets, the Rifle Brigade (Prince Consort's Own) respectively. In 1966, the three regiments were amalgamated to form the three battalions of the Royal Green Jackets.\nRegimental museum.\nThe regimental collection is held by the Royal Green Jackets (Rifles) Museum which is based at Peninsula Barracks in Winchester.\nTerritorial battalions.\nThe territorial battalions were as follows:\nIn the Second World War, the following territorial battalions were formally made part of the KRRC:\nCadet battalions.\nThere were two cadet battalions: 1st Cadet Battalion, The King's Royal Rifle Corps and Queen Victoria's Rifles Cadet Corps (re-titled the 2nd Cadet Battalion, The King's Royal Rifle Corps in 1945). Over the years, the formation of the cadet battalions was changed regularly, due to the changes to do with rules and the commanding officer. The 1st Cadet Battalion owes its foundation to the Reverend Freeman Wills, who was commissioned into the Volunteer Army in the rank of captain on 26 July 1890. He was also Vicar of St Agatha's just behind Sun Street, Finsbury Square. On receiving his commission he decided to form a cadet company within the 1st Cadet Battalion, the Royal West Surrey Regiment. The company quickly expanded to become the 2nd Cadet Battalion, the Royal West Surrey Regiment, at which point he moved the battalion headquarters to No. 2 Finsbury Square (and in 1904 to 24 Sun Street, which he had specially built for the purpose). In 1894 he applied to Prince George, Duke of Cambridge, Colonel-in-Chief, to affiliate to the regiment, with the title of 1st Cadet Battalion, the King's Royal Rifle Corps. Consent was granted on 8 November 1894, and the battalion has remained a part of the regiment ever since.\nIn the days of their foundation, cadet battalions were privately organised and funded. On becoming a part of the King's Royal Rifle Corps, subscriptions began to flow in and, after the commanding officer had spent nearly \u00a31,000, the battalion was placed on a financial basis that many volunteer corps would have envied. There were to be many ups and down in later years, especially when recognition of the Cadet Force was withdrawn between the two world wars, but fortunately the enthusiasm and commitment of those involved consistently triumphed over the parsimony of governments.\nIn 1900, when volunteers were urgently needed for the Second Boer War, the commanding officer, Colonel Freeman Croft-Wills, persuaded the War Office to accept a company of the older cadets, principally N.C.O.s (non-commissioned officers), the company being enrolled in the City Imperial Volunteers. Around 100 cadets thus served in South Africa with this unit, whilst other cadets and ex-cadets served in the Royal Army Medical Corps, and other units. Four were killed in action, one serving with the 1st Battalion King's Royal Rifle Corps at the Battle of Dundee, and the others with units of the C.I.V.s. Their comrades erected brass plaques in their memory in the Drill Hall at Sun Street. These are now displayed in the Cadet Company Office here at Davies Street.\nIn recognition of this service, King Edward VII granted the battalion the honour of wearing on its accoutrements the battle honour \"South Africa 1900\u20131902\" (Army Order 151 of 1905). The announcement of this privilege was made to the battalion by King George V, then Prince of Wales, when, accompanied by Queen Mary, he distributed the prizes at the Guildhall in the City of London. The 1st Cadet Battalion King's Royal Rifle Corps are the only cadet unit in the United Kingdom to have been granted such an honour and are permitted to wear the miniature 60th cap badge with the single battle honour, and call their cadets \"riflemen\".\nThe 2nd Cadet Battalion, the King's Royal Rifle Corps was formed in 1942 when a Home Guard instruction was issued ordering each Home Guard battalion to raise a cadet unit. Lieutenant-Colonel R.L. Clark of Queen Victoria's Rifles was given the task, and on 15 May 1942 the Queen Victoria's Rifles Cadet Corps was born. Over the next three years the unit expanded to five companies, which in April 1945 led to it being re-titled the 2nd Cadet Battalion, The King's Royal Rifle Corps. In 1951 the 1st and 2nd Cadet Battalion were amalgamated. This resulted in the disposal of the headquarters of the 1st Cadet Battalion at Sun Street. In 1954, the battalion office of the 'new' 1st Cadet Battalion was established at 56 Davies Street, where it remains to this day.\nToday, the KRRC 1st Cadet Battalion still exists, with the following units making up the battalion:\nAll these ACF units are currently in the Middlesex and Northwest London Sector Army Cadet Force.\nAlliances.\nAlliances include:\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "17333", "revid": "27992388", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=17333", "title": "Khoisan languages", "text": "Group of African language families with click consonants\nThe Khoisan languages ( ; also Khoesan or Khoesaan) are a number of African languages once classified together, originally by Joseph Greenberg. Khoisan is defined as those languages that have click consonants and do not belong to other African language families. For much of the 20th century, they were thought to be genealogically related to each other, but this is no longer accepted. They are now held to comprise three distinct language families and two language isolates.\nAll but two Khoisan languages are indigenous to southern Africa; these are classified into three language families. The Khoe family appears to have migrated to southern Africa not long before the Bantu expansion. Ethnically, their speakers are the Khoekhoe and the San (Bushmen). Two languages of eastern Africa, those of the Sandawe and Hadza, were originally also classified as Khoisan, although their speakers are ethnically neither Khoekhoe nor San.\nBefore the Bantu expansion, Khoisan languages, or languages like them, were likely spread throughout southern and eastern Africa. They are currently restricted to the Kalahari Desert, primarily in Namibia and Botswana, and to the Rift Valley in central Tanzania.\nMost of the languages are endangered, and several are moribund or extinct. Most have no written record. The only widespread Khoisan language is Khoekhoe (also known as Khoekhoegowab, N\u00e0m\u00e1 or Damara) of Namibia, Botswana and South Africa, with a quarter of a million speakers; Sandawe in Tanzania is second in number with some 40\u201380,000, some monolingual; and the \u01c3Kung language of the northern Kalahari spoken by some 16,000 or so people. Language use is quite strong among the 20,000 speakers of Naro, half of whom speak it as a second language.\nKhoisan languages are best known for their use of click consonants as phonemes. These are typically written with characters such as \u01c3 and \u01c2. Clicks are quite versatile as consonants, as they involve two articulations of the tongue which can operate partially independently. Consequently, the languages with the greatest numbers of consonants in the world are Khoisan. The Ju\u01c0\u02bchoan language has 48 click consonants among nearly as many non-click consonants, strident and pharyngealized vowels, and four tones. The \u01c3X\u00f3\u00f5 and \u01c2H\u00f5\u00e3 languages are even more complex.\nValidity.\nKhoisan was proposed as one of the four families of African languages in Joseph Greenberg's classification (1949\u20131954, revised in 1963). However, linguists who study Khoisan languages reject their unity, and the name \"Khoisan\" is used by them as a term of convenience without any implication of linguistic validity, much as \"Papuan\" and \"Australian\" are. It has been suggested that the similarities of the Tuu and Kx\u02bca families are due to a southern African Sprachbund rather than a genealogical relationship, whereas the Khoe (or perhaps Kwadi\u2013Khoe) family is a more recent migrant to the area, and may be related to Sandawe in East Africa.\nErnst Oswald Johannes Westphal is known for his early rejection of the Khoisan language family (Starostin 2003). Bonny Sands (1998) concluded that the family is not demonstrable with current evidence. Anthony Traill at first accepted Khoisan (Traill 1986), but by 1998 concluded that it could not be demonstrated with current data and methods, rejecting it as based on a single typological criterion: the presence of clicks. Dimmendaal (2008) summarized the general view thus: \"[I]t has to be concluded that Greenberg's intuitions on the genetic unity of Khoisan could not be confirmed by subsequent research. Today, the few scholars working on these languages treat the three [southern groups] as independent language families that cannot or can no longer be shown to be genetically related\" (p.\u00a0841). Starostin (2013) accepts a relationship between Sandawe and Khoi is plausible, as is one between Tuu and Kx\u02bca, but sees no indication of a relationship between Sandawe and Khoi on the one hand and Tuu and Kx\u02bca on the other, or between any of them and Hadza.\nJanina Brutt-Griffler writes: \"Given that such colonial borders were generally arbitrarily drawn, they grouped large numbers of ethnic groups that spoke many languages.\" She hypothesizes that this took place within efforts to prevent the spread of English during European colonization and prevent the entrance of the majority into the middle class.\nKhoisan language variation.\nAnthony Traill noted the Khoisan languages' extreme variation. Despite their shared clicks, the Khoisan languages diverge significantly from each other. Traill demonstrated this linguistic diversity in the data presented in the below table. The first two columns include words from the two Khoisan language isolates, Sandawe and Hadza. The following three are languages from the Khoe family, the Kx\u02bca family, and the Tuu family, respectively.\nFamilies.\nThe branches that were once considered part of so-called Khoisan are now considered independent families, since it has not been demonstrated that they are related according to the standard comparative method.\nSee Khoe languages for speculations on the linguistic history of the region.\nHadza.\nWith about 800 speakers in Tanzania, Hadza is no longer seen as a Khoisan language and appears to be unrelated to any other language. Genetically, the Hadza people are unrelated to the Khoisan peoples of Southern Africa, and their closest relatives may be among the Pygmies of Central Africa.\nSandawe.\nThere is some indication that Sandawe (about 40,000 speakers in Tanzania) may be related to the Khoe family, such as a congruent pronominal system and some good Swadesh-list matches, but not enough to establish regular sound correspondences. Sandawe is not related to Hadza, despite their proximity.\nKhoe.\nThe Khoe family is both the most numerous and diverse family of Khoisan languages, with seven living languages and over a quarter million speakers. Although little Kwadi data is available, proto-Khoe\u2013Kwadi reconstructions have been made for pronouns and some basic vocabulary.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Tree list/styles.css\" /&gt;\nA Hai\u01c1om language is listed in most Khoisan references. A century ago the Hai\u01c1om people spoke a Ju dialect, probably close to \u01c3Kung, but they now speak a divergent dialect of Nama. Thus their language is variously said to be extinct or to have 18,000 speakers, to be Ju or to be Khoe. (Their numbers have been included under Nama above.) They are known as the \"Saa\" by the Nama, and this is the source of the word \"San\".\nTuu.\nThe Tuu family consists of two language clusters, which are related to each other at about the distance of Khoekhoe and Tshukhwe within Khoe. They are typologically very similar to the Kx\u02bca languages (below), but have not been demonstrated to be related to them genealogically (the similarities may be an areal feature).\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Tree list/styles.css\" /&gt;\nKx\u02bca.\nThe Kx\u02bca family is a relatively distant relationship formally demonstrated in 2010.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Tree list/styles.css\" /&gt;\nClassification by Starostin (2013).\nStarostin (2013) gives the following classification of the Khoisan \"macrofamily\", which he considers to be a single coherent language family. However, this classification is not widely accepted.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Tree list/styles.css\" /&gt;\nIn the tree on page 472, Starostin really writes \"Western \u01c2Hoan\", which is a synonym for Taa, but evidently means Eastern \u01c2Hoan, that is, \u01c2\u02bcAmkoe.\nOther \"click languages\".\nNot all languages using clicks as phonemes are considered Khoisan. Most others are neighboring Bantu languages in southern Africa: the Nguni languages (Xhosa, Zulu, Swazi, Phuthi, and Northern Ndebele); Sotho; Yeyi in Botswana; and Mbukushu, Kwangali, and Gciriku in the Caprivi Strip. Clicks are spreading to a few additional neighboring languages. Of these languages, Xhosa, Zulu, Ndebele and Yeyi have intricate systems of click consonants; the others, despite the click in the name \"Gciriku,\" more rudimentary ones. There is also the South Cushitic language Dahalo in Kenya, which has dental clicks in a few score words, and an extinct and presumably constructed Aboriginal Australian ritual language called Damin, which had only nasal clicks.\nThe Bantu languages adopted the use of clicks from neighboring, displaced, or absorbed Khoisan populations (or from other Bantu languages), often through intermarriage, while the Dahalo are thought to have retained clicks from an earlier language when they shifted to speaking a Cushitic language; if so, the pre-Dahalo language may have been something like Hadza or Sandawe. Damin is an invented ritual language, and has nothing to do with Khoisan.\nThese are the only languages known to have clicks in normal vocabulary. Occasionally other languages are said by laypeople to have \"click\" sounds. This is usually a misnomer for ejective consonants, which are found across much of the world, or is a reference to paralinguistic use of clicks such as English \"tsk! tsk!\"\nComparative vocabulary.\nSample basic vocabulary for Khoisan language families:\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The outbreak of World War II found her in the United Kingdom and she later moved to the United States, where she made her film debut in \"For Whom the Bell Tolls\" (1943) and won the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress and the Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actress. She became a naturalized citizen of the United States in 1951, but returned to Greece the following year, where she focused on her stage career and appeared in a number of European films including \"Rocco and His Brothers\" (1960).\nEarly life.\nPaxinou was born Ekaterini Konstantopoulou in 1900, the daughter of Vassilis Konstantopoulos and Eleni Malandrinou. She trained as an opera singer at the Conservatoire de Musique de Gen\u00e8ve and later in Berlin and Vienna. According to her biography in a 1942 \"Playbill\", Paxinou's family disowned her after she decided to seek a permanent stage career.\nCareer.\nPaxinou made her debut at the Municipal Theatre of Piraeus in 1920 in the operatic version of Maurice Maeterlinck's \"Sister Beatrice\", with a score by Dimitri Mitropoulos. She first appeared in a play in 1928, as a member of Marika Kotopouli's troupe, in an Athens production of Henry Bataille's \"The Naked Woman\". In 1931, she joined Aimilios Veakis' troupe along with Alexis Minotis, where she translated and appeared in the first of Eugene O'Neill's plays to be staged in Greece, \"Desire Under the Elms\". She also appeared in Anton Chekhov's \"Uncle Vanya\" and August Strindberg's \"The Father\".\nIn 1932, Paxinou was among the actors who inaugurated the recently re-founded National Theatre of Greece, where she worked until 1940. During her stay in the National Theatre, she distinguished herself on Greek stage starring in major plays, such as Sophocles' \"Electra\", Henrik Ibsen's \"Ghosts\" and William Shakespeare's \"Hamlet\", which were also performed in London, Frankfurt and Berlin.\nWhen World War II began, Paxinou was performing in London. Unable to return to Greece, she emigrated in May 1941 to the United States, where she had earlier appeared in 1931, performing Clytemnestra in a modern Greek version of \"Electra\".\nShe was selected to play the role of Pilar in the film \"For Whom the Bell Tolls\" (1943), for which she won an Oscar and a Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actress - Motion Picture. She made one British film, \"Uncle Silas\" (1947), which features Jean Simmons in the main female role and worked in Italy for 20th Century Fox, playing the mother of Tyrone Power's character in \"Prince of Foxes\" (1949). Katina Paxinou also played the role of Sophie, in the film \"Mr. Arkadin\", (1955), directed and written by Orson Welles in which he played Arkadin, the main character. After this film, Paxinou worked for a Hollywood studio only once more, again playing a gypsy woman in the religious epic \"The Miracle\" (1959).\nIn 1950, Paxinou resumed her stage career. In her native Greece, she formed the Royal Theatre of Athens with Alexis Minotis, her principal director and husband since 1940.\nPaxinou made several appearances on the Broadway stage and television as well. She played the lead in Ibsen's \"Hedda Gabler\" for 12 performances at New York City's Longacre Theatre, opening on 28 June 1942. She also played the principal role in the first production in English of Federico Garcia Lorca's \"The House of Bernarda Alba\", at the ANTA Playhouse in New York in 1951, and a BBC television production of Lorca's \"Blood Wedding\" (\"Bodas de sangre\"), broadcast on 2 June 1959.\nDeath.\nPaxinou died after a long battle with cancer in Athens on 22 February 1973 at the age of 72.

He became known as the \"Butcher of Lyon\" for having personally tortured prisoners\u2014primarily Jews and members of the French Resistance\u2014as the head of the Gestapo in Lyon. After the war, United States intelligence services employed him for his anti-communist efforts and aided his escape to Bolivia, where he advised the dictatorial regime on how to repress opposition through torture. In 1983, the United States apologised to France for the U.S. Counterintelligence Corps helping him escape to Bolivia, aiding Barbie's escape from an outstanding arrest warrant.\nIn 1972, it was discovered he was in Bolivia. While in Bolivia, the West German Intelligence Service recruited him. Barbie is suspected of having had a role in the Bolivian coup d'\u00e9tat orchestrated by Luis Garc\u00eda Meza in 1980. After the fall of the dictatorship, Barbie lost the protection of the government in La Paz. In 1983, he was arrested and extradited to France, where he was convicted of crimes against humanity and sentenced to life in prison. Although he had been sentenced to death in absentia twice earlier, in 1947 and 1954, capital punishment had been abolished in France in 1981. Barbie died of cancer in 1991, at age 77, in his Lyon prison cell.\nEarly life and education.\nNiklaus Barbie was born on 25 October 1913 in Godesberg, which is today part of Bonn. The Barbie family came from Merzig, in the Saar near the border with France. In 1914, his father, also named Niklaus, was conscripted to fight in the First World War. He was wounded in the neck at Verdun and captured by the French, and he never recovered his health. Until 1923, when he was 10, Klaus Barbie attended the local school where his father taught. Afterwards, he attended a boarding school in Trier. In 1925, the entire Barbie family moved to Trier.\nIn June 1933, Barbie's younger brother Kurt died, at the age of 18, of a chronic illness. Later that year, their father also died. The death of his father derailed plans for the 20-year-old Barbie to study theology. While unemployed, Barbie was conscripted into the Reich Labour Service. On 26 September 1935, aged 22, he joined the Schutzstaffel (SS) as member 272,284, and began working in the \"Sicherheitsdienst\" (SD), the SS security service, which acted as the intelligence-gathering arm of the Nazi Party. On 1 May 1937, he became member 4,583,085 of the Nazi Party.\nSecond World War.\nAfter the German conquest and occupation of the Netherlands, Barbie was assigned to Amsterdam. He had been pre-assigned to Adolf Eichmann's Amt (Department) IV/B-4. This department was responsible for the identification, roundup, and deportation of Dutch Communists, Jews and Freemasons. On 11 October 1940, Barbie arrested Hermannus van Tongeren, Grand Master of the Grand Orient of the Netherlands. In March 1941, van Tongeren was transported to Sachsenhausen concentration camp where, in freezing conditions, he died two weeks later. On 1 April, Barbie summoned van Tongeren's daughter, Charlotte, to SD headquarters and informed her that her father had died of an infection in both ears and had been cremated.\nIn 1942, he was sent to Dijon, in the Occupied Zone of France. In November of the same year, at the age of 29, he was assigned to Lyon as the head of the local Gestapo. He established his headquarters at the H\u00f4tel Terminus in Lyon, where he personally tortured adult and child prisoners. He became known as the \"Butcher of Lyon\". The daughter of a French Resistance leader based in Lyon said her father was beaten and his skin torn, and that his head was immersed in buckets of ammonia and cold water; he could not sit or stand and died three days later from burns to his skin. Other tortures included training German shepherd dogs to bite and using them to rape naked women.\nIt has been estimated that Barbie was directly responsible for the deportation of up to 14,000 Jews and resistance fighters, personally participating in roundups such as the Rue Sainte-Catherine Roundup which saw 84 people arrested in a single day. He arrested Jean Moulin, a high-ranking member of the French Resistance and his most prominent captive. In 1943, he was awarded the Iron Cross (First Class) by Adolf Hitler for his campaign against the French Resistance and the capture of Moulin.\nIn April 1944, Barbie ordered the deportation to Auschwitz of a group of 44 Jewish children from an orphanage at Izieu. He then rejoined the SiPo-SD of Lyon in its retreat to Bruy\u00e8res, where he led an anti-partisan attack in Rehaupal in September 1944.\nUS intelligence work in post-War Europe.\nIn 1947, Barbie was recruited as an agent for the 66th Detachment of the US Army Counterintelligence Corps (CIC) along with a Serbian agent of the Belgrade special police and SD, Radislav Gruji\u010di\u0107. The US used Barbie and other Nazi Party members to further anti-communist efforts in Europe. Specifically, they were interested in British interrogation techniques which Barbie had experienced firsthand, as well as the identities of former SS officers British intelligence agencies might be interested in recruiting. Later, the CIC housed him in a hotel in Memmingen; he reported on French intelligence activities in the French zone of occupied Germany because they suspected that the French had been infiltrated by the KGB and GPU.\nThe US Department of Justice report to the US Senate in 1983 opens with the summary paragraph:\nAs the investigation of Klaus Barbie has shown, officers of the United States government were directly responsible for protecting a person wanted by the government of France on criminal charges and in arranging his escape from the law. As a direct result of that action, Klaus Barbie did not stand trial in France in 1950; he spent 33 years as a free man and a fugitive from justice.\nThe French discovered that Barbie was in U.S. hands; having sentenced him to death in absentia for war crimes, they made a plea to John J. McCloy, US High Commissioner for Germany, to hand him over for execution, but McCloy refused. Instead, the CIC helped him flee to Bolivia assisted by \"ratlines\" organised by US intelligence services, as well as by Croatian Roman Catholic clergy, including Krunoslav Draganovi\u0107. The CIC asserted that Barbie knew too much about the network of German spies the CIC had planted in various European communist organisations. It was suspicious of communist influence within the Government of France, but their protection of Barbie may have been as much to avoid the embarrassment of having recruited him in the first place. Other authors have suggested that the anticommunist element of Italian fascism and the protection of the Vatican allowed Klaus Barbie and other Nazis to flee to Bolivia.\nIn 1965, Barbie was recruited by the West German foreign intelligence agency \"Bundesnachrichtendienst\" (BND), under the codename and the registration number V-43118. His initial monthly salary of 500 Deutsche Marks was transferred in May 1966 to an account of the Chartered Bank of London in San Francisco. During his time with the BND, Barbie made at least 35 reports to the BND headquarters in Pullach.\nBolivia.\nBarbie immigrated to Bolivia in 1951, where he lived well for 30 years in Cochabamba, under the alias Klaus Altmann. It was easier and less embarrassing for him to find employment there than in Europe; he enjoyed excellent relations with high-ranking Bolivian officials, including Bolivian dictators Hugo Banzer and Luis Garc\u00eda Meza. \"Altmann\" was known for his German nationalist and anti-communist stances. While engaged in arms-trade operations in Bolivia, he was appointed to the rank of lieutenant colonel within the Bolivian Armed Forces.\nBarbie collaborated with Ren\u00e9 Barrientos's regime, including teaching the general's private paramilitaries named \"Furmont\" how torture can best be used. The regime's political repression against leftist groups was helped by Barbie's knowledge about intelligence work, torture and interrogations. In 1972 under General Banzer (with whom Barbie collaborated even more openly), he assisted in illegal arrests, interrogations and murders of opposition and progressive groups. Journalists and activists who wrote or spoke about the regime's crimes against human rights were arrested and many fell victim to so-called \"disappearances\", the state's secret murders and abductions of leftists. Barbie actively participated in the regime's oppression of opponents.\nBarbie was strongly linked to the neo-Nazi paramilitary member \u00c1lvaro de Castro, who was his personally hired bodyguard and the two participated in criminal actions and businesses together. De Castro had connections with powerful drug barons and the illegal drug trade and, together with Barbie (under the name Altmann) and an Austrian company, sold weapons to the drug cartels. When De Castro was arrested he admitted in interviews that he had earlier worked for drug lords in the country. Other sources say Barbie most likely also had connections with these organizations. Initially, he worked for Roberto Su\u00e1rez G\u00f3mez who eventually introduced him to Colombian traffickers. Barbie met with Pablo Escobar and several other high ranking members of the Medell\u00edn cartel in the late 1970s, and agreed to arrange for security of Escobar's raw coca supply, from its cultivation until it reached processing plants in Colombia. In exchange, Escobar agreed to fund Barbie's anti-communist activities. De Castro continued to correspond with Barbie when Barbie was later under arrest. Their connections also provided intelligence information to U.S. authorities at the U.S. Embassy. A group called \"The Fianc\u00e9s of Death\", which included German Nazis and Fascists, had links to some of Barbie's actions in Bolivia. Barbie earlier also carried out a large arms purchase of tanks from Austria to the Bolivian army. These were then used in a coup d'\u00e9tat.\nAccording to various reports, after the emergence of Che Guevara in Bolivia in 1966, Barbie's anti-partisan skills were in demand again, and he worked for the Bolivian Interior Ministry with the rank of lieutenant as an instructor and adviser to the security forces. During an interview for the 2007 documentary film \"My Enemy's Enemy\", journalist Kai Hermann told the film-makers that Barbie constantly \"boasted that it was he who devised the strategy for murdering Che Guevara\".\nPeople who met Barbie during his time in Bolivia have said that he was a firm and fanatical believer in the Nazi ideology and an anti-Semite. Barbie and De Castro reportedly talked about the cases and searches for Josef Mengele and Adolf Eichmann, whom Barbie supported and wanted to assist in remaining on the run.\nIn 1973, Monika Ertl, daughter of Nazi propagandist Hans Ertl and a communist militant who assassinated Bolivian intelligence director Roberto Quintanilla, had planned to abduct Barbie and extradite him to France before being killed by Bolivian police.\nManhunt.\nBarbie was identified as being in Peru in 1971 by Serge and Beate Klarsfeld (Nazi hunters from France), who came across a secret document that revealed his alias. Barbie was living at Malecon 200, Chaclacayo () a property owned by SS-\"Sturmbannf\u00fchrer\" Friedrich Schwend. On 19 January 1972, this information was published in the French newspaper \"L'Aurore\", along with a photograph of Altmann which the Klarsfelds obtained from a German expatriate living in Lima, Peru. In Peru, Barbie provided security services to the junta of General Juan Velasco Alvarado following the military coup of 3 October 1968, including surveillance of the U.S. diplomatic mission led by John Irwin in March 1969.\nLed by Beate Klarsfeld, French journalist Ladislas de Hoyos and cameraman Christian van Ryswyck flew to La Paz in January 1972 in order to find and interview Barbie posing as his alias, Klaus Altmann. The interview took place on 3 February 1972 in the Department of the Interior building and the following day, in prison, where Barbie was placed under protection by the Bolivian authorities. In the videotape, and while the interview was conducted in Spanish, Ladislas de Hoyos steers away from the previously agreed upon questions by asking whether Barbie has ever been to Lyon in French, a language he is not supposed to understand under his fake identity, to which Barbie automatically responds in the negative in German. Ladislas de Hoyos gave him photos of Resistance members he had tortured, asking him if he recognized their faces, and, while he returned them in denial, his fingerprints unmistakably betrayed him. It was in this interview, later broadcast on French TV Channel Antenne 2, that he was recognized by French Resistance member Simone Lagrange, who had been tortured by Klaus Barbie in 1944.\nThe testimony of Italian insurgent Stefano Delle Chiaie before the Italian Parliamentary Commission on Terrorism suggests that Barbie took part in the Roberto Su\u00e1rez G\u00f3mez supported 1980 coup d'\u00e9tat \"cocaine coup\" of Luis Garc\u00eda Meza, when the regime forced its way to power in Bolivia in 1980.\nExtradition, trial and death.\nIn February 1983, the newly elected democratic regime of Hern\u00e1n Siles Zuazo arrested Barbie in La Paz on the pretext of his owing the government US$10,000 for goods he was supposed to have delivered but did not. A few days later, the government delivered him to France to stand trial.\nShortly after Barbie's extradition, evidence emerged that Barbie had worked for U.S. intelligence in Germany and that U.S. agents may have been instrumental in Barbie's flight to Bolivia to escape prosecution in France. Allan Ryan, Director of the Office of Special Investigations (OSI) of the U.S. Justice Department, recommended to U.S. Attorney General William French Smith that the matter be investigated. Following a lengthy investigation and a full report that was released to the public, Ryan concluded that \"officers of the United States government were directly responsible for protecting a person wanted by the government of France on criminal charges and in arranging his escape from the law.\"\nRyan felt that the initial decision by the U.S. government to use Barbie during Cold War counter-intelligence work, while reprehensible in light of his war crimes, might be defended on national security interest grounds. Doing so was no different from what other World War II victor nations were doing at the time; it appeared to have been done without any U.S. Counter Intelligence Corps (CIC) knowledge of Barbie's atrocities in Lyon. After those atrocities became well publicised, however, Ryan regarded it as indefensible for CIC personnel to lie to higher U.S. authorities and help Barbie escape Europe to Bolivia rather than honour an outstanding French warrant for his arrest. As a result of Ryan's report and personal recommendation, the U.S. government made a formal apology to France for enabling Barbie to escape French justice for 33 years.\nIn 1984, Barbie was indicted for crimes committed as Gestapo chief in Lyon between 1942 and 1944, chief among which was the Rue Sainte-Catherine Roundup. The jury trial started on 11 May 1987 in Lyon before the Rh\u00f4ne \"Cour d'Assises\". The head prosecutor was Pierre Truche. One witness at the trial was Michel Thomas, a Polish polyglot Jew, who had narrowly escaped arrest by Barbie in Lyon during World War II.\nBarbie's defence was funded by Swiss pro-Nazi financier Fran\u00e7ois Genoud and led by attorney Jacques Verg\u00e8s. Barbie was tried on 41 separate counts of crimes against humanity. The father of French Minister for Justice Robert Badinter had died in Sobibor after being deported from Lyon during Barbie's tenure.\nBarbie gave his name as Klaus Altmann, the name that he used while in Bolivia. He claimed that his extradition was technically illegal and asked to be excused from the trial and returned to his cell at Prison Saint-Paul. This was granted. He was brought back to court on 26 May 1987 to face some of his accusers, about whose testimony he had \"nothing to say\".\nBarbie's defence lawyer, Jacques Verg\u00e8s, had a reputation for attacking the French political system, particularly in the historic French colonial empire. His strategy was to use the trial to talk about war crimes committed by France since 1945. He got the prosecution to drop some of the charges against Barbie due to French legislation that had protected French citizens accused of the same crimes under the Vichy regime and in French Algeria. Verg\u00e8s argued that Barbie's actions were no worse than the supposedly ordinary actions of colonialists worldwide, and that his trial was tantamount to selective prosecution.\nBarbie's final statement, spoken in French, was: \"I never committed the roundup in Izieu. I fought the R\u00e9sistance, which I respect, with toughness but that was war, and the war is over.\"\nThe court rejected the defence's argument, and on 4 July 1987, Barbie was convicted and sentenced to life imprisonment. He died in prison in Lyon (of leukemia and prostate cancer) four years later, at the age of 77. His ashes were claimed by his daughter, who repatriated them to Austria.\nPersonal life.\nIn April 1939, Barbie became engaged to Regina Margaretta Willms, the 23-year-old daughter of a postal clerk; they had two children, a son named Klaus-Georg Altmann and a daughter named Ute Messner.\nIn 1983, Fran\u00e7oise Croizier, Klaus Barbie's French daughter-in-law, said in an interview that the CIA kidnapped Klaus-Georg in 1946 to make sure that his father carried out intelligence missions for the agency. Croizier met Klaus-Georg while both were students in Paris; they married in 1968, had three children and lived in Europe and Bolivia using the surname \"Altmann\". Croizier said that when she married, she did not know who her father-in-law was, but that she could guess the reasons for a German to settle in South America after the war. Klaus-Georg died in a hang-gliding accident in 1981.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Until the mid-19th century, the term \"Kashmir\" denoted only the Kashmir Valley between the Great Himalayas and the Pir Panjal Range. The term has since also come to encompass a larger area that formerly comprised the princely state of Jammu and Kashmir, and includes the Indian-administered territories of Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh, the Pakistani-administered territories of Azad Kashmir and Gilgit-Baltistan, and the Chinese-administered territories of Aksai Chin and the Trans-Karakoram Tract.\nIn 1819, the Sikh Empire, under Ranjit Singh, annexed the Kashmir valley. In 1846, after the Sikh defeat in the First Anglo-Sikh War, and upon the purchase of the region from the British under the Treaty of Amritsar, the Raja of Jammu, Gulab Singh, became the new ruler of Jammu and Kashmir. The rule of his descendants, under the \"paramountcy\" (or tutelage) of the British Crown, lasted until the Partition of India in 1947, when the former princely state of the British Indian Empire became a disputed territory, now administered by three countries: China, India, and Pakistan.\nEtymology.\nThe word \"Kashmir\" is thought to have been derived from Sanskrit and was referred to as \"\". A popular local etymology of \"Kashmir\" is that it is land desiccated from water.\nAn alternative etymology derives the name from the name of the Vedic sage Kashyapa who is believed to have settled people in this land. Accordingly, \"Kashmir\" would be derived from either \"kashyapa-mir\" (Kashyapa's Lake) or \"kashyapa-meru\" (Kashyapa's Mountain).\nThe word has been referenced to in a Hindu scripture mantra worshipping the Hindu goddess Sharada and is mentioned to have resided in the land of \"kashmira\", or which might have been a reference to the Sharada Peeth.\nThe Ancient Greeks called the region \"Kasperia\", which has been identified with \"Kaspapyros\" of Hecataeus of Miletus (apud Stephanus of Byzantium) and \"Kaspatyros\" of Herodotus (3.102, 4.44). Kashmir is also believed to be the country meant by Ptolemy's \"Kaspeiria\". The earliest text which directly mentions the name \"Kashmir\" is in \"Ashtadhyayi\" written by the Sanskrit grammarian P\u0101\u1e47ini during the 5th century BC. P\u0101\u1e47ini called the people of Kashmir \"Kashmirikas\". Some other early references to Kashmir can also be found in Mahabharata in Sabha Parva and in puranas like Matsya Purana, Vayu Purana, Padma Purana and Vishnu Purana and Vishnudharmottara Purana.\nHuientsang, the Buddhist scholar and Chinese traveller, called Kashmir \"kia-shi-milo\", while some other Chinese accounts referred to Kashmir as \"ki-pin\" (or Chipin or Jipin) and \"ache-pin\".\n\"Cashmeer\" is an archaic spelling of modern Kashmir, and in some countries it is still spelled this way. Kashmir is called \"Cachemire\" in French, \"Cachemira\" in Spanish, \"Caxemira\" in Portuguese, \"Caixmir\" in Catalan, \"Casmiria\" in Latin, \"Ca\u0219mir\" in Romanian, and \"Cashmir\" in Occitan.\nIn the Kashmiri language, Kashmir itself is known as \"Kasheer\".\nTerminology.\nThe Government of India and Indian sources refer to the territory under Pakistan control as \"Pakistan-occupied Kashmir\" (\"POK\"). The Government of Pakistan and Pakistani sources refer to the portion of Kashmir administered by India as \"Indian-occupied Kashmir\" (\"IOK\") or \"Indian-held Kashmir\" (IHK); The terms \"Pakistan-administered Kashmir\" and \"India-administered Kashmir\" are often used by neutral sources for the parts of the Kashmir region controlled by each country.\nHistory.\nIn the first half of the first millennium, the Kashmir region became an important centre of Hinduism and later of Buddhism. During the 7th\u201314th centuries, the region was ruled by a series of Hindu dynasties, and Kashmir Shaivism arose. In 1320, Rinchan Shah became the first Muslim ruler of Kashmir, inaugurating the Kashmir Sultanate. The region was part of the Mughal Empire from 1586 to 1751, and thereafter, until 1820, of the Afghan Durrani Empire.\nSikh rule.\nIn 1819, the Kashmir Valley passed from the control of the Durrani Empire of Afghanistan to the conquering armies of the Sikhs under Ranjit Singh of the Punjab, thus ending four centuries of Muslim rule under the Mughals and the Afghan regime. As the Kashmiris had suffered under the Afghans, they initially welcomed the new Sikh rulers. However, the Sikh governors turned out to be hard taskmasters, and Sikh rule was generally considered oppressive, protected perhaps by the remoteness of Kashmir from the capital of the Sikh Empire in Lahore. The Sikhs enacted a number of anti-Muslim laws, which included handing out death sentences for cow slaughter, closing down the Jamia Masjid in Srinagar, and banning the a\"dhan\", the public Muslim call to prayer. Kashmir had also now begun to attract European visitors, several of whom wrote of the abject poverty of the vast Muslim peasantry and of the exorbitant taxes under the Sikhs. High taxes, according to some contemporary accounts, had depopulated large tracts of the countryside, allowing only one-sixteenth of the cultivable land to be cultivated. Many Kashmiri peasants migrated to the plains of the Punjab. However, after a famine in 1832, the Sikhs reduced the land tax to half the produce of the land and also began to offer interest-free loans to farmers; Kashmir became the second highest revenue earner for the Sikh Empire. During this time Kashmir shawls became known worldwide, attracting many buyers, especially in the West.\nThe state of Jammu, which had been on the ascendant after the decline of the Mughal Empire, came under the sway of the Sikhs in 1770. Further in 1808, it was fully conquered by Maharaja Ranjit Singh. Gulab Singh, then a youngster in the House of Jammu, enrolled in the Sikh troops and, by distinguishing himself in campaigns, gradually rose in power and influence. In 1822, he was anointed as the Raja of Jammu. Along with his able general Zorawar Singh Kahluria, he conquered and subdued Rajouri (1821), Kishtwar (1821), Suru valley and Kargil (1835), Ladakh (1834\u20131840), and Baltistan (1840), thereby surrounding the Kashmir Valley. He became a wealthy and influential noble in the Sikh court.\nKashmir dispute.\nPrincely state.\nIn 1845, the First Anglo-Sikh War broke out. According to \"The Imperial Gazetteer of India:\"\nGulab Singh contrived to hold himself aloof till the battle of Sobraon (1846), when he appeared as a useful mediator and the trusted advisor of Sir Henry Lawrence. Two treaties were concluded. By the first the State of Lahore (i.e. West Punjab) handed over to the British, as equivalent for one crore indemnity, the hill countries between the rivers Beas and Indus; by the second the British made over to Gulab Singh for 75 lakhs all the hilly or mountainous country situated to the east of the Indus and the west of the Ravi i.e. the Vale of Kashmir.\nDrafted by a treaty and a bill of sale, and constituted between 1820 and 1858, the Princely State of Kashmir and Jammu (as it was first called) combined disparate regions, religions, and ethnicities: to the east, Ladakh was ethnically and culturally Tibetan and its inhabitants practised Buddhism; to the south, Jammu had a mixed population of Hindus, Muslims and Sikhs. In the heavily populated central Kashmir valley, the population was overwhelmingly Muslim\u2014mostly Sunni; however, there was also a small but influential Hindu minority, the brahmin Kashmiri Pandits. To the northeast, sparsely populated Baltistan had a population ethnically related to that of Ladakh, but which practised Shia Islam. To the north, also sparsely populated, the Gilgit Agency was an area of diverse, mostly \"Shia\" groups, and, to the west, the Punch was populated mostly by Muslims of a different ethnicity than that of the Kashmir valley. After the Indian Rebellion of 1857, in which Kashmir sided with the British, and the subsequent assumption of direct rule by Great Britain, the princely state of Kashmir came under the suzerainty of the British Crown.\nIn the British census of India of 1941, Kashmir registered a Muslim majority population of 77%, a Hindu population of 20% and a sparse population of Buddhists and Sikhs comprising the remaining 3%. That same year, Prem Nath Bazaz, a Kashmiri Pandit journalist, wrote: \"The poverty of the Muslim masses is appalling. ... Most are landless laborers, working as serfs for absentee [Hindu] landlords ... Almost the whole brunt of official corruption is borne by the Muslim masses.\" Under Hindu rule, Muslims faced hefty taxation and discrimination in the legal system and were forced into labour without any wages. Conditions in the princely state caused a significant migration of people from the Kashmir Valley to the Punjab of British India. For almost a century, until the census, a small Hindu elite had ruled over a vast and impoverished Muslim peasantry. Driven into docility by chronic indebtedness to landlords and moneylenders, having no education besides, nor awareness of rights, the Muslim peasants had no political representation until the 1930s.\n1947 and 1948.\nRanbir Singh's grandson Hari Singh, who had ascended the throne of Kashmir in 1925, was the reigning monarch in 1947 at the conclusion of British rule of the subcontinent and the subsequent partition of the British Indian Empire into the newly independent Dominion of India and the Dominion of Pakistan. According to Burton Stein's \"History of India\", Kashmir was neither as large nor as old an independent state as Hyderabad; it had been created rather off-handedly by the British after the first defeat of the Sikhs in 1846, as a reward to a former official who had sided with the British. The Himalayan kingdom was connected to India through a district of the Punjab, but its population was 77 percent Muslim, and it shared a boundary with Pakistan. Hence, it was anticipated that the maharaja would accede to Pakistan when the British paramountcy ended on 14\u201315 August. When he hesitated to do this, Pakistan launched a guerrilla onslaught meant to frighten its ruler into submission. Instead, the Maharaja appealed to Mountbatten for assistance, and the governor-general agreed on the condition that the ruler accede to India. Indian soldiers entered Kashmir and drove the Pakistani-sponsored irregulars from all but a small section of the state. The United Nations was then invited to mediate the quarrel. The UN mission insisted that the opinion of Kashmiris must be ascertained, while India insisted that no referendum could occur until all of the state had been cleared of irregulars.\nIn the last days of 1948, a ceasefire was agreed under UN auspices. However, since the plebiscite demanded by the UN was never conducted, relations between India and Pakistan soured, and eventually led to two more wars over Kashmir in 1965 and 1999.\nCurrent status and political divisions.\nIndia has control of about half the area of the former princely state of Jammu and Kashmir, which comprises Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh, while Pakistan controls a third of the region, divided into two provinces, Azad Kashmir and Gilgit-Baltistan. Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh are administered by India as union territories. They formed a single state until 5 August 2019, when the state was bifurcated, and its limited autonomy was revoked.\nAccording to \"Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica\":\nAlthough there was a clear Muslim majority in Kashmir before the 1947 partition, and its economic, cultural, and geographic contiguity with the Muslim-majority area of the Punjab (in Pakistan) could be convincingly demonstrated, the political developments during and after the partition resulted in a division of the region. Pakistan was left with territory that, although basically Muslim in character, was sparsely populated, relatively inaccessible, and economically underdeveloped. The largest Muslim group, situated in the Valley of Kashmir and estimated to number more than half the population of the entire region, lay in India-administered territory, with its former outlets via the Jhelum valley route blocked.\nThe eastern region of the former princely state of Kashmir is also involved in a boundary dispute that began in the late 19th century and continues into the 21st century. Although some boundary agreements were signed between Great Britain, Afghanistan, and Russia over the northern borders of Kashmir, China never accepted these agreements, and China's official position has not changed following the communist revolution of 1949 that established the People's Republic of China. By the mid-1950s, the Chinese army had entered the north-east portion of Ladakh.\nBy 1956\u201357, they had completed a military road through the Aksai Chin area to provide better communication between Xinjiang and western Tibet. India's belated discovery of this road led to border clashes between the two countries that culminated in the Sino-Indian War of October 1962.\nThe region is divided among three countries in a territorial dispute: Pakistan controls the northwest portion (Northern Areas and Azad Jammu Kashmir), India controls the central and southern portion (Jammu and Kashmir) and Ladakh, and the People's Republic of China controls the northeastern portion (Aksai Chin and the Trans-Karakoram Tract). India controls the majority of the Siachen Glacier area, including the Saltoro Ridge passes, while Pakistan controls the lower territory just southwest of the Saltoro Ridge. India controls of the disputed territory, Pakistan controls , and the People's Republic of China controls the remaining .\nJammu and Azad Kashmir lie south and west of the Pir Panjal range, and are under the control of India and Pakistan, respectively. These are populous regions. Gilgit-Baltistan, formerly known as the \"Northern Areas\", is a group of territories in the extreme north, bordered by the Karakoram, the western Himalayas, the Pamir, and the Hindu Kush ranges. With its administrative centre in the town of Gilgit, the Northern Areas cover an area of and have an estimated population approaching 1\u00a0million (10 lakhs).\nLadakh is between the Kunlun mountain range in the north and the main Great Himalayas to the south. Capital towns of the region are Leh and Kargil. It is under Indian administration and was part of the state of Jammu and Kashmir until 2019. It is one of the most sparsely populated regions in the area and is mainly inhabited by people of Indo-Aryan and Tibetan descent. Aksai Chin is a vast high-altitude desert of salt that reaches altitudes up to . Geographically part of the Tibetan Plateau, Aksai Chin is referred to as the Soda Plain. The region is almost uninhabited, with no permanent settlements.\nThough these regions are in practice administered by their respective claimants, neither India nor Pakistan has formally recognised the accession of the areas claimed by the other. India claims those areas, including the area \"ceded\" to China by Pakistan in the Trans-Karakoram Tract in 1963, are a part of its territory, while Pakistan claims the entire region, excluding Aksai Chin and Trans-Karakoram Tract. The two countries have fought several declared wars over the territory. The Indo-Pakistani War of 1947 established the rough boundaries of today, with Pakistan holding roughly one-third of Kashmir, and India one-half, with a dividing line of control established by the United Nations. The Indo-Pakistani War of 1965 resulted in a stalemate and a UN-negotiated ceasefire.\nGeography.\nThe Kashmir region lies between latitudes 32\u00b0 and 36\u00b0 N, and longitudes 74\u00b0 and 80\u00b0 E. It has an area of . It is bordered to the north and east by China (Xinjiang and Tibet), to the northwest by Afghanistan (Wakhan Corridor), to the west by Pakistan (Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Punjab) and to the south by India (Himachal Pradesh and Punjab).\nThe topography of Kashmir is mostly mountainous. It is traversed mainly by the Western Himalayas. The Himalayas terminate in the western boundary of Kashmir at Nanga Parbat. Kashmir is traversed by three rivers, namely the Indus, the Jhelum, and the Chenab. These river basins divide the region into three valleys separated by high mountain ranges. The Indus valley forms the north and north-eastern portion of the region, which includes bare and desolate areas of Baltistan and Ladakh. The upper portion of the Jhelum valley forms the proper Vale of Kashmir, surrounded by high mountain ranges. The Chenab valley forms the southern portion of the Kashmir region, with its denuded hills towards the south. It includes almost all of the Jammu region. High altitude lakes are frequent at high elevations. Lower down in the Vale of Kashmir, there are many freshwater lakes and large areas of swamplands, which include Wular Lake, Dal Lake, and Hokersar near Srinagar.\nTo the north and northeast, beyond the Great Himalayas, the region is traversed by the Karakoram mountains. To the northwest lies the Hindu Kush mountain range. The upper Indus River separates the Himalayas from the Karakoram. The Karakoram is the most heavily glaciated part of the world outside the polar regions. The Siachen Glacier at and the Biafo Glacier at rank as the world's second and third longest glaciers outside the polar regions. Karakoram is home to four eight-thousander mountain peaks, with K2, the second-highest peak in the world at .\nThe Indus River system forms the drainage basin of the Kashmir region. The river enters the region in Ladakh at its southeastern corner from the Tibetan Plateau, and flows northwest to run a course through the entire Ladakh and Gilgit-Baltistan. Almost all the rivers originating in this region are part of the Indus River system. After reaching the end of the Great Himalayan range, the Indus turns a corner and flows southwest into the Punjab plains. The Jhelum and Chenab rivers also follow a course roughly parallel to this, and join the Indus River in southern Punjab plains in Pakistan.\nThe geographical features of the Kashmir region differ considerably from one part to another. The lowest part of the region consists of the plains of Jammu at the southwestern corner, which continue into the plains of Punjab at an elevation of below 1000 feet. Mountains begin at 2000 feet, then raise to 3000\u20134000 feet in the \"Outer Hills\", a rugged country with ridges and long narrow valleys. Next within the tract lie the Middle Mountains, which are 8000\u201310,000 feet in height with ramifying valleys. Adjacent to these hills are the lofty Great Himalayan ranges (14000\u201315000 feet), which divide the drainage of the Chenab and Jehlum from that of the Indus. Beyond this range lies a wide tract of mountainous country of 17000\u201322000 feet in Ladakh and Baltistan.\nClimate.\nKashmir has a different climate for every region owing to the significant variation in altitude. The temperatures range from the subtropical heat of the Punjab summer to the intensity of the cold, which keeps the perpetual snow on the mountains. Jammu Division, excluding the upper parts of the Chenab Valley, features a humid subtropical climate. The Vale of Kashmir has a moderate climate. The Astore Valley and some parts of Gilgit-Baltistan feature a semi-Tibetan climate. While the other parts of Gilgit-Baltistan and Ladakh have a Tibetan climate, which is considered an almost rainless climate.\nThe southwestern Kashmir, which includes much of the Jammu province and Muzaffarabad, falls within the reach of the Indian monsoon. The Pir Panjal Range acts as an effective barrier and blocks these monsoon tracts from reaching the main Kashmir Valley and the Himalayan slopes. These areas of the region receive much of their precipitation from the wind currents of the Arabian Sea. The Himalayan slope and the Pir Panjal witness greatest snow melting from March until June. These variations in snow melt and rainfall have led to destructive inundations of the main valley. One instance of such Kashmir flood of a larger proportion is recorded in the 12th-century book \"Rajatarangini\". A single cloudburst in July 1935 caused the upper Jhelum river level to rise 11 feet. The 2014 Kashmir floods inundated the Kashmir city of Srinagar and submerged hundreds of other villages.\nFlora and fauna.\nKashmir has a recorded forest area of along with some national parks and reserves. The forests vary according to the climatic conditions and the altitude. Kashmir forests range from the subtropical deciduous forests in the foothills of Jammu and Muzaffarabad, to the temperate forests throughout the Vale of Kashmir and to the alpine grasslands and high altitude meadows in Gilgit-Baltistan and Ladakh.\nThe Kashmir region has four well-defined zones of vegetation in the tree growth, due to the elevation difference. The subtropical forests up to 1500 m are known as the Phulai (\"Acacia modesta\") and Olive (Olea cuspid ata) Zone. There occur semi-deciduous species of \"Shorea robusta\", \"Senegalia catechu\", \"Dalbergia sissoo\", \"Albizia lebbeck\", \"Garuga pinnata\", \"Terminalia bellirica\", and \"Tilia tomentosa,\" as well as \"Pinus roxburghii\" are found at higher elevations. The temperate zone between (1,500\u20133,500 m) is referred as the Chir Pine (Finns longifolia). This zone is dominated by oaks (\"Quercus\" spp.) and \"Rhododendron\" spp. The Blue Pine (Finns excelsa) Zone alongside \"Cedrus deodara\", \"Abies pindrow\", and \"Picea smithiana\" occurs at elevations between 2,800 and 3,500 m. The Birch (Betula utilis) Zone has Herbaceous genera of Anemone, Geranium, Iris, Lloydia, Potentilla, and Primula interspersed with dry dwarf alpine scrubs of Berberis, Cotoneaster, Juniperus, and Rhododendron, which are prevalent in alpine grasslands at 3,500 m and above.\nKashmir is often referred to as a beauty spot for the medicinal and herbaceous flora in the Himalayas. There are hundreds of different species of wild flowers recorded in the alpine meadows of the region. The botanical garden and the tulip gardens of Srinagar, built in the Zabarwans, grow 300 breeds of flora and 60 varieties of tulips, respectively. The latter is considered Asia's largest Tulip Garden.\nThe Kashmir region is home to several rare animal species, many of which are protected by sanctuaries and reserves. The Dachigam National Park in the Valley is home to the last viable population of Kashmir stag \"(Hangul)\" and the largest population of black bear in Asia. In Gilgit-Baltistan, the Deosai National Park is designated to protect the largest population of Himalayan brown bears in the western Himalayas. Snow leopards are found in high density in the Hemis National Park in Ladakh. The region is home to musk deer, markhor, leopard cat, jungle cat, red fox, jackal, Himalayan wolf, serow, Himalayan yellow-throated marten, long-tailed marmot, Indian crested porcupine, Himalayan mouse-hare, langur, and Himalayan weasel. At least 711 bird species are recorded in the valley alone with 31 classified as globally threatened species.\nDemographics.\nColonial era.\nIn the 1901 Census of the British Indian Empire, the population of the princely state of Kashmir and Jammu was 2,905,578. Of these, 2,154,695 (74.16%) were Muslims, 689,073 (23.72%) Hindus, 25,828 (0.89%) Sikhs, and 35,047 (1.21%) Buddhists (implying 935 (0.032%) others).\nThe Hindus resided mostly in Jammu, where they constituted a little less than 60% of the population. In the Kashmir Valley, the Hindus represented \"524 in every 10,000 of the population (i.e.\",\" 5.24%), and in the frontier \"wazarats\" of Ladhakh and Gilgit, only 94 out of every 10,000 persons (0.94%).\" In the 1901 Census, the total population of the Kashmir Valley was recorded at 1,157,394, with the Muslim population standing at 1,083,766, representing 93.6% of the total population, and the Hindu population 60,641. Among the Hindus of Jammu province, who numbered 626,177 (or 90.87% of the Hindu population of the princely state), the most important castes recorded in the census were \"Brahmans (186,000), the Rajputs (167,000), the Khattris (48,000) and the Thakkars (93,000).\"\nIn the 1911 Census of the British Indian Empire, the total population of Kashmir and Jammu had increased to 3,158,126. Of these, 2,398,320 (75.94%) were Muslims, 696,830 (22.06%) were Hindus, 31,658 (1%) were Sikhs, and 36,512 (1.16%) were Buddhists. In the last census of British India in 1941, the total population of Kashmir and Jammu (which, as a result of the Second World War, was estimated from the 1931 census) was 3,945,000. Of these, the total Muslim population was 2,997,000 (75.97%), the Hindu population was 808,000 (20.48%), and the Sikh population was 55,000 (1.39%).\nThe Kashmiri Pandits, the only Hindus of the Kashmir valley, who had stably constituted approximately 4 to 5% of the population of the valley during Dogra rule (1846\u20131947), and 20% of whom had left the Kashmir valley to other parts of India in the 1950s, underwent a complete exodus in the 1990s due to the Kashmir insurgency. According to numerous authors, approximately 100,000 of the total Kashmiri Pandit population of 140,000 left the valley during that decade. Other authors have suggested a higher figure for the exodus, ranging from the entire population of over 150 thousand, to 190 thousand of a total Pandit population of 200 thousand (200,000), to a number as high as 300 thousand (300,000).\nModern era.\nPeople in Jammu speak Hindi, Punjabi and Dogri, the Kashmir Valley people speak Kashmiri, and people in the sparsely inhabited Ladakh speak Tibetan and Balti.\nThe population of India-administered union territories of Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh combined is 12,541,302; that of Pakistan-administered territory of Azad Kashmir is 4,045,366; and that of Gilgit-Baltistan is 1,492,924.\nEconomy.\nKashmir's economy is centred around agriculture. Traditionally the staple crop of the valley was rice, which formed the chief food of the people. In addition, Indian corn, wheat, barley and oats were also grown. Given its temperate climate, it is suited for crops like asparagus, artichoke, seakale, broad beans, scarletrunners, beetroot, cauliflower and cabbage. Fruit trees are common in the valley, and the cultivated orchards yield pears, apples, peaches, and cherries. The chief trees are deodar, firs and pines, chinar or plane, maple, birch and walnut, apple, cherry.\nHistorically, Kashmir became known worldwide when Cashmere wool was exported to other regions and nations (exports have ceased due to decreased abundance of the cashmere goat and increased competition from China). Kashmiris are well adept at knitting and making Pashmina shawls, silk carpets, rugs, kurtas, and pottery. Saffron, too, is grown in Kashmir. Srinagar is known for its silver-work, papier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9, wood-carving, and the weaving of silk. The economy was badly damaged by the 2005 Kashmir earthquake which, as of 8 October 2005, resulted in over 70,000 deaths in the Pakistan-administered territory of Azad Kashmir and around 1,500 deaths in the India-administered territory of Jammu and Kashmir.\nTransport.\nTransport is predominantly by air or road vehicles in the region. Kashmir has a long modern railway line that started in October 2009, and was last extended in 2013 and connects Baramulla, in the western part of Kashmir, to Srinagar and Banihal. It is expected to link Kashmir to the rest of India after the construction of the railway line from Katra to Banihal is completed.\nIn culture.\nIrish poet Thomas Moore's 1817 romantic poem \"Lalla Rookh\" is credited with having made Kashmir (spelt \"Cashmere\" in the poem) \"a household term in Anglophone societies\", conveying the idea that it was a kind of paradise.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography.\nGeneral history.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nKashmir history.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nHistorical sources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "17339", "revid": "7903804", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=17339", "title": "Kendall Square Research", "text": "Former American manufacturer of supercomputers\nKendall Square Research (KSR) was a supercomputer company headquartered originally in Kendall Square in Cambridge, Massachusetts in 1986, near Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). It was co-founded by Steven Frank and Henry Burkhardt III, who had formerly helped found Data General and Encore Computer and was one of the original team that designed the PDP-8. KSR produced two models of supercomputer, the KSR1 and KSR2. It went bankrupt in 1994.\nTechnology.\nThe KSR systems ran a specially customized version of the OSF/1 operating system, a Unix variant, with programs compiled by a KSR-specific port of the Green Hills Software C and FORTRAN compilers. The architecture was shared memory implemented as a cache-only memory architecture or \"COMA\". Being all cache, memory dynamically migrated and replicated in a coherent manner based on the access pattern of individual processors. The processors were arranged in a hierarchy of rings, and the operating system mediated process migration and device access. Instruction decode was hardwired, and pipelining was used. Each KSR1 processor was a custom 64-bit reduced instruction set computing (RISC) CPU clocked at 20\u00a0MHz and capable of a peak output of 20 million instructions per second (MIPS) and 40 million floating-point operations per second (MFLOPS). Up to 1088 of these processors could be arranged in a single system, with a minimum of eight. The KSR2 doubled the clock rate to 40\u00a0MHz and supported over 5000 processors. The KSR-1 chipset was fabricated by Sharp Corporation while the KSR-2 chipset was built by Hewlett-Packard.\nSoftware.\nBesides the traditional scientific applications, KSR with Oracle Corporation, addressed the massively parallel database market for commercial applications. The KSR-1 and -2 supported Micro Focus COBOL and C/C++ programming languages, and the Oracle database and the MATISSE OODBMS from ADB, Inc. Their own product, the KSR Query Decomposer, complemented the functions of the Oracle product for SQL uses. The TUXEDO transaction monitor for OLTP was also provided. The KAP program (Kuck &amp; Associate Preprocessor) provided for pre-processing for source code analysis and parallelization. The runtime environment was termed PRESTO, and was a POSIX compliant multithreading manager.\nHardware.\nThe KSR-1 processor was implemented as a four-chip set in 1.2 micrometer complementary metal\u2013oxide\u2013semiconductor (CMOS). These chips were: the cell execution unit, the floating point unit, the arithmetic logic unit, and the external I/O unit (XIO). The CEU handled instruction fetch (two per clock), and all operations involving memory, such as loads and stores. 40-bit addresses were used, going to full 64-bit addresses later. The integer unit had 32, 64-bit-wide registers. The floating point unit is discussed below. The XIO had the capacity of 30 MB/s throughput to I/O devices. It included 64 control and data registers.\nThe KSR processor was a 2-wide VLIW, with instructions of 6 types: memory reference (load and store), execute, control flow, memory control, I/O, and inserted. Execute instructions included arithmetic, logical, and type conversion. They were usually triadic register in format. Control flow refers to branches and jumps. Branch instructions were two cycles. The programmer (or compiler) could implicitly control the \"quashing\" behavior of the subsequent two instructions that would be initiated during the branch. The choices were: always retain the results, retain results if branch test is true, or retain results if branch test is false. Memory control provided synchronization primitives. I/O instructions were provided. Inserted instructions were forced into a flow by a coprocessor. Inserted load and store were used for direct memory access (DMA) transfers. Inserted memory instructions were used to maintain cache coherency. New coprocessors could be interfaced with the inserted instruction mechanism. IEEE standard floating point arithmetic was supported. Sixty-four 64-bit wide registers were included.\nThe following example of KSR assembly performs an indirect procedure call to an address held in the procedure's constant block, saving the return address in register codice_1. It also saves the frame pointer, loads integer register zero with the value 3, and increments integer register 31 without changing the condition codes. Most instructions have a delay slot of 2 cycles and the delay slots are not interlocked, so must be scheduled explicitly, else the resulting hazard means wrong values are sometimes loaded.\nIn the KSR design, all of the memory was treated as cache. The design called for no \"home\" location- to reduce storage overheads and to software transparently, dynamically migrate/replicate memory based on where it was utilized; a Harvard architecture, separate bus for instructions and memory was used. Each node board contained 256 KB of I-cache and D-cache, essentially primary cache. At each node was 32 MB of memory for main cache. The system level architecture was shared virtual memory, which was physically distributed in the machine. The programmer or application only saw one contiguous address space, which was spanned by a 40-bit address. Traffic between nodes traveled at up to 4 gigabytes per second. The 32 megabytes per node, in aggregate, formed the physical memory of the machine.\nSpecialized input/output processors could be used in the system, providing scalable I/O. A 1088 node KSR1 could have 510 I/O channels with an aggregate in excess of 15 GB/s. Interfaces such as Ethernet, FDDI, and HIPPI were supported.\nHistory.\nAs the company scaled up quickly to enter production, they moved in the late 1980s to 170 Tracer Lane, Waltham, Massachusetts.\nKSR refocused its efforts from the scientific to the commercial marketplace, with emphasis on parallel relational databases and OLTP operations. It then got out of the hardware business, but continued to market some of its data warehousing and analysis software products.\nThe first KSR1 system was installed in 1991. With new processor hardware, new memory hardware and a novel memory architecture, a new compiler port, a new port of a relatively new operating system, and exposed memory hazards, early systems were noted for frequent system crashes. KSR called their cache-only memory architecture (COMA) by the trade name \"Allcache\"; reliability problems with early systems earned it the nickname \"Allcrash\", although memory was not necessarily the root cause of crashes. A few KSR1 models were sold, and as the KSR2 was being rolled out, the company collapsed amid accounting irregularities involving the overstatement of revenue.\nKSR used a proprietary processor because 64-bit processors were not commercially available. However, this put the small company in the difficult position of doing both processor design and system design. The KSR processors were introduced in 1991 at 20\u00a0MHz and 40 MFlops. At that time, the 32-bit Intel 80486 ran at 50\u00a0MHz and 50 MFlops. When the 64-bit DEC Alpha was introduced in 1992, it ran at up to 192\u00a0MHz and 192 MFlops, while the 1992 KSR2 ran at 40\u00a0MHz and 80 MFlops.\nOne customer of the KSR2, the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, a United States Department of Energy facility, purchased an enormous number of spare parts, and kept their machines running for years after the demise of KSR.\nKSR, along with many of its competitors (see below), went bankrupt during the collapse of the supercomputer market in the early 1990s. KSR went out of business in February 1994, when their stock was delisted from the stock exchange.\nIn April of 1996, the SEC filed a complaint against the company and several officers (Burkhardt III, the CEO and President; Peter Appleton Jones, the highest-ranked sales executive; and Karl G Wassman III, the CFO and CAO) for issuing materially false and misleading financial statements for six quarters in 1992 and 1993. These individuals and Thomas J MacCormack, director of contracts administration, were also accused of selling KSR stock while in possession of material nonpublic information. While no one admitted or denied wrongdoing, all individuals settled. All were ordered to pay disgorgements representing losses avoided as well as fines and interest accrued. Burkhardt paid some $1.1 million; MacCormack over $31,000. Though Wassman was ordered to pay in excess of $200,000, and Appleton Jones in excess of $300,000, they had spent their illicit gains in the meanwhile and all fines but $40,000 each were waived \"on demonstrated inability to pay a greater amount.\"\nCompetition.\nKSR's competitors included MasPar Computer Corporation, Thinking Machines, Meiko Scientific, and various old-line (and still surviving) companies like IBM and Intel.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It is located two miles southwest of Glenrothes. It has a population of around \n (2020)\nThe civil parish has a population of 22,543 (in 2011).\nHistory.\nThe village of Kinglassie (properly pronounced Kin-glassie, but locals have said King-lassie for decades) lies to the north of the Lochty Burn, southwest of Glenrothes in Fife, and two miles southeast of Perth and Kinross district. \nThe name of the village derives from Scottish Gaelic, although the exact meaning is obscure. The name was first recorded as \"Kilglassin\" in 1127. The first element, kil, is from the Gaelic, \"cill\", meaning monk's cell or church, but was changed to kin or \"ceann\", meaning head or end, by the 13th century. The element 'glassie' may refer to the Irish saint Glaisne, or may be glasin, meaning the place of the burn. Taken together this gives \"St Glaisne's Church\" or \"Church of the Burn\" as possible meanings.\nLittle of antiquity remains, except for the Dogton Stone, with its Celtic cross, situated in a field about a mile (1.5\u00a0km) to the south. For many years, Kinglassie was a weaving village, but in the 19th and 20th centuries it developed as a mining town.\nFrom a very early period through to the Reformation, Scotland was dotted over with certain divisions of lands known as \"Schyres.\" Thus, in the immediate neighbourhood of Kinross were \"Kynros-Schyre\", \"Portmocke-Schyre\", \"Kinglassy-Schyre\", \"Muchard-Schyre\", and \"Doloure-Schyre\". These Schyres must not be confused with the shire of the present day; they were simply divisions of land, similar in extent to an average modern parish.\nKinglassie has a primary school, Mitchell Hall (1896) and the Miners' Welfare Institute (est. 1931). Fife Airport lies about a mile (1.5\u00a0km) to the north and, on a hill overlooking the farm of Redwells, stands Blythe's Folly, a tower built in 1812 by an eccentric Leith ship owner. Kinglassie's development during the late 19th and early 20th centuries was marked by its rapid expansion to house mine workers. Many mine workers perished or were injured during the life of the mine. The mine was plagued by water flooding problems. The Kinglassie Pit started in 1908 and closed in 1967. The Westfield open cast coal mine lies to the west of the village and is still regarded as the biggest man-made hole in Europe by local people.\nGlastian of Kinglassie B (AC) (also known as Glastian of MacGlastian) was born in Fife, Scotland. He died at Kinglassie (Kinglace), Scotland, in 830. As bishop of Fife, Saint Glastian mediated in the bloody civil war between the Picts and the Scots. When the Picts were subjugated, Glastian did much to alleviate their lot. He is the patron saint of Kinglassie in Fife and is venerated in Kyntire (Benedictines, Husenbeth).\nSchool.\nKinglassie Primary School has a roll of approximately 270 pupils. The school was built to designs by the architect George Charles Campbell in 1912. It has a butterfly type plan consisting of two single storey rendered wings either side of a hexagon shaped hall. The central portion of the fa\u00e7ade is two storeys high and of red sandstone, with generous steps leading to a central formal entrance. It is a category B listed building.\nThe Pupil Council represents pupils in the school. The eco-committee consists of pupils, staff, parents, and members of the wider community, and is proactive in promoting conservation initiatives throughout the school. A parent council represents the parent body and raises funds for various initiatives. In addition, children are supported in class by a growing number of parent helpers and the school is well-supported by parents generally.\nLocal landmarks.\nBlythe's Tower, built in 1812, is a four-storey square tower, high, built of rubble with ashlar string courses and a crenellated parapet. It is a category B listed building. The tower's interior was formerly floored to afford access to an observation platform. The tower was built by a linen merchant to view ships as they entered the Forth, affording him the opportunity to procure the best goods at port. During World War II, the tower was used as a look out tower by the home guard.\nThe Dogton Stone, lies in a field to the south of Kinglassie at Grid reference \u2013 NT 236 968. The stone is a fragment of a free standing cross erected by the Picts, it probably dates from the 9th Century. The lower portion of the stone is all that remains of the cross and badly eroded decoration including a figure of an armed horseman above two beasts can be discerned. No one is certain why the stone was erected at this spot. It is a scheduled monument.\nThe Mitchell Hall, built in 1896, was donated to the community by Alexander Mitchell. Mitchell also donated the first Parish Church organ. The Mitchell Hall is used by local community groups and is an asset to the wider Fife community.\nSee also.\nOther villages on peripheries of Glenrothes:\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The town of Kalat is the headquarter of Kalat District and was also known in the past by the historical names Kalat-e-Baloch and Kalat-e-Sewa.\nQalat, formerly Kalat, is located roughly in the center of the Balochistan province, \u200c\u200cand in the past, the capital of Balochistan (in Kalat State). The Khan of Kalat is presently a ceremonial title held by Mir Suleman Dawood Jan, and the Pakistan government has made efforts to reconcile with him; his son, Prince Mohammed, who is next in line to be the Khan of Kalat, is pro-Pakistan.\nName.\nIn the Balochi language word Kalat is applied to a fort in general and the town became known as Kalat-e Baloch after the formation of the first Baloch rule over Kalat in the 15th century to distinguish it from Kal\u0101t-e Ghilzai in Afghanistan, and Kalat-e Sewa after its legendary founder. During the reign of Mir Nasir Khan, the royal castle Miri (Miri meaning, \"place of the Mir\"), which was a magnificent building in the center of the city and where the Khan resided, was known as Kalat-e-Nasseer, and appellation it at present retains.\nHistory.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;It has been known in earlier times as Kalat-i-Seva (from a legendary Hindu king) and Kalat-i Nichari which connects it with the Brahui Speaking tribes of Nichari, which is generally accepted as belonging to the oldest branch of the indigenous Brahois The town of Kalat is said to have been founded by the Hindu Sewa dynasty(Qalat-e Sewa) before the Brahuis rule in the 15th century.\nSix battles of Kikan (Six battles of Kikanan/Kizkanan): The legendary battles of Kinan parallel the battle of Thermopylae, where a small contingent of pastoral Jat warriors defeated a massive Muslim army. Despite facing a vastly superior Muslim military in numbers, training, and weaponry, Jats inflicted a crushing defeat on Arabic invaders, a humiliation so profound it was taken personally by the Muslim Caliph. Chach Nama reports that during the Arab Muslim invasion of Sindh, the mountain-dwelling brave and agile Jats of Kikan or Kikanan or Kizkanan, likely present-day Kalat, near Bolan Pass in Balochistan summarily defeated invading Arabic Muslim forces of Haras and killed Haras in 662 CE, only a small portion of Muslim forces returned to Umayyad Caliphate. The impact of Muslim defeat was so significant that for next 20 years each successive caliph made Kikan a special target for attack and sent 6 expeditions of which 5 \"failed miserably\" and \"failed to make any permanent impression\" in Sindh. \n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\"The Bolan Pass was protected by the brave Jats of Kikan or Kikanan.

The brahui speaking Khans of Qalat were dominant from the 17th century onwards until the arrival of the British in the 19th century. A treaty was signed in 1876 to make Qalat part of the British Empire.\nIn 1947, the Khan of Kalat reportedly acceded to the dominion of Pakistan. \nIn 1948, Qalat became part of Pakistan when the British withdrew. The last Khan of Qalat was formally removed from power in 1955, but the title is still claimed by his descendants.

The first four groups are sometimes regarded as branches of the hypothetical Niger\u2013Congo family, whereas Kadu is now widely seen as a branch of the proposed Nilo-Saharan family. The Kordofanian languages may be the oldest group of languages in the region.\nHistory.\nIn 1963, Joseph Greenberg added them to the Niger\u2013Congo family, creating his Niger\u2013Kordofanian proposal. The Kordofanian languages have not been shown to be more distantly related than other branches of Niger\u2013Congo, however, and they have not been shown to constitute a valid group. Today, the Kadu languages are excluded, and the others are usually included in Niger\u2013Congo proper.\nRoger Blench notes that the Talodi and Heiban families have the noun class systems characteristic of the Atlantic\u2013Congo core of Niger\u2013Congo but that the two Katla languages have no trace of ever having had such a system. However, the Kadu languages and some of the Rashad languages appear to have acquired noun classes as part of a Sprachbund rather than having inherited them. Blench concludes that Talodi and Heiban are core Niger\u2013Congo whereas Katla and Rashad form a peripheral branch along the lines of Mande.\nHeiban, Katloid, and Talodi are also grouped together in an automated computational analysis (ASJP 4) by M\u00fcller et al. (2013). However, since the analysis was automatically generated, the grouping could be either due to mutual lexical borrowing or genetic inheritance.\nTalodi\u2013Heiban languages.\nThe Heiban languages, also called Koalib or Koalib\u2013Moro, and the Talodi languages, also called Talodi\u2013Masakin, are part of the Talodi\u2013Heiban group.\nLafofa languages.\nLafofa (Tegem) was for a time classified with Talodi, but appears to be a separate branch of Niger\u2013Congo.\nRashad languages.\nThe number of Rashad languages, also called Tegali\u2013Tagoi, varies among descriptions, from two (Williamson &amp; Blench 2000), three (Ethnologue), to eight (Blench \"ms\").

The islands form part of the province of Shalim and the Hallaniyat Islands in the governorate of Dhofar.\nHistory.\nIn antiquity the islands were called the \"Zenobii\" or \"Zenobiou Islands\" (; \"\") or \"Doliche\" (). The islands were mentioned by several early writers including Ptolemy (vi. 7. \u00a7 47) who numbered them as seven small islands lying in Khuriya Muriya Bay (; ), towards the entrance of the \"Persian Gulf\" (most likely the modern Gulf of Aden). The Periplus of the Erythraean Sea, a periplus dated to between AD 40 and 70, thus mentioned the Khuriya Muriya Islands, then called \"Isles of Zenobios\":\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;After sailing along it over open water for about 2000 stades from the Isles of Zenobios, you come to the Isle of Sarapis, as it is called, about 120 stades offshore.\u2014\u200a\nModern history.\nIn 1854 the sultan of Muscat (later Muscat and Oman, now Oman) presented the islands to Queen Victoria as a gift and responsibility for the islands was granted to the Bombay government in British India. There was some concern at the time that the deed of cession was null since the sultan had no rights over the archipelago. The Red Sea and India Telegraph Company, formed in 1858, intended to use one of the islands as a base for a telegraph connection between Aden and Karachi but the project was abandoned in 1861 after sections of the cable failed. A group of Liverpool entrepreneurs were granted monopoly rights to harvest the abundant guano deposits, but after having met resistance from the local inhabitants who considered that resource theirs, and questions in the British parliament about the advisability of granting monopoly rights to anyone, the mining was abandoned after some 200,000 tons had been extracted between 1855 and 1860. During that period, the archipelago presented a busy scene, with up to 52 ships present on one occasion. As per a British intelligence report from 1883, fewer than 40 inhabitants lived on Al-Hallaniyah, the main island. The islanders lived in huts of unmortared stone with mat roofs, and at certain seasons they moved to caves. They lived on fish, shellfish and goat's milk, occasionally exchanging dried fish for dates and rice from passing ships. They fished entirely with hooks since they had neither boat nor nets.\nYemeni control.\nIn 1886, the islands were attached administratively to Aden. Due to their remoteness, the lack of anchorages and the fact that the inhabitants continued to consider themselves subjects of the Sultan of Muscat, the islands remained un-administered and, for decades, were only sporadically visited by British officials. While technically part of Aden Colony, the islands, because of their remoteness and inaccessibly, were left to the supervision of the British Resident in the Persian Gulf. As a British possession until 1967, they were administered by the Governor of Aden until 1953, then by the British High Commissioner until 1963, and finally by the British Chief Political Resident of the Persian Gulf (based in Bahrain). On 30 November 1967, Lord Caradon, the British Ambassador to the United Nations, announced that in accordance with the wishes of the local inhabitants, the islands would be returned to Muscat and Oman, despite criticism from President Qahtan Muhammad al-Shaabi that the islands should be transferred to the People's Republic of South Yemen. The boundary between the two countries was not formally settled until 1992 when it was agreed that the islands were on Oman's side of the line.\nImportant Bird Area.\nThe island group has been designated an Important Bird Area (IBA) by BirdLife International because it supports seabird breeding colonies of red-billed tropicbirds, tropical shearwaters, masked boobies, Socotra cormorants, sooty gulls, and bridled and greater crested terns. Other significant birds are resident mourning wheatears and visiting Jouanin's petrels.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Internationally, his films won the (Golden Palm Grand Prize) at Cannes Film Festival (out of three nominations) and the Crystal Globe at Karlovy Vary International Film Festival. As a director and screenwriter, he is considered one of the pioneers of Indian parallel or neo-realistic cinema.\nAs a director, he made Hindustani films.

He attended Hali Muslim High School, which was established by his maternal grandfather, Hali. He was instructed to read the Arabic text of the Quran and matriculated at the age of fifteen.30\nHe gained a Bachelor of Arts degree in English literature in 1933 and a Bachelor of Laws degree in 1935 from Aligarh Muslim University.\nIllness and death.\nAbbas suffered from a heart attack in the 60s, followed by another more serious heart attack, a paralytic stroke as well a on set accident injuring his legs, but he kept working till his death at the age of 72 on 1 June 1987.\nCareer.\nJournalism.\nAfter leaving university,K.A Abbas began his career as a journalist at the \"National Call\", a New Delhi-based newspaper. Later while studying law in 1934, started \"Aligarh Opinion\".\nHe joined \"The Bombay Chronicle\" in 1935 as a political correspondent and later, became a film critic for the newspaper.\nHe entered films as a part-time publicist for Bombay Talkies in 1936, a production house owned by Himanshu Rai and Devika Rani, to whom he sold his first screenplay \"Naya Sansar\" (1941).\nWhile at \"The Bombay Chronicle\" (1935\u20131947), he started a weekly column called 'Last Page', which he continued when he joined the Blitz magazine. \"The Last Page\", ('Azad Kalam' in the Urdu edition) became the longest-running political column in India's history (1935\u201387). A collection of these columns was later published as two books. He continued to write for The Blitz and Mirror until his last days.\nAbbas interviewed several renowned personalities in literary and non-literary fields, including the Russian Prime Minister Khrushchov, American President Roosevelt, Charlie Chaplin, Mao-Tse-Tung and Yuri Gagarin.\nCinema.\nMeanwhile, he had started writing scripts for other directors, for Chetan Anand and for V. Shantaram.\nIn 1945, he made his directorial debut with a film based on the Bengal famine of 1943, (\"Children of the Earth\"), for the Indian People's Theatre Association (IPTA). In 1951, he founded his own production company called Naya Sansar, which consistently produced films that were socially relevant including, \"Anhonee\", \"Munna\", \"Rahi\" (1953), based on a Mulk Raj Anand story, was on the plight of workers on tea plantations, the National Film Award winner, \"Shehar Aur Sapna\" (1964) and \"Saat Hindustani\" (1969), which won the Nargis Dutt Award for Best Feature Film on National Integration and is also remembered as Bollywood icon Amitabh Bachchan's debut film.\nHe wrote the story and screenplay for the controversial themed film in 1974 \"Call Girl\" directed by Vijay Kapoor, starring Vikram and Zaheera.\nHe went on to write scripts for \"Jagte Raho\" and prominent Raj Kapoor films including \"Awaara, Shri 420, Mera Naam Joker, Bobby\" and \"Henna\".\nLiterature.\nAbbas wrote 74 books in English, Hindi and Urdu and was considered the leading light of the Urdu short story.

The film depicted the contrast between the luxurious life of the rich in the four cities of Calcutta, Bombay, Madras and Delhi and that of the squalor and poverty of the poor. He approached the Central Board of Film Certification to obtain a 'U' (Unrestricted Public Exhibition) certificate. Abbas was, however, informed by the regional office of the Board that the film was not eligible to be granted a 'U' certificate, but was suitable for exhibition only for adults. His appeal to the revising committee of the Central Board of Film Certification led to the decision of the censors being upheld.\nKhwaja Ahmad Abbas further appealed to the Central Government but the government decided to grant the film a 'U' certificate provided certain scenes were cut. Following this, Abbas approached the Supreme Court of India by filing a writ petition under Article 19(1) of the Indian Constitution. He claimed that his fundamental right of free speech and expression was denied by the Central Government's refusal to grant the film a 'U' certificate. Abbas also challenged the constitutional validity of pre-censorship on films.\nHowever the Supreme Court of India upheld the constitutional validity of pre-censorship on films.\nAwards and honours.\nLiterary.\nHaryana State Robe of Honour for literary achievements in 1969, the Ghalib Award for his contribution to Urdu prose literature in 1983\nVorosky Literary Award of the Soviet Union in 1984, Urdu Akademi Delhi Special Award 1984, Maharashtra State Urdu Akademi Award in 1985 and the Soviet Award for his contribution to the cause of Indo-Soviet Friendship in 1985.\nFilmography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt; \nBooks.\nHe wrote 74 books in English, Urdu and Hindi, including:\n\"For detailed listing\" :\nBibliography.\nArticles on Khwaja Ahmad Abbas.\nV.

Three collections of her stories have been published.\nIt was while she worked as a laboratory technician in 1947 that she began writing science fiction. Strongly influenced by Ludwig von Bertalanffy's General Systems Theory, her fiction has often demonstrated foresight about scientific advances.\nShe died on September 1, 2019, at the age of 94.\nAwards.\nMacLean received a Nebula Award in 1971 for her novella \"The Missing Man\" (\"Analog\", March, 1971) and she was a Professional Guest of Honor at the first WisCon in 1977. She was honored in 2003 by the Science Fiction Writers of America as an SFWA Author Emeritus. In 2011, she received the Cordwainer Smith Rediscovery Award.\nCollections.\n\"The Diploids and Other Flights of Fancy\" (Avon, 1962), her first short story collection, includes \"The Diploids\" (a.k.a. \"Six Fingers\"), \"Feedback\", \"Pictures Don't Lie\", \"Incommunicado\", \"The Snow Ball Effect\", \"Defense Mechanism\" and \"And Be Merry\" (a.k.a. \"The Pyramid in the Desert\").\"Games\" also in this collection.\nHer second collection, \"The Trouble with You Earth People\" (Donning/Starblaze, 1980) contains \"The Trouble with You Earth People\", \"The Gambling Hell and the Sinful Girl\", \"Syndrome Johnny\", \"Trouble with Treaties\" (with Tom Condit), \"The Origin of the Species\", \"Collision Orbit\", \"The Fittest\", \"These Truths\", \"Contagion\", \"Brain Wipe\" and her Nebula Award-winning \"The Missing Man\".\n\"And Be Merry\" (Eat Drink and Be Merry for Tomorrow We Die) A lab biologist, female, takes advantage of her husband going off on an archeology trip, to use the privacy to experiment on herself for rejuvenation by a severe and dangerous method. Succeeding, she contemplates immortality, finding that safety from accidental death has become so valuable to her that she becomes a coward, cowering from all possible risk, seeing shelter in a hospital, and is only rescued from mindless panic by her husband finding her, realizing the source of her terror and rescuing her from immortality by claiming she has a slow growing tumor in an unreachable part of the body.\nFinding she has no chance of evading eventual death, she immediately loses her obsession with safety, becomes interested in biochemistry again, and invents a new theory. (New at the time.) Mutation from background radiation does not just strike the sperm and egg making chromosome changes in the embryo and mutated progeny, it also strikes the chromosomes in each cell of any living creature, damages and mutates them also, and produces cancer. This cannot be prevented. She called it \"somatic mutation\" and used the new concept of body deterioration by slow radiation damage (age) to underpin her rediscovered recklessness, and be happy.\nEven now most biotechs have not fully accepted the implication that every cell in the body can generate an entire copy of the person. But perhaps a copy will be changed and mutated for the worse by exposure to ambient radiation and other mutagens. Perhaps a cell needs to generate a placenta around it to develop into an entire body. Something like that is holding up the biochemists from successfully making copies of individuals from body or blood cells. Not for long! I wrote three more stories with novel genetic ideas before 1953. Some have not been followed up by scientists yet.\nIn the 1930s and 1940s, scientists and boys planning to be scientists read \"Astounding\" (\"Analog\") with close attention to the hottest most promising ideas and took them up as soon as they could get funded lab space. They did not openly express their gratitude to science fiction, because the funding depended on keeping claim to have originated the ideas they had put so much work into testing and verifying...\n\"I hastily looked around for a door to a lecture hall where I could sneak some listening time and get a line on current research, and be out of sight before the desk was reoccupied by the guardian of the gate...\nToo late, a man built like a fullback in a business suit was bearing down on me. \"I see you don't have your badge. May I have your name? I'll look it up in the registry...\"\n\"Katherine MacLean, I came in because I am interested in--\"\nHe interrupted. \"Katherine MacLean! Are you that Katherine MacLean?\" He gripped my hand and hung on. Who was that Katherine Maclean? Was I being mistaken for someone else?\n\"Are you the Katherine MacLean who wrote 'Incommunicado'?\"\nSpeechless with relief, I nodded. I would not be arrested or thrown out if they would accept me as a science fiction writer. He kept his grip on my hand and turned around and bellowed to his group of chatting friends, \"Guess who I've got here. The little woman who wrote 'Incommunicado'!\"\n...I had not been aware that my playing with communication ideas would attract the attention of prestigious Bell Telephone researchers. I had left radio and wavelength theory to my Dad as one of his hobbies and learned early that I could get a nasty shock from playing with his wiring. I could not account for their enthusiasm. I went back to the typewriter and lost myself in the story again.\nThe point is, that scientists not only read \"Astounding-Analog\", they were fans of the writers and understood all the Ideas, even the obscure Ideas that were merely hinted at.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He was at the forefront of the struggle for independence from British rule. Dissatisfied with Harry Nkumbula's leadership of the Northern Rhodesian African National Congress, he broke away and founded the Zambian African National Congress, later becoming the head of the socialist United National Independence Party (UNIP).\nKaunda was the first president of independent Zambia. In 1973, following tribal and inter-party violence, all political parties except UNIP were banned through an amendment of the constitution after the signing of the Choma Declaration. At the same time, Kaunda oversaw the acquisition of majority stakes in key foreign-owned companies. The 1973 oil crisis and a slump in export revenues put Zambia in a state of economic crisis. Unrest forced Kaunda to change the rules that had kept him in power. Multi-party elections took place in 1991, in which Frederick Chiluba, the leader of the Movement for Multi-Party Democracy, ousted Kaunda.\nHe was briefly stripped of Zambian citizenship in 1998, but the decision was overturned two years later in 2000.\nEarly life.\nKenneth Kaunda was born on 28 April 1924 at Lubwa Mission in Chinsali, then part of Northern Rhodesia, now Zambia, and was the youngest of eight children. His father, the Reverend David Kaunda, was an ordained Church of Scotland missionary and teacher, who had been born in Nyasaland (now Malawi) and had moved to Chinsali, to work at Lubwa Mission. His mother, Helen Nyirenda Kaunda, was also a teacher and was the first African woman to teach in colonial Northern Rhodesia. They were both teachers among the Bemba ethnic group which is located in northern Zambia. His father died when Kenneth was a child. This is where Kenneth Kaunda received his education until the early 1940s. He later on followed in his parents' footsteps and became a teacher; first in Northern Rhodesia but then in the middle of the 1940s he moved to Tanganyika Territory (now part of Tanzania). He also worked in Southern Rhodesia. He attended Munali Training Centre in Lusaka between 1941 and 1943. Early in his career, he read the writings of Mahatma Gandhi that he said: \"went straight to my heart.\"\nKaunda was a teacher at the Upper Primary School and Boarding Master at Lubwa and then Headmaster at Lubwa from 1943 to 1945. For a time, he worked at the Salisbury and Bindura Mine. In early 1948, he became a teacher in Mufulira for the United Missions to the Copperbelt (UMCB). He was then assistant at an African Welfare Centre and Boarding Master of a Mine School in Mufulira. In this period, he was leading a Pathfinder Scout Group and was Choirmaster at a Church of Central Africa congregation. He was also Vice-Secretary of the Nchanga Branch of Congress.\nIndependence struggle and presidency.\nIn 1949 Kaunda entered politics and became the founding member of the Northern Rhodesian African National Congress. On 11 November 1953 he moved to Lusaka to take up the post of Secretary General of the Africa National Congress (ANC), under the presidency of Harry Nkumbula. The combined efforts of Kaunda and Nkumbula failed to mobilise native African peoples against the European-dominated Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland. In 1955 Kaunda and Nkumbula were imprisoned for two months with hard labour for distributing subversive literature. The two leaders drifted apart as Nkumbula became increasingly influenced by white liberals and failing to defend indigenous Africans, Kaunda led a dissident group to Nkumbula that eventually broke with the ANC and founded his own party, the Zambian African National Congress (ZANC) in October 1958. ZANC was banned in March 1959 and Kaunda was sentenced to nine months' imprisonment, which he spent first in Lusaka, then in Salisbury.\nWhile Kaunda was in prison, Mainza Chona and other nationalists broke away from the ANC and, in October 1959, Chona became the first president of the United National Independence Party (UNIP), the successor to ZANC. However, Chona did not see himself as the party's main founder. When Kaunda was released from prison in January 1960 he was elected president of UNIP. In 1960 he visited Martin Luther King Jr. in Atlanta and afterwards, in July 1961, Kaunda organised a civil disobedience campaign in Northern Province, the so-called Cha-cha-cha campaign, which consisted largely of arson and obstructing significant roads. Kaunda subsequently ran as a UNIP candidate during the 1962 elections. This resulted in a UNIP\u2013ANC Coalition government, with Kaunda as Minister of Local Government and Social Welfare. In January 1964, UNIP won the next major elections, defeating their ANC rivals and securing Kaunda's position as prime minister. On 24 October 1964 he became the first president of an independent Zambia, appointing Reuben Kamanga as his vice-president.\nEducational policies.\nAt the time of its independence, Zambia's modernisation process was far from complete. The nation's educational system was one of the most poorly developed in all of Britain's former colonies, and it had just a hundred university graduates and no more than 6,000 indigenous inhabitants with two years or more of secondary education. Because of this, Zambia had to invest heavily in education at all levels. Kaunda instituted a policy where all children, irrespective of their parents' ability to pay, were given free exercise books, pens, and pencils. The parents' main responsibility was to buy uniforms, pay a token \"school fee\" and ensure that the children attended school. This approach meant that the best pupils were promoted to achieve their best results, all the way from primary school to university level. Not every child could go to secondary school, for example, but those who did were well educated.\nThe University of Zambia was opened in Lusaka in 1966, after Zambians all over the country had been encouraged to donate whatever they could afford towards its construction. Kaunda was appointed Chancellor and officiated at the first graduation ceremony in 1969. The main campus was situated on the Great East Road, while the medical campus was located at Ridgeway near the University Teaching Hospital. In 1979 another campus was established at the Zambia Institute of Technology in Kitwe. In 1988 the Kitwe campus was upgraded and renamed the Copperbelt University, offering business studies, industrial studies and environmental studies.\nOther tertiary-level institutions established during Kaunda's era were vocationally focused and fell under the aegis of the Department of Technical Education and Vocational Training. They include the Evelyn Hone College and the Natural Resources Development College (both in Lusaka), the Northern Technical College at Ndola, the Livingstone Trades Training Institute in Livingstone, and teacher-training colleges.\nEconomic policies.\nKaunda's newly independent government inherited a country with one of the most vibrant economies in sub-Saharan Africa, largely on account of its rich mineral deposits, albeit one that was largely under the control of foreign and multinational interests.\nFor example, the British South Africa Company (BSAC, founded by Cecil Rhodes) still retained commercial assets and mineral rights that it had acquired from a concession signed with the Litunga of Bulozi in 1890. Only by threatening to expropriate it on the eve of independence did Kaunda manage to get favourable concessions from the BSAC.\nHis ineptness at economic management blighted his country's development after independence. Despite having some of the finest farming land in Africa, Kaunda adopted the same socialist agricultural policies as Tanzania, with disastrous results.\nDeciding on a planned economy, Zambia instituted a programme of national development, under the direction of the National Commission for Development Planning, which instituted a \"Transitional Development Plan\" and the \"First National Development Plan\". The two operations brought major investment in the infrastructure and manufacturing sectors. In April 1968, Kaunda initiated the Mulungushi Reforms, which sought to bring Zambia's foreign-owned corporations under national control under the Industrial Development Corporation. Over the subsequent years, a number of mining corporations were nationalised, although the country's banks, such as Barclays and Standard Chartered, remained foreign-owned. The Zambian economy suffered a setback from 1973, when rising oil prices and falling copper prices combined to reduce the state's income from the nationalised mines. The country fell into debt with the International Monetary Fund (IMF), and the Third National Development Plan had to be abandoned as crisis management replaced long-term planning. His weak attempts at economic reforms in the 1980s hastened Zambia's decline. A number of negotiations with the IMF followed, and by 1990 Kaunda was forced into partial privatisation of the state-owned corporations. The country's economic woes ultimately contributed to his fall from power.\nOne-party state and \"African socialism\".\nIn 1964, shortly before independence, violence broke out between supporters of the Lumpa Church, led by Alice Lenshina. Kaunda temporarily banned the church and ordered Lumpa's arrest.\nFrom 1964 onwards, Kaunda's government developed authoritarian characteristics. Becoming increasingly intolerant of opposition, Kaunda banned all parties except UNIP following violence during the 1968 elections. However, in early 1972, he faced a new threat in the form of Simon Kapwepwe's decision to leave UNIP and found a rival party, the United Progressive Party, which Kaunda immediately attempted to suppress. Next, he appointed the Chona Commission, which was set up under the chairmanship of Mainza Chona in February 1972. Chona's task was to make recommendations for a new Zambian constitution which would effectively reduce the nation to a one-party state. The commission's terms of reference did not permit it to discuss the possible faults of Kaunda's decision, but instead to concentrate on the practical details of the move to a one-party state. Finally, Kaunda neutralised Nkumbula by getting him to join UNIP and accept the Choma Declaration on 27 June 1973. The new constitution was formally promulgated on 25 August of that year. At the first elections under the new system held that December, Kaunda was the sole candidate.\nAfter eliminating political opposition, Kenneth Kaunda established a personality cult and promoted a left nationalist-socialist ideology called Zambian Humanism. It combined mid-20th-century concepts of central planning and state control with values Kaunda described as traditional African principles, including mutual aid, trust, and community loyalty. The ideology has been criticized for showing similarities to fascism. Similar forms of African socialism were introduced in Ghana by Kwame Nkrumah (Consciencism) and in Tanzania by Julius Nyerere (Ujamaa). Kaunda wrote many books elaborating his ideology called \"Humanism in Zambia and a Guide to Its Implementation, Parts 1, 2 and 3\". Other works on the subject include Timothy Kandeke\u2019s \"Fundamentals of Zambian Humanism\", Rev. Fr. Cleve Dillion-Malone\u2019s \"Zambian Humanism, Religion and Social Morality\", and Justin B. Zulu\u2019s \"Zambian Humanism: Some Major Spiritual and Economic Challenges\". In 1980 Kaunda also published \"Kaunda on Violence\" (issued in the United States as \"The Riddle of Violence\").\nAs president of UNIP, and under the country's one-party state system, Kaunda was the only candidate for president of the republic in the general elections of 1978, 1983, and 1988, each time with official results showing over 80 per cent of voters approving his candidacy. Parliamentary elections were also controlled by Kaunda. In the 1978 UNIP elections, Kaunda amended the party's constitution to bring in rules that invalidated the challengers' nominations: Kapwepwe was told he could not stand because only people who had been members for five years could be nominated to the presidency (he had only rejoined UNIP three years before); Nkumbula and a third contender, businessman Robert Chiluwe, were outmanoeuvred by introducing a new rule that said each candidate needed the signatures of 200 delegates from each province to back their candidacy.\nForeign policy.\nDuring his early presidency Kaunda was an outspoken supporter of the anti-apartheid movement and opposed white minority rule in Southern Rhodesia. Kaunda supported the succession of Biafra when he recognized it as an independent nation on May 20, 1968. Although his nationalisation of the copper mining industry in the late 1960s and the volatility of international copper prices contributed to increased economic problems, matters were aggravated by his logistical support for the black nationalist movements in Ian Smith's Rhodesia, South West Africa, Angola, and Mozambique. Kaunda's administration later attempted to serve the role of a mediator between the entrenched white minority and colonial governments and the various guerrilla movements which were aimed at overthrowing these respective administrations. Beginning in the early 1970s, he began permitting the most prominent guerrilla organisations, such as the Rhodesian ZANU and the African National Congress, to use Zambia as a base for their operations. Former ANC president Oliver Tambo even spent a significant proportion of his 30-year exile living and working in Zambia. Joshua Nkomo, leader of ZAPU, also erected military encampments there, as did SWAPO and its military wing, the People's Liberation Army of Namibia.In the first twenty years of Kaunda's presidency, he and his advisors sought numerous times to acquire modern weapons from the United States. In a letter written to US president Lyndon B. Johnson in 1967, Kaunda inquired if the United States would provide him with long-range missile systems. This request for modern weapons even included missiles with nuclear warheads. All of his requests for modern weapons were refused by the United States. In 1980, Kaunda purchased sixteen MiG-21 jets from the Soviet Union, which ultimately provoked a reaction from the United States. Kaunda responded to the United States, stating that after numerous failed attempts to purchase weapons, buying from the Soviets was justified in his duty to protect his citizens and Zambian national security. His attempted purchase of modern American weapons may have been a political tactic to use fear to establish his one-party rule over Zambia.\nFrom April 1975, when he visited US president Gerald Ford at the White House in Washington, D.C., and delivered a powerful speech calling for the United States to play a more active and constructive role in southern Africa. Until approximately 1984, Kaunda was arguably the key African leader involved in international diplomacy regarding the conflicts in Angola, Rhodesia (Zimbabwe), and Namibia. He hosted Henry Kissinger's 1976 trip to Zambia, got along very well with Jimmy Carter, and worked closely with President Ronald Reagan's assistant secretary of state for African affairs, Chester Crocker. While there were disagreements between Kaunda and US leaders (such as when Zambia purchased Soviet MiG fighters or when he accused two American diplomats of being spies), Kaunda generally enjoyed a positive relationship with the United States during these years.\nOn 26 August 1975, Kaunda acted as mediator along with the Prime Minister of South Africa, B. J. Vorster, at the Victoria Falls Conference to discuss possibilities for an internal settlement in Southern Rhodesia with Ian Smith and the black nationalists. After the Lancaster House Agreement, Kaunda attempted to seek similar majority rule in South West Africa. He met with P. W. Botha in Botswana in 1982 to debate this proposal, but apparently failed to make a serious impression.\nMeanwhile, the anti-white minority insurgency conflicts of southern Africa continued to place a huge economic burden on Zambia as white minority governments were the country's main trading partners. In response, Kaunda negotiated the TAZARA Railway (Tanzam) linking Kapiri Mposhi in the Zambian Copperbelt with Tanzania's port of Dar es Salaam on the Indian Ocean. Completed in 1975, this was the only route for bulk trade which did not have to transit white-dominated territories. This precarious situation lasted more than 20 years, until the abolition of apartheid in South Africa.\nFor much of the Cold War, Kaunda was a strong supporter of the Non-Aligned Movement. He hosted a NAM summit in Lusaka in 1970 and served as the movement's chairman from 1970 to 1973. He maintained a close friendship with Yugoslavia's long-time leader Josip Broz Tito; he was remembered by many Yugoslav officials for weeping openly over Tito's casket in 1980. He also visited and welcomed Romania's president, Nicolae Ceau\u0219escu, in the 1970s. In 1986, the University of Belgrade, Yugoslavia, awarded him an honorary doctorate.\nKaunda had frequent but cordial differences with US president Ronald Reagan whom he met 1983 and British prime minister Margaret Thatcher mainly over what he saw as a blind eye being turned towards South African apartheid. He always maintained warm relations with the People's Republic of China who had provided assistance on many projects in Zambia, including the Tazara Railway.\nPrior to the first Gulf War, Kaunda cultivated a friendship with Iraqi president Saddam Hussein, whom he claimed to have attempted to dissuade from invading Kuwait. A street in Lusaka was named in Saddam's honour, although the name was later changed when both leaders had left power.\nIn August 1989, Farzad Bazoft was detained in Iraq for alleged espionage. He was accompanied by a British nurse, Daphne Parish, who was also arrested. Bazoft was later tried, convicted, and executed, but Kaunda managed to negotiate for his female companion's release.\nKaunda served as chairman of the Organisation of African Unity (OAU) from 1970 to 1971 and again from 1987 to 1988.\nFall from power.\nMatters quickly came to a head in 1990. In July, amid three days of rioting in the capital, Kaunda announced a referendum on whether to legalise other parties would be held that October. However, he argued for maintaining UNIP's monopoly, claiming that a multiparty system would lead to chaos. The announcement almost came too late; hours later, a disgruntled officer went on the radio to announce Kaunda had been overthrown. The coup attempt was broken three to four hours later, but it was clear Kaunda and the UNIP were reeling. Kaunda tried to mollify the opposition by moving the referendum to August 1991; the opposition claimed the original date did not allow enough time for voter registration.\nWhile expressing willingness to have the Zambian people vote on a multiparty system, Kaunda maintained that only a one-party state could prevent tribalism and violence from engulfing the country. By September, however, opposition demands forced Kaunda to reverse course. He cancelled the referendum, and instead recommended constitutional amendments that would dismantle UNIP's monopoly on power. He also announced a snap general election for the following year, two years before it was due. He signed the necessary amendments into law in December.\nAt these elections, the Movement for Multiparty Democracy (MMD), helmed by trade union leader Frederick Chiluba, swept UNIP from power in a landslide. In the presidential election, Kaunda was roundly defeated, taking only 24 per cent of the vote to Chiluba's 75 per cent. UNIP was cut down to only 25 seats in the National Assembly. One of the issues in the campaign was a plan by Kaunda to turn over one-quarter of the nation's land to Maharishi Mahesh Yogi, an Indian guru who promised that he would use it for a network of utopian agricultural enclaves that proponents said would create \"Heaven on Earth\". Kaunda was forced in a television interview to deny practising Transcendental Meditation. When Kaunda handed power to Chiluba on 2 November 1991, he became the second mainland African head of state to allow free multiparty elections and to relinquish power peacefully after he had lost. The first, Mathieu K\u00e9r\u00e9kou of Benin, had done so in March of that year.\nPost-presidency.\nAfter leaving office, Kaunda clashed frequently with Chiluba's government and the MMD. Chiluba later attempted to deport Kaunda on the grounds that he was a Malawian. The MMD-dominated government under the leadership of Chiluba had the constitution amended, barring citizens with foreign parentage from standing for the presidency, to prevent Kaunda from contesting the next elections in 1996, in which he planned to participate. After the 1997 coup attempt, on Boxing Day in 1997 he was arrested by paramilitary policemen. However, many officials in the region appealed against this; on New Year's Eve of the same year, he was placed under house arrest until his court date. In 1999 Kaunda was declared stateless by the Ndola High Court in a judgment delivered by Justice Chalendo Sakala. Kaunda however successfully challenged this decision in the Supreme Court of Zambia, which declared him to be a Zambian citizen in the \"Lewanika and Others vs. Chiluba\" ruling.\nOn 4 June 1998, Kaunda announced that he was resigning as United National Independence Party leader and retiring from politics. After retiring in 2000, he was involved in various charitable organisations. His most notable contribution was his zeal in the fight against the spread of HIV/AIDS. One of Kaunda's children was claimed by the pandemic in the 1980s. From 2002 to 2004, he was an \"African President-in-Residence\" at the African Presidential Archives and Research Center at Boston University.\nIn September 2019, Kaunda said that it was regrettable that the late president Robert Mugabe was maligned and subjected to mudslinging by some sections of the world, who were against his crusade of bringing social justice and equity to Zimbabwe.\nPersonal life and death.\nKaunda married Betty Banda in 1946, with whom he had eight children. She died on 19 September 2013 aged 84, while visiting one of their daughters in Harare, Zimbabwe.\nHe also wrote music about the independence he hoped to achieve, although only one song has been known to many Zambians (\"Tiyende pamodzi ndi mtima umo\" literally meaning \"Let's walk together with one heart\").\nOn 14 June 2021, Kaunda was admitted to Maina Soko Military Hospital in Lusaka to be treated for an undisclosed medical condition. The Zambian government said medics were doing everything they could to make him recover, though it was not clear what his health condition was. On 15 June 2021, it was revealed that he was being treated for pneumonia, which according to his doctor, had been a recurring problem in his health. On 17 June 2021 it was confirmed that he died at the age of 97 after a short illness at Maina Soko Military Hospital. He was survived by 30 grandchildren and eleven great-grandchildren.\nKaunda attributed his longevity to a strict lacto-vegetarian diet and commented that \"I don't take meat, no eggs, no chicken, I only eat vegetables like an elephant\". He also avoided alcohol and gave up drinking tea in 1953.\nPresident Edgar Lungu announced on his Facebook page that Zambia will observe 21 days of national mourning. On 21 June, Vice-President Inonge Wina announced that Kaunda's remains would be taken on a funeral procession around the country's provinces, with church services in each provincial capital, prior to a state funeral at National Heroes Stadium in Lusaka on 2 July and interment at the Presidential Burial Site on 7 July.\nSeveral other nations also announced periods of state mourning. Zimbabwe declared fourteen days of mourning; South Africa declared ten days of mourning; Botswana, Malawi, Namibia and Tanzania all declared seven days of mourning; Mozambique declared six days of mourning; South Sudan declared three days of mourning; Cuba declared one day of mourning. President of Singapore Halimah Yacob offered her condolences to the politicians and people of Zambia for Kaunda's death.\nAwards and honours.\nNational honours\nKenneth Kaunda's birthday, 28 April, was declared a public holiday in 2021 by then President Edgar Lungu to honour Kaunda's work and legacy.\nOn 27 September 2011, President Michael Sata decided that Lusaka International Airport should be renamed after Kenneth Kaunda.\nForeign honours\nAwards\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It lies in the Karakoram range, partially in the Gilgit-Baltistan region of Pakistan-administered Kashmir and partially in the China-administered Trans-Karakoram Tract in the Taxkorgan Tajik Autonomous County of Xinjiang.\nK2 became known as the \"Savage Mountain\" after George Bell\u2014a climber on the 1953 American expedition\u2014said, \"It's a savage mountain that tries to kill you.\" Of the five highest mountains in the world, K2 has long been the deadliest: prior to 2021, approximately one person had died on the mountain for every four who reached the summit. After an increase in successful attempts, as of \u00a02023[ [update]], an estimated 800 people have summited K2, with 96 deaths during attempted climbs.\nK2 is nicknamed \"The King of Mountains\" and \"The Mountaineers' Mountain\", as well as \"The Mountain of Mountains\", a phrase popularized by Italian climber Reinhold Messner in his book on K2. Although the summit of Everest is at a higher altitude, K2 is a more difficult and dangerous climb. This is in part due to its more northern location, where inclement weather is more common, as well as its steep and exposed faces. The summit was reached for the first time by the Italian climbers Lino Lacedelli and Achille Compagnoni on a 1954 Italian expedition led by Ardito Desio.\nMost ascents are made during July and August, typically the warmest times of the year. In January 2021 K2 became the final eight-thousander to be summited in the winter by a team of Nepalese climbers led by Nirmal Purja and Mingma Gyalje Sherpa.\nK2's eastern face remains un-climbed, partly because of the hazards associated with the instability of its ice and snow formations.\nName.\nThe name \"K2\" is derived from the notation used by the Great Trigonometrical Survey of British India. Thomas Montgomerie made the first survey of the Karakoram from Mount Haramukh, some to the south, and sketched the two most prominent peaks, labeling them \"K1\" and \"K2\", where the \"K\" stands for \"Karakoram\".\nThe policy of the Great Trigonometrical Survey was to use local names for mountains wherever possible and K1 was found to be known locally as Masherbrum. K2, however, appeared not to have acquired a local name\u2014possibly due to its remoteness. The mountain is not visible from Askole, one of the highest settlements on the way to the mountain, nor from the nearest habitation to the north. K2 is only fleetingly glimpsed from the end of the Baltoro Glacier, beyond which few local people would have ventured. The name \"Chogori\", derived from two Balti words, \"chhogo\" \u0f46\u0f7c\u0f0b\u0f42\u0fb7\u0f60\u0f7c\u0f0b (\"big\") and \"ri\" \u0f62\u0f72 (\"mountain\") (\u0686\u06be\u0648\u063a\u0648\u0631\u06cc) has been suggested as a local name, but evidence for its widespread use is scant. It may have been a compound name invented by Western explorers or simply a bemused reply to the question \"What's that called?\" It does, however, form the basis for the name \"Qogir\" () by which Chinese authorities officially refer to the peak. Other local names have been suggested including \"Lamba Pahar\" (\"Tall Mountain\" in Urdu) and \"Dapsang\", but these are not widely used.\nWith the mountain lacking a local name, the name \"Mount Godwin-Austen\" was suggested in honour of Henry Godwin-Austen, an early explorer of the area. While the name was rejected by the Royal Geographical Society, it was used on several maps and continues to be used occasionally.\nThe surveyor's mark, K2, therefore continues to be the name by which the mountain is commonly known. It is now also used in the Balti language, rendered as \"Kechu\" or \"Ketu\" (, ). The Italian climber Fosco Maraini argued in his account of the ascent of Gasherbrum IV that while the name of K2 owes its origin to chance, its clipped, impersonal nature is highly appropriate for such a remote and challenging mountain. He concluded that it was:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;...\u00a0just the bare bones of a name, all rock and ice and storm and abyss. It makes no attempt to sound human. It is atoms and stars. It has the nakedness of the world before the first man\u2014or of the cindered planet after the last.\nAndr\u00e9 Weil named K3 surfaces in mathematics partly after the beauty of the mountain K2.\nGeographical setting.\nK2 lies in the northwestern Karakoram Range. It is located in the Baltistan region of Gilgit\u2013Baltistan, Pakistan, and the Taxkorgan Tajik Autonomous County of Xinjiang, China. The Tarim sedimentary basin borders the range on the north and the Lesser Himalayas on the south. Melt waters from glaciers, such as those south and east of K2, feed agriculture in the valleys and contribute significantly to the regional fresh-water supply.\nK2 is ranked 22nd by topographic prominence, a measure of a mountain's independent stature. It is a part of the same extended area of uplift (including the Karakoram, the Tibetan Plateau, and the Himalayas) as Mount Everest, and it is possible to follow a path from K2 to Everest that goes no lower than , at the Kora La on the Nepal/China border in the Mustang Lo. Many other peaks far lower than K2 are more independent in this sense. It is, however, the most prominent peak within the Karakoram range.\nK2 is notable for its local relief as well as its total height. It stands over above much of the glacial valley bottoms at its base. It is a consistently steep pyramid, dropping quickly in almost all directions. The north side is the steepest: there it rises over above the K2 (Qogir) Glacier in only of horizontal distance. In most directions, it achieves over of vertical relief in less than .\nA 1986 expedition led by George Wallerstein made an inaccurate measurement showing that K2 was taller than Mount Everest, and therefore the tallest mountain on Earth. A corrected measurement was made in 1987, but by then the claim that K2 was the tallest mountain in the world had already made it into many news reports and reference works.\nHeight.\nK2's height given on maps and encyclopedias is . In the summer of 2014, a Pakistani-Italian expedition to K2, named \"K2 60 Years Later\", was organized to commemorate the 60th anniversary of the first ascent of K2. One of the goals of the expedition was to accurately measure the height of the mountain using satellite navigation. The height of K2 measured during this expedition was .\nGeology.\nThe mountains of K2 and Broad Peak, and the area westward to the lower reaches of Sarpo Laggo glacier, consist of metamorphic rocks, known as the \"K2 Gneiss\" and part of the Karakoram Metamorphic Complex. The K2 Gneiss consists of a mixture of orthogneiss and biotite-rich paragneiss. On the south and southeast face of K2, the orthogneiss consists of a mixture of a strongly foliated plagioclase-hornblende gneiss and a biotite-hornblende-K-feldspar orthogneiss, which has been intruded by garnet-mica leucogranitic dikes. In places, the paragneisses include clinopyroxene-hornblende-bearing psammites, garnet (grossular)-diopside marbles, and biotite-graphite phyllites. Near the memorial to the climbers who have died on K2, above Base Camp on the south spur, thin impure marbles with quartzites and mica schists, called the \"Gilkey-Puchoz sequence\", are interbanded within the orthogneisses. On the west face of Broad Peak and the south spur of K2, lamprophyre dikes, which consist of clinopyroxene and biotite-porphyritic vogesites and minettes, have intruded the K2 gneiss. The K2 Gneiss is separated from the surrounding sedimentary and metasedimentary rocks of the surrounding Karakoram Metamorphic Complex by normal faults. For example, a fault separates the K2 gneiss of the east face of K2 from limestones and slates comprising nearby Skyang Kangri.\n40Ar/39Ar ages of 115 to 120 million years ago obtained from and geochemical analyses of the K2 Gneiss demonstrate that it is an older, metamorphosed, pre-collisional Cretaceous granite. The granitic precursor (protolith) to the K2 Gneiss originated as the result of the production of large bodies of magma by a northward-dipping subduction zone along what was the continental margin of Asia at that time and their intrusion as batholiths into its lower continental crust. During the initial collision of the Asia and Indian plates, this granitic batholith was buried to depths of about or more, highly metamorphosed, highly deformed, and partially remelted during the Eocene Period to form gneiss. Later, the K2 Gneiss was then intruded by leucogranite dikes and finally exhumed and uplifted along major breakback thrust faults during post-Miocene time. The K2 Gneiss was exposed as the entire K2-Broad Peak-Gasherbrum range experienced rapid uplift with which erosion rates have been unable to keep pace.\nClimbing history.\nEarly attempts.\nThe mountain was first surveyed by a British team in 1856. Team member Thomas Montgomerie designated the mountain \"K2\" for being the second peak of the Karakoram range. The other peaks were originally named K1, K3, K4, and K5, but were eventually renamed Masherbrum, Gasherbrum IV, Gasherbrum II, and Gasherbrum I, respectively. In 1892, Martin Conway led a British expedition that reached \"Concordia\" on the Baltoro Glacier.\nThe first serious attempt to climb K2 was undertaken in 1902 by Oscar Eckenstein, Aleister Crowley, Jules Jacot-Guillarmod, Heinrich Pfannl, Victor Wessely, and Guy Knowles via the Northeast Ridge. In the early 1900s, modern transportation did not exist in the region: it took \"fourteen days just to reach the foot of the mountain\". After five serious and costly attempts, the team reached \u2014although considering the difficulty of the challenge, and the lack of modern climbing equipment or weatherproof fabrics, Crowley's statement that \"neither man nor beast was injured\" highlights the relative skill of the ascent. The failures were also attributed to sickness (Crowley was suffering the residual effects of malaria), a combination of questionable physical training, personality conflicts, and poor weather conditions\u2014of 68 days spent on K2 (at the time, the record for the longest time spent at such an altitude) only eight provided clear weather.\nThe next expedition to K2, in 1909, led by Prince Luigi Amedeo, Duke of the Abruzzi, reached an elevation of around on the South East Spur, now known as the \"Abruzzi Spur\" (or Abruzzi Ridge). This would eventually become part of the standard route, but was abandoned at the time due to its steepness and difficulty. After trying and failing to find a feasible alternative route on the West Ridge or the North East Ridge, the Duke declared that K2 would never be climbed, and the team switched its attention to Chogolisa, where the Duke came within of the summit before being driven back by a storm.\nThe next attempt on K2 was not made until 1938, when the First American Karakoram expedition, led by Charles Houston, made a reconnaissance of the mountain. They concluded that the Abruzzi Spur was the most practical route and reached a height of around before turning back due to diminishing supplies and the threat of bad weather.\nThe following year, the 1939 American expedition led by Fritz Wiessner came within of the summit but ended in disaster when Dudley Wolfe, Pasang Kikuli, Pasang Kitar, and Pintso disappeared high on the mountain.\nCharles Houston returned to K2 to lead the 1953 American expedition. The attempt failed after a storm pinned down the team for 10 days at , during which time climber Art Gilkey became critically ill. A desperate retreat followed, during which Pete Schoening saved almost the entire team during a mass fall (known simply as The Belay), and Gilkey was killed, either in an avalanche or in a deliberate attempt to avoid burdening his companions. Despite the retreat and tragic end, the expedition has been given iconic status in mountaineering history. The Gilkey Memorial was built in his memory at the mountain's foot.\nSuccess and repeats.\nThe 1954 Italian expedition finally succeeded in ascending to the summit of K2 via the Abruzzi Spur on 31 July 1954. The expedition was led by Ardito Desio, and the two climbers who reached the summit were Lino Lacedelli and Achille Compagnoni. The team included a Pakistani member, Colonel Muhammad Ata-ullah, who had been a part of the 1953 American expedition. Also on the expedition were Walter Bonatti and Pakistani Hunza porter Amir Mehdi, who both proved vital to the expedition's success in that they carried oxygen tanks to for Lacedelli and Compagnoni. The ascent is controversial because Lacedelli and Compagnoni established their camp at a higher elevation than originally agreed with Mehdi and Bonatti. It being too dark to ascend or descend, Mehdi and Bonatti were forced to overnight without shelter above , leaving the oxygen tanks behind as requested when they descended. Bonatti and Mehdi survived, but Mehdi was hospitalised for months and had to have his toes amputated because of frostbite. Efforts in the 1950s to suppress these facts to protect Lacedelli and Compagnoni's reputations as Italian national heroes were later brought to light. It was also revealed that the moving of the camp was deliberate, apparently because Compagnoni feared being outshone by the younger Bonatti. Bonatti was given the blame for Mehdi's hospitalisation.\nOn 9 August 1977, 23 years after the Italian expedition, Ichiro Yoshizawa led the second successful ascent, with Ashraf Aman as the first native Pakistani climber. The Japanese expedition took the Abruzzi Spur and used more than 1,500 porters.\nThe third ascent of K2 was in 1978, via a new route, the long and corniced Northeast Ridge. The top of the route traversed left across the East Face to avoid a vertical headwall and joined the uppermost part of the Abruzzi route. This ascent was made by an American team, led by James Whittaker; the summit party was Louis Reichardt, Jim Wickwire, John Roskelley, and Rick Ridgeway. Wickwire endured an overnight bivouac about below the summit, one of the highest bivouacs in history. This ascent was emotional for the American team, as they saw themselves as completing a task that had been begun by the 1938 team forty years earlier.\nAnother notable Japanese ascent was that of the difficult North Ridge on the Chinese side of the peak in 1982. A team from the Japan Mountaineering Association led by Isao Shinkai and Masatsugo Konishi put three members, Naoe Sakashita, Hiroshi Yoshino, and Yukihiro Yanagisawa, on the summit on 14 August. However Yanagisawa fell and died on the descent. Four other members of the team achieved the summit the next day.\nThe first climber to reach the summit of K2 twice was Czech climber Josef Rakoncaj. Rakoncaj was a member of the 1983 Italian expedition led by Francesco Santon, which made the second successful ascent of the North Ridge (31 July 1983). Three years later, on 5 July 1986, he reached the summit via the Abruzzi Spur (double with Broad Peak West Face solo) as a member of Agostino da Polenza's international expedition.\nThe first woman to summit K2 was Polish climber Wanda Rutkiewicz on 23 June 1986. Liliane and Maurice Barrard, who had summited later that day, fell during the descent; Liliane Barrard's body was found on 19 July 1986 at the foot of the south face. On July 28, 2024, Japanese climber Naoko Watanabe became the first woman to summit K2 three times. On 28 July 2024, Italian mountaineer Tommaso Lamantia summited K2 (8611m). The 42-year-old mountaineer, who is member of the CAI Biella expedition, climbed alone and without supplementary oxygen.\nIn 1986, two Polish expeditions summited via two new routes, the Magic Line and the Polish Line (Jerzy Kukuczka and Tadeusz Piotrowski). Piotrowski fell to his death as the two were descending.\nThirteen climbers from several expeditions died in the 1986 K2 disaster. Another six mountaineers died in the 1995 K2 disaster, while eleven climbers died in the 2008 K2 disaster.\nIn 2004, the Spanish climber Carlos Soria Font\u00e1n became the oldest person ever to summit K2, at the age of 65.\n On 1 August 2008, a group of climbers went missing after a large piece of ice fell during an avalanche, taking out the fixed ropes on part of the route; four climbers were rescued, but 11, including Meherban Karim from Pakistan and Ger McDonnell, the first Irish person to reach the summit, were confirmed dead.\n Despite several attempts, nobody reached the summit.\n On 6 August 2010, Fredrik Ericsson, who intended to ski from the summit, joined Gerlinde Kaltenbrunner on the way to the summit of K2. Ericsson fell and was killed. Kaltenbrunner aborted her summit attempt.\nDespite several attempts, nobody reached the summit.\n On 23 August 2011, a team of four climbers reached the summit of K2 from the North side. Gerlinde Kaltenbrunner became the first woman to complete all 14 eight-thousanders without supplemental oxygen. Kazakhs Maxut Zhumayev and Vassiliy Pivtsov completed their eight-thousanders quest. The fourth team member was Dariusz Za\u0142uski from Poland.\n The year started with a Russian team aiming for a first winter ascent. This expedition ended with the death of Vitaly Gorelik due to frostbite and pneumonia. The Russian team cancelled the ascent. In the summer season, K2 saw a record crowd standing on its summit\u201428 climbers in a single day\u2014bringing the total for the year to 30.\n On 26 July 2014, the first team of Pakistani climbers scaled K2. There were six Pakistani and three Italian climbers in the expedition, called K2 60 Years Later, according to BBC. Previously, K2 had only been summited by individual Pakistanis as part of international expeditions. Another team, consisting of Pasang Lhamu Sherpa Akita, Maya Sherpa, and Dawa Yangzum Sherpa, became the first Nepali women to climb K2.\nOn 27 July 2014, Garrett Madison led a team of three American climbers and six Sherpas to summit K2. On this day, Alan Arnette became the oldest American to summit the mountain at the age of 58. On 31 July 2014, Boyan Petrov completed the first Bulgarian ascent, just 8 days after climbing Broad Peak.\n On 28 July 2017, Vanessa O'Brien led an international team of 12 with Mingma Gyalje Sherpa of Dreamers Destination to the summit of K2 and became the first British and American woman to summit K2, and the eldest woman to summit K2 at the age of 52 years old. She paid tribute to Julie Tullis and Alison Hargreaves, two British women who summited K2, in 1986 and 1995 respectively, but died during their descents. Other notable summits included John Snorri Sigurj\u00f3nsson and Dawa Gyalje Sherpa who joined his sister (Dawa Yangzum Sherpa), becoming the second set of siblings to summit K2. Both Mingma Gyalje Sherpa and Fazal Ali recorded their second K2 summits.\n2018 became the record year for highest number of summits in a season, at 62.\nOn 22 July 2018, Garrett Madison became the first American climber to reach the summit of K2 more than once when he led an international team of eight climbers, nine Nepali Sherpas, four Pakistani high-altitude porters, and two other Madison Mountaineering guides to the summit.\nOn 22 July 2018, Polish mountaineer and mountain runner Andrzej Bargiel became the first person to ski from summit to base camp.\nOn 25 July 2019, Anja Blacha became the first German woman to summit K2. She climbed without the use of supplemental oxygen.\nOn 22 July 2022, 145 summits on K2 were recorded in a single day, making it a record for the highest number of summits in a single day ever on K2. The 2022 season also saw the highest number of summits in a season at 200, taking over the previous record of 62 summits in 2018.\nOn 28 July 2022, Adriana Brownlee became the youngest woman to climb K2 when she summited at age 21.\n2023 was also a busy season like 2022, with an estimated 112 summits on the only viable weather window of July 27. Norwegian mountaineer Kristin Harila and her guide, Nepali mountaineer Tenjen Sherpa successfully completed their summit of K2 on the same day, and set a record for the fastest climb of all 14 eight-thousanders in 92 days.\nClimbing routes and difficulties.\nK2 features several routes, each with distinct characteristics; however, they all share common challenges. The first is the extreme altitude, which results in a significant reduction in available oxygen. At the summit of K2, only one-third of the oxygen present at sea level is available to climbers. The second challenge is the mountain's tendency to experience extreme storms lasting several days, which have resulted in many of the deaths on the peak. The third is the steep, exposed, and demanding nature of all routes on the mountain, which makes retreat particularly difficult, especially during storms. Despite numerous attempts, the first successful winter ascent occurred only in 2021. All major climbing routes are located on the Pakistani side. The base camp is also located on the Pakistani side.\nAbruzzi Spur.\nThe standard route of ascent, used by 75% of all climbers, is the Abruzzi Spur, located on the Pakistani side, first attempted by Prince Luigi Amedeo, Duke of the Abruzzi in 1909. This is the peak's southeast ridge, rising above the Godwin-Austen Glacier. The spur proper begins at an altitude of , where Advanced Base Camp is usually placed. The route follows an alternating series of rock ribs, snow/ice fields, and some technical rock climbing on two famous features, \"House's Chimney\" and the \"Black Pyramid.\" Above the Black Pyramid, the route continues along dangerously exposed and difficult-to-navigate slopes leading to the easily visible \"Shoulder\" and then on to the summit. The last major obstacle is a narrow couloir known as the \"Bottleneck\", which places climbers dangerously close to a wall of seracs that form an ice cliff to the east of the summit. It was partly due to the collapse of one of these seracs around 2001 that no climbers reached the summit in 2002 and 2003.\nBetween 1 and 2 August 2008, 11 climbers from several expeditions died during a series of accidents, including several icefalls in the Bottleneck.\nNorth Ridge.\nAlmost opposite the Abruzzi Spur is the North Ridge, which ascends the Chinese side of the peak. It is rarely climbed, partly due to very difficult access, involving crossing the Shaksgam River, which is a hazardous undertaking. In contrast to the crowds of climbers and trekkers at the Abruzzi basecamp, usually at most two teams are encamped below the North Ridge. This route, more technically difficult than the Abruzzi, ascends a long, steep, primarily rock ridge to high on the mountain\u2014Camp IV, the \"Eagle's Nest\" at \u2014and then crosses a dangerously slide-prone hanging glacier by a leftward climbing traverse, to reach a snow couloir which accesses the summit.\nBesides the original Japanese ascent, a notable ascent of the North Ridge was the one in 1990 by Greg Child, Greg Mortimer, and Steve Swenson, which was done alpine style above Camp 2, though using some fixed ropes already put in place by a Japanese team.\nOther routes.\nBecause 75% of people who climb K2 use the Abruzzi Spur, these listed routes are rarely climbed. No one has climbed the East Face of the mountain due to the instability of the snow and ice formations on that side. In addition to the East Face, the North Face has not yet been climbed either. In 2007, Denis Urubko and Serguey Samoilov intended to climb the K2's North Face but they were stymied by increasingly deteriorating conditions. After finding their intended route menaced by growing avalanche danger, they traversed onto the normal North Ridge route and summited on 2 October 2007, making the latest summer season ascent of the peak in history.\nUse of supplemental oxygen.\nFor most of its climbing history, K2 was not usually climbed with supplemental oxygen. Small, lightweight teams were the norm. However, the 2004 season saw a great increase in the use of oxygen: 28 of 47 summiteers used oxygen in that year.\nAcclimatisation is essential when climbing without oxygen to avoid some degree of altitude sickness. K2's summit is well above the altitude at which high-altitude pulmonary edema (HAPE) and high-altitude cerebral edema (HACE) can occur. In mountaineering, when ascending above an altitude of , the climber enters what is known as the \"death zone\".\nPasses.\nWindy Gap is a mountain pass at east of K2, north of Broad Peak, and south of Skyang Kangri.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The largest extant population lives within the Komodo National Park in Eastern Indonesia. It is the largest extant species of lizard, with the males growing to a maximum length of and weighing up to .\nAs a result of their size, Komodo dragons are apex predators, and dominate the ecosystems in which they live. Komodo dragons hunt and ambush prey including invertebrates, birds, and mammals. Komodo dragons' group behavior in hunting is exceptional in the reptile world. The diet of Komodo dragons mainly consists of Javan rusa (\"Rusa timorensis\"), though they also eat considerable amounts of carrion. Komodo dragons also occasionally attack humans.\nMating begins between May and August, and the eggs are laid in September; as many as 20 eggs are deposited at a time in an abandoned megapode nest or in a self-dug nesting hole. The eggs are incubated for seven to eight months, hatching in April, when insects are most plentiful. Young Komodo dragons are vulnerable and dwell in trees to avoid predators, such as cannibalistic adults, which young Komodo dragons also try to repel by rolling in feces. They take 8 to 9 years to mature and are estimated to live up to 30 years.\nKomodo dragons were first recorded by Western scientists in 1910. Their large size and fearsome reputation make them popular zoo exhibits. In the wild, their range has been reduced by human encroachment and is likely to contract further from the effects of climate change; hence, they are listed as Endangered by the IUCN Red List. They are protected under Indonesian law, and Komodo National Park was founded in 1980 to aid protection efforts.\nIn the Komodo language, the dragons are called 'twins', due to a traditional belief by the Komodo people that they share the same spiritual mother as the dragons. Meanwhile, the Baar people who speak the Baar dialect of Riung language, call the komodo dragon \"mbau\".\nTaxonomy.\nKomodo dragons were first documented by Europeans in 1910, when rumors of a \"land crocodile\" reached Lieutenant van Steyn van Hensbroek of the Dutch colonial administration. Widespread notoriety came after 1912, when Peter Ouwens, the director of the Zoological Museum of Bogor, Java, published a paper on the topic after receiving a photo and a skin from the lieutenant, as well as two other specimens from a collector.\nThe first two live Komodo dragons to arrive in Europe were exhibited in the Reptile House at London Zoo when it opened in 1927. Joan Beauchamp Procter made some of the earliest observations of these animals in captivity and she demonstrated their behaviour at a scientific meeting of the Zoological Society of London in 1928.\nThe Komodo dragon was the driving factor for an expedition to Komodo Island by W. Douglas Burden in 1926. After returning with 12\u00a0preserved specimens and two live ones, this expedition provided the inspiration for the 1933 movie \"King Kong\". It was also Burden who coined the common name \"Komodo dragon\". Three of his specimens were stuffed and are still on display in the American Museum of Natural History.\nThe Dutch island administration, realizing the limited number of individuals in the wild, soon outlawed sport hunting and heavily limited the number of individuals taken for scientific study. Collecting expeditions ground to a halt with the occurrence of World War\u00a0II, not resuming until the 1950s and 1960s, when studies examined the Komodo dragon's feeding behavior, reproduction, and body temperature. At around this time, an expedition was planned in which a long-term study of the Komodo dragon would be undertaken. This task was given to the Auffenberg family, who stayed on Komodo Island for 11\u00a0months in 1969. During their stay, Walter Auffenberg and his assistant Putra Sastrawan captured and tagged more than 50\u00a0Komodo dragons.\nResearch from the Auffenberg expedition proved enormously influential in raising Komodo dragons in captivity. Research after that of the Auffenberg family has shed more light on the nature of the Komodo dragon, with biologists such as Claudio Ciofi continuing to study the creatures.\nEtymology.\nThe Komodo dragon is also sometimes known as the Komodo monitor or the Komodo Island monitor in scientific literature, although these names are uncommon. To the natives of Komodo Island, it is referred to as \"ora\", \"buaya darat\" ('land crocodile'), or \"biawak raksasa\" ('giant monitor').\nEvolutionary history.\nGenetic analysis of mitochondrial DNA shows the Komodo dragon to be the closest relative (sister taxon) of the Australian lace monitor (\"V.\u00a0varius\"), with their common ancestor diverging from a lineage that gave rise to the crocodile monitor (\"Varanus salvadorii\") of New Guinea. A 2021 study showed that during the late Miocene, the ancestors of Komodo dragons had hybridized with the common ancestor of Australian sand monitors (\"V. spenceri\", \"V. gouldii\", \"V. rosenbergi\" and \"V. panoptes\").\nFossils from across Queensland demonstrate that the Komodo dragon was once present in Australia, with fossils spanning from the Early Pliocene (~3.8 million years ago) to the Middle Pleistocene, with the youngest confirmed records of the species in Australia dating to at latest 330,000 years ago. In Australia, it coexisted with the even larger monitor species \"Varanus priscus\" also known as megalania, the largest terrestrial lizard ever. The oldest records of the Komodo dragon on Flores date to around 1.4 million years ago, during the Early Pleistocene. Additionally, Pleistocene fossils of \"Varanus\" found in Java and Timor may belong to the Komodo dragon.\nDescription.\nIn the wild, adult Komodo dragons usually weigh around , although captive specimens often weigh more. According to \"Guinness World Records\", an average adult male will weigh and measure , while an average female will weigh and measure . The largest verified specimen in captivity was long and weighed , including its undigested food. The largest wild specimen had a length , a snout-vent length (SVL) and a mass of excluding stomach contents. The heaviest reached a mass of . The study noted that weights greater than were possible but only after the animal had consumed a large meal.\nThe Komodo dragon has a tail as long as its body, as well as about 60 frequently replaced, serrated teeth that can measure up to in length. Its saliva is frequently blood-tinged because its teeth are almost completely covered by gingival tissue that is naturally lacerated during feeding. It also has a long, yellow, deeply forked tongue. Komodo dragon skin is reinforced by armoured scales, which contain tiny bones called osteoderms that function as a sort of natural chain-mail. The only areas lacking osteoderms on the head of the adult Komodo dragon are around the eyes, nostrils, mouth margins, and parietal eye, a light-sensing organ on the top of the head. Where lizards typically have one or two varying patterns or shapes of osteoderms, komodos have four: rosette, platy, dendritic, and vermiform. This rugged hide makes Komodo dragon skin a poor source of leather. Additionally, these osteoderms become more extensive and variable in shape as the Komodo dragon ages, ossifying more extensively as the lizard grows. These osteoderms are absent in hatchlings and juveniles, indicating that the natural armor develops as a product of age and competition between adults for protection in intraspecific combat over food and mates.\nMorphology.\nDentition.\nKomodo dragons have ziphodont teeth, which are defined as teeth that are laterally flattened, recurved, and with serrated tooth crowns where the serrations have a dentine core and a very thin enamel outer layer. This is the same type of dentition observed in many extinct theropod dinosaurs. The teeth of the insectivorous juveniles in contrast are barely recurved, with fewer and less well-developed serrations that lack dentine cores.\nA 2024 study published in \"Nature Ecology &amp; Evolution\" found that Komodo dragons have orange, iron-enriched coatings on their tooth serrations and tips, as an adaptation for maintaining the sharp cutting edges. This feature is also observed to a lesser degree in a few other Australasian to Asian monitor species, though notably absent in a few other species from that range.\nTeeth are quickly replaced every 40 days, while maintaining up to 5 replacement teeth for each tooth position at any given time. This high rate of replacement and large number of replacement teeth is similar to that of the crocodile monitor. Many other monitor species as well as Chinese crocodile lizards and beaded lizards only have 1-2 replacement teeth behind each tooth position.\nSenses.\nAs with other varanids, Komodo dragons have only a single ear bone, the stapes, for transferring vibrations from the tympanic membrane to the cochlea. This arrangement means they are likely restricted to sounds in the 400 to 2,000 hertz range, compared to humans who hear between 20 and 20,000 hertz. They were formerly thought to be deaf when a study reported no agitation in wild Komodo dragons in response to whispers, raised voices, or shouts. This was disputed when London Zoo employee Joan Procter trained a captive specimen to come out to feed at the sound of her voice, even when she could not be seen.\nThe Komodo dragon can see objects as far away as , but because its retinas only contain cones, it is thought to have poor night vision. It can distinguish colours, but has poor visual discrimination of stationary objects.\nAs with many other reptiles, the Komodo dragon primarily relies on its tongue to detect, taste, and smell stimuli, with the vomeronasal sense using the Jacobson's organ, rather than using the nostrils. With the help of a favorable wind and its habit of swinging its head from side to side as it walks, a Komodo dragon may be able to detect carrion from away. Their tongue-flicking behavior is similar to that of snakes. It only has a few taste buds in the back of its throat. Its scales, some of which are reinforced with bone, have sensory plaques connected to nerves to facilitate its sense of touch. The scales around the ears, lips, chin, and soles of the feet may have three or more sensory plaques.\nBehaviour and ecology.\nThe Komodo dragon prefers hot and dry places and typically lives in dry, open grassland, savanna, and tropical forest at low elevations. As an ectotherm, it is most active in the day, although it exhibits some nocturnal activity. Komodo dragons are solitary, coming together only to breed and eat. There are some \"personality\" differences among the species, where some present as more \"shy\", particularly females. They are capable of running rapidly in brief sprints up to , diving up to , and climbing trees proficiently when young through use of their strong claws. To catch out-of-reach prey, the Komodo dragon may stand on its hind legs and use its tail as a support. As it matures, its claws are used primarily as weapons, as its great size makes climbing impractical.\nFor shelter, the Komodo dragon digs holes that can measure from wide with its powerful forelimbs and claws. Because of its large size and habit of sleeping in these burrows, it is able to conserve body heat throughout the night and minimise its basking period the morning after. The Komodo dragon stays in the shade during the hottest part of the day and hunts in the afternoon. These special resting places, usually located on ridges with cool sea breezes, are marked with droppings and are cleared of vegetation. They serve as strategic locations from which to ambush deer.\nDiet.\nKomodo dragons are apex predators. They are carnivores; although they have been considered as eating mostly carrion, they will frequently ambush live prey with a stealthy approach. When suitable prey arrives near a dragon's ambush site, it will suddenly charge at the animal at high speeds and go for the underside or the throat. The majority of the extant Komodo dragon population's diet is made up of introduced ungulates, such as deer, pigs, and buffalo.Komodo dragons do not deliberately allow the prey to escape with fatal injuries but try to kill prey outright using a combination of lacerating damage and blood loss. They have been recorded as killing wild pigs within seconds, and observations of Komodo dragons tracking prey for long distances are likely misinterpreted cases of prey escaping an attack before succumbing to infection. Most prey attacked by a Komodo dragon reputedly suffer from said sepsis and will later be eaten by the same or other lizards.\nKomodo dragons eat by tearing large chunks of flesh and swallowing them whole while holding the carcass down with their forelegs. For smaller prey up to the size of a goat, their loosely articulated jaws, flexible skulls, and expandable stomachs allow them to swallow prey whole. The undigested vegetable contents of a prey animal's stomach and intestines are typically avoided. Copious amounts of red saliva the Komodo dragons produce help to lubricate the food, but swallowing is still a long process (15\u201320\u00a0minutes to swallow a goat). A Komodo dragon may attempt to speed up the process by ramming the carcass against a tree to force it down its throat, sometimes ramming so forcefully that the tree is knocked down. A small tube under the tongue that connects to the lungs allows it to breathe while swallowing.\nAfter eating up to 80% of its body mass in one meal, it drags itself to a sunny location to speed digestion, as the food could rot and poison the dragon if left undigested in its stomach for too long. Because of their slow metabolism, large dragons can survive on as few as 12\u00a0meals a year. After digestion, the Komodo dragon regurgitates a mass of horns, hair, and teeth known as the gastric pellet, which is covered in malodorous mucus. After regurgitating the gastric pellet, it rubs its face in the dirt or on bushes to get rid of the mucus.\nThe eating habits of Komodo dragons follow a hierarchy, with the larger animals generally eating before the smaller ones. The largest male typically asserts his dominance and the smaller males show their submission by use of body language and rumbling hisses. Dragons of equal size may resort to \"wrestling\". Losers usually retreat, though they have been known to be killed and eaten by victors.\nThe Komodo dragon's diet varies depending on stage of growth. Young Komodo dragons will eat insects, birds and bird's eggs and small reptiles, while larger Komodo dragons (typically over ) prefer large ungulate prey, such as Javan rusa deer, wild pigs and water buffalo. Occasionally, they attack and bite humans. Sometimes they consume human corpses, digging up bodies from shallow graves. This habit of raiding graves caused the villagers of Komodo to move their graves from sandy to clay ground, and pile rocks on top of them, to deter the lizards. Dwarf species of \"Stegodon\" (a proboscidean related to living elephants) are suggested to have been a primary prey item of the Komodo dragon during the Pleistocene, prior to the introduction of their modern ungulate prey, which were only introduced to the islands in the Holocene, around 10-7,000 years ago.\nThe Komodo dragon drinks by sucking water into its mouth via buccal pumping (a process also used for respiration), lifting its head, and letting the water run down its throat.\nSaliva.\nAlthough previous studies proposed that Komodo dragon saliva contains a variety of highly septic bacteria that would help to bring down prey, research in 2013 suggested that the bacteria in the mouths of Komodo dragons are ordinary and similar to those found in other carnivores. Komodo dragons have good mouth hygiene. To quote Bryan Fry: \"After they are done feeding, they will spend 10 to 15 minutes lip-licking and rubbing their head in the leaves to clean their mouth\u00a0... Unlike people have been led to believe, they do not have chunks of rotting flesh from their meals on their teeth, cultivating bacteria.\" They do have a slashing bite, which normally includes a dose of their neurotoxic venom and anticoagulant saliva. Komodo dragons do not wait for prey to die and track it at a distance, as vipers do; observations of them hunting deer, boar and in some cases buffalo reveal that they kill prey in less than half an hour.\nThe observation of prey dying of sepsis would then be explained by the natural instinct of water buffalos, which are not native to the islands where the Komodo dragon lives, to run into water after escaping an attack. The warm, faeces-filled water would then cause the infections. The study used samples from 16 captive dragons (10 adults and six neonates) from three US zoos.\nAntibacterial immune factor.\nResearchers have isolated a powerful antibacterial peptide, VK25, from the blood plasma of Komodo dragons. Based on their analysis of this peptide, they have synthesized a short peptide dubbed DRGN-1 and tested it against multidrug-resistant (MDR) pathogens. Preliminary results of these tests show that DRGN-1 is effective in killing drug-resistant bacterial strains and even some fungi. It has the added observed benefit of significantly promoting wound healing in both uninfected and mixed biofilm infected wounds.\nDisputed claims of venom.\nIn late 2005, researchers at the University of Melbourne speculated that the perentie (\"Varanus giganteus\"), other species of monitors, and agamids may be somewhat venomous. The team believes that the immediate effects of bites from these lizards were caused by mild envenomation. Bites on human digits by a lace monitor (\"V. varius\"), a Komodo dragon, and a spotted tree monitor (\"V. timorensis\") all produced similar effects: rapid swelling, localised disruption of blood clotting, and shooting pain up to the elbow, with some symptoms lasting for several hours.\nIn 2009, the same researchers published further evidence demonstrating that Komodo dragons possess a venomous bite. MRI scans of a preserved skull showed the presence of two glands in the lower jaw. The researchers extracted one of these glands from the head of a terminally ill dragon in the Singapore Zoological Gardens, and found it secreted several different toxic proteins. The known functions of these proteins include inhibition of blood clotting, lowering of blood pressure, muscle paralysis, and the induction of hypothermia, leading to shock and loss of consciousness in envenomated prey. As a result of the discovery, the previous theory that bacteria were responsible for the deaths of Komodo victims was disputed.\nOther scientists have stated that this allegation of venom glands \"has had the effect of underestimating the variety of complex roles played by oral secretions in the biology of reptiles, produced a very narrow view of oral secretions and resulted in misinterpretation of reptilian evolution.\" According to these scientists \"reptilian oral secretions contribute to many biological roles other than to quickly dispatch prey.\" These researchers concluded, \"Calling all in this clade venomous implies an overall potential danger that does not exist, misleads in the assessment of medical risks, and confuses the biological assessment of squamate biochemical systems.\" Evolutionary biologist Schwenk says that even if the lizards have venom-like proteins in their mouths they may be using them for a different function, and he doubts venom is necessary to explain the effect of a Komodo dragon bite, arguing that shock and blood loss are the primary factors. Although the mouths of Komodo dragons have been confirmed to contain venom glands with venom in them, it is not clear whether this venom has any serious effect on prey, as opposed to the damage caused by the bite itself. As of 2023, no clear unambiguous evidence of Komodo dragon bites having serious venom effects has been presented. A 2025 histochemical characterisation of the venom glands of the Komodo dragon confirmed the presence of several types of toxins, though the authors note that a venom depositing and draining structure has yet to be identified in lizard teeth, and stress that their study is restricted by specimen availability.\nReproduction.\nMating occurs between May and August, with the eggs laid in September. During this period, males fight over females and territory by grappling with one another upon their hind legs, with the loser eventually being pinned to the ground. These males may vomit or defecate when preparing for the fight. The winner of the fight will then flick his long tongue at the female to gain information about her receptivity. Females are antagonistic and resist with their claws and teeth during the early phases of courtship. Therefore, the male must fully restrain the female during coitus to avoid being hurt. Other courtship displays include males rubbing their chins on the female, hard scratches to the back, and licking. Copulation occurs when the male inserts one of his hemipenes into the female's cloaca. Komodo dragons may be monogamous and form \"pair bonds\", a rare behavior for lizards. In order to avoid inbreeding, females actively select distantly related male sperm.\nFemale Komodos lay their eggs from August to September and may use several types of locality; in one study, 60% laid their eggs in the nests of orange-footed scrubfowl (a moundbuilder or megapode), 20% on ground level and 20% in hilly areas. The females make many camouflage nests/holes to prevent other dragons from eating the eggs. Nests typically house one female, however a study found evidence of two females occasionally occupying the same den. Clutches contain an average of 20 eggs, which have an incubation period of 7\u20138 months. Hatching is an exhausting effort for the neonates, which break out of their eggshells with an egg tooth that falls off before long. After cutting themselves out, the hatchlings may lie in their eggshells for hours before starting to dig out of the nest. They are born quite defenseless and are vulnerable to predation. Sixteen youngsters from a single nest were on average 46.5\u00a0cm long and weighed 105.1\u00a0grams.\nYoung Komodo dragons spend much of their first few years in trees, where they are relatively safe from predators, including cannibalistic adults, as juvenile dragons make up 10% of their diets. The habit of cannibalism may be advantageous in sustaining the large size of adults, as medium-sized prey on the islands is rare. When the young approach a kill, they roll around in faecal matter and rest in the intestines of eviscerated animals to deter these hungry adults. Komodo dragons take approximately 8 to 9 years to mature, and may live for up to 30 years.\nParthenogenesis.\nA Komodo dragon at London Zoo named Sungai laid a clutch of eggs in late 2005 after being separated from male company for more than two years. Scientists initially assumed she had been able to store sperm from her earlier encounter with a male, an adaptation known as superfecundation. On 20 December 2006, it was reported that Flora, a captive Komodo dragon living in the Chester Zoo in England, was the second known Komodo dragon to have laid unfertilised eggs: she laid 11 eggs, and seven of them hatched, all of them male. Scientists at Liverpool University in England performed genetic tests on three eggs that collapsed after being moved to an incubator, and verified Flora had never been in physical contact with a male dragon. After Flora's eggs' condition had been discovered, testing showed Sungai's eggs were also produced without outside fertilization. On 31 January 2008, the Sedgwick County Zoo in Wichita, Kansas, became the first zoo in the Americas to document parthenogenesis in Komodo dragons. The zoo has two adult female Komodo dragons, one of which laid about 17 eggs on 19\u201320 May 2007. Only two eggs were incubated and hatched due to space issues; the first hatched on 31 January 2008, while the second hatched on 1 February. Both hatchlings were males.\nKomodo dragons have the ZW chromosomal sex-determination system, as opposed to the mammalian XY system. Male progeny prove Flora's unfertilized eggs were haploid (n) and doubled their chromosomes later to become diploid (2n) (by being fertilized by a polar body, or by chromosome duplication without cell division), rather than by her laying diploid eggs by one of the meiosis reduction-divisions in her ovaries failing. When a female Komodo dragon (with ZW sex chromosomes) reproduces in this manner, she provides her progeny with only one chromosome from each of her pairs of chromosomes, including only one of her two sex chromosomes. This single set of chromosomes is duplicated in the egg, which develops parthenogenetically. Eggs receiving a Z chromosome become ZZ (male); those receiving a W chromosome become WW and fail to develop, meaning that only males are produced by parthenogenesis in this species.It has been hypothesised that this reproductive adaptation allows a single female to enter an isolated ecological niche (such as an island) and by parthenogenesis produce male offspring, thereby establishing a sexually reproducing population (via reproduction with her offspring that can result in both male and female young). Despite the advantages of such an adaptation, zoos are cautioned that parthenogenesis may be detrimental to genetic diversity.\nEncounters with humans.\nAttacks on humans are rare, but Komodo dragons have been responsible for several human fatalities, both in the wild and in captivity. According to data from Komodo National Park spanning a 38-year period between 1974 and 2012, there were 24 reported attacks on humans, five of them fatal. Most of the victims were local villagers living around the national park.\nConservation.\nThe Komodo dragon is classified by the IUCN as Endangered and is listed on the IUCN Red List. The species' sensitivity to natural and human-made threats has long been recognized by conservationists, zoological societies, and the Indonesian government. Komodo National Park was founded in 1980 to protect Komodo dragon populations on islands including Komodo, Rinca, and Padar. Later, the Wae Wuul and Wolo Tado Reserves were opened on Flores to aid Komodo dragon conservation.\nKomodo dragons generally avoid encounters with humans. Juveniles are very shy and will flee quickly into a hideout if a human comes closer than about . Older animals will also retreat from humans from a shorter distance away. If cornered, they may react aggressively by gaping their mouth, hissing, and swinging their tail. If they are disturbed further, they may attack and bite. Although there are anecdotes of unprovoked Komodo dragons attacking or preying on humans, most of these reports are either not reputable or have subsequently been interpreted as defensive bites. Only very few cases are truly the result of unprovoked attacks by atypical individuals who lost their fear of humans.\nVolcanic activity, earthquakes, loss of habitat, fire, tourism, loss of prey due to poaching, and illegal poaching of the dragons themselves have all contributed to the vulnerable status of the Komodo dragon. A major future threat to the species is climate change via both aridification and sea level rise, which can affect the low-lying habitats and valleys that the Komodo dragon depends on, as Komodo dragons do not range into the higher-altitude regions of the islands they inhabit. Based on projections, climate change will lead to a decline in suitable habitat of 8.4%, 30.2%, or 71% by 2050 depending on the climate change scenario. Without effective conservation actions, populations on Flores are extirpated in all scenarios, while in the more extreme scenarios, only the populations on Komodo and Rinca persist in highly reduced numbers. Rapid climate change mitigation is crucial for conserving the species in the wild. Other scientists have disputed the conclusions about the effects of climate change on Komodo dragon populations.\nUnder Appendix I of CITES (the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species), commercial international trade of Komodo dragon skins or specimens is prohibited. Despite this, there are occasional reports of illegal attempts to trade in live Komodo dragons. The most recent attempt was in March 2019, when Indonesian police in the East Java city of Surabaya reported that a criminal network had been caught trying to smuggle 41 young Komodo dragons out of Indonesia. The plan was said to include shipping the animals to several other countries in Southeast Asia through Singapore. It was hoped that the animals could be sold for up to 500 million rupiah (around US$35,000) each. It was believed that the Komodo dragons had been smuggled out of East Nusa Tenggara province through the port at Ende in central Flores.\nIn 2013, the total population of Komodo dragons in the wild was assessed as 3,222 individuals, declining to 3,092 in 2014 and 3,014 in 2015. Populations remained relatively stable on the bigger islands (Komodo and Rinca), but decreased on smaller islands, such as Nusa Kode and Gili Motang, likely due to diminishing prey availability. On Padar, a former population of Komodo dragons has recently become extirpated, of which the last individuals were seen in 1975. It is widely assumed that the Komodo dragon died out on Padar following a major decline of populations of large ungulate prey, for which poaching was most likely responsible.\nSince the species is only found in remnant populations in the Wallacean Island, studies have examined the traits and factors that led to these certain populations' surprising persistence. A comprehensive examination of the species survival suggested that rather than being a single attribute, but the a combination including ectotherm traits, varanid biology, habitat, and anthropogenic factors.\nIn captivity.\nKomodo dragons have long been sought-after zoo attractions, where their size and reputation make them popular exhibits. They are, however, rare in zoos because they are susceptible to infection and parasitic disease if captured from the wild, and do not readily reproduce in captivity. A pair of Komodo dragons was displayed at the Bronx Zoo in New York in September 1926, but they only lasted a couple of months, dying in October and November 1926. The first Komodo dragons were displayed at London Zoo in 1927. A Komodo dragon was exhibited in 1934 in the United States at the National Zoo in Washington, D.C., but it lived for only two years. More attempts to exhibit Komodo dragons were made, but the lifespan of the animals in captivity at the time proved very short, averaging five years in the National Zoological Park. Studies were done by Walter Auffenberg, which were documented in his book \"The Behavioral Ecology of the Komodo Monitor\", eventually allowing for more successful management and breeding of the dragons in captivity. Surabaya Zoo in Indonesia has been breeding Komodo dragons since 1990 and had 134 dragons in 2022, the largest collection outside its natural habitat. As of May 2009, there were 35 North American, 13 European, one Singaporean, two African, and two Australian institutions which housed captive Komodo dragons. In 2016, four Komodo dragons were transferred from the Bronx Zoo to Madras Crocodile Bank Trust in India.\nA variety of behaviors have been observed from captive specimens. Most individuals become relatively tame within a short time, and are capable of recognising individual humans and discriminating between familiar and unfamiliar keepers. Komodo dragons have also been observed to engage in play with a variety of objects, including shovels, cans, plastic rings, and shoes. This behavior does not seem to be \"food-motivated predatory behavior\".\nEven seemingly docile dragons may become unpredictably aggressive, especially when the animal's territory is invaded by someone unfamiliar. In June 2001, a Komodo dragon seriously injured Phil Bronstein, the then-husband of actress Sharon Stone, when he entered its enclosure at the Los Angeles Zoo after being invited in by its keeper. Bronstein was bitten on his bare foot, as the keeper had told him to take off his white shoes and socks, which the keeper stated could potentially excite the Komodo dragon as they were the same colour as the white rats the zoo fed the dragon. Although he survived, Bronstein needed to have several tendons in his foot reattached surgically.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Kilns have been used for millennia to turn objects made from clay into pottery, tiles and bricks. Various industries use rotary kilns for pyroprocessing (to calcinate ores, such as limestone to lime for cement) and to transform many other materials.\nEtymology.\nAccording to the Oxford English Dictionary, kiln was derived from the words cyline, cylene, cyln(e) in Old English, in turn derived from Latin \"culina\" ('kitchen'). In Middle English, the word is attested as kulne, kyllne, kilne, kiln, kylle, kyll, kil, kill, keele, kiele. In Greek the word \"\u03ba\u03b1\u03af\u03b5\u03b9\u03bd, kaiein\", means 'to burn'.\nPronunciation.\nThe word 'kiln' was originally pronounced 'kil' with the 'n' silent, as is referenced in \"Webster's Dictionary of 1828\" and in \"English Words as Spoken and Written for Upper Grades\" by James A. Bowen 1900: \"The digraph ln, n silent, occurs in kiln. A fall down the kiln can kill you.\" Bowen was noting that \"kill\" and \"kiln\" are homophones.\nUses of kilns.\nPit fired pottery was produced for thousands of years before the earliest known kiln, which dates to around 6000 BCE, and was found at the Yarim Tepe site in modern Iraq. Neolithic kilns were able to produce temperatures greater than 900\u00a0\u00b0C (1652\u00a0\u00b0F).\nUses include:\nCeramic kilns.\nKilns are an essential part of the manufacture of almost all types of ceramics. Ceramics require high temperatures for chemical and physical reactions to occur that will permanently alter the unfired body. In the case of pottery, clay materials are shaped, dried and then fired in a kiln. The final characteristics are determined by the composition and preparation of the clay body and the temperature at which it is fired. After a first firing, glazes may be used and the ware is fired a second time to fuse the glaze into the body. A third firing at a lower temperature may be required to fix overglaze decoration. Modern kilns often have sophisticated electronic control systems, although pyrometric devices are often also used.\nClay consists of fine-grained particles that are relatively weak and porous. Clay is combined with other minerals to create a workable clay body. The firing process includes sintering. This heats the clay until the particles partially melt and flow together, creating a strong, single mass, composed of a glassy phase interspersed with pores and crystalline material. Through firing, the pores are reduced in size, causing the material to shrink slightly.\nIn the broadest terms, there are two types of kilns: intermittent and continuous, both being an insulate box with a controlled inner temperature and atmosphere.\nA continuous kiln, sometimes called a tunnel kiln, is long with only the central portion directly heated. From the cool entrance, ware is slowly moved through the kiln, and its temperature is increased steadily as it approaches the central, hottest part of the kiln. As it continues through the kiln, the temperature is reduced until the ware exits the kiln nearly at room temperature. A continuous kiln is energy-efficient, because heat given off during cooling is recycled to pre-heat the incoming ware. In some designs, the ware is left in one place, while the heating zone moves across it. Kilns in this type include:\nIn the intermittent kiln, the ware is placed inside the kiln, the kiln is closed, and the internal temperature is increased according to a schedule. After the firing is completed, both the kiln and the ware are cooled. The ware is removed, the kiln is cleaned and the next cycle begins. Kilns in this type include:\nKiln technology is very old. Kilns developed from a simple earthen trench filled with pots and fuel pit firing, to modern methods. One improvement was to build a firing chamber around pots with baffles and a stoking hole. This conserved heat. A chimney stack improved the air flow or \"draw\" of the kiln, thus burning the fuel more completely.\nChinese kiln technology has always been a key factor in the development of Chinese pottery, and until recent centuries was the most advanced in the world. The Chinese developed kilns capable of firing at around 1,000\u00a0\u00b0C before 2000 BCE. These were updraft kilns, often built below ground. Two main types of kiln were developed by about 200 AD and remained in use until modern times. These are the dragon kiln of hilly southern China, usually fuelled by wood, long and thin and running up a slope, and the horseshoe-shaped mantou kiln of the north Chinese plains, smaller and more compact. Both could reliably produce the temperatures of up to 1300\u00a0\u00b0C or more needed for porcelain. In the late Ming, the egg-shaped kiln or \"zhenyao\" was developed at Jingdezhen and mainly used there. This was something of a compromise between the other types, and offered locations in the firing chamber with a range of firing conditions.\nBoth Ancient Roman pottery and medieval Chinese pottery could be fired in industrial quantities, with tens of thousands of pieces in a single firing. Early examples of simpler kilns found in Britain include those that made roof-tiles during the Roman occupation. These kilns were built up the side of a slope, such that a fire could be lit at the bottom and the heat would rise up into the kiln.\nTraditional kilns include:\nModern kilns.\nWith the industrial age, kilns were designed to use electricity and more refined fuels, including natural gas and propane. Many large industrial pottery kilns use natural gas, as it is generally clean, efficient and easy to control. Modern kilns can be fitted with computerized controls allowing for fine adjustments during the firing. A user may choose to control the rate of temperature climb or \"ramp\", \"hold\" or \"soak\" the temperature at any given point, or control the rate of cooling. Both electric and gas kilns are common for smaller scale production in industry and craft, handmade and sculptural work.\nModern kilns include:\nWood-drying kiln.\nGreen wood coming straight from the felled tree has far too high a moisture content to be commercially useful and will rot, warp and split. Both hardwoods and softwood must be left to dry out until the moisture content is between 18% and 8%. This can be a long process unless accelerated by use of a kiln. A variety of kiln technologies exist today: conventional, dehumidification, solar, vacuum and radio frequency.\nConventional wood dry kilns are either package-type (side-loader) or track-type (tram) construction. Most hardwood lumber kilns are side-loader kilns in which fork trucks are used to load lumber packages into the kiln. Most softwood kilns are track types in which the timber is loaded on kiln/track cars for loading the kiln. Modern high-temperature, high-air-velocity conventional kilns can typically dry green wood in 10\u00a0hours down to a moisture content of 18%. However, 25-mm-thick green red oak requires about 28 days to dry down to a moisture content of 8%.\nHeat is typically introduced via steam running through fin/tube heat exchangers controlled by on/off pneumatic valves. Humidity is removed by a system of vents, the specific layout of which are usually particular to a given manufacturer. In general, cool dry air is introduced at one end of the kiln while warm moist air is expelled at the other. Hardwood conventional kilns also require the introduction of humidity via either steam spray or cold water misting systems to keep the relative humidity inside the kiln from dropping too low during the drying cycle. Fan directions are typically reversed periodically to ensure even drying of larger kiln charges.\nMost softwood kilns operate below temperature. Hardwood kiln drying schedules typically keep the dry bulb temperature below . Difficult-to-dry species might not exceed .\nDehumidification kilns are similar to other kilns in basic construction and drying times are usually comparable. Heat comes primarily from an integral dehumidification unit that also removes humidity. Auxiliary heat is often provided early in the schedule to supplement the dehumidifier.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Visible anchor/styles.css\" /&gt;Solar kilns are conventional kilns, typically built by hobbyists to keep initial investment costs low. Heat is provided via solar radiation, while internal air circulation is typically passive.\nVacuum and radio frequency kilns reduce the air pressure to attempt to speed up the drying process. A variety of these vacuum technologies exist, varying primarily in the method heat is introduced into the wood charge. Hot water platten vacuum kilns use aluminum heating plates with the water circulating within as the heat source, and typically operate at significantly reduced absolute pressure. Discontinuous and SSV (super-heated steam) use atmosphere pressure to introduce heat into the kiln charge. The entire kiln charge comes up to full atmospheric pressure, the air in the chamber is then heated and finally a vacuum is pulled as the charge cools. SSV run at partial-atmospheres, typically around 1/3 of full atmospheric pressure, in a hybrid of vacuum and conventional kiln technology (SSV kilns are significantly more popular in Europe where the locally harvested wood is easier to dry than the North American woods.) RF/V (radio frequency + vacuum) kilns use microwave radiation to heat the kiln charge, and typically have the highest operating cost due to the heat of vaporization being provided by electricity rather than local fossil fuel or waste wood sources.\nThe economics of different wood drying technologies are based on the total energy, capital, insurance/risk, environmental impacts, labor, maintenance, and product degradation costs. These costs, which can be a significant part of plant costs, involve the differential impact of the presence of drying equipment in a specific plant. Every piece of equipment from the green trimmer to the infeed system at the planer mill is part of the \"drying system\". The true costs of the drying system can only be determined when comparing the total plant costs and risks with and without drying.\nKiln dried firewood was pioneered during the 1980s, and was later adopted extensively in Europe due to the economic and practical benefits of selling wood with a lower moisture content (with optimal moisture levels of under 20% being much easier to achieve).\nThe total (harmful) air emissions produced by wood kilns, including their heat source, can be significant. Typically, the higher the temperature at which the kiln operates, the larger the quantity of emissions that are produced (per mass unit of water removed). This is especially true in the drying of thin veneers and high-temperature drying of softwoods.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "17362", "revid": "48080796", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=17362", "title": "Kiwi (bird)", "text": "Order of birds\nKiwi are flightless birds endemic to New Zealand of the order Apterygiformes. The five extant species fall into the family Apterygidae and genus Apteryx. Approximately the size of a domestic chicken, kiwi are the smallest ratites (which also include ostriches, emus, rheas, cassowaries and the extinct elephant birds and moa).\nDNA sequence comparisons have yielded the conclusion that kiwi are much more closely related to the extinct Malagasy elephant birds than to the moa with which they shared New Zealand. There are five recognised species, four of which are currently listed as vulnerable, and one of which is near threatened. All species have been negatively affected by historic deforestation, but their remaining habitat is well protected in large forest reserves and national parks. At present, the greatest threat to their survival is predation by invasive mammalian predators.\nThe vestigial wings are so small as to be invisible under their bristly, hair-like, two-branched feathers. Kiwi eggs are one of the largest in proportion to body size (up to 20% of the female's weight) of any order of bird in the world. Other unique adaptations of kiwi, such as short and stout legs and using their nostrils at the end of their long beak to detect prey before they see it, have helped the bird to become internationally well known.\nThe kiwi is recognised as an icon of New Zealand, and the association is so strong that the term \"Kiwi\" is used internationally as the colloquial demonym for New Zealanders.\nEtymology.\nThe M\u0101ori word is generally accepted to be \"of imitative origin\" from its call. Some linguists derive the word from Proto-Nuclear Polynesian *\"kiwi\", which refers to \"Numenius tahitiensis\", the bristle-thighed curlew, a migratory bird that winters in the tropical Pacific islands that kind of resembles with its long decurved bill and brown body. So when the first Polynesian settlers arrived, they may have applied the word kiwi to the newfound bird. Some linguists like Robert Blust however propose that \"kiwi\" originated from Proto-Oceanic name for the Pacific golden plover, *\"kiwiwi\".\nThe bird's name is usually spelled with a lower-case \"k\". It normally stays unchanged when pluralised in English, mirroring its usage in the M\u0101ori language itself. This contrasts with when kiwi is used to refer to a group of New Zealanders, which is typically pluralised as kiwis.\nTaxonomy and systematics.\nThe genus name \"Apteryx\" is derived from Ancient Greek 'without wing': (), 'without' or 'not'; (), 'wing'.\nAlthough it was long presumed that the kiwi was closely related to the other New Zealand ratites, the moa, recent DNA studies have identified its closest relative as the extinct elephant bird of Madagascar, and among extant ratites, the kiwi is more closely related to the emu and the cassowaries than to the moa.\nResearch published in 2013 on an extinct genus, \"Proapteryx\", known from the Miocene deposits of the Saint Bathans Fauna, found that it was smaller and probably capable of flight, supporting the hypothesis that the ancestor of the kiwi reached New Zealand independently from moas, which were already large and flightless by the time kiwi appeared.\nSpecies.\nThere are five known extant species of kiwi, with a number of subspecies. One extinct species is also known.\nDescription.\nTheir adaptation to a terrestrial life is extensive: like all the other ratites (ostrich, emu, rhea and cassowary), they have no keel on the sternum to anchor wing muscles. The vestigial wings are so small that they are invisible under the bristly, hair-like, two-branched feathers. While most adult birds have bones with hollow insides to minimise weight and make flight practicable, kiwi have marrow, like mammals and the young of other birds. Like most other ratites, they have no uropygial gland (preen gland). Their bill is long, pliable and sensitive to touch, and their eyes have a reduced pecten. Their feathers lack barbules and aftershafts, and they have large vibrissae around the gape. They have 13 flight feathers, no tail and a small pygostyle. Their gizzard is weak and their caecum is long and narrow.\nThe eye of the kiwi is the smallest relative to body mass in all avian species, resulting in the smallest visual field as well. The eye has small specialisations for a nocturnal lifestyle, but kiwi rely more heavily on their other senses (auditory, olfactory, and somatosensory system). The sight of the kiwi is so underdeveloped that blind specimens have been observed in nature, showing how little they rely on sight for survival and foraging. In an experiment, it was observed that one-third of a population of \"A. rowi\" in New Zealand under no environmental stress had ocular lesions in one or both eyes. The same experiment examined three specific specimens that showed complete blindness and found them to be in good physical standing outside of ocular abnormalities. A 2018 study revealed that the kiwi's closest relatives, the extinct elephant birds, also shared this trait despite their great size.\nUnlike virtually every other palaeognath, which are generally small-brained by bird standards, kiwi have proportionally large encephalisation quotients. Hemisphere proportions are even similar to those of parrots and songbirds, though there is no evidence of similarly complex behaviour.\nBehaviour and ecology.\nBefore the arrival of humans in the 13th century or earlier, New Zealand's only endemic mammals were , and the ecological niches that in other parts of the world were filled by creatures as diverse as horses, wolves and mice were taken up by birds (and, to a lesser extent, reptiles, insects and gastropods).\nThe kiwi's mostly nocturnal habits may be a result of habitat intrusion by predators, including humans. In areas of New Zealand where introduced predators have been removed, such as sanctuaries, kiwi are often seen in daylight. They prefer subtropical and temperate podocarp and beech forests, but they are being forced to adapt to different habitat, such as sub-alpine scrub, tussock grassland, and the mountains. Kiwi have a highly developed sense of smell, unusual in a bird, and are the only birds with nostrils at the end of their long beaks. Kiwi eat small invertebrates, seeds, grubs, and many varieties of worms. They also may eat fruit, small crayfish, eels and amphibians. Because their nostrils are located at the end of their long beaks, kiwi can locate insects and worms underground using their keen sense of smell, without actually seeing or feeling them. This sense of smell is due to a highly developed olfactory chamber and surrounding regions. It is a common belief that the kiwi relies solely on its sense of smell to catch prey, but this has not been scientifically observed. Lab experiments have suggested that \"A. australis\" can rely on olfaction alone but is not consistent under natural conditions. Instead, the kiwi may rely on auditory and/or vibrotactile cues.\nMating and breeding.\nOnce bonded, a male and female kiwi tend to live their entire lives as a monogamous couple. During the mating season, June to March, the pair call to each other at night, and meet in the nesting burrow every three days. These relationships may last for up to 20\u00a0years. They are unusual among other birds in that, along with some raptors, they have a functioning pair of ovaries. (In most birds and in platypuses, the right ovary never matures, so that only the left is functional.).\nUsually, only one egg is laid per season. The kiwi lays one of the largest eggs in proportion to its size of any bird in the world, so even though the kiwi is about the size of a domestic chicken, it is able to lay eggs that are about six times the size of a chicken's egg. Kiwi eggs can weigh up to one-quarter the weight of the female, helped by their inability to fly that could limit the extent by its body weight; brown kiwi females carry and lay a single egg that may weigh as much as . The eggs are smooth in texture, and are ivory or greenish white. The male incubates the egg, except for the great spotted kiwi, \"A. haastii\", in which both parents are involved. The incubation period is 63\u201392\u00a0days. Producing the huge egg places significant physiological stress on the female; for the thirty days it takes to grow the fully developed egg, the female must eat three times her normal amount of food. Two to three days before the egg is laid there is little space left inside the female for her stomach and she is forced to fast.\nIt was believed that the large eggs were a trait of much larger moa-like ancestors, and that kiwi retained large eggs as an evolutionarily neutral trait as they became smaller. However, research in the early 2010s suggested that kiwi were descended from smaller flighted birds that flew to New Zealand and Madagascar, where they gave rise to kiwi and elephant birds. The large egg is instead thought to be an adaptation for precocity, enabling kiwi chicks to hatch mobile and with yolk to sustain them for two and half weeks. The large eggs would be safe in New Zealand's historical absence of egg-eating ground predators, while the mobile chicks would be able to evade chick-eating flying predators.\nPests.\nLice in the genus \"Apterygon\" and in the subgenus \"Rallicola\" (\"Aptericola\") are exclusively ectoparasites of kiwi species.\nStatus and conservation.\nNationwide studies show that only around 5\u201310% of kiwi chicks survive to adulthood without management. As of 2018[ [update]] over 70% of kiwi populations are unmanaged. However, in areas under active pest management, survival rates for North Island brown kiwi can be far higher. For example, prior to a joint 1080 poison operation undertaken by DOC and the Animal Health Board in Tongariro Forest in 2006, 32 kiwi chicks were radio-tagged. \nEfforts to protect kiwi have had some success, and in 2017 two species were downlisted from endangered to vulnerable by the IUCN. In 2018 the Department of Conservation released its current Kiwi Conservation Plan.\nSanctuaries.\nIn 2000, the Department of Conservation set up five kiwi sanctuaries focused on developing methods to protect kiwi and to increase their numbers.\nThere are three kiwi sanctuaries in the North Island:\n*Whangarei Kiwi Sanctuary (for Northland brown kiwi)\n*Moehau Kiwi Sanctuary on the Coromandel Peninsula (Coromandel brown kiwi)\n*Tongariro Kiwi Sanctuary near Taup\u014d (western brown kiwi)\nand two in the South Island:\n*Okarito Kiwi Sanctuary (Okarito kiwi)\n*Haast Kiwi Sanctuary (Haast tokoeka)\nA number of other mainland conservation islands and fenced sanctuaries have significant populations of kiwi, including:\nNorth Island brown kiwi were introduced to the Cape Sanctuary in Hawke's Bay between 2008 and 2011, which in turn provided captive-raised chicks that were released back into Maungataniwha Native Forest.\nSanctuaries for kiwi are also referred to as 'k\u014dhanga sites' from the M\u0101ori word for 'nest' or 'nursery'.\nOperation Nest Egg.\nOperation Nest Egg is a programme run by the BNZ Save the Kiwi Trust\u2014a partnership between the Bank of New Zealand, the Department of Conservation and the Royal Forest and Bird Protection Society. Kiwi eggs and chicks are removed from the wild and hatched and/or raised in captivity until big enough to fend for themselves\u2014usually when they weigh around 1200\u00a0grams (42\u00a0ounces). They are then returned to the wild. An Operation Nest Egg bird has a 65% chance of surviving to adulthood\u2014compared to just 5% for wild-hatched and -raised chicks. The tool is used on all kiwi species except little spotted kiwi.\n1080 poison.\nIn 2004, anti-1080 activist Phillip Anderton posed for the New Zealand media with a kiwi he claimed had been poisoned. An investigation revealed that Anderton lied to journalists and the public. He had used a kiwi that had been caught in a possum trap. Extensive monitoring shows that kiwi are not at risk from the use of biodegradable 1080 poison.\nThreats.\nIntroduced mammalian predators, namely stoats, dogs, ferrets, and cats, are the principal threats to kiwi. The biggest threat to kiwi chicks is stoats, while dogs are the biggest threat to adult kiwi. Stoats are responsible for approximately half of kiwi chick deaths in many areas through New Zealand. Young kiwi chicks are vulnerable to stoat predation until they reach about in weight, at which time they can usually defend themselves. Cats also to a lesser extent prey on kiwi chicks. These predators can cause large and abrupt declines in populations. In particular, dogs find the distinctive strong scent of kiwi irresistible and easy to track, such that they can catch and kill kiwi in seconds. Motor vehicle strike is a threat to all kiwi where roads cross through their habitat. Badly set possum traps often kill or maim kiwi.\nHabitat destruction is another major threat to kiwi; restricted distribution and small size of some kiwi populations increases their vulnerability to inbreeding. Research has shown that the combined effect of predators and other mortality (accidents, etc.) results in less than 5% of kiwi chicks surviving to adulthood.\nRelationship to humans.\nThe M\u0101ori traditionally believed that kiwi were under the protection of T\u0101ne Mahuta, god of the forest. They were used as food and their feathers were used for kahu kiwi\u2014ceremonial cloaks. Today, while kiwi feathers are still used, they are gathered from birds that die naturally, through road accidents, or predation, and from captive birds. Kiwi are no longer hunted and some M\u0101ori consider themselves the birds' guardians.\nScientific documentation.\nIn 1813, George Shaw named the genus \"Apteryx\" in his species description of the southern brown kiwi, which he called \"the southern apteryx\". Captain Andrew Barclay of the ship \"Providence\" provided Shaw with the specimen. Shaw's description was accompanied by two plates, engraved by Frederick Polydore Nodder; they were published in volume 24 of \"The Naturalist's Miscellany\".\nZoos.\nIn 1851, London Zoo became the first zoo to keep kiwi. The first captive breeding took place in 1945. As of 2007 only 13 zoos outside New Zealand hold kiwi. The Frankfurt Zoo has 12, the Berlin Zoo has seven, Walsrode Bird Park has one, the Avifauna Bird Park in the Netherlands has three, the San Diego Zoo has five, the San Diego Zoo Safari Park has one, the National Zoo in Washington, DC has eleven, the Smithsonian Conservation Biology Institute has one, and the Columbus Zoo and Aquarium has three.\nIn 2023, Zoo Miami apologised for mistreating a kiwi, after footage of visitors patting the nocturnal bird under bright lights caused outrage in New Zealand.\nAs a national symbol.\nThe kiwi as a symbol first appeared in the late 19th century in New Zealand regimental badges. It was later featured in the badges of the South Canterbury Battalion in 1886 and the Hastings Rifle Volunteers in 1887. Soon after, the kiwi appeared in many military badges; and in 1906, when Kiwi Shoe Polish was widely sold in the UK and the US, the symbol became more widely known.\nDuring the First World War, the name \"Kiwis\" for New Zealand soldiers came into general use, and a giant kiwi (now known as the Bulford kiwi) was carved on the chalk hill above Sling Camp in England. Usage has become so widespread that all New Zealanders overseas and at home are now commonly referred to as \"Kiwis\".\nThe kiwi has since become the best-known national symbol for New Zealand, and the bird is prominent in the coat of arms, crests and badges of many New Zealand cities, clubs and organisations. At the national level, the red silhouette of a kiwi is in the centre of the roundel of the Royal New Zealand Air Force. The kiwi is featured in the logo of the New Zealand Rugby League, and the New Zealand national rugby league team are nicknamed the Kiwis.\nA kiwi has featured on the reverse side of three New Zealand coins: the one florin (two-shilling) coin from 1933 to 1966, the twenty-cent coin from 1967 to 1990, and the one-dollar coin since 1991. In currency trading the New Zealand dollar is often referred to as \"the kiwi\".\nIn popular culture.\nA song, \"Sticky Beak the Kiwi\", with words by Bob Edwards and music by Neil Roberts, was recorded in 1961, sung by Julie Nelson (aged 14) and accompanied by the Satins and the Don Bell Orchestra of Whang\u0101rei. A Christmas song, it portrays Sticky Beak as insisting on pulling Santa Claus's sleigh when distributing presents south of the equator. \n\"How the Kiwi Lost its Wings\" is a fable written by broadcaster Alwyn Owen in 1963. It uses elements of M\u0101ori mythology, such as T\u0101ne Mahuta, and the World War I symbol of cowardice, white feathers, in a pourquoi story explaining features of New Zealand birds. Owen portrays the kiwi as nobly sacrificing its wings and flight in order to protect the trees from depredation by ground-dwelling creatures, and thereby winning its unique renown. Owen's story is sometimes described as \"A Maori Legend\". It has been recorded as a children's story, published as a book, was made into an animated film in 1980, set to music for the Auckland Philharmonia Orchestra by Thomas Goss as \"T\u0101ne and the Kiwi\" in 2002 (recorded for RNZ by Orchestra Wellington in 2008), and performed as a ballet by the Royal New Zealand Ballet in 2022.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The most common cultivar group of kiwifruit (\"Actinidia chinensis\" var. \"deliciosa\" 'Hayward') is oval, about the size of a large hen's egg: in length and in diameter. Kiwifruit has a thin, fuzzy, fibrous, light brown skin that is tart but edible, and light green or golden flesh that contains rows of tiny black edible seeds. The fruit has a soft texture with a sweet and unique flavour.\nKiwifruit is native to central and eastern China, with the first recorded description dating back to the 12th century during the Song dynasty. In the early 20th century, cultivation of kiwifruit spread from China to New Zealand, where the first commercial plantings took place. It gained popularity among British and American servicemen stationed in New Zealand during World War II, and later became commonly exported, first to the United Kingdom and Australia from 1953, followed by California in 1959.\nFrom the late 20th century, countries beyond New Zealand initiated independent kiwifruit breeding programmes, including China and Italy. As of 2023, China accounted for 55% of the world's total kiwifruit production, making it the largest global producer.\nEtymology.\nEarly varieties were discovered and cultivated in China. Common Chinese names for the fruit prior to the 20th century include (, 'macaque peach'), (, 'fox peach'), (, 'vine pear') and (, 'sheep peach'). Among the early English language names for the fruit were yangtao, the name that was in popular use in the Yangtze River valley areas of central China, Wilson's gooseberry (after British plant collector Ernest Henry Wilson), gooseberry vine, and Ichang gooseberry, the latter referring to Yichang, a port city in Hubei province. The first known reference to the name Chinese gooseberry comes from 1917 in New Zealand, but it is likely that the name was in use before this time. By the 1920s, Chinese gooseberry became the standard name for the fruit in English until the 1950s. In modern-day Chinese, the fruit is often referred to as (), a transliteration from English.\nIn 1959, Turners &amp; Growers, a major New Zealand exporter, began calling it \"kiwifruit\" after being advised by a United States client, Norman Sondag, that products with the name gooseberry may have been having difficulty passing through quarantine. Sondag believed that quarantine officials were more suspicious of European gooseberries and other berry shipments, due to fears that berries that were grown closer to the ground could come into contact with soil contaminated with anthrax-causing \"Bacillus anthracis\", something that was not an issue with kiwifruit. The name \"kiwifruit\" was coined by Jack Turner of Turners &amp; Growers, referencing kiwi, an informal name used to describe New Zealanders, which Turner felt that United States servicemen stationed in the Pacific during World War II would have fond associations with. The name was first registered by Turners &amp; Growers on 15 June 1959, and by 1970, all exports from New Zealand used the name kiwifruit.\nNumerous myths are associated with the naming of kiwifruit, including that it is a reference to New Zealand's furry, brown, national bird \u2013 the kiwi, or that the name Chinese gooseberry was replaced in response to anti-Chinese sentiment in the United States.\nIn New Zealand and Australia, the word \"kiwi\" alone either refers to the bird or is used as a nickname for New Zealanders. Kiwifruit has since become a common name for all commercially grown kiwifruit from the genus \"Actinidia\". In the United States and Canada, the shortened name \"kiwi\" is commonly used when referring to the fruit.\nHistory.\nKiwifruit is native to central and eastern China. The first identifiable description of a plant as \"Actinidia chinensis\" is from a Tang dynasty poem by Cen Shen, which describes a mihoutao plant growing above a well in modern-day Shaanxi. The first recorded description of the kiwifruit dates to 12th century China during the Song dynasty. As it was usually collected from the wild and consumed for medicinal purposes, the plant was rarely cultivated or bred. Cultivation of kiwifruit spread from China in the early 20th century to New Zealand, where the first commercial plantings occurred. After the Hayward variety was developed, the fruit became popular with British and American servicemen stationed in New Zealand during World War II. Kiwifruits were exported to Great Britain and Australia from 1953, and then to California from 1959.\nIn New Zealand during the 1940s and 1950s, the fruit became an agricultural commodity through the development of commercially viable cultivars, agricultural practices, shipping, storage, and marketing. In the 1970s, New Zealand's kiwifruit industry experienced significant growth. To support this expansion, the Kiwifruit Export Promotion Committee was established in 1970 to coordinate marketing efforts and later, in 1977, the Kiwifruit Marketing Licensing Authority was formed to set market standards and advise the government, giving growers some control over licensing exporters. The New Zealand Kiwifruit Marketing Board was later renamed Zespri International Limited in 1997. This rebranding marked a strategic move to enhance global recognition and market presence.\nIn 1978, China established the National Cooperative Group for Kiwifruit Research, launching a nationwide survey of wild Actinidia germplasm. This effort led to the selection of over 1,400 candidate cultivars. By the early 1980s, China began cultivating kiwifruit commercially, initially planting less than one hectare with the 'Hayward' cultivar from New Zealand. Over the following decades, China's kiwifruit industry expanded significantly, and by 2020, 'Hayward' accounted for only 6.3% of total plantings, as domestically bred cultivars gained prominence.\nAmong these are 'Hongyang', a red-fleshed kiwifruit selected in Sichuan from seedlings raised from wild-collected seeds, 'Jinyan', a yellow-fleshed variety, and 'Donghong', another red-fleshed cultivar, also known as Oriental Red.\nThe Wuhan Botanical Garden of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) plays a key role in China's kiwifruit conservation and breeding. It houses the world's largest kiwifruit gene bank, with 73 validated or protected varieties and 426 high-quality strains, including Donghong, Jinyan, and Jintao. In 2001, it sold exclusive breeding rights for Jintao to the Italian company Jingold, and in 2012, a collaboration with Jingold resulted in the development and patenting of the Jinyan and Donghong cultivars.\nSpecies and cultivars.\nThe genus \"Actinidia\" comprises around 60 species. Their fruits are quite variable, although most are easily recognised as kiwifruit because of their appearance and shape. The skin of the fruit varies in size, hairiness, and colour. The flesh varies in colour, juiciness, texture, and taste. Some fruits are unpalatable, while others taste considerably better than most commercial cultivars.\nThe most commonly sold kiwifruit is derived from \"Actinidia chinensis\" var. \"deliciosa\" (fuzzy green kiwifruit) and \"A. chinensis\" var. \"chinensis\" (golden and red kiwifruit). Other species that are commonly eaten include \"A. arguta\" (hardy kiwifruit, also known as kiwiberries), \"A. rubricaulis\" var. \"coriacea\" (Chinese egg gooseberry), , \"A. kolomikta\" (Arctic kiwifruit), \"A. melanandra\" (purple kiwifruit) and \"A. polygama\" (silver vine). Some commercial cultivars are hybrids, such as 'Jinyan', which is a hybrid of \"A. eriantha\" and \"A. chinensis\" var. \"chinensis\", and 'Issai', a hybrid of \"A. arguta\" and \"A. polygama\", known for having relative large fruit, the ability to self-pollinate, and being less hardy than most \"A. arguta\".\nFuzzy kiwifruit.\nMost kiwifruit sold belongs to a few cultivars of \"Actinidia chinensis \"var. \"deliciosa\" (fuzzy kiwifruit): 'Hayward', 'Blake' and 'Saanichton 12'. They have a fuzzy, dull brown skin and bright green flesh. The familiar cultivar 'Hayward' was developed by Hayward Wright in Avondale, New Zealand, around 1924. It was initially grown in domestic gardens, but commercial planting began in the 1940s.\n'Hayward' is the most commonly available cultivar in stores. It is a large, egg-shaped fruit with a sweet flavour. 'Saanichton 12', from British Columbia, is somewhat more rectangular than 'Hayward' and comparably sweet, but the inner core of the fruit can be tough. 'Blake' can self-pollinate, but has a smaller, more oval fruit, and the flavour is considered inferior.\nKiwiberries.\nKiwiberries are edible fruits the size of a large grape, similar to fuzzy kiwifruit in taste and internal appearance but with a thin, smooth green skin. They are primarily produced by three species: \"Actinidia arguta\" (hardy kiwi), \"A. kolomikta\" (Arctic kiwifruit) and \"A. polygama\" (silver vine). They are fast-growing, climbing vines, durable over their growing season. They are referred to as kiwi berry, baby kiwi, dessert kiwi, grape kiwi, or cocktail kiwi.\nGold kiwifruit.\nThe gold kiwifruit, also known as the yellow kiwi or golden kiwifruit, has smooth, bronze skin, with a beak shape at the stem attachment. Gold varieties are typically cultivars of \"Actinidia chinensis\" var. \"chinensis\". The flesh colour varies from bright green to a clear, intense yellow. This species is 'sweeter and more aromatic' in flavour compared to \"Actinidia chinensis \"var. \"deliciosa\". One of the most attractive varieties has a red 'iris' around the centre of the fruit and yellow flesh outside. The yellow fruit obtains a higher market price and, being less hairy than the fuzzy kiwifruit, tastes better without peeling.\nHort16A is a golden kiwifruit cultivar developed by HortResearch, now Plant &amp; Food Research Institute, during the 1980s and 90s. It is marketed worldwide as \"Zespri Gold\". This cultivar suffered significant losses in New Zealand in 2010\u20132013 due to the PSA bacterium. A new cultivar of golden kiwifruit, \"Gold3\", was found to be more disease-resistant, and most growers have now changed to this cultivar. 'Gold3', marketed by Zespri as \"SunGold\" is not quite as sweet as 'Hort16A', and lacks its usually slightly pointed tip. Clones of the new variety \"SunGold\" have been used to develop orchards in China, resulting in partially successful legal efforts in China by Zespri to protect their intellectual property. In 2021, Zespri estimated that around 5,000 hectares of \"Sungold\" orchards were being cultivated in China, mainly in the Sichuan province.\nJintao is a variety of golden kiwifruit developed in China from wild \"Actinidia chinensis\" var. \"chinensis\" vines. Created in the 1980s by researchers at the Wuhan Botanical Garden, it was introduced to Europe for evaluation in 1998 through an EU-funded project (INCO-DC). Between 1998 and 2000, it was evaluated in collaboration with institutions such as I.N.R.A. in Bordeaux (France), the University of Thessaloniki (Greece), and the University of Udine (Italy). Jintao was later released to European kiwifruit growers for commercial propagation in 2001. In the same year, exclusive breeding rights for the variety were sold to the Italian company Jingold, and production subsequently expanded to multiple locations across Portugal, Chile, Argentina, and South Africa over the following two decades.\nRed kiwifruit.\nRed kiwifruits are cultivars of \"Actinidia chinensis\" var. \"chinensis\", distinguished by their red coloured flesh. Its origin can be traced back to China from a natural mutation of gold kiwifruit found in the wild in 1982, which became the Hongyang variety, China's first commercially viable red kiwifruit cultivar. By 2020, Hongyang became the most grown kiwifruit cultivar in China across all types and varieties.\nInternational varieties include Oriental Red, a licensed version of Donghong variety kiwifruit grown in Italy, Zespri RubyRed, which was independently bred in New Zealand in 2007, and EnzaRed, a cultivar that descends from the Hongyang variety grown by Turners &amp; Growers in New Zealand.\nCultivation.\nKiwifruit can be grown in most temperate climates with adequate summer heat. Where fuzzy kiwifruit (\"Actinidia chinensis var. deliciosa\") is not hardy, other species can be grown as substitutes.\nBreeding.\nOften in commercial farming, different breeds are used for rootstock, fruit-bearing plants, and pollinators. Therefore, the seeds produced are crossbreeds of their parents. Even if the same breeds are used for pollinators and fruit-bearing plants, there is no guarantee that the fruit will have the same quality as the parent. Additionally, seedlings take seven years before they flower, so determining whether the kiwifruit is fruit bearing or a pollinator is time-consuming. Therefore, most kiwifruits, except rootstock and new cultivars, are propagated asexually. This is done by grafting the fruit-producing plant onto rootstock grown from seedlings or, if the plant is desired to be a true cultivar, rootstock grown from cuttings of a mature plant.\nPollination.\nKiwifruit plants generally are dioecious, meaning a plant is either male or female. The male plants have flowers that produce pollen, the females receive the pollen to fertilise their ovules and grow fruit; most kiwifruit requires a male plant to pollinate the female plant. For a good yield of fruit, one male vine for every three to eight female vines is considered adequate. Some varieties can self-pollinate, but even they produce a greater and more reliable yield when pollinated by male kiwifruit. Cross-species pollination is often (but not always) successful as long as bloom times are synchronised.\nIn nature, the species are pollinated by birds and native bumblebees, which visit the flowers for pollen, not nectar. The female flowers produce fake anthers with what appears to be pollen on the tips to attract the pollinators, although these fake anthers lack the DNA and food value of the male anthers.\nKiwifruit growers rely on honey bees, the principal 'for-hire' pollinator, but commercially grown kiwifruit is notoriously difficult to pollinate. The flowers are not very attractive to honey bees, partly because the flowers do not produce nectar, and bees quickly learn to prefer flowers with nectar.\nHoney bees are inefficient cross-pollinators for kiwifruit because they practice \"floral fidelity\". Each honey bee visits only a single type of flower in any foray and maybe only a few branches of a single plant. The pollen needed from a different plant (such as a male for a female kiwifruit) might never reach it were it not for the cross-pollination that principally occurs in the crowded colony; it is in the colonies that bees laden with different pollen cross paths.\nTo deal with these pollination challenges, some producers blow collected pollen over the female flowers. Most common, though, is saturation pollination, in which the honey bee populations are made so large (by placing hives in the orchards at a concentration of about 8 hives per hectare) that bees are forced to use this flower because of intense competition for all flowers within flight distance.\nMaturation and harvest.\nKiwifruit is picked by hand and commercially grown on sturdy support structures, as it can produce several tonnes per hectare, more than the rather weak vines can support. These are generally equipped with a watering system for irrigation and frost protection in the spring.\nKiwifruit vines require vigorous pruning, similar to that of grapevines. Fruit is borne on 'one-year-old and older' canes, but production declines as each cane ages. Canes should be pruned off and replaced after their third year. In the northern hemisphere, the fruit ripens in November, while in the southern hemisphere it ripens in May. Four-year-old plants can produce 15 tonnes of fruit per hectare (14,000 lb per acre) while eight-year-old plants can produce 20 tonnes (18,000 lb per acre). The plants produce their maximum at eight to ten years old. The seasonal yields are variable; a heavy crop on a vine one season generally comes with a light crop the following season.\nStorage.\nFruit harvested when firm will ripen when stored properly for long periods. This allows fruit to be stored for up to 8 weeks after harvest.\nFirm kiwifruits ripen after a few days to a week when stored at room temperature, but should not be kept in direct sunlight. Faster ripening occurs when placed in a paper bag with an apple, a pear, or a banana. Once a kiwifruit is ripe, however, it is preserved optimally when stored far from other fruits, as it is sensitive to the ethylene gas they may emit, thereby tending to over-ripen even in the refrigerator. If stored appropriately, ripe kiwifruit is normally kept for about one to two weeks.\nPests and diseases.\n\"Pseudomonas syringae\" pv. \"actinidiae\" (PSA) was first identified in Japan in the 1980s. This bacterial strain has been controlled and managed successfully in orchards in Asia. In 1992, it was found in northern Italy. In 2007/2008, economic losses were observed, as a more virulent strain became more dominant (PSA V). In 2010 it was found in New Zealand's Bay of Plenty Region kiwifruit orchards in the North Island. The yellow-fleshed cultivars were particularly susceptible. New, resistant varieties were selected in research funded by the government and fruit growers so that the industry could continue.\nScientists reported they had worked out that the strain of PSA affecting kiwifruit from New Zealand, Italy, and Chile originated in China.\nEarly sex identification.\nIn 2020, the Wuhan Botanical Research Institute of the Chinese Academy of Sciences patented a method for the early identification of the sex of kiwifruit plants.\nKiwifruit plants are dioecious, meaning they have separate male and female plants. Crosses between male and female genotypes typically produce male and female offspring in a 1:1 ratio, regardless of ploidy level. Since only female plants bear fruit, male plants are unproductive in commercial breeding programmes, though they are required for pollination to produce the desired amount of fruit. Maintaining male seedlings beyond the sex ratio required for pollination (one male vine for every three to eight female vines) consumes land, labour, and resources without contributing to fruit yield. The breeding process is further hindered by the species' long generation cycle, spanning at least three growing seasons and a period of winter dormancy. Managing large breeding populations over extended periods is resource-intensive, especially for fruit crops like kiwifruit, which require expensive support infrastructure.\nTo address these challenges, there is a pressing need for sex-linked molecular markers. Early identification of plant sex at the seedling stage enables the efficient removal of male plants, reducing resource waste and improving breeding efficiency.\nProduction.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Table alignment/tables.css\" /&gt;\nIn 2023, world kiwifruit production was 4.4 million tonnes, led by China with 55% of the total (table). In China, kiwifruit is grown mainly in the mountainous area upstream of the Yangtze River, as well as Sichuan. Other major producers were New Zealand and Italy (table).\nProduction history.\nNew Zealand.\nKiwifruit exports rapidly increased from the late 1960s to the early 1970s in New Zealand. By 1976, exports exceeded the amount consumed domestically. Outside of Australasia, New Zealand kiwifruit are marketed under the brand-name label Zespri. The general name, \"Zespri\", has been used for the marketing of all cultivars of kiwifruit from New Zealand since 2012. In 1990, the New Zealand Kiwifruit Marketing Board opened an office for Europe in Antwerp, Belgium.\nItaly.\nIn the 1980s, Italy began cultivating and exporting kiwifruit, leveraging its existing grape-growing infrastructure and techniques. Italy developed yellow-fleshed cultivars, including \"Soreli\" and \"Dor\u00ec\". Its proximity to the European market further boosted production, and by 1989, Italy had become the world's leading kiwifruit producer. Italy's growing season does not significantly overlap with those of New Zealand or Chile, reducing direct competition with these major exporters.\nChina.\nIn 1978, China began developing its own kiwifruit cultivars. The Wuhan Botanical Garden, part of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS), played a large role in breeding and improving domestic varieties suited to local conditions. Commercial cultivation initially began in the early 1980s on less than one hectare using the Hayward variety from New Zealand. But by 2020, kiwifruit orchards had expanded to 290,000 hectares, and 'Hayward' accounted for only 6.3% of the total planting area, as domestically bred varieties gained prominence. To support commercialisation and branding, CASGOLD, the first CAS-backed agricultural brand, was created. By 2023, China had become the world's largest kiwifruit producer, surpassing Italy and New Zealand. However, most of its kiwifruit is consumed domestically, with little exported.\nHuman consumption.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Stack/styles.css\"/&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Stack/styles.css\"/&gt;\nKiwifruit may be eaten raw, made into juices, used in baked goods, prepared with meat, or used as a garnish. The whole fruit, including the skin, is suitable for human consumption; however, the skin of the fuzzy varieties is often discarded due to its texture. Sliced kiwifruit is often used as a garnish on top of whipped cream on pavlova, a meringue-based dessert. Traditionally in China, kiwifruit was not eaten for pleasure but was given as medicine to children to help them grow and to women who had given birth to help them recover.\nRaw kiwifruit contains actinidain (also spelled \"actinidin\") which is commercially useful as a meat tenderiser and possibly as a digestive aid. Actinidain also makes raw kiwifruit unsuitable for use in desserts containing milk or any other dairy products because the enzyme digests milk proteins. This applies to gelatin-based desserts since the actinidain will dissolve the proteins in gelatin, causing the dessert to either liquefy or prevent it from solidifying.\nNutrition.\nIn a amount, green kiwifruit provides of food energy, is 83% water and 15% carbohydrates, with negligible protein and fat (table). It is particularly rich in vitamin C (103% DV), vitamin K (34% DV), and potassium, and has a moderate content of vitamin E (10% DV) and copper, with no other micronutrients in significant content. Gold kiwifruit has similar nutritional value to green kiwifruit, but contains higher vitamin C content (179% DV) and insignificant vitamin K content (table). Both types of kiwifruit are rich in dietary fibre.\nKiwifruit seed oil contains, on average, 62% alpha-linolenic acid, an omega-3 fatty acid. Kiwifruit pulp contains carotenoids, such as provitamin A beta-carotene, lutein and zeaxanthin.\nHealth benefits.\nKiwifruit (\"Actinidia deliciosa\", particularly the green Hayward variety) is nutrient-dense, providing vitamin C, dietary fibre, vitamin E, vitamin K, potassium, folate, copper, and diverse antioxidants (carotenoids, polyphenols).\nRandomised controlled evidence indicates that consuming two green kiwifruits (approximately 200 g) daily improves stool frequency and gastrointestinal comfort in adults with constipation.\nThe proteolytic enzyme actinidin present in green kiwifruit may facilitate upper-tract protein digestion; in older adults, co-ingestion of Hayward kiwifruit with beef accelerated the appearance of essential amino acids in plasma compared with a low-actinidin gold variety.\nIn July 2025, following a positive scientific opinion from the European Food Safety Authority (2021), the European Commission authorised the first health claim for a fresh fruit: \"consumption of green kiwifruit contributes to normal bowel function by increasing stool frequency,\" when at least 200 g of fresh Hayward green kiwifruit are consumed daily.\nAllergies.\nAllergy to kiwifruit was first described in 1981 and there have since been reports of the allergy presenting with numerous symptoms from localised oral allergy syndrome to life-threatening anaphylaxis.\nThe enzyme actinidain found in kiwifruit can be an allergen for some individuals, with the most common symptoms ranging from an unpleasant itching and soreness of the mouth to wheezing as the most common severe symptom.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It runs through the German state of Schleswig-Holstein, from Brunsb\u00fcttel, at the mouth of the Elbe, to Holtenau, on the Kiel Fjord. It was constructed between 1887 and 1895 and widened between 1907 and 1914. In addition to the two sea entrances, the canal is linked at Oldenb\u00fcttel to the navigable River Eider by the short Gieselau Canal.\nThe canal reduces the journey between the North and Baltic Seas by by allowing ships to bypass the Jutland peninsula and the Danish straits. It is one of the world's most frequented artificial waterways, with an annual average of 32,000 ships (90 daily), transporting approximately 100 million tonnes of goods.\nHistory.\nThe first connection between the North and Baltic Seas was constructed while the area was ruled by Denmark\u2013Norway. It was called the Eider Canal and used stretches of the Eider River for the link between the two seas. Completed during the reign of Christian VII of Denmark in 1784, the was a part of a waterway from Kiel to the Eider River's mouth at T\u00f6nning on the west coast. It was only wide with a depth of , which limited the vessels that could use the canal to 300 tonnes.\nAfter 1864, the Second Schleswig War put Schleswig-Holstein under the government of Prussia (from 1871 the German Empire). A new canal was sought by merchants and by the German navy, which wanted to link its bases in the Baltic and the North Sea without the need to sail around Denmark.\nConstruction and expansion.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Stack/styles.css\"/&gt;\nIn June 1887, construction started at Holtenau, near Kiel. The canal took over 9,000 workers eight years to build. On 20 June 1895, Kaiser Wilhelm II officially opened the canal for transiting from Brunsb\u00fcttel to Holtenau. The next day a ceremony took place in Holtenau, where Wilhelm II named the waterway the (after his grandfather, Kaiser Wilhelm I), and laid the final stone. British director Birt Acres filmed the opening of the canal; the Science Museum in London preserves surviving footage of this early film. The first vessel to pass through the canal was the aviso , sent through in late April (before the canal officially opened) to determine if it was ready for use. In May, the tender also passed through the canal.\nTo cope with the increasing traffic and the demands of the Imperial German Navy, between 1907 and 1914 the canal was widened by Germany to allow dreadnought battleships to pass through, allowing them to travel between the Baltic Sea and the North Sea without having to go around Denmark. Two larger canal locks in Brunsb\u00fcttel and Holtenau were installed to complete the enlargement.\nAfter World War I.\nAfter World War I, the Treaty of Versailles required the canal to be open to vessels of commerce and of war of any nation at peace with Germany, while leaving it under German administration. (The United States opposed this proposal to avoid setting a precedent for similar concessions on the Panama Canal.) The government under Adolf Hitler repudiated its international status in 1936, but the canal was reopened to all traffic after World War II. In 1948, the current name was adopted.\nThe canal was partially closed for a period in March 2013 after two lock gates failed at the western end near Brunsb\u00fcttel. Ships larger than were forced to navigate via Skagerrak, a detour. The failure was blamed on neglect and a lack of funding by the German Federal Government, which had been in financial dispute with the state of Schleswig-Holstein regarding the canal. Germany's Federal Transport Ministry promised rapid repairs.\nLater Expansion.\nThe western part of the canal was widened and deepened in projects that took place from 1965 to 2001. A major widening and deepening of the eastern part of the canal began in 2020, with the first section, about 4 kilometers long, opened on 10 November, 2025. Five additional sections are to be expanded.\nOperation.\nThe canal is governed by detailed traffic rules. Each vessel using the canal is categorized into one of six traffic groups according to its dimensions. Larger ships are obliged to accept pilots and specialized canal helmsmen, in some cases even the assistance of a tugboat. Furthermore, there are regulations regarding the passing of oncoming ships. Larger ships may also be required to moor at the bollards provided at intervals along the canal to allow the passage of oncoming vessels. Special rules apply to pleasure craft.\nAll permanent, fixed bridges crossing the canal since its construction have a clearance of .\nMaximum length for ships passing the Kiel Canal is , with the maximum width (beam) of ; these ships can have a draught of up to . Ships up to a length of may have a draught up to . The bulker \"Ever Leader\" (deadweight 74001 t) is considered to be the cargo ship that to date has come closest to the overall limits.\nCrossings.\nSeveral railway lines and federal roads (Autobahnen and Bundesstra\u00dfen) cross the canal, on eleven fixed links. The bridges have a clearance of , allowing for ship heights up to . The oldest bridge still in use is the Levensau High Bridge, completed in 1894; however, it will be replaced in the course of a canal expansion already underway. In sequence and in the direction of the official kilometre count from west (Brunsb\u00fcttel) to east (Holtenau) these crossings are:\nLocal traffic is also served by 14 ferry lines. Most noteworthy is the \u201changing ferry\u201d (, literally: \"hovering ferry\") that is hanging underneath the \"Rendsburg High Bridge\". This hanging ferry was replaced after a collision with a ship in 2016, and returned to service in 2022. All ferries are run by the Canal Authority and their use is free of charge.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Bloch received the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1964 (joint with Feodor Lynen) for discoveries concerning the mechanism and regulation of the cholesterol and fatty acid metabolism.\nLife and career.\nBloch was born in Neisse (now Nysa, Poland), in the German Empire's Prussian Province of Silesia into a Jewish family. He was the second child of middle-class parents Hedwig (Striemer) and Frederich D. \"Fritz\" Bloch. He was a student at the Gymnasium Carolinum in Nysa and then 1930 to 1934, he studied chemistry at the Technical University of Munich. In 1934, due to the Nazi persecutions of Jews, he fled to the \"Schweizerische Forschungsinstitut\" in Davos, Switzerland, before moving to the United States in 1936. Later he was appointed to the department of biological chemistry at Yale Medical School.\nIn the United States, Bloch enrolled at Columbia University, and received a PhD in biochemistry in 1938. He taught at Columbia from 1939 to 1946. From there he went to the University of Chicago and then to Harvard University as Higgins Professor of Biochemistry in 1954, a post he held until 1982. From 1979 until 1984, he was a professor of science at their School of Public Health. After retirement at Harvard, he served as the Mack and Effie Campbell Tyner Eminent Scholar Chair in the College of Human Sciences at Florida State University.\nBloch shared the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1964 with his compatriat Feodor Lynen, for their discoveries concerning the mechanism and regulation of the cholesterol and fatty acid metabolism. Their work showed that the body first makes squalene from acetate over many steps and then converts the squalene to cholesterol. He traced all the carbon atoms in cholesterol back to acetate. Some of his research was conducted using radioactive acetate in bread mold: this was possible because fungi also produce squalene. He confirmed his results using rats. He was one of several researchers who showed that acetyl Coenzyme A is turned into mevalonic acid. Both Bloch and Lynen then showed that mevalonic acid is converted into chemically active isoprene, the precursor to squalene. Bloch also discovered that bile and a female sex hormone were made from cholesterol, which led to the discovery that all steroids were made from cholesterol. His Nobel Lecture was \"The Biological Synthesis of Cholesterol.\"\nIn 1985, Bloch became a Fellow of the Royal Society. In 1988, he was awarded the National Medal of Science. He was an elected member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, the United States National Academy of Sciences, and the American Philosophical Society.\nBloch and his wife Lore Teutsch first met in Munich. They married in the U.S. in 1941. They had two children, Peter Conrad Bloch and Susan Elizabeth Bloch, and two grandchildren, Benjamin Nieman Bloch and Emilie Bloch Sondel. They lived for many decades in the mid-century modern enclave Six Moon Hill in Lexington, Massachusetts. He was fond of skiing, tennis, and music. Konrad died in Burlington, Massachusetts of congestive heart failure in 2000, aged 88. Lore Bloch died in 2010 aged 98.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "17372", "revid": "48523215", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=17372", "title": "Klement Gottwald", "text": "Leader of Czechoslovakia from 1948 to 1953\nKlement Gottwald (; 23 November 1896 \u2013 14 March 1953) was a Czech communist politician, who was the leader of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia from 1929 until his death in 1953 \u2013 titled as general secretary until 1945 and as chairman from 1945 to 1953. He was the first leader of Communist Czechoslovakia from 1948 to 1953.\nFollowing the collapse of democratic Czechoslovakia after the Munich Agreement, the right-wing leadership of the Czechoslovak Second Republic banned the Communist Party, forcing Gottwald to emigrate to the Soviet Union in November 1938. In 1943, Gottwald agreed with representatives of the Czechoslovak-government-in-exile located in London, along with President Edvard Bene\u0161, to unify domestic and foreign anti-fascist resistance and form the National Front. He was the 14th prime minister of Czechoslovakia from July 1946 until June 1948, the first Communist to hold the post. In June 1948, he was elected as Czechoslovakia's first Communist president, four months after the 1948 coup d'\u00e9tat in which his party seized power with the backing of the Soviet Union. He held the post until his death.\nEarly life.\nChildhood and youth.\nKlement Gottwald was born on 23 November 1896, but it is unclear if in D\u011bdice (today part of Vy\u0161kov) or in Ho\u0161tice-Heroltice. His mother was an unmarried maidservant. Before World War I he was trained in Vienna as a carpenter but also actively participated in the activities of the Social Democratic youth movement.\nPersonal life.\nKlement Gottwald was married to who came from a poor family and was an illegitimate child. Although his wife stood by him through his endeavours, and was his faithful companion, she never joined the Communist Party. They had one daughter, Marta (1920\u20131998), who married Alexey \u010cepi\u010dka.\nFirst World War.\nFrom 1915 to 1918 Gottwald was a soldier in the Austro-Hungarian Army. It is believed that he fought in the Battle of Zborov, which would mean that he fought there against future General and President Ludv\u00edk Svoboda, who fought on the side of the Czechoslovak Legion. Thomas Jakl of the Military History Institute called Gottwald's participation in the Battle of Zborov a legend: Gottwald was in a hospital in Vienna during the time of the battle. In the summer of 1918, Gottwald deserted from the army. After the establishment of the first Czechoslovak Republic, he served for two years in the Czechoslovak Army. From 1920 to 1921 he worked in Rousinov as a cabinetmaker.\nCareer.\nSports instructor and journalist.\nAfter the collapse of the Workers' Gymnastic Union, the Communist-oriented party of the organization split off in 1921 and created the Federation of Workers' Gymnastic Unions (FDTJ). Gottwald was able to unify the organization to gain considerable power in the local districts, and became the of the 20th district of the FDTJ. In June 1921, he participated in the first Spartakiada in Prague. In September 1921 he moved from Rousinov to Bansk\u00e1 Bystrica, where he became the editor of the communist magazine (\"Voice of the people\" in Slovak). At the same time, he was planning FDTJ events at the Bansk\u00e1 Bystrica district. He became the local of the district, and was the managing director of the 47th district of the FDTJ. Later, he moved to \u017dilina and became editor in chief of magazine. In 1922 he moved to Vr\u00fatky, where by decision of the Communist Party Central Committee, they merged a number of communist magazines and consolidated editors. In 1924, the editorial staff, along with Gottwald, moved to Ostrava.\nBeginning of political activity.\nIn 1926, Gottwald became a functionary of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia (KS\u010c), and editor of the Communist Press. From 1926 to 1929 he worked in Prague, where he aided the Secretariat of the KS\u010c to form a pro-Moscow opposition against the anti-Moscow leadership then in power. From 1928 he was a member of the Comintern. Following a Comintern policy initiated by Stalin, he carried out the Bolshevization of the Party.\nIn February 1929, at the Fifth Congress of the KS\u010c, Gottwald was elected party general secretary, alongside Josef Guttmann, Jan \u0160verma, Rudolf Sl\u00e1nsk\u00fd, V\u00e1clav Kopeck\u00fd and Pavel Reiman, together known as the Karl\u00edn Boys.\nIn the second half of 1930, the Communist Party carried out a number of reforms in accordance and response with the changes in those of the foreign policy of the Soviet Union, namely the introduction of the policy on the formation of a popular front against fascism. In September and October 1938, Gottwald was one of the main leaders of the opposition against the adoption of the Munich Agreement.\nExile to the USSR.\nAfter the banning of the Communist Party, Gottwald emigrated to the Soviet Union in November 1938. While there, he opposed the party policy of backing the Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop pact of 1939. After the attack on the Soviet Union in June 1941, Soviet leadership saw the front against fascism as a great opportunity to assert themselves in Czechoslovakia, promoting interest in supporting Gottwald after the liberation of Czechoslovakia. In 1943, Gottwald agreed with representatives of the Czechoslovak-government-in-exile located in London, along with President Edvard Bene\u0161, to unify domestic and foreign anti-fascist resistance and form the National Front. This proved helpful for Gottwald as it helped secure Communist influence in post-war Czechoslovakia.\nReturn to Czechoslovakia and events leading up to the coup.\nIn 1945, Gottwald gave up the general secretary's post to Rudolf Sl\u00e1nsk\u00fd and was elected to the new position of party chairman. On 10 May 1945, Gottwald returned to Prague as the deputy premier under Zden\u011bk Fierlinger and as the chairman of the National Front. In March 1946, he became prime minister after leading the KS\u010c to a 38% share of the vote. This was easily the best showing for a Czechoslovak party in a free election at the time; previously, no party had ever won more than 25 percent.\nGottwald was a firm supporter of the expulsion of ethnic Germans from Czechoslovakia, gaining mainstream credibility with many Czechs through the use of nationalist rhetoric, exhorting the population to \"prepare for the final retribution for White Mountain, for the return of the Czech lands to the Czech people. We will expel for good all descendants of the alien German nobility.\"\n\u0421oup d'\u00e9tat.\nBy the summer of 1947, however, the KS\u010c's popularity had significantly dwindled, particularly after the Soviets pressured Czechoslovakia to turn down Marshall Plan aid after initially accepting it. Most observers believed Gottwald would be turned out of office at the elections due in May 1948. The Communists' dwindling popularity, combined with France and Italy dropping the Communists from their coalition governments, prompted Joseph Stalin to order Gottwald to begin efforts to eliminate parliamentary opposition to Communism in Czechoslovakia.\nOutwardly, though, Gottwald kept up the appearance of working within the system, announcing that he intended to lead the Communists to an absolute majority in the upcoming election\u2014something no Czechoslovak party had ever done. The endgame began in February 1948, when a majority of the Cabinet directed the Communist interior minister, V\u00e1clav Nosek, to stop packing the police force with Communists. Nosek ignored this directive, with Gottwald's support. In response, 12 non-Communist ministers resigned. They believed that without their support, Gottwald would be unable to govern and be forced to either give way or resign. Bene\u0161 initially supported their position, and refused to accept their resignations. At that point, Gottwald dropped all pretense of liberal democracy. He not only refused to resign, but demanded the appointment of a Communist-dominated government under threat of a general strike. His Communist colleagues occupied the offices of the non-Communist ministers.\nOn 25 February, Bene\u0161, fearing Soviet intervention, gave in. He accepted the resignations of the non-Communist ministers and appointed a new government in accordance with Gottwald's specifications. Although ostensibly still a coalition, it was dominated by Communists and pro-Moscow Social Democrats. The other parties were still nominally represented, but with the exception of Foreign Minister Jan Masaryk they were fellow travellers handpicked by the Communists. From this date forward, Gottwald was effectively the most powerful man in Czechoslovakia.\nOn 9 May, the National Assembly, now a docile tool of the Communists, approved the so-called Ninth-of-May Constitution. While it was not a completely Communist document, its Communist imprint was strong enough that Bene\u0161 refused to sign it. Later that month, elections were held in which voters were presented with a single list from the National Front, now a Communist-controlled patriotic organization. Bene\u0161 resigned on 2 June. In accordance with the 1920 Constitution, Gottwald took over most presidential functions until 14 June, when he was formally elected as President.\nLeadership of Czechoslovakia.\nGottwald initially tried to take a semi-independent line. However, that changed shortly after a meeting with Stalin. Under Stalin's direction, Gottwald imposed the Stalinist Soviet model of government on the country. He nationalized the country's industry and initiated the collectivization of Czechoslovak farms. There was considerable resistance within the government to Soviet influence on Czechoslovak politics. In response, Gottwald instigated a series of purges. Perceived opponents were often jailed or condemned to forced labor. His regime conducted a number of show trials, including the trial of the non-Communist politician Milada Horakova, who was executed in June 1950, as well as fellow comrades and Communist party leaders Rudolf Sl\u00e1nsk\u00fd and Vlado Clementis, both of whom were executed in December 1952. Many Communist leaders subjected to show trials had been part of a tight-knit group of Communists around Gottwald in the interwar period. In a famous photograph from 21 February 1948, described also in \"The Book of Laughter and Forgetting\" by Milan Kundera, Clementis stands next to Gottwald. When Clementis was charged in 1950, he was erased from the photograph (along with the photographer Karel H\u00e1jek) by the state propaganda department.\nDeath.\nGottwald was a long-time alcoholic and suffered from heart disease caused by\nsyphilis that had gone untreated for several years. Shortly after attending Stalin's funeral on 9 March 1953, one of his arteries burst. He died five days later on 14 March 1953, aged 56. He was the first Czechoslovak president to die in office.\nGottwald's embalmed body was initially displayed in a mausoleum at the site of the Jan \u017di\u017eka national monument in the district of \u017di\u017ekov, Prague. In 1962, the personality cult ended and it was no longer deemed appropriate to show Gottwald's body. There are accounts that in 1962 Gottwald's body had blackened and was decomposing due to a botched embalming, although other witnesses have disputed this. His body was cremated, the ashes returned to the \u017di\u017eka Monument and placed in a sarcophagus.\nAfter the end of the communist period, Gottwald's ashes were removed from the \u017di\u017eka Monument (in 1990) and placed in a common grave at Prague's Ol\u0161any Cemetery, together with the ashes of about 20 other communist leaders which had also originally been placed in the \u017di\u017eka Monument. The Communist Party of Bohemia and Moravia now maintains that common grave.\nLegacy.\nHe was succeeded as \"de facto\" leader of Czechoslovakia by Anton\u00edn Novotn\u00fd, who became First Secretary of the KS\u010c. Anton\u00edn Z\u00e1potock\u00fd, who had been prime minister since 1948, succeeded Gottwald as president.\nIn tribute, Zl\u00edn, a city in Moravia, now the Czech Republic, was renamed \"Gottwaldov\" after him from 1949 to 1989. Zmiiv, a city in Kharkiv Oblast, Ukrainian SSR, was named \"Gotvald\" after him from 1976 to 1990.\nA major square and park in Bratislava was named \"Gottwaldovo n\u00e1mestie\" after him, later becoming N\u00e1mestie Slobody \"(Freedom square)\" immediately following the Velvet Revolution. The original eponym persists today, the square being referred to by locals as \"Gottko\". A bridge in Prague that is now called Nuselsk\u00fd Most was once called Gottwald\u016fv Most, and the abutting metro station now called Vy\u0161ehrad was called Gottwaldova.\nA Czechoslovak 100 Koruna banknote issued on 1 October 1989 as part of the 1985\u201389 banknote series included a portrait of Gottwald. This note was so poorly received by Czechoslovaks that it was removed from official circulation on 31 December 1990 and was promptly replaced with the previous banknote issue of the same denomination.\nIn 2005 he was voted \"The Greatest Villain\" in the \"Nejv\u011bt\u0161\u00ed \u010cech\" poll of the Czech Television (a program under the BBC licence 100 Greatest Britons). He received 26% of the votes.\nWiesenau in Brandenburg, (former East) Germany keeps a street named after Gottwald.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

From the 2011 Census the population of the village was not maintained and is included in the civil parish of Chelsworth. It derives its name from Kitelbeornastuna, (Kitelbjorn's farmstead - O.Scand. pers. name + O.E. Tun), later evolving to Kettlebarston, (which is how the name is still pronounced), and finally to the current spelling. Its existence was first recorded in 1086 in the \"Domesday Book\".\nHistory.\nOnce in an area of great wealth, the demise of the mediaeval wool trade was indirectly the saving of the village, (as we know it today), since the locals were unable to afford the expense of upgrading their houses with the latest architectural fashions. The number of timber-framed houses slowly declined over the years, as did the population - from over 200 at its peak, to the point when the village was on the brink of extinction. By the 1960s, with the road no more than an unmade track, and no electricity or mains water supplies, (it still has no gas or main drains), Kettlebaston was barely standing. In the \"Spotlight On The Suffolk Scene\" article, of the \"Chronicle &amp; Mercury\" in June 1949, it was noted that a great many houses were category five - derelict, and ready for demolition.\nAs the agricultural workers left the land in search of other jobs, due to the increased mechanisation of farm work, \"outsiders\" discovered the secluded beauty of the rural Suffolk countryside, and a new age dawned. The tiny workmen's cottages, which once housed huge families - and some stock and chickens according to local accounts - were lovingly renovated and converted, and the village was reborn, and went on to proudly win Babergh Best Kept Village, and runner up in the Suffolk Community Council Best Kept Village Competition, in 1989.\nThe village sign, bearing two crossed sceptres topped with doves, was erected to mark the coronation of King George VI and Queen Elizabeth. It also commemorates that, in 1445, Henry VI granted the manor of Kettlebaston to William de la Pole, 1st Marquess of Suffolk, in return for the service of carrying a golden sceptre at the coronation of all the future Kings of England, and an ivory sceptre to carry at the coronation of Margaret of Anjou, and all future Queens. This honour continued until Henry VIII resumed the manor, although it was later regranted it was without the royal service.\nParish church.\nThe parish church of St Mary the Virgin has Norman origins, and features a font from around 1200. The building is listed as Grade I. It is recorded that the church was then \"built anew\" in 1342, remaining largely unchanged until targeted by Protestant iconoclasts in the 1540s. Today it features one of Suffolk's finest post-Reformation rood screens, designed by Father Ernest Geldart and decorated by Patrick Osborne, and Enid Chadwick, and a rare Sacred Heart altar upon a Stuart Holy Table. It now lacks the small lead spire which once topped the tower.\nRegarded as a place of pilgrimage to the followers of the Anglo-Catholic movement from all over the UK, Kettlebaston was the liturgically highest of all Suffolk's Anglican churches. From 1930, until his retirement in 1964, Reverend Father Harold Clear Butler said Roman Mass every day, and celebrated High Mass and Benediction on Sundays. He also removed state notices from the porch, and refused to keep registers, or to recognise the office of the local Archdeacon of Sudbury. Despite opposition, the church finally received electric heating and lighting in 2014.\nThe village today.\nThe current village has no shop, school, or pub.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "17378", "revid": "12596865", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=17378", "title": "Karl Amadeus Hartmann", "text": "German composer\nKarl Amadeus Hartmann (2 August 1905 \u2013 5 December 1963) was a German composer. A major figure of the musical life of post-war Germany, he has been described as the greatest German symphonist of the 20th century.\nLife.\nBorn in Munich, the son of Friedrich Richard Hartmann, and the youngest of four brothers of whom the elder three became painters, Hartmann was himself torn, early in his career, between music and the visual arts. He was much affected in his early political development by the events of the unsuccessful Workers\u2019 Revolution in Bavaria that followed the collapse of the German empire at the end of World War I (see Bavarian Soviet Republic). He remained an idealistic socialist for the rest of his life.\nAt the Munich Academy in the 1920s, Hartmann studied with Joseph Haas, a pupil of Max Reger, and later received intellectual stimulus and encouragement from the conductor Hermann Scherchen, an ally of the Schoenberg school, with whom he had a nearly lifelong mentor-prot\u00e9g\u00e9 relationship. He voluntarily withdrew completely from musical life in Germany during the Nazi era, while remaining in Germany, and refused to allow his works to be played there. An early symphonic poem, \"Miserae\" (1933\u20131934, first performed in Prague, 1935) was condemned by the Nazi regime but his work continued to be performed, and his fame grew, abroad. A number of Hartmann's compositions show the profound effect of the political climate. His \"Miserae\" (1933\u201334) was dedicated to his 'friends...who sleep for all eternity; we do not forget you (Dachau, 1933\u201334)', referring to Dachau Concentration Camp, and was condemned by the Nazis. His piano sonata \"27 April 1945\" portrays 20,000 prisoners from Dachau whom Hartmann witnessed being led away from Allied forces at the end of the war.\nDuring World War II, though already an experienced composer, Hartmann submitted to a course of private tuition in Vienna by Schoenberg\u2019s pupil Anton Webern (with whom he often disagreed on a personal and political level). Although stylistically their music had little in common, he clearly felt that he needed, and benefited from, Webern's acute perfectionism.\nAfter the fall of Adolf Hitler, Hartmann was one of the few prominent surviving anti-fascists in Bavaria whom the postwar Allied administration could appoint to a position of responsibility. In 1945, he became a \"dramaturge\" at the Bavarian State Opera and there, as one of the few internationally recognized figures who had survived untainted by any collaboration with the Nazi regime, he became a vital figure in the rebuilding of (West) German musical life. Perhaps his most notable achievement was the Musica Viva concert series, which he founded and ran for the rest of his life in Munich. Beginning in November 1945, the concerts reintroduced the German public to 20th-century repertoire, which had been banned since 1933 under National Socialist aesthetic policy. Hartmann also provided a platform for the music of young composers in the late 1940s and early 1950s, helping to establish such figures as Hans Werner Henze, Luigi Nono, Luigi Dallapiccola, Carl Orff, Iannis Xenakis, Olivier Messiaen, Luciano Berio, Bernd Alois Zimmermann and many others. Hartmann also involved sculptors and artists such as Jean Cocteau, Le Corbusier, and Joan Mir\u00f3 in exhibitions at Musica Viva.\nHe was accorded numerous honours after the war, including the Musikpreis of the city of Munich in March 1949. This was followed by the Kunstpreis of the Bayerische Akademie der Sch\u00f6nen K\u00fcnste (1950), the Arnold Sch\u00f6nberg Medal of the IGNM (1954), the Gro\u00dfe Kunstpreis of the Land Nordrhein-Westfalen (1957), as well as the Ludwig Spohr Award of the city of Braunschweig, the Schwabing Kunstpreis (1961) and the Bavarian Medal of Merit (1959). Hartmann became a member of the Academy of Arts in Munich (1952) and Berlin (1955) and received an honorary doctorate from Spokane Conservatory, Washington (1962). His socialist sympathies did not extend to the Soviet Union's variety of communism, and in the 1950s, he refused an offer to move to East Germany.\nHartmann continued to base his activities in Munich for the remainder of his life, and his administrative duties came to absorb much of his time and energy. This reduced his time for composition, and his last years were dogged by serious illness. In 1963, he died of stomach cancer at the age of 58, leaving his last work \u2013 an extended symphonic \"Gesangsszene\" for voice and orchestra on words from Jean Giraudoux\u2019s apocalyptic drama \"Sodom and Gomorrah\" \u2013 unfinished.\nOutput and style.\nHartmann completed a number of works, most notably eight symphonies. The first of these, and perhaps emblematic of the difficult genesis of many of his works, is Symphony No. 1, \"Essay for a Requiem\" (\"Versuch eines Requiems\"). It began in 1936 as a cantata for alto solo and orchestra loosely based on a few poems by Walt Whitman. It soon became known as \"Our Life: Symphonic Fragment\" (\"Unser Leben: Symphonisches Fragment\") and was intended as a comment on the generally miserable conditions for artists and liberal-minded people under the early Nazi regime. After the defeat of the Third Reich in World War II, the regime's real victims had become clear, and the cantata's title was changed to \"Symphonic Fragment: Attempt at a Requiem\" to honor the millions killed in the Holocaust. Hartmann revised the work in 1954\u201355 as his Symphony No. 1, and published it in 1956. As this example indicates, he was a highly self-critical composer and many of his works went through successive stages of revision. He also suppressed most of his substantial orchestral works of the late 1930s and the war years, either allowing them to remain unpublished or, in several cases, reworking them \u2013 or portions of them \u2013 into the series of numbered symphonies that he produced in the late 1940s and early 1950s.\nPerhaps the most frequently performed of his symphonies are No. 4, for strings, and No. 6; probably his most widely known work, through performances and recordings, is his Concerto funebre for violin and strings, composed at the beginning of World War II and making use of a Hussite chorale and a Russian revolutionary song of 1905.\nHartmann attempted a synthesis of many different idioms, including musical expressionism and jazz stylization, into organic symphonic forms in the tradition of Bruckner and Mahler. His early works are both satirical and politically engaged. But he admired the polyphonic mastery of J.S. Bach, the profound expressive irony of Mahler, and the neoclassicism of Igor Stravinsky and Paul Hindemith. In the 1930s he developed close ties with B\u00e9la Bart\u00f3k and Zolt\u00e1n Kod\u00e1ly in Hungary, and this is reflected in his music to some extent. In the 1940s, he began to take an interest in Schoenbergian twelve-tone technique; though he studied with Webern his own idiom was closer to Alban Berg. In the 1950s, Hartmann started to explore the metrical techniques pioneered by Boris Blacher and Elliott Carter. Among his most-used forms are three-part adagio slow movements, fugues, variations and toccatas.\nReputation and legacy.\nSignificantly, championed his music following his death: Scherchen, his most noted advocate, died in 1966. Some have suggested that this accelerated the disappearance of Hartmann's music from public view in the years following his death. Conductors who regularly performed Hartmann's music include Rafael Kubelik and Ferdinand Leitner, who recorded the third and sixth symphonies. More recent champions of works by Hartmann include Ingo Metzmacher and Mariss Jansons.\nHans Werner Henze said of Hartmann's music: \nSymphonic architecture was essential for him... as a suitable medium for reflecting the world as he experienced and understood it \u2013 as an agonizingly dramatic battle, as contradiction and conflict \u2013 in order to be able to achieve self-realization in its dialectic and to portray himself as a man among men, a man of this world, and not out of this world.\nThe English composer John McCabe wrote his \"Variations on a Theme of Karl Amadeus Hartmann\" (1964) in tribute. It uses the opening of Hartmann's Fourth Symphony as its theme. Henze made a version of Hartmann's Piano Sonata No. 2 for full orchestra.\nList of works.\nSymphonic works.\n(i) Up to 1945 \u2013 mostly later suppressed\n(ii) After 1945\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
