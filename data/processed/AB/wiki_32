A standard match consists of two periods of 30 minutes, and the team that scores more goals wins.\nModern handball is played on a court of , with a goal in the middle of each end. The goals are surrounded by a zone where only the defending goalkeeper is allowed; goals must be scored by throwing the ball from outside the zone or while \"diving\" into it. The sport is usually played indoors, but outdoor variants exist in the forms of field handball, Czech handball (which were more common in the past) and beach handball. The game is fast and high-scoring: professional teams now typically score between 20 and 35 goals each, though lower scores were not uncommon until a few decades ago. Body contact is permitted for the defenders trying to stop the attackers from approaching the goal. No protective equipment is mandated, but players may wear soft protective bands, pads and mouth guards.\nThe modern set of rules was published in 1917 by Karl Schelenz, Max Heiser, and Erich Konigh, on 29 October in Berlin, which is seen as the date of birth of the sport. The rules have had several revisions since. The first official handball match was played in 1917 in Germany. Karl Schelenz modified the rules in 1919. The first international games were played (under these rules) with men in 1925 (between Germany and Belgium) and with women in 1930 (between Germany and Austria).\nMen's handball was first played at the Olympics in the 1936 Summer Olympics in Berlin outdoors, and the next time at the 1972 Summer Olympics in Munich indoors; handball has been an Olympic sport since then. Women's handball was added at the 1976 Summer Olympics.\nThe International Handball Federation was formed in 1946 and, as of 2016[ [update]], has 197 member federations. The sport is most popular in Europe, and European countries have won all medals but one in the men's world championships since 1938. In the women's world championships, only two non-European countries have won the title: South Korea and Brazil. The game also enjoys popularity in East Asia, North Africa and parts of South America.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:TOC limit/styles.css\" /&gt;\nOrigins and development.\nGames similar to handball were played in Ancient Greece and are represented on amphorae and stone carvings. Although detailed textual reference is rare, there are numerous descriptions of ball games being played where players throw the ball to one another; sometimes this is done in order to avoid interception by a player on the opposing team. Such games were played widely and served as both a form of exercise and a social event.\nThere is evidence of ancient Roman women playing a version of handball called . There are records of handball-like games in medieval France, and among the Inuit in Greenland, in the Middle Ages. By the 19th century, there existed similar games of \"h\u00e5ndbold\" from Denmark, \"h\u00e1zen\u00e1\" in the Czech Republic, \"handbol\" in Ukraine, and \"torball\" in Germany.\nThe team handball game of today was codified at the end of the 19th century in northern Europe: primarily in Denmark, Germany, Norway, and Sweden. The first written set of team handball rules was published in 1906 by the Danish gym teacher, lieutenant and Olympic medalist Holger Nielsen from Ordrup grammar school, north of Copenhagen. The modern set of rules was published by Max Heiser, Karl Schelenz, and Erich Konigh in 1917 on 29 October in Berlin, Germany; this day is therefore seen as the \"date of birth\" of the sport. The first official handball match was played on 2 December 1917 in Berlin. In 1919 the rules were modified by Karl Schelenz. The first international games were played under these rules, between Germany and Austria by men in 1925 and between Germany and Austria by women in 1930.\nIn 1926, the Congress of World Athletics (then known as the International Amateur Athletic Federation) nominated a committee to draw up international rules for field handball. The International Amateur Handball Federation was formed in 1928 and later the International Handball Federation was formed in 1946.\nMen's field handball was played at the 1936 Summer Olympics in Berlin. During the next several decades, indoor handball flourished and evolved in the Scandinavian countries. The sport re-emerged onto the world stage as men's team handball for the 1972 Summer Olympics in Munich. Women's team handball was added at the 1976 Summer Olympics in Montreal. Due to its popularity in the region, the Eastern European countries that refined the event became the dominant force in the sport when it was reintroduced.\nThe International Handball Federation organised the men's world championship in 1938 and every four (sometimes three) years from World War II to 1995. Since the 1995 world championship in Iceland, the competition has been held every two years. The women's world championship has been held since 1957. The IHF also organizes women's and men's junior world championships. By July 2009, the IHF listed 166 member federations \u2013 approximately 795,000 teams and 19 million players.\nRules.\nThe rules are laid out in the IHF's set of rules, most recently published in 2024.\nSummary.\nTwo teams of seven players (six court players plus one goalkeeper) take the court and attempt to score points by putting the game ball into the opposing team's goal. In handling the ball, players are subject to the following restrictions:\nNotable scoring opportunities can occur when attacking players jump into the goal area. For example, an attacking player may catch a pass while launching toward the inside of the goal area, and then shoot or pass before touching the floor. \"Doubling\" occurs when a diving attacking player passes to another diving teammate.\nPlaying court.\nHandball is played on a court , with a goal in the centre of each end. The goals are surrounded by a near-semicircular area, called the zone or the crease, defined by a line six metres from the goal. A dashed near-semicircular line nine metres from the goal marks the free-throw line. Each line on the court is part of the area it encompasses; the centre line belongs to both halves at the same time.\nGoals.\nThe goals are two metres high and three metres wide. They must be securely bolted either to the floor or the wall behind.\nThe goal posts and the crossbar must be made out of the same material (e.g., wood or aluminium) and feature a quadratic cross section with sides of . The three sides of the beams visible from the playing court must be painted alternatingly in two contrasting colors which both have to contrast against the background. The colors on both goals must be the same.\nEach goal must feature a net. This must be fastened in such a way that a ball thrown into the goal does not leave or pass the goal under normal circumstances. If necessary, a second net may be clasped to the back of the net on the inside.\nCrease.\nThe goals are surrounded by the crease, also called the zone. This area is delineated by two quarter circles with a radius of six metres around the far corners of each goal post and a connecting line parallel to the goal line. Only the defending goalkeeper is allowed inside this zone. Court players may catch and touch the ball in the air within it as long as the player starts their jump outside the zone and releases the ball before they land (landing inside the perimeter is allowed in this case as long as the ball has been released).\nIf a player without the ball contacts the ground inside the goal perimeter, or the line surrounding the perimeter, they must take the most direct path out of it. Should a player cross the zone in an attempt to gain an advantage (e.g., better position) their team cedes the ball. Similarly, violation of the zone by a defending player is penalized only if they do so in order to gain an advantage in defending.\nSubstitution area.\nOutside of one long edge of the court to both sides of the middle line are the substitution areas for each team. Team officials, substitutes, and suspended players must wait within this area. A team's area is the same side as the goal the team is defending; during halftime, substitution areas are swapped. Any player entering or leaving the play must cross the substitution line which is part of the side line and extends from the middle line to the team's side.\nDuration.\n A standard match has two 30-minute halves with a 10- or 15-minute (major Championships/Olympics) halftime intermission. At half-time, teams switch sides of the court as well as benches. For youths, the length of the halves is reduced\u201425 minutes at ages 12 to 15, and 20 minutes at ages 8 to 11; though national federations of some countries may differ in their implementation from the official guidelines.\nIf a decision must be reached in a particular match (e.g., in a tournament) and it ends in a draw after regular time, there are at maximum two overtimes, each consisting of two straight 5-minute periods with a one-minute break in between. If these does not decide the game either, then the winning team is determined in a penalty shootout (best-of-five rounds; if still tied, extra rounds are added until one team wins).\nThe referees may call \"timeout\" according to their sole discretion; typical reasons are injuries, suspensions, or court cleaning. Penalty throws should trigger a timeout only for lengthy delays, such as a change of the goalkeeper.\nSince 2012, teams can call 3 \"team timeouts\" per game (up to two per half), which last one minute each. This right may only be invoked by the team in possession of the ball. Team representatives must show a green card marked with a black \"T\" on the timekeeper's desk. The timekeeper then immediately interrupts the game by sounding the buzzer to stop the clock. Before 2012, teams were allowed only one timeout per half. For the purpose of calling timeouts, overtime and shootouts are extensions of the second half.\nReferees.\nA handball match is adjudicated by two equal referees. Some national bodies allow games with only a single referee in special cases like illness on short notice. Should the referees disagree on any occasion, a decision is made on mutual agreement during a short timeout; or, in case of punishments, the more severe of the two comes into effect. The referees are obliged to make their decisions \"on the basis of their observations of facts\". Their judgements are final and can be appealed against only if not in compliance with the rules. Officials can look to TV replays, as needed.\nThe referees position themselves in such a way that the team players are confined between them. They stand diagonally aligned so that each can observe one side line. Depending on their positions, one is called \"court referee\" and the other \"goal referee\". These positions automatically switch on ball turnover. They physically exchange their positions approximately every 10 minutes (long exchange), and change sides every five minutes (short exchange).\nThe IHF defines 18 hand signals for quick visual communication with players and officials. The signal for warning is accompanied by a yellow card. A disqualification for the game is indicated by a red card, followed by a blue card if the disqualification will be accompanied by a report. The referees also use whistle blows to indicate infractions or to restart the play.\nThe referees are supported by a \"scorekeeper\" and a \"timekeeper\" who attend to formal things such as keeping track of goals and suspensions, or starting and stopping the clock, respectively. They also keep an eye on the benches and notify the referees on substitution errors. Their desk is located between the two substitution areas.\nTeam players, substitutes, and officials.\nEach team consists of seven players on court and seven substitute players on the bench. One player on the court must be the designated goalkeeper, differing in his clothing from the rest of the court players. Substitution of players can be done in any number and at any time during game play. An exchange takes place over the substitution line. A prior notification of the referees is not necessary.\nSome national bodies, such as the Deutsche Handball Bund (DHB, \"German Handball Federation\"), allow substitution in junior teams only when in ball possession or during timeouts. This restriction is intended to prevent early specialization of players to offence or defence.\nCourt players.\nCourt players are allowed to touch the ball with any part of their bodies above and including the knee. As in several other team sports, a distinction is made between catching and dribbling. A player who is in possession of the ball may stand stationary for only three seconds, and may take only three steps. They must then either shoot, pass, or dribble the ball. Taking more than three steps at any time is considered travelling, and results in a turnover. A player may dribble as many times as they want (though, since passing is faster, it is the preferred method of attack), as long as during each dribble the hand contacts only the top of the ball. Therefore, carrying is completely prohibited, and results in a turnover. After the dribble is picked up, the player has the right to another three seconds or three steps. The ball must then be passed or shot, as further holding or dribbling will result in a \"double dribble\" turnover and a free throw for the other team. Other offensive infractions that result in a turnover include charging and setting an illegal screen. Carrying the ball into the six-metre zone results either in ball possession by the goalkeeper (by attacker) or turnover (by defender).\nGoalkeeper.\nOnly the goalkeepers are allowed to move freely within the goal perimeter, although they may not cross the goal perimeter line while carrying or dribbling the ball. Within the zone, they are allowed to touch the ball with all parts of their bodies, including their feet, with a defensive aim (for other actions, they are subject to the same restrictions as the court players). The goalkeepers may participate in the normal play of their teammates. A regular court player may substitute as an extra attacker for the goalkeeper if a team elects to use this scheme in order to outnumber the defending players. Prior to 2015, this court player became the designated goalkeeper on the court and had to wear some vest or bib the same color as the goalkeeper's shirt to be identified as such. A rule change meant to make the game more offensive now allows any player to substitute for the goalkeeper without becoming a designated goalkeeper. The new rule resembles the one used in ice hockey. This rule was first used in the women's world championship in December 2015 and has since been used by the men's European championship in January 2016 and by both genders in the Olympic tournament in 2016. This rule change has led to a drastic increase of empty net goals.\nIf either goalkeeper deflects the ball over the outer goal line, their team stays in possession of the ball, in contrast to other sports like football. The goalkeeper resumes the play with a throw from within the zone (\"goalkeeper throw\"). In a penalty shot or directly taken free throw, throwing the ball against the head of a goalkeeper who is not moving will lead to a direct disqualification (\"red card\"). Hitting a non-moving goalkeeper's head out of regular play will lead to a two-minute suspension as long as the player threw without obstruction.\nOutside of own D-zone, the goalkeeper is treated as an ordinary court player, and has to follow court players' rules; holding or tackling an opponent player outside the area risks a direct disqualification. The goalkeeper may not return to the area with the ball. Passing to one's own goalkeeper results in a turnover.\nTeam officials.\nEach team is allowed to have a maximum of four team officials seated on the benches. An official is anybody who is neither player nor substitute. One official must be the designated representative who is usually the team manager. Since 2012, representatives can call up to 3 team timeouts (up to twice per half), and may address the scorekeeper, timekeeper, and referees (before that, it was once per half); overtime and shootouts are considered extensions of the second half. Other officials typically include physicians or managers. No official is allowed to enter the playing court without the permission of the referees.\nBall.\n The ball is spherical and must be made either of leather or a synthetic material. It is not allowed to have a shiny or slippery surface. As the ball is intended to be operated by a single hand, its official sizes vary depending on age and gender of the participating teams.\nAwarded throws.\nThe referees may award a special throw to a team. This usually happens after certain events such as scored goals, off-court balls, turnovers and timeouts. All of these special throws require the thrower to obtain a certain position, and pose restrictions on the positions of all other players. Sometimes the execution must wait for a whistle blow by the referee.\nModern handball introduced the \"fast throw-off\" concept; i.e., the play will be immediately restarted by the referees as soon as the executing team fulfills its requirements. Many teams leverage this rule to score easy goals before the opposition has time to form a stable defense line.\nPenalties.\nPenalties are given to players, in progressive format, for fouls that require more punishment than just a free-throw. Actions directed mainly at the opponent and not the ball (such as reaching around, holding, pushing, tripping, and jumping into opponent) as well as contact from the side, from behind a player or impeding the opponent's counterattack are all considered illegal and are subject to penalty. Any infraction that prevents a clear scoring opportunity will result in a seven-metre penalty shot.\nTypically the referee will give a warning yellow card for an illegal action; but, if the contact was particularly dangerous, like striking the opponent in the head, neck or throat, the referee can forego the warning for an immediate two-minute suspension. Players are warned once before given a yellow card; they risk being red-carded if they receive three two-minute suspensions.\nA red card results in an ejection from the game and a two-minute penalty for the team. A player may receive a red card directly for particularly rough penalties. For instance, any contact from behind during a fast break is now being treated with a red card; as does any deliberate intent to injure opponents. A red-carded player has to leave the playing area completely. A player who is disqualified may be substituted with another player after the two-minute penalty is served. A coach or official can also be penalized progressively. Any coach or official who receives a two-minute suspension will have to pull out one of their players for two minutes. The player is not the one punished, and can be substituted in again, as the penalty consists of the team playing with one fewer player than the opposing team.\nAfter referees award the ball to the opponents for whatever reason, the player currently in possession of the ball has to lay it down quickly, or risk a two-minute suspension. Also, gesticulating or verbally questioning the referee's order, as well as arguing with the officials' decisions, will normally risk a yellow card. If the suspended player protests further, does not walk straight off the court to the bench, or if the referee deems the tempo deliberately slow, that player risks a double yellow card. Illegal substitution (outside of the dedicated area, or if the replacement player enters too early) is prohibited; if they do, they risk a yellow card.\nGameplay.\nFormations.\nPlayers are typically referred to by the positions they are playing. The positions are always denoted from the view of the respective goalkeeper, so that a defender on the right opposes an attacker on the left. Not all of the following positions may be occupied depending on the formation or potential suspensions.\nOffense.\nSometimes, the offense uses formations with two pivot players. Formations with no pivots and 4 backs are rare, but not unheard of.\nDefense.\nThere are many variations in defensive formations. Usually, they are described as \"n:m\" formations, where \"n\" is the number of players defending at the goal line and \"m\" the number of players defending more offensive. Exceptions are the 3:2:1 defense and n+m formation (e.g. 5+1), where m players defend some offensive player in man coverage (instead of the usual zone coverage).\nLate match defence.\nClose to only seen in close matches with less than a minute left, where the defence is behind, the defence can go into a full field press, where the defensive line starts wherever the offence has the ball. This is a highly committal choice that often leads to an open chance for the offence.\nOffensive play.\nAttacks are played with all court players on the side of the defenders. Depending on the speed of the attack, one distinguishes between three attack \"waves\" with a decreasing chance of success:\nThe third wave evolves into the normal offensive play when all defenders not only reach the zone, but gain their accustomed positions. Some teams then substitute specialised offence players. This implies that these players must play in the defence should the opposing team be able to switch quickly to offence. The latter is another benefit for fast playing teams.\nIf the attacking team does not make sufficient progress (eventually releasing a shot on goal), the referees can call passive play (since 1995, the referee gives an advance warning by holding one hand high, signalling that the attacking team should release a shot soon), turning control over to the other team. A shot on goal or an infringement leading to a yellow card or two-minute penalty will mark the start of a new attack, causing the hand to be taken down; but a shot blocked by the defense or a normal free throw will not. This rule prevents an attacking team from stalling the game indefinitely, as it is difficult to intercept a pass without at the same time conceding dangerous openings towards the goal.\nDefensive play.\nThe usual formations of the defense are 6\u20130, when all the defense players line up between the and lines to form a wall; the 5\u20131, when one of the players cruises outside the perimeter, usually targeting the center forwards while the other 5 line up on the line; and the less common 4\u20132 when there are two such defenders out front. Very fast teams will also try a 3\u20133 formation which is close to a switching man-to-man style. The formations vary greatly from country to country, and reflect each country's style of play. 6\u20130 is sometimes known as \"flat defense\", and all other formations are usually called \"offensive defense\".\nOrganization.\nHandball teams are usually organised as clubs. On a national level, the clubs are associated in federations which organize matches in leagues and tournaments.\nInternational body.\nThe International Handball Federation (IHF) is the administrative and controlling body for international handball. Handball is an Olympic sport played during the Summer Olympics.\nThe IHF organizes world championships, held in odd-numbered years, with separate competitions for men and women.\nThe IHF World Men's Handball Championship 2025 title holders are Denmark. The IHF World Women's Handball Championship 2023 title holder is France.\nThe IHF is composed of five continental federations: Asian Handball Federation, African Handball Confederation, Pan-American Team Handball Federation, European Handball Federation and Oceania Handball Federation. These federations organize continental championships held every other second year. Handball is played during the Pan American Games, All-Africa Games, and Asian Games. It is also played at the Mediterranean Games. In addition to continental competitions between national teams, the federations arrange international tournaments between club teams.\nAttendance records.\nThe worldwide attendance record for seven-a-side handball was set on 10 January 2024 in D\u00fcsseldorf, Germany, during the two opening matches of the 2024 European Men's Handball Championship. The two games (France versus North Macedonia and Germany against Switzerland) were played in front of 53,586 spectators.\nCommemorative coins.\nHandball events have been selected as a main motif in numerous collectors' coins. One of the recent samples is the \u20ac10 Greek Handball commemorative coin, minted in 2003 to commemorate the 2004 Summer Olympics. On the coin, the modern athlete directs the ball in his hands towards his target, while in the background the ancient athlete is just about to throw a ball, in a game known as \"cheirosphaira\", in a representation taken from a black-figure pottery vase of the Archaic period.\nThe most recent commemorative coin featuring handball is the British 50 pence coin, part of the series of coins commemorating the London 2012 Olympic Games.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Every field, and the ring of integers are Noetherian rings. So, the theorem can be generalized and restated as: \"every polynomial ring over a Noetherian ring is also Noetherian\".\nThe theorem was stated and proved by David Hilbert in 1890 in his seminal article on invariant theory, where he solved several problems on invariants. In this article, he proved also two other fundamental theorems on polynomials, the Nullstellensatz (zero-locus theorem) and the syzygy theorem (theorem on relations). These three theorems were the starting point of the interpretation of algebraic geometry in terms of commutative algebra. In particular, the basis theorem implies that every algebraic set is the intersection of a finite number of hypersurfaces.\nAnother aspect of this article had a great impact on mathematics of the 20th century; this is the systematic use of non-constructive methods. For example, the basis theorem asserts that every ideal has a finite generator set, but the original proof does not provide any way to compute it for a specific ideal. This approach was so astonishing for mathematicians of that time that the first version of the article was rejected by Paul Gordan, the greatest specialist of invariants of that time, with the comment \"This is not mathematics. This is theology.\" Later, he recognized \"I have convinced myself that even theology has its merits.\"\nStatement.\nIf formula_1 is a ring, let formula_2 denote the ring of polynomials in the indeterminate formula_3 over formula_1. Hilbert proved that if formula_1 is \"not too large\", in the sense that if formula_1 is Noetherian, the same must be true for formula_2. Formally,\nHilbert's Basis Theorem. If formula_1 is a Noetherian ring, then formula_2 is a Noetherian ring.\nCorollary. If formula_1 is a Noetherian ring, then formula_11 is a Noetherian ring.\nHilbert proved the theorem (for the special case of multivariate polynomials over a field) in the course of his proof of finite generation of rings of invariants. The theorem is interpreted in algebraic geometry as follows: every algebraic set is the set of the common zeros of finitely many polynomials. \nHilbert's proof is highly non-constructive: it proceeds by induction on the number of variables, and, at each induction step uses the non-constructive proof for one variable less. Introduced more than eighty years later, Gr\u00f6bner bases allow a direct proof that is as constructive as possible: Gr\u00f6bner bases produce an algorithm for testing whether a polynomial belongs to the ideal generated by other polynomials. So, given an infinite sequence of polynomials, one can construct algorithmically the list of those polynomials that do not belong to the ideal generated by the preceding ones. Gr\u00f6bner basis theory implies that this list is necessarily finite, and is thus a finite basis of the ideal. However, for deciding whether the list is complete, one must consider every element of the infinite sequence, which cannot be done in the finite time allowed to an algorithm.\nProof.\nTheorem. If formula_1 is a left (resp. right) Noetherian ring, then the polynomial ring formula_2 is also a left (resp. right) Noetherian ring.\nRemark. We will give two proofs, in both only the \"left\" case is considered; the proof for the right case is similar.\nFirst proof.\nSuppose formula_14 is a non-finitely generated left ideal. Then by recursion (using the axiom of dependent choice) there is a sequence of polynomials formula_15 such that if formula_16 is the left ideal generated by formula_17 then formula_18 is of minimal degree. By construction, formula_19 is a non-decreasing sequence of natural numbers. Let formula_20 be the leading coefficient of formula_21 and let formula_22 be the left ideal in formula_1 generated by formula_24. Since formula_1 is Noetherian the chain of ideals\nformula_26\nmust terminate. Thus formula_27 for some integer formula_28. So in particular,\nformula_29\nNow consider\nformula_30\nwhose leading term is equal to that of formula_31; moreover, formula_32. However, formula_33, which means that formula_34 has degree less than formula_31, contradicting the minimality.\nSecond proof.\nLet formula_14 be a left ideal. Let formula_37 be the set of leading coefficients of members of formula_38. This is obviously a left ideal over formula_1, and so is finitely generated by the leading coefficients of finitely many members of formula_38; say formula_41. Let formula_42 be the maximum of the set formula_43, and let formula_44 be the set of leading coefficients of members of formula_38, whose degree is formula_46. As before, the formula_44 are left ideals over formula_1, and so are finitely generated by the leading coefficients of finitely many members of formula_38, say\nformula_50\nwith degrees formula_46. Now let formula_52 be the left ideal generated by:\nformula_53\nWe have formula_54 and claim also formula_55. Suppose for the sake of contradiction this is not so. Then let formula_56 be of minimal degree, and denote its leading coefficient by formula_57.\nCase 1: formula_58. Regardless of this condition, we have formula_59, so formula_57 is a left linear combination\nformula_61\nof the coefficients of the formula_62. Consider\nformula_63\nwhich has the same leading term as formula_64; moreover formula_65 while formula_66. Therefore formula_67 and formula_68, which contradicts minimality.\nCase 2: formula_69. Then formula_70 so formula_57 is a left linear combination\nformula_72\nof the leading coefficients of the formula_73. Considering\nformula_74\nwe yield a similar contradiction as in Case 1.\nThus our claim holds, and formula_75 which is finitely generated.\nNote that the only reason we had to split into two cases was to ensure that the powers of formula_3 multiplying the factors were non-negative in the constructions.\nApplications.\nLet formula_1 be a Noetherian commutative ring. Hilbert's basis theorem has some immediate corollaries.\nFormal proofs.\nFormal proofs of Hilbert's basis theorem have been verified through the Mizar project (see http://) and Lean (see https://).\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Heterocyclic organic chemistry is the branch of organic chemistry dealing with the synthesis, properties, and applications of organic heterocycles.\nExamples of heterocyclic compounds include all of the nucleic acids, the majority of drugs, most biomass (cellulose and related materials), and many natural and synthetic dyes. More than half of known compounds are heterocycles. 59% of US FDA-approved drugs contain nitrogen heterocycles.\nClassification.\nThe study of organic heterocyclic chemistry focuses especially on organic unsaturated derivatives, and the preponderance of work and applications involves unstrained organic 5- and 6-membered rings. Included are pyridine, thiophene, pyrrole, and furan. Another large class of organic heterocycles refers to those fused to benzene rings. For example, the fused benzene derivatives of pyridine, thiophene, pyrrole, and furan are quinoline, benzothiophene, indole, and benzofuran, respectively. The fusion of two benzene rings gives rise to a third large family of organic compounds. Analogs of the previously mentioned heterocycles for this third family of compounds are acridine, dibenzothiophene, carbazole, and dibenzofuran, respectively. \nHeterocyclic organic compounds can be usefully classified based on their electronic structure. The saturated organic heterocycles behave like the acyclic derivatives. Thus, piperidine and tetrahydrofuran are conventional amines and ethers, with modified steric profiles. Therefore, the study of organic heterocyclic chemistry focuses on organic unsaturated rings.\nInorganic rings.\nSome heterocycles contain no carbon. Examples are borazine (B3N3 ring), hexachlorophosphazene (P3N3 ring), and trithiazyl trichloride (S3N3 ring). In comparison with organic heterocycles, which have numerous commercial applications, inorganic ring systems are mainly of theoretical interest. IUPAC recommends the Hantzsch-Widman nomenclature for naming heterocyclic compounds.\n3-membered rings.\nAlthough subject to ring strain, 3-membered heterocyclic rings are well characterized.\n5-membered rings.\nThe 5-membered ring compounds containing \"two\" heteroatoms, at least one of which is nitrogen, are collectively called the azoles. Thiazoles and isothiazoles contain a sulfur and a nitrogen atom in the ring. Dithioles have two sulfur atoms.\nA large group of 5-membered ring compounds with \"three\" or more heteroatoms also exists. One example is the class of dithiazoles, which contain two sulfur atoms and one nitrogen atom.\n6-membered rings.\nThe 6-membered ring compounds containing \"two\" heteroatoms, at least one of which is nitrogen, are collectively called the azines. Thiazines contain a sulfur and a nitrogen atom in the ring. Dithiines have two sulfur atoms.\nSix-membered rings with five heteroatoms&lt;br&gt;The hypothetical chemical compound with five nitrogen heteroatoms would be pentazine.\nSix-membered rings with six heteroatoms&lt;br&gt;The hypothetical chemical compound with six nitrogen heteroatoms would be hexazine. Borazine is a six-membered ring with three nitrogen heteroatoms and three boron heteroatoms.\n7-membered rings.\nIn a 7-membered ring, the heteroatom must be able to provide an empty \u03c0-orbital (e.g. boron) for \"normal\" aromatic stabilization to be available; otherwise, homoaromaticity may be possible.\n8-membered rings.\nBorazocine is an eight-membered ring with four nitrogen heteroatoms and four boron heteroatoms.\nFused/condensed rings.\nHeterocyclic rings systems that are formally derived by fusion with other rings, either carbocyclic or heterocyclic, have a variety of common and systematic names. For example, with the benzo-fused unsaturated nitrogen heterocycles, pyrrole provides indole or isoindole depending on the orientation. The pyridine derivative is quinoline or isoquinoline, and the class of analogues with two nitrogen atoms is known as the benzodiazines. For the azepine derivative, benzazepine is the preferred name. Likewise, the compounds with two benzene rings fused to the central heterocycle are carbazole, acridine, and dibenzoazepine. Heptazine is a tricyclic nitrogen-containing heterocyclic system derived by fusion of three triazine rings, and analog of the carbocycle phenalene.\nHistory of heterocyclic chemistry.\nThe history of heterocyclic chemistry began in the 1800s, in step with the development of organic chemistry. Some noteworthy developments:\nUses.\nHeterocyclic compounds are pervasive in many areas of life sciences and technology. Many drugs are heterocyclic compounds. Among the modifications to the family of antitumor compounds, heterocyclic organic compounds have been extensively applied by many groups in order to modify the reactivity profile. Pyrrole, pyrimidine, indole, quinoline and purine are few classes of heterocycles which showed interesting cytotoxicity profiles, which can be highly beneficial when developing cancer drugs.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It has also been suggested that pressure wave effects can cause indirect bone fractures at a distance from the projectile path, although it was later demonstrated that indirect bone fractures are caused by temporary cavity effects (strain placed on the bone by the radial tissue displacement produced by the temporary cavity formation).\nProponents of the concept argue that hydrostatic shock can produce remote neural damage and produce incapacitation more quickly than blood loss effects. In arguments about the differences in stopping power between calibers and between cartridge models, proponents of cartridges that are \"light and fast\" (such as the 9\u00d719mm Parabellum) versus cartridges that are \"slow and heavy\" (such as the .45 ACP) often refer to this phenomenon.\nMartin Fackler has argued that sonic pressure waves do not cause tissue disruption and that temporary cavity formation is the actual cause of tissue disruption mistakenly ascribed to sonic pressure waves. One review noted that strong opinion divided papers on whether the pressure wave contributes to wound injury. It ultimately concluded that no \"conclusive evidence could be found for permanent pathological effects produced by the pressure wave\".\nOrigin of the hypothesis.\nAn early mention of \"hydrostatic shock\" appeared in \"Popular Mechanics\" in April 1942. \nIn the scientific literature, the first discussion of pressure waves created when a bullet hits a living target is presented by E. Harvey Newton and his research group at Princeton University in 1947:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;It is generally recognized that when a high-velocity missile strikes the body and moves through soft tissues, pressures develop which are measured in thousands of atmospheres. Actually, three different types of pressure change appear: (1) shock wave pressures or sharp, high-pressure pulses, formed when the missile hits the body surface; (2) very high-pressure regions immediately in front and to each side of the moving missile; (3) relatively slow, low-pressure changes connected with the behavior of the large explosive temporary cavity, formed behind the missile. Such pressure changes appear to be responsible for what is known to hunters as hydraulic shock\u2014a hydraulic transmission of energy that is believed to cause instant death of animals hit by high-velocity bullets (Powell (1)).\nFrank Chamberlin, a World War II trauma surgeon and ballistics researcher, noted remote pressure wave effects. Col. Chamberlin described what he called \"explosive effects\" and \"hydraulic reaction\" of bullets in tissue. \"...liquids are put in motion by 'shock waves' or hydraulic effects... with liquid filled tissues, the effects and destruction of tissues extend in all directions far beyond the wound axis\". He avoided the ambiguous use of the term \"shock\" because it can refer to either a specific kind of pressure wave associated with explosions and supersonic projectiles or to a medical condition in the body.\nCol. Chamberlin recognized that many theories have been advanced in wound ballistics. During World War II he commanded an 8,500-bed hospital center that treated over 67,000 patients during the fourteen months that he operated it. P.O. Ackley estimates that 85% of the patients were suffering from gunshot wounds. Col. Chamberlin spent many hours interviewing patients as to their reactions to bullet wounds. He conducted many live animal experiments after his tour of duty. On the subject of wound ballistics theories, he wrote:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;If I had to pick one of these theories as gospel, I'd still go along with the Hydraulic Reaction of the Body Fluids plus the reactions on the Central Nervous System.\nOther World War II era scientists noted remote pressure wave effects in the peripheral nerves. There was support for the idea of remote neural effects of ballistic pressure waves in the medical and scientific communities, but the phrase \"hydrostatic shock\" and similar phrases including \"shock\" were used mainly by gunwriters (such as Jack O'Conner) and the small arms industry (such as Roy Weatherby, and Federal \"Hydra-Shok.\")\nArguments against.\nMartin Fackler, a Vietnam-era trauma surgeon, wound ballistics researcher, a colonel in the U.S. Army and the head of the Wound Ballistics Laboratory for the U.S. Army's Medical Training Center, Letterman Institute, claimed that hydrostatic shock had been disproved and that the assertion that a pressure wave plays a role in injury or incapacitation is a myth. Others expressed similar views.\nFackler based his argument on the lithotriptor, a tool commonly used to break up kidney stones. A lithotriptor uses sonic pressure waves which are stronger than those caused by most handgun bullets, yet it produces no damage to soft tissues whatsoever. Hence, Fackler argued, ballistic pressure waves cannot damage tissue either.\nFackler claimed that a study of rifle bullet wounds in Vietnam (Wound Data and Munitions Effectiveness Team) found \"no cases of bones being broken, or major vessels torn, that were not hit by the penetrating bullet. In only two cases, an organ that was not hit (but was within a few cm of the projectile path), suffered some disruption.\" Fackler cited a personal communication with R. F. Bellamy. However, Bellamy's published findings the following year estimated that 10% of fractures in the data set might be due to indirect injuries, and one specific case is described in detail (pp.\u00a0153\u2013154). In addition, the published analysis documents five instances of abdominal wounding in cases where the bullet did not penetrate the abdominal cavity (pp.\u00a0149\u2013152), a case of lung contusion resulting from a hit to the shoulder (pp.\u00a0146\u2013149), and a case of indirect effects on the central nervous system (p.\u00a0155). Fackler's critics argue that his evidence does not contradict distant injuries, as Fackler claimed, but the WDMET data from Vietnam actually provides supporting evidence for it.\nA summary of the debate was published in 2009 as part of a \"Historical Overview of Wound Ballistics Research.\"\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Fackler [10, 13] however, disputed the shock wave hypothesis, claiming there is no physical evidence to support it, although some support for this hypothesis had already been provided by Harvey [20, 21], Kolsky [31], Suneson et. al. [42, 43], and Crucq [5]. Since that time, other authors suggest there is increasing evidence to support the hypothesis that shock waves from high velocity bullets can cause tissue related damage and damage to the nervous system. This has been shown in various experiments using simulant models [24, 48]. One of the most interesting is a study by Courtney and Courtney [4] who showed a link between traumatic brain injury and pressure waves originating in the thoracic cavity and extremities.\u2014\u200a\nDistant injuries in the WDMET data.\nThe Wound Data and Munitions Effectiveness Team (WDMET) gathered data on wounds sustained during the Vietnam War. In their analysis of this data published in the \"Textbook of Military Medicine\", Ronald Bellamy and Russ Zajtchuck point out a number of cases which seem to be examples of distant injuries. Bellamy and Zajtchuck describe three mechanisms of distant wounding due to pressure transients: 1) stress waves 2) shear waves and 3) a vascular pressure impulse.\nAfter citing Harvey's conclusion that \"stress waves probably do not cause any tissue damage\" (p.\u00a0136), Bellamy and Zajtchuck express their view that Harvey's interpretation might not be definitive because they write \"the possibility that stress waves from a penetrating projectile might also cause tissue damage cannot be ruled out.\" (p.\u00a0136) The WDMET data includes a case of a lung contusion resulting from a hit to the shoulder. The caption to Figure 4-40 (p.\u00a0149) says, \"The pulmonary injury may be the result of a stress wave.\" They describe the possibility that a hit to a soldier's trapezius muscle caused temporary paralysis due to \"the stress wave passing through the soldier's neck indirectly [causing] cervical cord dysfunction.\" (p.\u00a0155)\nIn addition to stress waves, Bellamy and Zajtchuck describe shear waves as a possible mechanism of indirect injuries in the WDMET data. They estimate that 10% of bone fractures in the data may be the result of indirect injuries, that is, bones fractured by the bullet passing close to the bone without a direct impact. A Chinese experiment is cited which provides a formula estimating how pressure magnitude decreases with distance. Together with the difference between strength of human bones and strength of the animal bones in the Chinese experiment, Bellamy and Zajtchuck use this formula to estimate that assault rifle rounds \"passing within a centimeter of a long bone might very well be capable of causing an indirect fracture.\" (p.\u00a0153) Bellamy and Zajtchuck suggest the fracture in Figures 4-46 and 4-47 is likely an indirect fracture of this type. Damage due to shear waves extends to even greater distances in abdominal injuries in the WDMET data. Bellamy and Zajtchuck write, \"The abdomen is one body region in which damage from indirect effects may be common.\" (p.\u00a0150) Injuries to the liver and bowel shown in Figures 4-42 and 4-43 are described, \"The damage shown in these examples extends far beyond the tissue that is likely to direct contact with the projectile.\" (p.\u00a0150)\nIn addition to providing examples from the WDMET data for indirect injury due to propagating shear and stress waves, Bellamy and Zajtchuck expresses an openness to the idea of pressure transients propagating via blood vessels can cause indirect injuries. \"For example, pressure transients arising from an abdominal gunshot wound might propagate through the vena cavae and jugular venous system into the cranial cavity and cause a precipitous rise in intracranial pressure there, with attendant transient neurological dysfunction.\" (p.\u00a0154) However, no examples of this injury mechanism are presented from the WDMET data. However, the authors suggest the need for additional studies writing, \"Clinical and experimental data need to be gathered before such indirect injuries can be confirmed.\" Distant injuries of this nature were later confirmed in the experimental data of Swedish and Chinese researchers, in the clinical findings of Krajsa and in autopsy findings from Iraq.\nAutopsy findings.\nProponents of the concept point to human autopsy results demonstrating brain hemorrhaging from fatal hits to the chest, including cases with handgun bullets. Thirty-three cases of fatal penetrating chest wounds by a single bullet were selected from a much larger set by excluding all other traumatic factors, including past history.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;In such meticulously selected cases brain tissue was examined histologically; samples were taken from brain hemispheres, basal ganglia, the pons, the oblongate and from the cerebellum. Cufflike pattern hemorrhages around small brain vessels were found in all specimens. These hemorrhages are caused by sudden changes of the intravascular blood pressure as a result of a compression of intrathoracic great vessels by a shock wave caused by a penetrating bullet.\nAn 8-month study in Iraq performed in 2010 and published in 2011 reports on autopsies of 30 gunshot victims struck with high-velocity (greater than 2500 fps) rifle bullets. The authors determined that the lungs and chest are the most susceptible to distant wounding, followed by the abdomen. The study noted that the \"sample size was so small [too small] to reach the level of statistical significance\". Nevertheless, the authors conclude:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Distant injuries away from the main track in high-velocity missile injuries are very important and almost always present in all cases, especially in the chest and abdomen and this should be put in the consideration on the part of the forensic pathologist\nand probably the general surgeon.\nInferences from blast pressure wave observations.\nA shock wave can be created when fluid is rapidly displaced by an explosive or projectile. Tissue behaves similarly enough to water that a sonic pressure wave can be created by a bullet impact, generating pressures in excess of .\nDuncan MacPherson, a former member of the International Wound Ballistics Association and author of the book, \"Bullet Penetration\", claimed that shock waves cannot result from bullet impacts with tissue. In contrast, Brad Sturtevant, a leading researcher in shock wave physics at Caltech for many decades, found that shock waves can result from handgun bullet impacts in tissue. Other sources indicate that ballistic impacts can create shock waves in tissue.\nBlast and ballistic pressure waves have physical similarities. Prior to wave reflection, they both are characterized by a steep wave front followed by a nearly exponential decay at close distances. They have similarities in how they cause neural effects in the brain. In tissue, both types of pressure waves have similar magnitudes, duration, and frequency characteristics. Both have been shown to cause damage in the hippocampus. It has been hypothesized that both reach the brain from the thoracic cavity via major blood vessels.\nFor example, Ibolja Cernak, a leading researcher in blast wave injury at the Applied Physics Laboratory at Johns Hopkins University, hypothesized, \"alterations in brain function following blast exposure are induced by kinetic energy transfer of blast overpressure via great blood vessels in abdomen and thorax to the central nervous system.\" This hypothesis is supported by observations of neural effects in the brain from localized blast exposure focused on the lungs in experiments in animals.\nPhysics of ballistic pressure waves.\nA number of papers describe the physics of ballistic pressure waves created when a high-speed projectile enters a viscous medium. These results show that ballistic impacts produce pressure waves that propagate at close to the speed of sound.\nLee et al. present an analytical model showing that unreflected ballistic pressure waves are well approximated by an exponential decay, which is similar to blast pressure waves. Lee et al. note the importance of the energy transfer:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;As would be expected, an accurate estimation of the kinetic energy loss by a projectile is always important in determining the ballistic waves.\u2014\u200a\nThe rigorous calculations of Lee et al. require knowing the drag coefficient and frontal area of the penetrating projectile at every instant of the penetration. Since this is not generally possible with expanding handgun bullets, Courtney and Courtney developed a model for estimating the peak pressure waves of handgun bullets from the impact energy and penetration depth in ballistic gelatin. This model agrees with the more rigorous approach of Lee et al. for projectiles where they can both be applied. For expanding handgun bullets, the peak pressure wave magnitude is proportional to the bullet's kinetic energy divided by the penetration depth.\nRemote cerebral effects of ballistic pressure waves.\nG\u00f6ransson et al. were the first contemporary researchers to present compelling evidence for remote cerebral effects of extremity bullet impact. They observed changes in EEG readings from pigs shot in the thigh. A follow-up experiment by Suneson et al. implanted high-speed pressure transducers into the brain of pigs and demonstrated that a significant pressure wave reaches the brain of pigs shot in the thigh. These scientists observed apnea, depressed EEG readings, and neural damage in the brain caused by the distant effects of the ballistic pressure wave originating in the thigh.\nThe results of Suneson et al. were confirmed and expanded upon by a later experiment in dogs\nwhich \"confirmed that distant effect exists in the central nervous system after a high-energy missile impact to an extremity. A high-frequency oscillating pressure wave with large amplitude and short duration was found in the brain after the extremity impact of a high-energy missile...\" Wang et al. observed significant damage in both the hypothalamus and hippocampus regions of the brain due to remote effects of the ballistic pressure wave.\nRemote pressure wave effects in the spine and internal organs.\nIn a study of a handgun injury, Sturtevant found that pressure waves from a bullet impact in the torso can reach the spine and that a focusing effect from concave surfaces can concentrate the pressure wave on the spinal cord producing significant injury. This is consistent with other work showing remote spinal cord injuries from ballistic impacts.\nRoberts et al. present both experimental work and finite element modeling showing that there can be considerable pressure wave magnitudes in the thoracic cavity for handgun projectiles stopped by a Kevlar vest. For example, an 8\u00a0gram projectile at 360\u00a0m/s impacting a NIJ level II vest over the sternum can produce an estimated pressure wave level of nearly 2.0 MPa (280 psi) in the heart and a pressure wave level of nearly 1.5 MPa (210 psi) in the lungs. Impacting over the liver can produce an estimated pressure wave level of 2.0 MPa (280 psi) in the liver.\nEnergy transfer required for remote neural effects.\nThe work of Courtney et al. supports the role of a ballistic pressure wave in incapacitation and injury. The work of Suneson et al. and Courtney et al. suggest that remote neural effects can occur with levels of energy transfer possible with handguns, about . Using sensitive biochemical techniques, the work of Wang et al. suggests even lower impact energy thresholds for remote neural injury to the brain. In analysis of experiments of dogs shot in the thigh they report highly significant (p &lt; 0.01), easily detectable neural effects in the hypothalamus and hippocampus with energy transfer levels close to . Wang et al. reports less significant (p &lt; 0.05) remote effects in the hypothalamus with energy transfer just under .\nEven though Wang et al. document remote neural damage for low levels of energy transfer, roughly , these levels of neural damage are probably too small to contribute to rapid incapacitation. Courtney and Courtney believe that remote neural effects only begin to make significant contributions to rapid incapacitation for ballistic pressure wave levels above (corresponds to transferring roughly in of penetration) and become easily observable above (corresponds to transferring roughly in of penetration). Incapacitating effects in this range of energy transfer are consistent with observations of remote spinal injuries, observations of suppressed EEGs and apnea in pigs and with observations of incapacitating effects of ballistic pressure waves without a wound channel.\nOther scientific findings.\nThe scientific literature contains significant other findings regarding injury mechanisms of ballistic pressure waves. Ming et al. found that ballistic pressure waves can break bones. Tikka et al. reports abdominal pressure changes produced in pigs hit in one thigh. Akimov et al. report on injuries to the nerve trunk from gunshot wounds to the extremities.\nHydrostatic shock as a factor in selection of ammunition.\nAmmunition selection for self-defense, military, and law enforcement.\nIn self-defense, military, and law enforcement communities, opinions vary regarding the importance of remote wounding effects in ammunition design and selection. In his book on hostage rescuers, Leroy Thompson discusses the importance of hydrostatic shock in choosing a specific design of .357 Magnum and 9\u00d719mm Parabellum bullets. In \"Armed and Female\", Paxton Quigley explains that hydrostatic shock is the real source of \"stopping power.\" Jim Carmichael, who served as shooting editor for \"Outdoor Life\" magazine for 25 years, believes that hydrostatic shock is important to \"a more immediate disabling effect\" and is a key difference in the performance of .38 Special and .357 Magnum hollow point bullets. In \"The search for an effective police handgun,\" Allen Bristow describes that police departments recognize the importance of hydrostatic shock when choosing ammunition. A research group at West Point suggests handgun loads with at least of energy and of penetration and recommends:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;One should not be overly impressed by the propensity for shallow penetrating loads to produce larger pressure waves. Selection criteria should first determine the required penetration depth for the given risk assessment and application, and only use pressure wave magnitude as a selection criterion for loads meeting minimum penetration requirements. Reliable expansion, penetration, feeding, and functioning are all important aspects of load testing and selection. We do not advocate abandoning long-held aspects of the load testing and selection process, but it seems prudent to consider the pressure wave magnitude along with other factors.\u2014\u200a\nA number of law enforcement and military agencies have adopted the 5.7\u00d728mm cartridge. These agencies include the Navy SEALs and the Federal Protective Service branch of the ICE. In contrast, some defense contractors, law enforcement analysts, and military analysts say that hydrostatic shock is an unimportant factor when selecting cartridges for a particular use because any incapacitating effect it may have on a target is difficult to measure and inconsistent from one individual to the next. This is in contrast to factors such as proper shot placement and massive blood loss which are almost always eventually incapacitating for nearly every individual.\nThe FBI recommends that loads intended for self-defense and law enforcement applications meet a minimum penetration requirement of in ballistic gelatin and explicitly advises against selecting rounds based on hydrostatic shock effects.\nAmmunition selection for hunting.\nHydrostatic shock is commonly considered as a factor in the selection of hunting ammunition. Peter Capstick explains that hydrostatic shock may have value for animals up to the size of white-tailed deer, but the ratio of energy transfer to animal weight is an important consideration for larger animals. If the animal's weight exceeds the bullet's energy transfer, penetration in an undeviating line to a vital organ is a much more important consideration than energy transfer and hydrostatic shock. Jim Carmichael, in contrast, describes evidence that hydrostatic shock can affect animals as large as Cape Buffalo in the results of a carefully controlled study carried out by veterinarians in a buffalo culling operation.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Whereas virtually all of our opinions about knockdown power are based on isolated examples, the data gathered during the culling operation was taken from a number of animals. Even more important, the animals were then examined and dissected in a scientific manner by professionals.\nPredictably, some of the buffalo dropped where they were shot and some didn't, even though all received near-identical hits in the vital heart-lung area. When the brains of all the buffalo were removed, the researchers discovered that those that had been knocked down instantly had suffered massive rupturing of blood vessels in the brain. The brains of animals that hadn't fallen instantly showed no such damage.\u2014\u200a\nRandall Gilbert describes hydrostatic shock as an important factor in bullet performance on whitetail deer, \"When it [a bullet] enters a whitetail\u2019s body, huge accompanying shock waves send vast amounts of energy through nearby organs, sending them into arrest or shut down.\" Dave Ehrig expresses the view that hydrostatic shock depends on impact velocities above per second. Sid Evans explains the performance of the Nosler Partition bullet and Federal Cartridge Company's decision to load this bullet in terms of the large tissue cavitation and hydrostatic shock produced from the frontal diameter of the expanded bullet. The North American Hunting Club suggests big game cartridges that create enough hydrostatic shock to quickly bring animals down.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The authentication of hadith became a significant discipline, focusing on the \"isnad\" (chain of narrators) and \"matn\" (main text of the report). This process aimed to address contradictions and questionable statements within certain narrations. Beginning one or two centuries after Muhammad's death, Islamic scholars, known as muhaddiths, compiled hadith into distinct collections that survive in the historical works of writers from the second and third centuries of the Muslim era (c.\u2009700\u22121000 CE).\nFor many Muslim sects, hadith was a reliable source for religious and moral guidance known as sunnah, which ranks second to that of the Quran in authority, widely respected in mainstream Islamic thought, so that the majority of Sharia rules derived from hadith rather than the Quran. However, in the early Islamic society the use of hadith as it is understood today (documentation, isnads, etc.) came gradually. Sunnah originally meant a tradition that did not contain the definition of good and bad. Later, \"good traditions\" began to be referred to as sunnah and the concept of \"Muhammad's sunnah\" was established. Muhammad's sunnah gave way to the \"hadiths of Muhammad\" which were being transmitted orally, then recorded in the corpuses that continued to be collected, classified and purified according to various criteria in the following centuries. Scholars have categorized hadith based on their reliability, sorting them into classifications such as \"sahih\" ('authentic'), \"hasan\" ('good'), and \"da'if\" ('weak'). This classification is subjective to the person doing this study and differences in classification have led to variations in practices among the different Islamic schools and branches. The study of hadith is a central discipline in Islam, known as the hadith sciences, and is also examined in the contemporary historiographical field of hadith studies.\nAfter being compiled in the 10th and 11th centuries, the Hadith were originally imposed in the 14th century by socio-political and spiritual authorities. A minority of Muslims criticise the hadith and reject them, including Quranists, who \nassert that Islamic guidance should rely solely on the Quran. They argue that many hadith are fabrications (pseudepigrapha) from the 8th and 9th centuries, falsely attributed to Muhammad. Historically, some sects of the Kharijites also rejected the hadiths, while Mu'tazilites rejected the hadiths as the basis for Islamic law, while at the same time accepting the Sunnah and Ijma.\nWestern scholars participating in the field of hadith studies are generally skeptical of the value of hadith for understanding the true historical Muhammad. Reasons for skepticism include the late compilation of hadith (often centuries after Muhammad\u2019s death), difficulties in verifying chains of transmission, the prevalence of hadith fabrication, and doubts about the traditional methods of hadith authentication. This skepticism extends even to hadith classified as \"sahih\" by Muslim scholars, as such narrations may still reflect later historical or theological concerns rather than the authentic teachings of Muhammad.\nEtymology.\nIn Arabic, the noun ( \u00a0) means 'report', 'account', or 'narrative'. Its Arabic plural is ( ). \"Hadith\" also refers to the speech of a person.\nDefinition / Evolution of the concept.\nIn Islamic terminology, according to Juan Campo, the term \"hadith\" refers to reports of statements or actions of Muhammad, or of his tacit approval or criticism of something said or done in his presence. Classical hadith specialist Ibn Hajar al-Asqalani says that the intended meaning of \"hadith\" in religious tradition is something attributed to Muhammad, but that is not found in the Quran.\nIn contrast, according to the Shia Islam Ahlul Bayt Digital Library Project, \"when there is no clear Qur'anic statement, nor is there a Hadith upon which Muslim schools have agreed. ... Shi'a ... refer to Ahlul-Bayt [the family of Muhammad] to derive the Sunnah of the Prophet, implying that while hadith is limited to the \"Traditions\" of Muhammad, the Shi'a Sunna draws on the sayings, etc. of the , i.e. the Imams of Shi'a Islam.\n Hadith may be \"hadith qudsi\" (sacred hadith)\u2014which some Muslims regard as the words of God\u2014or \"hadith sharif\" (noble hadith), which are Muhammad's own utterances. According to as-Sayyid ash-Sharif al-Jurjani, the hadith qudsi differ from the Quran in that the former are \"expressed in Muhammad's words\", whereas the latter are the \"direct words of God\". A \"hadith qudsi\" need not be a \"sahih\" (sound hadith), but may be \"da'if\" (weak) or even \"mawdu\"' (fabricated).\nAn example of a \"hadith qudsi\" is the hadith of Abu Hurairah who said that Muhammad said:\nWhen God decreed the Creation He pledged Himself by writing in His book which is laid down with Him: My mercy prevails over My wrath.\nNon-prophetic hadith; Scholar Patricia Crone includes reports by others than Muhammad in her definition of hadith: \"short reports (sometimes just a line or two) recording what an early figure, such as a companion of the prophet or Muhammad himself, said or did on a particular occasion, preceded by a chain of transmitters\". However, she adds that \"nowadays, hadith almost always means hadith from Muhammad himself.\" Joseph Schacht quotes a hadith of Muhammad that is used \"to justify reference\" in Islamic law to the companions of Muhammad as religious authorities\u2014\"My companions are like lodestars.\"\nAccording to Schacht, (and other scholars) in the very first generations after the death of Muhammad, use of hadith from (\"companions\" of Muhammad) and (\"successors\" of the companions) \"was the rule\", while use of hadith of Muhammad himself by Muslims was \"the exception\". Schacht credits Al-Shafi'i\u2014founder of the Shafi'i school of (or )\u2014with establishing the principle of the using the hadith of Muhammad for Islamic law, and emphasizing the inferiority of hadith of anyone else, saying hadiths:\n\"... from other persons are of no account in the face of a tradition from the Prophet, whether they confirm or contradict it; if the other persons had been aware of the tradition from the Prophet, they would have followed it\". This led to \"the almost complete neglect\" of traditions from the Companions and others.\nCollections of hadith sometimes mix those of Muhammad with the reports of others. Muwatta Imam Malik is usually described as \"the earliest written collection of hadith\" but sayings of Muhammad are \"blended with the sayings of the companions\", (822 hadith from Muhammad and 898 from others, according to the count of one edition).\nIn \"Introduction to Hadith\" by Abd al-Hadi al-Fadli, is referred to as \"the first hadith book of the (family of Muhammad) to be written on the authority of the Prophet\". Hadiths were classified as follows according to the last person to whom they were attributed in the chain of narration; the acts, statements or approvals of Muhammad are called , while those of companions are called , and those of Tabi'un are called .\nRelationship with \"sunnah\".\nThe word is also used in reference to a normative custom of Muhammad or the early Muslim community. Joseph Schacht describes hadith as providing \"the documentation\" of the . Some sources (Khaled Abou El Fadl) limit hadith to verbal reports, with the deeds of Muhammad and reports about his companions being part of the , but not hadith.\nAnother source (Joseph A. Islam) distinguishes between the two saying: \nWhereas the 'Hadith' is an oral communication that is allegedly derived from the Prophet or his teachings, the 'Sunna' (quite literally: mode of life, behaviour or example) signifies the prevailing customs of a particular community or people. ... A 'Sunna' is a practice which has been passed on by a community from generation to generation en masse, whereas the hadith are reports collected by later compilers often centuries removed from the source. ... A practice which is contained within the Hadith may well be regarded as Sunna, but it is not necessary that a Sunna would have a supporting hadith sanctioning it.\nSunnah originally meant a tradition (urf) that did not mean good or bad. Later, \"good traditions\" began to be referred to as sunnah in Islamic community and the concept of \"Muhammad's sunnah\" was established. Muhammad's sunnah gave way to the \"hadiths of Muhammad\" which were transmitted orally, then recorded in corpuses and systematized and purified within following centuries. Hadiths were later placed in a respected place among the sources of sharia in many Islamic sects, and thus replaced the sunnah in the establishment of sharia.\nSimilar literature.\nIslamic literary classifications similar to hadith (but not ) are and . They differ from hadith in that they are organized \"relatively chronologically\" rather than by subject. \nOther traditions of Islam related to hadith include: \nCompilation and collections.\nThe hadith literature in use today is based on spoken reports in circulation after the death of Muhammad. Hadith were not promptly written down during Muhammad's lifetime or immediately after his death. Hadiths are oral cultural products consisting of words and deeds, the majority of which were documented several centuries after the time of Muhammad (Sunni sources, approximately 200\u2013300 years and Shiite hadith books 400\u2013500) and attributed to Muhammad through a chain of narrators over 1-2\u00a0mi away from where Muhammad is thought to have lived.\nDifferent branches of Islam refer to different collections of hadith, although the same incident may be found in hadith from different collections. In general, the difference between Shi'a and Sunni collections is that Shia give preference to hadiths attributed to Muhammad's family and close companions (\"Ahl al-Bayt\"), while Sunnis do not consider family lineage in evaluating hadith and sunnah narrated by any of twelve thousand companions of Muhammad.\nImpact.\nThe hadith have been called by American-Sunni scholar Jonathan A. C. Brown as \"the backbone\" of Islamic civilization. Much of the early Islamic history available today is also based on the hadith, although it has been challenged for its lack of basis in primary source material and the internal contradictions of available secondary material.\nThe hadith had a profound and controversial influence on \"tafsir\" (commentaries of the Quran). The earliest commentary of the Quran known as Tafsir Ibn Abbas is sometimes attributed to the companion Ibn Abbas. \"Many thousands of times\" more numerous than the verses of the Quran, hadith have been described as resembling layers surrounding the \"core\" of Islamic beliefs (the Quran). Well-known, widely accepted hadith make up the narrow inner layer, with a hadith becoming less reliable and accepted with each layer stretching outward.\nThe hadith were used the form the basis of \"sharia\" (the religious law system forming part of the Islamic tradition), and \"fiqh\" (Islamic jurisprudence). The hadith are at the root of why there is no single \"fiqh\" system, but rather a collection of parallel systems within Islam. Some important elements, which are today taken to be a long-held part of Islamic practice and belief are not mentioned in the Quran, but are reported in hadiths. The reports of Muhammad's (and sometimes his companions') behavior collected by hadith compilers include details of ritual religious practice such as the five (obligatory Islamic prayers) that are not found in the Quran, as well as everyday behavior such as table manners, dress, and posture. Hadith are also regarded by Muslims as important tools for understanding things mentioned in the Quran but not explained, a source for (commentaries written on the Quran). Therefore, Muslims usually maintain that hadiths are a necessary requirement for the true and proper practice of Islam, as it gives Muslims the nuanced details of Islamic practice and belief in areas where the Quran is silent. Details of the prescribed movements and words of the prayer (known as ) and how many times they are to be performed, are found in hadith. However, hadiths differ on these details and consequently is performed differently by different hadithist Islamic sects.\nQuranists, on the other hand, believe that if the Quran is silent on some matter, it is because God did not hold its detail to be of consequence; and that some hadith contradict the Quran, proving that some hadith are a source of corruption and not a complement to the Quran.\nHadiths were also deployed to legitimize Sufism\u2019s more formal structures of brotherhoods (tariqas), hierarchies of initiation, and rituals that were articulated from the 9th century onward. Some readings had a ceremonial value sanctifying occasions such as the ascent of a dynast or the birth of a child. (a religious scholar, religious or political leader)\nHistory, tradition and usage.\nHistory.\nAccording to British historian of Arab world Alfred Guillaume, it is \"certain\" that \"several small collections\" of hadith were \"assembled in Umayyad times.\" There are conflicting reports as to whether recording hadiths from the pre-Umayyad period was recommended or prohibited, and there is no extant collection of hadiths from this period. (see:Ban on Hadith)\nIn Islamic law, the use of hadith as it is understood today (hadith of Muhammad with documentation, isnads, etc.) came gradually. According to scholars such as Joseph Schacht, Ignaz Goldziher, and Daniel W. Brown, early schools of Islamic jurisprudence used the rulings of the Prophet's Companions, the rulings of the Caliphs, and practices that \"had gained general acceptance among the jurists of that school\". On his deathbed, Caliph Umar instructed Muslims to seek guidance from the Quran, the early Muslims (\"muhajirun\") who emigrated to Medina with Muhammad, the Medina residents who welcomed and supported the \"muhajirun\" (the \"ansar\") and the people of the desert.\nIt was Ab\u016b \u02bfAbdull\u0101h Muhammad ibn Idr\u012bs al-Sh\u0101fi\u02bf\u012b (150-204 AH), known as al-Shafi'i, who emphasized the final authority of a hadith of Muhammad, so that even the Quran was \"to be interpreted in the light of traditions (i.e. hadith), and not vice versa.\" While traditionally the Qur'an has traditionally been considered superior in authority to the sunna, Al-Shafi'i \"forcefully argued\" that the sunna was \"on equal footing with the Quran\", (according to scholar Daniel Brown) for (as Al-Shafi'i put it) \"the command of the Prophet is the command of God.\" According to the scholars Harald Motzki and Daniel W. Brown the earliest Islamic legal reasonings that have come down to us were \"virtually hadith-free\", but gradually, over the course of second century A.H. \"the infiltration and incorporation of Prophetic hadiths into Islamic jurisprudence\" took place.\nIn 851 the rationalist Mu`tazila school of thought fell out of favor in the Abbasid Caliphate. The Mu`tazila, for whom the \"judge of truth ... was human reason,\" had clashed with traditionists who looked to the literal meaning of the Quran and hadith for truth. While the Quran had been officially compiled and approved, hadiths had not.\nOne result was the number of hadiths began \"multiplying in suspiciously direct correlation to their utility\" to the quoter of the hadith (Traditionists quoted hadith warning against listening to human opinion instead of Sharia; Hanafites quoted a hadith stating that \"In my community there will rise a man called Abu Hanifa [the Hanafite founder] who will be its guiding light\". In fact one agreed upon hadith warned that, \"There will be forgers, liars who will bring you hadiths which neither you nor your forefathers have heard, Beware of them.\" In addition the number of hadith grew enormously. While Malik ibn Anas had attributed just 1720 statements or deeds to the Muhammad, it was no longer unusual to find people who had collected a hundred times that number of hadith.\nFaced with a huge corpus of miscellaneous traditions supporting different views on a wide variety of controversial matters\u2014some of them flatly contradicting each other\u2014Islamic scholars of the Abbasid period sought to authenticate hadith. Scholars had to decide which hadith were to be trusted as authentic and which had been fabricated for political or theological purposes. To do this, they used a number of techniques which Muslims now call the science of hadith.\nThe earliest surviving hadith manuscripts were copied on papyrus. A long scroll collects traditions transmitted by the scholar and qadi 'Abd All\u0101h ibn Lah\u012b\u02bba (d. 790). A \"\u1e24ad\u012bth D\u0101w\u016bd\" (\"History of David\"), attributed to Wahb ibn Munabbih, survives in a manuscript dated 844. A collection of hadiths dedicated to invocations to God, attributed to a certain Kh\u0101lid ibn Yaz\u012bd, is dated 880\u2013881. A consistent fragment of the \"J\u0101mi\u02bf\" of the Egyptian Maliki jurist 'Abd All\u0101h ibn Wahb (d. 813) is finally dated to 889.\nShia and Sunni textual traditions.\nSunni and Shia hadith collections differ because scholars from the two traditions differ as to the reliability of the narrators and transmitters. Narrators who sided with Abu Bakr and Umar rather than Ali, in the disputes over leadership that followed the death of Muhammad, are considered unreliable by the Shia; narrations attributed to Ali and the family of Muhammad, and to their supporters, are preferred. Sunni scholars put trust in narrators such as Aisha, whom Shia reject. Differences in hadith collections have contributed to differences in worship practices and shari'a law and have hardened the dividing line between the two traditions.\nExtent and nature in the Sunni tradition.\nIn the Sunni tradition, the number of such texts is somewhere between seven and thirteen thousand, but the number of \"hadiths\" is far greater because several \"isnad\" sharing the same text are each counted as individual hadith. If, say, ten companions record a text reporting a single incident in the life of Muhammad, hadith scholars can count this as ten hadiths. Thus, Musnad Ahmad, for example, has over 30,000 hadiths\u2014but this count includes texts that are repeated in order to record slight variations within the text or within the chains of narrations. Identifying the narrators of the various texts, comparing their narrations of the same texts to identify both the soundest reporting of a text and the reporters who are most sound in their reporting occupied experts of hadith throughout the 2nd century. In the 3rd century of Islam (from 225/840 to about 275/889), hadith experts composed brief works recording a selection of about two- to five-thousand such texts which they felt to have been most soundly documented or most widely referred to in the Muslim scholarly community. The 4th and 5th century saw these six works being commented on quite widely. This auxiliary literature has contributed to making their study the place of departure for any serious study of hadith. In addition, Bukhari and Muslim in particular, claimed that they were collecting only the soundest of sound hadiths. These later scholars tested their claims and agreed to them, so that today, they are considered the most reliable collections of hadith. Toward the end of the 5th century, Ibn al-Qaisarani formally standardized the Sunni canon into six pivotal works, a delineation which remains to this day.\nOver the centuries, several different categories of collections have emerged. Some are more general, such as the \"mu\u1e63annaf\", the \"mu\u02bfjam\", and the \"j\u0101mi\u02bf\", and some more specific, characterized either by the subjects covered, such as the \"sunan\" (restricted to legal-liturgical traditions), or by\"their\"s composition, such as the \"arba\u02bf\u012bniyy\u0101t\" (collections of forty hadiths).\nExtent and nature in the Shia tradition.\nShi'a Muslims seldom if ever use the six major hadith collections followed by the Sunnis because they do not trust many of the Sunni narrators and transmitters. They have their own extensive hadith literature. The best-known hadith collections are The Four Books, which were compiled by three authors who are known as the 'Three Muhammads'. The Four Books are: \"Kitab al-Kafi\" by Muhammad ibn Ya'qub al-Kulayni al-Razi (329 AH), \"Man la yahduruhu al-Faqih\" by Muhammad ibn Babuya and \"Al-Tahdhib\" and \"Al-Istibsar\" both by Shaykh Muhammad Tusi. Shi'a clerics also make use of extensive collections and commentaries by later authors.\nUnlike Sunnis, the majority of Shia do not consider any of their hadith collections to be sahih (authentic) in their entirety. Therefore, each individual hadith in a specific collection must be investigated separately to determine its authenticity. The Akhbari school, however, considers all the hadith from the four books to be authentic.\nThe importance of hadith in the Shia school of thought is well documented. This can be captured by Ali ibn Abi Talib, cousin of Muhammad, when he narrated that \"Whoever of our Shia (followers) knows our Shariah and takes out the weak of our followers from the darkness of ignorance to the light of knowledge (Hadith) which we (Ahl al-Bayt) have gifted to them, he on the day of judgement will come with a crown on his head. It will shine among the people gathered on the plain of resurrection.\" Hassan al-Askari, a descendant of Muhammad, gave support to this narration, stating \"Whoever he had taken out in the worldly life from the darkness of ignorance can hold to his light to be taken out of the darkness of the plain of resurrection to the garden (paradise). Then all those whomever he had taught in the worldly life anything of goodness, or had opened from his heart a lock of ignorance or had removed his doubts will come out.\"\nRegarding the importance of maintaining accuracy in recording hadith, it has been documented that Muhammad al-Baqir, the great-grandson of Muhammad, has said that \"Holding back in a doubtful issue is better than entering destruction. Your not narrating a Hadith is better than you narrating a Hadith in which you have not studied thoroughly. On every truth, there is a reality. Above every right thing, there is a light. Whatever agrees with the book of Allah you must take it and whatever disagrees you must leave it alone.\" Al-Baqir also emphasized the selfless devotion of Ahl al-Bayt to preserving the traditions of Muhammad through his conversation with Jabir ibn Abd Allah, an old companion of Muhammad. He (Al-Baqir) said, \"Oh Jabir, had we spoken to you from our opinions and desires, we would be counted among those who are destroyed. We speak to you of the hadith which we treasure from the Messenger of Allah, Oh Allah grant compensation to Muhammad and his family worthy of their services to your cause, just as they treasure their gold and silver.\" Further, it has been narrated that Ja'far al-Sadiq, the son of al-Baqir, has said the following regarding hadith: \"You must write it down; you will not memorize until you write it down.\"\nModern usage.\nHadith as an Interpretation of the Quran:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Move not your tongue with it, to hasten with recitation of it. Indeed, upon Us is its collection and its recitation. So when We have recited it, then follow its recitation. Then upon Us is Interpretation. Surah Al Qiyamah, verse 16\u201319.\nModern approaches include criticism of the text and content in addition to classical approaches that don't go beyond the criticism of the chain of narrators called \"sanad\" in order to verify a hadith; Weakness in the pronunciation of the text, the strange meaning, contrary to the dalil syar'i (evidences of sharia), and the mind, related to the priority of the mind, contains abominations, isra'iliyyat and bid'ah, not found in the main hadith book and exaggerates the reward or punishment for light deeds etc.\nThe mainstream sects consider hadith to be essential supplements to, and clarifications of, the Quran, Islam's holy book, as well as for clarifying issues pertaining to Islamic jurisprudence. Ibn al-Salah, a hadith specialist, described the relationship between hadith and other aspects of the religion by saying: \"It is the science most pervasive in respect to the other sciences in their various branches, in particular to jurisprudence being the most important of them.\" \"The intended meaning of 'other sciences' here are those pertaining to religion,\" explains Ibn Hajar al-Asqalani, \"Quranic exegesis, hadith, and jurisprudence. The science of hadith became the most pervasive due to the need displayed by each of these three sciences. The need hadith has of its science is apparent. As for Quranic exegesis, then the preferred manner of explaining the speech of God is by means of what has been accepted as a statement of Muhammad. The one looking to this is in need of distinguishing the acceptable from the unacceptable. Regarding jurisprudence, then the jurist is in need of citing as an evidence the acceptable to the exception of the later, something only possible utilizing the science of hadith.\"\nWestern scholarship.\nWestern scholarly criticism of hadith began in colonial India in the mid 19th century with the works of Aloys Sprenger and William Muir. These works were generally critical of the reliability of hadith, suggesting that traditional Muslim scholarship was incapable of determining the authenticity of hadith, and that the hadith tradition had been corrupted by widespread fabrication of fraudulent hadith. The late 19th century work of Ignaz Goldziher, \"Muhammedanische Studien\" (\"Muslim Studies\"), is considered seminal in the field of Western hadith studies. Goldziher took the same critical approach as Sprenger and Muir, suggesting that many hadith showed anachronistic elements indicating that they were not authentic, and that the many contradictory hadith made the value of the entire corpus questionable.\nThe work of Joseph Schacht in the 1950s sought to obtain a critical understanding of the chains of transmission of particular hadith, focusing on the convergence of transmission chains of particular hadith back to a single \"common link\" from who all later sources ultimately obtained the hadith, who Schacht considered to be the likely true author of the hadith, which could allow dating of when particular hadith began circulating. This method is widely influential in Western hadith scholarship, though has received criticism from some scholars. Schacht's arguments regarding the validity of hadith have been vigorously disputed by Muslim scholars like Muhammad Mustafa Azmi, who contended that hadiths were written down already during Muhammads lifetime, and that large scale creation of fraudulent hadiths was implausible.\nSome modern scholars have contested Schacht's assertion that the \"common links\" were likely forgers of the hadith, instead suggesting that they were avid collectors of hadiths, though their arguments for this have been criticised by other scholars.\nStudies and authentication.\nThe two major aspects of a hadith are the text of the report (the \"matn\"), which contains the actual narrative, and the chain of narrators (the \"isnad\"), which documents the route by which the report has been transmitted. The isnad was an effort to document that a hadith actually came from Muhammad, and Muslim scholars from the eighth century to the present have never ceased to repeat the mantra \"The isnad is part of the religion\u2014if not for the isnad, whoever wanted could say whatever they wanted.\" The \"isnad\" literally means \"support\", and it is so named because hadith specialists rely on it to determine the authenticity or weakness of a hadith. The \"isnad\" consists of a chronological list of the narrators, each mentioning the one from whom they heard the hadith, until mentioning the originator of the \"matn\" along with the \"matn\" itself.\nThe first people to hear hadith were the companions who preserved it and then conveyed it to those after them. Then the generation following them received it, thus conveying it to those after them and so on. So a companion would say, \"I heard the Prophet say such and such.\" The Follower would then say, \"I heard a companion say, 'I heard the Prophet.'\" The one after him would then say, \"I heard someone say, 'I heard a Companion say, 'I heard the Prophet\u00a0...\"\" and so on.\nAuthenticity of a hadith is primarily verified by its chain of transmission (\"isnad\") in classical Islam. Because a chain of transmission can be a forgery, the status of authenticity given by Muslim scholars are not generally accepted by Orientalists or historians, who largely consider hadith to be unverifiable. Ign\u00e1c Goldziher demonstrated that several hadiths do not fit the time of Muhammad chronologically and content-wise. As a result, Orientalists generally regard hadiths as having little value in understanding the life and times of the historical Muhammad but are instead valuable for understanding later theological developments in the Muslim community. According to Bernard Lewis, \"In the early Islamic centuries there could be no better way of promoting a cause, an opinion, or a faction than to cite an appropriate action or utterance of the Prophet.\" To fight these forgeries, the elaborate tradition of hadith sciences was devised to authenticate hadith known as \"ilm al jarh\" or \"ilm al dirayah\" Hadith science use a number of methods of evaluation developed by early Muslim scholars in determining the veracity of reports attributed to Muhammad. This is achieved by:\nBased on these criteria, various classifications of hadith have been developed. The earliest comprehensive work in hadith science was Abu Muhammad al-Ramahurmuzi's \"al-Muhaddith al-Fasil\", while another significant work was al-Hakim al-Naysaburi's \"Ma\u2018rifat \u2018ulum al-hadith\". Ibn al-Salah's \"\u02bbUlum al-hadith\" is considered the standard classical reference on hadith science. Some schools of Hadith methodology apply as many as sixteen separate tests.\nIn the Shia school of thought, there are two fundamental viewpoints of hadith: The Usuli view and the Akhbari view. The Usuli scholars emphasize the importance of scientific examination of hadiths through ijtihad while the Akhbari scholars consider all hadiths from the four Shia books as authentic\nBiographical evaluation.\nBiographical analysis (\"\u2018ilm al-rij\u0101l\", lit. \"science of people\", also \"science of \"Asma Al-Rijal\" or \"\u2018ilm al-jar\u1e25 wa al-ta\u02bbd\u012bl\"\" (\"science of discrediting and accrediting\"), in which details about the transmitter are scrutinized. This includes analyzing their date and place of birth; familial connections; teachers and students; religiosity; moral behaviour; literary output; their travels; as well as their date of death. Based upon these criteria, the reliability (\"thiq\u0101t\") of the transmitter is assessed. It is also determined whether the individual was actually able to transmit the report, which is deduced from their contemporaneity and geographical proximity with the other transmitters in the chain. Examples of biographical dictionaries include: Abd al-Ghani al-Maqdisi's \"Al-Kamal fi Asma' al-Rijal\", Ibn Hajar al-Asqalani's \"Tahdh\u012bb al-Tahdh\u012bb\" and al-Dhahabi's \"Tadhkirat al-huffaz\".\nScale of transmission.\nHadith on matters of importance needed to come through a number of independent chains, this was known as the scale of transmission. Reports that passed through many reliable transmitters in many \"isnad\" up until their collection and transcription are known as \"mutaw\u0101tir\". These reports are considered the most authoritative as they pass through so many different routes that collusion between all of the transmitters becomes an impossibility. Reports not meeting this standard are known as \"aahad\", and are of several different types.\nAnalyzing text.\nAccording to Muhammad Shafi, Hadith whose isnad has been scrutinized then have their text or \"matn\" examined for:\nTerminology: admissible and inadmissible hadiths.\nHaving been evaluated, hadith may be categorized. Two categories are: \nOther classifications include: \nBoth \"sah\u012bh\" and \"hasan\" reports are considered acceptable for usage in Islamic legal discourse.\nCriticism.\nThe major points of intra-Muslim criticism of the hadith literature is based in questions regarding its authenticity. However, Muslim criticism of hadith is also based on theological and philosophical Islamic grounds of argument and critique.\nHistorically, some sects of the Kharijites rejected the Hadith. There were some who opposed even the writing down of the Hadith itself for fear that it would compete, or even replace the Qur'an. Mu'tazilites also rejected the hadiths as the basis for Islamic law, while at the same time accepting the Sunnah and ijma. For Mu'tazilites, the basic argument for rejecting the hadiths was that \"since its essence is transmission by individuals, [it] cannot be a sure avenue of our knowledge about the Prophetic teaching unlike the Qur'an about whose transmission there is a universal unanimity among Muslims\".\nWith regard to clarity, Imam Ali al-Ridha has narrated that \"In our Hadith there are Mutashabih (unclear ones) like those in al-Quran as well as Muhkam (clear ones) like those of al-Quran. You must refer the unclear ones to the clear ones.\"\nMuslim scholars have a long history of questioning the hadith literature throughout Islamic history. Western academics also became active in the field later (in Hadith studies), starting in 1890, but much more often since 1950.\nSome Muslim critics of hadith even go so far as to completely reject them as the basic texts of Islam and instead adhere to the movement called Quranism. Quranists argue that the Quran itself does not contain an invitation to accept hadith as a second theological source alongside the Quran. The expression \"to obey God and the Messenger\", which occurs among others in 3:132 or 4:69, is understood to mean that one follows the Messenger whose task it was to convey the Quran by following the Quran alone. Muhammad is, so to speak, a mediator from God to people through the Quran alone and not through hadith, according to Quranists. Both modernist Muslims and Qur'anists believe that the problems in the Islamic world come partly from the traditional elements of the hadith and seek to reject those teachings.\nAmong the most prominent Muslim critics of hadith in modern times are the Egyptian Rashad Khalifa, who became known as the \"discoverer\" of the Quran code (Code 19), the Malaysian Kassim Ahmad and the American-Turkish Edip Y\u00fcksel (Quranism).\nWestern scholars, notably Ignaz Goldziher and Joseph Schacht among others, have criticised traditional hadith sciences as being almost entirely focused on scrutinizing the chain of transmittors (\"isnad\") rather than the actual contents of the hadith (\"matn\"), and that scrutiny of \"isnad\" cannot determine the authenticity of a hadith. Many Western scholars suspect that there was widespread fabrication of hadith (either entirely or by the misattribution of the views of early Muslim religious and legal thinkers to Muhammad) in the early centuries of Islam to support certain theological and legal positions. In addition to fabrication, it is possible for the meaning of a hadith to have greatly drifted from its original telling through the different interpretations and biases of its varying transmitters, even if the chain of transmission is authentic. While some hadith may genuinely originate from firsthand observation of Muhammad (particularly personal traits that were not of theological interest, like his fondness for tharid and sweets), Western scholars suggest that it is extraordinarily difficult if not impossible to determine which hadith accurately reflect the historical Muhammad. Hadith scholar Muhammad Mustafa Azmi has disputed the claims made by Western scholars about the reliability of traditional hadith criticism.\nReferences.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The hull may open at the top (such as a dinghy), or it may be fully or partially covered with a deck. Atop the deck may be a deckhouse and other superstructures, such as a funnel, derrick, or mast. The line where the hull meets the water surface is called the waterline.\nGeneral features.\nThere is a wide variety of hull types that are chosen for suitability for different usages, the hull shape being dependent upon the needs of the design. Shapes range from a nearly perfect box, in the case of scow barges, to a needle-sharp surface of revolution in the case of a racing multihull sailboat. The shape is chosen to strike a balance between cost, hydrostatic considerations (accommodation, load carrying, and stability), hydrodynamics (speed, power requirements, and motion and behavior in a seaway) and special considerations for the ship's role, such as the rounded bow of an icebreaker or the flat bottom of a landing craft.\nIn a typical modern steel ship, the hull will have watertight decks, and major transverse members called bulkheads. There may also be intermediate members such as girders, stringers and webs, and minor members called ordinary transverse frames, frames, or longitudinals, depending on the structural arrangement. The uppermost continuous deck may be called the \"upper deck\", \"weather deck\", \"spar deck\", \"main deck\", or simply \"deck\". The particular name given depends on the context\u2014the type of ship or boat, the arrangement, or even where it sails.\nIn a typical wooden sailboat, the hull is constructed of wooden planking, supported by transverse frames (often referred to as ribs) and bulkheads, which are further tied together by longitudinal stringers or ceiling. Often but not always there is a centerline longitudinal member called a keel. In fiberglass or composite hulls, the structure may resemble wooden or steel vessels to some extent, or be of a monocoque arrangement. In many cases, composite hulls are built by sandwiching thin fiber-reinforced skins over a lightweight but reasonably rigid core of foam, balsa wood, impregnated paper honeycomb, or other material.\nPerhaps the earliest proper hulls were built by the Ancient Egyptians, who by 3000 BC knew how to assemble wooden planks into a hull.\nHull shapes.\nHulls come in many varieties and can have composite shape, (e.g., a fine entry forward and inverted bell shape aft), but are grouped primarily as follows:\nHull forms.\nAt present, the most widely used form is the round bilge hull.\nWith a small payload, such a craft has less of its hull below the waterline, giving less resistance and more speed. With a greater payload, resistance is greater and speed lower, but the hull's outward bend provides smoother performance in waves. As such, the inverted bell shape is a popular form used with planing hulls.\nChined and hard-chined hulls.\nA chined hull does not have a smooth rounded transition between bottom and sides. Instead, its contours are interrupted by sharp angles where predominantly longitudinal panels of the hull meet. The sharper the intersection (the more acute the angle), the \"harder\" the chine. More than one chine per side is possible.\nThe Cajun \"pirogue\" is an example of a craft with hard chines.\nBenefits of this type of hull include potentially lower production cost and a (usually) fairly flat bottom, making the boat faster at planing. A hard chined hull resists rolling (in smooth water) more than does a hull with rounded bilges (the chine creates turbulence and drag resisting the rolling motion, as it moves through the water, the rounded-bilge provides less flow resistance around the turn). In rough seas, this can make the boat roll more, as the motion drags first down, then up, on a chine: round-bilge boats are more seakindly in waves, as a result.\nChined hulls may have one of three shapes:\nEach of these chine hulls has its own unique characteristics and use. The flat-bottom hull has high initial stability but high drag. To counter the high drag, hull forms are narrow and sometimes severely tapered at bow and stern. This leads to poor stability when heeled in a sailboat. This is often countered by using heavy interior ballast on sailing versions. They are best suited to sheltered inshore waters. Early racing power boats were fine forward and flat aft. This produced maximum lift and a smooth, fast ride in flat water, but this hull form is easily unsettled in waves. The multi-chine hull approximates a curved hull form. It has less drag than a flat-bottom boat. Multi chines are more complex to build but produce a more seaworthy hull form. They are usually displacement hulls. V or arc-bottom chine boats have a Vshape between 6\u00b0and 23\u00b0. This is called the angle. The flatter shape of a 6-degree hull will plane with less wind or a lower-horsepower engine but will pound more in waves. The deep Vform (between 18and 23degrees) is only suited to high-powered planing boats. They require more powerful engines to lift the boat onto the plane but give a faster, smoother ride in waves. Displacement chined hulls have more wetted surface area, hence more drag, than an equivalent round-hull form, for any given displacement.\nSmooth curve hulls.\nSmooth curve hulls are hulls that use, just like the curved hulls, a centreboard, or an attached keel.\nSemi round bilge hulls are somewhat less round. The advantage of the semi-round is that it is a nice middle between the S-bottom and chined hull. Typical examples of a semi-round bilge hull can be found in the Centaur and Laser sailing dinghies.\nS-bottom hulls are sailing boat hulls with a midships transverse half-section shaped like an \"s\". In the s-bottom, the hull has round bilges and merges smoothly with the keel, and there are no sharp corners on the hull sides between the keel centreline and the sheer line. Boats with this hull form may have a long fixed deep keel, or a long shallow fixed keel with a centreboard swing keel inside. Ballast may be internal, external, or a combination. This hull form was most popular in the late 19th and early to mid 20th centuries. Examples of small sailboats that use this s-shape are the Yngling and Randmeer.\nMetrics.\nHull forms are defined as follows:\nBlock measures that define the principal dimensions. They are:\nForm derivatives that are calculated from the shape and the block measures. They are:\nCoefficients help compare hull forms as well:\nNote: formula_5\nComputer-aided design.\nUse of computer-aided design has superseded paper-based methods of ship design that relied on manual calculations and lines drawing. Since the early 1990s, a variety of commercial and freeware software packages specialized for naval architecture have been developed that provide 3D drafting capabilities combined with calculation modules for hydrostatics and hydrodynamics. These may be referred to as geometric modeling systems for naval architecture.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The word \"hymn\" derives from Greek (\"hymnos\"), which means \"a song of praise\". A writer of hymns is known as a hymnist. The singing or composition of hymns is called hymnody. Collections of hymns are known as hymnals or hymn books. Hymns may or may not include instrumental accompaniment. Polyhymnia is the Greco/Roman goddess of hymns.\nAlthough most familiar to speakers of English in the context of Christianity, hymns are also a fixture of other world religions, especially on the Indian subcontinent (\"stotras\"). Hymns also survive from antiquity, especially from Egyptian and Greek cultures. Some of the oldest surviving examples of notated music are hymns with Greek texts.\nOrigins.\nAncient Eastern hymns include the Sumerian Kesh temple hymn (oldest surviving literary text in the world); Egyptian \"Great Hymn to the Aten\", composed by Pharaoh Akhenaten; the Hurrian \"Hymn to Nikkal\"; the \"Rigveda\", an Indian collection of Vedic hymns; hymns from the \"Classic of Poetry\" (\"Shijing\"), a collection of Chinese poems from 11th to 7th centuries BC; the \"Gathas\"\u2014Avestan hymns believed to have been composed by Zoroaster; and the Biblical \"Book of Psalms\".\nThe Western tradition of hymnody begins with the \"Homeric Hymns\", a collection of ancient Greek hymns, the oldest of which were written in the 7th century BC, praising deities of the ancient Greek religions. Surviving from the 3rd century BC is a collection of six literary hymns () by the Alexandrian poet Callimachus. The \"Orphic Hymns\" are a collection of 87 short poems in Greek religion.\nPatristic writers began applying the term , or \"hymnus\" in Latin, to Christian songs of praise, and frequently used the word as a synonym for \"psalm\".\nChristian hymnody.\nOriginally modelled on (but distinct from) the Book of Psalms and other poetic passages (commonly referred to as \"canticles\") in the Scriptures, Christian hymns are generally directed as praise to the Christian God. Many refer to Jesus Christ either directly or indirectly.\nOrigins.\nIn the New Testament, Saint Paul wrote to the Ephesian and Colossian churches, enjoining the singing of psalms and hymns for \"mutual encouragement and edification\". This was demonstrated when he joined Silas in singing hymns in the Phillipian jail,\neven during unfortunate circumstances. and ,\namong other Scriptural verses, encourage Christians to sing hymns to praise God. As such, since the earliest times, Christians have sung \"psalms and hymns and spiritual songs\", both in private devotions and in corporate worship. Non-scriptural hymns (i.e. not psalms or canticles) from the Early Church still sung today include 'Phos Hilaron', 'Sub tuum praesidium', and 'Te Deum'.\nTraditions.\nThe hymn 'Te Deum' is sung or recited in the Liturgy of the Hours and in thanksgiving to God for a special blessing (such as the election of a pope, the consecration of a bishop, the canonization of a saint), and on December 31st to thank the Lord for the past year. \nThe hymn \"\" is sung or recited at Mass, after the Kyrie, on Sundays outside of Lent and Advent, on Christmas, during the octaves of Easter and Christmas, and on solemnities and feasts.\nDefinition.\nOne definition of a hymn is \"...a lyric poem, reverently and devotionally conceived, which is designed to be sung and which expresses the worshipper's attitude toward God or God's purposes in human life. It should be simple and metrical in form, genuinely emotional, poetic and literary in style, spiritual in quality, and in its ideas so direct and so immediately apparent as to unify a congregation while singing it.\"\nSpecial occasions.\nChristian hymns are often written with special or seasonal themes; such hymns are used on holy days such as Christmas, Easter and the Feast of All Saints, or during particular seasons such as Advent and Lent. Others are used to encourage reverence for the Bible or to celebrate Christian practices such as the Eucharist or Baptism. Some hymns praise or address individual saints, particularly Mary, mother of Jesus; such hymns are particularly prevalent in Catholicism, Eastern Orthodoxy, Evangelical Lutheranism, and to some extent in High Church Anglicanism.\nTerminology.\nA writer of hymns is known as a hymnodist, and the practice of singing hymns is called \"hymnody\"; the same word is used collectively for those hymns associated with a particular denomination or period (e.g. \"nineteenth-century Methodist hymnody\" would mean the body of hymns written and/or used by Methodists in the 19th century). A specific collection of hymns is called a \"hymnal, hymn book\" or \"hymnary\". These may or may not include music; among the hymnals without printed music, some include names of hymn tunes suggested for use with each text, in case readers already know the tunes or would like to find them elsewhere. A student of hymnody is called a \"hymnologist\", and the scholarly study of hymns, hymnists and hymnody is hymnology. The music to which a hymn may be sung is a hymn tune.\nNondenominational evangelical churches may classify traditional songs as hymns while more contemporary worship songs are not considered hymns. The reason for this distinction is unclear, but according to some it is due to the radical shift of style and devotional thinking that began in the late 1960s with the Jesus movement and Jesus music. In recent years, Christian traditional hymns \"have\" seen a revival in some churches, usually more Reformed or Calvinistic in nature, as modern hymn-writers such as Keith &amp; Kristyn Getty and Sovereign Grace Music have reset old lyrics to new melodies, revised old hymns and republished them, or simply written a song in a hymn-like fashion such as \"In Christ Alone\".\nRevival.\nThe Oxyrhynchus hymn, regarded as the oldest known Christian hymn with both lyrics and musical notation, was revived in 2025 as part of a modern reinterpretation. The ancient hymn from the third century was re-recorded as a contemporary worship song by composers Chris Tomlin and Ben Fielding for the feature-length documentary \"The First Hymn\", which traces the historical and theological journey of early Christian worship. The documentary was created by Australian historian and author John Dickson, and the new recording was released globally on April 11, 2025.\nMusic and accompaniment.\nIn ancient and medieval times, string instruments such as the harp, lyre and lute were used with psalms and hymns.\nSince there is a lack of musical notation in early writings, the actual musical forms in the early church can only be surmised. During the Middle Ages a rich hymnody developed in the form of Gregorian chant or plainsong. This type was sung in unison, in one of eight church modes, and most often by monastic choirs. While they were written originally in Latin, many have been translated; a familiar example is the 4th century \"Of the Father's Heart Begotten\" sung to the 11th-[century plainsong \"Divinum Mysterium\".\nWestern church.\nLater hymnody in the Western church introduced four-part vocal harmony as the norm, adopting major and minor keys. The organ and choir came to lead the singing. Western hymnody shares many elements with classical music.\nToday, except for choirs, more musically inclined congregations, and \"a cappella\" congregations, hymns are typically sung in unison. In some cases, complementary full settings for organ are also published; in others, organists and other accompanists are expected to adapt the available setting, or extemporise one, on their instrument of choice.\nIn traditional Evangelical Lutheran and Anglican practice, hymns are sung (often accompanied by an organ) during the processional to the altar, during the receiving of communion, during the recessional, and sometimes at other points during the service. The Doxology is also sung after tithes and offerings are brought up to the altar.\nContemporary Christian worship, as commonly found in certain forms of Evangelicalism and Pentecostalism, may include the use of contemporary worship music played with electric guitars and drum kits, sharing many elements with rock music.\nOther groups of Christians have historically excluded instrumental accompaniment, citing the absence of instruments in worship by the church in the first several centuries of its existence, and adhere to an unaccompanied \"a cappella\" congregational singing of hymns. These groups include the Brethren (often both Open and Exclusive), the Churches of Christ, Mennonites, several Anabaptist-based denominations\u2014such as the Apostolic Christian Church of America\u2014Primitive Baptists, and certain Reformed churches. However, during the last century or so, several of these groups, such as the Free Church of Scotland, have abandoned this stance.\nEastern church.\nEastern Christianity (the Eastern Orthodox, Oriental Orthodox, Eastern Lutheran and Eastern Catholic churches) has a variety of ancient hymnographical traditions. In the Byzantine Rite, chant is used for all forms of liturgical worship: if it is not sung a cappella, the only accompaniment is usually an , or drone. Organs and other instruments were excluded from church use, although they were employed in imperial ceremonies. However, instruments are common in some other Oriental traditions. The Coptic tradition makes use of the cymbals and the triangle only. The Indian Orthodox (Malankara Orthodox Syrian Church) use the organ. The Tewahedo Churches use drums, cymbals and other instruments on certain occasions.\nDevelopment of Christian hymnody.\nThomas Aquinas, in the introduction to his commentary on the Psalms, defined the Christian hymn thus: \".\" (\"A hymn is the praise of God with song; a song is the exultation of the mind dwelling on eternal things, bursting forth in the voice.\")\nThe Protestant Reformation resulted in two conflicting attitudes towards hymns. One approach, the regulative principle of worship, favoured by many Zwinglians, Calvinists and some radical reformers, regarded anything that was not directly authorised by the Bible as a novel and Catholic introduction to worship, which was to be rejected. All hymns that were not direct quotations from the Bible fell into this category. Such hymns were banned, along with any form of instrumental musical accompaniment, and organs were removed from Reformed churches. Instead of hymns, biblical psalms were chanted, most often without accompaniment, to very basic melodies. This was known as exclusive psalmody. Examples of this may still be found in various places, including in some of the Presbyterian churches of western Scotland.\nThe other Reformation approach, the normative principle of worship, produced a burst of hymn-writing and congregational singing. Martin Luther is notable not only as a reformer, but as the author of hymns including (\"A Mighty Fortress Is Our God\"), (\"Praise be to You, Jesus Christ\"), and many others. Luther and his followers often used their hymns, or chorales, to teach tenets of the faith to worshipers. The first Protestant hymnal was published in Bohemia in 1532 by the Unitas Fratrum.\nCount Zinzendorf, a Lutheran bishop of the Moravian Church in the 18th century, wrote some 2,000 hymns.\nSome of the works of the Anglican \"metaphysical poet\" the Reverend George Herbert (1593-1633) have found their way into hymnals.\nThe earlier English writers tended to paraphrase biblical texts, particularly Psalms; Isaac Watts (1674\u20131748) followed this tradition, but is also credited as having written the first English hymn which was not a direct paraphrase of Scripture. Watts, whose father was an Elder of a dissenter congregation, complained at age 16, that when allowed only psalms to sing, the faithful could not even sing about their Lord, Christ Jesus. His father invited him to see what he could do about it; the result was Watts' first hymn, \"Behold the glories of the Lamb\".\nFound in few hymnals today, the hymn has eight stanzas in common metre and is based on Revelation 5:6, 8, 9, 10, 12.\nRelying heavily on Scripture, Watts wrote metered texts based on New Testament passages that brought the Christian faith into the songs of the church. Isaac Watts has been called \"the father of English hymnody\", but Erik Routley sees him more as \"the liberator of English hymnody\", because his hymns, and hymns like them, moved worshippers beyond singing only Old Testament psalms, inspiring congregations and revitalizing worship.\nLater writers took even more freedom, with some even including allegory and metaphor in their texts.\nCharles Wesley's hymns spread Methodist theology, not only within Methodism, but in most Protestant churches. He developed a new focus: expressing one's personal feelings in the relationship with God as well as the simple worship seen in older hymns. \nWesley's contribution, along with the Second Great Awakening in America, led to a new style called \"gospel\", and a new explosion of sacred-music writing with Fanny Crosby, Lina Sandell, Philip Bliss, Ira D. Sankey, and others who produced testimonial music for revivals, camp-meetings, and evangelistic crusades. The tune style or form is technically designated \"gospel songs\" as distinct from hymns. Gospel songs generally include a refrain (or chorus) and usually (though not always) a faster tempo than with hymns. As examples of the distinction, \"Amazing Grace\" is a hymn (no refrain), but \"How Great Thou Art\" is a gospel song. During the 19th century, the gospel-song genre spread rapidly in Protestantism and \u2014 to a lesser but still definite extent \u2014 in Roman Catholicism; the gospel-song genre is unknown in the worship \"per se\" by Eastern Orthodox churches, which rely exclusively on traditional chants (a type of hymn).\nThe Methodist Revival of the 18th century created an explosion of hymn-writing in Welsh, which continued into the first half of the 19th century. The most prominent Welsh hymn-writers are William Williams Pantycelyn and Ann Griffiths. The second half of the 19th century witnessed an explosion of hymn-tune composition and congregational four-part singing in Wales.\nAlong with the more classical sacred music of composers ranging from Charpentier (19 \"Hymns,\" H.53 - H.71) to Mozart and Monteverdi, the Catholic Church continued to produce many popular hymns such as \"Lead, Kindly Light\", \"Silent Night\", \"O Sacrament Most Holy\", and \"Faith of Our Fathers\".\nIn some radical Protestant movements, their own sacred hymns completely replaced the written Bible. An example of this, the \"Book of Life\" (Russian: \"Zhivotnaya kniga\") is the name of all oral hymns of the Doukhobors, the Russian denomination, similar to western Quakers. \"The Book of Life of the Doukhobors\" (1909) is firstly printed hymnal containing songs which have been composed as an oral piece to be sung aloud.\nMany churches today use contemporary-worship music which includes a range of styles often influenced by popular music. This often leads to some conflict between older and younger congregants (see contemporary worship). This is not new; the Christian pop-music style began in the late 1960s and became very popular during the 1970s, as young hymnists sought ways in which to make the music of their religion relevant for their generation.\nThis long tradition has resulted in a wide variety of hymns. Some modern churches include within hymnody the traditional hymn (usually describing God), contemporary-worship music (often directed to God) and gospel music (expressions of one's personal experience of God). This distinction is not perfectly clear; and purists remove the second two types from classification as hymns. It is a matter of debate, even sometimes within a single congregation, often between revivalist and traditionalist movements.\nSwedish composer and musicologist Elisabet Wentz-Janacek mapped 20,000 melody variants for Swedish hymns and helped create the Swedish Choral Registrar, which displays the wide variety of hymns today.\nIn modern times, hymn use has not been limited to strictly religious settings, including secular occasions such as Remembrance Day, and this \"secularization\" also includes use as sources of musical entertainment or even vehicles for mass emotion.\nAmerican developments.\nHymn-writing, composition, performance and the publishing of Christian hymnals throve in the 19th-century and many hymn-writers often linked this activity to the abolitionist movement. Stephen Foster wrote a number of hymns that were used during church services during this era of publishing.\nThomas Symmes, a clergyman of the third generation of Puritans in New England, spread throughout churches a new idea of how to sing hymns, in which anyone could sing a hymn any way they felt led to; this idea was opposed by a writer of the time, Rev. Thomas Walter, who felt it was \"like Five Hundred different Tunes roared out at the same time\". William Billings, a singing-school teacher, created the first tune-book with only American-born compositions. Within his books, Billings did not put as much emphasis on \"common measure\" - a quatrain that rhymes ABAB and alternates four-stress and three-stress iambic lines - which was the typical way hymns were sung. Noting in his preface the fondness of other compilers for tunes in common measure, Billings promised his subscribers a well-balanced collection, with \"a Sufficiency in each measure\". And indeed \"The Singing Master's Assistant\" has many tunes whose declamation is based on the dactyl in duple time. Boston's Handel and Haydn Society aimed at raising the level of church music in America, publishing their \"Collection of Church Music\" in 1822. In the late-19th century Ira D. Sankey and Dwight L. Moody developed the relatively new subcategory of gospel hymns.\nEarlier in the 19th century, the use of musical notation, especially shape notes, exploded in America, and professional singing-masters went from town to town teaching the population how to sing from sight, instead of the more common lining out that had been used before that. During this period hundreds of tune-books were published, including B.F. White's \"Sacred Harp\", and earlier works like the \"Missouri Harmony\", \"Kentucky Harmony\", \"Hesperian Harp\", D.H. Mansfield's \"The American Vocalist\", \"The Social Harp\", the \"Southern Harmony\", William Walker's \"Christian Harmony\", Jeremiah Ingalls' \"Christian Harmony\", and literally many dozens of others. Shape-notes were important in the spread of (then) more-modern singing-styles, with tenor-led 4-part harmony (based on older English West Gallery music), fuging sections, anthems and other more complex features. During this period, hymns were incredibly popular in the United States, and one or more of the above-mentioned tune-books could be found in almost every household. It is not uncommon to hear accounts of young people and teenagers gathering together to spend an afternoon singing hymns and anthems from tune-books, which was considered great fun, and accountst survive of Abraham Lincoln and his sweetheart singing together from the \"Missouri Harmony\" during his youth.\nBy the 1860s musical reformers like Lowell Mason (the so-called \"better music boys\") were actively campaigning for the introduction of more \"refined\" and modern singing-styles, and eventually American tune-books were replaced in many churches, starting in the Northeast and urban areas, and spreading out into the countryside as people adopted the gentler, more soothing tones of Victorian hymnody, and even adopted dedicated, trained choirs to do their church's singing, rather than having the entire congregation participate. But in many rural areas the old traditions lived on, not in churches, but in weekly, monthly or annual conventions were people would meet to sing from their favorite tune-books. The most popular one, and the only one that survived continuously in print, was the \"Sacred Harp\", which could be found in the typical rural Southern home right up until the living tradition was \"re-discovered\" by Alan Lomax in the 1960s (although it had been well-documented by musicologist George Pullen Jackson prior to this). Since then there has been a renaissance in \"Sacred Harp singing\", with annual conventions popping up in all 50 states and in a number of European countries recently, including the UK, Germany, Ireland and Poland, as well as in Australia.\nBlack America's hymns.\nAfrican-Americans developed a rich hymnody \u2014 from spirituals during times of slavery to the modern, lively black-gospel style. The first influences of African-American culture into hymns came from the collection \"Slave Songs of the United States\", compiled by William Francis Allen, despite difficulties pinning them down from the oral tradition. He points out the awe-inspiring effect of the hymns when sung by their originators. Some of the first hymns in the black church were renderings of Isaac Watts hymns written in the African-American vernacular English of the time.\nHymn meters.\nThe meter indicates the number of syllables for the lines in each stanza of a hymn. This provides a means of marrying the hymn's text with an appropriate hymn tune for singing. In practice many hymns conform to one of a relatively small number of meters (syllable-count and stress-patterns). Care must be taken, however, to ensure that not only the metre of words and tune match, but also the stresses on the words in each line. Technically speaking, an iambic tune, for instance, cannot be used with words of, say, trochaic metre.\nThe meter is often denoted by a row of figures besides the name of the tune, such as \"87.87.87\", which would inform the reader that each verse has six lines, and that the first line has eight syllables, the second has seven, the third line eight, etc. The meter can also be described by initials; \"L.M.\" indicates long meter, which is 88.88 (four lines, each eight syllables long); \"S.M.\" is short meter (66.86); \"C.M.\" is common metre (86.86), while \"D.L.M.\", \"D.S.M.\" and \"D.C.M.\" (the \"D\" stands for \"double\") are similar to their respective single meters except that they have eight lines in a verse instead of four.\nAlso, if the number of syllables in one verse differ from another verse in the same hymn (e.g., the hymn \"I Sing a Song of the Saints of God\"), the meter is called \"Irregular\".\nHindu hymnody.\n\"The Rigveda\" is the earliest and foundational Indian collection of over a thousand liturgical hymns in Vedic Sanskrit.\nBetween other notable Hindu hymns (\"stotras\" and others) or their collections there are:\nA hymnody acquired tremendous importance during the medieval era of the bhakti movements. When the chanting (bhajan and kirtan) of the devotional songs of the poet-sants (Basava, Chandidas, Dadu Dayal, Haridas, Hith Harivansh, Kabir, Meera Bai, Namdev, Nanak, Ramprasad Sen, Ravidas, Sankardev, Surdas, Vidyapati) in local languages in a number of groups, namely Dadu panth, Kabir panth, Lingayatism, Radha-vallabha, Sikhism, completely or significantly replaced all previous Sanskrit literature. The same and with the songs of Baul movement. That is, the new hymns themselves received the status of holy scripture. An example of a hymnist, both lyricist and composer is the 15th\u201316th centuries Assamese reformer guru Sankardev with his \"borgeet\"-songs.\nSikh hymnody.\nThe Sikh holy book, the Guru Granth Sahib ( ), is a collection of hymns (Shabad) or \"Gurbani\" describing the qualities of God and why one should meditate on God's name. The \"Guru Granth Sahib\" is divided by their musical setting in different ragas into fourteen hundred and thirty pages known as \"Angs\" (limbs) in Sikh tradition. Guru Gobind Singh (1666\u20131708), the tenth guru, after adding Guru Tegh Bahadur's bani to the Adi Granth affirmed the sacred text as his successor, elevating it to \"Guru Granth Sahib\". The text remains the holy scripture of the Sikhs, regarded as the teachings of the Ten Gurus. The role of Guru Granth Sahib, as a source or guide of prayer, is pivotal in Sikh worship.\nIn other religions.\nBuddhism.\nSutra chanting is a religious action recommended for Shin Buddhist followers to carry out in their daily lives. Temple service chanting may include: dedications to the Three Treasures (Buddha, Dharma, Sangha) common to all Buddhist traditions; selections from \"The Three Pure Land Sutras\", which record the teachings of the Buddha; compositions of Pure Land Buddhist teachers such as Nagarjuna and Shandao.\nStotras are Sanskrit hymns or eulogies sung in praise of the divine and the transcendent. Usually associated with the Hindu and Jain traditions, stotras are melodic expressions of devotion and inspiration found in other Sanskrit religious movements as well.\nIn the Buddhist world, the practice of singing these hymns is still alive today in Nepal. Min Bahadur Shakya, former director of the Nagarjuna Institute of Exact Methods in Lalitpur, Nepal, writes:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;In prosperity or distress, the Nepalese people worship and pray to the Buddhas and Bodhisattvas for protection, good health, prosperity, and family welfare and also for liberation from cyclic existence. The stotras or hymns throw light on various aspects of Buddhist doctrines. The stotras are sung by sadhakas during their meditation or act of devotion. The contents of these strotras are of varied nature ranging from simple act of confession, qualities of Buddhas and Bodhisattvas, praises of deities of both mundane and supra-mundane [nature], iconographic data of various tantric deities and also explanation of Buddha\u2019s teachings themselves in the form of verses. These stotras can be sung with melodious music and can imprint the devotees significantly even in this modern world through the multimedia device.\u2014\u200a\nConfucianism.\nThe earliest entries in the oldest extant collection of Chinese poetry, the \"Classic of Poetry\" (\"Shijing\"), were initially lyrics. The \"Shijing\", with its collection of poems and folk songs, was heavily valued by the philosopher Confucius and is considered to be one of the official Confucian classics. His remarks on the subject have become an invaluable source in ancient music theory.\nIslam.\nDuring the time of the Prophet Mohammed, Islamic music was originally defined by what it didn't contain: no strings, brass, or wind instruments and no female vocals. The only instrument initially allowed was minimal percussion by an Arabic drum called the \"daf\". This minimal form remains widely practiced in the Gulf and some other parts of the Arab world.\nHowever, in places such as Turkey and Southeast Asia, several new styles of spiritual songs have developed. In Turkey, Sufi adherents incorporate music into worship. The most popular are services undertaken by Mevlevi Sufis, which include chanting and the whirling dervishes.\nIn Pakistan and Southeast Asia, the most recognized form of devotional music is \"qawwali\". Performed by up to nine men, a \"qawwali\" group would often use instruments such as the harmonium (a type of keyboard) and percussion instruments including a tabla and dholak. The songs often run from 15 to 30 minutes and include instrumental preludes, repeated refrains and vocal improvisation. In recent times, nasheed artists from the Gulf have found innovative ways to overcome the no-instrument rule.\nAlbums by Sharjah's Ahmed Bukhatir and Kuwait's Mishary Rashid Al Afasy use studio trickery and manipulate backing vocals to sound like a synth piano or string section. In the West, groups such as America's Native Deen and Australia's The Brothahood use hip-hop music to get their spiritual message across to a new generation of young Muslims. The nasheeds in English by South Africa's Zain Bhikha secured him a large following in Europe and the Middle East.\nJainism.\nKnown as \"stavan\" or, in Hindi, \"bhajan\", Jain hymns are composed and performed to praise the Jinas. Written in every language Jains have used, the predominant pada form reflects Jain involvement in Indian poetics and in the \"bhakti\" devotional movement more commonly associated with Hinduism.\nMusically, Jain hymns can be grouped into the folk genres of devotional music in western India, such as Gujar\u0101ti r\u0101s-garb\u0101 and R\u0101jasth\u0101ni folk music.\nThere are six obligatory acts that are expected to be performed by Jains sequentially as a single act twice daily. The second one of these is showing reverence to the ford-makers, which is done by reciting a twenty-four-verse hymn of praise to the Tirthankaras.\nOne of the most popular devotional hymns of the Jains is the \"Bhakt\u0101mara-stotra\" \u2013 \"Devoted Gods\" hymn. Both main sects of \u015avet\u0101mbaras and Digambaras accept it, counting 44 and 48 stanzas respectively. It is dedicated to the first Jina, \u1e5a\u1e63abhan\u0101tha or Lord \u1e5a\u1e63abha, frequently known as \u0100din\u0101tha, meaning \u2018First Lord\u2019. The title comes from the first verse, which says that \u2018his feet enhance the lustre of the jewels set in the crowns lowered by the devoted gods\u2019.\nJudaism.\nThe Hebrew word \"Zemirot\" means literally 'songs' or 'hymns' but is used to refer to two specific repertories: The first, according to the Sephardic tradition, refers to the preliminary section of psalms and biblical verses recited during the \"Shacharit\" (morning) prayers: the Ashkenazic terminology refers to these Psalms as \"Psukeydezimra\". The second repertory is well defined in Neil Levin's Overview of his \"Z'mirot Anthology.\"\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;In Ashkenazic tradition the term refers to \"z'mirot shel Shabbat\" (Sabbath hymns) translated variously as table songs, domestic songs and home songs. These are a specific set of religious poems in Hebrew or Aramaic written mostly between the 10th and 17th centuries, which are sung during and directly after Sabbath meals. The musical versions are numerous and heterogeneous reflecting a wealth of different styles and geographic origins, and comprising an ever expanding body of folk material.\u2014\u200a\nOver many centuries the Jews of Spain and Portugal\u2013the original Sephardim\u2013 developed their own form of religious worship. Their services were enhanced by the addition of poetry for special occasions such as the major festivals (\"Shalosh r\u2019galim\") and the \"Yamim nora\u2019im\" (High Holidays). Most of these poetic insertions are rhymed, metrical hymns (\"piyyutim\") and were the products of great literary figures during the Golden Age of the Jews in Spain (c. 950\u20131150). Among these were Solomon ibn Gabriol, Judah Halevi and the two Ibn Ezras\u2014Abraham and Moshe.\nOne of the main features of devotional music and hymns in Judaism, especially when utilized in synagogue ritual on the Sabbath and other holy days, is that it is almost entirely vocal. Though today, accompanying instruments such as the organ might be utilized in worship, the emphasis on congregational song and the art of the Hazzan has always been, and still is, paramount.\nThe one salient exception to this is an instrument called the Shofar, a ram's horn which is sounded on the High Holidays (the Jewish New Year and Day of Atonement - Rosh Hashana and Yom Kippur, respectively), as a special call to prayer and repentance.\nShinto.\nAccording to Japanese mythology, Shinto music stems from the time of the gods when there was no earth and sea. In Shintoism, sacral music is called \"Mi-kagura\". The word \"kagura\" means \"the gods' delight\". The prefix \"Mi\" raises the value of the subject intensely. It should be translated \"the sublime greatest of great gods\". In praxis there are two kinds of \"kagura\", \"Mi-kagura\" and rural \"kagura\". \"Mi-kagura\" is strictly reserved and dedicated to the Imperial house and the highest nobility and clergy; rural \"kagura\" is a most colourful and vivid presentation of the popular feats of supramortal and mortal heroes.\nZoroastrianism.\nThe sacred songs attributed to Zoroaster (Zarathustra), the poet-priest and founder of Zoroastrianism, are called Gathas. The Gathas, consist of seventeen hymns composed by the great poet-prophet Zarathushtra around 1200 BC. They are arranged into five groups based on their meter:\nThe Gathas are also filled with word plays and deliberate ambiguities, and they were likely intended to be used by initiates as meditative instruments to enlightenment. Only occasionally do the Gathas give an exact and clear picture of Zoroaster's actual teachings, but in general they reflect them in a modified and elaborated form, many times marked by complexity and ornateness of style, the prophet demonstrating his poetical skill in order to stimulate Ahura Mazd\u0101 to fulfil his requests or to answer his questions.\nAppreciations.\nAccording to Nissim Ezekiel, views on hymns can be divided:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;...poets who have mystical experiences and project them in verse have occasionally been successful but mystics who write poetry do it badly. Religious hymns, however notable the religious sentiment they express are not notably poetic. Great religious poetry undoubtedly exists but the greatness is unequally divided between the poetry and religion, while perfect integration between the two is rare.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nExternal links.\nThe links below are restricted to either material that is historical or resources that are non-denominational or inter-denominational.

These topics were discussed across many cultures in ancient times by philosophers, but they had no means to distinguish causes of natural phenomena from superstitions.\nThe Scientific Revolution of the 17th century, especially the discovery of the law of gravity, began a process of knowledge accumulation and specialization that gave rise to the field of physics.\nMathematical advances of the 18th century gave rise to classical mechanics, and the increased used of the experimental method led to new understanding of thermodynamics.\nIn the 19th century, the basic laws of electromagnetism and statistical mechanics were discovered.\nAt the beginning of the 20th century, physics was transformed by the discoveries of quantum mechanics, relativity, and atomic theory.\nPhysics today may be divided loosely into classical physics and modern physics.\nAncient history.\nElements of what became physics were drawn primarily from the fields of astronomy, optics, and mechanics, which were methodologically united through the study of geometry. These mathematical disciplines began in antiquity with the Babylonians and with Hellenistic writers such as Archimedes and Ptolemy. Ancient philosophy, meanwhile, included what was called \"Physics\".\nGreek concept.\nThe move towards a rational understanding of nature began at least since the Archaic period in Greece (650\u2013480 BCE) with the Pre-Socratic philosophers. The philosopher Thales of Miletus (7th and 6th centuries BCE), dubbed \"the Father of Science\" for refusing to accept various supernatural, religious or mythological explanations for natural phenomena, proclaimed that every event had a natural cause. Thales also made advancements in 580 BCE by suggesting that water is the basic element, experimenting with the attraction between magnets and rubbed amber and formulating the first recorded cosmologies. Anaximander, developer of a proto-evolutionary theory, disputed Thales' ideas and proposed that rather than water, a substance called \"apeiron\" was the building block of all matter. Around 500\u00a0BCE, Heraclitus proposed that the only basic law governing the Universe was the principle of change and that nothing remains in the same state indefinitely. He, along with his contemporary Parmenides were among the first scholars to contemplate on the role of time in the universe, a key concept that is still an issue in modern physics.\nDuring the classical period in Greece (6th, 5th and 4th centuries BCE) and in Hellenistic times, natural philosophy developed into a field of study. Aristotle (, \"Aristot\u00e9l\u0113s\") (384\u2013322 BCE), a student of Plato, promoted the concept that observation of physical phenomena could ultimately lead to the discovery of the natural laws governing them. Aristotle's writings cover physics, metaphysics, poetry, theater, music, logic, rhetoric, linguistics, politics, government, ethics, biology and zoology. He wrote the first work which refers to that line of study as \"Physics\"\u00a0\u2013 in the 4th century BCE, Aristotle founded the system known as Aristotelian physics. He attempted to explain ideas such as motion (and gravity) with the theory of four elements. Aristotle believed that all matter was made of aether, or some combination of four elements: earth, water, air, and fire. According to Aristotle, these four terrestrial elements are capable of inter-transformation and move toward their natural place, so a stone falls downward toward the center of the cosmos, but flames rise upward toward the circumference. Eventually, Aristotelian physics became popular for many centuries in Europe, informing the scientific and scholastic developments of the Middle Ages. It remained the mainstream scientific paradigm in Europe until the time of Galileo Galilei and Isaac Newton.\nEarly in Classical Greece, knowledge that the Earth is spherical (\"round\") was common. Around 240\u00a0BCE, as the result of a seminal experiment, Eratosthenes (276\u2013194 BCE) accurately estimated its circumference. In contrast to Aristotle's geocentric views, Aristarchus of Samos (; c.\u2009310\u00a0\u2013 c.\u2009230 BCE) presented an explicit argument for a heliocentric model of the Solar System, i.e. for placing the Sun, not the Earth, at its centre. Seleucus of Seleucia, a follower of Aristarchus' heliocentric theory, stated that the Earth rotated around its own axis, which, in turn, revolved around the Sun. Though the arguments he used were lost, Plutarch stated that Seleucus was the first to prove the heliocentric system through reasoning.\nIn the 3rd century BCE, the Greek mathematician Archimedes of Syracuse (287\u2013212 BCE)\u00a0\u2013 generally considered to be the greatest mathematician of antiquity and one of the greatest of all time\u00a0\u2013 laid the foundations of hydrostatics, statics and calculated the underlying mathematics of the lever. A scientist of classical antiquity, Archimedes also developed elaborate systems of pulleys to move large objects with a minimum of effort. The Archimedes' screw underpins modern hydroengineering, and his machines of war helped to hold back the armies of Rome in the First Punic War. Archimedes even tore apart the arguments of Aristotle and his metaphysics, pointing out that it was impossible to separate mathematics and nature and proved it by converting mathematical theories into practical inventions. Furthermore, in his work \"On Floating Bodies\", around 250 BCE, Archimedes developed the law of buoyancy, also known as Archimedes' principle. In mathematics, Archimedes used the method of exhaustion to calculate the area under the arc of a parabola with the summation of an infinite series, and gave a remarkably accurate approximation of pi. He also defined the spiral bearing his name, formulae for the volumes of surfaces of revolution and an ingenious system for expressing very large numbers. He also developed the principles of equilibrium states and centers of gravity, ideas that would influence future scholars like Galileo, and Newton.\nHipparchus (190\u2013120 BCE), focusing on astronomy and mathematics, used sophisticated geometrical techniques to map the motion of the stars and planets, even predicting the times that Solar eclipses would happen. He added calculations of the distance of the Sun and Moon from the Earth, based upon his improvements to the observational instruments used at that time. Another of the early physicists was Ptolemy (90\u2013168 CE) during the time of the Roman Empire. Ptolemy was the author of several scientific treatises, at least three of which were of continuing importance to later Islamic and European science. The first is the astronomical treatise now known as the \"Almagest\" (in Greek, \u1f29 \u039c\u03b5\u03b3\u03ac\u03bb\u03b7 \u03a3\u03cd\u03bd\u03c4\u03b1\u03be\u03b9\u03c2, \"The Great Treatise\", originally \u039c\u03b1\u03b8\u03b7\u03bc\u03b1\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u1f74 \u03a3\u03cd\u03bd\u03c4\u03b1\u03be\u03b9\u03c2, \"Mathematical Treatise\"). The second is the \"Geography\", which is a thorough discussion of the geographic knowledge of the Greco-Roman world.\nMuch of the accumulated knowledge of the ancient world was lost. Even of the works of the many respectable thinkers, few fragments survive. Although he wrote at least fourteen books, almost nothing of Hipparchus' direct work survived. Of the 150 reputed Aristotelian works, only 30 exist, and some of those are \"little more than lecture notes\".\nIndia and China.\nImportant physical and mathematical traditions also existed in ancient Chinese and Indian sciences.\nIn Indian philosophy, Maharishi Kanada was the first to systematically develop a theory of atomism around 200 BCE though some authors have allotted him an earlier era in the 6th century BCE. It was further elaborated by the Buddhist atomists Dharmakirti and Dign\u0101ga during the 1st millennium CE. Pakudha Kaccayana, a 6th-century BCE Indian philosopher and contemporary of Gautama Buddha, had also propounded ideas about the atomic constitution of the material world. The Vaisheshika school of philosophers believed that an atom was a mere point in space. It was also first to depict relations between motion and force applied. Indian theories about the atom are greatly abstract and enmeshed in philosophy as they were based on logic and not on personal experience or experimentation.\nIn Indian astronomy, Aryabhata's \"Aryabhatiya\" (499\u00a0CE) proposed the Earth's rotation, while Nilakantha Somayaji (1444\u20131544) of the Kerala school of astronomy and mathematics proposed a semi-heliocentric model resembling the Tychonic system.\nThe study of magnetism in Ancient China dates to the 4th century BCE (in the \"Book of the Devil Valley Master\"). A main contributor to this field was Shen Kuo (1031\u20131095), a polymath and statesman who was the first to describe the magnetic-needle compass used for navigation, as well as establishing the concept of true north. In optics, Shen Kuo independently developed a camera obscura.\nIslamic world.\nIn the 7th to 15th centuries, scientific progress occurred in the Muslim world. Many classic works in Indian, Assyrian, Sassanian (Persian) and Greek, including the works of Aristotle, were translated into Arabic. Important contributions were made by Ibn al-Haytham (965\u20131040), an Arab or Persian scientist, considered to be a founder of modern optics. Ptolemy and Aristotle theorised that light either shone from the eye to illuminate objects or that \"forms\" emanated from objects themselves, whereas al-Haytham (known by the Latin name \"Alhazen\") suggested that light travels to the eye in rays from different points on an object. The works of Ibn al-Haytham and al-Biruni (973\u20131050), a Persian scientist, eventually passed on to Western Europe where they were studied by scholars such as Roger Bacon and Vitello.\nIbn al-Haytham used controlled experiments in his work on optics, although to what extent it differed from Ptolemy is debated. Arabic mechanics like B\u012br\u016bn\u012b and Al-Khazini developed sophisticated \"science of weight\", carrying out measurements of specific weights and volumes.\nIbn S\u012bn\u0101 (980\u20131037), known as \"Avicenna\", was a polymath from Bukhara (in present-day Uzbekistan) responsible for important contributions to physics, optics, philosophy and medicine. He published his theory of motion in \"Book of Healing\" (1020), where he argued that an impetus is imparted to a projectile by the thrower. He viewed it as persistent, requiring external forces such as air resistance to dissipate it. Ibn Sina made a distinction between 'force' and 'inclination' (called \"mayl\"), and argued that an object gained mayl when the object is in opposition to its natural motion. He concluded that continuation of motion is attributed to the inclination that is transferred to the object, and that object will be in motion until the mayl is spent. This conception of motion is consistent with Newton's first law of motion, inertia, which states that an object in motion will stay in motion unless it is acted on by an external force. This idea which dissented from the Aristotelian view was later described as \"impetus\" by John Buridan, who was likely influenced by Ibn Sina's \"Book of Healing\".\nHibat Allah Abu'l-Barakat al-Baghdaadi (c.\u20091080\u00a0\u2013 c.\u20091165) adopted and modified Ibn Sina's theory on projectile motion. In his \"Kitab al-Mu'tabar\", Abu'l-Barakat stated that the mover imparts a violent inclination (\"mayl qasri\") on the moved and that this diminishes as the moving object distances itself from the mover. He also proposed an explanation of the acceleration of falling bodies by the accumulation of successive increments of power with successive increments of velocity. According to Shlomo Pines, al-Baghdaadi's theory of motion was \"the oldest negation of Aristotle's fundamental dynamic law [namely, that a constant force produces a uniform motion], [and is thus an] anticipation in a vague fashion of the fundamental law of classical mechanics [namely, that a force applied continuously produces acceleration].\" Jean Buridan and Albert of Saxony later referred to Abu'l-Barakat in explaining that the acceleration of a falling body is a result of its increasing impetus.\nIbn Bajjah (c.\u20091085\u20131138), known as \"Avempace\" in Europe, proposed that for every force there is always a reaction force. Ibn Bajjah was a critic of Ptolemy and he worked on creating a new theory of velocity to replace the one theorized by Aristotle. Two future philosophers supported the theories Avempace created, known as Avempacean dynamics. These philosophers were Thomas Aquinas, a Catholic priest, and John Duns Scotus. Galileo went on to adopt Avempace's formula \"that the velocity of a given object is the difference of the motive power of that object and the resistance of the medium of motion\".\nNasir al-Din al-Tusi (1201\u20131274), a Persian astronomer and mathematician who died in Baghdad, introduced the Tusi couple an important mathematical theorem and founded the Maragha School of astronomy. \nGeocentric (but not heliocentric) astronomical models developed by the Maragha School have many striking parallels with models developed by Nicolaus Copernicus. The possibility that Maragha results may have influenced Copernicus has a been investigated in some detail.\nMedieval Europe.\nAwareness of ancient works re-entered the West through translations from Arabic to Latin. Their re-introduction, combined with Judeo-Islamic theological commentaries, had a great influence on Medieval philosophers such as Thomas Aquinas. Scholastic European scholars, who sought to reconcile the philosophy of the ancient classical philosophers with Christian theology, proclaimed Aristotle the greatest thinker of the ancient world. In cases where they did not directly contradict the Bible, Aristotelian physics became the foundation for the physical explanations of the European Churches. Quantification became a core element of medieval physics.\nBased on Aristotelian physics, Scholastic physics described things as moving according to their essential nature. Celestial objects were described as moving in circles, because perfect circular motion was considered an innate property of objects that existed in the uncorrupted realm of the celestial spheres. \nMotions below the lunar sphere were seen as imperfect, and thus could not be expected to exhibit consistent motion. More idealized motion in the \"sublunary\" realm could only be achieved through artifice, and prior to the 17th century, many did not view artificial experiments as a valid means of learning about the natural world. Physical explanations in the sublunary realm revolved around tendencies. Stones contained the element earth, and earthly objects tended to move in a straight line toward the centre of the earth (and the universe in the Aristotelian geocentric view) unless otherwise prevented from doing so.\nAristotle's physics was not scrutinized until John Philoponus, who relied on observation rather than verbal argument like Aristotle.\nPhiloponus' criticism of Aristotelian principles of physics served as an inspiration for Galileo Galilei ten centuries later, during the Scientific Revolution. Galileo cited Philoponus substantially in his works when arguing that Aristotelian physics was flawed. In the 1300s Jean Buridan, a teacher in the faculty of arts at the University of Paris, developed the concept of impetus. It was a step toward the modern ideas of inertia and momentum.\nScientific Revolution.\nDuring the 16th and 17th centuries, a large advancement of scientific progress known as the Scientific Revolution took place in Europe. Dissatisfaction with older philosophical approaches had begun earlier and had produced other changes in society, such as the Protestant Reformation, but the revolution in science began when natural philosophers began to mount a sustained attack on the Scholastic philosophical programme and supposed that mathematical descriptive schemes adopted from such fields as mechanics and astronomy could actually yield universally valid characterizations of motion and other concepts.\nNicolaus Copernicus.\nA breakthrough in astronomy was made by Renaissance astronomer Nicolaus Copernicus (1473\u20131543) when, in 1543, he gave strong arguments for the heliocentric model of the Solar System, ostensibly as a means to render tables charting planetary motion more accurate and to simplify their production. In heliocentric models of the Solar system, the Earth orbits the Sun along with other bodies in Earth's galaxy, a contradiction according to the Greek-Egyptian astronomer Ptolemy (2nd century CE; see above), whose system placed the Earth at the center of the Universe and had been accepted for over 1,400 years. The Greek astronomer Aristarchus of Samos (c.\u2009310\u00a0\u2013 c.\u2009230 BCE) had suggested that the Earth revolves around the Sun, but Copernicus's reasoning led to lasting general acceptance of this \"revolutionary\" idea. Copernicus's book presenting the theory (\"De revolutionibus orbium coelestium\", \"On the Revolutions of the Celestial Spheres\") was published just before his death in 1543 and, as it is now generally considered to mark the beginning of modern astronomy, is also considered to mark the beginning of the Scientific Revolution. Copernicus's new perspective, along with the accurate observations made by Tycho Brahe, enabled German astronomer Johannes Kepler (1571\u20131630) to formulate his laws regarding planetary motion that remain in use today.\nGalileo Galilei.\nThe Italian mathematician, astronomer, and physicist Galileo Galilei (1564\u20131642) was a supporter of Copernicanism who made numerous astronomical discoveries, carried out empirical experiments and improved the telescope. As a mathematician, Galileo's role in the university culture of his era was subordinated to the three major topics of study: law, medicine, and theology (which was closely allied to philosophy). Galileo, however, felt that the descriptive content of the technical disciplines warranted philosophical interest, particularly because mathematical analysis of astronomical observations\u00a0\u2013 notably, Copernicus's analysis of the relative motions of the Sun, Earth, Moon, and planets\u00a0\u2013 indicated that philosophers' statements about the nature of the universe could be shown to be in error. Galileo also performed mechanical experiments, insisting that motion itself\u00a0\u2013 regardless of whether it was produced \"naturally\" or \"artificially\" (i.e. deliberately)\u00a0\u2013 had universally consistent characteristics that could be described mathematically.\nGalileo's early studies at the University of Pisa were in medicine, but he was soon drawn to mathematics and physics. At age 19, he discovered (and, subsequently, verified) the isochronal nature of the pendulum when, using his pulse, he timed the oscillations of a swinging lamp in Pisa's cathedral and found that it remained the same for each swing regardless of the swing's amplitude. He soon became known through his invention of a hydrostatic balance and for his treatise on the center of gravity of solid bodies. While teaching at the University of Pisa (1589\u20131592), he initiated his experiments concerning the laws of bodies in motion that brought results so contradictory to the accepted teachings of Aristotle that strong antagonism was aroused. He found that bodies do not fall with velocities proportional to their weights. The story in which Galileo is said to have dropped weights from the Leaning Tower of Pisa is apocryphal, but he did find that the path of a projectile is a parabola and is credited with conclusions that anticipated Newton's laws of motion (e.g. the notion of inertia). Among these is what is now called Galilean relativity, the first precisely formulated statement about properties of space and time outside three-dimensional geometry.\nGalileo has been called the \"father of modern observational astronomy\", the \"father of modern physics\", the \"father of science\", and \"the father of modern science\". According to Stephen Hawking, \"Galileo, perhaps more than any other single person, was responsible for the birth of modern science.\" As religious orthodoxy decreed a geocentric or Tychonic understanding of the Solar system, Galileo's support for heliocentrism provoked controversy and he was tried by the Inquisition. Found \"vehemently suspect of heresy\", he was forced to recant and spent the rest of his life under house arrest.\nThe contributions that Galileo made to observational astronomy include the telescopic confirmation of the phases of Venus; his discovery, in 1609, of Jupiter's four largest moons (subsequently given the collective name of the \"Galilean moons\"); and the observation and analysis of sunspots. Galileo also pursued applied science and technology, inventing, among other instruments, a military compass. His discovery of the Jovian moons was published in 1610, enabling him to obtain the position of mathematician and philosopher to the Medici court. As such, he was expected to engage in debates with philosophers in the Aristotelian tradition and received a large audience for his own publications such as the \"Discourses and Mathematical Demonstrations Concerning Two New Sciences\" (published abroad following his arrest for the publication of \"Dialogue Concerning the Two Chief World Systems\") and \"The Assayer\". Galileo's interest in experimenting with and formulating mathematical descriptions of motion established experimentation as an integral part of natural philosophy. This tradition, combining with the non-mathematical emphasis on the collection of \"experimental histories\" by philosophical reformists such as William Gilbert and Francis Bacon, drew a significant following in the years leading to and following Galileo's death, including Evangelista Torricelli and the participants in the Accademia del Cimento in Italy; Marin Mersenne and Blaise Pascal in France; Christiaan Huygens in the Netherlands; and Robert Hooke and Robert Boyle in England.\nJohannes Kepler.\nJohannes Kepler (1571\u20131630) was a German astronomer, mathematician, astrologer, natural philosopher and a key figure in the 17th century Scientific Revolution, best known for his laws of planetary motion, and his books \"Astronomia nova\", \"Harmonice Mundi\", and \"Epitome Astronomiae Copernicanae\", influencing among others Isaac Newton, providing one of the foundations for his theory of universal gravitation. The variety and impact of his work made Kepler one of the founders of modern astronomy, the scientific method, natural and modern science.\nKepler was partly driven by his belief that there is an intelligible plan that is accessible through reason. Kepler described his new astronomy as \"celestial physics\", as \"an excursion into Aristotle's \"Metaphysics\"\", and as \"a supplement to Aristotle's \"On the Heavens\"\", treating astronomy as part of a universal mathematical physics.\nRen\u00e9 Descartes.\nThe French philosopher Ren\u00e9 Descartes (1596\u20131650) was well-connected to, and influential within, experimental philosophy networks. Descartes had an agenda, however, which was geared toward replacing the Scholastic philosophical tradition. Questioning the reality interpreted through the senses, Descartes sought to re-establish philosophical explanations by reducing all phenomena to the motion of an invisible sea of \"corpuscles\". (Notably, he reserved human thought and God from his scheme, holding these to be separate from the physical universe). In proposing this philosophical framework, Descartes supposed that different kinds of motion, such as that of planets versus that of terrestrial objects, were not fundamentally different, but were manifestations of an endless chain of corpuscular motions obeying universal principles. Particularly influential were his explanations for circular astronomical motions in terms of the vortex motion of corpuscles in space (Descartes argued, in accord with the beliefs, if not the methods, of the Scholastics, that a vacuum could not exist), and his explanation of gravity in terms of corpuscles pushing objects downward.\nDescartes, like Galileo, was convinced of the importance of mathematical explanation, and he and his followers were key figures in the development of mathematics and geometry in the 17th century. Cartesian mathematical descriptions of motion held that all mathematical formulations had to be justifiable in terms of direct physical action, a position held by Christiaan Huygens and the German philosopher Gottfried Leibniz, who, while following in the Cartesian tradition, developed his own philosophical alternative to Scholasticism, which he outlined in his 1714 work, the \"Monadology\". Descartes has been dubbed the \"Father of Modern Philosophy\", and much subsequent Western philosophy is a response to his writings, which are studied closely to this day. In particular, his \"Meditations on First Philosophy\" continues to be a standard text at most university philosophy departments. Descartes' influence in mathematics is equally apparent; the Cartesian coordinate system\u00a0\u2013 allowing algebraic equations to be expressed as geometric shapes in a two-dimensional coordinate system\u00a0\u2013 was named after him. He is credited as the father of analytical geometry, the bridge between algebra and geometry, important to the discovery of calculus and analysis.\nChristiaan Huygens.\nThe Dutch physicist, mathematician, astronomer and inventor Christiaan Huygens (1629\u20131695) was the leading scientist in Europe between Galileo and Newton. Huygens came from a family of nobility that had an important position in the Dutch society of the 17th century; a time in which the Dutch Republic flourished economically and culturally. This period\u00a0\u2013 roughly between 1588 and 1702\u00a0\u2013 of the history of the Netherlands is also referred to as the Dutch Golden Age, an era during the Scientific Revolution when Dutch science was among the most acclaimed in Europe. At this time, intellectuals and scientists like Ren\u00e9 Descartes, Baruch Spinoza, Pierre Bayle, Antonie van Leeuwenhoek, John Locke and Hugo Grotius resided in the Netherlands. It was in this intellectual environment that Christiaan Huygens grew up. Christiaan's father, Constantijn Huygens, was, apart from an important poet, the secretary and diplomat for the Princes of Orange. He knew many scientists of his time because of his contacts and intellectual interests, including Ren\u00e9 Descartes and Marin Mersenne, and it was because of these contacts that Christiaan Huygens became aware of their work, especially Descartes, whose mechanistic philosophy was going to have a huge influence on Huygens' own work. Descartes was later impressed by the skills Huygens showed in geometry, as was Mersenne, who christened him \"the new Archimedes\" (which led Constantijn to refer to his son as \"my little Archimedes\").\nA child prodigy, Huygens began his correspondence with Marin Mersenne when he was 17 years old. Huygens became interested in games of chance when he encountered the work of Fermat, Blaise Pascal and Girard Desargues. It was Pascal who encouraged him to write \"Van Rekeningh in Spelen van Gluck\", which Frans van Schooten translated and published as \"De Ratiociniis in Ludo Aleae\" in 1657. The book is the earliest known scientific treatment of the subject, and at the time the most coherent presentation of a mathematical approach to games of chance. Two years later Huygens derived geometrically the now standard formulae in classical mechanics for the centripetal- and centrifugal force in his work \"De vi Centrifuga\" (1659). Around the same time Huygens' research in horology resulted in the invention of the pendulum clock; a breakthrough in timekeeping and the most accurate timekeeper for almost 300 years. The theoretical research of the way the pendulum works eventually led to the publication of one of his most important achievements: the Horologium Oscillatorium. This work was published in 1673 and became one of the three most important 17th century works on mechanics (the other two being Galileo's \"Discourses and Mathematical Demonstrations Relating to Two New Sciences\" (1638) and Newton's \"Philosophi\u00e6 Naturalis Principia Mathematica\" (1687)). The \"Horologium Oscillatorium\" is the first modern treatise in which a physical problem (the accelerated motion of a falling body) is idealized by a set of parameters then analyzed mathematically and constitutes one of the seminal works of applied mathematics. It is for this reason, Huygens has been called the first theoretical physicist and one of the founders of modern mathematical physics. Huygens' \"Horologium Oscillatorium\" influenced the work of Isaac Newton, who admired the work. For instance, the laws Huygens described in the \"Horologium Oscillatorium\" are structurally the same as Newton's first two laws of motion.\nFive years after the publication of his \"Horologium Oscillatorium\", Huygens described his wave theory of light. Though proposed in 1678, it was not published until 1690 in his Trait\u00e9 de la Lumi\u00e8re. His mathematical theory of light was initially rejected in favour of Newton's corpuscular theory of light, until Augustin-Jean Fresnel adopted Huygens' principle to give a complete explanation of the rectilinear propagation and diffraction effects of light in 1821. Today this principle is known as the Huygens\u2013Fresnel principle.\nAs an astronomer, Huygens began grinding lenses with his brother Constantijn Jr. to build telescopes for astronomical research. He was the first to identify the rings of Saturn as \"a thin, flat ring, nowhere touching, and inclined to the ecliptic,\" and discovered the first of Saturn's moons, Titan, using a refracting telescope.\nHuygens was also the first who brought mathematical rigor to the description of physical phenomena. Because of this, and the fact that he developed institutional frameworks for scientific research on the continent, he has been referred to as \"the leading actor in 'the making of science in Europe'\"\nIsaac Newton.\nCambridge University physicist and mathematician Sir Isaac Newton (1642\u20131727) was a fellow of the Royal Society of England, who created a single system for describing the workings of the universe. Newton formulated three laws of motion which formulated the relationship between motion and objects and also the law of universal gravitation, the latter of which could be used to explain the behavior not only of falling bodies on the earth but also planets and other celestial bodies. To arrive at his results, Newton invented one form of an entirely new branch of mathematics: calculus (also invented independently by Gottfried Leibniz), which was to become an essential tool in much of the later development in most branches of physics. Newton's findings were set forth in his \"Philosophi\u00e6 Naturalis Principia Mathematica\" (\"Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy\"), the publication of which in 1687 marked the beginning of the modern period of mechanics and astronomy.\nNewton refuted the Cartesian mechanical tradition that all motions should be explained with respect to the immediate force exerted by corpuscles. Using his three laws of motion and law of universal gravitation, Newton removed the idea that objects followed paths determined by natural shapes and instead demonstrated that all the future motions of any body could be deduced mathematically based on knowledge of their existing motion, their mass, and the forces acting upon them. However, observed celestial motions did not precisely conform to a Newtonian treatment, and Newton, who was also deeply interested in theology, imagined that God intervened to ensure the continued stability of the solar system.\nNewton's principles (but not his mathematical treatments) proved controversial with Continental philosophers, who found his lack of metaphysical explanation for movement and gravitation philosophically unacceptable. Beginning around 1700, a bitter rift opened between the Continental and British philosophical traditions, which were stoked by heated, ongoing, and viciously personal disputes between the followers of Newton and Leibniz concerning priority over the analytical techniques of calculus, which each had developed independently. Initially, the Cartesian and Leibnizian traditions prevailed on the Continent (leading to the dominance of the Leibnizian calculus notation everywhere except Britain). Newton himself remained privately disturbed at the lack of a philosophical understanding of gravitation while insisting in his writings that none was necessary to infer its reality. As the 18th century progressed, Continental natural philosophers increasingly accepted the Newtonians' willingness to forgo ontological metaphysical explanations for mathematically described motions.\nNewton built the first functioning reflecting telescope and developed a theory of color, published in \"Opticks\", based on the observation that a prism decomposes white light into the many colours forming the visible spectrum. While Newton explained light as being composed of tiny particles, a rival theory of light which explained its behavior in terms of waves was presented in 1690 by Christiaan Huygens. However, the belief in the mechanistic philosophy coupled with Newton's reputation meant that the wave theory saw relatively little support until the 19th century. Newton also formulated an empirical law of cooling, studied the speed of sound, investigated power series, demonstrated the generalised binomial theorem and developed a method for approximating the roots of a function. His work on infinite series was inspired by Simon Stevin's decimals. Most importantly, Newton showed that the motions of objects on Earth and of celestial bodies are governed by the same set of natural laws, which were neither capricious nor malevolent. By demonstrating the consistency between Kepler's laws of planetary motion and his own theory of gravitation, Newton also removed the last doubts about heliocentrism. By bringing together all the ideas set forth during the Scientific Revolution, Newton effectively established the foundation for modern society in mathematics and science.\nOther achievements.\nOther branches of physics also received attention during the period of the Scientific Revolution. William Gilbert, court physician to Queen Elizabeth I, described how the earth itself behaves like a giant magnet. Robert Boyle (1627\u20131691) studied the behavior of gases enclosed in a chamber and formulated the gas law named for him; he also contributed to physiology and to the founding of modern chemistry.\nAnother factor in the Scientific Revolution was the rise of learned societies and academies in various countries. The earliest of these were in Italy and Germany and were short-lived. More influential were the Royal Society of England (1660) and the Academy of Sciences in France (1666). The former was a private institution in London and included John Wallis, William Brouncker, Thomas Sydenham, John Mayow, and Christopher Wren (who contributed not only to architecture but also to astronomy and anatomy); the latter, in Paris, was a government institution and included as a foreign member the Dutchman Huygens. In the 18th century, important royal academies were established at Berlin (1700) and at St. Petersburg (1724). The societies and academies provided the principal opportunities for the publication and discussion of scientific results during and after the scientific revolution. In 1690, James Bernoulli showed that the cycloid is the solution to the tautochrone problem; and the following year, in 1691, Johann Bernoulli showed that a chain freely suspended from two points will form a catenary, the curve with the lowest possible center of gravity available to any chain hung between two fixed points. He then showed, in 1696, that the cycloid is the solution to the brachistochrone problem.\nEarly thermodynamics.\nA precursor of the engine was designed by the German scientist Otto von Guericke who, in 1650, designed and built the world's first vacuum pump to create a vacuum as demonstrated in the Magdeburg hemispheres experiment. He was driven to make a vacuum to disprove Aristotle's long-held supposition that 'Nature abhors a vacuum'. Shortly thereafter, Irish physicist and chemist Boyle had learned of Guericke's designs and in 1656, in coordination with English scientist Robert Hooke, built an air pump. Using this pump, Boyle and Hooke noticed the pressure-volume correlation for a gas: \"PV\" = \"k\", where \"P\" is pressure, \"V\" is volume and \"k\" is a constant: this relationship is known as Boyle's law. In that time, air was assumed to be a system of motionless particles, and not interpreted as a system of moving molecules. The concept of thermal motion came two centuries later. Therefore, Boyle's publication in 1660 speaks about a mechanical concept: the air spring. Later, after the invention of the thermometer, the property temperature could be quantified. This tool gave Joseph Louis Gay-Lussac the opportunity to derive his law, which led shortly later to the ideal gas law. But, already before the establishment of the ideal gas law, an associate of Boyle's named Denis Papin built in 1679 a bone digester, which is a closed vessel with a tightly fitting lid that confines steam until a high pressure is generated.\nLater designs implemented a steam release valve to keep the machine from exploding. By watching the valve rhythmically move up and down, Papin conceived of the idea of a piston and cylinder engine. He did not however follow through with his design. Nevertheless, in 1697, based on Papin's designs, engineer Thomas Savery built the first engine. Although these early engines were crude and inefficient, they attracted the attention of the leading scientists of the time. Hence, prior to 1698 and the invention of the Savery Engine, horses were used to power pulleys, attached to buckets, which lifted water out of flooded salt mines in England. In the years to follow, more variations of steam engines were built, such as the Newcomen Engine, and later the Watt Engine. In time, these early engines would replace horses. Thus, each engine began to be associated with a certain amount of \"horse power\" depending upon how many horses it had replaced. The main problem with these first engines was that they were slow and clumsy, converting less than 2% of the input fuel into useful work. In other words, large quantities of coal (or wood) had to be burned to yield a small fraction of work output; the need for a new science of engine dynamics was born.\n18th-century developments.\nDuring the 18th century, the mechanics founded by Newton was developed by several scientists as more mathematicians learned calculus and elaborated upon its initial formulation. The application of mathematical analysis to problems of motion was known as rational mechanics, or mixed mathematics (and was later termed classical mechanics).\nMechanics.\nIn 1714, Brook Taylor derived the fundamental frequency of a stretched vibrating string in terms of its tension and mass per unit length by solving a differential equation. The Swiss mathematician Daniel Bernoulli (1700\u20131782) made important mathematical studies of the behavior of gases, anticipating the kinetic theory of gases developed more than a century later, and has been referred to as the first mathematical physicist. In 1733, Daniel Bernoulli derived the fundamental frequency and harmonics of a hanging chain by solving a differential equation. In 1734, Bernoulli solved the differential equation for the vibrations of an elastic bar clamped at one end. Bernoulli's treatment of fluid dynamics and his examination of fluid flow was introduced in his 1738 work \"Hydrodynamica\".\nRational mechanics dealt primarily with the development of elaborate mathematical treatments of observed motions, using Newtonian principles as a basis, and emphasized improving the tractability of complex calculations and developing of legitimate means of analytical approximation. A representative contemporary textbook was published by Johann Baptiste Horvath. By the end of the century analytical treatments were rigorous enough to verify the stability of the Solar System solely on the basis of Newton's laws without reference to divine intervention\u00a0\u2013 even as deterministic treatments of systems as simple as the three body problem in gravitation remained intractable. In 1705, Edmond Halley predicted the periodicity of Halley's Comet, William Herschel discovered Uranus in 1781, and Henry Cavendish measured the gravitational constant and determined the mass of the Earth in 1798. In 1783, John Michell suggested that some objects might be so massive that not even light could escape from them.\nIn 1739, Leonhard Euler solved the ordinary differential equation for a forced harmonic oscillator and noticed the resonance phenomenon. In 1742, Colin Maclaurin discovered his uniformly rotating self-gravitating spheroids. In 1742, Benjamin Robins published his \"New Principles in Gunnery\", establishing the science of aerodynamics. British work, carried on by mathematicians such as Taylor and Maclaurin, fell behind Continental developments as the century progressed. Meanwhile, work flourished at scientific academies on the Continent, led by such mathematicians as Bernoulli and Euler, as well as Joseph-Louis Lagrange, Pierre-Simon Laplace, and Adrien-Marie Legendre. In 1743, Jean le Rond d'Alembert published his \"Trait\u00e9 de dynamique\", in which he introduced the concept of generalized forces for accelerating systems and systems with constraints, and applied the new idea of virtual work to solve dynamical problem, now known as D'Alembert's principle, as a rival to Newton's second law of motion. In 1747, Pierre Louis Maupertuis applied minimum principles to mechanics. In 1759, Euler solved the partial differential equation for the vibration of a rectangular drum. In 1764, Euler examined the partial differential equation for the vibration of a circular drum and found one of the Bessel function solutions. In 1776, John Smeaton published a paper on experiments relating power, work, momentum and kinetic energy, and supporting the conservation of energy. In 1788, Lagrange presented his equations of motion in \"M\u00e9canique analytique\", in which the whole of mechanics was organized around the principle of virtual work. In 1789, Antoine Lavoisier stated the law of conservation of mass. The rational mechanics developed in the 18th century received expositions in both Lagrange's \"M\u00e9canique analytique\" and Laplace's \"Trait\u00e9 de m\u00e9canique c\u00e9leste\" (1799\u20131825).\nThermodynamics and static electricity.\nDuring the 18th century, thermodynamics was developed through the theories of weightless \"imponderable fluids\", such as heat (\"caloric\"), electricity, and phlogiston (which was rapidly overthrown as a concept following Antoine Lavoisier's identification of oxygen gas late in the century). Assuming that these concepts were real fluids, their flow could be traced through a mechanical apparatus or chemical reactions. This tradition of experimentation led to the development of new kinds of experimental apparatus, such as the Leyden jar; and new kinds of measuring instruments, such as the calorimeter, and improved versions of old ones, such as the thermometer. Experiments also produced new concepts, such as the University of Glasgow experimenter Joseph Black's notion of latent heat and Philadelphia intellectual Benjamin Franklin's characterization of electrical fluid as flowing between places of excess and deficit (a concept later reinterpreted in terms of positive and negative charges). Franklin also showed that lightning is electricity in 1752.\nThe accepted theory of heat in the 18th century viewed it as a kind of fluid, called caloric; although this theory was later shown to be erroneous, a number of scientists adhering to it nevertheless made important discoveries useful in developing the modern theory, including Joseph Black (1728\u20131799) and Henry Cavendish (1731\u20131810). Opposed to this caloric theory, which had been developed mainly by the chemists, was the less accepted theory dating from Newton's time that heat is due to the motions of the particles of a substance. This mechanical theory gained support in 1798 from the cannon-boring experiments of Count Rumford (Benjamin Thompson), who found a direct relationship between heat and mechanical energy.\nWhile it was recognized early in the 18th century that finding absolute theories of electrostatic and magnetic force akin to Newton's principles of motion would be an important achievement, none were forthcoming. This impossibility only slowly disappeared as experimental practice became more widespread and more refined in the early years of the 19th century in places such as the newly established Royal Institution in London. Meanwhile, the analytical methods of rational mechanics began to be applied to experimental phenomena, most influentially with the French mathematician Joseph Fourier's analytical treatment of the flow of heat, as published in 1822. Joseph Priestley proposed an electrical inverse-square law in 1767, and Charles-Augustin de Coulomb introduced the inverse-square law of electrostatics in 1798.\nAt the end of the century, the members of the French Academy of Sciences had attained clear dominance in the field. At the same time, the experimental tradition established by Galileo and his followers persisted. The Royal Society and the French Academy of Sciences were major centers for the performance and reporting of experimental work. Experiments in mechanics, optics, magnetism, static electricity, chemistry, and physiology were not clearly distinguished from each other during the 18th century, but significant differences in explanatory schemes and, thus, experiment design were emerging. Chemical experimenters, for instance, defied attempts to enforce a scheme of abstract Newtonian forces onto chemical affiliations, and instead focused on the isolation and classification of chemical substances and reactions.\n19th century.\nMechanics.\nIn 1821, William Hamilton began his analysis of Hamilton's characteristic function. In 1835, he stated Hamilton's canonical equations of motion.\nIn 1813, Peter Ewart supported the idea of the conservation of energy in his paper \"On the measure of moving force\". In 1829, Gaspard Coriolis introduced the terms of work (force times distance) and kinetic energy with the meanings they have today. In 1841, Julius Robert von Mayer, an amateur scientist, wrote a paper on the conservation of energy, although his lack of academic training led to its rejection. In 1847, Hermann von Helmholtz formally stated the law of conservation of energy.\nElectromagnetism.\nIn 1800, Alessandro Volta invented the electric battery (known as the voltaic pile) and thus improved the way electric currents could also be studied. A year later, Thomas Young demonstrated the wave nature of light\u00a0\u2013 which received strong experimental support from the work of Augustin-Jean Fresnel\u00a0\u2013 and the principle of interference. In 1820, Hans Christian \u00d8rsted found that a current-carrying conductor gives rise to a magnetic force surrounding it, and within a week after \u00d8rsted's discovery reached France, Andr\u00e9-Marie Amp\u00e8re discovered that two parallel electric currents will exert forces on each other. In 1821, Michael Faraday built an electricity-powered motor, while Georg Ohm stated his law of electrical resistance in 1826, expressing the relationship between voltage, current, and resistance in an electric circuit.\nIn 1831, Faraday (and independently Joseph Henry) discovered the reverse effect, the production of an electric potential or current through magnetism\u00a0\u2013 known as electromagnetic induction; these two discoveries are the basis of the electric motor and the electric generator, respectively.\nIn 1873, James Clerk Maxwell published \"A Treatise on Electricity and Magnetism\", which described the transmission of energy in wave form through a \"luminiferous ether\", and suggested that light was such a wave. This was confirmed in 1888 when Helmholtz student Heinrich Hertz generated and detected electromagnetic radiation in the laboratory.\nLaws of thermodynamics.\nIn the 19th century, the connection between heat and mechanical energy was established quantitatively by Julius Robert von Mayer and James Prescott Joule, who measured the mechanical equivalent of heat in the 1840s. In 1849, Joule published results from his series of experiments (including the paddlewheel experiment) which show that heat is a form of energy, a fact that was accepted in the 1850s. The relation between heat and energy was important for the development of steam engines, and in 1824 the experimental and theoretical work of Sadi Carnot was published. Carnot captured some of the ideas of thermodynamics in his discussion of the efficiency of an idealized engine. Sadi Carnot's work provided a basis for the formulation of the first law of thermodynamics\u00a0\u2013 a restatement of the law of conservation of energy\u00a0\u2013 which was stated around 1850 by William Thomson, later known as Lord Kelvin, and Rudolf Clausius. Lord Kelvin, who had extended the concept of absolute zero from gases to all substances in 1848, drew upon the engineering theory of Lazare Carnot, Sadi Carnot, and \u00c9mile Clapeyron as well as the experimentation of James Prescott Joule on the interchangeability of mechanical, chemical, thermal, and electrical forms of work to formulate the first law.\nKelvin and Clausius also stated the second law of thermodynamics, which was originally formulated in terms of the fact that heat does not spontaneously flow from a colder body to a warmer one. Other formulations followed quickly (for example, the second law was expounded in Thomson and Peter Guthrie Tait's influential work \"Treatise on Natural Philosophy\") and Kelvin in particular understood some of the law's general implications. The second Law \u2013 the idea that gases consist of molecules in motion \u2013 had been discussed in some detail by Daniel Bernoulli in 1738, but had fallen out of favor, and was revived by Clausius in 1857. In 1850, Hippolyte Fizeau and L\u00e9on Foucault measured the speed of light in water and found that it is slower than in air, in support of the wave model of light. In 1852, Joule and Thomson demonstrated that a rapidly expanding gas cools, later named the Joule\u2013Thomson effect or Joule\u2013Kelvin effect. Hermann von Helmholtz put forward the idea of the heat death of the universe in 1854, the same year that Clausius established the importance of \"dQ/T\" (Clausius's theorem) (though he did not yet name the quantity).\nStatistical mechanics.\nIn 1860, James Clerk Maxwell worked out the mathematics of the distribution of velocities of the molecules of a gas, known today as the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution.\nThe atomic theory of matter had been proposed again in the early 19th century by the chemist John Dalton and became one of the hypotheses of the kinetic-molecular theory of gases developed by Clausius and James Clerk Maxwell to explain the laws of thermodynamics.\nThe kinetic theory in turn led to a revolutionary approach to science, the statistical mechanics of Ludwig Boltzmann (1844\u20131906) and Josiah Willard Gibbs (1839\u20131903), which studies the statistics of microstates of a system and uses statistics to determine the state of a physical system. Interrelating the statistical likelihood of certain states of organization of these particles with the energy of those states, Clausius reinterpreted the dissipation of energy to be the statistical tendency of molecular configurations to pass toward increasingly likely, increasingly disorganized states (coining the term \"entropy\" to describe the disorganization of a state). The statistical versus absolute interpretations of the second law of thermodynamics set up a dispute that would last for several decades (producing arguments such as \"Maxwell's demon\"), and that would not be held to be definitively resolved until the behavior of atoms was firmly established in the early 20th century. In 1902, James Jeans found the length scale required for gravitational perturbations to grow in a static nearly homogeneous medium.\nOther developments.\nIn 1822, botanist Robert Brown discovered Brownian motion: pollen grains in water undergoing movement resulting from their bombardment by the fast-moving atoms or molecules in the liquid.\nIn 1834, Carl Jacobi discovered his uniformly rotating self-gravitating ellipsoids (the Jacobi ellipsoid).\nIn 1834, John Russell observed a nondecaying solitary water wave (soliton) in the Union Canal near Edinburgh, Scotland, and used a water tank to study the dependence of solitary water wave velocities on wave amplitude and water depth. In 1835, Gaspard Coriolis examined theoretically the mechanical efficiency of waterwheels, and deduced the Coriolis effect. In 1842, Christian Doppler proposed the Doppler effect.\nIn 1851, L\u00e9on Foucault showed the Earth's rotation with a huge pendulum (Foucault pendulum).\nThere were important advances in continuum mechanics in the first half of the century, namely formulation of laws of elasticity for solids and discovery of Navier\u2013Stokes equations for fluids.\n20th century: birth of modern physics.\nAt the end of the 19th century, physics had evolved to the point at which classical mechanics could cope with highly complex problems involving macroscopic situations; thermodynamics and kinetic theory were well established; geometrical and physical optics could be understood in terms of electromagnetic waves; and the conservation laws for energy and momentum (and mass) were widely accepted. So profound were these and other developments that it was generally accepted that all the important laws of physics had been discovered and that, henceforth, research would be concerned with clearing up minor problems and particularly with improvements of method and measurement.\nHowever, around 1900 serious doubts arose about the completeness of the classical theories\u00a0\u2013 the triumph of Maxwell's theories, for example, was undermined by inadequacies that had already begun to appear\u00a0\u2013 and their inability to explain certain physical phenomena, such as the energy distribution in blackbody radiation and the photoelectric effect, while some of the theoretical formulations led to paradoxes when pushed to the limit. Prominent physicists such as Hendrik Lorentz, Emil Cohn, Ernst Wiechert and Wilhelm Wien believed that some modification of Maxwell's equations might provide the basis for all physical laws. These shortcomings of classical physics were never to be resolved and new ideas were required. At the beginning of the 20th century, a major revolution shook the world of physics, which led to a new era, generally referred to as modern physics.\nRadiation experiments.\nIn the 19th century, experimenters began to detect unexpected forms of radiation: Wilhelm R\u00f6ntgen caused a sensation with his discovery of X-rays in 1895; in 1896 Henri Becquerel discovered that certain kinds of matter emit radiation on their own accord. In 1897, J. J. Thomson discovered the electron, and new radioactive elements found by Marie and Pierre Curie raised questions about the supposedly indestructible atom and the nature of matter. Marie and Pierre coined the term \"radioactivity\" to describe this property of matter, and isolated the radioactive elements radium and polonium. Ernest Rutherford and Frederick Soddy identified two of Becquerel's forms of radiation with electrons and the element helium. Rutherford identified and named two types of radioactivity and in 1911 interpreted experimental evidence as showing that the atom consists of a dense, positively charged nucleus surrounded by negatively charged electrons. Classical theory, however, predicted that this structure should be unstable. Classical theory had also failed to explain successfully two other experimental results that appeared in the late 19th century. One of these was the demonstration by Albert A. Michelson and Edward W. Morley\u00a0\u2013 known as the Michelson\u2013Morley experiment\u00a0\u2013 which showed there did not seem to be a preferred frame of reference, at rest with respect to the hypothetical luminiferous ether, for describing electromagnetic phenomena. Studies of radiation and radioactive decay continued to be a preeminent focus for physical and chemical research through the 1930s, when the discovery of nuclear fission by Lise Meitner and Otto Frisch opened the way to the practical exploitation of what came to be called \"atomic\" energy.\nAlbert Einstein's theory of relativity.\nIn 1905, a 26-year-old German physicist named Albert Einstein (then a patent clerk in Bern, Switzerland) showed how measurements of time and space are affected by motion between an observer and what is being observed. Einstein's radical theory of relativity revolutionized science. Although Einstein made many other important contributions to science, the theory of relativity alone is one of the greatest intellectual achievements of all time. Although the concept of relativity was not introduced by Einstein, he recognised that the speed of light in vacuum is constant, i.e., the same for all observers, and an absolute upper limit to speed. This does not impact a person's day-to-day life since most objects travel at speeds much slower than light speed. For objects travelling near light speed, however, the theory of relativity shows that clocks associated with those objects will run more slowly and that the objects shorten in length according to measurements of an observer on Earth. Einstein also derived the equation, \"E\" = \"mc\"2, which expresses the equivalence of mass and energy.\nSpecial relativity.\nEinstein argued that the speed of light was a constant in all inertial reference frames and that electromagnetic laws should remain valid independent of reference frame\u00a0\u2013 assertions which rendered the ether \"superfluous\" to physical theory, and that held that observations of time and length varied relative to how the observer was moving with respect to the object being measured (what came to be called the \"special theory of relativity\"). It also followed that mass and energy were interchangeable quantities according to the equation \"E\"=\"mc\"2. In another paper published the same year, Einstein asserted that electromagnetic radiation was transmitted in discrete quantities (\"quanta\"), according to a constant that the theoretical physicist Max Planck had posited in 1900 to arrive at an accurate theory for the distribution of blackbody radiation\u00a0\u2013 an assumption that explained the strange properties of the photoelectric effect.\nThe special theory of relativity is a formulation of the relationship between physical observations and the concepts of space and time. The theory arose out of contradictions between electromagnetism and Newtonian mechanics and had great impact on both those areas. The original historical issue was whether it was meaningful to discuss the electromagnetic wave-carrying \"ether\" and motion relative to it and also whether one could detect such motion, as was unsuccessfully attempted in the Michelson\u2013Morley experiment. Einstein demolished these questions and the ether concept in his special theory of relativity. However, his basic formulation does not involve detailed electromagnetic theory. It arises out of the question: \"What is time?\" Newton, in the \"Principia\" (1686), had given an unambiguous answer: \"Absolute, true, and mathematical time, of itself, and from its own nature, flows equably without relation to anything external, and by another name is called duration.\" This definition is basic to all classical physics.\nEinstein had the genius to question it, and found that it was incomplete. Instead, each \"observer\" necessarily makes use of his or her own scale of time, and for two observers in relative motion, their time-scales will differ. This induces a related effect on position measurements. Space and time become intertwined concepts, fundamentally dependent on the observer. Each observer presides over his or her own space-time framework or coordinate system. There being no absolute frame of reference, all observers of given events make different but equally valid (and reconcilable) measurements. What remains absolute is stated in Einstein's relativity postulate: \"The basic laws of physics are identical for two observers who have a constant relative velocity with respect to each other.\"\nSpecial relativity had a profound effect on physics: started as a rethinking of the theory of electromagnetism, it found a new symmetry law of nature, now called \"Poincar\u00e9 symmetry\", that replaced Galilean symmetry.\nSpecial relativity exerted another long-lasting effect on dynamics. Although initially it was credited with the \"unification of mass and energy\", it became evident that relativistic dynamics established a \"distinction\" between rest mass, which is an invariant (observer independent) property of a particle or system of particles, and the energy and momentum of a system. The latter two are separately conserved in all situations but not invariant with respect to different observers. The term \"mass\" in particle physics underwent a semantic change, and since the late 20th century it almost exclusively denotes the rest (or \"invariant\") mass. \nGeneral relativity.\nBy 1916, Einstein was able to generalize this further, to deal with all states of motion including non-uniform acceleration, which became the general theory of relativity. In this theory, Einstein also specified a new concept, the curvature of space-time, which described the gravitational effect at every point in space. The curvature of space-time replaced Newton's universal law of gravitation. According to Einstein, gravitational force in the normal sense is an illusion caused by the geometry of space. The presence of a mass causes a curvature of space-time in the vicinity of the mass, and this curvature dictates the space-time path that all freely-moving objects follow. It was also predicted from this theory that light should be subject to gravity\u00a0\u2013 all of which was verified experimentally. This aspect of relativity explained the phenomena of light bending around the sun, predicted black holes as well as properties of the Cosmic microwave background radiation\u00a0\u2013 a discovery rendering fundamental anomalies in the classic Steady-State hypothesis. For his work on relativity, the photoelectric effect and blackbody radiation, Einstein received the Nobel Prize in 1921.\nThe gradual acceptance of Einstein's theories of relativity and the quantized nature of light transmission, and of Niels Bohr's model of the atom created as many problems as they solved, leading to a full-scale effort to reestablish physics on new fundamental principles. Expanding relativity to cases of accelerating reference frames (the \"general theory of relativity\") in the 1910s, Einstein posited an equivalence between the inertial force of acceleration and the force of gravity, leading to the conclusion that space is curved and finite in size, and the prediction of such phenomena as gravitational lensing and the distortion of time in gravitational fields.\nQuantum mechanics.\nAlthough relativity resolved the electromagnetic phenomena conflict demonstrated by Michelson and Morley, a second theoretical problem was the explanation of the distribution of electromagnetic radiation emitted by a black body; experiment showed that at shorter wavelengths, toward the ultraviolet end of the spectrum, the energy approached zero, but classical theory predicted it should become infinite. This glaring discrepancy, known as the ultraviolet catastrophe, was solved by the new theory of quantum mechanics. Quantum mechanics is the theory of atoms and subatomic systems. Approximately the first 30 years of the 20th century represent the time of the conception and evolution of the theory. The basic ideas of quantum theory were introduced in 1900 by Max Planck (1858\u20131947), who was awarded the Nobel Prize for Physics in 1918 for his discovery of the quantified nature of energy. The quantum theory (which previously relied in the \"correspondence\" at large scales between the quantized world of the atom and the continuities of the \"classical\" world) was accepted when the Compton Effect established that light carries momentum and can scatter off particles, and when Louis de Broglie asserted that matter can be seen as behaving as a wave in much the same way as electromagnetic waves behave like particles (wave\u2013particle duality).\nIn 1905, Einstein used the quantum theory to explain the photoelectric effect, and in 1913 the Danish physicist Niels Bohr used the same constant to explain the stability of Rutherford's atom as well as the frequencies of light emitted by hydrogen gas. The quantized theory of the atom gave way to a full-scale quantum mechanics in the 1920s. New principles of a \"quantum\" rather than a \"classical\" mechanics, formulated in matrix-form by Werner Heisenberg, Max Born, and Pascual Jordan in 1925, were based on the probabilistic relationship between discrete \"states\" and denied the possibility of causality. Quantum mechanics was extensively developed by Heisenberg, Wolfgang Pauli, Paul Dirac, and Erwin Schr\u00f6dinger, who established an equivalent theory based on waves in 1926; but Heisenberg's 1927 \"uncertainty principle\" (indicating the impossibility of precisely and simultaneously measuring position and momentum) and the \"Copenhagen interpretation\" of quantum mechanics (named after Bohr's home city) continued to deny the possibility of fundamental causality, though opponents such as Einstein would metaphorically assert that \"God does not play dice with the universe\". The new quantum mechanics became an indispensable tool in the investigation and explanation of phenomena at the atomic level. Also in the 1920s, the Indian scientist Satyendra Nath Bose's work on photons and quantum mechanics provided the foundation for Bose\u2013Einstein statistics, the theory of the Bose\u2013Einstein condensate.\n The spin\u2013statistics theorem established that any particle in quantum mechanics may be either a boson (statistically Bose\u2013Einstein) or a fermion (statistically Fermi\u2013Dirac). It was later found that all fundamental bosons transmit forces, such as the photon that transmits electromagnetism.\nFermions are particles \"like electrons and nucleons\" and are the usual constituents of matter. Fermi\u2013Dirac statistics later found numerous other uses, from astrophysics (see Degenerate matter) to semiconductor design.\nDivision into classical and modern.\nThe conceptual differences between physics theories discussed in the 19th century and those that were most historically prominent in the first decades of the 20th century lead to a characterization of the earlier sciences as \"classical physics\" while the work based on quantum and relativity theories became known as \"modern physics\". Initially applied to mechanics, as in \"classical mechanics\", the divide eventually came to characterize quantum and relativistic effects. This characterization was driven initially by physicists like Max Planck and Hendrik Lorentz, established scientists who nevertheless saw issues that established theories could not explain. Their involvement and contributions to the 1911 Solvay Conference lead to the introduction of this split as a concept.\nThis division is reflected in the titles of many physics textbooks. For example, the preface of Goldstein's Classical mechanics explains why the topic is still relevant for physics students. In \"Concepts of Modern Physics\" Arthur Beiser starts with a definition of modern physics:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Modern physics began in 1900 with Max Planck\u2019s discovery of the role of energy quantization in blackbody radiation, a revolutionary idea soon followed by Albert Einstein\u2019s equally revolutionary theory of relativity and quantum theory of light.\nKenneth Krane's \"Modern physics\" begins a text on quantum and relativity theories with a few pages on deficiencies of classical physics. E.T. Whittaker's two-volume History of the Theories of Aether and Electricity subtitles volume one \"The Classical Theories\" and volume two \"The Modern Theories (1900\u20131926).\"\nContemporary physics.\nQuantum field theory.\nAs the philosophically inclined continued to debate the fundamental nature of the universe, quantum theories continued to be produced, beginning with Paul Dirac's formulation of a relativistic quantum theory in 1928. However, attempts to quantize electromagnetic theory entirely were stymied throughout the 1930s by theoretical formulations yielding infinite energies. This situation was not considered adequately resolved until after World War\u00a0II, when Julian Schwinger, Richard Feynman and Sin-Itiro Tomonaga independently posited the technique of renormalization, which allowed for an establishment of a robust quantum electrodynamics (QED).\nMeanwhile, new theories of fundamental particles proliferated with the rise of the idea of the quantization of fields through \"exchange forces\" regulated by an exchange of short-lived \"virtual\" particles, which were allowed to exist according to the laws governing the uncertainties inherent in the quantum world. Notably, Hideki Yukawa proposed that the positive charges of the nucleus were kept together courtesy of a powerful but short-range force mediated by a particle with a mass between that of the electron and proton. This particle, the \"pion\", was identified in 1947 as part of what became a slew of particles discovered after World War II. Initially, such particles were found as ionizing radiation left by cosmic rays, but increasingly came to be produced in newer and more powerful particle accelerators.\nOutside particle physics, significant advances of the time were:\nUnified field theories.\nEinstein deemed that all fundamental interactions in nature can be explained in a single theory. Unified field theories were numerous attempts to \"merge\" several interactions. One of many formulations of such theories (as well as field theories in general) is a \"gauge theory\", a generalization of the idea of symmetry. Eventually the Standard Model (see below) succeeded in unification of strong, weak, and electromagnetic interactions. All attempts to unify gravitation with something else failed.\nParticle physics and the Standard Model.\nWhen parity was broken in weak interactions by Chien-Shiung Wu in her experiment, a series of discoveries were created thereafter. The interaction of these particles by scattering and decay provided a key to new fundamental quantum theories. Murray Gell-Mann and Yuval Ne'eman brought some order to these new particles by classifying them according to certain qualities, beginning with what Gell-Mann referred to as the \"Eightfold Way\". While its further development, the quark model, at first seemed inadequate to describe strong nuclear forces, allowing the temporary rise of competing theories such as the S-Matrix, the establishment of quantum chromodynamics in the 1970s finalized a set of fundamental and exchange particles, which allowed for the establishment of a \"standard model\" based on the mathematics of gauge invariance, which successfully described all forces except for gravitation, and which remains generally accepted within its domain of application.\nThe Standard Model, based on the Yang\u2013Mills theory groups the electroweak interaction theory and quantum chromodynamics into a structure denoted by the gauge group SU(3)\u00d7SU(2)\u00d7U(1). The formulation of the unification of the electromagnetic and weak interactions in the standard model is due to Abdus Salam, Steven Weinberg and, subsequently, Sheldon Glashow. Electroweak theory was later confirmed experimentally (by observation of neutral weak currents), and distinguished by the 1979 Nobel Prize in Physics.\nSince the 1970s, fundamental particle physics has provided insights into early universe cosmology, particularly the Big Bang theory proposed as a consequence of Einstein's general theory of relativity. However, starting in the 1990s, astronomical observations have also provided new challenges, such as the need for new explanations of galactic stability (\"dark matter\") and the apparent acceleration in the expansion of the universe (\"dark energy\").\nWhile accelerators have confirmed most aspects of the Standard Model by detecting expected particle interactions at various collision energies, no theory reconciling general relativity with the Standard Model has yet been found, although supersymmetry and string theory were believed by many theorists to be a promising avenue forward. The Large Hadron Collider, however, which began operating in 2008, has failed to find any evidence that is supportive of supersymmetry and string theory.\nCosmology.\nCosmology may be said to have become a serious research question with the publication of Einstein's General Theory of Relativity in 1915 although it did not enter the scientific mainstream until the period known as the \"Golden age of general relativity\".\nAbout a decade later, in the midst of what was dubbed the \"Great Debate\", Edwin Hubble and Vesto Slipher discovered the expansion of universe in the 1920s measuring the redshifts of Doppler spectra from galactic nebulae. Using Einstein's general relativity, Georges Lema\u00eetre and George Gamow formulated what would become known as the Big Bang theory. A rival, called the steady state theory, was devised by Fred Hoyle, Thomas Gold, Jayant Narlikar and Hermann Bondi.\nCosmic microwave background radiation was verified in the 1960s by Arno Allan Penzias and Robert Woodrow Wilson, and this discovery favoured the big bang at the expense of the steady state scenario. Later work was by George Smoot et al. (1989), among other contributors, using data from the Cosmic Background explorer (CoBE) and the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP) satellites refined these observations. The 1980s (the same decade of the COBE measurements) also saw the proposal of inflation theory by Alan Guth.\nRecently the problems of dark matter and dark energy have risen to the top of the cosmology agenda.\nHiggs boson.\nOn July 4, 2012, physicists working at CERN's Large Hadron Collider announced that they had discovered a new subatomic particle greatly resembling the Higgs boson, a potential key to an understanding of why elementary particles have mass and indeed to the existence of diversity and life in the universe. For now, some physicists are calling it a \"Higgslike\" particle. Joe Incandela, of the University of California, Santa Barbara, said, \"It's something that may, in the end, be one of the biggest observations of any new phenomena in our field in the last 30 or 40 years, going way back to the discovery of quarks, for example.\" Michael Turner, a cosmologist at the University of Chicago and the chairman of the physics center board, said:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\"This is a big moment for particle physics and a crossroads \u2013 will this be the high water mark or will it be the first of many discoveries that point us toward solving the really big questions that we have posed?\"\u2014\u200a\nPeter Higgs was one of six physicists, working in three independent groups, who, in 1964, invented the notion of the Higgs field (\"cosmic molasses\"). The others were Tom Kibble of Imperial College, London; Carl Hagen of the University of Rochester; Gerald Guralnik of Brown University; and Fran\u00e7ois Englert and Robert Brout, both of Universit\u00e9 libre de Bruxelles.\nAlthough they have never been seen, Higgslike fields play an important role in theories of the universe and in string theory. Under certain conditions, according to the strange accounting of Einsteinian physics, they can become suffused with energy that exerts an antigravitational force. Such fields have been proposed as the source of an enormous burst of expansion, known as inflation, early in the universe and, possibly, as the secret of the dark energy that now seems to be accelerating the expansion of the universe.\nPhysical sciences.\nWith increased accessibility to and elaboration upon advanced analytical techniques in the 19th century, physics was defined as much, if not more, by those techniques than by the search for universal principles of motion and energy, and the fundamental nature of matter. Fields such as acoustics, geophysics, astrophysics, aerodynamics, plasma physics, low-temperature physics, and solid-state physics joined optics, fluid dynamics, electromagnetism, and mechanics as areas of physical research. In the 20th century, physics also became closely allied with such fields as electrical, aerospace and materials engineering, and physicists began to work in government and industrial laboratories as much as in academic settings. Following World War\u00a0II, the population of physicists increased dramatically, and came to be centered on the United States, while, in more recent decades, physics has become a more international pursuit than at any time in its previous history.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "13761", "revid": "23646674", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=13761", "title": "Hydrofoil", "text": "Type of fast watercraft and the name of the technology it uses\nA hydrofoil is a lifting surface, or foil, that operates in water. They are similar in appearance and purpose to aerofoils used by aeroplanes. Boats that use hydrofoil technology are also simply termed hydrofoils. As a hydrofoil craft gains speed, the hydrofoils lift the boat's hull out of the water, decreasing drag and allowing greater speeds.\nDescription.\nThe hydrofoil usually consists of a winglike structure mounted on struts below the hull, or across the keels of a catamaran in a variety of boats (see illustration). As a hydrofoil-equipped watercraft increases in speed, the hydrofoil elements below the hull(s) develop enough lift to raise the hull out of the water, which greatly reduces hull drag. This provides a corresponding increase in speed and fuel efficiency.\nWider adoption of hydrofoils is prevented by the increased complexity of building and maintaining them. Hydrofoils are generally prohibitively more expensive than conventional watercraft above a certain displacement, so most hydrofoil craft are relatively small, and are mainly used as high-speed passenger ferries, where the relatively high passenger fees can offset the high cost of the craft itself. However, the design is simple enough that there are many human-powered hydrofoil designs. Amateur experimentation and development of the concept is popular.\nHydrodynamic mechanics.\nSince air and water are governed by similar fluid equations\u2014albeit with different levels of viscosity, density, and compressibility\u2014the hydrofoil and airfoil (both types of foil) create lift in identical ways. The foil shape moves smoothly through the water, deflecting the flow downward, which, following the Euler equations, exerts an upward force on the foil. This turning of the water creates higher pressure on the bottom of the foil and reduced pressure on the top. This pressure difference is accompanied by a velocity difference, via Bernoulli's principle, so the resulting flow field about the foil has a higher average velocity on one side than the other.\nWhen used as a lifting element on a hydrofoil boat, this upward force lifts the body of the vessel, decreasing drag and increasing speed. The lifting force eventually balances with the weight of the craft, reaching a point where the hydrofoil no longer lifts out of the water but remains in equilibrium. Since wave resistance and other impeding forces such as various types of drag (physics) on the hull are eliminated as the hull lifts clear, turbulence and drag act increasingly on the much smaller surface area of the hydrofoil, and decreasingly on the hull, creating a marked increase in speed.\nFoil configurations.\nEarly hydrofoils used V-shaped foils. Hydrofoils of this type are known as \"surface-piercing\" since portions of the V-shape hydrofoils rise above the water surface when foilborne. Some modern hydrofoils use fully submerged inverted T-shape foils. Fully submerged hydrofoils are less subject to the effects of wave action, and, therefore, more stable at sea and more comfortable for crew and passengers. This type of configuration, however, is not self-stabilizing. The angle of attack on the hydrofoils must be adjusted continuously to changing conditions, a control process performed by sensors, a computer, and active surfaces.\nHistory.\nPrototypes.\nThe first evidence of a hydrofoil on a vessel appears on a British patent granted in 1869 to Emmanuel Denis Farcot, a Parisian. He claimed that \"adapting to the sides and bottom of the vessel a series or inclined planes or wedge formed pieces, which as the vessel is driven forward will have the effect of lifting it in the water and reducing the draught.\". Italian inventor Enrico Forlanini began work on hydrofoils in 1898 and used a \"ladder\" foil system. Forlanini obtained patents in Britain and the United States for his ideas and designs.\nBetween 1899 and 1901, British boat designer John Thornycroft worked on a series of models with a stepped hull and single bow foil. In 1909 his company built the full scale long boat, \"Miranda III\". Driven by a engine, it rode on a bowfoil and flat stern. The subsequent \"Miranda IV\" was credited with a speed of .\nIn May 1904 a hydrofoil boat was described being tested on the River Seine \"in the neighbourhood of Paris\". This boat was designed by Comte de Lambert. This had 5 variable pitch fins on the hull beneath the water so inclined that when the boat begins to move \"the boat rises and the planes come to the surface\" with the result that \"it skims over the surface with little but the propellers beneath the surface\". The boat had twin hulls 18-foot long connected by a single deck 9-foot wide, and was fitted with a 14HP De Dion-Bouton motor, the boat was reported to have reached 20\u00a0mph. It was stated that \"The boat running practically on its fins resembles an aeroplane\".\nA March 1906 Scientific American article by American hydrofoil pioneer William E. Meacham explained the basic principle of hydrofoils. Alexander Graham Bell considered the invention of the hydroplane (now regarded as a distinct type, but also employing lift) a very significant achievement, and after reading the article began to sketch concepts of what is now called a hydrofoil boat. With his chief engineer Casey Baldwin, Bell began hydrofoil experiments in the summer of 1908. Baldwin studied the work of the Italian inventor Enrico Forlanini and began testing models based on those designs, which led to the development of hydrofoil watercraft. During Bell's world tour of 1910\u20131911, Bell and Baldwin met with Forlanini in Italy, where they rode in his hydrofoil boat over Lake Maggiore. Baldwin described it as being as smooth as flying.\nOn returning to Bell's large laboratory at his Beinn Bhreagh estate near Baddeck, Nova Scotia, they experimented with a number of designs, culminating in Bell's \"HD-4\". Using Renault engines, a top speed of was achieved, accelerating rapidly, taking waves without difficulty, steering well and showing good stability. Bell's report to the United States Navy permitted him to obtain two engines. On 9 September 1919 the \"HD-4\" set a world marine speed record of , which stood for two decades. A full-scale replica of the \"HD-4\" is viewable at the Alexander Graham Bell National Historic Site museum in Baddeck, Nova Scotia.\nIn the early 1950s an English couple built the \"White Hawk\", a jet-powered hydrofoil water craft, in an attempt to beat the absolute water speed record. However, in tests, \"White Hawk\" could barely top the record breaking speed of the 1919 \"HD-4\". The designers had faced an engineering phenomenon that limits the top speed of even modern hydrofoils: cavitation disturbs the lift created by the foils as they move through the water at speed above , bending the lifting foil.\nFirst passenger boats.\nGerman engineer Hanns von Schertel worked on hydrofoils prior to and during World War II in Germany. After the war, the Russians captured Schertel's team. As Germany was not authorized to build fast boats, Schertel went to Switzerland, where he established the Supramar company. In 1952, Supramar launched the first commercial hydrofoil, PT10 \"Freccia d'Oro\" (Golden Arrow), in Lake Maggiore, between Switzerland and Italy. The PT10 is of surface-piercing type, it can carry 32 passengers and travel at . In 1968, the Bahraini born banker Hussain Najadi acquired the Supramar AG and expanded its operations into Japan, Hong Kong, Singapore, the UK, Norway and the US. General Dynamics of the United States became its licensee, and the Pentagon awarded its first R&amp;D naval research project in the field of supercavitation. Hitachi Shipbuilding of Osaka, Japan, was another licensee of Supramar, as well as many leading ship owners and shipyards in the OECD countries.\nFrom 1952 to 1971, Supramar designed many models of hydrofoils: PT20, PT50, PT75, PT100 and PT150. All are of surface-piercing type, except the PT150 combining a surface-piercing foil forward with a fully submerged foil in the aft location. Over 200 of Supramar's design were built, most of them by Rodriquez (headed at the time by Engineer Carlo Rodriquez in Sicily, Italy.\nDuring the same period the Soviet Union experimented extensively with hydrofoils, constructing hydrofoil river boats and ferries with streamlined designs during the cold war period and into the 1980s. Such vessels include the Raketa (1957) type, followed by the larger Meteor type and the smaller Voskhod type. One of the most successful Soviet designer/inventor in this area was Rostislav Alexeyev, who some consider the 'father' of the modern hydrofoil due to his 1950s era high speed hydrofoil designs. Later, circa 1970s, Alexeyev combined his hydrofoil experience with the surface effect principle to create the Ekranoplan. Extensive investment in this type of technology in the USSR resulted in the largest civil hydrofoil fleet in the world and the making of the Meteor type, the most successful hydrofoil in history, with more than 400 units built.\nIn 1961, SRI International issued a study on \"The Economic Feasibility of Passenger Hydrofoil Craft in US Domestic and Foreign Commerce\". Commercial use of hydrofoils in the US first appeared in 1961 when two commuter vessels were commissioned by Harry Gale Nye, Jr.'s North American Hydrofoils to service the route from Atlantic Highlands, New Jersey to the financial district of Lower Manhattan.\nMilitary usage.\nGermany.\nA 17-ton German craft \"VS-6 Hydrofoil\" was designed and constructed in 1940, completed in 1941 for use as a mine layer; it was tested in the Baltic Sea, producing speeds of 47 knots. Tested against a standard E-boat over the next three years it performed well but was not brought into production. Being faster it could carry a higher payload and was capable of travelling over minefields but was prone to damage and noisier.\nCanada.\nIn Canada during World War II, Baldwin worked on an experimental smoke laying hydrofoil (later called the Comox Torpedo) that was later superseded by other smoke-laying technology and an experimental target-towing hydrofoil. The forward two foil assemblies of what is believed to be the latter hydrofoil were salvaged in the mid-1960s from a derelict hulk in Baddeck, Nova Scotia by Colin MacGregor Stevens. These were donated to the Maritime Museum in Halifax, Nova Scotia.\nThe Canadian Armed Forces built and tested a number of hydrofoils (e.g., Baddeck and two vessels named \"Bras d'Or\"), which culminated in the high-speed anti-submarine hydrofoil HMCS \"Bras d'Or\" in the late 1960s. However, the program was cancelled in the early 1970s due to a shift away from anti-submarine warfare by the Canadian military. The \"Bras d'Or\" was a surface-piercing type that performed well during her trials, reaching a maximum speed of .\nSoviet Union.\nThe USSR introduced several hydrofoil-based fast attack craft into their navy, principally:\nUnited States.\nThe US Navy began experiments with hydrofoils in the mid-1950s by funding a sailing vessel that used hydrofoils to reach speeds in the 30\u00a0mph range. The \"XCH-4\" (officially, \"Experimental Craft, Hydrofoil No. 4\"), designed by William P. Carl, exceeded speeds of and was mistaken for a seaplane due to its shape. \"Halobates\" was a 1957 US Navy prototype hydrofoil boat built by Miami Shipbuilding.\nThe US Navy implemented a small number of combat hydrofoils, such as the \"Pegasus\" class, from 1977 through 1993. These hydrofoils were fast and well armed.\nItaly.\nThe Italian Navy used six hydrofoils of the \"Sparviero\" class starting in the late 1970s. These were armed with a 76\u00a0mm gun and two missiles, and were capable of speeds up to . Three similar boats were built for the Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force.\nSailing and sports.\nSeveral editions of the America's Cup have been raced with foiling yachts. The 2013 and 2017 editions used the AC72 and AC50 classes of catamaran respectively, and the 2021 edition used the AC75 class of foiling monohulls with canting arms.\nThe French experimental sail-powered hydrofoil \"Hydropt\u00e8re\" is the result of a research project that involves advanced engineering skills and technologies. In September 2009, the \"Hydropt\u00e8re\" set new sailcraft world speed records in the 500\u00a0m category, with a speed of and in the category with a speed of .\nThe 500\u00a0m speed record for sailboats is currently held by the \"Vestas Sailrocket\", an exotic design which operates in effect as a hydrofoil.\nAnother trimaran sailboat is the Windrider Rave. The Rave is a commercially available , two person, hydrofoil trimaran, capable of reaching speeds of . The boat was designed by Jim Brown.\nThe Moth dinghy has evolved into some radical foil configurations.\nHobie Sailboats produced a production foiling trimaran, the Hobie Trifoiler, the fastest production sailboat. Trifoilers have clocked speeds upward of thirty knots.\nA new kayak design, called Flyak, has hydrofoils that lift the kayak enough to significantly reduce drag, allowing speeds of up to . Some surfers have developed surfboards with hydrofoils called foilboards, specifically aimed at surfing big waves further out to sea.\nQuadrofoil Q2 is a two-seater, four-foiled hydrofoil electrical leisure watercraft. Its initial design was set in 2012 and it has been available commercially since the end of 2016. Powered by a 5.2-kWh lithium-ion battery pack and propelled by a 5.5\u00a0kW motor, it reaches the top speed of 40\u00a0km/h and has 80\u00a0km of range.\nThe Manta5 Hydrofoiler XE-1 is a Hydrofoil E-bike, designed and built in New Zealand that has since been available commercially for pre-order since late 2017. Propelled by a 400 watt motor, it can reach speeds exceeding 14\u00a0km/h with a weight of 22\u00a0kg. A single charge of the battery lasts an hour for a rider weighing 85\u00a0kg.\nCandela, a Swedish company, is producing a recreational hydrofoil powerboat, making strong claims for efficiency, performance, and range.\nHydrofoils are now widely used with kitesurfing, that is traction kites over water. Hydrofoils are a new trend in windsurfing - including the new Summer Olympic class, the IQFoil, and more recently with Wing foiling, which are essentially a kite with no strings, or a hand-held sail.\nModern passenger boats.\nSoviet-built Voskhods are one of the most successful passenger hydrofoil designs. Manufactured in Soviet and later Ukrainian Crimea, they are in service in more than 20 countries. The most recent model, Voskhod-2M FFF, also known as Eurofoil, was built in Feodosiya for the Dutch public transport operator Connexxion.\nMid-2010s saw a Russian governmental program aimed at restoring passenger hydrofoil production. The Kometa 120M, based on the earlier Kometa, Kolhida and Katran models, became the first to enter production, initially on Vympel factory in Rybinsk, and later on More shipyard in Feodosiya. Since 2018, the ships are running Sevastopol-Yalta and Sochi-Gelenzhik-Novorossiysk, with a Sevastopol-Sochi connection in the immediate plans in 2021. At the same time, the Alekseyev Bureau began building lighter, smaller Valday 45R hydrofoils, based on a widely successful Polesye model, at its own plant in Nizhny Novgorod, the relatively shallow-draft boats used on the Ob and the Volga. The Meteor 120R, a development of the Meteor, became the Valday's larger sibling, the first ship launched in Nizhny Novgorod in August 2021.\nThe Boeing 929 is widely used in Asia for passenger services, between Hong Kong and Macau and between the many islands of Japan. It was also used between Kyushu of Japan and Korean peninsula. Hong Kong ferry company TurboJET was the main user of Boeing 929.\nCurrent operation.\nCurrent operators of hydrofoils include:\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Both his siblings died during the war. One was shot by a German soldier the day after an armistice was declared in Paris, the other while sabotaging a train.\nChopin was a French practitioner of concrete and sound poetry, well known throughout the second half of the 20th century. His work, though iconoclastic, remained well within the historical spectrum of poetry as it moved from a spoken tradition to the printed word and now back to the spoken word again. He created a large body of pioneering recordings using early tape recorders, studio technologies and the sounds of the manipulated human voice. His emphasis on sound is a reminder that language stems as much from oral traditions as from classic literature, of the relationship of balance between order and chaos.\nChopin is significant above all for his diverse spread of creative achievement, as well as for his position as a focal point of contact for the international arts. As poet, painter, graphic artist and designer, typographer, independent publisher, filmmaker, broadcaster and arts promoter, Chopin's work is a barometer of the shifts in European media between the 1950s and the 1970s.\nIn 1966 he was with Gustav Metzger, Otto Muehl, Wolf Vostell, Peter Weibel and others a participant of the Destruction in Art Symposium (\"DIAS\") in London.\nIn 1964 he created \"OU\", one of the most notable reviews of the second half of the 20th century, and he ran it until 1974. \"OU\"'s contributors included William S. Burroughs, Brion Gysin, Gil J. Wolman, Fran\u00e7ois Dufr\u00eane, Bernard Heidsieck, John Furnival, Tom Phillips, and the Austrian sculptor, writer and Dada pioneer Raoul Hausmann.\nHis books included \"Le Dernier Roman du Monde\" (1971), \"Portrait des 9\" (1975), \"The Cosmographical Lobster\" (1976), \"Po\u00e9sie Sonore Internationale\" (1979), \"Les Riches Heures de l'Alphabet\" (1992) and \"Graphpoemesmachine\" (2006). Henri also created many graphic works on his typewriter: the typewriter poems (also known as dactylopo\u00e8mes) feature in international art collections such as those of Francesco Conz in Verona, the Morra Foundation in Naples and Ruth and Marvin Sackner in Miami, and have been the subject of Australian, British and French retrospectives.\nHis publication and design of the classic audio-visual magazines \"Cinqui\u00e8me Saison\" and \"OU\" between 1958 and 1974, each issue containing recordings as well as texts, images, screenprints and multiples, brought together international contemporary writers and artists such as members of Lettrisme and Fluxus, Jiri Kolar, Ian Hamilton Finlay, Tom Phillips, Brion Gysin, William S. Burroughs and many others, as well as bringing the work of survivors from earlier generations such as Raoul Hausmann and Marcel Janco to a fresh audience.\nFrom 1968 to 1986 Henri Chopin lived in Ingatestone, Essex, but with the death of his wife Jean in 1985, he moved back to France.\nIn 2001 with his health failing, he returned to England, living with his daughter and family at Dereham, Norfolk until his death on 3 January 2008.\nAesthetics.\nChopin's \"poesie sonore\" aesthetics included a deliberate cultivation of a \"barbarian\" approach in production, using raw or crude sound manipulations to explore the area between\ndistortion and intelligibility. He avoided high-quality, professional recording machines, preferring to use very basic equipment and \"bricolage\" methods, such as sticking matchsticks in the erase heads of a second-hand tape recorder, or manually interfering with the tape path.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "13764", "revid": "7903804", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=13764", "title": "Hassium", "text": "element with atomic number 108 (Hs)\nHassium is a synthetic chemical element; it has symbol Hs and atomic number 108. It is highly radioactive: its most stable known isotopes have half-lives of about ten seconds. One of its isotopes, 270Hs, has magic numbers of protons and neutrons for deformed nuclei, giving it greater stability against spontaneous fission. Hassium is a superheavy element; it has been produced in a laboratory in very small quantities by fusing heavy nuclei with lighter ones. Natural occurrences of hassium have been hypothesized but never found.\nIn the periodic table, hassium is a transactinide element, a member of period 7 and group 8; it is thus the sixth member of the 6d series of transition metals. Chemistry experiments have confirmed that hassium behaves as the heavier homologue to osmium, reacting readily with oxygen to form a volatile tetroxide. The chemical properties of hassium have been only partly characterized, but they compare well with the chemistry of the other group 8 elements.\nThe main innovation that led to the discovery of hassium was cold fusion, where the fused nuclei do not differ by mass as much as in earlier techniques. It relied on greater stability of target nuclei, which in turn decreased excitation energy. This decreased the number of neutrons ejected during synthesis, creating heavier, more stable resulting nuclei. The technique was first tested at Joint Institute for Nuclear Research (JINR) in Dubna, Moscow Oblast, Russian SFSR, Soviet Union, in 1974. JINR used this technique to attempt synthesis of element 108 in 1978, in 1983, and in 1984; the latter experiment resulted in a claim that element 108 had been produced. Later in 1984, a synthesis claim followed from the Gesellschaft f\u00fcr Schwerionenforschung (GSI) in Darmstadt, Hesse, West Germany. The 1993 report by the Transfermium Working Group, formed by the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) and the International Union of Pure and Applied Physics (IUPAP), concluded that the report from Darmstadt was conclusive on its own whereas that from Dubna was not, and major credit was assigned to the German scientists. GSI formally announced they wished to name the element \"hassium\" after the German state of Hesse (Hassia in Latin), home to the facility in 1992; this name was accepted as final in 1997.\nDiscovery.\nCold fusion.\nNuclear reactions used in the 1960s resulted in high excitation energies that required expulsion of four or five neutrons; these reactions used targets made of elements with high atomic numbers to maximize the size difference between the two nuclei in a reaction. While this increased the chance of fusion due to the lower electrostatic repulsion between target and projectile, the formed compound nuclei often broke apart and did not survive to form a new element. Moreover, fusion inevitably produces neutron-poor nuclei, as heavier elements need more neutrons per proton for stability; therefore, the necessary ejection of neutrons results in final products that are typically shorter-lived. As such, light beams (six to ten protons) allowed synthesis of elements only up to 106.\nTo advance to heavier elements, Soviet physicist Yuri Oganessian at Joint Institute for Nuclear Research (JINR) in Dubna, Moscow Oblast, Russian SFSR, Soviet Union, proposed a different mechanism, in which the bombarded nucleus would be lead-208, which has magic numbers of protons and neutrons, or another nucleus close to it. Each proton and neutron has a fixed rest energy; those of all protons are equal and so are those of all neutrons. In a nucleus, some of this energy is diverted to binding protons and neutrons; if a nucleus has a magic number of protons and/or neutrons, then even more of its rest energy is diverted, which makes the nuclide more stable. This additional stability requires more energy for an external nucleus to break the existing one and penetrate it. More energy diverted to binding nucleons means less rest energy, which in turn means less mass (mass is proportional to rest energy). More equal atomic numbers of the reacting nuclei result in greater electrostatic repulsion between them, but the lower mass excess of the target nucleus balances it. This leaves less excitation energy for the new compound nucleus, which necessitates fewer neutron ejections to reach a stable state. Due to this energy difference, the former mechanism became known as \"hot fusion\" and the latter as \"cold fusion\".\nCold fusion was first declared successful in 1974 at JINR, when it was tested for synthesis of the yet-undiscovered element106. These new nuclei were projected to decay via spontaneous fission. The physicists at JINR concluded element 106 was produced in the experiment because no fissioning nucleus known at the time showed parameters of fission similar to what was observed during the experiment and because changing either of the two nuclei in the reactions negated the observed effects. Physicists at Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory (LBL; originally Radiation Laboratory, RL, and later Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, LBNL) of the University of California in Berkeley, California, United States, also expressed great interest in the new technique. When asked about how far this new method could go and if lead targets were a physics' Klondike, Oganessian responded, \"Klondike may be an exaggeration [...] But soon, we will try to get elements 107... 108 in these reactions.\"\nReports.\nSynthesis of element108 was first attempted in 1978 by a team led by Oganessian at JINR. The team used a reaction that would generate element108, specifically, the isotope 270108, from fusion of radium (specifically, the isotope and calcium . The researchers were uncertain in interpreting their data, and their paper did not unambiguously claim to have discovered the element. The same year, another team at JINR investigated the possibility of synthesis of element108 in reactions between lead and iron ; they were uncertain in interpreting the data, suggesting the possibility that element108 had not been created.\nIn 1983, new experiments were performed at JINR. The experiments probably resulted in the synthesis of element108; bismuth was bombarded with manganese to obtain 263108, lead (207, 208Pb) was bombarded with iron (58Fe) to obtain 264108, and californium was bombarded with neon to obtain 270108. These experiments were not claimed as a discovery and Oganessian announced them in a conference rather than in a written report.\nIn 1984, JINR researchers in Dubna performed experiments set up identically to the previous ones; they bombarded bismuth and lead targets with ions of manganese and iron, respectively. Twenty-one spontaneous fission events were recorded; the researchers concluded they were caused by 264108.\nLater in 1984, a research team led by Peter Armbruster and Gottfried M\u00fcnzenberg at Gesellschaft f\u00fcr Schwerionenforschung (GSI; \"Institute for Heavy Ion Research\") in Darmstadt, Hesse, West Germany, tried to create element108. The team bombarded a lead (208Pb) target with accelerated iron (58Fe) nuclei. GSI's experiment to create element108 was delayed until after their creation of element109 in 1982, as prior calculations had suggested that even\u2013even isotopes of element108 would have spontaneous fission half-lives of less than one microsecond, making them difficult to detect and identify. The element108 experiment finally went ahead after 266109 had been synthesized and was found to decay by alpha emission, suggesting that isotopes of element108 would do likewise, and this was corroborated by an experiment aimed at synthesizing isotopes of element106. GSI reported synthesis of three atoms of 265108. Two years later, they reported synthesis of one atom of the even\u2013even 264108.\nArbitration.\nIn 1985, the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) and the International Union of Pure and Applied Physics (IUPAP) formed the Transfermium Working Group (TWG) to assess discoveries and establish final names for elements with atomic numbers greater than 100. The party held meetings with delegates from the three competing institutes; in 1990, they established criteria for recognition of an element and in 1991, they finished the work of assessing discoveries and disbanded. These results were published in 1993.\nAccording to the report, the 1984 works from JINR and GSI simultaneously and independently established synthesis of element108. Of the two 1984 works, the one from GSI was said to be sufficient as a discovery on its own. The JINR work, which preceded the GSI one, \"very probably\" displayed synthesis of element108. However, that was determined in retrospect given the work from Darmstadt; the JINR work focused on chemically identifying remote granddaughters of element108 isotopes (which could not exclude the possibility that these daughter isotopes had other progenitors), while the GSI work clearly identified the decay path of those element108 isotopes. The report concluded that the major credit should be awarded to GSI. In written responses to this ruling, both JINR and GSI agreed with its conclusions. In the same response, GSI confirmed that they and JINR were able to resolve all conflicts between them.\nNaming.\nHistorically, a newly discovered element was named by its discoverer. The first regulation came in 1947, when IUPAC decided naming required regulation in case there are conflicting names. These matters were to be resolved by the Commission of Inorganic Nomenclature and the Commission of Atomic Weights. They would review the names in case of a conflict and select one; the decision would be based on a number of factors, such as usage, and would not be an indicator of priority of a claim. The two commissions would recommend a name to the IUPAC Council, which would be the final authority. The discoverers held the right to name an element, but their name would be subject to approval by IUPAC. The Commission of Atomic Weights distanced itself from element naming in most cases.\nIn Mendeleev's nomenclature for unnamed and undiscovered elements, hassium would be called \"eka-osmium\", as in \"the first element below osmium in the periodic table\" (from Sanskrit \"eka\" meaning \"one\"). In 1979, IUPAC published recommendations according to which the element was to be called \"unniloctium\" (symbol \"Uno\"), a systematic element name as a placeholder until the element was discovered and the discovery then confirmed, and a permanent name was decided. Although these recommendations were widely followed in the chemical community, the competing physicists in the field ignored them. They either called it \"element108\", with the symbols \"E108\", \"(108)\" or \"108\", or used the proposed name \"hassium\".\nIn 1990, in an attempt to break a deadlock in establishing priority of discovery and naming of several elements, IUPAC reaffirmed in its nomenclature of inorganic chemistry that after existence of an element was established, the discoverers could propose a name. (Also, the Commission of Atomic Weights was excluded from the naming process.) The first publication on criteria for an element discovery, released in 1991, specified the need for recognition by TWG.\nArmbruster and his colleagues, the officially recognized German discoverers, held a naming ceremony for the elements 107 through 109, which had all been recognized as discovered by GSI, on 7September 1992. For element108, the scientists proposed the name \"hassium\". It is derived from the Latin name \"Hassia\" for the German state of Hesse where the institute is located. This name was proposed to IUPAC in a written response to their ruling on priority of discovery claims of elements, signed 29 September 1992.\nThe process of naming of element 108 was a part of a larger process of naming a number of elements starting with element 101; three teams\u2014JINR, GSI, and LBL\u2014claimed discovery of several elements and the right to name those elements. Sometimes, these claims clashed; since a discoverer was considered entitled to naming of an element, conflicts over priority of discovery often resulted in conflicts over names of these new elements. These conflicts became known as the Transfermium Wars. Different suggestions to name the whole set of elements from 101 onward and they occasionally assigned names suggested by one team to be used for elements discovered by another. However, not all suggestions were met with equal approval; the teams openly protested naming proposals on several occasions.\nIn 1994, IUPAC Commission on Nomenclature of Inorganic Chemistry recommended that element108 be named \"hahnium\" (Hn) after German physicist Otto Hahn so elements named after Hahn and Lise Meitner (it was recommended element109 should be named meitnerium, following GSI's suggestion) would be next to each other, honouring their joint discovery of nuclear fission; IUPAC commented that they felt the German suggestion was obscure. GSI protested, saying this proposal contradicted the long-standing convention of giving the discoverer the right to suggest a name; the American Chemical Society supported GSI. The name \"hahnium\", albeit with the different symbol Ha, had already been proposed and used by the American scientists for element105, for which they had a discovery dispute with JINR; they thus protested the confusing scrambling of names. Following the uproar, IUPAC formed an ad hoc committee of representatives from the national adhering organizations of the three countries home to the competing institutions; they produced a new set of names in 1995. Element108 was again named \"hahnium\"; this proposal was also retracted. The final compromise was reached in 1996 and published in 1997; element108 was named \"hassium\" (Hs). Simultaneously, the name \"dubnium\" (Db; from Dubna, the JINR location) was assigned to element105, and the name \"hahnium\" was not used for any element.\nThe official justification for this naming, alongside that of darmstadtium for element110, was that it completed a set of geographic names for the location of the GSI; this set had been initiated by 19th-century names europium and germanium. This set would serve as a response to earlier naming of americium, californium, and berkelium for elements discovered in Berkeley. Armbruster commented on this, \"this bad tradition was established by Berkeley. We wanted to do it for Europe.\" Later, when commenting on the naming of element112, Armbruster said, \"I did everything to ensure that we do not continue with German scientists and German towns.\"\nIsotopes.\nHassium has no stable or naturally occurring isotopes. Several radioisotopes have been synthesized in the lab, either by fusing two atoms or by observing the decay of heavier elements. As of 2019, the quantity of all hassium ever produced was on the order of hundreds of atoms. Thirteen isotopes with mass numbers 263 through 277 (except for 274 and 276) have been reported, six of which\u2014265, 266, 267, 269, 271, 277Hs\u2014have known metastable states, though that of 277Hs is unconfirmed. Most of these isotopes decay mainly through alpha decay; this is the most common for all isotopes for which comprehensive decay characteristics are available; the only exception is 277Hs, which undergoes spontaneous fission. Lighter isotopes were usually synthesized by direct fusion of two nuclei, whereas heavier isotopes were typically observed as decay products of nuclei with larger atomic numbers.\nAtomic nuclei have well-established nuclear shells, which make nuclei more stable. If a nucleus has certain numbers (magic numbers) of protons or neutrons, that complete a nuclear shell, then the nucleus is even more stable against decay. The highest known magic numbers are 82 for protons and 126 for neutrons. This notion is sometimes expanded to include additional numbers between those magic numbers, which also provide some additional stability and indicate closure of \"sub-shells\". Unlike the better-known lighter nuclei, superheavy nuclei are deformed. Until the 1960s, the liquid drop model was the dominant explanation for nuclear structure. It suggested that the fission barrier would disappear for nuclei with ~280nucleons. It was thus thought that spontaneous fission would occur nearly instantly before nuclei could form a structure that could stabilize them; it appeared that nuclei with Z\u2248103 were too heavy to exist for a considerable length of time.\nThe later nuclear shell model suggested that nuclei with ~300 nucleons would form an island of stability where nuclei will be more resistant to spontaneous fission and will mainly undergo alpha decay with longer half-lives, and the next doubly magic nucleus (having magic numbers of both protons and neutrons) is expected to lie in the center of the island of stability near \"Z\"=110\u2013114 and the predicted magic neutron number \"N\"=184. Subsequent discoveries suggested that the predicted island might be further than originally anticipated. They also showed that nuclei intermediate between the long-lived actinides and the predicted island are deformed, and gain additional stability from shell effects, against alpha decay and especially against spontaneous fission. The center of the region on a chart of nuclides that would correspond to this stability for deformed nuclei was determined as 270Hs, with 108 expected to be a magic number for protons for deformed nuclei\u2014nuclei that are far from spherical\u2014and 162 a magic number for neutrons for such nuclei. Experiments on lighter superheavy nuclei, as well as those closer to the expected island, have shown greater than previously anticipated stability against spontaneous fission, showing the importance of shell effects on nuclei.\nTheoretical models predict a region of instability for some hassium isotopes to lie around \"A\"=275 and \"N\"=168\u2013170, which is between the predicted neutron shell closures at \"N\"=162 for deformed nuclei and \"N\"=184 for spherical nuclei. Nuclides in this region are predicted to have low fission barrier heights, resulting in short partial half-lives toward spontaneous fission. This prediction is supported by the observed 11-millisecond half-life of 277Hs and the 5-millisecond half-life of the neighbouring isobar 277Mt because the hindrance factors from the odd nucleon were shown to be much lower than otherwise expected. The measured half-lives are even lower than those originally predicted for the even\u2013even 276Hs and 278Ds, which suggests a gap in stability away from the shell closures and perhaps a weakening of the shell closures in this region.\nIn 1991, Polish physicists Zygmunt Patyk and Adam Sobiczewski predicted that 108 is a proton magic number for deformed nuclei and 162 is a neutron magic number for such nuclei. This means such nuclei are permanently deformed in their ground state but have high, narrow fission barriers to further deformation and hence relatively long spontaneous-fission half-lives. Computational prospects for shell stabilization for 270Hs made it a promising candidate for a deformed doubly magic nucleus. Experimental data is scarce, but the existing data is interpreted by the researchers to support the assignment of \"N\"=162 as a magic number. In particular, this conclusion was drawn from the decay data of 269Hs, 270Hs, and 271Hs. In 1997, Polish physicist Robert Smola\u0144czuk calculated that the isotope 292Hs may be the most stable superheavy nucleus against alpha decay and spontaneous fission as a consequence of the predicted \"N\"=184 shell closure.\nNatural occurrence.\nHassium is not known to occur naturally on Earth; all its known isotopes are so short-lived that no primordial hassium would survive to today. This does not rule out the possibility of unknown, longer-lived isotopes or nuclear isomers, some of which could still exist in trace quantities if they are long-lived enough. As early as 1914, German physicist Richard Swinne proposed element108 as a source of X-rays in the Greenland ice sheet. Though Swinne was unable to verify this observation and thus did not claim discovery, he proposed in 1931 the existence of \"regions\" of long-lived transuranic elements, including one around \"Z\"=108.\nIn 1963, Soviet geologist and physicist Viktor Cherdyntsev, who had previously claimed the existence of primordial curium-247, claimed to have discovered element108\u2014specifically the 267108 isotope, which supposedly had a half-life of 400 to 500million years\u2014in natural molybdenite and suggested the provisional name \"sergenium\" (symbol Sg); this name comes from the name for the Silk Road and was explained as \"coming from Kazakhstan\" for it. His rationale for claiming that sergenium was the heavier homologue to osmium was that minerals supposedly containing sergenium formed volatile oxides when boiled in nitric acid, similarly to osmium.\nSoviet physicist Vladimir Kulakov criticized Cherdyntsev's findings on the grounds that some of the properties Cherdyntsev claimed sergenium had, were inconsistent with then-current nuclear physics. The chief questions Kulakov raised were that the claimed alpha decay energy of sergenium was many orders of magnitude lower than expected and the half-life given was eight orders of magnitude shorter than what would be predicted for a nuclide alpha-decaying with the claimed decay energy. At the same time, a corrected half-life in the region of 1016years would be impossible because it would imply the samples contained ~100 milligrams of sergenium. In 2003, it was suggested that the observed alpha decay with energy 4.5MeV could be due to a low-energy and strongly enhanced transition between different hyperdeformed states of a hassium isotope around 271Hs, thus suggesting that the existence of superheavy elements in nature was at least possible, but unlikely.\nIn 2006, Russian geologist Alexei Ivanov hypothesized that an isomer of 271Hs might have a half-life of ~ years, which would explain the observation of alpha particles with energies of ~4.4MeV in some samples of molybdenite and osmiridium. This isomer of 271Hs could be produced from the beta decay of 271Bh and 271Sg, which, being homologous to rhenium and molybdenum respectively, should occur in molybdenite along with rhenium and molybdenum if they occurred in nature. Because hassium is homologous to osmium, it should occur along with osmium in osmiridium if it occurs in nature. The decay chains of 271Bh and 271Sg are hypothetical and the predicted half-life of this hypothetical hassium isomer is not long enough for any sufficient quantity to remain on Earth. It is possible that more 271Hs may be deposited on the Earth as the Solar System travels through the spiral arms of the Milky Way; this would explain excesses of plutonium-239 found on the ocean floors of the Pacific Ocean and the Gulf of Finland. However, minerals enriched with 271Hs are predicted to have excesses of its daughters uranium-235 and lead-207; they would also have different proportions of elements that are formed by spontaneous fission, such as krypton, zirconium, and xenon. The natural occurrence of hassium in minerals such as molybdenite and osmiride is theoretically possible, but very unlikely.\nIn 2004, JINR started a search for natural hassium in the Modane Underground Laboratory in Modane, Auvergne-Rh\u00f4ne-Alpes, France; this was done underground to avoid interference and false positives from cosmic rays. In 2008\u201309, an experiment run in the laboratory resulted in detection of several registered events of neutron multiplicity (number of emitted free neutrons after a nucleus is hit by a neutron and fissioned) above three in natural osmium, and in 2012\u201313, these findings were reaffirmed in another experiment run in the laboratory. These results hinted natural hassium could potentially exist in nature in amounts that allow its detection by the means of analytical chemistry, but this conclusion is based on an explicit assumption that there is a long-lived hassium isotope to which the registered events could be attributed.\nSince 292Hs may be particularly stable against alpha decay and spontaneous fission, it was considered as a candidate to exist in nature. This nuclide, however, is predicted to be very unstable toward beta decay and any beta-stable isotopes of hassium such as 286Hs would be too unstable in the other decay channels to be observed in nature. A 2012 search for 292Hs in nature along with its homologue osmium at the Maier-Leibnitz Laboratory in Garching, Bavaria, Germany, was unsuccessful, setting an upper limit to its abundance at of hassium per gram of osmium.\nPredicted properties.\nVarious calculations suggest hassium should be the heaviest group\u00a08 element so far, consistently with the periodic law. Its properties should generally match those expected for a heavier homologue of osmium; as is the case for all transactinides, a few deviations are expected to arise from relativistic effects.\nVery few properties of hassium or its compounds have been measured; this is due to its extremely limited and expensive production and the fact that hassium (and its parents) decays very quickly. A few singular chemistry-related properties have been measured, such as enthalpy of adsorption of hassium tetroxide, but properties of hassium metal remain unknown and only predictions are available.\nRelativistic effects.\nRelativistic effects in hassium should arise due to the high charge of its nuclei, which causes the electrons around the nucleus to move faster\u2014so fast their speed is comparable to the speed of light. There are three main effects: the direct relativistic effect, the indirect relativistic effect, and spin\u2013orbit splitting. (The existing calculations do not account for Breit interactions, but those are negligible, and their omission can only result in an uncertainty of the current calculations of no more than 2%.)\nAs atomic number increases, so does the electrostatic attraction between an electron and the nucleus. This causes the velocity of the electron to increase, which leads to an increase in its mass. This in turn leads to contraction of the atomic orbitals, most specifically the s and p1/2 orbitals. Their electrons become more closely attached to the atom and harder to pull from the nucleus. This is the direct relativistic effect. It was originally thought to be strong only for the innermost electrons, but was later established to significantly influence valence electrons as well.\nSince the s and p1/2 orbitals are closer to the nucleus, they take a bigger portion of the electric charge of the nucleus on themselves (\"shield\" it). This leaves less charge for attraction of the remaining electrons, whose orbitals therefore expand, making them easier to pull from the nucleus. This is the indirect relativistic effect. As a result of the combination of the direct and indirect relativistic effects, the Hs+ ion, compared to the neutral atom, lacks a 6d electron, rather than a 7s electron. In comparison, Os+ lacks a 6s electron compared to the neutral atom. The ionic radius (in oxidation state +8) of hassium is greater than that of osmium because of the relativistic expansion of the 6p3/2 orbitals, which are the outermost orbitals for an Hs8+ ion (although in practice such highly charged ions would be too polarized in chemical environments to have much reality).\nThere are several kinds of electron orbitals, denoted s, p, d, and f (g orbitals are expected to start being chemically active among elements after element 120). Each of these corresponds to an azimuthal quantum number \"l\": s to 0, p to 1, d to 2, and f to 3. Every electron also corresponds to a spin quantum number \"s\", which may equal either +1/2 or \u22121/2. Thus, the total angular momentum quantum number \"j = l\" + \"s\" is equal to \"j\" = \"l\" \u00b1 1/2 (except for \"l\" = 0, for which for both electrons in each orbital \"j =\" 0 + 1/2 = 1/2). Spin of an electron relativistically interacts with its orbit, and this interaction leads to a split of a subshell into two with different energies (the one with \"j\" = \"l\" \u2212 1/2 is lower in energy and thus these electrons more difficult to extract): for instance, of the six 6p electrons, two become 6p1/2 and four become 6p3/2. This is the spin\u2013orbit splitting (also called subshell splitting or \"jj\" coupling). It is most visible with p electrons, which do not play an important role in the chemistry of hassium, but those for d and f electrons are within the same order of magnitude (quantitatively, spin\u2013orbit splitting in expressed in energy units, such as electronvolts).\nThese relativistic effects are responsible for the expected increase of the ionization energy, decrease of the electron affinity, and increase of stability of the +8 oxidation state compared to osmium; without them, the trends would be reversed. Relativistic effects decrease the atomization energies of hassium compounds because the spin\u2013orbit splitting of the d orbital lowers binding energy between electrons and the nucleus and because relativistic effects decrease ionic character in bonding.\nPhysical and atomic.\nThe previous members of group8 have high melting points: Fe, 1538\u00b0C; Ru, 2334\u00b0C; Os, 3033\u00b0C. Like them, hassium is predicted to be a solid at room temperature though its melting point has not been precisely calculated. Hassium should crystallize in the hexagonal close-packed structure (\"c\"/\"a\"=1.59), similarly to its lighter congener osmium. Pure metallic hassium is calculated to have a bulk modulus (resistance to uniform compression) of 450GPa, comparable with that of diamond, 442GPa. Hassium is expected to be one of the densest of the 118 known elements, with a predicted density of 27\u201329\u00a0g/cm3 vs. the 22.59\u00a0g/cm3 measured for osmium.\nHassium's atomic radius is expected to be \u2248126pm. Due to relativistic stabilization of the 7s orbital and destabilization of the 6d orbital, the Hs+ ion is predicted to have an electron configuration of [Rn]5f146d57s2, giving up a 6d electron instead of a 7s electron, which is the opposite of the behaviour of its lighter homologues. The Hs2+ ion is expected to have electron configuration [Rn]5f146d57s1, analogous to that calculated for the Os2+ ion. In chemical compounds, hassium is calculated to display bonding characteristic for a d-block element, whose bonding will be primarily executed by 6d3/2 and 6d5/2 orbitals; compared to the elements from the previous periods, 7s, 6p1/2, 6p3/2, and 7p1/2 orbitals should be more important.\nChemical.\nHassium is the sixth member of the 6d series of transition metals and is expected to be much like the platinum group metals. Some of these properties were confirmed by gas-phase chemistry experiments. The group8 elements portray a wide variety of oxidation states but ruthenium and osmium readily portray their group oxidation state of +8; this state becomes more stable down the group. This oxidation state is extremely rare: among stable elements, only ruthenium, osmium, and xenon are able to attain it in reasonably stable compounds. Hassium is expected to follow its congeners and have a stable +8 state, but like them it should show lower stable oxidation states such as +6, +4, +3, and +2. Hassium(IV) is expected to be more stable than hassium(VIII) in aqueous solution. Hassium should be a rather noble metal. The standard reduction potential for the Hs4+/Hs couple is expected to be 0.4V.\nThe group 8 elements show a distinctive oxide chemistry. All the lighter members have known or hypothetical tetroxides, MO4. Their oxidizing power decreases as one descends the group. FeO4 is not known due to its extraordinarily large electron affinity\u2014the amount of energy released when an electron is added to a neutral atom or molecule to form a negative ion\u2014which results in the formation of the well-known oxyanion ferrate(VI), FeO42-. Ruthenium tetroxide, RuO4, which is formed by oxidation of ruthenium(VI) in acid, readily undergoes reduction to ruthenate(VI), RuO42-. Oxidation of ruthenium metal in air forms the dioxide, RuO2. In contrast, osmium burns to form the stable tetroxide, OsO4, which complexes with the hydroxide ion to form an osmium(VIII) -\"ate\" complex, [OsO4(OH)2]2\u2212. Therefore, hassium should behave as a heavier homologue of osmium by forming of a stable, very volatile tetroxide HsO4, which undergoes complexation with hydroxide to form a hassate(VIII), [HsO4(OH)2]2\u2212. Ruthenium tetroxide and osmium tetroxide are both volatile due to their symmetrical tetrahedral molecular geometry and because they are charge-neutral; hassium tetroxide should similarly be a very volatile solid. The trend of the volatilities of the group8 tetroxides is experimentally known to be RuO4&lt;OsO4&gt;HsO4, which confirms the calculated results. In particular, the calculated enthalpies of adsorption\u2014the energy required for the adhesion of atoms, molecules, or ions from a gas, liquid, or dissolved solid to a surface\u2014of HsO4, \u2212(45.4\u00b11)kJ/mol on quartz, agrees very well with the experimental value of \u2212(46\u00b12)kJ/mol.\nExperimental chemistry.\nThe first goal for chemical investigation was the formation of the tetroxide; it was chosen because ruthenium and osmium form volatile tetroxides, being the only transition metals to display a stable compound in the +8 oxidation state. Despite this selection for gas-phase chemical studies being clear from the beginning, chemical characterization of hassium was considered a difficult task for a long time. Although hassium was first synthesized in 1984, it was not until 1996 that a hassium isotope long-lived enough to allow chemical studies was synthesized. Unfortunately, this isotope, 269Hs, was synthesized indirectly from the decay of 277Cn; not only are indirect synthesis methods not favourable for chemical studies, but the reaction that produced the isotope 277Cn had a low yield\u2014its cross section was only 1pb\u2014and thus did not provide enough hassium atoms for a chemical investigation. Direct synthesis of 269Hs and 270Hs in the reaction 248Cm(26Mg,\"x\"n)274\u2212\"x\"Hs (\"x\"=4 or 5) appeared more promising because the cross section for this reaction was somewhat larger at 7pb. This yield was still around ten times lower than that for the reaction used for the chemical characterization of bohrium. New techniques for irradiation, separation, and detection had to be introduced before hassium could be successfully characterized chemically.\nRuthenium and osmium have very similar chemistry due to the lanthanide contraction but iron shows some differences from them; for example, although ruthenium and osmium form stable tetroxides in which the metal is in the +8 oxidation state, iron does not. In preparation for the chemical characterization of hassium, research focused on ruthenium and osmium rather than iron because hassium was expected to be similar to ruthenium and osmium, as the predicted data on hassium closely matched that of those two.\nThe first chemistry experiments were performed using gas thermochromatography in 2001, using the synthetic osmium radioisotopes 172, 173Os as a reference. During the experiment, seven hassium atoms were synthesized using the reactions 248Cm(26Mg,5n)269Hs and 248Cm(26Mg,4n)270Hs. They were then thermalized and oxidized in a mixture of helium and oxygen gases to form hassium tetroxide molecules.\nHs + 2 O2 \u2192 HsO4\nThe measured deposition temperature of hassium tetroxide was higher than that of osmium tetroxide, which indicated the former was the less volatile one, and this placed hassium firmly in group 8. The enthalpy of adsorption for HsO4 measured, , was significantly lower than the predicted value, , indicating OsO4 is more volatile than HsO4, contradicting earlier calculations that implied they should have very similar volatilities. For comparison, the value for OsO4 is . (The calculations that yielded a closer match to the experimental data came after the experiment, in 2008.) It is possible hassium tetroxide interacts differently with silicon nitride than with silicon dioxide, the chemicals used for the detector; further research is required to establish whether there is a difference between such interactions and whether it has influenced the measurements. Such research would include more accurate measurements of the nuclear properties of 269Hs and comparisons with RuO4 in addition to OsO4.\nIn 2004, scientists reacted hassium tetroxide and sodium hydroxide to form sodium hassate(VIII), a reaction that is well known with osmium. This was the first acid-base reaction with a hassium compound, forming sodium hassate(VIII):\nHsO4 + 2 NaOH \u2192 Na2[HsO4(OH)2]\nThe team from the University of Mainz planned in 2008 to study the electrodeposition of hassium atoms using the new TASCA facility at GSI. Their aim was to use the reaction 226Ra(48Ca,4n)270Hs. Scientists at GSI were hoping to use TASCA to study the synthesis and properties of the hassium(II) compound hassocene, Hs(C5H5)2, using the reaction 226Ra(48Ca,\"x\"n). This compound is analogous to the lighter compounds ferrocene, ruthenocene, and osmocene, and is expected to have the two cyclopentadienyl rings in an eclipsed conformation like ruthenocene and osmocene and not in a staggered conformation like ferrocene. Hassocene, which is expected to be a stable and highly volatile compound, was chosen because it has hassium in the low formal oxidation state of +2\u2014although the bonding between the metal and the rings is mostly covalent in metallocenes\u2014rather than the high +8 state that had previously been investigated, and relativistic effects were expected to be stronger in the lower oxidation state. The highly symmetrical structure of hassocene and its low number of atoms make relativistic calculations easier. As of 2021[ [update]], there are no experimental reports of hassocene.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He served in the U.S. Army during World War II. After the war, he attended Harvard University, where he excelled academically. He later became a professor of government at the university and earned an international reputation as an expert on nuclear weapons and foreign policy. He acted as a consultant to government agencies, think tanks, and the presidential campaigns of Nelson Rockefeller and Nixon before being appointed as national security advisor and later secretary of state by President Nixon.\nAn advocate of a pragmatic approach to geopolitics known as \"Realpolitik\", Kissinger pioneered the policy of \"d\u00e9tente\" with the Soviet Union, orchestrated an opening of relations with China, engaged in \"shuttle diplomacy\" in the Middle East to end the Yom Kippur War, and negotiated the Paris Peace Accords, which ended American involvement in the Vietnam War. For his role in negotiating the accords, he was awarded the 1973 Nobel Peace Prize, which sparked controversy. Kissinger is also associated with controversial U.S. policies including its bombing of Cambodia, involvement in the 1971 Bolivian and 1973 Chilean coup d'\u00e9tats, and support for Argentina's military junta in its Dirty War, Indonesia in its invasion of East Timor, and Pakistan during the Bangladesh Liberation War and Bangladesh genocide. Considered by many American scholars to have been an effective secretary of state, Kissinger was also accused by critics of war crimes for the civilian death toll of the policies he pursued and for his role in facilitating U.S. support for authoritarian regimes.\nAfter leaving government, Kissinger founded Kissinger Associates, an international geopolitical consulting firm which he ran from 1982 until his death. He authored over a dozen books on diplomatic history and international relations. His advice was sought by American presidents of both major political parties.\nEarly life and education.\nKissinger was born Heinz Alfred Kissinger on May 27, 1923, in F\u00fcrth, Bavaria, Germany. He was the son of homemaker Paula (n\u00e9e\u00a0Stern), from Leutershausen, and Louis Kissinger, a school teacher. He had a younger brother, Walter, who was a businessman. Kissinger's family was German-Jewish. His great-great-grandfather Meyer L\u00f6b adopted \"Kissinger\" as his surname in 1817, taking it from the Bavarian spa town of Bad Kissingen. In his childhood, Kissinger enjoyed playing soccer. He played for the youth team of SpVgg F\u00fcrth, one of the nation's best clubs at the time.\nIn a 2022 BBC interview, Kissinger vividly recalled being nine years old in 1933 and learning of Adolf Hitler's election as Chancellor of Germany, which proved to be a profound turning point for the Kissinger family. During Nazi rule, Kissinger and his friends were regularly harassed and beaten by Hitler Youth gangs. Kissinger sometimes defied the segregation imposed by Nazi racial laws by sneaking into soccer stadiums to watch matches, often receiving beatings from security guards. As a result of the Nazis' anti-Semitic laws, Kissinger was unable to gain admittance to the \"Gymnasium\" and his father was dismissed from his teaching job.\nOn August 20, 1938, when Kissinger was 15 years old, he and his family fled Germany to avoid further Nazi persecution. The family briefly stopped in London before arriving in New York City on September 5. Kissinger later downplayed the influence his experiences of Nazi persecution had had on his policies and view of the world, writing that the \"Germany of my youth had a great deal of order and very little justice; it was not the sort of place likely to inspire devotion to order in the abstract.\" Nevertheless, many scholars, including Kissinger's biographer Walter Isaacson, have argued that his experiences influenced the formation of his realist approach to foreign policy.\nKissinger spent his high-school years in the German-Jewish community in Washington Heights, Manhattan. Although Kissinger assimilated quickly into American culture, he never lost his pronounced German accent, due to childhood shyness that made him hesitant to speak. After his first year at George Washington High School, he completed school at night while working in a shaving brush factory during the day.\nKissinger studied accounting at the City College of New York, excelling academically as a part-time student while continuing to work. His studies were interrupted in early 1943, when he was drafted into the U.S. Army.\nU.S. Army.\nKissinger underwent basic training at Camp Croft in Spartanburg, South Carolina. On June 19, 1943, while stationed in South Carolina, he became a naturalized U.S.\u00a0citizen. The army sent him to study engineering at Lafayette College in Pennsylvania under the Army Specialized Training Program, but the program was canceled and Kissinger was reassigned to the 84th Infantry Division. There, he made the acquaintance of Fritz Kraemer, a fellow immigrant from Germany who noted Kissinger's fluency in German and his intellect and arranged for him to be assigned to the division's military intelligence. According to Vernon A. Walters, Kissinger also received training at Camp Ritchie, Maryland, before being shipped to Europe. Kissinger saw combat with the division and volunteered for hazardous intelligence duties during the Battle of the Bulge. On April 10, 1945, he participated in the liberation of the Hannover-Ahlem concentration camp, a subcamp of the Neuengamme concentration camp. At the time, Kissinger wrote in his journal, \"I had never seen people degraded to the level that people were in Ahlem. They barely looked human. They were skeletons.\" After the initial shock, however, Kissinger was relatively silent about his wartime service.\nDuring the American advance into Germany, Kissinger, though only a private, was put in charge of the administration of the city of Krefeld because of a lack of German speakers on the division's intelligence staff. Within eight days he had established a civilian administration. Kissinger was then reassigned to the Counter Intelligence Corps (CIC), where he became a CIC Special Agent holding the enlisted rank of sergeant. He was given charge of a team in Hanover assigned to tracking down Gestapo officers and other saboteurs, for which he was awarded the Bronze Star. Kissinger drew up a comprehensive list of all known Gestapo employees in the Bergstra\u00dfe region, and had them rounded up. By the end of July, 12 men had been arrested. In March 1947, Fritz Girke, Hans Hellenbroich, Michael Raaf, and Karl Stattmann were subsequently caught and tried by the Dachau Military Tribunal for killing two American prisoners of war. The four men were all found guilty and sentenced to death. They were executed by hanging at Landsberg Prison in October 1948.\nIn June 1945, Kissinger was made commandant of the Bensheim metro CIC detachment, Bergstra\u00dfe district of Hesse, with responsibility for denazification of the district. Although he possessed absolute authority and powers of arrest, Kissinger took care to avoid abuses against the local population by his command.\nIn 1946, Kissinger was reassigned to teach at the European Command Intelligence School at Camp King and, as a civilian employee following his separation from the army, continued to serve in this role.\nKissinger recalled that his experience in the army \"made me feel like an American\".\nAcademic career.\nKissinger earned his Bachelor of Arts \"summa cum laude\", Phi Beta Kappa in political science from Harvard College in 1950, where he lived in Adams House and studied under William Yandell Elliott. His senior undergraduate thesis, titled \"The Meaning of History: Reflections on Spengler, Toynbee and Kant\", was over 400 pages long, and provoked Harvard's current cap on the length of undergraduate theses (35,000 words). He earned his Master of Arts and Doctor of Philosophy at Harvard University in 1951 and 1954, respectively. In 1952, while still a graduate student at Harvard, he served as a consultant to the director of the Psychological Strategy Board, and founded a magazine, \"Confluence\". At that time, he sought to work as a spy for the FBI.\nKissinger's doctoral dissertation was titled \"Peace, Legitimacy, and the Equilibrium (A Study of the Statesmanship of Castlereagh and Metternich)\". Stephen Graubard, Kissinger's friend, asserted that Kissinger primarily pursued such endeavor to instruct himself on the history of power play between European states in the 19th century. In his doctoral dissertation, Kissinger first introduced the concept of \"legitimacy\", which he defined as: \"Legitimacy as used here should not be confused with justice. It means no more than an international agreement about the nature of workable arrangements and about the permissible aims and methods of foreign policy\". An international order accepted by all of the major powers is \"legitimate\" whereas an international order not accepted by one or more of the great powers is \"revolutionary\" and hence dangerous. Thus, when after the Congress of Vienna in 1815, the leaders of Britain, France, Austria, Prussia, and Russia agreed to co-operate in the Concert of Europe to preserve the peace after Austria, Prussia, and Russia participated in a series of three Partitions of Poland, in Kissinger's viewpoint this international system was \"legitimate\" because it was accepted by the leaders of all five of the Great Powers of Europe. Notably, Kissinger's \"Primat der Au\u00dfenpolitik\" (Primacy of foreign policy) approach to diplomacy took it for granted that as long as the decision-makers in the major states were willing to accept the international order, then it is \"legitimate\" with questions of public opinion and morality dismissed as irrelevant. His dissertation also won him the Senator Charles Sumner Prize, an award given to the best dissertation \"from the legal, political, historical, economic, social, or ethnic approach, dealing with any means or measures tending toward the prevention of war and the establishment of universal peace\" by a student under the Harvard Department of Government. It was published in 1957 as \"A World Restored: Metternich, Castlereagh and the Problems of Peace 1812\u20131822\".\nKissinger remained at Harvard as a member of the faculty in the Department of Government where he served as the director of the Harvard International Seminar between 1951 and 1971. In 1955, he was a consultant to the National Security Council's Operations Coordinating Board. During 1955 and 1956, he was also study director in nuclear weapons and foreign policy at the Council on Foreign Relations. He released his book \"Nuclear Weapons and Foreign Policy\" the following year. The book, which criticized the Eisenhower administration's massive retaliation nuclear doctrine, caused much controversy at the time by proposing the use of tactical nuclear weapons on a regular basis to win wars. That same year, he published \"A World Restored\", a study of balance-of-power politics in post-Napoleonic Europe.\nFrom 1956 to 1958, Kissinger worked for the Rockefeller Brothers Fund as director of its Special Studies Project. He served as the director of the Harvard Defense Studies Program between 1958 and 1971. In 1958, he also co-founded the Center for International Affairs with Robert R. Bowie where he served as its associate director. Outside of academia, he served as a consultant to several government agencies and think tanks, including the Operations Research Office, the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency, Department of State, and the RAND Corporation.\nKeen to have a greater influence on U.S. foreign policy, Kissinger became foreign policy advisor to the presidential campaigns of Nelson Rockefeller, supporting his bids for the Republican nomination in 1960, 1964, and 1968. Kissinger first met Richard Nixon at a party hosted by Clare Boothe Luce in 1967, saying that he found him more \"thoughtful\" than he expected. During the Republican primaries in 1968, Kissinger again served as the foreign policy adviser to Rockefeller and in July 1968 called Nixon \"the most dangerous of all the men running to have as president\". Initially upset when Nixon won the Republican nomination, the ambitious Kissinger soon changed his mind about Nixon and contacted a Nixon campaign aide, Richard Allen, to state he was willing to do anything to help Nixon win. After Nixon became president in January 1969, Kissinger was appointed as National Security Advisor. By this time, he was arguably \"one of the most important theorists about foreign policy ever to be produced by the United States\", according to his official biographer Niall Ferguson.\nForeign policy.\nKissinger served as National Security Advisor and Secretary of State under President Richard Nixon and continued as Secretary of State under Nixon's successor Gerald Ford. With the death of George Shultz in February 2021, Kissinger was the last surviving member of the Nixon administration Cabinet.\nThe relationship between Nixon and Kissinger was unusually close, and has been compared to the relationships of Woodrow Wilson and Colonel House, or Franklin D. Roosevelt and Harry Hopkins. In all three cases, the State Department was relegated to a backseat role in developing foreign policy. Kissinger and Nixon shared a penchant for secrecy and conducted numerous \"backchannel\" negotiations, such as that through the Soviet Ambassador to the United States, Anatoly Dobrynin, that excluded State Department experts. Historian David Rothkopf looked at the personalities of Nixon and Kissinger, saying:\nThey were a fascinating pair. In a way, they complemented each other perfectly. Kissinger was the charming and worldly Mr. Outside who provided the grace and intellectual-establishment respectability that Nixon lacked, disdained and aspired to. Kissinger was an international citizen. Nixon very much a classic American. Kissinger had a worldview and a facility for adjusting it to meet the times, Nixon had pragmatism and a strategic vision that provided the foundations for their policies. Kissinger would, of course, say that he was not political like Nixon\u2014but in fact he was just as political as Nixon, just as calculating, just as relentlessly ambitious\u00a0... these self-made men were driven as much by their need for approval and their neuroses as by their strengths.\nA proponent of \"Realpolitik\", Kissinger played a dominant role in United States foreign policy between 1969 and 1977. In that period, he extended the policy of \"d\u00e9tente\". This policy led to a significant relaxation in U.S.\u2013Soviet tensions and played a crucial role in 1971 talks with the People's Republic of China premier Zhou Enlai. The talks concluded with a rapprochement between the United States and China, and the formation of a new strategic anti-Soviet Sino-American alignment. He was jointly awarded the 1973 Nobel Peace Prize with L\u00ea \u0110\u1ee9c Th\u1ecd for helping to establish a ceasefire and U.S. withdrawal from Vietnam. The ceasefire, however, was not durable. Th\u1ecd declined to accept the award and Kissinger appeared deeply ambivalent about it\u2014he donated his prize money to charity, did not attend the award ceremony, and later offered to return his prize medal. As National Security Advisor in 1974, Kissinger directed the much-debated National Security Study Memorandum 200.\n\"D\u00e9tente\" and opening to the People's Republic of China.\nKissinger initially had little interest in China when he began his work as National Security Adviser in 1969, and the driving force behind the rapprochement with China was Nixon. Like Nixon, Kissinger believed that relations with China would help the United States exit the Vietnam War and obtain long-term strategic benefits in confrontations with the Soviet Union.3\nIn April 1970, both Nixon and Kissinger promised Chiang Ching-kuo, the son of Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek, that they would never abandon Taiwan or make any compromises with Mao Zedong, although Nixon did speak vaguely of his wish to improve relations with the People's Republic.\nKissinger made two trips to the People's Republic in July and October 1971 (the first of which was made in secret) to confer with Premier Zhou Enlai, then in charge of Chinese foreign policy. During his visit to Beijing, the main issue turned out to be Taiwan, as Zhou demanded the United States recognize that Taiwan was a legitimate part of the People's Republic, pull U.S. forces out of Taiwan, and end military support for the Kuomintang regime. Kissinger gave way by promising to pull U.S. forces out of Taiwan, saying two-thirds would be pulled out when the Vietnam war ended and the rest to be pulled out as Sino-American relations improved.\nIn October 1971, as Kissinger was making his second trip to the People's Republic, the issue of which Chinese government deserved to be represented in the United Nations came up again. Out of concern to not be seen abandoning an ally, the United States tried to promote a compromise under which both Chinese regimes would be United Nations members, although Kissinger called it \"an essentially doomed rearguard action\". While American ambassador to the United Nations George H. W. Bush was lobbying for the \"two Chinas\" formula, Kissinger was removing favorable references to Taiwan from a speech that then Secretary of State William P. Rogers was preparing, as he expected the country to be expelled from the United Nations. During his second visit to Beijing, Kissinger told Zhou that according to a public opinion poll 62% of Americans wanted Taiwan to remain a United Nations member and asked him to consider the \"two Chinas\" compromise to avoid offending American public opinion. Zhou responded with his claim that the People's Republic was the legitimate government of all China, and no compromise was possible. Kissinger said that the United States could not totally sever ties with Chiang, who had been an ally in World War II. Kissinger told Nixon that Bush was \"too soft and not sophisticated\" enough to properly represent the United States at the United Nations and expressed no anger when the United Nations General Assembly voted to expel Taiwan and give China's seat on the United Nations Security Council to the People's Republic.\nKissinger's trips paved the way for the groundbreaking 1972 summit between Nixon, Zhou, and Chinese Communist Party Chairman Mao Zedong, as well as the formalization of relations between the two countries, ending 23 years of diplomatic isolation and mutual hostility. The result was the formation of a tacit strategic anti-Soviet alliance between China and the United States. Kissinger's diplomacy led to economic and cultural exchanges between the two sides and the establishment of \"liaison offices\" in the Chinese and American capitals, though full normalization of relations with China would not occur until 1979.\nVietnam War.\nKissinger discussed being involved in Indochina prior to his appointment as National Security Adviser to Nixon. According to Kissinger, his friend Henry Cabot Lodge Jr., the Ambassador to Saigon, employed Kissinger as a consultant, leading to Kissinger visiting Vietnam once in 1965 and twice in 1966, where Kissinger realized that the United States \"knew neither how to win or how to conclude\" the Vietnam War. Kissinger also stated that in 1967, he served as an intermediary for negotiations between the United States and North Vietnam, with Kissinger providing the American position, while two Frenchmen provided the North Vietnamese position.\nWhen he came into office in 1969, Kissinger favored a negotiating strategy under which the United States and North Vietnam would sign an armistice and agreed to pull their troops out of South Vietnam while the South Vietnamese government and the Viet Cong were to agree to a coalition government. Kissinger had doubts about Nixon's theory of \"linkage\", believing that this would give the Soviet Union leverage over the United States and unlike Nixon was less concerned about the ultimate fate of South Vietnam. Though Kissinger did not regard South Vietnam as important in its own right, he believed it was necessary to support South Vietnam to maintain the United States as a global power, believing that none of America's allies would trust the United States if South Vietnam were abandoned too quickly.\nIn early 1969, Kissinger was opposed to the plans for Operation Menu, the bombing of Cambodia, fearing that Nixon was acting rashly with no plans for the diplomatic fall-out, but on March 16, 1969, Nixon announced the bombing would start the next day. As he saw the president was committed, he became more supportive. Kissinger played a key role in bombing Cambodia to disrupt raids into South Vietnam from Cambodia, as well as the 1970 Cambodian campaign and subsequent widespread bombing of Khmer Rouge targets in Cambodia. For his role in planning the U.S. bombing of Cambodia, scholars have stated that Kissinger bears substantial responsibility for the killing of between 50,000 and 150,000 Cambodian civilians and also the destabilization of Cambodia that the U.S. bombing campaign caused, which contributed to the Khmer Rouge's ascendance to power. The Paris peace talks had become stalemated by late 1969 owing to the obstructionism of the South Vietnamese delegation. The South Vietnamese president Nguy\u1ec5n V\u0103n Thi\u1ec7u did not want the United States to withdraw from Vietnam, and out of frustration with him, Kissinger began secret peace talks with \nLe Duc Th\u1ecd in Paris parallel to the official talks that the South Vietnamese were unaware of. In June 1971, Kissinger supported Nixon's effort to ban the \"Pentagon Papers\" saying the \"hemorrhage of state secrets\" to the media was making diplomacy impossible.\nOn August 1, 1972, Kissinger met Th\u1ecd again in Paris, and for first time, he seemed willing to compromise, saying that political and military terms of an armistice could be treated separately and hinted that his government was no longer willing to make the overthrow of Thi\u1ec7u a precondition. On the evening of October 8, 1972, at a secret meeting of Kissinger and Th\u1ecd in Paris came the decisive breakthrough in the talks. Th\u1ecd began with \"a very realistic and very simple proposal\" for a ceasefire that would see the Americans pull all their forces out of Vietnam in exchange for the release of all the POWs in North Vietnam. Kissinger accepted Th\u1ecd's offer as the best deal possible, saying that the \"mutual withdrawal formula\" had to be abandoned as it had been \"unobtainable through ten years of war\u00a0... We could not make it a condition for a final settlement. We had long passed that threshold\". In the fall of 1972, both Kissinger and Nixon were frustrated with Thi\u1ec7u's refusal to accept any sort of peace deal calling for withdrawal of American forces. On October 21 Kissinger and the American ambassador Ellsworth Bunker arrived in Saigon to show Thi\u1ec7u the peace agreement. Thi\u1ec7u refused to sign the peace agreement and demanded very extensive amendments that Kissinger reported to Nixon \"verge on insanity\".\nThough Nixon had initially supported Kissinger against Thi\u1ec7u, H.R. Haldeman and John Ehrlichman urged him to reconsider, arguing that Thi\u1ec7u's objections had merit. Nixon wanted 69 amendments to the draft peace agreement included in the final treaty and ordered Kissinger back to Paris to force Th\u1ecd to accept them. Kissinger regarded Nixon's 69 amendments as \"preposterous\" as he knew Th\u1ecd would never accept them. As expected, Th\u1ecd refused to consider any of the 69 amendments, and on December 13, 1972, left Paris for Hanoi. Kissinger by this stage was worked up into a state of fury after Th\u1ecd walked out of the Paris talks and told Nixon: \"They're just a bunch of shits. Tawdry, filthy shits\".\nOn January 8, 1973, Kissinger and Th\u1ecd met again in Paris and the next day reached an agreement, which in main points was essentially the same as the one Nixon had rejected in October with only cosmetic concessions to the Americans. Thi\u1ec7u once again rejected the peace agreement, only to receive an ultimatum from Nixon which caused Thi\u1ec7u to reluctantly accept the peace agreement. On January 27, 1973, Kissinger and Th\u1ecd signed a peace agreement that called for the complete withdrawal of all U.S. forces from Vietnam by March in exchange for North Vietnam freeing all the U.S. POWs. Along with Th\u1ecd, Kissinger was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize on December 10, 1973, for their work in negotiating the ceasefires contained in the Paris Peace Accords on \"Ending the War and Restoring Peace in Vietnam\", signed the previous January. According to Irwin Abrams in 2001, this prize was the most controversial to date. For the first time in the history of the Peace Prize, two members left the Nobel Committee in protest. Th\u1ecd rejected the award, telling Kissinger that peace had not been restored in South Vietnam. Kissinger wrote to the Nobel Committee that he accepted the award \"with humility\", and \"donated the entire proceeds to the children of American service members killed or missing in action in Indochina\". After the Fall of Saigon in 1975, Kissinger attempted to return the award.\nBy the summer of 1974, the U.S. embassy reported that morale in the ARVN had fallen to dangerously low levels and it was uncertain how much longer South Vietnam would last. In August 1974, the U.S. Congress passed a bill limiting American aid to South Vietnam to $700\u00a0million annually. By November 1974, Kissinger lobbied Leonid Brezhnev to end Soviet military aid to North Vietnam. The same month, he also lobbied Mao Zedong and Zhou Enlai to end Chinese military aid to North Vietnam. On April 15, 1975, Kissinger testified before the Senate Appropriations Committee, urging Congress to increase the military aid budget to South Vietnam by another $700\u00a0million to save the ARVN as the PAVN was rapidly advancing on Saigon, which was refused. Kissinger maintained at the time, and until his death, that if only Congress had approved of his request for another $700\u00a0million South Vietnam would have been able to resist.\nIn November 1975, seven months after the Khmer Rouge took power, Kissinger told the Thai foreign minister: \"You should tell the Cambodians that we will be friends with them. They are murderous thugs but we won't let that stand in our way.\" In a 1998 interview, Kissinger said: \"some countries, the Chinese in particular supported Pol Pot as a counterweight to the Vietnamese supported people and \"We\" at least tolerated it.\" Kissinger said he did not approve of this due to the genocide and said he \"would not have dealt with Pol Pot for any purpose whatsoever.\" He further said: \"The Thais and the Chinese did not want a Vietnamese-dominated Indochina. \"We\" didn't want the Vietnamese to dominate. I don't believe we did anything for Pol Pot. But I suspect we closed our eyes when some others did something for Pol Pot.\"\nInterview with Oriana Fallaci.\nOn November 4, 1972, Kissinger agreed to an interview with Italian journalist Oriana Fallaci. Kissinger, who rarely engaged in one-on-one interviews with the press and knew very little about Fallaci, accepted her request after reportedly being impressed with her 1969 interview with V\u00f5 Nguy\u00ean Gi\u00e1p. The interview turned out to be a political and public relations disaster for Kissinger as he agreed that Vietnam was a \"useless war\", implied that he preferred to have dinner with L\u00ea \u0110\u1ee9c Th\u1ecd over Nguy\u1ec5n V\u0103n Thi\u1ec7u (in her 1976 book \"Interview with History\", Fallaci recalled that Kissinger agreed with many of her negative sentiments towards Thi\u1ec7u in a private discussion before the interview), and engaged in a now infamous exchange with the hard-pressing Fallaci, with Kissinger comparing himself to a cowboy leading the Nixon administration:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Fallaci: &lt;q&gt;I suppose that at the root of everything there's your success. I mean, like a chess player, you've made two or three good moves. China, first of all. People like chess players who checkmate the king.&lt;/q&gt;Kissinger: &lt;q&gt;Yes, China has been a very important element in the mechanics of my success. And yet that's not the main point. The main point.\u00a0... Well, yes, I'll tell you. What do I care? The main point arises from the fact that I've always acted alone. Americans like that immensely. Americans like the cowboy who leads the wagon train by riding ahead alone on his horse, the cowboy who rides all alone into the town, the village, with his horse and nothing else. Maybe even without a pistol, since he doesn't shoot. He acts, that's all, by being in the right place at the right time. In short, a Western.&lt;/q&gt;Fallaci: &lt;q&gt;I see. You see yourself as a kind of Henry Fonda, unarmed and ready to fight with his fists for honest ideals. Alone, courageous\u00a0...&lt;/q&gt;Kissinger: &lt;q&gt;Not necessarily courageous. In fact, this cowboy doesn't have to be courageous. All he needs is to be alone, to show others that he rides into the town and does everything by himself. This amazing, romantic character suits me precisely because to be alone has always been part of my style or, if you like, my technique. Together with independence. Oh, that's very important in me and for me. And finally, conviction. I've always been convinced that I had to do whatever I've done. And people feel it, and believe in it. And I care about the fact that they believe in me when you sway or convince somebody, you shouldn't confuse them. Nor can you even simply calculate. Some people think that I carefully plan what are to be the consequences, for the public, of any of my initiatives or efforts. They think this preoccupation is always on my mind. Instead the consequences of what I do, I mean the public's judgment, have never bothered me. I don't ask for popularity, I'm not looking for popularity. On the contrary, if you really want to know, I care nothing about popularity. I'm not at all afraid of losing my public; I can allow myself to say what I think. I'm referring to what's genuine in me. If I were to let myself be disturbed by the reactions of the public, if I were to act solely on the basis of a calculated technique, I would accomplish nothing.&lt;/q&gt;\nNixon was enraged by the interview, in particular the comedic \"cowboy\" comparison which infuriated Nixon. For several weeks afterwards, he refused to see Kissinger and even contemplated firing him. At one point, Kissinger, in desperation, drove up unannounced to Nixon's San Clemente residence but was rejected by Secret Service personnel at the gates. Kissinger later claimed that it was \"the single most disastrous conversation I have ever had with any member of the press\". Fallaci described the interview with the evasive, monotonous, non-expressive Kissinger as the most uncomfortable and most difficult she ever did, criticizing Kissinger as a \"intellectual adventurer\" and a self-styled Metternich.\nBangladesh Liberation War.\nNixon supported Pakistani dictator Yahya Khan in the Bangladesh Liberation War in 1971. Kissinger sneered at people who \"bleed\" for \"the dying Bengalis\" and ignored the first telegram from the U.S. consul general in East Pakistan, Archer K. Blood, and 20 members of his staff, which informed the U.S. that their allies West Pakistan were undertaking, in Blood's words, \"a selective genocide\" targeting the Bengali intelligentsia, supporters of independence for East Pakistan, and the Hindu minority. In the second, more famous, Blood Telegram the word 'genocide' was again used to describe the events, and further that with its continuing support for West Pakistan the U.S. government had \"evidenced\u00a0... moral bankruptcy\". As a direct response to the dissent against U.S. policy, Kissinger and Nixon ended Archer Blood's tenure as United States consul general in East Pakistan and put him to work in the State Department's Personnel Office. Christopher Clary argues that Nixon and Kissinger were unconsciously biased, leading them to overestimate the likelihood of Pakistani victory against Bengali rebels.\nKissinger was particularly concerned about the expansion of Soviet influence in the Indian subcontinent as a result of a treaty of friendship recently signed by India and the Soviet Union, and sought to demonstrate to China (Pakistan's ally and an enemy of both India and the Soviet Union) the value of a tacit alliance with the United States.\nKissinger had also come under fire for private comments he made to Nixon during the Bangladesh\u2013Pakistan War in which he described Indian prime minister Indira Gandhi as a \"bitch\" and a \"witch\". He also said \"the Indians are bastards\", shortly before the war. Kissinger later expressed his regret over the comments.\nEurope.\nAs National Security Adviser under Nixon, Kissinger pioneered the policy of \"d\u00e9tente\" with the Soviet Union, seeking a relaxation in tensions between the two superpowers. As a part of this strategy, he negotiated the Strategic Arms Limitation Talks (culminating in the SALT I treaty) and the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty with Leonid Brezhnev, General Secretary of the Soviet Communist Party. Negotiations about strategic disarmament were originally supposed to start under the Lyndon Johnson administration but were postponed in protest upon the invasion by Warsaw Pact troops of Czechoslovakia in August 1968.\nNixon felt his administration had neglected relations with the Western European states in his first term and in September 1972 decided that if he was reelected that 1973 would be the \"Year of Europe\" as the United States would focus on relations with the states of the European Economic Community (EEC) which had emerged as a serious economic rival by 1970. Applying his favorite \"linkage\" concept, Nixon intended henceforward economic relations with Europe would not be severed from security relations, and if the EEC states wanted changes in American tariff and monetary policies, the price would be defense spending on their part. Kissinger in particular as part of the \"Year of Europe\" wanted to \"revitalize\" NATO, which he called a \"decaying\" alliance as he believed that there was nothing at present to stop the Red Army from overrunning Western Europe in a conventional forces conflict. The \"linkage\" concept more applied to the question of security as Kissinger noted that the United States was going to sacrifice NATO for the sake of \"citrus fruits\".\nIsraeli policy and Soviet Jewry.\nAccording to notes taken by H. R. Haldeman, Nixon \"ordered his aides to exclude all Jewish-Americans from policy-making on Israel\", including Kissinger. One note quotes Nixon as saying \"get K. [Kissinger] out of the play\u2014Haig handle it\".\nIn 1973, Kissinger did not feel that pressing the Soviet Union concerning the plight of Jews being persecuted there was in the interest of U.S. foreign policy. In a conversation with Nixon shortly after a meeting with Israeli prime minister Golda Meir on March 1, 1973, Kissinger stated, \"The emigration of Jews from the Soviet Union is not an objective of American foreign policy, and if they put Jews into gas chambers in the Soviet Union, it is not an American concern. Maybe a humanitarian concern.\" He had a negative view of American Jews who lobbied for aid to Soviet Jews, calling them \"bastards\" and \"self-serving\". He went on to state that, \"If it were not for the accident of my birth, I would be antisemitic\" and \"any people who has been persecuted for two thousand years must be doing something wrong.\"\nArab\u2013Israeli conflict.\nIn September 1973, Nixon fired William P. Rogers as Secretary of State and replaced him with Kissinger. He would later state he had not been given enough time to know the Middle East as he settled into the State Department. Kissinger later admitted that he was so engrossed with the Paris peace talks to end the Vietnam war that he and others in Washington missed the significance of the Egyptian-Saudi alliance. Egyptian president Anwar Sadat expelled Soviet advisors from Egypt in May 1972, attempting to signal to the U.S. that he was open to disentangling Egypt from the Soviet sphere of influence; Kissinger offered secret talks on a settlement for the Middle East, though nothing came of the offer. By March 1973, Sadat had moved back towards the Soviets, closing the largest arms package between Egypt and the Soviet Union and allowing for the return of Soviet military personnel and advisors to Egypt.\nOn October 6, 1973, at 6:15\u00a0am, assistant secretary for Near Eastern affairs Joseph Sisco, informed Kissinger that Egypt and Syria were about to go to war with Israel. Sisco had been warned by U.S. ambassador to Israel, Kenneth Keating, who two hours previously had been urgently summoned by Israel's Prime Minister Golda Meir who believed conflict was imminent. Prioritising \"d\u00e9tente\", Kissinger's first phone call (at 6:40\u00a0am) was to Soviet ambassador and good friend Anatoly Dobrynin. He would later make calls to British ambassador Rowland Baring and the U.N. secretary-general Kurt Waldheim. Kissinger did not inform President Richard Nixon or White House chief of staff Alexander Haig about the start of the Yom Kippur War until either 8:35 or 9:25\u00a0am. as both were spending the weekend at Key Biscayne discussing Spiro Agnew's imminent resignation. According to Kissinger his urgent calls to the Soviets and Egyptians were ineffective.\nOn October 12, under Nixon's direction, and against Kissinger's initial advice, while Kissinger was on his way to Moscow to discuss conditions for a cease-fire, Nixon sent a message to Brezhnev giving Kissinger full negotiating authority. Kissinger wanted to stall a ceasefire to gain more time for Israel to push across the Suez Canal to the African side, and wanted to be perceived as a mere presidential emissary who needed to consult the White House all the time as a stalling tactic.\nKissinger promised the Israeli prime minister Golda Meir that the United States would replace its losses in equipment after the war, but sought initially to delay arms shipments to Israel, as he believed it would improve the odds of making peace along the lines of United Nations Security Council Resolution 242. In 1973, Meir requested $850\u00a0million worth of American arms and equipment to replace its materiel losses. Nixon instead sent some $2\u00a0billion worth. The arms lift enraged King Faisal of Saudi Arabia, and he retaliated on October 20, 1973, by placing a total embargo on oil shipments to the United States, to be joined by all of the other oil-producing Arab states except Iraq and Libya.\nOn November 7, 1973, Kissinger flew to Riyadh to meet King Faisal and to ask him to end the oil embargo in exchange for promising to be \"even handed\" in the Arab-Israeli dispute. Despite Kissinger's efforts to charm him, Faisal refused to lift the oil embargo. Only on March 19, 1974, did the King end the oil embargo, after Sadat reported to him that the United States was being more \"even handed\" and after Kissinger had promised to sell Saudi Arabia weapons that it had previously denied under the grounds that they might be used against Israel.\nKissinger pressured the Israelis to cede some of the newly captured land back to its Arab neighbors, contributing to the first phases of Israeli\u2013Egyptian non-aggression. In 1973\u20131974, Kissinger engaged in \"shuttle diplomacy\" flying between Tel Aviv, Cairo, and Damascus in a bid to make the armistice the basis of a permanent peace. Kissinger's first meeting with Hafez al-Assad lasted 6 hours and 30 minutes, causing the press to believe for a moment that he had been kidnapped by the Syrians. In his memoirs, Kissinger described how, during the course of his 28 meetings in Damascus in 1973\u201374, Assad \"negotiated tenaciously and daringly like a riverboat gambler to make sure he had exacted the last sliver of available concessions\". As for the others Kissinger negotiated with, Kissinger viewed the Israeli politicians as rigid, while he had a good relationship and was able to develop a sense of assurance with Sadat. Kissinger's efforts resulted in two ceasefires between Egypt and Israel, \"Sinai I\" in January 1974, and \"Sinai II\" in September 1975.\nKissinger had avoided involving France and the United Kingdom, the former European colonial powers of the Middle East, in the peace negotiations that followed the Yom Kippur War, being primarily focused on minimizing the Soviet Union's sway over the peace negotiations and on moderating the international influences on the Arab-Israeli conflict. President Pompidou of France was concerned and perturbed by this development, viewing it as an indication of the United States' ambitions of hegemonically domineering the region.\nPersian Gulf.\nA major concern for Kissinger was the possibility of Soviet influence in the Persian Gulf. In April 1969, Iraq came into conflict with Iran when Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi renounced the 1937 treaty governing the Shatt-al-Arab river. On December 1, 1971, after two years of skirmishes along the border, President Ahmed Hassan al-Bakr broke off diplomatic relations with Iran. In May 1972, Nixon and Kissinger visited Tehran to tell the Shah that there would be no \"second-guessing of his requests\" to buy American weapons. At the same time, Nixon and Kissinger agreed to a plan of the Shah's that the United States together with Iran and Israel would support the Kurdish \"peshmerga\" guerrillas fighting for independence from Iraq. Kissinger later wrote that after Vietnam, there was no possibility of deploying American forces in the Middle East, and henceforward Iran was to act as America's surrogate in the Persian Gulf. Kissinger described the Ba'athist regime in Iraq as a potential threat to the United States and believed that building up Iran and supporting the \"peshmerga\" was the best counterweight.\nTurkish invasion of Cyprus.\nFollowing a period of steady relations between the U.S. Government and the Greek military regime after 1967, Secretary of State Kissinger was faced with the coup by the Greek junta and the Turkish invasion of Cyprus in July and August 1974. In an August 1974 edition of \"The New York Times\", it was revealed that Kissinger and the State Department were informed in advance of the impending coup by the Greek junta in Cyprus. Indeed, according to the journalist, the official version of events as told by the State Department was that it felt it had to warn the Greek military regime not to carry out the coup.\nKissinger was a target of anti-American sentiment which was a significant feature of Greek public opinion at the time\u2014particularly among young people\u2014viewing the U.S. role in Cyprus as negative. In a demonstration by students in Heraklion, Crete, soon after the second phase of the Turkish invasion in August 1974, slogans such as \"Kissinger, murderer\", \"Americans get out\", \"No to Partition\" and \"Cyprus is no Vietnam\" were heard. Some years later, Kissinger expressed the opinion that the Cyprus issue was resolved in 1974. \"The New York Times\" and other major newspapers were highly critical, and even State Department officials did not hide their dissatisfaction with his alleged arrogance and ignorance of the basic facts of the issue.\nKissinger was reported to have said, \"The Turkish tactics are right \u2013 grab what they want and then negotiate on the basis of possession\".\nHowever, Kissinger never felt comfortable with the way he handled the Cyprus issue. Journalist Alexis Papahelas stated that Kissinger's \"facial expression changes markedly when someone\u2014usually Greek or Cypriot\u2014refers to the crisis\". According to him, Kissinger had felt since the summer of 1974 that history would not treat him lightly in relation to his actions.\nLatin American policy.\nIn 1970, Kissinger parroted to Nixon the United States Department of Defense's position that the country should maintain control over the Panama Canal, which was a reversal of the commitment by the Lyndon Johnson administration. Later, in the face of international pressure, Kissinger changed his stance, viewing the past hardline position in the Panama Canal issue as a hindrance to American relations with Latin America and an international setback that the Soviet Union would approve of. Kissinger in 1973 called for \"new dialogue\" between the United States and Latin America, then in 1974, Kissinger met Panama military leader Omar Torrijos and an agreement on eight operating principles for an eventual handover of the Panama Canal to Panama was made between Kissinger and Panamanian foreign minister Juan Antonio Tack, which angered the United States Congress, but ultimately provided a framework for the 1977 U.S.\u2013Panama treaties.\nCuba.\nKissinger initially supported the normalization of United States\u2013Cuba relations, broken since 1961 (all U.S.\u2013Cuban trade was blocked in February 1962, a few weeks after the exclusion of Cuba from the Organization of American States because of U.S. pressure). However, he quickly changed his mind and followed Kennedy's policy. After the involvement of the Cuban Revolutionary Armed Forces in the independence struggles in Angola and Mozambique, Kissinger said that unless Cuba withdrew its forces relations would not be normalized. Cuba refused.\nDuring the 1970 Cienfuegos Crisis, in which the Soviet Navy was strongly suspected of building a submarine base in the Cuban city of Cienfuegos, Kissinger met with Anatoly Dobrynin, Soviet Ambassador to the United States, informing him that the United States government considered this act a violation of the agreements made in 1962 by President John F. Kennedy and Premier Nikita Khrushchev in the wake of the Cuban Missile Crisis, prompting the Soviets to halt construction of their planned base in Cienfuegos.\nIn February 1976, Kissinger considered launching air strikes against ports and military installations in Cuba, as well as deploying U.S. Marine Corps battalions based at the U.S. Navy base at Guantanamo Bay, in retaliation for Cuban president Fidel Castro's decision in late 1975 to send troops to newly independent Angola to help the MPLA in its fight against UNITA and South Africa during the start of the Angolan Civil War.\nBolivian Coup.\nFollowing the uprising of October 7, 1970, General Juan Jos\u00e9 Torres came to power in Bolivia, forming a left-wing nationalist government with an \"anti-imperialist\" stance. His policies, which included the nationalization of some American-owned property, led to the U.S. exerting external pressure over his government.\nOn June 11, 1971, Nixon and Kissinger discussed plans for a coup in Bolivia, and later in July, the 40 Committee approved covert funding towards Torres's opposition. Torres was successfully overthrown by the Nationalist Popular Front, led by Hugo Banzer, in August 21, 1971.\nChilean Coup.\nChilean Socialist Party presidential candidate Salvador Allende was elected in 1970, causing serious concern in Washington, D.C., due to his socialist and pro-Cuban politics. The Nixon administration, with Kissinger's input, authorized the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) to encourage a military coup that would prevent Allende's inauguration, but the plan was not successful. Prior to Allende's election Kissinger had said that \"I don\u2019t see why we need to stand by and watch a country go Communist because of the irresponsibility of its own people\".\nOn September 11, 1973, Allende died during an army attack on the presidential palace that was an element of a military coup launched by Army Commander-in-Chief Augusto Pinochet, who then became the head of the military junta which replaced Allende. In September 1976, Orlando Letelier, a Chilean opponent of the new Pinochet regime, was assassinated in Washington, D.C., with a car bomb. Previously, Kissinger had helped secure his release from prison, and had chosen to cancel an official U.S. letter to Chile warning them against carrying out any political assassinations. This murder was part of Operation Condor, a covert program of political repression and assassination carried out by Southern Cone nations that Kissinger has been accused of being involved in.\nOn September 10, 2001, after recent declassification of documents, relatives and survivors of General Ren\u00e9 Schneider filed civil proceedings against Kissinger, in federal court in Washington, D.C., accusing him of collaborating in arranging Schneider's kidnapping which resulted in his death. The case was later dismissed by the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, citing separation of powers: \"The decision to support a coup of the Chilean government to prevent Dr. Allende from coming to power, and the means by which the United States Government sought to effect that goal, implicate policy makers in the murky realm of foreign affairs and national security best left to the political branches.\" Decades later, the CIA admitted its involvement in the kidnapping of General Schneider, but not his murder, and subsequently paid the group responsible for his death $35,000 \"to keep the prior contact secret, maintain the goodwill of the group, and for humanitarian reasons\".\nArgentina.\nKissinger took a similar line as he had toward Chile when the Argentine Armed Forces, led by Jorge Videla, toppled the elected government of Isabel Per\u00f3n in 1976 with a process called the National Reorganization Process by the military, with which they consolidated power, launching brutal reprisals and \"disappearances\" against political opponents. An October 1987 investigative report in \"The Nation\" broke the story of how, in a June 1976 meeting in the Hotel Carrera in Santiago, Kissinger gave the military junta in neighboring Argentina the \"green light\" for their own clandestine repression against leftwing guerrillas and other dissidents, thousands of whom were kept in more than 400 secret concentration camps before they were executed. During a meeting with Argentine foreign minister C\u00e9sar Augusto Guzzetti, Kissinger assured him that the United States was an ally but urged him to \"get back to normal procedures\" quickly before the U.S. Congress reconvened and had a chance to consider sanctions.\nAs the article published in \"The Nation\" noted, as the state-sponsored terror mounted, conservative Republican U.S. Ambassador to Buenos Aires Robert C. Hill \"'was shaken, he became very disturbed, by the case of the son of a thirty-year embassy employee, a student who was arrested, never to be seen again,' recalled Juan de Onis, former reporter for \"The New York Times\". 'Hill took a personal interest.' He went to the Interior Minister, a general with whom he had worked on drug cases, saying, 'Hey, what about this? We're interested in this case.' He questioned (Foreign Minister Cesar) Guzzetti and, finally, President Jorge Videla himself. 'All he got was stonewalling; he got nowhere.' de Onis said. 'His last year was marked by increasing disillusionment and dismay, and he backed his staff on human rights right to the hilt.\"\nIn a letter to \"The Nation\" editor Victor Navasky, protesting publication of the article, Kissinger claimed that: \"At any rate, the notion of Hill as a passionate human rights advocate is news to all his former associates.\" Yet Kissinger aide Harry W. Shlaudeman later disagreed with Kissinger, telling the oral historian William E. Knight of the Association for Diplomatic Studies and Training Foreign Affairs Oral History Project: It really came to a head when I was Assistant Secretary, or it began to come to a head, in the case of Argentina where the dirty war was in full flower. Bob Hill, who was Ambassador then in Buenos Aires, a very conservative Republican politician\u2014by no means liberal or anything of the kind, began to report quite effectively about what was going on, this slaughter of innocent civilians, supposedly innocent civilians\u2014this vicious war that they were conducting, underground war. He, at one time in fact, sent me a back-channel telegram saying that the Foreign Minister, who had just come for a visit to Washington and had returned to Buenos Aires, had gloated to him that Kissinger had said nothing to him about human rights. I don't know\u2014I wasn't present at the interview.\nNavasky later wrote in his book about being confronted by Kissinger: 'Tell me, Mr. Navasky,' [Kissinger] said in his famous guttural tones, 'how is it that a short article in an obscure journal such as yours about a conversation that was supposed to have taken place years ago about something that did or didn't happen in Argentina resulted in sixty people holding placards denouncing me a few months ago at the airport when I got off the plane in Copenhagen?'\nAccording to declassified state department files, Kissinger also hindered the Carter administration's efforts to halt the mass killings by the 1976\u20131983 military dictatorship by visiting the country as Videla's personal guest to attend the 1978 FIFA World Cup and praising the regime.\nBrazil's nuclear weapons program.\nKissinger was in favor of accommodating Brazil while it pursued a nuclear weapons program in the 1970s. Kissinger justified his position by arguing that Brazil was a U.S. ally and on the grounds that it would benefit private nuclear industry actors in the U.S. Kissinger's position on Brazil was out of sync with influential voices in the U.S. Congress, the State Department, and the U.S. Arms Control and Disarmament Agency.\nRhodesia.\nIn September 1976, Kissinger was actively involved in negotiations regarding the Rhodesian Bush War. Kissinger, along with South Africa's prime minister John Vorster, pressured Rhodesian prime minister Ian Smith to hasten the transition to black majority rule in Rhodesia. With FRELIMO in control of Mozambique and even the apartheid regime of South Africa withdrawing its support, Rhodesia's isolation was nearly complete. According to Smith's autobiography, Kissinger told Smith of Mrs. Kissinger's admiration for him, but Smith stated that he thought Kissinger was asking him to sign Rhodesia's \"death certificate\". Kissinger, bringing the weight of the United States, and corralling other relevant parties to put pressure on Rhodesia, hastened the end of white minority rule.\nPortuguese Empire.\nIn contrast to the unfriendly disposition of the previous Kennedy and Johnson administrations towards the Estado Novo regime of Portugal, particularly with regards to its attempts to maintain the Portuguese Colonial Empire by waging the Portuguese Colonial War against anti-colonial rebellions in defense of its empire, the Department of State under Kissinger adopted a more conciliatory attitude towards Portugal. In 1971, the administration of President Nixon successfully renewed the lease of the American military base in the Azores, despite condemnation from the Congressional Black Caucus and some members of the Senate. Though privately continuing to view Portugal contemptibly for its perceived atavistic foreign policy towards Africa, Kissinger publicly expressed thanks for Portugal's agreement to use its military base in Lajes in the Azores to resupply Israel in the Yom Kippur War. Following the fall of the far-right Portuguese regime in 1974, Kissinger worried that the new government's hasty decolonization plan might benefit radical factions such as the MPLA in Angola. He also expressed concern that the inclusion of the Portuguese Communist Party in the new Portuguese government could legitimize communist parties in other NATO member states, such as Italy.\nEast Timor.\nThe Portuguese decolonization process brought U.S. attention to the former Portuguese colony of East Timor, which declared its independence in 1975. Indonesian president Suharto regarded East Timor as rightfully part of Indonesia. In December 1975, Suharto discussed invasion plans during a meeting with Kissinger and President Ford in the Indonesian capital of Jakarta. Both Ford and Kissinger made clear that U.S. relations with Indonesia would remain strong and that it would not object to the proposed annexation. They only wanted it done \"fast\" and proposed that it be delayed until after they had returned to Washington. Accordingly, Suharto delayed the operation for one day. Finally on December 7, Indonesian forces invaded the former Portuguese colony. U.S. arms sales to Indonesia continued, and Suharto went ahead with the annexation plan. According to Ben Kiernan, the invasion and occupation resulted in the deaths of nearly a quarter of the Timorese population from 1975 to 1981.\nWestern Sahara.\nThe Kissingerian doctrine endorsed the forced concession of Spanish Sahara to Morocco. At the height of the 1975 Sahara crisis, Kissinger misled Gerald Ford into thinking the International Court of Justice had ruled in favor of Morocco. Kissinger was aware in advance of the Moroccan plans for the invasion of the territory, materialized on November 6, 1975, in the so-called Green March.\nZaire.\nKissinger was involved in furthering cooperation between the U.S. and the Zairian dictator Mobutu Sese Seko and held multiple meetings with him. Kissinger later described these efforts as \"one of our policy successes in Africa\" and praised Mobutu as \"courageous, politically astute\" and \"relatively honest in a country where governmental corruption is a way of life\".\nLater roles.\nAfter Nixon was forced to resign in August 1974 due to the Watergate scandal, Kissinger initially kept both of his positions as Secretary of State and National Security Advisor under the new presidential administration of Gerald Ford. However, his influence was somewhat diminished when he was replaced by Brent Scowcroft as National Security Advisor during the \"Halloween Massacre\" cabinet reshuffle of November 1975. Ford later explained his decision to journalist Thomas M. DeFrank: \"When Kissinger had both State and NSC, there was not an independent evaluation of proposals, and I never liked that arrangement that I inherited. And when the time came to make some [other] changes at the Pentagon and CIA, it was logical to tell Henry, 'I\u2019m gonna just leave you as secretary of state and upgrade Brent Scowcroft.'\" Kissinger left office as Secretary of State when Democrat Jimmy Carter defeated Ford in the 1976 presidential election.\nKissinger continued to participate in policy groups, such as the Trilateral Commission, and to maintain political consulting, speaking, and writing engagements. In 1978, he was secretly involved in thwarting efforts by the Carter administration to indict three Chilean intelligence agents for masterminding the 1976 assassination of Orlando Letelier. Kissinger was critical of the foreign policy of the Jimmy Carter administration, saying in 1980 that \"has managed the extraordinary feat of having, at one and the same time, the worst relations with our allies, the worst relations with our adversaries, and the most serious upheavals in the developing world since the end of the Second World War.\"\nAfter Kissinger left office in 1977, he was offered an endowed chair at Columbia University, which was met with student opposition. Kissinger instead accepted a position at Georgetown University's Center for Strategic and International Studies. He taught at Georgetown's Edmund Walsh School of Foreign Service for several years in the late 1970s. In 1982, with the help of a loan from the international banking firm of E.M. Warburg, Pincus and Company, Kissinger founded a consulting firm, Kissinger Associates, and was a partner in affiliate Kissinger McLarty Associates with Mack McLarty, former chief of staff to President Bill Clinton. He also served on the board of directors of Hollinger International, a Chicago-based newspaper group, and as of March 1999, was a director of Gulfstream Aerospace.\nIn September 1989, \"The Wall Street Journal\"'s John Fialka disclosed that Kissinger took a direct economic interest in U.S.\u2013China relations in March 1989 with the establishment of China Ventures, Inc., a Delaware limited partnership, of which he was chairman of the board and chief executive officer. A US$75\u00a0million investment in a joint venture with the Communist Party government's primary commercial vehicle at the time, China International Trust &amp; Investment Corporation (CITIC), was its purpose. Board members were major clients of Kissinger Associates. Kissinger was criticized for not disclosing his role in the venture when called upon by ABC's Peter Jennings to comment the morning after the June 4, 1989, Tiananmen Square massacre. Kissinger's position was generally supportive of Deng Xiaoping's decision to use the military against the demonstrating students and he opposed economic sanctions.\nFrom 1995 to 2001, Kissinger served on the board of directors for Freeport-McMoRan, a multinational copper and gold producer with significant mining and milling operations in Papua, Indonesia. In February 2000, president of Indonesia Abdurrahman Wahid appointed Kissinger as a political advisor. He also served as an honorary advisor to the United States-Azerbaijan Chamber of Commerce.\nIn 1998, in response to the 2002 Winter Olympic bid scandal, the International Olympic Committee formed a commission, called the \"2000 Commission\", to recommend reforms, which Kissinger served on. This service led in 2000 to his appointment as one of five IOC \"honor members\", a category the organization described as granted to \"eminent personalities from outside the IOC who have rendered particularly outstanding services to it\".\nKissinger served as the 22nd Chancellor of the College of William and Mary from 2000 to 2005. He was preceded by former British prime minister Margaret Thatcher and succeeded by Justice Sandra Day O'Connor. The College of William &amp; Mary also owns a painted portrait of Kissinger that was painted by Ned Bittinger.\nFrom 2000 to 2006, Kissinger served as chairman of the board of trustees of Eisenhower Fellowships. In 2006, upon his departure from Eisenhower Fellowships, he received the Dwight D. Eisenhower Medal for Leadership and Service.\nIn November 2002, he was appointed by President George W. Bush to chair the newly established National Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States to investigate the September 11 attacks. Kissinger stepped down as chairman on December 13, 2002, rather than reveal his business client list, when queried about potential conflicts of interest.\nIn January 2007, Kissinger delivered a eulogy for Gerald Ford, one of the U.S. presidents he served, at Ford's state funeral in the Washington National Cathedral.\nIn April 2008 Kissinger gave a eulogy for the conservative author and founder of the National Review, William F. Buckley at the latter's memorial service at St. Patrick's Cathedral in New York City.\nIn the Rio Tinto espionage case of 2009\u20132010, Kissinger was paid US$5\u00a0million to advise the multinational mining company how to distance itself from an employee who had been arrested in China for bribery.\nKissinger\u2014along with William Perry, Sam Nunn, and George Shultz\u2014called upon governments to embrace the vision of a world free of nuclear weapons, and in three op-eds in \"The Wall Street Journal\" proposed an ambitious program of urgent steps to that end. The four created the Nuclear Threat Initiative to advance this agenda. In 2010, the four were featured in a documentary film entitled \"Nuclear Tipping Point\". The film is a visual and historical depiction of the ideas laid forth in \"The Wall Street Journal\" op-eds and reinforces their commitment to a world without nuclear weapons and the steps that can be taken to reach that goal.\nOn November 17, 2016, Kissinger met with President-elect Donald Trump during which they discussed global affairs. Kissinger also met with President Trump at the White House in May 2017.\nIn an interview with Charlie Rose on August 17, 2017, Kissinger said about President Trump: \"I'm hoping for an Augustinian moment, for St. Augustine\u00a0... who in his early life followed a pattern that was quite incompatible with later on when he had a vision, and rose to sainthood. One does not expect the president to become that, but it's conceivable\". Kissinger also argued that Russian president Vladimir Putin wanted to weaken Hillary Clinton, not elect Donald Trump. Kissinger said that Putin \"thought\u2014wrongly incidentally\u2014that she would be extremely confrontational\u00a0... I think he tried to weaken the incoming president [Clinton]\".\nViews on U.S. foreign policy.\nYugoslav Wars.\nIn several articles of his and interviews that he gave during the Yugoslav Wars, he criticized the United States' policies in Southeast Europe, among other things for the recognition of Bosnia and Herzegovina as a sovereign state, which he described as a foolish act. Most importantly he dismissed the notion of Serbs and Croats being aggressors or separatist, saying that \"they can't be separating from something that has never existed\". In addition, he repeatedly warned the West against inserting itself into a conflict that has its roots at least hundreds of years back in time, and said that the West would do better if it allowed the Serbs and Croats to join their respective countries. Kissinger shared similarly critical views on Western involvement in Kosovo. In particular, he held a disparaging view of the Rambouillet Agreement:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The Rambouillet text, which called on Serbia to admit NATO troops throughout Yugoslavia, was a provocation, an excuse to start bombing. Rambouillet is not a document that any Serb could have accepted. It was a terrible diplomatic document that should never have been presented in that form.\nHowever, as the Serbs did not accept the Rambouillet text and NATO bombings started, he opted to support a continuation of the bombing as NATO's credibility was now at stake, but dismissed the use of ground forces in claiming that it was not worth it.\nIraq.\nIn 2006, it was reported in the book \"State of Denial\" by Bob Woodward that Kissinger met regularly with President George W. Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney to offer advice on the Iraq War. Kissinger confirmed in recorded interviews with Woodward that the advice was the same as he had given in a column in \"The Washington Post\" on August 12, 2005: \"Victory over the insurgency is the only meaningful exit strategy.\" Kissinger also frequently met with U.S. Secretary of State Colin Powell, whom he warned that Coalition Provisional Authority Director L. Paul Bremer was \"a control freak\".\nIn an interview on the BBC's \"Sunday AM\" on November 19, 2006, Kissinger was asked whether there was any hope left for a clear military victory in Iraq and responded, \"If you mean by 'military victory' an Iraqi government that can be established and whose writ runs across the whole country, that gets the civil war under control and sectarian violence under control in a time period that the political processes of the democracies will support, I don't believe that is possible.\u00a0... I think we have to redefine the course. But I don't believe that the alternative is between military victory as it had been defined previously, or total withdrawal.\"\nIn an interview with Peter Robinson of the Hoover Institution on April 3, 2008, Kissinger reiterated that even though he supported the 2003 invasion of Iraq, he thought that the George W. Bush administration rested too much of its case for war on Saddam's supposed weapons of mass destruction. Robinson noted that Kissinger had criticized the administration for invading with too few troops, for disbanding the Iraqi Army as part of de-Baathification, and for mishandling relations with certain allies.\nIndia.\nKissinger said in April 2008 that \"India has parallel objectives to the United States\", and he called the nation an ally of the U.S.\nChina.\nKissinger attended the opening ceremony of the 2008 Beijing Summer Olympics. A few months before the Games opened, as controversy over China's human rights record was intensifying due to criticism by Amnesty International and other groups of the widespread use of the death penalty and other issues, Kissinger told China's official press agency Xinhua: \"I think one should separate Olympics as a sporting event from whatever political disagreements people may have had with China. I expect that the games will proceed in the spirit for which they were designed, which is friendship among nations, and that other issues are discussed in other forums.\" He said China had made huge efforts to stage the Games. \"Friends of China should not use the Olympics to pressure China now.\" He added that he would bring two of his grandchildren to watch the Games and planned to attend the opening ceremony. During the Games, he participated with Australian swimmer Ian Thorpe, film star Jackie Chan, and former British prime minister Tony Blair at a Peking University forum on the qualities that make a champion. He sat with his wife Nancy Kissinger, President George W. Bush, former president George H. W. Bush, and Foreign Minister Yang Jiechi at the men's basketball game between China and the U.S.\nIn 2011, Kissinger published \"On China\", chronicling the evolution of Sino-American relations and laying out the challenges to a partnership of \"genuine strategic trust\" between the U.S. and China. In this book \"On China\" and his 2014 book \"World Order\", as well as in his 2018 interview with \"Financial Times\", Kissinger consistently stated that he believed that China wants to restore its historic role as the Middle Kingdom and be \"the principal adviser to all humanity\".\nIn 2020, during a period of worsening Sino-American relations caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, the Hong Kong protests, and the U.S.\u2013China trade war, Kissinger expressed concerns that the United States and China are entering a Second Cold War and will eventually become embroiled in a military conflict similar to World War I. He called for Chinese leader Xi Jinping and the incoming U.S. president-elect Joe Biden to take a less confrontational foreign policy. Kissinger previously said that a potential war between China and the United States would be \"worse than the world wars that ruined European civilization\".\nIn July 2023, Kissinger traveled to Beijing to meet with Chinese Defense Minister Li Shangfu, who was sanctioned by the U.S. government in 2018 for engaging in the purchase of combat aircraft from a Russian arms exporter. Kissinger emphasized Sino-American relations in the meeting, stating that \"the United States and China should eliminate misunderstandings, coexist peacefully, and avoid confrontation\". Later that trip, Kissinger met with Xi with the intention of defrosting relations between the U.S. and China.\nIran.\nKissinger's position on this issue of U.S.\u2013Iran talks was reported by the \"Tehran Times\" to be that \"Any direct talks between the U.S. and Iran on issues such as the nuclear dispute would be most likely to succeed if they first involved only diplomatic staff and progressed to the level of secretary of state before the heads of state meet.\" In 2016, Kissinger said that the biggest challenge facing the Middle East is the \"potential domination of the region by an Iran that is both imperial and jihadist\". He further wrote in August 2017 that if the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps of Iran and its Shiite allies were allowed to fill the territorial vacuum left by a militarily defeated Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant, the region would be left with a land corridor extending from Iran to the Levant \"which could mark the emergence of an Iranian radical empire\". Commenting on the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, Kissinger said that he would not have agreed to it, but that Trump's plan to end the agreement after it was signed would \"enable the Iranians to do more than us\".\n2014 Ukrainian crisis.\nOn March 5, 2014, \"The Washington Post\" published an op-ed piece by Kissinger, 11 days before the Crimean status referendum on whether Crimea should officially keep being a part of Ukraine or join Russia. In it, he attempted to balance the Ukrainian, Russian, and Western desires for a functional state. He made four main points:\nKissinger also wrote: \"The west speaks Ukrainian; the east speaks mostly Russian. Any attempt by one wing of Ukraine to dominate the other\u2014as has been the pattern\u2014would lead eventually to civil war or break up.\"\nFollowing the publication of his book titled \"World Order\", Kissinger participated in an interview with Charlie Rose and updated his position on Ukraine, which he saw as a possible geographical mediator between Russia and the West. In a question he posed to himself for illustration regarding re-conceiving policy regarding Ukraine, Kissinger stated: \"If Ukraine is considered an outpost, then the situation is that its eastern border is the NATO strategic line, and NATO will be within of Volgograd. That will never be accepted by Russia. On the other hand, if the Russian western line is at the border of Poland, Europe will be permanently disquieted. The Strategic objective should have been to see whether one can build Ukraine as a bridge between East and West, and whether one can do it as a kind of a joint effort.\"\nIn December 2016, Kissinger advised President-elect Donald Trump to accept \"Crimea as a part of Russia\" in an attempt to secure a rapprochement between the United States and Russia, whose relations soured as a result of the Crimean crisis. When asked if he explicitly considered Russia's sovereignty over Crimea legitimate, Kissinger answered in the affirmative, reversing the position he took in his \"Washington Post\" op-ed.\nComputers and nuclear weapons.\nIn 2019, Kissinger wrote about the increasing tendency to give control of nuclear weapons to computers operating with artificial intelligence (AI) that: \"Adversaries' ignorance of AI-developed configurations will become a strategic advantage\". Kissinger argued that giving power to launch nuclear weapons to computers using algorithms to make decisions would eliminate the human factor and give the advantage to the state that had the most effective AI system as a computer can make decisions about war and peace far faster than any human ever could. Just as an AI-enhanced computer can win chess games by anticipating human decision-making, an AI-enhanced computer could be useful in a crisis as in a nuclear war, the side that strikes first would have the advantage by destroying the opponent's nuclear capacity. Kissinger also noted there was always the danger that a computer could make a decision to start a nuclear war before diplomacy had been exhausted, or for a reason that would not be understandable to the operators. Kissinger also warned the use of AI to control nuclear weapons would impose \"opacity\" on the decision-making process as the algorithms that control the AI system are not readily understandable, destabilizing the decision-making process:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nCOVID-19 pandemic.\nOn April 3, 2020, Kissinger shared his diagnostic view of the COVID-19 pandemic, saying that it threatens the \"liberal world order\". Kissinger added that the virus does not know borders although global leaders are trying to address the crisis on a mainly national basis. He stressed that the key is not a purely national effort but greater international cooperation.\nRussian invasion of Ukraine.\nIn May 2022, speaking to the World Economic Forum on the Russian invasion of Ukraine, Kissinger advocated for a diplomatic settlement that would restore the \"status quo ante bellum\", effectively ceding Crimea and parts of Donbas to Russian control. Kissinger urged Ukrainians to \"match the heroism they have shown with wisdom\", arguing that \"[p]ursuing the war beyond that point would not be about the freedom of Ukraine, but a new war against Russia itself.\" He spoke to Edward Luce and a \"Financial Times\" audience in the same month. Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy rejected Kissinger's suggestions, saying Ukraine would not agree to peace until Russia agreed to return Crimea and the Donbas region to Ukraine.\nOn a book tour to sell \"Leadership: Six Studies in World Strategy\" in July 2022 he spoke to Judy Woodruff of PBS and he was still of the opinion that \"a negotiation is desirable\" and clarified his earlier statements, saying that he supported a ceasefire line on the borders of February 24 and that \"Russia should not gain anything from the war... Ukraine above all cannot give up territory that it had when the war started because this would be symbolically dangerous.\"\nOn January 18, 2023, Kissinger was interviewed by Graham Allison for a World Economic Forum audience; he said that U.S. support should be intensified until either the February 24 borders are reached or the February 24 borders are recognized, upon which time under a ceasefire agreement negotiations would begin. Kissinger felt that Russia needs to be given an opportunity to rejoin the comity of nations while the sanctions are maintained until final settlement is reached. He expressed his admiration for President Zelenskyy and lauded the heroic conduct of the Ukrainian people. Kissinger felt that the invasion has \"ipso facto\" its logical outcome pointed to NATO membership for Ukraine at the end of the peace process.\nIn September 2023, Kissinger met with Volodymyr Zelenskyy in New York City, on which occasion they discussed his change in position on Ukraine's NATO membership ambitions.\nIn September 2023, Kissinger also presented a reformulated response endorsing Ukraine's NATO membership as an \u201cappropriate outcome,\u201d which could be seen as a substantial boost to the transatlantic aspirations of embattled Ukraine.\nGaza war.\nIn a statement made a month before his death, Kissinger responded to the October 7 attacks and outbreak of the Gaza war by saying that the goals of Hamas \"can only be to mobilize the Arab world against Israel and to get off the track of peaceful negotiations\". In response to celebrations of the attack by some Arabs in Germany, he issued a statement denouncing Muslim immigration into Germany: \"It was a grave mistake to let in so many people of totally different culture and religion and concepts, because it creates a pressure group inside each country that does that.\"\nPublic perception.\nA 2014 poll of American international relations scholars conducted by the College of William &amp; Mary ranked Kissinger as the most effective Secretary of State in the 50 years prior to 2015. In 1972, \"Time\" commented that \"a streak of suspicion seems to underlie all that he does\" and \"His jokes about his paranoia have an uncomfortable edge of truth\". He was so often seen escorting Hollywood starlets that the \"Village Voice\" charged he was \"a secret square posing as a swinger\". The insight, \"Power is the ultimate aphrodisiac\", is widely attributed to him, although Kissinger was paraphrasing Napoleon Bonaparte. \nHistorian Jeffrey Kimball developed the theory that Kissinger and the Nixon administration accepted a South Vietnamese collapse provided a face-saving decent interval passed between U.S. withdrawal and defeat. In his first meeting with Zhou Enlai in 1971, Kissinger \"laid out in detail the settlement terms that would produce such a delayed defeat: total American withdrawal, return of all American POWs, and a ceasefire-in-place for '18 months or some period'\", in the words of historian Ken Hughes. On October 6, 1972, Kissinger told Nixon twice that the terms of the Paris Peace Accords would probably destroy South Vietnam: \"I also think that Thieu is right, that our terms will eventually destroy him.\" However, Kissinger denied using a \"decent interval\" strategy, writing \"All of us who negotiated the agreement of October 12 were convinced that we had vindicated the anguish of a decade not by a 'decent interval' but by a decent settlement.\" Johannes Kadura offers a positive assessment of Nixon and Kissinger's strategy, arguing that the two men \"simultaneously maintained a Plan A of further supporting Saigon and a Plan B of shielding Washington should their maneuvers prove futile.\" According to Kadura, the \"decent interval\" concept has been \"largely misrepresented\", in that Nixon and Kissinger \"sought to gain time, make the North turn inward, and create a perpetual equilibrium\" rather than acquiescing in the collapse of South Vietnam.\nKissinger's record was brought up during the 2016 Democratic Party presidential primaries. Hillary Clinton had cultivated a close relationship with Kissinger, describing him as a \"friend\" and a source of \"counsel\". During the Democratic primary debates, Clinton touted Kissinger's praise for her record as secretary of state. In response, candidate Bernie Sanders criticized Kissinger and said: \"I am proud to say that Henry Kissinger is not my friend. I will not take advice from Henry Kissinger.\"\nKissinger was an immensely beloved figure within China, with \"China News Service\" describing him in his obituary as someone \"who had a sharp vision and a thorough understanding of world affairs\".\nLegacy and reception.\nKissinger has generally received a polarizing reception; some have portrayed him as a strategic genius who was willing to act in a utilitarian manner, others have portrayed his foreign policy decisions as immoral and profoundly damaging in the long run.\nPositive views.\nHistorian Niall Ferguson has argued that Kissinger is one of the most effective secretaries of state in American history. The editorial board of \"The Wall Street Journal\" stated in the aftermath of his death \"Kissinger was a target of both the right and left in those perilous Cold War years, often unfairly\". The article noted that he was often criticized by American conservatives for overlooking human rights in China, while saying \"he had no illusions about the Communist Party or its nationalist ambitions. His view was that the U.S. and China had to achieve some \"modus vivendi\" to avoid war despite their profound cultural and political differences\" while claiming that \"the alternatives then, as now, weren't usually [democracy advocates] of the left's imagining. They were often Communists who would have aligned themselves with the Soviets ... . The U.S. provided covert aid to Allende's political opponents, but declassified briefings from the time show the U.S. was unaware of the military coup that deposed him. Kissinger wasn't responsible for Augusto Pinochet's coup or its bloody excesses. Chile eventually became a democracy ... Cuba remains a dictatorship.\"\nNegative views.\nA number of journalists, activists, and human rights lawyers accused Kissinger of being responsible for war crimes during his tenure in government. Some sought civil and even criminal penalties against Kissinger, but none of these attempts were successful. In September 2001, relatives and survivors of General Rene Schneider filed civil proceedings in federal court in Washington, D.C. The suit was later dismissed. In April 2002, a petition for Kissinger's arrest was filed in the High Court of Justice in London by human rights campaigner Peter Tatchell, citing the destruction of civilian populations and the environment in Indochina during the years 1969\u20131975. The petition was rejected one day after filing.\nOne of his most prominent critics was American-British journalist and author Christopher Hitchens. Hitchens authored \"The Trial of Henry Kissinger\", in which he called for the prosecution of Kissinger \"for war crimes, for crimes against humanity, and for offenses against common or customary or international law, including conspiracy to commit murder, kidnap, and torture\". American chef and TV personality Anthony Bourdain wrote in \"A Cook's Tour\": \"Once you've been to Cambodia, you'll never stop wanting to beat Henry Kissinger to death with your bare hands... Witness what [he] did... and you will never understand why he's not sitting in the dock at The Hague next to Milo\u0161evi\u0107.\"\nAuthor Robert D. Kaplan and historian Niall Ferguson have disputed these notions and argued that there is a double standard in how Kissinger is judged in comparison to others. They have defended Kissinger by arguing that American power to advocate for human rights in other nations is often counterproductive and limited, that taking into consideration geopolitical realities is an inevitable part of any effective foreign policy, and that there are utilitarian reasons to defend most of the decisions of his tenure.\nOther perspectives.\nSeveral historians have rejected both prominent reputations of Kissinger. David Greenberg argued that each are exaggerated caricatures that overstate both his genius and immorality: In fact, if there's a single word I'd apply to Kissinger, it's 'overrated.' He was overrated as a scholar (famous mainly for writing a very long dissertation). He was overrated as a strategist (he often gave bad advice, as he did in urging George W. Bush not to withdraw troops from Iraq). He was even overrated as a villain\u00a0\u2013 the 'Christopher Hitchenses' of the world loved to call him a 'war criminal,' but this was a fundamentally unserious charge. The Defense Department, not the State Department, prosecutes wars, and the president oversees it\u00a0\u2013 but the Hitchenses preferred to go after Kissinger rather than (Defense Secretaries) Mel Laird or James Schlesinger or even Nixon. Similarly, Mario Del Pero argued: He was not particularly original or bold, once we scratch away from his writings the deliberately opaque and convoluted prose he often used, possibly to try to render more original thoughts and reflections that were in reality fairly conventional. ... In short, he wasn't a war criminal, he wasn't a very deep or sophisticated thinker, he rarely challenged the intellectual vogues of the time (even because it would have meant to challenge those in power, something he always was\u2014and still is\u2014reluctant to do), and once in government he displayed a certain intellectual laziness vis-\u00e0-vis the intricacies and complexities of a world that he still tended to see in black-and-white.\nFamily and personal life.\nKissinger married Anneliese \"Ann\" Fleischer (born November 6, 1925, in F\u00fcrth, Germany) on February 6, 1949. They had two children, Elizabeth and David, and divorced in 1964. In 1955, he met Austrian poet Ingeborg Bachmann during a symposium at Harvard; the two had a romantic relationship that lasted several years. On March 30, 1974, he married Nancy Maginnes. They lived in Kent, Connecticut, and in New York City. Kissinger's son David served as an executive with NBC Universal Television Studio before becoming head of Conaco, Conan O'Brien's production company, in 2005. In February 1982, at the age of 58, Henry Kissinger underwent coronary bypass surgery. On May 27, 2023, he turned 100.\nSoccer.\nDaryl Grove characterized Kissinger as one of the most influential people in the growth of soccer in the United States. Kissinger was named chairman of the North American Soccer League board of directors in 1978. He helped bring Brazilian star Pel\u00e9 to the New York Cosmos after calling the Brazilian foreign minister and telling him that Pele's move to America would substantially improve relations between the United States and Brazil. Previously, the military dictatorship in Brazil had been reluctant to let a designated national treasure leave the country. In a 2023 interview, Kissinger said soccer was \"at the highest level complexity masquerading as simplicity.\"\nSince his childhood, Kissinger had been a fan of his hometown's soccer club, SpVgg F\u00fcrth (now SpVgg Greuther F\u00fcrth). Even during his time in office, the German Embassy informed him about the team's results every Monday morning. He was an honorary member with lifetime season tickets. In September 2012, Kissinger attended a home game in which Greuther F\u00fcrth lost 0\u20132 against Schalke, after promising years previously that he would attend a Greuther F\u00fcrth home game if they were promoted to the Bundesliga from the 2. Bundesliga. From 1989 onward, he was an honorary member of Bayern Munich.\nDeath.\nKissinger died from heart failure at his home in Kent, Connecticut, on November 29, 2023, at the age of 100. At the time of his death, he was the last living former U.S. Cabinet member who served in the Richard Nixon administration. He was survived by his wife, Nancy Maginnes Kissinger; two children, David and Elizabeth; and five grandchildren. His death was announced by Kissinger Associates, his consulting firm. Kissinger Associates announced that the funeral would be private. He was buried in Arlington National Cemetery.\nInternational reactions.\nKissinger was widely admired within China and praised by the Chinese Communist Party. Government figures on state media uniformly released posts mourning his death. Chinese social media expressed widespread sorrow after news of his death was released, and hashtags idolizing Kissinger became the most searched trend in China. \"China News Service\" stated in its obituary for Kissinger that \"Today, this 'old friend of the Chinese people,' who had a sharp vision and a thorough understanding of world affairs, has completed his legendary life\". China Central Television, the state broadcaster, called Kissinger a \"legendary diplomat\" and a \"living fossil\" who had witnessed the development of China-U.S. relations. Shortly before his death, Chinese president Xi Jinping stated: \"The Chinese people never forget their old friends, and Sino-U.S. relations will always be linked with the name of Henry Kissinger\".\nFormer British prime ministers mourned Kissinger. Tony Blair, the former leader of the Labour Party and prime minister of the United Kingdom, released a statement saying: \"There is no-one like Henry Kissinger... From the first time I met him as a new Labour Party opposition leader in 1994, struggling to form views on foreign policy, to the last occasion when I visited him in New York and, later, he spoke at my institute's annual gathering, I was in awe of him... If it is possible for diplomacy, at its highest level, to be a form of art, Henry was an artist.\" David Cameron stated \"He was a great statesman and a deeply respected diplomat who will be greatly missed on the world stage... Even at 100, his wisdom and thoughtfulness shone through\". Boris Johnson said: \"The world needs him now. If ever there was an author of peace and lover of concord, that man was Henry Kissinger\".\nEuropean Council president Charles Michel called Kissinger a \"strategist with attention to the smallest detail\" and \"a kind human and a brilliant mind who, over 100 years, shaped the [destinies] of some of the most important events of the century.\" Russian president Vladimir Putin stated in a telegram to Kissinger's widow Nancy that he was a \"wise and farsighted statesman\". Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu stated that he \"had the privilege of meeting Dr. Kissinger on numerous occasions, the most recent being just two months ago in New York. Each meeting with him was not just a lesson in diplomacy but also a masterclass in statesmanship. His understanding of the complexities of international relations and his unique insights into the challenges facing our world were unparalleled.\" German chancellor Olaf Scholz stated: \"The world has lost a great diplomat\".\nChile's ambassador to the United States, Juan Gabriel Vald\u00e9s, released a statement saying he possessed \"brilliance\" but also \"profound moral wretchedness\". This statement was reposted by President Gabriel Boric. The Bangladeshi foreign minister AK Abdul Momen said that Kissinger did \"inhumane things\", adding that \"he should have apologized to the people of Bangladesh for what he has done\".\nDomestic reactions.\nThe announcement of Kissinger's death saw a widespread mix of tribute and criticism on American social media.\nJoe Biden praised Kissinger's \"fierce intellect\" while noting that they often \"disagreed strongly\". Former president George W. Bush stated: \"America has lost one of the most dependable and distinctive voices on foreign affairs with the passing of Henry Kissinger. I have long admired the man who fled the Nazis as a young boy from a Jewish family, then fought them in the United States Army\". Cindy McCain, the widow of John McCain, wrote: \"Henry Kissinger was ever present in my late husband's life. While John was a prisoner of war, and in the later years, as a senator and statesman. The McCain family will miss his wit, charm, and intelligence terribly\".\nMany negative reactions to Kissinger's death argued his decisions in government violated American values. House of Representative members Jim McGovern, Gerry Connolly, and Greg Casar issued critical reactions to his death, with Connolly stating Kissinger's \"indifference to human suffering will forever tarnish his name and shape his legacy\". The front page of \"HuffPost\" labeled him \"The Beltway Butcher\", while another \"HuffPost\" article described him as \"America's Most Notorious War Criminal\". \"Teen Vogue\" mocked Kissinger with the headline: \"War Criminal Responsible for Millions of Deaths Dies at 100\", a statement similar to that of Nick Turse of \"The Intercept\". A CNN op-ed by Peter Bergen entitled \"Christopher Hitchens was right about Henry Kissinger\" stated that to Kissinger \"the ends almost always justified the means,\" referencing Hitchens's 2001 book \"The Trial of Henry Kissinger\". Socialist magazine \"Jacobin\" released a book-length anthology entitled \"The Good Die Young\". The introduction by historian Greg Grandin notes \"We all live now in the Kissingerian void.\"\nKissinger was defended by conservative commentator David Harsanyi in an op-ed on the \"New York Post\", where he stated that \"the left disgustingly dances on Kissinger's grave because it hates America\". \"The New York Sun\" also defended Kissinger, describing him as \"one of the most remarkable figures in American history\".\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\nBiographies.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nOther.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "13767", "revid": "42925431", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=13767", "title": "Hydra (genus)", "text": "Genus of cnidarians\nHydra ( ) is a genus of small freshwater hydrozoans of the phylum Cnidaria. They are solitary, carnivorous jellyfish-like animals, native to the temperate and tropical regions. The genus was named by Linnaeus in 1758 after the Hydra, the mythical many-headed beast that was defeated by Heracles, as when the animal has a part severed, it will regenerate much like the mythical Hydra's heads. Biologists are especially interested in \"Hydra\" because of their regenerative ability; they do not appear to die of old age, or to age at all.\nHabitat.\n\"Hydras\" are often found in freshwater bodies, but some \"Hydras\" are found in open water. They live attached to submerged rocks using a sticky secretion from their base. The genus \"Hydra\" occurs on all continents except for Antarctica and the Oceanic islands, though \"Hydras\" occur mainly in mesotrophic to eutrophic habitats.\nMorphology.\n\"Hydra\" has a tubular, radially symmetric body up to long when extended, secured by a simple adhesive foot known as the basal disc. Gland cells in the basal disc secrete a sticky fluid that accounts for its adhesive properties. \"Hydra\" has a body wall made up of the ectoderm and the endoderm, which are separated by an extracellular matrix called the \"mesoglea\".\nAt the free end of the body is a mouth opening surrounded by one to twelve thin, mobile tentacles. Each tentacle, or cnida (plural: \"cnidae\"), is clothed with highly specialised stinging cells called cnidocytes. Cnidocytes contain specialized structures called nematocysts, which look like miniature light bulbs with a coiled thread inside. The nematocysts are housed within a single epithelial cell together with a sensory and nerve cell. At the narrow outer edge of the cnidocyte is a short trigger hair called a cnidocil. Upon contact with prey, the contents of the nematocyst are explosively discharged due to hydrostatic pressure (the osmotic pressure exceeds a critical threshold), firing a dart-like thread containing neurotoxins into whatever triggered the release. This can paralyze the prey, especially if many hundreds of nematocysts are fired.\nIn \"Hydra\", different types of nematocysts are distinguished: the desmonemes for prey attachment; the isorhizas with spines in the interior of the nematocyst capsule and the spineless atrichous isorhizas; and the large stenoteles, with a prominent stylet apparatus at the tubule base employed for piercing cuticle structures.\n\"Hydra\" has two main body layers, which makes it diploblastic. The layers are separated by mesoglea, a gel-like substance. The outer layer is the epidermis, and the inner layer is called the gastrodermis, because it lines the stomach. The cells making up these two body layers are relatively simple. Hydramacin is a bactericide recently discovered in \"Hydra\"; it protects the outer layer against infection. A single \"Hydra\" is composed of 50,000 to 100,000 cells which consist of three specific stem cell populations that create many different cell types. These stem cells continually renew themselves in the body column\".\" \"Hydras\" have two significant structures on their body: the \"head\" and the \"foot\". When a \"Hydra\" is cut in half, each half regenerates and forms into a small \"Hydra\"; the \"head\" regenerates a \"foot\" and the \"foot\" regenerates a \"head\". If the \"Hydra\" is sliced into many segments then the middle slices form both a \"head\" and a \"foot\".\nRespiration and excretion occur by diffusion throughout the surface of the epidermis, while larger excreta are discharged through the mouth by a quick radial contraction of the body column.\nNervous system.\nThe nervous system of \"Hydra\" is a nerve net, composed of a few hundred to a few thousand neurons, which is structurally simple compared to more derived animal nervous systems. \"Hydra\" does not have a recognizable brain or true muscles. Nerve nets connect sensory photoreceptors and touch-sensitive nerve cells located in the body wall and tentacles.\nThe structure of the nerve net has two levels: \nSome have only two sheets of neurons.\nIt also has been described that there are three major networks extending throughout \"Hydra\"'s entire body. They are activated selectively during longitudinal contractions, elongations in response to light, and radial contractions; the additional network near the \"hypostome\", the dome-shaped jut surrounding the mouth aperture, is activated during nodding (the gentle swaying of the hypostome and its tentacles to one side).\nMotion and locomotion.\nIf \"Hydra\" are alarmed or attacked, the tentacles can be retracted to small buds, and the body column itself can be retracted to a small gelatinous sphere. \"Hydra\" generally react in the same way regardless of the direction of the stimulus, and this may be due to the simplicity of the nerve nets.\n\"Hydra\" are generally or sessile, but do occasionally move quite readily, especially when hunting. They have two distinct methods for moving: looping and somersaulting. They do this by bending over and attaching themselves to the with the mouth and tentacles and then relocate the foot, which provides the usual attachment, this process is called \"looping\". In somersaulting, the body then bends over and makes a new place of attachment with the foot. By this process of looping or somersaulting, a \"Hydra\" can move several inches (c.\u00a0100\u00a0mm) in a day. \"Hydra\" may also move by amoeboid motion of their bases or by detaching from the substrate and floating away in the current.\nA dark-habituated \"Hydra\" that is exposed to light will respond by elongating its body towards it, bending its hypostome-tentacle junction, and eventually somersaulting towards the light source.\nReproduction and life cycle.\nMost \"Hydras\" can reproduce sexually under certain conditions, though they typically choose to reproduce asexually instead. Unlike many members of the Hydrozoa, which alternate between the polyp form and the medusa form (the life stage where sexual reproduction occurs), \"Hydra\" never progress beyond the polyp phase in their life cycle. Instead, when food is plentiful, many \"Hydra\" opt to reproduce asexually by budding. A section of the body wall and an extension of the digestive cavity develop, creating a bud. The buds grow into miniature adults and break away when mature. When a \"Hydra\" is well fed, a new bud can form every two days.\nWhen conditions are harsh, often before winter or in poor feeding conditions, sexual reproduction then occurs in some \"Hydra\". Either the ovaries or testes develop from interstitial cells of the epidermis, resulting in swellings in the body wall. The testes release free-swimming gametes into the water, and these can fertilize the egg in the ovary of another individual. The fertilized eggs secrete a tough outer coating, and, as the adult dies (due to starvation or cold), these resting eggs fall to the bottom of the lake or pond to await better conditions, whereupon they hatch into nymph \"Hydra\". The male \"Hydra\" is typically smaller in size and bears 1 to 8 conical testes, while the female is larger and has 1 to 2 ovaries. Some \"Hydra\" species, like \"Hydra circumcincta\" and \"Hydra viridissima\", are hermaphrodites and may produce both testes and ovaries at the same time.\nFeeding.\nThe mouth of the \"Hydra\" is surrounded by four to eight tentacles. When feeding, \"Hydra\" extend their body to maximum length and then slowly extend their tentacles. The tentacles of \"Hydra\" are extensible and can be four to five times the length of the body. To search for prey, \"Hydra\" extends its tentacles and slowly maneuvers them, waiting for contact. Upon contact with a prey, the stenoteles discharges neurotoxins; the desmonemes on the tentacle (nematocysts) also discharge threads that coil around the prey. Most of the tentacles join in the attack within 30 seconds. Within two minutes, the tentacles move the prey into the open mouth aperture. Within ten minutes, the prey is engulfed and digestion commences. A \"Hydra\", with a column length of approximately 3\u201330 mm when extended and a width of about 1\u00a0mm, can stretch its body wall to digest prey more than twice its size. After 2\u20133 days, the indigestible remains will be discharged through the mouth aperture via contractions.The \"Hydra\"'s mouth is not permanent: When the \"Hydra\" closes its mouth, the cells surrounding the open mouth fuse together. These joints are then broken when the \"Hydra\" feeds again.\nMeasuring the feeding response.\nThe feeding response in \"Hydra\" is induced by glutathione (specifically in the reduced state as GSH) released from damaged tissue of injured prey. There are several methods conventionally used for quantification of the feeding response. In some, the duration for which the mouth remains open is measured. Other methods rely on counting the number of \"Hydra\" among a small population showing the feeding response after addition of glutathione. Recently, an assay for measuring the feeding response in \"Hydra\" has been developed. In this method, the linear two-dimensional distance between the tip of the tentacle and the mouth of \"Hydra\" was shown to be a direct measure of the extent of the feeding response. This method has been validated using a starvation model, as starvation is known to cause enhancement of the \"Hydra\" feeding response.\nEcology.\n\"Hydra\", as a carnivorous cnidarian, mainly feeds on small aquatic invertebrates. \"Hydra\" can also eat worms, young insects, larval mollusks, bluegill larvae, tiny crustaceans (e.g., \"Daphnia\", \"Cyclops\", \"ostracods\", cladocerans, and copepods), and algaes (e.g., \"Cocconeis placentula\", \"Cyclotella meneghineana\", and \"Navicula zanoni\"). Though some species of \"Hydra\" exist in a mutual relationship with various types of unicellular algae. The algae are protected from predators by \"Hydra\"; in return, photosynthetic products from the algae are beneficial as a food source to \"Hydra\" and even help to maintain the \"Hydra\" microbiome. One example is the \"Hydra viridissima\" (green hydra) having a symbiotic relationship with the green algae of the genus \"Chlorella\".\nThe species \"Hydra oligactis\" is preyed upon by the flatworm \"Microstomum lineare\". Some \"Coleps sp.\" have also been observed to attack \"Hydra\" polyps in groups, with them attacking \"Hydras\"' tentacles first before consuming the entire polyps. Some other common predators include carnivorous or omnivorous fishes such as guppies, bettas, and gouramis.\nTissue regeneration.\n\"Hydras\" undergo morphallaxis (tissue regeneration) when injured or severed. Typically, \"Hydras\" reproduce by just budding off a whole new individual; the bud occurs around two-thirds of the way down the body axis. When a \"Hydra\" is cut in half, each half regenerates and forms into a small \"Hydra\"; the \"head\" regenerates a \"foot\" and the \"foot\" regenerates a \"head\". This regeneration occurs without cell division. If the \"Hydra\" is sliced into many segments, the middle slices form both a \"head\" and a \"foot\". The polarity of the regeneration is explained by two pairs of positional value gradients. There is both a head and foot activation and inhibition gradient. The head activation and inhibition works in an opposite direction of the pair of foot gradients. The evidence for these gradients was shown in the early 1900s with grafting experiments. The inhibitors for both gradients have shown to be important to block the bud formation. The location where the bud forms is where the gradients are low for both the head and foot.\n\"Hydras\" are capable of regenerating from pieces of tissue from the body and additionally after tissue dissociation from reaggregates. This process takes place not only in the pieces of tissue excised from the body column, but also from re-aggregates of dissociated single cells. It was found that in these aggregates, cells initially distributed randomly undergo sorting and form two epithelial cell layers, in which the endodermal epithelial cells play more active roles in the process. Active mobility of these endodermal epithelial cells forms two layers in both the re-aggregate and the re-generating tip of the excised tissue. As these two layers are established, a patterning process takes place to form heads and feet.\nNon-senescence.\nDaniel Martinez claimed in an article in \"Experimental Gerontology\" in 1998 that \"Hydra\" are biologically immortal. This publication has been widely cited as evidence that \"Hydra\" do not senesce (do not age), and that they are proof of the existence of non-senescing organisms generally. In 2010, Preston Estep published (also in \"Experimental Gerontology\") a letter to the editor arguing that the Martinez data refutes the hypothesis that \"Hydra\" do not senesce.\nThe controversial unlimited lifespan of \"Hydra\" has attracted much attention from scientists. Research today appears to confirm Martinez's study. \"Hydra\" stem cells have a capacity for indefinite self-renewal. The transcription factor \"forkhead box O\" (FoxO) has been identified as a critical driver of the continuous self-renewal of \"Hydra\". In experiments, a drastically reduced population growth resulted from FoxO downregulation.\nIn bilaterally symmetrical organisms (Bilateria), the transcription factor FoxO affects stress response, lifespan, and increase in stem cells. If this transcription factor is knocked down in bilaterian model organisms, such as fruit flies and nematodes, their lifespan is significantly decreased. In experiments on \"H. vulgaris\" (a radially symmetrical member of phylum Cnidaria), when FoxO levels were decreased, there was a negative effect on many key features of the \"Hydra\", but no death was observed, thus it is believed other factors may contribute to the apparent lack of aging in these creatures.\nDNA repair.\n\"Hydras\" are capable of two types of DNA repair: nucleotide excision repair and base excision repair. The repair pathways facilitate DNA replication by removing DNA damage. Their identification in \"Hydra\" was based, in part, on the presence in its genome of genes homologous to ones present in other genetically well studied species playing key roles in these DNA repair pathways.\nGenomics.\n\"Hydra\" has more than 20,000 genes, along with a set of six actinoporin-like toxin genes found in its nematocysts. An ortholog comparison analysis done in 2013 demonstrated that \"Hydra\" share a minimum of 6,071 genes with humans. \"Hydra\" is becoming an increasingly better model system as more genetic approaches become available. Transgenic hydra have become attractive model organisms to study the evolution of immunity. A draft of the genome of \"Hydra magnipapillata\" was reported in 2010.\nThe genomes of cnidarians are usually less than 500 Mb (megabases) in size, as in the \"Hydra viridissima\" (green hydras), which has a genome size of approximately 300 Mb. In contrast, the genomes of brown hydras are approximately 1 Gb in size. This is because the brown hydra genome is the result of an expansion event involving LINEs, a type of transposable elements, in particular, a single family of the CR1 class. This expansion is unique to this subgroup of the genus \"Hydra\" and is absent in the green hydra, which has a repeating landscape similar to other cnidarians. These genome characteristics make \"Hydra\" attractive for studies of transposon-driven speciations and genome expansions.\nDue to the simplicity of their life cycle when compared to other hydrozoans, \"Hydras\" have lost many genes that correspond to cell types or metabolic pathways of which the ancestral function is still unknown. The ancestral Toll/TLR pathway, for example, is present in \"Anthozoa\", but the key upstream receptor component of it is missing or has diverged in \"Hydra.\" The genus \"Hydra\" is missing some genes associated with larvae development, fluorescent proteins, and circadian rhythms that are normally found in the sea anemone genome. The genes \"eve\" and \"emx\" are absent in \"Hydra\", even though they are present in \"Nematostella\" and hydrozoans. These genes are expressed during the larvae development. These losses in gene expression are thought to be signs of a substantial secondary gene loss during evolution.\n\"Hydra\" genome shows a preference towards proximal promoters. Thanks to this feature, many reporter cell lines have been created with regions around 500 to 2000 bases upstream of the gene of interest. Its cis-regulatory elements (CRE) are mostly located less than 2000 base pairs upstream from the closest transcription initiation site, but there are CREs located further away.\nIts chromatin has a Rabl configuration. There are interactions between the centromeres of different chromosomes and the centromeres and telomeres of the same chromosome. It presents a great number of intercentromeric interactions when compared to other cnidarians, probably due to the loss of multiple subunits of condensin II. It is organized in domains that span dozens to hundreds of megabases, containing epigenetically co-regulated genes and flanked by boundaries located within heterochromatin.\nTranscriptomics.\nDifferent \"Hydra\" cell types express gene families of different evolutionary ages. Progenitor cells (stem cells, neuron and nematocyst precursors, and germ cells) express genes from families that predate metazoans. Among differentiated cells some express genes from families that date from the base of metazoans, like gland and neuronal cells, and others express genes from newer families, originating from the base of cnidaria or medusozoa, like nematocysts. Interstitial cells contain translation factors with a function that has been conserved for at least 400 million years.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It was one of twelve constellations created by Petrus Plancius from the observations of Pieter Dirkszoon Keyser and Frederick de Houtman and it first appeared on a 35-cm (14\u00a0in) diameter celestial globe published in late 1597 (or early 1598) in Amsterdam by Plancius and Jodocus Hondius. The first depiction of this constellation in a celestial atlas was in Johann Bayer's Uranometria of 1603. The French explorer and astronomer Nicolas Louis de Lacaille charted the brighter stars and gave their Bayer designations in 1756. Its name means \"male water snake\", as opposed to Hydra, a much larger constellation that represents a female water snake. It remains below the horizon for most Northern Hemisphere observers.\nThe brightest star is the 2.8-magnitude Beta Hydri, also the closest reasonably bright star to the south celestial pole. Pulsating between magnitude 3.26 and 3.33, Gamma Hydri is a variable red giant 60 times the diameter of the Sun. Lying near it is VW Hydri, one of the brightest dwarf novae in the heavens. Four star systems in Hydrus have been found to have exoplanets to date, including HD 10180, which could bear up to nine planetary companions.\nHistory.\nHydrus was one of the twelve constellations established by the astronomer Petrus Plancius from the observations of the southern sky by the Dutch explorers Pieter Dirkszoon Keyser and Frederick de Houtman, who had sailed on the first Dutch trading expedition, known as the \"Eerste Schipvaart\", to the East Indies. It first appeared on a 35-cm (14\u00a0in) diameter celestial globe published in late 1597 (or early 1598) in Amsterdam by Plancius with Jodocus Hondius. The first depiction of this constellation in a celestial atlas was in the German cartographer Johann Bayer's \"Uranometria\" of 1603. De Houtman included it in his southern star catalogue the same year under the Dutch name \"De Waterslang\", \"The Water Snake\", it representing a type of snake encountered on the expedition rather than a mythical creature. The French explorer and astronomer Nicolas Louis de Lacaille called it \"l\u2019Hydre M\u00e2le\" on the 1756 version of his planisphere of the southern skies, distinguishing it from the feminine Hydra. The French name was retained by Jean Fortin in 1776 for his \"Atlas C\u00e9leste\", while Lacaille Latinised the name to Hydrus for his revised \"Coelum Australe Stelliferum\" in 1763.\nCharacteristics.\nIrregular in shape, Hydrus is bordered by Mensa to the southeast, Eridanus to the east, Horologium and Reticulum to the northeast, Phoenix to the north, Tucana to the northwest and west, and Octans to the south; Lacaille had shortened Hydrus' tail to make space for this last constellation he had drawn up. Covering 243 square degrees and 0.589% of the night sky, it ranks 61st of the 88 constellations in size. The three-letter abbreviation for the constellation, as adopted by the International Astronomical Union in 1922, is \"Hyi\". The official constellation boundaries, as set by Belgian astronomer Eug\u00e8ne Delporte in 1930, are defined by a polygon of 12 segments. In the equatorial coordinate system, the right ascension coordinates of these borders lie between 00h 06.1m and 04h 35.1m, while the declination coordinates are between \u221257.85\u00b0 and \u221282.06\u00b0. As one of the deep southern constellations, it remains below the horizon at latitudes north of the 30th parallel in the Northern Hemisphere, and is circumpolar at latitudes south of the 50th parallel in the Southern Hemisphere. Herman Melville mentions it and Argo Navis in \"Moby Dick\" \"beneath effulgent Antarctic Skies\", highlighting his knowledge of the southern constellations from whaling voyages. A line drawn between the long axis of the Southern Cross to Beta Hydri and then extended 4.5 times will mark a point due south. Hydrus culminates at midnight around 26 October.\nFeatures.\nStars.\nKeyzer and de Houtman assigned fifteen stars to the constellation in their Malay and Madagascan vocabulary, with a star that would be later designated as Alpha Hydri marking the head, Gamma the chest and a number of stars that were later allocated to Tucana, Reticulum, Mensa and Horologium marking the body and tail. Lacaille charted and designated 20 stars with the Bayer designations Alpha through to Tau in 1756. Of these, he used the designations Eta, Pi and Tau twice each, for three sets of two stars close together, and omitted Omicron and Xi. He assigned Rho to a star that subsequent astronomers were unable to find.\nBeta Hydri, the brightest star in Hydrus, is a yellow star of apparent magnitude 2.8, lying 24 light-years from Earth. It has about 104% of the mass of the Sun and 181% of the Sun's radius, with more than three times the Sun's luminosity. The spectrum of this star matches a stellar classification of G2\u00a0IV, with the luminosity class of 'IV' indicating this is a subgiant star. As such, it is a slightly more evolved star than the Sun, with the supply of hydrogen fuel at its core becoming exhausted. It is the nearest subgiant star to the Sun and one of the oldest stars in the solar neighbourhood. Thought to be between 6.4 and 7.1 billion years old, this star bears some resemblance to what the Sun may look like in the far distant future, making it an object of interest to astronomers. It is also the closest bright star to the south celestial pole.\nLocated at the northern edge of the constellation and just southwest of Achernar is Alpha Hydri, a white sub-giant star of magnitude 2.9, situated 72 light-years from Earth. Of spectral type F0IV, it is beginning to cool and enlarge as it uses up its supply of hydrogen. It is twice as massive and 3.3 times as wide as the Sun and 26 times more luminous. A line drawn between Alpha Hydri and Beta Centauri is bisected by the south celestial pole.\nIn the southeastern corner of the constellation is Gamma Hydri, a red giant of spectral type M2III located 214 light-years from Earth. It is a semi-regular variable star, pulsating between magnitudes 3.26 and 3.33. Observations over five years were not able to establish its periodicity. It is around 1.5 to 2 times as massive as the Sun, and has expanded to about 60 times the Sun's diameter. It shines with about 655 times the luminosity of the Sun. Located 3\u00b0 northeast of Gamma is the VW Hydri, a dwarf nova of the SU Ursae Majoris type. It is a close binary system that consists of a white dwarf and another star, the former drawing off matter from the latter into a bright accretion disk. These systems are characterised by frequent eruptions and less frequent supereruptions. The former are smooth, while the latter exhibit short \"superhumps\" of heightened activity. One of the brightest dwarf novae in the sky, it has a baseline magnitude of 14.4 and can brighten to magnitude 8.4 during peak activity. BL Hydri is another close binary system composed of a low-mass star and a strongly magnetic white dwarf. Known as a polar or AM Herculis variable, these produce polarized optical and infrared emissions and intense soft and hard X-ray emissions to the frequency of the white dwarf's rotation period\u2014in this case 113.6 minutes.\nThere are two notable optical double stars in Hydrus. Pi Hydri, composed of Pi1 Hydri and Pi2 Hydri, is divisible in binoculars. Around 476 light-years distant, Pi1 is a red giant of spectral type M1III that varies between magnitudes 5.52 and 5.58. Pi2 is an orange giant of spectral type K2III and shining with a magnitude of 5.7, around 488 light-years from Earth.\nEta Hydri is the other optical double, composed of Eta1 and Eta2. Eta1 is a blue-white main sequence star of spectral type B9V that was suspected of being variable, and is located just over 700 light-years away. Eta2 has a magnitude of 4.7 and is a yellow giant star of spectral type G8.5III around 218 light-years distant, which has evolved off the main sequence and is expanding and cooling on its way to becoming a red giant. Calculations of its mass indicate it was most likely a white A-type main sequence star for most of its existence, around twice the mass of the Sun. A planet, Eta2 Hydri b, greater than 6.5 times the mass of Jupiter was discovered in 2005, orbiting around Eta2 every 711 days at a distance of 1.93 astronomical units (AU).\nThree other systems have been found to have planets, most notably the Sun-like star HD 10180, which has seven planets, plus possibly an additional two for a total of nine\u2014as of 2012 more than any other system to date, including the Solar System. Lying around from the Earth, it has an apparent magnitude of 7.33.\nGJ 3021 is a solar twin\u2014a star very like the Sun\u2014around 57 light-years distant with a spectral type G8V and magnitude of 6.7. It has a Jovian planet companion (GJ 3021 b). Orbiting about 0.5\u00a0AU from its star, it has a minimum mass 3.37 times that of Jupiter and a period of around 133 days. The system is a complex one as the faint star GJ 3021B orbits at a distance of 68 AU; it is a red dwarf of spectral type M4V.\nHD 20003 is a star of magnitude 8.37. It is a yellow main sequence star of spectral type G8V a little cooler and smaller than the Sun around 143 light-years away. It has two planets that are around 12 and 13.5 times as massive as the Earth with periods of just under 12 and 34 days respectively.\nDeep-sky objects.\nHydrus contains only faint deep-sky objects. IC 1717 was a deep-sky object discovered by the Danish astronomer John Louis Emil Dreyer in the late 19th century. The object at the coordinate Dreyer observed is no longer there, and is now a mystery. It was very likely to have been a faint comet. PGC 6240, known as the White Rose Galaxy, is a giant spiral galaxy surrounded by shells resembling rose petals, located around 345 million light years from the Solar System. Unusually, it has cohorts of globular clusters of three distinct ages suggesting bouts of post-starburst formation following a merger with another galaxy. The constellation also contains a spiral galaxy, NGC 1511, which lies edge on to observers on Earth and is readily viewed in amateur telescopes.\nLocated mostly in Dorado, the Large Magellanic Cloud extends into Hydrus. The globular cluster NGC 1466 is an outlying component of the galaxy, and contains many RR Lyrae-type variable stars. It has a magnitude of 11.59 and is thought to be over 12 billion years old. Two stars, HD 24188 of magnitude 6.3 and HD 24115 of magnitude 9.0, lie nearby in its foreground. NGC 602 is composed of an emission nebula and a young, bright open cluster of stars that is an outlying component on the eastern edge of the Small Magellanic Cloud, a satellite galaxy to the Milky Way. Most of the cloud is located in the neighbouring constellation Tucana.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

In classical mythology, Hercules is famous for his strength and for his numerous far-ranging adventures.\nThe Romans adapted the Greek hero's iconography and myths for their literature and art under the name \"Hercules\". In later Western art and literature and in popular culture, \"Hercules\" is more commonly used than \"Heracles\" as the name of the hero. Hercules is a multifaceted figure with contradictory characteristics, which enabled later artists and writers to pick and choose how to represent him. This article provides an introduction to representations of Hercules in the later tradition.\nMythology.\nBirth and early life.\nIn Roman mythology, although Hercules was seen as the champion of the weak and a great protector, his personal problems started at birth. Juno sent two witches to prevent the birth, but they were tricked by one of Alcmene's servants and sent to another room. Juno then sent serpents to kill him in his cradle, but Hercules strangled them both. In one version of the myth, Alcmene abandoned her baby in the woods in order to protect him from Juno's wrath, but he was found by the goddess Minerva who brought him to Juno, claiming he was an orphan child left in the woods who needed nourishment. Juno suckled Hercules at her own breast until the infant bit her nipple, at which point she pushed him away, spilling her milk across the night sky and so forming the Milky Way. She then gave the infant back to Minerva and told her to take care of the baby herself. In feeding the child from her own breast, the goddess inadvertently imbued him with further strength and power.\nRoman era.\nThe Latin name \"Hercules\" was borrowed through Etruscan, where it is represented variously as Heracle, Hercle, and other forms. Hercules was a favorite subject for Etruscan art, and appears often on bronze mirrors. The Etruscan form \"Herceler\" derives from the Greek \"Heracles\" via syncope. A mild oath invoking Hercules (\"Hercule!\" or \"Mehercle!\") was a common interjection in Classical Latin. Though not native to Italic religion, Hercules had become a popular god amongst various Italic cultures, primarily in the south and center of Italy. Dionysius of Halicarnassus, a 1st-century BCE Greek historian, testifies to the popularity of Hercules, stating that \"one could scarcely find any place in Italy in which the god is not honored.\" Bronze statuettes dedicated to Hercules have been uncovered from sanctuaries throughout Samnium and the Apennines, with over a hundred such bronzes surfacing near a 3rd-century BCE sanctuary in Corfinium\u2014a Paelignian territory. The popularity of these bronzes may have stemmed from the supposedly militaristic cultures of the Samnites and the Marsi and perhaps mercenaries serving under Hippocrates of Gela. However, the classicist Karl Galinsky suggests that these statuettes may instead continue an earlier \"Mars\" type, which also depicted a warrior figure.\nAmongst the hundreds of known Sabellic votive statues of Hercules, a particularly common type\u2014referred to as \"Hercules in assault\"\u2014portrays a beardless Hercules posed in a manner akin to other warrior statuettes. Hercules is varyingly depicted with certain accompanying accoutrements\u2014in some figurines he is portrayed wielding a club, whereas others depict the hero holding the apples of the Hesperides. Depictions specifically of Hercules are distinguished by the presence of a lion skin on the figure. The \"Rorschach Hercules,\" a subtype of the aforementioned \"Hercules in assault,\" portrays the lion skin as a geometric shape resemblant of an ink blot. According to Karl Galinsky, it is likely that the \"Rorschach\" style derives from local Italic artistic customs, in contrast to an alternative Hellenized style, in which the distinct muscles of the body were emphasized and the lion skin was depicted in a less abstract manner.\nAccording to Macrobius, a 5th-century CE Roman historian, the earlier author Varro\u2014who lived in the 1st-century BCE\u2014had claimed the Hercules was the same as Mars. Confusion between the two deities may have resulted from the agrarian associations of both gods. In the Oscan Agnone tablet, Hercules is mentioned with the epithet , equivalent to Latin , itself a reference to Ceres\u2014the Roman goddess of agriculture. Certain places dedicated to Hercules across southern Italy may be associated with prominent agricultural and transhumance routes, such as in Alba Fucens, where a deity referred to as (\"Hercules of Salt\") was honored. According to the archaeologist Annalisa Marzano, the connection with salt may have itself related to the importance of salt in cheese production and food preservation, both of which are themselves vital for animal husbandry.\nHowever, the archaeologist Tesse Stek notes that various sanctuaries of Hercules are not easily connectable with transhumance routes. For instance, a sanctuary of Hercules in Campochiaro is located above the Boiano basin on the side of a mountain and is therefore\u2014according to Stek\u2014not easily accessible to any pastoralists. Stek further notes that the primary archaeological evidence for a relationship between Hercules and transhumance dates to the 2nd-century BCE\u2014after Hercules had already become a prominent deity in Italic religions. It is perhaps possible that these 2nd-century BCE sites could preserve the functions of older religious sanctuaries, though Stek states that there is no \"self-evident\" justification for asserting such continuity. Likewise, the classicist Guy Bradley doubts the supposed pastoralist role of these sanctuaries, noting that these sanctuaries could easily have served the needs of any of the other traders, artisans, or travelers who utilized these roads, not exclusively farmers. Additionally, Bradley argues that the monumentalization of these temples required a level of financial power that was likely unavailable to Samnite shepherds.\nHercules had a number of myths that were distinctly Roman. One of these is Hercules's defeat of Cacus, who was terrorizing the countryside of Rome. The hero was associated with the Aventine Hill through his son Aventinus. Mark Antony considered him a personal patron god, as did the emperor Commodus. Hercules received various forms of religious veneration, including as a deity concerned with children and childbirth, in part because of myths about his precocious infancy, and in part because he fathered countless children. Roman brides wore a special belt tied with the \"knot of Hercules\", which was supposed to be hard to untie. The comic playwright Plautus presents the myth of Hercules's conception as a sex comedy in his play \"Amphitryon\"; Seneca wrote the tragedy \"Hercules Furens\" about his bout with madness. During the Roman Imperial era, Hercules was worshipped locally from Hispania through Gaul.\nGermanic association.\nTacitus records a special affinity of the Germanic peoples for Hercules. In chapter 3 of his \"Germania\", Tacitus states:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;... they say that Hercules, too, once visited them; and when going into battle, they sang of him first of all heroes. They have also those songs of theirs, by the recital of this \"barditus\" as they call it, they rouse their courage, while from the note they augur the result of the approaching conflict. For, as their line shouts, they inspire or feel alarm.\nSome have taken this as Tacitus equating the Germanic \"\u00deunraz\" with Hercules by way of \"interpretatio romana\".\nIn the Roman era Hercules' Club amulets appear from the 2nd to 3rd century, distributed over the empire (including Roman Britain, cf. Cool 1986), mostly made of gold, shaped like wooden clubs. A specimen found in K\u00f6ln-Nippes bears the inscription [culi]\", confirming the association with Hercules.\nIn the 5th to 7th centuries, during the Migration Period, the amulet is theorized to have rapidly spread from the Elbe Germanic area across Europe. These Germanic \"Donar's Clubs\" were made from deer antler, bone or wood, more rarely also from bronze or precious metals. The amulet type is replaced by the Viking Age Thor's hammer pendants in the course of the Christianization of Scandinavia from the 8th to 9th century.\nLate ancient and medieval mythography.\nAfter the Roman Empire became Christianized, mythological narratives were often reinterpreted as allegory, influenced by the philosophy of late antiquity. In the 4th century, Servius had described Hercules's return from the underworld as representing his ability to overcome earthly desires and vices, or the earth itself as a consumer of bodies. In some early patristic texts, Hercules was identified with the biblical figure Samson.\nIn medieval mythography, Hercules was one of the heroes seen as a strong role model who demonstrated both valor and wisdom, while the monsters he battles were regarded as moral obstacles. One glossator noted that when Hercules became a constellation, he showed that strength was necessary to gain entrance to Heaven.\nMedieval mythography was written almost entirely in Latin, and original Greek texts were little used as sources for Hercules's myths.\nRenaissance mythography.\nThe Renaissance and the invention of the printing press brought a renewed interest in and publication of Greek literature. Renaissance mythography drew more extensively on the Greek tradition of Heracles, typically under the Romanized name Hercules, or the alternate name Alcides. In a chapter of his book \"Mythologiae\" (1567), the influential mythographer Natale Conti collected and summarized an extensive range of myths concerning the birth, adventures, and death of the hero under his Roman name Hercules. Conti begins his lengthy chapter on Hercules with an overview description that continues the moralizing impulse of the Middle Ages:\nHercules, who subdued and destroyed monsters, bandits, and criminals, was justly famous and renowned for his great courage. His great and glorious reputation was worldwide, and so firmly entrenched that he'll always be remembered. In fact the ancients honored him with his own temples, altars, ceremonies, and priests. But it was his wisdom and great soul that earned those honors; noble blood, physical strength, and political power just aren't good enough.\nIn 1600, the citizens of Avignon bestowed on Henry of Navarre (the future King Henry IV of France) the title of the \"Hercule Gaulois\" (\"Gallic Hercules\"), justifying the extravagant flattery with a genealogy that traced the origin of the House of Navarre to a nephew of Hercules's son Hispalus.\nWorship.\nRoad of Hercules.\nThe Road of Hercules is a route across Southern Gaul that is associated with the path Hercules took during his 10th labor of retrieving the Cattle of Geryon from the Red Isles. Hannibal took the same path on his march towards Italy and encouraged the belief that he was the second Hercules. Primary sources often make comparisons between Hercules and Hannibal. Hannibal further tried to invoke parallels between himself and Hercules by starting his march on Italy by visiting the shrine of Hercules at Gades. While crossing the alps, he performed labors in a heroic manner. A famous example was noted by Livy, when Hannibal fractured the side of a cliff that was blocking his march.\nWorship from women.\nIn ancient Roman society women were usually limited to two types of cults: those that addressed feminine matters such as childbirth, and cults that required virginal chastity. However, there is evidence suggesting there were female worshippers of Apollo, Mars, Jupiter, and Hercules. Some scholars believe that women were completely prohibited from any of Hercules's cults. Others believe it was only the \"Ara Maxima\" at which they were not allowed to worship. Macrobius in his first book of \"Saturnalia\" paraphrases from Varro: \"For when Hercules was bringing the cattle of Geryon through Italy, a woman replied to the thirsty hero that she could not give him water because it was the day of the Goddess Women and it was unlawful for a man to taste what had been prepared for her. Hercules, therefore, when he was about to offer a sacrifice forbid the presence of women and ordered Potitius and Pinarius who were in charge of his rites, not to allow any women from taking part\". Macrobius states that women were restricted in their participation in Hercules cults, but to what extent remains ambiguous. He mentions that women were not allowed to participate in Sacrum which is general term used to describe anything that was believed to have belonged to the gods. This could include anything from a precious item to a temple. Due to the general nature of a Sacrum, we can not judge the extent of the prohibition from Macrobius alone. There are also ancient writings on this topic from Aulus Gellius when speaking on how Romans swore oaths. He mentioned that Roman women do not swear on Hercules, nor do Roman men swear on Castor. He went on to say that women refrain from sacrificing to Hercules. Propertius in his poem 4.9 also mentions similar information as Macrobius. This is evidence that he was also using Varro as a source.\nWorship in myth.\nThere is evidence of Hercules worship in myth in the Latin epic poem, the \"Aeneid\". In the 8th book of the poem Aeneas finally reaches the future site of Rome, where he meets Evander and the Arcadians making sacrifices to Hercules on the banks of the Tiber river. They share a feast, and Evander tells the story of how Hercules defeated the monster Cascus, and describes him as a triumphant hero. Translated from the Latin text of Vergil, Evander stated: \"Time brought to us in our time of need the aid and arrival of a god. For there came that mightiest avenger, the victor Hercules, proud with the slaughter and the spoils of threefold Geryon, and he drove the mighty bulls here, and the cattle filled both valley and riverside.\nHercules was also mentioned in the Fables of Gaius Julius Hyginus. For example, in his fable about Philoctetes he tells the story of how Philoctetes built a funeral pyre for Hercules so his body could be consumed and raised to immortality.\nHercules and the Roman triumph.\nAccording to Livy (9.44.16) Romans were commemorating military victories by building statues to Hercules as early as 305 BCE. Also, philosopher Pliny the Elder dates Hercules worship back to the time of Evander, by accrediting him with erecting a statue in the Forum Boarium of Hercules. Scholars agree that there would have been 5\u20137 temples in Augustan Rome. There are believed to be related Republican \"triumphatores\", however, not necessarily triumphal dedications. There are two temples located in the Campus Martius. One, being the Temple of Hercules Musarum, dedicated between 187 and 179 BCE by M. Fulvius Nobilior. And the other being the Temple of Hercules Custos, likely renovated by Sulla in the 80s BCE.\nIn art.\nIn Roman works of art and in Renaissance and post-Renaissance art, Hercules can be identified by his attributes, the lion skin and the gnarled club (his favorite weapon); in mosaic he is shown tanned bronze, a virile aspect.\nIn the twentieth century, the \"Farnese Hercules\" has inspired artists such as Jeff Koons, Matthew Darbyshire and Robert Mapplethorpe to reinterpret Hercules for new audiences. The choice of deliberately white materials by Koons and Darbyshire has been interpreted as perpetuation of colourism in how the classical world is viewed. Mapplethorpe's work with black model Derrick Cross can be seen as a reaction to Neo-classical colourism, resisting the portrayal of Hercules as white.\nIn numismatics.\nHercules was among the earliest figures on ancient Roman coinage, and has been the main motif of many collector coins and medals since. One example is the Austrian 20 euro Baroque Silver coin issued on September 11, 2002. The obverse side of the coin shows the Grand Staircase in the town palace of Prince Eugene of Savoy in Vienna, currently the Austrian Ministry of Finance. Gods and demi-gods hold its flights, while Hercules stands at the turn of the stairs.\nMilitary.\nSix successive ships of the British Royal Navy, from the 18th to the 20th century, bore the name HMS \"Hercules\".\nIn the French Navy, there were no less than nineteen ships called \"Hercule\", plus three more named \"Alcide\" which is another name of the same hero.\nHercules's name was also used for five ships of the US Navy, four ships of the Spanish Navy, four of the Argentine Navy and two of the Swedish Navy, as well as for numerous civilian sailing and steam ships.\nIn modern aviation a military transport aircraft produced by Lockheed Martin carries the title Lockheed C-130 Hercules.\nOperation Herkules was the German code-name given to an abortive plan for the invasion of Malta during the Second World War.\nIn films.\nA series of nineteen Italian Hercules movies were made in the late 1950s and early 1960s. The actors who played Hercules in these films were Steve Reeves, Gordon Scott, Kirk Morris, Mickey Hargitay, Mark Forest, Alan Steel, Dan Vadis, Brad Harris, Reg Park, Peter Lupus (billed as Rock Stevens) and Michael Lane. A number of English-dubbed Italian films that featured the name of Hercules in their title were not intended to be movies about Hercules.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

However, it was the West Slavic Lechites, the closest ancestors of ethnic Poles, who established permanent settlements during the Early Middle Ages. The Lechitic Western Polans, a tribe whose name denotes \"people living in open fields\", dominated the region and gave Poland - which lies in the North-Central European Plain - its name. The first ruling dynasty, the Piasts, emerged in the 10th century AD. Duke Mieszko I, regarded as the creator of Polish statehood, adopted Western Christianity in 966 CE. Mieszko's dominion was formally reconstituted as a medieval kingdom in 1025 by his son Boles\u0142aw I the Brave, known for his military expansions. The most successful and the last Piast monarch, Casimir III the Great, presided over a period of economic prosperity and territorial aggrandizement before his death in 1370 without male heirs.\nThe period of the Jagiellonian dynasty in the 14th\u201316th centuries brought close ties with the Lithuania, a cultural Renaissance in Poland and continued territorial expansion as well as Polonization that culminated in the establishment of the Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth in 1569, one of Europe's great powers. The Commonwealth was able to sustain centuries-long prosperity, while its political system matured as a unique noble democracy with an elective monarchy. From the mid-17th century, however, the huge state entered a period of decline caused by devastating wars and the deterioration of its political system. Significant internal reforms were introduced in the late 18th century, such as Europe's first Constitution of 3 May 1791. The existence of the Commonwealth ended in 1795 after a series of invasions and partitions carried out by the Russian Empire, the Kingdom of Prussia and the Habsburg monarchy. From 1795 until 1918, no truly independent Polish state existed, although strong resistance movements operated. The opportunity to regain sovereignty only materialized after World War I, when the three partitioning powers were fatally weakened in the wake of war and revolution.\nThe Second Polish Republic was established in 1918 and existed as an independent state until 1939, when Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union invaded Poland, marking the beginning of World War II. Millions of Polish citizens of different faiths or identities perished under Nazi occupation between 1939 and 1945 through planned genocide and extermination. A Polish government-in-exile functioned throughout the war, and the Poles contributed to the Allied victory through participation in military campaigns on both the eastern and western fronts. The westward advances of the Soviet Red Army in 1944 and 1945 compelled Nazi Germany's forces to retreat from Poland, which led to the establishment of a satellite communist country, known from 1952 as the Polish People's Republic. The territorial adjustments mandated by the Allies at the end of World War II in 1945 shifted Poland's geographic centre of gravity towards the west, and the re-defined Polish lands largely lost their historic multi-ethnic character. By the late 1980s, the Polish reform movement Solidarity contributed to a peaceful transition from a planned communist economy to capitalism and a liberal parliamentary democracy. This process resulted in the creation of the modern Polish state, the Third Polish Republic, founded in 1989.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:TOC limit/styles.css\" /&gt;\nPrehistory and protohistory.\nIn prehistoric and protohistoric times, over a period of approximately 500,000 years, the area of present-day Poland was intermittently inhabited by members of the genus \"Homo\". The earliest evidence of \"Homo erectus\" activity in the form of microlith artifacts was discovered at Trzebnica, in Lower Silesia. It remains the oldest archeological site in the country, dating back to the Lower Paleolithic period of the Stone Age. The southern regions of Poland were subsequently penetrated by sporadic groups of Neanderthals. Their presence was confirmed by the stone tools unearthed in caves of the Krak\u00f3w-Cz\u0119stochowa Upland, a limestone formation with hills, cliffs and valleys that came to be known as the Polish Jura.\nThe arrival of \"Homo sapiens\" and anatomically modern humans coincided with the climatic discontinuity at the end of the Last Glacial Period (Weichselian glaciation) around 10,000 BC, when Poland became warmer and habitable. It allowed various groups of early humans to pass the Sudeten Mountains through the Moravian Gate and the K\u0142odzko Valley into Lower Silesia. The Neolithic period ushered in the Linear Pottery culture, whose founders belonged to the Danubian culture and migrated from the Danube River area beginning about 5500 BC. This culture was distinguished by the establishment of the first settled agricultural communities in modern Polish territory. Later, between about 4400 and 2000 BC, the native post-Mesolithic populations would also adopt and further develop the agricultural way of life.\nExcavations indicated broad-ranging development in the New Stone Age. Most notably, the oldest samples of European cheese (5500 BC) were found in the region of Kuyavia, and a pot from Bronocice is incised with what is now believed to be the earliest-known portrayal of a wheeled vehicle (3400 BC). Toolmaking became more advanced and material was primarily sourced from quarries and mines in the \u015awi\u0119tokrzyskie (Holy Cross) Mountains. Artifacts that originated in this mountain region were excavated as far as Moravia and near the Baltic Sea. It is estimated that the UNESCO-protected neolithic flint mines at Krzemionki, one of Europe's largest, were utilised by the Funnelbeaker and Globular Amphora cultures from 3900 BC to 1600 BC. The only surviving example of ancient parietal art in Poland is at a flint shaft in Krzemionki and features a linear charcoal pictogram of a female figure or deity that has been since associated with fertility. \nPoland's Early Bronze Age began around 2400\u20132300 BC, whereas its Iron Age commenced c. 750\u2013700 BC. One of the many cultures that have been uncovered, the Lusatian culture, spanned the Bronze and Iron Ages and left notable settlement sites. Around 400 BC, Poland was settled by Celts of the La T\u00e8ne culture. They were soon followed by emerging cultures with a strong Germanic component, influenced first by the Celts and then by the Roman Empire. The Germanic peoples migrated out of the area by about 500 AD during the great Migration Period of the European Dark Ages. Wooded regions to the north and east were settled by Balts.\nAccording to some archaeological research, Slavs have resided in modern Polish territories for only 1,500 years. However, recent genetic studies determined that the inhabitants of Poland are also the descendants of people from before the Migration Period. According to other archaeological and linguistic research, early Slavic peoples were likely present in parts of Poland much earlier, and may have been associated with the ancient Przeworsk culture of the 3rd century BC, though some Slavic groups may have arrived from the east in later periods. The West Slavic and Lechitic peoples as well as any remaining minority clans were organized into tribal units (Polish tribes), as outlined by the anonymous Bavarian Geographer in the 9th century. Largely divided, it was the Western Polans in the Greater Poland region who began a process of unification and created a lasting political structure in the 10th century that subsequently became the state of Poland.&lt;templatestyles src=\"Citation/styles.css\"/&gt;[x]\nPiast period (10th century\u20131385).\nMieszko I.\nPoland was established as a state under the Piast dynasty, which ruled the country between the 10th and 14th centuries. Historical records referring to the Polish state begin with the rule of Duke Mieszko I, whose reign commenced sometime before 963 and continued until his death in 992. Mieszko converted to Christianity in 966, following his marriage to Princess Doubravka of Bohemia, a fervent Christian. The event is known as the \"baptism of Poland\", and its date is often used to mark a symbolic beginning of Polish statehood. Mieszko completed a unification of the Lechitic tribal lands that was fundamental to the new country's existence. Following its emergence, Poland was led by a series of rulers who converted the population to Christianity, created a strong kingdom and fostered a distinctive Polish culture that was integrated into the broader European culture.\nBoles\u0142aw I the Brave.\nMieszko's son, Duke Boles\u0142aw I the Brave (r. 992\u20131025), established a Polish Church structure, pursued territorial conquests and was officially crowned the first king of Poland in 1025, near the end of his life. Boles\u0142aw also sought to spread Christianity to parts of eastern Europe that remained pagan, but suffered a setback when his greatest missionary, Adalbert of Prague, was killed in Prussia in 997. During the Congress of Gniezno in the year 1000, Holy Roman Emperor Otto III recognized the Archbishopric of Gniezno, an institution crucial for the continuing existence of the sovereign Polish state. During the reign of Otto's successor, Holy Roman Emperor Henry II, Boles\u0142aw fought prolonged wars with the Kingdom of Germany between 1002 and 1018.\nPiast monarchy under Casimir I, Boles\u0142aw II and Boles\u0142aw III.\nBoles\u0142aw I's expansive rule overstretched the resources of the early Polish state, and it was followed by a collapse of the monarchy. Recovery took place under Casimir I the Restorer (r. 1039\u20131058). Casimir's son Boles\u0142aw II the Generous (r. 1058\u20131079) became involved in a conflict with Bishop Stanislaus of Szczepan\u00f3w that ultimately caused his downfall. Boles\u0142aw had the bishop murdered in 1079 after being excommunicated by the Polish church on charges of adultery. This act sparked a revolt of Polish nobles that led to Boles\u0142aw's deposition and expulsion from the country. Around 1116, Gallus Anonymus wrote a seminal chronicle, the \"Gesta principum Polonorum\", intended as a glorification of his patron Boles\u0142aw III Wrymouth (r. 1107\u20131138), a ruler who revived the tradition of military prowess of Boles\u0142aw I's time. Gallus' work remains a paramount written source for the early history of Poland.\nFragmentation.\nAfter Boles\u0142aw III divided Poland among his sons in his Testament of 1138, internal fragmentation eroded the Piast monarchical structures in the 12th and 13th centuries. In 1180, Casimir II the Just, who sought papal confirmation of his status as a senior duke, granted immunities and additional privileges to the Polish Church at the Congress of \u0141\u0119czyca. Around 1220, Wincenty Kad\u0142ubek wrote his \"Chronica seu originale regum et principum Poloniae\", another major source for early Polish history. In 1226, one of the regional Piast dukes, Konrad I of Masovia, invited the Teutonic Knights to help him fight the Baltic Prussian pagans. The Teutonic Order destroyed the Prussians but kept their lands, which resulted in centuries of warfare between Poland and the Teutonic Knights, and later between Poland and the German Prussian state. The first Mongol invasion of Poland began in 1240; it culminated in the defeat of Polish and allied Christian forces and the death of the Silesian Piast Duke Henry II the Pious at the Battle of Legnica in 1241. In 1242, Wroc\u0142aw became the first Polish municipality to be incorporated, as the period of fragmentation brought economic development and growth of towns. New cities were founded and existing settlements were granted town status per Magdeburg Law. In 1264, Boles\u0142aw the Pious granted Jewish liberties in the Statute of Kalisz.\nLate Piast monarchy under W\u0142adys\u0142aw I and Casimir III.\nAttempts to reunite the Polish lands gained momentum in the 13th century, and in 1295, Duke Przemys\u0142 II of Greater Poland managed to become the first ruler since Boles\u0142aw II to be crowned king of Poland. He ruled over a limited territory and was soon killed. In 1300\u20131305 King Wenceslaus II of Bohemia also reigned as king of Poland. The Piast Kingdom was effectively restored under W\u0142adys\u0142aw I the Elbow-high (r. 1306\u20131333), who became king in 1320. In 1308, the Teutonic Knights seized Gda\u0144sk and the surrounding region of Pomerelia.\nKing Casimir III the Great (r. 1333\u20131370), W\u0142adys\u0142aw's son and the last of the Piast rulers, strengthened and expanded the restored Kingdom of Poland, but the western provinces of Silesia (formally ceded by Casimir in 1339) and most of Polish Pomerania were lost to the Polish state for centuries to come. Progress was made in the recovery of the separately governed central province of Mazovia, however, and in 1340, the conquest of Red Ruthenia began, marking Poland's expansion to the east. The Congress of Krak\u00f3w, a vast convocation of central, eastern, and northern European rulers probably assembled to plan an anti-Turkish crusade, took place in 1364, the same year that the future Jagiellonian University, one of the oldest European universities, was founded. On 9 October 1334, Casimir III confirmed the privileges granted to Jews in 1264 by Boles\u0142aw the Pious and allowed them to settle in Poland in great numbers.\nAngevin transition.\nAfter the Polish royal line and Piast junior branch died out in 1370, Poland came under the rule of Louis I of Hungary of the Capetian House of Anjou, who presided over a union of Hungary and Poland that lasted until 1382. In 1374, Louis granted the Polish nobility the Privilege of Koszyce to assure the succession of one of his daughters in Poland. His youngest daughter Jadwiga (d. 1399) assumed the Polish throne in 1384.\nJagiellonian dynasty (1385\u20131572).\nDynastic union with Lithuania, W\u0142adys\u0142aw II Jagie\u0142\u0142o.\nIn 1386, Grand Duke Jogaila of Lithuania converted to Catholicism and married Queen Jadwiga of Poland. This act enabled him to become a king of Poland himself, and he ruled as W\u0142adys\u0142aw II Jagie\u0142\u0142o until his death in 1434. The marriage established a personal Polish\u2013Lithuanian union ruled by the Jagiellonian dynasty. The first in a series of formal \"unions\" was the Union of Krewo of 1385, whereby arrangements were made for the marriage of Jogaila and Jadwiga. The Polish\u2013Lithuanian partnership brought vast areas of Ruthenia controlled by the Grand Duchy of Lithuania into Poland's sphere of influence and proved beneficial for the nationals of both countries, who coexisted and cooperated in one of the largest political entities in Europe for the next four centuries. When Queen Jadwiga died in 1399, the Kingdom of Poland fell to her husband's sole possession.\nIn the Baltic Sea region, Poland's struggle with the Teutonic Knights continued and culminated in the Battle of Grunwald (1410), a great victory that the Poles and Lithuanians were unable to follow up with a decisive strike against the main seat of the Teutonic Order at Malbork Castle. The Union of Horod\u0142o of 1413 further defined the evolving relationship between the Kingdom of Poland and the Grand Duchy of Lithuania.\nThe privileges of the \"szlachta\" (nobility) kept expanding and in 1425 the rule of \"Neminem captivabimus\", which protected the noblemen from arbitrary royal arrests, was formulated.\nW\u0142adys\u0142aw III and Casimir IV Jagiellon.\nThe reign of the young W\u0142adys\u0142aw III (1434\u201344), who succeeded his father W\u0142adys\u0142aw II Jagie\u0142\u0142o and ruled as king of Poland and Hungary, was cut short by his death at the Battle of Varna, during a crusade against the Ottoman Empire. This disaster led to an interregnum of three years that ended with the accession of W\u0142adys\u0142aw's brother Casimir IV Jagiellon in 1447.\nCritical developments of the Jagiellonian period were concentrated during Casimir IV's long reign, which lasted until 1492. In 1454, Royal Prussia was incorporated by Poland and the Thirteen Years' War of 1454\u201366 with the Teutonic state ensued. In 1466, the milestone Peace of Thorn was concluded. This treaty divided Prussia to create East Prussia, the future Duchy of Prussia, a separate entity that functioned as a fief of Poland under the administration of the Teutonic Knights. Poland also confronted the Ottoman Empire and the Crimean Tatars in the south, and in the east helped Lithuania fight the Grand Duchy of Moscow. The country was developing as a feudal state, with a predominantly agricultural economy and an increasingly dominant landed nobility. Krak\u00f3w, the royal capital, was turning into a major academic and cultural center, and in 1473 the first printing press began operating there. With the growing importance of \"szlachta\" (middle and lower nobility), the king's council evolved to become by 1493 a bicameral General Sejm (parliament) that no longer represented exclusively top dignitaries of the realm.\nThe \"Nihil novi\" act, adopted in 1505 by the Sejm, transferred most of the legislative power from the monarch to the Sejm. This event marked the beginning of the period known as \"Golden Liberty\", when the state was ruled in principle by the \"free and equal\" Polish nobility. In the 16th century, the massive development of folwark agribusinesses operated by the nobility led to increasingly abusive conditions for the peasant serfs who worked them. The political monopoly of the nobles also stifled the development of cities, some of which were thriving during the late Jagiellonian era, and limited the rights of townspeople, effectively holding back the emergence of the middle class.\nEarly modern Poland under Sigismund I and Sigismund II.\nIn the 16th century, Protestant Reformation movements made deep inroads into Polish Christianity and the resulting Reformation in Poland involved a number of different denominations. The policies of religious tolerance that developed in Poland were nearly unique in Europe at that time and many who fled regions torn by religious strife found refuge in Poland. The reigns of King Sigismund I the Old (1506\u20131548) and King Sigismund II Augustus (1548\u20131572) witnessed an intense cultivation of culture and science (a Golden Age of the Renaissance in Poland), of which the astronomer Nicolaus Copernicus (1473\u20131543) is the best known representative. Jan Kochanowski (1530\u20131584) was a poet and the premier artistic personality of the period. In 1525, during the reign of Sigismund I, the Teutonic Order was secularized and Duke Albert performed an act of homage before the Polish king (the Prussian Homage) for his fief, the Duchy of Prussia. Mazovia was finally fully incorporated into the Polish Crown in 1529.\nThe reign of Sigismund II ended the Jagiellonian period, but gave rise to the Union of Lublin (1569), an ultimate fulfillment of the union with Lithuania. This agreement transferred Ukraine from the Grand Duchy of Lithuania to Poland and transformed the Polish\u2013Lithuanian polity into a real union, preserving it beyond the death of the childless Sigismund II, whose active involvement made the completion of this process possible.\nLivonia in the far northeast was incorporated by Poland in 1561 and Poland entered the Livonian War against Russia. The executionist movement, which attempted to check the progressing domination of the state by the magnate families of Poland and Lithuania, peaked at the Sejm in Piotrk\u00f3w in 1562\u201363. On the religious front, the Polish Brethren split from the Calvinists, and the Protestant Brest Bible was published in 1563. The Jesuits, who arrived in 1564, were destined to make a major impact on Poland's history.\nPolish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth.\nEstablishment (1569\u20131648).\nUnion of Lublin.\nThe Union of Lublin of 1569 established the Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth, a federal state more closely unified than the earlier political arrangement between Poland and Lithuania. The union was run largely by the nobility through the system of central parliament and local assemblies, but was headed by elected kings. The formal rule of the nobility, who were proportionally more numerous than in other European countries, constituted an early democratic system (\"a sophisticated noble democracy\"), in contrast to the absolute monarchies prevalent at that time in the rest of Europe.\nThe beginning of the Commonwealth coincided with a period in Polish history when great political power was attained and advancements in civilization and prosperity took place. The Polish\u2013Lithuanian Union became an influential participant in European affairs and a vital cultural entity that spread Western culture (with Polish characteristics) eastward. In the second half of the 16th century and the first half of the 17th century, the Commonwealth was one of the largest and most populous states in contemporary Europe, with an area approaching and a population of about ten million. Its economy was dominated by export-focused agriculture. Nationwide religious toleration was guaranteed at the Warsaw Confederation in 1573.\nFirst elective kings.\nAfter the rule of the Jagiellonian dynasty ended in 1572, Henry of Valois (later King Henry III of France) was the winner of the first \"free election\" by the Polish nobility, held in 1573. He had to agree to the restrictive \"pacta conventa\" obligations and fled Poland in 1574 when news arrived of the vacancy of the French throne, to which he was the heir presumptive. From the start, the royal elections increased foreign influence in the Commonwealth as foreign powers sought to manipulate the Polish nobility to place candidates amicable to their interests. The reign of Stephen B\u00e1thory of Hungary followed (r. 1576\u20131586). He was militarily and domestically assertive and is revered in Polish historical tradition as a rare case of a successful elective king. The establishment of the legal Crown Tribunal in 1578 meant a transfer of many appellate cases from the royal to noble jurisdiction.\nFirst kings of the Vasa dynasty.\nA period of rule under the Swedish House of Vasa began in the Commonwealth in the year 1587. The first two kings from this dynasty, Sigismund III (r. 1587\u20131632) and W\u0142adys\u0142aw IV (r. 1632\u20131648), repeatedly attempted to intrigue for accession to the throne of Sweden, which was a constant source of distraction for the affairs of the Commonwealth. At that time, the Catholic Church embarked on an ideological counter-offensive and the Counter-Reformation claimed many converts from Polish and Lithuanian Protestant circles. In 1596, the Union of Brest split the Eastern Christians of the Commonwealth to create the Uniate Church of the Eastern Rite, but subject to the authority of the pope. The Zebrzydowski rebellion against Sigismund III unfolded in 1606\u20131608.\nSeeking supremacy in Eastern Europe, the Commonwealth fought wars with Russia between 1605 and 1618 in the wake of Russia's Time of Troubles; the series of conflicts is referred to as the Polish\u2013Russian War or the \"Dymitriads\". The efforts resulted in expansion of the eastern territories of the Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth, but the goal of taking over the Russian throne for the Polish ruling dynasty was not achieved. Sweden sought supremacy in the Baltic during the Polish\u2013Swedish wars of 1617\u20131629, and the Ottoman Empire pressed from the south in the Battles at Cecora in 1620 and Khotyn in 1621. The agricultural expansion and serfdom policies in Polish Ukraine resulted in a series of Cossack uprisings. Allied with the Habsburg monarchy, the Commonwealth did not directly participate in the Thirty Years' War.&lt;templatestyles src=\"Citation/styles.css\"/&gt;[s] W\u0142adys\u0142aw's IV reign was mostly peaceful, with a Russian invasion in the form of the Smolensk War of 1632\u20131634 successfully repelled. The Orthodox Church hierarchy, banned in Poland after the Union of Brest, was re-established in 1635.\nDecline (1648\u20131764).\nDeluge of wars.\nDuring the reign of John II Casimir Vasa (r. 1648\u20131668), the third and last king of his dynasty, the nobles' democracy fell into decline as a result of foreign invasions and domestic disorder. These calamities multiplied rather suddenly and marked the end of the Polish Golden Age. Their effect was to render the once powerful Commonwealth increasingly vulnerable to foreign intervention.\nThe Cossack Khmelnytsky Uprising of 1648\u20131657 engulfed the south-eastern regions of the Polish crown; its long-term effects were disastrous for the Commonwealth. The first \"liberum veto\" (a parliamentary device that allowed any member of the Sejm to dissolve a current session immediately) was exercised by a deputy in 1652. This practice would eventually weaken Poland's central government critically. In the Treaty of Pereyaslav (1654), the Ukrainian rebels declared themselves subjects of the Tsar of Russia. The Second Northern War raged through the core Polish lands in 1655\u20131660; it included a brutal and devastating invasion of Poland referred to as the Swedish Deluge. The war ended in 1660 with the Treaty of Oliva, which resulted in the loss of some of Poland's northern possessions. In 1657 the Treaty of Bromberg established the independence of the Duchy of Prussia. The Commonwealth forces did well in the Russo-Polish War (1654\u20131667), but the result was the permanent division of Ukraine between Poland and Russia, as agreed to in the Truce of Andrusovo (1667). Towards the end of the war, the Lubomirski's rebellion, a major magnate revolt against the king, destabilized and weakened the country. The large-scale slave raids of the Crimean Tatars also had highly deleterious effects on the Polish economy. \"Merkuriusz Polski\", the first Polish newspaper, was published in 1661.\nIn 1668, grief-stricken at the recent death of his wife and frustrated by the disastrous political setbacks of his reign, John II Casimir abdicated the throne and fled to France.&lt;templatestyles src=\"Citation/styles.css\"/&gt;[z]\nJohn III Sobieski and last military victories.\nKing Micha\u0142 Korybut Wi\u015bniowiecki, a native Pole, was elected to replace John II Casimir in 1669. The Polish\u2013Ottoman War (1672\u20131676) broke out during his reign, which lasted until 1673, and continued under his successor, John III Sobieski (r. 1674\u20131696). Sobieski intended to pursue Baltic area expansion (and to this end he signed the secret Treaty of Jawor\u00f3w with France in 1675), but was forced instead to fight protracted wars with the Ottoman Empire. By doing so, Sobieski briefly revived the Commonwealth's military might. He defeated the expanding Muslims at the Battle of Khotyn in 1673 and decisively helped deliver Vienna from a Turkish onslaught at the Battle of Vienna in 1683. Sobieski's reign marked the last high point in the history of the Commonwealth: in the first half of the 18th century, Poland ceased to be an active player in international politics. The Treaty of Perpetual Peace (1686) with Russia was the final border settlement between the two countries before the First Partition of Poland in 1772.\nThe Commonwealth, subjected to almost constant warfare until 1720, suffered enormous population losses and massive damage to its economy and social structure. The government became ineffective in the wake of large-scale internal conflicts, corrupted legislative processes and manipulation by foreign interests. The nobility fell under the control of a handful of feuding magnate families with established territorial domains. The urban population and infrastructure fell into ruin, together with most peasant farms, whose inhabitants were subjected to increasingly extreme forms of serfdom. The development of science, culture and education came to a halt or regressed.\nSaxon kings.\nThe royal election of 1697 brought a ruler of the Saxon House of Wettin to the Polish throne: Augustus II the Strong (r. 1697\u20131733), who was able to assume the throne only by agreeing to convert to Roman Catholicism. He was succeeded by his son Augustus III (r. 1734\u20131763). The reigns of the Saxon kings (who were both simultaneously prince-electors of Saxony) were disrupted by competing candidates for the throne and witnessed further disintegration of the Commonwealth.\nThe Great Northern War of 1700\u20131721, a period seen by the contemporaries as a temporary eclipse, may have been the fatal blow that brought down the Polish political system. Stanis\u0142aw Leszczy\u0144ski was installed as king in 1704 under Swedish protection, but lasted only a few years. The Silent Sejm of 1717 marked the beginning of the Commonwealth's existence as a Russian protectorate: the Tsardom would guarantee the reform-impeding Golden Liberty of the nobility from that time on in order to cement the Commonwealth's weak central authority and a state of perpetual political impotence. In a resounding break with traditions of religious tolerance, Protestants were executed during the Tumult of Thorn in 1724. In 1732, Russia, Austria and Prussia, Poland's three increasingly powerful and scheming neighbors, entered into the secret Treaty of the Three Black Eagles with the intention of controlling the future royal succession in the Commonwealth. The War of the Polish Succession was fought in 1733\u20131735 to assist Leszczy\u0144ski in assuming the throne of Poland for a second time. Amidst considerable foreign involvement, his efforts were unsuccessful. The Kingdom of Prussia became a strong regional power and succeeded in wresting the historically Polish province of Silesia from the Habsburg monarchy in the Silesian Wars; .\nThe personal union between the Commonwealth and the Electorate of Saxony did give rise to the emergence of a reform movement in the Commonwealth and the beginnings of the Polish Enlightenment culture, the major positive developments of this era. The first Polish public library was the Za\u0142uski Library in Warsaw, opened to the public in 1747.\nReforms and loss of statehood (1764\u20131795).\nCzartoryski reforms and Stanis\u0142aw August Poniatowski.\nDuring the later part of the 18th century, fundamental internal reforms were attempted in the Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth as it slid into extinction. The reform activity, initially promoted by the magnate Czartoryski family faction known as the \"Familia\", provoked a hostile reaction and military response from neighboring powers, but it did create conditions that fostered economic improvement. The most populous urban center, the capital city of Warsaw, replaced Danzig (Gda\u0144sk) as the leading trade center, and the importance of the more prosperous urban social classes increased. The last decades of the independent Commonwealth's existence were characterized by aggressive reform movements and far-reaching progress in the areas of education, intellectual life, art and the evolution of the social and political system.\nThe royal election of 1764 resulted in the elevation of Stanis\u0142aw August Poniatowski, a refined and worldly aristocrat connected to the Czartoryski family, but hand-picked and imposed by Empress Catherine the Great of Russia, who expected him to be her obedient follower. Stanis\u0142aw August ruled the Polish\u2013Lithuanian state until its dissolution in 1795. The king spent his reign torn between his desire to implement reforms necessary to save the failing state and the perceived necessity of remaining in a subordinate relationship to his Russian sponsors.\nThe Bar Confederation (1768\u20131772) was a rebellion of nobles directed against Russia's influence in general and Stanis\u0142aw August, who was seen as its representative, in particular. It was fought to preserve Poland's independence and the nobility's traditional interests. After several years, it was brought under control by forces loyal to the king and those of the Russian Empire.\nFollowing the suppression of the Bar Confederation, parts of the Commonwealth were divided up among Prussia, Austria and Russia in 1772 at the instigation of Frederick the Great of Prussia, an action that became known as the First Partition of Poland: the outer provinces of the Commonwealth were seized by agreement among the country's three powerful neighbors and only a rump state remained. In 1773, the \"Partition Sejm\" ratified the partition under duress as a \"fait accompli\". However, it also established the Commission of National Education, a pioneering in Europe education authority often called the world's first ministry of education.\nThe Great Sejm of 1788\u20131791 and the Constitution of 3 May 1791.\nThe long-lasting session of parliament convened by King Stanis\u0142aw August is known as the Great Sejm or Four-Year Sejm; it first met in 1788. Its landmark achievement was the passing of the Constitution of 3 May 1791, the first singular pronouncement of a supreme law of the state in modern Europe. A moderately reformist document condemned by detractors as sympathetic to the ideals of the French Revolution, it soon generated strong opposition from the conservative circles of the Commonwealth's upper nobility and from Empress Catherine of Russia, who was determined to prevent the rebirth of a strong Commonwealth. The nobility's Targowica Confederation, formed in Russian imperial capital of Saint Petersburg, appealed to Catherine for help, and in May 1792, the Russian army entered the territory of the Commonwealth. The Polish\u2013Russian War of 1792, a defensive war fought by the forces of the Commonwealth against Russian invaders, ended when the Polish king, convinced of the futility of resistance, capitulated by joining the Targowica Confederation. The Russian-allied confederation took over the government, but Russia and Prussia in 1793 arranged for the Second Partition of Poland anyway. The partition left the country with a critically reduced territory that rendered it essentially incapable of an independent existence. The Commonwealth's Grodno Sejm of 1793, the last Sejm of the state's existence, was compelled to confirm the new partition.\nThe Ko\u015bciuszko Uprising of 1794 and the end of Polish\u2013Lithuanian state.\nRadicalized by recent events, Polish reformers (whether in exile or still resident in the reduced area remaining to the Commonwealth) were soon working on preparations for a national insurrection. Tadeusz Ko\u015bciuszko, a popular general and a veteran of the American Revolution, was chosen as its leader. He returned from abroad and issued Ko\u015bciuszko's proclamation in Krak\u00f3w on March 24, 1794. It called for a national uprising under his supreme command. Ko\u015bciuszko emancipated many peasants in order to enroll them as \"kosynierzy\" in his army, but the hard-fought insurrection, despite widespread national support, proved incapable of generating the foreign assistance necessary for its success. In the end, it was suppressed by the combined forces of Russia and Prussia, with Warsaw captured in November 1794 in the aftermath of the Battle of Praga.\nIn 1795, a Third Partition of Poland was undertaken by Russia, Prussia and Austria as a final division of territory that resulted in the effective dissolution of the Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth. King Stanis\u0142aw August Poniatowski was escorted to Grodno, forced to abdicate, and retired to Saint Petersburg. Tadeusz Ko\u015bciuszko, initially imprisoned, was allowed to emigrate to the United States in 1796.\nThe response of the Polish leadership to the last partition is a matter of historical debate. Literary scholars found that the dominant emotion of the first decade was despair that produced a moral desert ruled by violence and treason. On the other hand, historians have looked for signs of resistance to foreign rule. Apart from those who went into exile, the nobility took oaths of loyalty to their new rulers and served as officers in their armies.\nPartitioned Poland (1795\u20131918).\nArmed resistance (1795\u20131864).\nNapoleonic wars.\nAlthough no sovereign Polish state existed between 1795 and 1918, the idea of Polish independence was kept alive throughout the 19th century. There were a number of uprisings and other armed undertakings waged against the partitioning powers. Military efforts after the partitions were first based on the alliances of Polish \u00e9migr\u00e9s with post-revolutionary France. Jan Henryk D\u0105browski's Polish Legions fought in French campaigns outside of Poland between 1797 and 1802 in hopes that their involvement and contribution would be rewarded with the liberation of their Polish homeland. The Polish national anthem, \"Poland Is Not Yet Lost\", or \"D\u0105browski's Mazurka\", was written in praise of his actions by J\u00f3zef Wybicki in 1797.\nThe Duchy of Warsaw, a small, semi-independent Polish state, was created in 1807 by Napoleon in the wake of his defeat of Prussia and the signing of the Treaties of Tilsit with Emperor Alexander I of Russia. The Army of the Duchy of Warsaw, led by J\u00f3zef Poniatowski, participated in numerous campaigns in alliance with France, including the successful Austro-Polish War of 1809, which, combined with the outcomes of other theaters of the War of the Fifth Coalition, resulted in an enlargement of the duchy's territory. The French invasion of Russia in 1812 and the German Campaign of 1813 saw the duchy's last military engagements. The Constitution of the Duchy of Warsaw abolished serfdom as a reflection of the ideals of the French Revolution, but it did not promote land reform.\nThe Congress of Vienna.\nAfter Napoleon's defeat, a new European order was established at the Congress of Vienna, which met in the years 1814 and 1815. Adam Jerzy Czartoryski, a former close associate of Emperor Alexander I, became the leading advocate for the Polish national cause. The Congress implemented a new partition scheme, which took into account some of the gains realized by the Poles during the Napoleonic period.\nThe Duchy of Warsaw was replaced in 1815 with a new Kingdom of Poland, unofficially known as Congress Poland. The residual Polish kingdom was joined to the Russian Empire in a personal union under the Russian tsar and it was allowed its own constitution and military. East of the kingdom, large areas of the former Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth remained directly incorporated into the Russian Empire as the Western Krai. These territories, along with Congress Poland, are generally considered to form the Russian Partition. The Russian, Prussian, and Austrian \"partitions\" are informal names for the lands of the former Commonwealth, not actual units of administrative division of Polish\u2013Lithuanian territories after partitions. The Prussian Partition included a portion separated as the Grand Duchy of Posen. Peasants under the Prussian administration were gradually enfranchised under the reforms of 1811 and 1823. The limited legal reforms in the Austrian Partition were overshadowed by its rural poverty. The Free City of Cracow was a tiny republic created by the Congress of Vienna under the joint supervision of the three partitioning powers. Despite the bleak political situation (from the standpoint of Polish patriots), economic progress was made in the lands taken over by foreign powers because the period after the Congress of Vienna witnessed a significant development in the building of early industry.\nEconomic historians have made new estimates on GDP per capita, 1790\u20131910. They confirm the hypothesis of semi-peripheral development of Polish territories in the 19th century and the slow process of catching-up with the core economies.\nThe Uprising of November 1830.\nThe increasingly repressive policies of the partitioning powers led to resistance movements in partitioned Poland, and in 1830 Polish patriots staged the November Uprising. This revolt developed into a full-scale war with Russia, but the leadership was taken over by Polish conservatives who were reluctant to challenge the empire and hostile to broadening the independence movement's social base through measures such as land reform. Despite the significant resources mobilized, a series of errors by several successive chief commanders appointed by the insurgent Polish National Government led to the defeat of its forces by the Russian army in 1831. Congress Poland lost its constitution and military, but formally remained a separate administrative unit within the Russian Empire.\nAfter the defeat of the November Uprising, thousands of former Polish combatants and other activists emigrated to Western Europe. This phenomenon, known as the Great Emigration, soon dominated Polish political and intellectual life. Together with the leaders of the independence movement, the Polish community abroad included the greatest Polish literary and artistic minds, including the Romantic poets Adam Mickiewicz, Juliusz S\u0142owacki, Cyprian Norwid, and the composer Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Chopin. In occupied and repressed Poland, some sought progress through nonviolent activism focused on education and economy, known as organic work; others, in cooperation with the emigrant circles, organized conspiracies and prepared for the next armed insurrection.\nRevolts of the era of the Spring of Nations.\nThe planned national uprising failed to materialize because the authorities in the partitions found out about secret preparations. The Greater Poland uprising ended in a fiasco in early 1846. In the Krak\u00f3w uprising of February 1846, patriotic action was combined with revolutionary demands, but the result was the incorporation of the Free City of Cracow into the Austrian Partition. The Austrian officials took advantage of peasant discontent and incited villagers against the noble-dominated insurgent units. This resulted in the Galician slaughter of 1846, a large-scale rebellion of serfs seeking relief from their post-feudal condition of mandatory labor as practiced in \"folwarks\". The uprising freed many from bondage and hastened decisions that led to the abolition of Polish serfdom in the Austrian Empire in 1848. A new wave of Polish involvement in revolutionary movements soon took place in the partitions and in other parts of Europe in the context of the Spring of Nations revolutions of 1848 (e.g. J\u00f3zef Bem's participation in the revolutions in Austria and Hungary). The 1848 German revolutions precipitated the Greater Poland uprising of 1848, in which peasants in the Prussian Partition, who were by then largely enfranchised, played a prominent role.\nThe Uprising of January 1863.\nAs a matter of continuous policy, the Russian autocracy kept assailing Polish national core values of language, religion and culture. In consequence, despite the limited liberalization measures allowed in Congress Poland under the rule of Tsar Alexander II of Russia, a renewal of popular liberation activities took place in 1860\u20131861. During large-scale demonstrations in Warsaw, Russian forces inflicted numerous casualties on the civilian participants. The \"Red\", or left-wing faction of Polish activists, which promoted peasant enfranchisement and cooperated with Russian revolutionaries, became involved in immediate preparations for a national uprising. The \"White\", or right-wing faction, was inclined to cooperate with the Russian authorities and countered with partial reform proposals. In order to cripple the manpower potential of the Reds, Aleksander Wielopolski, the conservative leader of the government of Congress Poland, arranged for a partial selective conscription of young Poles for the Russian army in the years 1862 and 1863. This action hastened the outbreak of hostilities. The January Uprising, joined and led after the initial period by the Whites, was fought by partisan units against an overwhelmingly advantaged enemy. The uprising lasted from January 1863 to the spring of 1864, when Romuald Traugutt, the last supreme commander of the insurgency, was captured by the tsarist police.\nOn 2 March 1864, the Russian authority, compelled by the uprising to compete for the loyalty of Polish peasants, officially published an enfranchisement decree in Congress Poland along the lines of an earlier land reform proclamation of the insurgents. The act created the conditions necessary for the development of the capitalist system on central Polish lands. At the time when most Poles realized the futility of armed resistance without external support, the various sections of Polish society were undergoing deep and far-reaching evolution in the areas of social, economic and cultural development.\nFormation of modern Polish society under foreign rule (1864\u20131914).\nRepression and organic work.\nThe failure of the January Uprising in Poland caused a major psychological trauma and became a historic watershed; indeed, it sparked the development of modern Polish nationalism. The Poles, subjected within the territories under the Russian and Prussian administrations to still stricter controls and increased persecution, sought to preserve their identity in non-violent ways. After the uprising, Congress Poland was downgraded in official usage from the \"Kingdom of Poland\" to the \"Vistula Land\" and was more fully integrated into Russia proper, but not entirely obliterated. The Russian and German languages were imposed in all public communication, and the Catholic Church was not spared from severe repression. Public education was increasingly subjected to Russification and Germanisation measures. Illiteracy was reduced, most effectively in the Prussian partition, but education in the Polish language was preserved mostly through unofficial efforts. The Prussian government pursued German colonization, including the purchase of Polish-owned land. On the other hand, the region of Galicia (western Ukraine and southern Poland) experienced a gradual relaxation of authoritarian policies and even a Polish cultural revival. Economically and socially backward, it was under the milder rule of the Austro-Hungarian Monarchy and from 1867 was increasingly allowed limited autonomy. \"Sta\u0144czycy\", a conservative Polish pro-Austrian faction led by great land owners, dominated the Galician government. The Polish Academy of Learning (an academy of sciences) was founded in Krak\u00f3w in 1872.\nSocial activities termed \"organic work\" consisted of self-help organizations that promoted economic advancement and work on improving the competitiveness of Polish-owned businesses, industrial, agricultural or other. New commercial methods of generating higher productivity were discussed and implemented through trade associations and special interest groups, while Polish banking and cooperative financial institutions made the necessary business loans available. The other major area of effort in organic work was educational and intellectual development of the common people. Many libraries and reading rooms were established in small towns and villages, and numerous printed periodicals manifested the growing interest in popular education. Scientific and educational societies were active in a number of cities. Such activities were most pronounced in the Prussian Partition.\nPositivism in Poland replaced Romanticism as the leading intellectual, social and literary trend. It reflected the ideals and values of the emerging urban bourgeoisie. Around 1890, the urban classes gradually abandoned the positivist ideas and came under the influence of modern pan-European nationalism.\nEconomic development and social change.\nUnder the partitioning powers, economic diversification and progress, including large-scale industrialisation, were introduced in the traditionally agrarian Polish lands, but this development turned out to be very uneven. Advanced agriculture was practiced in the Prussian Partition, except for Upper Silesia, where the coal-mining industry created a large labor force. The densest network of railroads was built in German-ruled western Poland. In Russian Congress Poland, a striking growth of industry, railways and towns took place, all against the background of an extensive, but less productive agriculture. The industrial initiative, capital and know-how were provided largely by entrepreneurs who were not ethnic Poles. Warsaw (a metallurgical center) and \u0141\u00f3d\u017a (a textiles center) grew rapidly, as did the total proportion of urban population, making the region the most economically advanced in the Russian Empire (industrial production exceeded agricultural production there by 1909). The coming of the railways spurred some industrial growth even in the vast Russian Partition territories outside of Congress Poland. The Austrian Partition was rural and poor, except for the industrialized Cieszyn Silesia area. Galician economic expansion after 1890 included oil extraction and resulted in the growth of Lemberg (Lw\u00f3w, Lviv) and Krak\u00f3w.\nEconomic and social changes involving land reform and industrialization, combined with the effects of foreign domination, altered the centuries-old social structure of Polish society. Among the newly emergent strata were wealthy industrialists and financiers, distinct from the traditional, but still critically important landed aristocracy. The intelligentsia, an educated, professional or business middle class, often originated from lower gentry, landless or alienated from their rural possessions, and from urban people. Many smaller agricultural enterprises based on serfdom did not survive the land reforms. The industrial proletariat, a new underprivileged class, was composed mainly of poor peasants or townspeople forced by deteriorating conditions to migrate and search for work in urban centers in their countries of origin or abroad. Millions of residents of the former Commonwealth of various ethnic groups worked or settled in Europe and in North and South America.\nSocial and economic changes were partial and gradual. The degree of industrialisation, relatively fast-paced in some areas, lagged behind the advanced regions of Western Europe. The three partitions developed different economies and were more economically integrated with their mother states than with each other. In the Prussian Partition, for example, agricultural production depended heavily on the German market, whereas the industrial sector of Congress Poland relied more on the Russian market.\nNationalism, socialism and other movements.\nIn the 1870s\u20131890s, large-scale socialist, nationalist, agrarian and other political movements of great ideological fervor became established in partitioned Poland and Lithuania, along with corresponding political parties to promote them. Of the major parties, the socialist First Proletariat was founded in 1882, the Polish League (precursor of National Democracy) in 1887, the Polish Social Democratic Party of Galicia and Silesia in 1890, the Polish Socialist Party in 1892, the Marxist Social Democracy of the Kingdom of Poland and Lithuania in 1893, the agrarian People's Party of Galicia in 1895 and the Jewish socialist Bund in 1897. Christian democracy regional associations allied with the Catholic Church were also active; they united into the Polish Christian Democratic Party in 1919.\nThe main minority ethnic groups of the former Commonwealth, including Ukrainians, Lithuanians, Belarusians and Jews, were getting involved in their own national movements and plans, which met with disapproval on the part of those Polish independence activists who counted on an eventual rebirth of the Commonwealth or the rise of a Commonwealth-inspired federal structure (a political movement referred to as Prometheism).\nAround the start of the 20th century, the Young Poland cultural movement, centered in Austrian Galicia, took advantage of a milieu conducive to liberal expression in that region and was the source of Poland's finest artistic and literary productions. In this same era, Marie Sk\u0142odowska Curie, a pioneer radiation scientist, performed her groundbreaking research in Paris.\nThe Revolution of 1905.\nThe Revolution of 1905\u20131907 in Russian Poland, the result of many years of pent-up political frustrations and stifled national ambitions, was marked by political maneuvering, strikes and rebellion. The revolt was part of much broader disturbances throughout the Russian Empire associated with the general Revolution of 1905. In Poland, the principal revolutionary figures were Roman Dmowski and J\u00f3zef Pi\u0142sudski. Dmowski was associated with the right-wing nationalist movement National Democracy, whereas Pi\u0142sudski was associated with the Polish Socialist Party. As the authorities re-established control within the Russian Empire, the revolt in Congress Poland, placed under martial law, withered as well, partially as a result of tsarist concessions in the areas of national and workers' rights, including Polish representation in the newly created Russian Duma. The collapse of the revolt in the Russian Partition, coupled with intensified Germanization in the Prussian Partition, left Austrian Galicia as the territory where Polish patriotic action was most likely to flourish.\nIn the Austrian Partition, Polish culture was openly cultivated, and in the Prussian Partition, there were high levels of education and living standards, but the Russian Partition remained of primary importance for the Polish nation and its aspirations. About 15.5 million Polish-speakers lived in the territories most densely populated by Poles: the western part of the Russian Partition, the Prussian Partition and the western Austrian Partition. Ethnically Polish settlement spread over a large area further to the east, including its greatest concentration in the Vilnius Region, amounted to only over 20% of that number.\nPolish paramilitary organizations oriented toward independence, such as the Union of Active Struggle, were formed in 1908\u20131914, mainly in Galicia. The Poles were divided and their political parties fragmented on the eve of World War I, with Dmowski's National Democracy (pro-Entente) and Pi\u0142sudski's faction assuming opposing positions.\nWorld War I and the issue of Poland's independence.\nThe outbreak of World War I in the Polish lands offered Poles unexpected hopes for achieving independence as a result of the turbulence that engulfed the empires of the partitioning powers. All three of the monarchies that had benefited from the partition of Polish territories (Germany, Austria and Russia) were dissolved by the end of the war, and many of their territories were dispersed into new political units. At the start of the war, the Poles found themselves conscripted into the armies of the partitioning powers in a war that was not theirs. Furthermore, they were frequently forced to fight each other, since the armies of Germany and Austria were allied against Russia. Pi\u0142sudski's paramilitary units stationed in Galicia were turned into the Polish Legions in 1914 and as a part of the Austro-Hungarian Army fought on the Russian front until 1917, when the formation was disbanded. Pi\u0142sudski, who refused demands that his men fight under German command, was arrested and imprisoned by the Germans and became a heroic symbol of Polish nationalism.\nDue to a series of German victories on the Eastern Front, the area of Congress Poland became occupied by the Central Powers of Germany and Austria; Warsaw was captured by the Germans on 5 August 1915. In the Act of 5th November 1916, a fresh incarnation of the Kingdom of Poland (\"Kr\u00f3lestwo Regencyjne\") was proclaimed by Germany and Austria on formerly Russian-controlled territories, within the German \"Mitteleuropa\" scheme. The sponsor states were never able to agree on a candidate to assume the throne, however; rather, it was governed in turn by German and Austrian governor-generals, a Provisional Council of State, and a Regency Council. This increasingly autonomous puppet state existed until November 1918, when it was replaced by the newly established Republic of Poland. The existence of this \"kingdom\" and its planned Polish army had a positive effect on the Polish national efforts on the Allied side, but in the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk of March 1918 the victorious in the east Germany imposed harsh conditions on defeated Russia and ignored Polish interests. Toward the end of the war, the German authorities engaged in massive, purposeful devastation of industrial and other economic potential of Polish lands in order to impoverish the country, a likely future competitor of Germany.\nThe independence of Poland had been campaigned for in Russia and in the West by Dmowski and in the West by Ignacy Jan Paderewski. Tsar Nicholas II of Russia, and then the leaders of the February Revolution and the October Revolution of 1917, installed governments who declared in turn their support for Polish independence.&lt;templatestyles src=\"Citation/styles.css\"/&gt;[d1] In 1917, France formed the Blue Army (placed under J\u00f3zef Haller) that comprised about 70,000 Poles by the end of the war, including men captured from German and Austrian units and 20,000 volunteers from the United States. There was also a 30,000-men strong Polish anti-German army in Russia. Dmowski, operating from Paris as head of the Polish National Committee (KNP), became the spokesman for Polish nationalism in the Allied camp. On the initiative of Woodrow Wilson's Fourteen Points, Polish independence was officially endorsed by the Allies in June 1918.&lt;templatestyles src=\"Citation/styles.css\"/&gt;[c1]\nIn all, about two million Poles served in the war, counting both sides, and about 400\u2013450,000 died. Much of the fighting on the Eastern Front took place in Poland, and civilian casualties and devastation were high.\nThe final push for independence of Poland took place on the ground in October\u2013November 1918. Near the end of the war, Austro-Hungarian and German units were being disarmed, and the Austrian army's collapse freed Cieszyn and Krak\u00f3w at the end of October. Lviv was then contested in the Polish\u2013Ukrainian War of 1918\u20131919. Ignacy Daszy\u0144ski headed the first short-lived independent Polish government in Lublin from 7 November, the leftist Provisional People's Government of the Republic of Poland, proclaimed as a democracy. Germany, now defeated, was forced by the Allies to stand down its large military forces in Poland. Overtaken by the German Revolution of 1918\u20131919 at home, the Germans released Pi\u0142sudski from prison. He arrived in Warsaw on 10 November and was granted extensive authority by the Regency Council; Pi\u0142sudski's authority was also recognized by the Lublin government.&lt;templatestyles src=\"Citation/styles.css\"/&gt;[b1] On 22 November, he became the temporary head of state. Pi\u0142sudski was held by many in high regard, but was resented by the right-wing National Democrats. The emerging Polish state was internally divided, heavily war-damaged and economically dysfunctional.\nSecond Polish Republic (1918\u20131939).\nSecuring national borders, war with Soviet Russia.\nAfter more than a century of foreign rule, Poland regained its independence at the end of World War I as one of the outcomes of the negotiations that took place at the Paris Peace Conference of 1919. The Treaty of Versailles that emerged from the conference set up an independent Polish nation with an outlet to the sea, but left some of its boundaries to be decided by plebiscites. The largely German-inhabited Free City of Danzig was granted a separate status that guaranteed its use as a port by Poland. In the end, the settlement of the German-Polish border turned out to be a prolonged and convoluted process. The dispute helped engender the Greater Poland Uprising of 1918\u20131919, the three Silesian uprisings of 1919\u20131921, the East Prussian plebiscite of 1920, the Upper Silesia plebiscite of 1921 and the 1922 Silesian Convention in Geneva.\nOther boundaries were settled by war and subsequent treaties. A total of six border wars were fought in 1918\u20131921, including the Polish\u2013Czechoslovak border conflicts over Cieszyn Silesia in January 1919.\nAs distressing as these border conflicts were, the Polish\u2013Soviet War of 1919\u20131921 was the most important series of military actions of the era. Pi\u0142sudski had entertained far-reaching anti-Russian cooperative designs in Eastern Europe, and in 1919 the Polish forces pushed eastward into Lithuania, Belarus and Ukraine by taking advantage of the Russian preoccupation with a civil war, but they were soon confronted with the Soviet westward offensive of 1918\u20131919. Western Ukraine was already a theater of the Polish\u2013Ukrainian War, which eliminated the proclaimed West Ukrainian People's Republic in July 1919. In the autumn of 1919, Pi\u0142sudski rejected urgent pleas from the former Entente powers to support Anton Denikin's White movement in its advance on Moscow. The Polish\u2013Soviet War proper began with the Polish Kiev offensive in April 1920. Allied with the Directorate of Ukraine of the Ukrainian People's Republic, the Polish armies had advanced past Vilnius, Minsk and Kiev by June. At that time, a massive Soviet counter-offensive pushed the Poles out of most of Ukraine. On the northern front, the Soviet army reached the outskirts of Warsaw in early August. A Soviet triumph and the quick end of Poland seemed inevitable. However, the Poles scored a stunning victory at the Battle of Warsaw (1920). Afterwards, more Polish military successes followed, and the Soviets had to pull back. They left swathes of territory populated largely by Belarusians or Ukrainians to Polish rule. The new eastern boundary was finalized by the Peace of Riga in March 1921.\nThe defeat of the Russian armies forced Vladimir Lenin and the Soviet leadership to postpone their strategic objective of linking up with the German and other European revolutionary leftist collaborators to spread communist revolution. Lenin also hoped for generating support for the Red Army in Poland, which failed to materialize.\nPi\u0142sudski's seizure of Vilnius in October 1920 (known as \u017beligowski's Mutiny) was a nail in the coffin of the already poor Lithuania\u2013Poland relations that had been strained by the Polish\u2013Lithuanian War of 1919\u20131920; both states would remain hostile to one another for the remainder of the interwar period. Pi\u0142sudski's concept of Intermarium (an East European federation of states inspired by the tradition of the multiethnic Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth that would include a hypothetical multinational successor state to the Grand Duchy of Lithuania) had the fatal flaw of being incompatible with his assumption of Polish domination, which would amount to an encroachment on the neighboring peoples' lands and aspirations. At the time of rising national movements, the plan thus ceased being a feature of Poland's politics.&lt;templatestyles src=\"Citation/styles.css\"/&gt;[a] A larger federated structure was also opposed by Dmowski's National Democrats. Their representative at the Peace of Riga talks, Stanis\u0142aw Grabski, opted for leaving Minsk, Berdychiv, Kamianets-Podilskyi and the surrounding areas on the Soviet side of the border. The National Democrats did not want to assume the lands they considered politically undesirable, as such territorial enlargement would result in a reduced proportion of citizens who were ethnically Polish.\nThe Peace of Riga settled the eastern border by preserving for Poland a substantial portion of the old Commonwealth's eastern territories at the cost of partitioning the lands of the former Grand Duchy of Lithuania (Lithuania and Belarus) and Ukraine. The Ukrainians ended up with no state of their own and felt betrayed by the Riga arrangements; their resentment gave rise to extreme nationalism and anti-Polish hostility. The Kresy (or borderland) territories in the east won by 1921 would form the basis for a swap arranged and carried out by the Soviets in 1943\u20131945, who at that time compensated the re-emerging Polish state for the eastern lands lost to the Soviet Union with conquered areas of eastern Germany.\nThe successful outcome of the Polish\u2013Soviet War gave Poland a false sense of its prowess as a self-sufficient military power and encouraged the government to try to resolve international problems through imposed unilateral solutions. The territorial and ethnic policies of the interwar period contributed to bad relations with most of Poland's neighbors and uneasy cooperation with more distant centers of power, especially France and Great Britain.\nDemocratic politics (1918\u20131926).\nAmong the chief difficulties faced by the government of the new Polish republic was the lack of an integrated infrastructure among the formerly separate partitions, a deficiency that disrupted industry, transportation, trade, and other areas.\nThe first Polish legislative election for the re-established Sejm (national parliament) took place in January 1919. A temporary Small Constitution was passed by the body the following month.\nThe rapidly growing population of Poland within its new boundaries was three-fourths agricultural and one-fourth urban; Polish was the primary language of only two thirds of the inhabitants of the new country. The minorities had very little voice in the government. The permanent March Constitution of Poland was adopted in March 1921. At the insistence of the National Democrats, who were concerned about how aggressively J\u00f3zef Pi\u0142sudski might exercise presidential powers if he were elected to office, the constitution mandated limited prerogatives for the presidency.\nThe proclamation of the March Constitution was followed by a short and turbulent period of constitutional order and parliamentary democracy that lasted until 1926. The legislature remained fragmented, without stable majorities, and governments changed frequently. The open-minded Gabriel Narutowicz was elected president according to the Constitution by the National Assembly in 1922, without popular vote. However, members of the nationalist right-wing faction did not regard his elevation as legitimate. They viewed Narutowicz rather as a traitor whose election was pushed through by the votes of alien minorities. Narutowicz and his supporters were subjected to an intense harassment campaign, and the president was assassinated on 16 December 1922, after serving only five days in office.\nLand reform measures were passed in 1919 and 1925 under pressure from an impoverished peasantry. They were partially implemented, but resulted in the parcellation of only 20% of the great agricultural estates. Poland endured numerous economic calamities and disruptions in the early 1920s, including waves of workers' strikes such as the 1923 Krak\u00f3w riot. The German\u2013Polish customs war, initiated by Germany in 1925, was one of the most damaging external factors that put a strain on Poland's economy. On the other hand, there were also signs of progress and stabilization, for example a critical reform of finances carried out by the competent government of W\u0142adys\u0142aw Grabski, which lasted almost two years. Certain other achievements of the democratic period having to do with the management of governmental and civic institutions necessary to the functioning of the reunited state and nation were too easily overlooked. Lurking on the sidelines was a disgusted army officer corps unwilling to subject itself to civilian control, but ready to follow the retired Pi\u0142sudski, who was highly popular with Poles and just as dissatisfied with the Polish system of government as his former colleagues in the military.\nPi\u0142sudski's coup and the Sanation Era (1926\u20131935).\nOn 12 May 1926, Pi\u0142sudski staged the May Coup, a military overthrow of the civilian government mounted against President Stanis\u0142aw Wojciechowski and the troops loyal to the legitimate government. Hundreds died in fratricidal fighting. Pi\u0142sudski was supported by several leftist factions who ensured the success of his coup by blocking the railway transportation of government forces.&lt;templatestyles src=\"Citation/styles.css\"/&gt;[b1] He also had the support of the conservative great landowners, a move that left the right-wing National Democrats as the only major social force opposed to the takeover.&lt;templatestyles src=\"Citation/styles.css\"/&gt;[l]\nFollowing the coup, the new government initially respected many parliamentary formalities, but gradually tightened its control and abandoned pretenses. The Centrolew, a coalition of center-left parties, was formed in 1929, and in 1930 called for the \"abolition of dictatorship\". In 1930, the Sejm was dissolved and a number of opposition deputies were imprisoned at the Brest Fortress. Five thousand political opponents were arrested ahead of the Polish legislative election of 1930, which was rigged to award a majority of seats to the pro-government Nonpartisan Bloc for Cooperation with the Government (BBWR).\nThe authoritarian Sanation government (\"sanation\" meant to denote \"healing\") that Pi\u0142sudski led until his death in 1935 (and would remain in place until 1939) reflected the dictator's evolution from his center-left past to conservative alliances. Political institutions and parties were allowed to function, but the electoral process was manipulated and those not willing to cooperate submissively were subjected to repression. From 1930, persistent opponents of the government, many of the leftist persuasion, were imprisoned and subjected to staged legal processes with harsh sentences, such as the Brest trials, or else detained in the Bereza Kartuska prison and similar camps for political prisoners. About three thousand were detained without trial at different times at the Bereza internment camp between 1934 and 1939. In 1936 for example, 369 activists were taken there, including 342 Polish communists. Rebellious peasants staged riots in 1932, 1933 and the 1937 peasant strike in Poland. Other civil disturbances were caused by striking industrial workers (e.g. events of the \"Bloody Spring\" of 1936), nationalist Ukrainians&lt;templatestyles src=\"Citation/styles.css\"/&gt;[p] and the activists of the incipient Belarusian movement. All became targets of ruthless police-military pacification.&lt;templatestyles src=\"Citation/styles.css\"/&gt;[y] Besides sponsoring political repression, the government fostered J\u00f3zef Pi\u0142sudski's cult of personality that had already existed long before he assumed dictatorial powers.\nPi\u0142sudski signed the Soviet\u2013Polish Non-Aggression Pact in 1932 and the German\u2013Polish declaration of non-aggression in 1934, but in 1933 he insisted that there was no threat from the East or West and said that Poland's politics were focused on becoming fully independent without serving foreign interests. He initiated the policy of maintaining an equal distance and an adjustable middle course regarding the two great neighbors, later continued by J\u00f3zef Beck. Pi\u0142sudski kept personal control of the army, but it was poorly equipped, poorly trained and had poor preparations in place for possible future conflicts. His only war plan was a defensive war against a Soviet invasion.&lt;templatestyles src=\"Citation/styles.css\"/&gt;[r] The slow modernization after Pi\u0142sudski's death fell far behind the progress made by Poland's neighbors and measures to protect the western border, discontinued by Pi\u0142sudski from 1926, were not undertaken until March 1939.\nSanation deputies in the Sejm used a parliamentary maneuver to abolish the democratic March Constitution and push through a more authoritarian April Constitution in 1935; it reduced the powers of the Sejm, which Pi\u0142sudski despised. The process and the resulting document were seen as illegitimate by the anti-Sanation opposition, but during World War II, the Polish government-in-exile recognized the April Constitution in order to uphold the legal continuity of the Polish state. Between 1932 and 1933 Pi\u0142sudski and Beck initiated several incidents along the borders with Germany and Danzig, both to test whether Western powers would protect the Versailles arrangements (on which Polish security depended), and as preparation for a preventative war against Germany. At the same time they sent emissaries to London and Paris, looking for their support in stopping Germany's rearmament effort. An invasion to Danzig by Poland was scheduled for April 21, 1933, but the amassing of troops was discovered and the invasion was postponed. At the time an invasion by Poland would have posed a serious military threat to Germany, but with the British rejecting the idea (in favor of the Four-Power Pact), and with wavering support from the French, the Poles had eventually reneged on the idea of invasion. Between 1933 and 1934 Germany would increase its armament expenditures by 68%, and by January 1934 the two powers would sign a ten-year non-aggression pact. When Marshal Pi\u0142sudski died in 1935, he retained the support of dominant sections of Polish society even though he never risked testing his popularity in an honest election. His government was dictatorial, but at that time only Czechoslovakia remained democratic in all of the regions neighboring Poland. Historians have taken widely divergent views of the meaning and consequences of the coup Pi\u0142sudski perpetrated and his personal rule that followed.\nSocial and economic trends of the interwar period.\nIndependence stimulated the development of Polish culture in the Interbellum and intellectual achievement was high. Warsaw, whose population almost doubled between World War I and World War II, was a restless, burgeoning metropolis. It outpaced Krak\u00f3w, Lw\u00f3w and Wilno, the other major population centers of the country. Mainstream Polish society was not affected by the repressions of the Sanation authorities overall; many Poles enjoyed relative stability, and the economy improved markedly between 1926 and 1929, only to become caught up in the global Great Depression. After 1929, the country's industrial production and gross national income slumped by about 50%.\nThe Great Depression brought low prices for farmers and unemployment for workers. Social tensions increased, including rising antisemitism. A major economic transformation and multi-year state plan to achieve national industrial development, as embodied in the Central Industrial Region initiative launched in 1936, was led by Minister Eugeniusz Kwiatkowski. Motivated primarily by the need for a native arms industry, the initiative was in progress at the time of the outbreak of World War II. Kwiatkowski was also the main architect of the earlier Gdynia seaport project.\nThe prevalent in political circles nationalism was fueled by the large size of Poland's minority populations and their separate agendas. According to the language criterion of the Polish census of 1931, the Poles constituted 69% of the population, Ukrainians 15%, Jews (defined as speakers of the Yiddish language) 8.5%, Belarusians 4.7%, Germans 2.2%, Lithuanians 0.25%, Russians 0.25% and Czechs 0.09%, with some geographical areas dominated by a particular minority. In time, the ethnic conflicts intensified, and the Polish state grew less tolerant of the interests of its national minorities. In interwar Poland, compulsory free general education substantially reduced illiteracy rates, but discrimination was practiced in a way that resulted in a dramatic decrease in the number of Ukrainian language schools and official restrictions on Jewish attendance at selected schools in the late 1930s.\nThe population grew steadily, reaching 35 million in 1939. However, the overall economic situation in the interwar period was one of stagnation. There was little money for investment inside Poland, and few foreigners were interested in investing there. Total industrial production barely increased between 1913 and 1939 (within the area delimited by the 1939 borders), but because of population growth (from 26.3 million in 1919 to 34.8 million in 1939), the \"per capita\" output actually decreased by 18%.\nConditions in the predominant agricultural sector kept deteriorating between 1929 and 1939, which resulted in rural unrest and a progressive radicalization of the Polish peasant movement that became increasingly inclined toward militant anti-state activities. It was firmly repressed by the authorities. According to Norman Davies, the failures of the Sanation government (combined with the objective economic realities) caused a radicalization of the Polish masses by the end of the 1930s, but he warns against drawing parallels with the incomparably more oppressive Nazi Germany or the Stalinist Soviet Union.\nFinal Sanation years (1935\u20131939).\nAfter Pi\u0142sudski's death in 1935, Poland was governed until (and initially during) the German invasion of 1939 by old allies and subordinates known as \"Pi\u0142sudski's colonels\". They had neither the vision nor the resources to cope with the perilous situation facing Poland in the late 1930s. The colonels had gradually assumed greater powers during Pi\u0142sudski's life by manipulating the ailing marshal behind the scenes. Eventually they achieved an overt politicization of the army that did nothing to help prepare the country for war.\nForeign policy was the responsibility of J\u00f3zef Beck, under whom Polish diplomacy attempted balanced approaches toward Germany and the Soviet Union, without success, on the basis of a flawed understanding of the European geopolitics of his day. Beck had numerous foreign policy schemes and harbored illusions of Poland's status as a great power. He alienated most of Poland's neighbors, but is not blamed by historians for the ultimate failure of relations with Germany. The principal events of his tenure were concentrated in its last two years. In the case of the 1938 Polish ultimatum to Lithuania, the Polish action nearly resulted in a German takeover of southwest Lithuania, the Klaip\u0117da Region (Memel Territory), which had a largely German population. Also in 1938, the Polish government opportunistically undertook a hostile action against the Czechoslovak state as weakened by the Munich Agreement and annexed a small piece of territory on its borders. In this case, Beck's understanding of the consequences of the Polish military move turned out to be completely mistaken, because in the end the German occupation of Czechoslovakia markedly weakened Poland's own position. Furthermore, Beck erroneously believed that Nazi-Soviet ideological contradictions would preclude their cooperation.\nAt home, increasingly alienated and suppressed minorities threatened unrest and violence. Extreme nationalist circles such as the National Radical Camp grew more outspoken. One of the groups, the Camp of National Unity, combined many nationalists with Sanation supporters and was connected to the new strongman, Marshal Edward Rydz-\u015amig\u0142y, whose faction of the Sanation ruling movement was increasingly nationalistic.\nIn the late 1930s, the exile bloc Front Morges united several major Polish anti-Sanation figures, including Ignacy Paderewski, W\u0142adys\u0142aw Sikorski, Wincenty Witos, Wojciech Korfanty and J\u00f3zef Haller. It gained little influence inside Poland, but its spirit soon reappeared during World War II, within the Polish government-in-exile.\nIn October 1938, Joachim von Ribbentrop first proposed German-Polish territorial adjustments and Poland's participation in the Anti-Comintern Pact against the Soviet Union. The status of the Free City of Danzig was one of the key bones of contention. Approached by Ribbentrop again in March 1939, the Polish government expressed willingness to address issues causing German concern, but effectively rejected Germany's stated demands and thus refused to allow Poland to be turned by Adolf Hitler into a German puppet state. Hitler, incensed by the British and French declarations of support for Poland, abrogated the German\u2013Polish declaration of non-aggression in late April 1939.\nTo protect itself from an increasingly aggressive Nazi Germany, already responsible for the annexations of Austria (in the Anschluss of 1938), Czechoslovakia (in 1939) and a part of Lithuania after the 1939 German ultimatum to Lithuania, Poland entered into a military alliance with Britain and France (the 1939 Anglo-Polish military alliance and the Franco-Polish alliance (1921), as updated in 1939). However, the two Western powers were defense-oriented and not in a strong position, either geographically or in terms of resources, to assist Poland. Attempts were therefore made by them to induce Soviet-Polish cooperation, which they viewed as the only militarily viable arrangement.\nDiplomatic manoeuvers continued in the spring and summer of 1939, but in their final attempts, the Franco-British talks with the Soviets in Moscow on forming an anti-Nazi defensive military alliance failed. Warsaw's refusal to allow the Red Army to operate on Polish territory doomed the Western efforts. The final contentious Allied-Soviet exchanges took place on 21 and 23 August 1939.&lt;templatestyles src=\"Citation/styles.css\"/&gt;[b] The Stalinist state was the target of an intense German counter-initiative and was concurrently involved in increasingly effective negotiations with Hitler's agents. On 23 August, an outcome contrary to the exertions of the Allies became a reality: in Moscow, Germany and the Soviet Union hurriedly signed the Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop Pact, which secretly provided for the dismemberment of Poland into Nazi- and Soviet-controlled zones.\nWorld War II.\nInvasions and resistance.\nOn 1 September 1939, Hitler ordered an invasion of Poland, the opening event of World War II. Poland had signed an Anglo-Polish military alliance as recently as the 25th of August, and had long been in alliance with France. The two Western powers soon declared war on Germany, but they remained largely inactive (the period early in the conflict became known as the Phoney War) and extended no aid to the attacked country. The technically and numerically superior \"Wehrmacht\" formations rapidly advanced eastwards and engaged massively in the murder of Polish civilians over the entire occupied territory. On 17 September, a Soviet invasion of Poland began. The Soviet Union quickly occupied most of the areas of eastern Poland that were inhabited by a significant Ukrainian and Belarusian minority.&lt;templatestyles src=\"Citation/styles.css\"/&gt;[h] The two invading powers divided up the country as they had agreed in the secret provisions of the Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop Pact. Poland's top government officials and military high command fled the war zone and arrived at the Romanian Bridgehead in mid-September. After the Soviet entry they sought refuge in Romania.\nAmong the military operations in which Poles held out the longest (until late September or early October) were the Siege of Warsaw, the Battle of Hel and the resistance of the Independent Operational Group Polesie. Warsaw fell on 27 September after a heavy German bombardment that killed tens of thousands civilians and soldiers. Poland was ultimately partitioned between Germany and the Soviet Union according to the terms of the German\u2013Soviet Frontier Treaty signed by the two powers in Moscow on 29 September.\nGerhard Weinberg has argued that the most significant Polish contribution to World War II was sharing its code-breaking results. This allowed the British to perform the cryptanalysis of the Enigma and decipher the main German military code, which gave the Allies a major advantage in the conflict. As regards actual military campaigns, some Polish historians have argued that simply resisting the initial invasion of Poland was the country's greatest contribution to the victory over Nazi Germany, despite its defeat. The Polish Army of nearly one million men significantly delayed the start of the Battle of France, planned by the Germans for 1939. When the Nazi offensive in the West did happen, the delay caused it to be less effective, a possibly crucial factor in the victory of the Battle of Britain.\nAfter Germany invaded the Soviet Union as part of its Operation Barbarossa in June 1941, the whole of pre-war Poland was overrun and occupied by German troops.\nGerman-occupied Poland was divided from 1939 into two regions: Polish areas annexed by Nazi Germany directly into the German \"Reich\" and areas ruled under a so-called General Government of occupation. The Poles formed an underground resistance movement and a Polish government-in-exile that operated first in Paris, then, from July 1940, in London. Polish-Soviet diplomatic relations, broken since September 1939, were resumed in July 1941 under the Sikorski\u2013Mayski agreement, which facilitated the formation of a Polish army (the Anders' Army) in the Soviet Union. In November 1941, Prime Minister Sikorski flew to the Soviet Union to negotiate with Stalin on its role on the Soviet-German front, but the British wanted the Polish soldiers in the Middle East. Stalin agreed, and the army was evacuated there.&lt;templatestyles src=\"Citation/styles.css\"/&gt;[w]\nThe organizations forming the Polish Underground State that functioned in Poland throughout the war were loyal to and formally under the Polish government-in-exile, acting through its Government Delegation for Poland. During World War II, hundreds of thousands of Poles joined the underground Polish Home Army (\"Armia Krajowa\"), a part of the Polish Armed Forces of the government-in-exile. About 200,000 Poles fought on the Western Front in the Polish Armed Forces in the West loyal to the government-in-exile, and about 300,000 in the under the Soviet command on the Eastern Front. The pro-Soviet resistance movement in Poland, led by the Polish Workers' Party, was active from 1941. It was opposed by the gradually forming extreme nationalistic National Armed Forces.&lt;templatestyles src=\"Citation/styles.css\"/&gt;[t]\nBeginning in late 1939, hundreds of thousands of Poles from the Soviet-occupied areas were deported and taken east. Of the upper-ranking military personnel and others deemed uncooperative or potentially harmful by the Soviets, about 22,000 were secretly executed by them at the Katyn massacre. In April 1943, the Soviet Union broke off deteriorating relations with the Polish government-in-exile after the German military announced the discovery of mass graves containing murdered Polish army officers. The Soviets claimed that the Poles committed a hostile act by requesting that the Red Cross investigate these reports.\nFrom 1941, the implementation of the Nazi Final Solution began, and the Holocaust in Poland proceeded with force. Warsaw was the scene of the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising in April\u2013May 1943, triggered by the liquidation of the Warsaw Ghetto by German SS units. The elimination of Jewish ghettos in German-occupied Poland took place in many cities. As the Jewish people were being removed to be exterminated, uprisings were waged against impossible odds by the Jewish Combat Organization and other desperate Jewish insurgents.\nSoviet advance 1944\u20131945, Warsaw Uprising.\nAt a time of increasing cooperation between the Western Allies and the Soviet Union in the wake of the Nazi invasion of 1941, the influence of the Polish government-in-exile was seriously diminished by the death of Prime Minister W\u0142adys\u0142aw Sikorski, its most capable leader, in a plane crash on 4 July 1943. Around that time, Polish-communist civilian and military organizations opposed to the government, led by Wanda Wasilewska and supported by Stalin, were formed in the Soviet Union.\nIn July 1944, the Soviet Red Army and Soviet-controlled Polish People's Army entered the territory of future postwar Poland. In protracted fighting in 1944 and 1945, the Soviets and their Polish allies defeated and expelled the German army from Poland at a cost of over 600,000 Soviet soldiers lost.\nThe greatest single undertaking of the Polish resistance movement in World War II and a major political event was the Warsaw Uprising that began on 1 August 1944. The uprising, in which most of the city's population participated, was instigated by the underground Home Army and approved by the Polish government-in-exile in an attempt to establish a non-communist Polish administration ahead of the arrival of the Red Army. The uprising was originally planned as a short-lived armed demonstration in expectation that the Soviet forces approaching Warsaw would assist in any battle to take the city. The Soviets had never agreed to an intervention, however, and they halted their advance at the Vistula River. The Germans used the opportunity to carry out a brutal suppression of the forces of the pro-Western Polish underground.&lt;templatestyles src=\"Citation/styles.css\"/&gt;[m]\nThe bitterly fought uprising lasted for two months and resulted in the death or expulsion from the city of hundreds of thousands of civilians. After the defeated Poles surrendered on 2 October, the Germans carried out a planned destruction of Warsaw on Hitler's orders that obliterated the remaining infrastructure of the city. The Polish First Army, fighting alongside the Soviet Red Army, entered a devastated Warsaw on 17 January 1945.&lt;templatestyles src=\"Citation/styles.css\"/&gt;[n]\nAllied conferences, Polish governments.\nFrom the time of the Tehran Conference in late 1943, there was broad agreement among the three Great Powers (the United States, the United Kingdom, and the Soviet Union) that the locations of the borders between Germany and Poland and between Poland and the Soviet Union would be fundamentally changed after the conclusion of World War II. Stalin's view that Poland should be moved far to the west was accepted by Polish communists, whose organizations included the Polish Workers' Party and the Union of Polish Patriots. The communist-led State National Council, a quasi-parliamentary body, was in existence in Warsaw from the beginning of 1944. In July 1944, a communist-controlled Polish Committee of National Liberation was established in Lublin, to nominally govern the areas liberated from German control. The move prompted protests from Prime Minister Stanis\u0142aw Miko\u0142ajczyk and his Polish government-in-exile.\nBy the time of the Yalta Conference in February 1945, the communists had already established a Provisional Government of the Republic of Poland. The Soviet position at the conference was strong because of their decisive contribution to the war effort and as a result of their occupation of immense amounts of land in central and eastern Europe. The Great Powers gave assurances that the communist provisional government would be converted into an entity that would include democratic forces from within the country and active abroad, but the London-based government-in-exile was not mentioned. A Provisional Government of National Unity and subsequent democratic elections were the agreed stated goals. The disappointing results of these plans and the failure of the Western powers to ensure a strong participation of non-communists in the immediate post-war Polish government were seen by many Poles as a manifestation of Western betrayal.\nWar losses, extermination of Jews and Poles.\nA lack of accurate data makes it difficult to document numerically the extent of the human losses suffered by Polish citizens during World War II. Additionally, many assertions made in the past must be considered suspect due to flawed methodology and a desire to promote certain political agendas. The last available enumeration of ethnic Poles and the large ethnic minorities is the Polish census of 1931. Exact population figures for 1939 are therefore not known.\nAccording to the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, at least 3 million Polish Jews and at least 1.9 million non-Jewish Polish civilians were killed. According to the historians Brzoza and Sowa, about 2 million ethnic Poles were killed, but it is not known, even approximately, how many Polish citizens of other ethnicities perished, including Ukrainians, Belarusians, and Germans. Millions of Polish citizens were deported to Germany for forced labor or to German extermination camps such as Treblinka, Auschwitz and Sobib\u00f3r. Nazi Germany intended to exterminate the Jews completely, in actions that have come to be described collectively as the Holocaust. The Poles were to be expelled from areas controlled by Nazi Germany through a process of resettlement that started in 1939. Such Nazi operations matured into a plan known as the \"Generalplan Ost\" that amounted to displacement, enslavement and partial extermination of the Slavic people and was expected to be completed within 15 years.\nThe majority of Poles remained indifferent to the Jewish plight, and neither assisted nor persecuted Jews. Of those who have helped rescue, shelter and protect Jews from the Nazi atrocity, Yad Vashem and the State of Israel have recognized 6,992 individuals as \"Righteous Among the Nations\".\nIn an attempt to incapacitate Polish society, the Nazis and the Soviets executed tens of thousands of members of the intelligentsia and community leadership during events such as the German AB-Aktion in Poland, Operation Tannenberg and the Katyn massacre.&lt;templatestyles src=\"Citation/styles.css\"/&gt;[j] Over 95% of the Jewish losses and 90% of the ethnic Polish losses were caused directly by Nazi Germany,&lt;templatestyles src=\"Citation/styles.css\"/&gt;[d] whereas 5% of the ethnic Polish losses were caused by the Soviets and 5% by Ukrainian nationalists. The large-scale Jewish presence in Poland that had endured for centuries was rather quickly put to an end by the policies of extermination implemented by the Nazis during the war. Waves of displacement and emigration that took place both during and after the war removed from Poland a majority of the Jews who survived. Further significant Jewish emigration followed events such as the Polish October political thaw of 1956 and the 1968 Polish political crisis.\nIn 1940\u20131941, some 325,000 Polish citizens were deported by the Soviet Union. The number of Polish citizens who died at the hands of the Soviets is estimated at less than 100,000.\nIn 1943\u20131944, Ukrainian nationalists associated with the Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists (OUN) and the Ukrainian Insurgent Army perpetrated the Massacres of Poles in Volhynia and Eastern Galicia. Estimates of the number of Polish civilian victims vary greatly, from tens to hundreds of thousands.\nApproximately 90% of Poland's war casualties were the victims of prisons, death camps, raids, executions, the annihilation of ghettos, epidemics, starvation, excessive work and ill treatment. The war left one million children orphaned and 590,000 persons disabled. The country lost 38% of its national assets (whereas Britain lost only 0.8%, and France only 1.5%). Nearly half of pre-war Poland was expropriated by the Soviet Union, including the two great cultural centers of Lw\u00f3w and Wilno.\nThe policies of Nazi Germany have been judged after the war by the International Military Tribunal at the Nuremberg trials and Polish genocide trials to be aimed at extermination of Jews, Poles and Roma, and to have \"all the characteristics of genocide in the biological meaning of this term\".\nChanging boundaries and population transfers.\nBy the terms of the 1945 Potsdam Agreement signed by the three victorious Great Powers, the Soviet Union retained most of the territories captured as a result of the Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop Pact of 1939, including western Ukraine and western Belarus, and gained others. Lithuania and the K\u00f6nigsberg area of East Prussia were officially incorporated into the Soviet Union, in the case of the former without the recognition of the Western powers.\nPoland was compensated with the bulk of Silesia, including Breslau (Wroc\u0142aw) and Gr\u00fcnberg (Zielona G\u00f3ra), the bulk of Pomerania, including Stettin (Szczecin), and the greater southern portion of the former East Prussia, along with Danzig (Gda\u0144sk), pending a final peace conference with Germany which eventually never took place.\nCollectively referred to by the Polish authorities as the \"Recovered Territories\", they were included in the reconstituted Polish state. With Germany's defeat Poland was thus shifted west in relation to its prewar location, to the area between the Oder\u2013Neisse and Curzon lines, which resulted in a country more compact and with much broader access to the sea.&lt;templatestyles src=\"Citation/styles.css\"/&gt;[c] The Poles lost 70% of their pre-war oil capacity to the Soviets, but gained from the Germans a highly developed industrial base and infrastructure that made a diversified industrial economy possible for the first time in Polish history.\nThe flight and expulsion of Germans from what was eastern Germany prior to the war began before and during the Soviet conquest of those regions from the Nazis, and the process continued in the years immediately after the war.\n8,030,000 Germans were evacuated, expelled, or migrated by 1950.\nEarly expulsions in Poland were undertaken by the Polish communist authorities even before the Potsdam Conference (the \"wild expulsions\" from June to mid July 1945, when the Polish military and militia expelled nearly all people from the districts immediately east of the Oder\u2013Neisse line), to ensure the establishment of ethnically homogeneous Poland. About 1% (100,000) of the German civilian population east of the Oder\u2013Neisse line perished in the fighting prior to the surrender in May 1945, and afterwards some 200,000 Germans in Poland were employed as forced labor prior to being expelled. Many Germans died in labor camps such as the Zgoda labour camp and the Potulice camp. Of those Germans who remained within the new borders of Poland, many later chose to emigrate to post-war Germany.\nOn the other hand, 1.5\u20132 million ethnic Poles moved or were expelled from the previously Polish areas annexed by the Soviet Union. The vast majority were resettled in the former German territories. At least one million Poles remained in what had become the Soviet Union, and at least half a million ended up in the West or elsewhere outside of Poland. However, contrary to the official declaration that the former German inhabitants of the Recovered Territories had to be removed quickly to house Poles displaced by the Soviet annexation, the Recovered Territories initially faced a severe population shortage.\nMany exiled Poles could not return to the country for which they had fought because they belonged to political groups incompatible with the new communist regimes, or because they originated from areas of pre-war eastern Poland that were incorporated into the Soviet Union (see Polish population transfers (1944\u20131946)). Some were deterred from returning simply on the strength of warnings that anyone who had served in military units in the West would be endangered. Many Poles were pursued, arrested, tortured and imprisoned by the Soviet authorities for belonging to the Home Army or other formations (see Anti-communist resistance in Poland (1944\u20131946)), or were persecuted because they had fought on the Western front.\nTerritories on both sides of the new Polish-Ukrainian border were also \"ethnically cleansed\". Of the Ukrainians and Lemkos living in Poland within the new borders (about 700,000), close to 95% were forcibly moved to the Soviet Ukraine, or (in 1947) to the new territories in northern and western Poland under Operation Vistula. In Volhynia, 98% of the Polish pre-war population was either killed or expelled; in Eastern Galicia, the Polish population was reduced by 92%. According to Timothy D. Snyder, about 70,000 Poles and about 20,000 Ukrainians were killed in the ethnic violence that occurred in the 1940s, both during and after the war.\nAccording to an estimate by historian Jan Grabowski, about 50,000 of the 250,000 Polish Jews who escaped the Nazis during the liquidation of ghettos survived without leaving Poland (the remainder perished). More were repatriated from the Soviet Union and elsewhere, and the February 1946 population census showed about 300,000 Jews within Poland's new borders.&lt;templatestyles src=\"Citation/styles.css\"/&gt;[e] Of the surviving Jews, many chose to emigrate or felt compelled to because of the anti-Jewish violence in Poland.\nBecause of changing borders and the mass movements of people of various nationalities, the emerging communist Poland ended up with a mainly homogeneous, ethnically Polish population (97.6% according to the December 1950 census). The remaining members of ethnic minorities were not encouraged, by the authorities or by their neighbors, to emphasize their ethnic identities.&lt;templatestyles src=\"Citation/styles.css\"/&gt;[i]&lt;templatestyles src=\"Citation/styles.css\"/&gt;[a1]\nPolish People's Republic (1945\u20131989).\nPost-war struggle for power.\nIn response to the February 1945 Yalta Conference directives, a Polish Provisional Government of National Unity was formed in June 1945 under Soviet auspices; it was soon recognized by the United States and many other countries. The Soviet domination was apparent from the beginning, as prominent leaders of the Polish Underground State were brought to trial in Moscow (the \"Trial of the Sixteen\" of June 1945). In the immediate post-war years, the emerging communist rule was challenged by opposition groups, including militarily by the so-called \"cursed soldiers\", of whom thousands perished in armed confrontations or were pursued by the Ministry of Public Security and executed. Such guerillas often pinned their hopes on expectations of an imminent outbreak of World War III and defeat of the Soviet Union. The Polish right-wing insurgency faded after the amnesty of February 1947.\nThe Polish people's referendum of June 1946 was arranged by the communist Polish Workers' Party to legitimize its dominance in Polish politics and claim widespread support for the party's policies. Although the Yalta agreement called for free elections, the Polish legislative election of January 1947 was controlled by the communists. Some democratic and pro-Western elements, led by Stanis\u0142aw Miko\u0142ajczyk, former prime minister-in-exile, participated in the Provisional Government and the 1947 elections, but were ultimately eliminated through electoral fraud, intimidation and violence. In times of severe political confrontation and radical economic change, members of Miko\u0142ajczyk's agrarian movement (the Polish People's Party) attempted to preserve the existing aspects of mixed economy and protect property and other rights. However, after the 1947 elections, the Government of National Unity ceased to exist and the communists moved towards abolishing the post-war partially pluralistic \"people's democracy\" and replacing it with a state socialist system. The communist-dominated front Democratic Bloc of the 1947 elections, turned into the Front of National Unity in 1952, became officially the source of governmental authority. The Polish government-in-exile, lacking international recognition, remained in continuous existence until 1990.\nUnder Stalinism (1948\u20131955).\nThe Polish People's Republic (\"Polska Rzeczpospolita Ludowa\") was established under the rule of the communist Polish United Workers' Party (PZPR). The name change from the Polish Republic was not officially adopted, however, until the proclamation of the Constitution of the Polish People's Republic in 1952.\nThe ruling PZPR was formed by the forced amalgamation in December 1948 of the communist Polish Workers' Party (PPR) and the historically non-communist Polish Socialist Party (PPS). The PPR chief had been its wartime leader W\u0142adys\u0142aw Gomu\u0142ka, who in 1947 declared a \"Polish road to socialism\" as intended to curb, rather than eradicate, capitalist elements. In 1948 he was overruled, removed and imprisoned by Stalinist authorities. The PPS, re-established in 1944 by its left wing, had since been allied with the communists. The ruling communists, who in post-war Poland preferred to use the term \"socialism\" instead of \"communism\" to identify their ideological basis,&lt;templatestyles src=\"Citation/styles.css\"/&gt;[f] needed to include the socialist junior partner to broaden their appeal, claim greater legitimacy and eliminate competition on the political Left. The socialists, who were losing their organization, were subjected to political pressure, ideological cleansing and purges in order to become suitable for unification on the terms of the PPR. The leading pro-communist leaders of the socialists were the prime ministers Edward Os\u00f3bka-Morawski and J\u00f3zef Cyrankiewicz.\nDuring the most oppressive phase of the Stalinist period (1948\u20131953), terror was justified in Poland as necessary to eliminate reactionary subversion. Many thousands of perceived dissidents were arbitrarily tried and large numbers were executed.&lt;templatestyles src=\"Citation/styles.css\"/&gt;[u] The People's Republic was led by discredited Soviet operatives such as Boles\u0142aw Bierut, Jakub Berman and Konstantin Rokossovsky. The independent Catholic Church in Poland was subjected to property confiscations and other curtailments from 1949, and in 1950 was pressured into signing an accord with the government. In 1953 and later, despite a partial thaw after the death of Stalin that year, the persecution of the Church intensified and its head, Cardinal Stefan Wyszy\u0144ski, was detained. A key event in the persecution of the Polish Church was the Stalinist show trial of the Krak\u00f3w Curia in January 1953.\nIn the Warsaw Pact, formed in 1955, the Polish Army was the second largest, after the Soviet Army.\nEconomic and social developments of the early communist era.\nIn 1944, large agricultural holdings and former German property in Poland started to be redistributed through land reform, and industry started to be nationalized. Communist restructuring and the imposition of work-space rules encountered active worker opposition already in the years 1945\u20131947. The moderate Three-Year Plan of 1947\u20131949 continued with the rebuilding, socialization and socialist restructuring of the economy. It was followed by the Six-Year Plan of 1950\u20131955 for heavy industry. The rejection of the Marshall Plan in 1947 made aspirations for catching up with West European standards of living unrealistic.\nThe government's highest economic priority was the development of heavy industry useful to the military. State-run or controlled institutions common in all the socialist countries of eastern Europe were imposed on Poland, including collective farms and worker cooperatives. The latter were dismantled in the late 1940s as not socialist enough, although they were later re-established; even small-scale private enterprises were eradicated. Stalinism introduced heavy political and ideological propaganda and indoctrination in social life, culture and education.\nGreat strides were made, however, in the areas of employment (which became nearly full), universal public education (which nearly eradicated adult illiteracy), health care and recreational amenities. Many historic sites, including the central districts of Warsaw and Gda\u0144sk, both devastated during the war, were rebuilt at great cost.\nThe communist industrialization program led to increased urbanization and educational and career opportunities for the intended beneficiaries of the social transformation, along the lines of the peasants-workers-working intelligentsia paradigm. The most significant improvement was accomplished in the lives of Polish peasants, many of whom were able to leave their impoverished and overcrowded village communities for better conditions in urban centers. Those who stayed behind took advantage of the implementation of the 1944 land reform decree of the Polish Committee of National Liberation, which terminated the antiquated but widespread parafeudal socioeconomic relations in Poland. The Stalinist attempts at establishing collective farms generally failed. Due to urbanization, the national percentage of the rural population decreased in communist Poland by about 50%. A majority of Poland's residents of cities and towns still live in apartment blocks built during the communist era, in part to accommodate migrants from rural areas.\nThe Thaw and Gomu\u0142ka's Polish October (1955\u20131958).\nIn March 1956, after the 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union in Moscow ushered in de-Stalinization, Edward Ochab was chosen to replace the deceased Boles\u0142aw Bierut as first secretary of the Polish United Workers' Party. As a result, Poland was rapidly overtaken by social restlessness and reformist undertakings; thousands of political prisoners were released and many people previously persecuted were officially rehabilitated. Worker riots in Pozna\u0144 in June 1956 were violently suppressed, but they gave rise to the formation of a reformist current within the communist party.\nAmidst the continuing social and national upheaval, a further shakeup took place in the party leadership as part of what is known as the Polish October of 1956.&lt;templatestyles src=\"Citation/styles.css\"/&gt;[k] While retaining most traditional communist economic and social aims, the state under W\u0142adys\u0142aw Gomu\u0142ka, the new first secretary of the PZPR, liberalized internal life in Poland. The dependence on the Soviet Union was somewhat mollified, and the state's relationships with the Church and Catholic lay activists were put on a new footing. A repatriation agreement with the Soviet Union allowed the repatriation of hundreds of thousands of Poles who were still in Soviet hands, including many former political prisoners. Collectivization efforts were abandoned\u2014agricultural land, unlike in other Comecon countries, remained for the most part in the private ownership of farming families. State-mandated provisions of agricultural products at fixed, artificially low prices were reduced, and from 1972 eliminated.\nThe legislative election of 1957 was followed by several years of political stability that was accompanied by economic stagnation and curtailment of reforms and reformists. One of the last initiatives of the brief reform era was a nuclear weapons\u2013free zone in Central Europe proposed in 1957 by Adam Rapacki, Poland's foreign minister.\nCulture in the Polish People's Republic, to varying degrees linked to the intelligentsia's opposition to the authoritarian system, developed to a sophisticated level under Gomu\u0142ka and his successors. The creative process was often compromised by state censorship, but significant works were created in fields such as literature, theater, cinema and music, among others. Journalism of veiled understanding and varieties of native and Western popular culture were well represented. Uncensored information and works generated by \u00e9migr\u00e9 circles were conveyed through a variety of channels. The Paris-based \"Kultura\" magazine developed a conceptual framework for dealing with the issues of borders and the neighbors of a future free Poland, but for ordinary Poles Radio Free Europe was of foremost importance.\nStagnation and crackdown (1958\u20131970).\nOne of the confirmations of the end of an era of greater tolerance was the expulsion from the communist party of several prominent \"Marxist revisionists\" in the 1960s.\nIn 1965, the Conference of Polish Bishops issued the Letter of Reconciliation of the Polish Bishops to the German Bishops, a gesture intended to heal bad mutual feelings left over from World War II. In 1966, the celebrations of the 1,000th anniversary of the Christianization of Poland led by Cardinal Stefan Wyszy\u0144ski and other bishops turned into a huge demonstration of the power and popularity of the Catholic Church in Poland.\nThe post-1956 liberalizing trend, in decline for a number of years, was reversed in March 1968, when student demonstrations were suppressed during the 1968 Polish political crisis. Motivated in part by the Prague Spring movement, the Polish opposition leaders, intellectuals, academics and students used a historical-patriotic \"Dziady\" theater spectacle series in Warsaw (and its termination forced by the authorities) as a springboard for protests, which soon spread to other centers of higher education and turned nationwide. The authorities responded with a major crackdown on opposition activity, including the firing of faculty and the dismissal of students at universities and other institutions of learning. At the center of the controversy was also the small number of Catholic deputies in the Sejm (the Znak Association members) who attempted to defend the students.\nIn an official speech, Gomu\u0142ka drew attention to the role of Jewish activists in the events taking place. This provided ammunition to a nationalistic and antisemitic communist party faction headed by Mieczys\u0142aw Moczar that was opposed to Gomu\u0142ka's leadership. Using the context of the military victory of Israel in the Six-Day War of 1967, some in the Polish communist leadership waged an antisemitic campaign against the remnants of the Jewish community in Poland. The targets of this campaign were accused of disloyalty and active sympathy with Israeli aggression. Branded \"Zionists\", they were scapegoated and blamed for the unrest in March 1968, which eventually led to the emigration of much of Poland's remaining Jewish population (about 15,000 Polish citizens left the country).\nWith the active support of the Gomu\u0142ka regime, the Polish People's Army took part in the infamous Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia in August 1968, after the Brezhnev Doctrine was informally announced.\nIn the final major achievement of Gomu\u0142ka diplomacy, the governments of Poland and West Germany signed in December 1970 the Treaty of Warsaw, which normalized their relations and made possible meaningful cooperation in a number of areas of bilateral interest. In particular, West Germany recognized the post-World War II \"de facto\" border between Poland and East Germany.\nWorker revolts, reforms of Gierek, the Polish pope and Solidarity (1970\u20131981).\nPrice increases for essential consumer goods triggered the Polish protests of 1970. In December, there were disturbances and strikes in the Baltic Sea port cities of Gda\u0144sk, Gdynia, and Szczecin that reflected deep dissatisfaction with living and working conditions in the country. The activity was centered in the industrial shipyard areas of the three coastal cities. Dozens of protesting workers and bystanders were killed in police and military actions, generally under the authority of Gomu\u0142ka and Minister of Defense Wojciech Jaruzelski. In the aftermath, Edward Gierek replaced Gomu\u0142ka as first secretary of the communist party. The new regime was seen as more modern, friendly and pragmatic, and at first it enjoyed a degree of popular and foreign support.&lt;templatestyles src=\"Citation/styles.css\"/&gt;[g]&lt;templatestyles src=\"Citation/styles.css\"/&gt;[o]\nTo revitalize the economy, from 1971 the Gierek regime introduced wide-ranging reforms that involved large-scale foreign borrowing. These actions initially caused improved conditions for consumers, but in a few years the strategy backfired and the economy deteriorated. Another attempt to raise food prices resulted in the June 1976 protests. The Workers' Defence Committee (KOR), established in response to the crackdown that followed, consisted of dissident intellectuals determined to support industrial workers, farmers and students persecuted by the authorities. The opposition circles active in the late 1970s were emboldened by the Helsinki Conference processes.\nIn October 1978, the Archbishop of Krak\u00f3w, Cardinal Karol J\u00f3zef Wojty\u0142a, became Pope John Paul II, head of the Catholic Church. Catholics and others rejoiced at the elevation of a Pole to the papacy and greeted his June 1979 visit to Poland with an outpouring of emotion.\nFueled by large infusions of Western credit, Poland's economic growth rate was one of the world's highest during the first half of the 1970s, but much of the borrowed capital was misspent, and the centrally planned economy was unable to use the new resources effectively. The 1973 oil crisis caused recession and high interest rates in the West, to which the Polish government had to respond with sharp domestic consumer price increases. The growing debt burden became insupportable in the late 1970s, and negative economic growth set in by 1979.\nAround 1 July 1980, with the Polish foreign debt standing at more than $20 billion, the government made yet another attempt to increase meat prices. Workers responded with escalating work stoppages that culminated in the 1980 general strikes in Lublin. In mid-August, labor protests at the Gda\u0144sk Shipyard gave rise to a chain reaction of strikes that virtually paralyzed the Baltic coast by the end of the month and, for the first time, closed most coal mines in Silesia. The Inter-Enterprise Strike Committee coordinated the strike action across hundreds of workplaces and formulated the 21 demands as the basis for negotiations with the authorities. The Strike Committee was sovereign in its decision-making, but was aided by a team of \"expert\" advisers that included the well-known dissidents Jacek Kuro\u0144, Karol Modzelewski, Bronis\u0142aw Geremek and Tadeusz Mazowiecki.\nOn 31 August 1980, representatives of workers at the Gda\u0144sk Shipyard, led by an electrician and activist Lech Wa\u0142\u0119sa, signed the Gda\u0144sk Agreement with the government that ended their strike. Similar agreements were concluded in Szczecin (the Szczecin Agreement) and in Silesia. The key provision of these agreements was the guarantee of the workers' right to form independent trade unions and the right to strike. Following the successful resolution of the largest labor confrontation in communist Poland's history, nationwide union organizing movements swept the country.\nEdward Gierek was blamed by the Soviets for not following their \"fraternal\" advice, not shoring up the communist party and the official trade unions and allowing \"anti-socialist\" forces to emerge. On 5 September 1980, Gierek was replaced by Stanis\u0142aw Kania as first secretary of the PZPR.\nDelegates of the emergent worker committees from all over Poland gathered in Gda\u0144sk on 17 September and decided to form a single national union organization named \"Solidarity\".\nWhile party\u2013controlled courts took up the contentious issues of Solidarity's legal registration as a trade union (finalized by November 10), planning had already begun for the imposition of martial law. A parallel farmers' union was organized and strongly opposed by the regime, but Rural Solidarity was eventually registered (12 May 1981). In the meantime, a rapid deterioration of the authority of the communist party, disintegration of state power and escalation of demands and threats by the various Solidarity\u2013affiliated groups were occurring. According to Kuro\u0144, a \"tremendous social democratization movement in all spheres\" was taking place and could not be contained. Wa\u0142\u0119sa had meetings with Kania, which brought no resolution to the impasse.\nFollowing the Warsaw Pact summit in Moscow, the Soviet Union proceeded with a massive military build-up along Poland's border in December 1980, but during the summit Kania forcefully argued with Leonid Brezhnev and other allied communists leaders against the feasibility of an external military intervention, and no action was taken. The United States, under presidents Jimmy Carter and Ronald Reagan, repeatedly warned the Soviets about the consequences of a direct intervention, while discouraging an open insurrection in Poland and signaling to the Polish opposition that there would be no rescue by the NATO forces.\nIn February 1981, Defense Minister General Wojciech Jaruzelski assumed the position of prime minister. The Solidarity social revolt had thus far been free of any major use of force, but in March 1981 in Bydgoszcz three activists were beaten up by the secret police. In a nationwide \"warning strike\" the 9.5-million-strong Solidarity union was supported by the population at large, but a general strike was called off by Wa\u0142\u0119sa after the 30 March settlement with the government. Both Solidarity and the communist party were badly split and the Soviets were losing patience. Kania was re-elected at the Party Congress in July, but the collapse of the economy continued and so did the general disorder.\nAt the first Solidarity National Congress in September\u2013October 1981 in Gda\u0144sk, Lech Wa\u0142\u0119sa was elected national chairman of the union with 55% of the vote. An appeal was issued to the workers of the other East European countries, urging them to follow in the footsteps of Solidarity. To the Soviets, the gathering was an \"anti-socialist and anti-Soviet orgy\" and the Polish communist leaders, increasingly led by Jaruzelski and General Czes\u0142aw Kiszczak, were ready to apply force.\nIn October 1981, Jaruzelski was named first secretary of the PZPR. The Plenum's vote was 180 to 4, and he kept his government posts. Jaruzelski asked parliament to ban strikes and allow him to exercise extraordinary powers, but when neither request was granted, he decided to proceed with his plans anyway.\nThe martial law, Jaruzelski's rule and the end of communism (1981\u20131989).\nOn 12\u201313 December 1981, the regime declared martial law in Poland, under which the army and the ZOMO special police forces were used to crush Solidarity. The Soviet leaders insisted that Jaruzelski pacifies the opposition with the forces at his disposal, without Soviet involvement. Almost all Solidarity leaders and many affiliated intellectuals were arrested or detained. Nine workers were killed in the Pacification of Wujek. The United States and other Western countries responded by imposing economic sanctions against Poland and the Soviet Union. Unrest in the country was subdued, but continued.\nDuring martial law, Poland was ruled by the so-called Military Council of National Salvation. The open or semi-open opposition communications, as recently practiced, were replaced by underground publishing (known in the eastern bloc as Samizdat), and Solidarity was reduced to a few thousand underground activists.\nHaving achieved some semblance of stability, the Polish regime relaxed and then rescinded martial law over several stages. By December 1982 martial law was suspended and a small number of political prisoners, including Wa\u0142\u0119sa, were released. Although martial law formally ended in July 1983 and a partial amnesty was enacted, several hundred political prisoners remained in jail. Jerzy Popie\u0142uszko, a popular pro-Solidarity priest, was abducted and murdered by security functionaries in October 1984.\nFurther developments in Poland occurred concurrently with and were influenced by the reformist leadership of Mikhail Gorbachev in the Soviet Union (processes known as Glasnost and Perestroika). In September 1986, a general amnesty was declared and the government released nearly all political prisoners. However, the country lacked basic stability, as the regime's efforts to organize society from the top down had failed, while the opposition's attempts at creating an \"alternate society\" were also unsuccessful. With the economic crisis unresolved and societal institutions dysfunctional, both the ruling establishment and the opposition began looking for ways out of the stalemate. Facilitated by the indispensable mediation of the Catholic Church, exploratory contacts were established.\nStudent protests resumed in February 1988. Continuing economic decline led to strikes across the country in April, May and August. The Soviet Union, increasingly destabilized, was unwilling to apply military or other pressure to prop up allied regimes in trouble. The Polish government felt compelled to negotiate with the opposition and in September 1988 preliminary talks with Solidarity leaders ensued in Magdalenka. Numerous meetings that took place involved Wa\u0142\u0119sa and General Kiszczak, among others. In November, the regime made a major public relations mistake by allowing a televised debate between Wa\u0142\u0119sa and Alfred Miodowicz, chief of the All-Poland Alliance of Trade Unions, the official trade union organization. The fitful bargaining and intra-party squabbling led to the official Round Table Negotiations in 1989, followed by the Polish legislative election in June of that year, a watershed event marking the fall of communism in Poland.\nThird Polish Republic (1989\u2013today).\nSystemic transition.\nThe Polish Round Table Agreement of April 1989 called for local self-government, policies of job guarantees, legalization of independent trade unions and many wide-ranging reforms. The current Sejm promptly implemented the deal and agreed to National Assembly elections that were set for 4 June and 18 June. Only 35% of the seats in the Sejm (national legislature's lower house) and all of the Senate seats were freely contested; the remaining Sejm seats (65%) were guaranteed for the communists and their allies.\nThe failure of the communists at the polls (almost all of the contested seats were won by the opposition) resulted in a political crisis. The new April Novelization to the constitution called for re-establishment of the Polish presidency and on 19 July the National Assembly elected the communist leader, General Wojciech Jaruzelski, to that office. His election, seen at the time as politically necessary, was barely accomplished with tacit support from some Solidarity deputies, and the new president's position was not strong. Moreover, the unexpected definitiveness of the parliamentary election results created new political dynamics and attempts by the communists to form a government failed.\nOn 19 August, President Jaruzelski asked journalist and Solidarity activist Tadeusz Mazowiecki to form a government; on 12 September, the Sejm voted approval of Prime Minister Mazowiecki and his cabinet. Mazowiecki decided to leave the economic reform entirely in the hands of economic liberals led by the new Deputy Prime Minister Leszek Balcerowicz, who proceeded with the design and implementation of his \"shock therapy\" policy. For the first time in post-war history, Poland had a government led by non-communists, setting a precedent soon to be followed by other Eastern Bloc nations in a phenomenon known as the Revolutions of 1989. Mazowiecki's acceptance of the \"thick line\" formula meant that there would be no \"witch-hunt\", i.e., an absence of revenge seeking or exclusion from politics in regard to former communist officials.\nIn part because of the attempted indexation of wages, inflation reached 900% by the end of 1989, but was soon dealt with by means of radical methods. In December 1989, the Sejm approved the Balcerowicz Plan to transform the Polish economy rapidly from a centrally planned one to a free market economy.&lt;templatestyles src=\"Citation/styles.css\"/&gt;[v] The Constitution of the Polish People's Republic was amended to eliminate references to the \"leading role\" of the communist party and the country was renamed the \"Republic of Poland\". The communist Polish United Workers' Party dissolved itself in January 1990. In its place, a new party, Social Democracy of the Republic of Poland, was created. \"Territorial self-government\", abolished in 1950, was legislated back in March 1990, to be led by locally elected officials; its fundamental unit was the administratively independent gmina.&lt;templatestyles src=\"Citation/styles.css\"/&gt;[q]\nIn October 1990, the constitution was amended to curtail the term of President Jaruzelski. In November 1990, the German\u2013Polish Border Treaty, with unified Germany, was signed.\nIn November 1990, Lech Wa\u0142\u0119sa was elected president for a five-year term; in December, he became the first popularly elected president of Poland. Poland's first free parliamentary election was held in October 1991. 18 parties entered the new Sejm, but the largest representation received only 12% of the total vote.\nDemocratic constitution, NATO and European Union memberships.\nThere were several post-Solidarity governments between the 1989 election and the 1993 election, after which the \"post-communist\" left-wing parties took over. In 1993, the formerly Soviet Northern Group of Forces, a vestige of past domination, left Poland.\nIn 1995, Aleksander Kwa\u015bniewski of the Social Democratic Party was elected president and remained in that capacity for the next ten years (two terms).\nIn 1997, the new Constitution of Poland was finalized and approved in a referendum; it replaced the Small Constitution of 1992, an amended version of the communist constitution.\nPoland joined NATO in 1999. Elements of the Polish Armed Forces have since participated in the Iraq War and the War in Afghanistan (2001\u20132021). Poland joined the European Union as part of its enlargement in 2004. However, Poland has not adopted the euro as its currency and legal tender, but instead uses the Polish z\u0142oty.\nIn April 2010, Polish president Lech Kaczynski and dozens of the country's top political and military leaders died in the Smolensk air disaster.\nAfter the election of the far-right conservative Law and Justice party in 2015, the Polish government repeatedly clashed with EU institutions on the issue of judicial reform and was accused by the European Commission and the European Parliament of undermining \"European Values\" and eroding democratic standards. However, the Polish government headed by the Law and Justice party maintained that the reforms were necessary due to the prevalence of corruption within the Polish judiciary and the continued presence of holdover Communist era judges.\nIn October 2019, Poland's governing Law and Justice party (PiS) won parliamentary election, keeping its majority in the lower house. The second was centrist Civic Coalition (KO). The government of Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki continued. However, PiS leader Jaros\u0142aw Kaczy\u0144ski was considered the most powerful political figure in Poland although not a member of government. In July 2020, President Andrzej Duda, supported by PiS, was re-elected.\nPoland was one of neighbouring Ukraine's most ardent supporters after the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine. As of November 2022, Poland had received more than 1.5 million Ukrainian refugees since the beginning of the war. In September 2023, however, Poland said that it would stop supplying arms to Ukraine and instead focus on its own defense. Poland's decision to ban importing Ukrainian grain, in order to protect its own farmers, had caused tension between the two countries.\nIn October 2023, the ruling Law and Justice (PiS) party won the largest share of the vote in the election, but lost its majority in parliament. In December 2023, Donald Tusk became the new Prime Minister to succeed Morawiecki, leading a coalition of three parliamentary groups made up of Civic Coalition, Third Way, and The Left. Law and Justice became the leading opposition party.\nTensions between Poland and its eastern neighbour, Belarus, reached a new high in June 2024 when Belarus, who had encouraged masses of illegal immigrants to cross the Polish border on foot as part of the undeclared dirty tricks campaign of its CSTO ally Russia, created the conditions in which a Polish border ground was stabbed to death by a would-be immigrant. The Polish state soon tightened controls of its frontier and on 27 July 2024 the Sejm passed a law which liberalized the use of firearms by border patrols.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\n\"a.\"&lt;templatestyles src=\"Citation/styles.css\"/&gt;^ Pi\u0142sudski's family roots in the Polonized gentry of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania and the resulting perspective of seeing himself and people like him as legitimate Lithuanians put him in conflict with modern Lithuanian nationalists (who in Pi\u0142sudski's lifetime redefined the scope and meaning of the \"Lithuanian\" identity), and, by extension, with other nationalists including the Polish modern nationalist movement.\n\"b.\"&lt;templatestyles src=\"Citation/styles.css\"/&gt;^ In 1938, Poland and Romania refused to agree to a Franco-British proposal that in the event of war with Nazi Germany, Soviet forces would be allowed to cross their territories to aid Czechoslovakia. The Polish ruling elites considered the Soviets in some ways more threatening than the Nazis.\nThe Soviet Union repeatedly declared its intention to fulfill its obligations under the 1935 treaty with Czechoslovakia and defend Czechoslovakia militarily. A transfer of land and air forces through Poland and/or Romania was required, and the Soviets approached the French, who also had a treaty with Czechoslovakia (and with Poland and with the Soviet Union). Edward Rydz-\u015amig\u0142y rebuked the French suggestion on that matter in 1936, and in 1938 J\u00f3zef Beck pressured Romania not to allow even Soviet warplanes to fly over its territory. Like Hungary, Poland was looking into using the German-Czechoslovak conflict to settle its own territorial grievances, namely disputes over parts of Trans-Olza, Spi\u0161 and Orava.\n\"c.\"&lt;templatestyles src=\"Citation/styles.css\"/&gt;^ In October 1939, the British Foreign Office notified the Soviets that the United Kingdom would be satisfied with a postwar creation of small ethnic Poland, patterned after the Duchy of Warsaw. An establishment of Poland restricted to \"minimal size\", according to ethnographic boundaries (such as the lands common to both the prewar Poland and postwar Poland), was planned by the Soviet People's Commissariat for Foreign Affairs in 1943\u20131944. Such territorial reduction was recommended by Ivan Maisky to Vyacheslav Molotov in early 1944, because of what Maisky saw as Poland's historically unfriendly disposition toward Russia and the Soviet Union, likely in some way to continue. Joseph Stalin opted for a larger version, allowing a \"swap\" (territorial compensation for Poland), which involved the eastern lands gained by Poland at the Peace of Riga of 1921 and now lost, and eastern Germany conquered from the Nazis in 1944\u20131945. In regard to the several major disputed areas: Lower Silesia west of the Oder and the Eastern Neisse rivers (the British wanted it to remain a part of the future German state), Stettin (in 1945 the German communists already established their administration there), \"Zakerzonia\" (western Red Ruthenia demanded by the Ukrainians), and the Bia\u0142ystok region (Bia\u0142ystok was claimed by the communists of the Byelorussian SSR), the Soviet leader made decisions that favored Poland.\nOther territorial and ethnic scenarios were also possible, generally with possible outcomes less advantageous to Poland than the form the country assumed.\n\"d.\"&lt;templatestyles src=\"Citation/styles.css\"/&gt;^ Timothy D. Snyder spoke of about 100,000 Jews killed by Poles during the Nazi occupation, the majority probably by members of the collaborationist Blue Police. This number would have likely been many times higher had Poland entered into an alliance with Germany in 1939, as advocated by some Polish historians and others.\n\"e.\"&lt;templatestyles src=\"Citation/styles.css\"/&gt;^ Some may have falsely claimed the Jewish identity hoping for permission to emigrate. The communist authorities, pursuing the concept of Poland of single ethnicity (in accordance with the recent border changes and expulsions), were allowing the Jews to leave the country. For a discussion of early communist Poland's ethnic politics, see Timothy D. Snyder, \"The Reconstruction of Nations\", chapters on modern \"Ukrainian Borderland\".\n\"f.\"&lt;templatestyles src=\"Citation/styles.css\"/&gt;^ A Communist Party of Poland had existed in the past, but was eliminated in Stalin's purges in 1938.\n\"g.\"&lt;templatestyles src=\"Citation/styles.css\"/&gt;^ The Soviet leadership, which had previously ordered the crushing of the Uprising of 1953 in East Germany, the Hungarian Revolution of 1956 and the Prague Spring in 1968, in late 1970 became worried about potential demoralizing effects that deployment against Polish workers would have on the Polish army, a crucial Warsaw Pact component. The Soviets withdrew their support for Gomu\u0142ka, who insisted on the use of force; he and his close associates were subsequently ousted from the Polish Politburo by the Polish Central Committee.\n\"h.\"&lt;templatestyles src=\"Citation/styles.css\"/&gt;^ East of the Molotov-Ribbentrop line, the population was 43% Polish, 33% Ukrainian, 8% Belarusian and 8% Jewish. The Soviet Union did not want to appear as an aggressor, and moved its troops to eastern Poland under the pretext of offering protection to \"the kindred Ukrainian and Belorussian people\".\n\"i.\"&lt;templatestyles src=\"Citation/styles.css\"/&gt;^ Joseph Stalin at the 1943 Tehran Conference discussed with Winston Churchill and Franklin D. Roosevelt new post-war borders in central-eastern Europe, including the shape of a future Poland. He endorsed the Piast Concept, which justified a massive shift of Poland's frontiers to the west. Stalin resolved to secure and stabilize the western reaches of the Soviet Union and disable the future military potential of Germany by constructing a compact and ethnically defined Poland (along with the Soviet ethnic Ukraine, Belarus and Lithuania) and by radically altering the region's system of national borders. After 1945, the Polish communist regime wholeheartedly adopted and promoted the Piast Concept, making it the centerpiece of their claim to be the true inheritors of Polish nationalism. After all the killings and population transfers during and after the war, the country was 99% \"Polish\".\n\"j.\"&lt;templatestyles src=\"Citation/styles.css\"/&gt;^ \"All the currently available documents of Nazi administration show that, together with the Jews, the stratum of the Polish intelligentsia was marked for total extermination. In fact, Nazi Germany achieved this goal almost by half, since Poland lost 50 percent of her citizens with university diplomas and 35 percent of those with a gimnazium diploma.\" According to Brzoza and Sowa, 450,000 of Polish citizens had completed higher, secondary, or trade school education by the outbreak of the war. 37.5% of people with higher education perished, 30% of those with general secondary education, and 53.3% of trade school graduates.\n\"k.\"&lt;templatestyles src=\"Citation/styles.css\"/&gt;^ Decisive political events took place in Poland shortly before the Hungarian Revolution of 1956. W\u0142adys\u0142aw Gomu\u0142ka, a reformist party leader, was reinstated to the Politburo of the PZPR and the Eighth Plenum of its Central Committee was announced to convene on 19 October 1956, all without seeking a Soviet approval. The Soviet Union responded with military moves and intimidation and its \"military-political delegation\", led by Nikita Khrushchev, quickly arrived in Warsaw. Gomu\u0142ka tried to convince them of his loyalty but insisted on the reforms that he considered essential, including a replacement of Poland's Soviet-trusted minister of defense, Konstantin Rokossovsky. The disconcerted Soviets returned to Moscow, the PZPR Plenum elected Gomu\u0142ka first secretary and removed Rokossovsky from the Politburo. On 21 October, the Soviet Presidium followed Khrushchev's lead and decided unanimously to \"refrain from military intervention\" in Poland, a decision likely influenced also by the ongoing preparations for the invasion of Hungary. The Soviet gamble paid off, because Gomu\u0142ka in the coming years turned out to be a very dependable Soviet ally and an orthodox communist.\nHowever, unlike the other Warsaw Pact countries, Poland did not endorse the Soviet armed intervention in Hungary. The Hungarian Revolution was intensely supported by the Polish public.\n\"l.\"&lt;templatestyles src=\"Citation/styles.css\"/&gt;^ The delayed reinforcements were coming and the government military commanders General Tadeusz Rozwadowski and W\u0142adys\u0142aw Anders wanted to keep on fighting the coup perpetrators, but President Stanis\u0142aw Wojciechowski and the government decided to surrender to prevent the imminent spread of civil war. The coup brought to power the \"Sanation\" regime under J\u00f3zef Pi\u0142sudski (Edward Rydz-\u015amig\u0142y after Pi\u0142sudski's death). The Sanation regime persecuted the opposition within the military and in general. Rozwadowski died after abusive imprisonment, according to some accounts murdered. Another major opponent of Pi\u0142sudski, General W\u0142odzimierz Zag\u00f3rski, disappeared in 1927. According to Aleksandra Pi\u0142sudska, the marshal's wife, following the coup and for the rest of his life Pi\u0142sudski lost his composure and appeared over-burdened.\nAt the time of Rydz-\u015amig\u0142y's command, the Sanation camp embraced the ideology of Roman Dmowski, Pi\u0142sudski's nemesis. Rydz-\u015amig\u0142y did not allow General W\u0142adys\u0142aw Sikorski, an enemy of the Sanation movement, to participate as a soldier in the country's defense against the Invasion of Poland in September 1939. During World War II in France and then in Britain, the Polish government-in-exile became dominated by anti-Sanation politicians. The perceived Sanation followers were in turn persecuted (in exile) under prime ministers Sikorski and Stanis\u0142aw Miko\u0142ajczyk.\n\"m.\"&lt;templatestyles src=\"Citation/styles.css\"/&gt;^ General Zygmunt Berling of the Soviet-allied First Polish Army attempted in mid-September a crossing of the Vistula and landing at Czerniak\u00f3w to aid the insurgents, but the operation was defeated by the Germans and the Poles suffered heavy losses.\n\"n.\"&lt;templatestyles src=\"Citation/styles.css\"/&gt;^ The decision to launch the Warsaw Uprising resulted in the destruction of the city, its population and its elites and has been a source of lasting controversy. According to the historians Czes\u0142aw Brzoza and Andrzej Leon Sowa, orders of further military offensives, issued at the end of August 1944 as a continuation of Operation Tempest, show a loss of the sense of responsibility for the country's fate on the part of the underground Polish leadership.\n\"o.\"&lt;templatestyles src=\"Citation/styles.css\"/&gt;^ One of the party leaders Mieczys\u0142aw Rakowski, who abandoned his mentor Gomu\u0142ka following the 1970 crisis, saw the demands of the demonstrating workers as \"exclusively socialist\" in character, because of the way they were phrased. Most people in communist Poland, including opposition activists, did not question the supremacy of socialism or the socialist idea; misconduct by party officials, such as not following the provisions of the constitution, was blamed. From the time of Gierek, this assumed standard of political correctness was increasingly challenged: pluralism, and then free market, became frequently used concepts.\n\"p.\"&lt;templatestyles src=\"Citation/styles.css\"/&gt;^ The Polish Sanation authorities were provoked by the independence-seeking Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists (OUN). OUN engaged in political assassinations, terror and sabotage, to which the Polish state responded with a repressive campaign in the 1930s, as J\u00f3zef Pi\u0142sudski and his successors imposed collective responsibility on the villagers in the affected areas. After the disturbances of 1933 and 1934, the Bereza Kartuska prison camp was established; it became notorious for its brutal regime. The government brought Polish settlers and administrators to parts of Volhynia with a centuries-old tradition of Ukrainian peasant rising against Polish land owners (and to Eastern Galicia). In the late 1930s, after Pi\u0142sudski's death, military persecution intensified and a policy of \"national assimilation\" was aggressively pursued. Military raids, public beatings, property confiscations and the closing and destruction of Orthodox churches aroused lasting enmity in Galicia and antagonized Ukrainian society in Volhynia at the worst possible moment, according to Timothy D. Snyder. However, he also notes that \"Ukrainian terrorism and Polish reprisals touched only part of the population, leaving vast regions unaffected\" and \"the OUN's nationalist prescription, a Ukrainian state for ethnic Ukrainians alone was far from popular\". Halik Kochanski wrote of the legacy of bitterness between the Ukrainians and Poles that soon exploded in the context of World War II. See also: History of the Ukrainian minority in Poland.\n\"q.\"&lt;templatestyles src=\"Citation/styles.css\"/&gt;^ In Poland, officials of central government (the provincial office of \"wojewoda\") can overrule elected territorial and municipal local governments. However, in such cases \"wojewoda\" decisions have sometimes been invalidated by courts.\n\"r.\"&lt;templatestyles src=\"Citation/styles.css\"/&gt;^ Foreign policy was one of the few governmental areas in which Pi\u0142sudski took an active interest. He saw Poland's role and opportunity as lying in Eastern Europe and advocated passive relations with the West. He felt that a German attack should not be feared, because even if this unlikely event were to take place, the Western powers would be bound to restrain Germany and come to Poland's rescue.\n\"s.\"&lt;templatestyles src=\"Citation/styles.css\"/&gt;^ According to the researcher Jan Sowa, the Commonwealth failed as a state because it was not able to conform to the emerging new European order established at the Peace of Westphalia of 1648. Poland's elective kings, restricted by the self-serving and short-sighted nobility, could not impose a strong and efficient central government with its characteristic post-Westphalian internal and external sovereignty. The inability of Polish kings to levy and collect taxes (and therefore sustain a standing army) and conduct independent foreign policy were among the chief obstacles to Poland competing effectively on the changed European scene, where absolutist power was a prerequisite for survival and became the foundation for the abolition of serfdom and gradual formation of parliamentarism.\n\"t.\"&lt;templatestyles src=\"Citation/styles.css\"/&gt;^ Besides the Home Army there were other major underground fighting formations: Bataliony Ch\u0142opskie, National Armed Forces (NSZ) and Gwardia Ludowa (later Armia Ludowa). From 1943, the leaders of the nationalistic NSZ collaborated with Nazi Germany in a case unique in occupied Poland. The NSZ conducted an anti-communist civil war. Before the arrival of the Soviets, the NSZ's Holy Cross Mountains Brigade left Poland under the protection of the German army. According to the historians Czes\u0142aw Brzoza and Andrzej Leon Sowa, participation figures given for the underground resistance are often inflated. In the spring of 1944, the time of the most extensive involvement of the underground organizations, there were most likely considerably fewer than 500,000 military and civilian personnel participating, over the entire spectrum, from the right wing to the communists.\n\"u.\"&lt;templatestyles src=\"Citation/styles.css\"/&gt;^ According to Jerzy Eisler, about 1.1 million people may have been imprisoned or detained in 1944\u20131956 and about 50,000 may have died because of the struggle and persecution, including about 7,000 soldiers of the right-wing underground killed in the 1940s. According to Adam Leszczy\u0144ski, up to 30,000 people were killed by the communist regime during the first several years after the war.\n\"v.\"&lt;templatestyles src=\"Citation/styles.css\"/&gt;^ According to Andrzej Stelmachowski, one of the key participants of the Polish systemic transformation, Minister Leszek Balcerowicz pursued extremely liberal economic policies, often extraordinarily painful for society. The December 1989 Sejm statute of credit relations reform introduced an \"incredible\" system of privileges for banks, which were allowed to unilaterally alter interest rates on already existing contracts. The exceedingly high rates they instantly introduced ruined many previously profitable enterprises and caused a complete breakdown of the apartment block construction industry, which had long-term deleterious effects on the state budget as well. Balcerowicz's policies also caused permanent damage to Polish agriculture, an area in which he lacked expertise, and to the often successful and useful Polish cooperative movement.\nAccording to Karol Modzelewski, a dissident and critic of the economic transformation, in 1989 Solidarity no longer existed, having been in reality eliminated during the martial law period. What the \"post-Solidarity elites\" did in 1989 amounted to a betrayal of the old Solidarity base, and the retribution was only a matter of time.\n\"w.\"&lt;templatestyles src=\"Citation/styles.css\"/&gt;^ Led by W\u0142adys\u0142aw Anders, the Polish II Corps fought in 1944\u20131945 in the Allied Italian Campaign, where the corps' main engagement was the Battle of Monte Cassino.\n\"x.\"&lt;templatestyles src=\"Citation/styles.css\"/&gt;^ The Piast Concept, of which the chief proponent was Jan Ludwik Pop\u0142awski (late 19th century), was based on the claim that the Piast homeland was inhabited by so-called \"native\" aboriginal Slavs and Slavonic Poles since time immemorial and only later was \"infiltrated\" by \"alien\" Celts, Germanic peoples, and others. After 1945, the so-called \"autochthonous\" or \"aboriginal\" school of Polish prehistory received official backing and a considerable degree of popular support in Poland. According to this view, the Lusatian Culture, which flourished between the Oder and the Vistula in the early Iron Age, was said to be Slavonic; all non-Slavonic tribes and peoples recorded in the area at various points in ancient times were dismissed as \"migrants\" and \"visitors\". In contrast, the critics of this theory, such as Marija Gimbutas, regarded it as an unproved hypotheses and for them the date and origin of the westward migration of the Slavs were largely uncharted; the Slavonic connections of the Lusatian Culture were entirely imaginary; and the presence of an ethnically mixed and constantly changing collection of peoples on the North European Plain was taken for granted.\n\"y.\"&lt;templatestyles src=\"Citation/styles.css\"/&gt;^ According to the count presented by Prime Minister and Internal Affairs Minister Felicjan S\u0142awoj Sk\u0142adkowski before the Sejm committee in January 1938, 818 people were killed in police suppression of labor protests (industrial and agricultural) during the 1932\u20131937 period.\n\"z.\"&lt;templatestyles src=\"Citation/styles.css\"/&gt;^ John II Casimir Vasa is known for his remarkable and accurate prediction of the Partitions of Poland, made over a century before the event's occurrence.\n\"a1.\"&lt;templatestyles src=\"Citation/styles.css\"/&gt;^ According to war historian Ben Macintyre, \"The Polish contribution to allied victory in the Second World War was extraordinary, perhaps even decisive, but for many years it was disgracefully played down, obscured by the politics of the Cold War.\"\n\"b1.\"&lt;templatestyles src=\"Citation/styles.css\"/&gt;^ Pi\u0142sudski left the Polish Socialist Party in 1914 and severed his connections with the socialist movement, but many activists from the Left and of other political orientations presumed his continuing involvement there.\n\"c1.\"&lt;templatestyles src=\"Citation/styles.css\"/&gt;^ Woodrow Wilson's Fourteen Points program was subsequently weakened by internal developments in the US, Britain, France, and Germany.

It is the fourth-most populous city in the United States, with a population of 2.3 million at the 2020 census. The Greater Houston metropolitan area, at 7.8 million residents, is the fifth-most populous metropolitan area in the nation and second-most populous in Texas. Located in Southeast Texas near Galveston Bay and the Gulf of Mexico, Houston is the seat of Harris County. Covering a total area of , it is the ninth largest city in the country and the largest whose municipal government is not consolidated with a county, parish, or borough. Although primarily located within Harris County, portions of the city extend into Fort Bend and Montgomery counties. Houston also functions as the southeastern anchor of the Texas Triangle megaregion.\nHouston was founded by land investors on August 30, 1836, at the confluence of Buffalo Bayou and White Oak Bayou (a point now known as Allen's Landing) and incorporated as a city on June 5, 1837. The city is named after former General Sam Houston, who was president of the Republic of Texas and had won Texas's independence from Mexico at the Battle of San Jacinto east of Allen's Landing. After briefly serving as the capital of the Texas Republic in the late 1830s, Houston grew steadily into a regional trading center for the remainder of the 19th century. The 20th century brought a convergence of economic factors that fueled rapid growth in Houston, including a burgeoning port and railroad industry, the decline of Galveston as Texas's primary port following a devastating 1900 hurricane, the subsequent construction of the Houston Ship Channel, and the Texas oil boom. In the mid-20th century, Houston's economy diversified, as it became home to the Texas Medical Center\u2014the world's largest concentration of healthcare and research institutions\u2014and NASA's Johnson Space Center, home to the Mission Control Center.\nSince the late 19th century, Houston's economy has had a broad industrial base in energy, manufacturing, aeronautics, and transportation. Leading in healthcare sectors and building oilfield equipment, Houston has the second-most \"Fortune\" 500 headquarters of any U.S. municipality within its city limits. The Port of Houston ranks first in the United States in international waterborne tonnage handled and second in total cargo tonnage handled.\nNicknamed the \"Bayou City\", \"Space City\", \"H-Town\", and \"the 713\", Houston has become a global city, with strengths in culture, medicine, and research. The city's population comprises various ethnic and religious backgrounds, as well as a large and growing international community. Houston is the most diverse metropolitan area in Texas and has been described as the most racially and ethnically diverse major city in the U.S. It is home to many cultural institutions and exhibits, such as the Houston Museum District and the Houston Theater District.\nHistory.\nPresent-day Houston sits on land that was once occupied by the Karankawa and the Atakapa indigenous peoples for at least 2,000 years before the first known settlers arrived. These tribes are almost nonexistent today; this was most likely caused by foreign disease, and competition with various settler groups in the 18th and 19th centuries. However, the land then remained largely uninhabited from the late 1700s until settlement in the 1830s.\nEarly settlement to the 20th century.\nThe Allen brothers\u2014Augustus Chapman and John Kirby\u2014explored town sites on Buffalo Bayou and Galveston Bay. According to historian David McComb, \"[T]he brothers, on August 26, 1836, bought from Elizabeth E. Parrott, wife of T.F.L. Parrott and widow of John Austin, the south half of the lower league [ tract] granted to her by her late husband. They paid $5,000 total, but only $1,000 of this in cash; notes made up the remainder.\"\nThe Allen brothers ran their first advertisement for Houston just four days later in the \"Telegraph and Texas Register\", naming the notional town in honor of Sam Houston, who would become President later that year. They successfully lobbied the Republic of Texas Congress to designate Houston as the temporary capital, agreeing to provide the new government with a state capitol building. About a dozen persons resided in the town at the beginning of 1837, but that number grew to about 1,500 by the time the Texas Congress convened in Houston for the first time that May. The Republic of Texas granted Houston incorporation on June 5, 1837, as James S. Holman became its first mayor. In the same year, Houston became the county seat of Harrisburg County (now Harris County).\nIn 1839, the Republic of Texas relocated its capital to Austin. The town suffered another setback that year when a yellow fever epidemic claimed about one life for every eight residents, yet it persisted as a commercial center, forming a symbiosis with its Gulf Coast port, Galveston. Landlocked farmers brought their produce to Houston, using Buffalo Bayou to gain access to Galveston and the Gulf of Mexico. Houston merchants profited from selling staples to farmers and shipping the farmers' produce to Galveston.\nThe great majority of enslaved people in Texas came with their owners from the older slave states. Sizable numbers, however, came through the domestic slave trade. New Orleans was the center of this trade in the Deep South, but slave dealers were in Houston. Thousands of enslaved black people lived near the city before the American Civil War. Many of them near the city worked on sugar and cotton plantations, while most of those in the city limits had domestic and artisan jobs.\nIn 1840, the community established a chamber of commerce, in part to promote shipping and navigation at the newly created port on Buffalo Bayou.\nBy 1860, Houston had emerged as a commercial and railroad hub for the export of cotton. Railroad spurs from the Texas inland converged in Houston, where they met rail lines to the ports of Galveston and Beaumont. During the American Civil War, Houston served as a headquarters for Confederate Major General John B. Magruder, who used the city as an organization point for the Battle of Galveston. After the Civil War, Houston businessmen initiated efforts to widen the city's extensive system of bayous so the city could accept more commerce between Downtown and the nearby port of Galveston. By 1890, Houston was the railroad center of Texas.\nIn 1900, after Galveston was struck by a devastating hurricane, efforts to make Houston into a viable deep-water port were accelerated. The following year, the discovery of oil at the Spindletop oil field near Beaumont prompted the development of the Texas petroleum industry. In 1902, President Theodore Roosevelt approved a $1 million improvement project for the Houston Ship Channel. By 1910, the city's population had reached 78,800, almost doubling from a decade before. African Americans formed a large part of the city's population, numbering 23,929 people, which was nearly one-third of Houston's residents.\nPresident Woodrow Wilson opened the deep-water Port of Houston in 1914, seven years after digging began. By 1930, Houston had become Texas's most populous city and Harris County the most populous county. In 1940, the U.S. Census Bureau reported Houston's population as 77.5% White and 22.4% black.\nWorld War II to the late 20th century.\nWhen World War II started, tonnage levels at the port decreased and shipping activities were suspended; however, the war did provide economic benefits for the city. Petrochemical refineries and manufacturing plants were constructed along the ship channel because of the demand for petroleum and synthetic rubber products by the defense industry during the war. Ellington Field, initially built during World War I, was revitalized as an advanced training center for bombardiers and navigators. The Brown Shipbuilding Company was founded in 1942 to build ships for the U.S. Navy during World War II. Due to the boom in defense jobs, thousands of new workers migrated to the city, both black, and white people competing for the higher-paying jobs. President Roosevelt had established a policy of nondiscrimination for defense contractors, and black people gained some opportunities, especially in shipbuilding, although not without resistance from white people and increasing social tensions that erupted into occasional violence. Economic gains of black people who entered defense industries continued in the postwar years.\nIn 1945, the M.D. Anderson Foundation formed the Texas Medical Center. After the war, Houston's economy reverted to being primarily port-driven. In 1948, the city annexed several unincorporated areas, more than doubling its size. Houston proper began to spread across the region. In 1950, the availability of air conditioning provided impetus for many companies to relocate to Houston, where wages were lower than those in the North; this resulted in an economic boom and produced a key shift in the city's economy toward the energy sector.\nThe increased production of the expanded shipbuilding industry during World War II spurred Houston's growth, as did the establishment in 1961 of NASA's \"Manned Spacecraft Center\" (renamed the Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center in 1973). This was the stimulus for the development of the city's aerospace industry. The Astrodome, nicknamed the \"Eighth Wonder of the World\", opened in 1965 as the world's first indoor domed sports stadium.\nDuring the late 1970s, Houston had a population boom as people from the Rust Belt states moved to Texas in large numbers. The new residents came for numerous employment opportunities in the petroleum industry, created as a result of the Arab oil embargo. With the increase in professional jobs, Houston has become a destination for many college-educated persons, most recently including African Americans in a reverse Great Migration from northern areas.\nIn 1997, Houstonians elected Lee P. Brown as the city's first African American mayor.\nEarly 21st century.\nHouston has continued to grow into the 21st century, with the population increasing 15.7% from 2000 to 2022.\nOil and gas have continued to fuel Houston's economic growth, with major oil companies including Phillips 66, ConocoPhillips, Occidental Petroleum, Halliburton, and ExxonMobil having their headquarters in the Houston area. In 2001, Enron Corporation, a Houston company with $100 billion in revenue, became engulfed in an accounting scandal which bankrupted the company in 2001. Healthcare had also emerged as a major industry in Houston. The Texas Medical Center is now the largest medical complex in the world and employs over 120,000 people.\nIn the first decade of the 21st century, three new sports stadiums opened downtown. In 2000, the Houston Astros opened their new baseball stadium, Daikin Park, in downtown adjacent to the old Union Station. The Houston Texans were formed in 2002 as an NFL expansion team, replacing the Houston Oilers, which had left the city in 1996. NRG Stadium opened the same year. In 2003, the Toyota Center opened as the home for the Houston Rockets. In 2005, the Houston Dynamo soccer team was formed. In 2017, the Houston Astros won their first World Series.\nFlooding and storms.\nFlooding has been a recurring problem in the Houston area. In June 2001, Tropical Storm Allison dumped up to of rain on parts of Houston, causing what was then the worst flooding in the city's history and billions of dollars in damage, and killed 20 people in Texas. In August 2005, Houston became a shelter to more than 150,000 people from New Orleans, who evacuated from Hurricane Katrina. One month later, about 2.5 million Houston-area residents evacuated when Hurricane Rita approached the Gulf Coast, leaving little damage to the Houston area. This was the largest urban evacuation in the history of the United States.\nIn May 2015, seven people died after 12 inches of rain fell in 10 hours during what is known as the Memorial Day Flood. Eight people died in April 2016 during a storm that dropped 17 inches of rain. The worst came in late August 2017, when Hurricane Harvey stalled over southeastern Texas, much like Tropical Storm Allison did sixteen years earlier, causing severe flooding in the Houston area, with some areas receiving over of rain. The rainfall exceeded 50 inches in several areas locally, breaking the national record for rainfall. The damage for the Houston area was estimated at up to $125 billion U.S. dollars, and was considered to be one of the worst natural disasters in the history of the United States, with the death toll exceeding 70 people. Houston's lack of zoning laws allowed unregulated building of residential homes and other structures in flood-prone areas. However, it also resulted in more concentrated development in already urban areas than in wetlands and suburbs. Mayor Sylvester Turner tweeted of Hurricane Harvey that \"zoning wouldn't have changed anything. We would have been a city with zoning that flooded.\"\nOn May 16, 2024, a strong derecho caused widespread damage across the city and surrounding metropolitan area.\nGeography.\nHouston is east of Austin, west of the Louisiana border, and south of Dallas. The city has a total area of ; this comprises over of land and covered by water. Most of Houston is on the gulf coastal plain, and its vegetation is classified as Western Gulf coastal grasslands while further north, it transitions into a subtropical jungle, the Big Thicket.\nMuch of the city was built on forested land, marshes, or swamps, and all are still visible in surrounding areas. Flat terrain and extensive greenfield development have combined to worsen flooding. Downtown stands about above sea level, and the highest point in far northwest Houston is about in elevation. The city once relied on groundwater for its needs, but land subsidence forced the city to turn to ground-level water sources such as Lake Houston, Lake Conroe, and Lake Livingston. The city owns surface water rights for of water a day in addition to a day of groundwater.\nHouston has four major bayous passing through the city that accept water from the extensive drainage system. Buffalo Bayou runs through Downtown and the Houston Ship Channel, and has three tributaries: White Oak Bayou, which runs through the Houston Heights community northwest of Downtown and then towards Downtown; Brays Bayou, which runs along the Texas Medical Center; and Sims Bayou, which runs through the south of Houston and Downtown Houston. The ship channel continues past Galveston and then into the Gulf of Mexico.\nGeology.\nHouston is a flat, marshy area where an extensive drainage system has been built. The adjoining prairie land drains into the city, which is prone to flooding. Underpinning Houston's land surface are unconsolidated clays, clay shales, and poorly cemented sands up to several miles deep. The region's geology developed from river deposits formed from the erosion of the Rocky Mountains. These sediments consist of a series of sands and clays deposited on decaying organic marine matter, that over time, transformed into oil and natural gas. Beneath the layers of sediment is a water-deposited layer of halite, a rock salt. The porous layers were compressed over time and forced upward. As it pushed upward, the salt dragged surrounding sediments into salt dome formations, often trapping oil and gas that seeped from the surrounding porous sands. The thick, rich, sometimes black, surface soil is suitable for rice farming in suburban outskirts where the city continues to grow.\nThe Houston area has over 150 active faults (estimated to be 300 active faults) with an aggregate length of up to , including the Long Point\u2013Eureka Heights fault system which runs through the center of the city. Land in some areas southeast of Houston is sinking because water has been pumped out of the ground for many years. It may be associated with slip along the faults; however, the slippage is slow and not considered an earthquake, where stationary faults must slip suddenly enough to create seismic waves. These faults also tend to move at a smooth rate in what is termed \"fault creep\", which further reduces the risk of an earthquake.\nCityscape.\nThe city of Houston was incorporated in 1837 and adopted a ward system of representation shortly afterward, in 1840. The six original wards of Houston are the progenitors of the 11 modern-day geographically oriented Houston City Council districts, though the city abandoned the ward system in 1905 in favor of a commission government, and, later, the existing mayor\u2013council government.\nLocations in Houston are generally classified as either being inside or outside the Interstate 610 loop. The \"Inner Loop\" encompasses a area which includes Downtown, pre\u2013World War II residential neighborhoods and streetcar suburbs, and newer high-density apartment and townhouse developments. Outside the loop, the city's typology is more suburban, though many major business districts\u2014such as Uptown, Westchase, and the Energy Corridor\u2014lie well outside the urban core. In addition to Interstate 610, two additional loop highways encircle the city: Beltway 8, with a radius of approximately from Downtown, and State Highway 99 (the Grand Parkway), with a radius of . Approximately 470,000 people lived within the Interstate 610 loop, while 1.65 million lived between Interstate 610 and Beltway 8 and 2.25 million lived within Harris County outside Beltway 8 in 2015.\nThough Houston is the largest city in the United States without formal zoning regulations, it has developed similarly to other Sun Belt cities because the city's land use regulations and legal covenants have played a similar role. Regulations include mandatory lot size for single-family houses and requirements that parking be available to tenants and customers. In 1998, Houston relaxed its mandatory lot sizes from 5,000 square feet to 3,500 square feet, which spurred housing construction in the city dramatically.\nSuch restrictions have had mixed results. Though some have blamed the city's low density, urban sprawl, and lack of pedestrian-friendliness on these policies, others have credited the city's land use patterns with providing significant affordable housing, sparing Houston the worst effects of the 2008 real estate crisis. The city issued 42,697 building permits in 2008 and was ranked first in the list of healthiest housing markets for 2009. In 2019, home sales reached a new record of $30 billion.\nIn referendums in 1948, 1962, and 1993, voters rejected efforts to establish separate residential and commercial land-use districts. Consequently, rather than a single central business district as the center of the city's employment, multiple districts and skylines have grown throughout the city in addition to Downtown, which include Uptown, the Texas Medical Center, Midtown, Greenway Plaza, Memorial City, the Energy Corridor, Westchase, and Greenspoint.\nArchitecture.\nHouston had the fifth-tallest skyline in North America (after New York City, Chicago, Toronto and Miami) and 36th-tallest in the world in 2015. A seven-mile (11\u00a0km) system of tunnels and skywalks links Downtown buildings containing shops and restaurants, enabling pedestrians to avoid summer heat and rain while walking between buildings. In the 1960s, Downtown Houston consisted of a collection of mid-rise office structures. Downtown was on the threshold of an energy industry\u2013led boom in 1970. A succession of skyscrapers was built throughout the 1970s\u2014many by real estate developer Gerald D. Hines\u2014culminating with Houston's tallest skyscraper, the 75-floor, -tall JPMorgan Chase Tower (formerly the Texas Commerce Tower), completed in 1982. It is the tallest structure in Texas, 19th tallest building in the United States, and was previously 85th-tallest skyscraper in the world, based on highest architectural feature. In 1983, the 71-floor, -tall Wells Fargo Plaza (formerly Allied Bank Plaza) was completed, becoming the second-tallest building in Houston and Texas. Based on highest architectural feature, it is the 21st-tallest in the United States. In 2007, Downtown had over of office space.\nCentered on Post Oak Boulevard and Westheimer Road, the Uptown District boomed during the 1970s and early 1980s when a collection of midrise office buildings, hotels, and retail developments appeared along I-610 West. Uptown became one of the most prominent instances of an edge city. The tallest building in Uptown is the 64-floor, -tall, Philip Johnson and John Burgee designed landmark Williams Tower (known as the Transco Tower until 1999). At the time of construction, it was believed to be the world's tallest skyscraper outside a central business district. The new 20-story Skanska building and BBVA Compass Plaza are the newest office buildings built in Uptown after 30 years. The Uptown District is also home to buildings designed by noted architects I. M. Pei, C\u00e9sar Pelli, and Philip Johnson. In the late 1990s and early 2000s, a mini-boom of midrise and highrise residential tower construction occurred, with several over 30 stories tall. Since 2000 over 30 skyscrapers have been developed in Houston; all told, 72 high-rises tower over the city, which adds up to about 8,300 units. In 2002, Uptown had more than of office space with of class A office space.\nClimate.\nHouston's climate is classified as humid subtropical (\"Cfa\" in the K\u00f6ppen climate classification system), typical of the Southern United States. While not in Tornado Alley, like much of Northern Texas, spring supercell thunderstorms sometimes bring tornadoes to the area. Prevailing winds are from the south and southeast during most of the year, which bring heat and tropical moisture from the nearby Gulf of Mexico and Galveston Bay.\nDuring the summer, temperatures reach or exceed an average of 106.5\u00a0days per year, including a majority of days from June to September. Additionally, an average of 4.6 days per year reach or exceed . Houston's characteristic subtropical humidity often results in a higher apparent temperature, and summer mornings average over 90% relative humidity. Air conditioning is ubiquitous in Houston; in 1981, annual spending on electricity for interior cooling exceeded $600 million (equivalent to $ billion in 2024), and by the late 1990s, approximately 90% of Houston homes featured air conditioning systems. The record highest temperature recorded in Houston is at Bush Intercontinental Airport, on four occasions: September 4, 2000; August 27, 2011; and August 24 and August 27, 2023.\nHouston has mild winters, with occasional cold spells. In January, the normal mean temperature at George Bush Intercontinental Airport is , with an average of 13 days per year with a low at or below , occurring on average between December 3 and February 20, allowing for a growing season of 286 days. Twenty-first century snow events in Houston include a storm on December 24, 2004, which saw of snow accumulate in parts of the metro area, and an event on December 7, 2017, which precipitated of snowfall. Snowfalls of at least on both December 10, 2008, and December 4, 2009, marked the first time measurable snowfall had occurred in two consecutive years in the city's recorded history. Overall, Houston has seen measurable snowfall 38 times between 1895 and 2018. On February 14 and 15, 1895, Houston received of snow, its largest snowfall from one storm on record. The coldest temperature officially recorded in Houston was on January 18, 1930. The last time Houston saw single digit temperatures was on December 23, 1989. The temperature dropped to at Bush Airport, marking the coldest temperature ever recorded there. 1.7 inches of snow fell at George Bush Intercontinental Airport the previous day.\nHouston generally receives ample rainfall, averaging about annually based on records between 1981 and 2010. Many parts of the city have a high risk of localized flooding due to flat topography, ubiquitous low-permeability clay-silt prairie soils, and inadequate infrastructure. During the mid-2010s, Greater Houston experienced consecutive major flood events in 2015 (\"Memorial Day\"), 2016 (\"Tax Day\"), and 2017 (Hurricane Harvey). Overall, there have been more casualties and property loss from floods in Houston than in any other locality in the United States. The majority of rainfall occurs between April and October (the wet season of Southeast Texas), when the moisture from the Gulf of Mexico evaporates extensively over the city.\nHouston has excessive ozone levels and is routinely ranked among the most ozone-polluted cities in the United States. Ground-level ozone, or smog, is Houston's predominant air pollution problem, with the American Lung Association rating the metropolitan area's ozone level twelfth on the \"Most Polluted Cities by Ozone\" in 2017, after major cities such as Los Angeles, Phoenix, New York City, and Denver. The industries along the ship channel are a major cause of the city's air pollution. The rankings are in terms of peak-based standards, focusing strictly on the worst days of the year; the average ozone levels in Houston are lower than what is seen in most other areas of the country, as dominant winds ensure clean, marine air from the Gulf. Excessive man-made emissions in the Houston area led to a persistent increase of atmospheric carbon dioxide over the city. Such an increase, often regarded as \"CO2 urban dome\", is driven by a combination of strong emissions and stagnant atmospheric conditions. Moreover, Houston is the only metropolitan area with less than ten million citizens where such a CO2 dome can be detected by satellites.\nBecause of Houston's wet season and proximity to the Gulf Coast, the city is prone to flooding from heavy rains; the most notable flooding events include Tropical Storm Allison in 2001 and Hurricane Harvey in 2017, along with most recent Tropical Storm Imelda in 2019 and Tropical Storm Beta in 2020. In response to Hurricane Harvey, Mayor Sylvester Turner of Houston initiated plans to require developers to build homes that will be less susceptible to flooding by raising them two feet above the 500-year floodplain. Hurricane Harvey damaged hundreds of thousands of homes and dumped trillions of gallons of water into the city. In places this led to feet of standing water that blocked streets and flooded homes. The Houston City Council passed this regulation in 2018 with a vote of 9\u20137. Had these floodplain development rules had been in place all along, it is estimated that 84% of homes in the 100-year and 500-year floodplains would have been spared damage.\nIn a recent case testing these regulations, near the Brickhouse Gulley, an old golf course that long served as a floodplain and reservoir for floodwaters, announced a change of heart toward intensifying development. A nationwide developer, Meritage Homes, bought the land and planned to develop the 500-year floodplain into 900 new residential homes. Their plan would bring in $360 million in revenue and boost city population and tax revenue. In order to meet the new floodplain regulations, the developers needed to elevate the lowest floors two feet above the 500-year floodplain, equivalent to five or six feet above the 100-year base flood elevation, and build a channel to direct stormwater runoff toward detention basins. Before Hurricane Harvey, the city had bought $10.7 million in houses in this area specifically to take them out of danger. In addition to developing new streets and single-family housing within a floodplain, a flowing flood-water stream termed a floodway runs through the development area, a most dangerous place to encounter during any future flooding event. Harris County, like other more rural counties, cannot direct developers where to build or not build via land use controls such as a zoning ordinance by Texas law, and instead can only impose general floodplain regulations for enforcement during subdivision approvals and building permit approvals.\nDemographics.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"US Census population/styles.css\"/&gt;\nThe 2020 U.S. census determined Houston had a population of 2,304,580. In 2017, the census-estimated population was 2,312,717, and in 2018 it was 2,325,502. An estimated 600,000 undocumented immigrants resided in the Houston area in 2017, comprising nearly 9% of the city's metropolitan population. At the 2010 United States census, Houston had a population of 2,100,263 residents, up from the city's 2,396 at the 1850 census.\nPer the 2019 American Community Survey, Houston's age distribution was 482,402 under 15; 144,196 aged 15 to 19; 594,477 aged 20 to 34; 591,561 aged 35 to 54; 402,804 aged 55 to 74; and 101,357 aged 75 and older. The median age of the city was 33.4. At the 2014\u20132018 census estimates, Houston's age distribution was 486,083 under 15; 147,710 aged 15 to 19; 603,586 aged 20 to 34; 726,877 aged 35 to 59; and 357,834 aged 60 and older. The median age was 33.1, up from 32.9 in 2017 and down from 33.5 in 2014; the city's youthfulness has been attributed to an influx of an African American New Great Migration, Hispanic and Latino American, and Asian immigrants into Texas. For every 100 females, there were 98.5 males.\nThere were 987,158 housing units in 2019 and 876,504 households. An estimated 42.3% of Houstonians owned housing units, with an average of 2.65 people per household. The median monthly owner costs with a mortgage were $1,646, and $536 without a mortgage. Houston's median gross rent from 2015 to 2019 was $1,041. The median household income in 2019 was $52,338 and 20.1% of Houstonians lived at or below the poverty line.\nRace and ethnicity.\nHouston is a majority-minority city. The Rice University Kinder Institute for Urban Research, a think tank, has described Greater Houston as \"one of the most ethnically and culturally diverse metropolitan areas in the country\". Houston's diversity, historically fueled by large waves of Hispanic and Latino Americans, and Asian immigrants, has been attributed to its relatively lower cost of living compared to most major cities, strong job market, and role as a hub for refugee resettlement.\nHouston has long been known as a popular destination for African Americans due to the city's well-established and influential African American community. Houston has become known as a black mecca akin to Atlanta because it is a major living destination for black professionals and entrepreneurs. The Houston area is home to the largest African American community in Texas and west of the Mississippi River. A 2012 Kinder Institute report found that, based on the evenness of population distribution between the four major racial groups in the United States (non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic black, Hispanic or Latino, and Asian), Greater Houston was the most ethnically diverse metropolitan area in the United States, ahead of New York City.\nIn 2019, according to the U.S. Census Bureau, non-Hispanic whites made up 23.3% of the population of Houston proper, Hispanics and Latino Americans 45.8%, blacks or African Americans 22.4%, and Asian Americans 6.5%. In 2018, non-Hispanic whites made up 20.7% of the population, Hispanics or Latino Americans 44.9%, blacks or African Americans 30.3%, and Asian Americans 8.2%. The largest Hispanic or Latino American ethnic groups in the city were Mexican Americans (31.6%), Puerto Ricans (0.8%), and Cuban Americans (0.8%) in 2018.\nAs documented, Houston has a higher proportion of minorities than non-Hispanic whites; in 2010, whites (including Hispanic whites) made up 57.6% of the city of Houston's population; 24.6% of the total population was non-Hispanic white. Blacks or African Americans made up 22.5% of Houston's population, American Indians made up 0.3% of the population, Asians made up 6.9% (1.7% Vietnamese, 1.3% Chinese, 1.3% Indian, 0.9% Pakistani, 0.4% Filipino, 0.3% Korean, 0.1% Japanese) and Pacific Islanders made up 0.1%. Individuals from some other race made up 15.69% of the city's population. Individuals from two or more races made up 2.1% of the city.\nAt the 2000 U.S. census, the racial makeup of the city was 49.3% White, 25.3% black or African American, 5.3% Asian, 0.7% American Indian, 0.1% Pacific Islander, 16.5% from some other race, and 3.1% from two or more races. In addition, Hispanics and Latinos of any race made up 37.4% of Houston's population in 2000, while non-Hispanic whites made up 30.8%. The proportion of non-Hispanic whites in Houston has decreased significantly since 1970, when it was 62.4%.\nSexual orientation and gender identity.\nHouston is home to one of the largest LGBT communities and pride parades in the United States. In 2018, the city scored a 70 out of 100 for LGBT friendliness. Jordan Blum of the \"Houston Chronicle\" stated levels of LGBT acceptance and discrimination varied in 2016 due to some of the region's traditionally conservative culture.\nBefore the 1970s, the city's gay bars were spread around Downtown Houston and what is now midtown Houston. LGBT Houstonians needed to have a place to socialize after the closing of the gay bars. They began going to Art Wren, a 24-hour restaurant in Montrose. LGBT community members were attracted to Montrose as a neighborhood after encountering it while patronizing Art Wren, and they began to gentrify the neighborhood and assist its native inhabitants with property maintenance. Within Montrose, new gay bars began to open. By 1985, the flavor and politics of the neighborhood were heavily influenced by the LGBT community, and in 1990, according to Hill, 19% of Montrose residents identified as LGBT. Paul Broussard was murdered in Montrose in 1991.\nBefore the legalization of same-sex marriage in the United States the marriage of Billie Ert and Antonio Molina, considered the first same-sex marriage in Texas history, took place on October 5, 1972. Houston elected the first openly lesbian mayor of a major city in 2009, and she served until 2016. During her tenure she authorized the Houston Equal Rights Ordinance which was intended to improve anti-discrimination coverage based on sexual orientation and gender identity in the city, specifically in areas such as housing and occupation where no anti-discrimination policy existed.\nReligion.\nHouston and its metropolitan area are the third-most religious and Christian area by percentage of population in the United States, and second in Texas behind the Dallas\u2013Fort Worth metroplex. Historically, Houston has been a center of Protestant Christianity, being part of the Bible Belt. Other Christian groups including Eastern and Oriental Orthodox Christianity, and non-Christian religions did not grow for much of the city's history because immigration was predominantly from Western Europe (which at the time was dominated by Western Christianity and favored by the quotas in federal immigration law). The Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965 removed the quotas, allowing for the growth of other religions.\nAccording to a 2014 study by the Pew Research Center, 73% of the population of the Houston area identified themselves as Christians, about 50% of whom claimed Protestant affiliations and about 19% claimed Roman Catholic affiliations. Nationwide, about 71% of respondents identified as Christians. About 20% of Houston-area residents claimed no religious affiliation, compared to about 23% nationwide. The same study says area residents who identify with other religions (including Judaism, Buddhism, Islam, and Hinduism) collectively made up about 7% of the area population.\nIn 2020, the Public Religion Research Institute estimated 40% were Protestant and 29% Catholic; overall, Christianity represented 72% of the population. In 2020, the Association of Religion Data Archives determined the Catholic Church numbered 1,299,901 for the metropolitan area; the second-largest single Christian denomination (Southern Baptists) numbered 800,688; following, non-denominational Protestant churches represented the third-largest Christian cohort at 666,548. Altogether, however, Baptists of the Southern Baptist Convention, the American Baptist Association, American Baptist Churches USA, Full Gospel Baptist Church Fellowship, National Baptist Convention USA and National Baptist Convention of America, and the National Missionary Baptist Convention numbered 926,554. Non-denominational Protestants, the Disciples of Christ, Christian Churches and Churches of Christ, and the Churches of Christ numbered 723,603 altogether according to this study.\nLakewood Church in Houston, led by Pastor Joel Osteen, is the largest church in the United States. A megachurch, it had 44,800 weekly attendees in 2010, up from 11,000 weekly in 2000. Since 2005, it has occupied the former Compaq Center sports stadium. In September 2010, \"Outreach\" magazine published a list of the 100 largest Christian churches in the United States, and on the list were the following Houston-area churches: Lakewood, Second Baptist Church Houston, Woodlands Church, Church Without Walls, and First Baptist Church. According to the list, Houston and Dallas were tied as the second-most popular city for megachurches.\nThe Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Galveston-Houston, the largest Catholic jurisdiction in Texas and fifth-largest in the United States, was established in 1847. The Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Galveston-Houston claimed approximately 1.7 million Catholics within its boundaries as of 2019. Its co-cathedral is located within the Houston city limits, while the diocesan see is in Galveston. Other prominent Catholic jurisdictions include the Eastern Catholic Ruthenian Greek Catholic Church and Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church as well as the Personal Ordinariate of the Chair of Saint Peter, whose cathedral is also in Houston.\nA variety of Eastern and Oriental Orthodox churches can be found in Houston. Immigrants from Eastern Europe, the Middle East, Ethiopia, India, and other areas have added to Houston's Eastern and Oriental Orthodox population. As of 2011 in the entire state, 32,000 people actively attended Orthodox churches. In 2013 Father John Whiteford, the pastor of St. Jonah Orthodox Church near Spring, stated there were about 6,000-9,000 Eastern Orthodox Christians in Houston. The Association of Religion Data Archives numbered 16,526 Eastern and Oriental Orthodox Houstonians in 2020. The most prominent Eastern and Oriental Orthodox jurisdictions are the Greek Orthodox Archdiocese of America, the Antiochian Orthodox Archdiocese of North America, the Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria, the Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church, and the Armenian Apostolic Church.\nHouston's Jewish community, estimated at 47,000 in 2001, has been present in the city since the 1800s. Houstonian Jews have origins from throughout the United States, Israel, Mexico, Russia, and other places. As of 2016, over 40 synagogues were in Greater Houston. The largest synagogues are Congregation Beth Yeshurun, a Conservative Jewish temple, and the Reform Jewish congregations Beth Israel and Emanu-El. According to a study in 2016 by Berman Jewish DataBank, 51,000 Jews lived in the area, an increase of 4,000 since 2001.\nHouston has a large and diverse Muslim community; it is the largest in Texas and the Southern United States, as of 2012. It is estimated that Muslims made up 1.2% of Houston's population. As of 2016, Muslims in the Houston area included South Asians, Middle Easterners, Africans, Turks, and Indonesians, as well as a growing population of Latino Muslim converts. In 2000 there were over 41 mosques and storefront religious centers, with the largest being the \"Al-Noor\" Mosque (Mosque of Light) of the Islamic Society of Greater Houston.\nThe Hindu, Sikh, and Buddhist communities form a growing sector of the religious demographic after Judaism and Islam. Large Hindu temples in the metropolitan area include the BAPS Shri Swaminarayan Mandir Houston, affiliated with the Swaminarayan Sampradaya denomination in Fort Bend County, near the suburb of Stafford as well as the South Indian-style Sri Meenakshi Temple in suburban Pearland, in Brazoria County, which is the oldest Hindu temple in Texas and third-oldest Hindu temple in the United States.\nOf the irreligious community 16% practiced nothing in particular, 3% were agnostic, and 2% were atheist in 2014.\nEconomy.\nHouston is recognized worldwide for its energy industry\u2014particularly for oil and natural gas\u2014as well as for biomedical research and aeronautics. Renewable energy sources\u2014wind and solar\u2014are also growing economic bases in the city, and the City Government purchases 90% of its annual 1 TWh power mostly from wind, and some from solar. Since the 2020s Houston has become a growing hub for technology startup firms and is the fastest growing sector of the city's economy. Major technology and software companies within Greater Houston include Crown Castle, KBR, FlightAware, Cybersoft, Houston Wire &amp; Cable, and HostGator. Aylo, Go Daddy, and ByteDance have offices in the Houston area. On April 4, 2022, Hewlett Packard Enterprise relocated its global headquarters from California to the Greater Houston area. The Houston Ship Channel is also a large part of Houston's economic base.\nBecause of these strengths, Houston is designated as a global city by the Globalization and World Cities Study Group and Network and global management consulting firm A.T. Kearney. The Houston area is the top U.S. market for exports, surpassing New York City in 2013, according to data released by the U.S. Department of Commerce's International Trade Administration. In 2012, the Houston\u2013The Woodlands\u2013Sugar Land area recorded $110.3 billion in merchandise exports. Petroleum products, chemicals, and oil and gas extraction equipment accounted for roughly two-thirds of the metropolitan area's exports last year. The top three destinations for exports were Mexico, Canada, and Brazil.\nThe Houston area is a leading center for building oilfield equipment. Much of its success as a petrochemical complex is due to its busy ship channel, the Port of Houston. In the United States, the port ranks first in international commerce and 16th among the largest ports in the world. Unlike most places, high oil and gasoline prices are beneficial for Houston's economy, as many of its residents are employed in the energy industry. Houston is the beginning or end point of numerous oil, gas, and products pipelines.\nThe Houston\u2013The Woodlands\u2013Sugar Land metro area's gross domestic product (GDP) in 2022 was $633\u00a0billion, making it the seventh-largest of any metropolitan area in the United States and larger than Iran's, Colombia's, or the United Arab Emirates' GDP. Only 27 countries other than the United States have a gross domestic product exceeding Houston's regional gross area product (GAP). In 2010, mining (which consists almost entirely of exploration and production of oil and gas in Houston) accounted for 26.3% of Houston's GAP up sharply in response to high energy prices and a decreased worldwide surplus of oil production capacity, followed by engineering services, health services, and manufacturing.\nThe University of Houston System's annual impact on the Houston area's economy equates to that of a major corporation: $1.1 billion in new funds attracted annually to the Houston area, $3.13 billion in total economic benefit, and 24,000 local jobs generated. This is in addition to the 12,500 new graduates the U.H. System produces every year who enter the workforce in Houston and throughout Texas. These degree-holders tend to stay in Houston. After five years, 80.5% of graduates are still living and working in the region.\nNinety-one foreign governments have established consular offices in Houston's metropolitan area, the third-highest in the nation. Forty foreign governments maintain trade and commercial offices here with 23 active foreign chambers of commerce and trade associations. Twenty-five foreign banks representing 13 nations operate in Houston, providing financial assistance to the international community.\nIn 2013, Houston was identified as the number one U.S. city for job creation by the U.S. Bureau of Statistics after it was not only the first major city to regain all the jobs lost in the preceding economic downturn, but also after the crash, more than two jobs were added for every one lost. Economist and vice president of research at the Greater Houston Partnership Patrick Jankowski attributed Houston's success to the ability of the region's real estate and energy industries to learn from historical mistakes. Furthermore, Jankowski stated that \"more than 100 foreign-owned companies relocated, expanded or started new businesses in Houston\" between 2008 and 2010, and this openness to external business boosted job creation during a period when domestic demand was problematically low.\nCulture.\nLocated in the American South, Houston is a diverse city with a large and growing international community. The Greater Houston metropolitan area is home to an estimated 1.1\u00a0million (21.4 percent) residents who were born outside the United States, with nearly two-thirds of the area's foreign-born population from south of the United States\u2013Mexico border since 2009. Additionally, more than one in five foreign-born residents are from Asia. The city is home to the nation's third-largest concentration of consular offices, representing 92 countries.\nMany annual events celebrate the diverse cultures of Houston. The largest and longest-running is the annual Houston Livestock Show and Rodeo, held over 20\u00a0days from early to late March, and is the largest annual livestock show and rodeo in the world. Another large celebration is the annual night-time Houston Gay Pride Parade, held at the end of June. Other notable annual events include the Houston Greek Festival, Art Car Parade, the Houston Auto Show, the Houston International Festival, and the Bayou City Art Festival, which is considered to be one of the top five art festivals in the United States.\nHouston is highly regarded for its diverse food and restaurant culture. Houston received the official nickname of \"Space City\" in 1967 because it is the location of NASA's Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center. Other nicknames often used by locals include \"Bayou City\", \"Clutch City\", \"Crush City\", \"Magnolia City\", \"H-Town\", and \"Culinary Capital of the South\".\nArts and theater.\nThe Houston Theater District, in Downtown, is home to nine major performing arts organizations and six performance halls. It is the second-largest concentration of theater seats in a Downtown area in the United States.\nHouston is one of the few United States cities with permanent, professional, resident companies in all major performing arts disciplines: opera (Houston Grand Opera), ballet (Houston Ballet), music (Houston Symphony Orchestra), and theater (The Alley Theatre, Theatre Under the Stars). Houston is also home to folk artists, art groups and various small progressive arts organizations.\nHouston attracts many touring Broadway acts, concerts, shows, and exhibitions for a variety of interests. Facilities in the Theater District include the Jones Hall\u2014home of the Houston Symphony Orchestra and Society for the Performing Arts\u2014and the Hobby Center for the Performing Arts.\nThe Museum District's cultural institutions and exhibits attract more than 7 million visitors a year. Notable facilities include The Museum of Fine Arts, the Houston Museum of Natural Science, the Contemporary Arts Museum Houston, the Station Museum of Contemporary Art, the Holocaust Museum Houston, the Children's Museum of Houston, and the Houston Zoo.\nLocated near the Museum District are The Menil Collection, Rothko Chapel, the Moody Center for the Arts and the Byzantine Fresco Chapel Museum.\nBayou Bend is a facility of the Museum of Fine Arts that houses one of America's most prominent collections of decorative art, paintings, and furniture. Bayou Bend is the former home of Houston philanthropist Ima Hogg.\nThe National Museum of Funeral History is in Houston near the George Bush Intercontinental Airport. The museum houses the original Popemobile used by Pope John Paul II in the 1980s along with numerous hearses, embalming displays, and information on famous funerals.\nVenues across Houston regularly host local and touring rock, blues, country, dubstep, and Tejano musical acts. While Houston has never been widely known for its music scene, Houston hip hop has become a significant, independent music scene that is influential nationwide. Houston is the birthplace of the chopped and screwed remixing-technique in hip-hop which was pioneered by DJ Screw from the city. Some other notable hip-hop artists from the area include Destiny's Child, Don Toliver, Slim Thug, Paul Wall, Mike Jones, Bun B, Geto Boys, Trae tha Truth, Kirko Bangz, Z-Ro, South Park Mexican, Travis Scott and Megan Thee Stallion.\nTourism and recreation.\nThe Theater District is a 17-block area in the center of Downtown Houston that is home to the Bayou Place entertainment complex, restaurants, movies, plazas, and parks. Bayou Place is a large multilevel building containing full-service restaurants, bars, live music, billiards, and Sundance Cinema. The Bayou Music Center stages live concerts, stage plays, and stand-up comedy.\nSpace Center Houston is the official visitors' center of NASA's Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center. The Space Center has many interactive exhibits including Moon rocks, a Space Shuttle simulator, and presentations about the history of NASA's crewed space flight program. Other tourist attractions include the Galleria (Texas's largest shopping mall, in the Uptown District), Old Market Square, the Downtown Aquarium, and Sam Houston Race Park.\nHouston's current Chinatown and the Mahatma Gandhi District are two major ethnic enclaves, reflecting Houston's multicultural makeup. Restaurants, bakeries, traditional-clothing boutiques, and specialty shops can be found in both areas.\nHouston is home to 337 parks, including Hermann Park, Terry Hershey Park, Lake Houston Park, Memorial Park, Tranquility Park, Sesquicentennial Park, Discovery Green, Buffalo Bayou Park and Sam Houston Park. Within Hermann Park are the Houston Zoo and the Houston Museum of Natural Science. Sam Houston Park contains restored and reconstructed homes which were originally built between 1823 and 1905.\nOf the 10 most populous U.S. cities, Houston has the largest total area of parks and green space, . The city also has over 200 additional green spaces\u2014totaling over that are managed by the city\u2014including the Houston Arboretum and Nature Center. The Lee and Joe Jamail Skatepark is a public skatepark owned and operated by the city of Houston, and is one of the largest skateparks in Texas consisting of a in-ground facility.\nThe Gerald D. Hines Waterwall Park in the Uptown District of the city serves as a popular tourist attraction and for weddings and various celebrations. A 2011 study by Walk Score ranked Houston the 23rd most walkable of the 50 largest cities in the United States.\nSports.\nHouston has sports teams for every major professional league except the National Hockey League. The Houston Astros are a Major League Baseball expansion team formed in 1962 (known as the \"Colt .45s\" until 1965) that have won the World Series in 2017 and 2022 and appeared in it in 2005, 2019, and 2021. It is the only MLB team to have won pennants in both modern leagues. The Houston Rockets are a National Basketball Association franchise based in the city since 1971. They have won two NBA Championships, one in 1994 and another in 1995, under star players Hakeem Olajuwon, Otis Thorpe, Clyde Drexler, Vernon Maxwell, and Kenny Smith. The Houston Texans are a National Football League expansion team formed in 2002. The Houston Dynamo is a Major League Soccer franchise that has been based in Houston since 2006, winning two MLS Cup titles in 2006 and 2007. The Houston Dash team plays in the National Women's Soccer League, who won their first title in 2020. The Houston SaberCats are a rugby team that plays in Major League Rugby. The Houston Gamblers are a UFL team that began play in 2024. They were previously in the XFL before it was announced they were moving to the UFL in 2024.\nDaikin Park (home of the Astros) and Toyota\u00a0Center (home of the Rockets), are in Downtown Houston. Houston has the NFL's first retractable-roof stadium with natural grass, NRG Stadium (home of the Texans). Daikin Park is also a retractable-roof stadium. Toyota Center also has the largest screen for an indoor arena in the United States built to coincide with the arena's hosting of the 2013 NBA All-Star Game. Shell Energy Stadium is a soccer-specific stadium for the Houston Dynamo, Houston Gamblers, the Texas Southern Tigers football team, and Houston Dash, in East Downtown. Aveva Stadium (home of the SaberCats) is in south Houston. In addition, NRG Astrodome was the first indoor stadium in the world, built in 1965. Other sports facilities include Hofheinz Pavilion (Houston Cougars basketball), Rice Stadium (Rice Owls football), and NRG Arena. TDECU Stadium is where the University of Houston's Cougars football team plays.\nHouston has hosted several major sports events: the 1968, 1986 and 2004 Major League Baseball All-Star Games; the 1989, 2006 and 2013 NBA All-Star Games; Super Bowl VIII, Super Bowl XXXVIII, and Super Bowl LI, as well as hosting the 1981, 1986, 1994 and 1995 NBA Finals, winning the latter two, and hosting the 2005 World Series, 2017 World Series, 2019 World Series, 2021 World Series and 2022 World Series. The city won its first baseball championship during the 2017 event and won again 5 years later. NRG Stadium hosted Super Bowl LI on February 5, 2017. Houston will host multiple matches during the 2026 FIFA World Cup.\nThe city has hosted several major professional and college sporting events, including the annual Houston Open golf tournament. Houston hosts the annual Houston College Classic baseball tournament every February, and the Texas Kickoff and Bowl in September and December, respectively.\nThe Grand Prix of Houston, an annual auto race on the IndyCar Series circuit was held on a 1.7-mile temporary street circuit in NRG Park. The October 2013 event was held using a tweaked version of the 2006\u20132007 course. The event had a five-year race contract through 2017 with IndyCar. In motorcycling, the Astrodome hosted an AMA Supercross Championship round from 1974 to 2003 and the NRG Stadium since 2003.\nHouston is also one of the first cities in the world to have a major esports team represent it, in the form of the Houston Outlaws. The Outlaws play in the Overwatch League and are one of two Texan teams, the other being the Dallas Fuel.\nGovernment.\nThe city of Houston has a strong mayoral form of municipal government. Houston is a home rule city and all municipal elections in Texas are nonpartisan. The city's elected officials are the mayor, city controller and 16 members of the Houston City Council. The current mayor of Houston is John Whitmire, a Democrat elected on a nonpartisan ballot. Houston's mayor serves as the city's chief administrator, executive officer, and official representative, and is responsible for the general management of the city and for seeing all laws and ordinances are enforced.\nThe original city council line-up of 14 members (nine district-based and five at-large positions) was based on a U.S. Justice Department mandate which took effect in 1979. At-large council members represent the entire city. Under the city charter, once the population in the city limits exceeded 2.1 million residents, two additional districts were to be added. The city of Houston's official 2010 census count was 600 shy of the required number; however, as the city was expected to grow beyond 2.1 million shortly thereafter, the two additional districts were added for, and the positions filled during, the August 2011 elections.\nThe city controller is elected independently of the mayor and council. The controller's duties are to certify available funds prior to committing such funds and processing disbursements. The city's fiscal year begins on July 1 and ends on June 30. Chris Brown is the city controller, serving his first term as of January\u00a02016[ [update]].\nAs the result of a 2015 referendum in Houston, a mayor is elected for a four-year term and can be elected to as many as two consecutive terms. The term limits were spearheaded in 1991 by conservative political activist Clymer Wright. During 1991\u20132015, the city controller and city council members were subjected to a two-year, three-term limitation\u2013the 2015 referendum amended term limits to two four-year terms. As of 2017[ [update]] some council members who served two terms and won a final term will have served eight years in office, whereas a freshman council member who won a position in 2013 can serve up to two additional terms under the previous term limit law\u2013a select few will have at least 10 years of incumbency once their term expires.\nHouston is considered to be a politically divided city whose balance of power often sways between Republicans and Democrats. According to the 2005 Houston Area Survey, 68\u00a0percent of non-Hispanic whites in Harris County are declared or favor Republicans while 89 percent of non-Hispanic blacks in the area are declared or favor Democrats. About 62\u00a0percent of Hispanics (of any nationality) in the area are declared or favor Democrats. The city has often been known to be the most politically diverse city in Texas, a state known for being generally conservative. As a result, the city is often a contested area in statewide elections. In 2009, Houston became the first U.S. city with a population over 1 million citizens to elect a gay mayor, by electing Annise Parker.\nTexas has banned sanctuary cities, but Houston Mayor Sylvester Turner said Houston will not assist ICE agents with immigration raids.\nCrime.\nHouston's crime rate is one of the top three in Texas and notably higher than the national average. Houston's murder rate jumped significantly since 2020. In 2021, nearly 500 people were murdered in the city which was almost double the murdered count in 2019. Rising gang activity is blamed for the increased crime rates in the city. Houston leaders are continually discussing and implementing strategies to combat crime in the city.\nHouston is a significant hub for trafficking of cocaine, cannabis, heroin, MDMA, and methamphetamine due to its size and proximity to major illegal drug exporting nations.\nIn the early 1970s, Houston, Pasadena and several coastal towns were the site of the Houston mass murders, which at the time were the deadliest case of serial killing in American history.\nIn 1853, the first execution in Houston took place in public at Founder's Cemetery in the Fourth Ward; initially, the cemetery was the execution site, but post-1868 executions took place in the jail facilities. In 2023, the city of Houston made enforcement of an anti-food sharing ordinance a priority. This has resulted in volunteers receiving over 80 tickets, and a federal lawsuit to be filed against the city of Houston.\nPolitics.\nHouston City Presidential Election Results\nEducation.\nNineteen school districts exist within the city of Houston. The Houston Independent School District (HISD) is the seventh-largest school district in the United States and the largest in Texas. HISD has over 100 campuses that serve as magnet or vanguard schools\u2014specializing in such disciplines as health professions, visual and performing arts, and the sciences. There are also many charter schools that are run separately from school districts. In addition, some public school districts also have their own charter schools.\nThe Houston area encompasses more than 300 private schools, many of which are accredited by Texas Private School Accreditation Commission recognized agencies. The Greater Houston metropolitan area's independent schools offer education from a variety of different religious as well as secular viewpoints. The Greater Houston area's Catholic schools are operated by the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Galveston-Houston.\nColleges and universities.\nHouston has four state universities. The University of Houston (UH) is a and the flagship institution of the University of Houston System. The third-largest university in Texas, the University of Houston has nearly 44,000 students on its campus in the Third Ward. The University of Houston\u2013Clear Lake and the University of Houston\u2013Downtown are stand-alone universities within the University of Houston System; they are not branch campuses of the University of Houston. Slightly west of the University of Houston is Texas Southern University (TSU), one of the largest historically black universities in the United States with approximately 10,000 students. Texas Southern University is the first state university in Houston, founded in 1927.\nSeveral private institutions of higher learning are within the city. Rice University, the most selective university in Texas and one of the most selective in the United States, is a private, secular institution with a high level of research activity. Founded in 1912, Rice's historic, heavily wooded campus, adjacent to Hermann Park and the Texas Medical Center, hosts approximately 4,000 undergraduate and 3,000 post-graduate students. To the north in Neartown, the University of St. Thomas, founded in 1947, is Houston's only Catholic university. St. Thomas provides a liberal arts curriculum for roughly 3,000 students at its historic 19-block campus along Montrose Boulevard. In southwest Houston, Houston Christian University (formerly Houston Baptist University), founded in 1960, offers bachelor's and graduate degrees at its Sharpstown campus. The school is affiliated with the Baptist General Convention of Texas and has a student population of approximately 3,000.\nThree community college districts have campuses in and around Houston. The Houston Community College System (HCC) serves most of Houston proper; its main campus and headquarters are in Midtown. Suburban northern and western parts of the metropolitan area are served by various campuses of the Lone Star College System, while the southeastern portion of Houston is served by San Jacinto College, and a northeastern portion is served by Lee College. The Houston Community College and Lone Star College systems are among the 10 largest institutions of higher learning in the United States.\nHouston also hosts a number of graduate schools in law and healthcare. The University of Houston Law Center and Thurgood Marshall School of Law at Texas Southern University are public, ABA-accredited law schools, while the South Texas College of Law, in Downtown, serves as a private, independent alternative. The Texas Medical Center is home to a high density of health professions schools, including two medical schools: McGovern Medical School, part of The University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston, and Baylor College of Medicine, a highly selective private institution. Prairie View A&amp;M University's nursing school is in the Texas Medical Center. Additionally, both Texas Southern University and the University of Houston have pharmacy schools, and the University of Houston hosts a medical school and a college of optometry.\nMedia.\nThe primary network-affiliated television stations are KPRC-TV channel 2 (NBC), KHOU channel 11 (CBS), KTRK-TV channel 13 (ABC), KTXH channel 20 (MyNetworkTV), KRIV channel 26 (Fox), KIAH channel 39 (The CW), KXLN-DT channel 45 (Univision), KTMD-TV channel 47 (Telemundo), KPXB-TV channel 49 (Ion Television), KYAZ channel 51 (MeTV) and KFTH-DT channel 67 (UniM\u00e1s). KTRK-TV, KTXH, KRIV, KIAH, KXLN-DT, KTMD-TV, KPXB-TV, KYAZ and KFTH-DT operate as owned-and-operated stations of their networks.\nThe Houston\u2013The Woodlands\u2013Sugar Land metropolitan area is served by one public television station and two public radio stations. KUHT channel 8 (\"Houston Public Media\") is a PBS member station and is the first public television station in the United States. Houston Public Radio is listener-funded and comprises one NPR member station, KUHF (\"News 88.7\"). The University of Houston System owns and holds broadcasting licenses to KUHT and KUHF. The stations broadcast from the Melcher Center for Public Broadcasting on the campus of the University of Houston. Houston additionally is served by the Pacifica Foundation public radio station KPFT. Commercial radio stations include KKBQ (92.9 FM), KILT (610 AM), KILT-FM (100.3 FM), KKHH (95.7 FM), KTRH (740 AM), KROI (92.1 FM), KODA (99.1 FM), KMJQ (102.1 FM), and KBXX (97.9 FM).\nHouston and its metropolitan area are served by the \"Houston Chronicle\", its only major daily newspaper with wide distribution. Hearst Communications, which owns and operates the \"Houston Chronicle\", bought the assets of the \"Houston Post\"\u2014its long-time rival and main competition\u2014when \"Houston Post\" ceased operations in 1995. The \"Houston Post\" was owned by the family of former Lieutenant Governor Bill Hobby of Houston. The only other major publication to serve the city is the \"Houston Press\"\u2014which was a free alternative weekly newspaper before the destruction caused by Hurricane Harvey resulted in the publication switching to an online-only format on November 2, 2017. Other notable publications include \"Houston Forward Times\", \"OutSmart\", and \"La Voz de Houston\". \"Houston Forward Times\" is one of the largest black-owned newspapers in the metropolitan area and owned by Forward Times Publishing Company. \"La Voz de Houston\" is the \"Houston Chronicle\"'s Spanish-language newspaper and the largest in the area.\nInfrastructure.\nHealthcare.\nHouston is the seat of the Texas Medical Center, which is the largest medical center in the world, and which describes itself as containing the world's largest concentration of research and healthcare institutions. All 49 member institutions of the Texas Medical Center are non-profit organizations. They provide patient and preventive care, research, education, and local, national, and international community well-being. Employing more than 73,600 people, institutions at the medical center include 13 hospitals and two specialty institutions, two medical schools, four nursing schools, and schools of dentistry, public health, pharmacy, and virtually all health-related careers. It is where one of the first\u2014and still the largest\u2014air emergency service, Life Flight, was created, and an inter-institutional transplant program was developed. Around 2007, more heart surgeries were performed at the Texas Medical Center than anywhere else in the world.\nSome of the academic and research health institutions at the center include MD Anderson Cancer Center, Baylor College of Medicine, UT Health Science Center, Memorial Hermann Hospital, Houston Methodist Hospital, Texas Children's Hospital, and University of Houston College of Pharmacy.\nThe Menninger Clinic, a psychiatric treatment center, is affiliated with Baylor College of Medicine and the Houston Methodist Hospital System. With hospital locations nationwide and headquarters in Houston, the Triumph Healthcare hospital system was the third largest long term acute care provider nationally in 2005.\nHarris Health System (formerly Harris County Hospital District), the hospital district for Harris County, operates public hospitals (Ben Taub General Hospital and Lyndon B. Johnson Hospital) and public clinics. The City of Houston Health Department also operates four clinics. As of 2011[ [update]] the dental centers of Harris Health System take patients of ages 16 and up with patients under that age referred to the City of Houston's dental clinics. Montgomery County Hospital District (MCHD) serves as the hospital district for Houstonians living in Montgomery County. Fort Bend County, in which a portion of Houston resides, does not have a hospital district. OakBend Medical Center serves as the county's charity hospital which the county contracts with.\nTransportation.\nHouston is considered an automobile-dependent city, with an estimated 77.2% of commuters driving alone to work in 2016, up from 71.7% in 1990 and 75.6% in 2009. In 2016, another 11.4% of Houstonians carpooled to work, while 3.6% used public transit, 2.1% walked, and 0.5% bicycled. A commuting study estimated the median length of commute in the region was in 2012. According to the 2013 American Community Survey, the average work commute in Houston (city) takes 26.3 minutes. A 1999 Murdoch University study found Houston had both the lengthiest commute and lowest urban density of 13 large American cities surveyed. Harris County is one of the largest consumers of gasoline in the United States, ranking second (behind Los Angeles County) in 2013.\nDespite the region's high rate of automobile usage, attitudes towards transportation among Houstonians indicate a growing preference for walkability. A 2017 study by the Rice University Kinder Institute for Urban Research found 56% of Harris County residents have a preference for dense housing in a mixed-use, walkable setting as opposed to single-family housing in a low-density area. A plurality of survey respondents also indicated traffic congestion was the most significant problem facing the metropolitan area. In addition, many households in the city of Houston have no car. In 2015, 8.3 percent of Houston households lacked a car, which was virtually unchanged in 2016 (8.1 percent). The national average was 8.7 percent in 2016. Houston averaged 1.59 cars per household in 2016, compared to a national average of 1.8.\nRoadways.\nThe eight-county Greater Houston metropolitan area contains over of roadway, of which 10%, or approximately , is limited-access highway. The Houston region's extensive freeway system handles over 40% of the regional daily vehicle miles traveled (VMT). Arterial roads handle an additional 40% of daily VMT, while toll roads, of which Greater Houston has , handle nearly 10%.\nGreater Houston possesses a hub-and-spoke limited-access highway system, in which a number of freeways radiate outward from Downtown, with ring roads providing connections between these radial highways at intermediate distances from the city center. The city is crossed by three Interstate highways, I-10, I-45, and I-69 (commonly known as US 59), as well as a number of other United States routes and state highways. Major freeways in Greater Houston are often referred to by either the cardinal direction or geographic location they travel towards. Highways that follow the cardinal convention include US 290 (\"Northwest Freeway\"), I-45 north of Downtown (\"North Freeway\"), I-10 east of Downtown \"(East Freeway\"), SH 288 (\"South\" \"Freeway\"), and I-69 south of Downtown (\"Southwest Freeway\"). Highways that follow the location convention include Interstate 10 west of Downtown (\"Katy Freeway\"), Interstate 69 north of Downtown (\"Eastex Freeway\"), I-45 south of Downtown (\"Gulf Freeway\"), and SH 225 (\"Pasadena Freeway\").\nThree loop freeways provide north\u2013south and east\u2013west connectivity between Greater Houston's radial highways. The innermost loop is I-610, commonly known as the \"Inner Loop\", which encircles Downtown, the Texas Medical Center, Greenway Plaza, the cities of West University Place and Southside Place, and many core neighborhoods. The Beltway\u00a08, often referred to as \"the Beltway\", forms the middle loop at a radius of roughly . A third, loop with a radius of approximately , SH\u00a099 (the \"Grand Parkway\"), is currently under construction, with eight of eleven segments completed as of 2018[ [update]]. Completed segments D through I-2 provide a continuous limited-access tollway connection between Sugar Land, Richmond, Katy, Cypress, Spring, Porter, New Caney, Cleveland, Dayton, Mont Belvieu, and Baytown .\nA system of toll roads, operated by the Harris County Toll Road Authority and Fort Bend County Toll Road Authority, provides additional options for regional commuters. The Sam Houston Tollway, which encompasses the mainlanes of Beltway 8 (as opposed to the frontage roads, which are untolled), is the longest tollway in the system, covering the entirety of the Beltway with the exception of a free section between I-45 and I-69 near George Bush Intercontinental Airport. The region is serviced by four spoke tollways: a set of managed lanes on the Katy Freeway; the Hardy Toll Road, which parallels I-45 north of Downtown up to Spring; the Westpark Tollway, which services Houston's western suburbs out to Fulshear; and Fort Bend Parkway, which connects to Sienna Plantation. Westpark Tollway and Fort Bend Parkway are operated conjunctly with the Fort Bend County Toll Road Authority.\nGreater Houston's freeway system is monitored by Houston TranStar, a partnership of four government agencies which is responsible for providing transportation and emergency management services to the region.\nGreater Houston's arterial road network is established at the municipal level, with the City of Houston exercising planning control over both its incorporated area and extraterritorial jurisdiction. Therefore, Houston exercises transportation planning authority over a area over five counties, many times larger than its corporate area. The \"Major Thoroughfare and Freeway Plan\", updated annually, establishes the city's street hierarchy, identifies roadways in need of widening, and proposes new roadways in unserved areas. Arterial roads are organized into four categories, in decreasing order of intensity: \"major thoroughfares\", \"transit corridor streets\", \"collector streets\", and \"local streets\". Roadway classification affects anticipated traffic volumes, roadway design, and right of way breadth. Ultimately, the system is designed to ferry traffic from neighborhood streets to major thoroughfares, which connect into the limited-access highway system. Notable arterial roads in the region include Westheimer Road, Memorial Drive, SH 6, FM 1960, Bellaire Boulevard, and Telephone Road.\nTransit.\nThe Metropolitan Transit Authority of Harris County (METRO) provides public transportation in the form of buses, light rail, high-occupancy vehicle (HOV) lanes, and paratransit to fifteen municipalities throughout the Greater Houston area and parts of unincorporated Harris County. METRO's service area covers containing a population of 3.6 million.\nMETRO's local bus network services approximately 275,000 riders daily with a fleet of over 1,200 buses. The agency's 75 local routes contain nearly 8,900 stops and saw nearly 67 million boardings during the 2016 fiscal year. A park and ride system provides commuter bus service from 34 transit centers scattered throughout the region's suburban areas; these express buses operate independently of the local bus network and utilize the region's extensive system of HOV lanes. Downtown and the Texas Medical Center have the highest rates of transit use in the region, largely due to the park and ride system, with nearly 60% of commuters in each district utilizing public transit to get to work.\nMETRO began light rail service in 2004 with the opening of the north-south Red Line connecting Downtown, Midtown, the Museum District, the Texas Medical Center, and NRG Park. In the early 2010s, two additional lines\u2014the Green Line, servicing the East End, and the Purple Line, servicing the Third Ward\u2014opened, and the Red Line was extended northward to Northline, bringing the total length of the system to . Two light rail lines outlined in a five-line system approved by voters in a 2003 referendum have yet to be constructed. The Uptown Line, which runs along Post Oak Boulevard in Uptown, was under construction as a bus rapid transit line\u2014the city's first\u2014while the University Line has been postponed indefinitely. The light rail system saw approximately 16.8 million boardings in fiscal year 2016.\nAmtrak's thrice-weekly Los Angeles\u2013New Orleans serves Houston at a station northwest of Downtown. There were 14,891 boardings and alightings in FY2008, 20,327 in FY2012, and 20,205 in FY2018. A daily Amtrak Thruway connects Houston with Amtrak's Chicago\u2013San Antonio at Longview.\nCycling.\nHouston has the largest number of bike commuters in Texas with over 160 miles of dedicated bikeways. In 2015, Downtown Houston added a cycle track on Lamar Street, running from Sam Houston Park to Discovery Green. Houston City Council approved the Houston Bike Plan in March 2017, at that time entering the plan into the Houston Code of Ordinances. In August 2017, Houston City Council approved spending for construction of 13 additional miles of bike trails.\nHouston had a bicycle sharing system until June 2024. Houston Bcycle (also known as B-Cycle), a local non-profit, ran the subscription program, supplying bicycles and docking stations, while partnering with other companies to maintain the system. The network expanded to 29 stations and 225 bicycles in 2014, registering over 43,000 checkouts of equipment during the first half of the same year. In 2017, Bcycle logged over 142,000 check outs while expanding to 56 docking stations.\nAirports.\nThe Houston Airport System, a branch of the municipal government, oversees the operation of three major public airports in the city. Two of these airports, George Bush Intercontinental Airport and William P. Hobby Airport, offer commercial aviation service to a variety of domestic and international destinations and served 55 million passengers in 2016. The third, Ellington Airport, is home to the Ellington Field Joint Reserve Base. The Federal Aviation Administration and the state of Texas selected the Houston Airport System as \"Airport of the Year\" in 2005, largely due to the implementation of a $3.1 billion airport improvement program for both major airports in Houston.\nGeorge Bush Intercontinental Airport (IAH), north of Downtown Houston between Interstates 45 and 69, is the eighth busiest commercial airport in the United States (by total passengers and aircraft movements) and forty-third busiest globally. The five-terminal, five-runway, airport served 40 million passengers in 2016, including 10 million international travelers. In 2006, the United States Department of Transportation named IAH the fastest-growing of the top ten airports in the United States. The Houston Air Route Traffic Control Center is at Bush Intercontinental.\nHouston was the headquarters of Continental Airlines until its 2010 merger with United Airlines with headquarters in Chicago; regulatory approval for the merger was granted in October of that year. Bush Intercontinental is currently United Airlines' second largest hub, behind O'Hare International Airport. United Airlines' share of the Houston Airport System's commercial aviation market was nearly 60% in 2017 with 16 million enplaned passengers. In early 2007, Bush Intercontinental Airport was named a model \"port of entry\" for international travelers by U.S. Customs and Border Protection.\nWilliam P. Hobby Airport (HOU), known as Houston International Airport until 1967, operates primarily short- to medium-haul domestic and international flights to 60 destinations. The four-runway, facility is approximately southeast of Downtown Houston. In 2015, Southwest Airlines launched service from a new international terminal at Hobby to several destinations in Mexico, Central America, and the Caribbean. These were the first international flights flown from Hobby since the opening of Bush Intercontinental in 1969. Houston's aviation history is showcased in the 1940 Air Terminal Museum in the old terminal building on the west side of the airport. In 2009, Hobby Airport was recognized with two awards for being one of the top five performing airports globally and for customer service by Airports Council International. In 2022 Hobby Airport was certified as the first 5-Star Airport in North America by Skytrax. It became the first Airport in North America to do so and just the 16th airport worldwide to receive the accomplishment.\nHouston's third municipal airport is Ellington Airport, used by the military, government (including NASA) and general aviation sectors.\nInternational relations.\nHouston's sister cities are:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "13777", "revid": "48736052", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=13777", "title": "Hard disk drive", "text": "Electro-mechanical data storage device\nA hard disk drive (HDD), hard disk, hard drive, or fixed disk is an electro-mechanical data storage device that stores and retrieves digital data using magnetic storage with one or more rigid rapidly rotating platters coated with magnetic material. The platters are paired with magnetic heads, usually arranged on a moving actuator arm, which read and write data to the platter surfaces. Data is accessed in a random-access manner, meaning that individual blocks of data can be stored and retrieved in any order. HDDs are a type of non-volatile storage, retaining stored data when powered off. Modern HDDs are typically in the form of a small rectangular box, possibly in a disk enclosure for portability.\nHard disk drives were introduced by IBM in 1956, and were the dominant secondary storage device for general-purpose computers beginning in the early 1960s. HDDs maintained this position into the modern era of servers and personal computers, though personal computing devices produced in large volume, like mobile phones and tablets, rely on flash memory storage devices. More than 224 companies have produced HDDs historically, though after extensive industry consolidation, most units are manufactured by Seagate, Toshiba, and Western Digital. HDDs dominate the volume of storage produced (exabytes per year) for servers. Though production is growing slowly (by exabytes shipped), sales revenues and unit shipments are declining, because solid-state drives (SSDs) have higher data-transfer rates, higher areal storage density, somewhat better reliability, and much lower latency and access times.\nThe revenues for SSDs, most of which use NAND flash memory, slightly exceeded those for HDDs in 2018. Flash storage products had more than twice the revenue of hard disk drives as of 2017[ [update]]. Though SSDs have four to nine times higher cost per bit, they are replacing HDDs in applications where speed, power consumption, small size, high capacity and durability are important. As of 2017[ [update]], the cost per bit of SSDs was falling, and the price premium over HDDs had narrowed.\nThe primary characteristics of an HDD are its capacity and performance. Capacity is specified in unit prefixes corresponding to powers of 1000: a 1-terabyte (TB) drive has a capacity of 1,000 gigabytes, where 1 gigabyte = 1 000 megabytes = 1 000 000 kilobytes (1 million) = 1 000 000 000 bytes (1 billion). Typically, some of an HDD's capacity is unavailable to the user because it is used by the file system and the computer operating system, and possibly inbuilt redundancy for error correction and recovery. There can be confusion regarding storage capacity since capacities are stated in decimal gigabytes (powers of 1000) by HDD manufacturers, whereas the most commonly used operating systems report capacities in powers of 1024, which results in a smaller number than advertised. Performance is specified as the time required to move the heads to a track or cylinder (average access time), the time it takes for the desired sector to move under the head (average latency, which is a function of the physical rotational speed in revolutions per minute), and finally, the speed at which the data is transmitted (data rate).\nThe two most common form factors for modern HDDs are 3.5-inch, for desktop computers, and 2.5-inch, primarily for laptops and servers. HDDs are connected to systems by standard interface cables such as SATA (Serial ATA), USB, SAS (Serial Attached SCSI), or PATA (Parallel ATA) cables.\nHistory.\n1950s\u20131960s.\nThe first production IBM hard disk drive, the 350 disk storage, shipped in 1957 as a component of the IBM 305 RAMAC system. It was approximately the size of two large refrigerators and stored five million six-bit characters (3.75 megabytes) on a stack of 52 disks (100 surfaces used). The 350 had a single arm with two read/write heads, one facing up and the other down, that moved both horizontally between a pair of adjacent platters and vertically from one pair of platters to a second set. Variants of the IBM 350 were the IBM 355, IBM 7300 and IBM 1405.\nIn 1961, IBM announced, and in 1962 shipped, the IBM\u00a01301 disk storage unit, which superseded the IBM\u00a0350 and similar drives. The 1301 consisted of one (for Model 1) or two (for model 2) modules, each containing 25 platters, each platter about thick and in diameter. While the earlier IBM disk drives used only two read/write heads per arm, the 1301 used an array of 48 heads (comb), each array moving horizontally as a single unit, one head per surface used. Cylinder-mode read/write operations were supported, and the heads flew about 250 micro-inches (about 6\u00a0\u03bcm) above the platter surface. Motion of the head array depended upon a binary adder system of hydraulic actuators which assured repeatable positioning. The 1301 cabinet was about the size of three large refrigerators placed side by side, storing the equivalent of about 21 million eight-bit bytes per module. Access time was about a quarter of a second.\nAlso in 1962, IBM introduced the model 1311 disk drive, which was about the size of a washing machine and stored two million characters on a removable disk pack. Users could buy additional packs and interchange them as needed, much like reels of magnetic tape. Later models of removable pack drives, from IBM and others, became the norm in most computer installations and reached capacities of 300 megabytes by the early 1980s. Non-removable HDDs were called \"fixed disk\" drives.\nIn 1963, IBM introduced the 1302, with twice the track capacity and twice as many tracks per cylinder as the 1301. The 1302 had one (for Model 1) or two (for Model 2) modules, each containing a separate comb for the first 250 tracks and the last 250 tracks.\nSome high-performance HDDs were manufactured with one head per track, e.g., the Burroughs B-475 in 1964 and the IBM\u00a02305 in 1970, so that no time was lost physically moving the heads to a track and the only latency was the time for the desired block of data to rotate into position under the head. Known as fixed-head or head-per-track disk drives, they were very expensive and are no longer in production.\n1970s.\nIn 1973, IBM introduced a new type of HDD code-named \"Winchester\". Its primary distinguishing feature was that the disk heads were not withdrawn completely from the stack of disk platters when the drive was powered down. Instead, the heads were allowed to \"land\" on a special area of the disk surface upon spin-down, \"taking off\" again when the disk was later powered on. This greatly reduced the cost of the head actuator mechanism but precluded removing just the disks from the drive as was done with the disk packs of the day. Instead, the first models of \"Winchester technology\" drives featured a removable disk module, which included both the disk pack and the head assembly, leaving the actuator motor in the drive upon removal. Later \"Winchester\" drives abandoned the removable media concept and returned to non-removable platters.\nIn 1974, IBM introduced the swinging arm actuator, made feasible because the Winchester recording heads function well when skewed to the recorded tracks. The simple design of the IBM GV (Gulliver) drive, invented at IBM's UK Hursley Labs, became IBM's most licensed electro-mechanical invention of all time, the actuator and filtration system being adopted in the 1980s eventually for all HDDs, and still universal nearly 40 years and 10 billion arms later.\nLike the first removable pack drive, the first \"Winchester\" drives used platters in diameter. In 1978, IBM introduced a swing arm drive, the IBM 0680 (Piccolo), with eight-inch platters, exploring the possibility that smaller platters might offer advantages. Other eight-inch drives followed, then drives, sized to replace the contemporary floppy disk drives. The latter were primarily intended for the then fledgling personal computer (PC) market.\n1980s\u20131990s.\nOver time, as recording densities were greatly increased, further reductions in disk diameter to 3.5\" and 2.5\" were found to be optimum. Powerful rare-earth magnet materials became affordable during this period and were complementary to the swing arm actuator design to make possible the compact form factors of modern HDDs.\nAs the 1980s began, HDDs were a rare and very expensive additional feature in PCs, but by the late 1980s, their cost had been reduced to the point where they were standard on all but the cheapest computers.\nMost HDDs in the early 1980s were sold to PC end users as an external, add-on subsystem. The subsystem was not sold under the drive manufacturer's name but under the subsystem manufacturer's name such as Corvus Systems and Tallgrass Technologies, or under the PC system manufacturer's name such as the Apple ProFile. The IBM PC/XT in 1983 included an internal 10\u00a0MB HDD, and soon thereafter, internal HDDs proliferated on personal computers.\nExternal HDDs remained popular for much longer on the Apple Macintosh. Many Macintosh computers made between 1986 and 1998 featured a SCSI port on the back, making external expansion simple. Older compact Macintosh computers did not have user-accessible hard drive bays (indeed, the Macintosh 128K, Macintosh 512K, and Macintosh Plus did not feature a hard drive bay at all), so on those models, external SCSI disks were the only reasonable option for expanding upon any internal storage.\n21st century.\nHDD improvements have been driven by increasing areal density, listed in the table above. Applications expanded through the 2000s, from the mainframe computers of the late 1950s to most mass storage applications including computers and consumer applications such as storage of entertainment content.\nIn the 2000s and 2010s, NAND began supplanting HDDs in applications requiring portability or high performance. NAND performance is improving faster than HDDs, and applications for HDDs are eroding. In 2018, the largest hard drive had a capacity of 15\u00a0TB, while the largest capacity SSD had a capacity of 100\u00a0TB. In 2018, HDDs were forecast to reach 100\u00a0TB capacities around 2025 (but so far in 2025 the reality is far off), but as of 2019[ [update]], the expected pace of improvement was pared back to 50\u00a0TB by 2026. Smaller form factors, 1.8-inches and below, were discontinued around 2010. The cost of solid-state storage (NAND), represented by Moore's law, is improving faster than HDDs. NAND has a higher price elasticity of demand than HDDs, and this drives market growth. During the late 2000s and 2010s, the product life cycle of HDDs entered a mature phase, and slowing sales may indicate the onset of the declining phase.\nThe 2011\u00a0Thailand floods damaged the manufacturing plants and impacted hard disk drive cost adversely between 2011 and 2013.\nIn 2019, Western Digital closed its last Malaysian HDD factory due to decreasing demand, to focus on SSD production. All three remaining HDD manufacturers have had decreasing demand for their HDDs since 2014.\nTechnology.\nMagnetic recording.\nA modern HDD records data by magnetizing a thin film of ferromagnetic material on both sides of a disk. Sequential changes in the direction of magnetization represent binary data bits. The data is read from the disk by detecting the transitions in magnetization. User data is encoded using an encoding scheme, such as run-length limited encoding, which determines how the data is represented by the magnetic transitions.\nA typical HDD design consists of a \"&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Visible anchor/styles.css\" /&gt;spindle\" that holds flat circular disks, called platters, which hold the recorded data. The platters are made from a non-magnetic material, usually aluminum alloy, glass, or ceramic. They are coated with a shallow layer of magnetic material typically 10\u201320 nm in depth, with an outer layer of carbon for protection. For reference, a standard piece of copy paper is thick.\nThe platters in contemporary HDDs are spun at speeds varying from in energy-efficient portable devices, to 15,000\u00a0rpm for high-performance servers. The first HDDs spun at 1,200\u00a0rpm and, for many years, 3,600\u00a0rpm was the norm. As of November 2019[ [update]], the platters in most consumer-grade HDDs spin at 5,400 or 7,200\u00a0rpm.\nInformation is written to and read from a platter as it rotates past devices called read-and-write heads that are positioned to operate very close to the magnetic surface, with their flying height often in the range of tens of nanometers. The read-and-write head is used to detect and modify the magnetization of the material passing immediately under it.\nIn modern drives, there is one head for each magnetic platter surface on the spindle, mounted on a common arm. An actuator arm (or access arm) moves the heads on an arc (roughly radially) across the platters as they spin, allowing each head to access almost the entire surface of the platter as it spins. The arm is moved using a voice coil actuator or, in some older designs, a stepper motor. Early hard disk drives wrote data at some constant bits per second, resulting in all tracks having the same amount of data per track, but modern drives (since the 1990s) use zone bit recording, increasing the write speed from inner to outer zone and thereby storing more data per track in the outer zones.\nIn modern drives, the small size of the magnetic regions creates the danger that their magnetic state might be lost because of thermal effects\u2060\u2009\u2060\u2014\u2009thermally induced magnetic instability which is commonly known as the \"superparamagnetic limit\". To counter this, the platters are coated with two parallel magnetic layers, separated by a three-atom layer of the non-magnetic element ruthenium, and the two layers are magnetized in opposite orientation, thus reinforcing each other. Another technology used to overcome thermal effects to allow greater recording densities is perpendicular recording (PMR), first shipped in 2005, and as of 2007[ [update]], used in certain HDDs. Perpendicular recording may be accompanied by changes in the manufacturing of the read/write heads to increase the strength of the magnetic field created by the heads.\nIn 2004, a higher-density recording media was introduced, consisting of coupled soft and hard magnetic layers. So-called \"exchange spring media\" magnetic storage technology, also known as \"exchange coupled composite media\", allows good writability due to the write-assist nature of the soft layer. However, the thermal stability is determined only by the hardest layer and not influenced by the soft layer.\nFlux control MAMR (FC-MAMR) allows a hard drive to have increased recording capacity without the need for new hard disk drive platter materials. MAMR hard drives have a microwave-generating spin torque generator (STO) on the read/write heads which allows physically smaller bits to be recorded to the platters, increasing areal density. Normally hard drive recording heads have a pole called a main pole that is used for writing to the platters, and adjacent to this pole is an air gap and a shield. The write coil of the head surrounds the pole. The STO device is placed in the air gap between the pole and the shield to increase the strength of the magnetic field created by the pole; FC-MAMR technically doesn't use microwaves but uses technology employed in MAMR. The STO has a Field Generation Layer (FGL) and a Spin Injection Layer (SIL), and the FGL produces a magnetic field using spin-polarised electrons originating in the SIL, which is a form of spin torque energy.\nComponents.\nThe \"&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Visible anchor/styles.css\" /&gt;actuator\" is a permanent magnet and moving coil motor that swings the heads to the desired position. A metal plate supports a squat neodymium\u2013iron\u2013boron (NIB) high-flux magnet. Beneath this plate is the moving coil, often referred to as the \"voice coil\" by analogy to the coil in loudspeakers, which is attached to the actuator hub, and beneath that is a second NIB magnet, mounted on the bottom plate of the motor (some drives have only one magnet).\nThe voice coil itself is shaped rather like an arrowhead and is made of doubly coated copper magnet wire. The inner layer is insulation, and the outer is thermoplastic, which bonds the coil together after it is wound on a form, making it self-supporting. The portions of the coil along the two sides of the arrowhead (which point to the center of the actuator bearing) then interact with the magnetic field of the fixed magnet. Current flowing radially outward along one side of the arrowhead and radially inward on the other produces the tangential force. If the magnetic field were uniform, each side would generate opposing forces that would cancel each other out. Therefore, the surface of the magnet is half north pole and half south pole, with the radial dividing line in the middle, causing the two sides of the coil to see opposite magnetic fields and produce forces that add instead of canceling. Currents along the top and bottom of the coil produce radial forces that do not rotate the head.\nThe HDD's electronics controls the movement of the actuator and the rotation of the disk and transfers data to or from a disk controller. Feedback of the drive electronics is accomplished by means of special segments of the disk dedicated to servo feedback. These are either complete concentric circles (in the case of dedicated servo technology) or segments interspersed with real data (in the case of embedded servo, otherwise known as sector servo technology). The servo feedback optimizes the signal-to-noise ratio of the GMR sensors by adjusting the voice coil motor to rotate the arm. A more modern servo system also employs milli or micro actuators to more accurately position the read/write heads. The spinning of the disks uses fluid-bearing spindle motors. Modern disk firmware is capable of scheduling reads and writes efficiently on the platter surfaces and remapping sectors of the media that have failed.\nError rates and handling.\nModern drives make extensive use of error correction codes (ECCs), particularly Reed\u2013Solomon error correction. These techniques store extra bits, determined by mathematical formulas, for each block of data; the extra bits allow many errors to be corrected invisibly. The extra bits themselves take up space on the HDD, but allow higher recording densities to be employed without causing uncorrectable errors, resulting in much larger storage capacity. For example, a typical 1\u00a0TB hard disk with 512-byte sectors provides additional capacity of about 93\u00a0GB for the ECC data.\nIn the newest drives, as of 2009[ [update]], low-density parity-check codes (LDPC) were supplanting Reed\u2013Solomon; LDPC codes enable performance close to the Shannon limit and thus provide the highest storage density available.\nTypical hard disk drives attempt to \"remap\" the data in a physical sector that is failing to a spare physical sector provided by the drive's \"spare sector pool\" (also called \"reserve pool\"), while relying on the ECC to recover stored data while the number of errors in a bad sector is still low enough. The S.M.A.R.T (Self-Monitoring, Analysis and Reporting Technology) feature counts the total number of errors in the entire HDD fixed by ECC (although not on all hard drives as the related S.M.A.R.T attributes \"Hardware ECC Recovered\" and \"Soft ECC Correction\" are not consistently supported), and the total number of performed sector remappings, as the occurrence of many such errors may predict an HDD failure.\nThe \"No-ID Format\", developed by IBM in the mid-1990s, contains information about which sectors are bad and where remapped sectors have been located.\nOnly a tiny fraction of the detected errors end up as not correctable. Examples of specified uncorrected bit read error rates include:\nWithin a given manufacturers model the uncorrected bit error rate is typically the same regardless of capacity of the drive.\nThe worst type of errors are silent data corruptions which are errors undetected by the disk firmware or the host operating system; some of these errors may be caused by hard disk drive malfunctions while others originate elsewhere in the connection between the drive and the host.\nDevelopment.\nThe rate of areal density advancement was similar to Moore's law (doubling every two years) through 2010: 60% per year during 1988\u20131996, 100% during 1996\u20132003 and 30% during 2003\u20132010. Speaking in 1997, Gordon Moore called the increase \"flabbergasting\", while observing later that growth cannot continue forever. Price improvement decelerated to \u221212% per year during 2010\u20132017, as the growth of areal density slowed. The rate of advancement for areal density slowed to 10% per year during 2010\u20132016, and there was difficulty in migrating from perpendicular recording to newer technologies.\nAs bit cell size decreases, more data can be put onto a single drive platter. In 2013, a production desktop 3\u00a0TB HDD (with four platters) would have had an areal density of about 500\u00a0Gbit/in2 which would have amounted to a bit cell comprising about 18 magnetic grains (11 by 1.6 grains). Since the mid-2000s, areal density progress has been challenged by a superparamagnetic trilemma involving grain size, grain magnetic strength and ability of the head to write. In order to maintain acceptable signal-to-noise, smaller grains are required; smaller grains may self-reverse (electrothermal instability) unless their magnetic strength is increased, but known write head materials are unable to generate a strong enough magnetic field sufficient to write the medium in the increasingly smaller space taken by grains.\nMagnetic storage technologies are being developed to address this trilemma, and compete with flash memory\u2013based solid-state drives (SSDs). In 2013, Seagate introduced shingled magnetic recording (SMR), intended as something of a \"stopgap\" technology between PMR and Seagate's intended successor heat-assisted magnetic recording (HAMR). SMR utilizes overlapping tracks for increased data density, at the cost of design complexity and lower data access speeds (particularly write speeds and random access 4k speeds).\nBy contrast, HGST (now part of Western Digital) focused on developing ways to seal helium-filled drives instead of the usual filtered air. Since turbulence and friction are reduced, higher areal densities can be achieved due to using a smaller track width, and the energy dissipated due to friction is lower as well, resulting in a lower power draw. Furthermore, more platters can be fit into the same enclosure space, although helium gas is notoriously difficult to prevent escaping. Thus, helium drives are completely sealed and do not have a breather port, unlike their air-filled counterparts.\nOther recording technologies are either under research or have been commercially implemented to increase areal density, including Seagate's heat-assisted magnetic recording (HAMR). HAMR requires a different architecture with redesigned media and read/write heads, new lasers, and new near-field optical transducers. HAMR shipped commercially in early 2024 after technical issues delayed its introduction by more than a decade, from earlier projections as early as 2009. HAMR's planned successor, bit-patterned recording (BPR), has been removed from the roadmaps of Western Digital and Seagate. Western Digital's microwave-assisted magnetic recording (MAMR), also referred to as energy-assisted magnetic recording (EAMR), was sampled in 2020, with the first EAMR drive, the Ultrastar HC550, shipping in late 2020. Two-dimensional magnetic recording (TDMR) and \"current perpendicular to plane\" giant magnetoresistance (CPP/GMR) heads have appeared in research papers.\nSome drives have adopted dual independent actuator arms to increase read/write speeds and compete with SSDs.\nA 3D-actuated vacuum drive (3DHD) concept and 3D magnetic recording have been proposed.\nDepending upon assumptions on feasibility and timing of these technologies, Seagate forecasts that areal density will grow 20% per year during 2020\u20132034.\nCapacity.\nThe highest-capacity HDDs shipping commercially as of 2025[ [update]] are 36\u00a0TB.\nThe capacity of a hard disk drive, as reported by an operating system to the end user, is smaller than the amount stated by the manufacturer for several reasons, e.g. the operating system using some space, use of some space for data redundancy, space use for file system structures. Confusion of decimal prefixes and binary prefixes can also lead to errors.\nCalculation.\nModern hard disk drives appear to their host controller as a contiguous set of logical blocks, and the gross drive capacity is calculated by multiplying the number of blocks by the block size. This information is available from the manufacturer's product specification, and from the drive itself through use of operating system functions that invoke low-level drive commands. Older IBM and compatible drives, e.g. IBM 3390 using the CKD record format, have variable length records; such drive capacity calculations must take into account the characteristics of the records. Some newer DASD simulate CKD, and the same capacity formulae apply.\nThe gross capacity of older sector-oriented HDDs is calculated as the product of the number of cylinders per recording zone, the number of bytes per sector (most commonly 512), and the count of zones of the drive. Some modern SATA drives also report cylinder-head-sector (CHS) capacities, but these are not physical parameters because the reported values are constrained by historic operating system interfaces. The C/H/S scheme has been replaced by logical block addressing (LBA), a simple linear addressing scheme that locates blocks by an integer index, which starts at LBA 0 for the first block and increments thereafter. When using the C/H/S method to describe modern large drives, the number of heads is often set to 64, although a typical modern hard disk drive has between one and four platters. In modern HDDs, spare capacity for defect management is not included in the published capacity; however, in many early HDDs, a certain number of sectors were reserved as spares, thereby reducing the capacity available to the operating system. Furthermore, many HDDs store their firmware in a reserved service zone, which is typically not accessible by the user, and is not included in the capacity calculation.\nFor RAID subsystems, data integrity and fault-tolerance requirements also reduce the realized capacity. For example, a RAID\u00a01 array has about half the total capacity as a result of data mirroring, while a RAID\u00a05 array with n drives loses 1/n of capacity (which equals to the capacity of a single drive) due to storing parity information. RAID subsystems are multiple drives that appear to be one drive or more drives to the user, but provide fault tolerance. Most RAID vendors use checksums to improve data integrity at the block level. Some vendors design systems using HDDs with sectors of 520 bytes to contain 512 bytes of user data and eight checksum bytes, or by using separate 512-byte sectors for the checksum data.\nSome systems may use hidden partitions for system recovery, reducing the capacity available to the end user without knowledge of special disk partitioning utilities like diskpart in Windows.\nFormatting.\nData is stored on a hard drive in a series of logical blocks. Each block is delimited by markers identifying its start and end, error detecting and correcting information, and space between blocks to allow for minor timing variations. These blocks often contained 512 bytes of usable data, but other sizes have been used. As drive density increased, an initiative known as Advanced Format extended the block size to 4096 bytes of usable data, with a resulting significant reduction in the amount of disk space used for block headers, error-checking data, and spacing.\nThe process of initializing these logical blocks on the physical disk platters is called \"low-level formatting\", which is usually performed at the factory and is not normally changed in the field. \"High-level formatting\" writes data structures used by the operating system to organize data files on the disk. This includes writing partition and file system structures into selected logical blocks. For example, some of the disk space will be used to hold a directory of disk file names and a list of logical blocks associated with a particular file.\nExamples of partition mapping scheme include master boot record (MBR) and GUID Partition Table (GPT). Examples of data structures stored on disk to retrieve files include the File Allocation Table (FAT) in the MS-DOS file system and inodes in many UNIX file systems, as well as other operating system data structures (also known as metadata). As a consequence, not all the space on an HDD is available for user files, but this system overhead is usually small compared with user data.\nUnits.\nIn the early days of computing, the total capacity of HDDs was specified in seven to nine decimal digits frequently truncated with the idiom \"millions\".\nBy the 1970s, the total capacity of HDDs was given by manufacturers using SI decimal prefixes such as megabytes (1\u00a0MB\u00a0= 1,000,000\u00a0bytes), gigabytes (1\u00a0GB\u00a0= 1,000,000,000\u00a0bytes) and terabytes (1\u00a0TB\u00a0= 1,000,000,000,000 bytes). However, capacities of memory are usually quoted using a binary interpretation of the prefixes, i.e. using powers of 1024 instead of 1000.\nSoftware reports hard disk drive or memory capacity in different forms using either decimal or binary prefixes. The Microsoft Windows family of operating systems uses the binary convention when reporting storage capacity, so an HDD offered by its manufacturer as a 1\u00a0TB drive is reported by these operating systems as a 931\u00a0GB HDD. Mac OS X 10.6 (\"Snow Leopard\") uses decimal convention when reporting HDD capacity. The default behavior of the df command-line utility on Linux is to report the HDD capacity as a number of 1024-byte units.\nThe difference between the decimal and binary prefix interpretation caused some consumer confusion and led to class action suits against HDD manufacturers. The plaintiffs argued that the use of decimal prefixes effectively misled consumers, while the defendants denied any wrongdoing or liability, asserting that their marketing and advertising complied in all respects with the law and that no class member sustained any damages or injuries. In 2020, a California court ruled that use of the decimal prefixes with a decimal meaning was not misleading.\nForm factors.\nIBM's first hard disk drive, the IBM\u00a0350, used a stack of fifty 24-inch platters, stored 3.75 MB of data (approximately the size of one modern digital picture), and was of a size comparable to two large refrigerators. In 1962, IBM introduced its model 1311 disk, which used six 14-inch (nominal size) platters in a removable pack and was roughly the size of a washing machine. This became a standard platter size for many years, used also by other manufacturers. The IBM 2314 used platters of the same size in an eleven-high pack and introduced the \"drive in a drawer\" layout, sometimes called the \"pizza oven\", although the \"drawer\" was not the complete drive. Into the 1970s, HDDs were offered in standalone cabinets of varying dimensions containing from one to four HDDs.\nBeginning in the late 1960s, drives were offered that fit entirely into a chassis that would mount in a 19-inch rack. Digital's RK05 and RL01 were early examples using single 14-inch platters in removable packs, the entire drive fitting in a 10.5-inch-high rack space (six rack units). In the mid-to-late 1980s, the similarly sized Fujitsu Eagle, which used (coincidentally) 10.5-inch platters, was a popular product.\nWith increasing sales of microcomputers having built-in floppy-disk drives (FDDs), HDDs that would fit to the FDD mountings became desirable. Starting with the Shugart Associates SA1000, HDD form factors initially followed those of 8-inch, &lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;5+1\u20444-inch, and &lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;3+1\u20442-inch floppy disk drives. Although referred to by these nominal sizes, the actual sizes for those three drives respectively are 9.5\", 5.75\" and 4\" wide. Because there were no smaller floppy disk drives, smaller HDD form factors such as &lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;2+1\u20442-inch drives (actually 2.75\" wide) developed from product offerings or industry standards.\nAs of 2025[ [update]], &lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;2+1\u20442-inch and &lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;3+1\u20442-inch hard disks are the most popular sizes. By 2009, all manufacturers had discontinued the development of new products for the 1.3-inch, 1-inch and 0.85-inch form factors due to falling prices of flash memory, which has no moving parts. While nominal sizes are in inches, actual dimensions are specified in millimeters.\nConsumer hard drives are commonly sold pre-packaged in disk enclosures, which protect the device and allow attaching them via common general purpose interfaces like USB, allowing the device to remain separate from any computer using it and to be portable. Such enclosures vary widely in size as they are usually not intended to be inserted into a system as a fixed component. Enclosures may also contain multiple hard drives combined as RAID.\nPerformance characteristics.\nThe factors that limit the time to access the data on an HDD are mostly related to the mechanical nature of the rotating disks and moving heads, including:\nDelay may also occur if the drive disks are stopped to save energy.\nDefragmentation is a procedure used to minimize delay in retrieving data by moving related items to physically proximate areas on the disk. Some computer operating systems perform defragmentation automatically. Although automatic defragmentation is intended to reduce access delays, performance will be temporarily reduced while the procedure is in progress.\nTime to access data can be improved by increasing rotational speed (thus reducing latency) or by reducing the time spent seeking. Increasing areal density increases throughput by increasing data rate and by increasing the amount of data under a set of heads, thereby potentially reducing seek activity for a given amount of data. The time to access data has not kept up with throughput increases, which themselves have not kept up with growth in bit density and storage capacity.\nData transfer rate.\nAs of 2010[ [update]], a typical 7,200-rpm desktop HDD has a sustained \"disk-to-buffer\" data transfer rate up to 1,030 Mbit/s. This rate depends on the track location; the rate is higher for data on the outer tracks (where there are more data sectors per rotation) and lower toward the inner tracks (where there are fewer data sectors per rotation); and is generally somewhat higher for 10,000-rpm drives. A current, widely used standard for the \"buffer-to-computer\" interface is 3.0 Gbit/s SATA, which can send about 300 megabyte/s (10-bit encoding) from the buffer to the computer, and thus is still comfortably ahead of today's disk-to-buffer transfer rates. Data transfer rate (read/write) can be measured by writing a large file to disk using special file-generator tools, then reading back the file. Transfer rate can be influenced by file system fragmentation and the layout of the files.\nHDD data transfer rate depends upon the rotational speed of the platters and the data recording density. Because heat and vibration limit rotational speed, advancing density becomes the main method to improve sequential transfer rates. Higher speeds require a more powerful spindle motor, which creates more heat. While areal density advances by increasing both the number of tracks across the disk and the number of sectors per track, only the latter increases the data transfer rate for a given rpm. Since data transfer rate performance tracks only one of the two components of areal density, its performance improves at a lower rate.\nOther considerations.\nOther performance considerations include quality-adjusted price, power consumption, audible noise, and both operating and non-operating shock resistance.\nAccess and interfaces.\nCurrent hard drives connect to a computer over one of several bus types, including parallel ATA, Serial ATA, SCSI, Serial Attached SCSI (SAS), and Fibre Channel. Some drives, especially external portable drives, use IEEE\u00a01394, or USB. All of these interfaces are digital; electronics on the drive process the analog signals from the read/write heads. Current drives present a consistent interface to the rest of the computer, independent of the data encoding scheme used internally, and independent of the physical number of disks and heads within the drive.\nTypically, a DSP in the electronics inside the drive takes the raw analog voltages from the read head and uses PRML and Reed\u2013Solomon error correction to decode the data, then sends that data out the standard interface. That DSP also watches the error rate detected by error detection and correction, and performs bad sector remapping, data collection for Self-Monitoring, Analysis, and Reporting Technology, and other internal tasks.\nModern interfaces connect the drive to the host interface with a single data/control cable. Each drive also has an additional power cable, usually direct to the power supply unit. Older interfaces had separate cables for data signals and for drive control signals.\nIntegrity and failure.\nDue to the extremely close spacing between the heads and the disk surface, HDDs are vulnerable to being damaged by a head crash\u00a0\u2013 a failure of the disk in which the head scrapes across the platter surface, often grinding away the thin magnetic film and causing data loss. Head crashes can be caused by electronic failure, a sudden power failure, physical shock, contamination of the drive's internal enclosure, wear and tear, corrosion, or poorly manufactured platters and heads.\nThe HDD's spindle system relies on air density inside the disk enclosure to support the heads at their proper flying height while the disk rotates. HDDs require a certain range of air densities to operate properly. The connection to the external environment and density occurs through a small hole in the enclosure (about 0.5\u00a0mm in breadth), usually with a filter on the inside (the \"breather filter\"). If the air density is too low, then there is not enough lift for the flying head, so the head gets too close to the disk, and there is a risk of head crashes and data loss. Specially manufactured sealed and pressurized disks are needed for reliable high-altitude operation, above about . Modern disks include temperature sensors and adjust their operation to the operating environment. Breather holes can be seen on most disk drives, excluding sealed drives, such as drives that use helium, where any exposure to outside air would cause a failure\u00a0\u2013 they usually have a sticker next to them, warning the user not to cover the holes. The air inside the operating drive is constantly moving too, being swept in motion by friction with the spinning platters. This air passes through an internal recirculation filter to remove any leftover contaminants from manufacture, any particles or chemicals that may have somehow entered the enclosure, and any particles or outgassing generated internally in normal operation. Very high humidity present for extended periods of time can corrode the heads and platters. An exception to this are hermetically sealed, helium-filled HDDs that largely eliminate environmental issues that can arise due to humidity or atmospheric pressure changes. Such HDDs were introduced by HGST in their first successful high-volume implementation in 2013.\nFor giant magnetoresistive (GMR) heads in particular, a minor head crash from contamination (that does not remove the magnetic surface of the disk) still results in the head temporarily overheating, due to friction with the disk surface and can render the data unreadable for a short period until the head temperature stabilizes (so-called \"thermal asperity\", a problem which can partially be dealt with by proper electronic filtering of the read signal).\nWhen the logic board of a hard disk fails, the drive can often be restored to functioning order and the data recovered by replacing the circuit board with one of an identical hard disk. In the case of read-write head faults, they can be replaced using specialized tools in a dust-free environment. If the disk platters are undamaged, they can be transferred into an identical enclosure and the data can be copied or cloned onto a new drive. In the event of disk-platter failures, disassembly and imaging of the disk platters may be required. For logical damage to file systems, a variety of tools, including fsck on UNIX-like systems and CHKDSK on Windows, can be used for data recovery. Recovery from logical damage can require file carving.\nA common expectation is that hard disk drives designed and marketed for server use will fail less frequently than consumer-grade drives usually used in desktop computers. However, two independent studies by Carnegie Mellon University and Google found that the \"grade\" of a drive does not relate to the drive's failure rate.\nA 2011 summary of research, into SSD and magnetic disk failure patterns by Tom's Hardware summarized research findings as follows:\nAs of 2019[ [update]], Backblaze, a storage provider, reported an annualized failure rate of two percent per year for a storage farm with 110,000 off-the-shelf HDDs with the reliability varying widely between models and manufacturers. Backblaze subsequently reported in 2021 that the failure rate for HDDs and SSD of equivalent age was similar.\nTo minimize cost and overcome failures of individual HDDs, storage systems providers rely on redundant HDD arrays. HDDs that fail are replaced on an ongoing basis.\n Desktop HDDs typically have one to five internal platters, rotate at 5,400 to 10,000\u00a0rpm, and have a media transfer rate of 0.5 Gbit/s or higher (1\u00a0GB = 109 bytes; 1 Gbit/s = 109 bit/s). Earlier (1980\u20131990s) drives tend to be slower in rotation speed. As of January 2025[ [update]], the highest-capacity desktop HDDs stored 36TB, with plans to release 50\u00a0TB drives later in 2025. 36\u00a0TB HDDs were released in 2025.. As of 2016[ [update]], the typical speed of a hard drive in an average desktop computer is 7,200\u00a0rpm, whereas low-cost desktop computers may use 5,900\u00a0rpm or 5,400\u00a0rpm drives. For some time in the 2000s and early 2010s some desktop users and data centers also used 10,000\u00a0rpm drives such as Western Digital Raptor but such drives have become much rarer as of 2016[ [update]] (since the WD VelociRaptor was discontinued) and are not commonly used now, having been replaced by NAND flash-based SSDs.\n Smaller than their desktop and enterprise counterparts, they tend to be slower and have lower capacity, because typically has one internal platter and were 2.5\" or 1.8\" physical size instead of more common for desktops 3.5\" form-factor. Mobile HDDs spin at 4,200\u00a0rpm, 5,200\u00a0rpm, 5,400\u00a0rpm, or 7,200\u00a0rpm, with 5,400\u00a0rpm being the most common; 7,200\u00a0rpm drives tend to be more expensive and have smaller capacities, while 4,200\u00a0rpm models usually were in older laptops and portables but are now outdated. Because of smaller platter(s), mobile HDDs generally have lower capacity than their desktop counterparts.\nMarket segments.\nConsumer segment.\nThese drives typically spin at 5400\u00a0rpm and include:\n Current external hard disk drives typically connect via USB-C; earlier models use USB-B (sometimes with using of a pair of ports for better bandwidth) or (rarely) eSATA connection. Variants using USB\u00a02.0 interface generally have slower data transfer rates when compared to internally mounted hard drives connected through SATA. Plug and play drive functionality offers system compatibility and features large storage options and portable design. As of \u00a02015[ [update]], available capacities for external hard disk drives ranged from 500\u00a0GB to 10\u00a0TB. External hard disk drives are usually available as assembled integrated products, but may be also assembled by combining an external enclosure (with USB or other interface) with a separately purchased drive. They are available in 2.5-inch and 3.5-inch sizes; 2.5-inch variants are typically called \"portable external drives\", while 3.5-inch variants are referred to as \"desktop external drives\". \"Portable\" drives are packaged in smaller and lighter enclosures than the \"desktop\" drives; additionally, \"portable\" drives use power provided by the USB connection, while \"desktop\" drives require external power bricks. Features such as encryption, Wi-Fi connectivity, biometric security or multiple interfaces (for example, FireWire) are available at a higher cost. There are pre-assembled external hard disk drives that, when taken out from their enclosures, cannot be used internally in a laptop or desktop computer due to embedded USB interface on their printed circuit boards, and lack of SATA (or Parallel ATA) interfaces.\n Typically used with multiple-user computers running enterprise software. Examples are: transaction processing databases, internet infrastructure (email, webserver, e-commerce), scientific computing software, and nearline storage management software. Enterprise drives commonly operate continuously (\"24/7\") in demanding environments while delivering the highest possible performance without sacrificing reliability. Maximum capacity is not the primary goal, and as a result the drives are often offered in capacities that are relatively low in relation to their cost.\n The fastest enterprise HDDs spin at 10,000 or 15,000\u00a0rpm, and can achieve sequential media transfer speeds above 1.6 Gbit/s and a sustained transfer rate up to 1 Gbit/s. Drives running at 10,000 or 15,000\u00a0rpm use smaller platters to mitigate increased power requirements (as they have less air drag) and therefore generally have lower capacity than the highest capacity desktop drives. Enterprise HDDs are commonly connected through Serial Attached SCSI (SAS) or Fibre Channel (FC). Some support multiple ports, so they can be connected to a redundant host bus adapter.\n Enterprise HDDs can have sector sizes larger than 512 bytes (often 520, 524, 528 or 536 bytes). The additional per-sector space can be used by hardware RAID controllers or applications for storing Data Integrity Field (DIF) or Data Integrity Extensions (DIX) data, resulting in higher reliability and prevention of silent data corruption.\n Video recording HDDs used in network video recorders.\nEconomy.\nPrice evolution.\nHDD price per byte decreased at the rate of 40% per year during 1988\u20131996, 51% per year during 1996\u20132003 and 34% per year during 2003\u20132010. The price decrease slowed down to 13% per year during 2011\u20132014, as areal density increase slowed and the 2011 Thailand floods damaged manufacturing facilities and have held at 11% per year during 2010\u20132017.\nThe Federal Reserve Board has published a quality-adjusted price index for large-scale enterprise storage systems including three or more enterprise HDDs and associated controllers, racks and cables. Prices for these large-scale storage systems decreased at the rate of 30% per year during 2004\u20132009 and 22% per year during 2009\u20132014.\nManufacturers and sales.\nMore than 200 companies have manufactured HDDs over time, but consolidations have concentrated production to just three manufacturers today: Western Digital, Seagate, and Toshiba. Production is mainly in the Pacific rim.\nHDD unit shipments peaked at 651 million units in 2010 and have been declining since then to 166 million units in 2022. Seagate at 43% of units had the largest market share.\nCompetition from SSDs.\nHDDs are being superseded by solid-state drives (SSDs) in markets where the higher speed (up to 7 gigabytes per second for M.2 (NGFF) NVMe drives and 2.5 gigabytes per second for PCIe expansion card drives)), ruggedness, and lower power of SSDs are more important than price, since the bit cost of SSDs is four to nine times higher than HDDs. As of 2016[ [update]], HDDs are reported to have a failure rate of 2\u20139% per year, while SSDs have fewer failures: 1\u20133% per year. However, SSDs have more un-correctable data errors than HDDs.\nSSDs are available in larger capacities (up to 100\u00a0TB) than the largest HDD, as well as higher storage densities (100\u00a0TB and 30\u00a0TB SSDs are housed in 2.5 inch HDD cases with the same height as a 3.5-inch HDD), although such large SSDs are very expensive.\nA laboratory demonstration of a 1.33\u00a0Tb 3D NAND chip with 96 layers (NAND commonly used in solid-state drives (SSDs)) had 5.5\u00a0Tbit/in2 as of 2019[ [update]]), while the maximum areal density for HDDs is 1.5\u00a0Tbit/in2. The areal density of flash memory is doubling every two years, similar to Moore's law (40% per year) and faster than the 10\u201320% per year for HDDs. In 2025, the maximum capacity was 36\u00a0terabytes for a HDD, and 100\u00a0terabytes for an SSD. HDDs were used in 70% of the desktop and notebook computers produced in 2016, and SSDs were used in 30%. In 2025 HDDs are not found in laptops, if not very rarely, and most desktops come with an SSD only, though some still are configured with an SSD and HDD, or rarely with an HDD only.\nThe market for silicon-based flash memory (NAND) chips, used in SSDs and other applications, is growing faster than for HDDs. Worldwide NAND revenue grew 16% per year from $22 billion to $57 billion during 2011\u20132017, while production grew 45% per year from 19 exabytes to 175 exabytes.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "13782", "revid": "40905105", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=13782", "title": "Hebrew calendar", "text": "Lunisolar calendar used for Jewish religious observances\nThe Hebrew calendar (, ), also called the Jewish calendar, is a lunisolar calendar used today for Jewish religious observance and as an official calendar of Israel. It determines the dates of Jewish holidays and other rituals, such as \"yahrzeits\" and the schedule of public Torah readings. In Israel, it is used for religious purposes, provides a time frame for agriculture, and is an official calendar for civil holidays alongside the Gregorian calendar.\nLike other lunisolar calendars, the Hebrew calendar consists of months of 29 or 30 days which begin and end at approximately the time of the new moon. As 12 such months comprise a total of just 354 days, an extra lunar month is added every 2 or 3 years so that the long-term average year length closely approximates the actual length of the solar year.\nOriginally, the beginning of each month was determined based on physical observation of a new moon, while the decision of whether to add the leap month was based on observation of natural agriculture-related events in ancient Israel. Between the years 70 and 1178, these empirical criteria were gradually replaced with a set of mathematical rules. Month length now follows a fixed schedule which is adjusted based on the molad interval (a mathematical approximation of the mean time between new moons) and several other rules, while leap months are now added in 7 out of every 19 years according to the Metonic cycle.\nNowadays, Hebrew years are generally counted according to the system of (Latin: \"in the year of the world\"; , \"from the creation of the world\", abbreviated AM) according to traditional Jewish interpretation of the chronology of the Hebrew Bible. This system attempts to calculate the number of years since the creation of the world according to the Genesis creation narrative and subsequent Biblical stories. The current Hebrew year, AM , began at sunset on and will end at sunset on .\nComponents.\nDays.\nBased on the classic rabbinic interpretation of (\"There was evening and there was morning, one day\"), a day in the rabbinic Hebrew calendar runs from sunset (the start of \"the evening\") to the next sunset. Similarly, Yom Kippur, Passover, and Shabbat are described in the Bible as lasting \"from evening to evening\". The days are therefore figured locally.\nHalachically, the exact time when days begin or end is uncertain: this time could be either sundown (\"shekiah\") or else nightfall (\"tzait ha'kochavim\", \"when the stars appear\"). The time between sundown and nightfall (\"bein hashmashot\") is of uncertain status. Thus (for example) observance of Shabbat begins before sundown on Friday and ends after nightfall on Saturday, to be sure that Shabbat is not violated no matter when the transition between days occurs.\nInstead of the International Date Line convention, there are varying opinions as to where the day changes. (See International date line in Judaism.)\nHours.\nJudaism uses multiple systems for dividing hours. In one system, the 24-hour day is divided into fixed hours equal to &lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;1\u204424 of a day, while each hour is divided into 1080 \"halakim\" (parts, singular: \"helek\"). A part is &lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;3+1\u20443 seconds (&lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;1\u204418 minute). The ultimate ancestor of the \"helek\" was a Babylonian time period called a \"barleycorn\", equal to &lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;1\u204472 of a Babylonian \"time degree\" (1\u00b0 of celestial rotation). These measures are not generally used for everyday purposes; their best-known use is for calculating and announcing the molad.\nIn another system, the daytime period is divided into 12 relative hours (\"sha'ah z'manit\", also sometimes called \"halachic hours\"). A relative hour is defined as &lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;1\u204412 of the time from sunrise to sunset, or dawn to dusk, as per the two opinions in this regard. Therefore, an hour can be less than 60 minutes in winter, and more than 60 minutes in summer; similarly, the 6th hour ends at solar noon, which generally differs from 12:00. Relative hours are used for the calculation of prayer times (zmanim); for example, the Shema must be recited in the first three relative hours of the day.\nNeither system is commonly used in ordinary life; rather, the local civil clock is used. This is even the case for ritual times (e.g. \"The latest time to recite Shema today is 9:38 AM\").\nWeeks.\nThe Hebrew week (, ) is a cycle of seven days, mirroring the seven-day period of the Book of Genesis in which the world is created.\nThe names for the days of the week are simply the day number within the week. The week begins with Day 1 (Sunday) and ends with Shabbat (Saturday). (More precisely, since days begin in the evening, weeks begin and end on Saturday evening. Day 1 lasts from Saturday evening to Sunday evening, while Shabbat lasts from Friday evening to Saturday evening.)\nSince some calculations use division, a remainder of 0 signifies Saturday.\nIn Hebrew, these names may be abbreviated using the numerical value of the Hebrew letters, for example (\"Day 1\", or \"Yom Rishon\" ()):\nThe names of the days of the week are modeled on the seven days mentioned in the Genesis creation account. For example, \"... And there was evening and there was morning, a second day\" corresponds to \"Yom Sheni\" meaning \"second day\". (However, for days 1, 6, and 7 the modern name differs slightly from the version in Genesis.)\nThe seventh day, Shabbat, as its Hebrew name indicates, is a day of rest in Judaism. In Talmudic Hebrew, the word \"Shabbat\" () can also mean \"week\", so that in ritual liturgy a phrase like \"Yom Revi\u02bbi beShabbat\" means \"the fourth day in the week\".\nDays of week of holidays.\nJewish holidays can only fall on the weekdays shown in the following table:\nThe period from 1 Adar (or Adar II, in leap years) to 29 Marcheshvan contains all of the festivals specified in the Bible (Purim, Passover, Shavuot, Rosh Hashanah, Yom Kippur, Sukkot, and Shemini Atzeret). The lengths of months in this period are fixed, meaning that the day of week of Passover dictates the day of week of the other Biblical holidays. However, the lengths of the months of Marcheshvan and Kislev can each vary by a day (due to the Rosh Hashanah postponement rules which are used to adjust the year length). As a result, the holidays falling after Marcheshvan (starting with Chanukah) can fall on multiple days for a given row of the table.\nA common mnemonic is \"\", meaning: \"Rosh HaShana cannot be on Sunday, Wednesday or Friday, and Passover cannot be on Monday, Wednesday or Friday\" with each day's numerical equivalent, in gematria, is used, such that \u05d0' = 1 = Sunday, and so forth. From this rule, every other date can be calculated by adding weeks and days until that date's possible day of the week can be derived.\nMonths.\nThe Hebrew calendar is a lunisolar calendar, meaning that months are based on lunar months, but years are based on solar years. The calendar year features twelve lunar months of 29 or 30 days, with an additional lunar month (\"leap month\") added periodically to synchronize the twelve lunar cycles with the longer solar year. These extra months are added in seven years (3, 6, 8, 11, 14, 17, and 19) out of a 19-year cycle, known as the Metonic cycle (See Leap months, below).\nThe beginning of each Jewish lunar month is based on the appearance of the new moon. Although originally the new lunar crescent had to be observed and certified by witnesses (as is still done in Karaite Judaism and Islam), nowadays Jewish months have generally fixed lengths which approximate the period between new moons. For these reasons, a given month does not always begin on the same day as its astronomical conjunction.\nThe mean period of the lunar month (precisely, the synodic month) is very close to 29.5\u00a0days. Accordingly, the basic Hebrew calendar year is one of twelve lunar months alternating between 29 and 30 days:\nThus, the year normally contains twelve months with a total of 354\u00a0days. In such a year, the month of Marcheshvan has 29\u00a0days and Kislev has 30\u00a0days. However, due to the Rosh Hashanah postponement rules, in some years Kislev may lose a day to have 29\u00a0days, or Marcheshvan may acquire an additional day to have 30\u00a0days.\nNormally the 12th month is named Adar. During leap years, the 12th and 13th months are named Adar I and Adar II (Hebrew: \"Adar Aleph\" and \"Adar Bet\"\u2014\"first Adar\" and \"second adar\"). Sources disagree as to which of these months is the \"real\" Adar, and which is the added leap month.\nJustification for leap months.\nThe Bible does not directly mention the addition of leap months (also known as \"embolismic\" or \"intercalary\" months). The insertion of the leap month is based on the requirement that Passover occur at the same time of year as the spring barley harvest (\"aviv\"). (Since 12 lunar months make up less than a solar year, the date of Passover would gradually move throughout the solar year if leap months were not occasionally added.) According to the rabbinic calculation, this requirement means that Passover (or at least most of Passover) should fall after the March equinox. Similarly, the holidays of Shavuot and Sukkot are presumed by the Torah to fall in specific agricultural seasons.\nMaimonides, discussing the calendrical rules in his Mishneh Torah (1178), notes:\nBy how much does the solar year exceed the lunar year? By approximately 11 days. Therefore, whenever this excess accumulates to about 30 days, or a little more or less, one month is added and the particular year is made to consist of 13 months, and this is the so-called embolismic (intercalated) year. For the year could not consist of twelve months plus so-and-so many days, since it is said: \"throughout the months of the year\", which implies that we should count the year by months and not by days.\nYears.\nNew year.\nThe Hebrew calendar year conventionally begins on Rosh Hashanah, the first day of Tishrei. However, the Jewish calendar also defines several additional new years, used for different purposes. The use of multiple starting dates for a year is comparable to different starting dates for civil \"calendar years\", \"tax or fiscal years\", \"academic years\", and so on. The \"Mishnah\" (c. 200 CE) identifies four new-year dates:\nThe 1st of Nisan is the new year for kings and festivals. The 1st of Elul is the new year for the cattle tithe, Rabbi Eliezer and Rabbi Shimon say on the first of Tishrei. The 1st of Tishri is the new year for years, of the Shmita and Jubilee years, for planting and for vegetables. The 1st of Shevat is the new year for trees\u2014so the school of Shammai, but the school of Hillel say: On the 15th thereof.\nTwo of these dates are especially prominent:\nFor the dates of the Jewish New Year see Jewish and Israeli holidays 2000\u20132050.\nAnno Mundi.\nThe Jewish year number is generally given by \"\" (from Latin \"in the year of the world\", often abbreviated \"AM\" or \"A.M.\"). In this calendar era, the year number equals the number of years that have passed since the creation of the world, according to an interpretation of Biblical accounts of the creation and subsequent history. From the eleventh century, \"anno mundi\" dating became the dominant method of counting years throughout most of the world's Jewish communities, replacing earlier systems such as the Seleucid era.\nAs with (A.D. or AD), the words or abbreviation for (A.M. or AM) for the era should properly \"precede\" the date rather than follow it. \nThe reference junction of the Sun and the Moon (Molad 1) is considered to be at 5 hours and 204 halakim, or 11:11:20\u00a0p.m., on the evening of Sunday, 6 October 3761 BCE. According to rabbinic reckoning, this moment was \"not\" Creation, but about one year \"before\" Creation, with the new moon of its first month (Tishrei) called \"molad tohu\" (the mean new moon of chaos or nothing). It is about one year \"before\" the traditional Jewish date of Creation on 25 Elul AM 1, based upon the \"Seder Olam Rabbah\". Thus, adding 3760 before Rosh Hashanah or 3761 after to a Julian calendar year number starting from 1 CE will yield the Hebrew year. For earlier years there may be a discrepancy; \"see Missing years (Jewish calendar)\".\nIn Hebrew there are two common ways of writing the year number: with the thousands, called (\"major era\"), and without the thousands, called (\"minor era\"). Thus, the current year is written as ' \u200e() using the \"major era\" and ' \u200e() using the \"minor era\".\nCycles of years.\nSince the Jewish calendar has been fixed, leap months have been added according to the Metonic cycle of 19 years, of which 12 are common (non-leap) years of 12 months, and 7 are leap years of 13 months. This 19-year cycle is known in Hebrew as the \"Machzor Katan\" (\"small cycle\").\nBecause the Julian years are &lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;365+1\u20444 days long, every 28 years the weekday pattern repeats. This is called the sun cycle, or the \"Machzor Gadol\" (\"great cycle\") in Hebrew. The beginning of this cycle is arbitrary. Its main use is for determining the time of Birkat Hachama.\nBecause every 50 years is a Jubilee year, there is a jubilee (\"yovel\") cycle. Because every seven years is a sabbatical year, there is a seven-year release cycle. The placement of these cycles is debated. Historically, there is enough evidence to fix the sabbatical years in the Second Temple Period. But it may not match with the sabbatical cycle derived from the biblical period; and there is no consensus on whether the Jubilee year is the fiftieth year or the latter half of the forty ninth year.\nEvery 247 years, or 13 cycles of 19 years, form a period known as an \"iggul\", or the \"Iggul of Rabbi Nahshon\". This period is notable in that the precise details of the calendar almost always (but not always) repeat over this period. This occurs because the \"molad\" interval (the average length of a Hebrew month) is 29.530594 days, which over 247 years results in a total of 90215.965 days. This is almost exactly 90216 days \u2013 a whole number and multiple of 7 (equalling the days of the week). So over 247 years, not only does the 19-year leap year cycle repeat itself, but the days of the week (and thus the days of Rosh Hashanah and the year length) typically repeat themselves.\nCalculations.\nLeap year calculations.\nTo determine whether a Jewish year is a leap year, one must find its position in the 19-year Metonic cycle. This position is calculated by dividing the Jewish year number by 19 and finding the remainder. (Since there is no year 0, a remainder of 0 indicates that the year is year 19 of the cycle.) For example, the Jewish year divided by 19 results in a remainder of , indicating that it is year of the Metonic cycle. The Jewish year used is the \"anno mundi\" year, in which the year of creation according to the Rabbinical Chronology (3761 BCE) is taken as year 1. Years 3, 6, 8, 11, 14, 17, and 19 of the Metonic cycle are leap years. The Hebrew mnemonic GUCHADZaT refers to these years, while another memory aid refers to musical notation.\nWhether a year is a leap year can also be determined by a simple calculation (which also gives the fraction of a month by which the calendar is behind the seasons, useful for agricultural purposes). To determine whether year \"n\" of the calendar is a leap year, find the remainder on dividing [(7\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0\"n\")\u00a0+\u00a01] by 19. If the remainder is 6 or less it is a leap year; if it is 7 or more it is not. For example, the remainder on dividing [(7\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0)\u00a0+\u00a01] by 19 is , so the year is a leap year. The remainder on dividing [(7\u00a0\u00d7\u00a01)\u00a0+\u00a01] by 19 is 8, so the year 1 is a leap year. This works because as there are seven leap years in nineteen years the difference between the solar and lunar years increases by &lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;7\u204419 month per year. When the difference goes above &lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;18\u204419 month this signifies a leap year, and the difference is reduced by one month.\nThe Hebrew calendar assumes that a month is uniformly of the length of an average synodic month, taken as exactly &lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;29+13753\u204425920 days (about 29.530594 days, which is less than half a second from the modern scientific estimate); it also assumes that a tropical year is exactly &lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;12+7\u204419 times that, i.e., about 365.2468 days. Thus it overestimates the length of the tropical year (365.2422 days) by 0.0046 days (about 7 minutes) per year, or about one day in 216 years. This error is less than the Julian years (365.2500 days) make (0.0078 days/year, or one day in 128 years), but much more than what the Gregorian years (365.2425 days/year) make (0.0003 days/year, or one day in 3333 years).\nRosh Hashanah postponement rules.\nBesides the adding of leap months, the year length is sometimes adjusted by adding one day to the month of Marcheshvan, or removing one day from the month of Kislev. Because each calendar year begins with Rosh Hashanah, adjusting the year length is equivalent to moving the day of the next Rosh Hashanah. Several rules are used to determine when this is performed.\nTo calculate the day on which Rosh Hashanah of a given year will fall, the expected molad (moment of lunar conjunction or new moon) of Tishrei in that year is calculated. The molad is calculated by multiplying the number of months that will have elapsed since some (preceding) molad (whose weekday is known) by the mean length of a (synodic) lunar month, which is 29 days, 12 hours, and 793 parts (there are 1080 \"parts\" in an hour, so that one part is equal to &lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;3+1\u20443 seconds). The very first molad, the molad tohu, fell on Sunday evening at 11:11:20\u00a0pm in the local time of Jerusalem, 6 October 3761 BCE (Proleptic Julian calendar) 20:50:23.1 UTC, or in Jewish terms Day 2, 5 hours, and 204 parts. The exact time of a molad in terms of days after midnight between 29 and 30 December 1899 (the form used by many spreadsheets for date and time) is\n-2067022+(23+34/3/60)/24+(29.5+793/1080/24)*\"N\"\nwhere \"N\" is the number of lunar months since the beginning. (\"N\" \n 71440 for the beginning of the 305th Machzor Katan on 1 October 2016.) Adding 0.25 to this converts it to the Jewish system in which the day begins at 6\u00a0pm.\nIn calculating the number of months that will have passed since the known molad that one uses as the starting point, one must remember to include any leap months that falls within the elapsed interval, according to the cycle of leap years. A 19-year cycle of 235 synodic months has 991 weeks 2 days 16 hours 595 parts, a common year of 12 synodic months has 50 weeks 4 days 8 hours 876 parts, while a leap year of 13 synodic months has 54 weeks 5 days 21 hours 589 parts.\nFour conditions are considered to determine whether the date of Rosh Hashanah must be postponed. These are called the Rosh Hashanah postponement rules, or . The two most important conditions are:\nThis rule is applied for religious reasons, so that Yom Kippur does not fall on a Friday or Sunday, and Hoshana Rabbah does not fall on Shabbat. Since Shabbat restrictions also apply to Yom Kippur, if either day falls immediately before the other, it would not be possible to make necessary preparations for the second day (such as candle lighting). Additionally, the laws of Shabbat override those of Hoshana Rabbah, so that if Hoshana Rabbah were to fall on Shabbat, the Hoshana Rabbah \"aravah\" ritual could not be performed.\nThus Rosh Hashanah can only fall on Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday. The \"kevi'ah\" uses the letters \u05d4 ,\u05d2 ,\u05d1 and \u05d6 (representing 2, 3, 5, and 7, for Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday) to denote the starting day of Rosh Hashana and the year.\nAnother two rules are applied much less frequently and serve to prevent impermissible year lengths. Their names are Hebrew acronyms that refer to the ways they are calculated:\nDeficient, regular, and complete years.\nThe rules of postponement of Rosh HaShanah make it that a Jewish common year will have 353, 354, or 355 days while a leap year (with the addition of Adar I which always has 30 days) has 383, 384, or 385 days.\nWhether a year is deficient, regular, or complete is determined by the time between two adjacent Rosh Hashanah observances and the leap year.\nA Metonic cycle equates to 235 lunar months in each 19-year cycle. This gives an average of 6,939 days, 16 hours, and 595 parts for each cycle. But due to the Rosh Hashanah postponement rules (preceding section) a cycle of 19 Jewish years can be either 6,939, 6,940, 6,941, or 6,942 days in duration. For any given year in the Metonic cycle, the molad moves forward in the week by 2 days, 16 hours, and 595 parts every 19 years. The greatest common divisor of this and a week is 5 parts, so the Jewish calendar repeats exactly following a number of Metonic cycles equal to the number of parts in a week divided by 5, namely 7\u00d724\u00d7216\u00a0=\u00a036,288 Metonic cycles, or 689,472 Jewish years. There is a near-repetition every 247 years, except for an excess of 50 minutes &lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;16+2\u20443 seconds (905 parts).\nContrary to popular impression, one's Hebrew birthday does not necessarily fall on the same Gregorian date every 19 years, since the length of the Metonic cycle varies by several days (as does the length of a 19-year Gregorian period, depending whether it contains 4 or 5 leap years).\nKeviah.\nThere are three qualities that distinguish one year from another: whether it is a leap year or a common year; on which of four permissible days of the week the year begins; and whether it is a deficient, regular, or complete year. Mathematically, there are 24 (2\u00d74\u00d73) possible combinations, but only 14 of them are valid.\nEach of these patterns is known by a ( for 'a setting' or 'an established thing'), which is a code consisting of two numbers and a letter. In English, the code consists of the following:\nThe in Hebrew letters is written right-to-left, so their days of the week are reversed, the right number for 1 Tishrei and the left for 15 Nisan.\nThe \"kevi'ah\" also determines the Torah reading cycle (which \"parshiyot\" are read together or separately.\nThe four gates.\nThe \"keviah\", and thus the annual calendar, of a numbered Hebrew year can be determined by consulting the table of Four Gates, whose inputs are the year's position in the 19-year cycle and its molad Tishrei. In this table, the years of a 19-year cycle are organized into four groups (called \"gates\"): common years after a leap year but before a common year (1 4 9 12 15); common years between two leap years (7 18); common years after a common year but before a leap year (2 5 10 13 16); and leap years (3 6 8 11 14 17 19).\nThis table numbers the days of the week and hours for the limits of molad Tishrei in the Hebrew manner for calendrical calculations, that is, both begin at 6 pm, thus 7d 18h 0p is noon Saturday, with the week starting on 1d 0h 0p (Saturday 6pm, i.e. the beginning of Sunday reckoned in the Hebrew manner). The oldest surviving table of Four Gates was written by Muhammad ibn Musa al-Khwarizmi in 824.\nIncidence.\nComparing the days of the week of molad Tishrei with those in the shows that during 39% of years 1 Tishrei is not postponed beyond the day of the week of its molad Tishrei, 47% are postponed one day, and 14% are postponed two days. This table also identifies the seven types of common years and seven types of leap years. Most are represented in any 19-year cycle, except one or two may be in neighboring cycles. The most likely type of year is 5R7 in 18.1% of years, whereas the least likely is 5C1 in 3.3% of years. The day of the week of 15 Nisan is later than that of 1 Tishrei by one, two or three days for common years and three, four or five days for leap years in deficient, regular or complete years, respectively.\nWorked example.\nGiven the length of the year, the length of each month is fixed as described above, so the real problem in determining the calendar for a year is determining the number of days in the year. In the modern calendar, this is determined in the following manner.\nThe day of Rosh Hashanah and the length of the year are determined by the time and the day of the week of the Tishrei \"molad\", that is, the moment of the average conjunction. Given the Tishrei \"molad\" of a certain year, the length of the year is determined as follows:\nFirst, one must determine whether each year is an ordinary or leap year by its position in the 19-year Metonic cycle. Years 3, 6, 8, 11, 14, 17, and 19 are leap years.\nSecondly, one must determine the number of days between the starting Tishrei \"molad\" (TM1) and the Tishrei \"molad\" of the next year (TM2). For calendar descriptions in general the day begins at 6\u00a0pm, but for the purpose of determining Rosh Hashanah, a \"molad\" occurring on or after noon is treated as belonging to the next day (the first \"de\u1e25iyyah\"). All months are calculated as 29d, 12h, 44m, &lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;3+1\u20443s long (MonLen). Therefore, in an ordinary year TM2 occurs 12 \u00d7 MonLen days after TM1. This is usually 354 calendar days after TM1, but if TM1 is on or after 3:11:20\u00a0am and before noon, it will be 355 days. Similarly, in a leap year, TM2 occurs 13 \u00d7 MonLen days after TM1. This is usually 384 days after TM1, but if TM1 is on or after noon and before &lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;2:27:16+2\u20443\u00a0pm, TM2 will be only 383 days after TM1. In the same way, from TM2 one calculates TM3. Thus the four natural year lengths are 354, 355, 383, and 384 days.\nHowever, because of the holiday rules, Rosh Hashanah cannot fall on a Sunday, Wednesday, or Friday, so if TM2 is one of those days, Rosh Hashanah in year 2 is postponed by adding one day to year 1 (the second \"de\u1e25iyyah\"). To compensate, one day is subtracted from year 2. It is to allow for these adjustments that the system allows 385-day years (long leap) and 353-day years (short ordinary) besides the four natural year lengths.\nBut how can year 1 be lengthened if it is already a long ordinary year of 355 days or year 2 be shortened if it is a short leap year of 383 days? That is why the third and fourth \"de\u1e25iyyah\"s are needed.\nIf year 1 is already a long ordinary year of 355 days, there will be a problem if TM1 is on a Tuesday, as that means TM2 falls on a Sunday and will have to be postponed, creating a 356-day year. In this case, Rosh Hashanah in year 1 is postponed from Tuesday (the third \"de\u1e25iyyah\"). As it cannot be postponed to Wednesday, it is postponed to Thursday, and year 1 ends up with 354 days.\nOn the other hand, if year 2 is already a short year of 383 days, there will be a problem if TM2 is on a Wednesday. because Rosh Hashanah in year 2 will have to be postponed from Wednesday to Thursday and this will cause year 2 to be only 382 days long. In this case, year 2 is extended by one day by postponing Rosh Hashanah in year 3 from Monday to Tuesday (the fourth \"de\u1e25iyyah\"), and year 2 will have 383 days.\nHolidays.\nFor calculated dates of Jewish holidays, see Jewish and Israeli holidays 2000\u20132050.\nAccuracy.\nMolad interval.\nA \"new moon\" (astronomically called a lunar conjunction and, in Hebrew, a molad) is the moment at which the sun and moon have the same ecliptic longitude (i.e. they are aligned horizontally with respect to a north\u2013south line). The period between two new moons is a synodic month. The actual length of a synodic month varies from about 29 days 6 hours and 30 minutes (29.27 days) to about 29 days and 20 hours (29.83 days), a variation range of about 13 hours and 30 minutes. Accordingly, for convenience, the Hebrew calendar uses a long-term average month length, known as the molad interval, which equals the mean synodic month of ancient times. The molad interval is 29 days, 12 hours, and 793 \"parts\" (1 \"part\" = 1/18 minute = 31/3 seconds) (i.e., 29.530594 days), and is the same value determined by the Babylonians in their System B about 300 BCE and was adopted by Hipparchus (2nd century BCE) and by Ptolemy in the \"Almagest\" (2nd century CE). Its remarkable accuracy (less than one second from the current true value) is thought to have been achieved using records of lunar eclipses from the 8th to 5th centuries BCE. In the Talmudic era, when the mean synodic month was slightly shorter than at present, the molad interval was even more accurate, being \"essentially a perfect fit\" for the mean synodic month at the time.\nCurrently, the accumulated drift in the moladot since the Talmudic era has reached a total of approximately 97 minutes. This means that the molad of Tishrei lands one day later than it ought to in (97 minutes) \u00f7 (1440 minutes per day) = nearly 7% of years. Therefore, the seemingly small drift of the moladot is already significant enough to affect the date of Rosh Hashanah, which then cascades to many other dates in the calendar year, and sometimes (due to the Rosh Hashanah postponement rules) also interacts with the dates of the prior or next year.\nThe rate of calendar drift is increasing with time, since the mean synodic month is progressively shortening due to gravitational tidal effects. Measured on a strictly uniform time scale (such as that provided by an atomic clock) the mean synodic month is becoming gradually longer, but since the tides slow Earth's rotation rate even more, the mean synodic month is becoming gradually shorter in terms of mean solar time.\nMetonic cycle drift.\nA larger source of error is the inaccuracy of the Metonic cycle. Nineteen Jewish years average 6939d 16h 33m 03&lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;1\u20443s, compared to the 6939d 14h 26m 15s of nineteen mean solar years. Thus, the Hebrew calendar drifts by just over 2 hours every 19 years, or approximately one day every 216 years. Due to accumulation of this discrepancy, the earliest date on which Passover can fall has drifted by roughly eight days since the 4th century, and the 15th of Nisan now falls only on or after 26 March (the date in 2013), five days after the actual equinox on 21 March. In the distant future, this drift is projected to move Passover much further in the year. If the calendar is not amended, then Passover will start to land on or after the summer solstice around approximately AM 16652 (12892 CE).\nImplications for Jewish ritual.\nWhen the calendar was fixed in the 4th century, the earliest Passover (in year 16 of the Metonic cycle) began on the first full moon after the March equinox. This is still the case in about 80% of years; but, in about 20% of years, Passover is a month late by this criterion. Presently, this occurs after the \"premature\" insertion of a leap month in years 8, 11, and 19 of each 19-year cycle, which causes Passover to fall especially far after the March equinox in such years. Calendar drift also impacts the observance of Sukkot, which will shift into Israel's winter rainy season, making dwelling in the sukkah less practical. It also affects the logic of the Shemini Atzeret prayer for rain, which will be more often recited once rains are already underway.\nModern scholars have debated at which point the drift could become ritually problematic, and proposed adjustments to the fixed calendar to keep Passover in its proper season. The seriousness of the calendar drift is discounted by many, on the grounds that Passover will remain in the spring season for many millennia, and the Torah is generally not interpreted as having specified tight calendrical limits. However, some writers and researchers have proposed \"corrected\" calendars (with modifications to the leap year cycle, molad interval, or both) which would compensate for these issues:\n 365.2422 days, very close to the actual tropical year. The result is the \"Hebrew Calendar\" in the program CalMaster2000.\nReligious questions abound about how such a system might be implemented and administered throughout the diverse aspects of the world Jewish community.\nUsage.\nIn Auschwitz.\nWhile imprisoned in Auschwitz, Jews made every effort to preserve Jewish tradition in the camps, despite the monumental dangers in doing so. The Hebrew calendar, which is a tradition with great importance to Jewish practice and rituals was particularly dangerous since no tools of telling of time, such as watches and calendars, were permitted in the camps. The keeping of a Hebrew calendar was a rarity amongst prisoners and there are only two known surviving calendars that were made in Auschwitz, both of which were made by women. Before this, the tradition of making a Hebrew calendar was greatly assumed to be the job of a man in Jewish society.\nIn contemporary Israel.\nEarly Zionist pioneers were impressed by the fact that the calendar preserved by Jews over many centuries in far-flung diasporas, as a matter of religious ritual, was geared to the climate of their original country: major Jewish holidays such as Sukkot, Passover, and Shavuot correspond to major points of the country's agricultural year such as planting and harvest. Accordingly, in the early 20th century the Hebrew calendar was re-interpreted as an agricultural rather than religious calendar.\nAfter the creation of the State of Israel, the Hebrew calendar became one of the official calendars of Israel, along with the Gregorian calendar. Holidays and commemorations not derived from previous Jewish tradition were to be fixed according to the Hebrew calendar date. For example, the Israeli Independence Day falls on 5 Iyar, Jerusalem Reunification Day on 28 Iyar, Yom HaAliyah on 10 Nisan, and the Holocaust Commemoration Day on 27 Nisan.\nThe Hebrew calendar is still widely acknowledged, appearing in public venues such as banks (where it is legal for use on cheques and other documents), and on the mastheads of newspapers.\nThe Jewish New Year (Rosh Hashanah) is a two-day public holiday in Israel. However, since the 1980s an increasing number of secular Israelis celebrate the Gregorian New Year (usually known as \"Silvester Night\"\u2014) on the night between 31 December and 1 January. Prominent rabbis have on several occasions sharply denounced this practice, but with no noticeable effect on the secularist celebrants.\nWall calendars commonly used in Israel are hybrids. Most are organised according to Gregorian rather than Jewish months, but begin in September, when the Jewish New Year usually falls, and provide the Jewish date in small characters.\nHistory.\nEarly formation.\nLunisolar calendars similar to the Hebrew calendar, consisting of twelve lunar months plus an occasional 13th intercalary month to synchronize with the solar/agricultural cycle, were used in all ancient Middle Eastern civilizations except Egypt, and likely date to the 3rd millennium BCE. While there is no mention of this 13th month anywhere in the Hebrew Bible, most Biblical scholars hold that the intercalation process was almost certainly a regularly occurring aspect of the early Hebrew calendar keeping process.\nMonth names.\nBiblical references to the pre-exilic calendar include ten of the twelve months identified by number rather than by name.\nPrior to the Babylonian captivity, the names of only four months are referred to in the Tanakh: \"Aviv\" (first month), \"Ziv\" (second month), \"Ethanim\" (seventh month), and \"Bul\" (eighth month). All of these are believed to be Canaanite names. The last three of these names are only mentioned in connection with the building of the First Temple and H\u00e5kan Ulfgard suggests that the use of what are rarely used Canaanite (or in the case of Ethanim perhaps Northwest Semitic) names indicates that \"the author is consciously utilizing an archaizing terminology, thus giving the impression of an ancient story...\". Alternatively, these names may be attributed to the presence of Phoenician scribes in Solomon's court at the time of the building of the Temple.\nDuring the Babylonian captivity, the Jewish people adopted the Babylonian names for the months. The Babylonian calendar descended directly from the Sumerian calendar. These Babylonian month-names (such as Nisan, Iyyar, Tammuz, Ab, Elul, Tishri and Adar) are shared with the modern Levantine solar calendar (currently used in the Arabic-speaking countries of the Fertile Crescent) and the modern Assyrian calendar, indicating a common origin. The origin is thought to be the Babylonian calendar.\nPast methods of dividing years.\nAccording to some Christian and Karaite sources, the tradition in ancient Israel was that 1 Nisan would not start until the barley is ripe, being the test for the onset of spring. If the barley was not ripe, an intercalary month would be added before Nisan.\nIn the 1st century, Josephus stated that while \u2013\nMoses...appointed Nisan...as the first month for the festivals...the commencement of the year for everything relating to divine worship, but for selling and buying and other ordinary affairs he preserved the ancient order [i. e. the year beginning with Tishrei].\"\nEdwin Thiele concluded that the ancient northern Kingdom of Israel counted years using the ecclesiastical new year starting on 1 Aviv/Nisan (Nisan-years), while the southern Kingdom of Judah counted years using the civil new year starting on 1 Tishrei (Tishri-years). The practice of the Kingdom of Israel was also that of Babylon, as well as other countries of the region. The practice of Judah is continued in modern Judaism and is celebrated as Rosh Hashana.\nPast methods of numbering years.\nBefore the adoption of the current year numbering system, other systems were used. In early times, the years were counted from some significant event such as the Exodus. During the period of the monarchy, it was the widespread practice in western Asia to use era year numbers according to the accession year of the monarch of the country involved. This practice was followed by the united kingdom of Israel, kingdom of Judah, kingdom of Israel, Persia, and others. Besides, the author of Kings coordinated dates in the two kingdoms by giving the accession year of a monarch in terms of the year of the monarch of the other kingdom, though some commentators note that these dates do not always synchronise. Other era dating systems have been used at other times. For example, Jewish communities in the Babylonian diaspora counted the years from the first deportation from Israel, that of Jehoiachin in 597 BCE. The era year was then called \"year of the captivity of Jehoiachin\".\nDuring the Hellenistic Maccabean period, Seleucid era counting was used, at least in the Land of Israel (under Greek influence at the time). The Books of the Maccabees used Seleucid era dating exclusively, as did Josephus writing in the Roman period. From the 1st to 10th centuries, the center of world Judaism was in the Middle East (primarily Iraq and Palestine), and Jews in these regions also used Seleucid era dating, which they called the \"Era of Contracts [or Documents]\"; this counting is still sometimes used by Yemenite Jews. The Talmud states:\nRav Aha bar Jacob then put this question: How do we know that our Era [of Documents] is connected with the Kingdom of Greece at all? Why not say that it is reckoned from the Exodus from Egypt, omitting the first thousand years and giving the years of the next thousand? In that case, the document is really post-dated!Said Rav Nahman: In the Diaspora the Greek Era alone is used.He [Rav Aha] thought that Rav Nahman wanted to dispose of him anyhow, but when he went and studied it thoroughly he found that it is indeed taught [in a Baraita]: In the Diaspora the Greek Era alone is used.\nIn the 8th and 9th centuries, as the center of Jewish life moved from Babylonia to Europe, counting using the Seleucid era \"became meaningless\", and thus was replaced by the system. The use of the Seleucid era continued till the 16th century in the East, and was employed even in the 19th century among Yemenite Jews.\nOccasionally in Talmudic writings, reference was made to other starting points for eras, such as destruction era dating, being the number of years since the 70 CE destruction of the Second Temple.\nLeap months.\nAccording to Rabbinic Judaism, requires that the months be determined by a proper court with the necessary authority to sanctify the months. Hence the court, not the astronomy, has the final decision. When the observational form of the calendar was in use, whether a leap month was added depended on three factors: 'aviv [i.e., the ripeness of barley], fruits of trees, and the equinox. On two of these grounds it should be intercalated, but not on one of them alone. It may be noted that in the Bible the name of the first month, \"Aviv\", literally means \"spring\". Thus, if Adar was over and spring had not yet arrived, an additional month was observed.\nDetermining the new month in the Mishnaic period.\nThe Tanakh contains several commandments related to the keeping of the calendar and the lunar cycle, and records changes that have taken place to the Hebrew calendar. Numbers 10:10 stresses the importance in Israelite religious observance of the new month (Hebrew: , Rosh Chodesh, \"beginning of the month\"): \"... in your new moons, ye shall blow with the trumpets over your burnt-offerings...\" Similarly in Numbers 28:11. \"The beginning of the month\" meant the appearance of a new moon, and in Exodus 12:2. \"This month is to you\".\nAccording to the \"Mishnah\" and Tosefta, in the Maccabean, Herodian, and Mishnaic periods, new months were determined by the sighting of a new crescent, with two eyewitnesses required to testify to the Sanhedrin to having seen the new lunar crescent at sunset. The practice in the time of Gamaliel II (c. 100 CE) was for witnesses to select the appearance of the moon from a collection of drawings that depicted the crescent in a variety of orientations, only a few of which could be valid in any given month. These observations were compared against calculations.\nAt first the beginning of each Jewish month was signaled to the communities of Israel and beyond by fires lit on mountaintops, but after the Samaritans began to light false fires, messengers were sent. The inability of the messengers to reach communities outside Israel before mid-month High Holy Days (Succot and Passover) led outlying communities to celebrate scriptural festivals for two days rather than one, observing the second feast-day of the Jewish diaspora because of uncertainty of whether the previous month ended after 29 or 30 days.\nHistoricity.\nIt has been noted that the procedures described in the Mishnah and Tosefta are all plausible procedures for regulating an empirical lunar calendar. Fire-signals, for example, or smoke-signals, are known from the pre-exilic Lachish ostraca. Furthermore, the Mishnah contains laws that reflect the uncertainties of an empirical calendar. Mishnah Sanhedrin, for example, holds that when one witness holds that an event took place on a certain day of the month, and another that the same event took place on the following day, their testimony can be held to agree, since the length of the preceding month was uncertain. Another Mishnah takes it for granted that it cannot be known in advance whether a year's lease is for twelve or thirteen months. Hence it is a reasonable conclusion that the Mishnaic calendar was actually used in the Mishnaic period.\nThe accuracy of the Mishnah's claim that the Mishnaic calendar was also used in the late Second Temple period is less certain. One scholar has noted that there are no laws from Second Temple period sources that indicate any doubts about the length of a month or of a year. This led him to propose that the priests must have had some form of computed calendar or calendrical rules that allowed them to know in advance whether a month would have 30 or 29 days, and whether a year would have 12 or 13 months.\nThe fixing of the calendar.\nBetween 70 and 1178 CE, the observation-based calendar was gradually replaced by a mathematically calculated one.\nThe Talmuds indicate at least the beginnings of a transition from a purely empirical to a computed calendar. Samuel of Nehardea (c. 165\u2013254) stated that he could determine the dates of the holidays by calculation rather than observation. According to a statement attributed to Yose (late 3rd century), Purim could not fall on a Sabbath nor a Monday, lest Yom Kippur fall on a Friday or a Sunday. This indicates that, by the time of the redaction of the Jerusalem Talmud (c. 400 CE), there were a fixed number of days in all months from Adar to Elul, also implying that the extra month was already a second Adar added before the regular Adar. Elsewhere, Shimon ben Pazi is reported to have counseled \"those who make the computations\" not to set Rosh Hashana or Hoshana Rabbah on Shabbat. This indicates that there was a group who \"made computations\" and controlled, to some extent, the day of the week on which Rosh Hashana would fall.\nThere is a tradition, first mentioned by Hai Gaon (died 1038 CE), that Hillel II was responsible for the new calculated calendar with a fixed intercalation cycle \"in the year 670 of the Seleucid era\" (i.e., 358\u2013359 CE). Later writers, such as Nachmanides, explained Hai Gaon's words to mean that the entire computed calendar was due to Hillel II in response to persecution of Jews. Maimonides (12th century) stated that the Mishnaic calendar was used \"until the days of Abaye and Rava\" (c. 320\u2013350 CE), and that the change came when \"the land of Israel was destroyed, and no permanent court was left.\" Taken together, these two traditions suggest that Hillel II (whom they identify with the mid-4th-century Jewish patriarch Ioulos, attested in a letter of the Emperor Julian, and the Jewish patriarch Ellel, mentioned by Epiphanius) instituted the computed Hebrew calendar because of persecution. H. Graetz linked the introduction of the computed calendar to a sharp repression following a failed Jewish insurrection that occurred during the rule of the Christian emperor Constantius and Gallus. Saul Lieberman argued instead that the introduction of the fixed calendar was due to measures taken by Christian Roman authorities to prevent the Jewish patriarch from sending calendrical messengers.\nBoth the tradition that Hillel II instituted the complete computed calendar, and the theory that the computed calendar was introduced due to repression or persecution, have been questioned. Furthermore, two Jewish dates during post-Talmudic times (specifically in 506 and 776) are impossible under the rules of the modern calendar, indicating that some of its arithmetic rules were established in Babylonia during the times of the Geonim (7th to 8th centuries). Most likely, the procedure established in 359 involved a fixed molad interval slightly different from the current one, Rosh Hashana postponement rules similar but not identical to current rules, and leap months were added based on when Passover preceded a fixed cutoff date rather than through a repeated 19-year cycle. The Rosh Hashana rules apparently reached their modern form between 629 and 648, the modern molad interval was likely fixed in 776, while the fixed 19-year cycle also likely dates to the late 8th century.\nExcept for the epoch year number (the fixed reference point at the beginning of year 1, which at that time was one year later than the epoch of the modern calendar), the calendar rules reached their current form by the beginning of the 9th century, as described by the Persian Muslim astronomer Muhammad ibn Musa al-Khwarizmi in 823. Al-Khwarizmi's study of the Jewish calendar describes the 19-year intercalation cycle, the rules for determining on what day of the week the first day of the month Tishrei shall fall, the interval between the Jewish era (creation of Adam) and the Seleucid era, and the rules for determining the mean longitude of the sun and the moon using the Jewish calendar. Not all the rules were in place by 835.\nIn 921, Aaron ben Me\u00efr had a debate with Saadya Gaon about one of the rules of the calendar. This indicates that the rules of the modern calendar were not so clear and set. In 1000, the Muslim chronologist al-Biruni described all of the modern rules of the Hebrew calendar, except that he specified three different epochs used by various Jewish communities being one, two, or three years later than the modern epoch.\nIn 1178, Maimonides included all the rules for the calculated calendar and their scriptural basis, including the modern epochal year, in his work \"Mishneh Torah\". He wrote that he had chosen the epoch from which calculations of all dates should be as \"the third day of Nisan in this present year ... which is the year 4938 of the creation of the world\" (22 March 1178). Today, these rules are generally used by Jewish communities throughout the world.\nOther calendars.\nOutside of Rabbinic Judaism, evidence shows a diversity of practice.\nKaraite calendar.\nKaraites use the lunar month and the solar year, but the Karaite calendar differs from the current Rabbinic calendar in a number of ways. The Karaite calendar is identical to the Rabbinic calendar used before the Sanhedrin changed the Rabbinic calendar from the lunar, observation based, calendar to the current, mathematically based, calendar used in Rabbinic Judaism today.\nIn the lunar Karaite calendar, the beginning of each month, the Rosh Chodesh, can be calculated, but is confirmed by the observation in Israel of the first sightings of the new moon. This may result in an occasional variation of a maximum of one day, depending on the inability to observe the new moon. The day is usually \"picked up\" in the next month.\nThe addition of the leap month (Adar II) is determined by observing in Israel the ripening of barley at a specific stage (defined by Karaite tradition) (called aviv), rather than using the calculated and fixed calendar of rabbinic Judaism. Occasionally this results in Karaites being one month ahead of other Jews using the calculated rabbinic calendar. The \"lost\" month would be \"picked up\" in the next cycle when Karaites would observe a leap month while other Jews would not.\nFurthermore, the seasonal drift of the rabbinic calendar is avoided, resulting in the years affected by the drift starting one month earlier in the Karaite calendar.\nAlso, the four rules of postponement of the rabbinic calendar are not applied, since they are not mentioned in the Tanakh. This can affect the dates observed for all the Jewish holidays in a particular year by one or two days.\nIn the Middle Ages many Karaite Jews outside Israel followed the calculated rabbinic calendar, because it was not possible to retrieve accurate aviv barley data from the land of Israel. However, since the establishment of the State of Israel, and especially since the Six-Day War, the Karaite Jews that have made \"aliyah\" can now again use the observational calendar.\nSamaritan calendar.\nThe Samaritan community's calendar also relies on lunar months and solar years. Calculation of the Samaritan calendar has historically been a secret reserved to the priestly family alone, and was based on observations of the new crescent moon. More recently, a 20th-century Samaritan High Priest transferred the calculation to a computer algorithm. The current High Priest confirms the results twice a year, and then distributes calendars to the community.\nThe epoch of the Samaritan calendar is year of the entry of the Children of Israel into the Land of Israel with Joshua. The month of Passover is the first month in the Samaritan calendar, but the year number increments in the sixth month. Like in the Rabbinic calendar, there are seven leap years within each 19-year cycle. However, the Rabbinic and Samaritan calendars' cycles are not synchronized, so Samaritan festivals\u2014notionally the same as the Rabbinic festivals of Torah origin\u2014are frequently one month off from the date according to the Rabbinic calendar. Additionally, as in the Karaite calendar, the Samaritan calendar does not apply the four rules of postponement, since they are not mentioned in the Tanakh. This can affect the dates observed for all the Jewish holidays in a particular year by one or two days.\nThe Qumran calendar.\nMany of the Dead Sea Scrolls have references to a unique calendar, used by the people there, who are often assumed to have been Essenes. The year of this calendar used the ideal Mesopotamian calendar of twelve 30-day months, to which were added 4 days at the equinoxes and solstices (cardinal points), making a total of 364 days.\nWith only 364 days, the calendar would be very noticeably different from the actual seasons after a few years, but there is nothing to indicate what was done about this problem. Various scholars have suggested that nothing was done and the calendar was allowed to change with respect to the seasons, or that changes were made irregularly when the seasonal anomaly was too great to be ignored any longer.\nOther calendars used by ancient Jews.\nCalendrical evidence for the postexilic Persian period is found in papyri from the Jewish colony at Elephantine, in Egypt. These documents show that the Jewish community of Elephantine used the Egyptian and Babylonian calendars.\nThe Sardica paschal table shows that the Jewish community of some eastern city, possibly Antioch, used a calendrical scheme that kept Nisan 14 within the limits of the Julian month of March. Some of the dates in the document are clearly corrupt, but they can be emended to make the sixteen years in the table consistent with a regular intercalation scheme. Peter, the bishop of Alexandria (early 4th century CE), mentions that the Jews of his city \"hold their Passover according to the course of the moon in the month of Phamenoth, or according to the intercalary month every third year in the month of Pharmuthi\", suggesting a fairly consistent intercalation scheme that kept Nisan 14 approximately between Phamenoth 10 (6 March in the 4th century CE) and Pharmuthi 10 (5 April).\nJewish funerary inscriptions from Zoar (south of the Dead Sea), dated from the 3rd to the 5th century, indicate that when years were intercalated, the intercalary month was at least sometimes a repeated month of Adar. The inscriptions, however, reveal no clear pattern of regular intercalations, nor do they indicate any consistent rule for determining the start of the lunar month.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "13786", "revid": "7903804", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=13786", "title": "The Holocaust Industry", "text": "2000 book by Norman Finkelstein\nThe Holocaust Industry: Reflections on the Exploitation of Jewish Suffering is a book by Norman Finkelstein arguing that the American Jewish establishment exploits the memory of the Nazi Holocaust for political and financial gain and to further Israeli interests. According to Finkelstein, this \"Holocaust industry\" has corrupted Jewish culture and the authentic memory of the Holocaust.\nThe book was controversial, attracting both praise as well as criticism. Supporters of the book, such as preeminent Holocaust scholar Raul Hilberg, described it as a substantive engagement with issues such as the politics of memory. On the other hand, critics of the book argued that it reused and empowered antisemitic tropes and was written in a style that was harsh and not respectful enough considering the delicate subject.\nConception.\nThe book began as a journal review of \"The Holocaust in American Life\", by Peter Novick.\nSynopsis.\nThe Holocaust industry.\nFinkelstein follows the Holocaust's standing in American life from the postwar years to the end of the 20th century. Before the 1967 Arab\u2013Israeli War, he argues, the Holocaust took little part in the lives of American Gentiles and Jews. There was, for example, at that time only a small number of books and films on the Holocaust and few works of scholarship. Not until the late 20th century, especially after the 1967 War, did the Holocaust take up its role as the foremost historical event in the American mind \u2013 so Finkelstein argues.\nFinkelstein views this growing American fixation with the Holocaust through a materialist lens. After World War II, he claims, the leaders of American Jewish organizations (like the Anti-Defamation League and the American Jewish Committee) understood assimilation and access to elite power to be in their own interest. Thus these organizations distanced themselves from Israel, moderated their demands for German denazification, and collaborated with McCarthyite investigations. In the 1960s, however, the American government began a friendlier relationship with the Israeli government; and the interests of American Jewish leaders changed. Their organizations began openly to support Israel and espouse a Holocaust ideology that emphasized (1) the Holocaust as a unique historical event and (2) the Holocaust as the climax of an eternal anti-Semitism. Finkelstein argues that this Holocaust ideology does not fit with academic Holocaust scholarship. Rather it serves to defend Israel and American Jewish leaders from criticism.\nFraudulent memoirs.\nMany popular Holocaust books by contemporary writers have, in Finkelstein's view, little scholarly merit. He faults Deborah Lipstadt's 1993 book \"Denying the Holocaust\" for expanding the definition of Holocaust denial to include questioning its uniqueness. He writes that Daniel Goldhagen, in his 1996 book \"Hitler\u2019s Willing Executioners\", inaccurately characterizes the entire German people as eager Jew murderers driven by pathological hatred.\nThe U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington, D.C., which opened in 1993, gets sharp criticism from Finkelstein. Why, he asks, did the victims of the Holocaust get a national museum but not the victims of American slavery or the American Indian extermination? He also argues that the Gentile victims of the Holocaust \u2013 especially the Romani victims of the Porajmos \u2013 got only token recognition in the museum. More generally he claims that museum's leadership is committed to political support of the Israeli state, pointing to its praise of pro-Zionist literature and its condemnation of anti-Zionist literature.\nFinkelstein takes book reviewers and historians to task for praising two Holocaust memoirs which he reveals to be fraudulent on page 55 of the book: \"The Painted Bird\" by Jerzy Kosi\u0144ski (1965) and \"\" by Binjamin Wilkomirski (1995).\nSwiss banks.\nIn 1995 the World Jewish Congress initiated a lawsuit against Swiss banks to recover the assets in accounts left dormant by victims of the Holocaust. Finkelstein accuses the leaders of Jewish organizations of exaggerating the size of the assets and of using Swiss payouts to fund their own pet projects. He is equally critical of a similar lawsuit directed at German banks and of attempts to get monetary compensation from the Polish government.\nReviews and critiques.\nThe book has been controversial, receiving a number of both positive and negative reviews. For \"The Nation\", Neve Gordon commented in 2000: \"Finkelstein does not hesitate to use blunt language rather than euphemism; and although he usually applies words in a precise manner, at times he gets carried away in his analysis.\" The Holocaust historian Raul Hilberg said:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt; Referring to the part of the book that deals with the claims against the Swiss banks and to forced labor, he noted: &lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;I would now say in retrospect that he was actually conservative, moderate and that his conclusions are trustworthy. He is a well-trained political scientist, has the ability to do the research, did it carefully, and has come up with the right results. I am by no means the only one who, in the coming months or years, will totally agree with Finkelstein's breakthrough.\nIsraeli historian Moshe Zuckermann welcomed his book as an \"irreplaceable critique of the \u2018instrumentalisation of the past\u2019 and underlined its \u2018liberating potential\u2019\".\nOren Baruch Stier reviewing the book for the journal \"Prooftexts\" summarized the book as a \"small and pungent manifesto\" and concluded his review by writing that \"there are worthwhile arguments here, if one can stomach the bile in which they float\".\nGenocide scholar Omer Bartov wrote that \"Like any conspiracy theory, it contains several grains of truth; and like any such theory, it is both irrational and insidious.\"\nEnzo Traverso reviewing the book for the journal \"Historical Materialism\" wrote that the book has proven controversial, concluding that it \"contains a core of truth that must be recognised, but it lends itself, due to its style and several of its main arguments, to the worst uses and instrumentalisations.\" He suggested that the book should be seen as an opportunity for stimulating public debates about difficult topics related to \"the politics of memory and on the public uses of history\"\nDonald D. Denton, reviewing the book for \"Terrorism and Political Violence\" journal, noted that it \"will be valuable as an historical piece of research and of interest to those who now attempt to deal with the contemporary genocides and the subsequent generations of children of those who endured such horrors\".\nWolfgang Benz stated to \"Le Monde\": \"It is impossible to learn anything from Finkelstein's book. At best, it is interesting for a psychotherapist.\" Jean Birnbaum publishing in the same venue added that Norman Finkelstein \"hardly cares about nuance\" and Rony Brauman wrote in the preface to the French edition (\"L'Industrie de l'Holocauste\", Paris, La Fabrique, 2001) that some assertions of Finkelstein (especially on the impact of the Six-Day War) are wrong, others being pieces of \"propaganda\".\nHistorian Peter Novick, whose work Finkelstein described as providing the \"initial stimulus\" for \"The Holocaust Industry\", said in the July 28, 2000 issue of London's \"The Jewish Chronicle\" that Finkelstein's book is replete with \"false accusations\", \"egregious misrepresentations\", \"absurd claims\" and \"repeated mis-statements\" (\"A charge into darkness that sheds no light\"). Finkelstein replied to the allegations by Novick on his website, replying to five \"specific charges\", and criticizing his opponents' \"intellectual standards\".\nHistorian Hasia Diner described Peter Novick and Finkelstein of being \"harsh critics of American Jewry from the left,\" and challenged the notion in their books that American Jews did not begin to commemorate the Holocaust until after 1967.\nAndrew Ross, reviewing the book for \"Salon\", wrote:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;On the issue of reparations, he barely acknowledges the wrongs committed by the Swiss and German institutions \u2014 the burying of Jewish bank accounts, the use of slave labor \u2014 that gave rise to the recent reparations drive. The fear that the reparations will not wind up in the hands of those who need and deserve them most is a legitimate concern. But the idea that survivors have been routinely swindled by Jewish institutions is a gross distortion. The chief reason why survivors have so far seen nothing of the $1.25 billion Swiss settlement, reached in 1998, is that U.S. courts have yet to rule on a method of distribution. On other reparations and compensation settlements, the Claims Conference, a particular bete noire of Finkelstein, says that it distributed approximately $220 million to individual survivors in 1999 alone.\nAlvin Hirsch Rosenfeld wrote that \"The Holocaust Industry\" \"is representative of a polemical engagement with the Holocaust\" that places it in line with a number of other works by \"critics of Holocaust consciousness, all of whom stress the utilitarian function of memory\", and who see many modern references to The Holocaust as \"means of enhancing ethnic identity and advancing political agendas of one kind or another\". Rosenfeld also noted that the book presents those ideas in a very \"harsh and inflammatory way.\"\nIt has been suggested by the editor of \" Terrorism and Political Violence\" journal that the book \"probably cost [Finkelstein] ... tenure at DePaul University\".\nFinkelstein's response to critics.\nFinkelstein responded to his critics in the foreword to the second edition (published in 2003), writing \"Mainstream critics allege that I conjured a 'conspiracy theory' while those on the Left ridicule the book as a defense of 'the banks'. None, so far as I can tell, question my actual findings.\"\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "13787", "revid": "50817651", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=13787", "title": "Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn", "text": "British magical order (1887\u20131903)\nThe Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn (), more commonly the Golden Dawn (), was a secret society from the Western esoteric tradition, that was heavily based on Rosicrucianism and inspired by Freemasonry, chiefly devoted to the study and practice of occult Hermeticism and metaphysics during the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Known as a magical order, the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn was active in Great Britain and focused its practices on theurgy and spiritual development. Many present-day concepts of ritual and magic that are at the centre of contemporary traditions, such as Wicca and Thelema, were inspired by the Golden Dawn, which became one of the largest single influences on 20th-century Western occultism.\nThe three founders, William Robert Woodman, William Wynn Westcott, and Samuel Liddell Mathers, were Freemasons and members of the Societas Rosicruciana in Anglia. Westcott appears to have been the initial driving force behind the establishment of the Golden Dawn. Hence the Golden Dawn system was based on hierarchy and initiation, similar to Masonic lodges. While the grade structure was based on the SRIA, women were admitted on an equal basis with men.\nThe \"Golden Dawn\" was the first of three Orders, although all three are often collectively referred to as the \"Golden Dawn\". The First Order taught esoteric philosophy based on the Hermetic Qabalah and personal development through study and awareness of the four classical elements, as well as the basics of astrology, tarot divination, and geomancy. The Second or Inner Order, the , taught magic, including scrying, astral travel, and alchemy. The Third Order was that of the Secret Chiefs, who were said to be highly skilled; they supposedly directed the activities of the lower two orders by spirit communication with the Chiefs of the Second Order.\nHistory.\nCipher Manuscripts.\nThe foundational documents of the original Order of the Golden Dawn, known as the Cipher Manuscripts, are written in English using the Trithemius cipher. The manuscripts give the specific outlines of the Grade Rituals of the Order and prescribe a curriculum of graduated teachings that encompass the Hermetic Qabalah, astrology, occult tarot, geomancy, and alchemy.\nAccording to the records of the Order, the manuscripts passed from Kenneth R. H. Mackenzie, a Masonic scholar, to the Rev. A. F. A. Woodford, whom British occult writer Francis King describes as the fourth founder, although Woodford died shortly after the Order was founded. The documents did not excite Woodford, and in February 1886 he passed them on to Freemason William Wynn Westcott, who managed to decode them in 1887. \nWestcott, pleased with his discovery, called on fellow Freemason Samuel Liddell MacGregor Mathers for a second opinion. Westcott asked for Mathers's help to turn the manuscripts into a coherent system for lodge work. Mathers asked fellow Freemason William Robert Woodman to assist the two, and he accepted. \nMathers and Westcott have been credited with developing the ritual outlines in the Cipher Manuscripts into a workable format. Mathers is generally credited with the design of the curriculum and rituals of the Second Order, which he called the \"Rosae Rubae et Aureae Crucis\" (\"Ruby Rose and Golden Cross\" or the \"RR et AC\").\nFounding of the First Temple.\nIn October 1887, Westcott claimed to have written to a German countess and prominent Rosicrucian named Anna Sprengel, whose address was said to have been found in the decoded Cipher Manuscripts. According to Westcott, Sprengel claimed the ability to contact certain supernatural entities, known as the Secret Chiefs, that were considered the authorities over any magical order or esoteric organization. Westcott purportedly received a reply from Sprengel granting permission to establish a Golden Dawn temple and conferring honorary grades of Adeptus Exemptus on Westcott, Mathers, and Woodman. The temple was to consist of the five grades outlined in the manuscripts.\nIn 1888, the Isis-Urania Temple was founded in London. In contrast to the SRIA and Masonry, women were allowed and welcome to participate in the Order in \"perfect equality\" with men. The Order was more of a philosophical and metaphysical teaching order in its early years. Other than certain rituals and meditations found in the Cipher manuscripts and developed further, \"magical practices\" were generally not taught at the first temple.\nFor the first four years, the Golden Dawn was one cohesive group later known as the \"First Order\" or \"Outer Order\". A \"Second Order\" or \"Inner Order\" was established and became active in 1892. The Second Order consisted of members known as \"adepts\", who had completed the entire course of study for the First Order. The Second Order was formally established under the name \"Ordo Rosae Rubeae et Aureae Crucis\" (the Order of the Red Rose and the Golden Cross).\nEventually, the Osiris temple in Weston-super-Mare, the Horus temple in Bradford (both in 1888), and the Amen-Ra temple in Edinburgh (1893) were founded. In 1893, Mathers founded the Ahathoor temple in Paris.\nThe Secret Chiefs.\nIn 1890, Westcott's alleged correspondence with Anna Sprengel suddenly ceased. He claimed to have received word from Germany that she was dead and that her companions did not approve of the founding of the Order, and no further contact was to be made. If the founders were to contact the Secret Chiefs, apparently, it had to be done on their own. \nIn 1892, Mathers professed that a link to the Secret Chiefs had been established. Subsequently, he supplied rituals for the Second Order. The rituals were based on the tradition of the tomb of Christian Rosenkreuz, and a \"Vault of Adepts\" became the controlling force behind the Outer Order. Later in 1916, Westcott claimed that Mathers also constructed these rituals from materials he received from Frater Lux ex Tenebris, a purported \"Continental Adept\".\nSome followers of the Golden Dawn tradition believe that the Secret Chiefs were not human or supernatural beings, but rather symbolic representations of actual or legendary sources of spiritual esotericism. The term came to stand for a great leader or teacher of a spiritual path or practice that found its way into the teachings of the Order.\nGolden Age.\nBy the mid-1890s, the Golden Dawn was well established in Great Britain, with over one hundred members from every class of Victorian society. Many celebrities belonged to the Golden Dawn, such as the actress Florence Farr, the Irish revolutionary Maud Gonne, the Irish poet William Butler Yeats, the Welsh author Arthur Machen, and the English authors Evelyn Underhill and Aleister Crowley.\nIn 1896 or 1897, Westcott broke all ties to the Golden Dawn, leaving Mathers in control. It has been speculated that his departure was due to his having lost a number of occult-related papers in a hansom cab. Apparently, when the papers were found, Westcott's connection to the Golden Dawn was discovered and brought to the attention of his employers. He may have been told to either resign from the Order or to give up his occupation as coroner. After Westcott's departure, Mathers appointed Florence Farr to be Chief Adept in Anglia. Dr. Henry B. Pullen Burry succeeded Westcott as Cancellarius\u2014one of the three Chiefs of the Order.\nMathers was the only active founding member after Westcott's departure. Due to personality clashes with other members and frequent absences from the center of Lodge activity in Great Britain, however, challenges to Mathers's authority as leader developed among the members of the Second Order.\nRevolt.\nTowards the end of 1899, the Adepts of the Isis-Urania and Amen-Ra temples had become dissatisfied with Mathers's leadership, as well as his growing friendship with Aleister Crowley. They had also become anxious to make contact with the Secret Chiefs themselves, instead of relying on Mathers as an intermediary. Within the Isis-Urania temple, disputes were arising between Farr's \"The Sphere\", a secret society within the Isis-Urania, and the rest of the Adepti Minores.\nCrowley was refused initiation into the Adeptus Minor grade by the London officials. Mathers overrode their decision and quickly initiated him at the Ahathoor temple in Paris on 16 January 1900. Upon his return to the London temple, Crowley requested from Miss Cracknell, the acting secretary, the papers acknowledging his grade, to which he was now entitled.\nTo the London Adepts, this was the final straw. Farr, already of the opinion that the London temple should be closed, wrote to Mathers expressing her wish to resign as his representative, although she was willing to carry on until a successor was found. Mathers believed Westcott was behind this turn of events, and replied on 16 February.\nOn 3 March a committee of seven Adepts was elected in London and requested a full investigation of the matter. Mathers sent an immediate reply, declining to provide proof, refusing to acknowledge the London temple, and dismissing Farr as his representative on 23 March. In response, a general meeting was called on 29 March in London to remove Mathers as chief and expel him from the Order.\nSplinters.\nIn 1901, W. B. Yeats privately published a pamphlet titled \"Is the Order of R. R. &amp; A. C. to Remain a Magical Order?\" After the Isis-Urania temple claimed its independence, there were even more disputes, leading to Yeats resigning. A committee of three was to temporarily govern, which included P. W. Bullock, M. W. Blackden and J. W. Brodie-Innes. After a short time, Bullock resigned, and Dr. Robert Felkin took his place.\nIn 1903, A. E. Waite and Blackden joined forces to retain the name Isis-Urania, while Felkin and other London members formed the Stella Matutina. Yeats remained in the Stella Matutina until 1921, while Brodie-Innes continued his Amen-Ra membership in Edinburgh.\nReconstruction.\nOnce Mathers realised that reconciliation was impossible, he made efforts to reestablish himself in London. The Bradford and Weston-super-Mare temples remained loyal to him, but their numbers were few. He then appointed Edward Berridge as his representative. According to Francis King, historical evidence shows that there were \"twenty three members of a flourishing Second Order under Berridge-Mathers in 1913.\"\nJ.W. Brodie-Innes continued leading the Amen-Ra temple, deciding that the revolt was unjustified. By 1908, Mathers and Brodie-Innes were in complete accord. According to sources that differ regarding the actual date, sometime between 1901 and 1913 Mathers renamed the branch of the Golden Dawn remaining loyal to his leadership, to Alpha et Omega. \nBrodie-Innes assumed command of the English and Scottish temples, while Mathers concentrated on building up his Ahathoor temple and extending his American connections. According to occultist Israel Regardie, the Golden Dawn had spread to the United States of America before 1900 and a Thoth-Hermes temple had been founded in Chicago. By the beginning of the First World War in 1914, Mathers had established two to three American temples.\nMost temples of the Alpha et Omega and Stella Matutina closed or went into abeyance by the end of the 1930s, with the exceptions of two Stella Matutina temples: Hermes Temple in Bristol, which operated sporadically until 1970, and the Smaragdum Thallasses Temple, commonly referred to as Whare Ra, in Havelock North, New Zealand, which operated regularly until its closure in 1978.\nStructure and grades.\nMuch of the hierarchical structure for the Golden Dawn came from the Societas Rosicruciana in Anglia, which was itself derived from the Order of the Golden and Rosy Cross.\nThe paired numbers attached to the Grades relate to positions on the Tree of Life. The Neophyte Grade of \"0=0\" indicates no position on the Tree. In the other pairs, the first numeral is the number of steps up from the bottom (Malkuth), and the second numeral is the number of steps down from the top (Kether).\nThe First Order Grades were related to the four elements of Earth, Air, Water, and Fire, respectively. The Aspirant to a Grade received instruction on the metaphysical meaning of each of these Elements and had to pass a written examination and demonstrate certain skills to receive admission to that Grade.\nContemporary Golden Dawn orders.\nWhile no temples in the original chartered lineage of the Golden Dawn survived past the 1970s, several organizations have since carried on, revived or expanded upon the Order's teachings and rituals, including:\n\"The Golden Dawn\" book.\n\"The Golden Dawn\", by Israel Regardie; was published in 1937. The book is divided into several basic sections. First are the knowledge lectures, which describe the basic teaching of the Qabalah, symbolism, meditation, geomancy, etc. This is followed by the rituals of the Outer Order, consisting of five initiation rituals into the degrees of the Golden Dawn. The next section covers the rituals of the Inner Order including two initiation rituals and equinox ceremonies.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nWorks cited.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The values returned by a hash function are called \"hash values\", \"hash codes\", (\"hash/message\") \"digests\", or simply \"hashes\". The values are usually used to index a fixed-size table called a \"hash table\". Use of a hash function to index a hash table is called \"hashing\" or \"scatter-storage addressing\".\nHash functions and their associated hash tables are used in data storage and retrieval applications to access data in a small and nearly constant time per retrieval. They require an amount of storage space only fractionally greater than the total space required for the data or records themselves. Hashing is a way to access data quickly and efficiently. Unlike lists or trees, it provides near-constant access time. It also uses much less storage than trying to store all possible keys directly, especially when keys are large or variable in length.\nUse of hash functions relies on statistical properties of key and function interaction: worst-case behavior is intolerably bad but rare, and average-case behavior can be nearly optimal (minimal collision).527\nHash functions are related to (and often confused with) checksums, check digits, fingerprints, lossy compression, randomization functions, error-correcting codes, and ciphers. Although the concepts overlap to some extent, each one has its own uses and requirements and is designed and optimized differently. The hash function differs from these concepts mainly in terms of data integrity. Hash tables may use non-cryptographic hash functions, while cryptographic hash functions are used in cybersecurity to secure sensitive data such as passwords.\nOverview.\nIn a hash table, a hash function takes a key as an input, which is associated with a datum or record and used to identify it to the data storage and retrieval application. The keys may be fixed-length, like an integer, or variable-length, like a name. In some cases, the key is the datum itself. The output is a hash code used to index a hash table holding the data or records, or pointers to them.\nA hash function may be considered to perform three functions:\nA good hash function satisfies two basic properties: it should be very fast to compute, and it should minimize duplication of output values (collisions). Hash functions rely on generating favorable probability distributions for their effectiveness, reducing access time to nearly constant. High table loading factors, pathological key sets, and poorly designed hash functions can result in access times approaching linear in the number of items in the table. Hash functions can be designed to give the best worst-case performance, good performance under high table loading factors, and in special cases, perfect (collisionless) mapping of keys into hash codes. Implementation is based on parity-preserving bit operations (XOR and ADD), multiply, or divide. A necessary adjunct to the hash function is a collision-resolution method that employs an auxiliary data structure like linked lists, or systematic probing of the table to find an empty slot.\nHash tables.\nHash functions are used in conjunction with hash tables to store and retrieve data items or data records. The hash function translates the key associated with each datum or record into a hash code, which is used to index the hash table. When an item is to be added to the table, the hash code may index an empty slot (also called a bucket), in which case the item is added to the table there. If the hash code indexes a full slot, then some kind of collision resolution is required: the new item may be omitted (not added to the table), or replace the old item, or be added to the table in some other location by a specified procedure. That procedure depends on the structure of the hash table. In \"chained hashing\", each slot is the head of a linked list or chain, and items that collide at the slot are added to the chain. Chains may be kept in random order and searched linearly, or in serial order, or as a self-ordering list by frequency to speed up access. In \"open address hashing\", the table is probed starting from the occupied slot in a specified manner, usually by linear probing, quadratic probing, or double hashing until an open slot is located or the entire table is probed (overflow). Searching for the item follows the same procedure until the item is located, an open slot is found, or the entire table has been searched (item not in table).\nSpecialized uses.\nHash functions are also used to build caches for large data sets stored in slow media. A cache is generally simpler than a hashed search table, since any collision can be resolved by discarding or writing back the older of the two colliding items.\nHash functions are an essential ingredient of the Bloom filter, a space-efficient probabilistic data structure that is used to test whether an element is a member of a set.\nA special case of hashing is known as geometric hashing or the \"grid method\". In these applications, the set of all inputs is some sort of metric space, and the hashing function can be interpreted as a partition of that space into a grid of \"cells\". The table is often an array with two or more indices (called a \"grid file\", \"grid index\", \"bucket grid\", and similar names), and the hash function returns an index tuple. This principle is widely used in computer graphics, computational geometry, and many other disciplines, to solve many proximity problems in the plane or in three-dimensional space, such as finding closest pairs in a set of points, similar shapes in a list of shapes, similar images in an image database, and so on.\nHash tables are also used to implement associative arrays and dynamic sets.\nProperties.\nUniformity.\nA good hash function should map the expected inputs as evenly as possible over its output range. That is, every hash value in the output range should be generated with roughly the same probability. The reason for this last requirement is that the cost of hashing-based methods goes up sharply as the number of \"collisions\"\u2014pairs of inputs that are mapped to the same hash value\u2014increases. If some hash values are more likely to occur than others, then a larger fraction of the lookup operations will have to search through a larger set of colliding table entries.\nThis criterion only requires the value to be \"uniformly distributed\", not \"random\" in any sense. A good randomizing function is (barring computational efficiency concerns) generally a good choice as a hash function, but the converse need not be true.\nHash tables often contain only a small subset of the valid inputs. For instance, a club membership list may contain only a hundred or so member names, out of the very large set of all possible names. In these cases, the uniformity criterion should hold for almost all typical subsets of entries that may be found in the table, not just for the global set of all possible entries.\nIn other words, if a typical set of \"m\" records is hashed to \"n\" table slots, then the probability of a bucket receiving many more than \"m\"/\"n\" records should be vanishingly small. In particular, if \"m\" &lt; \"n\", then very few buckets should have more than one or two records. A small number of collisions is virtually inevitable, even if \"n\" is much larger than \"m\"\u2014see the birthday problem.\nIn special cases when the keys are known in advance and the key set is static, a hash function can be found that achieves absolute (or collisionless) uniformity. Such a hash function is said to be \"perfect\". There is no algorithmic way of constructing such a function\u2014searching for one is a factorial function of the number of keys to be mapped versus the number of table slots that they are mapped into. Finding a perfect hash function over more than a very small set of keys is usually computationally infeasible; the resulting function is likely to be more computationally complex than a standard hash function and provides only a marginal advantage over a function with good statistical properties that yields a minimum number of collisions. See universal hash function.\nTesting and measurement.\nWhen testing a hash function, the uniformity of the distribution of hash values can be evaluated by the chi-squared test. This test is a goodness-of-fit measure: it is the actual distribution of items in buckets versus the expected (or uniform) distribution of items. The formula is\nformula_1\nwhere n is the number of keys, m is the number of buckets, and \"b\"\"j\" is the number of items in bucket j.\nA ratio within one confidence interval (such as 0.95 to 1.05) is indicative that the hash function evaluated has an expected uniform distribution.\nHash functions can have some technical properties that make it more likely that they will have a uniform distribution when applied. One is the strict avalanche criterion: whenever a single input bit is complemented, each of the output bits changes with a 50% probability. The reason for this property is that selected subsets of the keyspace may have low variability. For the output to be uniformly distributed, a low amount of variability, even one bit, should translate into a high amount of variability (i.e. distribution over the tablespace) in the output. Each bit should change with a probability of 50% because, if some bits are reluctant to change, then the keys become clustered around those values. If the bits want to change too readily, then the mapping is approaching a fixed XOR function of a single bit. Standard tests for this property have been described in the literature. The relevance of the criterion to a multiplicative hash function is assessed here.\nEfficiency.\nIn data storage and retrieval applications, the use of a hash function is a trade-off between search time and data storage space. If search time were unbounded, then a very compact unordered linear list would be the best medium; if storage space were unbounded, then a randomly accessible structure indexable by the key-value would be very large and very sparse, but very fast. A hash function takes a finite amount of time to map a potentially large keyspace to a feasible amount of storage space searchable in a bounded amount of time regardless of the number of keys. In most applications, the hash function should be computable with minimum latency and secondarily in a minimum number of instructions.\nComputational complexity varies with the number of instructions required and latency of individual instructions, with the simplest being the bitwise methods (folding), followed by the multiplicative methods, and the most complex (slowest) are the division-based methods.\nBecause collisions should be infrequent, and cause a marginal delay but are otherwise harmless, it is usually preferable to choose a faster hash function over one that needs more computation but saves a few collisions.\nDivision-based implementations can be of particular concern because a division requires multiple cycles on nearly all processor microarchitectures. Division (modulo) by a constant can be inverted to become a multiplication by the word-size multiplicative-inverse of that constant. This can be done by the programmer, or by the compiler. Division can also be reduced directly into a series of shift-subtracts and shift-adds, though minimizing the number of such operations required is a daunting problem; the number of machine-language instructions resulting may be more than a dozen and swamp the pipeline. If the microarchitecture has hardware multiply functional units, then the multiply-by-inverse is likely a better approach.\nWe can allow the table size \"n\" to not be a power of 2 and still not have to perform any remainder or division operation, as these computations are sometimes costly. For example, let \"n\" be significantly less than 2\"b\". Consider a pseudorandom number generator function \"P\"(key) that is uniform on the interval [0, 2\"b\"\u00a0\u2212\u00a01]. A hash function uniform on the interval [0, \"n\" \u2212 1] is \"n\" \"P\"(key) / 2\"b\". We can replace the division by a (possibly faster) right bit shift: \"n P\"(key) \u00bb \"b\".\nIf keys are being hashed repeatedly, and the hash function is costly, then computing time can be saved by precomputing the hash codes and storing them with the keys. Matching hash codes almost certainly means that the keys are identical. This technique is used for the transposition table in game-playing programs, which stores a 64-bit hashed representation of the board position.\nUniversality.\nA \"universal hashing\" scheme is a randomized algorithm that selects a hash function \"h\" among a family of such functions, in such a way that the probability of a collision of any two distinct keys is 1/\"m\", where \"m\" is the number of distinct hash values desired\u2014independently of the two keys. Universal hashing ensures (in a probabilistic sense) that the hash function application will behave as well as if it were using a random function, for any distribution of the input data. It will, however, have more collisions than perfect hashing and may require more operations than a special-purpose hash function.\nApplicability.\nA hash function that allows only certain table sizes or strings only up to a certain length, or cannot accept a seed (i.e. allow double hashing) is less useful than one that does.\nA hash function is applicable in a variety of situations. Particularly within cryptography, notable applications include:\nDeterministic.\nA hash procedure must be deterministic\u2014for a given input value, it must always generate the same hash value. In other words, it must be a function of the data to be hashed, in the mathematical sense of the term. This requirement excludes hash functions that depend on external variable parameters, such as pseudo-random number generators or the time of day. It also excludes functions that depend on the memory address of the object being hashed, because the address may change during execution (as may happen on systems that use certain methods of garbage collection), although sometimes rehashing of the item is possible.\nThe determinism is in the context of the reuse of the function. For example, Python adds the feature that hash functions make use of a randomized seed that is generated once when the Python process starts in addition to the input to be hashed. The Python hash (SipHash) is still a valid hash function when used within a single run, but if the values are persisted (for example, written to disk), they can no longer be treated as valid hash values, since in the next run the random value might differ.\nDefined range.\nIt is often desirable that the output of a hash function have fixed size (but see below). If, for example, the output is constrained to 32-bit integer values, then the hash values can be used to index into an array. Such hashing is commonly used to accelerate data searches. Producing fixed-length output from variable-length input can be accomplished by breaking the input data into chunks of specific size. Hash functions used for data searches use some arithmetic expression that iteratively processes chunks of the input (such as the characters in a string) to produce the hash value.\nVariable range.\nIn many applications, the range of hash values may be different for each run of the program or may change along the same run (for instance, when a hash table needs to be expanded). In those situations, one needs a hash function which takes two parameters\u2014the input data \"z\", and the number \"n\" of allowed hash values.\nA common solution is to compute a fixed hash function with a very large range (say, 0 to 232\u00a0\u2212\u00a01), divide the result by \"n\", and use the division's remainder. If \"n\" is itself a power of 2, this can be done by bit masking and bit shifting. When this approach is used, the hash function must be chosen so that the result has fairly uniform distribution between 0 and \"n\"\u00a0\u2212\u00a01, for any value of \"n\" that may occur in the application. Depending on the function, the remainder may be uniform only for certain values of \"n\", e.g. odd or prime numbers.\nVariable range with minimal movement (dynamic hash function).\nWhen the hash function is used to store values in a hash table that outlives the run of the program, and the hash table needs to be expanded or shrunk, the hash table is referred to as a dynamic hash table.\nA hash function that will relocate the minimum number of records when the table is resized is desirable. What is needed is a hash function \"H\"(\"z\",\"n\") (where \"z\" is the key being hashed and \"n\" is the number of allowed hash values) such that \"H\"(\"z\",\"n\"\u00a0+\u00a01) = \"H\"(\"z\",\"n\") with probability close to \"n\"/(\"n\"\u00a0+\u00a01).\nLinear hashing and spiral hashing are examples of dynamic hash functions that execute in constant time but relax the property of uniformity to achieve the minimal movement property. Extendible hashing uses a dynamic hash function that requires space proportional to \"n\" to compute the hash function, and it becomes a function of the previous keys that have been inserted. Several algorithms that preserve the uniformity property but require time proportional to \"n\" to compute the value of \"H\"(\"z\",\"n\") have been invented.\nA hash function with minimal movement is especially useful in distributed hash tables.\nData normalization.\nIn some applications, the input data may contain features that are irrelevant for comparison purposes. For example, when looking up a personal name, it may be desirable to ignore the distinction between upper and lower case letters. For such data, one must use a hash function that is compatible with the data equivalence criterion being used: that is, any two inputs that are considered equivalent must yield the same hash value. This can be accomplished by normalizing the input before hashing it, as by upper-casing all letters.\nHashing integer data types.\nThere are several common algorithms for hashing integers. The method giving the best distribution is data-dependent. One of the simplest and most common methods in practice is the modulo division method.\nIdentity hash function.\nIf the data to be hashed is small enough, then one can use the data itself (reinterpreted as an integer) as the hashed value. The cost of computing this \"identity\" hash function is effectively zero. This hash function is perfect, as it maps each input to a distinct hash value.\nThe meaning of \"small enough\" depends on the size of the type that is used as the hashed value. For example, in Java, the hash code is a 32-bit integer. Thus the 32-bit integer codice_1 and 32-bit floating-point codice_2 objects can simply use the value directly, whereas the 64-bit integer codice_3 and 64-bit floating-point codice_4 cannot.\nOther types of data can also use this hashing scheme. For example, when mapping character strings between upper and lower case, one can use the binary encoding of each character, interpreted as an integer, to index a table that gives the alternative form of that character (\"A\" for \"a\", \"8\" for \"8\", etc.). If each character is stored in 8 bits (as in extended ASCII or ISO Latin 1), the table has only 28 = 256 entries; in the case of Unicode characters, the table would have 17 \u00d7 216 = entries.\nThe same technique can be used to map two-letter country codes like \"us\" or \"za\" to country names (262 = 676 table entries), 5-digit ZIP codes like 13083 to city names ( entries), etc. Invalid data values (such as the country code \"xx\" or the ZIP code 00000) may be left undefined in the table or mapped to some appropriate \"null\" value.\nTrivial hash function.\nIf the keys are uniformly or sufficiently uniformly distributed over the key space, so that the key values are essentially random, then they may be considered to be already \"hashed\". In this case, any number of any bits in the key may be extracted and collated as an index into the hash table. For example, a simple hash function might mask off the m least significant bits and use the result as an index into a hash table of size 2\"m\".\nMid-squares.\nA mid-squares hash code is produced by squaring the input and extracting an appropriate number of middle digits or bits. For example, if the input is and the hash table size , then squaring the key produces , so the hash code is taken as the middle 4 digits of the 17-digit number (ignoring the high digit) 8750. The mid-squares method produces a reasonable hash code if there is not a lot of leading or trailing zeros in the key. This is a variant of multiplicative hashing, but not as good because an arbitrary key is not a good multiplier.\nDivision hashing.\nA standard technique is to use a modulo function on the key, by selecting a divisor M which is a prime number close to the table size, so \"h\"(\"K\") \u2261 \"K\" (mod \"M\"). The table size is usually a power of 2. This gives a distribution from {0, \"M\" \u2212 1}. This gives good results over a large number of key sets. A significant drawback of division hashing is that division requires multiple cycles on most modern architectures (including x86) and can be 10 times slower than multiplication. A second drawback is that it will not break up clustered keys. For example, the keys 123000, 456000, 789000, etc. modulo 1000 all map to the same address. This technique works well in practice because many key sets are sufficiently random already, and the probability that a key set will be cyclical by a large prime number is small.\nAlgebraic coding.\nAlgebraic coding is a variant of the division method of hashing which uses division by a polynomial modulo 2 instead of an integer to map n bits to m bits. In this approach, \"M\" = 2\"m\", and we postulate an mth-degree polynomial \"Z\"(\"x\") = \"x\"\"m\" + \u03b6\"m\"\u22121\"x\"\"m\"\u22121 + &amp;ctdot; + \u03b60. A key \"K\" = (\"k\"\"n\"\u22121&amp;mldr;\"k\"1\"k\"0)2 can be regarded as the polynomial \"K\"(\"x\") = \"k\"\"n\"\u22121\"x\"\"n\"\u22121 + &amp;ctdot; + \"k\"1\"x\" + \"k\"0. The remainder using polynomial arithmetic modulo 2 is \"K\"(\"x\") mod \"Z\"(\"x\") = \"h\"\"m\"\u22121\"x\"\"m\"\u22121 + &amp;ctdot; \"h\"1\"x\" + \"h\"0. Then \"h\"(\"K\") = (\"h\"\"m\"\u22121&amp;mldr;\"h\"1\"h\"0)2. If \"Z\"(\"x\") is constructed to have t or fewer non-zero coefficients, then keys which share fewer than t bits are guaranteed to not collide.\nZ is a function of k, t, and n (the last of which is a divisor of 2\"k\" \u2212 1) and is constructed from the finite field GF(2\"k\"). Knuth gives an example: taking (\"n\",\"m\",\"t\") = (15,10,7) yields \"Z\"(\"x\") = \"x\"10 + \"x\"8 + \"x\"5 + \"x\"4 + \"x\"2 + \"x\" + 1. The derivation is as follows:\nLet S be the smallest set of integers such that {1,2,&amp;mldr;,\"t\"} &amp;SubsetEqual; \"S\" and (2\"j\" mod \"n\") &amp;in; \"S\" \u2200\"j\" &amp;in; \"S\".\nDefine formula_2 where \u03b1 &amp;in;\"n\" GF(2\"k\") and where the coefficients of \"P\"(\"x\") are computed in this field. Then the degree of \"P\"(\"x\") = |\"S\"|. Since \u03b12\"j\" is a root of \"P\"(\"x\") whenever \u03b1\"j\" is a root, it follows that the coefficients \"pi\" of \"P\"(\"x\") satisfy \"p\" = \"p\"i, so they are all 0 or 1. If \"R\"(\"x\") = \"r\"\"n\"\u22121\"x\"\"n\"\u22121 + &amp;ctdot; + \"r\"1\"x\" + \"r\"0 is any nonzero polynomial modulo 2 with at most t nonzero coefficients, then \"R\"(\"x\") is not a multiple of \"P\"(\"x\") modulo 2. If follows that the corresponding hash function will map keys with fewer than t bits in common to unique indices.\nThe usual outcome is that either n will get large, or t will get large, or both, for the scheme to be computationally feasible. Therefore, it is more suited to hardware or microcode implementation.\nUnique permutation hashing.\nUnique permutation hashing has a guaranteed best worst-case insertion time.\nMultiplicative hashing.\nStandard multiplicative hashing uses the formula \"h\"\"a\"(\"K\") = \u230a(\"aK\" mod \"W\") / (\"W\"/\"M\")\u230b, which produces a hash value in {0, &amp;mldr;, \"M\" \u2212 1}. The value a is an appropriately chosen value that should be relatively prime to W; it should be large, and its binary representation a random mix of 1s and 0s. An important practical special case occurs when \"W\" = 2\"w\" and \"M\" = 2\"m\" are powers of 2 and w is the machine word size. In this case, this formula becomes \"h\"\"a\"(\"K\") = \u230a(\"aK\" mod 2\"w\") / 2\"w\"\u2212\"m\"\u230b. This is special because arithmetic modulo 2\"w\" is done by default in low-level programming languages and integer division by a power of 2 is simply a right-shift, so, in C, for example, this function becomes\nunsigned hash(unsigned K) { \n return (a * K) \u00bb (w - m);\nand for fixed m and w this translates into a single integer multiplication and right-shift, making it one of the fastest hash functions to compute.\nMultiplicative hashing is susceptible to a \"common mistake\" that leads to poor diffusion\u2014higher-value input bits do not affect lower-value output bits. A transmutation on the input which shifts the span of retained top bits down and XORs or ADDs them to the key before the multiplication step corrects for this. The resulting function looks like:\nunsigned hash(unsigned K) {\n K ^= K \u00bb (w - m); \n return (a * K) \u00bb (w - m);\nFibonacci hashing.\nFibonacci hashing is a form of multiplicative hashing in which the multiplier is 2\"w\" / &amp;varphi;, where w is the machine word length and &amp;varphi; (phi) is the golden ratio (approximately 1.618). A property of this multiplier is that it uniformly distributes over the table space, blocks of consecutive keys with respect to any block of bits in the key. Consecutive keys within the high bits or low bits of the key (or some other field) are relatively common. The multipliers for various word lengths are:\nThe multiplier should be odd, so the least significant bit of the output is invertible modulo 2\"w\". The last two values given above are rounded (up and down, respectively) by more than 1/2 of a least-significant bit to achieve this.\nZobrist hashing.\n\"Zobrist hashing\", named after Albert Zobrist, is a form of tabulation hashing, which is a method for constructing universal families of hash functions by combining table lookup with XOR operations. This algorithm has proven to be very fast and of high quality for hashing purposes (especially hashing of integer-number keys).\nZobrist hashing was originally introduced as a means of compactly representing chess positions in computer game-playing programs. A unique random number was assigned to represent each type of piece (six each for black and white) on each space of the board. Thus a table of 64\u00d712 such numbers is initialized at the start of the program. The random numbers could be any length, but 64 bits was natural due to the 64 squares on the board. A position was transcribed by cycling through the pieces in a position, indexing the corresponding random numbers (vacant spaces were not included in the calculation) and XORing them together (the starting value could be 0 (the identity value for XOR) or a random seed). The resulting value was reduced by modulo, folding, or some other operation to produce a hash table index. The original Zobrist hash was stored in the table as the representation of the position.\nLater, the method was extended to hashing integers by representing each byte in each of 4 possible positions in the word by a unique 32-bit random number. Thus, a table of 28\u00d74 random numbers is constructed. A 32-bit hashed integer is transcribed by successively indexing the table with the value of each byte of the plain text integer and XORing the loaded values together (again, the starting value can be the identity value or a random seed). The natural extension to 64-bit integers is by use of a table of 28\u00d78 64-bit random numbers.\nThis kind of function has some nice theoretical properties, one of which is called \"3-tuple independence\", meaning that every 3-tuple of keys is equally likely to be mapped to any 3-tuple of hash values.\nCustomized hash function.\nA hash function can be designed to exploit existing entropy in the keys. If the keys have leading or trailing zeros, or particular fields that are unused, always zero or some other constant, or generally vary little, then masking out only the volatile bits and hashing on those will provide a better and possibly faster hash function. Selected divisors or multipliers in the division and multiplicative schemes may make more uniform hash functions if the keys are cyclic or have other redundancies.\nHashing variable-length data.\nWhen the data values are long (or variable-length) character strings\u2014such as personal names, web page addresses, or mail messages\u2014their distribution is usually very uneven, with complicated dependencies. For example, text in any natural language has highly non-uniform distributions of characters, and character pairs, characteristic of the language. For such data, it is prudent to use a hash function that depends on all characters of the string\u2014and depends on each character in a different way.\nMiddle and ends.\nSimplistic hash functions may add the first and last \"n\" characters of a string along with the length, or form a word-size hash from the middle 4 characters of a string. This saves iterating over the (potentially long) string, but hash functions that do not hash on all characters of a string can readily become linear due to redundancies, clustering, or other pathologies in the key set. Such strategies may be effective as a custom hash function if the structure of the keys is such that either the middle, ends, or other fields are zero or some other invariant constant that does not differentiate the keys; then the invariant parts of the keys can be ignored.\nCharacter folding.\nThe paradigmatic example of folding by characters is to add up the integer values of all the characters in the string. A better idea is to multiply the hash total by a constant, typically a sizable prime number, before adding in the next character, ignoring overflow. Using exclusive-or instead of addition is also a plausible alternative. The final operation would be a modulo, mask, or other function to reduce the word value to an index the size of the table. The weakness of this procedure is that information may cluster in the upper or lower bits of the bytes; this clustering will remain in the hashed result and cause more collisions than a proper randomizing hash. ASCII byte codes, for example, have an upper bit of 0, and printable strings do not use the last byte code or most of the first 32 byte codes, so the information, which uses the remaining byte codes, is clustered in the remaining bits in an unobvious manner.\nThe classic approach, dubbed the PJW hash based on the work of Peter J. Weinberger at Bell Labs in the 1970s, was originally designed for hashing identifiers into compiler symbol tables as given in the . This hash function offsets the bytes 4 bits before adding them together. When the quantity wraps, the high 4 bits are shifted out and if non-zero, xored back into the low byte of the cumulative quantity. The result is a word-size hash code to which a modulo or other reducing operation can be applied to produce the final hash index.\nToday, especially with the advent of 64-bit word sizes, much more efficient variable-length string hashing by word chunks is available.\nWord length folding.\nModern microprocessors will allow for much faster processing if 8-bit character strings are not hashed by processing one character at a time, but by interpreting the string as an array of 32-bit or 64-bit integers and hashing/accumulating these \"wide word\" integer values by means of arithmetic operations (e.g. multiplication by constant and bit-shifting). The final word, which may have unoccupied byte positions, is filled with zeros or a specified randomizing value before being folded into the hash. The accumulated hash code is reduced by a final modulo or other operation to yield an index into the table.\nRadix conversion hashing.\nAnalogous to the way an ASCII or EBCDIC character string representing a decimal number is converted to a numeric quantity for computing, a variable-length string can be converted as \"x\"\"k\"\u22121a\"k\"\u22121 + \"x\"\"k\"\u22122a\"k\"\u22122 + &amp;ctdot; + \"x\"1\"a\" + \"x\"0. This is simply a polynomial in a radix \"a\"\u00a0&gt;\u00a01 that takes the components (\"x\"0,\"x\"1...,\"x\"\"k\"\u22121) as the characters of the input string of length \"k\". It can be used directly as the hash code, or a hash function applied to it to map the potentially large value to the hash table size. The value of \"a\" is usually a prime number large enough to hold the number of different characters in the character set of potential keys. Radix conversion hashing of strings minimizes the number of collisions. Available data sizes may restrict the maximum length of string that can be hashed with this method. For example, a 128-bit word will hash only a 26-character alphabetic string (ignoring case) with a radix of 29; a printable ASCII string is limited to 9 characters using radix 97 and a 64-bit word. However, alphabetic keys are usually of modest length, because keys must be stored in the hash table. Numeric character strings are usually not a problem; 64 bits can count up to 1019, or 19 decimal digits with radix 10.\nRolling hash.\nIn some applications, such as substring search, one can compute a hash function \"h\" for every \"k\"-character substring of a given \"n\"-character string by advancing a window of width \"k\" characters along the string, where \"k\" is a fixed integer, and \"n\" &gt; \"k\". The straightforward solution, which is to extract such a substring at every character position in the text and compute \"h\" separately, requires a number of operations proportional to \"k\"\u00b7\"n\". However, with the proper choice of \"h\", one can use the technique of rolling hash to compute all those hashes with an effort proportional to \"mk\"\u00a0+\u00a0\"n\" where \"m\" is the number of occurrences of the substring.[]\nThe most familiar algorithm of this type is Rabin-Karp with best and average case performance \"O\"(\"n\"+\"mk\") and worst case \"O\"(\"n\"\u00b7\"k\") (in all fairness, the worst case here is gravely pathological: both the text string and substring are composed of a repeated single character, such as \"t\"=\"AAAAAAAAAAA\", and \"s\"=\"AAA\"). The hash function used for the algorithm is usually the Rabin fingerprint, designed to avoid collisions in 8-bit character strings, but other suitable hash functions are also used.\nAnalysis.\nWorst case results for a hash function can be assessed two ways: theoretical and practical. The theoretical worst case is the probability that all keys map to a single slot. The practical worst case is the expected longest probe sequence (hash function + collision resolution method). This analysis considers uniform hashing, that is, any key will map to any particular slot with probability 1/\"m\", a characteristic of universal hash functions.\nWhile Knuth worries about adversarial attack on real time systems, Gonnet has shown that the probability of such a case is \"ridiculously small\". His representation was that the probability of \"k\" of \"n\" keys mapping to a single slot is \u03b1\"k\" / (\"e\"\u03b1 \"k\"!), where \"\u03b1\" is the load factor, \"n\"/\"m\".\nHistory.\nThe term \"hash\" offers a natural analogy with its non-technical meaning (to chop up or make a mess out of something), given how hash functions scramble their input data to derive their output.514 In his research for the precise origin of the term, Donald Knuth notes that, while Hans Peter Luhn of IBM appears to have been the first to use the concept of a hash function in a memo dated January 1953, the term itself did not appear in published literature until the late 1960s, in Herbert Hellerman's \"Digital Computer System Principles\", even though it was already widespread jargon by then.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

In its modern, most-practiced format, a bar is placed between two standards with a crash mat for landing. Since ancient times, competitors have successively improved their technique, today employing the universally preferred Fosbury Flop, in which athletes run towards the bar and leap head first with their back to the bar.\nThe discipline is, alongside the pole vault, one of two vertical clearance events in the Olympic athletics program. It is contested at the World Championships in Athletics and the World Athletics Indoor Championships, and is a common occurrence at track and field meets. The high jump was among the first events deemed acceptable for women, having been held at the 1928 Olympic Games.\nJavier Sotomayor (Cuba) is the world record holder with a jump of 2.45\u00a0m () set in 1993\u00a0\u2013 the longest-standing record in the history of the men's high jump. Yaroslava Mahuchikh (Ukraine) is the women's world record holder with a jump of 2.10\u00a0m () set in 2024.\nRules.\nThe rules set for the high jump by World Athletics (previously named the IAAF) are Technical Rules TR26 and TR27 (previously Rules 181 and 182). Jumpers must take off from one foot. A jump is considered a failure if the jumper dislodges the bar or touches the ground or any object behind the bar before clearance.\nCompetitors may begin jumping at any height announced by the chief judge, or may pass at their own discretion. Most competitions state that three consecutive missed jumps, at any height or combination of heights, will eliminate the jumper from contention. The victory goes to the jumper who clears the greatest height during the final.\nTie breaking.\nIf two or more jumpers tie for any place, the tie-breakers are: 1) the fewest misses at the height at which the tie occurred; and 2) the fewest misses throughout the competition. If the event remains tied for first place (or a limited-advancement position to a subsequent meet), the jumpers have a jump-off, beginning at the next height above their highest success. Jumpers have one attempt at each height. If only one succeeds, he or she wins; if more than one does, these try with the bar raised; if none does, all try with the bar lowered. This process was followed at the 2015 World Championship men's event and at the 2024 Summer Olympics.\nExample:\nIn the example jump-off, the final cleared height is 1.88m, at which A B C and D each have one failure. D has two failures at lower heights compared to one each for the other three, who proceed to a jump-off at the next height above the final cleared height. C is eliminated in the second round of the jump-off 1.89m, then B wins in the third round.\nA 2009 rule-change makes the jump-off optional, so that first place can be shared by agreement among tied athletes. This rule led to shared gold in the 2020 Olympic men's event held in 2021.\nHistory.\nThe first recorded high jump event took place in Scotland in the 19th century. Early jumpers used either an elaborate straight-on approach or a \"scissors\" technique. In later years, the bar was approached diagonally, and the jumper threw first the inside leg and then the other over the bar in a scissoring motion.\nAround the turn of the 20th century, techniques began to change, beginning with the Irish-American Michael Sweeney's \"Eastern cut-off\" as a variation of the scissors technique. By taking off as in the scissors method, extending his spine and flattening out over the bar, Sweeney raised the world record to 1.97\u00a0m () in 1895. Even in 1948, John Winter of Australia won the gold medal of the 1948 London Olympics with this style. Besides, one of the most successful female high jumpers, Iolanda Bala\u0219 of Romania, used this style to dominate women's high jump for about 10 years until her retirement in 1967.\nAnother American, George Horine, developed an even more efficient technique, the \"Western roll\". In this style, the bar again is approached on a diagonal, but the inner leg is used for the take-off, while the outer leg is thrust up to lead the body sideways over the bar. Horine increased the world standard to 2.01\u00a0m () in 1912. His technique was predominant through the 1936 Berlin Olympics, in which the event was won by Cornelius Johnson at 2.03\u00a0m ().\nAmerican and Soviet jumpers were the most successful for the next four decades, and they pioneered the straddle technique. Straddle jumpers took off as in the Western roll but rotated their torso, belly-down, around the bar, obtaining the most efficient and highest clearance up to that time. Straddle jumper Charles Dumas was the first to clear 7\u00a0ft (2.13m), in 1956. American John Thomas pushed the world mark to 2.23\u00a0m () in 1960. Valeriy Brumel of the Soviet Union took over the event for the next four years, radically speeding up his approach run. He took the record up to 2.28\u00a0m () and won the gold medal of the 1964 Tokyo Olympics, before a motorcycle accident in 1965 ended his career.\nAmerican coaches, including two-time NCAA champion Frank Costello of the University of Maryland, flocked to Russia to learn from Brumel and his coaches like Vladimir Dyachkov. However, it would be a solitary innovator at Oregon State University, Dick Fosbury, who would bring the high jump into the next century.\nTaking advantage of the raised, softer, artificially-cushioned landing areas that were in use by then, Fosbury added a new twist to the outmoded Eastern cut-off. He directed himself over the bar head and shoulders first, going over on his back and landing in a fashion that would likely have resulted in serious injury in the old ground-level landing pits, which were usually filled with sawdust or sand mixtures. Around the same time, Debbie Brill independently came up with the same technique, which she called the 'Brill Bend'.\nSince Fosbury used his new style, called the Fosbury flop, to win the gold medal of the 1968 Mexico Olympics, its use spread quickly, and soon \"floppers\" were dominating international high jump competitions. The first flopper setting a world record was the American Dwight Stones, who cleared 2.30\u00a0m () in 1973. In the female side, the 16-year-old flopper Ulrike Meyfarth from West Germany won the gold medal of the 1972 Munich Olympics at 1.92\u00a0m (), which tied the women's world record at that time (held by the Austrian straddler Ilona Gusenbauer a year before). However, it was not until 1978 when a flopper, Sara Simeoni of Italy, broke the women's world record.\nSuccessful high jumpers following Fosbury's lead also included the rival of Dwight Stones, -tall Franklin Jacobs of Paterson, New Jersey, who cleared 2.32\u00a0m (), over his head (a feat equalled 27 years later by Stefan Holm of Sweden); Chinese record-setters Ni-chi Chin and Zhu Jianhua; Germans Gerd Wessig and Dietmar M\u00f6genburg; Swedish Olympic medalist and former world record holder Patrik Sj\u00f6berg; female jumpers Ulrike Meyfarth of West Germany and Sara Simeoni of Italy.\nIn spite of this, the straddle technique did not disappear at once. In 1977, the 18-year-old Soviet straddler Vladimir Yashchenko set a new world record 2.33\u00a0m (). In 1978, he raised the record to 2.34\u00a0m (), and 2.35\u00a0m () indoor, just before a knee injury effectively ended his career when he was only 20 years old. In the female side, the straddler Rosemarie Ackermann of East Germany, who was the first female jumper ever to clear 2\u00a0m (), raised the world record from 1.95\u00a0m () to 2.00\u00a0m () during 1974 to 1977. In fact, from 2 June 1977 to 3 August 1978, almost 10 years after Fosbury's success, the men's and women's world records were still held by straddle jumpers Yashchenko and Ackermann respectively. However, they were the last world record holders using the straddle technique. Ackermann also won the gold medal of the 1976 Montreal Olympics, which was the last time for a straddle jumper (male or female) to win an Olympic medal.\nIn 1980, the Polish flopper, 1976 Olympic gold medalist Jacek Wszo\u0142a, broke Yashchenko's world record at 2.35\u00a0m (). Two years before, the female Italian flopper Sara Simeoni, the long-term rival of Ackermann, broke Ackermann's world record at 2.01\u00a0m () and became the first female flopper to break the women's world record. She also won the gold medal of the 1980 Moscow Olympics, where Ackermann placed fourth. Since then, the flop style has been completely dominant. All other techniques were almost extinct in serious high jump competitions after late 1980s.\nTechnical aspects.\nTechnique and form have evolved greatly over the history of high jump. The Fosbury Flop is considered the most efficient way for competitors to propel themselves over the bar.\nApproach.\nFor a Fosbury Flop, depending on the athlete's jump foot, they start on the right or left of the high jump mat, placing their jump foot farthest away from the mat. They take an eight- to ten-step approach, with the first three to five steps being in a straight line and the last five being on a curve. The approach angle is critical for optimal height. Athletes generally mark their approach in order to find as much consistency as possible.\nThe straight run builds the momentum and sets the tone for a jump. The athlete starts by pushing off their takeoff foot with slow, powerful steps, then begins to accelerate. They should be running upright by the end of the straight portion.\nThe athlete's takeoff foot will be landing on the first step of the curve, and they will continue to accelerate, focusing their body towards the opposite back corner of the high jump mat. While staying erect and leaning away from the mat, the athlete takes their final two steps flat-footed, rolling from the heel to the toe.\nMost great straddle jumpers run at angles of about 30 to 40 degrees. The length of the run is determined by the speed of the approach. A slower run requires about eight strides, but a faster high jumper might need about 13 strides. Greater speed allows a greater part of the body's forward momentum to be converted upward.\nThe J approach favored by Fosbury floppers allows for speed, the ability to turn in the air (centripetal force), and a good takeoff position, which helps turn horizontal momentum into vertical momentum. The approach should be a hard, controlled stride so that the athlete does not fall from running at an angle. Athletes should lean into the curve from their ankles, not their hips. This allows their hips to rotate during takeoff, which in turn allows their center of gravity to pass under the bar.\nTakeoff.\nThe takeoff can be double-arm or single-arm. In both cases, the plant foot should be the foot farthest from the bar, angled towards the opposite back corner of the mat, as they drive up the knee on their non-takeoff leg. This is accompanied by a one- or two-arm swing while driving the knee.\nUnlike the straddle technique, where the takeoff foot is \"planted\" in the same spot regardless of the height of the bar, flop-style jumpers must adjust their approach run as the bar is raised so that their takeoff spot is slightly farther out from the bar. Jumpers attempting to reach record heights commonly fail when most of their energy is directed into the vertical effort and they knock the bar off the standards with the backs of their legs as they stall.\nAn effective approach shape can be derived from physics. For example, the rate of backward spin required as the jumper crosses the bar in order to facilitate shoulder clearance on the way up and foot clearance on the way down can be determined by computer simulation. This rotation rate can be back-calculated to determine the required angle of lean away from the bar at the moment of planting, based on how long the jumper is on the takeoff foot. This information, together with the jumper's speed, can be used to calculate the radius of the curved part of the approach. One can also work in the opposite direction by assuming a certain approach radius and determining the resulting backward rotation.\nDrills can be practiced to solidify the approach. One drill is to run in a straight line and then run two to three circles spiraling into one another. Another is to run or skip a circle of any size two or three times in a row. It is important to leap upwards without first leaning into the bar, allowing the momentum of the J approach to carry the body across the bar.\nFlight.\nThe knee on the athlete's non-takeoff leg naturally turns their body, placing them in the air with their back to the bar. The athlete then drives their shoulders towards the back of their feet, arching their body over the bar. They can look over their shoulder to judge when to kick both feet over their head, causing their body to clear the bar and land on the mat.\nAll-time top 25.\nMen (indoor).\n\"Only one performance (best) per athlete\"\nWomen (indoor).\n\"Only one performance (best) per athlete\"\nAthletes with most medals.\nAthletes who have won multiple titles at the two most important competitions, the Olympic Games and the World Championships:\nKostadinova, Sotomayor and Mahuchikh are the only high jumpers to have been Olympic Champion, World Champion and broken the world record.\nSeason's bests.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Col-begin/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "13792", "revid": "15484855", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=13792", "title": "Heraclitus", "text": "Greek philosopher (late 6th/early 5th-century BC)\nHeraclitus (; ; fl. c.\u2009500 BC) was an ancient Greek pre-Socratic philosopher from the city of Ephesus, which was then part of the Persian Empire. He exerts a wide influence on Western philosophy, both ancient and modern, through the works of such authors as Plato, Aristotle, Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel, Friedrich Nietzsche, and Martin Heidegger.\nLittle is known of Heraclitus's life. He wrote a single work, of which only fragments survive. Even in ancient times, his paradoxical philosophy, appreciation for wordplay, and cryptic, oracular epigrams earned him the epithets \"the dark\" and \"the obscure\". He was considered arrogant and depressed, a misanthrope who was subject to melancholia. Consequently, he became known as \"the weeping philosopher\" in contrast to the ancient atomist philosopher Democritus, who was known as \"the laughing philosopher\".\nThe central ideas of Heraclitus's philosophy are the unity of opposites and the concept of change. Heraclitus saw harmony and justice in strife. He viewed the world as constantly in flux, always \"becoming\" but never \"being\". He expressed this in sayings like \"Everything flows\" (, \"panta rhei\") and \"No man ever steps in the same river twice\". This insistence upon change contrasts with that of the ancient philosopher Parmenides, who believed in a reality of static \"being\".\nHeraclitus believed fire was the \"arche\", the fundamental stuff of the world. In choosing an \"arche\" Heraclitus followed the Milesians before him \u2014 Thales of Miletus with water, Anaximander with \"apeiron\" (\"boundless\" or \"infinite\"), and Anaximenes of Miletus with air. Heraclitus also thought the \"logos\" (word, discourse, or reason) gave structure to the world or existed as a kind of divine law.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:TOC limit/styles.css\" /&gt;\nLife.\nHeraclitus, the son of Blyson, was from the Ionian city of Ephesus, a port on the Cayster River, on the western coast of Asia Minor (modern-day Turkey). In the 6th century BC, Ephesus, like other cities in Ionia, lived under the effects of both the rise of Lydia under Croesus and his overthrow by Cyrus the Great c. 547 BC. Ephesus appears to have subsequently cultivated a close relationship with the Persian Empire; during the suppression of the Ionian revolt by Darius the Great in 494 BC, Ephesus was spared and emerged as the dominant Greek city in Ionia. Miletus, the home of the previous philosophers, was captured and sacked.\nThe main source for the life of Heraclitus is the doxographer Diogenes La\u00ebrtius. Although most of the information provided by Laertius is unreliable, and the ancient stories about Heraclitus are thought to be later fabrications based on interpretations of the preserved fragments; the anecdote that Heraclitus relinquished the hereditary title of \"king\" to his younger brother may at least imply that Heraclitus was from an aristocratic family in Ephesus. Heraclitus appears to have had little sympathy for democracy or the masses. However, it is unclear whether he was \"an unconditional partisan of the rich\", or if, like the sage Solon, he was \"withdrawn from competing factions\".\nSince antiquity, Heraclitus has been labeled a solitary figure and an arrogant misanthrope. The skeptic Timon of Phlius called Heraclitus a \"mob-abuser\" (\"ochloloidoros\"). Heraclitus considered himself self-taught. He criticized fools for being \"put in a flutter by every word\". He did not consider others incapable, but unwilling: \"And though reason is common, most people live as though they had an understanding peculiar to themselves.\" Heraclitus did not seem to like the prevailing religion of the time, criticizing the popular mystery cults, blood sacrifice, and prayer to statues. He also did not believe in funeral rites, saying \"Corpses are more fit to be cast out than dung.\" He further criticized Homer, Hesiod, Pythagoras, Xenophanes, and Hecataeus. He endorsed the sage Bias of Priene, who is quoted as saying \"Most men are bad\". He praised a man named Hermodorus as the best among the Ephesians, who he says should all kill themselves for exiling him.\nHeraclitus is traditionally considered to have flourished in the 69th Olympiad (504\u2013501 BC), but this date may simply be based on a prior account synchronizing his life with the reign of Darius the Great. However, this date can be considered \"roughly accurate\" based on a fragment that references Pythagoras, Xenophanes, and Hecataeus as older contemporaries, placing him near the end of the sixth century BC.\nAccording to Diogenes Laertius, Heraclitus died covered in dung after failing to cure himself from dropsy. This may be to parody his doctrine that for souls it is death to become water, and that a dry soul is best.\n\"On Nature\".\nHeraclitus is said to have produced a single work on papyrus, which has not survived; however, over 100 fragments of this work survive in quotations by other authors. The title is unknown, but many later writers refer to this work, and works by other pre-Socratics, as \"On Nature\". According to Diogenes La\u00ebrtius, Heraclitus deposited the book in the Artemision as a dedication. It was available at least until the 2nd century AD, when Plutarch and Clement quote directly from it, if not later. Yet by the 6th-century, Simplicius of Cilicia, who mentions Heraclitus 32 times in his Commentaries on Aristotle, never quotes from him, implying that Heraclitus's work was so rare that it was apparently unavailable even to the Neoplatonist philosophers at the Platonic Academy in Athens.\nThe opening lines are quoted by Sextus Empiricus:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Of the \"logos\" being forever do men prove to be uncomprehending, both before they hear and once they have heard it. For although all things happen according to this \"logos\" they are like the unexperienced experiencing words and deeds such as I explain when I distinguish each thing according to its nature and declare how it is. Other men are unaware of what they do when they are awake just as they are forgetful of what they do when they are asleep.\nStructure.\nScholar Martin Litchfield West claims that while the existing fragments do not give much of an idea of the overall structure, the beginning of the discourse can probably be determined. \nDiogenes La\u00ebrtius wrote that the book was divided into three parts: the universe, politics, and theology, but, classicists have challenged that division. Classicist John Burnet has argued that \"it is not to be supposed that this division is due to [Heraclitus] himself; all we can infer is that the work fell naturally into these parts when the Stoic commentators took their editions of it in hand\". The Stoics divided their own philosophy into three parts: ethics, logic, and physics. The Stoic Cleanthes further divided philosophy into dialectics, rhetoric, ethics, politics, physics, and theology, and philologist Karl Deichgr\u00e4ber has argued the last three are the same as the alleged division of Heraclitus. The philosopher Paul Schuster has argued the division came from the \"Pinakes\".\nStyle.\nHeraclitus's style has been compared to a Sibyl, who \"with raving lips uttering things mirthless, unbedizened, and unperfumed, reaches over a thousand years with her voice, thanks to the god in her\". \nHeraclitus also seems to have patterned his style after oracles. Heraclitus wrote \"nature loves to hide\" and \"a hidden connection is stronger than an obvious one\". He also wrote \"The lord whose oracle is in Delphi neither speaks nor conceals, but gives a sign.\" Heraclitus is the earliest known literary reference for the Delphic maxim to know thyself.\nKahn characterized the main features of Heraclitus's writing as \"linguistic density\", meaning that single words and phrases have multiple meanings, and \"resonance\", meaning that expressions evoke one another. Heraclitus used literary devices like alliteration and chiasmus.\nThe Obscure.\nAristotle quotes part of the opening line of Heraclitus's work in the \"Rhetoric\" to outline the difficulty in punctuating Heraclitus without ambiguity; he debated whether \"forever\" applied to \"being\" or to \"prove\". Aristotle's successor at the lyceum Theophrastus says about Heraclitus that \"some parts of his work [are] half-finished, while other parts [made] a strange medley\". Theophrastus thought an inability to finish the work showed Heraclitus was melancholic.\nDiogenes La\u00ebrtius relays the story that the playwright Euripides gave Socrates a copy of Heraclitus's work and asked for his opinion. Socrates replied: \"The part I understand is excellent, and so too is, I dare say, the part I do not understand; but it needs a Delian diver to get to the bottom of it.\"\nAlso according to Diogenes La\u00ebrtius, Timon of Phlius called Heraclitus \"the Riddler\" (; ). Timon said Heraclitus wrote his book \"rather unclearly\" (; ); according to Timon, this was intended to allow only the \"capable\" to attempt it. \nBy the time of the pseudo-Aristotelian treatise \"De Mundo\", this epithet became in Greek \"The Dark\" (; ). In Latin this became \"The Obscure\". According to Cicero, Heraclitus had spoken \"nimis obscur\u0113\" (\"too obscurely\") concerning nature and had done so deliberately in order to be misunderstood. According to Plotinus, it was \"probably with the idea that it is for us to seek within ourselves, as he sought for himself and found\".\nPhilosophy.\nHeraclitus has been the subject of numerous interpretations. According to scholar Daniel W. Graham, Heraclitus has been seen as a \"material monist or a process philosopher; a scientific cosmologist, a metaphysician and a religious thinker; an empiricist, a rationalist, a mystic; a conventional thinker and a revolutionary; a developer of logic \u2013\u00a0one who denied the law of non-contradiction; the first genuine philosopher and an anti-intellectual obscurantist\".\nUnity of opposites and flux.\nThe hallmarks of Heraclitus's philosophy are the unity of opposites and change, or flux. According to Aristotle, Heraclitus was a dialetheist, or one who denies the law of noncontradiction (a logical principle which states that something cannot be true and false at the same time). Also according to Aristotle, Heraclitus was a materialist. Attempting to follow Aristotle's hylomorphic interpretation, scholar W. K. C. Guthrie interprets the distinction between flux and stability as one between matter and form. On this view, Heraclitus is a flux theorist because he is a materialist who believes matter always changes. There are no unchanging forms like with Plato or Aristotle. As one author puts it, \"Plato took flux as the greatest warning against materialism\".\nSeveral fragments seem to relate to the unity of opposites. For example: \"The straight and the crooked path of the fuller's comb is one and the same\"; \"The way up is the way down\"; \"Beginning and end, on a circle's circumference, are common\"; and \"Thou shouldst unite things whole and things not whole, that which tends to unite and that which tends to separate, the harmonious and the discordant; from all things arises the one, and from the one all things.\"\nOver time, the opposites change into each other: \"Mortals are immortals and immortals are mortals, the one living the others' death and dying the others' life\"; \"As the same thing in us is living and dead, waking and sleeping, young and old. For these things having changed around are those, and those in turn having changed around are these\"; and \"Cold things warm up, the hot cools off, wet becomes dry, dry becomes wet.\"\nIt also seems they change into each other depending on one's point of view, a case of relativism or perspectivism. Heraclitus states: \"Disease makes health sweet and good; hunger, satiety; toil, rest.\" While men drink and wash with water, fish prefer to drink saltwater, pigs prefer to wash in mud, and fowls prefer to wash in dust. \"Oxen are happy when they find bitter vetches to eat\" and \"asses would rather have refuse than gold\".\n\"Panta rhei\".\nDiogenes La\u00ebrtius summarizes Heraclitus's philosophy as follows: \"All things come into being by conflict of opposites, and the sum of things ( \"ta hola\" ('the whole')) flows like a stream.\" Classicist Jonathan Barnes states that \"Panta rhei, 'everything flows' is probably the most familiar of Heraclitus's sayings, yet few modern scholars think he said it\". Barnes observes that although the \"exact\" phrase was not ascribed to Heraclitus until the 6th century by Simplicius, a similar saying expressing the same idea, \"panta chorei\", or \"everything moves\" is ascribed to Heraclitus by Plato in the \"Cratylus\".\nYou cannot step into the same river twice.\nSince Plato, Heraclitus's theory of flux has been associated with the metaphor of a flowing river, which cannot be stepped into twice. This fragment from Heraclitus's writings has survived in three different forms:\nThe classicist Karl Reinhardt identified the first river quote as the genuine one. The river fragments (especially the second \"we both are and are not\") seem to suggest not only is the river constantly changing, but we do as well, perhaps commenting on existential questions about humanity and personhood.\nScholars such as Reinhardt also interpreted the metaphor as illustrating what is stable, rather than the usual interpretation of illustrating change. Classicist Karl-Martin Dietz has said: \"You will not find anything, in which the river remains constant\u00a0... Just the fact, that there is a particular river bed, that there is a source and an estuary etc. is something, that stays identical. And this is\u00a0... the concept of a river.\" According to American philosopher W. V. O. Quine, the river parable illustrates that the river is a process through time. One cannot step twice into the same river-stage.\nProfessor M. M. McCabe has argued that the three statements on rivers should all be read as fragments from a discourse. McCabe suggests reading them as though they arose in succession. The three fragments \"could be retained, and arranged in an argumentative sequence\". In McCabe's reading of the fragments, Heraclitus can be read as a philosopher capable of sustained argument, rather than just aphorism.\nStrife is justice.\nHeraclitus said \"strife is justice\" and \"all things take place by strife\". He called the opposites in conflict (), \"strife\", and theorized that the apparently unitary state, (), \"justice\", results in \"the most beautiful harmony\", in contrast to Anaximander, who described the same as injustice.\nAristotle said that Heraclitus disagreed with Homer because Homer wished that strife would leave the world, which according to Heraclitus would destroy the world; \"there would be no harmony without high and low notes, and no animals without male and female, which are opposites\". It may also explain why he disagreed with the Pythagorean emphasis on harmony, but not on strife.\nHeraclitus suggests that the world and its various parts are kept together through the tension produced by the unity of opposites, like the string of a bow or a lyre. On one account, this is the earliest use of the concept of force. A quote about the bow shows his appreciation for wordplay: \"The bow's name is life, but its work is death.\" Each substance contains its opposite, making for a continual circular exchange of generation, destruction, and motion that results in the stability of the world. This can be illustrated by the quote \"Even the \"kykeon\" separates if it is not stirred.\"\nAccording to Abraham Schoener: \"War is the central principle in Heraclitus' thought.\" Another of Heraclitus's famous sayings highlights the idea that the unity of opposites is also a conflict of opposites: \"War is father of all and king of all; and some he manifested as gods, some as men; some he made slaves, some free\"; war is a creative tension that brings things into existence. Heraclitus says further \"Gods and men honour those slain in war\"; \"Greater deaths gain greater portions\"; and \"Every beast is tended by blows.\"\n\"Logos\".\nA core concept for Heraclitus is \"logos\", an ancient Greek word literally meaning \"word, speech, discourse, or meaning\". For Heraclitus, the \"logos\" seems to designate the rational structure or ordered composition of the world. It also seems to be a kind of divine law, which one hears. As well as the opening quote of his book, one fragment reads: \"Listening not to me but to the \"logos\", it is wise to agree (\"homologein\") that all things are one.\" Another fragment reads: \"[\"hoi polloi\"] ... do not know how to listen [to \"Logos\"] or how to speak [the truth].\"\nThe word \"logos\" has a wide variety of other uses, such that Heraclitus might have a different meaning of the word for each usage in his book. Kahn has argued that Heraclitus used the word in multiple senses, whereas Guthrie has argued that there is no evidence Heraclitus used it in a way that was significantly different from that in which it was used by contemporaneous speakers of Greek.\nProfessor Michael Stokes interprets Heraclitus's use of \"logos\" as a public fact like a proposition or formula; like Guthrie, he views Heraclitus as a materialist, so he grants Heraclitus would not have considered these as abstract objects or immaterial things. Another possibility is the \"logos\" referred to the truth, or to the book itself. Classicist Walther Kranz translated it as \"sense\".\nHeraclitus's \"logos\" doctrine may also be the origin of the doctrine of natural law. Heraclitus stated \"People ought to fight to keep their law as to defend the city walls. For all human laws get nourishment from the one divine law.\" \"Far from arguing like the latter Sophists, that the human law, because it is a conventional law, deserves to be abandoned in favor of the law of nature, Herakleitos argued that the human law partakes of the law of nature, which is at the same time a divine law.\"\nFire as the \"arche\".\nThe Milesians before Heraclitus had a view called material monism which conceived of certain elements as the \"arche\" \u2013 Thales with water, Anaximander with \"apeiron\", and Anaximenes with air. Since antiquity, philosophers have concluded that Heraclitus construed of fire as the \"arche\", the ultimate reality or the fundamental element that gave rise to the other elements. Pre-Socratic scholar Eduard Zeller has argued that Heraclitus believed that heat in general and dry exhalation in particular, rather than visible fire, was the \"arche\". \nIn one fragment, Heraclitus writes:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;This world-order (\"kosmos\"), the same for all, no god nor man did create, but it ever was and is and will be: ever-living fire, kindling in measures and being quenched in measures.\nThis is the oldest extant quote using \"kosmos\", or order, to mean the world. Heraclitus seems to say fire is the one thing eternal in the universe. From fire all things originate and all things return again in a process of never-ending cycles. Plato and Aristotle attribute to Heraclitus a periodic destruction of the world by a great conflagration, known as \"ekpyrosis,\" which happens every Great Year \u2013 according to Plato, every 36,000 years.\nHeraclitus more than once describes the transformations to and from fire:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Fire lives the death of earth, and air lives the death of fire; water lives the death of air, and earth that of water.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The turnings of fire: first sea, and of sea half is earth, half fireburst. [Earth] is liquefied as sea and measured into the same proportion as it had before it became earth.\nFire as symbolic.\nHowever, it is also argued by many that Heraclitus never identified fire as the \"arche\"; rather, he only used fire to explain his notion of flux, as the basic stuff which changes or moves the most. Others conclude he used it as the physical form of \"logos\".\nOn yet another interpretation, Heraclitus is not a material monist explicating flux nor stability, but a revolutionary process philosopher who chooses fire in an attempt to say there is no \"arche\". Fire is a symbol or metaphor for change, rather than the basic stuff which changes the most. Perspectives of this sort emphasize his statements on change such as \"The way up is the way down\", as well as the quote \"All things are an exchange for Fire, and Fire for all things, even as wares for gold and gold for wares\", which has been understood as stating that while all can be transformed into fire, not everything comes from fire, just as not everything comes from gold.\nCosmology.\nWhile considered an ancient cosmologist, Heraclitus did not seem as interested in astronomy, meteorology, or mathematics as his predecessors. It is surmised Heraclitus believed that the earth was flat and extended infinitely in all directions.\nHeraclitus held all things occur according to fate. He said \"Time (\"Aion\") is a child playing draughts, the kingly power is a child's.\" It is disputed whether this means time and life is determined by rules like a game, by conflict like a game, or by arbitrary whims of the gods like a child plays.\nSun.\nSimilar to his views on rivers, Heraclitus believed \"the Sun is new each day.\" He also said the Sun never sets. According to Bertrand Russell, this was \"obviously inspired by scientific reflection, and no doubt seemed to him to obviate the difficulty of understanding how the sun can work its way underground from west to east during the night\". The physician Galen explains: \"Heraclitus says that the sun is a burning mass, kindled at its rising, and quenched at its setting.\"\nHeraclitus also believed that the Sun is as large as it looks, and said Hesiod \"did not know night and day, for they are one.\" However, he also explained the phenomenon of day and night by if the Sun \"oversteps his measures\", then \"Erinyes, the ministers of Justice, will find him out\". Heraclitus further wrote the Sun is in charge of the seasons.\nMoon.\nOn one account, Heraclitus believed the Sun and Moon were bowls containing fire, with lunar phases explained by the turning of the bowl. His study of the moon near the end of the month is contained in one of the Oxyrhynchus Papyri, a group of manuscripts found in an ancient landfill. This is the best evidence of Heraclitean astronomy.\nGod.\nHeraclitus said \"thunderbolt steers all things\", a rare comment on meteorology and likely a reference to Zeus as the supreme being. Even his theology proves contradictory: \"One being, the only wise one, would and would not be called by the name of Zeus.\" He invokes relativism with the divine too: God sees man the same way man sees children and apes; and he seems to give a theodicy, \"for god all things are fair and good and just, but men suppose that some are unjust and others just\". Yet another interpretation for Heraclitus's use of fire is it refers to the sun god, Apollo; \"The lord whose oracle is in Delphi.\" \nAccording to one writer, \"When Heraclitus speaks of \"God\" he does not mean a single deity as an omnipotent and omniscient or God as Creator, the universe being eternal; he meant the divine as opposed to human, the immortal as opposed to the mortal, and the cyclical as opposed to the transient. Thus, it is arguably more accurate to speak of \"the Divine\" and not of \"God\".\nIn \"Parts of Animals\", Aristotle relays this story: \"Heraclitus, when the strangers who came to visit him found him warming himself at the furnace in the kitchen and hesitated to go in, reported to have bidden them not to be afraid to enter, as even in that kitchen divinities were present, so we should venture on the study of every kind of animal without distaste; for each and all will reveal to us something natural and something beautiful.\"\nThe phrase \u1f26\u03b8\u03bf\u03c2 \u1f00\u03bd\u03b8\u03c1\u03ce\u03c0\u1ff3 \u03b4\u03b1\u03af\u03bc\u03c9\u03bd (\"ethos anthropoi daimon\") is attributed to Heraclitus. It is variously translated as \"a man's character is his fate\", \"character is destiny\", or perhaps most literally as \"a man's character is his guardian divinity.\" The word \"ethos\" means \"character\", while \"daimon\" has various meanings, one of which being \"the power controlling the destiny of individuals: hence, one's lot or fortune.\"\nThe Soul.\nHeraclitus believed the soul (\"psyche\") was complex, stating: \"The limits of the soul you could not discover, though traversing every path.\" Heraclitus regarded the soul as a mixture of fire and water, and believed that fire was the noble part of the soul and water the ignoble part. He considered mastery of one's worldly desires to be a noble pursuit that purified the soul's fire, while drunkenness damages the soul by causing it to be moist. Heraclitus seems to advise against anger: \"It is hard to fight with anger, for what it wants it buys at the price of the soul.\"\nHeraclitus associates being awake with comprehension; as Sextus Empiricus explains \"It is by drawing in this divine reason in respiration that we become endowed with mind and in sleep we become forgetful, but in waking we regain our senses. For in sleep the passages of perception are shut, and hence the mind\u00a0... the only thing preserved is the connection through breathing.\" Heraclitus stated: \"If all things should become smoke, then perception would be by the nostrils\".\nHeraclitus compares the soul to a spider and the body to the web. Heraclitus believed the soul is what unifies the body and also what grants linguistic understanding, departing from Homer's conception of it as merely the breath of life. Heraclitus ridicules Homer's conception of souls in the afterlife as shades by saying \"Souls smell in Hades\". His own views on the afterlife remain unclear, but Heraclitus did state: \"There await men after they are dead things which they do not expect or imagine.\"\nThe Aristotelian tradition is responsible for a great part of the transmission of Heraclitus's physical conception of the soul. Aristotle wrote in \"De Anima\": \"Heraclitus too says that the first principle\u2014the 'warm exhalation' of which, according to him, everything else is composed\u2014is soul; further, that this exhalation is most incorporeal and in ceaseless flux\".\nForeign influence.\nHeraclitus's originality and placement near the beginning of Greek philosophy has resulted in several writers looking for possible influence from the surrounding nations.\nPersia.\nThe Persian Empire had a close connection with Ephesus and Zoroastrianism was the state religion of the Persian Empire. Heraclitus's emphasis on fire has been investigated for influence from Zoroastrian fire worship and specifically the concept of \"Atar\". While many of the doctrines of Zoroastrian fire do not match exactly with those of Heraclitus, such as the relation of fire to earth, it is still argued he may have taken some inspiration from them. Zoroastrian parallels to Heraclitus are often difficult to identify specifically due to a lack of surviving Zoroastrian literature from the period and mutual influence with Greek philosophy.\nIndia.\nThe interchange of other elements with fire has parallels in Vedic literature from the same time period, such as the Upanishads. The \"Brihadaranyaka Upanishad\" states that \"Death is fire and the food of water\" and the \"Taittiriya Upanishad\" states \"from wind fire, from fire water, from water earth.\" Heraclitus may have also been influenced by a Vedic meditation known as the \"Doctrine of the Five Fires.\" West however stresses that these doctrines of the interchange of elements were common throughout written works on philosophy that have survived from that period; so Heraclitus's doctrine of fire can not be definitively said to have been influenced by any other particular Iranian or Indian influence, but may have been part of a mutual interchange of influence over time across the Ancient Near East.\nEgypt.\nPhilosopher Gustav Teichm\u00fcller sought to prove Heraclitus was influenced by the Egyptians, either directly, by reading the \"Book of the Dead\", or indirectly through the Greek mystery cults. \"As the sun of Heraclitus was daily generated from water, so Horus, as Ra of the sun, daily proceeded from Lotus the water.\" Paul Tannery took up Teichm\u00fcller's interpretation. They both thought Heraclitus's book was an offering to the temple to be read only by few initiates, rather than deposited in the temple to the public for safe-keeping. Edmund Pfleiderer argued that Heraclitus was influenced by the mystery cults. He interprets Heraclitus's apparent condemning of the mystery cults as the condemning of abuses rather than the idea itself.\nLegacy.\nHeraclitus's writings have exerted a wide influence on Western philosophy, including the works of Plato and Aristotle, who interpreted him in terms of their own doctrines.\nHis influence also extends into art, literature, and even medicine, as writings in the Hippocratic corpus show signs of Heraclitean themes. Heraclitus is also considered a potential source for understanding the Ancient Greek religion since the discovery of the Derveni papyrus, an Orphic poem which contains two fragments of Heraclitus.\nAncient.\nPre-Socratics.\nIt is unknown whether or not Heraclitus had any students in his lifetime. Diogenes Laertius states Heraclitus's book \"won so great a fame that there arose followers of him called Heracliteans.\" Scholars took this to mean Heraclitus had no disciples and became renowned only after his death. According to one author, \"The school of disciples founded by Heraclitus flourished for long after his death\". According to another, \"there were no doubt other Heracliteans whose names are now lost to us\".\nIn his dialogue \"Cratylus\", Plato presented Cratylus as a Heraclitean and as a linguistic naturalist who believed that names must apply naturally to their objects. According to Aristotle, Cratylus went a step beyond his master's doctrine and said that one cannot step into the same river once. He took the view that nothing can be said about the ever-changing world and \"ended by thinking that one need not say anything, and only moved his finger\". To explain both characterizations by Plato and Aristotle, Cratylus may have thought continuous change warrants skepticism because one cannot define a thing that does not have a permanent nature. Diogenes Laertius also lists an otherwise historically obscure Antisthenes who wrote a commentary on Heraclitus.\nThe Pythagorean and comic writer Epicharmus of Kos has fragments which seem to reproduce the thought of Heraclitus, and wrote a play titled \"Heraclitus\".\nEleatics.\nParmenides of Elea, a philosopher and near-contemporary, proposed a doctrine of changelessness, in contrast to the doctrine of flux put forth by Heraclitus. He is generally agreed to either have influenced or been influenced by Heraclitus. Different philosophers have argued that either one of them may have substantially influenced each other, some taking Heraclitus to be responding to Parmenides, but more often Parmenides is seen as responding to Heraclitus. Some also argue that any direct chain of influence between the two is impossible to determine. Although Heraclitus refers to older figures such as Pythagoras, neither Parmenides or Heraclitus refer to each other by name in any surviving fragments, so any speculation on influence must be based on interpretation.\nPluralists and atomists.\nThe surviving fragments of several other pre-Socratic philosophers show Heraclitean themes. Diogenes of Apollonia thought the action of one thing on another meant they were made of one substance. The pluralists may have been influenced by Heraclitus. The philosopher Anaxagoras refuses to separate the opposites in the \"one cosmos\". Empedocles has forces (arguably the first since Heraclitus's tension) which are in opposition, known as Love and Hate, or more accurately, Harmony and Strife. Democritus and the atomists were also influenced by Heraclitus. The atomists and Heraclitus both believed that everything was in motion. On one interpretation: \"Essentially what the atomists did was try to find a middle-way between the contradictory philosophical schemes of Heraclitus and Parmenides.\"\nSophists.\nThe sophists, including Protagoras of Abdera and Gorgias of Leontini, may also have been influenced by Heraclitus. Sophists in general seemed to share Heraclitus's conception of the \"logos\". One tradition associated the sophists' concern with politics and preventing party strife with Heraclitus.Heraclitus and others used \"measure\" to mean the balance and order of nature; hence Protagoras' famous statement \"man is the measure of all things\". In Plato's dialogue \"Theaetetus\", Socrates sees Protagoras's \"man is the measure\" doctrine and Theaetetus' hypothesis that \"knowledge is perception\" as justified by Heraclitean flux.\nGorgias seems to have been influenced by the \"logos\", when he argued in his work \"On Non-Being\", possibly parodying the Eleatics, that being cannot exist or be communicated. According to one author, Gorgias \"in a sense ... completes Heraclitus.\"\nClassical and Hellenistic philosophy.\nPlato knew of the teachings of Heraclitus through the Heraclitean philosopher Cratylus. Plato held that for Heraclitus knowledge is made impossible by the flux of sensible objects, and thus the need for the imperceptible Forms as objects of knowledge.\nScythinus of Teos, a contemporary of Plato, wrote out Heraclitus's philosophy in verse. A four-volume work on Heraclitus was written by the academic Heraclides Ponticus, but has not survived. Plutarch also wrote a lost treatise on Heraclitus. The Neoplatonists were influenced by Heraclitus on the topic of the One; quoting Plotinus \"Heraclitus, with his sense of bodily forms as things of ceaseless process and passage, knows the One as eternal and intellectual.\"\nAristotle accused Heraclitus of denying the law of noncontradiction, and charges that he thereby failed in his reasoning. However, Aristotle's material monist and world conflagration (\"ekpyrosis\") interpretation of Heraclitus influenced the Stoics.\nStoics.\nThe Stoics believed major tenets of their philosophy derived from the thought of Heraclitus; especially the \"logos,\" used to support their belief that rational law governs the universe. Scholar A. A. Long concludes the earliest Stoic fragments are \"modifications of Heraclitus\". According to philosopher Philip Hallie, \"Heraclitus of Ephesus was the father of Stoic physics.\"\nA four-volume work titled \"Interpretation of Heraclitus\" was written by the Stoic philosopher Cleanthes, but has not survived. In surviving stoic writings, Heraclitean influence is most evident in the writings of Marcus Aurelius. Marcus Aurelius understood the \"Logos\" as \"the account which governs everything\". Heraclitus also states, \"We should not act and speak like children of our parents\", which Marcus Aurelius interpreted to mean one should not simply accept what others believe.\nMany of the later Stoics interpreted the \"logos\" as the \"arche\", as a creative fire that ran through all things due to sunlight; West observes that Plato, Aristotle, Theophrastus, and Sextus Empiricus all make no mention of this doctrine, and concludes that the language and thought are \"obviously Stoic\" and not attributable to Heraclitus. Burnet cautions that these Stoic modifications of Heraclitus make it harder to interpret Heraclitus himself, as the Stoics ascribed their own interpretations of terms like \"logos\" and \"ekpyrosis\" to Heraclitus.\nCynics.\nThe Cynics were influenced by Heraclitus, such as by his condemnation of the mystery cults. According to one source, \"the Cynic affinity with Heraclitus lies not so much in his philosophy as in his cultural criticism and (idealised) lifestyle.\" The Cynics attributed several of the later Cynic epistles to his authorship. Heraclitus is sometimes even depicted as a cynic. \nHeraclitus' idea that most people live as if in a deep state of sleep resembles what the Cynics said about a cloud of mist or fog shrouding all of existence. \nHeraclitus wrote: \"Dogs bark at every one they do not know.\" Similarly, Diogenes the Cynic, when asked by Alexander why he considered himself a dog, responded that he \"barks at those who give me nothing\".\nPyrrhonists.\nThe skeptical philosophers known as Pyrrhonists were also influenced by Heraclitus. He may be the predecessor to Pyrrho's relativistic doctrine \"No More This than That \", that nothing is one way rather than another way. According to Pyrrhonist Sextus Empiricus, Aenesidemus, one of the major ancient Pyrrhonist philosophers, claimed in a now-lost work that Pyrrhonism was a way to Heraclitean philosophy because Pyrrhonist practice helps one to see how opposites appear to be the case about the same thing, leading to the Heraclitean view that opposites actually are true about the same thing. Sextus Empiricus disagreed, arguing opposites appearing to be the case about the same thing is not a dogma of the Pyrrhonists but a matter occurring to the Pyrrhonists, to the other philosophers, and to all of humanity.\nEarly Christianity.\nHippolytus of Rome, one of the early Church Fathers of the Christian Church, identified Heraclitus along with the other pre-Socratics and Academics as a source of heresy, in Heraclitus's case namely the heresy of Noetus. \nThe Christian apologist Justin Martyr took a more positive view of Heraclitus. In his First Apology, he said both Socrates and Heraclitus were Christians before Christ: \"those who lived reasonably are Christians, even though they have been thought atheists; as, among the Greeks, Socrates and Heraclitus, and men like them.\" He was among those who interpreted the \"logos\" as meaning the Christian \"Word of God\", such as in : \"In the beginning was the Word (\"logos\") and the Word was God.\" \nModern scholars such as John Burnet have viewed the relationship between Heraclitean \"logos\" and Johannine \"logos\" as fallacious, saying; \"the Johannine doctrine of the \"logos\" has nothing to do with Herakleitos or with anything at all in Greek philosophy, but comes from the Hebrew Wisdom literature\".\nThe Christian Clement of Alexandria notes Heraclitus's similarity to the Christian prophets, and is cited as a source for more Heraclitus fragments than any other author.\nWeeping philosopher.\nHeraclitus's influence also extends outside of philosophy. A motif found in art and literature is Heraclitus as the \"weeping philosopher\" and Democritus as the \"laughing philosopher\", which may have originated with the Cynic philosopher Menippus, and generally references their reactions to the folly of mankind.\nFor example, in Lucian of Samosata's \"Philosophies for Sale\", Heraclitus is auctioned off as the \"weeping philosopher\" and Democritus as the \"laughing philosopher\". The Roman poet Juvenal wrote: \"Heraclitus, weep at life much more than you did while alive, for now life is more pitiable.\"\nThe Renaissance saw a revived interest in ancient philosophy and its depiction in art. A fresco on the wall of Marsilio Ficino's Platonic Academy in Florence depicted Heraclitus and Democritus.\nDonato Bramante painted Heraclitus and Democritus (1486) as the weeping and laughing philosopher, and may have depicted Heraclitus as Leonardo da Vinci. Heraclitus appears in painter Raphael's \"School of Athens\" (1511), in which he is represented by Michelangelo, since they shared a \"sour temper and bitter scorn for all rivals\".\nModern.\nModern interest in early Greek philosophy can be traced back to 1573, when French printer Henri Estienne (also known as Henricus Stephanus) collected a number of pre-Socratic fragments, including some forty of those of Heraclitus, and published them in Latin in \"Poesis philosophica.\" Renaissance skeptic Michel de Montaigne's essay \"On Democritus and Heraclitus,\" in which he sided with the laughing philosopher over the weeping philosopher, was probably written soon after. Heraclitus also influenced French poets Michel d'Ambroise and Etienne Forcadel. Huguenot minister Pierre du Moulin wrote \"Heraclitus, or, Meditations vpon the vanity &amp; misery of humane life\" in 1609.\nEnglish playwright William Shakespeare may have known of Heraclitus through Montaigne.\" The Merchant of Venice\" (1598) features the melancholic character of Antonio, who some critics contend is modeled after Heraclitus. Additionally, in one scene of the play Portia assesses her potential suitors, and says of one County Palatine: \"I fear he will prove the weeping philosopher when he grows old\".\nSeveral baroque artists such as Peter Paul Rubens, Hendrik ter Brugghen, and Johannes Moreelse painted Heraclitus and Democritus. Rubens' \"Heraclitus and Democritus\" (1603) was painted for the Duke of Lerma.\nRationalism.\nFrench rationalist philosopher Ren\u00e9 Descartes read Montaigne and wrote in \"The Passions of the Soul\" that indignation can be joined by pity or derision, \"So the laughter of Democritus and the tears of Heraclitus could have come from the same cause\".\nKahn suggests Spinoza may have been influenced by Heraclitus via the Stoics. According to one author \"What Heraclitus really meant by the common was...nothing different from what by Spinoza was expressed by \"sub specie aeternitatis\". According to German poet Heinrich Bl\u00fccher, \"If you read the whole system of Spinoza, it is nothing but the changed system of Heraclitus.\"\nGottfried Wilhelm Leibniz stated in \"The Monadology\" \"all bodies are in a state of perpetual flux like rivers.\"\nBritish empiricism.\nBishop and empiricist philosopher George Berkeley claimed Sir Isaac Newton's alchemy was influenced by Heraclitus. He remarked in \"Siris\": \"In Plutarch we find it was the opinion of Heraclitus, that the death of fire was a birth to air, and the death of air a birth to water. This opinion is also maintained by Sir Isaac Newton.\" Scottish skeptic David Hume seems to recapitulate Heraclitus while discussing personal identity: \"Thus as the nature of a river consists in the motion and change of parts; tho' in less than four and twenty hours these be totally alter'd; this hinders not the river from continuing the same during several ages.\"\nCommon sense.\nWhile Heraclitus seems to criticize people in general, at other times he also seems to support common sense. On Scottish common sense philosopher Thomas Reid's account, Heraclitus was one of the first to extol a common sense philosophy with such quotes as \"And though reason is common, most people live as though they had an understanding peculiar to themselves;\" and \"understanding is common to all\".\nPost-Kantianism.\nEver since German philosopher Immanuel Kant, philosophers have sometimes been divided into rationalists and empiricists. Heraclitus has been considered each by different scholars. For rationalism, philosophers cite fragments like \"Poor witnesses for men are the eyes and ears of those who have barbarian souls.\" For empiricism, they cite fragments like \"The things that can be seen, heard, and learned are what I prize the most.\" Gottlob Mayer has argued that the philosophical pessimism of Arthur Schopenhauer recapitulated the thought of Heraclitus.\nThe impression of Heraclitus on German idealist G. W. F. Hegel was so profound that he remarked in his \"Lectures on the History of Philosophy\": \"there is no proposition of Heraclitus which I have not adopted in my \"Logic\".\" Hegel interpreted Heraclitus as a dialetheist and as a process philosopher, seeing the flux or \"becoming\" in Heraclitus as a natural result of the ontology of \"being\" and \"non-being\" in Parmenides. He also doubted the world conflagration (\"ekpyrosis\") interpretation, which had been popular since Aristotle.\nHeraclitean studies.\nThe German theologian Friedrich Schleiermacher was one of the first to collect the fragments of Heraclitus specifically and write them out in his native tongue, the \"pioneer of Heraclitean studies\". Schleiermacher was also one of the first to posit Persian influence upon Heraclitus, a question taken up by succeeding scholars Friedrich Creuzer and August Gladisch.\nThe Young Hegelian and socialist Ferdinand Lassalle wrote a book on Heraclitus. \"Lassalle follows Hegel in styling the doctrine of Heraclitus 'the philosophy of the logical law of the identity of contradictories.\" Lassalle also thought Persian theology influenced Heraclitus. Fellow Young Hegelian Karl Marx compared Lasalle's work to that of \"a schoolboy\" and Vladimir Lenin accused him of \"sheer plagiarism\".\nClassical philologist Jakob Bernays also wrote a work on Heraclitus. Inspired by Bernays, the English scholar Ingram Bywater collected all fragments of Heraclitus in a critical edition, \"Heracliti Ephesii Reliquiae\" (1877). Hermann Diels wrote \"Bywater's book has come to be accounted ... as the only reliable collection of the remains of that philosopher.\" \nDiels-Kranz.\nDiels published the first edition of the authoritative \"Die Fragmente der Vorsokratiker\" (\"The Fragments of the Pre-Socratics\") in 1903, later revised and expanded three times, and finally revised in two subsequent editions by Walther Kranz. Diels\u2013Kranz is used in academia to cite pre-Socratic philosophers. In Diels\u2013Kranz, each ancient personality and each passage is assigned a number to uniquely identify it; Heraclitus is traditionally catalogued as pre-Socratic philosopher number 22.\nContinental.\nThe continental existentialist and philologist Friedrich Nietzsche preferred Heraclitus above all the other pre-Socratics. Nietzsche saw the philosophers before Plato as \"pure types\" and Heraclitus as the proud, lonely truth-finder. The nationalist philosopher of history Oswald Spengler wrote his (failed) dissertation on Heraclitus.\nPhenomenologist Edmund Husserl wrote that consciousness is \"the realm of Heraclitean flux.\" Existentialist and phenomenologist Martin Heidegger was also influenced by Heraclitus, as seen in his \"Introduction to Metaphysics\". Heidegger believed that the thinking of Heraclitus and Parmenides was the origin of philosophy and misunderstood by Plato and Aristotle, leading all of Western philosophy astray.\nFrench philosophers Jacques Derrida and Gilles Deleuze's \"differential ontology\" is influenced by Heraclitus. According to Deleuze, Michel Foucault was a Heraclitean. The idea that war produces order through strife is similar to Foucault's notion that power is a force dispersed through social relations.\nIn the 1950s, a term originating with Heraclitus, \"idios kosmos\", meaning \"private world\" as distinguished from the \"common world\" (koinos kosmos) was adopted by phenomenological and existential psychologists, such as Ludwig Binswanger and Rollo May, to refer to the experience of people with delusions. It was an important part of novelist Philip K. Dick's views on schizophrenia. Those thinkers have relied on Heraclitus's statement that \"The waking have one common world, but the sleeping turn aside each into a world of his own.\"\nThe Irish author and classicist Oscar Wilde was influenced by art critic Walter Pater, a friend of Bywater's whose \"pre-Socratic hero\" was Heraclitus. Harold Bloom noted that \"Pater praises Plato for Classic correctness, for a conservative centripetal impulse, against his [Pater's] own Heraclitean Romanticism.\" Wilde is credited with the saying \"expect the unexpected\", though Heraclitus said \"If you do not expect the unexpected, you will not find it; for it is hard to be sought out and difficult.\"\nAnalytic.\nThe British process philosopher A. N. Whitehead has been identified as a representative of the tradition of Heraclitus. In Bertrand Russell's essay \"Mysticism and Logic\", he contends Heraclitus proves himself a metaphysician by his blending of mystical and scientific impulses.\nWittgenstein.\nScholar Edward Hussey sees parallels between Heraclitus, the \"logos\", and the early Ludwig Wittgenstein's linguistic philosophy in the \"Tractatus\" (1922). Wittgenstein was known to read Plato and in his return to philosophy in 1929 he made several remarks resembling those of Heraclitus: \"The fundamental thing expressed grammatically: What about the sentence: One cannot step into the same river twice?\" He then seemed to make a dramatic shift by 1931, saying one can step twice into the same river.\nWittgenstein also uses a river image in \"On Certainty\" (1950) to say even the river-bed may change as foundational logical principles might: \"The mythology may change back into a state of flux, the river-bed of thoughts may shift\u00a0... And the bank of that river consists partly of hard rock, subject to no alteration or only to an imperceptible one, partly of sand, which now in one place now in another gets washed away or deposited.\"\nContradiction.\nAristotle's arguments for the law of non-contradiction, which he saw as refuting the position started by Heraclitus, used to be considered authoritative, but have been in doubt ever since their criticism by Polish logician Jan \u0141ukasiewicz, and the invention of many-valued and paraconsistent logics.\nSome philosophers such as Graham Priest and Jc Beall follow Heraclitus in advocating true contradictions or dialetheism, seeing it as the most natural response to the liar paradox. Jc Beall, together with Greg Restall, is a pioneer of a widely discussed version of logical pluralism.\nPhilosophy of Religion.\nBeall argues for a contradictory account of Jesus Christ as both man and divine. The philosopher Peter Geach was inspired by Heraclitus's comments on the river to formulate his idea of relative identity, which he used to defend the coherence of the Trinity.\nPhilosophy of Time.\nThe British idealist J. M. E. McTaggart is best known for his paper \"The Unreality of Time\" (1908), in which he argues that time is unreal. What he calls the \"A theory\", also known as \"temporal becoming\", and closely related to presentism, which conceives of time as tensed (i.e., having the properties of being past, present, or future), is a view which has been seen as beginning with Heraclitus. By contrast, his \" \"B theory\", under which time is tenseless (i.e., earlier than, simultaneous to, or later than), has similarly been seen as beginning with Parmenides.\nNotes.\nExplanatory notes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFragment numbers.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\nAncient sources.\nThis article uses the Diels\u2013Kranz numbering system from \"Die Fragmente der Vorsokratiker\" (\"The Fragments of the Pre-Socratics\") for testimony (labeled A), fragments (labeled B), and imitation (labeled C).\nTestimony.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFragments.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nImitation.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nModern scholarship.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "13793", "revid": "39151475", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=13793", "title": "Harrison Schmitt", "text": "American politician, astronaut and lunar explorer (born 1935)\nHarrison Hagan \"Jack\" Schmitt (born July 3, 1935) is an American geologist, former NASA astronaut, university professor, and former U.S. senator from New Mexico. He is the most recent living person\u2014and only person without a background in military aviation\u2014to have walked on the Moon.\nIn December 1972, as a crewmember of Apollo 17, Schmitt became the first member of NASA's first scientist-astronaut group to fly in space. As Apollo 17 was the last of the Apollo missions, he also became the twelfth and second-youngest person to set foot on the Moon and the second-to-last person to step off of the Moon (he boarded the Lunar Module shortly before commander Eugene Cernan). Schmitt also remains the only professional scientist to have flown beyond low Earth orbit and to have visited the Moon. Before training for Apollo 17, he was influential in the geology field for supporting the Apollo program and had helped train Apollo astronauts chosen to visit the lunar surface.\nSchmitt resigned from NASA in August 1975 to run for election to the United States Senate as a member from New Mexico. As the Republican candidate in the 1976 election, he defeated Democratic incumbent Joseph Montoya. In the 1982 election, Schmitt was defeated by Democrat Jeff Bingaman.\nBiography.\nEarly life and education.\nBorn July 3, 1935, in Santa Rita, New Mexico, Schmitt grew up in nearby Silver City, and is a graduate of the Western High School (Class of 1953). He received a Bachelor of Science degree in geology from the California Institute of Technology in 1957 and then spent a year studying geology at the University of Oslo in Norway, as a Fulbright Scholar. He received a Doctor of Philosophy in geology from Harvard University in 1964, based on his geological field studies in Norway.\nNASA career.\nBefore joining NASA as a member of the first group of scientist-astronauts in June 1965, he worked at the U.S. Geological Survey's Astrogeology Center at Flagstaff, Arizona, developing geological field techniques that would be used by the Apollo crews. Following his selection, Schmitt spent his first year at Air Force UPT learning to become a jet pilot. Upon his return to the astronaut corps in Houston, he played a key role in training Apollo crews to be geologic observers when they were in lunar orbit and competent geologic field workers when they were on the lunar surface. After each of the landing missions, he participated in the examination and evaluation of the returned lunar samples and helped the crews with the scientific aspects of their mission reports.\nSchmitt spent considerable time becoming proficient in the CSM and LM systems. In March 1970 he became the first of the scientist-astronauts to be assigned to space flight, joining Richard F. Gordon Jr. (Commander) and Vance Brand (Command Module Pilot) on the Apollo 15 backup crew. The flight rotation put these three in line to fly as prime crew on the third following mission, Apollo 18. When Apollo 18 and Apollo 19 were canceled in September 1970, the community of lunar geologists supporting Apollo felt so strongly about the need to land a professional geologist on the Moon, that they pressured NASA to reassign Schmitt to a remaining flight. As a result, Schmitt was assigned in August 1971 to fly on Apollo 17, replacing Joe Engle as Lunar Module Pilot. Schmitt landed on the Moon with commander Gene Cernan in December 1972.\nSchmitt claims to have taken the photograph of the Earth known as \"The Blue Marble\", one of the most widely distributed photographic images in existence. His Apollo 17 crewmates, Gene Cernan (Mission Commander) and Ronald Evans (Command Module Pilot), have made the same claim, and NASA's official position is to credit all three together.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\n\"Perhaps the hardest thing to get used to on the Moon is that the sky is completely black. There's no blue at all.\"\nHarrison Schmitt (2022-09-12)\nWhile on the Moon's surface, Schmitt\u2014the only geologist in the astronaut corps\u2014collected the rock sample designated Troctolite 76535, which has been called \"without doubt the most interesting sample returned from the Moon\". Among other distinctions, it is the central piece of evidence suggesting that the Moon once possessed an active magnetic field.\nAs he returned to the Lunar Module before Cernan, Schmitt is the next-to-last person to have walked on the Moon's surface. Since the death of Cernan in 2017, Schmitt is the most recent person to have walked on the Moon who is still alive. After the completion of the Apollo 17 mission, Schmitt played an active role in documenting the Apollo geologic results and also took on the task of organizing NASA's Energy Program Office.\nOn April 29, 2018, the Schmitt Space Communicator SC-1x named in his honor was carried aboard the Blue Origin New Shepard crew capsule in a project partly funded by NASA. It launched the first commercial two-way data and Wi-Fi hotspot service in space and sent the first commercial Twitter message from space. The device was developed by Solstar, which Schmitt had joined as an advisor, and launched above the Earth's surface, just past the edge of space, as a technology demonstration. The device was admitted to the Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum.\nSenate career.\nOn August 30, 1975, Schmitt retired from NASA to seek election as a Republican to the United States Senate representing New Mexico in the 1976 election. The astronaut-politician campaigned for fourteen months, and his campaign focused on the future. In the Republican primary, held on June 1, 1976, Schmitt defeated the unknown Eugene Peirce. In the election, Schmitt opposed two-term Democratic incumbent Joseph Montoya. He defeated Montoya 57% to 43%.\nHe served one term and, notably, was the chairman of the Science, Technology, and Space Subcommittee of the United States Senate Committee on Commerce. He sought a second term in 1982, facing state Attorney General Jeff Bingaman. Bingaman criticized Schmitt for not paying enough attention to local matters; his campaign slogan asked, \"What on Earth has he done for you lately?\" This, combined with the deep recession, proved too much for Schmitt to overcome; he was defeated, 54% to 46%.\nPost-Senate career.\nFollowing his Senate term, Schmitt has been a consultant in business, geology, space, and public policy. Schmitt is an adjunct professor of engineering physics at the University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison, and has long been a proponent of lunar resource utilization. In 1997 he proposed the Interlune InterMars Initiative, listing among its goals the advancement of private-sector acquisition and use of lunar resources, particularly lunar helium-3 as a fuel for notional nuclear fusion reactors.\nSchmitt was chair of the NASA Advisory Council, whose mandate is to provide technical advice to the NASA Administrator, from November 2005 until his abrupt resignation on October 16, 2008. In November 2008, he quit the Planetary Society over policy advocacy differences, citing the organization's statements on \"focusing on Mars as the driving goal of human spaceflight\" (Schmitt said that going back to the Moon would speed progress toward a crewed Mars mission), on \"accelerating research into global climate change through more comprehensive Earth observations\" (Schmitt voiced objections to the notion of a present \"scientific consensus\" on climate change as any policy guide), and on international cooperation (which he felt would retard rather than accelerate progress), among other points of divergence.\nSchmitt also serves as a visiting senior research scientist at the Florida Institute for Human &amp; Machine Cognition.\nIn January 2011, he was appointed as secretary of the New Mexico Energy, Minerals and Natural Resources Department in the cabinet of Governor Susana Martinez, but was forced to give up the appointment the following month after refusing to submit to a required background investigation. \"El Paso Times\" called him the \"most celebrated\" candidate for New Mexico energy secretary.\nSchmitt wrote a book entitled \"Return to the Moon: Exploration, Enterprise, and Energy in the Human Settlement of Space\" in 2006. Schmitt is also involved in several civic projects, including the improvement of the Senator Harrison H. Schmitt Big Sky Hang Glider Park in Albuquerque, New Mexico.\nViews on climate change.\nSchmitt has rejected the scientific consensus on climate change, which states that climate change is real, progressing, dangerous, and primarily human-caused. He has claimed that climate change is predominantly caused by natural factors, as opposed to human activity. Schmitt has argued that the risks posed by climate change are overstated and has instead supported the notion that climate change is a \"tool\" used to advocate for the expansion of the government.\nSchmitt resigned from the Planetary Society due to disagreements over their \"Roadmap to Space Exploration\", which recommended prioritizing earlier human missions to Mars over U.S. lunar expeditions. He believed lunar exploration was crucial for Mars missions, stating, \"The fastest way to get to Mars is by way of the Moon.\" Additionally, Schmitt criticized the society's stance on global warming, writing in his resignation letter that the \"'global warming scare' is being used as a political tool to increase government control over American lives, incomes and decision making,\" asserting it should not be part of the Society's activities. Schmitt spoke at the March 2009 International Conference on Climate Change, an anthropogenic climate change denier event hosted by the conservative Heartland Institute, where he said that climate change was a \"stalking horse for National Socialism.\" He appeared in December that year on the Fox Business Network, saying that \"[t]he CO2 scare is a red herring\".\nIn a 2009 interview with radio host Alex Jones, Schmitt asserted a link between the collapse of the Soviet Union and the American environmental movement: \"I think the whole trend really began with the fall of the Soviet Union. Because the great champion of the opponents of liberty, namely communism, had to find some other place to go and they basically went into the environmental movement.\"\nIn 2013, Schmitt co-authored an opinion column in \"The Wall Street Journal\" with William Happer, contending that increasing levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere are not significantly correlated with global warming, attributing the \"single-minded demonization of this natural and essential atmospheric gas\" to advocates of government control of energy production. Noting a positive relationship between crop resistance to drought and increasing carbon dioxide levels, the authors argued, \"Contrary to what some would have us believe, increased carbon dioxide in the atmosphere will benefit the increasing population on the planet by increasing agricultural productivity.\"\nAwards and honors.\nSchmitt was one of five inductees into the International Space Hall of Fame in 1977. He was one of 24 Apollo astronauts who were inducted into the U.S. Astronaut Hall of Fame in 1997.\nMedia.\nSchmitt is one of the astronauts featured in the 2007 documentary \"In the Shadow of the Moon\". He also contributed to the 2006 book \"NASA's Scientist-Astronauts\" by David Shayler and Colin Burgess."}

{"id": "13802", "revid": "13791031", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=13802", "title": "Hammer", "text": "Tool\nA hammer is a tool, most often a hand tool, consisting of a weighted \"head\" fixed to a long handle that is swung to deliver an impact to a small area of an object. This can be, for example, to drive nails into wood, to shape metal (as with a forge), or to crush rock. Hammers are used for a wide range of driving, shaping, breaking and non-destructive striking applications. Traditional disciplines include carpentry, blacksmithing, warfare, and percussive musicianship (as with a gong).\nHammering is use of a hammer in its strike capacity, as opposed to prying with a secondary claw or grappling with a secondary hook. Carpentry and blacksmithing hammers are generally wielded from a stationary stance against a stationary target as gripped and propelled with one arm, in a lengthy downward planar arc\u2014downward to add kinetic energy to the impact\u2014pivoting mainly around the shoulder and elbow, with a small but brisk wrist rotation shortly before impact; for extreme impact, concurrent motions of the torso and knee can lower the shoulder joint during the swing to further increase the length of the swing arc (but this is tiring). War hammers are often wielded in non-vertical planes of motion, with a far greater share of energy input provided from the legs and hips, which can also include a lunging motion, especially against moving targets. Small mallets can be swung from the wrists in a smaller motion permitting a much higher cadence of repeated strikes. Use of hammers and heavy mallets for demolition must adapt the hammer stroke to the location and orientation of the target, which can necessitate a clubbing or golfing motion with a two-handed grip.\nThe modern hammer head is typically made of steel which has been heat treated for hardness, and the handle (also known as a haft or helve) is typically made of wood or plastic.\nUbiquitous in framing, the claw hammer has a \"claw\" to pull nails out of wood, and is commonly found in an inventory of household tools in North America. Other types of hammers vary in shape, size, and structure, depending on their purposes. Hammers used in many trades include sledgehammers, mallets, and ball-peen hammers. Although most hammers are hand tools, powered hammers, such as steam hammers and trip hammers, are used to deliver forces beyond the capacity of the human arm. There are over 40 different types of hammers that have many different types of uses.\nFor hand hammers, the grip of the shaft is an important consideration. Many forms of hammering by hand are heavy work, and perspiration can lead to slippage from the hand, turning a hammer into a dangerous or destructive uncontrolled projectile. Steel is highly elastic and transmits shock and vibration; steel is also a good conductor of heat, making it unsuitable for contact with bare skin in frigid conditions. Modern hammers with steel shafts are almost invariably clad with a synthetic polymer to improve grip, dampen vibration, and to provide thermal insulation. A suitably contoured handle is also an important aid in providing a secure grip during heavy use. Traditional wooden handles were reasonably good in all regards, but lack strength and durability compared to steel, and there are safety issues with wooden handles if the head becomes loose on the shaft.\nThe high elasticity of the steel head is important in energy transfer, especially when used in conjunction with an equally elastic anvil.\nIn terms of human physiology, many uses of the hammer involve coordinated ballistic movements under intense muscular forces which must be planned in advance at the neuromuscular level, as they occur too rapidly for conscious adjustment in flight. For this reason, accurate striking at speed requires more practice than a tapping movement to the same target area. It has been suggested that the cognitive demands for pre-planning, sequencing and accurate timing associated with the related ballistic movements of throwing, clubbing, and hammering precipitated aspects of brain evolution in early hominids.\nHistory.\nThe use of simple hammers dates to around 3.3 million years ago according to the 2012 find made by Sonia Harmand and Jason Lewis of Stony Brook University, who while excavating a site near Kenya's Lake Turkana discovered a very large deposit of various shaped stones including those used to strike wood, bone, or other stones to break them apart and shape them. The first hammers were made without handles. Stones attached to sticks with strips of leather or animal sinew were being used as hammers with handles by about 30,000 BCE during the middle of the Paleolithic Stone Age. The addition of a handle gave the user better control and less accidents. The hammer became the primary tool used for building, food, and protection.\nThe hammer's archaeological record shows that it may be the oldest tool for which definite evidence exists.\nConstruction and materials.\nA traditional hand-held hammer consists of a separate head and a handle, which can be fastened together by means of a special wedge made for the purpose, or by glue, or both. This two-piece design is often used to combine a dense metallic striking head with a non-metallic mechanical-shock-absorbing handle (to reduce user fatigue from repeated strikes). If wood is used for the handle, it is often hickory or ash, which are tough and long-lasting materials that can dissipate shock waves from the hammer head. Rigid fiberglass resin may be used for the handle; this material does not absorb water or decay but does not dissipate shock as well as wood.\nA loose hammer head is considered hazardous due to the risk of the head becoming detached from the handle while being swung becoming a dangerous uncontrolled projectile. Wooden handles can often be replaced when worn or damaged; specialized kits are available covering a range of handle sizes and designs, plus special wedges and spacers for secure attachment.\nSome hammers are one-piece designs made mostly of a single material. A one-piece metallic hammer may optionally have its handle coated or wrapped in a resilient material such as rubber for improved grip and to reduce user fatigue.\nThe hammer head may be surfaced with a variety of materials including brass, bronze, wood, plastic, rubber, or leather. Some hammers have interchangeable striking surfaces, which can be selected as needed or replaced when worn out.\nDesigns and variations.\nA large hammer-like tool is a \"maul\" (sometimes called a \"beetle\"), a wood- or rubber-headed hammer is a \"mallet\", and a hammer-like tool with a cutting blade is usually called a \"hatchet\". The essential part of a hammer is the head, a compact solid mass that is able to deliver a blow to the intended target without itself deforming. The impacting surface of the tool is usually flat or slightly rounded; the opposite end of the impacting mass may have a ball shape, as in the ball-peen hammer. Some upholstery hammers have a magnetized face, to pick up tacks. In the hatchet, the flat hammer head may be secondary to the cutting edge of the tool.\nThe impact between steel hammer heads and the objects being hit can create sparks, which may ignite flammable or explosive gases. These are a hazard in some industries such as underground coal mining (due to the presence of methane gas), or in other hazardous environments such as petroleum refineries and chemical plants. In these environments, a variety of non-sparking metal tools are used, primarily made of aluminium or beryllium copper. In recent years, the handles have been made of durable plastic or rubber, though wood is still widely used because of its shock-absorbing qualities and repairability.\nMechanically powered.\nMechanically powered hammers often look quite different from the hand tools, but nevertheless, most of them work on the same principle. They include:\nPhysics.\nAs a force amplifier.\nA hammer is a simple force amplifier that works by converting mechanical work into kinetic energy and back.\nIn the swing that precedes each blow, the hammer head stores a certain amount of kinetic energy\u2014equal to the length \"D\" of the swing times the force \"f\" produced by the muscles of the arm and by gravity. When the hammer strikes, the head is stopped by an opposite force coming from the target, equal and opposite to the force applied by the head to the target. If the target is a hard and heavy object, or if it is resting on some sort of anvil, the head can travel only a very short distance \"d\" before stopping. Since the stopping force \"F\" times that distance must be equal to the head's kinetic energy, it follows that \"F\" is much greater than the original driving force \"f\"\u2014roughly, by a factor \"D\"/\"d\". In this way, great strength is not needed to produce a force strong enough to bend steel, or crack the hardest stone.\nEffect of the head's mass.\nThe amount of energy delivered to the target by the hammer-blow is equivalent to one half the mass of the head times the square of the head's speed at the time of impact formula_1. While the energy delivered to the target increases linearly with mass, it increases quadratically with the speed (see the effect of the handle, below). High tech titanium heads are lighter and allow for longer handles, thus increasing velocity and delivering the same energy with less arm fatigue than that of a heavier steel head hammer. A titanium head has about 3% recoil energy and can result in greater efficiency and less fatigue when compared to a steel head with up to 30% recoil. Dead blow hammers use special rubber or steel shot to absorb recoil energy, rather than bouncing the hammer head after impact.\nEffect of the handle.\nThe handle of the hammer helps in several ways. It keeps the user's hands away from the point of impact. It provides a broad area that is better-suited for gripping by the hand. Most importantly, it allows the user to maximize the speed of the head on each blow. The primary constraint on additional handle length is the lack of space to swing the hammer. This is why sledgehammers, largely used in open spaces, can have handles that are much longer than a standard carpenter's hammer. The second most important constraint is more subtle. Even without considering the effects of fatigue, the longer the handle, the harder it is to guide the head of the hammer to its target at full speed.\nMost designs are a compromise between practicality and energy efficiency. With too long a handle, the hammer is inefficient because it delivers force to the wrong place, off-target. With too short a handle, the hammer is inefficient because it does not deliver enough force, requiring more blows to complete a given task. Modifications have also been made with respect to the effect of the hammer on the user. Handles made of shock-absorbing materials or varying angles attempt to make it easier for the user to continue to wield this age-old device, even as nail guns and other powered drivers encroach on its traditional field of use.\nAs hammers must be used in many circumstances, where the position of the person using them cannot be taken for granted, trade-offs are made for the sake of practicality. In areas where one has plenty of room, a long handle with a heavy head (like a sledgehammer) can deliver the maximum amount of energy to the target. It is not practical to use such a large hammer for all tasks, however, and thus the overall design has been modified repeatedly to achieve the optimum utility in a wide variety of situations.\nEffect of gravity.\nGravity exerts a force on the hammer head. If hammering downwards, gravity increases the acceleration during the hammer stroke and increases the energy delivered with each blow. If hammering upwards, gravity reduces the acceleration during the hammer stroke and therefore reduces the energy delivered with each blow. Some hammering methods, such as traditional mechanical pile drivers, rely entirely on gravity for acceleration on the down stroke.\nErgonomics and injury risks.\nA hammer may cause significant injury if it strikes the body. Both manual and powered hammers can cause peripheral neuropathy or a variety of other ailments when used improperly. Awkward handles can cause repetitive stress injury (RSI) to hand and arm joints, and uncontrolled shock waves from repeated impacts can injure nerves and the skeleton. Additionally, striking metal objects with a hammer may produce small metallic projectiles which can become lodged in the eye. It is therefore recommended to wear safety glasses.\nWar hammers.\nA war hammer is a late medieval weapon of war intended for close combat action.\nSymbolism.\nThe hammer, being one of the most used tools by man, has been used very much in symbols such as flags and heraldry. In the Middle Ages, it was used often in blacksmith guild logos, as well as in many family symbols. The hammer and pick are used as a symbol of mining.\nIn mythology, the gods Thor (Norse) and Sucellus (Celtic and Gallo-Roman), and the hero Hercules (Greek), all had hammers that appear in their lore and carried different meanings. Thor, the god of thunder and lightning, wields a hammer named Mj\u00f6lnir. Many artifacts of decorative hammers have been found, leading modern practitioners of this religion to often wear reproductions as a sign of their faith.\nIn American folklore, the hammer of John Henry represents the strength and endurance of a man.\nA political party in Singapore, Workers' Party of Singapore, based their logo on a hammer to symbolize the party's civic nationalism and social democracy ideology.\nA variant, well-known symbol with a hammer in it is the hammer and sickle, which was the symbol of the former Soviet Union and is strongly linked to communism and early socialism. The hammer in this symbol represents the industrial working class (and the sickle represents the agricultural working class). The hammer is used in some coats of arms in former socialist countries like East Germany. Similarly, the Hammer and Sword symbolizes Strasserism, a strand of Nazism seeking to appeal to the working class. Another variant of the symbol was used for the North Korean party, Workers' Party of Korea, incorporated with an ink brush on the middle, which symbolizes both Juche and Songun ideologies.\nIn Pink Floyd \u2013 The Wall, two hammers crossed are used as a symbol for the fascist takeover of the concert during \"In the Flesh\". This also has the meaning of the hammer beating down any \"nails\" that stick out.\nThe gavel, a small wooden mallet, is used to symbolize a mandate to preside over a meeting or judicial proceeding, and a graphic image of one is used as a symbol of legislative or judicial decision-making authority.\nJudah Maccabee was nicknamed \"The Hammer\", possibly in recognition of his ferocity in battle. The name \"Maccabee\" may derive from the Aramaic \"maqqaba\". (see .)\nThe hammer in the song \"If I Had a Hammer\" represents a relentless message of justice broadcast across the land. The song became a symbol of the civil rights movement.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "13804", "revid": "9755426", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=13804", "title": "Hiragana", "text": "Japanese syllabary\n \n is a Japanese syllabary, part of the Japanese writing system, along with \"katakana\" as well as \"kanji\" (Chinese characters).\nIt is a phonetic lettering system. The word \"hiragana\" means \"common\" or \"plain\" kana (originally also \"easy\", as contrasted with kanji).\nHistorically, hiragana developed from cursive forms of Kanji () via , with each sign originating as a simplified cursive rendering of a whole kanji\u2014for example, from .\nHiragana and katakana are both kana systems. With few exceptions, each mora in the Japanese language is represented by one character (or one digraph) in each system. This may be a vowel such as (hiragana \u3042); a consonant followed by a vowel such as (\u304b); or the nasal sonorant (\u3093). Because the characters of the kana do not represent single consonants (except in the case of the aforementioned \u3093), the kana are referred to as syllabic symbols and not alphabetic letters.\nHiragana is used to write \"okurigana\" (kana suffixes following a kanji root, for example to inflect verbs and adjectives), various grammatical and function words including particles, and miscellaneous other native words for which there are no kanji or whose kanji form is obscure or too formal for the writing purpose. Words that do have common kanji renditions may also sometimes be written instead in hiragana, according to an individual author's preference, for example to impart an informal feel. Hiragana is also used to write \"furigana\", a reading aid that shows the pronunciation of kanji characters.\nThere are two main systems of ordering hiragana: the old-fashioned iroha ordering and the more prevalent goj\u016bon ordering.\nWriting system.\nAfter the 1900 script reform, which deemed hundreds of characters \"hentaigana\", the hiragana syllabary consists of 48 base characters, of which two (\u3090 and \u3091) are only used in some proper names:\nThese are conceived as a 5\u00d710 grid (\"goj\u016bon\", , \"Fifty Sounds\"), as illustrated in the adjacent table, read \u3042 (\"a\"), \u3044 (\"i\"), \u3046 (\"u\"), \u3048 (\"e\"), \u304a (\"o\"), \u304b (\"ka\"), \u304d (\"ki\"), \u304f (\"ku\"), \u3051 (\"ke\"), \u3053 (\"ko\") and so forth (but \"si\"\u2192\"shi\", \"ti\"\u2192\"chi\", \"tu\"\u2192\"tsu\", \"hu\"\u2192\"fu\", \"wi\"\u2192\"i\", \"we\"\u2192\"e\", \"wo\"\u2192\"o\"). Of the 50 theoretically possible combinations, \"yi\", \"ye\", and \"wu\" are completely unused. On the \"w\" row, \u3090 and \u3091, pronounced and respectively, are uncommon in modern Japanese, while \u3092, pronounced , is common as a particle but otherwise rare. Strictly speaking, the singular consonant \u3093 (\"n\") is considered to be outside the \"goj\u016bon\".\nThese basic characters can be modified in various ways. By adding a \"dakuten\" marker (\u00a0\u309b), a voiceless consonant is turned into a voiced consonant: \"k\"\u2192\"g\", \"ts/s\"\u2192\"z\", \"t\"\u2192\"d\", \"h/f\"\u2192\"b\" and \"ch\"/\"sh\"\u2192\"j\" (also \"u\"\u2192\"v(u)\"). For example, \u304b (\"ka\") becomes \u304c (\"ga\"). Hiragana beginning with an \"h\" (or \"f\") sound can also add a \"handakuten\" marker (\u00a0\u309c) changing the \"h\" (\"f\") to a \"p\". For example, \u306f (\"ha\") becomes \u3071 (\"pa\").\nA small version of the hiragana for \"ya\", \"yu\", or \"yo\" (\u3083, \u3085, or \u3087 respectively) may be added to hiragana ending in \"i\". This changes the \"i\" vowel sound to a glide (palatalization) to \"a\", \"u\" or \"o\". For example, \u304d (\"ki\") plus \u3083 (small \"ya\") becomes \u304d\u3083 (\"kya\"). The addition of the small \"y\" kana is called \"y\u014don\".\nA small \"tsu\" \u3063, called a \"sokuon\", indicates that the following consonant is geminated (doubled). In Japanese this is an important distinction in pronunciation; for example, compare \u3055\u304b, \"saka\", \"hill\" with \u3055\u3063\u304b, \"sakka\", \"author\". However, it cannot be used to double an \"n\" \u2013 for this purpose, the singular \"n\" (\u3093) is added in front of the syllable, as in \u307f\u3093\u306a (\"minna\", \"all\"). The \"sokuon\" also sometimes appears at the end of utterances, where it denotes a glottal stop, as in \u3044\u3066\u3063! (, \"Ouch!\").\nTwo hiragana have pronunciations that depend on the context:\nHiragana usually spells long vowels with the addition of a second vowel kana; for example, \u304a\u304b\u3042\u3055\u3093 (\"o-ka-a-sa-n\", \"mother\"). The \"ch\u014donpu\" (long vowel mark) (\u30fc) used in katakana is rarely used with hiragana, for example in the word \u3089\u30fc\u3081\u3093, \"r\u0101men\", but this usage is considered non-standard in Japanese. However, the Okinawan language uses ch\u014donpu with hiragana. In informal writing, small versions of the five vowel kana are sometimes used to represent trailing off sounds (\u306f\u3041, \"haa\", \u306d\u3047, \"nee\"). Plain (clear) and voiced iteration marks are written in hiragana as \u309d and \u309e, respectively. These marks are rarely used nowadays.\nTable of hiragana.\nThe following table shows the complete hiragana together with the modified Hepburn romanization and IPA transcription, arranged in four categories, each of them displayed in the \"goj\u016bon\" order. Those whose romanization are in bold do not use the initial consonant for that row. For all syllables besides \u3093, the pronunciation indicated is for word-initial syllables; for mid-word pronunciations see below.\nSpelling\u2013phonology correspondence.\nIn the middle of words, the \"g\" sound (normally ) may turn into a velar nasal or velar fricative . For example, \u304b\u304e (\"kagi\", key) is often pronounced . However, \u3058\u3085\u3046\u3054 (\"j\u016bgo\", fifteen) is pronounced as if it was \"j\u016b\" and \"go\" stacked end to end: .\nIn many accents, the \"j\" and \"z\" sounds are pronounced as affricates ( and , respectively) at the beginning of utterances and fricatives in the middle of words. For example, \u3059\u3046\u3058 \"s\u016bji\" 'number', \u3056\u3063\u3057 \"zasshi\" 'magazine'.\nThe singular \"n\" is pronounced before \"m\", \"b\" and \"p\", before \"t\", \"ch\", \"ts\", \"n\", \"r\", \"z\", \"j\" and \"d\", before \"k\" and \"g\", at the end of utterances, and some kind of high nasal vowel before vowels, palatal approximants (\"y\"), and fricative consonants (\"s\", \"sh\", \"h\", \"f\" and \"w\").\nIn kanji readings, the diphthongs \"ou\" and \"ei\" are usually pronounced (long o) and (long e) respectively. For example, \u3068\u3046\u304d\u3087\u3046 (lit. \"toukyou\") is pronounced 'Tokyo', and \u305b\u3093\u305b\u3044 \"sensei\" is 'teacher'. However, \u3068\u3046 \"tou\" is pronounced 'to inquire', because the \"o\" and \"u\" are considered distinct, \"u\" being the verb ending in the dictionary form. Similarly, \u3057\u3066\u3044\u308b \"shite iru\" is pronounced , present progressive form of \u3059\u308b (\"suru\", \"to do\").\nIn archaic forms of Japanese, there existed the \"kwa\" ( ) and \"gwa\" ( ) digraphs. In modern Japanese, these phonemes have been phased out of usage.\nSpelling rules.\nWith a few exceptions, such as for the three particles \u306f (pronounced instead of ), \u3078 (pronounced instead of ) and (written \u3092 instead of \u304a), Japanese when written in kana is phonemically orthographic, i.e. there is a one-to-one correspondence between kana characters and sounds, leaving only words' pitch accent unrepresented. This has not always been the case: a previous system of spelling, now referred to as historical kana usage, differed substantially from pronunciation; the three above-mentioned exceptions in modern usage are the legacy of that system.\nThere are two hiragana pronounced \"ji\" (\u3058 and \u3062) and two hiragana pronounced \"zu\" (\u305a and \u3065), but to distinguish them, particularly when typing Japanese, sometimes \u3062 is written as \"di\" and \u3065 is written as \"du\". These pairs are not interchangeable. Usually, \"ji\" is written as \u3058 and \"zu\" is written as \u305a. There are some exceptions. If the first two syllables of a word consist of one syllable without a \"dakuten\" and the same syllable with a \"dakuten\", the same hiragana is used to write the sounds. For example, \"chijimeru\" ('to boil down' or 'to shrink') is spelled \u3061\u3062\u3081\u308b and \"tsuzuku\" ('to continue') is \u3064\u3065\u304f.\nFor compound words where the dakuten reflects \"rendaku\" voicing, the original hiragana is used. For example, \"chi\" ( 'blood') is spelled \u3061 in plain hiragana. When \"hana\" ('nose') and \"chi\" ('blood') combine to make \"hanaji\" ( 'nose bleed'), the sound of changes from \"chi\" to \"ji\". So \"hanaji\" is spelled \u306f\u306a\u3062. Similarly, \"tsukau\" (; 'to use') is spelled \u3064\u304b\u3046 in hiragana, so \"kanazukai\" (; 'kana use', or 'kana orthography') is spelled \u304b\u306a\u3065\u304b\u3044 in hiragana. However, there are cases where \u3062 and \u3065 are not used, such as the word for 'lightning', \"inazuma\" (). The first component, , meaning 'rice plant', is written \u3044\u306a (\"ina\"). The second component, (etymologically ), meaning 'spouse', is pronounced \u3064\u307e (\"tsuma\") when standalone or often as \u3065\u307e (zuma) when following another syllable, such in (\"hitozuma\", 'married woman'). Even though these components of are etymologically linked to 'lightning', it is generally arduous for a contemporary speaker to consciously perceive \"inazuma\" as separable into two discrete words. Thus, the default spelling \u3044\u306a\u305a\u307e is used instead of \u3044\u306a\u3065\u307e. Other examples include \"kizuna\" (\u304d\u305a\u306a) and \"sakazuki\" (\u3055\u304b\u305a\u304d). Although these rules were officially established by a Cabinet Notice in 1986 revising the modern kana usage, they have sometimes faced criticism due to their perceived arbitrariness.\nOfficially, \u3062 and \u3065 do not occur word-initially pursuant to modern spelling rules. There were words such as \u3062\u3070\u3093 \"jiban\" 'ground' in the historical kana usage, but they were unified under \u3058 in the modern kana usage in 1946, so today it is spelled exclusively \u3058\u3070\u3093. However, \u3065\u3089 \"zura\" 'wig' (from \u304b\u3064\u3089 \"katsura\") and \u3065\u3051 \"zuke\" (a sushi term for lean tuna soaked in soy sauce) are examples of word-initial \u3065 today.\nNo standard Japanese words begin with the kana \u3093 (\"n\"). This is the basis of the word game shiritori. \u3093 \"n\" is normally treated as its own syllable and is separate from the other \"n\"-based kana (\"na\", \"ni\" etc.).\n\u3093 is sometimes directly followed by a vowel (\"a\", \"i\", \"u\", \"e\" or \"o\") or a palatal approximant (\"ya\", \"yu\" or \"yo\"). These are clearly distinct from the \"na\", \"ni\" etc. syllables, and there are minimal pairs such as \u304d\u3093\u3048\u3093 \"kin'en\" 'smoking forbidden', \u304d\u306d\u3093 \"kinen\" 'commemoration', \u304d\u3093\u306d\u3093 \"kinnen\" 'recent years'. In Hepburn romanization, they are distinguished with an apostrophe, but not all romanization methods make the distinction. For example, past prime minister Junichiro Koizumi's first name is actually \u3058\u3085\u3093\u3044\u3061\u308d\u3046 \"Jun'ichir\u014d\" pronounced \nThere are a few hiragana that are rarely used. Outside of Okinawan orthography, \u3090 \"wi\" and \u3091 \"we\" are only used in some proper names. \ud82c\udc01 \"e\" was an alternate version of \u3048 \"e\" before spelling reform, and was briefly reused for \"ye\" during initial spelling reforms, but is now completely obsolete. \u3094 \"vu\" is a modern addition used to represent the /v/ sound in foreign languages such as English, but since Japanese from a phonological standpoint does not have a /v/ sound, it is pronounced as /b/ and mostly serves as a more accurate indicator of a word's pronunciation in its original language. However, it is rarely seen because loanwords and transliterated words are usually written in katakana, where the corresponding character would be written as \u30f4. The digraphs \u3062\u3083, \u3062\u3085, \u3062\u3087 for \"ja\"/\"ju\"/\"jo\" are theoretically possible in rendaku, but are nearly never used in modern kana usage; for example, the word , \"meoto-jawan\" (couple bowls), spelled \u3081\u304a\u3068\u3062\u3083\u308f\u3093, where alone is spelled \u3061\u3083\u308f\u3093 (\"chawan\").\nThe \u307f\u3085 \"myu\" kana is extremely rare in originally Japanese words; linguist Haruhiko Kindaichi raises the example of the Japanese family name Omamy\u016bda () and claims it is the only occurrence amongst pure Japanese words. Its katakana counterpart is used in many loanwords, however.\nObsolete kana.\n\"e\" and \"i\".\nOn the row beginning with \u308f /wa/, the hiragana \u3090 /wi/ and \u3091 /we/ are both quasi-obsolete, only used in some names. They are usually respectively pronounced [i] and [e]. In modified Hepburn romanization, they are generally written as \"i\" and \"e\".\n\"yi\", \"ye\" and \"wu\".\n\"yi\".\nIt has not been demonstrated whether the mora /ji/ existed in old Japanese. Though \"ye\" did appear in some textbooks during the Meiji period along with another kana for \"yi\" in the form of cursive \u4ee5. Today it is considered a Hentaigana by scholars and is encoded in Unicode 10 (\ud82c\udc06) This kana could have a colloquial use, to convert the combo yui (\u3086\u3044) into yii (\ud82c\udc06\u3044), due to other Japanese words having a similar change.\n\"ye\".\nAn early, now obsolete, hiragana-esque form of \"ye\" may have existed (\ud82c\udc01 ) in pre-Classical Japanese (prior to the advent of kana), but is generally represented for purposes of reconstruction by the kanji \u6c5f, and its hiragana form is not present in any known orthography. In modern orthography, \"ye\" can also be written as \u3044\u3047 (\u30a4\u30a7 in katakana).\nWhile hiragana and katakana letters for \"ye\" were used for a short period after the advent of kana, the distinction between /ye/ and /e/ disappeared before glyphs could become established.\n\"wu\".\nIt has not been demonstrated whether the mora /wu/ existed in old Japanese. However, hiragana also appeared in different Meiji-era textbooks (). Although there are several possible source kanji, it is likely to have been derived from a cursive form of the , although a related variant sometimes listed () is from a cursive form of . However, it was never commonly used. This character is included in Unicode 14 as HIRAGANA LETTER ARCHAIC WU (\ud82c\udd1f).\nHistory.\nHiragana developed from \"man'y\u014dgana\", Chinese characters used for their pronunciations, a practice that started in the 5th century. The oldest examples of Man'y\u014dgana include the Inariyama Sword, an iron sword excavated at the Inariyama Kofun. This sword is thought to be made in the year (most commonly taken to be C.E. 471).\nThe forms of the hiragana originate from the cursive script style of Chinese calligraphy. The table to the right shows the derivation of hiragana from many\u014dgana via cursive script. The upper part shows the character in the regular script form, the center character in red shows the cursive script form of the character, and the bottom shows the equivalent hiragana. The cursive script forms are not strictly confined to those in the illustration.\nWhen it was first developed, hiragana was not accepted by everyone. The educated or elites preferred to use only the kanji system. Historically, in Japan, the regular script (\"kaisho\") form of the characters was used by men and called , \"men's writing\", while the cursive script (\"s\u014dsho\") form of the kanji was used by women. Hence hiragana first gained popularity among women, who were generally not allowed access to the same levels of education as men, thus hiragana was first widely used among court women in the writing of personal communications and literature. From this comes the alternative name of \"women's writing\". For example, \"The Tale of Genji\" and other early novels by female authors used hiragana extensively or exclusively. Even today, hiragana is felt to have a feminine quality.\nMale authors came to write literature using hiragana. Hiragana was used for unofficial writing such as personal letters, while katakana and kanji were used for official documents. In modern times, the usage of hiragana has become mixed with katakana writing. Katakana is now relegated to special uses such as recently borrowed words (i.e., since the 19th century), names in transliteration, the names of animals, in telegrams, and for emphasis.\nOriginally, for all syllables there was more than one possible hiragana. In 1900, the system was simplified so each syllable had only one hiragana. The deprecated hiragana are now known as .\nThe pangram poem \"Iroha-uta\" (\"ABC song/poem\"), which dates to the 10th century, uses every hiragana once (except \"n\" \u3093, which was a variant of \u3080 before the Muromachi era).\nStroke order and direction.\nThe following table shows the method for writing each hiragana character. The table is arranged in a traditional manner, beginning top right and reading columns down. The numbers and arrows indicate the stroke order and direction respectively.\nUnicode.\nHiragana was added to the Unicode Standard in October, 1991 with the release of version 1.0.\nThe Unicode block for Hiragana is U+3040\u2013U+309F:\nThe Unicode hiragana block contains precomposed characters for all hiragana in the modern set, including small vowels and y\u014don kana for compound syllables as well as the rare \u3090 \"wi\" and \u3091 \"we\"; the archaic \ud82c\udc01 \"ye\" is included in plane 1 at U+1B001 (see below). All combinations of hiragana with \"dakuten\" and \"handakuten\" used in modern Japanese are available as precomposed characters (including the rare \u3094 \"vu\"), and can also be produced by using a base hiragana followed by the combining dakuten and handakuten characters (U+3099 and U+309A, respectively). This method is used to add the diacritics to kana that are not normally used with them, for example applying the dakuten to a pure vowel or the handakuten to a kana not in the h-group.\nCharacters U+3095 and U+3096 are small \u304b (\"ka\") and small \u3051 (\"ke\"), respectively. U+309F is a ligature of \u3088\u308a (\"yori\") occasionally used in vertical text. U+309B and U+309C are spacing (non-combining) equivalents to the combining dakuten and handakuten characters, respectively.\nHistoric and variant forms of Japanese kana characters were first added to the Unicode Standard in October, 2010 with the release of version 6.0, with significantly more added in 2017 as part of Unicode 10.\nThe Unicode block for Kana Supplement is U+1B000\u2013U+1B0FF, and is immediately followed by the Kana Extended-A block (U+1B100\u2013U+1B12F).

{"id": "13805", "revid": "48576347", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=13805", "title": "Hohenstaufen", "text": "Medieval German royal and imperial dynasty\nThe Hohenstaufen dynasty (, , ), also known as the Staufer, was a noble family of German origin that rose to rule the Duchy of Swabia from 1079, and to royal rule in the Holy Roman Empire during the Middle Ages from 1138 until 1254. The dynasty's most prominent rulers \u2013 Frederick I (1155), Henry VI (1191) and Frederick II (1220) \u2013 ascended the imperial throne and also reigned over Italy and Burgundy. The non-contemporary name of 'Hohenstaufen' is derived from the family's Hohenstaufen Castle on Hohenstaufen mountain at the northern fringes of the Swabian Jura, near the town of G\u00f6ppingen. Under Hohenstaufen rule, the Holy Roman Empire reached its greatest territorial extent from 1155 to 1268.\nName.\nThe name Hohenstaufen was first used in the 14th century to distinguish the 'high' (\"hohen\") conical hill named Staufen in the Swabian Jura (in the district of G\u00f6ppingen) from the village of the same name in the valley below. The new name was applied to the hill castle of Staufen by historians only in the 19th century to distinguish it from other castles of the same name. The name of the dynasty followed suit, but in recent decades, the trend in German historiography has been to prefer the name 'Staufer', which is closer to contemporary usage.\nThe name 'Staufen' itself derives from \"Stauf\" (OHG \"stouf\", akin to Early Modern English stoup), meaning 'chalice'. This term was commonly applied to conical hills in Swabia during the Middle Ages. It is a contemporary term for both the hill and the castle, although its spelling in the Latin documents of the time varies considerably: , etc. The castle was built or at least acquired by Duke Frederick I of Swabia in the latter half of the 11th century.\nMembers of the family occasionally used the toponymic surname \"de Stauf\" or variants thereof. Only in the 13th century would the name come to be applied to the family as a whole. Around 1215, a chronicler referred to the \"emperors of Stauf\". In 1247, the Emperor Frederick II himself referred to his family as the \"domus Stoffensis\" (Staufer house), but this was an isolated instance. Otto of Freising (d. 1158) associated the Staufer with the town of Waiblingen, and around 1230, Burchard of Ursberg referred to the Staufer as of the \"royal lineage of the Waiblingens\" (\"regia stirps Waiblingensium\"). The exact connection between the family and Waiblingen is not clear, but as a name for the family, it became very popular. The pro-imperial Ghibelline faction of the Italian civic rivalries of the 13th and 14th centuries derived its name from Waiblingen.\nIn Italian historiography, the Staufer are known as the \"Svevi\" (Swabians).\nOrigins.\nThe origin remains unclear, however, Staufer counts are mentioned in a document of emperor Otto III in 987 as descendants of counts of the region of \"Riesgau\" near N\u00f6rdlingen in the Duchy of Swabia, who were related to the Bavarian \"Sieghardinger\" family. A local count Frederick (d. about 1075) is mentioned as progenitor in a pedigree drawn up by Abbot Wibald of Stavelot at the behest of Emperor Frederick Barbarossa in 1153. He held the office of a Swabian count palatine; his son Frederick of B\u00fcren (c.\u20091020\u20131053) married Hildegard of Egisheim (d. 1094/95), a niece of Pope Leo IX. Their son Frederick I was appointed Duke of Swabia at Hohenstaufen Castle by the Salian king Henry IV of Germany in 1079.\nAt the same time, Duke Frederick I was engaged to the king's approximately seventeen-year-old daughter, Agnes. Nothing is known about Frederick's life before this event, but he proved to be an imperial ally throughout Henry's struggles against other Swabian lords, namely Rudolf of Rheinfelden, Frederick's predecessor, and the Z\u00e4hringen and Welf lords. Frederick's brother Otto was elevated to the Strasbourg bishopric in 1082.\nUpon Frederick's death, he was succeeded by his son, Duke Frederick II, in 1105. Frederick II remained a close ally of the Salians, he and his younger brother Conrad were named the king's representatives in Germany when the king was in Italy. Around 1120, Frederick II married Judith of Bavaria from the rival House of Welf.\nRuling in Germany.\nWhen the last male member of the Salian dynasty, Emperor Henry V, died without heirs in 1125, a controversy arose about the succession. Duke Frederick II and Conrad, the two current male Staufers, by their mother Agnes, were grandsons of late Emperor Henry IV and nephews of Henry V. Frederick attempted to succeed to the throne of the Holy Roman Emperor (formally known as the King of the Romans) through a customary election, but lost to the Saxon duke Lothair of Supplinburg. A civil war between Frederick's dynasty and Lothair's ended with Frederick's submission in 1134. After Lothair's death in 1137, Frederick's brother Conrad was elected King as Conrad III.\nBecause the Welf duke Henry the Proud, son-in-law and heir of Lothair and the most powerful prince in Germany, who had been passed over in the election, refused to acknowledge the new king, Conrad III deprived him of all his territories, giving the Duchy of Saxony to Albert the Bear and that of Bavaria to Leopold\u00a0IV, Margrave of Austria. In 1147, Conrad heard Bernard of Clairvaux preach the Second Crusade at Speyer, and he agreed to join King Louis VII of France in a great expedition to the Holy Land which failed.\nConrad's brother Duke Frederick II died in 1147, and was succeeded in Swabia by his son, Duke Frederick III. When King Conrad III died without adult heir in 1152, Frederick also succeeded him, taking both German royal and Imperial titles.\nFrederick Barbarossa.\nFrederick I (Reign 2 January 1155 \u2013 10 June 1190), known as Frederick Barbarossa because of his red beard, struggled throughout his reign to restore the power and prestige of the German monarchy against the dukes, whose power had grown both before and after the Investiture Controversy under his Salian predecessors. As royal access to the resources of the church in Germany was much reduced, Frederick was forced to go to Italy to find the finances needed to restore the king's power in Germany. He was soon crowned emperor in Italy, but decades of warfare on the peninsula yielded scant results. The Papacy and the prosperous city-states of the Lombard League in northern Italy were traditional enemies, but the fear of Imperial domination caused them to join ranks to fight Frederick. Under the skilled leadership of Pope Alexander III, the alliance suffered many defeats but ultimately was able to deny the emperor a complete victory in Italy. Frederick returned to Germany. He had vanquished one notable opponent, his Welf cousin, Duke Henry the Lion of Saxony and Bavaria in 1180, but his hopes of restoring the power and prestige of the monarchy seemed unlikely to be met by the end of his life.\nDuring Frederick's long stays in Italy, the German princes became stronger and began a successful colonization of Slavic lands. Offers of reduced taxes and manorial duties enticed many Germans to settle in the east in the course of the \"Ostsiedlung\". In 1163 Frederick waged a successful campaign against the Kingdom of Poland in order to re-install the Silesian dukes of the Piast dynasty. With the German colonization, the Empire increased in size and came to include the Duchy of Pomerania. A quickening economic life in Germany increased the number of towns and Imperial cities, and gave them greater importance. It was also during this period that castles and courts replaced monasteries as centers of culture. Growing out of this courtly culture, Middle High German literature reached its peak in lyrical love poetry, the Minnesang, and in narrative epic poems such as \"Tristan\", \"Parzival\", and the \"Nibelungenlied\".\nHenry VI.\nFrederick died in 1190 while on the Third Crusade and was succeeded by his son, Henry VI. Elected king even before his father's death, Henry went to Rome to be crowned emperor. He married Princess Constance of Sicily, and deaths in his wife's family gave him claim of succession and possession of the Kingdom of Sicily in 1189 and 1194 respectively, a source of vast wealth. Henry failed to make royal and Imperial succession hereditary, but in 1196 he succeeded in gaining a pledge that his infant son Frederick would receive the German crown. Faced with difficulties in Italy and confident that he would realize his wishes in Germany at a later date, Henry returned to the south, where it appeared he might unify the peninsula under the Hohenstaufen name. After a series of military victories, however, he fell ill and died of natural causes in Sicily in 1197. His underage son Frederick could only succeed him in Sicily and Malta, while in the Empire the struggle between the House of Staufen and the House of Welf erupted once again.\nPhilip of Swabia.\nBecause the election of a three-year-old boy to be German king appeared likely to make orderly rule difficult, the boy's uncle, Duke Philip of Swabia, brother of late Henry VI, was designated to serve in his place. Other factions however favoured a Welf candidate. In 1198, two rival kings were chosen: the Hohenstaufen Philip of Swabia and the son of the deprived Duke Henry the Lion, the Welf Otto IV. A long civil war began; Philip was about to win when he was murdered by the Bavarian count palatine Otto VIII of Wittelsbach in 1208. Pope Innocent III initially had supported the Welfs, but when Otto, now sole elected monarch, moved to appropriate Sicily, Innocent changed sides and accepted young Frederick II and his ally, King Philip II of France, who defeated Otto at the 1214 Battle of Bouvines. Frederick had returned to Germany in 1212 from Sicily, where he had grown up, and was elected king in 1215. When Otto died in 1218, Frederick became the undisputed ruler, and in 1220 was crowned Holy Roman Emperor.\nPhilip changed the coat of arms from a black lion on a gold shield to three leopards, probably derived from the arms of his Welf rival Otto IV.\nRuling in Italy.\nThe conflict between the Staufer dynasty and the Welf had irrevocably weakened the Imperial authority and the Norman kingdom of Sicily became the base for Staufer rule.\nFrederick II.\nEmperor Frederick II was the most brilliant and extraordinary of the Hohenstaufen but he spent little time in Germany. His main concerns lay in Italy and the Kingdom of Sicily, where he tried to rule as an absolute monarch supported by a sophisticated administrative apparatus. The institutions of Sicily and Italy seemed to be better political laboratories, more conducive to Frederick\u2019s remarkable brand of innovation and absolutist tendencies. He founded the University of Naples in 1224 to train future state officials and reigned over Germany primarily through the allocation of royal prerogatives, leaving the sovereign authority and imperial estates to the ecclesiastical and secular princes. In 1232, Henry (VII), King of Germany and Frederick\u2019s eldest son, was forced by the German princes to promulgate the \"Statutum in favorem principum\" (\"statute in favor of princes\"). Frederick II, embittered but aiming to promote cohesion in Germany in preparation for his campaigns in northern Italy, pragmatically agreed to Henry\u2019s confirmation of the charter. It was a charter of liberties for the leading German princes at the expense of the lesser nobility and the entirety of the commoners. The princes gained whole power of jurisdiction, and the power to strike their own coins. The emperor lost his right to establish new cities, castles and mints over their territories. The \"Statutum\" was more a confirmation of political realities which had existed for generations in Germany than a wholesale denuding of royal power and it did not prevent imperial officials from enforcing Frederick\u2019s prerogatives. The \"Statutum\" affirmed a division of labor between the emperor and the princes and laid much groundwork for the development of particularism and, perhaps even federalism in Germany. Even so, from 1232 the vassals of the emperor had a veto over imperial legislative decisions and any new law established by the emperor had to be approved by the princes. These provisions not withstanding, royal power in Germany remained strong under Frederick.\nBy the 1240s the crown was almost as rich in fiscal resources, towns, castles, enfeoffed retinues, monasteries, ecclesiastical advocacies, manors, tolls, and all other rights, revenues, and jurisdictions as it had ever been at any time since the death of Henry VI. It is unlikely that a particularly \"strong ruler\" such as Frederick II would have even pragmatically agreed to legislation that was concessionary rather than cooperative, neither would the princes have insisted on such. Frederick II used the political loyalty and practical jurisdictions of the German aristocracy to support his kingly duty of imposing peace, order, and justice upon the German realm. This is shown clearly in the imperial Landfried issued at Mainz in 1235, which explicitly enjoined the princes as loyal vassals to exercise their own jurisdictions in their own localities. The jurisdictional autarky of the German princes was favoured by the crown itself in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries in the interests of order and local peace. The inevitable result was the territorial particularism of churchmen, lay princes, and interstitial cities. However, Frederick II was a ruler of vast territories and \"could not be everywhere at once\". The transference of jurisdiction was a practical solution to secure the further support of the German princes.\nBy the 1226 Golden Bull of Rimini, Frederick had assigned the military order of the Teutonic Knights to complete the conquest and conversion of the Prussian lands. A reconciliation with the Welfs took place in 1235, whereby Otto the Child, grandson of the late Saxon duke Henry the Lion, was named Duke of Brunswick and L\u00fcneburg. The power struggle with the popes continued and resulted in Frederick's excommunication in 1227. In 1239, Pope Gregory IX excommunicated Frederick again, and in 1245 he was condemned as a heretic by a church council. Although Frederick II was perhaps one of the most energetic, imaginative, and capable rulers of the entire Middle Ages, he seemed to be less concerned with drawing the disparate forces in Germany together. Frederick was pragmatic enough to realize that for all his ability and power, his time and focus could only be fully concentrated either north or south of the Alps, where the bulk of his resources lay.\nFrederick II\u2019s most profound legal legacy remains the Constitutions of Melfi promulgated in 1231 in the Kingdom of Sicily. The sophistication of the Constitutions or the \"Liber Augustalis\" set Frederick as perhaps the supreme lawgiver of the Middle Ages. The Constitutions drew upon decades of Siculo-Norman governmental tradition stretching back to his maternal grandfather, Roger II of Sicily. Almost every aspect in Frederick\u2019s tightly-governed kingdom was regulated, from a rigorously centralized judiciary and bureaucracy, to commerce, coinage, financial policy, weights and measures, legal equality for all citizens, protections for women, and even provisions for the environment and public health. Per the Constitutions, Frederick II was \"lex animata\" and ruled as an absolute monarch. The Constitutions have been regarded as perhaps the \"birth certificate\" of the modern continental European state.\nFrom 1240, Frederick II was determined to push through far-reaching reforms to establish the Sicilian kingdom and Imperial Italy as a unified state bound by a centralized administration. The new unified administration was taken over directly by the emperor and his highly trained Sicilian officials whose jurisdiction now ranged across all of Italy. For the rest of Frederick\u2019s reign, there was a continuous movement toward the extension and perfection of this new unified administrative system, with the emperor himself as the driving force. Despite his mighty efforts however, Frederick\u2019s unified Italian state proved ephemeral after his death. The vicars and captains-general provided the prototype for the great signori who dominated Italy in later generations, each a petty sovereign in Frederick\u2019s image\u2014some even continued to claim the title of imperial vicar.\nBy the time of Frederick's death in 1250, the crown in Germany was still formidable and Conrad IV, Frederick\u2019s eldest surviving legitimate son and heir, enjoyed a strong position. However after Conrad\u2019s death in 1254, The Great Interregnum followed which saw several rival claimants elected as King of the Romans in Germany. None of these claimants were able to achieve any position of authority much less the power and imperial grandeur of the Hohenstaufen. The German princes vied for individual advantage and managed to strip many powers away from the diminished monarchy. Rather than establish sovereign states however, many nobles tended to look after their families. Their many male heirs created more and smaller estates, and from a largely free class of officials previously formed, many of these assumed or acquired hereditary rights to administrative and legal offices. These trends compounded political fragmentation within Germany. The period was ended in 1273 with the election of Rudolph of Habsburg, a godson of Frederick.\nEnd of the Staufer dynasty.\nConrad IV was succeeded as duke of Swabia by his only son, two-year-old Conradin. By this time, the office of duke of Swabia had been fully subsumed into the office of the king, and without royal authority had become meaningless. In 1261, attempts to elect young Conradin king were unsuccessful. He also had to defend Sicily against an invasion, sponsored by Pope Urban IV (Jacques Pantal\u00e9on) and Pope Clement IV (Guy Folques), by Charles of Anjou, a brother of the French king. Charles had been promised by the popes the Kingdom of Sicily, where he would replace the relatives of Frederick II. Charles had defeated Conradin's uncle Manfred, King of Sicily, in the Battle of Benevento on 26 February 1266. The king himself, refusing to flee, rushed into the midst of his enemies and was killed. Conradin's campaign to retake control ended with his defeat in 1268 at the Battle of Tagliacozzo, after which he was handed over to Charles, who had him publicly executed at Naples. With Conradin, the direct line of the Dukes of Swabia finally ceased to exist, though most of the later emperors were descended from the Staufer dynasty indirectly.\nThe last member of the dynasty was Manfred's son, Henry [Enrico], who died in captivity at Castel dell'Ovo on 31 October 1318.\nDuring the political decentralization of the late Staufer period, the population had grown from an estimated 8 million in 1200 to about 14 million in 1300, and the number of towns increased tenfold. The most heavily urbanized areas of Germany were in the south and the west. Towns often developed a degree of independence, but many were subordinate to local rulers if not immediate to the emperor. Colonization of the east also continued in the thirteenth century, most notably through the efforts of the Teutonic Knights. German merchants also began trading extensively on the Baltic.\nLegacy.\nThe Kyffh\u00e4user Monument was erected to commemorate Frederick I, and was inaugurated in 1896.\nOn October 29, 1968, the 700th anniversary of the death of Konradin, a society known as \"Society for Staufer History\" () was founded in G\u00f6ppingen.\nThe Castel del Monte, Apulia which was built during the 1240s by the Emperor Frederick II was designated as a World Heritage Site in 1996.\nThe German artist, Hans Kloss, painted his \"\" depicting, in great detail, the history of the House of Hohenstaufen, in Lorch Monastery.\nFrom 2000 to 2018, the Committee of Staufer Friends () has built thirty-eight Staufer steles () in Germany, France, Italy, Austria, Czech Republic and the Netherlands.\nMembers of the Hohenstaufen family.\nHoly Roman Emperors and Kings of the Romans.\nThe first ruling Hohenstaufen, Conrad III, like the last one, Conrad IV, was never crowned emperor. After a 20-year period (Great interregnum 1254\u20131273), the first Habsburg was elected king.\nKings of Italy.\n\"Note: The following kings are already listed above as German Kings\"\nKings of Sicily.\n\"Note: Some of the following kings are already listed above as German Kings\"\nDukes of Swabia.\n\"Note: Some of the following dukes are already listed above as German Kings\"\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
