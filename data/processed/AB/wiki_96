Specific studies within mineralogy include the processes of mineral origin and formation, classification of minerals, their geographical distribution, and their utilization.\nHistory.\nEarly writing on mineralogy, especially on gemstones, comes from ancient Babylonia, the ancient Greco-Roman world, ancient and medieval China, and Sanskrit texts from ancient India and the ancient Islamic world. Books on the subject included the \"Natural History\" of Pliny the Elder, which not only described many different minerals but also explained many of their properties, and Kitab al Jawahir (Book of Precious Stones) by Persian scientist Al-Biruni. The German Renaissance specialist Georgius Agricola wrote works such as \"De re metallica\" (\"On Metals\", 1556) and \"De Natura Fossilium\" (\"On the Nature of Rocks\", 1546) which began the scientific approach to the subject. Systematic scientific studies of minerals and rocks developed in post-Renaissance Europe. The modern study of mineralogy was founded on the principles of crystallography (the origins of geometric crystallography, itself, can be traced back to the mineralogy practiced in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries) and to the microscopic study of rock sections with the invention of the microscope in the 17th century.\nNicholas Steno first observed the law of constancy of interfacial angles (also known as the first law of crystallography) in quartz crystals in 1669. This was later generalized and established experimentally by Jean-Baptiste L. Rom\u00e9 de l'Islee in 1783. Ren\u00e9 Just Ha\u00fcy, the \"father of modern crystallography\", showed that crystals are periodic and established that the orientations of crystal faces can be expressed in terms of rational numbers (law of rational indices), as later encoded in the Miller indices. In 1814, J\u00f6ns Jacob Berzelius introduced a classification of minerals based on their chemistry rather than their crystal structure. William Nicol developed the Nicol prism, which polarizes light, in 1827\u20131828 while studying fossilized wood; Henry Clifton Sorby showed that thin sections of minerals could be identified by their optical properties using a polarizing microscope. James D. Dana published his first edition of \"A System of Mineralogy\" in 1837, and in a later edition introduced a chemical classification that is still the standard. X-ray diffraction was demonstrated by Max von Laue in 1912, and developed into a tool for analyzing the crystal structure of minerals by the father/son team of William Henry Bragg and William Lawrence Bragg.\nMore recently, driven by advances in experimental technique (such as neutron diffraction) and available computational power, the latter of which has enabled extremely accurate atomic-scale simulations of the behaviour of crystals, the science has branched out to consider more general problems in the fields of inorganic chemistry and solid-state physics. It, however, retains a focus on the crystal structures commonly encountered in rock-forming minerals (such as the perovskites, clay minerals, and framework silicates). In particular, the field has made great advances in the understanding of the relationship between the atomic-scale structure of minerals and their function; in nature, prominent examples would be accurate measurement and prediction of the elastic properties of minerals, which has led to new insight into seismological behaviour of rocks and depth-related discontinuities in seismograms of the Earth's mantle. To this end, in their focus on the connection between atomic-scale phenomena and macroscopic properties, the \"mineral sciences\" (as they are now commonly known) display perhaps more of an overlap with materials science than any other discipline.\nPhysical properties.\n \nAn initial step in identifying a mineral is to examine its physical properties, many of which can be measured on a hand sample. These can be classified into density (often given as specific gravity); measures of mechanical cohesion (hardness, tenacity, cleavage, fracture, parting); macroscopic visual properties (luster, color, streak, luminescence, diaphaneity); magnetic and electric properties; radioactivity and solubility in hydrogen chloride ().\n\"Hardness\" is determined by comparison with other minerals. In the Mohs scale, a standard set of minerals is numbered in order of increasing hardness from 1 (talc) to 10 (diamond). A harder mineral will scratch a softer one, so an unknown mineral can be placed in this scale, by which minerals; it scratches and which scratch it. A few minerals, such as calcite and kyanite have a hardness that depends significantly on direction. Hardness can also be measured on an absolute scale using a sclerometer; compared to the absolute scale, the Mohs scale is nonlinear.\n\"Tenacity\" refers to the way a mineral behaves when it is broken, crushed, bent or torn. A mineral can be brittle, malleable, sectile, ductile, flexible or elastic. An important influence on tenacity is the type of chemical bond (\"e.g.,\" ionic or metallic). \nOf the other measures of mechanical cohesion, \"cleavage\" is the tendency to break along certain crystallographic planes. It is described by the quality (\"e.g.\", perfect or fair) and the orientation of the plane in crystallographic nomenclature. \n\"Parting\" is the tendency to break along planes of weakness due to pressure, twinning or exsolution. Where these two kinds of break do not occur, \"fracture\" is a less orderly form that may be \"conchoidal\" (having smooth curves resembling the interior of a shell), \"fibrous\", \"splintery\", \"hackly\" (jagged with sharp edges), or \"uneven\".\nIf the mineral is well crystallized, it will also have a distinctive crystal habit (for example, hexagonal, columnar, botryoidal) that reflects the crystal structure or internal arrangement of atoms. It is also affected by crystal defects and twinning. Many crystals are polymorphic, having more than one possible crystal structure depending on factors such as pressure and temperature.\nCrystal structure.\nThe crystal structure is the arrangement of atoms in a crystal. It is represented by a lattice of points which repeats a basic pattern, called a unit cell, in three dimensions. The lattice can be characterized by its symmetries and by the dimensions of the unit cell. These dimensions are represented by three \"Miller indices\". The lattice remains unchanged by certain symmetry operations about any given point in the lattice: reflection, rotation, inversion, and rotary inversion, a combination of rotation and reflection. Together, they make up a mathematical object called a \"crystallographic point group\" or \"crystal class\". There are 32 possible crystal classes. In addition, there are operations that displace all the points: translation, screw axis, and glide plane. In combination with the point symmetries, they form 230 possible space groups.\nMost geology departments have X-ray powder diffraction equipment to analyze the crystal structures of minerals. X-rays have wavelengths that are the same order of magnitude as the distances between atoms. Diffraction, the constructive and destructive interference between waves scattered at different atoms, leads to distinctive patterns of high and low intensity that depend on the geometry of the crystal. In a sample that is ground to a powder, the X-rays sample a random distribution of all crystal orientations. Powder diffraction can distinguish between minerals that may appear the same in a hand sample, for example quartz and its polymorphs tridymite and cristobalite.\nIsomorphous minerals of different compositions have similar powder diffraction patterns, the main difference being in spacing and intensity of lines. For example, the (halite) crystal structure is space group \"Fm3m\"; this structure is shared by sylvite (), periclase (), bunsenite (), galena (), alabandite (), chlorargyrite (), and osbornite ().\nChemical elements.\nA few minerals are chemical elements, including sulfur, copper, silver, and gold, but the vast majority are compounds. The classical method for identifying composition is \"wet chemical analysis\", which involves dissolving a mineral in an acid such as hydrochloric acid (HCl). The elements in solution are then identified using colorimetry, volumetric analysis or gravimetric analysis.\nSince 1960, most chemistry analysis is done using instruments. One of these, atomic absorption spectroscopy, is similar to wet chemistry in that the sample must still be dissolved, but it is much faster and cheaper. The solution is vaporized and its absorption spectrum is measured in the visible and ultraviolet range. Other techniques are X-ray fluorescence, electron microprobe analysis atom probe tomography and optical emission spectrography.\nOptical.\nIn addition to macroscopic properties such as colour or lustre, minerals have properties that require a polarizing microscope to observe. Recently, the field of digital mineral study and identification has been developing based on the optical properties of minerals, including through the use of artificial intelligence technologies.\nTransmitted light.\nWhen light passes from air or a vacuum into a transparent crystal, some of it is reflected at the surface and some refracted. The latter is a bending of the light path that occurs because the speed of light changes as it goes into the crystal; Snell's law relates the bending angle to the Refractive index, the ratio of speed in a vacuum to speed in the crystal. Crystals whose point symmetry group falls in the cubic system are \"isotropic\": the index does not depend on direction. All other crystals are \"anisotropic\": light passing through them is broken up into two plane polarized rays that travel at different speeds and refract at different angles.\nA polarizing microscope is similar to an ordinary microscope, but it has two plane-polarized filters, a (\"polarizer\") below the sample and an analyzer above it, polarized perpendicular to each other. Light passes successively through the polarizer, the sample and the analyzer. If there is no sample, the analyzer blocks all the light from the polarizer. However, an anisotropic sample will generally change the polarization so some of the light can pass through. Thin sections and powders can be used as samples.\nWhen an isotropic crystal is viewed, it appears dark because it does not change the polarization of the light. However, when it is immersed in a calibrated liquid with a lower index of refraction and the microscope is thrown out of focus, a bright line called a \"Becke line\" appears around the perimeter of the crystal. By observing the presence or absence of such lines in liquids with different indices, the index of the crystal can be estimated, usually to within \u00b1 0.003.\nSystematic.\nSystematic mineralogy is the identification and classification of minerals by their properties. Historically, mineralogy was heavily concerned with taxonomy of the rock-forming minerals. In 1959, the International Mineralogical Association formed the Commission of New Minerals and Mineral Names to rationalize the nomenclature and regulate the introduction of new names. In July 2006, it was merged with the Commission on Classification of Minerals to form the Commission on New Minerals, Nomenclature, and Classification. There are over 6,000 named and unnamed minerals, and about 100 are discovered each year. The \"Manual of Mineralogy\" places minerals in the following classes: native elements, sulfides, sulfosalts, oxides and hydroxides, halides, carbonates, nitrates and borates, sulfates, chromates, molybdates and tungstates, phosphates, arsenates and vanadates, and silicates.\nFormation environments.\nThe environments of mineral formation and growth are highly varied, ranging from slow crystallization at the high temperatures and pressures of igneous melts deep within the Earth's crust to the low temperature precipitation from a saline brine at the Earth's surface.\nVarious possible methods of formation include:\nBiomineralogy.\nBiomineralogy is a cross-over field between mineralogy, paleontology and biology. It is the study of how plants and animals stabilize minerals under biological control, and the sequencing of mineral replacement of those minerals after deposition. It uses techniques from chemical mineralogy, especially isotopic studies, to determine such things as growth forms in living plants and animals as well as things like the original mineral content of fossils.\nA new approach to mineralogy called mineral evolution explores the co-evolution of the geosphere and biosphere, including the role of minerals in the origin of life and processes as mineral-catalyzed organic synthesis and the selective adsorption of organic molecules on mineral surfaces.\nMineral ecology.\nIn 2011, several researchers began to develop a Mineral Evolution Database. This database integrates the crowd-sourced site Mindat.org, which has over 690,000 mineral-locality pairs, with the official IMA list of approved minerals and age data from geological publications.\nThis database makes it possible to apply statistics to answer new questions, an approach that has been called \"mineral ecology\". One such question is how much of mineral evolution is deterministic and how much the result of chance. Some factors are deterministic, such as the chemical nature of a mineral and conditions for its stability; but mineralogy can also be affected by the processes that determine a planet's composition. In a 2015 paper, Robert Hazen and others analyzed the number of minerals involving each element as a function of its abundance. They found that Earth, with over 4800 known minerals and 72 elements, has a power law relationship. The Moon, with only 63 minerals and 24 elements (based on a much smaller sample) has essentially the same relationship. This implies that, given the chemical composition of the planet, one could predict the more common minerals. However, the distribution has a long tail, with 34% of the minerals having been found at only one or two locations. The model predicts that thousands more mineral species may await discovery or have formed and then been lost to erosion, burial or other processes. This implies a role of chance in the formation of rare minerals occur.\nIn another use of big data sets, network theory was applied to a dataset of carbon minerals, revealing new patterns in their diversity and distribution. The analysis can show which minerals tend to coexist and what conditions (geological, physical, chemical and biological) are associated with them. This information can be used to predict where to look for new deposits and even new mineral species.\nUses.\nMinerals are essential to various needs within human society, such as minerals used as ores for essential components of metal products used in various commercial products and machinery, essential components to building materials such as limestone, marble, granite, gravel, glass, plaster, cement, etc. Minerals are also used in fertilizers to enrich the growth of agricultural crops.\nCollecting.\nMineral collecting is also a recreational study and collection hobby, with clubs and societies representing the field. Museums, such as the Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History Hall of Geology, Gems, and Minerals, the Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County, the Carnegie Museum of Natural History, the Natural History Museum, London, and the private Mim Mineral Museum in Beirut, Lebanon, have popular collections of mineral specimens on permanent display.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nExternal links.\nAssociations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;"}

In cold climates these trees store starch in their trunks and roots before winter; the starch is then converted to sugar that rises in the sap in late winter and early spring. Maple trees are tapped by drilling holes into their trunks and collecting the sap, which is heated to evaporate much of the water, leaving the concentrated syrup.\nMaple syrup was first made by the Indigenous people of Northeastern North America. The practice was adopted by European settlers, who gradually changed production methods. Technological improvements in the 1970s further refined syrup processing. Almost all of the world's maple syrup is produced in Canada and the United States.\nMaple syrup is graded based on its colour and taste. Sucrose is the most prevalent sugar in maple syrup. In Canada syrups must be made exclusively from maple sap to qualify as maple syrup and must also be at least 66 per cent sugar. Maple syrup is often used as a condiment for pancakes, waffles, French toast, oatmeal or porridge. It is also used as an ingredient in baking and as a sweetener or flavouring agent.\nSources.\nThree species of maple (\"Acer\") trees are the main sources of maple syrup: the sugar maple (\"A. saccharum\"), the black maple (\"A. nigrum\"), and the red maple (\"A. rubrum\"), because their sap has a high sugar content, two to five per cent. The black maple is included as a subspecies or variety in a more broadly viewed concept of \"A.\u00a0saccharum\", the sugar maple, by some botanists. Of these, the red maple has a shorter season because it buds earlier than sugar and black maples, which alters the flavour of the sap.\nA few other species of maple are also sometimes used as sources of sap for producing maple syrup, including the box elder or Manitoba maple (\"Acer negundo\"), the silver maple (\"A. saccharinum\"), and the bigleaf maple (\"A. macrophyllum\"). In the Southeastern United States Florida sugar maple (\"Acer floridanum\") is occasionally used for maple syrup production.\nSimilar syrups may also be produced from walnut, birch, or palm trees, among other sources.\nHistory.\nIndigenous peoples.\nIndigenous peoples living in northeastern North America were the first groups known to have produced maple syrup and maple sugar. According to Indigenous oral traditions, as well as archaeological evidence, maple tree sap was being processed into syrup long before Europeans arrived in the region. There are no authenticated accounts of how maple syrup production and consumption began, but various legends exist; one of the most popular involves maple sap being used in place of water to cook venison served to a chief. Indigenous tribes developed rituals around syrup-making, celebrating the Sugar Moon (the first full moon of spring) with a Maple Dance. Many aboriginal dishes replaced the salt traditional in European cuisine with maple syrup.\nThe Algonquians recognized maple sap as a source of energy and nutrition. At the beginning of the spring thaw, they made V-shaped incisions in tree trunks; they then inserted reeds or concave pieces of bark to run the sap into clay buckets or tightly woven birch-bark baskets. The maple sap was concentrated first by leaving it exposed to the low temperatures overnight and disposing of the layer of ice that formed on top. Following that, the sap was transported by sled to large fires where it was boiled in clay pots to produce maple syrup. Often, multiple pots were used in conjunction, with the liquid being transferred between them as it grew more concentrated. Contrary to popular belief, syrup was not typically produced by dropping heated stones into wooden bowls, especially in northeast North America where Indigenous cultures had been using clay pots for thousands of years. However, modern and historic sources contain evidence that hot stones may have occasionally been used in the upper Midwest and Canada, where hollowed out logs and birchbark containers typically replaced clay pots.\nColonists.\nIn the early stages of European colonization in northeastern North America, local Indigenous peoples showed the arriving colonists how to tap the trunks of certain types of maples during the spring thaw to harvest the sap. Andr\u00e9 Thevet, the \"Royal Cosmographer of France\", wrote about Jacques Cartier drinking maple sap during his Canadian voyages. By 1680, European settlers and fur traders were involved in harvesting maple products. However, rather than making incisions in the bark, the Europeans used the method of drilling tapholes in the trunks with augers. Prior to the 19th century, processed maple sap was used primarily as a source of concentrated sugar, in both liquid and crystallized-solid form, as cane sugar had to be imported from the West Indies.\nMaple sugaring parties typically began to operate at the start of the spring thaw in regions of woodland with sufficiently large numbers of maples. Syrup makers first bored holes in the trunks, usually more than one hole per large tree; they then inserted wooden spouts into the holes and hung a wooden bucket from the protruding end of each spout to collect the sap. The buckets were commonly made by cutting cylindrical segments from a large tree trunk and then hollowing out each segment's core from one end of the cylinder, creating a seamless, watertight container. Sap filled the buckets, and was then either transferred to larger holding vessels (barrels, large pots, or hollowed-out wooden logs), often mounted on sledges or wagons pulled by draft animals, or carried in buckets or other convenient containers. The sap-collection buckets were returned to the spouts mounted on the trees, and the process was repeated for as long as the flow of sap remained \"sweet\". The specific weather conditions of the thaw period were, and still are, critical in determining the length of the sugaring season. As the weather continues to warm, a maple tree's normal early spring biological process eventually alters the taste of the sap, making it unpalatable, perhaps due to an increase in amino acids.\nThe boiling process was very time-consuming. The harvested sap was transported back to the party's base camp, where it was then poured into large vessels (usually made from metal) and boiled down to achieve the desired concentration. The sap was usually transported using large barrels pulled by horses or oxen to a central collection point, where it was processed either over a fire built out in the open or inside a shelter built for that purpose (the \"sugar shack\").\nSince 1850.\nAround the time of the American Civil War (1861\u20131865), syrup makers started using large, flat sheet metal pans as they were more efficient for boiling than heavy, rounded iron kettles, because of a greater surface area for evaporation. Around this time, cane sugar replaced maple sugar as the dominant sweetener in the US; as a result, producers focused marketing efforts on maple syrup. The first evaporator, used to heat and concentrate sap, was patented in 1858. In 1872 an evaporator was developed that featured two pans and a metal arch or firebox, which greatly decreased boiling time. Around 1900, producers bent the tin that formed the bottom of a pan into a series of flues, which increased the heated surface area of the pan and again decreased boiling time. Some producers also added a finishing pan, a separate batch evaporator, as a final stage in the evaporation process.\nBuckets began to be replaced with plastic bags, which allowed people to see at a distance how much sap had been collected. Syrup producers also began using tractors to haul vats of sap from the trees being tapped (the sugar bush) to the evaporator. Some producers adopted motor-powered tappers and metal tubing systems to convey sap from the tree to a central collection container, but these techniques were not widely used. Heating methods also diversified: modern producers use wood, oil, natural gas, propane, or steam to evaporate sap. Modern filtration methods were perfected to prevent contamination of the syrup.\nA large number of technological changes took place during the 1970s. Plastic tubing systems that had been experimental since the early part of the century were perfected, allowing sap to flow directly from the tree to the evaporator house. Vacuum pumps were added to the tubing systems, and preheaters were developed to recycle heat lost in the steam. Producers developed reverse-osmosis machines to take a portion of water out of the sap before it was boiled, increasing processing efficiency.\nAdvancements have since been made in tubing and vacuum pumps, filtering techniques, high-efficiency preheaters, and storage containers. Ongoing research focuses on pest control and enhanced woodlot management. In 2009 researchers at the University of Vermont unveiled a new type of tap that prevents sap backflow into the tree, thereby reducing bacterial contamination and discouraging the tree from sealing the borehole. Experiments suggest that saplings could be used in plantations in place of mature trees, potentially boosting productivity per acre dramatically. Because saplings have smaller diameters, they require less extreme diurnal temperature changes to trigger freeze\u2013thaw cycles. This enables sap production in warmer climates beyond northeastern North America.\nProcessing.\nOpen pan evaporation methods have been streamlined since colonial days, but remain largely unchanged. Sap must first be collected and boiled down to obtain syrup. Maple syrup is made by boiling between 20 and 50 volumes of sap (depending on its concentration) over an open fire until 1 volume of syrup is obtained, usually at a temperature over the boiling point of water. As the boiling point of water varies with changes in air pressure, the correct value for pure water is determined at the place where the syrup is being produced each time evaporation is begun and periodically throughout the day. Syrup can be boiled entirely over one heat source or can be drawn off into smaller batches and boiled at a more controlled temperature. Defoamers are often added during boiling.\nBoiling the syrup is a tightly controlled process, which ensures appropriate sugar content. Syrup boiled too long will eventually crystallize, whereas under-boiled syrup will be watery, and will quickly spoil. The finished syrup has a density of 66\u00b0 on the Brix scale (a hydrometric scale used to measure sugar solutions). The syrup is then filtered to remove precipitated \"sugar sand\", crystals made up largely of sugar and calcium malate. These crystals are not toxic, but create a \"gritty\" texture in the syrup if not filtered out.\n In addition to open pan evaporation methods, many large producers use the more fuel efficient reverse osmosis procedure to separate the water from the sap. Smaller producers can also use batchwise recirculating reverse osmosis, with the most energy-efficient operation taking the sugar concentration to 25% prior to boiling.\nThe higher the sugar content of the sap, the smaller the volume of sap is needed to obtain the same amount of syrup. To yield 1 unit of syrup, sap at 1.5 per cent sugar content will require 57 units, while sap at 3.5 per cent sugar content only needs 25 units of sap. The sap's sugar content is highly variable and will fluctuate even within the same tree.\nThe filtered syrup is graded and packaged while still hot, usually at a temperature of or greater. The containers are turned over after being sealed to sterilize the cap with the hot syrup. Packages can be made of metal, glass, or coated plastic, depending on volume and target market. The syrup can also be heated longer and further processed to create a variety of other maple products, including maple sugar, maple butter or cream, and maple candy or taffy.\nOff-flavours.\nOff-flavours can occasionally develop during the production of maple syrup, caused by contaminants in the boiling apparatus (such as disinfectants), microorganisms, fermentation byproducts, metallic can leaching, or \"buddy sap\"\u2014an off-flavour that occurs late in the syrup season when tree budding has begun. In some circumstances it is possible to remove off-flavours through processing.\nProduction.\nMaple syrup production is centred in northeastern North America; however, given the correct weather conditions, it can be made wherever suitable species of maple trees grow, such as New Zealand, where there are efforts to establish commercial production.\nA maple syrup production farm is called a \"sugarbush\". Sap is often boiled in a \"sugar shack\" (also known as a \"sugar house\", \"sugar cabin\", \"sugar shanty\", or cabane \u00e0 sucre)\u2014a building louvred at the top to vent the steam from the boiling sap.\nMaples are usually tapped beginning at 30 to 40 years of age. Each tree can support between one and three taps, depending on its trunk diameter. The average maple tree will produce of sap per season, up to per day. This is roughly equal to seven per cent of its total sap. Tap seasons typically happen during late winter and spring and usually last for four to eight weeks, though the exact dates depend on the weather, location, and climate.\nDuring the day, sucrose stored in the roots for the winter rises through the trunk as sugary sap. A hole is bored into the trunk of the tree to allow the sap to flow out of a spile that is tapped in the hole. The taps are left in place for the season, and the sap flows during the day when the temperature is above freezing. Some producers also tap in autumn, though this practice is less common than spring tapping. Maples can continue to be tapped for sap until they are over 100 years old.\nClimate change is dramatically impacting the production of maple syrup. Increased temperatures in late winter/early spring causes the season for maple sap collection to shift earlier in the year, with increased summer temperatures causing a decrease in sugar content in sap, and drought/heavy rainfall impacting forest ecosystems.\nCommerce.\nUntil the 1930s, the United States produced most of the world's maple syrup. Today, after rapid growth in the 1990s, Canada produces more than 80 per cent of the world's maple syrup, producing about in 2016. Within Canada, Quebec is the largest producer, responsible for 72 per cent of the world's output; Canadian exports of maple syrup in 2016 were C$487million (about US$360million), with Quebec accounting for some 90 per cent of this total. In 2023 Canada exported $376million of maple syrup to the United States, $47.8million to Germany, $31.6million to France, and $30.2million to the UK, exporting to 68 countries in total.\nAs of 2022[ [update]], Quebec accounts for 91.6 per cent of maple syrup produced in Canada, followed by New Brunswick at 4.7 per cent and Ontario at 3.4 per cent. However, 96.8 per cent of exported Canadian maple syrup originated from Quebec, whereas 2.6 per cent of exported syrup originated from New Brunswick, and the remaining 0.6 per cent from all other provinces. Ontario holds the most maple syrup farms in Canada outside of Quebec, with 389 maple syrup producers in 2021. This is followed by New Brunswick, with 114 producers; and Nova Scotia, with 39 producers.\nAs of 2016, Quebec had some 7,300 producers working with 13,500 farmers, collectively making over of syrup. Production in Quebec is controlled through a supply management system, with producers receiving quota allotments from the government sanctioned Quebec Maple Syrup Producers (QMSP; ), which also maintains reserves of syrup, although there is a black-market trade in Quebec product. In 2017 the QMSP mandated increased output of maple syrup production, attempting to establish Quebec's dominance in the world market.\nThe Canadian provinces of Manitoba and Saskatchewan produce maple syrup using the sap of the box elder or Manitoba maple (\"Acer negundo\"). In 2011 there were 67 maple syrup producers in Manitoba and 24 in Saskatchewan. A Manitoba maple tree's yield is usually less than half that of a similar sugar maple tree. Manitoba maple syrup has a slightly different flavour from sugar-maple syrup, because it contains less sugar and the tree's sap flows more slowly. British Columbia is home to a growing maple sugar industry using sap from the bigleaf maple, which is native to the West Coast of the United States and Canada. In 2011 there were 82 maple syrup producers in British Columbia.\nVermont has long been the largest US producer, with a record produced in 2022. In 2019 it led with over , followed by New York with and Maine with . Wisconsin, Ohio, New Hampshire, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Massachusetts and Connecticut all produced marketable quantities of maple syrup.\nMaple syrup has been produced on a small scale in some other countries, notably Japan and South Korea. However, in South Korea in particular, it is traditional to consume maple sap, called \"gorosoe\", instead of processing it into syrup.\nMarkings.\nUnder Canadian maple product regulations, containers of maple syrup must include the words \"maple syrup\", its grade name and net quantity in litres or millilitres, on the main display panel with a minimum font size of 1.6mm. If the maple syrup is of Canada Grade A level, the name of the colour class must appear on the label in both English and French. Also, the lot number or production code, and either: (1) the name and address of the sugar bush establishment, packing or shipper establishment, or (2) the first dealer and the registration number of the packing establishment, must be labelled on any display panel other than the bottom.\nGrades.\nFollowing an effort from the International Maple Syrup Institute (IMSI) and many maple syrup producer associations, both Canada and the United States have altered their laws regarding the classification of maple syrup to be uniform. Whereas in the past each state or province had their own laws on the classification of maple syrup, now those laws define a unified grading system. This had been a work in progress for several years, and most of the finalization of the new grading system was made in 2014. The Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) announced in the \"Canada Gazette\" on 28 June 2014 that rules for the sale of maple syrup would be amended to include new descriptors, at the request of the IMSI.\nAs of 31 December 2014, the CFIA and as of 2 March 2015, the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) Agricultural Marketing Service issued revised standards intended to harmonize Canadian and United States regulations on the classification of maple syrup as follows:\nAs long as maple syrup does not have an off-flavour, is of a uniform colour, and is free from turbidity and sediment, it can be labelled as one of the A grades. If it exhibits any problems, it does not meet Grade A requirements, and then must be labelled as \"processing grade\" maple syrup and may not be sold in containers smaller than . If maple syrup does not meet the requirements of processing-grade maple syrup (including a fairly characteristic maple taste), it is classified as substandard.\nThis grading system was accepted and made law by most maple-producing states and provinces, and became compulsory in Canada as of 13 December 2016. Vermont, in an effort to \"jump-start\" the new grading regulations, adopted the new grading system as of 1 January 2014, after the grade changes passed the US Senate and House in 2013. Maine passed a bill to take effect as soon as both Canada and the United States adopted the new grades. In New York the new grade changes became law on 1 January 2015. New Hampshire did not require legislative approval and so the new grade laws became effective as of 16 December 2014, and producer compliance was required as of 1 January 2016.\nGolden and amber grades typically have a milder flavour than dark and very dark, which are both dark and have an intense maple flavour. The darker grades of syrup are used primarily for cooking and baking, although some specialty dark syrups are produced for table use. Syrup harvested earlier in the season tends to yield a lighter colour. With the new grading system, the classification of maple syrup depends ultimately on its internal transmittance at 560nm wavelength through a 10mm sample. Golden must have 75 per cent or more transmittance, amber must have 50.0 to 74.9 per cent transmittance, dark must have 25.0 to 49.9 per cent transmittance, and very dark is any product having less than 25.0 per cent transmittance.\nOld grading system.\nIn Canada maple syrup was classified prior to 31 December 2014 by the Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) as one of three grades, each with several colour classes:\nProducers in Ontario or Quebec may have followed either federal or provincial grading guidelines. Quebec's and Ontario's guidelines differed slightly from the federal:\nA typical year's yield for a maple syrup producer will be about 25 to 30 per cent of each of the #1 colours, 10 per cent #2 amber, and 2 per cent #3 dark.\nThe United States used different grading standards\u2009\u2060\u2013\u2009\u2060some states still do as they await state regulation. Maple syrup was divided into two major grades:\nIn Massachusetts the Grade B was renamed \"Grade A Very Dark, Strong Taste\"\nThe Vermont Agency of Agriculture Food and Markets used a similar grading system of colour, and is roughly equivalent, especially for lighter syrups, but using letters: \"AA\", \"A\", etc. The Vermont grading system differed from the US system in maintaining a slightly higher standard of product density (measured on the Baum\u00e9 scale). New Hampshire maintained a similar standard, but not a separate state grading scale. The Vermont-graded product had 0.9 per cent more sugar and less water in its composition than US-graded. One grade of syrup not for table use, called commercial or Grade C, was also produced under the Vermont system.\nPacking regulations.\nIn Canada the packing of maple syrup must follow the \"Packing\" conditions stated in the maple products regulations, or utilize the equivalent Canadian or imported grading system.\nAs stated in the maple products regulations, Canadian maple syrup can be classified as \"Canadian Grade A\" and \"Canadian Processing Grade\". Any maple syrup container under these classifications should be filled to at least 90% of the bottle size while still containing the net quantity of syrup product as stated on the label. Every container of maple syrup must be new if it has a capacity of 5 litres or less or is marked with a grade name. Every container of maple sugar must also be new if it has a capacity of less than 5kg or is either exported out of Canada or conveyed from one province to another.\nEach maple syrup product must be verified clean if it follows a grade name or if it is exported out of the province in which it was originally manufactured.\nNutrition.\nThe basic ingredient in maple syrup is the sap from the xylem of sugar maple or various other species of maple trees. It consists primarily of sucrose and water, with small amounts of the monosaccharides glucose and fructose from the inverted sugar created in the boiling process.\nIn a 100g amount maple syrup provides 260 calories and is composed of 32 per cent water by weight, 67 per cent carbohydrates (90 per cent of which are sugars), and no appreciable protein or fat (table). Maple syrup is generally low in overall micronutrient content, although manganese and riboflavin are at high levels along with moderate amounts of zinc and calcium (right table). It also contains trace amounts of amino acids which increase in content as sap flow occurs.\nMaple syrup contains a wide variety of polyphenols and volatile organic compounds, including vanillin, hydroxybutanone, lignans, propionaldehyde, and numerous organic acids. It is not yet known exactly all compounds responsible for the distinctive flavour of maple syrup, although primary flavour-contributing compounds are maple furanone (5-ethyl-3-hydroxy-4-methyl-2(5H)-furanone), strawberry furanone, and maltol. New compounds have been identified in maple syrup, one of which is quebecol, created when the maple sap is boiled to create syrup. Its sweetness derives from a high content of sucrose (99% of total sugars). Its brown colour \u2013 a significant factor in the appeal and the quality grading of maple syrup \u2013 develops during thermal evaporation.\nOne author described maple syrup as \"a unique ingredient, smooth- and silky-textured, with a sweet, distinctive flavour\u00a0\u2013 hints of caramel with overtones of toffee will not do\u00a0\u2013 and a rare colour, amber set alight. Maple flavour is, well, maple flavour, uniquely different from any other.\" Agriculture Canada has developed a \"flavour wheel\" that details 91 unique flavours that can be present in maple syrup. These flavours are divided into 13 families: vanilla, burnt, milky, fruity, floral, spicy, foreign (deterioration or fermentation), foreign (environment), maple, confectionery, plant (herbaceous), plant (forest, humus or cereals), and plant (ligneous). These flavours are evaluated using a procedure similar to wine tasting. Other culinary experts praise its unique flavour. Environmental factors, including weather and soil type, impact flavour.\nMaple syrup and its various artificial imitations are widely used as toppings for pancakes, waffles, and French toast in North America. They also serve as flavouring for foods such as fritters, ice cream, porridge, fresh fruit, bacon, and sausages. It is also used as sweetener for granola, applesauce, baked beans, candied sweet potatoes, winter squash, cakes, pies, breads, tea, coffee, and hot toddies.\nImitations.\nIn Canada maple syrup must be made entirely from maple sap, and syrup must have a density of 66\u00b0 on the Brix scale to be marketed as maple syrup. In the United States maple syrup must be made almost entirely from maple sap, although small amounts of substances such as salt may be added. Labelling laws prohibit imitation syrups from having \"maple\" in their names unless the finished product contains 10 per cent or more of natural maple syrup.\nTable syrup, also known as pancake syrup and waffle syrup, is often used as a substitute for maple syrup. Table syrups are mostly made using corn syrup and high-fructose corn syrup, giving them a less complex and more artificial flavour compared to maple syrup. In the United States consumers generally prefer imitation syrups, likely because of the significantly lower cost and sweeter flavour; they typically cost about , whereas authentic maple syrup costs as of 2015.\nIn 2016 maple syrup producers from nine US states petitioned the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to regulate labelling of products containing maple syrup or using the word \"maple\" in manufactured products, indicating that imitation maple products contained insignificant amounts of natural maple syrup. In September 2016 the FDA published a consumer advisory to carefully inspect the ingredient list of products labelled as \"maple\".\nCultural significance.\nMaple products are considered emblematic of Canada, and are frequently sold in tourist shops and airports as souvenirs from Canada. The sugar maple's leaf has come to symbolize Canada, and is depicted on the country's flag. Several US states, including West Virginia, New York, Vermont, and Wisconsin, have the sugar maple as their state tree. A scene of sap collection is depicted on the Vermont state quarter, issued in 2001.\nMaple syrup and maple sugar were used during the American Civil War and by abolitionists in the years before the war because most cane sugar and molasses were produced by enslaved people in the South. Because of food rationing during the Second World War, people in the northeastern United States were encouraged to stretch their sugar rations by sweetening foods with maple syrup and maple sugar, and recipe books were printed to help housewives employ this alternative source.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nCited works.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Its name derives from Ancient Greek (\"makr\u00f3n\") 'long' because it was originally used to mark long or heavy syllables in Greco-Roman metrics. It now more often marks a long vowel. In the International Phonetic Alphabet, the macron is used to indicate a mid-tone; the sign for a long vowel is instead a modified triangular colon \u27e8\u27e9.\nThe opposite is the breve \u27e8\u02d8\u27e9, which marks a short or light syllable or a short vowel.\nUses.\nSyllable weight.\nIn Greco-Roman metrics and in the description of the metrics of other literatures, the macron was introduced and is still widely used in dictionaries and educational materials to mark a long (heavy) syllable. Even relatively recent classical Greek and Latin dictionaries are still concerned with indicating only the length (weight) of syllables; that is why most still do not indicate the length of vowels in syllables that are otherwise metrically determined. Many textbooks about Ancient Rome and Greece use the macron, even if it was not actually used at that time (an apex was used if vowel length was marked in Latin).\nVowel length.\nThe following languages or transliteration systems use the macron to mark long vowels:\nTone.\nThe following languages or alphabets use the macron to mark tones:\nOmission.\nSometimes the macron marks an omitted \"n\" or \"m\", like the tilde, in which context it is referred to as a \"nasal suspension\":\nLetter extension.\nIn romanizations of Hebrew, the macron below is typically used to mark the begadkefat consonant lenition. However, for typographical reasons a regular macron is used on \"p\" and \"g\" instead: \"p\u0304, \u1e21\".\nThe macron is used in the orthography of a number of vernacular languages of the Solomon Islands and Vanuatu, particularly those first transcribed by Anglican missionaries. The macron has no unique value, and is simply used to distinguish between two different phonemes.\nThus, in several languages of the Banks Islands, including Mwotlap, the simple \"m\" stands for , but an \"m\" with a macron (m\u0304) is a rounded labial-velar nasal ; while the simple \"n\" stands for the common alveolar nasal , an \"n\" with macron (n\u0304) represents the velar nasal ; the vowel \u0113 stands for a (short) higher by contrast with plain \"e\" ; likewise \u014d contrasts with plain \"o\" .\nIn Hiw orthography, the consonant \"r\u0304\" stands for the prestopped velar lateral approximant .\nIn Araki, the same symbol \"r\u0304\" encodes the alveolar trill \u2013 by contrast with \"r\", which encodes the alveolar flap .\nIn Bislama (orthography before 1995), Lamenu and Lewo, a macron is used on two letters \"\". \"m\u0304\" represents , and \"p\u0304\" represents . The orthography after 1995 (which has no diacritics) has these written as \"mw\" and \"pw\".\nIn Kokota, \"\u1e21\" is used for the velar stop , but \"g\" without macron is the voiced velar fricative .\nIn Marshallese, a macron is used on four letters \u2013 ' \u2013 whose pronunciations differ from the unmarked '. Marshallese uses a vertical vowel system with three to four vowel phonemes, but traditionally their allophones have been written out, so vowel letters with macron are used for some of these allophones. Though the standard diacritic involved is a macron, there are no other diacritics used \"above\" letters, so in practice other diacritics can and have been used in less polished writing or print, yielding nonstandard letters like \", depending on displayability of letters in computer fonts.\nIn Obolo, the simple n stands for the common alveolar nasal , while an \"n\" with macron (n\u0304) represents the velar nasal .\nOther uses.\nAlso, in some instances, a diacritic will be written like a macron, although it represents another diacritic whose standard form is different:\nMedicine.\nContinuing previous Latin scribal abbreviations, letters with combining macron can be used in various European languages to represent the overlines indicating various medical abbreviations, particularly including:\nNote, however, that abbreviations involving the letter h take their macron halfway up the ascending line rather than at the normal height for unicode macrons and overlines: \u0127. This is separately encoded in Unicode with the symbols using bar diacritics and appears shorter than other macrons in many fonts.\nMathematics and science.\nThe overline is a typographical symbol visually similar to the macron, used in a number of ways in mathematics and science. For example, it is used to represent complex conjugation:\nformula_1\nand to represent a line segment in geometry (e.g., formula_2), sample means in statistics (e.g., formula_3) and negations in logic. It is also used in Hermann\u2013Mauguin notation.\nMusic.\nIn music, the tenuto marking resembles the macron.\nThe macron is also used in German lute tablature to distinguish repeating alphabetic characters.\nTechnical notes.\nThe Unicode Standard encodes two free-standing (\"spacing\") characters for backwards compatibility, 13 precomposed characters with macron alone, a number of other precomposed characters that have a macron \"and\" another diacritic, and two combining diacritic forms that may be used with arbitrary base characters to create further glyphs.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "19894", "revid": "20248368", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19894", "title": "Mosque", "text": "Place of worship for Muslims\nA mosque ( ), also called a masjid ( ), is a place of worship for Muslims. The term usually refers to a covered building, but can be any place where Islamic prayers are performed; such as an outdoor courtyard.\nOriginally, mosques were simple places of prayer for the early Muslims, and may have been open spaces rather than elaborate buildings. In the first stage of Islamic architecture (650\u2013750 CE), early mosques comprised open and closed covered spaces enclosed by walls, often with minarets, from which the Islamic call to prayer was issued on a daily basis. It is typical of mosque buildings to have a special ornamental niche (a \"mihrab\") set into the wall in the direction of the city of Mecca (the \"qibla\"), which Muslims must face during prayer, as well as a facility for ritual cleansing (\"wudu\"). The pulpit (\"minbar\"), from which public sermons (\"khutbah\") are delivered on the event of Friday prayer, was, in earlier times, characteristic of the central city mosque, but has since become common in smaller mosques. To varying degrees, mosque buildings are designed so that there are segregated spaces for men and women. This basic pattern of organization has assumed different forms depending on the region, period, and Islamic denomination.\nIn addition to being places of worship in Islam, mosques also serve as locations for funeral services and funeral prayers, marriages (nikah), vigils during Ramadan, business agreements, collection and distribution of alms, and homeless shelters. To this end, mosques have historically been multi-purpose buildings functioning as community centres, courts of law, and religious schools. In modern times, they have also preserved their role as places of religious instruction and debate. Special importance is accorded to, in descending order of importance: al-Masjid al-Haram in the city of Mecca, where Hajj and Umrah are performed; the Prophet's Mosque in the city of Medina, where Muhammad is buried; and al-Aqsa Mosque in the city of Jerusalem, where Muslims believe that Muhammad ascended to heaven to meet God around 621 CE.\nDuring and after the early Muslim conquests, mosques were established outside of Arabia in the hundreds; many synagogues, churches, and temples were converted into mosques and thus influenced Islamic architectural styles over the centuries. While most pre-modern mosques were funded by charitable endowments (\"waqf\"), the modern-day trend of government regulation of large mosques has been countered by the rise of privately funded mosques, many of which serve as bases for different streams of Islamic revivalism and social activism.\nEtymology.\nThe word \"mosque\" entered the English language from the French \"mosqu\u00e9e\", probably derived from Italian \"moschea\" (a variant of Italian \"moscheta\"), from either Middle Armenian \u0574\u0566\u056f\u056b\u0569 (\"mzkit\"), Medieval (\"masg\u00eddion\"), or Spanish \"mezquita\", from (\"site of prostration in prayer\" and hence a place of worship), either from Nabataean \"masg\u0115dh\u0101\u0301\" or from (meaning \"to prostrate\"), probably ultimately from Nabataean Arabic \"masg\u0115dh\u0101\u0301\" or Aramaic \"s\u0115gh\u0113dh\".\nHistory.\nOrigins.\nIslam was established in Arabia during the lifetime of Muhammad in the 7th century CE. The first mosque in history could be either the sanctuary built around the \"Ka'bah\" in Mecca, known today as \"Al-Masjid al-Haram\" ('The Sacred Mosque'), or the Quba Mosque in Medina, the first structure built by Muhammad upon his emigration from Mecca in 622 CE, both located in the Hejaz region in present-day Saudi Arabia.\nOther scholars reference Islamic tradition and passages of the Quran, according to which Islam as a religion precedes Muhammad, and includes previous prophets such as Abraham. In Islamic tradition, Abraham is credited with having built the \"Ka'bah\" in Mecca, and consequently its sanctuary, \"Al-Masjid al-Haram\", which is seen by Muslims as the first mosque that existed. A hadith in Sahih al-Bukhari states that the sanctuary of the \"Ka'bah\" was the first mosque on Earth, with the second mosque being Al-Aqsa in Jerusalem, which is also associated with Abraham. Since as early as 638 CE, the Sacred Mosque of Mecca has been expanded on several occasions to accommodate the increasing number of Muslims who either live in the area or make the annual pilgrimage known as \"Hajj\" to the city.\nEither way, after the Quba Mosque, Muhammad went on to establish another mosque in Medina, which is now known as \"Al-Masjid an-Nabawi\" ('The Prophet's Mosque'). Built on the site of his home, Muhammad participated in the construction of the mosque himself and helped pioneer the concept of the mosque as the focal point of the Islamic city. The Prophet's Mosque is considered by some scholars of Islamic architecture to be the first mosque. The mosque had a roof supported by columns made of palm tree trunks and it included a large courtyard, a motif common among mosques built since then. Rebuilt and expanded over time, it soon became a larger hypostyle structure. It probably served as a model for the construction of early mosques elsewhere. It introduced some of the features still common in today's mosques, including the niche at the front of the prayer space known as the \"mihrab\" (first added in the Umayyad period) and the tiered pulpit called the \"minbar\".\nDiffusion and evolution.\nThe Umayyad Caliphate was particularly instrumental in spreading Islam and establishing mosques within the Levant, as the Umayyads constructed among the most revered mosques in the region: Al-Aqsa Mosque and Dome of the Rock in Jerusalem, and the Umayyad Mosque in Damascus. They also established mosques in other regions including the Great Mosque of Kairouan, and renovated and expanded other mosques like the Prophet's Mosque in Medina (which saw the introduction of the first mihrab) the Great Mosque of Sanaa, the Masjid al-Haram in Mecca, and the mosques of Kufa, Basra and Amr ibn Al-As (in Cairo). The designs of the Dome of the Rock and the Umayyad Mosque were influenced by Byzantine architecture, a trend that continued much later with the rise of the Ottoman Empire.\nThe Great Mosque of Kairouan in present-day Tunisia was the first mosque built in the Maghreb (northwest Africa), with its present form (dating from the ninth century) serving as a model for other Islamic places of worship in the Maghreb. It was the first in the region to incorporate a square minaret, which was characteristic of later Maghrebi mosques, and includes naves akin to a basilica. Those features can also be found in Andalusi mosques, including the Great Mosque of Cordoba, as they tended to reflect the architecture of the Moors instead of their Visigoth predecessors. Still, some elements of Visigothic architecture, like horseshoe arches, were infused into the mosque architecture of Spain and the Maghreb.\nMuslim empires were instrumental in the evolution and spread of mosques. Although mosques were first established in India during the seventh century, they were not commonplace across the subcontinent until the arrival of the Mughals in the 16th and 17th centuries. Reflecting their Timurid origins, Mughal-style mosques included onion domes, pointed arches, and elaborate circular minarets, features common in the Persian and Central Asian styles. The Jama Masjid in Delhi and the Badshahi Mosque in Lahore, built in a similar manner in the mid-17th century, remain two of the largest mosques on the Indian subcontinent.\nOne of first grand mosques in East Asia was established in the eighth century in Xi'an. The Great Mosque of Xi'an, whose current building dates from the 18th century, does not replicate the features often associated with mosques elsewhere. Minarets were initially prohibited by the state. Following traditional Chinese architecture, the Great Mosque of Xi'an, like many other mosques in eastern China, resembles a pagoda, with a green roof instead of the yellow roof common on imperial structures in China. Mosques in western China were more likely to incorporate elements, like domes and minarets, traditionally seen in mosques elsewhere.\nA similar integration of foreign and local influences could be seen on the Indonesian islands of Sumatra and Java, where mosques, including the Demak Great Mosque, were first established in the 15th century. Early Javanese mosques took design cues from Hindu, Buddhist, and Chinese architectural influences, with tall timber, multi-level roofs similar to the pagodas of Balinese Hindu temples; the ubiquitous Islamic dome did not appear in Indonesia until the 19th century. In turn, the Javanese style influenced the styles of mosques in Indonesia's Austronesian neighbors: Malaysia, Brunei, and the Philippines.\nAnother indeginous style to West Africa is the Sudano-Sahelian with its use of mudbricks and adobe plaster, examples of this style include the Great Mosque of Djenn\u00e9 in Mali, the largest mud-brick building in sub-Saharan Africa, and the Agadez Grand Mosque, in Niger.\nThe Ottomans developed an architectural style characterized by large central domes (sometimes surrounded by multiple smaller domes), pencil-shaped minarets, and open fa\u00e7ades. Mosques from the Ottoman period are still scattered across Eastern Europe, but the most rapid growth in the number of mosques in Europe has occurred within the past century as more Muslims have migrated to the continent. Many major European cities are home to mosques, like the Grand Mosque of Paris, that incorporate domes, minarets, and other features often found with mosques in Muslim-majority countries. The first mosque in North America was founded by Albanian Americans in 1915, but the continent's oldest surviving mosque, the Mother Mosque of America, was built in 1934. As in Europe, the number of American mosques has rapidly increased in recent decades as Muslim immigrants, particularly from South Asia, have come in the United States. Greater than forty percent of mosques in the United States were constructed after 2000.\nReligious functions.\nPrayers.\nThere are two holidays (\"Eids\") in the Islamic calendar: \"\u02bf\u012ad al-Fi\u1e6dr\" and \"\u02bf\u012ad al-A\u1e0d\u1e25\u0101\", during which there are special prayers held at mosques in the morning. These Eid prayers are supposed to be offered in large groups, and so, in the absence of an outdoor \"Eidgah\", a large mosque will normally host them for their congregants as well as the congregants of smaller local mosques. Some mosques will even rent convention centers or other large public buildings to hold the large number of Muslims who attend. Mosques, especially those in countries where Muslims are the majority, will also host Eid prayers outside in courtyards, town squares or on the outskirts of town in an \"Eidgah\".\nRamadan.\nIslam's holiest month, \"Rama\u1e0d\u0101n\", is observed through many events. As Muslims must fast during the day during Ramadan, mosques will host \"If\u1e6d\u0101r\" dinners after sunset and the fourth required prayer of the day, that is \"Maghrib\". Food is provided, at least in part, by members of the community, thereby creating daily potluck dinners. Because of the community contribution necessary to serve \"iftar\" dinners, mosques with smaller congregations may not be able to host the \"iftar\" dinners daily. Some mosques will also hold \"Su\u1e25\u016br\" meals before dawn to congregants attending the first required prayer of the day, \"Fajr\". As with iftar dinners, congregants usually provide the food for suhoor, although able mosques may provide food instead. Mosques will often invite poorer members of the Muslim community to share in beginning and breaking the fasts, as providing charity during Ramadan is regarded in Islam as especially honorable.\nFollowing the last obligatory daily prayer (\"\u02bfIsh\u0101\u02be\") special, optional \"Tar\u0101w\u012b\u1e25\" prayers are offered in larger mosques. During each night of prayers, which can last for up to two hours each night, usually one member of the community who has memorized the entire Quran (a Hafiz) will recite a segment of the book. Sometimes, several such people (not necessarily of the local community) take turns to do this. During the last ten days of Ramadan, larger mosques will host all-night programs to observe \"Laylat al-Qadr\", the night Muslims believe that Muhammad first received Quranic revelations. On that night, between sunset and sunrise, mosques employ speakers to educate congregants in attendance about Islam. Mosques or the community usually provide meals periodically throughout the night\nDuring the last ten days of Ramadan, larger mosques within the Muslim community will host \"I\u02bftik\u0101f\", a practice in which at least one Muslim man from the community must participate. Muslims performing itikaf are required to stay within the mosque for ten consecutive days, often in worship or learning about Islam. As a result, the rest of the Muslim community is responsible for providing the participants with food, drinks, and whatever else they need during their stay.\nCharity.\nThe third of the Five Pillars of Islam states that Muslims are required to give approximately one-fortieth of their wealth to charity as \"Zakat\". Since mosques form the center of Muslim communities, they are where Muslims go to both give \"zakat\" and, if necessary, collect it. Before the holiday of \"Eid ul-Fitr\", mosques also collect a special \"zakat\" that is supposed to assist in helping poor Muslims attend the prayers and celebrations associated with the holiday.\nArchitecture.\nStyles.\n\"Arab-plan\" or hypostyle mosques are the earliest type of mosques, pioneered under the Umayyad Dynasty. These mosques have square or rectangular plans with an enclosed courtyard (\"sahn\") and covered prayer hall. Historically, in the warm Middle Eastern and Mediterranean climates, the courtyard served to accommodate the large number of worshippers during Friday prayers. Most early hypostyle mosques had flat roofs on prayer halls, which required the use of numerous columns and supports. Frequently, hypostyle mosques have outer arcades (\"riwaq\") so that visitors can enjoy the shade. Arab-plan mosques were constructed mostly under the Umayyad and Abbasid dynasties. The simplicity of the Arab plan limited the opportunities for further development, the mosques consequently losing popularity. One of the most notable hypostyle mosques is the Great Mosque of Cordoba in Spain, the building being supported by over 850 columns, other notable examples include the Umayyad Mosques of Damascus and Aleppo, Qibli Mosque (part of Al-Aqsa) in Jerusalem and the Great Mosques of Samarra (Al-Malwiya Mosque and Abu Dulaf Mosque). Those Arab-plan or hypostyle mosques are based on the early Prophet's mosque in Medina.\nThe first departure within mosque design started in Persia (Iran). The Persians had inherited a rich architectural legacy from the earlier Persian dynasties, and they began incorporating elements from earlier Parthian and Sassanid designs into their mosques, influenced by buildings such as the Palace of Ardashir and the Sarvestan Palace. Thus, Islamic architecture witnessed the introduction of such structures as domes and large, arched entrances, referred to as \"iwans\". During Seljuq rule, as Islamic mysticism was on the rise, the four-iwan arrangement took form. The four-iwan format, finalized by the Seljuqs, and later inherited by the Safavids, firmly established the courtyard fa\u00e7ade of such mosques, with the towering gateways at every side, as more important than the actual buildings themselves. They typically took the form of a square-shaped central courtyard with large entrances at each side, giving the impression of gateways to the spiritual world. The Persians also introduced Persian gardens into mosque designs. Soon, a distinctly Persian style of mosques started appearing that would significantly influence the designs of later Timurid, and also Mughal, mosque designs.\nThe Ottomans introduced central dome mosques in the 15th century. These mosques have a large dome centered over the prayer hall. In addition to having a large central dome, a common feature is smaller domes that exist off-center over the prayer hall or throughout the rest of the mosque, where prayer is not performed. This style was heavily influenced by Byzantine architecture with its use of large central domes. \nOne of the most notable imperial Ottoman mosques is the S\u00fcleymaniye Mosque in Istanbul, the mosque has foundations that goes 12 m into the ground, and it is covered by a large central dome that measures 26 meters in diameter, that is contained within 2 semi-domes, and small domes on either side that measure between 5 to 10 m in diameter, on the other hand the latter bigger dome of the Selmiye Mosque in Edrine, which measures 31.1 m in diameter is held by giant squinches instead of the semi-domes both mosques are considered to be the best works of Mimar Sinan.\nDecoration.\nIslam forbids figurative art, on the grounds that the artist must not imitate God's creation. Mosques are, therefore, decorated with abstract patterns and beautiful inscriptions. Decoration is often concentrated around doorways and the \"mi\u1e25r\u0101b\". Tiles are used widely in mosques. They lend themselves to pattern-making, can be made with beautiful subtle colors, and can create a cool atmosphere, an advantage in the hot Arab countries. Quotations from the Quran often adorn mosque interiors. These texts are meant to inspire people by their beauty, while also reminding them of the words of Allah.\nPrayer hall.\nThe prayer hall, also known as the \"mu\u1e63all\u00e1\" (), rarely has furniture; chairs and pews are generally absent from the prayer hall so as to allow as many worshipers as possible to line the room. Some mosques have Islamic calligraphy and Quranic verses on the walls to create a more religious atmosphere for worshippers.\nOften, a limited part of the prayer hall is sanctified formally as a \"masjid\" in the \"shar\u012b\u02bfah\" sense (although the term \"masjid\" is also used for the larger mosque complex as well). Once designated, there are onerous limitations on the use of this formally designated \"masjid\", and it may not be used for any purpose other than worship; restrictions that do not necessarily apply to the rest of the prayer area, and to the rest of the mosque complex (although such uses may be restricted by the conditions of the \"waqf\" that owns the mosque).\nIn many mosques, especially the early congregational mosques, the prayer hall is built in the hypostyle form (the roof held up by a multitude of columns). One of the finest examples of the hypostyle-plan mosques is the Great Mosque of Kairouan in Tunisia.\nUsually opposite the entrance to the prayer hall is the \"qibla\" wall (the direction of Mecca, and thus the direction towards which Muslims should face for prayer), the visually emphasized area inside the prayer hall. The \"qibla\" wall should, in a properly oriented mosque, be set perpendicular to a line leading to Mecca, where the Kaaba is located. Congregants pray in rows parallel to the qiblah wall and thus arrange themselves so they face Mecca. In the \"qibla\" wall, usually at its center, is the \"mi\u1e25r\u0101b\", a niche or depression indicating the direction of Mecca. Usually the \"mihrab\" is not occupied by furniture either. A raised \"minbar\" (pulpit) is located to the right side of the \"mihrab\" for a \"kha\u1e6d\u012bb\" (preacher), or some other speaker, to offer a \"khu\u1e6dbah\" (sermon) during the ritual Friday prayers.\nThe \"mihrab\" serves as the location where the imam or mullah leads the five daily prayers on a regular basis. Left to the \"mihrab\", in the front left corner of the mosque, sometimes there is a \"kursu\" (Turkish: , Bosnian: \"\"), a small elevated plateau (rarely with a chair or other type of seat) used for less formal preaching and speeches.\nMihrab and minbar.\nA \"mi\u1e25r\u0101b\", also spelled as \"mehrab\" is a semicircular niche in the wall of a mosque that faces the \"qiblah\" (i.e. the \"front\" of the mosque); the imam stands in this niche and leads prayer. Given that the imam typically stands alone in the frontmost row, this niche's practical effect is to save unused space. The \"minbar\" is a pulpit from which the Friday sermon is delivered. While the \"minbar\" of Muhammad was a simple chair, later it became larger and attracted artistic attention. Some remained made of wood, albeit exquisitely carved, while others were made of marble and featured friezes.\nMinarets.\nA common feature in mosques is the minaret, the tall, slender tower that usually is situated at one of the corners of the mosque structure. The top of the minaret is always the highest point in mosques that have one, and often the highest point in the immediate area.\nThe origin of the minaret and its initial functions are not clearly known and have long been a topic of scholarly discussion. The earliest mosques lacked minarets, and the call to prayer was often performed from smaller structures or elevated platforms. The early Muslim community of Medina gave the call to prayer from the doorway or the roof of the house of Muhammad, which doubled as a place for prayer. The first confirmed minarets in the form of towers date from the early 9th century under Abbasid rule and they did not become a standard feature of mosques until the 11th century. These first minaret towers were placed in the middle of the wall opposite the qibla wall. Among them, the minaret of the Great Mosque of Kairouan in Tunisia, dating from 836, is well-preserved and is one of the oldest surviving minarets in the world today.\nBefore the five required daily prayers, a \"Mu'adhdhin\" () calls the worshippers to prayer from the minaret. In many countries like Singapore where Muslims are not the majority, mosques are prohibited from loudly broadcasting the \"Adh\u0101n\" (, Call to Prayer), although it is supposed to be said loudly to the surrounding community. The \"adhan\" is required before every prayer. Nearly every mosque assigns a \"muezzin\" for each prayer to say the \"adhan\" as it is a recommended practice or \"Sunnah\" () of the Islamic prophet Muhammad. At mosques that do not have minarets, the \"adhan\" is called instead from inside the mosque or somewhere else on the ground. The \"Iq\u00e2mah\" (), which is similar to the \"adhan\" and proclaimed right before the commencement of prayers, is usually not proclaimed from the minaret even if a mosque has one.\nCourtyard.\nThe courtyard (\"Sahn\") is a common feature of many congressional mosques, it usually includes a fountain or a small water pool for ablution (\"Wudu\").\nDomes.\nDomes have been a prominent feature in mosque architecture for centuries, evolving both in form and function. Traditionally placed above the main prayer hall, they symbolize the connection between the earthly and divine, often representing the vaults of heaven and sky. Initially, domes were small structures above the mihrab, but over time, they expanded to cover the entire roof of the prayer hall. The shape of the dome evolved from simple hemispherical forms to more complex designs, with the Mughals in India popularizing the onion-shaped dome, which became a hallmark of South Asian and Arabic mosque architecture. The design and function of domes have been influenced by various cultures, including Persian, Byzantine, and Central Asian traditions, each contributing to the techniques and aesthetics used in their construction. Today, domes continue to serve both structural and spiritual purposes, with modern innovations further enhancing their functionality and sustainability.\nStructural and functional roles\nDomes not only serve as architectural focal points but also enhance mosque acoustics, amplifying the sound of the prayer and the sermon. Structurally, they allow vast interior spaces with minimal internal supports and they make the mosque appear bigger on the inside. Their placement above the prayer hall symbolizes the connection between the earthly and the divine, reinforcing the mosque's spiritual purpose.\nOrigin of mosque domes\nThe origin of domes in mosque architecture can be traced back to the early Islamic period, particularly under the Umayyad Caliphate (661\u2013750 AD). The Umayyads, played a key role in incorporating domes into mosque architecture, drawing heavily from pre-Islamic Byzantine and Sassanian traditions. One of the earliest and most significant examples is the Dome of the Rock in Jerusalem, constructed in 691 AD by the Umayyad Caliph Abd al-Malik. This structure was not a mosque but a shrine, yet it set a precedent for the use of domes in Islamic architecture, symbolizing the vault of heaven and the connection between the divine and earthly realms.\nInitially, domes in mosques were modest in size and positioned above the mihrab, emphasizing their symbolic function as markers of spiritual focus. As the Islamic empire expanded, architects incorporated techniques from different regions.\nPersian and Byzantine influences\nWhilst squinches and pendentives were not first used in mosques, they were later incorporated in dome design and were essential in transitioning from square rooms to circular domes. Squinches, which originated in Persian and Roman architecture, fill the corners of a square space to support a dome, while pendentives, a Byzantine innovation, allowed smooth transitions from a square base to a circular dome. These techniques are exemplified by the Dome of Soltaniyeh.\nDomes in South Asian mosque architecture\nDomes became a defining feature of South Asian mosque architecture during the Delhi Sultanate and reached their peak under the Mughal Empire. Influenced by Persian and Central Asian traditions, the Mughals introduced the iconic onion-shaped domes, seen in landmarks like the Jama Masjid in Delhi and the Badshahi Mosque in Lahore. These domes were not only visually striking but also represented remarkable engineering, using techniques such as iron dowels for strength and timber centering for precision. The Mughal architectural style still influences mosque design today.\nModern innovations\nOne prime example of modern innovation is the Masjid Raja Haji Fi Sabilillah in Malaysia, which features a Low-E (low emissivity) glass dome. The use of Low-E glass allows for significant energy efficiency by reducing heat gain while still allowing natural light to illuminate the interior space. This technique helps to maintain a comfortable temperature inside the mosque, minimizing reliance on air conditioning, and promoting sustainability. Another example is Zebun Nessa Mosque in Bangladesh with its iconic pink color, built with concrete in order to soften the harsh industrial surroundings.\nAblution facilities.\nAs ritual purification precedes all prayers, mosques often have ablution fountains or other facilities for washing in their entryways or courtyards. Worshippers at much smaller mosques often have to use restrooms to perform their ablutions. In traditional mosques, this function is often elaborated into a freestanding building in the center of a courtyard. This desire for cleanliness extends to the prayer halls where shoes are disallowed to be worn anywhere other than the cloakroom. Thus, foyers with shelves to put shoes and racks to hold coats are commonplace among mosques.\nContemporary features.\nModern mosques have a variety of amenities available to their congregants. As mosques are supposed to appeal to the community, they may also have additional facilities, from health clinics and clubs (gyms) to libraries to gymnasiums, to serve the community.\nSymbols.\nCertain symbols are represented in a mosque's architecture to allude to different aspects of the Islamic religion. One of these feature symbols is the spiral. The \"cosmic spiral\" found in designs and on minarets is a references to heaven as it has \"no beginning and no end\". Mosques also often have floral patterns or images of fruit and vegetables. These are allusions to the paradise after death.\nInter-religious conversion.\nAccording to early Muslim historians, towns that surrendered without resistance and made treaties with the Muslims were allowed to retain their churches and the towns captured by Muslims had many of their churches converted to mosques. One of the earliest examples of these kinds of conversions was in Damascus, Syria, where in 705 Umayyad caliph Al-Walid I bought the church of St. John from the Christians (which used to be a Roman temple and an Aramean temple prior to that), and had it demolished and rebuilt as a mosque in exchange for building a number of new churches for the Christians in Damascus. Overall, Abd al-Malik ibn Marwan (Al-Waleed's father) is said to have transformed 10 churches in Damascus into mosques.\nThe process of turning churches into mosques were especially intensive in the villages where most of the inhabitants converted to Islam. The Abbasid caliph al-Ma'mun turned many churches into mosques. Several of the early mosques in the Ottoman Empire were originally churches or cathedrals from the Byzantine Empire, with the Hagia Sophia (one of those converted cathedrals) informing the architecture of mosques from after the Ottoman conquest of Constantinople. In some instances mosques have been established on the places of Jewish or Christian sanctuaries associated with Biblical personalities who were also recognized by Islam.\nMosques have also been converted for use by other religions, notably in southern Spain, following the conquest of the Moors in 1492. The most prominent of them is the Great Mosque of Cordoba, itself constructed on the site of a church demolished during the period of Muslim rule. Outside of the Iberian Peninsula, such instances also occurred in southeastern Europe once regions were no longer under Muslim rule, like the Seven Saints Church, in Sofia, Bulgaria.\nRules and etiquette.\nPrayer leading.\nAppointment of a prayer leader is considered desirable, but not always obligatory. The permanent prayer leader (imam) must be a free honest individual and is authoritative in religious matters. In mosques constructed and maintained by the government, the prayer leader is appointed by the ruler; in private mosques, appointment is made by members of the congregation through majority voting. According to the Hanafi school of Islamic jurisprudence, the individual who built the mosque has a stronger claim to the title of imam, but this view is not shared by the other schools.\nLeadership at prayer falls into three categories, depending on the type of prayer: five daily prayers, Friday prayer, or optional prayers. According to the Hanafi and Maliki school of Islamic jurisprudence, appointment of a prayer leader for Friday service is mandatory because otherwise the prayer is invalid. The Shafi'i and Hanbali schools argue that the appointment is not necessary and the prayer is valid as long as it is performed in a congregation. A slave may lead a Friday prayer, but Muslim authorities disagree over whether the job can be done by a minor. An imam appointed to lead Friday prayers may also lead at the five daily prayers; Muslim scholars agree to the leader appointed for five daily services may lead the Friday service as well.\nAll Muslim authorities hold the consensus opinion that only men may lead prayer for men. Nevertheless, women prayer leaders are allowed to lead prayer in front of all-female congregations.\nCleanliness.\nAll mosques have rules regarding cleanliness, as it is an essential part of the worshippers' experience. Muslims before prayer are required to cleanse themselves in an ablution process known as \"wudu\". Shoes must not be worn inside the carpeted prayer hall. Some mosques will also extend that rule to include other parts of the facility even if those other locations are not devoted to prayer. Congregants and visitors to mosques are supposed to be clean themselves. It is also undesirable to come to the mosque after eating something that smells, such as garlic.\nDress.\nIslam requires that its adherents wear clothes that portray modesty. Men are supposed to come to the mosque wearing loose and clean clothes that do not reveal the shape of the body. Likewise, it is recommended that women at a mosque wear loose clothing that covers to the wrists and ankles, and cover their heads with a \"\u1e24ij\u0101b\" (), or other covering. Many Muslims, regardless of their ethnic background, wear Middle Eastern clothing associated with Arabic Islam to special occasions and prayers at mosques.\nConcentration.\nAs mosques are places of worship, those within the mosque are required to remain respectful to those in prayer. Loud talking within the mosque, as well as discussion of topics deemed disrespectful, is forbidden in areas where people are praying. In addition, it is disrespectful to walk in front of or otherwise disturb Muslims in prayer. The walls within the mosque have few items, except for possibly Islamic calligraphy, so Muslims in prayer are not distracted. Muslims are also discouraged from wearing clothing with distracting images and symbols so as not to divert the attention of those standing behind them during prayer. In many mosques, even the carpeted prayer area has no designs, its plainness helping worshippers to focus.\nGender separation.\nThere is nothing written in the Qur'an about the issue of space in mosques and gender separation. Traditional rules have segregated women and men. By traditional rules, women are most often told to occupy the rows behind the men. In part, this was a practical matter as the traditional posture for prayer\u00a0\u2013 kneeling on the floor, head to the ground\u00a0\u2013 made mixed-gender prayer uncomfortably revealing for many women and distracting for some men. Traditionalists try to argue that Muhammad preferred women to pray at home rather than at a mosque, and they cite a \"\u1e25ad\u012bth\" in which Muhammad supposedly said: \"The best mosques for women are the inner parts of their houses,\" although women were active participants in the mosque started by Muhammad. Muhammad told Muslims not to forbid women from entering mosques. They are allowed to go in. The second Sunni caliph 'Umar at one time prohibited women from attending mosques especially at night because he feared they might be sexually harassed or assaulted by men, so he required them to pray at home. Sometimes a special part of the mosque was railed off for women; for example, the governor of Mecca in 870 had ropes tied between the columns to make a separate place for women.\nMany mosques today will put the women behind a barrier or partition or in another room. Mosques in South and Southeast Asia put men and women in separate rooms, as the divisions were built into them centuries ago. In nearly two-thirds of American mosques, women pray behind partitions or in separate areas, not in the main prayer hall; some mosques do not admit women at all due to the lack of space and the fact that some prayers, such as the Friday Jumu\u02bbah, are mandatory for men but optional for women. Although there are sections exclusively for women and children, the Grand Mosque in Mecca is desegregated. In a number of mosques the women section is located above the main prayer hall, elevated in the background as stairs-separated gallery or plateau (surface-shortened to the back relative to the bottom main part). It usually has a perforated fence at the front, through which the imam or mullah and the other male worshippers in the main hall can be partially seen.\nNon-Muslim inclusion.\nUnder most interpretations of \"sharia\", non-Muslims are permitted to enter mosques provided that they respect the place and the people inside it. A dissenting opinion and minority view is presented by followers of the Maliki school of Islamic jurisprudence, who argue that non-Muslims may not be allowed into mosques under any circumstances.\nThe Quran addresses the subject of non-Muslims, and particularly polytheists, in mosques in two verses in its ninth chapter, Sura At-Tawba. The seventeenth verse of the chapter prohibits those who \"join gods with Allah\" (polytheists) from maintaining mosques:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;It is not for the polytheists to maintain the mosques of Allah while they openly profess disbelief. Their deeds are void, and they will be in the Fire forever.\nThe twenty-eighth verse of the same chapter is more specific as it only considers polytheists in the Masjid al-Haram in Mecca:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;O believers! Indeed, the polytheists are \"spiritually\" impure, so they should not approach the Sacred Mosque after this year. If you fear poverty, Allah will enrich you out of His bounty, if He wills. Surely, Allah is All-Knowing, All-Wise.\nAccording to Ahmad ibn Hanbal, these verses were followed to the letter at the times of Muhammad, when Jews and Christians, considered monotheists, were still allowed to \"Al-Masjid Al-Haram\". The Umayyad caliph Umar\u00a0II later forbade non-Muslims from entering mosques, and his ruling remains in practice in present-day Saudi Arabia. Today, the decision on whether non-Muslims should be allowed to enter mosques varies. With few exceptions, mosques in the Arabian Peninsula as well as Morocco do not allow entry to non-Muslims. For example, the HassanII Mosque in Casablanca is one of only two mosques in Morocco currently open to non-Muslims.\nThere are many other mosques in the West and Islamic world which non-Muslims are welcome to enter. Most mosques in the United States, for example, report receiving non-Muslim visitors every month. Many mosques throughout the United States welcome non-Muslims as a sign of openness to the rest of the community as well as to encourage conversions to Islam.\nIn modern-day Saudi Arabia, the Grand Mosque and all of Mecca are open only to Muslims. Likewise, Al-Masjid Al-Nabawi and the city of Medina that surrounds it are also off-limits to those who do not practice Islam. For mosques in other areas, it has most commonly been taken that non-Muslims may only enter mosques if granted permission to do so by Muslims, and if they have a legitimate reason. All entrants regardless of religious affiliation are expected to respect the rules and decorum for mosques.\nIn modern Turkey, non-Muslim tourists are allowed to enter any mosque, but there are some strict rules. Visiting a mosque is allowed only between prayers; visitors are required to wear long trousers and not to wear shoes, women must cover their heads; visitors are not allowed to interrupt praying Muslims, especially by taking photos of them; no loud talk is allowed; and no references to other religions are allowed (no crosses on necklaces, no cross gestures, etc.) Similar rules apply to mosques in Malaysia, where larger mosques that are also tourist attractions (such as the Masjid Negara) provide robes and headscarves for visitors who are deemed inappropriately attired.\nIn certain times and places, non-Muslims were expected to behave a certain way in the vicinity of a mosque: in some Moroccan cities, Jews were required to remove their shoes when passing by a mosque; in 18th-century Egypt, Jews and Christians had to dismount before several mosques in veneration of their sanctity.\nThe association of the mosque with education remained one of its main characteristics throughout history, and the school became an indispensable appendage to the mosque. From the earliest days of Islam, the mosque was the center of the Muslim community, a place for prayer, meditation, religious instruction, political discussion, and a school. Anywhere Islam took hold, mosques were established, and basic religious and educational instruction began.\nRole in contemporary society.\nPolitical mobilization.\nThe late 20th century saw an increase in the number of mosques used for political purposes. While some governments in the Muslim world have attempted to limit the content of Friday sermons to strictly religious topics, there are also independent preachers who deliver \"khutbas\" that address social and political issues, often in emotionally charged terms. Common themes include social inequalities, necessity of jihad in the face of injustice, and the universal struggle between good and evil. In Islamic countries like Bangladesh, Pakistan, Iran, and Saudi Arabia, political subjects are preached by imams at Friday congregations on a regular basis. Mosques often serve as meeting points for political opposition in times of crisis.\nCountries with a minority Muslim population are more likely than Muslim-majority countries of the Greater Middle East to use mosques as a way to promote civic participation. Studies of US Muslims have consistently shown a positive correlation between mosque attendance and political involvement. Some of the research connects civic engagement specifically with mosque attendance for social and religious activities other than prayer. American mosques host voter registration and civic participation drives that promote involving Muslims, who are often first- or second-generation immigrants, in the political process. As a result of these efforts as well as attempts at mosques to keep Muslims informed about the issues facing the Muslim community, regular mosque attendants are more likely to participate in protests, sign petitions, and otherwise be involved in politics. Research on Muslim civic engagement in other Western countries \"is less conclusive but seems to indicate similar trends\".\nFrequency of attendance.\nThe frequency by which Muslims attend mosque services vary greatly around the world. In some countries, weekly attendance at religious services is common among Muslims while in others, attendance is rare. A study of American Muslims did not find differences in mosque attendance by gender or age.\nPolitical controversy.\nIn the western world, and in the United States in particular, anti-Muslim sentiment and targeted domestic policy has created challenges for mosques and those looking to build them. There has been government and police surveillance of mosques in the US and local attempts to ban mosques and block constructions, despite data showing that in fact, most Americans oppose banning the building of mosques (79%) and the surveillance of U.S. mosques (63%) as shown in a 2018 study done by the Institute for Social Policy and Understanding.\nSince 2017, Chinese authorities have destroyed or damaged two-thirds of the mosques in China's Xinjiang province. Ningxia officials were notified on 3 August 2018 that the Weizhou Grand Mosque would be forcibly demolished because it had not received the proper permits before construction. Officials in the town said that the mosque had not been given proper building permits, because it is built in a Middle Eastern style and includes numerous domes and minarets. The residents of Weizhou alarmed each other through social media and finally stopped the mosque destruction by public demonstrations.\nRole in violent conflicts.\nAs they are considered important to the Muslim community, mosques, like other places of worship, can be at the heart of social conflicts. The Babri Mosque in India was the subject of such a conflict up until the early 1990s when it was demolished. Before a mutual solution could be devised, the mosque was destroyed on December 6, 1992, as the mosque was built by Babur allegedly on the site of a previous Hindu temple marking the birthplace of Rama. The controversy surrounded the mosque was directly linked to rioting in Bombay (present-day Mumbai) as well as bombings in 1993 that killed 257 people.\nBombings in February 2006 and June 2007 seriously damaged Iraq's al-Askari Mosque and exacerbated existing tensions. Other mosque bombings in Iraq, both before and after the February 2006 bombing, have been part of the conflict between the country's groups of Muslims. In June 2005, a suicide bombing killed at least 19 people at an Afghan Shia mosque near Jade Maivand. In April 2006, two explosions occurred at India's Jama Masjid. Following the al-Askari Mosque bombing in Iraq, imams and other Islamic leaders used mosques and Friday prayers as vehicles to call for calm and peace in the midst of widespread violence.\nA study 2005 indicated that while support for suicide bombings is not correlated with personal devotion to Islam among Palestinian Muslims, it is correlated with mosque attendance because \"participating in communal religious rituals of any kind likely encourages support for self-sacrificing behaviors that are done for the collective good.\"\nFollowing the September 11 attacks, several American mosques were targeted in attacks ranging from simple vandalism to arson. Furthermore, the Jewish Defense League was suspected of plotting to bomb the King Fahd Mosque in Culver City, California. Similar attacks occurred throughout the United Kingdom following the 7 July 2005 London bombings. Outside the Western world, in June 2001, the Hassan Bek Mosque was the target of vandalism and attacks by hundreds of Israelis after a suicide bomber killed 19 people in a night club in Tel Aviv. Although mosquegoing is highly encouraged for men, it is permitted to stay at home when one feels at risk from Islamophobic persecution.\nSaudi influence.\nAlthough the Saudi involvement in Sunni mosques around the world can be traced back to the 1960s, it was not until later in the 20th century that the government of Saudi Arabia became a large influence in foreign Sunni mosques. Beginning in the 1980s, the Saudi Arabian government began to finance the construction of Sunni mosques in countries around the world. An estimated US$45 billion has been spent by the Saudi Arabian government financing mosques and Sunni Islamic schools in foreign countries. \"Ain al-Yaqeen\", a Saudi newspaper, reported in 2002 that Saudi funds may have contributed to building as many as 1,500 mosques and 2,000 other Islamic centers.\nSaudi citizens have also contributed significantly to mosques in the Islamic world, especially in countries where they see Muslims as poor and oppressed. Following the fall of the Soviet Union, in 1992, mosques in war-torn Afghanistan saw many contributions from Saudi citizens. The King Fahd Mosque in Culver City, California and the Islamic Cultural Center of Italy in Rome represent two of Saudi Arabia's largest investments in foreign mosques as former Saudi king Fahd bin Abdul Aziz al-Saud contributed US$8 million and US$50million to the two mosques, respectively.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "19895", "revid": "43682752", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19895", "title": "Molecular cloud", "text": "Type of interstellar cloud\nA molecular cloud\u2014sometimes called a stellar nursery if star formation is occurring within\u2014is a type of interstellar cloud of which the density and size permit absorption nebulae, the formation of molecules (most commonly molecular hydrogen, H2), and the formation of H II regions. This is in contrast to other areas of the interstellar medium that contain predominantly ionized gas.\nMolecular hydrogen is difficult to detect by infrared and radio observations, so the molecule most often used to determine the presence of H2 is carbon monoxide (CO). The ratio between CO luminosity and H2 mass is thought to be constant, although there are reasons to doubt this assumption in observations of some other galaxies.\nWithin molecular clouds are regions with higher density, where much dust and many gas cores reside, called clumps. These clumps are the beginning of star formation if gravitational forces are sufficient to cause the dust and gas to collapse.\nResearch and discovery.\nThe history pertaining to the discovery of molecular clouds is closely related to the development of radio astronomy and astrochemistry. During World War II, at a small gathering of scientists, Henk van de Hulst first reported he had calculated the neutral hydrogen atom should transmit a detectable radio signal. This discovery was an important step towards the research that would eventually lead to the detection of molecular clouds.\nOnce the war ended, and aware of the pioneering radio astronomical observations performed by Jansky and Reber in the US, the Dutch astronomers repurposed the dish-shaped antennas running along the Dutch coastline that were once used by the Germans as a warning radar system and modified into radio telescopes, initiating the search for the hydrogen signature in the depths of space.\nThe neutral hydrogen atom consists of a proton with an electron in its orbit. Both the proton and the electron have a spin property. When the spin state flips from a parallel condition to antiparallel, which contains less energy, the atom gets rid of the excess energy by radiating a spectral line at a frequency of 1420.405 MHz.\nThis frequency is generally known as the 21 cm line, referring to its wavelength in the radio band. The 21\u00a0cm line is the signature of HI and makes the gas detectable to astronomers back on earth. The discovery of the 21\u00a0cm line was the first step towards the technology that would allow astronomers to detect compounds and molecules in interstellar space.\nIn 1951, two research groups nearly simultaneously discovered radio emission from interstellar neutral hydrogen. Ewen and Purcell reported the detection of the 21-cm line in March, 1951. Using the radio telescope at the Kootwijk Observatory, Muller and Oort reported the detection of the hydrogen emission line in May of that same year. \nOnce the 21-cm emission line was detected, radio astronomers began mapping the neutral hydrogen distribution of the Milky Way Galaxy. Van de Hulst, Muller, and Oort, aided by a team of astronomers from Australia, published the Leiden-Sydney map of neutral hydrogen in the galactic disk in 1958 on the Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society. This was the first neutral hydrogen map of the galactic disc and also the first map showing the spiral arm structure within it.\nFollowing the work on atomic hydrogen detection by van de Hulst, Oort and others, astronomers began to regularly use radio telescopes, this time looking for interstellar molecules. In 1963 Alan Barrett and Sander Weinred at MIT found the emission line of OH in the supernova remnant Cassiopeia A. This was the first radio detection of an interstellar molecule at radio wavelengths. More interstellar OH detections quickly followed and in 1965, Harold Weaver and his team of radio astronomers at Berkeley, identified OH emissions lines coming from the direction of the Orion Nebula and in the constellation of Cassiopeia.\nIn 1968, Cheung, Rank, Townes, Thornton and Welch detected NH\u2083 inversion line radiation in interstellar space. A year later, Lewis Snyder and his colleagues found interstellar formaldehyde. Also in the same year George Carruthers managed to identify molecular hydrogen. The numerous detections of molecules in interstellar space would help pave the way to the discovery of molecular clouds in 1970. \nHydrogen is the most abundant species of atom in molecular clouds, and under the right conditions it will form the H2 molecule. Despite its abundance, the detection of H2 proved difficult. Due to its symmetrical molecule, H2 molecules have a weak rotational and vibrational modes, making it virtually invisible to direct observation.\nThe solution to this problem came when Arno Penzias, Keith Jefferts, and Robert Wilson identified CO in the star-forming region in the Omega Nebula. Carbon monoxide is a lot easier to detect than H2 because of its rotational energy and asymmetrical structure. CO soon became the primary tracer of the clouds where star-formation occurs.\nIn 1970, Penzias and his team quickly detected CO in other locations close to the galactic center, including the giant molecular cloud identified as Sagittarius B2, 390 light years from the galactic center, making it the first detection of a molecular cloud in history. This team later would receive the Nobel prize of physics for their discovery of microwave emission from the Big Bang.\nDue to their pivotal role, research about these structures have only increased over time. A paper published in 2022 reports over 10,000 molecular clouds detected since the discovery of Sagittarius B2.\nOccurrence.\nWithin the Milky Way, molecular gas clouds account for less than one percent of the volume of the interstellar medium (ISM), yet it is also the densest part of it. The bulk of the molecular gas is contained in a ring between from the center of the Milky Way (the Sun is about 8.5 kiloparsecs from the center). Large scale CO maps of the galaxy show that the position of this gas correlates with the spiral arms of the galaxy. That molecular gas occurs predominantly in the spiral arms suggests that molecular clouds must form and dissociate on a timescale shorter than 10 million years\u2014the time it takes for material to pass through the arm region.\nPerpendicularly to the plane of the galaxy, the molecular gas inhabits the narrow midplane of the galactic disc with a characteristic scale height, \"Z\", of approximately 50 to 75 parsecs, much thinner than the warm atomic (\"Z \"from 130 to 400\u00a0parsecs) and warm ionized (\"Z \"around 1000\u00a0parsecs) gaseous components of the ISM. The exceptions to the ionized-gas distribution are H II regions, which are bubbles of hot ionized gas created in molecular clouds by the intense radiation given off by young massive stars; and as such they have approximately the same vertical distribution as the molecular gas.\nThis distribution of molecular gas is averaged out over large distances; however, the small scale distribution of the gas is highly irregular, with most of it concentrated in discrete clouds and cloud complexes.\nGeneral structure and chemistry of molecular clouds.\nMolecular clouds typically have interstellar medium densities of 10 to 30 cm\u22123, and constitute approximately 50% of the total interstellar gas in a galaxy. Most of the gas is found in a molecular state. The visual boundaries of a molecular cloud is not where the cloud effectively ends, but where molecular gas changes to atomic gas in a fast transition, forming \"envelopes\" of mass, giving the impression of an edge to the cloud structure. The structure itself is generally irregular and filamentary.\nCosmic dust and ultraviolet radiation emitted by stars are key factors that determine not only gas and column density, but also the molecular composition of a cloud. The dust provides shielding to the molecular gas inside, preventing dissociation by the ultraviolet radiation. The dissociation caused by UV photons is the main mechanism for transforming molecular material back to the atomic state inside the cloud. Molecular content in a region of a molecular cloud can change rapidly due to variation in the radiation field and dust movement and disturbance. \nMost of the gas constituting a molecular cloud is molecular hydrogen, with carbon monoxide being the second most common compound. Molecular clouds also usually contain other elements and compounds. Astronomers have observed the presence of long chain compounds such as methanol, ethanol and benzene rings and their several hydrides. Large molecules known as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons have also been detected.\nThe density across a molecular cloud is fragmented and its regions can be generally categorized in clumps and cores. Clumps form the larger substructure of the cloud, having the average size of 1 pc. Clumps are the precursors of star clusters, though not every clump will eventually form stars. Cores are much smaller (by a factor of 10) and have higher densities. Cores are gravitationally bound and go through a collapse during star formation.\nIn astronomical terms, molecular clouds are short-lived structures that are either destroyed or go through major structural and chemical changes approximately 10 million years into their existence. Their short life span can be inferred from the range in age of young stars associated with them, of 10 to 20 million years, matching molecular clouds\u2019 internal timescales.\nDirect observation of T Tauri stars inside dark clouds and OB stars in star-forming regions match this predicted age span. The fact OB stars older than 10 million years don\u2019t have a significant amount of cloud material about them, seems to suggest most of the cloud is dispersed after this time. The lack of large amounts of frozen molecules inside the clouds also suggest a short-lived structure. Some astronomers propose the molecules never froze in very large quantities due to turbulence and the fast transition between atomic and molecular gas.\nCloud formation and destruction.\nDue to their short lifespan, it follows that molecular clouds are constantly being assembled and destroyed. By calculating the rate at which stars are forming in our galaxy, astronomers are able to suggest the amount of interstellar gas being collected into star-forming molecular clouds in our galaxy. The rate of mass being assembled into stars is approximately 3 \"M\"\u2609 per year. Only 2% of the mass of a molecular cloud is assembled into stars, giving the number of 150 \"M\"\u2609 of gas being assembled in molecular clouds in the Milky Way per year.\nTwo possible mechanisms for molecular cloud formation have been suggested by astronomers. Cloud growth by collision and gravitational instability in the gas layer spread throughout the galaxy. Models for the collision theory have shown it cannot be the main mechanism for cloud formation due to the very long timescale it would take to form a molecular cloud, beyond the average lifespan of such structures.\nGravitational instability is likely to be the main mechanism. Those regions with more gas will exert a greater gravitational force on their neighboring regions, and draw surrounding material. This extra material increases the density, increasing their gravitational attraction. Mathematical models of gravitational instability in the gas layer predict a formation time within the timescale for the estimated cloud formation time.\nOnce a molecular cloud assembles enough mass, the densest regions of the structure will start to collapse under gravity, creating star-forming clusters. This process is highly destructive to the cloud itself. Once stars are formed, they begin to ionize portions of the cloud around it due to their heat. The ionized gas then evaporates and is dispersed in formations called \u2018champagne flows\u2019. This process begins when approximately 2% of the mass of the cloud has been converted into stars. Stellar winds are also known to contribute to cloud dispersal. The cycle of cloud formation and destruction is closed when the gas dispersed by stars cools again and is pulled into new clouds by gravitational instability.\nStar formation.\nStar formation involves the collapse of the densest part of the molecular cloud, fragmenting the collapsed region in smaller clumps. These clumps aggregate more interstellar material, increasing in density by gravitational contraction. This process continues until the temperature reaches a point where the fusion of hydrogen can occur. The burning of hydrogen then generates enough heat to push against gravity, creating hydrostatic equilibrium. At this stage, a protostar is formed and it will continue to aggregate gas and dust from the cloud around it.\nOne of the most studied star formation regions is the Taurus molecular cloud due to its close proximity to earth (140 pc or 430 ly away), making it an excellent object to collect data about the relationship between molecular clouds and star formation. Embedded in the Taurus molecular cloud there are T Tauri stars. These are a class of variable stars in an early stage of stellar development and still gathering gas and dust from the cloud around them. Observation of star forming regions have helped astronomers develop theories about stellar evolution. Many O and B type stars have been observed in or very near molecular clouds. Since these star types belong to population I (some are less than 1 million years old), they cannot have moved far from their birth place. Many of these young stars are found embedded in cloud clusters, suggesting stars are formed inside it.\nTypes of molecular cloud.\nGiant molecular clouds.\nA vast assemblage of molecular gas that has more than 10 thousand times the mass of the Sun is called a giant molecular cloud (GMC). GMCs are around 15 to 600 light-years (5 to 200 parsecs) in diameter, with typical masses of 10 thousand to 10 million solar masses. Whereas the average density in the solar vicinity is one particle per cubic centimetre, the average volume density of a GMC is about ten to a thousand times higher. Although the Sun is much denser than a GMC, the volume of a GMC is so great that it contains much more mass than the Sun. The substructure of a GMC is a complex pattern of filaments, sheets, bubbles, and irregular clumps.\nFilaments are truly ubiquitous in the molecular cloud. Dense molecular filaments will fragment into gravitationally bound cores, most of which will evolve into stars. Continuous accretion of gas, geometrical bending, and magnetic fields may control the detailed fragmentation manner of the filaments. In supercritical filaments, observations have revealed quasi-periodic chains of dense cores with spacing of 0.15 parsec comparable to the filament inner width. A substantial fraction of filaments contained prestellar and protostellar cores, supporting the important role of filaments in gravitationally bound core formation. Recent studies have suggested that filamentary structures in molecular clouds play a crucial role in the initial conditions of star formation and the origin of the stellar IMF.\nThe densest parts of the filaments and clumps are called molecular cores, while the densest molecular cores are called dense molecular cores and have densities in excess of 104 to 106 particles per cubic centimeter. Typical molecular cores are traced with CO and dense molecular cores are traced with ammonia. The concentration of dust within molecular cores is normally sufficient to block light from background stars so that they appear in silhouette as dark nebulae.\nGMCs are so large that local ones can cover a significant fraction of a constellation; thus they are often referred to by the name of that constellation, e.g. the Orion molecular cloud (OMC) or the Taurus molecular cloud (TMC). These local GMCs are arrayed in a ring in the neighborhood of the Sun coinciding with the Gould Belt. The most massive collection of molecular clouds in the galaxy forms an asymmetrical ring about the galactic center at a radius of 120 parsecs; the largest component of this ring is the Sagittarius B2 complex. The Sagittarius region is chemically rich and is often used as an exemplar by astronomers searching for new molecules in interstellar space.\nSmall molecular clouds.\nIsolated gravitationally-bound small molecular clouds with masses less than a few hundred times that of the Sun are called Bok globules. The densest parts of small molecular clouds are equivalent to the molecular cores found in GMCs and are often included in the same studies.\nHigh-latitude diffuse molecular clouds.\nIn 1984 IRAS identified a new type of diffuse molecular cloud. These were diffuse filamentary clouds that are visible at high galactic latitudes. These clouds have a typical density of 30 particles per cubic centimetre.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "19897", "revid": "40754995", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19897", "title": "Minoru Yamasaki", "text": "American architect (1912\u20131986)\n was an American architect, best known for designing the original World Trade Center in New York City and several other large-scale projects. He and fellow architect Edward Durell Stone are generally considered to be the two master practitioners of \"New Formalism\".\nDuring his three-decade career, he and his firm designed over 250 buildings. His firm, Yamasaki &amp; Associates, closed on December 31, 2009.\nEarly life and education.\nYamasaki was born on December 1, 1912, in Seattle, Washington, the son of John Tsunejiro Yamasaki and Hana Yamasaki, \"issei\" Japanese immigrants. The family later moved to Auburn, Washington, and he graduated from Garfield Senior High School in Seattle. He enrolled in the University of Washington program in architecture in 1929, and graduated with a Bachelor of Architecture (BArch) in 1934. During his college years, he was strongly encouraged by faculty member Lionel Pries. He earned money to pay for his tuition by working at a salmon cannery in Alaska, working five summers and earning $50 a month, plus 25 cents an hour in overtime pay.\nIn part to escape anti-Japanese prejudice, he moved to Manhattan in 1934, with $40 and no job prospects. He wrapped dishes for an importing company until he found work as a draftsman and engineer. He graduated from New York University with master's degree in architecture, and subsequently joining the architecture firm Shreve, Lamb &amp; Harmon, designers of the Empire State Building. The firm helped Yamasaki avoid internment as a Japanese-American during World War II, and he himself sheltered his parents in New York City. Yamasaki was politically active during his early years, particularly in efforts to relocate Japanese Americans affected by the internment program in the United States during World War II.\nAfter leaving Shreve, Lamb &amp; Harmon, Yamasaki worked briefly for Harrison &amp; Abramovitz and Raymond Loewy. During his time with Harrison &amp; Abramovitz, Yamasaki, a gifted watercolorist, also taught drawing at Columbia University.\nIn 1945, Yamasaki moved to Detroit, where he secured a position with Smith, Hinchman &amp; Grylls (SHG) as the chief designer. At the time, SHG was the oldest as well as one of the largest and most prestigious architectural firms in Detroit and the United States, with recently completed projects including Detroit landmarks such as the Penobscot and Guardian Buildings. Yamasaki left the firm in 1949, and started his own partnership. He worked from Birmingham and Troy, Michigan. One of the first projects he designed at his own firm was Ruhl's Bakery at 7 Mile Road and Monica Street in Detroit.\nCareer.\nPruitt\u2013Igoe and other early commissions.\nYamasaki's first major project was the Pruitt\u2013Igoe public housing project in St. Louis in 1955. Despite his love of traditional Japanese design and ornamentation, the buildings of Pruitt\u2013Igoe were stark, modernist concrete structures, severely constricted by a tight budget. The housing project soon experienced so many problems that it was demolished starting in 1972, less than twenty years after its completion. Its destruction would be considered by architectural historian Charles Jencks to be the symbolic end of modernist architecture.\nIn the 1950s, Yamasaki was commissioned by the Reynolds Company to design an aluminum-wrapped building in Southfield, Michigan, which would \"symbolize the auto industry's past and future progress with aluminum.\" The three-story glass building wrapped in aluminum, known as the Reynolds Metals Company's Great Lakes Sales Headquarters Building, was also supposed to reinforce the company's main product and showcase its admirable characteristics of strength and beauty.\nIn 1955, he designed the \"sleek\" terminal at Lambert\u2013St. Louis International Airport, which led to his 1959 commission to design the Dhahran International Airport in Saudi Arabia. The Dhahran International Airport terminal building was especially well received in Saudi Arabia and was featured on the one riyal bank note.\nYamasaki's first widely-acclaimed design was the Pacific Science Center, with its iconic lacy and airy decorative arches. It was constructed by the City of Seattle for the 1962 Seattle World's Fair. The building raised his public profile so much that he was featured on the cover of \"Time\" magazine.\nYamasaki was a member of the Pennsylvania Avenue Commission, created in 1961 to restore the grand avenue in Washington, D.C., but he resigned after disagreements and disillusionment with the design by committee approach.\nThe campus for the University of Regina was designed in tandem with Yamasaki's plan for Wascana Centre, a park built around Wascana Lake in Regina, Saskatchewan. The original campus design was approved in 1962. Yamasaki was awarded contracts to design the first three buildings: the Classroom Building, the Laboratory Building, and the Dr. John Archer Library, which were built between 1963 and 1967.\nYamasaki designed two notable synagogues, North Shore Congregation Israel in Glencoe, Illinois (1964), and Temple Beth El, in Bloomfield Hills, Michigan (1973).\nHe designed a number of buildings on college campuses, including designs for Carleton College in Northfield, Minnesota, and a building in Waikiki, in Honolulu, Hawaii, between 1958 and 1968 as well as being commissioned to design buildings on the campus of Wayne State University in the 1950s and 1960s, including the McGregor Memorial Conference Center, the College of Education building and the Prentis Building and DeRoy Auditorium Complex. The buildings at Wayne State University incorporated many architectural motifs that would become characteristic elements in Yamasaki's designs.\nWith regards to the McGregor Memorial Conference Center, this included placing the building on an elevated base or pedestal to emphasize its presence, repeated geometric patterns on the exterior facade of the building (many times these exterior design features were functional as well, providing structural support to the building). He also used exotic materials such as white marble tiles and columns, incorporated a skylight traversing the length of the building and made extensive use of the secondary space outside the building including constructing a plaza with reflecting pools, seating areas, greenery and sculptures. The College of Education building featured repeating gothic arches throughout the exterior of the building which were both ornamental but also provided structural support for the building.\nWorld Trade Center.\nIn 1962 Yamasaki and his firm were commissioned to design his most well-known project: the World Trade Center, with Emery Roth &amp; Sons serving as associate architects. The World Trade Center towers featured many innovative design elements to address many unique challenges at the site.\nOne particular design challenge related to the efficacy of the elevator system, which became unique in the world when it was first opened for service. Yamasaki employed the fastest elevators at the time, running at per minute. Instead of placing a traditional large cluster of full-height elevator shafts in the core of each tower, Yamasaki created the Twin Towers' \"Skylobby\" system. The Skylobby design created three separate, connected elevator systems which would serve different zones of the building, depending on which floor was chosen, saving approximately 70% of the space which would have been required for traditional shafts. The space saved was then used for additional office space. Internally, each office floor was a vast open space unimpeded by support columns, ready to be subdivided as the tenants might choose.\nOther design challenges included anchoring the massively tall towers to the bedrock located about below lower Manhattan's soft soil. Digging a large trench to the bedrock risked flooding from nearby New York Harbor. The solution employed by Yamasaki and his team of engineers was to use a slurry wall; digging very narrow trenches about wide and then filling these with a slurry (a mixture of clay and water) that was dense enough to keep the surrounding water out. Pipes were then lowered into the slurry trench and concrete was pumped in. The concrete, being more dense than the slurry, sank to the bottom of the trenches all the way down to the bedrock displacing the slurry to the surface, where it was drained away. This process was repeated around the entire perimeter of the site and reinforced with steel cables to create a watertight concrete bathtub surrounding the excavation site. This slurry wall system had only been employed a few times prior in the United States and never on such a large project.\nA further design challenge was developing a wind-bracing system to keep the ultra tall but relatively lightweight steel and glass structures from swaying at their upper levels. Other contemporary modern skyscrapers had used centrally located cross-bracing systems located in the core of the interiors at the upper levels, but Yamasaki and structural engineer Fazlur Rahman Khan employed an exterior truss system; a network of vertical and horizontal structural elements on the exterior of the towers giving them structural support. This external structural support system also decreased the need for large internal pillars. The external truss support system and the unique elevator configuration created more rentable space in the World Trade Centers to satisfy the owner's (The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey) massive demand for of office space.\nThe first of the towers was finished in 1970. Many of his buildings feature superficial details inspired by the pointed arches of Gothic architecture, and make use of extremely narrow vertical windows. This narrow-windowed style arose from his own personal fear of heights. After partnering with Emery Roth and Sons on the design of the World Trade Center, the collaboration continued with other projects including new buildings at Bolling Air Force Base in Washington, D.C.\nYamasaki designed the BOK Tower in Tulsa, Oklahoma with a similar design to the World Trade Center. It was completed in 1976 and was the tallest building in Oklahoma at the time.\nLater years.\nAfter criticism of his dramatically cantilevered Rainier Tower (1977) in Seattle, Yamasaki became less adventurous in his designs during the last decade of his career.\nIn 1978, Yamasaki designed the Federal Reserve Bank tower in Richmond, Virginia. The work was designed with a similar external appearance as the World Trade Center complex, with its narrow fenestration, and stands at .\nLegacy.\nDespite the many buildings he completed, Yamasaki's reputation faded along with the overall decline of modernism towards the end of the 20th century. Two of his major projects, the Pruitt-Igoe public housing complex, and the original World Trade Center, shared the dubious symbolic distinction of being destroyed while recorded by live TV broadcasts. The World Trade Center towers were not well received by some commentators at the time of their debut, with noted \"New York Times\" architectural critic Ada Louise Huxtable criticizing the towers as being \"pure technology, the lobbies are pure schmaltz and the impact on New York of 110-story buildings...is pure speculation\" and their gothic exterior branches at the lower levels as \"General Motors gothic\". In many ways, these best-known works ran counter to Yamasaki's own design principles, and he later regretted his reluctant acceptance of architectural compromises dictated by the clients of these projects. Several others of his buildings have also been demolished.\nYamasaki collaborated closely with structural engineers, including John Skilling, Leslie Robertson, Fazlur Rahman Khan, and Jack V. Christiansen, to produce some of his innovative architectural designs. He strove to achieve \"serenity, surprise, and delight\" in his humanistic modernist buildings and their surrounds.\nDecades after his death, Yamasaki's buildings and legacy would be re-assessed more sympathetically by some architectural critics. Several of his buildings have now been restored in accordance with his original designs, and his McGregor Memorial Conference Center was awarded National Historic Landmark status in 2015.\nPersonal life.\nYamasaki was first married in 1941 to Teruko \"Teri\" Hirashiki. They had three children together: Carol, Taro, and Kim. They divorced in 1961 and Yamasaki married Peggy Watty. He and Watty divorced two years later, and Yamasaki married a third time briefly before remarrying Teruko in 1969. In a 1969 article in \"The Detroit News\" about the remarriage, Yamasaki said \"I'm just going to be nicer to her\".\nYamasaki suffered from health problems for at least three decades, and ulcers caused surgical removal of much of his stomach in 1953. Over time, he endured several more operations on his stomach. His health was not improved by increasingly heavy drinking towards the end of his life. Yamasaki died of stomach cancer on February 6, 1986, at the age of 73.\nYamasaki was affectionately known as \"Yama\" among his friends and associates.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Together with the Azores, it is one of the two autonomous regions of Portugal and a special territory of the European Union. It is the southernmost point and region of Portugal.\nMadeira is an archipelago situated in the North Atlantic Ocean, in the region of Macaronesia, just under north of the Canary Islands, Spain, west of Morocco and southwest of mainland Portugal. Madeira sits on the African Tectonic Plate, but is culturally, politically and ethnically associated with Europe, with its population predominantly descended from Portuguese settlers. Its population was 251,060 in 2021. The capital of Madeira is Funchal, on the main island's south coast.\nThe archipelago includes the islands of Madeira, Porto Santo, and the Desertas, administered together with the separate archipelago of the Savage Islands. Roughly half of the population lives in Funchal. The region has political and administrative autonomy through the Administrative Political Statute of the Autonomous Region of Madeira provided for in the Portuguese Constitution. The region is an integral part of the European Union as an outermost region. Madeira generally has a mild/moderate subtropical climate with mediterranean summer droughts and winter rain. Many microclimates are found at different elevations.\nMadeira, uninhabited at the time, was claimed by Portuguese sailors in the service of Prince Henry the Navigator in 1419 and settled after 1420. The archipelago is the first territorial discovery of the exploratory period of the Age of Discovery.\nMadeira is a year-round resort, particularly for Portuguese, British (148,000 visits in 2021), and German tourists (113,000). It is by far the most populous and densely populated Portuguese island. The region is noted for its Madeira wine, flora, and fauna, with its pre-historic laurel forest, classified as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The destination is certified by EarthCheck. The main harbour in Funchal has long been the leading Portuguese port in cruise ship dockings, an important stopover for Atlantic passenger cruises between Europe, the Caribbean and North Africa. In addition, the International Business Centre of Madeira, also known as the Madeira Free Trade Zone, was established in the 1980s. It includes (mainly tax-related) incentives.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:TOC limit/styles.css\" /&gt;\nHistory.\nAncient.\nPlutarch in his \"Parallel Lives\" (\"Sertorius\", 75 AD) referring to the military commander Quintus Sertorius (d. 72 BC), relates that after his return to C\u00e1diz, he met sailors who spoke of idyllic Atlantic islands: \"The islands are said to be two in number separated by a very narrow strait and lie from Africa. They are called the Isles of the Blessed.\"\nArchaeological evidence suggests that the islands may have been visited by the Vikings sometime between 900 and 1030.\nAccounts by Muhammad al-Idrisi state that the Mugharrarin (\"the adventurers\" \u2013 seafarers from Lisbon) came across an island where they found \"a huge quantity of sheep, the meat of which was bitter and inedible\" before going to the more inhabited Canary Islands, in Spain. This island, possibly Madeira or Hierro, must have been inhabited or previously visited by people for livestock to be present.\nLegend.\nDuring the reign of King Edward III of England, lovers Robert Machim and Anna d'Arfet were said to have fled from England to France in 1346. Driven off course by a violent storm, their ship ran aground along the coast of an island that may have been Madeira. Later, this legend was the basis of the naming of the city of Machico on the island, in memory of the young lovers.\nEuropean exploration.\nMadeira appears in several medieval manuscripts, including the \"Book of Knowledge of All Kingdoms\" from the early 14th century, the Medici-Laurentian Atlas from 1351, the \"Soleri Portolani\" from 1380 and 1385 and Corbitis Atlas from the late 14th century. These texts refer to Madeira as \"Lecmane\", \"Lolegname,\" \"Legnami\" (the isle of wood), \"Puerto\" or Porto Santo, \"deserte\" or deserta, and \"desierta\". It is widely accepted that knowledge of these Atlantic islands existed before their better-documented discovery and successful settlement by the Kingdom of Portugal.\nIn 1418, two captains, Jo\u00e3o Gon\u00e7alves Zarco and Trist\u00e3o Vaz Teixeira, while exploring the African coast in the service of Prince Henry the Navigator, were driven off course by a storm to an island which they named (English: \"holy harbour\") in gratitude for divine deliverance from a shipwreck.\nThe following year, Zarco and Vaz organised an expedition with Bartolomeu Perestrello. The trio travelled to the island of Porto Santo, claimed it on behalf of the Portuguese Crown, and established a settlement. The new settlers observed \"a heavy black cloud suspended to the southwest\" and upon investigation discovered the larger island they called ().\nSettlement.\nThe first Portuguese settlers began colonizing the islands around 1420 or 1425.\nThe three governors, knights of the Order of Christ and navigators: Jo\u00e3o Gon\u00e7alves Zarco, Trist\u00e3o Vaz Teixeira and Bartolomeu Perestrelo, along with their respective families, became the first settlers of the archipelago, divided by three captaincies (respectively Funchal, Machico and Porto Santo). This colonization process began in 1425, by order of King Jo\u00e3o I, with people of modest means, some former prisoners of the Kingdom and a group of people from the lower nobility, including fishermen and peasant farmers who willingly left Portugal for a new life on the islands, a better one, they hoped, than was possible in a Portugal which had been ravaged by the Black Death, and where the nobility strictly controlled the best farmlands.\nInitially, the settlers produced wheat for their own sustenance. Still, they later began to export wheat to mainland Portugal. In earlier times, fish and vegetables were the settlers' main means of subsistence.\nGrain production began to fall, and the ensuing crisis forced Henry the Navigator to order other commercial crops to be planted so that the islands could be profitable. These specialised plants, and their associated industrial technology, created one of the major revolutions on the islands and fuelled Portuguese industry. Following the introduction of the first water-driven sugar mill on Madeira, sugar production increased to over 6,000 \"arrobas\" (an \"arroba\" was equal to ) by 1455, using advisers from Sicily and financed by Genoese capital (Genoa acted as an integral part of the island economy until the 17th century). The accessibility of Madeira attracted Genoese and Flemish traders, who were keen to bypass Venetian monopolies.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSugarcane production was the primary engine of the island's economy, which quickly afforded the Funchal metropolis economic prosperity. The production of sugar cane attracted adventurers and merchants from all parts of Europe, especially Italians, Basques, Catalans, and Flemish. This meant that, in the second half of the fifteenth century, the city of Funchal became a mandatory port of call for European trade routes.\nSlaves were used during the island's period of sugar trade to cultivate sugar cane alongside paid workers. However, slave owners were only a small minority of the Madeiran population, and those who did own slaves owned only a few. Slaves consisted of Guanches from the nearby Canary Islands. Barbary corsairs from North Africa, who enslaved Europeans from ships and coastal communities throughout the Mediterranean region, captured 1,200 people in Porto Santo in 1617.\nUntil the first half of the sixteenth century, Madeira was one of the major sugar markets of the Atlantic. Apparently, it is in Madeira that, in the context of sugar production, slave labour was applied for the first time. The colonial system of sugar production was put into practice on the island of Madeira, on a much smaller scale, and later transferred, on a large scale, to other overseas production areas.\nSugar mills were gradually abandoned, with few remaining, which gave way to other markets in Madeira.\nIn the 17th century, as Portuguese sugar production shifted to Brazil, S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe, and elsewhere, Madeira's most important commodity became its wine. Sugar plantations were replaced by vineyards, originating in the so-called 'Wine Culture', which acquired international fame and provided the rise of a new social class, the Bourgeoisie.\nWith the increase of commercial treaties with England, important English merchants settled on the Island and, ultimately, controlled the increasingly important island wine trade. The English traders settled in Funchal in the seventeenth century, consolidating the markets from North America, the West Indies and England itself. The Madeira wine became very popular in the markets, and it is also said to have been used in a toast during the Declaration of Independence by the Founding Fathers of the United States.\nDue to high demand during the season, there was a need to prepare guides for visitors. The first tourist guide to Madeira appeared in 1850 and focused on the island's history, geology, flora, fauna and customs. Regarding hotel infrastructures, the British and the Germans were the first to launch the Madeiran hotel chain. The historic Belmond Reid's Palace opened in 1891 as the \"Reid's New Hotel\" and is still open to this day.\nThe British first amicably occupied the island in 1801, whereafter Colonel William Henry Clinton became governor. A detachment of the 85th Regiment of Foot under Lieutenant-colonel James Willoughby Gordon garrisoned the island.\nAfter the Peace of Amiens, British troops withdrew in 1802, only to reoccupy Madeira in 1807 until the end of the Peninsular War in 1814. In 1846, James Julius Wood wrote a series of seven sketches of the island. In 1856, British troops recovering from cholera, and widows and orphans of soldiers fallen in the Crimean War, were stationed in Funchal, Madeira.\nWorld War I.\nDuring the Great War on 3 December 1916, a German U-boat, , captained by Max Valentiner, entered Funchal harbour on Madeira. \"U-38\" torpedoed and sank three ships, bringing the war to Portugal by extension. The ships sunk were:\nAfter attacking the ships, \"U-38\" bombarded Funchal for two hours from a range of about . Batteries on Madeira returned fire and eventually forced \"U-38\" to withdraw.\nOn 12 December 1917, two German U-boats, \"SM U-156\" and \"SM U-157\" (captained by Max Valentiner), again bombarded Funchal. This time the attack lasted around 30 minutes. The U-boats fired 40 shells. There were three fatalities and 17 wounded; several houses and the Santa Clara church were hit.\nThe last Austrian Emperor, Charles I, was exiled to Madeira after the war. Determined to prevent an attempt to restore Charles to the throne, the Council of Allied Powers agreed he could go into exile on Madeira because it was isolated in the Atlantic and easily guarded. He died there on 1 April 1922 and his coffin lies in a chapel of the Church of Our Lady of Monte.\nGeography.\nThe Madeira archipelago is located from the African coast, from the closest point in the European coast (the Portuguese town of Sagres, in Algarve) and from the capital of Portugal, Lisbon (approximately a one-and-a-half-hour flight). Madeira inhabits the extreme south of the Madeira-Tore Rise, a bathymetric structure oriented along a north-northeast to south-southwest axis that extends for . This structure consists of long geomorphological relief that extends from the abyssal plain to ; its highest submerged point reaches a depth of about (around latitude 36\u00b0N). The origins of the Madeira-Tore Rise are not clearly established, but may have resulted from a buckling of the lithosphere.\nPeaks.\nThe ten tallest peaks in Madeira exemplify the island's diverse topography. Pico Ruivo is the highest at . Madeira's mountaintops offer vistas of rugged terrain and the Atlantic Ocean and attract hikers and nature enthusiasts.\nMadeira Island.\nMadeira Island is at the top of a massive shield volcano that rises about from the floor of the Atlantic Ocean, on the Tore underwater mountain range. The volcano formed atop an east\u2013west rift in the oceanic crust along the African Plate, beginning during the Miocene epoch (5\u00a0million years ago), continuing into the Pleistocene (700,000\u00a0years ago). This was followed by extensive erosion, producing two large amphitheatres opening southward in the central part of the island. Volcanic activity later resumed, producing scoria cones and lava flows atop the eroded shield. The most recent volcanic eruptions were on the west-central part of the island 6,500\u00a0years ago, creating more cinder cones and lava flows.\nIt is the largest island of the group with an area of , a length of (from Ponte de S\u00e3o Louren\u00e7o to Ponta do Pargo). It is approximately at its widest point (from Ponta da Cruz to Ponta de S\u00e3o Jorge), with a coastline of . It has a mountain ridge that extends along the centre of the island, reaching at its highest point (Pico Ruivo), staying below 200 metres along its eastern extent. The primitive volcanic foci responsible for the central mountainous area consisted of the peaks: Ruivo (1,862 m), Torres (1,851 m), Arieiro (1,818 m), Cidr\u00e3o (1,802 m), Cedro (1,759 m), Casado (1,725 m), Grande (1,657 m), Ferreiro (1,582 m). At the end of this eruptive phase, reefs encircled the island, and its marine vestiges are evident in a calcareous layer at Lameiros, in S\u00e3o Vicente. Sea cliffs, such as Cabo Gir\u00e3o, valleys and ravines extend from this central spine, leaving the interior generally inaccessible. Daily life is concentrated in the many villages at the mouths of the ravines, through which the heavy autumn and winter rains travel to the sea.\nClimate.\nMadeira has many different bioclimates. Based on differences in sun exposure, humidity, and annual mean temperature, clear variations distinguish north- and south-facing regions, as well as some islands. The islands are strongly influenced by the Gulf Stream and Canary Current, giving it mild to warm year-round temperatures. According to the Instituto de Meteorologia (IPMA), the average annual temperature at Funchal weather station is for the 1981\u20132010 period. Relief is a determinant factor on precipitation levels; areas such as the Madeira Natural Park can get as much as of precipitation a year. Madeira hosts lush laurel forests, while Porto Santo, a much flatter island, has a semiarid climate (\"BSh\"). In most winters, snowfall occurs in the mountains.\nBiodiversity.\nEndemic plant and animal species.\nIn the south, little is left of the indigenous subtropical rainforest that once covered the island (the original settlers set fires to clear the land for farming) and named it (\"madeira\" means \"wood\" in Portuguese). However, in the north, the valleys harbor native trees. These \"laurisilva\" forests, notably those on the northern slopes, are designated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Madeira's paleobotanical record reveals that \"laurissilva\" forest has existed for at least 1.8\u00a0million years. Critically endangered species such as the vine \"Jasminum azoricum\" and the rowan \"Sorbus maderensis\" are endemic. The Madeiran large white butterfly was an endemic subspecies of the large white that inhabited the \"laurissilva\" forests but has not been seen since 1977.\nMadeiran wolf spider.\n\"Hogna ingens\", the Deserta Grande wolf spider, is endemic to the Madeira archipelago, specifically Deserta Grande Island. It is critically endangered. It is considered the largest member of its family. Restoration efforts are underway.\nBirds.\nThree species of birds are endemic to Madeira: the Trocaz pigeon, the Madeira chaffinch and the Madeira firecrest. In addition extinct species include the Madeiran scops owl, two rail species, \"Rallus adolfocaesaris\" and \"R. lowei\", and two quail species, \"Coturnix lignorum\" and \"C. alabrevis\", and the Madeiran wood pigeon, a subspecies of the common wood pigeon and which was last seen in the early 20th century.\nA great auk bone is known from the Selvagens, suggesting this seabird visited at least sporadically.\nMice.\nMadeira is home to six distinct chromosomal varieties of house mice, believed to be descendants of common European house mice brought to the island by Vikings in the 9th century (or conceivably by 15th century Portuguese settlers), but diversified to the point where at least some likely cannot interbreed with their continental relatives or with one another. They have essentially the same genes, but rearranged to give different chromosome numbers: the ancestral species has 40 chromosomes, whereas the Madeira populations have from 22 to 30. The deep valleys of Madeira are separated by high ground, and the different lineages of mice do not encounter each other.\nPolitics.\nPolitical autonomy.\nDue to its distinct geography, economy, social and cultural situation, and the historical autonomous aspirations of its population, the Autonomous Region of Madeira was established in 1976. Although it is a politico-administrative autonomous region, the Portuguese constitution specifies both a regional and national connection, obliging their administrations to maintain democratic principles and promote regional interests, while reinforcing national unity.\nAs defined by the Portuguese constitution and other laws, Madeira has its own political and administrative statute and government. The branches of Government are the Regional Government and the Legislative Assembly, the latter elected by universal suffrage, using the D'Hondt method of proportional representation.\nThe Representative of the Republic appoints the president of the Regional Government according to the results of the election to the legislative assemblies.\nThe sovereignty of the Portuguese Republic is represented in Madeira by the Representative of the Republic, appointed by the President of the Republic on the advice of the Government of the Republic. The tasks of the Representative of the Republic are to sign and order the publication of regional legislative decrees and regional regulatory decrees or to exercise the right of veto over regional laws, should these laws be unconstitutional. Before the sixth amendment to the Portuguese Constitution passed in 2006, this responsibility was held by a more powerful Minister of the Republic, who was proposed by the Government and appointed by the President.\nStatus within the European Union.\nMadeira is an Outermost Region (OMR) of the European Union, meaning that due to its geographical situation, it is entitled to derogation from some EU policies.\nAccording to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, both primary and secondary European Union law applies to Madeira, with possible derogations to take account of its \"structural social and economic situation\u00a0(...) which is compounded by their remoteness, insularity, small size, difficult topography and climate, economic dependence on a few products, the permanence and combination of which severely restrain their development\". An example of such derogation is seen in the approval of the International Business Centre of Madeira and other state aid policies to help the rum industry.\nIt forms part of the European Union customs area, the Schengen Area and the European Union Value Added Tax Area.\nForeign relations and defence.\nForeign affairs and defence are the responsibility of the national government. The Madeira Military Zone is the Portuguese Army's command for ground forces stationed in the islands, centred on the 3rd Garrison Regiment based at Funchal. The Navy tasks the patrol vessels \"Tejo\" and \"Mondego\" specifically to Madeira, as well as other vessels as required, to patrol Portugal's large economic zone. To support search and rescue, the Portuguese Air Force maintains a staging base on Porto Santo Island incorporating detachments of C-295 aircraft and Merlin helicopters.\nAdministrative divisions.\nAdministratively, Madeira is divided into fifty four parishes and eleven municipalities:\nSister Jurisdictions.\nMadeira Island has the following sister jurisdictions:\n Aosta Valley, Italy (1987)\n Jersey (1998)\n Eastern Cape, South Africa\n Jeju Province, South Korea (2007)\n Gibraltar (2009)\nDemographics.\nIn 2023, 94.5% of the population of Madeira were born in Portugal; the total Madeiran population was 256,622.\nDiaspora.\nMadeirans migrated to the United States, Venezuela, Brazil, Guyana, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, South Africa and Trinidad and Tobago. Madeiran immigrants in North America mostly clustered in New England and mid-Atlantic states, Toronto, Northern California, and Hawaii. The city of New Bedford is especially rich in Madeirans, and it hosts the Museum of Madeira Heritage. The annual Madeiran and Luso-American celebration, the Feast of the Blessed Sacrament, the world's largest celebration of Madeiran heritage, regularly draws crowds of tens of thousands to the city's Madeira Field.\nIn the 1846 famine, over 6,000 inhabitants migrated to British Guiana. In 1891, they numbered 4.3% of the population. In 1902, 5,000 Portuguese people, mostly Madeirans, lived in Honolulu, Hawaii. By 1910, this grew to 21,000.\nIn 1849, Protestant religious exiles from Madeira emigrated to the United States, by way of Trinidad and elsewhere in the West Indies. Most of them settled in Illinois with financial and physical aid of the American Protestant Society, headquartered in New York City. In the late 1830s, physician and Presbyterian minister Reverend Robert Reid Kalley, from Scotland, made a stop at Funchal, Madeira, on his way to a mission in China, with his wife, so that she could recover from an illness. Kalley and his wife stayed on Madeira, where he began preaching the Protestant gospel and converting islanders from Catholicism. Eventually, he was arrested and imprisoned for his religious conversion activities. Another Scottish missionary, William Hepburn Hewitson, took on Protestant ministerial activities in Madeira. By 1846, about 1,000 Protestant Madeirenses, who were discriminated against and the subjects of mob violence because of their religious conversions, chose to immigrate to Trinidad and elsewhere in the West Indies in answer to a call for sugar plantation workers. The exiles did not fare well there. The tropical climate was unfamiliar, and they found themselves in serious economic difficulties. By 1848, the American Protestant Society raised money and sent Rev. Manuel J. Gonsalves, a Baptist minister and a naturalized U.S. citizen from Madeira, to work with Rev. Ars\u00e9nio da Silva, who had emigrated with the exiles from Madeira, to arrange to resettle those who wanted to come to the United States. Rev. da Silva died in early 1849. Later in 1849, Rev. Gonsalves was then charged with escorting the exiles from Trinidad to settle in Sangamon and Morgan counties in Illinois on land purchased with funds raised by the American Protestant Society. Accounts state that between 700 and 1,000 exiles arrived in the United States at this time.\nSeveral large Madeiran communities continue around the world, including in the UK and Jersey. The Portuguese British community, made up mostly of Madeirans, celebrate Madeira Day.\nIn Venezuela the Madeiran Portuguese settled in cities such as Caracas and rural areas of the interior. According to figures from the 1990s, around 70% of the Portuguese diaspora in that country was made up of Madeirans and their descendants, initially dedicated to activities such as agriculture, but later, due to the lack of government support, the emigrants concentrated on commerce in the large Venezuelan cities. Among the companies founded by Madeirans are the supermarkets Central Madeirense, Excelsior Gama, Supermercados Unicasa, and Automercados Plaza, as well as many renowned bakeries. A state in Venezuela called Portuguesa was named after its large Portuguese population.\nImmigration.\nMadeira is part of the Schengen Area.\nIn 2023, Madeira had a population of 256,622, of whom 14,060, or 5.5%, were foreign-born. The most common nationalities were Venezuelans (commonly of Portuguese origins) 1,182 (15.5%), the United Kingdom 1,451 (10.3%), Brazilians 1,450 (10.3%), Germans 1,410 (10.0%), Italians 738 (5.2%), Russians 593, Americans 452 and French 426.\nPreviously reaching 253,259 in 2022, of whom the majority are locals. But Madeira has witnessed a rising foreign population for many years. As of 31 December 2022, immigrants in the region totalled 11,793 people, an increase of 13.3% from 2021. \"Nationals from Venezuela (19.7%), the United Kingdom (11.8%), Germany (9.4%) and Brazil (9.2%) continue to represent the main foreign communities in the region\", according to the DREM (Madeira Statistics Department).\nEconomy.\nThe gross domestic product (GDP) reached nearly 7 billion euros in 2023, accounting for 2.6% of Portugal's economic output. GDP per capita was of 27,370 euros or 73% of the EU27 average. The GDP per employee was 71% of the EU average.\nMadeira embraced Bitcoin by implementing policies that exempt Bitcoin investors from paying personal income taxes in the region. Madeira Regional Government President Miguel Albuquerque confirmed the inauguration of a business hub focused solely on Bitcoin and related innovations. Speaking in a dialogue with Prince Filip Kara\u0111or\u0111evi\u0107 of Serbia at Bitcoin Amsterdam 2023, he framed the move as a significant step toward technological advancements and international partnerships.\nMadeira International Business Center.\nThe Madeira International Business Center (MIBC) free trade zone has led to additional infrastructure, production shops and essential services for small and medium-sized industrial enterprises. MIBC comprises three sectors of investment: the Industrial Free Trade Zone, the International Shipping Register \u2013 MAR and International Services. Madeira's tax regime has been approved by the European Commission as legal State Aid and its deadline was extended through 2027. MIBC was created formally in the 1980s as a tool of regional economic policy. It consists of (mainly tax) incentives, granted with the objective of attracting investment into Madeira.\nFavorable operational and fiscal conditions were approved by the European Commission under Article 299 of the Treaty on European Union. The MIBC is integrated in the Portuguese and EU legal systems and is regulated and supervised by Portuguese and EU authorities in a transparent and stable business environment, clearly distinguished from so-called \"tax havens\" and \"offshore jurisdictions\". In 2015, the EC authorized a state aid regime for companies incorporated between 2015 and 2020 and extended the regime of tax reductions through 2027. The tax regime is outlined in Article 36\u00b0-A of the Portuguese Tax Incentives Statute. Available data demonstrates that this programme aided the local labor market, through the creation of qualified jobs and for professionals who have returned to Madeira; increased productivity; expanded business tourism from the visits of investors and their clients and suppliers, and other sectors such as real estate. Telecommunications and other services benefit from a larger client base. Companies attracted by MIBC represent over 40% of revenue in terms of corporate income tax for the Government of Madeira and nearly 3.000 jobs. Salaries there are above average in comparison with the wages paid in other sectors.\nRegional government.\nMadeira has been a significant recipient of European Union funding, totaling \u20ac2\u00a0billion. In 2012, it was reported that despite a population of just 250,000, the local administration owed some \u20ac6\u00a0billion. The Portuguese treasury (IGCP) assumed Madeira's debt management between 2012 and 2015. The region works with the central government on a long-term plan to reduce debt levels and commercial debt stock. Moody's noted that the region made significant fiscal consolidation efforts and that its tax revenue collection has improved. Tax revenues increased by 41% between 2012 and 2016, helping the region to reduce its deficit to operating revenue ratio to 10% in 2016 from 77% in 2013.\nTourism.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\nPearl of the Atlantic, island of eternal spring... Madeira well deserves its fanciful nicknames and the affection visitors and locals alike feel for this tiny volcanic island that offers so much.\n\"Lonely Planet\"\nTourism is an important sector in the region's economy, contributing 20% to the region's GDP, providing support throughout the year for commercial, transport and other activities and constituting a significant market for local products. The share in Gross Value Added of hotels and restaurants (9%) also highlights this phenomenon. The island of Porto Santo, with its beach and its climate, is entirely devoted to tourism.\nVisitors are mainly from Europe, with Portuguese, British, German and French tourists providing the main contingents (2021). The average annual occupancy rate was 60.3% in 2008, reaching its maximum in March and April, when it exceeds 70%.\nThe best time to visit Madeira is during spring and autumn for mild weather and fewer crowds, making it ideal for outdoor activities. Summer is perfect for beach lovers but can be crowded, while winter offers mild temperatures and fewer tourists, making it ideal for experiencing the island's waterfalls.\nWhale watching.\nWhale watching has become very popular in recent years. Many species of dolphins, such as common dolphin, Atlantic spotted dolphin, striped dolphin, bottlenose dolphin, short-finned pilot whale, and whales such as Bryde's whale, sei whale, fin whale, sperm whale, and beaked whales can be spotted near the coast or offshore.\nSustainable development.\nElectricity on Madeira is provided solely through EEM (Empresa de Electricidade da Madeira, SA, which holds a monopoly for the provision of electrical supply on the autonomous region) and consists largely of fossil fuels, but with a significant supply of seasonal hydroelectricity from the levada system, wind power and a small amount of solar. Energy production comes from conventional thermal and hydropower, as well as wind and solar energy. The Ribeira dos Soccoridos hydropower plant, rated at 15MW, utilises a pumped hydropower reservoir to recycle mountain water during the dry summer.\nBattery technologies are being tested to minimise Madeira's reliance on fossil fuel imports. Renault SA and EEM piloted the Sustainable Porto Santo\u2014Smart Fossil Free Island project on Porto Santo to demonstrate how fossil fuels can be entirely replaced with renewable energy, using a 3.3 MWh battery. Madeira operates a 15 MW 1-hour lithium iron phosphate battery with black start capability.\nIn the first half of 2022, 33% of the electricity consumed on the Portuguese archipelago of Madeira was sourced from renewable energy, a milestone achieved through a collaborative initiative co-funded by the European Union (EU).\nCentral to this accomplishment are the centuries-old stone pipes known as levadas, spanning thousands of kilometers and dating back to the fifteenth century. These levadas efficiently transport rainwater from northern regions to the south, serving various purposes such as human consumption, agriculture, and electricity production.\nThe Socorridos hydroelectric power station, fueled by water conveyed through the levadas, stands as the island's principal hydraulic system, providing power consistently throughout the year. A significant aspect of the EU-funded multi-million euro project involved enhancing water storage capacity, including the construction of a 5.4-kilometer tunnel and additional mountain tunnels, presenting formidable engineering challenges.\nWind power complements the system, facilitating the movement of stored water uphill during peak demand periods. The treated water serves dual purposes\u2014human consumption and agriculture\u2014while also functioning as a renewable energy source. Nuno Jorge Pereira, Water Production Director for Wood, Water, and Waste (ARM), elucidates the strategic use of water volumes to adapt to energy production levels.\nThis \u20ac34.7 million project, with \u20ac17.3 million co-financed by the European Cohesion Policy, not only mitigates concerns about drought but also earned acclaim as one of the best EU co-funded projects in the EGIOSTAR Awards.\nThe optimized Socorridos plant has notably alleviated water-related challenges for local farmers.\nTransport.\nThe islands have two airports, Cristiano Ronaldo International Airport and Porto Santo Airport, on the islands of Madeira and Porto Santo respectively. From Cristiano Ronaldo International Airport the most frequent flights are to Lisbon. There are also direct flights to over 30 other airports in Europe and nearby islands.\nTransport between the two main islands is by plane, or ferries from the Porto Santo Line, the latter also carrying vehicles. Visiting the interior of the islands is now easy thanks to construction of the \"Vias R\u00e1pidas\", major roads that cross the island. Modern roads reach all points of interest on the islands.\nFunchal has an extensive public transportation system. Bus companies, including Hor\u00e1rios do Funchal, which has been operating for over a hundred years, have regularly scheduled routes to all points of interest on the island.\nCulture.\nMusic.\nFolklore music in Madeira is widespread and mainly uses local musical instruments such as the machete, raj\u00e3o, brinquinho and cavaquinho, which are used in traditional folkloric dances like the .\nEmigrants from Madeira also influenced the creation of new musical instruments. In the 1880s, the ukulele was created, based on two small guitar-like instruments of Madeiran origin, the cavaquinho and the raj\u00e3o. The ukulele was introduced to the Hawaiian Islands by Portuguese immigrants from Madeira and Cape Verde. Three immigrants in particular, Madeiran cabinet makers Manuel Nunes, Jos\u00e9 do Esp\u00edrito Santo, and Augusto Dias, are generally credited as the first ukulele makers. Two weeks after they disembarked from the \"SS Ravenscrag\" in late August 1879, the \"Hawaiian Gazette\" reported that \"Madeira Islanders recently arrived here, have been delighting the people with nightly street concerts.\" The Madeiran band NAPA represented Portugal in the 2025 Eurovision Song Contest with the song Deslocado.\nCuisine.\nBecause of the geographic situation of Madeira in the Atlantic Ocean, the island has an abundance of fish of various kinds. The species that are consumed the most are espada (black scabbardfish), blue fin tuna, swordfish, white marlin, blue marlin, albacore, bigeye tuna, wahoo, spearfish, skipjack tuna and many others are found in the local dishes as they are found along the coast of Madeira. Espada is usually fried in a batter and accompanied by fried banana (Espada com banana) and sometimes a passionfruit sauce. Bacalhau is also popular, as it is in Mainland Portugal.\nThere are many different meat dishes on Madeira, one of the most popular being espetada. Espetada is traditionally made of large chunks of beef rubbed in garlic, salt and bay leaf and marinated for 4 to 6 hours in Madeira wine, red wine vinegar and olive oil then skewered onto a bay laurel stick and left to grill over smouldering wood chips. These are so integral a part of traditional eating habits that a special iron stand is available with a T-shaped end, each branch of the \"T\" having a slot in the middle to hold a brochette (espeto in Portuguese); a small plate is then placed underneath to collect the juices. The brochettes are very long and have a V-shaped blade in order to pierce the meat more easily. It is usually accompanied with the local bread called bolo do caco. A traditional holiday dish is \"Carne de Vinho e Alhos\", which is most closely associated with the pig slaughter that was held a few weeks before Christmas. A big event, traditionally it was attended by everyone in the village. The dish is made of pork which marinates for three days in white wine, vinegar, salt, and pepper and is then cooked with small potatoes, sliced carrots, and turnip. Another common meat dish is \"Picado\" \u2013 cubed beef cooked in a mushroom sauce and accompanied by fries.\nOther popular dishes in Madeira include a\u00e7orda, feijoada and carne de vinha d'alhos.\nTraditional pastries in Madeira usually contain local ingredients, one of the most common being \"mel de cana\", literally \"sugarcane honey\" (molasses). The traditional cake of Madeira is called \"Bolo de Mel\", which translates as (Sugarcane) \"Honey Cake\" and according to custom, is never cut with a knife, but broken into pieces by hand. It is a rich and heavy cake. The cake commonly known as \"Madeira cake\" in England is named after Madeira wine.\nMalasadas are a local confection which are mainly consumed during the Carnival of Madeira. Past\u00e9is de nata, as in the rest of Portugal, are also very popular.\nMilho frito is a popular dish in Madeira that is similar to the Italian dish polenta fritta. A\u00e7orda Madeirense is another popular local dish.\nMadeira is known for the high quality of its cherimoya fruits. The Annona Festival is traditional and held annually in the parish of Faial. This event encourages the consumption of this fruit and its derivatives, such as liqueurs, puddings, ice cream and smoothies.\nBeverages.\nMadeira wine is a fortified wine produced in the Madeira Islands; varieties may be sweet or dry. It has a history dating back to the Age of Exploration when Madeira was a standard port of call for ships heading to the New World or East Indies. To prevent the wine from spoiling, neutral grape spirits were added. However, wine producers of Madeira discovered, when an unsold shipment of wine returned to the islands after a round trip, that the flavour of the wine had been transformed by exposure to heat and movement. Today, Madeira is noted for its unique winemaking process that involves heating the wine and deliberately exposing the wine to some levels of oxidation. Most countries limit the use of the term \"Madeira\" to those wines that come from the Madeira Islands, to which the European Union grants Protected designation of origin (PDO) status.\nA local beer called Coral is produced by the Madeira Brewery, which dates from 1872. It has achieved 2 Monde Selection Grand Gold Medals, 24 Monde Selection Gold Medals and 2 Monde Selection Silver Medals. Other alcoholic drinks are also popular in Madeira, such as the locally created Poncha, Niquita, P\u00e9 de Cabra, and Aniz, as well as Portuguese drinks such as Macieira Brandy, Licor Beir\u00e3o.\nLaranjada is a type of carbonated soft drink with an orange flavour, its name being derived from the Portuguese word \"laranja\" (\"orange\"). Launched in 1872 it was the first soft drink to be produced in Portugal, and remains very popular to the present day. Brisa drinks, a brand name, are also very popular and come in a range of flavours.\nSport.\nFootball is the most popular sport in Madeira and the island was indeed the first place in Portugal to host a match, organised by British residents in 1875. The island is the birthplace of international star Cristiano Ronaldo and is home to two prominent teams, C.S. Mar\u00edtimo and C.D. Nacional, the latter of which he played youth football for before leaving to join Sporting CP.\nAs well as football, the island is also home to professional sports teams in basketball (CAB Madeira) and handball (Madeira Andebol SAD, who were runners up in the 2019 European Challenge Cup). Madeira was also the host of the 2003 World Handball Championship.\nThe Rally Vinho da Madeira is a rally race held annually since 1959, considered one of the biggest sporting events on the island It was part of the European Rally Championship from 1979 to 2012 and the Intercontinental Rally Challenge from 2006 to 2010.\nOther popular sporting activities include golf at one of the island's two courses (plus one on Porto Santo), surfing, scuba diving, and hiking.\nPostage stamps.\nPortugal has issued postage stamps for Madeira during several periods, beginning in 1868.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The original M16 rifle was a 5.56\u00d745mm automatic rifle with a 20-round magazine.\nIn 1964, the XM16E1 entered US military service as the M16 and in the following year was deployed for jungle warfare operations during the Vietnam War. In 1969, the M16A1 replaced the M14 rifle to become the US military's standard service rifle. The M16A1 incorporated numerous modifications including a bolt-assist (\"forward-assist\"), chrome-plated bore, protective reinforcement around the magazine release, and revised flash hider.\nIn 1983, the US Marine Corps adopted the M16A2 rifle, and the US Army adopted it in 1986. The M16A2 fires the improved 5.56\u00d745mm (M855/SS109) cartridge and has a newer adjustable rear sight, case deflector, heavy barrel, improved handguard, pistol grip, and buttstock, as well as a semi-auto and three-round burst fire selector. Adopted in July 1997, the M16A4 is the fourth generation of the M16 series. It is equipped with a removable carrying handle and quad Picatinny rail for mounting optics and other ancillary devices.\nThe M16 has also been widely adopted by other armed forces around the world. Total worldwide production of M16s is approximately 8 million, making it the most-produced firearm of its 5.56\u00a0mm caliber. The US military has largely replaced the M16 in frontline combat units with a shorter and lighter version, the M4 carbine. In April 2022, the U.S. Army selected the SIG MCX SPEAR as the winner of the Next Generation Squad Weapon Program to replace the M16/M4. The new rifle is designated M7.\nHistory.\nBackground.\nIn 1928, a U.S. Army 'Caliber Board' conducted firing tests at Aberdeen Proving Ground and recommended transitioning to smaller caliber rounds, mentioning, in particular caliber. Largely in deference to tradition, this recommendation was ignored and the Army referred to the caliber as \"full-sized\" for the next 35 years. After World War II, the United States military started looking for a single automatic rifle to replace the M1 Garand, M1/M2 carbines, M1918 Browning automatic rifle, M3 \"Grease Gun\" and Thompson submachine gun. However, early experiments with select-fire versions of the M1 Garand proved disappointing. During the Korean War, the select-fire M2 carbine largely replaced the submachine gun in US service and became the most widely used carbine variant. However, combat experience suggested that the .30 carbine round was underpowered. American weapons designers concluded that an intermediate round was necessary, and recommended a small-caliber, high-velocity cartridge.\nHowever, senior American commanders, having faced fanatical enemies and experienced major logistical problems during World War II and the Korean War, insisted that a single, powerful .30 caliber cartridge be developed, that could not only be used by the new automatic rifle but by the new general-purpose machine gun (GPMG) in concurrent development. This culminated in the development of the 7.62\u00d751\u00a0mm NATO cartridge.\nThe U.S. Army then began testing several rifles to replace the obsolete M1. Springfield Armory's T44E4 and heavier T44E5 were essentially updated versions of the M1 chambered for the new 7.62\u00a0mm round, while Fabrique Nationale submitted their FN FAL as the T48. ArmaLite entered the competition late, hurriedly submitting several AR-10 prototype rifles in the fall of 1956 to the U.S. Army's Springfield Armory for testing. The AR-10 featured an innovative straight-line barrel/stock design, forged aluminum alloy receivers, and with phenolic composite stocks. It had rugged elevated sights, an oversized aluminum flash suppressor and recoil compensator, and an adjustable gas system. The final prototype featured an upper and lower receiver with the now-familiar hinge and takedown pins, and the charging handle was on top of the receiver placed inside of the carry handle. For a 7.62\u00a0mm NATO rifle, the AR-10 was incredibly lightweight at only empty. Initial comments by Springfield Armory test staff were favorable, and some testers commented that the AR-10 was the best lightweight automatic rifle ever tested by the Armory. In the end, the U.S. Army chose the T44, now named the M14 rifle, which was an improved M1 Garand with a 20-round magazine and automatic fire capability. The U.S. also adopted the M60 general-purpose machine gun (GPMG). Its NATO partners adopted the FN FAL and HK G3 rifles, as well as the FN MAG and Rheinmetall MG3 GPMGs.\nThe first confrontations between the AK-47 and the M14 came in the early part of the Vietnam War. Battlefield reports indicated that the M14 was uncontrollable in full-auto and that soldiers could not carry enough ammunition to maintain fire superiority over the AK-47. And, while the M2 carbine offered a high rate of fire, it was under-powered and ultimately outclassed by the AK-47. A replacement was needed: a medium between the traditional preference for high-powered rifles such as the M14, and the lightweight firepower of the M2 carbine.\nAs a result, the Army was forced to reconsider a 1957 request by General Willard G. Wyman, commander of the U.S. Continental Army Command (CONARC) to develop a .223-inch caliber (5.56\u00a0mm) select-fire rifle weighing when loaded with a 20-round magazine. The 5.56\u00a0mm round had to penetrate a standard U.S. helmet at and retain a velocity over the speed of sound while matching or exceeding the wounding ability of the .30 carbine cartridge.\nThis request ultimately resulted in the development of a scaled-down version of the Armalite AR-10, named the ArmaLite AR-15. The AR-15 was first revealed by Eugene Stoner at Fort Benning in May 1957. The AR-15 used .22-caliber bullets, which destabilized when they hit a human body, as opposed to the .30 round, which typically passed through in a straight line. The smaller caliber meant that it could be controlled in auto fire due to the reduced bolt thrust and free recoil impulse. Being almost one-third the weight of the .30 meant that the soldier could sustain fire for longer with the same load. Due to design innovations, the AR-15 could fire 600 to 700 rounds a minute with an extremely low jamming rate. Parts were stamped out, not hand-machined, so they could be mass-produced, and the stock was plastic to reduce weight.\nIn 1958, the Army's Combat Developments Experimentation Command ran experiments with small squads in combat situations using the M14, AR-15, and Winchester's Light Weight Military Rifle (WLWMR). The resulting study recommended adopting a lightweight rifle like the AR-15. In response, the Army declared that all rifles and machine guns should use the same ammunition and ordered full production of the M14. However, advocates for the AR-15 gained the attention of Air Force Chief of Staff General Curtis LeMay. After testing the AR-15 with the ammunition manufactured by Remington that Armalite and Colt recommended, the Air Force declared that the AR-15 was its 'standard model' and ordered 8,500 rifles and 8.5 million rounds. Advocates for the AR-15 in the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency acquired 1,000 Air Force AR-15s and shipped them to be tested by the Army of the Republic of Vietnam (ARVN). The South Vietnam soldiers issued glowing reports of the weapon's reliability, recording zero broken parts while firing 80,000 rounds in one stage of testing, and requiring only two replacement parts for the 1,000 weapons over the entire course of testing. The report of the experiment recommended that the U.S. provide the AR-15 as the standard rifle of the ARVN, but Admiral Harry Felt, then Commander in Chief of Pacific Forces, rejected the recommendations on the advice of the U.S. Army.\nThroughout 1962 and 1963, the U.S. military extensively tested the AR-15. Positive evaluations emphasized its lightness, \"lethality\", and reliability. However, the Army Materiel Command criticized its inaccuracy at longer ranges and lack of penetrating power at higher ranges. In early 1963, the U.S. Special Forces asked and was given permission, to make the AR-15 its standard weapon. Other users included Army Airborne units in Vietnam and some units affiliated with the Central Intelligence Agency. As more units adopted the AR-15, Secretary of the Army Cyrus Vance ordered an investigation into why the weapon had been rejected by the Army. The resulting report found that Army Materiel Command had rigged the previous tests, selecting tests that would favor the M14 and choosing match grade M14s to compete against AR-15s out of the box. At this point, the bureaucratic battle lines were well-defined, with the Army ordnance agencies opposed to the AR-15 and the Air Force and civilian leadership of the Defense Department in favor.\nIn January 1963, Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara concluded that the AR-15 was the superior weapon system and ordered a halt to M14 production. In late 1963, the Defense Department began mass procurement of rifles for the Air Force and special Army units. Secretary McNamara designated the Army as the procurer for the weapon with the Department, which allowed the Army ordnance establishment to modify the weapon as they wished. The first modification was the addition of a \"manual bolt closure\", allowing a soldier to ram in a round if it failed to seat properly. The Air Force, which was buying the rifle, and the Marine Corps, which had tested it both objected to this addition, with the Air Force noting, \"During three years of testing and operation of the AR-15 rifle under all types of conditions the Air Force has no record of malfunctions that could have been corrected by a manual bolt closing device.\" They also noted that the closure added weight and complexity, reducing the reliability of the weapon. Colonel Harold Yount, who managed the Army procurement, would later state the bolt closure was added after direction from senior leadership, rather than as a result of any complaint or test result, and testified about the reasons: \"the M-1, the M-14, and the carbine had always had something for the soldier to push on; that maybe this would be a comforting feeling to him or something.\"\nAfter modifications, the new redesigned rifle was subsequently adopted as the M16 Rifle:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;(The M16) was much lighter compared to the M14 it replaced, ultimately allowing soldiers to carry more ammunition. The air-cooled, gas-operated, magazine-fed assault rifle was made of steel, aluminum alloy, and composite plastics, truly cutting-edge for the time. Designed with full and semi-automatic capabilities, the weapon initially did not respond well to wet and dirty conditions, sometimes even jamming in combat. After a few minor modifications, the weapon gained in popularity among troops on the battlefield.\nDespite its early failures the M16 proved to be a revolutionary design and stands as the longest continuously serving rifle in US military history. It has been adopted by many US allies and the 5.56\u00d745\u00a0mm NATO cartridge has become not only the NATO standard but \"the standard assault-rifle cartridge in much of the world.\" It also led to the development of small-caliber high-velocity service rifles by every major army in the world. It is a benchmark against which other assault rifles are judged.\nAdoption.\nIn July 1960, General Curtis LeMay was impressed by a demonstration of the ArmaLite AR-15. In the summer of 1961, General LeMay was promoted to U.S. Air Force chief of staff and requested 80,000 AR-15s. However, General Maxwell D. Taylor, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, advised President John F. Kennedy that having two different calibers within the military system at the same time would be problematic and the request was rejected. In October 1961, William Godel, a senior man at the Advanced Research Projects Agency, sent 10 AR-15s to South Vietnam. The reception was enthusiastic, and in 1962 another 1,000 AR-15s were sent. United States Army Special Forces personnel filed battlefield reports lavishly praising the AR-15 and the stopping power of the 5.56\u00a0mm cartridge and pressed for its adoption.\nThe damage caused by the 5.56\u00a0mm bullet was originally believed to be caused by \"tumbling\" due to the slow 1 turn in rifling twist rate. However, any pointed lead core bullet will \"tumble\" after penetration into flesh, because the center of gravity is towards the rear of the bullet. The large wounds observed by soldiers in Vietnam were caused by bullet fragmentation created by a combination of the bullet's velocity and construction. These wounds were so devastating that the photographs remained classified into the 1980s.\nHowever, despite overwhelming evidence that the AR-15 could bring more firepower to bear than the M14, the Army opposed the adoption of the new rifle. U.S. Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara now had two conflicting views: the ARPA report favoring the AR-15 and the Army's position favoring the M14. Even President Kennedy expressed concern, so McNamara ordered Secretary of the Army, Cyrus Vance, to test the M14, the AR-15, and the AK-47. The Army reported that only the M14 was suitable for service, but Vance wondered about the impartiality of those conducting the tests. He ordered the Army Inspector General to investigate the testing methods used; the inspector general confirmed that the testers were biased toward the M14.\nIn January 1963, Secretary McNamara received reports that M14 production was insufficient to meet the needs of the armed forces and ordered a halt to M14 production. At the time, the AR-15 was the only rifle that could fulfill a requirement of a \"universal\" infantry weapon for issue to all services. McNamara ordered its adoption, despite receiving reports of several deficiencies, most notably the lack of a chrome-plated chamber.\nAfter modifications (most notably, the charging handle was re-located from under the carrying handle like the AR-10, to the rear of the receiver), the newly redesigned rifle was renamed the \"Rifle, Caliber 5.56\u00a0mm, M16\". Inexplicably, the modification to the new M16 did not include a chrome-plated barrel. Meanwhile, the Army relented and recommended the adoption of the M16 for jungle warfare operations. However, the Army insisted on the inclusion of a forward assist to help push the bolt into battery if a cartridge failed to seat into the chamber. The Air Force, Colt, and Eugene Stoner believed that the addition of a forward assist was an unjustified expense. As a result, the design was split into two variants: the Air Force's M16 without the forward assist, and the XM16E1 with the forward assist for the other service branches.\nIn November 1963, McNamara approved the U.S. Army's order of 85,000 XM16E1s; and to appease General LeMay, the Air Force was granted an order for another 19,000 M16s. In March 1964, the M16 rifle went into production and the Army accepted delivery of the first batch of 2,129 rifles later that year, and an additional 57,240 rifles the following year.\nIn 1964, the Army was informed that DuPont could not mass-produce the IMR 4475 stick powder to the specifications demanded by the M16. Therefore, Olin Mathieson Company provided a high-performance ball propellant. While the Olin WC 846 powder achieved the desired per second muzzle velocity, it produced much more fouling, which quickly jammed the M16's action (unless the rifle was cleaned well and often).\nIn March 1965, the Army began to issue the XM16E1 to infantry units. However, the rifle was initially delivered without adequate cleaning kits or instructions because advertising from Colt asserted that the M16's materials made the weapon require little maintenance, leading to a misconception that it was capable of self-cleaning. Furthermore, cleaning was often conducted with improper equipment, such as insect repellent, water, and aircraft fuel, which induced further wear on the weapon. As a result, reports of stoppages in combat began to surface. The most severe problem was known as \"failure to extract\"\u2014the spent cartridge case remained lodged in the chamber after the rifle was fired. Documented accounts of dead U.S. troops found next to disassembled rifles eventually led to a Congressional investigation:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;We left with 72 men in our platoon and came back with 19. ...Believe it or not, you know what killed most of us? Our own rifle. Practically every one of our dead was found with his (M16) torn down next to him where he had been trying to fix it.\u2014\u200a\nIn February 1967, the improved XM16E1 was standardized as the M16A1. The new rifle had a chrome-plated chamber and bore to eliminate corrosion and stuck cartridges, and other minor modifications. New cleaning kits, powder solvents, and lubricants were also issued. Intensive training programs in weapons cleaning were instituted including a comic book-style operations manual. As a result, reliability problems were largely resolved and the M16A1 rifle achieved widespread acceptance by U.S. troops in Vietnam.\nIn 1969, the M16A1 officially replaced the M14 rifle to become the U.S. military's standard service rifle. In 1970, the new WC 844 powder was introduced to reduce fouling.\nColt, H&amp;R, and GM Hydramatic Division manufactured M16A1 rifles during the Vietnam War. M16s were produced by Colt until the late 1980s when FN Herstal (FN USA) began to manufacture them.\nReliability.\nDuring the early part of its service, the M16 had a reputation for poor reliability and a malfunction rate of two per 1000 rounds fired. The M16's action works by passing high-pressure propellant gasses, tapped from the barrel, down a tube and into the carrier group within the upper receiver. The gas goes from the gas tube, through the bolt carrier key, and into the inside of the carrier where it expands in a donut-shaped gas-piston cylinder. Because the bolt is prevented from moving forward by the barrel, the carrier is driven to the rear by the expanding gases and thus converts the energy of the gas to the movement of the rifle's parts. The back part of the bolt forms a piston head and the cavity in the bolt carrier is the piston sleeve. While the M16 is commonly said to use a direct impingement system, this is incorrect, and it is instead correct to say it uses an \"internal piston\" system. This system is however ammunition specific, since it does not have an adjustable gas port or valve to adjust the weapon to various propellant and projectile or barrel length specific pressure behavior.\nThe M16 operating system designed by Stoner is lighter and more compact than a gas-piston design. However, this design requires that combustion byproducts from the discharged cartridge be blown into the receiver as well. This accumulating carbon and vaporized metal build-up within the receiver and bolt carrier negatively affects reliability and necessitates more intensive maintenance on the part of the individual soldier. The channeling of gasses into the bolt carrier during operation increases the amount of heat that is deposited in the receiver while firing the M16 and causes the essential lubricant to be \"burned off\". This requires frequent and generous applications of appropriate lubricant. Lack of proper lubrication is the most common source of weapon stoppages or jams.\nThe original M16 fared poorly in the jungles of Vietnam and was infamous for reliability problems in harsh environments. Max Hastings was very critical of the M16's general field issue in Vietnam just as grievous design flaws were becoming apparent. He further states that the \"Shooting Times\" experienced repeated malfunctions with a test M16 and assumed these would be corrected before military use, but they were not. Many Marines and soldiers were so angry with the reliability problems they began writing home and on 26 March 1967, the \"Washington Daily News\" broke the story. Eventually, the M16 became the target of a congressional investigation.\nThe investigation found that:\nWhen these issues were addressed and corrected by the M16A1, the reliability problems decreased greatly. According to a 1968 Department of Army report, the M16A1 rifle achieved widespread acceptance by U.S. troops in Vietnam. \"Most men armed with the M16 in Vietnam rated this rifle's performance high, however, many men entertained some misgivings about the M16's reliability. When asked what weapon they preferred to carry in combat, 85 percent indicated that they wanted either the M16 or its [smaller] carbine-length version, the XM177E2.\" Also, \"the M14 was preferred by 15 percent, while less than one percent wished to carry either the Stoner rifle, the AK-47, the [M1] carbine or a pistol.\" In March 1970, the \"President's Blue Ribbon Defense Panel\" concluded that the issuance of the M16 saved the lives of 20,000 U.S. servicemen during the Vietnam War, who would have otherwise died had the M14 remained in service. However, the M16 rifle's reputation has suffered as of 2011.\nAnother underlying cause of the M16's jamming problem was identified by ordnance staff that discovered that Stoner and ammunition manufacturers had initially tested the AR-15 using DuPont IMR8208M extruded (stick) powder. Later ammunition manufacturers adopted the more readily available Olin Mathieson WC846 ball powder. The ball powder produced a longer peak chamber pressure with undesired timing effects. Upon firing, the cartridge case expands and seals the chamber (obturation). When the peak pressure starts to drop the cartridge case contracts and then can be extracted. With ball powder, the cartridge case was not contracted enough during extraction due to the longer peak pressure period. The ejector would then fail to extract the cartridge case, tearing through the case rim, and leaving an obturated case behind.\nAfter the introduction of the M4 carbine, it was found that the shorter barrel length of 14.5 inches also harms the reliability, as the gas port is located closer to the chamber than the gas port of the standard length M16 rifle: 7.5\u00a0inches instead of 13\u00a0inches. This affects the M4's timing and increases the amount of stress and heat on the critical components, thereby reducing reliability. In a 2002 assessment, the USMC found that the M4 malfunctioned three times more often than the M16A4 (the M4 failed 186 times for 69,000 rounds fired, while the M16A4 failed 61 times). Thereafter, the Army and Colt worked to make modifications to the M4s and M16A4s to address the problems found. In tests conducted in 2005 and 2006 the Army found that on average, the new M4s and M16s fired approximately 5,000 rounds between stoppages.\nIn December 2006, the Center for Naval Analyses (CNA) released a report on U.S. small arms in combat. The CNA conducted surveys on 2,608 troops returning from combat in Iraq and Afghanistan over the past 12 months. Only troops who had fired their weapons at enemy targets were allowed to participate. 1,188 troops were armed with M16A2 or A4 rifles, making up 46 percent of the survey. 75 percent of M16 users (891 troops) reported they were satisfied with the weapon. 60 percent (713 troops) were satisfied with handling qualities such as handguards, size, and weight. Of the 40 percent dissatisfied, most were with its size. Only 19 percent of M16 users (226 troops) reported a stoppage, while 80 percent of those that experienced a stoppage said it had little effect on their ability to clear the stoppage and re-engage their target. Half of the M16 users experienced failures in their magazines to feed. 83 percent (986 troops) did not need their rifles repaired while in the theater. 71 percent (843 troops) were confident in the M16's reliability, defined as a level of soldier confidence their weapon will fire without malfunction, and 72 percent (855 troops) were confident in its durability, defined as a level of soldier confidence their weapon will not break or need repair. Both factors were attributed to high levels of soldiers performing their maintenance. 60 percent of M16 users offered recommendations for improvements. Requests included greater bullet lethality, newly built instead of rebuilt rifles, better-quality magazines, decreased weight, and a collapsible stock. Some users recommended shorter and lighter weapons such as the M4 carbine. Some issues have been addressed with the issuing of the Improved STANAG magazine in March 2009, and the M855A1 Enhanced Performance Round in June 2010.\nIn early 2010, two journalists from \"The New York Times\" spent three months with soldiers and Marines in Afghanistan. While there, they questioned around 100 infantry troops about the reliability of their M16 rifles, as well as the M4 carbine. The troops did not report reliability problems with their rifles. While only 100 troops were asked, they engaged in daily fighting in Marja, including at least a dozen intense engagements in Helmand Province, where the ground is covered in fine powdered sand (called \"moon dust\" by troops) that can stick to firearms. Weapons were often dusty, wet, and covered in mud. Intense firefights lasted hours with several magazines being expended. Only one soldier reported a jam when his M16 was covered in mud after climbing out of a canal. The weapon was cleared and resumed firing with the next chambered round. Furthermore, the Marine Chief Warrant Officer responsible for weapons training and performance of the Third Battalion, Sixth Marines, reported that \"We've had nil in the way of problems; we've had no issues\", with his battalion's 350 M16s and 700 M4s.\nDesign.\nThe M16 is a lightweight, 5.56\u00a0mm, air-cooled, gas-operated, magazine-fed assault rifle, with a rotating bolt. The M16's receivers are made of 7075 aluminum alloy, its barrel, bolt, and bolt carrier of steel, and its handguards, pistol grip, and buttstock of plastics.\nThe M16 internal piston action was derived from the original ArmaLite AR-10 and ArmaLite AR-15 actions. This internal piston action system designed by Eugene Stoner is commonly called a direct impingement system, but it does not use a conventional direct impingement system. In https://, the designer states: \u2033This invention is a true expanding gas system instead of the conventional impinging gas system.\u2033 The gas system, bolt carrier, and bolt-locking design is ammunition specific, since it does not have an adjustable gas port or valve to adjust the weapon to various propellant and projectile or barrel length specific pressure behavior.\nThe M16A1 was especially lightweight at with a loaded 30-round magazine. This was significantly less than the M14 that it replaced at with a loaded 20-round magazine. It is also lighter when compared to the AKM's with a loaded 30-round magazine.\nThe M16A2 weighs loaded with a 30-round magazine, because of the adoption of a thicker barrel profile. The thicker barrel is more resistant to damage when handled roughly and is also slower to overheat during sustained fire. Unlike a traditional \"bull\" barrel that is thick its entire length, the M16A2's barrel is only thick forward of the handguards. The barrel profile under the handguards remained the same as the M16A1 for compatibility with the M203 grenade launcher.\nBarrel.\nEarly model M16 barrels had a rifling twist of four grooves, right-hand twist, one turn in 14\u00a0inches (1:355.6\u00a0mm or 64 calibers) bore\u2014as it was the same rifling as used by the .222 Remington sporting cartridge. After finding out that under unfavorable conditions, military bullets could yaw in flight at long ranges, the rifling was soon altered. Later M16 models and the M16A1 had an improved rifling with six grooves, right-hand twist, one turn in 12\u00a0inches (1:304.8\u00a0mm or 54.8 calibers) for increased accuracy and was optimized to adequately stabilize the M193 ball and M196 tracer bullets. M16A2 and current models are optimized for firing the heavier NATO SS109 ball and long L110 tracer bullets and have six grooves, right-hand twist, one turn in 7 in (1:177.8\u00a0mm or 32 calibers).\nM193 ball and M196 tracer bullets may be fired in a rifle with a one turn in 7 in (1:177.8\u00a0mm or 32 calibers) twist barrel. NATO SS109 ball and L110 tracer bullets should only be used in emergency situations at ranges under with a one turn in 12\u00a0inches (1:304.8\u00a0mm or 54.8 calibers) twist, as this twist is insufficient to stabilize these projectiles.\nWeapons designed to adequately stabilize both the M193 or SS109 projectiles (like civilian market clones) usually have a six-groove, right-hand twist, one turn in 9\u00a0inches (1:228.6\u00a0mm or 41.1 calibers) or one turn in 8\u00a0inches (1:203.2\u00a0mm or 36.5 calibers) bore, although other and 1:7\u00a0inches twist rates are available as well.\nRecoil.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The (M16's) Stoner system provides a very symmetric design that allows straight-line movement of the operating components. This allows recoil forces to drive straight to the rear. Instead of connecting or other mechanical parts driving the system, high-pressure gas performs this function, reducing the weight of moving parts and the rifle as a whole.\nThe M16 uses a \"straight-line\" recoil design, where the recoil spring is located in the stock directly behind the action, and serves the dual function of operating spring and recoil buffer. The stock being in line with the bore also reduces muzzle rise, especially during automatic fire. Because recoil does not significantly shift the point of aim, faster follow-up shots are possible and user fatigue is reduced. In addition, current model M16 flash-suppressors also act as compensators to reduce recoil further.\nNotes: Free recoil is calculated by using the rifle weight, bullet weight, muzzle velocity, and charge weight. It is that which would be measured if the rifle were fired suspended from strings, free to recoil. A rifle's perceived recoil is also dependent on many other factors which are not readily quantified.\nSights.\nThe M16's most distinctive ergonomic feature is the carrying handle and rear sight assembly on top of the receiver. This is a by-product of the original AR-10 design, where the carrying handle contained a rear sight that could be set for specific range settings and also served to protect the charging handle.\nThe M16 carry handle also provided mounting groove interfaces and a hole at the bottom of the handle groove for mounting a Colt 3\u00d720 telescopic sight featuring a Bullet Drop Compensation elevation adjustment knob for ranges from . This concurs with the pre-M16A2 maximum effective range of . The Colt 3\u00d720 telescopic sight was factory adjusted to be parallax-free at . In Delft, the Netherlands Artillerie-Inrichtingen produced a roughly similar 3\u00d725 telescopic sight for the carrying handle mounting interfaces.\nThe M16 elevated iron sight line has a sight radius. As the M16 series rear sight, front sight and sighting in targets designs were modified over time and non-iron sight (optical) aiming devices and new service ammunition were introduced zeroing procedures changed.\nThe standard pre-M16A2 \"Daylight Sight System\" uses an AR-15-style L-type flip, two aperture rear sight featuring two combat settings: short-range and long-range , marked 'L'. The pre-M16A2 \"Daylight Sight System\" short-range and long-range zeros are with M193 ammunition. The rear sight features a windage drum that can be adjusted during zeroing with about 1 MOA increments. The front sight is a tapered round post of approximately diameter adjustable during zeroing in about 1 MOA increments. A cartridge or tool is required to (re)zero the sight line.\nAn alternative pre-M16A2 \"Low Light Level Sight System\", includes a front sight post with a weak light source provided by tritium radioluminescence in an embedded small glass vial and a two aperture rear sight consisting of a diameter aperture marked 'L' intended for normal use out to and a diameter large aperture for night firing. Regulation stipulates the radioluminescent front sight post must be replaced if more than 144 months (12 years) elapsed after manufacture. The \"Low Light Level Sight System\" elevation and windage adjustment increments are somewhat coarser compared to the \"Daylight Sight System\".\nWith the advent of the M16A2, a less simple fully adjustable rear sight was added, allowing the rear sight to be dialed in with an elevation wheel for specific range settings between in 100 m increments and to allow windage adjustments with a windage knob without the need of a cartridge or tool. The unmarked approximately diameter aperture rear sight is for normal firing situations, zeroing and with the elevation knob for target distances up to 800 meters. The downsides of relatively small rear sight apertures are less light transmission through the aperture and a reduced field of view. A new larger approximately diameter aperture, marked '0-2' and featuring a windage setting index mark, offers a larger field of view during battle conditions and is used as a ghost ring for quick target engagement and during limited visibility. When flipped down, the engraved windage mark on top of the '0-2' aperture ring shows the dialed in windage setting on a windage scale at the rear of the rear sight assembly. When the normal use rear aperture sight is zeroed at 300 m with SS109/M855 ammunition, first used in the M16A2, the '0-2' rear sight will be zeroed for 200 m. The front sight post was widened to approximately diameter and became square and became adjustable during zeroing in about 1.2 MOA increments.\nThe M16A4 omitted the carrying handle and rear sight assembly on top of the receiver. Instead, it features a MIL-STD-1913 Picatinny railed flat-top upper receiver for mounting various optical sighting devices or a new detachable carrying handle and M16A2-style rear sight assembly. The current U.S. Army and Air Force issue M4A1 carbine comes with the M68 close combat optic and back-up iron sight. The U.S. Marine Corps uses the ACOG Rifle Combat Optic and the U.S. Navy uses the EOTech holographic weapon sight.\nRange and accuracy.\nThe M16 rifle is considered to be very accurate for a service rifle. Its light recoil, high-velocity and flat trajectory allow shooters to take headshots out to 300 meters. Newer M16s use the newer M855 cartridge increasing their effective range to 600 meters. They are more accurate than their predecessors and are capable of shooting 1\u20133-inch groups at 100 yards. \"In Fallujah, Iraq Marines with ACOG-equipped M16A4s created a stir by taking so many headshots that until the wounds were closely examined, some observers thought the insurgents had been executed.\" The newest M855A1 EPR cartridge is even more accurate and during testing \"...has shown that, on average, 95 percent of the rounds will hit within an 8 \u00d7 8-inch (20.3 \u00d7 20.3 cm) target at 600 meters.\"\nTerminal ballistics.\nThe 5.56\u00d745mm cartridge had several advantages over the 7.62\u00d751mm NATO round used in the M14 rifle. It enabled each soldier to carry more ammunition and was easier to control during automatic or burst fire. The 5.56\u00d745mm NATO cartridge can also produce massive wounding effects when the bullet impacts at high speed and yaws (\"tumbles\") in tissue leading to fragmentation and rapid transfer of energy.\nThe original ammunition for the M16 was the 55-grain M193 cartridge. When fired from a barrel at ranges of up to , the thin-jacketed lead-cored round traveled fast enough (above ) that the force of striking a human body would cause the round to yaw (or tumble) and fragment into about a dozen pieces of various sizes thus created wounds that were out of proportion to its caliber. These wounds were so devastating that many considered the M16 to be an inhumane weapon. As the 5.56\u00a0mm round's velocity decreases, so does the number of fragments that it produces. The 5.56\u00a0mm round does not normally fragment at distances beyond 200 meters or at velocities below 2500\u00a0ft/s, and its lethality becomes largely dependent on shot placement.\nWith the development of the M16A2, the new 62-grain M855 cartridge was adopted in 1983. The heavier bullet had more energy and was made with a steel core to penetrate Soviet body armor. However, this caused less fragmentation on impact and reduced effects against targets without armor, both of which lessened kinetic energy transfer and wounding ability. Some soldiers and Marines coped with this through training, with requirements to shoot vital areas three times to guarantee killing the target.\nHowever, there have been repeated and consistent reports of the M855's inability to wound effectively (i.e., fragment) when fired from the short barreled M4 carbine (even at close ranges). The M4's 14.5-in. barrel length reduces muzzle velocity to about 2900\u00a0ft/s. This reduced wounding ability is one reason that, despite the Army's transition to short-barrel M4s, the Marine Corps has decided to continue using the M16A4 with its 20-inch barrel as the 5.56\u00d745mm M855 is largely dependent upon high velocity in order to wound effectively.\nIn 2003, the U.S. Army contended that the lack of lethality of the 5.56\u00d745mm was more a matter of perception than fact. With good shot placement to the head and chest, the target was usually defeated without issue. The majority of failures were the result of hitting the target in non-vital areas such as extremities. However, a minority of failures occurred in spite of multiple hits to the chest. In 2006, a study found that 20% of soldiers using the M4 carbine wanted more lethality or stopping power. In June 2010, the U.S. Army announced it began shipping its new 5.56\u00a0mm, lead-free, M855A1 Enhanced Performance Round to active combat zones. This upgrade is designed to maximize performance of the 5.56\u00d745mm round, to extend range, improve accuracy, increase penetration and to consistently fragment in soft-tissue when fired from not only standard length M16s, but also the short-barreled M4 carbines. The U.S. Army has been impressed with the new M855A1 EPR round. A 7.62 NATO M80A1 EPR variant was also developed.\nMagazines.\nThe M16's magazine was meant to be a lightweight, disposable item. As such, it is made of pressed/stamped aluminum and was not designed to be durable. The M16 originally used a 20-round magazine which was later replaced by a bent 30-round design. As a result, the magazine follower tends to rock or tilt, causing malfunctions. Many non-U.S. and commercial magazines have been developed to effectively mitigate these shortcomings, e.g., Heckler &amp; Koch's all-stainless-steel \"High-Reliability\" magazine, Magpul's polymer P-MAG and E-MAG, etc.\nProduction of the 30-round magazine started late 1967 but did not fully replace the 20-round magazine until the mid-1970s. Standard USGI aluminum 30-round M16 magazines weigh empty and are long. The newer plastic magazines are about a half-inch longer. The newer steel magazines are about 0.5-inch longer and four ounces heavier. The M16's magazine has become the unofficial NATO STANAG magazine and is currently used by many Western nations, in numerous weapon systems.\nIn 2009, the U.S. military began fielding an \"improved magazine\" identified by a tan-colored follower. \"The new follower incorporates an extended rear leg and modified bullet protrusion for improved round stacking and orientation. The self-leveling/anti-tilt follower minimizes jamming while a wider spring coil profile creates even force distribution. The performance gains have not added weight or cost to the magazines.\"\nIn July 2016, the U.S. Army introduced another improvement, the new Enhanced Performance Magazine, which it says will result in a 300% increase in reliability in the M4 carbine. Developed by the United States Army Armament Research, Development and Engineering Center and the Army Research Laboratory in 2013, it is tan colored with blue follower to distinguish it from earlier, incompatible magazines.\nMuzzle devices.\nMost M16 rifles have a barrel threaded in 1\u20442-28\" threads to incorporate the use of a muzzle device such as a flash suppressor or sound suppressor. The initial flash suppressor design had three tines or prongs and was designed to preserve the shooter's night vision by disrupting the flash. Unfortunately it was prone to breakage and getting entangled in vegetation. The design was later changed to close the end to avoid this and became known as the \"A1\" or \"bird cage\" flash suppressor on the M16A1. Eventually on the M16A2 version of the rifle, the bottom port was closed to reduce muzzle climb and prevent dust from rising when the rifle was fired in the prone position. For these reasons, the U.S. military declared the A2 flash suppressor as a compensator or a muzzle brake; but it is more commonly known as the \"GI\" or \"A2\" flash suppressor.\nThe M16's Vortex Flash Hider weighs 3 ounces, is 2.25 inches long, and does not require a lock washer to attach to the barrel. It was developed in 1984 and is one of the earliest privately designed muzzle devices. The U.S. military uses the Vortex Flash Hider on M4 carbines and M16 rifles. A version of the Vortex has been adopted by the Canadian Military for the Colt Canada C8 CQB rifle. Other flash suppressors developed for the M16 include the Phantom Flash Suppressor by Yankee Hill Machine (YHM) and the KX-3 by Noveske Rifleworks.\nThe threaded barrel allows sound suppressors with the same thread pattern to be installed directly to the barrel; however this can result in complications such as being unable to remove the suppressor from the barrel due to repeated firing on full auto or three-round burst. A number of suppressor manufacturers have designed \"direct-connect\" sound suppressors which can be installed over an existing M16's flash suppressor as opposed to using the barrel's threads.\nGrenade launchers and shotguns.\nAll current M16-type rifles can mount under-barrel 40\u00a0mm grenade launchers, such as the M203 and M320. Both use the same 40\u00d746mm LV grenades as the older, stand-alone M79 grenade launcher. The M16 can also mount under-barrel 12 gauge shotguns such as KAC Masterkey or the M26 Modular Accessory Shotgun System.\nM234 launcher.\nThe M234 riot control launcher is an M16-series rifle attachment firing an M755 blank round. The M234 mounts on the muzzle, bayonet lug, and front sight post of the M16. It fires either the M734 64\u00a0mm kinetic riot control or the M742 64\u00a0mm CSI riot control ring airfoil projectiles. The latter produces a 4 to 5-foot tear gas cloud on impact. The main advantage to using ring airfoil projectiles is that their design does not allow them to be thrown back by rioters with any real effect. The M234 is no longer used by U.S. forces. It has been replaced by the M203 grenade launcher and nonlethal ammunition.\nBayonet.\nThe M16 is long with an M7 bayonet attached. The M7 bayonet is based on earlier designs such as the M4, M5, &amp; M6 bayonets, all of which are direct descendants of the M3 fighting knife and have spear-point blade with a half sharpened secondary edge. The newer M9 bayonet has a clip-point blade with saw teeth along the spine and can be used as a multi-purpose knife and wire-cutter when combined with its scabbard. The current USMC OKC-3S bayonet bears a resemblance to the Marines' iconic Ka-Bar fighting knife with serrations near the handle.\nBipod.\nFor use as an ad-hoc automatic rifle, the M16 and M16A1 could be equipped with the XM3 bipod, later standardized as the \"Bipod, M3\" (1966) and \"Rifle Bipod M3\" (1983). Weighing only 0.6\u00a0lb, the simple and non-adjustable bipod clamps to the barrel of the rifle to allow for supported fire.\nNATO standards.\nIn March 1970, the U.S. recommended that all NATO forces adopt the 5.56\u00d745mm cartridge. This shift represented a change in the philosophy of the military's long-held position about caliber size. By the mid 1970s, other armies were looking at M16-style weapons. A NATO standardization effort soon started and tests of various rounds were carried out starting in 1977. The U.S. offered the 5.56\u00d745mm M193 round, but there were concerns about its penetration in the face of the wider introduction of body armor. In the end, the Belgian 5.56\u00d745mm SS109 round was chosen (STANAG 4172) in October 1980. The SS109 round was based on the U.S. cartridge but included a new stronger, heavier, 62-grain bullet design, with better long-range performance and improved penetration (specifically, to consistently penetrate the side of a steel helmet at 600 meters). Due to its design and lower muzzle velocity (about 3110\u00a0ft/s) the Belgian SS109 round is considered more humane because it is less likely to fragment than the U.S. M193 round. The NATO 5.56\u00d745mm standard ammunition produced for U.S. forces is designated M855.\nIn October 1980, shortly after NATO accepted the 5.56\u00d745mm NATO rifle cartridge. Draft Standardization Agreement 4179 (STANAG 4179) was proposed to allow NATO members to easily share rifle ammunition and magazines down to the individual soldier level. The magazine chosen to become the \"STANAG magazine\" was originally designed for the U.S. M16 rifle. Many NATO member nations, but not all, subsequently developed or purchased rifles with the ability to accept this type of magazine. However, the standard was never ratified and remains a 'Draft STANAG'.\nAll current M16 type rifles are designed to fire STANAG 22\u00a0mm rifle grenades from their integral flash hiders without the use of an adapter. These 22\u00a0mm grenade types range from anti-tank rounds to simple finned tubes with a fragmentation hand grenade attached to the end. They come in the \"standard\" type which are propelled by a blank cartridge inserted into the chamber of the rifle. They also come in the \"bullet trap\" and \"shoot through\" types, as their names imply, they use live ammunition. The U.S. military does not generally use rifle grenades; however, they are used by other nations.\nThe NATO Accessory Rail STANAG 4694, or Picatinny rail STANAG 2324, or a \"Tactical Rail\" is a bracket used on M16 type rifles to provide a standardized mounting platform. The rail comprises a series of ridges with a T-shaped cross-section interspersed with flat \"spacing slots\". Scopes are mounted either by sliding them on from one end or the other; by means of a \"rail-grabber\" which is clamped to the rail with bolts, thumbscrews or levers; or onto the slots between the raised sections. The rail was originally for scopes. However, once established, the use of the system was expanded to other accessories, such as tactical lights, laser aiming modules, night vision devices, reflex sights, foregrips, bipods, and bayonets.\nCurrently, the M16 is in use by 15 NATO countries and more than 80 countries worldwide.\nVariants.\nM16.\nThis was the first M16 variant adopted operationally, originally by the U.S. Air Force. It was equipped with triangular handguards, buttstocks without a compartment for the storage of a cleaning kit, a three-pronged \"duckbill\" flash suppressor designed to preserve the shooter's night vision by disrupting the flash, full auto, and no forward assist. The M16 has a safe/semi/auto selective fire trigger group. Bolt carriers were originally chrome plated and slick-sided, lacking forward assist notches. Later, the chrome-plated carriers were dropped in favor of Army-issued notched and parkerized carriers, though the interior portion of the bolt carrier is still chrome-lined. The barrel rifling had a 1:12 (305\u00a0mm) twist rate to adequately stabilize the M193 ball and M196 tracer ammunition. The Air Force continued to operate these weapons until around 2001, at which time the Air Force converted all of its M16s to the M16A2 configuration.\nThe M16 was also adopted by the British SAS, who used it during the Falklands War.\nXM16E1 and M16A1 (Colt Model 603).\nThe U.S. Army XM16E1 was essentially the same weapon as the M16 with the addition of a forward assist and corresponding notches in the chrome bolt carrier. A rib was built into the side of the receiver to help prevent accidentally pressing the magazine release button while closing the ejection port cover.\nThe M16A1 was the finalized production model and was produced from February 1967 until 1982. To address issues with the XM16E1, for the M16A1 a closed, birdcage symmetric flash suppressor with open side slots to the top, bottom, left and right replaced the XM16E1's three-pronged flash suppressor, which caught on twigs and leaves, from 1967 onwards. Various other changes were made after numerous problems in the field. Cleaning kits were developed and issued, while barrels with chrome-plated chambers and later fully lined bores were introduced. A small storage compartment inside the stock was introduced. Covered by a trapdoor with checkered anti-slip texturing, it is often used for storing a basic cleaning kit. To promote reliability and durability, the mechanical behavior of the operating system was revised to make it compatible for using US military issued ammunition loaded with WC846 ball powder (which reaches peak pressure significantly quicker than the extruded IMR8208M powder and increases the cyclic rate of fire for which the operating system was originally designed). Revisions like reducing the diameter of the gas port to mitigate the higher port pressure caused by the ball powder to properly gas the operating system again, updating the buffer assembly, changing the bolt carrier surface finish to manganese phosphate and the gas tube material to stainless steel contributed to improved mechanical behavior.\nThe rib was extended on production M16A1s to help in preventing the magazine release from inadvertently being pressed. The hole in the bolt that accepts the cam pin was crimped inward on one side, in such a way that the cam pin may not be inserted with the bolt installed backwards, which would cause failures to eject until corrected. With these and other changes, the malfunction rate slowly declined, and new soldiers were generally unfamiliar with early problems.\nThe M16A1 saw limited use in training capacities until the early 2000s, but is no longer in active service with the U.S., although is still standard issue in many world armies.\nM16A2.\nThe development of the M16A2 rifle was originally requested by the United States Marine Corps in 1979 as a result of combat experience in Vietnam with the M16A1. It was officially adopted by the Department of Defense as the \"Rifle, 5.56\u00a0mm, M16A2\" in 1983. The Marines were the first branch of the U.S. Armed Forces to adopt it, in the early/mid-1980s, with the United States Army following suit in 1986.\nModifications to the M16A2 were extensive. In addition to the then new STANAG 4172 5.56\u00d745mm NATO chambering and its accompanying rifling, the barrel was made with a greater thickness in front of the front sight post, ostensibly to resist bending in the field and increase rigidity under sustained fire. The rest of the barrel was maintained at the original thickness for backwards compatibility with the M203 grenade launcher assembly. The barrel rifling was revised to a faster 1:7 (178\u00a0mm) twist rate to adequately stabilize the new 5.56\u00d745mm NATO SS109/M855 ball and L110/M856 tracer ammunition. The heavier longer SS109/M855 bullet reduced muzzle velocity from , to about \nA new adjustable rear sight was added, allowing the rear sight to be dialed in for specific range settings between 300 and 800 meters to take full advantage of the ballistic characteristics of the SS109/M855 rounds, and to allow windage adjustments without the need of a tool or cartridge. The flash suppressor was again modified, this time to be closed on the bottom, so the new birdcage-type muzzle device would not kick up dirt or snow when being fired from the prone position, and additionally act as an asymmetric recoil compensator to reduce muzzle climb.\nA spent case deflector was incorporated into the upper receiver immediately behind the ejection port to prevent (hot) cartridge cases from striking users shooting from the left shoulder. The action was also modified, replacing the original fully automatic setting with a three-round burst setting. When using a fully automatic weapon, inexperienced troops often hold down the trigger and \"spray\" when under fire. The U.S. Army concluded that three-shot groups provide an optimum combination of ammunition conservation, accuracy, and firepower. The number of rounds fired in a burst is determined by a cam mechanism that trips the trigger mechanism for each shot in the burst. For the burst the trigger must be held down for the full duration of the burst. The fire control group will terminate the burst if the trigger is released before the burst is complete but keep the cam in position. Thus, the next time the trigger is pulled, the weapon will only fire one or two rounds. The US Army and USMC have both retired the M16A2, in favor of the newer M4A1 carbine and M16A4 respectively; a few M16A2s remain in service with the U.S. Army Reserve and National Guard.\nThe handguard was modified from the original triangular shape to a round one, which better fit smaller hands and could be retrofitted to older models of the M16. The new handguards were also symmetrical, so armories did not need to stock separate left- and right-hand spares. The handguard retention ring was also tapered to make it easier to install and uninstall the handguards.\nThe new buttstock became ten times stronger than the original due to advances in polymer technology since the early 1960s. Original M16 stocks were made from cellulose-impregnated phenolic resin; the newer M16A2 stocks were engineered from DuPont Zytel glass-filled thermoset polymers and became a replacement part for the preceding M16A1. The new buttstock was lengthened by , and whilst the hinged trapdoor and storage compartment inside the stock was retained, the anti-slip texturing now covers the entire buttplate for better grip on the shoulder.\nThe A2 barrel profile has a greater thickness from the front sight post to the muzzle, after bending in this area was reported in the field. Tests by the M16A2 team showed that this increased the resistance to intentional bending in this area by a factor 9. As to not further increase weight beyond acceptable levels, and to maintain commonality with the M203 grenade launcher, the rear half under the handguard maintained its original thin profile. After the new technical data was submitted, the team discovered that they had made an error in assessing the problem - the replaced bent barrels were not actually bent. When inspecting some using a borescope, they discovered that a burr left from drilling/reaming the gas port was causing copper fouling to build up at the front sight block, interfering with the gauge used. Cleaning this fouling caused the \"bent\" barrels to re-pass inspection. However this discovery came too late in the process to revert the change in profile.\nA notch for the middle finger was added to the pistol grip as well as more aggressive texturing on the sides to enhance the grip, especially while wearing winter gloves. The new pistol grips were engineered from Zytel glass-filled thermoset polymers. The M16A2 pistol grip consequently became a replacement part for the preceding M16A1.\nWhile the standard M16A2 (Model 645 in Colt nomenclature) features a three position safe/semi/three-round burst selective fire control group, there also exists a four position safe/semi/three-round burst/automatic selective trigger pack for the Model 708 version of the rifle named \"M16A2 Enhanced\", used by some international customers like the 32nd Marines Brigade of the Hellenic Army. It can be distinguished from the standard M16A2 by the presence of the enlarged fire selector lever, with a prominent triangular ridge and thumb dowel, as well as corresponding fire position markings on both sides of the receiver.\nM16A3.\nThe M16A3 is a modified version of the M16A2 adopted in small numbers by the U.S. Navy SEALs, Seabees, some US security units, and the Philippine National Police. It features the M16A1 selective fire control group providing \"safe\", \"semi-automatic\" and \"fully automatic\" modes, and type-specific markings on the magazine well. Otherwise, it is externally identical to the M16A2, and should not be conflated with rifles built by armorers using existing full-auto lower receiver assemblies, or M16A1s retrofitted with newer M16A2 furniture.\nM16A4.\nAdopted in July 1997, the M16A4 is the fourth generation of the M16 series. It is equipped with a removable carrying handle and Picatinny rail for mounting optics and other ancillary devices. The M16A4 rear aperture sights are adjustable from up to , where the further similar M16A2 iron sights line can reach up to . The introduction of the Picatinny rail required the use of a higher F-marked front sight base to raise the post. The FN M16A4, with safe/semi/three-round burst selective fire modes, became standard issue for the U.S. Marine Corps.\nColt also produces M16A4 models for international purchases:\nA study of significant changes to Marine M16A4 rifles released in February 2015 outlined several new features that could be added from inexpensive and available components. Those features included: a muzzle compensator in place of the flash suppressor to manage recoil and allow for faster follow-on shots, though at the cost of noise and flash signature and potential overpressure in close quarters; a heavier and/or free-floating barrel to increase accuracy from 4.5 MOA (Minute(s) Of Angle) to potentially 2 MOA; changing the reticle on the Rifle Combat Optic from chevron-shaped to a semi-circular reticle with a dot at the center used in the M27 IAR's Squad Day Optic so as not to obscure the target at long distance; using a trigger group with a more consistent pull force, even a reconsideration of the burst capability; and the addition of ambidextrous charging handles and bolt catch releases for easier use with left-handed shooters.\nIn 2014, Marine units were provided with a limited number of adjustable stocks in place of the traditional fixed stock for their M16A4s to issue to smaller Marines who would have trouble comfortably reaching the trigger when wearing body armor. The adjustable stocks were added as a standard authorized accessory, meaning units can use operations and maintenance funds to purchase more if needed.\nThe Marine Corps had long maintained the full-length M16 as their standard infantry rifle, but in October 2015 the switch to the M4 carbine was approved as the standard-issue weapon, giving Marine infantry a smaller and more compact weapon. Enough M4s were already in the inventory to re-equip all necessary units by September 2016, and all M16A4s were moved to support and non-infantry Marines.\nDerivatives.\nColt Commando (XM177 &amp; GAU-5).\nIn Vietnam, some soldiers were issued a carbine version of the M16 named XM177. The XM177 had a shorter barrel and a telescoping metal stock, which made it substantially lighter and more compact. It also possessed a combination flash hider/sound moderator to reduce the increased muzzle flash and loudened report. The Air Force's GAU-5/A (XM177) and the Army's XM177E1 variants differed over the latter's inclusion of a forward assist, although some GAU-5s do have the forward assist. The final Air Force GAU-5/A and Army XM177E2 had an barrel with a longer flash/sound suppressor. The lengthening of the barrel was to support the attachment of Colt's own XM148 40\u00a0mm grenade launcher. These versions were also known as the Colt Commando model commonly referenced and marketed as the CAR-15. The variants were issued in limited numbers to special forces, helicopter crews, Air Force pilots, Air Force Security Police Military Working Dog (MWD) handlers, officers, radio operators, artillerymen, and troops other than front line riflemen. Some USAF GAU-5A/As were later equipped with even longer 1/12 rifled barrels as the two shorter versions were worn out. The barrel allowed the use of MILES gear and for bayonets to be used with the sub-machine guns (as the Air Force described them). By 1989, the Air Force started to replace the earlier barrels with 1/7 rifled models for use with the M855-round. The weapons were given the redesignation of GUU-5/P.\nThese were used by the British Special Air Service during the Falklands War.\nM4 carbine.\nThe M4 carbine was developed from various outgrowths of these designs, including a number of -barreled A1 style carbines. The XM4 (Colt Model 720) started its trials in 1984, with a new \"stepped\" barrel, case deflector, M16A2 rear sight, and a new elliptical handguard. The weapon became type classified as the \"Carbine, 5.56mm, M4\" in 1991. Officially adopted as a replacement for the M3 \"Grease Gun\" (and the Beretta M9 and M16A2 for select troops) in 1994, it was used with great success in the Balkans and in more recent conflicts, including the Afghanistan and Iraq theaters. The M4 carbine has a three-round burst firing mode, while the M4A1 carbine has a fully automatic firing mode. Both have a Picatinny rail on the upper receiver, allowing the carry handle/rear sight assembly to be replaced with other sighting devices.\nM4 Commando.\nColt also returned to the original \"Commando\" idea, with its Model 733, essentially a simplified XM177E2 with the flash hider/sound moderator deleted and replaced with a normal birdcage-style flash hider. Over the different production runs Colt would assemble the guns with whatever parts were on hand, sometimes leading to the mixing of different M16, M16A1, M16A1E1, and M16A2 features on individual guns.\nM5 carbine.\nThe M5 carbine system was developed by Colt as an improvement on the M4 carbine. It incorporates a fully ambidextrous lower receiver, free-floating barrel and lengthened upper rail. The M5 carbine has four possible barrel lengths: 10.3, 11.5, 14.5 and 16.1 inches. Other M5 variants and calibers are the: M5 SCW (Sub-compact weapon) (5.56\u00d745mm); M5 300 (.300 AAC Blackout); M5 SMG (9\u00d719mm); CMK (7.62\u00d739mm); M7 Battle Rifle (7.62\u00d751mm) and Designated Marksman and Semi-Automatic Sniper System (both 5.56\u00d745mm).\nDiemaco C7 and C8.\nThe Diemaco C7 and C8 are a family of rifles developed concurrently with the M16A2. They are the standard issued rifle for the Canadian Armed Forces, manufactured by Diemaco (currently Colt Canada). The C7 is a branch developed from the experimental M16A1E1. Like earlier M16s, it can be fired in either semi-automatic or automatic mode, instead of the burst function selected for the M16A2. The C7 also features the structural strengthening, improved handguards, and longer stock developed for the M16A2. Diemaco changed the trapdoor in the buttstock to make it easier to access and a spacer of is available to adjust stock length to user preference, along with the addition of hammer-forged barrels. Unlike the American M16A2s, the Diemaco C7s utilize A1 style rear sights. The Canadians originally desired to use a heavy barrel profile instead.\nThe C7 has been developed to the C7A1, with a Weaver rail on the upper receiver for a C79 3.4\u00d728 optical sight, and to the C7A2, with different furniture and internal improvements. The Diemaco produced Weaver rail on the original C7A1 variants does not meet the M1913 \"Picatinny\" standard, leading to some problems with mounting commercial sights. This is easily remedied with minor modification to the upper receiver or the sight itself. Since Diemaco's acquisition by Colt to form Colt Canada, all Canadian produced flattop upper receivers are machined to the M1913 standard.\nThe C8 is the carbine version of the C7. The C7 and C8 are also used by \"H\u00e6rens Jegerkommando\", \"Marinejegerkommandoen\" and FSK (Norway), Denmark's Armed Forces (all branches), and the Netherlands Armed Forces as its main infantry weapon. Following trials, variants became the weapon of choice of the British SAS.\nMk 4 Mod 0.\nThe Mk 4 Mod 0 was a variant of the M16A1 produced for the U.S. Navy SEALs during the Vietnam War and adopted in April 1970. It differed from the basic M16A1 primarily in being optimized for maritime operations and coming equipped with a sound suppressor. Most of the operating parts of the rifle were coated in Kal-Guard lubricant, a hole of was drilled through the stock and buffer tube for drainage, and an O-ring was added to the end of the buffer assembly. The weapon could reportedly be carried to the depth of in water without damage. The initial Mk 2 Mod 0 Blast Suppressor was based on the U.S. Army's Human Engineering Lab's (HEL) M4 noise suppressor. The HEL M4 vented gas directly from the action, requiring a modified bolt carrier. A gas deflector was added to the charging handle to prevent gas from contacting the user. Thus, the HEL M4 suppressor was permanently mounted though it allowed normal semi-automatic and automatic operation. If the HEL M4 suppressor were removed, the weapon would have to be manually cycled after each single shot. On the other hand, the Mk 2 Mod 0 blast suppressor was considered an integral part of the Mk 4 Mod 0 rifle, but it would function normally if the suppressor were removed. The Mk 2 Mod 0 blast suppressor also drained water much more quickly and did not require any modification to the bolt carrier or to the charging handle. In the late 1970s, the Mk 2 Mod 0 blast suppressor was replaced by the Mk 2 blast suppressor made by Knight's Armament Company (KAC). The KAC suppressor can be fully submerged and water will drain out in less than eight seconds. It will operate without degradation even if the rifle is fired at the maximum rate of fire. The U.S. Army replaced the HEL M4 with the much simpler Studies in Operational Negation of Insurgency and Counter-Subversion (SIONICS) MAW-A1 noise and flash suppressor.\nMk 12 Special Purpose Rifle.\nDeveloped to increase the effective range of soldiers in the designated marksman role, the U.S. Navy developed the Mk 12 Special Purpose Rifle (SPR). Configurations in service vary, but the core of the Mk 12 SPR is an 18\" heavy barrel with muzzle brake and free float tube. This tube relieves pressure on the barrel caused by standard handguards and greatly increases the potential accuracy of the system. Also common are higher magnification optics ranging from the 6\u00d7 power Trijicon ACOG to the Leupold Mark 4 Tactical rifle scopes. Firing Mk 262 Mod 0 ammunition with a 77gr Open tip Match bullet, the system has an official effective range of 600+ meters. However, published reports of confirmed kills beyond 800\u00a0m from Iraq and Afghanistan were not uncommon.\nM231 Firing Port Weapon (FPW).\nThe M231 Firing Port Weapon (FPW) is an adapted version of the M16 assault rifle for firing from ports on the M2 Bradley. The infantry's normal M16s are too long for use in a \"buttoned up\" fighting vehicle, so the FPW was developed to provide a suitable weapon for this role.\nColt Model 655 and 656 \"Sniper\" variants.\nWith the expanding Vietnam War, Colt developed two rifles of the M16 pattern for evaluation as possible light sniper or designated marksman rifles. The Colt Model 655 M16A1 Special High Profile was essentially a standard A1 rifle with a heavier barrel and a scope bracket that attached to the rifle's carry handle. The Colt Model 656 M16A1 Special Low Profile had a special upper receiver with no carrying handle. Instead, it had a low-profile iron sight adjustable for windage and a Weaver base for mounting a scope, a precursor to the Colt and Picatinny rails. It also had a hooded front iron sight in addition to the heavy barrel. Both rifles came standard with either a Leatherwood/Realist scope 3\u20139\u00d7 Adjustable Ranging Telescope. Some of them were fitted with a Sionics noise and flash suppressor. Neither of these rifles were ever standardized.\nThese weapons can be seen in many ways to be predecessors of the U.S. Army's SDM-R and the USMC's SAM-R weapons.\nMekut'zrar.\nIsrael was supplied with large numbers of M16A1 rifles by the US Government, many of which were shortened to make them more suitable for urban combat, storage in vehicles, and policing use by shortening them. The 20-inch M16A1 barrel was pruned back to just behind the gas port, while a new gas port was drilled to accommodate a carbine-length gas system as the front sight base was pinned in place. The barrel was also threaded for a standard M16A1 birdcage flash suppressor and the resulting barrel was just shy of 13-inch overall, and a CAR-15 type collapsible buttstock was fitted to replaced the fixed M16A1 fixed buttstock, thus they approximate the size of CAR-15 type carbines. The informal term \"Mekut'zrar\" translates to \"sawed-off\" or \"shorty\".\nProduction and users.\nThe M16 is the most commonly manufactured 5.56\u00d745mm rifle in the world. Currently, the M16 is in use by 15 NATO countries and more than 80 countries worldwide. Together, numerous companies in the United States, Canada, and China have produced more than 8,000,000 rifles of all variants. Approximately 90% are still in operation. The M16 replaced both the M14 rifle and M2 carbine as standard infantry rifle of the U.S. armed forces. Although, the M14 continues to see limited service, mostly in sniper, designated marksman, and ceremonial roles.\nReferences.\nNotes\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nCitations\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Widely regarded as one of the greatest and most influential actors in the history of cinema, Brando received numerous accolades throughout his career, which spanned six decades, including two Academy Awards, two Golden Globe Awards, a Cannes Film Festival Award, three British Academy Film Awards, and an Emmy Award. Brando is credited with being one of the first actors to bring the Stanislavski system of acting and method acting to mainstream audiences.\nBrando came under the influence of Stella Adler and Stanislavski's system in the 1940s. He began his career on stage, where he was lauded for adeptly interpreting his characters. He made his Broadway debut in the play \"I Remember Mama\" (1944) and won Theater World Awards for his roles in the plays \"Candida\" and \"Truckline Cafe\", both in 1946. He returned to Broadway as Stanley Kowalski in the Tennessee Williams play \"A Streetcar Named Desire\" (1947), a role he reprised in the 1951 film adaptation, directed by Elia Kazan.\nHe made his film debut playing a wounded G.I. in \"The Men\" (1950) and won two Academy Awards for Best Actor for his roles as a dockworker in the crime drama film \"On the Waterfront\" (1954) and Vito Corleone in the gangster epic \"The Godfather\" (1972). He was Oscar-nominated for playing Stanley Kowalski in \"A Streetcar Named Desire\" (1951), Emiliano Zapata in \"Viva Zapata!\" (1952), Mark Antony in \"Julius Caesar\" (1953), an air force pilot in \"Sayonara\" (1957), an American expatriate in \"Last Tango in Paris\" (1973), and a lawyer in \"A Dry White Season\" (1989).\nBrando was known for playing characters who later became popular icons, such as the rebellious motorcycle-gang leader Johnny Strabler in \"The Wild One\" (1953), and he came to be seen as an emblem of the era's so-called \"generation gap\", with his portrayal of rebelliousness. He also starred in such films as \"Guys and Dolls\" (1955), \"The Young Lions\" (1958), \"The Fugitive Kind\" (1960), \"The Chase\" (1966), \"Burn!\" (1969), \"The Missouri Breaks\" (1976), \"Superman\" (1978), \"Apocalypse Now\" (1979), and \"The Freshman\" (1990). He made his directorial film debut with, and also starred in, the western drama \"One-Eyed Jacks\" (1961), which did poorly at the box office.\nOn television, Brando won the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Limited Series or Movie for his role in the ABC miniseries \"\" (1979), after which he took a nine-year hiatus from acting. He later returned to film, with varying degrees of commercial and critical success. The last two decades of his life were marked by controversy, and his troubled private life received significant public attention. He struggled with mood disorders and legal issues. His last films include \"The Island of Dr. Moreau\" (1996) and \"The Score\" (2001).\nEarly life and education.\nMarlon Brando Jr. was born on April 3, 1924, in Omaha, Nebraska, as the only son of Marlon Brando Sr. and Dorothy Pennebaker. His father was a salesman who often travelled out-of-state and his mother was a stage actress, often away from home. His mother's absence resulted in Brando becoming attached to the family's housekeeper, who eventually left to get married, causing Brando to develop abandonment issues. His two elder sisters were Jocelyn and Frances.\nDespite some of his most notable film roles, Brando did not have Italian ancestry. Brando's ancestry was mostly German, Dutch, English, and Irish. His patrilineal immigrant ancestor, Johann Wilhelm Brandau, arrived in New York City in the early 1700s from the Palatinate in Germany. He was also a descendant of Louis DuBois, a French Huguenot, who arrived in New York around 1660. His maternal great-grandfather, Myles Joseph Gahan, was an Irish immigrant who served as a medic in the American Civil War. In 1995, he gave an interview in Ireland in which he said, \"I have never been so happy in my life. When I got off the plane I had this rush of emotion. I have never felt at home in a place as I do here. I am seriously contemplating Irish citizenship.\"\nIn 1930, when Brando was only six years old, the family moved to Evanston, Illinois, where Brando mimicked other people, developed a reputation for pranking, and met Wally Cox, with whom he remained friends until Cox's death in 1973. In 1936, his parents separated and he and his siblings moved with their mother to Santa Ana, California. Two years later, his parents reconciled, and his father purchased a farmhouse in Libertyville, Illinois. Brando attended Libertyville High School, excelling at sports and drama, but failing in every other subject. Consequently, he was held back for a year, and with his history of misbehaving, he was expelled in 1941.\nBrando was sent by his father to Shattuck Military Academy, where his father had also studied. There, Brando continued to excel at acting until 1943, when he was put on probation for being insubordinate to an officer during maneuvers. He was confined to the campus, but sneaked into town and was caught. The faculty voted to expel him, although he was supported by the students who thought expulsion was too harsh. Brando was invited back for the following year, but decided instead to drop out of high school. He then worked as a ditch-digger at a summer job arranged by his father and tried to enlist in the Army, but his routine physical revealed that a football injury he had sustained at Shattuck had left him with a trick knee; he was classified physically unfit for military service.\nBrando decided to follow his sisters to New York, studying at the American Theatre Wing Professional School, part of the Dramatic Workshop of the New School, with influential German director Erwin Piscator. In a 1988 documentary, \"Marlon Brando: The Wild One\", Brando's sister Jocelyn remembered, \"He was in a school play and enjoyed it\u00a0... So he decided he would go to New York and study acting because that was the only thing he had enjoyed. That was when he was 18.\" In the A&amp;E \"Biography\" episode on Brando, George Englund said Brando fell into acting in New York because \"he was accepted there. He wasn't criticized. It was the first time in his life that he heard good things about himself.\" He spent his first few months in New York sleeping on friends' couches. For a time he lived with Roy Somlyo, who later became a four-time Emmy-winning Broadway producer.\nBrando was an avid student and proponent of Stella Adler, from whom he learned the techniques of the Stanislavski system. This technique encouraged the actor to explore both internal and external aspects to fully realize the character being portrayed. Brando's remarkable insight and sense of realism were evident early on. Adler used to recount that, when teaching Brando, she had instructed the class to act like chickens, and added that a nuclear bomb was about to fall on them. Most of the class clucked and ran around wildly, but Brando sat calmly and pretended to lay an egg. Asked by Adler why he had chosen to react this way, he said, \"I'm a chicken\u2014what do I know about bombs?\" Despite being commonly regarded as a method actor, Brando disagreed. He claimed to have abhorred Lee Strasberg's teachings:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;After I had some success, Lee Strasberg tried to take credit for teaching me how to act. He never taught me anything. He would have claimed credit for the sun and the moon if he believed he could get away with it. He was an ambitious, selfish man who exploited the people who attended the Actors Studio and tried to project himself as an acting oracle and guru. Some people worshipped him, but I never knew why. I sometimes went to the Actors Studio on Saturday mornings because Elia Kazan was teaching, and there were usually a lot of good-looking girls, but Strasberg never taught me acting. Stella (Adler) did\u2014and later Kazan.\nBrando was the first to bring a natural approach to acting on film. According to Dustin Hoffman in his online Masterclass, Brando would often talk to cameramen and fellow actors about their weekend even after the director would call action. Once Brando felt he could deliver the dialogue as naturally as that conversation, he would start the dialogue. In his 2015 documentary, \"Listen to Me Marlon\", he said that prior to that, actors were like breakfast cereals, meaning they were predictable. Critics would later say that this was Brando being difficult, but actors who worked opposite him said it was just all part of his technique.\nCareer.\n1944\u20131950: Early career.\nBrando used his Stanislavski System skills for his first summer stock roles in Sayville, New York, on Long Island. Brando established a pattern of erratic, insubordinate behavior in the few shows he had been in. His behavior had him kicked out of the cast of the New School's production in Sayville, but he was soon afterwards discovered in a locally produced play there. Then, in 1944, he made it to Broadway in the bittersweet drama \"I Remember Mama\", playing the son of Mady Christians. The Lunts wanted Brando to play the role of Alfred Lunt's son in \"O Mistress Mine\", and Lunt even coached him for the audition, but Brando made no attempt to even read his lines at the audition and was not hired. New York Drama Critics voted him \"Most Promising Young Actor\" for his role as an anguished veteran in \"Truckline Caf\u00e9\", although the play was a commercial failure. In 1946, he appeared on Broadway as the young hero in the political drama \"A Flag Is Born\", refusing to accept wages above the Actors' Equity rate. In that same year, Brando played the role of Marchbanks alongside Katharine Cornell in her production's revival of \"Candida\", one of her signature roles. Cornell also cast him as the Messenger in her production of Jean Anouilh's \"Antigone\" that same year. He was also offered the opportunity to portray one of the principal characters in the Broadway premiere of Eugene O'Neill's \"The Iceman Cometh\", but turned the part down after falling asleep while trying to read the massive script and pronouncing the play \"ineptly written and poorly constructed\".\nIn 1945, Brando's agent recommended he take a co-starring role in \"The Eagle Has Two Heads\" with Tallulah Bankhead, produced by Jack Wilson. Bankhead had turned down the role of Blanche Dubois in \"A Streetcar Named Desire\", which Williams had written for her, to tour the play for the 1946\u20131947 season. Bankhead recognized Brando's potential, despite her disdain (which most Broadway veterans shared) for method acting, and agreed to hire him even though he auditioned poorly. The two clashed greatly during the pre-Broadway tour, with Bankhead reminding Brando of his mother, being her age and also having a drinking problem. Wilson was largely tolerant of Brando's behavior, but he reached his limit when Brando mumbled through a dress rehearsal shortly before the November 28, 1946, opening. \"I don't care what your grandmother did,\" Wilson exclaimed, \"and that Method stuff, I want to know what you're going to do!\" Brando in turn raised his voice, and acted with great power and passion. \"It was marvelous,\" a cast member recalled. \"Everybody hugged him and kissed him. He came ambling offstage and said to me, 'They don't think you can act unless you can yell.'\"\nCritics were not as kind, however. A review of Brando's performance in the opening assessed that Brando was \"still building his character, but at present fails to impress.\" One Boston critic remarked of Brando's prolonged death scene, \"Brando looked like a car in midtown Manhattan searching for a parking space.\" He received better reviews at subsequent tour stops, but what his colleagues recalled was only occasional indications of the talent he would later demonstrate. \"There were a few times when he was really magnificent,\" Bankhead admitted to an interviewer in 1962. \"He was a great young actor when he wanted to be, but most of the time I couldn't even hear him on the stage.\"\nBrando displayed his apathy for the production by demonstrating some shocking onstage manners. He \"tried everything in the world to ruin it for her,\" Bankhead's stage manager claimed. \"He nearly drove her crazy: scratching his crotch, picking his nose, doing anything.\" After several weeks on the road, they reached Boston, by which time Bankhead was ready to dismiss him. This proved to be one of the greatest blessings of his career, as it freed him up to play the role of Stanley Kowalski in Tennessee Williams' 1947 play \"A Streetcar Named Desire\", directed by Elia Kazan. Moreover, to that end, Bankhead herself, in her letter declining Williams' invitation to play the role of Blanche, gave Brando this ringing\u2014albeit acid-tongued\u2014endorsement stating \"I do have one suggestion for casting. I know of an actor who can appear as this brutish Stanley Kowalski character. I mean, a total pig of a man without sensitivity or grace of any kind. Marlon Brando would be perfect as Stanley. I have just fired the cad from my play, The Eagle Has Two Heads, and I know for a fact that he is looking for work\".\nPierpont writes that John Garfield was first choice for the role, but \"made impossible demands.\" It was Kazan's decision to fall back on the far less experienced (and technically too young for the role) Brando. In a letter dated August 29, 1947, Williams confided to his agent Audrey Wood: \"It had not occurred to me before what an excellent value would come through casting a very young actor in this part. It humanizes the character of Stanley in that it becomes the brutality and callousness of youth rather than a vicious old man\u00a0... A new value came out of Brando's reading which was by far the best reading I have ever heard.\" Brando based his portrayal of Kowalski on the boxer Rocky Graziano, whom he had studied at a local gymnasium. Graziano did not know who Brando was, but attended the production with tickets provided by the young man. He said, \"The curtain went up and on the stage is that son of a bitch from the gym, and he's playing me.\"\nIn 1947, Brando performed a screen test for an early Warner Brothers script for the novel \"Rebel Without a Cause\" (1944), which bore no relation to the film eventually produced in 1955. The screen test is included as an extra in the 2006 DVD release of \"A Streetcar Named Desire\". Brando's first screen role was a bitter paraplegic veteran in \"The Men\" (1950). He spent a month in bed at the Birmingham Army Hospital in Van Nuys to prepare for the role. \"The New York Times\" reviewer Bosley Crowther wrote that Brando as Ken \"is so vividly real, dynamic and sensitive that his illusion is complete\" and noted, \"Out of stiff and frozen silences he can lash into a passionate rage with the tearful and flailing frenzy of a taut cable suddenly cut.\"\nBy Brando's own account, it may have been because of this film that his draft status was changed from 4-F to 1-A. He had had surgery on his trick knee, and it was no longer physically debilitating enough to incur exclusion from the draft. When Brando reported to the induction center, he answered a questionnaire by saying his race was \"human\", his color was \"Seasonal-oyster white to beige\", and he told an Army doctor that he was psychoneurotic. When the draft board referred him to a psychiatrist, Brando explained that he had been expelled from military school and had severe problems with authority. Coincidentally, the psychiatrist knew a doctor friend of Brando. Brando avoided military service during the Korean War.\nEarly in his career, Brando began using cue cards instead of memorizing his lines. Despite the objections of several of the film directors he worked with, Brando felt that this helped bring realism and spontaneity to his performances. He felt otherwise he would appear to be reciting a writer's speech. In the TV documentary \"The Making of Superman: The Movie\", Brando explained: \"If you don't know what the words are but you have a general idea of what they are, then you look at the cue card and it gives you the feeling to the viewer, hopefully, that the person is really searching for what he is going to say\u2014that he doesn't know what to say\". Some, however, thought Brando used the cards out of laziness or an inability to memorize his lines. Once, on the set of \"The Godfather\", Brando was asked why he wanted his lines printed out. He responded: \"Because I can read them that way.\"\n1951\u20131954: Stardom and \"On the Waterfront\".\nBrando brought his performance as Stanley Kowalski to the screen in Tennessee Williams' \"A Streetcar Named Desire\" (1951). It earned him his first Academy Award nomination in the Best Actor category. The role is regarded as one of Brando's greatest.\nHe was also nominated the next year for \"Viva Zapata!\" (1952), a fictionalized account of the life of Mexican revolutionary Emiliano Zapata. The film recounted Zapata's lower-class upbringing, his rise to power in the early 20th century, and death. The film was directed by Elia Kazan and co-starred Anthony Quinn. In the biopic \"Marlon Brando: The Wild One\", Sam Shaw says: \"Secretly, before the picture started, he went to Mexico to the very town where Zapata lived and was born in and it was there that he studied the speech patterns of people, their behavior, movement.\" Most critics focused on the actor rather than the film, with \"Time\" and \"Newsweek\" publishing rave reviews.\nYears later, in his autobiography, Brando remarked: \"Tony Quinn, whom I admired professionally and liked personally, played my brother, but he was extremely cold to me while we shot that picture. During our scenes together, I sensed a bitterness toward me, and if I suggested a drink after work, he either turned me down or else was sullen and said little. Only years later did I learn why.\" Brando explained that, to create on-screen tension between the two, \"Gadg\" (Kazan) had told Quinn \u2013 who had taken over the role of Stanley Kowalski from Brando on Broadway \u2013 that Brando had been unimpressed with his work. After achieving the desired effect, Kazan never told Quinn that he had misled him. It was only many years later, after comparing notes, that Brando and Quinn realized the deception.\nBrando's next film, \"Julius Caesar\" (1953), received highly favorable reviews. Brando portrayed Mark Antony. While most acknowledged Brando's talent, some critics felt Brando's \"mumbling\" and other idiosyncrasies betrayed a lack of acting fundamentals and, when his casting was announced, many remained dubious about his prospects for success. Directed by Joseph L. Mankiewicz and co-starring British stage actor John Gielgud, Brando delivered an impressive performance, especially during Antony's noted \"Friends, Romans, countrymen\u00a0...\" speech. Gielgud was so impressed that he offered Brando a full season at the Hammersmith Theatre, an offer he declined. In his biography on the actor, Stefan Kanfer writes, \"Marlon's autobiography devotes one line to his work on that film: Among all those British professionals, 'for me to walk onto a movie set and play Mark Anthony was asinine'\u2014yet another example of his persistent self-denigration, and wholly incorrect.\"\nKanfer adds that after a screening of the film, director John Huston commented: \"Christ! It was like a furnace door opening\u2014the heat came off the screen. I don't know another actor who could do that.\" During the filming of \"Julius Caesar\", Brando learned that Elia Kazan had cooperated with congressional investigators, naming a whole string of \"subversives\" to the House Committee on Un-American Activities (HUAC). By all accounts, Brando was upset by his mentor's decision, but he worked with him again in \"On The Waterfront\". \"None of us is perfect,\" he later wrote in his memoir, \"and I think that Gadg has done injury to others, but mostly to himself.\"\nIn 1953, Brando also starred in \"The Wild One\", riding his own Triumph Thunderbird 6T motorcycle. Triumph's importers were ambivalent at the exposure, as the subject matter was rowdy motorcycle gangs taking over a small town. The film was criticized for its perceived gratuitous violence at the time, with \"Time\" stating: \"The effect of the movie is not to throw light on the public problem, but to shoot adrenaline through the moviegoer's veins.\" Brando allegedly did not see eye to eye with the Hungarian director L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Benedek and did not get on with costar Lee Marvin.\nTo Brando's expressed puzzlement, the movie inspired teen rebellion and made him a role model to the nascent rock-and-roll generation and future stars such as James Dean and Elvis Presley. After the movie's release, the sales of leather jackets and motorcycles skyrocketed. Reflecting on the movie in his autobiography, Brando concluded that it had not aged very well but said \"More than most parts I've played in the movies or onstage, I related to Johnny, and because of this, I believe I played him as more sensitive and sympathetic than the script envisioned. There's a line in the picture where he snarls, 'Nobody tells me what to do.' That's exactly how I've felt all my life.\"\nLater that same year, Brando co-starred with fellow Studio member William Redfield in a summer stock production of George Bernard Shaw's \"Arms and the Man\".\nIn 1954, Brando starred in \"On the Waterfront\", a crime drama film about union violence and corruption among longshoremen. The film was directed by Elia Kazan and written by Budd Schulberg; it also starred Karl Malden, Lee J. Cobb, Rod Steiger and, in her film debut, Eva Marie Saint. When initially offered the role, Brando\u2014still stung by Kazan's testimony to HUAC\u2014demurred and the part of Terry Malloy nearly went to Frank Sinatra. According to biographer Stefan Kanfer, the director believed that Sinatra, who grew up in Hoboken (where the film takes place and was shot), would work as Malloy, but eventually producer Sam Spiegel wooed Brando to the part, signing him for $100,000. \"Kazan made no protest because, he subsequently confessed, 'I always preferred Brando to anybody.'\"\nBrando won the Oscar for his role as Irish-American stevedore Terry Malloy in \"On the Waterfront\". His performance, spurred on by his rapport with Eva Marie Saint and Kazan's direction, was praised as a \"tour de force\". For the scene in which Terry laments his failings, saying \"I coulda been a contender\", he convinced Kazan that the scripted scene was unrealistic. Schulberg's script had Brando acting the entire scene with his character being held at gunpoint by his brother Charlie, played by Rod Steiger. Brando insisted on gently pushing away the gun, saying that Terry would never believe that his brother would pull the trigger and doubting that he could continue his speech while fearing a gun on him. Kazan let Brando improvise and later expressed deep admiration for Brando's instinctive understanding, saying:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;what was extraordinary about his performance, I feel, is the contrast of the tough-guy front and the extreme delicacy and gentle cast of his behavior. What other actor, when his brother draws a pistol to force him to do something shameful, would put his hand on the gun and push it away with the gentleness of a caress? Who else could read \"Oh, Charlie!\" in a tone of reproach that is so loving and so melancholy and suggests the terrific depth of pain?\u00a0\u2026 If there is a better performance by a man in the history of film in America, I don't know what it is.\nUpon its release, \"On the Waterfront\" received glowing reviews from critics and was a commercial success, earning an estimated $4.2\u00a0million in rentals at the North American box office in 1954. In his July 29, 1954, review, \"The New York Times\" critic A. H. Weiler praised the film, calling it \"an uncommonly powerful, exciting, and imaginative use of the screen by gifted professionals.\" Film critic Roger Ebert lauded the film retrospectively, stating that Brando and Kazan changed acting in American films forever and adding it to his \"Great Movies\" list. In his autobiography, Brando was typically dismissive of his performance: \"On the day Gadg showed me the complete picture, I was so depressed by my performance I got up and left the screening room\u00a0... I thought I was a huge failure.\" After Brando won the Academy Award for Best Actor, the statue was stolen. Much later, it turned up at a London auction house, which contacted the actor and informed him of its whereabouts.\n1954\u20131959: Box office success.\nBrando was in the film adaptation of the musical \"Guys and Dolls\" (1955). \"Guys and Dolls\" would be Brando's first and last musical role. \"Time\" found the picture \"false to the original in its feeling\", remarking that Brando \"sings in a faraway tenor that sometimes tends to be flat\". Appearing in Edward Murrow's \"Person to Person\" interview in early 1955, he admitted to having problems with his singing voice, which he called \"pretty terrible\". In the 1965 documentary \"Meet Marlon Brando\", he revealed that the final product heard in the movie was a result of countless singing takes being cut into one and later joked, \"I couldn't hit a note with a baseball bat; some notes I missed by extraordinary margins\u00a0... They sewed my words together on one song so tightly that when I mouthed it in front of the camera, I nearly asphyxiated myself\". Relations between Brando and costar Frank Sinatra were also frosty, with Stefan Kanfer observing: \"The two men were diametrical opposites: Marlon required multiple takes; Frank detested repeating himself.\" Upon their first meeting Sinatra reportedly scoffed, \"Don't give me any of that Actors Studio shit.\" Brando later quipped, \"Frank is the kind of guy, when he dies, he's going to heaven and give God a hard time for making him bald.\" Frank Sinatra called Brando \"the world's most overrated actor\", and referred to him as \"mumbles\". The film was commercially though not critically successful, costing $5.5\u00a0million to make and grossing $13\u00a0million.\nBrando played Sakini, a Japanese interpreter for the U.S. Army in postwar Japan, in \"The Teahouse of the August Moon\" (1956). Pauline Kael was not particularly impressed by the movie, but noted \"Marlon Brando starved himself to play the pixie interpreter Sakini, and he looks as if he's enjoying the stunt\u2014talking with a mad accent, grinning boyishly, bending forward, and doing tricky movements with his legs. He's harmlessly genial (and he is certainly missed when he's offscreen), though the fey, roguish role doesn't allow him to do what he's great at and it's possible that he's less effective in it than a lesser actor might have been.\"\nIn \"Sayonara\" (1957), Brando appeared as a United States Air Force officer. \"Newsweek\" found the film a \"dull tale of the meeting of the twain\", but it was nevertheless a box-office success. According to Stefan Kanfer's biography of the actor, Brando's manager Jay Kanter negotiated a profitable contract with ten percent of the gross going to Brando, which put him in the millionaire category. The movie was controversial due to openly discussing interracial marriage, but proved a great success, earning 10 Academy Award nominations, with Brando being nominated for Best Actor. The film went on to win four Academy Awards. \"Teahouse\" and \"Sayonara\" were the first in a string of films Brando would strive to make over the next decade which contained socially relevant messages, and he formed a partnership with Paramount to establish his own production company called Pennebaker, its declared purpose to develop films that contained \"social value that would improve the world.\" The name was a tribute in honor of his mother, who had died in 1954. By all accounts, Brando was devastated by her death, with biographer Peter Manso telling A&amp;E's \"Biography\", \"She was the one who could give him approval like no one else could and, after his mother died, it seems that Marlon stops caring.\" Brando appointed his father to run Pennebaker. In the same A&amp;E special, George Englund claims that Brando gave his father the job because \"it gave Marlon a chance to take shots at him, to demean and diminish him\".\nIn 1958, Brando appeared in \"The Young Lions\", dyeing his hair blonde and assuming a German accent for the role, which he later admitted was not convincing. The film is based on the novel by Irwin Shaw, and Brando's portrayal of the character Christian Diestl was controversial for its time. He later wrote, \"The original script closely followed the book, in which Shaw painted all Germans as evil caricatures, especially Christian, whom he portrayed as a symbol of everything that was bad about Nazism; he was mean, nasty, vicious, a clich\u00e9 of evil\u00a0... I thought the story should demonstrate that there are no inherently 'bad' people in the world, but they can easily be misled.\" Shaw and Brando even appeared together for a televised interview with CBS correspondent David Schoenbrun and, during a bombastic exchange, Shaw charged that, like most actors, Brando was incapable of playing flat-out villainy; Brando responded by stating \"Nobody creates a character but an actor. I play the role; now he exists. He is my creation.\" \"The Young Lions\" also features Brando's only appearance in a film with friend and rival Montgomery Clift (although they shared no scenes together). Brando closed out the decade by appearing in \"The Fugitive Kind\" (1960) opposite Anna Magnani. The film was based on another play by Tennessee Williams but was hardly the success \"A Streetcar Named Desire\" had been, with the \"Los Angeles Times\" labeling Williams' personae \"psychologically sick or just plain ugly\" and \"The New Yorker\" calling it a \"cornpone melodrama\".\n1961\u20131971: Established actor.\nIn 1961, Brando made his directorial debut in the western \"One-Eyed Jacks\". The picture was originally directed by Stanley Kubrick, but he was fired early in the production. Paramount then made Brando the director. Brando portrays the lead character Rio, and Karl Malden plays his partner \"Dad\" Longworth. The supporting cast features Katy Jurado, Ben Johnson, and Slim Pickens. Brando's penchant for multiple retakes and character exploration as an actor carried over into his directing, however, and the film soon went over budget; Paramount expected the film to take three months to complete but shooting stretched to six and the cost doubled to more than six million dollars. Brando's inexperience as an editor also delayed postproduction and Paramount eventually took control of the film. Brando later wrote, \"Paramount said it didn't like my version of the story; I'd had everyone lie except Karl Malden. The studio cut the movie to pieces and made him a liar, too. By then, I was bored with the whole project and walked away from it\". \"One-Eyed Jacks\" was received with mixed reviews by critics.\nBrando's revulsion with the film industry reportedly boiled over on the set of his next film, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer's remake of \"Mutiny on the Bounty\", which was filmed in Tahiti. The actor was accused of deliberately sabotaging nearly every aspect of the production. On June 16, 1962, \"The Saturday Evening Post\" ran an article by Bill Davidson with the headline \"Six million dollars down the drain: the mutiny of Marlon Brando\". \"Mutiny\" director Lewis Milestone claimed that the executives \"deserve what they get when they give a ham actor, a petulant child, complete control over an expensive picture.\" \" Mutiny on the Bounty\" nearly capsized MGM and, while the project had indeed been hampered with delays other than Brando's behavior, the accusations would dog the actor for years as studios began to fear Brando's difficult reputation. Critics also began taking note of his fluctuating weight.\nDistracted by his personal life and becoming disillusioned with his career, Brando began to view acting as a means to a financial end. Critics protested when he started accepting roles in films many perceived as being beneath his talent, or criticized him for failing to live up to the better roles. Previously only signing short-term deals with film studios, in 1961 Brando uncharacteristically signed a five-picture deal with Universal Studios that would haunt him for the rest of the decade. \"The Ugly American\" (1963) was the first of these films. Based on the 1958 novel of the same title that Pennebaker had optioned, the film, which featured Brando's sister Jocelyn, was rated fairly positively but died at the box office. Brando was nominated for a Golden Globe for his performance. All of Brando's other Universal films during this period, including \"Bedtime Story\" (1964), \"The Appaloosa\" (1966), \"A Countess from Hong Kong\" (1967) and \"The Night of the Following Day\" (1969), were also critical and commercial flops. \"Countess\" in particular was a disappointment for Brando, who had looked forward to working with one of his heroes, director Charlie Chaplin. The experience turned out to be an unhappy one; Brando was horrified at Chaplin's didactic style of direction and his authoritarian approach. Brando had also appeared in the spy thriller \"Morituri\" in 1965; that, too, failed to attract an audience.\nBrando acknowledged his professional decline, writing later, \"Some of the films I made during the sixties were successful; some weren't. Some, like \"The Night of the Following Day\", I made only for the money; others, like \"Candy\", I did because a friend asked me to and I didn't want to turn him down\u00a0... In some ways I think of my middle age as the Fuck You Years.\" \"Candy\" was especially appalling for many; a 1968 sex farce film directed by Christian Marquand and based on the 1958 novel by Terry Southern, the film satirizes pornographic stories through the adventures of its naive heroine, Candy, played by Ewa Aulin. It is generally regarded as the nadir of Brando's career. \"The Washington Post\" observed: \"Brando's self-indulgence over a dozen years is costing him and his public his talents.\" In the March 1966 issue of \"The Atlantic\", Pauline Kael wrote that in his rebellious days, Brando \"was antisocial because he knew society was crap; he was a hero to youth because he was strong enough not to take the crap\", but now Brando and others like him had become \"buffoons, shamelessly, pathetically mocking their public reputations.\" In an earlier review of \"The Appaloosa\" in 1966, Kael wrote that the actor was \"trapped in another dog of a movie\u00a0... Not for the first time, Mr. Brando gives us a heavy-lidded, adenoidally openmouthed caricature of the inarticulate, stalwart loner.\" Although he feigned indifference, Brando was hurt by the critical mauling, admitting in the 2015 film \"Listen to Me Marlon\", \"They can hit you every day and you have no way of fighting back. I was very convincing in my pose of indifference, but I was very sensitive and it hurt a lot.\"\nBrando portrayed a repressed gay army officer in \"Reflections in a Golden Eye\", directed by John Huston and co-starring Elizabeth Taylor. The role turned out as one of his most acclaimed in years, with Stanley Crouch marveling, \"Brando's main achievement was to portray the taciturn but stoic gloom of those pulverized by circumstances.\" The film overall received mixed reviews. Another notable film was \"The Chase\" (1966), which paired the actor with director Arthur Penn, Jane Fonda, Robert Redford and Robert Duvall. The film deals with themes of racism, sexual revolution, small-town corruption, and vigilantism. The film was received mostly positively.\nBrando cited \"Burn!\" (1969) as his personal favorite of the films he had made, writing in his autobiography: \"I think I did some of the best acting I've ever done in that picture, but few people came to see it.\" Brando dedicated a full chapter to the film in his memoir, stating that the director, Gillo Pontecorvo, was the best director he had ever worked with next to Kazan and Bernardo Bertolucci. Brando also detailed his clashes with Pontecorvo on the set and how \"we nearly killed each other.\" Loosely based on events in the history of Guadeloupe, the film got a hostile reception from critics. In 1971, Michael Winner directed him in the British horror film \"The Nightcomers\" with Stephanie Beacham, Thora Hird, Harry Andrews and Anna Palk. It is a prequel to \"The Turn of the Screw\", which had previously been filmed as \"The Innocents\" (1961). Brando's performance earned him a nomination for a Best Actor BAFTA, but the film bombed at the box office.\n1970\u20131979: Career resurgence and acclaim.\nDuring the 1970s, Brando was considered \"unbankable\". Critics were becoming increasingly dismissive of his work and he had not appeared in a box office hit since \"The Young Lions\" in 1958, the last year he had ranked as one of the Top Ten Box Office Stars and the year of his last Academy Award nomination, for \"Sayonara.\" Brando's performance as Vito Corleone, the \"Don\", in \"The Godfather\" (1972), Francis Ford Coppola's adaptation of Mario Puzo's 1969 bestselling novel of the same name, was a career turning point, putting him back in the Top Ten and winning him his second Best Actor Oscar.\nParamount production chief Robert Evans, who had given Puzo an advance to write \"The Godfather\" so that Paramount would own the film rights, hired Coppola after many major directors had turned the film down. Evans wanted an Italian-American director who could provide the film with cultural authenticity. Coppola also came cheap. Evans was conscious of the fact that Paramount's last Mafia film, \"The Brotherhood\" (1968) had been a box office bomb, and he believed it was partly due to the fact that the director, Martin Ritt, and the star, Kirk Douglas, were Jewish, and the film lacked an authentic Italian flavor. The studio originally intended the film to be a low-budget production set in contemporary times without any major actors, but the phenomenal success of the novel gave Evans the clout to turn \"The Godfather\" into a prestige picture.\nCoppola had developed a list of actors for all the roles, and his list of potential Dons included the Oscar-winning Italian-American Ernest Borgnine, the Italian-American Frank de Kova (best known for playing Chief Wild Eagle on the TV sitcom \"F-Troop\"), John Marley (a Best Supporting Oscar-nominee for Paramount's 1970 hit film \"Love Story\" who was cast as the film producer Jack Woltz in the picture), the Italian-American Richard Conte (who was cast as Don Corleone's deadly rival Don Emilio Barzini), and Italian film producer Carlo Ponti. Coppola admitted in a 1975 interview, \"We finally figured we had to lure the \"best\" actor in the world. It was that simple. That boiled down to Laurence Olivier or Marlon Brando, who \"are\" the greatest actors in the world.\" Coppola's hand-written cast list has Brando's name underlined.\nEvans told Coppola that he had been thinking of Brando for the part two years earlier, and Puzo had imagined Brando in the part when he wrote the novel and had actually written to him about the part, so Coppola and Evans narrowed it down to Brando. (Coincidentally, Olivier would compete with Brando for the Best Actor Oscar for his part in \"Sleuth.\" He bested Brando at the 1972 New York Film Critics Circle Awards.) Albert S. Ruddy, whom Paramount assigned to produce the film, agreed with the choice of Brando. However, Paramount studio executives were opposed to casting Brando, due to his reputation for difficulty and his long string of box office flops. Brando also had \"One-Eyed Jacks\" working against him, a troubled production that lost money for Paramount when it was released in 1961. Paramount Pictures President Stanley Jaffe told an exasperated Coppola \"As long as I'm president of this studio, Marlon Brando will not be in this picture, and I will no longer allow you to discuss it.\"\nJaffe eventually set three conditions for the casting of Brando: That he would have to take a fee far below what he typically received; he would have to agree to accept financial responsibility for any production delays his behavior cost; and he had to submit to a screen test. Coppola convinced Brando to do a videotaped \"make-up\" test, in which Brando did his own makeup (he used cotton balls to simulate the character's puffed cheeks). Coppola had feared Brando might be too young to play the Don, but was electrified by the actor's characterization as the head of a crime family. Even so, he had to fight the studio in order to cast the temperamental actor. Brando had doubts himself, stating in his autobiography, \"I had never played an Italian before, and I didn't think I could do it successfully.\" Eventually, Charles Bluhdorn, the president of Paramount parent Gulf+Western, was won over to letting Brando have the role; when he saw the screen test, he asked in amazement, \"What are we watching? Who is this old guinea?\" Brando was signed for a low fee of $50,000, but in his contract, he was given a percentage of the gross on a sliding scale: 1% of the gross for each $10\u00a0million over a $10\u00a0million threshold, up to 5% if the picture exceeded $60\u00a0million. According to Evans, Brando sold back his points in the picture for $100,000 because he was in dire need of funds. \"That $100,000 cost him $11\u00a0million,\" Evans claimed.\nBrando was on his best behavior during filming, buoyed by a cast that included rising stars Al Pacino, Robert Duvall, James Caan, and Diane Keaton. As the most seasoned actor on set, he wielded his influence to support the creatives on the project, serving as the \"head of the family\" much like his role in the film. In a 1994 interview, Coppola insisted \"The Godfather\" was \"a very unappreciated movie when we were making it. They were very unhappy with it. They didn't like the cast. They didn't like the way I was shooting it. I was always on the verge of getting fired.\" When word of this executive interference reached Brando, he threatened to walk off the picture, writing in his memoir: \"I strongly believe that directors are entitled to independence and freedom to realize their vision.\" Similarly, in a 2010 interview, Al Pacino discussed how Brando's support helped him keep the role of Michael Corleone in the movie, despite the fact Coppola wanted to fire him due to pressure from studio executives who were puzzled by Pacino's performance.\nBrando's performance was glowingly reviewed by critics. \"I thought it would be interesting to play a gangster, maybe for the first time in the movies, who wasn't like those bad guys Edward G. Robinson played, but who is kind of a hero, a man to be respected,\" Brando recalled in his autobiography. \"Also, because he had so much power and unquestioned authority, I thought it would be an interesting contrast to play him as a gentle man, unlike Al Capone, who beat up people with baseball bats.\" Duvall later marveled to A&amp;E's \"Biography\", \"He minimized the sense of beginning. In other words he, like, deemphasized the word \"action\". He would go in front of that camera just like he was before. \"Cut!\" It was all the same. There was really no beginning. I learned a lot from watching that.\" Brando won the Academy Award for Best Actor for his performance, but he declined it, becoming the second actor to refuse a Best Actor award (after George C. Scott for \"Patton\"). Brando did not attend the award ceremony; instead, he sent actress Sacheen Littlefeather (who appeared in Plains Indian-style regalia) to decline the Oscar on his behalf. After refusing to touch the statue at the podium, she announced to the crowd that Brando was rejecting the award in protest of \"the treatment of American Indians today by the film industry ... and on television and movie reruns and also with recent happenings at Wounded Knee.\" The Wounded Knee Occupation of 1973 was occurring at the time of the ceremony. Brando had written a longer speech for her to read but, as she explained, this was not permitted due to time constraints. In the written speech Brando added that he hoped his declining the Oscar would be seen as \"an earnest effort to focus attention on an issue that might very well determine whether or not this country has the right to say from this point forward we believe in the inalienable rights of all people to remain free and independent on lands that have supported their life beyond living memory.\"\nThe actor followed \"The Godfather\" with Bernardo Bertolucci's 1972 film \"Last Tango in Paris\", playing opposite Maria Schneider, but Brando's highly noted performance threatened to be overshadowed by an uproar over the sexual content of the film. Brando portrays a recent American widower named Paul, who begins an anonymous sexual relationship with a young, betrothed Parisian woman named Jeanne. As with previous films, Brando refused to memorize his lines for many scenes; instead, he wrote his lines on cue cards and posted them around the set for easy reference, leaving Bertolucci with the problem of keeping them out of the picture frame. The film features several intense, graphic scenes involving Brando, including Paul anally raping Jeanne using butter as a lubricant, which it was alleged was not consensual. The actress confirmed that no actual sex occurred, but she complained that she was not told what the scene would include until shortly prior to filming.\nBertolucci also shot a scene which showed Brando's genitals, but in 1973 explained, \"I had so identified myself with Brando that I cut it out of shame for myself. To show him naked would have been like showing me naked.\" Schneider declared in an interview that \"Marlon said he felt raped and manipulated by it and he was 48. And he was Marlon Brando!\". Like Schneider, Brando confirmed that the sex was simulated. Bertolucci said about Brando that he was \"a monster as an actor and a darling as a human being\". Brando refused to speak to Bertolucci for 15 years after the production was completed. Bertolucci said:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;I was thinking that it was like a dialogue where he was really answering my questions in a way. When at the end of the movie, when he saw it, I discovered that he realized what we were doing, that he was delivering so much of his own experience. And he was very upset with me, and I told him, \"Listen, you are a grown-up. Older than me. Didn't you realize what you were doing?\" And he didn't talk to me for years.\nHowever; \"I called him one day in '93, I think, I was in LA and my wife was shooting a movie. First of all, he answered the phone, and he was talking to me like we had seen each other a day earlier. He said, \"Come here.\" I said, \"When?\" He said, \"Now.\" So I remember driving on Mulholland Drive to his home and thinking I think I won't make it, I think I will crash before [I get there]. I was so emotional.\" The film also features Paul's angry, emotionally charged final confrontation with the corpse of his dead wife. The controversial movie was a hit however, and Brando made the list of Top Ten Box Office Stars for the last time. His gross participation deal earned him $3\u00a0million. The voting membership of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts &amp; Sciences again nominated Brando for Best Actor, his seventh nomination. Brando won the 1973 New York Film Critics Circle Award for Best Actor.\nPauline Kael, in \"The New Yorker\" review, wrote \"The movie breakthrough has finally come. Bertolucci and Brando have altered the face of an art form.\" Brando confessed in his autobiography, \"To this day I can't say what \"Last Tango in Paris\" was about\", and added the film \"required me to do a lot of emotional arm wrestling with myself, and when it was finished, I decided that I wasn't ever again going to destroy myself emotionally to make a movie\". In 1973, Brando was devastated by the death of his childhood best friend Wally Cox. Brando wrenched his ashes from his widow, who was going to sue for their return, but finally said, \"Marlon needed the ashes more than I did.\"\nIn 1976, Brando appeared in \"The Missouri Breaks\" with his friend Jack Nicholson. The movie also reunited the actor with director Arthur Penn. As biographer Stefan Kanfer describes, Penn had difficulty controlling Brando, who seemed intent on going over the top with his border-ruffian-turned-contract-killer Robert E. Lee Clayton: \"Marlon made him a cross-dressing psychopath. Absent for the first hour of the movie, Clayton enters on horseback, dangling upside down, caparisoned in white buckskin, Littlefeather-style. He speaks in an Irish accent for no apparent reason. Over the next hour, also for no apparent reason, Clayton assumes the intonation of a British upper-class twit and an elderly frontier woman, complete with a granny dress and matching bonnet. Penn, who believed in letting actors do their thing, indulged Marlon all the way.\" Critics were unkind, with \"The Observer\" calling Brando's performance \"one of the most extravagant displays of \"grandedamerie\" since Sarah Bernhardt\", while \"The Sun\" complained, \"Marlon Brando at fifty-two has the sloppy belly of a sixty-two-year-old, the white hair of a seventy-two-year-old, and the lack of discipline of a precocious twelve-year-old.\" However, Kanfer noted: \"Even though his late work was met with disapproval, a re-examination shows that often, in the middle of the most pedestrian scene, there would be a sudden, luminous occurrence, a flash of the old Marlon that showed how capable he remained.\"\nIn 1978, Brando narrated the English version of \"Raoni\", a French-Belgian documentary film directed by Jean-Pierre Dutilleux and Luiz Carlos Saldanha that focused on the life of Raoni Metuktire and issues surrounding the survival of the Indigenous tribes in north central Brazil. Brando portrayed Superman's father Jor-El in the 1978 film \"Superman\". He agreed to the role only on assurance that he would be paid a large sum for what amounted to a small part, that he would not have to read the script beforehand, and that his lines would be displayed somewhere off-camera. It was revealed in a documentary contained in the 2001 DVD release of \"Superman\" that he was paid $3.7\u00a0million for two weeks of work. Brando also filmed scenes for the movie's sequel, \"Superman II\", but after producers refused to pay him the same percentage he received for the first movie, he denied them permission to use the footage. \"I asked for my usual percentage,\" he recollected in his memoir, \"but they refused, and so did I.\" However, after Brando's death, the footage was reincorporated into the 2006 recut of the film, ' and in the 2006 \"loose sequel\" \"Superman Returns\", in which both used and unused archive footage of him as Jor-El from the first two \"Superman\" films was remastered for a scene in the Fortress of Solitude, and Brando's voice-overs were used throughout the film. In 1979, he made a rare television appearance in the miniseries ', portraying George Lincoln Rockwell; he won a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Miniseries or a Movie for his performance.\nBrando starred as Colonel Walter E. Kurtz in Francis Ford Coppola's Vietnam epic \"Apocalypse Now\" (1979). He plays a highly decorated U.S. Army Special Forces officer who goes renegade, running his own operation based in Cambodia and is feared by the U.S. military as much as the Vietnamese. Brando was paid $1\u00a0million a week for 3 weeks work. The film drew attention for its lengthy and troubled production, as Eleanor Coppola's documentary \"Hearts of Darkness: A Filmmaker's Apocalypse\" details: Brando showed up on the set overweight, Martin Sheen suffered a heart attack, and severe weather destroyed several expensive sets. The film's release was also postponed several times while Coppola edited millions of feet of footage. In the documentary, Coppola talks about how astonished he was when an overweight Brando turned up for his scenes and, feeling desperate, decided to portray Kurtz, who appears emaciated in the original story, as a man who had indulged every aspect of himself, with Coppola commentating that \"He was already heavy when I hired him and he promised me that he was going to get in shape and I imagined that I would, if he were heavy, I could use that. But he was \"so\" fat, he was very, very shy about it\u00a0... He was very, very adamant about how he didn't want to portray himself that way.\" Brando admitted to Coppola that he had not read the book, \"Heart of Darkness\", as the director had asked him to, and the pair spent days exploring the story and the character of Kurtz, much to the actor's financial benefit, according to producer Fred Roos: \"The clock was ticking on this deal he had and we had to finish him within three weeks or we'd go into this very expensive overage\u00a0... And Francis and Marlon would be talking about the character and whole days would go by. And this is at Marlon's urging\u2014and yet he's getting paid for it.\"\nUpon release, \"Apocalypse Now\" earned critical acclaim, as did Brando's performance. His whispering of Kurtz's final words \"The horror! The horror!\", has become particularly famous. Roger Ebert, writing in the \"Chicago Sun-Times\", defended the movie's controversial denouement, opining that the ending, \"with Brando's fuzzy, brooding monologues and the final violence, feels much more satisfactory than any conventional ending possibly could.\" Brando received a fee of $2\u00a0million plus 10% of the gross theatrical rental and 10% of the TV sale rights, earning him around $9\u00a0million.\n1980\u20132001: Later work and final roles.\nAfter appearing as oil tycoon Adam Steiffel in 1980's \"The Formula\", which was poorly received critically, Brando announced his retirement from acting. However, he returned in 1989 in \"A Dry White Season\", based on Andr\u00e9 Brink's 1979 anti-apartheid novel. Brando agreed to do the film for free, but fell out with director Euzhan Palcy over how the film was edited; he even made a rare television appearance in an interview with Connie Chung to voice his disapproval. In his memoir, he maintained that Palcy \"had cut the picture so poorly, I thought, that the inherent drama of this conflict was vague at best.\" Brando received praise for his performance, earning an Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actor and winning the Best Actor Award at the Tokyo Film Festival.\nBrando scored enthusiastic reviews for his caricature of his Vito Corleone role as Carmine Sabatini in 1990's \"The Freshman.\" In his original review, Roger Ebert wrote, \"There have been a lot of movies where stars have repeated the triumphs of their parts\u2014but has any star ever done it more triumphantly than Marlon Brando does in \"The Freshman\"?\" \"Variety\" also praised Brando's performance as Sabatini and noted, \"Marlon Brando's sublime comedy performance elevates \"The Freshman\" from screwball comedy to a quirky niche in film history.\" Brando starred alongside his friend Johnny Depp on the box office hit \"Don Juan DeMarco\" (1995), in which he also shared credits with singer Selena in her only filming appearance, and in Depp's controversial \"The Brave\" (1997), which was never released in the United States.\nLater performances, such as his appearance in \"\" (1992) (for which he was nominated for a Raspberry as \"Worst Supporting Actor\"), \"The Island of Dr. Moreau\" (in which he won a \"Worst Supporting Actor\" Raspberry) (1996), and his barely recognizable appearance in \"Free Money\" (1998), resulted in some of the worst reviews of his career. \"The Island of Dr. Moreau\" screenwriter Ron Hutchinson would later say in his memoir, \"Clinging to the Iceberg: Writing for a Living on the Stage and in Hollywood\" (2017), that Brando sabotaged the film's production by feuding and refusing to cooperate with his colleagues and the film crew.\nUnlike its immediate predecessors, Brando's last completed film, \"The Score\" (2001), was received generally positively. In the film, in which he portrays a fence, he starred with Robert De Niro. After Brando's death, the novel \"Fan-Tan\" was released. Brando conceived the novel with director Donald Cammell in 1979, but it was not released until 2005.\nLater life.\nBrando's notoriety, his troubled family life and his obesity attracted more attention than his later acting career. He gained a great deal of weight in the 1970s; by the early-to-mid-1990s, he weighed over and suffered from Type 2 diabetes. He had a history of weight fluctuation throughout his career that, by and large, he attributed to his years of stress-related overeating, followed by compensatory dieting. He also earned a reputation for being difficult on the set, often unwilling or unable to memorize his lines and less interested in taking direction than in confronting the film director with odd demands. He also dabbled with some innovation in his last years. He had several patents issued in his name from the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, all of which involve a method of tensioning drumheads, between June 2002 and November 2004 (for example, see https://). His assistant, Alice Marchak, resigned from her role due to his eccentric and unpredictable behavior. Brando also made sketches and art as hobby.\nIn 2004, Brando recorded voice tracks for the character Mrs. Sour in the unreleased animated film \"Big Bug Man\". This was his last role and his only role as a female character. A longtime close friend of entertainer Michael Jackson, Brando paid regular visits to his Neverland Ranch, resting there for weeks at a time. Brando also participated in the singer's two-day solo career in 2001 and starred in his 13-minute-long music video \"You Rock My World\", in the same year.\nBrando's son Miko was Jackson's bodyguard and assistant for several years and was a friend of the singer. \"The last time my father left his house to go anywhere, to spend any kind of time, it was with Michael Jackson\", Miko stated. \"He loved it ... He had a 24-hour chef, 24-hour security, 24-hour help, 24-hour kitchen, 24-hour maid service. Just carte blanche.\" \"Michael was instrumental helping my father through the last few years of his life. For that I will always be indebted to him. Dad had a hard time breathing in his final days and he was on oxygen much of the time. He loved the outdoors, so Michael would invite him over to Neverland. Dad could name all the trees there and the flowers, but being on oxygen it was hard for him to get around and see them all, it's such a big place. So Michael got Dad a golf cart with a portable oxygen tank so he could go around and enjoy Neverland. They'd just drive around\u2014Michael Jackson, Marlon Brando, with an oxygen tank in a golf cart.\" In April 2001, Brando was hospitalized with pneumonia. In 2004, Brando signed with film director Ridha Behi and began preproduction on a project to be titled \"Brando and Brando\". Up to a week before his death, he was working on the script in anticipation of a July/August 2004 start date. Production was suspended in July 2004 following Brando's death, at which time Behi stated that he would continue the film as an homage to Brando, with a new title of \"Citizen Brando\", which ultimately became \"Always Brando\".\nDeath.\nOn July 1, 2004, Brando died of respiratory failure from pulmonary fibrosis with congestive heart failure at the UCLA Medical Center. The cause of death was initially withheld, with his lawyer citing privacy concerns. He also suffered from diabetes and liver cancer. Shortly before his death and despite needing an oxygen mask to breathe, he recorded his voice to appear in the video game \"The Godfather\", once again as Don Vito Corleone. Brando recorded only one line due to his health and an impersonator was hired to finish his lines. His single recorded line was included within the final game as a tribute to the actor. Some additional lines from his character were directly lifted from the film. Karl Malden\u2014Brando's co-star in three films (\"A Streetcar Named Desire\", \"On the Waterfront\", and \"One-Eyed Jacks\")\u2014spoke in a documentary accompanying the DVD of \"A Streetcar Named Desire\" about a phone call he received from Brando shortly before Brando's death. A distressed Brando told Malden he kept falling over. Malden wanted to come over, but Brando put him off, telling him there was no point. Three weeks later, Brando was dead. Shortly before his death, he had apparently refused permission for tubes carrying oxygen to be inserted into his lungs, which, he was told, was the only way to prolong his life.\nBrando was cremated and his ashes were put in with those of Wally Cox. They were then scattered partly in Tahiti and partly in Death Valley.\nPersonal life.\nBrando was known for his tumultuous personal life, his poor treatment of women, and his large number of partners and children. He was the father of at least 11 children, three of whom were adopted. Brando was openly bisexual. In 1976, he told a French journalist, \"Homosexuality is so much in fashion, it no longer makes news. Like a large number of men, I, too, have had homosexual experiences, and I am not ashamed. I have never paid much attention to what people think about me. But if there is someone who is convinced that Jack Nicholson and I are lovers, may they continue to do so. I find it amusing.\"\nDuring the 1947 production of \"A Streetcar Named Desire\", Brando became enamored with fellow cast member Sandy Campbell, who played the minor role of the young collector. Brando had asked Campbell to have an affair with him and was often seen standing in the wings with Campbell and holding his hand. According to Truman Capote, both Campbell and Brando confessed to having been in a sexual relationship. \"I asked Marlon, and he admitted it. He said he went to bed with lots of other men, too, but that he didn't consider himself a homosexual. He said they were all so attracted to him. 'I just thought that I was doing them a favor,' he said.\" In his 1957 interview with Brando for \"The New Yorker\", Capote claimed to have first encountered Brando at a rehearsal for \"A Streetcar Named Desire\" while Brando was sleeping on a table on the stage in an empty auditorium. However, the story was appropriated from Sandy Campbell, as confirmed by Campbell's partner, Donald Windham.\nIn \"Songs My Mother Taught Me\", Brando wrote that he met Marilyn Monroe at a party where she played piano, unnoticed by anybody else there, that they had an affair and maintained an intermittent relationship until her death in 1962, and that he received a telephone call from her two or three days before she died. He also claimed numerous other romances, although he did not discuss his marriages, his wives or his children in his autobiography.\nHe met nisei actress and dancer Reiko Sato in the early 1950s. Though their relationship cooled, they remained friends for the rest of Sato's life, with Sato dividing her time between Los Angeles and Teti\u02bbaroa in her later years.\nBrando was smitten with the Mexican actress Katy Jurado after seeing her in \"High Noon\". They met when Brando was filming \"Viva Zapata!\" in Mexico. Brando told Joseph L. Mankiewicz that he was attracted to \"her enigmatic eyes, black as hell, pointing at you like fiery arrows\". Their first date became the beginning of an extended affair that lasted many years and peaked at the time they worked together on \"One-Eyed Jacks\" (1961), a film directed by Brando.\nBrando met actress Rita Moreno in 1954, and they began a love affair. Moreno later revealed in her memoir that when she became pregnant by Brando, he arranged for an abortion. After the abortion was botched, and Brando fell in love with Tarita Teriipaia, Moreno attempted suicide by overdosing on Brando's sleeping pills. Years after they broke up, Moreno played his love interest in the film \"The Night of the Following Day\". After their relationship, she accused Brando of significant emotional abuse and of throwing chairs in a fit of jealous rage after she revealed she had dated Elvis Presley in the past.\nBrando was briefly engaged to the 19-year-old French actress Josanne Mariani, whom he met in 1954. They broke their engagement when Brando discovered that his other girlfriend, Anna Kashfi, was pregnant, and went on to marry Kashfi instead in 1957. Brando and Kashfi had a son, Christian Brando, on May 11, 1958; they divorced in 1959.\nIn 1960, Brando married Movita Castaneda, a Mexican-American actress; the marriage was annulled in 1968, after it was discovered she was still legally married to her first husband Jack Doyle. Castaneda had appeared in the first \"Mutiny on the Bounty\" film in 1935, 27 years before the 1962 remake with Brando as Fletcher Christian. They had two children together: Miko Castaneda Brando (born 1961) and Rebecca Brando (born 1966).\nFrench actress Tarita Teriipaia, who played Brando's love interest in \"Mutiny on the Bounty\", became his third wife on August 10, 1962. She was twenty years old, 18 years younger than Brando, who was reportedly delighted by her na\u00efvet\u00e9. Because Teriipaia was a native French speaker, Brando became fluent in the language and gave numerous interviews in French. Brando and Teriipaia had two children together: Simon Teihotu Brando (born 1963) and Tarita Cheyenne Brando (1970\u20131995). Brando also adopted Teriipaia's daughter, Maimiti Brando (born 1977) and niece, Raiatua Brando (born 1982). Brando and Teriipaia divorced in 1972.\nAfter Brando's death, the daughter of actress Cynthia Lynn claimed that Brando had a short-lived affair with her mother, who appeared with Brando in \"Bedtime Story\", and that this affair resulted in her birth in 1964. Throughout the late 1960s and into the early 1980s, he had a tempestuous, long-term relationship with actress Jill Banner.\nBrando had a long-term relationship with his housekeeper Maria Cristina Ruiz, with whom he had three children: Ninna Priscilla Brando (born May 13, 1989), Myles Jonathan Brando (born January 16, 1992) and Timothy Gahan Brando (born January 6, 1994). Brando also adopted Petra Brando-Corval (born 1972), the daughter of his assistant Caroline Barrett and novelist James Clavell.\nBrando's close friendship with Wally Cox was the subject of rumors. Brando told a journalist: \"If Wally had been a woman, I would have married him and we would have lived happily ever after.\" Writer-editor Beauregard Houston-Montgomery said that while under the influence of marijuana, Brando told him that Cox had been the love of his life. Milagros Tirado \"Millie\" Beck, Cox's second wife, and Patricia Cox Shapiro, Cox's third wife, dismissed the suggestion that the love was more than platonic. After Cox died in 1973, Brando turned to Cox's widow, Shapiro, and pleaded for permission to scatter Cox's ashes in the hiking spots they had once frequented together, to which she agreed. However, 20 years later, to her dismay, she discovered that Brando had kept the ashes nearby instead of scattering them. Following Brando's death, in accordance with his wishes, his family scattered both men's ashes together in Death Valley, where they had often gone rock hunting.\nIn 2018, Quincy Jones claimed that Brando had had sexual relationships with James Baldwin, Richard Pryor and Marvin Gaye. Pryor's widow, Jennifer Lee, confirmed Pryor's relationship with Brando, but Pryor's daughter, Rain Pryor, disputed that assertion. In February 2024, actor Billy Dee Williams said Brando had propositioned him, which he rejected, while the two were at Brando's home during a party.\nBrando's grandson Tuki Brando (born 1990), son of Cheyenne Brando, is a fashion model. His numerous grandchildren also include Prudence Brando and Shane Brando, children of Miko C. Brando; the children of Rebecca Brando; and the three children of Teihotu Brando among others.\nStephen Blackehart has been reported to be the son of Brando, but Blackehart disputes this claim.\nLifestyle.\nBrando earned a reputation as a \"bad boy\" for his public outbursts and antics. According to \"Los Angeles\": \"Brando was rock and roll before anybody knew what rock and roll was.\" His behavior during the filming of \"Mutiny on the Bounty\" (1962) seemed to bolster his reputation as a difficult star. He was blamed for a change in director and a runaway budget, though he denied responsibility for both. On June 12, 1973, Brando broke paparazzo Ron Galella's jaw. Galella had followed Brando, who was accompanied by talk show host Dick Cavett, after a taping of \"The Dick Cavett Show\" in New York City. He paid a $40,000 out-of-court settlement and suffered an infected hand as a result. Galella wore a football helmet the next time he photographed Brando at a gala benefiting the American Indians Development Association in 1974.\nThe filming of \"Mutiny on the Bounty\" affected Brando's life in a profound way, as he fell in love with Tahiti and its people. He bought a twelve-island atoll, Tetiaroa, and in 1970, hired a Los Angeles architect, Bernard Judge, to build his home and natural village there without despoiling the environment. An environmental laboratory protecting sea birds and turtles was established, and for many years student groups visited. The 1983 hurricane destroyed many of the structures, including his resort. A hotel using Brando's name, The Brando Resort opened in 2014. Brando was an active ham radio operator, with the call signs KE6PZH and FO5GJ (the latter from his island). He was listed in the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) records as Martin Brandeaux to preserve his privacy.\nIn the A&amp;E \"Biography\" episode on Brando, biographer Peter Manso comments: \"On the one hand, being a celebrity allowed Marlon to take his revenge on the world that had so deeply hurt him, so deeply scarred him. On the other hand he hated it because he knew it was false and ephemeral.\" In the same program another biographer, David Thomson, says:\nMany, many people who worked with him, and came to work with him with the best intentions, went away in despair saying he's a spoiled kid. It has to be done his way or he goes away with some vast story about how he was wronged, he was offended, and I think that fits with the psychological pattern that he was a wronged kid.\nActivism.\nIn 1946, Brando performed in Ben Hecht's Zionist play \"A Flag Is Born\". He attended some fundraisers for John F. Kennedy in the 1960 presidential election. In August 1963, he participated in the March on Washington along with fellow celebrities Harry Belafonte, James Garner, Charlton Heston, Burt Lancaster and Sidney Poitier. Along with Paul Newman, Brando also participated in the Freedom Rides. Brando supported Lyndon B. Johnson in the 1964 United States presidential election.\nIn autumn of 1967, Brando visited Helsinki, Finland, at a charity party organized by UNICEF at the Helsinki City Theatre. The gala was televised in thirteen countries. Brando's visit was based on the famine he had seen in Bihar, India, and he presented the film he shot there to the press and invited guests. He spoke in favor of children's rights and development aid in developing countries.\nIn the aftermath of the 1968 assassination of Martin Luther King Jr., he announced that he was bowing out of the lead role of a major film, \"The Arrangement\" (1969), which was about to begin production, to devote himself to the civil rights movement. \"I felt I'd better go find out where it is; what it is to be black in this country; what this rage is all about,\" Brando said on the late-night ABC-TV talk show \"Joey Bishop Show\". In A&amp;E's \"Biography\" episode on Brando, actor and co-star Martin Sheen states: \"I'll never forget the night that Reverend King was shot and I turned on the news and Marlon was walking through Harlem with Mayor Lindsay. And there were snipers and there was a lot of unrest and he kept walking and talking through those neighborhoods with Mayor Lindsay. It was one of the most incredible acts of courage I ever saw, and it meant a lot and did a lot.\"\nBrando's participation in the civil rights movement actually began well before King's death. In the early 1960s, he contributed thousands of dollars to both the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (S.C.L.C.) and to a scholarship fund established for the children of slain Mississippi N.A.A.C.P. leader Medgar Evers. In 1964, Brando was arrested at a \"fish-in\" held to protest a broken treaty that had promised Native Americans fishing rights in Puget Sound. By this time, Brando was already involved in films that carried messages about human rights: \"Sayonara\", which addressed interracial romance, and \"The Ugly American\", depicting the conduct of U.S. officials abroad and the deleterious effect on the citizens of foreign countries. For a time, he was also donating money to the Black Panther Party and considered himself a friend of founder Bobby Seale. He also gave a eulogy after Bobby Hutton was shot by the police.\nBrando was also a supporter of Native American rights and the American Indian Movement. The March 1964 fish-in protest near Tacoma, Washington, where he was arrested while protesting for fishing treaty rights, won him respect from members of the Puyallup tribe, who reportedly dubbed the spot where he was arrested \"Brando's Landing.\" At the 1973 Academy Awards ceremony, Brando refused to accept the Oscar for his career-reviving performance in \"The Godfather\". Sacheen Littlefeather represented him at the ceremony. She appeared in full Apache attire and stated that owing to the \"poor treatment of Native Americans in the film industry\", Brando would not accept the award. This occurred while the standoff at Wounded Knee was ongoing. The event grabbed the attention of the US and the world media. This was considered a major event and victory for the movement by its supporters and participants.\nOutside of his film work, Brando appeared before the California Assembly in support of a fair housing law, and personally joined picket lines in demonstrations protesting discrimination in housing developments in 1963.\nHe was also an activist against apartheid. In 1964, he favored a boycott of his films in South Africa to prevent them from being shown to a segregated audience. He took part at a 1975 protest rally against American investments in South Africa and for the release of Nelson Mandela. In 1989, Brando also starred in the film \"A Dry White Season\", based upon Andr\u00e9 Brink's novel of the same name.\nComments on Jews and Hollywood.\nIn an interview in \"Playboy\" magazine in January 1979, Brando said: \"You've seen every single race besmirched, but you never saw an image of the kike because the Jews were ever so watchful for that\u2014and rightly so. They never allowed it to be shown on screen. The Jews have done so much for the world that, I suppose, you get extra disappointed because they didn't pay attention to that.\" He would state similar comments in his 1994 autobiography \"Songs My Mother Taught Me\".\nBrando made a similar comment on \"Larry King Live\" in April 1996, saying:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Hollywood is run by Jews; it is owned by Jews, and they should have a greater sensitivity about the issue of\u2014of people who are suffering. Because they've exploited\u2014we have seen the\u2014we have seen the nigger and greaseball, we've seen the chink, we've seen the slit-eyed dangerous Jap, we have seen the wily Filipino, we've seen everything, but we never saw the kike. Because they knew perfectly well, that that is where you draw the wagons around.\nLarry King, who was Jewish, replied: \"When you say\u2014when you say something like that, you are playing right in, though, to anti-Semitic people who say the Jews are\u2014\" Brando interrupted: \"No, no, because I will be the first one who will appraise the Jews honestly and say 'Thank God for the Jews'.\"\nJay Kanter, Brando's agent, producer, and friend, defended him in \"Daily Variety\": \"Marlon has spoken to me for hours about his fondness for the Jewish people, and he is a well-known supporter of Israel\"; Kanter himself was Jewish. Similarly, Louie Kemp, in his article for \"Jewish Journal\", wrote: \"You might remember him as Don Vito Corleone, Stanley Kowalski or the eerie Col. Walter E. Kurtz in 'Apocalypse Now', but I remember Marlon Brando as a mensch and a personal friend of the Jewish people when they needed it most.\"\nLegacy.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\nThat will be Brando's legacy whether he likes it or not\u2014the stunning actor who embodied a poetry of anxiety that touched the deepest dynamics of his time and place.\n\u2014Jack Kroll in 1994\nBrando was one of the most respected actors of the post-war era. He is listed by the American Film Institute as the fourth greatest male star whose screen debut occurred before or during 1950 (it occurred in 1950). Film critic Pauline Kael called him an \"American hero\" and the main protagonist of the 1950s that embodied the tragic forces and themes of the time. He earned respect among critics for his memorable performances and charismatic screen presence. He helped popularize 'method acting'. He is regarded as one of the greatest cinema actors of the 20th century. Furthermore, he was one of only six actors named in 1999 by \"Time\" magazine in its list of the . In this list, \"Time\" also designated Brando as the \"Actor of the Century\".\n\"Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica\" describes him as \"the most celebrated of the method actors, and his slurred, mumbling delivery marked his rejection of classical dramatic training. His true and passionate performances proved him one of the greatest actors of his generation.\" It also notes the apparent paradox of his talent: \"He is regarded as the most influential actor of his generation, yet his open disdain for the acting profession ... often manifested itself in the form of questionable choices and uninspired performances. Nevertheless, he remains a riveting screen presence with a vast emotional range and an endless array of compulsively watchable idiosyncrasies.\"\nCultural influence.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\nHe was our angry young man\u2014the delinquent, the tough, the rebel\u2014who stood at the center of our common experience.\n\u2014Pauline Kael\nMarlon Brando is a cultural icon with enduring popularity. His rise to national attention in the 1950s had a profound effect on American culture. According to film critic Pauline Kael, \"Brando represented a reaction against the post-war mania for security. As a protagonist, the Brando of the early fifties had no code, only his instincts. He was a development from the gangster leader and the outlaw. He was antisocial because he knew society was crap; he was a hero to youth because he was strong enough not to take the crap\u00a0... Brando represented a contemporary version of the free American.\"\nSociologist Suzanne McDonald-Walker states: \"Marlon Brando, sporting leather jacket, jeans, and moody glare, became a cultural icon summing up 'the road' in all its maverick glory.\" His portrayal of the gang leader Johnny Strabler in \"The Wild One\" has become an enduring image, used both as a symbol of rebelliousness and a fashion accessory that includes a Perfecto style motorcycle jacket, a tilted cap, jeans and sunglasses. Johnny's haircut inspired a craze for sideburns, followed by James Dean and Elvis Presley, among others. Dean copied Brando's acting style extensively and Presley used Brando's image as a model for his role in \"Jailhouse Rock\". Brando fans at the time held extraordinary resentment towards other actors, including Dean, if anyone came close to copying Brando's style as if another actor was trying to \"take away some power from their god.\" These even extended to jeers and movie theater walkout by his devout following.\nThe \"I coulda been a contender\" scene from \"On the Waterfront\", according to the author of\" Brooklyn Boomer\", Martin H. Levinson, is \"one of the most famous scenes in motion picture history, and the line itself has become part of America's cultural lexicon.\" An example of the endurance of Brando's popular \"Wild One\" image was the 2009 release of replicas of the leather jacket worn by Brando's Johnny Strabler character. The jackets were marketed by Triumph, the manufacturer of the Triumph Thunderbird motorcycles featured in \"The Wild One\", and were officially licensed by Brando's estate.\nBrando was also considered a male sex symbol. Linda Williams writes: \"Marlon Brando [was] the quintessential American male sex symbol of the late fifties and early sixties\". Brando was an early lesbian icon who, along with James Dean, influenced the butch look and self-image in the 1950s and after.\nBrando has also been immortalized in music; most notably, he was mentioned in the lyrics of \"It's Hard to Be a Saint in the City\" by Bruce Springsteen, in which one of the opening lines read \"I could walk like Brando right in to the sun\", and in Neil Young's \"Pocahontas\" as a tribute to his lifetime support of Native Americans and in which Brando is depicted sitting by a fire with Young and Pocahontas. Brando was also mentioned in \"Vogue\" by Madonna, \"Is This What You Wanted\" by Leonard Cohen on the album New Skin for the Old Ceremony, \"Eyeless\" by Slipknot on their self-titled album, and most recently in the song simply titled \"Marlon Brando\" on the Australian singer Alex Cameron's 2017 album \"Forced Witness\". Bob Dylan's 2020 song \"My Own Version of You\" references one of his most famous performances in the line: \"I'll take the \"Scarface\" Pacino and the \"Godfather\" Brando / Mix 'em up in a tank and get a robot commando.\"\nBrando is also visible on the cover of the Beatles' 1967 album \"Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band\", among a tableau of celebrities and historical figures.\nBrando's films, along with those of James Dean, caused Honda to come forward with its \"You Meet the Nicest People on a Honda\" ads, to curb the negative association motorcycles had gotten with rebels and outlaws.\nViews on acting.\nIn his autobiography \"Songs My Mother Taught Me\", Brando observed:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;I've always thought that one benefit of acting is that it gives actors a chance to express feelings that they are normally unable to vent in real life. Intense emotions buried inside you can come smoking out the back of your head, and I suppose in terms of psychodrama this can be helpful. In hindsight, I guess my emotional insecurity as a child\u2014the frustrations of not being allowed to be who I was, of wanting love and not being able to get it, of realizing that I was of no value\u2014may have helped me as an actor, at least in a small way. It probably gave me a certain intensity that most people don't have.\nHe also confessed that, while having great admiration for the theater, he did not return to it after his initial success primarily because the work left him drained emotionally:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;What I remember most about \"A Streetcar Named Desire\" was the emotional grind of acting in it six nights and two afternoons. Try to imagine what it was like walking on stage at 8:30 every night having to yell, scream, cry, break dishes, kick the furniture, punch the walls and \"experience\" the same intense, wrenching emotions night after night, trying each time to evoke in audiences the same emotions I felt. It was exhausting.\nBrando repeatedly credited Stella Adler and her understanding of the Stanislavski acting technique for bringing realism to American cinema, but also added:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;This school of acting served the American theater and motion pictures well, but it was restricting. The American theater has never been able to present Shakespeare or classical drama of any kind satisfactorily. We simply do not have the style, the regard for the language or the cultural disposition \u2026 You cannot mumble in Shakespeare. You cannot improvise, and you are required to adhere strictly to the text. The English theater has a sense of language that we do not recognize \u2026 In the United States the English language has developed almost into a patois.\nIn the 2015 documentary \"Listen to Me Marlon\", Brando shared his thoughts on playing a death scene, stating, \"That's a tough scene to play. You have to make 'em believe that you are dying ... Try to think of the most intimate moment you've ever had in your life.\"\nHis favorite actors were Spencer Tracy, John Barrymore, Fredric March, James Cagney, and Paul Muni. He also showed admiration for Sean Penn, Jack Nicholson, Johnny Depp, and Daniel Day-Lewis.\nActing credits and accolades.\nAmong the numerous accolades for his acting work, Brando has won two Academy Awards for Best Actor for his role as a longshoreman in the Elia Kazan directed drama \"On the Waterfront\" (1954) and Vito Corleone in the Francis Ford Coppola directed crime film \"The Godfather\" (1972). He also won three BAFTA Awards, five Golden Globe Awards and a Primetime Emmy Award.\nOver his lengthy career he has been recognized by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences for the following performances:\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nWorks cited.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "19904", "revid": "237572", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19904", "title": "Meteorology", "text": "Interdisciplinary scientific study of the atmosphere focusing on weather forecasting\nMeteorology is the scientific study of the Earth's atmosphere and short-term atmospheric phenomena (i.e., weather), with a focus on weather forecasting. It has applications in the military, aviation, energy production, transport, agriculture, construction, weather warnings, and disaster management.\nAlong with climatology, atmospheric physics, atmospheric chemistry, and aeronomy, meteorology forms the broader field of the atmospheric sciences. The interactions between Earth's atmosphere and its oceans (notably El Ni\u00f1o and La Ni\u00f1a) are studied in the interdisciplinary field of hydrometeorology. Other interdisciplinary areas include biometeorology, space weather, and planetary meteorology. Marine weather forecasting relates meteorology to maritime and coastal safety, based on atmospheric interactions with large bodies of water.\nMeteorologists study meteorological phenomena driven by solar radiation, Earth's rotation, ocean currents, and other factors. These include everyday weather like clouds, precipitation, and wind patterns, as well as severe weather events such as tropical cyclones and severe winter storms. Such phenomena are quantified using variables like temperature, pressure, and humidity, which are then used to forecast weather at local (microscale), regional (mesoscale and synoptic scale), and global scales. Meteorologists collect data using basic instruments like thermometers, barometers, and weather vanes (for surface-level measurements), alongside advanced tools like weather satellites, balloons, reconnaissance aircraft, buoys, and radars. The World Meteorological Organization (WMO) ensures international standardization of meteorological research. \nThe study of meteorology dates back millennia. Ancient civilizations tried to predict weather through folklore, astrology, and religious rituals. Aristotle's treatise \"Meteorology\" sums up early observations of the field, which advanced little during early medieval times but experienced a resurgence during the Renaissance, when Alhazen and Ren\u00e9 Descartes challenged Aristotelian theories, emphasizing scientific methods. In the 18th century, accurate measurement tools (e.g., barometer and thermometer) were developed, and the first meteorological society was founded. In the 19th century, telegraph-based weather observation networks were formed across broad regions. In the 20th century, numerical weather prediction (NWP), coupled with advanced satellite and radar technology, introduced sophisticated forecasting models. Later, computers revolutionized forecasting by processing vast datasets in real time and automatically solving modeling equations. 21st-century meteorology is highly accurate and driven by big data and supercomputing. It is adopting innovations like machine learning, ensemble forecasting, and high-resolution global climate modeling. Climate change\u2013induced extreme weather poses new challenges for forecasting and research, while inherent uncertainty remains because of the atmosphere's chaotic nature (see butterfly effect).\nEtymology.\nThe word \"meteorology\" is from the Ancient Greek \u03bc\u03b5\u03c4\u03ad\u03c9\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2 \"met\u00e9\u014dros\" (\"meteor\") and -\u03bb\u03bf\u03b3\u03af\u03b1 \"-logia\" (\"-(o)logy\"), meaning \"the study of things high in the air\".\nHistory.\nAncient meteorology up to the time of Aristotle.\nEarly attempts at predicting weather were often related to prophecy and divining, and were sometimes based on astrological ideas. Ancient religions believed meteorological phenomena to be under the control of the gods. The ability to predict rains and floods based on annual cycles was evidently used by humans at least from the time of agricultural settlement if not earlier. Early approaches to predicting weather were based on astrology and were practiced by priests. The Egyptians had rain-making rituals as early as 3500 BC. \nAncient Indian Upanishads contain mentions of clouds and seasons. The Samaveda mentions sacrifices to be performed when certain phenomena were noticed. Var\u0101hamihira's classical work \"Brihatsamhita\", written about 500 AD, provides evidence of weather observation.\nCuneiform inscriptions on Babylonian tablets included associations between thunder and rain. The Chaldeans differentiated the 22\u00b0 and 46\u00b0 halos.\nThe ancient Greeks were the first to make theories about the weather. Many natural philosophers studied the weather. However, as meteorological instruments did not exist, the inquiry was largely qualitative, and could only be judged by more general theoretical speculations. Herodotus states that Thales predicted the solar eclipse of 585 BC. He studied Babylonian equinox tables. According to Seneca, he explained that the cause of the Nile's annual floods was due to northerly winds hindering its descent by the sea. Anaximander and Anaximenes thought that thunder and lightning was caused by air smashing against the cloud, thus kindling the flame. Early meteorological theories generally considered that there was a fire-like substance in the atmosphere. Anaximander defined wind as a flowing of air, but this was not generally accepted for centuries. A theory to explain summer hail was first proposed by Anaxagoras. He observed that air temperature decreased with increasing height and that clouds contain moisture. He also noted that heat caused objects to rise, and therefore the heat on a summer day would drive clouds to an altitude where the moisture would freeze. Empedocles theorized on the change of the seasons. He believed that fire and water opposed each other in the atmosphere, and when fire gained the upper hand, the result was summer, and when water did, it was winter. Democritus also wrote about the flooding of the Nile. He said that snow in northern parts of the world melted during the summer solstice. This would cause vapors to form clouds, which would cause storms when driven to the Nile by northerly winds, thus filling the lakes and the Nile. Hippocrates inquired into the effect of weather on health. Eudoxus claimed that bad weather followed four-year periods, according to Pliny.\nAristotelian meteorology.\nThese early observations would form the basis for Aristotle's \"Meteorology\", written in 350 BC. Aristotle is considered the founder of meteorology. One of the most impressive achievements described in the \"Meteorology\" is the description of what is now known as the hydrologic cycle. His work would remain an authority on meteorology for nearly 2,000 years.\nThe treatise \"On the Universe\" (composed before 250 BC or between 350 and 200 BC) noted:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;If the flashing body is set on fire and rushes violently to the earth it is called a thunderbolt ; if it be only half of fire, but violent also and massive, it is called a meteor ; if it is entirely free from fire, it is called a smoking bolt. They are all called 'swooping bolts', because they swoop down upon the earth. Lightning is sometimes smoky, and is then called 'smouldering lightning' ; sometimes it darts quickly along, and is then said to be 'vivid' ; at other times it travels in crooked lines, and is called 'forked lightning' ; when it swoops down upon some object it is called 'swooping lightning'.\nAfter Aristotle, progress in meteorology stalled for a long time. Theophrastus compiled a book on weather forecasting, called the \"Book of Signs\", as well as \"On Winds\". He gave hundreds of signs for weather phenomena for a period up to a year. His system was based on dividing the year by the setting and the rising of the Pleiad, halves into solstices and equinoxes, and the continuity of the weather for those periods. He also divided months into the new moon, fourth day, eighth day and full moon, in likelihood of a change in the weather occurring. The day was divided into sunrise, mid-morning, noon, mid-afternoon and sunset, with corresponding divisions of the night, with change being likely at one of these divisions. Applying the divisions and a principle of balance in the yearly weather, he came up with forecasts like that if a lot of rain falls in the winter, the spring is usually dry. Rules based on actions of animals are also present in his work, like that if a dog rolls on the ground, it is a sign of a storm. Shooting stars and the Moon were also considered significant. However, he made no attempt to explain these phenomena, referring only to the Aristotelian method. The work of Theophrastus remained a dominant influence in weather forecasting for nearly 2,000 years.\nMeteorology after Aristotle.\nMeteorology continued to be studied and developed over the centuries, but it was not until the Renaissance in the 14th to 17th centuries that significant advancements were made in the field. Scientists such as Galileo and Descartes introduced new methods and ideas, leading to the scientific revolution in meteorology.\nSpeculation on the cause of the flooding of the Nile ended when Eratosthenes, according to Proclus, stated that it was known that man had gone to the sources of the Nile and observed the rains, although interest in its implications continued.\nDuring the era of Roman Greece and Europe, scientific interest in meteorology waned. In the 1st century BC, most natural philosophers claimed that the clouds and winds extended up to 111 miles, but Posidonius thought that they reached up to five miles, after which the air is clear, liquid and luminous. He closely followed Aristotle's theories. By the end of the second century BC, the center of science shifted from Athens to Alexandria, home to the ancient Library of Alexandria. In the 2nd century AD, Ptolemy's Almagest dealt with meteorology, because it was considered a subset of astronomy. He gave several astrological weather predictions. He constructed a map of the world divided into climatic zones by their illumination, in which the length of the Summer solstice increased by half an hour per zone between the equator and the Arctic. Ptolemy wrote on the atmospheric refraction of light in the context of astronomical observations.\nIn 25 AD, Pomponius Mela, a Roman geographer, formalized the climatic zone system. In 63\u201364 AD, Seneca wrote \"Naturales quaestiones\". It was a compilation and synthesis of ancient Greek theories. However, theology was of foremost importance to Seneca, and he believed that phenomena such as lightning were tied to fate. The second book (chapter) of Pliny the Elder's \"Natural History\" covers meteorology. He states that more than twenty ancient Greek authors studied meteorology. He did not make any personal contributions, and the value of his work is in preserving earlier speculation, much like Seneca's work.\nFrom 400 to 1100, scientific learning in Europe was preserved by the clergy. Isidore of Seville devoted a considerable attention to meteorology in \"Etymologiae\", \"De ordine creaturum\" and \"De natura rerum\". Bede the Venerable was the first Englishman to write about the weather in \"De natura rerum\" in 703. The work was a summary of then extant classical sources. However, Aristotle's works were largely lost until the 12th century, including \"Meteorologica\". Isidore and Bede were scientifically minded, but they adhered to the letter of Scripture.\nIslamic civilization translated many ancient works into Arabic which were transmitted and translated in western Europe to Latin.\nIn the 9th century, Al-Dinawari wrote the \"Kitab al-Nabat\" (Book of Plants), in which he deals with the application of meteorology to agriculture during the Arab Agricultural Revolution. He describes the meteorological character of the sky, the planets and constellations, the sun and moon, the lunar phases indicating seasons and rain, the \"anwa\" (heavenly bodies of rain), and atmospheric phenomena such as winds, thunder, lightning, snow, floods, valleys, rivers, lakes.\nIn 1021, Alhazen showed that atmospheric refraction is also responsible for twilight in \"Opticae thesaurus\"; he estimated that twilight begins when the sun is 19 degrees below the horizon, and also used a geometric determination based on this to estimate the maximum possible height of the Earth's atmosphere as 52,000 \"passim\" (about 49 miles, or 79\u00a0km).\nAdelard of Bath was one of the early translators of the classics. He also discussed meteorological topics in his \"Quaestiones naturales\". He thought dense air produced propulsion in the form of wind. He explained thunder by saying that it was due to ice colliding in clouds, and in Summer it melted. In the 13th century, Aristotelian theories reestablished dominance in meteorology. For the next four centuries, meteorological work by and large was mostly commentary. It has been estimated over 156 commentaries on the \"Meteorologica\" were written before 1650.\nExperimental evidence was less important than appeal to the classics and authority in medieval thought. In the 13th century, Roger Bacon advocated experimentation and the mathematical approach. In his \"Opus majus\", he followed Aristotle's theory on the atmosphere being composed of water, air, and fire, supplemented by optics and geometric proofs. He noted that Ptolemy's climatic zones had to be adjusted for topography.\nAlbertus Magnus was the first to propose that each drop of falling rain had the form of a small sphere, and that this form meant that the rainbow was produced by light interacting with each raindrop. Roger Bacon was the first to calculate the angular size of the rainbow. He stated that a rainbow summit cannot appear higher than 42 degrees above the horizon. \nIn the late 13th century and early 14th century, Kam\u0101l al-D\u012bn al-F\u0101ris\u012b and Theodoric of Freiberg were the first to give the correct explanations for the primary rainbow phenomenon. Theodoric went further and also explained the secondary rainbow.\nBy the middle of the 16th century, meteorology had developed along two lines: theoretical science based on \"Meteorologica\", and astrological weather forecasting. The pseudoscientific prediction by natural signs became popular and enjoyed protection of the church and princes. This was supported by scientists like Regiomontanus, Leonard Digges, and Johannes Kepler. However, there were skeptics. In the 14th century, Nicole Oresme believed that weather forecasting was possible, but that the rules for it were unknown at the time. Astrological influence in meteorology persisted until the 18th century.\nGerolamo Cardano's \"De Subilitate\" (1550) was the first work to challenge fundamental aspects of Aristotelian theory. Cardano maintained that there were only three basic elements- earth, air, and water. He discounted fire because it needed material to spread and produced nothing. Cardano thought there were two kinds of air: free air and enclosed air. The former destroyed inanimate things and preserved animate things, while the latter had the opposite effect.\nRen\u00e9 Descartes's \"Discourse on the Method\" (1637) typifies the beginning of the scientific revolution in meteorology. His scientific method had four principles: to never accept anything unless one clearly knew it to be true; to divide every difficult problem into small problems to tackle; to proceed from the simple to the complex, always seeking relationships; to be as complete and thorough as possible with no prejudice.\nIn the appendix \"Les Meteores\", he applied these principles to meteorology. He discussed terrestrial bodies and vapors which arise from them, proceeding to explain the formation of clouds from drops of water, and winds, clouds then dissolving into rain, hail and snow. He also discussed the effects of light on the rainbow. Descartes hypothesized that all bodies were composed of small particles of different shapes and interwovenness. All of his theories were based on this hypothesis. He explained the rain as caused by clouds becoming too large for the air to hold, and that clouds became snow if the air was not warm enough to melt them, or hail if they met colder wind. Like his predecessors, Descartes's method was deductive, as meteorological instruments were not developed and extensively used yet. He introduced the Cartesian coordinate system to meteorology and stressed the importance of mathematics in natural science. His work established meteorology as a legitimate branch of physics.\nIn the 18th century, the invention of the thermometer and barometer allowed for more accurate measurements of temperature and pressure, leading to a better understanding of atmospheric processes. This century also saw the birth of the first meteorological society, the Societas Meteorologica Palatina in 1780.\nIn the 19th century, advances in technology such as the telegraph and photography led to the creation of weather observing networks and the ability to track storms. Additionally, scientists began to use mathematical models to make predictions about the weather. The 20th century saw the development of radar and satellite technology, which greatly improved the ability to observe and track weather systems. In addition, meteorologists and atmospheric scientists started to create the first weather forecasts and temperature predictions.\nIn the 20th and 21st centuries, with the advent of computer models and big data, meteorology has become increasingly dependent on numerical methods and computer simulations. This has greatly improved weather forecasting and climate predictions. Additionally, meteorology has expanded to include other areas such as air quality, atmospheric chemistry, and climatology. The advancement in observational, theoretical and computational technologies has enabled ever more accurate weather predictions and understanding of weather pattern and air pollution. In current time, with the advancement in weather forecasting and satellite technology, meteorology has become an integral part of everyday life, and is used for many purposes such as aviation, agriculture, and disaster management.\nInstruments and classification scales.\nIn 1441, King Sejong's son, Prince Munjong of Korea, invented the first standardized rain gauge. These were sent throughout the Joseon dynasty of Korea as an official tool to assess land taxes based upon a farmer's potential harvest. In 1450, Leone Battista Alberti developed a swinging-plate anemometer, and was known as the first \"anemometer\". In 1607, Galileo Galilei constructed a thermoscope. In 1611, Johannes Kepler wrote the first scientific treatise on snow crystals: \"Strena Seu de Nive Sexangula (A New Year's Gift of Hexagonal Snow)\". In 1643, Evangelista Torricelli invented the mercury barometer. In 1662, Sir Christopher Wren invented the mechanical, self-emptying, tipping bucket rain gauge. In 1714, Gabriel Fahrenheit created a reliable scale for measuring temperature with a mercury-type thermometer. In 1742, Anders Celsius, a Swedish astronomer, proposed the \"centigrade\" temperature scale, the predecessor of the current Celsius scale. In 1783, the first hair hygrometer was demonstrated by Horace-B\u00e9n\u00e9dict de Saussure. In 1802\u20131803, Luke Howard wrote \"On the Modification of Clouds\", in which he assigns cloud types Latin names. In 1806, Francis Beaufort introduced his system for classifying wind speeds. Near the end of the 19th century the first cloud atlases were published, including the \"International Cloud Atlas\", which has remained in print ever since. The April 1960 launch of the first successful weather satellite, TIROS-1, marked the beginning of the age where weather information became available globally.\nAtmospheric composition research.\nIn 1648, Blaise Pascal rediscovered that atmospheric pressure decreases with height, and deduced that there is a vacuum above the atmosphere. In 1738, Daniel Bernoulli published \"Hydrodynamics\", initiating the kinetic theory of gases and established the basic laws for the theory of gases. In 1761, Joseph Black discovered that ice absorbs heat without changing its temperature when melting. In 1772, Black's student Daniel Rutherford discovered nitrogen, which he called \"phlogisticated air\", and together they developed the phlogiston theory. In 1777, Antoine Lavoisier discovered oxygen and developed an explanation for combustion. In 1783, in Lavoisier's essay \"Reflexions sur le phlogistique\", he deprecates the phlogiston theory and proposes a caloric theory. In 1804, John Leslie observed that a matte black surface radiates heat more effectively than a polished surface, suggesting the importance of black-body radiation. In 1808, John Dalton defended caloric theory in \"A New System of Chemistry\" and described how it combines with matter, especially gases; he proposed that the heat capacity of gases varies inversely with atomic weight. In 1824, Sadi Carnot analyzed the efficiency of steam engines using caloric theory; he developed the notion of a reversible process and, in postulating that no such thing exists in nature, laid the foundation for the second law of thermodynamics. In 1716, Edmond Halley suggested that aurorae are caused by \"magnetic effluvia\" moving along the Earth's magnetic field lines.\nResearch into cyclones and air flow.\nIn 1494, Christopher Columbus experienced a tropical cyclone, which led to the first written European account of a hurricane. In 1686, Edmond Halley presented a systematic study of the trade winds and monsoons and identified solar heating as the cause of atmospheric motions. In 1735, an \"ideal\" explanation of global circulation through study of the trade winds was written by George Hadley. In 1743, when Benjamin Franklin was prevented from seeing a lunar eclipse by a hurricane, he decided that cyclones move in a contrary manner to the winds at their periphery. Understanding the kinematics of how exactly the rotation of the Earth affects airflow was partial at first. Gaspard-Gustave Coriolis published a paper in 1835 on the energy yield of machines with rotating parts, such as waterwheels. In 1856, William Ferrel proposed the existence of a circulation cell in the mid-latitudes, and the air within deflected by the Coriolis force resulting in the prevailing westerly winds. Late in the 19th century, the motion of air masses along isobars was understood to be the result of the large-scale interaction of the pressure gradient force and the deflecting force. By 1912, this deflecting force was named the Coriolis effect. Just after World War I, a group of meteorologists in Norway led by Vilhelm Bjerknes developed the Norwegian cyclone model that explains the generation, intensification and ultimate decay (the life cycle) of mid-latitude cyclones, and introduced the idea of fronts, that is, sharply defined boundaries between air masses. The group included Carl-Gustaf Rossby (who was the first to explain the large scale atmospheric flow in terms of fluid dynamics), Tor Bergeron (who first determined how rain forms) and Jacob Bjerknes.\nObservation networks and weather forecasting.\nIn the late 16th century and first half of the 17th century a range of meteorological instruments were invented \u2013 the thermometer, barometer, hydrometer, as well as wind and rain gauges. In the 1650s natural philosophers started using these instruments to systematically record weather observations. Scientific academies established weather diaries and organised observational networks. In 1654, Ferdinando II de Medici established the first \"weather observing\" network, that consisted of meteorological stations in Florence, Cutigliano, Vallombrosa, Bologna, Parma, Milan, Innsbruck, Osnabr\u00fcck, Paris and Warsaw. The collected data were sent to Florence at regular time intervals. In the 1660s Robert Hooke of the Royal Society of London sponsored networks of weather observers. Hippocrates's treatise \"Airs, Waters, and Places\" had linked weather to disease. Thus early meteorologists attempted to correlate weather patterns with epidemic outbreaks, and the climate with public health.\nDuring the Age of Enlightenment meteorology tried to rationalise traditional weather lore, including astrological meteorology. But there were also attempts to establish a theoretical understanding of weather phenomena. Edmond Halley and George Hadley tried to explain trade winds. They reasoned that the rising mass of heated equator air is replaced by an inflow of cooler air from high latitudes. A flow of warm air at high altitude from equator to poles in turn established an early picture of circulation. Frustration with the lack of discipline among weather observers, and the poor quality of the instruments, led the early modern nation states to organise large observation networks. Thus, by the end of the 18th century, meteorologists had access to large quantities of reliable weather data. In 1832, an electromagnetic telegraph was created by Baron Schilling. The arrival of the electrical telegraph in 1837 afforded, for the first time, a practical method for quickly gathering surface weather observations from a wide area.\nThis data could be used to produce maps of the state of the atmosphere for a region near the Earth's surface and to study how these states evolved through time. To make frequent weather forecasts based on these data required a reliable network of observations, but it was not until 1849 that the Smithsonian Institution began to establish an observation network across the United States under the leadership of Joseph Henry. Similar observation networks were established in Europe at this time. The Reverend William Clement Ley was key in understanding of cirrus clouds and early understandings of jet streams. Charles Kenneth Mackinnon Douglas, known as 'CKM' Douglas, read Ley's papers after his death and carried on the early study of weather systems.\n19th-century researchers in meteorology were drawn from military or medical backgrounds, rather than trained as dedicated scientists. In 1854, the United Kingdom government appointed Robert FitzRoy to the new office of \"Meteorological Statist to the Board of Trade\" with the task of gathering weather observations at sea. FitzRoy's office became the United Kingdom Meteorological Office in 1854, the second oldest national meteorological service in the world (the Central Institution for Meteorology and Geodynamics (ZAMG) in Austria was founded in 1851 and is the oldest weather service in the world). The first daily weather forecasts made by FitzRoy's Office were published in \"The Times\" newspaper in 1860. The following year a system was introduced of hoisting storm warning cones at principal ports when a gale was expected.\nFitzRoy coined the term \"weather forecast\" and tried to separate scientific approaches from prophetic ones.\nOver the next 50 years, many countries established national meteorological services. The India Meteorological Department (1875) was established to follow tropical cyclone and monsoon. The Finnish Meteorological Central Office (1881) was formed from part of Magnetic Observatory of Helsinki University. Japan's Tokyo Meteorological Observatory, the forerunner of the Japan Meteorological Agency, began constructing surface weather maps in 1883. The United States Weather Bureau (1890) was established under the United States Department of Agriculture. The Australian Bureau of Meteorology (1906) was established by a Meteorology Act to unify existing state meteorological services.\nNumerical weather prediction.\nIn 1904, Norwegian scientist Vilhelm Bjerknes first argued in his paper \"Weather Forecasting as a Problem in Mechanics and Physics\" that it should be possible to forecast weather from calculations based upon natural laws.\nIt was not until later in the 20th century that advances in the understanding of atmospheric physics led to the foundation of modern numerical weather prediction. In 1922, Lewis Fry Richardson published \"Weather Prediction By Numerical Process\", after finding notes and derivations he worked on as an ambulance driver in World War I. He described how small terms in the prognostic fluid dynamics equations that govern atmospheric flow could be neglected, and a numerical calculation scheme that could be devised to allow predictions. Richardson envisioned a large auditorium of thousands of people performing the calculations. However, the sheer number of calculations required was too large to complete without electronic computers, and the size of the grid and time steps used in the calculations led to unrealistic results. Though numerical analysis later found that this was due to numerical instability.\nStarting in the 1950s, numerical forecasts with computers became feasible. The first weather forecasts derived this way used barotropic (single-vertical-level) models, and could successfully predict the large-scale movement of midlatitude Rossby waves, that is, the pattern of atmospheric lows and highs. In 1959, the UK Meteorological Office received its first computer, a Ferranti Mercury.\nIn the 1960s, the chaotic nature of the atmosphere was first observed and mathematically described by Edward Lorenz, founding the field of chaos theory. These advances have led to the current use of ensemble forecasting in most major forecasting centers, to take into account uncertainty arising from the chaotic nature of the atmosphere. Mathematical models used to predict the long term weather of the Earth (climate models), have been developed that have a resolution today that are as coarse as the older weather prediction models. These climate models are used to investigate long-term climate shifts, such as what effects might be caused by human emission of greenhouse gases.\nMeteorologists.\nMeteorologists are scientists who study and work in the field of meteorology. The American Meteorological Society publishes and continually updates an authoritative electronic \"Meteorology Glossary\". Meteorologists work in government agencies, private consulting and research services, industrial enterprises, utilities, radio and television stations, and in education. In the United States, meteorologists held about 10,000 jobs in 2018.\nAlthough weather forecasts and warnings are the best known products of meteorologists for the public, weather presenters on radio and television are not necessarily professional meteorologists. They are most often reporters with little formal meteorological training, using unregulated titles such as \"weather specialist\" or \"weatherman\". The American Meteorological Society and National Weather Association issue \"Seals of Approval\" to weather broadcasters who meet certain requirements but this is not mandatory to be hired by the media.\nEquipment.\nEach science has its own unique sets of laboratory equipment. In the atmosphere, there are many things or qualities of the atmosphere that can be measured. Rain, which can be observed, or seen anywhere and anytime was one of the first atmospheric qualities measured historically. Also, two other accurately measured qualities are wind and humidity. Neither of these can be seen but can be felt. The devices to measure these three sprang up in the mid-15th century and were respectively the rain gauge, the anemometer, and the hygrometer. Many attempts had been made prior to the 15th century to construct adequate equipment to measure the many atmospheric variables. Many were faulty in some way or were simply not reliable. Even Aristotle noted this in some of his work as the difficulty to measure the air.\nSets of surface measurements are important data to meteorologists. They give a snapshot of a variety of weather conditions at one single location and are usually at a weather station, a ship or a weather buoy. The measurements taken at a weather station can include any number of atmospheric observables. Usually, temperature, pressure, wind measurements, and humidity are the variables that are measured by a thermometer, barometer, anemometer, and hygrometer, respectively. Professional stations may also include air quality sensors (carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, methane, ozone, dust, and smoke), ceilometer (cloud ceiling), falling precipitation sensor, flood sensor, lightning sensor, microphone (explosions, sonic booms, thunder), pyranometer/pyrheliometer/spectroradiometer (IR/Vis/UV photodiodes), rain gauge/snow gauge, scintillation counter (background radiation, fallout, radon), seismometer (earthquakes and tremors), transmissometer (visibility), and a GPS clock for data logging. Upper air data are of crucial importance for weather forecasting. The most widely used technique is launches of radiosondes. Supplementing the radiosondes a network of aircraft collection is organized by the World Meteorological Organization.\nRemote sensing, as used in meteorology, is the concept of collecting data from remote weather events and subsequently producing weather information. The common types of remote sensing are Radar, Lidar, and satellites (or photogrammetry). Each collects data about the atmosphere from a remote location and, usually, stores the data where the instrument is located. Radar and Lidar are not passive because both use EM radiation to illuminate a specific portion of the atmosphere. Weather satellites along with more general-purpose Earth-observing satellites circling the earth at various altitudes have become an indispensable tool for studying a wide range of phenomena from forest fires to El Ni\u00f1o.\nSpatial scales.\nThe study of the atmosphere can be divided into distinct areas that depend on both time and spatial scales. At one extreme of this scale is climatology. In the timescales of hours to days, meteorology separates into micro-, meso-, and synoptic scale meteorology. Respectively, the geospatial size of each of these three scales relates directly with the appropriate timescale.\nOther subclassifications are used to describe the unique, local, or broad effects within those subclasses.\nMicroscale.\nMicroscale meteorology is the study of atmospheric phenomena on a scale of about or less. Individual thunderstorms, clouds, and local turbulence caused by buildings and other obstacles (such as individual hills) are modeled on this scale. Misoscale meteorology is an informal subdivision.\nMesoscale.\nMesoscale meteorology is the study of atmospheric phenomena that has horizontal scales ranging from 1\u00a0km to 1000\u00a0km and a vertical scale that starts at the Earth's surface and includes the atmospheric boundary layer, troposphere, tropopause, and the lower section of the stratosphere. The terms meso-alpha, meso-beta, and meso-gamma to classify the horizontal scales of atmospheric processes were introduced to the field of mesoscale meteorology by Isidoro Orlanski. Mesoscale timescales last from less than a day to multiple weeks. The events typically of interest are thunderstorms, squall lines, fronts, precipitation bands in tropical and extratropical cyclones, and topographically generated weather systems such as mountain waves and sea and land breezes.\nSynoptic scale.\nSynoptic scale meteorology predicts atmospheric changes at scales up to 1000\u00a0km and 105 sec ~ (2.8 days), in time and space. At the synoptic scale, the Coriolis acceleration acting on moving air masses (outside of the tropics) plays a dominant role in predictions. The phenomena typically described by synoptic meteorology include events such as extratropical cyclones, baroclinic troughs and ridges, frontal zones, and to some extent jet streams. All of these are typically given on weather maps for a specific time. The minimum horizontal scale of synoptic phenomena is limited to the spacing between surface observation stations.\nGlobal scale.\nGlobal scale meteorology is the study of weather patterns related to the transport of heat from the tropics to the poles. Very large scale oscillations are of importance at this scale. These oscillations have time periods typically on the order of months, such as the Madden\u2013Julian oscillation, or years, such as the El Ni\u00f1o\u2013Southern Oscillation and the Pacific decadal oscillation. Global scale meteorology pushes into the range of climatology. The traditional definition of climate is pushed into larger timescales and with the understanding of the longer time scale global oscillations, their effect on climate and weather disturbances can be included in the synoptic and mesoscale timescales predictions.\nNumerical Weather Prediction is a main focus in understanding air\u2013sea interaction, tropical meteorology, atmospheric predictability, and tropospheric/stratospheric processes. The Naval Research Laboratory in Monterey, California, developed a global atmospheric model called Navy Operational Global Atmospheric Prediction System (NOGAPS). NOGAPS is run operationally at Fleet Numerical Meteorology and Oceanography Center for the United States Military. Many other global atmospheric models are run by national meteorological agencies.\nBranches of meteorology.\nBased on methodological approach.\nPhysical meteorology.\nPhysical meteorology studies the atmosphere's physical properties, processes, and phenomena. It covers the fundamental principles of atmospheric thermodynamics and energy transfer, including solar and terrestrial radiation (absorption, reflection, and scattering). Cloud physics is another key area of investigation, alongside the study of aerosols, precipitation formation, and atmospheric moist processes. The field further examines optical, electrical, and acoustical effects within the atmosphere. Near-surface processes like mixing, turbulence, and friction, and understanding their connection to the atmosphere's physical characteristics also fall within its scope.\nDynamic meteorology.\nDynamic meteorology is the study of atmospheric motions and the physical laws that govern them, using principles drawn from fluid dynamics, thermodynamics and mechanical motion. It aims to explain why the atmosphere moves and how its state evolves. Here, the fundamental analytical unit of atmospheric behavior is an \"air parcel\", defined as an infinitesimally small region in the fluid continuum of the atmosphere. This key conceptual tool allows for abstraction from the atmosphere's discrete molecular and chemical nature. Temperature, density, pressure, etc. are considered key physical quantities with unique values within this atmospheric continuum. These characterize the state of the atmosphere.\nSynoptic meteorology.\nSynoptic meteorology focuses on diagnosing the conditions of the atmosphere at a given moment across large regions. This branch involves the preparation of various weather maps displaying meteorological conditions observed simultaneously (hence the term \"synoptic,\" meaning \"viewed together\"). Examples of such maps include upper-air charts, aerological diagrams, and satellite imagery of cloud movement. Through detailed analysis of these charts, meteorologists aim to understand large-scale wind and pressure systems, as well as the complex relationship between atmospheric circulation and the regional surface environment. The primary objective of the field is to predict atmospheric changes from these initial conditions, typically for a few hours to a few days ahead. The ultimate goal is to help produce regional or station-based forecasts.\nBased on scale.\nBoundary layer meteorology.\nBoundary layer meteorology is the study of processes in the air layer directly above Earth's surface, known as the atmospheric boundary layer (ABL). The effects of the surface\u00a0\u2013 heating, cooling, and friction\u00a0\u2013 cause turbulent mixing within the air layer. Significant movement of heat, matter, or momentum on time scales of less than a day are caused by turbulent motions. Boundary layer meteorology includes the study of all types of surface\u2013atmosphere boundary, including ocean, lake, urban land and non-urban land for the study of meteorology.\nApplications.\nWeather forecasting.\nWeather forecasting is the application of science and technology to predict the state of the atmosphere at a future time and given location. Humans have attempted to predict the weather informally for millennia and formally since at least the 19th century. Weather forecasts are made by collecting quantitative data about the current state of the atmosphere and using scientific understanding of atmospheric processes to project how the atmosphere will evolve.\nOnce an all-human endeavor based mainly upon changes in barometric pressure, current weather conditions, and sky condition, forecast models are now used to determine future conditions. Human input is still required to pick the best possible forecast model to base the forecast upon, which involves pattern recognition skills, teleconnections, knowledge of model performance, and knowledge of model biases. The chaotic nature of the atmosphere, the massive computational power required to solve the equations that describe the atmosphere, error involved in measuring the initial conditions, and an incomplete understanding of atmospheric processes mean that forecasts become less accurate as the difference in current time and the time for which the forecast is being made (the \"range\" of the forecast) increases. The use of ensembles and model consensus help narrow the error and pick the most likely outcome.\nThere are a variety of end uses to weather forecasts. Weather warnings are important forecasts because they are used to protect life and property. Forecasts based on temperature and precipitation are important to agriculture, and therefore to commodity traders within stock markets. Temperature forecasts are used by utility companies to estimate demand over coming days. On an everyday basis, people use weather forecasts to determine what to wear. Since outdoor activities are severely curtailed by heavy rain, snow, and wind chill, forecasts can be used to plan activities around these events, and to plan ahead and survive them.\nAviation meteorology.\nAviation meteorology deals with the impact of weather on air traffic management and flight operations. It is important for aircrews to understand meteorological conditions affecting flight planning and in-flight safety. Weather phenomena such as turbulence, icing, thunderstorms, and reduced visibility are major hazards to aviation and are included in standardized pilot training syllabi worldwide. In India, the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) includes meteorology as a compulsory subject in pilot licensing examinations.\nAgricultural meteorology.\nMeteorologists, soil scientists, agricultural hydrologists, and agronomists are people concerned with studying the effects of weather and climate on plant distribution, crop yield, water-use efficiency, phenology of plant and animal development, and the energy balance of managed and natural ecosystems. Conversely, they are interested in the role of vegetation on climate and weather.\nHydrometeorology.\nHydrometeorology is the branch of meteorology that deals with the hydrologic cycle, the water budget, and the rainfall statistics of storms. A hydrometeorologist prepares and issues forecasts of accumulating (quantitative) precipitation, heavy rain, heavy snow, and highlights areas with the potential for flash flooding. Typically the range of knowledge that is required overlaps with climatology, mesoscale and synoptic meteorology, and other geosciences.\nNuclear meteorology.\nNuclear meteorology investigates the distribution of radioactive aerosols and gases in the atmosphere.\nMaritime meteorology.\nMaritime meteorology deals with air and wave forecasts for ships operating at sea. Organizations such as the Ocean Prediction Center, Honolulu National Weather Service forecast office, United Kingdom Met Office, KNMI and JMA prepare high seas forecasts for the world's oceans.\nMilitary meteorology.\nMilitary meteorology is the research and application of meteorology for military purposes. In the United States, the United States Navy's Commander, Naval Meteorology and Oceanography Command oversees meteorological efforts for the Navy and Marine Corps while the United States Air Force's Air Force Weather Agency is responsible for the Air Force and Army.\nEnvironmental meteorology.\nEnvironmental meteorology mainly analyzes industrial pollution dispersion physically and chemically based on meteorological parameters such as temperature, humidity, wind, and various weather conditions.\nRenewable energy.\nMeteorology applications in renewable energy includes basic research, \"exploration\", and potential mapping of wind power and solar radiation for wind and solar energy.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nExternal links.\n\"Please see weather forecasting for weather forecast sites.\""}

{"id": "19916", "revid": "10274643", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19916", "title": "Meitnerium", "text": "element with atomic number 109 (Mt)\nMeitnerium is a synthetic chemical element; it has symbol Mt and atomic number 109. It is an extremely radioactive synthetic element (an element not found in nature, but can be created in a laboratory). The most stable known isotope, meitnerium-278, has a half-life of 4.5 seconds, although the unconfirmed meitnerium-282 may have a longer half-life of 67 seconds. The element was first synthesized in August 1982 by the GSI Helmholtz Centre for Heavy Ion Research near Darmstadt, Germany, and it was named after the Austrian-Swedish nuclear physicist Lise Meitner in 1997. \nIn the periodic table, meitnerium is a d-block transactinide element. It is a member of the 7th period and is placed in the group 9 elements, although no chemical experiments have yet been carried out to confirm that it behaves as the heavier homologue to iridium in group 9 as the seventh member of the 6d series of transition metals. Meitnerium is calculated to have properties similar to its lighter homologues, cobalt, rhodium, and iridium.\nHistory.\nDiscovery.\nMeitnerium was first synthesized on August 29, 1982, by a German research team led by Peter Armbruster and Gottfried M\u00fcnzenberg at the Institute for Heavy Ion Research (Gesellschaft f\u00fcr Schwerionenforschung) in Darmstadt. The team bombarded a target of bismuth-209 with accelerated nuclei of iron-58 and detected a single atom of the isotope meitnerium-266:\nBi + Fe \u2192 Mt + \nThis work was confirmed three years later at the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research at Dubna (then in the Soviet Union).\nNaming.\nUsing Mendeleev's nomenclature for unnamed and undiscovered elements, meitnerium should be known as \"eka-iridium\". In 1979, during the Transfermium Wars (but before the synthesis of meitnerium), IUPAC published recommendations according to which the element was to be called \"unnilennium\" (with the corresponding symbol of \"Une\"), a systematic element name as a placeholder, until the element was discovered (and the discovery then confirmed) and a permanent name was decided on. Although widely used in the chemical community on all levels, from chemistry classrooms to advanced textbooks, the recommendations were mostly ignored among scientists in the field, who either called it \"element 109\", with the symbol of \"E109\", \"(109)\" or even simply \"109\", or used the proposed name \"meitnerium\".\nThe naming of meitnerium was discussed in the element naming controversy regarding the names of elements 104 to 109, but \"meitnerium\" was the only proposal and thus was never disputed. The name \"meitnerium\" (Mt) was suggested by the GSI team in September 1992 in honor of the Austrian physicist Lise Meitner, a co-discoverer of protactinium (with Otto Hahn), and one of the discoverers of nuclear fission. In 1994 the name was recommended by IUPAC, and was officially adopted in 1997. It is thus the only element named specifically after a non-mythological woman (curium being named for both Pierre and Marie Curie).\nIsotopes.\nMeitnerium has no stable or naturally occurring isotopes. Several radioactive isotopes have been synthesized in the laboratory, either by fusing two atoms or by observing the decay of heavier elements. Eight different isotopes of meitnerium have been reported with mass numbers 266, 268, 270, and 274\u2013278, two of which, meitnerium-268 and meitnerium-270, have unconfirmed metastable states. A ninth isotope with mass number 282 is unconfirmed. Most of these decay predominantly through alpha decay, although some undergo spontaneous fission.\nStability and half-lives.\nAll meitnerium isotopes are extremely unstable and radioactive; in general, heavier isotopes are more stable than the lighter. The most stable known meitnerium isotope, 278Mt, is also the heaviest known; it has a half-life of 4.5\u00a0seconds. The unconfirmed 282Mt is even heavier and appears to have a longer half-life of 67\u00a0seconds. With a half-life of 0.8\u00a0seconds, the next most stable known isotope is 270Mt. The isotopes 276Mt and 274Mt have half-lives of 0.62 and 0.64\u00a0seconds respectively.\nThe isotope 277Mt, created as the final decay product of 293Ts for the first time in 2012, was observed to undergo spontaneous fission with a half-life of 5 milliseconds. Preliminary data analysis considered the possibility of this fission event instead originating from 277Hs, for it also has a half-life of a few milliseconds, and could be populated following undetected electron capture somewhere along the decay chain. This possibility was later deemed very unlikely based on observed decay energies of 281Ds and 281Rg and the short half-life of 277Mt, although there is still some uncertainty of the assignment. Regardless, the rapid fission of 277Mt and 277Hs is strongly suggestive of a region of instability for superheavy nuclei with \"N\"\u00a0=\u00a0168\u2013170. The existence of this region, characterized by a decrease in fission barrier height between the deformed shell closure at \"N\"\u00a0=\u00a0162 and spherical shell closure at \"N\"\u00a0=\u00a0184, is consistent with theoretical models.\nPredicted properties.\nOther than nuclear properties, no properties of meitnerium or its compounds have been measured; this is due to its extremely limited and expensive production and the fact that meitnerium and its parents decay very quickly. Properties of meitnerium metal remain unknown and only predictions are available.\nChemical.\nMeitnerium is the seventh member of the 6d series of transition metals, and should be much like the platinum group metals. Calculations on its ionization potentials and atomic and ionic radii are similar to that of its lighter homologue iridium, thus implying that meitnerium's basic properties will resemble those of the other group 9 elements, cobalt, rhodium, and iridium.\nPrediction of the probable chemical properties of meitnerium has not received much attention recently. Meitnerium is expected to be a noble metal. The standard electrode potential for the Mt3+/Mt couple is expected to be 0.8\u00a0V. Based on the most stable oxidation states of the lighter group 9 elements, the most stable oxidation states of meitnerium are predicted to be the +6, +3, and +1 states, with the +3 state being the most stable in aqueous solutions. In comparison, rhodium and iridium show a maximum oxidation state of +6, while the most stable states are +4 and +3 for iridium and +3 for rhodium. The oxidation state +9, represented only by iridium in [IrO4]+, might be possible for its congener meitnerium in the nonafluoride (MtF9) and the [MtO4]+ cation, although [IrO4]+ is expected to be more stable than these meitnerium compounds. The tetrahalides of meitnerium have also been predicted to have similar stabilities to those of iridium, thus also allowing a stable +4 state. It is further expected that the maximum oxidation states of elements from bohrium (element 107) to darmstadtium (element 110) may be stable in the gas phase but not in aqueous solution.\nPhysical and atomic.\nMeitnerium is expected to be a solid under normal conditions and assume a face-centered cubic crystal structure, similarly to its lighter congener iridium. It should be a very heavy metal with a density of around 27\u201328\u00a0g/cm3, which would be among the highest of any of the 118 known elements. Meitnerium is also predicted to be paramagnetic.\nTheoreticians have predicted the covalent radius of meitnerium to be 6 to 10\u00a0pm larger than that of iridium. The atomic radius of meitnerium is expected to be around 128\u00a0pm.\nExperimental chemistry.\nMeitnerium is the first element on the periodic table whose chemistry has not yet been investigated. Unambiguous determination of the chemical characteristics of meitnerium has yet to have been established due to the short half-lives of meitnerium isotopes and a limited number of likely volatile compounds that could be studied on a very small scale. One of the few meitnerium compounds that are likely to be sufficiently volatile is meitnerium hexafluoride (MtF6), as its lighter homologue iridium hexafluoride (IrF6) is volatile above 60\u00a0\u00b0C and therefore the analogous compound of meitnerium might also be sufficiently volatile; a volatile octafluoride (MtF8) might also be possible. For chemical studies to be carried out on a transactinide, at least four atoms must be produced, the half-life of the isotope used must be at least 1\u00a0second, and the rate of production must be at least one atom per week. Even though the half-life of 278Mt, the most stable confirmed meitnerium isotope, is 4.5\u00a0seconds, long enough to perform chemical studies, another obstacle is the need to increase the rate of production of meitnerium isotopes and allow experiments to carry on for weeks or months so that statistically significant results can be obtained. Separation and detection must be carried out continuously to separate out the meitnerium isotopes and have automated systems experiment on the gas-phase and solution chemistry of meitnerium, as the yields for heavier elements are predicted to be smaller than those for lighter elements; some of the separation techniques used for bohrium and hassium could be reused. However, the experimental chemistry of meitnerium has not received as much attention as that of the heavier elements from copernicium to livermorium.\nThe Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory attempted to synthesize the isotope 271Mt in 2002\u20132003 for a possible chemical investigation of meitnerium, because it was expected that it might be more stable than nearby isotopes due to having 162 neutrons, a magic number for deformed nuclei; its half-life was predicted to be a few seconds, long enough for a chemical investigation. However, no atoms of 271Mt were detected; this isotope of meitnerium is currently unknown.\nAn experiment determining the chemical properties of a transactinide would need to compare a compound of that transactinide with analogous compounds of some of its lighter homologues: for example, in the chemical characterization of hassium, hassium tetroxide (HsO4) was compared with the analogous osmium compound, osmium tetroxide (OsO4). In a preliminary step towards determining the chemical properties of meitnerium, the GSI attempted sublimation of the rhodium compounds rhodium(III) oxide (Rh2O3) and rhodium(III) chloride (RhCl3). However, macroscopic amounts of the oxide would not sublimate until 1000\u00a0\u00b0C and the chloride would not until 780\u00a0\u00b0C, and then only in the presence of carbon aerosol particles: these temperatures are far too high for such procedures to be used on meitnerium, as most of the current methods used for the investigation of the chemistry of superheavy elements do not work above 500\u00a0\u00b0C.\nFollowing the 2014 successful synthesis of seaborgium hexacarbonyl, Sg(CO)6, studies were conducted with the stable transition metals of groups 7 through 9, suggesting that carbonyl formation could be extended to further probe the chemistries of the early 6d transition metals from rutherfordium to meitnerium inclusive. Nevertheless, the challenges of low half-lives and difficult production reactions make meitnerium difficult to access for radiochemists, though the isotopes 278Mt and 276Mt are long-lived enough for chemical research and may be produced in the decay chains of 294Ts and 288Mc respectively. 276Mt is likely more suitable, since producing tennessine requires a rare and rather short-lived berkelium target. The isotope 270Mt, observed in the decay chain of 278Nh with a half-life of 0.69 seconds, may also be sufficiently long-lived for chemical investigations, though a direct synthesis route leading to this isotope and more precise measurements of its decay properties would be required.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Its recommended unit symbol is MB. The unit prefix \"mega\" is a multiplier of (106) in the International System of Units (SI). Therefore, one megabyte is one million bytes of information. This definition has been incorporated into the International System of Quantities.\nIn the computer and information technology fields, other definitions have been used that arose for historical reasons of convenience. A common usage has been to designate one megabyte as (220 B), a quantity that conveniently expresses the binary architecture of digital computer memory. Standards bodies have deprecated this binary usage of the mega- prefix in favor of a new set of binary prefixes, by means of which the quantity 220 B is named mebibyte (symbol MiB).\nDefinitions.\nThe unit megabyte is commonly used for 10002 (one million) bytes or 10242 bytes. The interpretation of using base 1024 originated as technical jargon for the byte multiples that needed to be expressed by the powers of 2 but lacked a convenient name. As 1024 (210) approximates 1000 (103), roughly corresponding to the SI prefix kilo-, it was a convenient term to denote the binary multiple. In 1999, the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) published standards for binary prefixes requiring the use of \"megabyte\" to denote 10002 bytes, and \"mebibyte\" to denote 10242 bytes. By the end of 2009, the IEC Standard had been adopted by the IEEE, EU, ISO and NIST. Nevertheless, the term megabyte continues to be widely used with different meanings.\n 1 MB = bytes (= 10002 B = 106 B) is the definition following the rules of the International System of Units (SI), and the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC). This definition is used in computer networking contexts and most storage media, particularly hard drives, flash-based storage, and DVDs, and is also consistent with the other uses of the SI prefix in computing, such as CPU clock speeds or measures of performance. The Mac OS X 10.6 file manager is a notable example of this usage in software. Since Snow Leopard, file sizes are reported in decimal units.\nBase 10.\nIn this convention, one thousand megabytes (1000\u00a0MB) is equal to one gigabyte (1\u00a0GB), where 1\u00a0GB is one billion bytes.\n 1 MB = bytes (= 10242\u00a0B = 220\u00a0B) is the definition used by Microsoft Windows in reference to computer memory, such as random-access memory (RAM). This definition is synonymous with the unambiguous binary unit mebibyte. In this convention, one thousand and twenty-four megabytes (1024\u00a0MB) is equal to one gigabyte (1\u00a0GB), where 1\u00a0GB is 10243 bytes (i.e., 1\u00a0GiB).\n 1 MB = bytes (= 1000\u00d71024 B) is the definition used to describe the formatted capacity of the 1.44\u00a0MB HD floppy disk, which actually has a capacity of .\nMixed.\nRandomly addressable semiconductor memory doubles in size for each address lane added to an integrated circuit package, which favors counts that are powers of two. The capacity of a disk drive is the product of the sector size, number of sectors per track, number of tracks per side, and the number of disk platters in the drive. Changes in any of these factors would not usually double the size.\nExamples of use.\nDepending on compression methods and file format, a megabyte of data can roughly be:\nThe novel \"The Picture of Dorian Gray\", by Oscar Wilde, hosted on Project Gutenberg as an uncompressed plain text file, is 0.429 MB. \"Great Expectations\" is 0.994 MB, and \"Moby Dick\" is 1.192 MB. \nThe human genome consists of DNA representing 800MB of data. The parts that differentiate one person from another can be compressed to 4MB.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

By definition they have two or more carbon-carbon bonds. More specifically, they are classified as polyhydroxy aldehydes or polyhydroxy ketones with the respective formulas H-[CHOH]n-CHO and H-[CHOH]m-CO-[CHOH]n-H. Monosaccharides can be classified by the number \"x\" of carbon atoms they contain: triose (3), tetrose (4), pentose (5), hexose (6), heptose (7), and so on.\nThey are colorless, water-soluble, and crystalline organic solids. Contrary to their name (sugars), only some monosaccharides have a sweet taste. Most monosaccharides have the formula (though not all molecules with this formula are monosaccharides).\nExamples of monosaccharides include glucose (dextrose), fructose (levulose), and galactose. Monosaccharides are the building blocks of disaccharides (such as sucrose, lactose and maltose) and polysaccharides (such as cellulose and starch). The table sugar used in everyday vernacular is a disaccharide sucrose derived from the condensation of one molecule of each of the monosaccharides D-glucose and D-fructose.\nThe monosaccharide glucose plays a pivotal role in metabolism, where the chemical energy is extracted through glycolysis and the citric acid cycle to provide energy to living organisms. Maltose is the dehydration condensate of two glucose molecules.\nStructure and nomenclature.\nEach carbon atom that supports a hydroxyl group is chiral, except those at the end of the chain. Saccharides of a given formula can exist as a number of isomeric forms. Each form has distinct properties, especially in a biological context. In addition to the many possible isomers for a given formula, each saccharide can exist in at least one cyclic form. The combination of these factors - many \"chiral centers\" and the chain-ring equilibria - gives rise to particularly complicated chemistry.\nWith few exceptions (e.g., deoxyribose), monosaccharides have the chemical formula (CH2O)\"x\", where conventionally \"x\" \u2265 3. \nGlucose, used as an energy source and for the synthesis of starch, glycogen and cellulose, is a hexose. Ribose and deoxyribose (in RNA and DNA, respectively) are pentose sugars. Examples of heptoses include the ketoses mannoheptulose and sedoheptulose. Monosaccharides with eight or more carbons are rarely observed as they are quite unstable. In aqueous solutions monosaccharides exist as rings if they have more than four carbons.\nLinear-chain monosaccharides.\nSimple monosaccharides have a linear and unbranched carbon skeleton with one carbonyl (C=O) functional group, and one hydroxyl (OH) group on each of the remaining carbon atoms. Therefore, the molecular structure of a simple monosaccharide can be written as H(CHOH)\"n\"(C=O)(CHOH)\"m\"H, where \"n\" + 1 + \"m\" \n \"x\"; so that its elemental formula is C\"x\"H2\"x\"O\"x\".\nBy convention, the carbon atoms are numbered from 1 to \"x\" along the backbone, starting from the end that is closest to the C=O group. Monosaccharides are the simplest units of carbohydrates and the simplest form of sugar.\nIf the carbonyl is at position 1 (that is, \"n\" or \"m\" is zero), the molecule begins with a formyl group H(C=O)\u2212 and is technically an aldehyde. In that case, the compound is termed an aldose. Otherwise, the molecule has a ketone group, a carbonyl \u2212(C=O)\u2212 between two carbons; then it is formally a ketone, and is termed a ketose. Ketoses of biological interest usually have the carbonyl at position 2.\nThe various classifications above can be combined, resulting in names such as \"aldohexose\" and \"ketotriose\".\nA more general nomenclature for open-chain monosaccharides combines a Greek prefix to indicate the number of carbons (tri-, tetr-, pent-, hex-, etc.) with the suffixes \"-ose\" for aldoses and \"-ulose\" for ketoses. In the latter case, if the carbonyl is not at position 2, its position is then indicated by a numeric infix. So, for example, H(C=O)(CHOH)4H is pentose, H(CHOH)(C=O)(CHOH)3H is pentulose, and H(CHOH)2(C=O)(CHOH)2H is pent-3-ulose.\nOpen-chain stereoisomers.\nTwo monosaccharides with equivalent molecular graphs (same chain length and same carbonyl position) may still be distinct stereoisomers, whose molecules differ in spatial orientation. This happens only if the molecule contains a stereogenic center, specifically a carbon atom that is chiral (connected to four distinct molecular sub-structures). Those four bonds can have any of two configurations in space distinguished by their handedness. In a simple open-chain monosaccharide, every carbon is chiral except the first and the last atoms of the chain, and (in ketoses) the carbon with the keto group.\nFor example, the triketose H(CHOH)(C=O)(CHOH)H (glycerone, dihydroxyacetone) has no stereogenic center, and therefore exists as a single stereoisomer. The other triose, the aldose H(C=O)(CHOH)2H (glyceraldehyde), has one chiral carbon\u2014the central one, number 2\u2014which is bonded to groups \u2212H, \u2212OH, \u2212C(OH)H2, and \u2212(C=O)H. Therefore, it exists as two enantiomers, whose molecules are mirror images of each other (like a left and a right glove). Monosaccharides with four or more carbons may contain multiple chiral carbons, so they typically have more than two stereoisomers. The number of distinct stereoisomers with the same diagram is bounded by 2\"c\", where \"c\" is the total number of chiral carbons.\nThe Fischer projection is a systematic way of drawing the skeletal formula of an acyclic monosaccharide so that the handedness of each chiral carbon is well specified. Each stereoisomer of a simple open-chain monosaccharide can be identified by the positions (right or left) in the Fischer diagram of the chiral hydroxyls (the hydroxyls attached to the chiral carbons).\nMost stereoisomers are themselves chiral (distinct from their mirror images). In the Fischer projection, two mirror-image isomers differ by having the positions of all chiral hydroxyls reversed right-to-left. Mirror-image isomers are chemically identical in non-chiral environments, but usually have very different biochemical properties and occurrences in nature.\nWhile most stereoisomers can be arranged in pairs of mirror-image forms, there are some non-chiral stereoisomers that are identical to their mirror images, in spite of having chiral centers. This happens whenever the molecular graph is symmetrical, as in the 3-ketopentoses H(CHOH)2(CO)(CHOH)2H, and the two halves are mirror images of each other. In that case, mirroring is equivalent to a half-turn rotation. For this reason, there are only three distinct 3-ketopentose stereoisomers, even though the molecule has two chiral carbons.\nDistinct stereoisomers that are not mirror-images of each other usually have different chemical properties, even in non-chiral environments. Therefore, each mirror pair and each non-chiral stereoisomer may be given a specific monosaccharide name. For example, there are 16 distinct aldohexose stereoisomers, but the name \"glucose\" means a specific pair of mirror-image aldohexoses. In the Fischer projection, one of the two glucose isomers has the hydroxyl at left on C3, and at right on C4 and C5; while the other isomer has the reversed pattern. These specific monosaccharide names have conventional three-letter abbreviations, like \"Glu\" for glucose and \"Thr\" for threose.\nGenerally, a monosaccharide with \"n\" asymmetrical carbons has 2\"n\" stereoisomers. The number of open chain stereoisomers for an aldose monosaccharide is larger by one than that of a ketose monosaccharide of the same length. Every ketose will have 2(\"n\"\u22123) stereoisomers where \"n\" &gt; 2 is the number of carbons. Every aldose will have 2(\"n\"\u22122) stereoisomers where \"n\" &gt; 2 is the number of carbons.\nThese are also referred to as epimers which have the different arrangement of \u2212OH and \u2212H groups at the asymmetric or chiral carbon atoms (this does not apply to those carbons having the carbonyl functional group).\nConfiguration of monosaccharides.\nLike many chiral molecules, the two stereoisomers of glyceraldehyde will gradually rotate the polarization direction of linearly polarized light as it passes through it, even in solution. The two stereoisomers are identified with the prefixes D- and L-, according to the sense of rotation: D-glyceraldehyde is dextrorotatory (rotates the polarization axis clockwise), while L-glyceraldehyde is levorotatory (rotates it counterclockwise).\nThe D- and L- prefixes are also used with other monosaccharides, to distinguish two particular stereoisomers that are mirror-images of each other. For this purpose, one considers the chiral carbon that is furthest removed from the C=O group. Its four bonds must connect to \u2212H, \u2212OH, \u2212CH2(OH), and the rest of the molecule. If the molecule can be rotated in space so that the directions of those four groups match those of the analog groups in D-glyceraldehyde's C2, then the isomer receives the D- prefix. Otherwise, it receives the L- prefix.\nIn the Fischer projection, the D- and L- prefixes specifies the configuration at the carbon atom that is second from bottom: D- if the hydroxyl is on the right side, and L- if it is on the left side.\nNote that the D- and L- prefixes do not indicate the direction of rotation of polarized light, which is a combined effect of the arrangement at all chiral centers. However, the two enantiomers will always rotate the light in opposite directions, by the same amount. See also .\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Visible anchor/styles.css\" /&gt;Cyclisation of monosaccharides (hemiacetal formation).\nA monosaccharide often switches from the acyclic (open-chain) form to a cyclic form, through a nucleophilic addition reaction between the carbonyl group and one of the hydroxyl groups of the same molecule. The reaction creates a ring of carbon atoms closed by one bridging oxygen atom. The resulting molecule has a hemiacetal or hemiketal group, depending on whether the linear form was an aldose or a ketose. The reaction is easily reversed, yielding the original open-chain form.\nIn these cyclic forms, the ring usually has five or six atoms. These forms are called furanoses and pyranoses, respectively\u2014by analogy with furan and pyran, the simplest compounds with the same carbon-oxygen ring (although they lack the double bonds of these two molecules). For example, the aldohexose glucose may form a hemiacetal linkage between the aldehyde group on carbon 1 and the hydroxyl on carbon 4, yielding a molecule with a 5-membered ring, called glucofuranose. The same reaction can take place between carbons 1 and 5 to form a molecule with a 6-membered ring, called glucopyranose. Cyclic forms with a seven-atom ring (the same of oxepane), rarely encountered, are called heptoses.\nFor many monosaccharides (including glucose), the cyclic forms predominate, in the solid state and in solutions, and therefore the same name commonly is used for the open- and closed-chain isomers. Thus, for example, the term \"glucose\" may signify glucofuranose, glucopyranose, the open-chain form, or a mixture of the three.\nCyclization creates a new stereogenic center at the carbonyl-bearing carbon. The \u2212OH group that replaces the carbonyl's oxygen may end up in two distinct positions relative to the ring's midplane. Thus each open-chain monosaccharide yields two cyclic isomers (anomers), denoted by the prefixes \u03b1- and \u03b2-. The molecule can change between these two forms by a process called mutarotation, that consists in a reversal of the ring-forming reaction followed by another ring formation.\nHaworth projection.\nThe stereochemical structure of a cyclic monosaccharide can be represented in a Haworth projection. In this diagram, the \u03b1-isomer for the pyranose form of a D-aldohexose has the \u2212OH of the anomeric carbon below the plane of the carbon atoms, while the \u03b2-isomer has the \u2212OH of the anomeric carbon above the plane. Pyranoses typically adopt a chair conformation, similar to that of cyclohexane. In this conformation, the \u03b1-isomer has the \u2212OH of the anomeric carbon in an axial position, whereas the \u03b2-isomer has the \u2212OH of the anomeric carbon in equatorial position (considering D-aldohexose sugars).\nDerivatives.\nA large number of biologically important modified monosaccharides exist:\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The name is a Latinised form of the Greek word for microscope. Its stars are faint and hardly visible from most of the non-tropical Northern Hemisphere.\nThe constellation's brightest star is Gamma Microscopii of apparent magnitude 4.68, a yellow giant 2.5 times the Sun's mass located 223\u00a0\u00b1\u00a08\u00a0light-years distant. It passed within 1.14 and 3.45 light-years of the Sun some 3.9 million years ago, possibly disturbing the outer Solar System. Three star systems\u2014WASP-7, AU Microscopii and HD\u00a0205739\u2014have been determined to have planets, while other star \u2014the Sun-like star HD 202628\u2014 has a debris disk. AU Microscopii and the binary red dwarf system AT Microscopii are probably a wide triple system and members of the Beta Pictoris moving group. Nicknamed \"Speedy Mic\", BO Microscopii is a star with an extremely fast rotation period of 9\u00a0hours, 7\u00a0minutes.\nCharacteristics.\nMicroscopium is a small constellation bordered by Capricornus to the north, Piscis Austrinus and Grus to the east, Sagittarius to the west, and Indus to the south, touching on Telescopium to the southwest. The recommended three-letter abbreviation for the constellation, as adopted by the International Astronomical Union in 1922, is \"Mic\". The official constellation boundaries, as set by Belgian astronomer Eug\u00e8ne Delporte in 1930, are defined by a polygon of four segments (\"illustrated in infobox\"). In the equatorial coordinate system, the right ascension coordinates of these borders lie between 20h 27.3m and 21h 28.4m, while the declination coordinates are between \u221227.45\u00b0 and \u221245.09\u00b0. The whole constellation is visible to observers south of latitude 45\u00b0N. Given that its brightest stars are of fifth magnitude, the constellation is invisible to the naked eye in areas with light polluted skies.\nFeatures.\nStars.\nFrench astronomer Nicolas-Louis de Lacaille charted and designated ten stars with the Bayer designations Alpha through to Iota in 1756. A star in neighbouring Indus that Lacaille had labelled Nu Indi turned out to be in Microscopium, so Gould renamed it Nu Microscopii. Francis Baily considered Gamma and Epsilon Microscopii to belong to the neighbouring constellation Piscis Austrinus, but subsequent cartographers did not follow this. In his 1725 \"Catalogus Britannicus\", John Flamsteed labelled the stars 1, 2, 3 and 4 Piscis Austrini, which became Gamma Microscopii, HR 8076, HR 8110 and Epsilon Microscopii respectively. Within the constellation's borders, there are 43 stars brighter than or equal to apparent magnitude\u00a06.5.\nDepicting the eyepiece of the microscope is Gamma Microscopii, which\u2014at magnitude of\u00a04.68\u2014is the brightest star in the constellation. Having spent much of its 620-million-year lifespan as a blue-white main sequence star, it has swollen and cooled to become a yellow giant of spectral type G6III, with a diameter ten times that of the Sun. Measurement of its parallax yields a distance of 223 \u00b1 8 light years from Earth. It likely passed within 1.14 and 3.45 light-years of the Sun some 3.9 million years ago, at around 2.5 times the mass of the Sun, it is possibly massive enough and close enough to disturb the Oort cloud. Alpha Microscopii is also an ageing yellow giant star of spectral type G7III with an apparent magnitude of 4.90. Located 400 \u00b1 30 light-years away from Earth, it has swollen to 17.5\u00a0times the diameter of the Sun. Alpha has a 10th magnitude companion, visible in 7.5\u00a0cm telescopes, though this is a coincidental closeness rather than a true binary system. Epsilon Microscopii lies 166 \u00b1 5 light-years away, and is a white star of apparent magnitude 4.7, and spectral type A1V. Theta1 and Theta2 Microscopii make up a wide double whose components are splittable to the naked eye. Both are white A-class magnetic spectrum variable stars with strong metallic lines, similar to Cor Caroli. They mark the constellation's specimen slide.\nMany notable objects are too faint to be seen with the naked eye. AX Microscopii, better known as Lacaille 8760, is a red dwarf which lies only 12.9\u00a0light-years from the Solar System. At magnitude 6.68, it is the brightest red dwarf in the sky. BO Microscopii is a rapidly rotating star that has 80% the diameter of the Sun. Nicknamed \"Speedy Mic\", it has a rotation period of 9\u00a0hours 7\u00a0minutes. An active star, it has prominent stellar flares that average 100\u00a0times stronger than those of the Sun, and are emitting energy mainly in the X-ray and ultraviolet bands of the spectrum. It lies 218 \u00b1 4 light-years away from the Sun. AT Microscopii is a binary star system, both members of which are flare star red dwarfs. The system lies close to and may form a very wide triple system with AU Microscopii, a young star which has a planetary system in the making with a debris disk. The three stars are candidate members of the Beta Pictoris moving group, one of the nearest associations of stars that share a common motion through space.\nThe Astronomical Society of Southern Africa in 2003 reported that observations of four of the Mira variables in Microscopium were very urgently needed as data on their light curves was incomplete. Two of them\u2014R and S Microscopii\u2014are challenging stars for novice amateur astronomers, and the other two, U and RY Microscopii, are more difficult still. Another red giant, T Microscopii, is a semiregular variable that ranges between magnitudes 7.7 and 9.6 over 344 days. Of apparent magnitude 11, DD Microscopii is a symbiotic star system composed of an orange giant of spectral type K2III and white dwarf in close orbit, with the smaller star ionizing the stellar wind of the larger star. The system has a low metallicity. Combined with its high galactic latitude, this indicates that the star system has its origin in the galactic halo of the Milky Way.\nHD 205739 is a yellow-white main sequence star of spectral type F7V that is around 1.22\u00a0times as massive and 2.3\u00a0times as luminous as the Sun. It has a Jupiter-sized planet with an orbital period of 280\u00a0days that was discovered by the radial velocity method. WASP-7 is a star of spectral type F5V with an apparent magnitude of 9.54, about 1.28\u00a0times as massive as the Sun. Its hot Jupiter planet\u2014WASP-7b\u2014was discovered by transit method and found to orbit the star every 4.95\u00a0days. HD 202628 is a sunlike star of spectral type G2V with a debris disk that ranges from 158 to 220 AU distant. Its inner edge is sharply defined, indicating a probable planet orbiting between 86 and 158\u00a0AU from the star.\nDeep sky objects.\nDescribing Microscopium as \"totally unremarkable\", astronomer Patrick Moore concluded there was nothing of interest for amateur observers. NGC 6925 is a barred spiral galaxy of apparent magnitude 11.3 which is lens-shaped, as it lies almost edge-on to observers on Earth, 3.7 degrees west-northwest of Alpha Microscopii. SN 2011ei, a Type II Supernova in NGC 6925, was discovered by Stu Parker in New Zealand in July 2011. NGC 6923 lies nearby and is a magnitude fainter still. The Microscopium Void is a roughly rectangular region of relatively empty space, bounded by incomplete sheets of galaxies from other voids. The Microscopium Supercluster is an overdensity of galaxy clusters that was first noticed in the early 1990s. The component Abell clusters 3695 and 3696 are likely to be gravitationally bound, while the relations of Abell clusters 3693 and 3705 in the same field are unclear.\nMeteor showers.\nThe Microscopids are a minor meteor shower that appear from June to mid-July.\nHistory.\nMicroscopium lies in a region where Ptolemy had listed six 'unformed' stars behind the tail of Piscis Austrinus. Al-Sufi did not include these stars in his revision of the \"Almagest\", presumably because he could not identify them. Microscopium was introduced in 1751\u201352 by Lacaille with the French name \"le Microscope\", after he had observed and catalogued 10,000 southern stars during a two-year stay at the Cape of Good Hope. He devised fourteen new constellations in uncharted regions of the Southern Celestial Hemisphere not visible from Europe. All but one honoured instruments that symbolised the Age of Enlightenment. Commemorating the compound microscope, the Microscope's name had been Latinised by Lacaille to \"Microscopium\" by 1763.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The member galaxies are mostly concentrated around either IC 342 or Maffei 1, which would be the brightest two galaxies in the group. The group is part of the Virgo Supercluster. However, recent studies have found that the two subgroups are unrelated; while the IC 342 group is the nearest galaxy group to the Milky Way, the Maffei 1 group is several times farther away, and is not gravitationally bound to the IC 342 group.\nMembers.\nThe table below lists galaxies that have been identified as associated with the IC342/Maffei 1 Group by I. D. Karachentsev. Note that Karachentsev divides this group into two subgroups centered around IC 342 and Maffei 1.\nAdditionally, KKH 37 is listed as possibly being a member of the IC 342 Subgroup, and KKH 6 is listed as possibly being a member of the Maffei 1 Subgroup.\nForeground dust obscuration.\nAs seen from Earth, the group lies near the plane of the Milky Way (a region sometimes called the Zone of Avoidance). Consequently, the light from many of the galaxies is severely affected by dust obscuration within the Milky Way. This complicates observational studies of the group, as uncertainties in the dust obscuration also affect measurements of the galaxies' luminosities and distances as well as other related quantities.\nMoreover, the galaxies within the group have historically been difficult to identify. Many galaxies have only been discovered using late 20th century astronomical instrumentation. For example, Maffei 1 and Maffei 2 were only discovered in 1968 using infrared photographic images of the region. Furthermore, it is difficult to determine whether some objects near IC 342 or Maffei 1 are galaxies associated with the IC 342/Maffei Group or diffuse foreground objects within the Milky Way that merely look like galaxies. For example, the objects MB 2 and Camelopardalis C were once thought to be dwarf galaxies in the IC 342/Maffei Group but are now known to be objects within the Milky Way.\nGroup formation and possible interactions with the Local Group.\nSince the IC 342/Maffei Group and the Local Group are located physically close to each other, the two groups may have influenced each other's evolution during the early stages of galaxy formation. An analysis of the velocities and distances to the IC 342/Maffei Group as measured by M. J. Valtonen and collaborators suggested that IC 342 and Maffei 1 were moving faster than what could be accounted for in the expansion of the universe. They therefore suggested that IC 342 and Maffei 1 were ejected from the Local Group after a violent gravitational interaction with the Andromeda Galaxy during the early stages of the formation of the two groups.\nHowever, this interpretation is dependent on the distances measured to the galaxies in the group, which in turn is dependent on accurately measuring the degree to which interstellar dust in the Milky Way obscures the group. More recent observations have demonstrated that the dust obscuration may have been previously overestimated, so the distances may have been underestimated. If these new distance measurements are correct, then the galaxies in the IC 342/Maffei Group appear to be moving at the rate expected from the expansion of the universe, and the scenario of a collision between the IC 342/Maffei Group and the Local Group would be implausible.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "19930", "revid": "1318087775", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19930", "title": "Metre (poetry)", "text": "Basic rhythmic structure of a verse or lines in verse\nIn poetry, metre (Commonwealth spelling) or meter (American spelling; see spelling differences) is the basic rhythmic structure of a verse or lines in verse. Many traditional verse forms prescribe a specific verse metre, or a certain set of metres alternating in a particular order. The study and the actual use of metres and forms of versification are both known as prosody. (Within linguistics, \"prosody\" is used in a more general sense that includes not only poetic metre but also the rhythmic aspects of prose, whether formal or informal, that vary from language to language, and sometimes between poetic traditions.)\nCharacteristics.\nAn assortment of features can be identified when classifying poetry and its metre.\nQualitative versus quantitative metre.\nThe metre of most poetry of the Western world and elsewhere is based on patterns of syllables of particular types. The familiar type of metre in English-language poetry is called qualitative metre, with stressed syllables coming at regular intervals (e.g. in iambic pentameters, usually every even-numbered syllable). Many Romance languages use a scheme that is somewhat similar but where the position of only one particular stressed syllable (e.g. the last) needs to be fixed. The alliterative metre of the old Germanic poetry of languages such as Old Norse and Old English was radically different, but was still based on stress patterns.\nSome classical languages, in contrast, used a different scheme known as quantitative metre, where patterns were based on syllable weight rather than stress. In the dactylic hexameters of Classical Latin and Classical Greek, for example, each of the six feet making up the line was either a dactyl (long-short-short) or a spondee (long-long): a \"long syllable\" was literally one that took longer to pronounce than a short syllable: specifically, a syllable consisting of a long vowel or diphthong or followed by two consonants. The stress pattern of the words made no difference to the metre. A number of other ancient languages also used quantitative metre, such as Sanskrit, Persian, Old Church Slavonic and Classical Arabic (but not Biblical Hebrew).\nFinally, non-stressed languages that have little or no differentiation of syllable length, such as French or Chinese, base their verses on the number of syllables only. The most common form in French is the , with twelve syllables a verse, and in classical Chinese five characters, and thus five syllables. But since each Chinese character is pronounced using one syllable in a certain tone, classical Chinese poetry also had more strictly defined rules, such as thematic parallelism or tonal antithesis between lines.\nFeet.\nIn many Western classical poetic traditions, the metre of a verse can be described as a sequence of \"feet\", each foot being a specific sequence of syllable types\u00a0\u2013 such as relatively unstressed/stressed (the norm for English poetry) or long/short (as in most classical Latin and Greek poetry).\nIambic pentameter, a common metre in English poetry, is based on a sequence of five \"iambic feet\" or \"iambs\", each consisting of a relatively unstressed syllable (here represented with \"\u02d8\" above the syllable) followed by a relatively stressed one (here represented with \"/\" above the syllable)\u00a0\u2013 \"da-DUM\"=\"\u02d8 /\":\nThis approach to analyzing and classifying metres originates from Ancient Greek tragedians and poets such as Homer, Pindar, Hesiod, and Sappho.\nHowever some metres have an overall rhythmic pattern to the line that cannot easily be described using feet. This occurs in Sanskrit poetry; see Vedic metre and Sanskrit metre. It also occurs in some Western metres, such as the hendecasyllable favoured by Catullus and Martial, which can be described as:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Block indent/styles.css\"/&gt;x x \u2014 \u222a \u222a \u2014 \u222a \u2014 \u222a \u2014 \u2014\nDisyllables.\n\"Macron and breve notation: \"\u2013 = stressed/long syllable, \u25e1 = unstressed/short syllable\nTetrasyllables.\nIf the line has only one foot, it is called a \"monometer\"; two feet, \"dimeter\"; three is \"trimeter\"; four is \"tetrameter\"; five is \"pentameter\"; six is \"hexameter\", seven is \"heptameter\" and eight is \"octameter\". For example, if the feet are iambs, and if there are five feet to a line, then it is called an iambic pentameter. If the feet are primarily \"dactyls\" and there are six to a line, then it is a dactylic hexameter.\nIn classical Greek and Latin, however, the name \"iambic trimeter\" refers to a line with six iambic feet.\nCaesura.\nSometimes a natural pause occurs in the middle of a line rather than at a line-break. This is a caesura (cut). A good example is from \"The Winter's Tale\" by William Shakespeare; the caesurae are indicated by '/':\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nIn Latin and Greek poetry, a caesura is a break within a foot caused by the end of a word.\nEach line of traditional Germanic alliterative verse is divided into two half-lines by a caesura. This can be seen in \"Piers Plowman\":\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nEnjambment.\nBy contrast with caesura, enjambment is incomplete syntax at the end of a line; the meaning runs over from one poetic line to the next, without terminal punctuation. Also from Shakespeare's \"The Winter's Tale\":\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nMetric variations.\nPoems with a well-defined overall metric pattern often have a few lines that violate that pattern. A common variation is the \"inversion\" of a foot, which turns an iamb (\"da-DUM\") into a trochee (\"DUM-da\"). A second variation is a \"headless\" verse, which lacks the first syllable of the first foot. A third variation is catalexis, where the end of a line is shortened by a foot, or two or part thereof\u00a0\u2013 an example of this is at the end of each verse in Keats' \"La Belle Dame sans Merci\":\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nModern English.\nMost English metre is classified according to the same system as Classical metre with an important difference. English is an accentual language, and therefore beats and offbeats (stressed and unstressed syllables) take the place of the long and short syllables of classical systems. In most English verse, the metre can be considered as a sort of back beat, against which natural speech rhythms vary expressively. The most common characteristic feet of English verse are the iamb in two syllables and the anapest in three. (See Metrical foot for a complete list of the metrical feet and their names.)\nMetrical systems.\nThe number of metrical systems in English is not agreed upon. The four major types are: accentual verse, accentual-syllabic verse, syllabic verse and quantitative verse. The alliterative verse found in Old English, Middle English, and some modern English poems can be added to this list, as it operates on somewhat different principles than accentual verse. Alliterative verse pairs two phrases (half-lines) joined by alliteration; while there are usually two stresses per half-line, variations in the number of stresses do occur. Accentual verse focuses on the number of stresses in a line, while ignoring the number of offbeats and syllables; accentual-syllabic verse focuses on regulating both the number of stresses and the total number of syllables in a line; syllabic verse only counts the number of syllables in a line; quantitative verse regulates the patterns of long and short syllables (this sort of verse is often considered alien to English). The use of foreign metres in English is all but exceptional.\nFrequently used metres.\nThe most frequently encountered metre of English verse is the iambic pentameter, in which the metrical norm is five iambic feet per line, though metrical substitution is common and rhythmic variations are practically inexhaustible. John Milton's \"Paradise Lost\", most sonnets, and much else besides in English are written in iambic pentameter. Lines of unrhymed iambic pentameter are commonly known as blank verse. Blank verse in the English language is most famously represented in the plays of William Shakespeare and the great works of Milton, though Tennyson (\"Ulysses\", \"The Princess\") and Wordsworth (\"The Prelude\") also make notable use of it.\nA rhymed pair of lines of iambic pentameter make a heroic couplet, a verse form which was used so often in the 18th century that it is now used mostly for humorous effect (although see \"Pale Fire\" for a non-trivial case). The most famous writers of heroic couplets are Dryden and Pope.\nAnother important metre in English is the common metre, also called the \"ballad metre\", which is a four-line stanza, with two pairs of a line of iambic tetrameter followed by a line of iambic trimeter; the rhymes usually fall on the lines of trimeter, although in many instances the tetrameter also rhymes. This is the metre of most of the Border and Scots or English ballads. In hymnody it is called the \"common metre\", as it is the most common of the named hymn metres used to pair many hymn lyrics with melodies, such as \"Amazing Grace\":\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nEmily Dickinson is famous for her frequent use of ballad metre:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nOther languages.\nSanskrit.\nVersification in Classical Sanskrit poetry is of three kinds.\nStandard traditional works on metre are Pingala's and Ked\u0101ra's . The most exhaustive compilations, such as the modern ones by Patwardhan and Velankar contain over 600 metres. This is a substantially larger repertoire than in any other metrical tradition.\nTamil.\nThe versification in Tamil is of 4 types. Venpa, Asiriyapa, Kalipa and \"Vanjipa.\"\n\"Venpa\" is characterized by 4 seers per At\u012b. i.e, 4 words per line. Except the last at\u012b which gets only 3 seer. \"Thirukural\" was written in this \"venpa\" meter.\n\"Asiriyapa\" is characterized by 4 seers in all the at\u012b. It is versified in such a way that the poem feels like reading a prose. It has minimum 3 lines to maximum poet's choice. \"Asiriyapa\" is classified into \"naerisai asiriyapa\" and \"Nilaimantila Asiriyapa\". \nMeter variants (\"paa Inangal\") has been identified for all the 4 meters. The meter variants are \"Thaazhisai\", \"Thurai\", \"Virutham\". The tamil literature has surplus branches exclusively for meters. Still The Tanjore \"Tamil\" University is researching on the \"Tamil\" verses.\nGreek and Latin.\nThe metrical \"feet\" in the classical languages were based on the length of time taken to pronounce each syllable, which were categorized according to their weight as either \"long\" syllables or \"short\" syllables (indicated as \"dum\" and \"di\" below). These are also called \"heavy\" and \"light\" syllables, respectively, to distinguish from long and short vowels. The foot is often compared to a musical measure and the long and short syllables to whole notes and half notes. In English poetry, feet are determined by emphasis rather than length, with stressed and unstressed syllables serving the same function as long and short syllables in classical metre.\nThe basic unit in Greek and Latin prosody is a mora, which is defined as a single short syllable. A long syllable is equivalent to two morae. A long syllable contains either a long vowel, a diphthong, or a short vowel followed by two or more consonants. Various rules of elision sometimes prevent a grammatical syllable from making a full syllable, and certain other lengthening and shortening rules (such as correption) can create long or short syllables in contexts where one would expect the opposite.\nThe most important Classical metre is the dactylic hexameter, the metre of Homer and Virgil. This form uses verses of six feet. The word \"dactyl\" comes from the Greek word \"daktylos\" meaning \"finger\", since there is one long part followed by two short stretches. The first four feet are dactyls (\"daa-duh-duh\"), but can be spondees (\"daa-daa\"). The fifth foot is almost always a dactyl. The sixth foot is either a spondee or a trochee (\"daa-duh\"). The initial syllable of either foot is called the \"ictus\", the basic \"beat\" of the verse. There is usually a caesura after the ictus of the third foot. The opening line of the \"Aeneid\" is a typical line of dactylic hexameter:\nI sing of arms and the man, who first from the shores of Troy...\nIn this example, the first and second feet are dactyls; their first syllables, \"Ar\" and \"rum\" respectively, contain short vowels, but count as long because the vowels are both followed by two consonants. The third and fourth feet are spondees, the first of which is divided by the main caesura of the verse. The fifth foot is a dactyl, as is nearly always the case. The final foot is a spondee.\nThe dactylic hexameter was imitated in English by Henry Wadsworth Longfellow in his poem \"Evangeline\":\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nNotice how the first line:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\"for\"-est pri\nfollows this pattern:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;dum diddy\nAlso important in Greek and Latin poetry is the dactylic pentameter. This was a line of verse, made up of two equal parts, each of which contains two dactyls followed by a long syllable, which counts as a half foot. In this way, the number of feet amounts to five in total. Spondees can take the place of the dactyls in the first half, but never in the second. The long syllable at the close of the first half of the verse always ends a word, giving rise to a caesura.\nDactylic pentameter is never used in isolation. Rather, a line of dactylic pentameter follows a line of dactylic hexameter in the elegiac distich or elegiac couplet, a form of verse that was used for the composition of elegies and other tragic and solemn verse in the Greek and Latin world, as well as love poetry that was sometimes light and cheerful. An example from Ovid's \"Tristia\":\n&lt;poem&gt;\n&lt;/poem&gt;Virgil I merely saw, and the harsh Fates gave Tibullus no time for my friendship.\nThe Greeks and Romans also used a number of lyric metres, which were typically used for shorter poems than elegiacs or hexameter. In Aeolic verse, one important line was called the hendecasyllabic, a line of eleven syllables. This metre was used most often in the Sapphic stanza, named after the Greek poet Sappho, who wrote many of her poems in the form. A hendecasyllabic is a line with a never-varying structure: two trochees, followed by a dactyl, then two more trochees. In the Sapphic stanza, three hendecasyllabics are followed by an \"Adonic\" line, made up of a dactyl and a trochee. This is the form of Catullus 51 (itself an homage to Sappho 31):\n&lt;poem&gt;\n&lt;/poem&gt;He seems to me to be like a god; if it is permitted, he seems above the gods, who sitting across from you gazes at you and hears you again and again.\nThe Sapphic stanza was imitated in English by Algernon Charles Swinburne in a poem he simply called \"Sapphics\":\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nClassical Arabic.\nThe metrical system of Classical Arabic poetry, like those of classical Greek and Latin, is based on the weight of syllables classified as either \"long\" or \"short\". The basic principles of Arabic poetic metre are called () or (), meaning \u201cscience of poetry.\u201d It was put forth by Al-Farahidi (718 - 786 CE), who did so after noticing that poems consisted of repeated syllables in each verse. In his first book, \"\" (), he described 15 types of verse. Al-Akhfash described one extra, the 16th.\nA short syllable contains a short vowel with no following consonants. For example, the word , which syllabifies as \"ka-ta-ba\", contains three short vowels and is made up of three short syllables. A long syllable contains either a long vowel or a short vowel followed by a consonant as is the case in the word which syllabifies as \"mak-t\u016b-bun\". These are the only syllable types possible in Classical Arabic phonology which, by and large, does not allow a syllable to end in more than one consonant or a consonant to occur in the same syllable after a long vowel. In other words, syllables of the type \"-\u0101k-\" or \"-akr-\" are not found in classical Arabic.\nEach verse consists of a certain number of metrical feet ( or ) and a certain combination of possible feet constitutes a metre ().\nThe traditional Arabic practice for writing out a poem's metre is to use a concatenation of various derivations of the verbal root \"F-\u02bf-L\" (). Thus, the following hemistich\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nWould be traditionally scanned as:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nThat is, Romanized and with traditional Western scansion:\n Western: \u23d1 \u2013 \u2013 \u23d1 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u23d1 \u2013 \u2013 \u23d1 \u2013 \u23d1 \u2013\n Verse: \n Mnemonic: fa`\u016blun maf\u0101`\u012blun fa`\u016blun maf\u0101`ilun\nAl-Khal\u012bl b. A\u1e25mad al-Far\u0101h\u012bd\u012b's contribution to the study of Arabic prosody is undeniably significant: he was the first scholar to subject Arabic poetry to a meticulous, painstaking metrical analysis. Unfortunately, he fell short of producing a coherent theory; instead, he was content to merely gather, classify, and categorize the primary data\u2014a first step which, though insufficient, represents no mean accomplishment. Therefore, al-Khal\u012bl has left a formulation of utmost complexity and difficulty which requires immense effort to master; even the accomplished scholar cannot utilize and apply it with ease and total confidence. Dr. Ibr\u0101h\u012bm An\u012bs, one of the most distinguished and celebrated pillars of Arabic literature and the Arabic language in the 20th century, states the issue clearly in his book \"\"\u200a\nI am aware of no [other] branch of Arabic studies which embodies as many [technical] terms as does [al-Khal\u012bl\u2019s] prosody, few and distinct as the meters are: al-Khal\u012bl\u2019s disciples employed a large number of infrequent items, assigning to those items certain technical denotations which\u2014invariably\u2014require definition and explanation. \u2026 As to the rules of metric variation, they are numerous to the extent that they defy memory and impose a taxing course of study. \u2026 In learning them, a student faces severe hardship which obscures all connection with an artistic genre\u2014indeed, the most artistic of all\u2014namely, poetry. \u2026 It is in this fashion that [various] authors dealt with the subject under discussion over a period of eleven centuries: none of them attempted to introduce a new approach or to simplify the rules. \u2026 Is it not time for a new, simple presentation which avoids contrivance, displays close affinity to [the art of] poetry, and perhaps renders the science of prosody palatable as well as manageable?\nIn the 20th and the 21st centuries, numerous scholars have endeavored to supplement al-Khal\u012bl's contribution.\nThe Arabic metres.\nClassical Arabic has sixteen established metres. Though each of them allows for a certain amount of variation, their basic patterns are as follows, using:\nClassical Persian.\nThe terminology for metrical system used in classical and classical-style Persian poetry is the same as that of Classical Arabic, even though these are quite different in both origin and structure. This has led to serious confusion among prosodists, both ancient and modern, as to the true source and nature of the Persian metres, the most obvious error being the assumption that they were copied from Arabic.\nPersian poetry is quantitative, and the metrical patterns are made of long and short syllables, much as in Classical Greek, Latin and Arabic. \"Anceps\" positions in the line, however, that is places where either a long or short syllable can be used (marked \"x\" in the schemes below), are not found in Persian verse except in some metres at the beginning of a line.\nPersian poetry is written in couplets, with each half-line (hemistich) being 10-14 syllables long. Except in the ruba'i (quatrain), where either of two very similar metres may be used, the same metre is used for every line in the poem. Rhyme is always used, sometimes with double rhyme or internal rhymes in addition. In some poems, known as masnavi, the two halves of each couplet rhyme, with a scheme AA BB CC. In lyric poetry, the same rhyme is used throughout the poem at the end of each couplet, but except in the opening couplet, the two halves of each couplet do not rhyme; hence the scheme is AA BA CA DA. A \"ruba'i\" (quatrain) also usually has the rhyme AA BA.\nA particular feature of classical Persian prosody, not found in Latin, Greek or Arabic, is that instead of two lengths of syllables (long and short), there are three lengths (short, long, and overlong). Overlong syllables can be used anywhere in the line in place of a long + a short, or in the final position in a line or half line. When a metre has a pair of short syllables (\u23d1 \u23d1), it is common for a long syllable to be substituted, especially at the end of a line or half-line.\nAbout 30 different metres are commonly used in Persian. 70% of lyric poems are written in one of the following seven metres:\n\"Masnavi\" poems (that is, long poems in rhyming couplets) are always written in one of the shorter 11 or 10-syllable metres (traditionally seven in number) such as the following:\nThe two metres used for \"ruba'iyat\" (quatrains), which are only used for this, are the following, of which the second is a variant of the first:\nClassical Chinese.\nClassical Chinese poetic metric may be divided into fixed and variable length line types, although the actual scansion of the metre is complicated by various factors, including linguistic changes and variations encountered in dealing with a tradition extending over a geographically extensive regional area for a continuous time period of over some two-and-a-half millennia. Beginning with the earlier recorded forms: the Classic of Poetry tends toward couplets of four-character lines, grouped in rhymed quatrains; and, the Chuci follows this to some extent, but moves toward variations in line length. Han Dynasty poetry tended towards the variable line-length forms of the folk ballads and the Music Bureau yuefu. Jian'an poetry, Six Dynasties poetry, and Tang Dynasty poetry tend towards a poetic metre based on fixed-length lines of five, seven, (or, more rarely six) characters/verbal units tended to predominate, generally in couplet/quatrain-based forms, of various total verse lengths. The Song poetry is specially known for its use of the \"ci\", using variable line lengths which follow the specific pattern of a certain musical song's lyrics, thus \"ci\" are sometimes referred to as \"fixed-rhythm\" forms. Yuan poetry metres continued this practice with their \"qu\" forms, similarly fixed-rhythm forms based on now obscure or perhaps completely lost original examples (or, ur-types). Not that Classical Chinese poetry ever lost the use of the \"shi\" forms, with their metrical patterns found in the \"old style poetry\" (\"gushi\") and the regulated verse forms of (\"l\u00fcshi\" or \"jintishi\"). The regulated verse forms also prescribed patterns based upon linguistic tonality. The use of caesura is important in regard to the metrical analysis of Classical Chinese poetry forms.\nOld English.\nThe metric system of Old English poetry was different from that of modern English, and related more to the verse forms of most of the older Germanic languages such as Old Norse. It used alliterative verse, a metrical pattern involving varied numbers of syllables but a fixed number (usually four) of strong stresses in each line. The unstressed syllables were relatively unimportant, but the caesurae (breaks between the half-lines) played a major role in Old English poetry.\nIn place of using feet, alliterative verse divided each line into two half-lines. Each half-line had to follow one of five or so patterns, each of which defined a sequence of stressed and unstressed syllables, typically with two stressed syllables per half line. Unlike typical Western poetry, however, the number of unstressed syllables could vary somewhat. For example, the common pattern \"DUM-da-DUM-da\" could allow between one and five unstressed syllables between the two stresses.\nThe following is a famous example, taken from The Battle of Maldon, a poem written shortly after the date of that battle (AD 991):\n&lt;poem&gt;\n&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;poem&gt;\nWill must be the harder, courage the bolder,\nspirit must be the more, as our might lessens.\n&lt;/poem&gt;\nIn the quoted section, the stressed syllables have been underlined. (Normally, the stressed syllable must be long if followed by another syllable in a word. However, by a rule known as \"syllable resolution\", two short syllables in a single word are considered equal to a single long syllable. Hence, sometimes two syllables have been underlined, as in \"hige\" and \"m\u00e6gen\".) The German philologist Eduard Sievers (died 1932) identified five different patterns of half-line in Anglo-Saxon alliterative poetry. The first three half-lines have the type A pattern \"DUM-da-(da-)DUM-da\", while the last one has the type C pattern \"da-(da-da-)DUM-DUM-da\", with parentheses indicating optional unstressed syllables that have been inserted. Note also the pervasive pattern of alliteration, where the first and/or second stressed syllables alliterate with the third, but not with the fourth.\nFrench.\nIn French poetry, metre is determined solely by the number of syllables in a line. A silent 'e' counts as a syllable before a consonant, but is elided before a vowel (where \"h aspir\u00e9\" counts as a consonant). At the end of a line, the \"e\" remains unelided but is hypermetrical (outside the count of syllables, like a feminine ending in English verse), in that case, the rhyme is also called \"feminine\", whereas it is called \"masculine\" in the other cases.\nThe most frequently encountered metre in Classical French poetry is the alexandrine, composed of two hemistiches of six syllables each. Two famous alexandrines are\nand\nClassical French poetry also had a complex set of rules for rhymes that goes beyond how words merely sound. These are usually taken into account when describing the metre of a poem.\nSpanish.\nIn Spanish poetry the metre is determined by the number of syllables the verse has. Still it is the phonetic accent in the last word of the verse that decides the final count of the line. If the accent of the final word is at the last syllable, then the poetic rule states that one syllable shall be added to the actual count of syllables in the said line, thus having a higher number of poetic syllables than the number of grammatical syllables. If the accent lies on the second to last syllable of the last word in the verse, then the final count of poetic syllables will be the same as the grammatical number of syllables. Furthermore, if the accent lies on the third to last syllable, then one syllable is subtracted from the actual count, having then less poetic syllables than grammatical syllables.\nSpanish poetry uses poetic licenses, unique to Romance languages, to change the number of syllables by manipulating mainly the vowels in the line.\nRegarding these poetic licenses one must consider three kinds of phenomena: (1) syneresis, (2) dieresis and (3) hiatus\nThere are many types of licenses, used either to add or subtract syllables, that may be applied when needed after taking in consideration the poetic rules of the last word. Yet all have in common that they only manipulate vowels that are close to each other and not interrupted by consonants.\nSome common metres in Spanish verse are:\nItalian.\nIn Italian poetry, metre is determined solely by the position of the last accent in a line, the position of the other accents being however important for verse equilibrium. Syllables are enumerated with respect to a verse which ends with a paroxytone, so that a Septenary (having seven syllables) is defined as a verse whose last accent falls on the sixth syllable: it may so contain eight syllables () or just six (). Moreover, when a word ends with a vowel and the next one starts with a vowel, they are considered to be in the same syllable (synalepha): so consists of only four syllables (\"Gli an\" \"ni e i\" \"gior\" \"ni\"). Even-syllabic verses have a fixed stress pattern. Because of the mostly trochaic nature of the Italian language, verses with an even number of syllables are far easier to compose, and the Novenary is usually regarded as the most difficult verse.\nSome common metres in Italian verse are:\nTurkish.\nApart from Ottoman poetry, which was heavily influenced by Persian traditions and created a unique Ottoman style, traditional Turkish poetry features a system in which the number of syllables in each verse must be the same, most frequently 7, 8, 11, 14 syllables. These verses are then divided into syllable groups depending on the number of total syllables in a verse: 4+3 for 7 syllables, 4+4 or 5+3 for 8, 4+4+3 or 6+5 for 11 syllables. The end of each group in a verse is called a \"durak\" (stop), and must coincide with the last syllable of a word.\nThe following example is by Faruk Nafiz \u00c7aml\u0131bel (died 1973), one of the most devoted users of traditional Turkish metre:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;&lt;poem&gt;&lt;/poem&gt;\nIn this poem the 6+5 metre is used, so that there is a word-break (\"durak\"=\"stop\") after the sixth syllable of every line, as well as at the end of each line.\nOttoman Turkish.\nIn the Ottoman Turkish language, the structures of the poetic foot ( ) and of poetic metre ( ) were imitated from Persian poetry. About twelve of the most common Persian metres were used for writing Turkish poetry. As was the case with Persian, no use at all was made of the commonest metres of Arabic poetry (the , , , and ). However, the terminology used to describe the metres was indirectly borrowed from the Arabic poetic tradition through the medium of the Persian language.\nAs a result, Ottoman poetry, also known as D\u00eev\u00e2n poetry, was generally written in quantitative, mora-timed metre. The moras, or syllables, are divided into three basic types:\nIn writing out a poem's poetic metre, open syllables are symbolized by \".\" and closed syllables are symbolized by \"\u2013\". From the different syllable types, a total of sixteen different types of poetic foot\u2014the majority of which are either three or four syllables in length\u2014are constructed, which are named and scanned as follows:\nThese individual poetic feet are then combined in a number of different ways, most often with four feet per line, so as to give the poetic metre for a line of verse. Some of the most commonly used metres are the following:\nPortuguese.\nPortuguese poetry uses a syllabic metre in which the verse is classified according to the last stressed syllable. The Portuguese system is quite similar to those of Spanish and Italian, as they are closely related languages. The most commonly used verses are:\nWelsh.\nThere is a continuing tradition of strict metre poetry in the Welsh language that can be traced back to at least the sixth century. At the annual National Eisteddfod of Wales the prize of a bardic chair is awarded to the composer who has submitted for adjudication the best (long poem), collection of poems or sequence of poems, that follow(s) the conventions of regarding the arrangement within the syllabically-regulated poetic line, and between lines, of stress, alliteration, rhyme and half-rhyme.\nHungarian.\nMetre has been applied in Hungarian since 1541 up to the 20th century, partly in hexameter, and partly in other forms, such as the Alcaic, the Asclepiadic, and the Sapphic stanza. Early 19th-century poet D\u00e1niel Berzsenyi's poetry has been rendered into English faithfully to his original metre in some translations, namely by Peter Zollman, Adam Makkai, and others. 20th-century poets such as Mih\u00e1ly Babits, \u00c1rp\u00e1d T\u00f3th, Mikl\u00f3s Radn\u00f3ti, Attila J\u00f3zsef, and \u00c1gnes Nemes Nagy wrote poetry in metre. The Iliad, the Odyssey, the Aeneid and epic and lyric poetry by Horace, Ovid, and Catullus, have been translated into Hungarian in their original metre, most notably by G\u00e1bor Devecseri, as well as by other 20th-century translators.\nHistory.\nMetrical texts are first attested in early Indo-European languages. The earliest known unambiguously metrical texts, and at the same time the only metrical texts with a claim of dating to the Late Bronze Age, are the hymns of the Rigveda. That the texts of the Ancient Near East (Sumerian, Egyptian or Semitic) should not exhibit metre is surprising, and may be partly due to the nature of Bronze Age writing. There were, in fact, attempts to reconstruct metrical qualities of the poetic portions of the Hebrew Bible, e.g. by Gustav Bickell or Julius Ley, but they remained inconclusive (see Biblical poetry). Early Iron Age metrical poetry is found in the Iranian Avesta and in the Greek works attributed to Homer and Hesiod.\nLatin verse survives from the Old Latin period (c.\u20092nd century BC), in the Saturnian metre. Persian poetry arises in the Sassanid era. Tamil poetry of the early centuries AD may be the earliest known non-Indo-European\nMedieval poetry was metrical without exception, spanning traditions as diverse as European Minnesang, Trouv\u00e8re or Bardic poetry, Classical Persian and Sanskrit poetry, Tang dynasty Chinese poetry or the Japanese Nara period \"Man'y\u014dsh\u016b\". Renaissance and Early Modern poetry in Europe is characterized by a return to templates of Classical Antiquity, a tradition begun by Petrarca's generation and continued into the time of Shakespeare and Milton.\nDissent.\nNot all poets accept the idea that metre is a fundamental part of poetry. 20th-century American poets Marianne Moore, William Carlos Williams and Robinson Jeffers believed that metre was an artificial construct imposed upon poetry rather than being innate to poetry. In an essay titled \"Robinson Jeffers, &amp; The Metric Fallacy\" Dan Schneider echoes Jeffers' sentiments: \"What if someone actually said to you that all music was composed of just 2 notes? Or if someone claimed that there were just 2 colors in creation? Now, ponder if such a thing were true. Imagine the clunkiness &amp; mechanicality of such music. Think of the visual arts devoid of not just color, but sepia tones, &amp; even shades of gray.\" Jeffers called his technique \"rolling stresses\".\nMoore went further than Jeffers, openly declaring her poetry was written in syllabic form, and wholly denying metre. These syllabic lines from her famous poem \"Poetry\" illustrate her contempt for metre and other poetic tools. Even the syllabic pattern of this poem does not remain perfectly consistent:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nWilliams tried to form poetry whose subject matter was centered on the lives of common people. He came up with the concept of the variable foot. Williams spurned traditional metre in most of his poems, preferring what he called \"colloquial idioms.\" Another poet who turned his back on traditional concepts of metre was Britain's Gerard Manley Hopkins. Hopkins' major innovation was what he called sprung rhythm. He claimed most poetry was written in this older rhythmic structure inherited from the Norman side of the English literary heritage, based on repeating groups of two or three syllables, with the stressed syllable falling in the same place on each repetition. Sprung rhythm is structured around feet with a variable number of syllables, generally between one and four syllables per foot, with the stress always falling on the first syllable in a foot.\nReferences.\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He hijacked American Airlines Flight 77 and was one of the five hijackers who crashed the Boeing 757 into the Pentagon as part of the September 11 attacks.\nMoqed studied law at a college in Saudi Arabia before joining al-Qaeda in 1999. He was personally selected by Ramzi bin al-Shibh to participate in the 9/11 attacks. Al-Shibh sent him to the United States in May 2001 to study how to carry out the attacks.\nEarly life and activities.\nMoqed was a law student from the small town of Al-Nakhil, Saudi Arabia (west of Medina), studying at King Fahd University's Faculty of Administration and Economics. Before he dropped out, he was apparently recruited into al-Qaeda in 1999 along with friend Satam al-Suqami, a hijacker of American Airlines Flight 11, with whom he had earlier shared a college room.\nThe two trained at Khalden, a large training facility near Kabul that was run by Ibn al-Shaykh al-Libi. A friend in Saudi Arabia claimed he was last seen there in 2000, before leaving to study English in the United States. In November 2000, Moqed and al-Suqami flew into Iran from Bahrain together.\nSome time late in 2000, Moqed traveled to the United Arab Emirates, where he purchased traveler's cheques presumed to have been paid for by 9/11 financier Mustafa Ahmed al-Hawsawi. Five other hijackers also passed through the UAE and purchased travellers cheques, including Wail al-Shehri, Saeed al-Ghamdi, Hamza al-Ghamdi, Ahmed al-Haznawi, and Ahmed al-Nami.\nKnown as \"al-Ahlaf\" during the preparations, Moqed then moved in with hijackers Salem al-Hazmi, Abdulaziz al-Omari, and Khalid al-Mihdhar in an apartment in Paterson, New Jersey.\n2001.\nMoqed first arrived to the United States on or about May 2, 2001 with Ahmed al-Ghamdi.\nLater that year, Moqed, Hani Hanjour, al-Hazmi, and Ahmed al-Ghamdi rented a minivan and travelled to Fairfield, Connecticut. There they met a contact in the parking lot of a local convenience store who provided them with false IDs. (This was possibly Eyad Alrababah, a Jordanian charged with document fraud).\nMoqed was one of the five hijackers who asked for a state identity card on 2 August 2001. On 24 August, both al-Mihdhar and Moqed tried to purchase flight tickets from the American Airlines online ticket-merchant, but had technical difficulties resolving their address and gave up.\nEmployees at Advance Travel Service in Totowa, New Jersey, later claimed that Moqed and Hanjour had both purchased tickets there. They claimed that Hani Hanjour spoke very little English, and Moqed did most of the speaking. Hanjour requested a seat in the front row of the airplane. Their credit card failed to authorize, and after being told the agency did not accept personal cheques, the pair left to withdraw cash. They returned shortly afterwards and paid $1842.25 in cash. During this time, Moqed was staying in Room 343 of the Valencia Motel. On September 2, Moqed paid cash for a $30 weekly membership at Gold's Gym in Greenbelt, Maryland.\nThree days later he was seen on an ATM camera with Hani Hanjour. After the attacks, the manager at an adult video store, Adult Lingerie Center, in Beltsville claimed that Moqed had been in the store three times.\nAttacks.\nOn September 11 2001, Moqed arrived at Washington Dulles International Airport.\nAccording to the \"9/11 Commission Report\", Moqed set off the metal detector at the airport and was screened with a hand-wand. He passed the cursory inspection, and was able to board his flight at 7:50. He was seated in 12A, adjacent to al-Mihdhar who was in 12B. Moqed helped to hijack the plane and assisted Hani Hanjour in crashing the plane into the Pentagon at 9:37\u00a0a.m., killing 189 people (64 on the plane and 125 on the ground).\nThe flight was scheduled to depart at 08:10, but ended up departing 10\u00a0minutes late from Gate\u00a0D26 at Dulles. The last normal radio communications from the aircraft to air traffic control occurred at 08:50:51. At 08:54, Flight\u00a077 began to deviate from its normal, assigned flight path and turned south, and then hijackers set the flight's autopilot heading for Washington, D.C. Passenger Barbara Olson called her husband, United States Solicitor General Theodore Olson, and reported that the plane had been hijacked and that the assailants had box cutters and knives. At 09:37, American Airlines Flight 77 crashed into the west facade of the Pentagon, killing all 64 aboard (including the hijackers), along with 125 on the ground in the Pentagon. In the recovery process at the Pentagon, remains of all five Flight\u00a077 hijackers were identified through a process of elimination, as not matching any DNA samples for the victims, and put into custody of the FBI.\nAfter the attacks his family told \"Arab News\" that Moqed had been a fan of sports, and enjoyed travelling. Additionally, the U.S. announced it had found a \"Kingdom of Saudi Arabia Student Identity Card\" bearing Moqed's name in the rubble surrounding the Pentagon. They also stated that it appeared to have been a forgery.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The process is called mimeography, and a copy made by the process is a mimeograph.\nMimeographs, along with spirit duplicators and hectographs, were common technologies for printing small quantities of a document, as in office work, classroom materials, and church bulletins. For even smaller quantities, up to about five, a typist would use carbon paper. Early fanzines were printed by mimeograph because the machines and supplies were widely available and inexpensive. Beginning in the late 1960s and continuing into the 1970s, photocopying gradually displaced mimeographs, spirit duplicators, and hectographs.\nOrigins.\nUse of stencils is an ancient art, but\u00a0\u2013 through chemistry, papers, and presses\u00a0\u2013 techniques advanced rapidly in the late nineteenth century:\nPapyrograph.\nA description of the Papyrograph method of duplication was published by David Owen: \nA major beneficiary of the invention of synthetic dyes was a document reproduction technique known as stencil duplicating. Its earliest form was invented in 1874 by Eugenio de Zuccato, a young Italian studying law in London, who called his device the Papyrograph. Zuccato's system involved writing on a sheet of varnished paper with caustic ink, which ate through the varnish and paper fibers, leaving holes where the writing had been. This sheet \u2013 which had now become a stencil \u2013 was placed on a blank sheet of paper, and ink rolled over it so that the ink oozed through the holes, creating a duplicate on the second sheet.\nThe process was commercialized and Zuccato applied for a patent in 1895 having stencils prepared by typewriting.\nElectric pen.\nThomas Edison received US patent 180,857 for Autographic Printing on August 8, 1876. The patent covered the electric pen, used for making the stencil, and the flatbed duplicating press. In 1880, Edison obtained a further patent, US 224,665: \"Method of Preparing Autographic Stencils for Printing,\" which covered the making of stencils using a file plate, a grooved metal plate on which the stencil was placed which perforated the stencil when written on with a blunt metal stylus.\nThe word \"mimeograph\" was first used by Albert Blake Dick when he licensed Edison's patents in 1887.\nDick received Trademark Registration no. 0356815 for the term \"mimeograph\" in the US Patent Office. It is currently listed as a dead entry, but shows the A.B. Dick Company of Chicago as the owner of the name.\nOver time, the term became generic and is now an example of a genericized trademark. (\"Roneograph\", also \"Roneo machine\", was another trademark used for mimeograph machines, the name being a contraction of \"Rotary Neostyle\".)\nCyclostyle.\nIn 1891, David Gestetner patented his Automatic Cyclostyle. This was one of the first rotary machines that retained the flatbed, which passed back and forth under inked rollers. This invention provided for more automated, faster reproductions since the pages were produced and moved by rollers instead of pressing one single sheet at a time.\nBy 1900, two primary types of mimeographs had come into use: a single-drum machine and a dual-drum machine. The single-drum machine used a single drum for ink transfer to the stencil, and the dual-drum machine used two drums and silk-screens to transfer the ink to the stencils. The single drum (example Roneo) machine could be easily used for multi-color work by changing the drum \u2013 each of which contained ink of a different color. This was spot color for mastheads. Colors could not be mixed.\nThe mimeograph became popular because it was much cheaper than traditional print \u2013 there was neither typesetting nor skilled labor involved. One individual with a typewriter and the necessary equipment became their own printing factory, allowing for greater circulation of printed material.\nMimeography process.\nThe image transfer medium was originally a stencil made from waxed mulberry paper. Later this became an immersion-coated long-fiber paper, with the coating being a plasticized nitrocellulose. This flexible waxed or coated sheet is backed by a sheet of stiff card stock, with the two sheets bound at the top.\nOnce prepared, the stencil is wrapped around the ink-filled drum of the rotary machine. When a blank sheet of paper is drawn between the rotating drum and a pressure roller, ink is forced through the holes on the stencil onto the paper. Early flatbed machines used a kind of squeegee.\nThe ink originally had a lanolin base and later became an oil in water emulsion. This emulsion commonly uses turkey-red oil (sulfated castor oil) which gives it a distinctive and heavy scent.\nPreparing stencils.\nOne uses a regular typewriter, with a stencil setting, to create a stencil. The operator loads a stencil assemblage into the typewriter like paper and uses a switch on the typewriter to put it in stencil mode. In this mode, the part of the mechanism which lifts the ribbon between the type element and the paper is disabled so that the bare, sharp type element strikes the stencil directly. The impact of the type element displaces the coating, making the tissue paper permeable to the oil-based ink. This is called \"cutting a stencil\".\nA variety of specialized styluses were used on the stencil to render lettering, illustrations, or other artistic features by hand against a textured plastic backing plate.\nMistakes were corrected by brushing them out with a specially formulated correction fluid, and retyping once it has dried. (Obliterine was a popular brand of correction fluid in Australia and the United Kingdom.)\nStencils were also made with a thermal process, an infrared method similar to that used by early photocopiers. The common machine was a Thermofax.\nAnother device, called an electrostencil machine, sometimes was used to make mimeo stencils from a typed or printed original. It worked by scanning the original on a rotating drum with a moving optical head and burning through the blank stencil with an electric spark in the places where the optical head detected ink. It was slow and produced ozone. Text from electrostencils had lower resolution than that from typed stencils, although the process was good for reproducing illustrations. A skilled mimeo operator using an electrostencil and a very coarse halftone screen could make acceptable printed copies of a photograph.\nDuring the declining years of the mimeograph, some people made stencils with early computers and dot-matrix impact printers.\nLimitations.\nUnlike spirit duplicators (where the only ink available is depleted from the master image), mimeograph technology works by forcing a replenishable supply of ink through the stencil master. In theory, the mimeography process could be continued indefinitely, especially if a durable stencil master were used (e.g. a thin metal foil). In practice, most low-cost mimeo stencils gradually wear out over the course of producing several hundred copies. Typically the stencil deteriorates gradually, producing a characteristic degraded image quality until the stencil tears, abruptly ending the print run. If further copies are desired at this point, another stencil must be made.\nOften, the stencil material covering the interiors of closed letterforms (e.g. \"a\", \"b\", \"d\", \"e\", \"g\", etc.) would fall away during continued printing, causing ink-filled letters in the copies. The stencil would gradually stretch, starting near the top where the mechanical forces were greatest, causing a characteristic \"mid-line sag\" in the textual lines of the copies, that would progress until the stencil failed completely. \nThe Gestetner Company (and others) devised various methods to make mimeo stencils more durable.\nCompared to spirit duplication, mimeography produced a darker, more legible image. Spirit-duplicated images were usually tinted a light purple or lavender, which gradually became lighter over the course of some dozens of copies. Mimeography was often considered \"the next step up\" in quality, capable of producing hundreds of copies. Print runs beyond that level were usually produced by professional printers or, as the technology became available, xerographic copiers.\nDurability.\nMimeographed images generally have much better durability than spirit-duplicated images, since the inks are more resistant to ultraviolet light. The primary preservation challenge is the low-quality paper often used, which would yellow and degrade due to residual acid in the treated pulp from which the paper was made. In the worst case, old copies can crumble into small particles when handled. Mimeographed copies have moderate durability when acid-free paper is used.\nContemporary use.\nGestetner, Risograph, and other companies still make and sell highly automated mimeograph-like machines that are externally similar to photocopiers. The modern version of a mimeograph, called a digital duplicator, or copyprinter, contains a scanner, a thermal head for stencil cutting, and a large roll of stencil material entirely inside the unit. The stencil material consists of a very thin polymer film laminated to a long-fiber non-woven tissue. It makes the stencils and mounts and unmounts them from the print drum automatically, making it almost as easy to operate as a photocopier. The Risograph is the best known of these machines.\nAlthough mimeographs remain more economical and energy-efficient in mid-range quantities, easier-to-use photocopying and offset printing have replaced mimeography almost entirely in developed countries. Mimeography continues to be used in some developing countries because it is a simple, cheap, and robust technology. Many mimeographs can be hand-cranked, requiring no electricity.\nUses and art.\nMimeographs and the closely related but distinctly different spirit duplicator process were both used extensively in schools to copy homework assignments and tests. They were also commonly used for low-budget amateur publishing, including club newsletters and church bulletins. They were especially popular with science fiction fans, who used them extensively in the production of fanzines in the middle 20th century, before photocopying became inexpensive.\nLetters and typographical symbols were sometimes used to create illustrations, in a precursor to ASCII art. Because changing ink color in a mimeograph could be a laborious process, involving extensively cleaning the machine or, on newer models, replacing the drum or rollers, and then running the paper through the machine a second time, some fanzine publishers experimented with techniques for painting several colors on the pad.\nIn addition, mimeographs were used by many resistance groups during World War Two as a way to print illegal newspapers and publications in countries such as Belgium.\nIn the NCIS Season 7 episode, \"Power Down\", agents McGee and DiNozzo bring a mimeograph up from the basement. McGee derisively comments, \"Yeah, now all we need is a dinosaur who knows how to use it.\" before Agent Gibbs simply uses the device to make a number of replicas of a composite sketch. As the rest of the team looks on in amazement, Gibbs angrily shoulders past McGee.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

When the original object enters the atmosphere, various factors such as friction, pressure, and chemical interactions with the atmospheric gases cause it to heat up and radiate energy. It then becomes a meteor and forms a fireball, also known as a shooting star; astronomers call the brightest examples \"bolides\". Once it settles on the larger body's surface, the meteor becomes a meteorite. Meteorites vary greatly in size. For geologists, a bolide is a meteorite large enough to create an impact crater.\nMeteorites that are recovered after being observed as they transit the atmosphere and impact Earth are called meteorite falls. All others are known as meteorite finds. Meteorites have traditionally been divided into three broad categories: stony meteorites that are rocks, mainly composed of silicate minerals; iron meteorites that are largely composed of ferronickel; and stony-iron meteorites that contain large amounts of both metallic and rocky material. Modern classification schemes divide meteorites into groups according to their structure, chemical and isotopic composition and mineralogy. \"Meteorites\" less than ~ in diameter are classified as micrometeorites, however micrometeorites differ from meteorites in that they typically melt completely in the atmosphere and fall to Earth as quenched droplets. Extraterrestrial meteorites have been found on the Moon and on Mars.\nMost space rocks crashing into Earth come from a single source. The origin of most meteorites can be traced to just a handful of asteroid breakup events \u2013 and possibly even individual asteroids.\nFall phenomena.\nMost meteoroids disintegrate when entering the Earth's atmosphere. Usually, five to ten a year are observed to fall and are subsequently recovered and made known to scientists. Few meteorites are large enough to create large impact craters. Instead, they typically arrive at the surface at their terminal velocity and, at most, create a small pit.\nLarge meteoroids may strike the earth with a significant fraction of their escape velocity (second cosmic velocity), leaving behind a hypervelocity impact crater. The kind of crater will depend on the size, composition, degree of fragmentation, and incoming angle of the impactor. The force of such collisions has the potential to cause widespread destruction. The most frequent hypervelocity cratering events on the Earth are caused by iron meteoroids, which are most easily able to transit the atmosphere intact. Examples of craters caused by iron meteoroids include Barringer Meteor Crater, Odessa Meteor Crater, Wabar craters, and Wolfe Creek crater; iron meteorites are found in association with all of these craters. In contrast, even relatively large stony or icy bodies such as small comets or asteroids, up to millions of tons, are disrupted in the atmosphere, and do not make impact craters. Although such disruption events are uncommon, they can cause a considerable concussion to occur; the famed Tunguska event probably resulted from such an incident. Very large stony objects, hundreds of meters in diameter or more, weighing tens of millions of tons or more, can reach the surface and cause large craters but are very rare. Such events are generally so energetic that the impactor is completely destroyed, leaving no meteorites. (The first example of a stony meteorite found in association with a large impact crater, the Morokweng impact structure in South Africa, was reported in May 2006.)\nSeveral phenomena are well documented during witnessed meteorite falls too small to produce hypervelocity craters. The fireball that occurs as the meteoroid passes through the atmosphere can appear to be very bright, rivaling the sun in intensity, although most are far dimmer and may not even be noticed during the daytime. Various colors have been reported, including yellow, green, and red. Flashes and bursts of light can occur as the object breaks up. Explosions, detonations, and rumblings are often heard during meteorite falls, which can be caused by sonic booms as well as shock waves resulting from major fragmentation events. These sounds can be heard over wide areas, with a radius of a hundred or more kilometers. Whistling and hissing sounds are also sometimes heard but are poorly understood. Following the passage of the fireball, it is not unusual for a dust trail to linger in the atmosphere for several minutes.\nAs meteoroids are heated during atmospheric entry, their surfaces melt and experience ablation. They can be sculpted into various shapes during this process, sometimes resulting in shallow thumbprint-like indentations on their surfaces called regmaglypts. If the meteoroid maintains a fixed orientation for some time, without tumbling, it may develop a conical \"nose cone\" or \"heat shield\" shape. As it decelerates, eventually the molten surface layer solidifies into a thin fusion crust, which on most meteorites is black (on some achondrites, the fusion crust may be very light-colored). On stony meteorites, the heat-affected zone is at most a few mm deep; in iron meteorites, which are more thermally conductive, the structure of the metal may be affected by heat up to below the surface. Reports vary; some meteorites are reported to be \"burning hot to the touch\" upon landing, while others are alleged to have been cold enough to condense water and form a frost.\nMeteoroids that disintegrate in the atmosphere may fall as meteorite showers, which can range from only a few up to thousands of separate individuals. The area over which a meteorite shower falls is known as its strewn field. Strewn fields are commonly elliptical in shape, with the major axis parallel to the direction of flight. In most cases, the largest meteorites in a shower are found farthest down-range in the strewn field.\nClassification.\nMost meteorites are stony meteorites, classed as chondrites and achondrites. Only about 6% of meteorites are iron meteorites or a blend of rock and metal, the stony-iron meteorites. Modern classification of meteorites is complex. The review paper of Krot et al. (2007) summarizes modern meteorite taxonomy.\nAbout 86% of the meteorites are chondrites, which are named for the small, round particles they contain. These particles, or chondrules, are composed mostly of silicate minerals that appear to have been melted while they were free-floating objects in space. Certain types of chondrites also contain small amounts of organic matter, including amino acids, and presolar grains. Chondrites are typically about 4.55\u00a0billion years old and are thought to represent material from the asteroid belt that never coalesced into large bodies. Like comets, chondritic asteroids are some of the oldest and most primitive materials in the Solar System. Chondrites are often considered to be \"the building blocks of the planets\".\nAbout 8% of the meteorites are achondrites (meaning they do not contain chondrules), some of which are similar to terrestrial igneous rocks. Most achondrites are also ancient rocks, and are thought to represent crustal material of differentiated planetesimals. One large family of achondrites (the HED meteorites) may have originated on the parent body of the Vesta Family, although this claim is disputed. Others derive from unidentified asteroids. Two small groups of achondrites are younger and do not appear to come from the asteroid belt. One of these groups comes from the Moon, and includes rocks similar to those brought back to Earth by Apollo and Luna programs. The other group is almost certainly from Mars and constitutes the only materials from other planets ever recovered by humans.\nAbout 5% of meteorites that have been seen to fall are iron meteorites composed of iron-nickel alloys, such as kamacite and/or taenite. Most iron meteorites are thought to come from the cores of planetesimals that were once molten. As with the Earth, the denser metal separated from silicate material and sank toward the center of the planetesimal, forming its core. After the planetesimal solidified, it broke up in a collision with another planetesimal. Due to the low abundance of iron meteorites in collection areas such as Antarctica, where most of the meteoric material that has fallen can be recovered, it is possible that the percentage of iron-meteorite falls is lower than 5%. This would be explained by a recovery bias; laypeople are more likely to notice and recover solid masses of metal than most other meteorite types. The abundance of iron meteorites relative to total Antarctic finds is 0.4%.\nStony-iron meteorites constitute the remaining 1%. They are a mixture of iron-nickel metal and silicate minerals. One type, called pallasites, is thought to have originated in the boundary zone above the core regions where iron meteorites originated. The other major type of stony-iron meteorites is the mesosiderites.\nTektites (from Greek \"tektos\", molten) are not themselves meteorites, but are rather natural glass objects up to a few centimeters in size that were formed\u2014according to most scientists\u2014by the impacts of large meteorites on Earth's surface. A few researchers have favored tektites originating from the Moon as volcanic ejecta, but this theory has lost much of its support over the last few decades.\nFrequency.\nThe diameter of the largest impactor to hit Earth on any given day is likely to be about , in a given year about , and in a given century about . These statistics are obtained by the following:\nOver at least the range from to roughly , the rate at which Earth receives meteors obeys a power-law distribution as follows:\nformula_1\nwhere \"N\" (&gt;\"D\") is the expected number of objects larger than a diameter of \"D\" meters to hit Earth in a year. This is based on observations of bright meteors seen from the ground and space, combined with surveys of near-Earth asteroids. Above in diameter, the predicted rate is somewhat higher, with a asteroid (one teraton TNT equivalent) every couple of million years\u00a0\u2013 about 10 times as often as the power-law extrapolation would predict.\nChemistry.\nIn 2015, NASA scientists reported that complex organic compounds found in DNA and RNA, including uracil, cytosine, and thymine, have been formed in the laboratory under outer space conditions, using starting chemicals, such as pyrimidine, found in meteorites. Pyrimidine and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) may have been formed in red giants or in interstellar dust and gas clouds, according to the scientists.\nIn 2018, researchers found that 4.5\u00a0billion-year-old meteorites found on Earth contained liquid water along with prebiotic complex organic substances that may be ingredients for life.\nIn 2019, scientists reported detecting sugar molecules in meteorites for the first time, including ribose, suggesting that chemical processes on asteroids can produce some organic compounds fundamental to life, and supporting the notion of an RNA world prior to a DNA-based origin of life on Earth.\nIn 2022, a Japanese group reported that they had found adenine (A), thymine (T), guanine (G), cytosine (C) and uracil (U) inside carbon-rich meteorites. These compounds \nare building blocks of DNA and RNA, the genetic code of all life on Earth. These compounds have also occurred spontaneously in laboratory settings emulating conditions in outer space.\nSources of meteorites found on Earth.\nUntil recently, the source of only about 6% of meteorites had been traced to their sources: the Moon, Mars, and asteroid Vesta. Approximately 70% of meteorites found on Earth now appear to originate from break-ups of three asteroids.\nWeathering.\nMost meteorites date from the early Solar System and are by far the oldest extant material on Earth. Analysis of terrestrial weathering due to water, salt, oxygen, etc. is used to quantify the degree of alteration that a meteorite has experienced. Several qualitative weathering indices have been applied to Antarctic and desertic samples.\nThe most commonly employed weathering scale, used for ordinary chondrites, ranges from W0 (pristine state) to W6 (heavy alteration).\nFossil meteorites.\n\"Fossil\" meteorites are sometimes discovered by geologists. They represent the highly weathered remains of meteorites that fell to Earth in the remote past and were preserved in sedimentary deposits sufficiently well that they can be recognized through mineralogical and geochemical studies. The Thorsberg limestone quarry in Sweden has produced an anomalously large number \u2013 exceeding one hundred \u2013 fossil meteorites from the Ordovician, nearly all of which are highly weathered L-chondrites that still resemble the original meteorite under a petrographic microscope, but which have had their original material almost entirely replaced by terrestrial secondary mineralization. The extraterrestrial provenance was demonstrated in part through isotopic analysis of relict spinel grains, a mineral that is common in meteorites, is insoluble in water, and is able to persist chemically unchanged in the terrestrial weathering environment. Scientists believe that these meteorites, which have all also been found in Russia and China, all originated from the same source, a collision that occurred somewhere between Jupiter and Mars. One of these fossil meteorites, dubbed \u00d6sterplana 065, appears to represent a distinct type of meteorite that is \"extinct\" in the sense that it is no longer falling to Earth, the parent body having already been completely depleted from the reservoir of near-Earth objects.\nCollection.\nA \"meteorite fall\", also called an \"observed fall\", is a meteorite collected after its arrival was observed by people or automated devices. Any other meteorite is called a \"meteorite find\". There are more than 1,100 documented falls listed in widely used databases, most of which have specimens in modern collections. As of January 2019[ [update]], the \"Meteoritical Bulletin Database\" had 1,180 confirmed falls.\nFalls.\nMost meteorite falls are collected on the basis of eyewitness accounts of the fireball or the impact of the object on the ground, or both. Therefore, despite the fact that meteorites fall with virtually equal probability everywhere on Earth, verified meteorite falls tend to be concentrated in areas with higher human population densities such as Europe, Japan, and northern India.\nA small number of meteorite falls have been observed with automated cameras and recovered following calculation of the impact point. The first of these was the P\u0159\u00edbram meteorite, which fell in Czechoslovakia (now the Czech Republic) in 1959. In this case, two cameras used to photograph meteors captured images of the fireball. The images were used both to determine the location of the stones on the ground and, more significantly, to calculate for the first time an accurate orbit for a recovered meteorite.\nFollowing the P\u0159\u00edbram fall, other nations established automated observing programs aimed at studying infalling meteorites. One of these was the \"Prairie Network\", operated by the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory from 1963 to 1975 in the midwestern US. This program also observed a meteorite fall, the \"Lost City\" chondrite, allowing its recovery and a calculation of its orbit. Another program in Canada, the Meteorite Observation and Recovery Project, ran from 1971 to 1985. It too recovered a single meteorite, \"Innisfree\", in 1977. Finally, observations by the European Fireball Network, a descendant of the original Czech program that recovered P\u0159\u00edbram, led to the discovery and orbit calculations for the \"Neuschwanstein\" meteorite in 2002. NASA has an automated system that detects meteors and calculates the orbit, magnitude, ground track, and other parameters over the southeast USA, which often detects a number of events each night.\nFinds.\nUntil the twentieth century, only a few hundred meteorite finds had ever been discovered. More than 80% of these were iron and stony-iron meteorites, which are easily distinguished from local rocks. To this day, few stony meteorites are reported each year that can be considered to be \"accidental\" finds. The reason there are now more than 30,000 meteorite finds in the world's collections started with the discovery by Harvey H. Nininger that meteorites are much more common on the surface of the Earth than was previously thought.\nCanada.\nMeteorites that land in Canada are protected under the \"Cultural Property Export and Import Act\". In July 2024, a meteorite was recorded by security footage crashing into a residential property in Marshfield, Prince Edward Island. It is believed to be the first time such an event has been captured on camera and the sound of the crash recorded. It was subsequently registered as the Charlottetown meteorite, named after the city near to where it landed.\nUnited States.\nNininger's strategy was to search for meteorites in the Great Plains of the United States, where the land was largely cultivated and the soil contained few rocks. Between the late 1920s and the 1950s, he traveled across the region, educating local people about what meteorites looked like and what to do if they thought they had found one, for example, in the course of clearing a field. The result was the discovery of more than 200 new meteorites, mostly stony types.\nIn the late 1960s, Roosevelt County, New Mexico was found to be a particularly good place to find meteorites. After the discovery of a few meteorites in 1967, a public awareness campaign resulted in the finding of nearly 100 new specimens in the next few years, with many being by a single person, Ivan Wilson. In total, nearly 140 meteorites were found in the region since 1967. In the area of the finds, the ground was originally covered by a shallow, loose soil sitting atop a hardpan layer. During the dustbowl era, the loose soil was blown off, leaving any rocks and meteorites that were present stranded on the exposed surface.\nBeginning in the mid-1960s, amateur meteorite hunters began scouring the arid areas of the southwestern United States. To date, thousands of meteorites have been recovered from the Mojave, Sonoran, Great Basin, and Chihuahuan Deserts, with many being recovered on dry lake beds. Significant finds include the three-tonne Old Woman meteorite, currently on display at the Desert Discovery Center in Barstow, California, and the Franconia and Gold Basin meteorite strewn fields; hundreds of kilograms of meteorites have been recovered from each. A number of finds from the American Southwest have been submitted with false find locations, as many finders think it is unwise to publicly share that information for fear of confiscation by the federal government and competition with other hunters at published find sites. Several of the meteorites found recently are currently on display in the Griffith Observatory in Los Angeles, and at UCLA's Meteorite Gallery.\nAntarctica.\nA few meteorites were found in Antarctica between 1912 and 1964. In 1969, the 10th Japanese Antarctic Research Expedition found nine meteorites on a blue ice field near the Yamato Mountains. With this discovery, came the realization that movement of ice sheets might act to concentrate meteorites in certain areas. After a dozen other specimens were found in the same place in 1973, a Japanese expedition was launched in 1974 dedicated to the search for meteorites. This team recovered nearly 700 meteorites.\nShortly thereafter, the United States began its own program to search for Antarctic meteorites, operating along the Transantarctic Mountains on the other side of the continent: the Antarctic Search for Meteorites (ANSMET) program. European teams, starting with a consortium called \"EUROMET\" in the 1990/91 season, and continuing with a program by the Italian Programma Nazionale di Ricerche in Antartide have also conducted systematic searches for Antarctic meteorites.\nThe Antarctic Scientific Exploration of China has conducted successful meteorite searches since 2000. A Korean program (KOREAMET) was launched in 2007 and has collected a few meteorites. The combined efforts of all of these expeditions have produced more than 23,000 classified meteorite specimens since 1974, with thousands more that have not yet been classified. For more information see the article by Harvey (2003).\nAustralia.\nAt about the same time as meteorite concentrations were being discovered in the cold desert of Antarctica, collectors discovered that many meteorites could also be found in the hot deserts of Australia. Several dozen meteorites had already been found in the Nullarbor Plain region of Western Australia and South Australia. Systematic searches between about 1971 and the present recovered more than 500 others, ~300 of which are currently well characterized. The meteorites can be found in this region because the land presents a flat, featureless, plain covered by limestone. In the extremely arid climate, there has been relatively little weathering or sedimentation on the surface for tens of thousands of years, allowing meteorites to accumulate without being buried or destroyed. The dark-colored meteorites can then be recognized among the very different looking limestone pebbles and rocks.\nThe Sahara.\nIn 1986\u201387, a German team installing a network of seismic stations while prospecting for oil discovered about 65 meteorites on a flat, desert plain about southeast of Dirj (Daraj), Libya. A few years later, a desert enthusiast saw photographs of meteorites being recovered by scientists in Antarctica, and thought that he had seen similar occurrences in northern Africa. In 1989, he recovered about 100 meteorites from several distinct locations in Libya and Algeria. Over the next several years, he and others who followed found at least 400 more meteorites. The find locations were generally in regions known as regs or hamadas: flat, featureless areas covered only by small pebbles and minor amounts of sand. Dark-colored meteorites can be easily spotted in these places. In the case of several meteorite fields, such as Dar al Gani, Dhofar, and others, favorable light-colored geology consisting of basic rocks (clays, dolomites, and limestones) makes meteorites particularly easy to identify.\nAlthough meteorites had been sold commercially and collected by hobbyists for many decades, up to the time of the Saharan finds of the late 1980s and early 1990s, most meteorites were deposited in or purchased by museums and similar institutions where they were exhibited and made available for scientific research. The sudden availability of large numbers of meteorites that could be found with relative ease in places that were readily accessible (especially compared to Antarctica), led to a rapid rise in commercial collection of meteorites. This process was accelerated when, in 1997, meteorites coming from both the Moon and Mars were found in Libya. By the late 1990s, private meteorite-collecting expeditions had been launched throughout the Sahara. Specimens of the meteorites recovered in this way are still deposited in research collections, but most of the material is sold to private collectors. These expeditions have now brought the total number of well-described meteorites found in Algeria and Libya to more than 500.\nNorthwest Africa.\nMeteorite markets came into existence in the late 1990s, especially in Morocco. This trade was driven by Western commercialization and an increasing number of collectors. The meteorites were supplied by nomads and local people who combed the deserts looking for specimens to sell. Many thousands of meteorites have been distributed in this way, most of which lack any information about how, when, or where they were discovered. These are the so-called \"Northwest Africa\" meteorites. When they get classified, they are named \"Northwest Africa\" (abbreviated NWA) followed by a number. It is generally accepted that NWA meteorites originate in Morocco, Algeria, Western Sahara, Mali, and possibly even further afield. Nearly all of these meteorites leave Africa through Morocco. Scores of important meteorites, including Lunar and Martian ones, have been discovered and made available to science via this route. A few of the more notable meteorites recovered include Tissint and NWA\u00a07034. Tissint was the first witnessed Martian meteorite fall in more than fifty years; NWA\u00a07034 is the oldest meteorite known to come from Mars, and is a unique water-bearing regolith breccia.\nArabian Peninsula.\nIn 1999, meteorite hunters discovered that the desert in southern and central Oman were also favorable for the collection of many specimens. The gravel plains in the Dhofar and Al Wusta regions of Oman, south of the sandy deserts of the Rub' al Khali, had yielded about 5,000 meteorites as of mid-2009. Included among these are a large number of lunar and Martian meteorites, making Oman a particularly important area both for scientists and collectors. Early expeditions to Oman were mainly done by commercial meteorite dealers, however, international teams of Omani and European scientists have also now collected specimens.\nThe recovery of meteorites from Oman is currently prohibited by national law, but a number of international hunters continue to remove specimens now deemed national treasures. This new law provoked a small international incident, as its implementation preceded any public notification of such a law, resulting in the prolonged imprisonment of a large group of meteorite hunters, primarily from Russia, but whose party also consisted of members from the US as well as several other European countries.\nIn human affairs.\nMeteorites have figured into human culture since their earliest discovery as ceremonial or religious objects, as the subject of writing about events occurring in the sky and as a source of peril. The oldest known iron artifacts are nine small beads hammered from meteoritic iron. They were found in northern Egypt and have been securely dated to 3200 BC.\nCeremonial or religious use.\nAlthough the use of the metal found in meteorites is also recorded in myths of many countries and cultures where the celestial source was often acknowledged, scientific documentation only began in the last few centuries.\nMeteorite falls may have been the source of cultish worship. The cult in the Temple of Artemis at Ephesus, one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World, possibly originated with the observation and recovery of a meteorite that was understood by contemporaries to have fallen to the earth from Jupiter, the principal Roman deity. There are reports that a sacred stone was enshrined at the temple that may have been a meteorite.\nThe Black Stone set into the wall of the Kaaba has often been presumed to be a meteorite, but the little available evidence for this is inconclusive.\nSome Native Americans treated meteorites as ceremonial objects. In 1915, a iron meteorite was found in a Sinagua (c. 1100\u20131200 AD) burial cyst near Camp Verde, Arizona, respectfully wrapped in a feather cloth. A small pallasite was found in a pottery jar in an old burial found at Pojoaque Pueblo, New Mexico. Nininger reports several other such instances, in the Southwest US and elsewhere, such as the discovery of Native American beads of meteoric iron found in Hopewell burial mounds, and the discovery of the Winona meteorite in a Native American stone-walled crypt.\nHistorical writings.\nIn medieval China during the Song dynasty, a meteorite strike event was recorded by Shen Kuo in 1064 AD near Changzhou. He reported \"a loud noise that sounded like a thunder was heard in the sky; a giant star, almost like the moon, appeared in the southeast\" and later finding the crater and the still-hot meteorite within, nearby.\nTwo of the oldest recorded meteorite falls in Europe are the Elbogen (1400) and Ensisheim (1492) meteorites. The German physicist, Ernst Florens Chladni, was the first to publish (in 1794) the idea that meteorites might be rocks that originated not from Earth, but from space. His booklet was \"On the Origin of the Iron Masses Found by Pallas and Others Similar to it, and on Some Associated Natural Phenomena\". In this he compiled all available data on several meteorite finds and falls concluded that they must have their origins in outer space. The scientific community of the time responded with resistance and mockery. It took nearly ten years before a general acceptance of the origin of meteorites was achieved through the work of the French scientist Jean-Baptiste Biot and the British chemist, Edward Howard. Biot's study, initiated by the French Academy of Sciences, was compelled by a fall of thousands of meteorites on 26 April 1803 from the skies of L'Aigle, France.\nStriking people or property.\nThroughout history, many first- and second-hand reports speak of meteorites killing humans and other animals. One example is from 1490 AD in China, which purportedly killed thousands of people. John Lewis has compiled some of these reports, and summarizes, \"No one in recorded history has ever been killed by a meteorite in the presence of a meteoriticist and a medical doctor\" and \"reviewers who make sweeping negative conclusions usually do not cite any of the primary publications in which the eyewitnesses describe their experiences, and give no evidence of having read them\".\nModern reports of meteorite strikes include:\nNotable examples.\nNaming.\nMeteorites are always named for the places they were found, where practical, usually a nearby town or geographic feature. In cases where many meteorites were found in one place, the name may be followed by a number or letter (e.g., Allan Hills 84001 or Dimmitt (b)). The name designated by the Meteoritical Society is used by scientists, catalogers, and most collectors.\nTerrestrial.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nExtraterrestrial.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nLarge impact craters.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

During the September 11 attacks in 2001, he was a passenger on board United Airlines Flight 93. Bingham was among the passengers who, along with Todd Beamer, Tom Burnett and Jeremy Glick, formed the plan to retake the plane from the hijackers, and led the effort that resulted in the crash of the plane into a field near Shanksville, Pennsylvania, thwarting the hijackers' plan to crash the plane into a building in Washington, D.C., most likely either the U.S. Capitol Building or the White House.\nBingham's efforts on United Flight 93, as well as his athletic physique, were noted for having prompted a reassessment of gay stereotypes.\nEarly life.\nMark Bingham was born on May 22, 1970, the only child of Alice Hoagland and Gerald Bingham. When Mark was two years old, his parents divorced. Raised by his mother and her family, Mark grew up in Miami, Florida, and Southern California before moving to the San Jose area in 1983. Bingham was an aspiring filmmaker, and as a teenager, he began using a video camera as a personal diary to document his life and those of his family and friends. He graduated from Los Gatos High School as a two-year captain of his rugby team in 1988. As an undergraduate at the University of California, Berkeley, Bingham played on two of Coach Jack Clark's national-championship-winning rugby teams in the early 1990s. He also joined the Chi Psi fraternity, eventually becoming its president. Upon graduation at the age of 21, Bingham came out as gay to his family and friends.\nRugby and business career.\nA large athlete at and , Bingham also played for the gay-inclusive rugby union team San Francisco Fog RFC. Bingham played No. 8 in their first two friendly matches. He played in their first tournament, and taught his teammates his favorite rugby songs.\nAt the time of his death, Bingham had recently opened a satellite office of his public relations firm in New York City and was spending more time on the East Coast. He discussed plans with his friend Scott Glaessgen to form a New York City rugby team, the Gotham Knights.\nSeptember 11, 2001.\nOn the morning of September 11, Bingham overslept and nearly missed his flight, on his way to San Francisco to be an usher in his fraternity brother Joseph Salama's wedding. He arrived at Terminal A at Newark International Airport at 7:40 am, ran to Gate 17, and was the last passenger to board United Airlines Flight 93, taking seat 4D, next to passenger Tom Burnett.\nFlight 93 was scheduled to depart at 8:00 am, but the plane did not depart until 42 minutes later due to runway traffic delays. Four minutes later, American Airlines Flight 11 crashed into the World Trade Center's North Tower. At 9:03 am, as United Airlines Flight 175 crashed into the South Tower, Flight 93 climbed to cruising altitude, heading west over New Jersey and into Pennsylvania. At 9:25 am, Flight 93 was above eastern Ohio, and pilots Jason Dahl and LeRoy Homer received an alert, \"Beware of cockpit intrusion,\" on the cockpit computer device ACARS (Aircraft Communications and Reporting System). Three minutes later, Cleveland controllers could hear screams over the cockpit's open microphone. Moments later, the hijackers, led by the Lebanese Ziad Jarrah, took over the plane's controls and told passengers, \"Keep remaining sitting. We have a bomb on board\". Bingham and the other passengers were herded into the back of the plane. Within six minutes, the plane changed course and headed for Washington, D.C. Several of the passengers made phone calls to loved ones, who informed them about the two planes that had crashed into the World Trade Center.\nAfter the hijackers veered the plane sharply south, the passengers decided to act. Bingham, along with Todd Beamer, Tom Burnett, and Jeremy Glick, formed a plan to take the plane back from the hijackers. They relayed this plan to their loved ones and the authorities via telephone. Bingham got through to his aunt's home in California. Bingham stated, \"This is Mark Bingham. I want to let you guys know that I love you, in case I don't see you again...I'm on United Airlines, Flight 93. It's being hijacked.\" According to \"The Week\", Hoagland formed the impression that her son spoke \"confidentially\" with a fellow passenger, to form a plan to retake the plane. According to ABC News, the call cut off after about three minutes. Hoagland, after seeing news reports of the plane's hijacking, called him back and left two messages for him, calmly saying, \"Mark, this is your mom. The news is that it's been hijacked by terrorists. They are planning to probably use the plane as a target to hit some site on the ground. I would say go ahead and do everything you can to overpower them, because they are hellbent. Try to call me back if you can.\" Bingham, Burnett, and Glick were each more than tall, well-built and fit. As they made their decision to retake the plane, Glick related this over the phone to his wife, Lyz. Fellow passenger Todd Beamer, speaking to GTE-Verizon Lisa Jefferson and the FBI, related that he too was part of this group. They were joined by other passengers, including Lou Nacke, Rich Guadagno, Alan Beaven, Honor Elizabeth Wainio, Linda Gronlund, and William Cashman, along with flight attendants Sandra Bradshaw and Cee Cee Lyles, in discussing their options and voting on a course of action, ultimately deciding to storm the cockpit and take over the plane.\nAccording to the \"9/11 Commission Report\", after the plane's cockpit voice recorder was recovered, it revealed pounding and crashing sounds against the cockpit door and shouts and screams in English. \"Let's get them!\" a passenger cries. A hijacker shouts, \"All\u0101hu \u02beakbar!\" (\"God is great\"). Jarrah repeatedly pitched the plane to knock passengers off their feet, but the passengers apparently managed to invade the cockpit, where one was heard shouting, \"In the cockpit. If we don't, we'll die.\" At 10:02 am, a hijacker ordered, \"Pull it down! Pull it down!\" The 9/11 Commission later reported that the plane's control wheel was turned hard to the right, causing it to roll on its back and plow into an empty field in Shanksville, Pennsylvania, at , killing everyone on board. The plane was 20 minutes of flying time away from its suspected target, the White House or the U.S. Capitol Building in Washington, D.C. According to Vice President Dick Cheney, President George W. Bush gave the order to shoot the plane down.\nLegacy.\nBingham is survived by his parents and the Hoagland family members who played a part in his upbringing, by his stepmother and various stepsiblings, and by his partner of six years, Paul Holm. Holm described Bingham as a brave, competitive man, saying, \"He hated to lose\u2014at anything.\" He was known to proudly display a scar he received after being gored at the Running of the Bulls in Pamplona, Spain. He is buried at Madronia Cemetery, Saratoga, California.\nU.S. Senators John McCain and Barbara Boxer honored Bingham on September 17, 2001, in a ceremony for San Francisco Bay Area victims of the attacks, presenting a folded American flag to Paul Holm. All of the former, current, and future U.S. Presidents at the time gave praise to Bingham, including, Gerald Ford, Jimmy Carter, Ronald Reagan, George H.W. Bush, Bill Clinton, George W. Bush, Barack Obama, Donald Trump, and Joe Biden.\nThe Mark Kendall Bingham Memorial Tournament (referred to as the Bingham Cup), a biennial international rugby union competition predominantly for gay and bisexual men, was established in 2002 in his memory.\nBingham, along with the other passengers on Flight 93, was posthumously awarded the Arthur Ashe Courage Award in 2002.\nThe Eureka Valley Recreation Center's Gymnasium in San Francisco was renamed the Mark Bingham Gymnasium in August 2002.\nSinger Melissa Etheridge dedicated the song \"Tuesday Morning\" in 2004 to his memory.\nBeginning in 2005, the UC Berkeley Foundation and the California Alumni Association named the Mark Bingham Award for Excellence in Achievement by Young Alumni in his honor. According to the university, the goal of the award is to honor \"a young alumnus/a who graduated within the last 10 years who has made a significant contribution to his/her community, country, or the world at large.\" The award is presented at the school's annual Berkeley Charter Gala.\nAt the National 9/11 Memorial, Bingham and other passengers from Flight 93 are memorialized at the South Pool, on Panel S-67.\nAt the Flight 93 National Memorial in Pennsylvania, Bingham's name is located on one of the 40 panels of polished, granite that comprise the Memorial's Wall of Names.\nThe 2013 feature-length documentary \"The Rugby Player\" focuses on Bingham and the bond he had with his mother, Alice Hoagland, a former United Airlines flight attendant who, following his death, became an authority on airline safety and a champion of LGBT rights. Described by ESPN as \"an insightful and stereotype-shattering exploration\" of Bingham's life, the film, directed by Scott Gracheff, relies on the vast amount of video footage Bingham himself shot beginning in his teens until weeks before his death. The film's alternate title, \"With You\", is a popular rugby term, and one of Bingham's favorite expressions. The film premiered on Australia's ABC2 on August 20, 2014.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

One parameter of manner is \"stricture,\" that is, how closely the speech organs approach one another. Others include those involved in the r-like sounds (taps and trills), and the sibilancy of fricatives.\nThe concept of manner is mainly used in the discussion of consonants, although the movement of the articulators will also greatly alter the resonant properties of the vocal tract, thereby changing the formant structure of speech sounds that is crucial for the identification of vowels. For consonants, the place of articulation and the degree of phonation or voicing are considered separately from manner, as being independent parameters. Homorganic consonants, which have the same place of articulation, may have different manners of articulation. Often nasality and laterality are included in manner, but some phoneticians, such as Peter Ladefoged, consider them to be independent.\nBroad classifications.\nManners of articulation with substantial obstruction of the airflow (stops, fricatives, affricates) are called obstruents. These are prototypically voiceless, but voiced obstruents are extremely common as well. Manners without such obstruction (nasals, liquids, approximants, and also vowels) are called sonorants because they are nearly always voiced. Voiceless sonorants are uncommon, but are found in Welsh and Classical Greek (the spelling \"rh\"), in Standard Tibetan (the \"lh\" of Lhasa), and the \"wh\" in those dialects of English that distinguish \"which\" from \"witch\".\nSonorants may also be called resonants, and some linguists prefer that term, restricting the word 'sonorant' to non-vocoid resonants (that is, nasals and liquids, but not vowels or semi-vowels). Another common distinction is between occlusives (stops, nasals and affricates) and continuants (all else).\nStricture.\nFrom greatest to least stricture, speech sounds may be classified along a cline as stop consonants (with \"occlusion\", or blocked airflow), fricative consonants (with partially blocked and therefore strongly turbulent airflow), approximants (with only slight turbulence), tense vowels, and finally lax vowels (with full unimpeded airflow). Affricates often behave as if they were intermediate between stops and fricatives, but phonetically they are sequences of a stop and fricative.\nOver time, sounds in a language may move along the cline toward less stricture in a process called lenition or towards more stricture in a process called fortition.\nOther parameters.\nSibilants are distinguished from other fricatives by the shape of the tongue and how the airflow is directed over the teeth. Fricatives at coronal places of articulation may be sibilant or non-sibilant, sibilants being the more common.\nFlaps (also called taps) are similar to very brief stops. However, their articulation and behavior are distinct enough to be considered a separate manner, rather than just length. The main articulatory difference between flaps and stops is that, due to the greater length of stops compared to flaps, a build-up of air pressure occurs behind a stop which does not occur behind a flap. This means that when the stop is released, there is a burst of air as the pressure is relieved, while for flaps there is no such burst.\nTrills involve the vibration of one of the speech organs. Since trilling is a separate parameter from stricture, the two may be combined. Increasing the stricture of a typical trill results in a trilled fricative. Trilled affricates are also known.\nNasal airflow may be added as an independent parameter to any speech sound. It is most commonly found in nasal occlusives and nasal vowels, but nasalized fricatives, taps, and approximants are also found. When a sound is not nasal, it is called \"oral.\"\nLaterality is the release of airflow at the side of the tongue. This can be combined with other manners, resulting in lateral approximants (such as the pronunciation of the letter L in the English word \"let\"), lateral flaps, and lateral fricatives and affricates.\nOther airstream initiations.\nAll of these manners of articulation are pronounced with an airstream mechanism called pulmonic egressive, meaning that the air flows outward, and is powered by the lungs (actually the ribs and diaphragm). Other airstream mechanisms are possible. Sounds that rely on some of these include:\nExternal links.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"IPA common/styles.css\" /&gt;&lt;templatestyles src=\"IPA pulmonic consonants/styles.css\" /&gt;&lt;templatestyles src=\"IPA co-articulated consonants/styles.css\" /&gt;&lt;templatestyles src=\"IPA vowels/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "19945", "revid": "50279579", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19945", "title": "Motherboard", "text": "Main printed circuit board used for a computing device\nA motherboard, also called a mainboard, a system board, a logic board, and informally a mobo (see \"Nomenclature\" section), is the main printed circuit board (PCB) in general-purpose computers and other expandable systems. It holds and allows communication between many of the crucial electronic components of a system, such as the central processing unit (CPU) and memory, and provides connectors for other peripherals. \nUnlike a backplane, a motherboard usually contains significant sub-systems, such as the CPU, the chipset's input/output and memory controllers, interface connectors, and other components integrated for general use.\nNomenclature.\n\"Oxford English Dictionary\" traces the origin of the word \"motherboard\" to 1965, its earliest-found attestation occurring in the magazine \"Electronics\". The term alludes to its importance and size compared to the components attached to it, being the \"mother of all boards\" in a computer system.\nSeveral alternative terms for \"motherboard\" have been used in technical documentation and industry practice, including \"mainboard\", \"system board\", \"logic board\", \"baseboard\", and the informal \"mobo\". These terms are functionally synonymous and reflect regional, corporate, or contextual preferences rather than a coordinated effort to adopt gender-neutral language.\n\"System board\" was used by IBM in documentation for the IBM PC and its derivatives; however, higher-end models in the PS/2 line, such as the Model 80, used the term \"planar\" instead. Apple commonly uses \"logic board\" in its technical documentation for products such as the Apple II and the Mac. Intel typically uses \"baseboard\" in its technical manuals, though it also uses \"motherboard\" interchangeably. The term \"mobo\" is an informal truncation of \"motherboard\", popularized by computer enthusiasts and builders in the 1990s.\nThe term \"mainboard\" sometimes describes a device with a single board and no additional expansions or capability, such as controlling boards in laser printers, television sets, washing machines, mobile phones, and other embedded systems with limited expansion abilities.\nHistory.\nBefore the advent of the microprocessor, the central processing unit (CPU) of a computer was typically implemented using multiple printed circuit boards housed in a card cage, interconnected via a backplane\u2014a board containing sockets into which the individual circuit boards were inserted. Early systems used discrete copper wiring between connector pins, but printed circuit boards quickly became the standard. The CPU, main memory, and peripheral components were each located on separate boards connected through the backplane.\nWith the rise of microprocessors, CPU functionality and supporting circuitry were consolidated onto a single board, while memory and peripherals remained on separate expansion cards plugged into the backplane. A prominent example is the S-100 bus, widely used in 1970s microcomputer systems such as the Altair 8800.\nIn the 1980s, popular personal computers like the Apple II and IBM Personal Computer featured publicly available schematic diagrams and technical documentation. This openness enabled rapid reverse engineering and the development of third-party motherboards. These clone and upgrade boards often provided enhanced performance or additional features, and were commonly used to modernize or replace original manufacturer hardware.\nDuring the late 1980s and early 1990s, it became economical to move an increasing number of peripheral functions onto the motherboard. In the late 1980s, personal computer motherboards began to include single ICs (also called Super I/O chips) capable of supporting a set of low-speed peripherals: PS/2 keyboard and mouse, floppy disk drive, serial ports, and parallel ports. By the late 1990s, many personal computer motherboards included consumer-grade embedded audio, video, storage, and networking functions without the need for any expansion cards at all; higher-end systems for 3D gaming and computer graphics typically retained only the graphics card as a separate component. Business PCs, workstations, and servers were more likely to need expansion cards, either for more robust functions, or for higher speeds; those systems often had fewer embedded components.\nLaptop and notebook computers that were developed in the 1990s integrated the most common peripherals. This even included motherboards with no upgradeable components, a trend that would continue as smaller systems were introduced after the turn of the century (like the tablet computer and the netbook). Memory, processors, network controllers, power source, and storage would be integrated into some systems.\nDesign.\nA motherboard provides the electrical connections by which the other components of the system communicate. Unlike a backplane, it also contains the central processing unit and hosts other subsystems and devices.\nA typical desktop computer has its microprocessor, main memory, and other essential components connected to the motherboard. Other components such as external storage, controllers for video display and sound, and peripheral devices may be attached to the motherboard as plug-in cards or via cables; in modern microcomputers, it is increasingly common to integrate some of these peripherals into the motherboard itself.\nAn important component of a motherboard is the microprocessor's supporting chipset, which provides the supporting interfaces between the CPU and the various buses and external components. This chipset determines, to an extent, the features and capabilities of the motherboard.\nModern motherboards include:\nAdditionally, nearly all motherboards include logic and connectors to support commonly used input devices, such as USB for mouse devices and keyboards. Early personal computers such as the Apple II and IBM PC include only this minimal peripheral support on the motherboard. Video interface hardware was also occasionally integrated into the motherboard; for example, on the Apple II. It was even less common on IBM-compatible computers, such as the IBM PCjr. Additional peripherals such as disk controllers and serial ports were provided as expansion cards.\nGiven the high thermal design power of high-speed computer CPUs and components, modern motherboards nearly always include heat sinks and mounting points for fans to dissipate excess heat.\nForm factor.\nMotherboards are produced in a variety of sizes and shapes called form factors, some of which are specific to individual computer manufacturers. However, the motherboards used in IBM-compatible systems are designed to fit various case sizes. As of 2024[ [update]], most desktop computer motherboards use the ATX standard form factor \u2014 even those found in Macintosh and Sun computers, which have not been built from commodity components. A case's motherboard and power supply unit (PSU) form factor must all match, though some smaller form factor motherboards of the same family will fit larger cases. For example, an ATX case will usually accommodate a microATX motherboard. Laptop computers generally use highly integrated, miniaturized, and customized motherboards. This is one of the reasons that laptop computers are difficult to upgrade and expensive to repair. Often the failure of one laptop component requires the replacement of the entire motherboard, which is usually more expensive than a desktop motherboard.\nCPU sockets.\nA CPU socket (central processing unit) or slot is an electrical component that attaches to a printed circuit board (PCB) and is designed to house a CPU (also called a microprocessor). It is a special type of integrated circuit socket designed for very high pin counts. A CPU socket provides many functions, including a physical structure to support the CPU, support for a heat sink, facilitating replacement (as well as reducing cost), and most importantly, forming an electrical interface both with the CPU and the PCB. CPU sockets on the motherboard can most often be found in most desktop and server computers (laptops typically use surface mount CPUs), particularly those based on the Intel x86 architecture. A CPU socket type and the motherboard chipset must support the CPU series and speed.\nIntegrated peripherals.\nWith the steadily declining costs and size of integrated circuits, it is now possible to include support for many peripherals on the motherboard. By combining many functions on one PCB, the physical size and total cost of the system may be reduced; highly-integrated motherboards are thus especially popular in small form factor and budget computers. The \"integrated peripherals\" may also be called \"onboard devices\".\nPeripheral card slots.\nA typical motherboard will have a different number of slots, depending on its standard and form factor.\nA standard, modern ATX motherboard will typically have two or three PCI-Express x16 slots for a graphics card, one or two legacy PCI slots for various expansion cards, and one or two PCI-E x1 (which has superseded PCI). A standard EATX motherboard will have two to four PCI-E x16 slots for graphics cards, and a varying number of PCI and PCI-E x1 slots. It can sometimes also have a PCI-E x4 slot (although this will vary between brands and models).\nMany motherboards feature two or more PCI Express (PCIe) x16 slots, enabling support for multiple graphics cards or connecting multiple monitors directly without requiring specialized hardware. Some high-end models support multi-GPU technologies such as Nvidia's Scalable Link Interface (SLI) and AMD's CrossFire (formerly ATI CrossFire), which allow two to four graphics cards to operate in parallel, improving performance in graphics-intensive applications like gaming and video editing. However, as modern games and APIs increasingly favor single powerful GPUs, and with both Nvidia and AMD having largely discontinued active support for these technologies, multi-GPU configurations are now less common.\nModern motherboards typically include one or more M.2 slots\u2014some high-end models offer up to four. These slots support a variety of devices, including NVMe-based solid-state drives (SSDs), SATA-based M.2 SSDs, and wireless network interface controllers (such as Wi-Fi and Bluetooth modules). M.2 provides a compact, high-speed interface that leverages the PCIe or SATA bus, depending on the configuration.\nTemperature and reliability.\nMotherboards are generally air cooled, with heat sinks often mounted on larger chips in modern motherboards. Insufficient or improper cooling can cause damage to the internal components of the computer, or even cause it to crash. Passive cooling, or a single fan mounted on the power supply, was sufficient for many desktop computer CPUs until the late 1990s; since then, most have required CPU fans mounted on heat sinks, due to rising clock speeds and power consumption. Most motherboards have connectors for additional computer fans and integrated temperature sensors to detect motherboard and CPU temperatures and controllable fan connectors which the BIOS or operating system can use to regulate fan speed. Alternatively, computers can use a water cooling system instead of many fans.\nSome small form factor computers and home theater PCs designed for quiet and energy-efficient operation boast fan-less designs. This typically requires the use of a low-power CPU, as well as a careful layout of the motherboard and other components to allow for heat sink placement.\nA 2003 study found that some spurious computer crashes and general reliability issues, ranging from screen image distortions to I/O read/write errors, can be attributed not to software or peripheral hardware but to aging capacitors on PC motherboards. Ultimately, this was shown to be the result of a faulty electrolyte formulation, an issue termed capacitor plague.\nModern motherboards use electrolytic capacitors to filter the DC power distributed around the board. These capacitors age at a temperature-dependent rate, as their water based electrolytes slowly evaporate. This can lead to loss of capacitance and subsequent motherboard malfunctions due to voltage instabilities. While most capacitors are rated for 2000 hours of operation at , their expected design life roughly doubles for every below this. At a lifetime of 3 to 4 years can be expected. However, many manufacturers deliver substandard capacitors, which significantly reduce life expectancy. Inadequate case cooling and elevated temperatures around the CPU socket exacerbate this problem. With top blowers, the motherboard components can be kept under , effectively doubling the motherboard lifetime.\nMid-range and high-end motherboards, on the other hand, use solid capacitors exclusively. For every 10\u00a0\u00b0C less, their average lifespan is multiplied approximately by three, resulting in a 6-times higher lifetime expectancy at . These capacitors may be rated for 5000, 10000 or 12000 hours of operation at , extending the projected lifetime in comparison with standard solid capacitors.\nIn desktop PCs and notebook computers, the motherboard cooling and monitoring solutions are usually based on a super I/O chip or an embedded controller.\nBootstrapping.\nModern motherboards contain firmware stored in non-volatile memory such as ROM, EPROM, EEPROM, or NOR flash, which is responsible for initializing system hardware and loading an operating system from a boot device. The terms \"booting\" and \"bootstrapping\" derive from the metaphor \"pulling oneself up by one's bootstraps\", reflecting the self-starting nature of the process.\nIBM-compatible personal computers (PC).\nIn early microcomputers like the Apple II and IBM Personal Computer, firmware was stored in socketed ROM chips on the motherboard. Upon power-up, the central processing unit (CPU) would load its program counter with the address of the boot ROM and begin executing instructions from it. These instructions performed a power-on self-test (POST), initialized hardware components, displayed system information, verified random-access memory (RAM), and attempted to locate and load an operating system from a bootable peripheral device. If no such device was found, the system would either execute built-in software from ROM\u2014such as Cassette BASIC (commonly known as ROM BASIC)\u2014or display an error message, depending on the model. For instance, both the Apple II and the original IBM PC would launch their built-in BASIC interpreter when no bootable disk was present.\nThe boot firmware in modern IBM PC compatible motherboard designs contains either a BIOS, as did the boot ROM on the original IBM PC, or UEFI. UEFI is a successor to BIOS that became popular after Microsoft began requiring it for a system to be certified to run Windows 8.\nWhen the computer is powered on, the boot firmware tests and configures memory, circuitry, and peripherals. This Power-On Self Test (POST) may include testing some of the following things:\nSoCs and embedded systems.\nIn RISC processor based embedded systems, the simpler boot firmware, such as Das U-Boot, may be used on the motherboard.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Northern Mannerism continued into the early 17th century.\nMannerism encompasses a variety of approaches influenced by, and reacting to, the harmonious ideals associated with artists such as Leonardo da Vinci, Raphael, Vasari, and early Michelangelo. Where High Renaissance art emphasizes proportion, balance, and ideal beauty, Mannerism exaggerates such qualities, often resulting in compositions that are asymmetrical or unnaturally elegant. Notable for its artificial (as opposed to naturalistic) qualities, this artistic style privileges compositional tension and instability rather than the balance and clarity of earlier Renaissance painting. Mannerism in literature and music is notable for its highly florid style and intellectual sophistication.\nThe definition of Mannerism and the phases within it continue to be a subject of debate among art historians. For example, some scholars have applied the label to certain early modern forms of literature (especially poetry) and music of the 16th and 17th centuries. The term is also used to refer to some late Gothic painters working in northern Europe from about 1500 to 1530, especially the Antwerp Mannerists\u2014a group unrelated to the Italian movement. Mannerism has also been applied by analogy to the Silver Age of Latin literature.\nNomenclature.\nThe word \"Mannerism\" derives from the Italian \"maniera\", meaning \"style\" or \"manner\". Like the English word \"style\", \"maniera\" can either indicate a specific type of style (a beautiful style, an abrasive style) or indicate an absolute that needs no qualification (someone \"has style\"). In the second edition of his \"Lives of the Most Excellent Painters, Sculptors, and Architects\" (1568), Giorgio Vasari used \"maniera\" in three different contexts: to discuss an artist's manner or method of working; to describe a personal or group style, such as the term \"maniera greca\" to refer to the medieval Italo-Byzantine style or simply to the \"maniera\" of Michelangelo; and to affirm a positive judgment of artistic quality. Vasari was also a Mannerist artist, and he described the period in which he worked as \"la maniera moderna\", or the \"modern style\". James V. Mirollo describes how \"Bella maniera\" poets attempted to surpass in virtuosity the sonnets of Petrarch. This notion of \"Bella maniera\" suggests that artists who were thus inspired looked to copying and bettering their predecessors, rather than confronting nature directly. In essence, \"Bella maniera\" utilized the best from several source materials, synthesizing it into something new.\nAs a stylistic label, \"Mannerism\" is not easily defined. It was used by Swiss historian Jacob Burckhardt and popularized by German art historians in the early 20th century to categorize the seemingly uncategorizable art of the Italian 16th century\u2014art that was no longer found to exhibit the harmonious and rational approaches associated with the High Renaissance. \"High Renaissance\" connoted a period distinguished by harmony, grandeur, and the revival of classical antiquity. The term \"Mannerist\" was redefined in 1967 by John Shearman following the exhibition of Mannerist paintings organised by Fritz Grossmann at Manchester City Art Gallery in 1965.\nYet historians differ as to whether Mannerism is a style, a movement, or a period. Some authors have called it the \"Late Renaissance\". Although the term remains controversial, it is still commonly used to identify European art and culture in the 16th century.\nOrigin and development.\nBy the end of the High Renaissance, young artists experienced a crisis: It seemed that everything that could be achieved was already achieved. No more difficulties, technical or otherwise, remained to be solved. The detailed knowledge of anatomy, light, physiognomy and how humans register emotion in expression and gesture, the innovative use of the human form in figurative composition, and the use of the subtle gradation of tone, all had reached near perfection. The young artists needed to find a new goal, and they sought new approaches. At this point Mannerism started to emerge. The new style developed between 1510 and 1520 either in Florence, or in Rome, or both cities simultaneously.\nOrigins and models.\nThis period has been described as a \"natural extension\" of the art of Andrea del Sarto, Michelangelo, and Raphael. Michelangelo developed his style at an early age, a deeply original one that was greatly admired at first, then often copied and imitated by other artists of the era. One of the qualities most admired by his contemporaries was his \"terribilit\u00e0\", a sense of awe-inspiring grandeur, and subsequent artists attempted to imitate it. Other artists learned Michelangelo's impassioned and highly personal style by copying the works of the master, a standard way that students learned to paint and sculpt. His Sistine Chapel ceiling provided examples for them to follow, in particular his representation of collected figures often called \"ignudi\" and of the Libyan Sibyl, his vestibule to the Laurentian Library, the figures on his Medici tombs, and above all his \"Last Judgment\". The later Michelangelo was one of the great models of Mannerism. Young artists broke into his house and stole drawings from him. In his book \"Lives of the Most Eminent Painters, Sculptors, and Architects\", Giorgio Vasari noted that Michelangelo stated once: \"Those who are followers can never pass by whom they follow\".\nThe competitive spirit.\nThe competitive spirit was cultivated by patrons who encouraged sponsored artists to emphasize virtuosic technique and to compete with one another for commissions. It drove artists to look for new approaches and dramatically illuminated scenes, elaborate clothes and compositions, elongated proportions, highly stylized poses, and a lack of clear perspective. Leonardo da Vinci and Michelangelo were each given a commission by Gonfaloniere Piero Soderini to decorate a wall in the Hall of Five Hundred in Florence. These two artists were set to paint side by side and compete against each other, fueling the incentive to be as innovative as possible.\nEarly mannerism.\nThe early Mannerists in Florence\u2014especially the students of Andrea del Sarto such as Jacopo da Pontormo and Rosso Fiorentino\u2014are notable for elongated forms, precariously balanced poses, a collapsed perspective, irrational settings, and theatrical lighting. Parmigianino (a student of Correggio) and Giulio Romano (Raphael's head assistant) were moving in similarly stylized aesthetic directions in Rome. These artists had matured under the influence of the High Renaissance, and their style has been characterized as a reaction to or exaggerated extension of it. Instead of studying nature directly, younger artists began studying Hellenistic sculpture and paintings of masters past. Therefore, this style is often identified as \"anti-classical\", yet at the time it was considered a natural progression from the High Renaissance. The earliest experimental phase of Mannerism, known for its \"anti-classical\" forms, lasted until about 1540 or 1550. Marcia B. Hall, professor of art history at Temple University, notes in her book \"After Raphael\" that Raphael's premature death marked the beginning of Mannerism in Rome.\nIn past analyses, it has been noted that mannerism arose in the early 16th century contemporaneously with a number of other social, scientific, religious and political movements such as the Copernican heliocentrism, the Sack of Rome in 1527, and the Protestant Reformation's increasing challenge to the power of the Catholic Church. Because of this, the style's elongated forms and distorted forms were once interpreted as a reaction to the idealized compositions prevalent in High Renaissance art. This explanation for the radical stylistic shift c.\u20091520 has fallen out of scholarly favor, though early Mannerist art is still sharply contrasted with High Renaissance conventions; the accessibility and balance achieved by Raphael's \"School of Athens\" no longer seemed to interest young artists.\nHigh maniera.\nThe second period of Mannerism is commonly differentiated from the earlier, so-called \"anti-classical\" phase.\nSubsequent mannerists stressed intellectual conceits and artistic virtuosity, features that have led later critics to accuse them of working in an unnatural and affected \"manner\" (\"maniera\"). Maniera artists looked to their older contemporary Michelangelo as their principal model; theirs was an art imitating art, rather than an art imitating nature. Art historian Sydney Joseph Freedberg argues that the intellectualizing aspect of maniera art involves expecting its audience to notice and appreciate this visual reference\u2014a familiar figure in an unfamiliar setting enclosed between \"unseen, but felt, quotation marks\". The height of artifice is the Maniera painter's penchant for deliberately misappropriating a quotation. Agnolo Bronzino and Giorgio Vasari exemplify this strain of Maniera that lasted from about 1530 to 1580. Based largely at courts and in intellectual circles around Europe, Maniera art couples exaggerated elegance with exquisite attention to surface and detail: porcelain-skinned figures recline in an even, tempered light, acknowledging the viewer with a cool glance, if they make eye contact at all. The Maniera subject rarely displays much emotion, and for this reason works exemplifying this trend are often called 'cold' or 'aloof.' This is typical of the so-called \"stylish style\" or \"Maniera\" in its maturity.\nSpread.\nThe cities Rome, Florence, and Mantua were Mannerist centers in Italy. Venetian painting pursued a different course, represented by Titian in his long career. A number of the earliest Mannerist artists who had been working in Rome during the 1520s fled the city after the Sack of Rome in 1527. As they spread out across the continent in search of employment, their style was disseminated throughout Italy and Northern Europe. The result was the first international artistic style since the Gothic. Other parts of Northern Europe did not have the advantage of such direct contact with Italian artists, but the Mannerist style made its presence felt through prints and illustrated books. European rulers, among others, purchased Italian works, while northern European artists continued to travel to Italy, helping to spread the Mannerist style. Individual Italian artists working in the North gave birth to a movement known as the Northern Mannerism. Francis I of France, for example, was presented with Bronzino's \"Venus, Cupid, Folly and Time\". The style waned in Italy after 1580, as a new generation of artists, including the Carracci brothers, Caravaggio and Cigoli, revived naturalism. Walter Friedlaender identified this period as \"anti-mannerism\", just as the early Mannerists were \"anti-classical\" in their reaction away from the aesthetic values of the High Renaissance14 and today the Carracci brothers and Caravaggio are agreed to have begun the transition to Baroque-style painting which was dominant by 1600.\nOutside of Italy, however, Mannerism continued into the 17th century. In France, where Rosso traveled to work for the court at Fontainebleau, it is known as the \"Henry II style\" and had a particular impact on architecture. Other important continental centers of Northern Mannerism include the court of Rudolf II in Prague, as well as Haarlem, Antwerp and Danzig (Gda\u0144sk). Mannerism as a stylistic category is less frequently applied to English visual and decorative arts, where native labels such as \"Elizabethan\" and \"Jacobean\" are more commonly applied. Seventeenth-century Artisan Mannerism is one exception, applied to architecture that relies on pattern books rather than on existing precedents in Continental Europe.\nOf particular note is the Flemish influence at Fontainebleau that combined the eroticism of the French style with an early version of the vanitas tradition that would dominate seventeenth-century Dutch and Flemish painting. Prevalent at this time was the \"pittore vago\", a description of painters from the north who entered the workshops in France and Italy to create a truly international style.\nSculpture.\nAs in painting, early Italian Mannerist sculpture was very largely an attempt to find an original style that would top the achievement of the High Renaissance, which in sculpture essentially meant Michelangelo, and much of the struggle to achieve this was played out in commissions to fill other places in the Piazza della Signoria in Florence, next to Michelangelo's \"David\". Baccio Bandinelli took over the project of \"Hercules and Cacus\" from the master himself, but it was little more popular then than it is now, and maliciously compared by Benvenuto Cellini to \"a sack of melons\", though it had a long-lasting effect in apparently introducing relief panels on the pedestal of statues. Like other works of his and other Mannerists, it removes far more of the original block than Michelangelo would have done. Cellini's bronze \"Perseus with the Head of Medusa\" is certainly a masterpiece, designed with eight angles of view, another Mannerist characteristic, and artificially stylized in comparison with the \"David\"s of Michelangelo and Donatello. Originally a goldsmith, his famous gold and enamel Salt Cellar (1543) was his first sculpture, and shows his talent at its best.\nSmall bronze figures for collector's cabinets, often mythological subjects with nudes, were a popular Renaissance form at which Giambologna, originally Flemish but based in Florence, excelled in the later part of the century. He also created life-size sculptures, of which two entered the collection in the Piazza della Signoria. He and his followers devised elegant elongated examples of the \"figura serpentinata\", often of two intertwined figures, that were interesting from all angles.\nEarly theorists.\nGiorgio Vasari.\nGiorgio Vasari's opinions about the art of painting emerge in the praise he bestows on fellow artists in his multi-volume \"Lives of the Artists\": he believed that excellence in painting demanded refinement, richness of invention (\"invenzione\"), expressed through virtuoso technique (\"maniera\"), and wit and study that appeared in the finished work, all criteria that emphasized the artist's intellect and the patron's sensibility. The artist was now no longer just a trained member of a local Guild of St Luke. Now he took his place at court alongside scholars, poets, and humanists, in a climate that fostered an appreciation for elegance and complexity. The coat-of-arms of Vasari's Medici patrons appears at the top of his portrait, quite as if it were the artist's own. The framing of the woodcut image of Vasari's \"Lives\" would be called \"Jacobean\" in an English-speaking milieu. In it, Michelangelo's Medici tombs inspire the anti-architectural \"architectural\" features at the top, the papery pierced frame, the satyr nudes at the base. As a mere frame it is extravagant: Mannerist, in short..\nGian Paolo Lomazzo.\nAnother literary figure from the period is Gian Paolo Lomazzo, who produced two works\u2014one practical and one metaphysical\u2014that helped define the Mannerist artist's self-conscious relation to his art. His \"Trattato dell'arte della pittura, scoltura et architettura\" (Milan, 1584) is in part a guide to contemporary concepts of decorum, which the Renaissance inherited in part from Antiquity but Mannerism elaborated upon. Lomazzo's systematic codification of aesthetics, which typifies the more formalized and academic approaches typical of the later 16th century, emphasized a consonance between the functions of interiors and the kinds of painted and sculpted decors that would be suitable. Iconography, often convoluted and abstruse, is a more prominent element in the Mannerist styles. His less practical and more metaphysical \"Idea del tempio della pittura\" (\"The ideal temple of painting\", Milan, 1590) offers a description along the lines of the \"four temperaments\" theory of human nature and personality, defining the role of individuality in judgment and artistic invention.\nCharacteristics of artworks.\nMannerism was an anti-classical movement which differed greatly from the aesthetic ideologies of the Renaissance. Though Mannerism was initially accepted with positivity based on the writings of Vasari, it was later regarded in a negative light because it solely view as \"an alteration of natural truth and a trite repetition of natural formulas.\" As an artistic moment, Mannerism involves many characteristics that are unique and specific to experimentation of how art is perceived. Below is a list of many specific characteristics that Mannerist artists would employ in their artworks.\nArtists and examples of their work.\nJacopo da Pontormo.\nJacopo da Pontormo's work is one of the most important contributions to Mannerism. He often drew his subject matter from religious narratives; heavily influenced by the works of Michelangelo, he frequently alludes to or uses sculptural forms as models for his compositions. A well-known element of his work is the rendering of gazes by various figures which often pierce out at the viewer in various directions. Dedicated to his work, Pontormo often expressed anxiety about its quality and was known to work slowly and methodically. His legacy is highly regarded, as he influenced artists such as Agnolo Bronzino and the aesthetic ideals of late Mannerism.\nPontormo's \"Joseph in Egypt\", painted in 1517, portrays a running narrative of four Biblical scenes in which Joseph reconnects with his family. On the left side of the composition, Pontomoro depicts a scene of Joseph introducing his family to the Pharaoh of Egypt. On the right, Joseph is riding on a rolling bench, as cherubs fill the composition around him in addition to other figures and large rocks on a path in the distance. Above these scenes, is a spiral staircase which Joseph guides one his sons to their mother at the top. The final scene, on the right, is the final stage of Jacob's death as his sons watch nearby.\nPontormo's \"Joseph in Egypt\" features many Mannerist elements. One element is utilization of incongruous colors such as various shades of pinks and blues which make up a majority of the canvas. An additional element of Mannerism is the incoherent handling of time about the story of Joseph through various scenes and use of space. Through the inclusion of the four different narratives, Ponotormo creates a cluttered composition and overall sense of busyness.\nRosso Fiorentino and the School of Fontainebleau.\nRosso Fiorentino, who had been a fellow pupil of Pontormo in the studio of Andrea del Sarto, in 1530 brought Florentine Mannerism to Fontainebleau, where he became one of the founders of French 16th-century Mannerism, popularly known as the School of Fontainebleau.\nThe examples of a rich and hectic decorative style at Fontainebleau further disseminated the Italian style through the medium of engravings to Antwerp, and from there throughout Northern Europe, from London to Poland. Mannerist design was extended to luxury goods like silver and carved furniture. A sense of tense, controlled emotion expressed in elaborate symbolism and allegory, and an ideal of female beauty characterized by elongated proportions are features of this style.\nAgnolo Bronzino.\nAgnolo Bronzino was a pupil of Pontormo, whose style was very influential and often confusing in terms of figuring out the attribution of many artworks. During his career, Bronzino also collaborated with Vasari as a set designer for the production \"Comedy of Magicians\", where he painted many portraits. Bronzino's work was sought after, and he enjoyed great success when he became a court painter for the Medici family in 1539. A unique Mannerist characteristic of Bronzino's work was the rendering of milky complexions.\nIn the painting, \"Venus, Cupid, Folly and Time\", Bronzino portrays an erotic scene that leaves the viewer with more questions than answers. In the foreground, Cupid and Venus are nearly engaged in a kiss, but pause as if caught in the act. Above the pair are mythological figures, Father Time on the right, who pulls a curtain to reveal the pair and the representation of the goddess of the night on the left. The composition also involves a grouping of masks, a hybrid creature composed of features of a girl and a serpent, and a man depicted in agonizing pain. Many theories are available for the painting, such as it conveying the dangers of syphilis, or that the painting functioned as a court game.\nMannerist portraits by Bronzino are distinguished by a serene elegance and meticulous attention to detail. As a result, Bronzino's sitters have been said to project an aloofness and marked emotional distance from the viewer. There is also a virtuosic concentration on capturing the precise pattern and sheen of rich textiles. Specifically, within the \"Venus, Cupid, Folly and Time\", Bronzino utilizes the tactics of Mannerist movement, attention to detail, color, and sculptural forms. Evidence of Mannerist movement is apparent in the awkward movements of Cupid and Venus, as they contort their bodies to partly embrace. Particularly, Bronzino paints the complexion with the many forms as a perfect porcelain white with a smooth effacement of their muscles which provides a reference to the smoothness of sculpture.\nAlessandro Allori.\nAlessandro Allori's (1535\u20131607) \"Susanna and the Elders\" (\"below\") is distinguished by latent eroticism and consciously brilliant still life detail, in a crowded, contorted composition.\nJacopo Tintoretto.\nJacopo Tintoretto has been known for his vastly different contributions to Venetian painting after the legacy of Titian. His work, which differed greatly from his predecessors, had been criticized by Vasari for its, \"fantastical, extravagant, bizarre style.\" Within his work, Tintoretto adopted Mannerist elements that have distanced him from the classical notion of Venetian painting, as he often created artworks which contained elements of fantasy and retained naturalism. Other unique elements of Tintoretto's work include his attention to color through the regular utilization of rough brushstrokes and experimentation with pigment to create illusion.\nAn artwork that is associated with Mannerist characteristics is the \"Last Supper\"; it was commissioned by Michele Alabardi for the San Giorgio Maggiore in 1591. In Tintoretto's \"Last Supper\", the scene is portrayed from the angle of group of people along the right side of the composition. On the left side of the painting, Christ and the Apostles occupy one side of the table and single out Judas. Within the dark space, there are few sources of light; one source is emitted by Christ's halo and hanging torch above the table.\nIn its distinct composition, the \"Last Supper\" portrays Mannerist characteristics. One characteristic that Tintoretto utilizes is a black background. Though the painting gives some indication of an interior space through the use of perspective, the edges of the composition are mostly shrouded in shadow which provides drama for the central scene of the \"Last Supper\". Additionally, Tintoretto utilizes the spotlight effects with light, especially with the halo of Christ and the hanging torch above the table. A third Mannerist characteristic that Tintoretto employs are the atmospheric effects of figures shaped in smoke and float about the composition.\nEl Greco.\nThe Cretan-born Spanish painter El Greco attempted to express religious emotion with exaggerated traits. After the realistic depiction of the human form and the mastery of perspective achieved in High Renaissance, some artists started to deliberately distort proportions in disjointed, irrational space for emotional and artistic effect. El Greco still is a deeply original artist. He has been characterized by modern scholars as an artist so individual that he belongs to no conventional school. Key aspects of Mannerism in El Greco include the jarring \"acid\" palette, elongated and tortured anatomy, irrational perspective and light, and obscure and troubling iconography. El Greco's style was a culmination of unique developments based on his Greek heritage and travels to Spain and Italy.\nEl Greco's work reflects a multitude of styles including Byzantine elements as well as the influence of Caravaggio and Parmigianino in addition to Venetian coloring. An important element is his attention to color as he regarded it to be one of the most important aspects of his painting. Over the course of his career, El Greco's work remained in high demand as he completed important commissions in locations such as the Colegio de la Encarnaci\u00f3n de Madrid.\nEl Greco's unique painting style and connection to Mannerist characteristics is visible in his \"Laoco\u00f6n\". Painted in 1610, it depicts the mythological tale of Laoco\u00f6n, who warned the Trojans about the danger of the wooden horse which was presented by the Greeks as peace offering to the goddess Minerva. As a result, Minerva retaliated in revenge by summoning serpents to kill Laoco\u00f6n and his two sons. Instead of being set against the backdrop of Troy, El Greco situated the scene near Toledo, Spain in order to \"universalize the story by drawing out its relevance for the contemporary world.\"\nEl Greco's unique style in \"Laoco\u00f6n\" exemplifies many Mannerist characteristics. Prevalent is the elongation of many of the human forms throughout the composition in conjunction with their serpentine movement, which provides a sense of elegance. An additional element of Mannerist style is the atmospheric effects in which El Greco creates a hazy sky and blurring of landscape in the background.\nBenvenuto Cellini.\nBenvenuto Cellini created the \"Cellini Salt Cellar\" of gold and enamel in 1540 featuring Poseidon and Amphitrite (water and earth) placed in uncomfortable positions and with elongated proportions. It is considered a masterpiece of Mannerist sculpture.\nLavinia Fontana.\nLavinia Fontana (1552\u20131614) was a Mannerist portraitist often acknowledged to be the first female career artist in Western Europe. She was appointed to be the Portraitist in Ordinary at the Vatican. Her style is characterized as being influenced by the Carracci family of painters by the colors of the Venetian School. She is known for her portraits of noblewomen, and for her depiction of nude figures, which was unusual for a woman of her time.\nTaddeo Zuccaro (or Zuccari).\nTaddeo Zuccaro was born in Sant'Angelo in Vado, near Urbino, the son of Ottaviano Zuccari, an almost unknown painter. His brother Federico, born around 1540, was also a painter and architect.\nFederico Zuccaro (or Zuccari).\nFederico Zuccaro's documented career as a painter began in 1550, when he moved to Rome to work under Taddeo, his elder brother. He went on to complete decorations for Pius IV, and help complete the fresco decorations at the Villa Farnese at Caprarola. Between 1563 and 1565, he was active in Venice with the Grimani family of Santa Maria Formosa. During his Venetian period, he traveled alongside Palladio in Friuli.\nJoachim Wtewael.\nJoachim Wtewael (1566\u20131638) continued to paint in a Northern Mannerist style until the end of his life, ignoring the arrival of the Baroque art, and making him perhaps the last significant Mannerist artist still to be working. His subjects included large scenes with still life in the manner of Pieter Aertsen, and mythological scenes, many small cabinet paintings beautifully executed on copper, and most featuring nudity.\nGiuseppe Arcimboldo.\nGiuseppe Arcimboldo is most readily known for his artworks that incorporate still life and portraiture. His style is viewed as Mannerist with the assemblage style of fruits and vegetables in which its composition can be depicted in various ways\u2014right side up and upside down. Arcimboldo's artworks have also applied to Mannerism in terms of humor that it conveys to viewers, because it does not hold the same degree of seriousness as Renaissance works. Stylistically, Arcimboldo's paintings are known for their attention to nature and concept of a \"monstrous appearance\".\nOne of Arcimboldo's paintings which contains various Mannerist characteristics is, \"Vertumnus\". Painted against a black background is a portrait of Rudolf II, whose body is composed of various vegetables, flowers, and fruits. The joke of the painting communicates the humor of power which is that Emperor Rudolf II is hiding a dark inner self behind his public image. On the other hand, the serious tone of the painting foreshadows the good fortune that would be prevalent during his reign.\n\"Vertumnus\" contains various Mannerist elements in terms of its composition and message. One element is the flat, black background which Arcimboldo utilizes to emphasize the status and identity of the Emperor, as well as highlighting the fantasy of his reign. In the portrait of Rudolf II, Arcimboldo also strays away from the naturalistic representation of the Renaissance, and explores the construction of composition by rendering him from a jumble of fruits, vegetables, plants and flowers. Another element of Mannerism which the painting portrays is the dual narrative of a joke and serious message; humor wasn't normally utilized in Renaissance artworks.\nArchitecture.\nMannerist architecture was characterized by visual trickery and unexpected elements that challenged the Renaissance norms. Flemish artists, many of whom had traveled to Italy and were influenced by Mannerist developments there, were responsible for the spread of Mannerist trends into Europe north of the Alps, including into the realm of architecture. During the period, architects experimented with using architectural forms to emphasize solid and spatial relationships. The Renaissance ideal of harmony gave way to freer and more imaginative rhythms. The best known architect associated with the Mannerist style, and a pioneer at the Laurentian Library, was Michelangelo (1475\u20131564). He is credited with inventing the giant order, a large pilaster or column that stretches from the bottom to the top of a multi-storey fa\u00e7ade. He used this in his design for the Piazza del Campidoglio in Rome. The Herrerian style ( or \"arquitectura herreriana\") of architecture was developed in Spain during the last third of the 16th century under the reign of Philip II (1556\u20131598), and continued in force in the 17th century, but transformed by the Baroque style of the time. It corresponds to the third and final stage of the Spanish Renaissance architecture, which evolved into a progressive purification ornamental, from the initial Plateresque to classical Purism of the second third of the 16th century and total nudity decorative that introduced the Herrerian style.\nPrior to the 20th century, the term \"Mannerism\" had negative connotations, but it is now used to describe the historical period in more general, non-judgmental terms. Mannerist architecture has also been used to describe a trend in the 1960s and 1970s that involved breaking the norms of modernist architecture while at the same time recognizing their existence. Defining Mannerism in this context, architect and author Robert Venturi wrote \"Mannerism for architecture of our time that acknowledges conventional order rather than original expression but breaks the conventional order to accommodate complexity and contradiction and thereby engages ambiguity unambiguously.\"\nRenaissance examples.\nAn example of Mannerist architecture is the Villa Farnese at Caprarola, in the rugged countryside outside of Rome. The proliferation of engravers during the 16th century spread Mannerist styles more quickly than any previous styles.\nDense with ornament of \"Roman\" detailing, the display doorway at Colditz Castle exemplifies the northern style, characteristically applied as an isolated \"set piece\" against unpretentious vernacular walling.\nFrom the late 1560s onwards, many buildings in Valletta, the new capital city of Malta, were designed by the architect Girolamo Cassar in the Mannerist style. Such buildings include St. John's Co-Cathedral, the Grandmaster's Palace and the seven original auberges. Many of Cassar's buildings were modified over the years, especially in the Baroque period. However, a few buildings, such as Auberge d'Aragon and the exterior of St. John's Co-Cathedral, retain most of Cassar's original Mannerist design.\nWhile many architectural styles explore harmonious ideals, Mannerism wants to take style a step further and explores the aesthetics of hyperbole and exaggeration. Mannerism is notable for its intellectual sophistication as well as its artificial (as opposed to naturalistic) qualities. Mannerism favours compositional tension and instability rather than balance and clarity. The definition of Mannerism, and the phases within it, continues to be the subject of debate among art historians.\nNorthern or Antwerp Mannerism predates and is distinct from Italian Mannerism. Antwerp during its 16th-century boom produced a style that was the last phase of Early Netherlandish painting with Early Renaissance elements. Through Antwerp, Renaissance and Mannerist styles were widely introduced in England, Germany, and northern and eastern Europe in general.\nLiterature and music.\nLiterary mannerism involved such figures as Michelangelo, Cl\u00e9ment Marot, Giovanni della Casa, Giovanni Battista Guarini, Torquato Tasso, Veronica Franco, Miguel de Cervantes, and others.\nIn English literature, Mannerism is commonly identified with the qualities of the \"Metaphysical poets\" of whom the most famous is John Donne. The witty sally of a Baroque writer, John Dryden, against the verse of Donne in the previous generation, affords a concise contrast between Baroque and Mannerist aims in the arts:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;He affects the metaphysics, not only in his satires but in his amorous verses, \"where nature only\" should reign; and \"perplexes the minds\" of the fair sex with \"nice\" \"speculations\" of philosophy when he should \"engage their hearts\" and entertain them with the softnesses of love. (italics added)\nThe rich musical possibilities in the poetry of the late 16th and early 17th centuries provided an attractive basis for the madrigal, which quickly rose to prominence as the pre-eminent musical form in Italian musical culture, as discussed by Tim Carter:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The madrigal, particularly in its aristocratic guise, was obviously a vehicle for the 'stylish style' of Mannerism, with poets and musicians revelling in witty conceits and other visual, verbal and musical tricks to delight the connoisseur.\nThe word Mannerism has also been used to describe the style of highly florid and contrapuntally complex polyphonic music made in France in the late 14th century. This period is now usually referred to as the \"ars subtilior\".\nMannerism and theatre.\n\"The Early Commedia dell'Arte (1550\u20131621): The Mannerist Context\" by Paul Castagno discusses Mannerism's effect on the contemporary professional theatre. Castagno's was the first study to define a theatrical form as Mannerist, employing the vocabulary of Mannerism and maniera to discuss the typification, exaggerated, and \"effetto meraviglioso\" of the \"comici dell'arte\". See Part II of the above book for a full discussion of Mannerist characteristics in the commedia dell'arte. The study is largely iconographic, presenting a pictorial evidence that many of the artists who painted or printed commedia images were in fact, coming from the workshops of the day, heavily ensconced in the maniera tradition.\nThe preciosity in Jacques Callot's minute engravings seem to belie a much larger scale of action. Callot's \"Balli di Sfessania\" (lit.\u2009'dance of the buttocks') celebrates the commedia's blatant eroticism, with protruding phalli, spears posed with the anticipation of a comic ream, and grossly exaggerated masks that mix the bestial with human. The eroticism of the \"innamorate\" (\"lovers\") including the baring of breasts, or excessive veiling, was quite in vogue in the paintings and engravings from the second School of Fontainebleau, particularly those that detect a Franco-Flemish influence. Castagno demonstrates iconographic linkages between genre painting and the figures of the commedia dell'arte that demonstrate how this theatrical form was embedded within the cultural traditions of the late cinquecento.\nCommedia dell'arte, \"disegno interno\", and the \"discordia concors\".\nImportant corollaries exist between the \"disegno interno\", which substituted for the \"disegno esterno\" (external design) in Mannerist painting. This notion of projecting a deeply subjective view as superseding nature or established principles (perspective, for example), in essence, the emphasis away from the object to its subject, now emphasizing execution, displays of virtuosity, or unique techniques. This inner vision is at the heart of commedia performance. For example, in the moment of improvisation the actor expresses his virtuosity without heed to formal boundaries, decorum, unity, or text. Arlecchino became emblematic of the mannerist \"discordia concors\" (the union of opposites), at one moment he would be gentle and kind, then, on a dime, become a thief violently acting out with his battle. Arlecchino could be graceful in movement, only in the next beat, to clumsily trip over his feet. Freed from the external rules, the actor celebrated the evanescence of the moment; much the way Benvenuto Cellini would dazzle his patrons by draping his sculptures, unveiling them with lighting effects and a sense of the marvelous. The presentation of the object became as important as the object itself.\nNeo-Mannerism.\nIn the 20th century, the rise of Neo-Mannerism stemmed from artist Ernie Barnes. The style was heavily influenced by both the Jewish Community, as well as the African-American Community, leading to \"The Beauty of the Ghetto\" exhibition between 1972 and 1979. The Exhibition toured major American cities, and was hosted by dignitaries, professional athletes, and celebrities. When the exhibition was on view in 1974 at the Museum of African Art in Washington, D.C., Rep. John Conyers stressed the important positive message of the exhibit in the \"Congressional Record\".\nThe style of Neo-Mannerism, as developed by Barnes, includes subjects with elongated limbs and bodies, as well as exaggerated movement. Another common theme was closed eyes of the subjects, as a visual representation of \"how blind we are to one another's humanity\". \"We look upon each other and decide immediately: This person is black, so he must be\u00a0... This person lives in poverty, so he must be\u00a0...\".\nTheatre and cinema.\nIn an interview, film director Peter Greenaway mentions Federico Fellini and Bill Viola as two major inspirations for his exhaustive and self-referential play with the insoluble tension between the database form of images and the various analogous and digital interfaces that structure them cinematically. This play can be called neo-mannerist precisely insofar as it is distinguished from the (neo-)baroque: \"Just as Roman Catholicism would offer you paradise and heaven, there is an equivalent commercial paradise being offered very largely by the whole capitalistic effect, which is associated with Western cinema. This is my political analogy in terms of the use of multimedia as a political weapon. I would equate, in a sense, the great baroque Counter-Reformation, its cultural activity, with what cinema, American cinema predominantly, has been doing in the last seventy years.\"\nAs a term of criticism.\nAccording to art critic Jerry Saltz, \"Neo-Mannerism\" (new Mannerism) is among several clich\u00e9s that are \"squeezing the life out of the art world.\" Neo-Mannerism describes art of the 21st century that is turned out by students whose academic teachers \"have scared [them] into being pleasingly meek, imitative, and ordinary\".\nFootnotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

She became internationally known in the late 1990s after U.S. president Bill Clinton admitted to having had an affair with her during her days as a White House intern between 1995 and 1997. The affair and its repercussions (which included Clinton's impeachment) became known as the Clinton\u2013Lewinsky scandal.\nFollowing the scandal, Lewinsky designed a line of handbags under her name, served as an advertising spokesperson for a diet plan, and worked as a television personality. She obtained a master's degree in psychology from the London School of Economics in 2006. In 2014, Lewinsky began speaking out as an activist against cyberbullying.\nEarly life.\nLewinsky was born in San Francisco, California, and grew up in an affluent family in Los Angeles, California. She lived in Brentwood, and later Beverly Hills. Her father is Bernard Lewinsky, an oncologist, who is the son of German Jews who emigrated from Germany in the 1920s, first moving to El Salvador and then finally to the United States when he was 14. Her mother, born Marcia Kay Vilensky, is an author who uses the name Marcia Lewis. In 1996, she wrote a \"gossip biography\", \"The Private Lives of the Three Tenors\". Lewinsky\u2019s maternal grandfather, Samuel M. Vilensky, was a Lithuanian Jew, and her maternal grandmother, Bronia Poleshuk, was born in the British Concession of Tianjin, China, to a Russian Jewish family. Lewinsky\u2019s parents divorced in 1988 and each has remarried.\nThe family attended Sinai Temple in Los Angeles and Lewinsky attended Sinai Akiba Academy, the school affiliated with the Temple. For her primary education, she attended the John Thomas Dye School in Bel-Air. Lewinsky attended Beverly Hills High School for three years before transferring to Bel Air Prep (later known as Pacific Hills School), graduating in 1991.\nFollowing her high school graduation, Lewinsky attended Santa Monica College while working for the drama department at Beverly Hills High School and at a tie shop. Andy Bleiler, her former high school drama instructor, alleged they began a five-year affair in 1992. \nIn 1993, she enrolled at Lewis &amp; Clark College in Portland, Oregon, graduating with a bachelor's degree in psychology in 1995.\nWith the assistance of a family connection, Lewinsky secured an unpaid summer White House internship in the office of White House chief of staff Leon Panetta. Lewinsky moved to Washington, D.C., and took up the position in July 1995. She moved to a paid posting in the White House Office of Legislative Affairs in December 1995.\nScandal.\nLewinsky stated that she had nine sexual encounters with President Bill Clinton in the Oval Office between November 1995 and March 1997. According to her testimony, these encounters involved oral sex and other sexual acts, but not sexual intercourse.\nClinton had previously been confronted with allegations of sexual misconduct during his time as Governor of Arkansas. Former Arkansas state employee Paula Jones filed a civil lawsuit against him alleging that he had sexually harassed her. Lewinsky's name surfaced during the discovery phase of Jones' case, when Jones' lawyers sought to show a pattern of behavior by Clinton which involved inappropriate sexual relationships with other government employees.\nIn April 1996, Lewinsky's superiors transferred her from the White House to the Pentagon because they felt that she was spending too much time with Clinton. At the Pentagon, she worked as an assistant to chief Pentagon spokesman Kenneth Bacon. In September 1997, after Lewinsky told co-worker Linda Tripp about her relationship with Clinton, Tripp began to secretly record their telephone conversations. Lewinsky left her position at the Pentagon in December 1997, and in January 1998 submitted an affidavit in the Paula Jones case denying any physical relationship with Clinton. Though she attempted to persuade Tripp to lie under oath in that case, Tripp gave the tapes to Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr, adding to his ongoing investigation into the Whitewater controversy. Starr then broadened his investigation beyond the Arkansas land use deal to include Lewinsky, Clinton, and others for possible perjury and subornation of perjury in the Jones case. Tripp reported the taped conversations to literary agent Lucianne Goldberg. She also convinced Lewinsky to save the gifts that Clinton had given her during their relationship and not to dry clean a blue dress that was stained with Clinton's semen. Under oath, Clinton denied having had \"a sexual affair\", \"sexual relations\", or \"a sexual relationship\" with Lewinsky.\nNews of the Clinton\u2013Lewinsky relationship broke in January 1998. On January 26, 1998, Clinton stated, \"I did not have sexual relations with that woman, Miss Lewinsky\" in a nationally televised White House news conference. The matter instantly occupied the news media, and Lewinsky spent the next weeks hiding from public attention in her mother's residence at the Watergate complex. News of Lewinsky's affair with Andy Bleiler, her former high school drama instructor, also came to light, and he turned over to Starr various souvenirs, photographs, and documents that Lewinsky had sent him and his wife during the time that she was in the White House.\nClinton had also said, \"There is not a sexual relationship, an improper sexual relationship or any other kind of improper relationship\" which he defended as truthful on August 17, 1998, because of his use of the present tense, arguing \"it depends on what the meaning of the word 'is' is\". Starr obtained a blue dress from Lewinsky with Clinton's semen stained on it, as well as testimony from her that the President had inserted a cigar into her vagina. Clinton stated, \"I did have a relationship with Miss Lewinsky that was not appropriate\", but he denied committing perjury because, according to Clinton, the legal definition of oral sex was not encompassed by \"sex\" \"per se\". In addition, he relied on the definition of \"sexual relations\" as proposed by the prosecution and agreed by the defense and by Judge Susan Webber Wright, who was hearing the Paula Jones case. Clinton claimed that certain acts were performed \"on\" him, not \"by\" him, and therefore he did not engage in sexual relations. Lewinsky's testimony to the Starr Commission, however, contradicted Clinton's claim of being totally passive in their encounters.\nClinton and Lewinsky were both called before a grand jury. Clinton testified via closed-circuit television, while Lewinsky testified in person. She was granted transactional immunity by the Office of the Independent Counsel in exchange for her testimony.\nLife after the scandal.\nLewinsky's immunity agreement restricted what she could talk about publicly, but she was able to cooperate with Andrew Morton in his writing of \"Monica's Story\", her biography which included her side of the Clinton affair. The book was published in March 1999; it was also excerpted as a cover story in \"Time\" magazine. On March 3, 1999, Barbara Walters interviewed Lewinsky on ABC's \"20/20\". The program was watched by 70 million Americans, which ABC said was a record for a news show. Lewinsky made about $500,000 from her participation in the book and another $1 million from international rights to the Walters interview, but was still beset by high legal bills and living costs.\nIn June 1999, \"Ms.\" magazine published a series of articles by writer Susan Jane Gilman, sexologist Susie Bright, and author-host Abiola Abrams arguing from three generations of women whether Lewinsky's behavior had any meaning for feminism. Also in 1999, Lewinsky declined to sign an autograph in an airport, saying, \"I'm kind of known for something that's not so great to be known for.\" She made a cameo appearance as herself in two sketches during the May 8, 1999, episode of NBC's \"Saturday Night Live\", a program that had lampooned her relationship with Clinton over the prior 16 months.\nIn September 1999, Lewinsky began to sell a line of handbags bearing her name, under the company name The Real Monica, Inc. They were sold online as well as at Henri Bendel in New York, Fred Segal in California, and The Cross in London. Lewinsky designed the bags\u2014described by \"New York\" magazine as \"hippie-ish, reversible totes\"\u2014and traveled frequently to supervise their manufacture in Louisiana.\nAt the start of 2000, Lewinsky began appearing in television commercials for the diet company Jenny Craig, Inc. The $1 million endorsement deal, which required Lewinsky to lose 40 or more pounds in six months, gained considerable publicity at the time. Lewinsky said that despite her desire to return to a more private life, she needed the money to pay off legal fees, and she believed in the product. A Jenny Craig spokesperson said of Lewinsky, \"She represents a busy active woman of today with a hectic lifestyle. And she has had weight issues and weight struggles for a long time. That represents a lot of women in America.\" The choice of Lewinsky as a role model proved controversial for Jenny Craig, and some of its private franchises switched to an older advertising campaign. The company stopped running the Lewinsky ads in February 2000, concluded her campaign entirely in April 2000, and paid her only $300,000 of the $1 million contracted for her involvement.\nAlso at the start of 2000, Lewinsky moved to New York City, lived in the West Village, and became an A-list guest in the Manhattan social scene. In February 2000, she appeared on MTV's \"The Tom Green Show\", in an episode in which the host took her to his parents' home in Ottawa in search of fabric for her new handbag business. Later in 2000, Lewinsky worked as a correspondent for Channel 5 in the UK, on the show \"Monica's Postcards\", reporting on U.S. culture and trends from a variety of locations.\nIn March 2002, Lewinsky, no longer bound by the terms of her immunity agreement, appeared in the HBO special, \"Monica in Black and White\", part of the \"America Undercover\" series. In it she answered a studio audience's questions about her life and the Clinton affair.\nLewinsky hosted a reality television dating program, \"Mr. Personality\", on Fox Television Network in 2003, where she advised young women contestants who were picking men hidden by masks. Some Americans tried to organize a boycott of advertisers on the show, to protest Lewinsky's capitalizing on her notoriety. Nevertheless, the show debuted to very high ratings, and Alessandra Stanley wrote in \"The New York Times\": \"after years of trying to cash in on her fame by designing handbags and other self-marketing schemes, Ms. Lewinsky has finally found a fitting niche on television.\" The same year she appeared as a guest on the programs \"V Graham Norton\" in the UK, \"High Chaparall\" in Sweden, and \"The View\" and \"Jimmy Kimmel Live!\" in the U.S.\nAfter Clinton's autobiography, \"My Life\", appeared in 2004, Lewinsky said in an interview with the British tabloid \"Daily Mail\":\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;He could have made it right with the book, but he hasn't. He is a revisionist of history. He has lied. ... I really didn't expect him to go into detail about our relationship. ... But if he had and he'd done it honestly, I wouldn't have minded. ... I did, though, at least expect him to correct the false statements he made when he was trying to protect the Presidency. Instead, he talked about it as though I had laid it all out there for the taking. I was the buffet and he just couldn't resist the dessert. ... This was a mutual relationship, mutual on all levels, right from the way it started and all the way through. ... I don't accept that he had to completely desecrate my character.\nBy 2005, Lewinsky found that she could not escape the spotlight in the U.S., which made both her professional and personal life difficult. She stopped selling her handbag line and moved to London to study social psychology at the London School of Economics. In December 2006, Lewinsky graduated with a Master of Science degree. Her thesis was titled, \"In Search of the Impartial Juror: An Exploration of the Third-Person Effect and Pre-Trial Publicity\". For the next decade, she tried to avoid publicity.\nLewinsky did correspond in 2009 with scholar Ken Gormley, who was writing an in-depth study of the Clinton scandals. Lewinsky wrote to Gormley that Clinton had lied under oath when asked detailed and specific questions about his relationship with her. In 2013, the items associated with Lewinsky that Bleiler had turned over to Starr were put up for auction by Bleiler's ex-wife, who had come into possession of them.\nDuring her decade out of the public eye, Lewinsky lived in London, Los Angeles, New York, and Portland but, due to her notoriety, had trouble finding employment in the communications and marketing jobs for nonprofit organizations where she had been interviewed.\nPublic re-emergence.\nIn May 2014, Lewinsky wrote an essay for \"Vanity Fair\" magazine titled \"Shame and Survival\", wherein she discussed her life and the scandal. She continued to maintain that the relationship was mutual and wrote that while Clinton took advantage of her, it was a consensual relationship. She added: \"I, myself, deeply regret what happened between me and President Clinton. Let me say it again: I. Myself. Deeply. Regret. What. Happened.\" However, she said it was now time to \"stick my head above the parapet so that I can take back my narrative and give a purpose to my past.\" The magazine later announced her as a \"Vanity Fair\" contributor, stating she would \"contribute to their website on an ongoing basis, on the lookout for relevant topics of interest\".\nIn July 2014, Lewinsky was interviewed in a three-part television special for the National Geographic Channel, titled \"The 90s: The Last Great Decade\". The series looked at various events of the 1990s, including the scandal that brought Lewinsky into the national spotlight. This was Lewinsky's first such interview in more than ten years.\nIn October 2014, she took a public stand against cyberbullying, calling herself \"patient zero\" of online harassment. Speaking at a \"Forbes\" magazine \"30 Under 30\" summit about her experiences in the aftermath of the scandal, she said, \"Having survived myself, what I want to do now is help other victims of the shame game survive, too.\" She said she was influenced by reading about the suicide of Tyler Clementi, a Rutgers University freshman, involving cyberbullying and joined Twitter to facilitate her efforts. In March 2015, Lewinsky continued to speak out publicly against cyberbullying, delivering a TED talk calling for a more compassionate Internet. In June 2015, she became an ambassador and strategic advisor for anti-bullying organization Bystander Revolution. The same month, she gave an anti-cyberbullying speech at the Cannes Lions International Festival of Creativity.&lt;ref name=\"Alter_6/25/2015\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2015, Lewinsky was interviewed by Amy Robach on \"Good Morning America\", about Bystander Revolution's Month of Action campaign for National Bullying Prevention Month. Lewinsky wrote the foreword to an October 2017 book by Sue Scheff and Melissa Schorr, \"Shame Nation: The Global Epidemic of Online Hate\".\nIn October 2017, Lewinsky tweeted the #MeToo hashtag to indicate that she was a victim of sexual harassment or sexual assault, but did not provide details. She wrote an essay in the March 2018 issue of \"Vanity Fair\" in which she did not directly explain why she used the #MeToo hashtag in October. She did write that looking back at her relationship with Bill Clinton, although it was consensual, because he was 27 years older than she and in a position with a lot more power than she had, in her opinion the relationship constituted an \"abuse of power\" on Clinton's part. She added that she had been diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder due to what she had experienced after the relationship was disclosed. In May 2018, Lewinsky was disinvited from an event hosted by \"Town &amp; Country\" when Bill Clinton accepted an invitation to the event.\nIn September 2018, Lewinsky spoke at a conference in Jerusalem. Following her speech, she sat for a Q&amp;A session with the host, journalist Yonit Levi. The first question Levi asked was whether Lewinsky thinks that Clinton owes her a private apology. Lewinsky refused to answer the question, and walked off the stage. She later tweeted that the question was posed in a pre-event meeting with Levi, and Lewinsky told her that such a question was off limits. A spokesman for the Israel Television News Company, which hosted the conference and is Levi's employer, responded that Levi had kept all the agreements she made with Lewinsky and honored her requests.\nIn 2019, she was interviewed by John Oliver on his HBO show \"Last Week Tonight with John Oliver\", where they discussed the importance of solving the problem of public shaming and how her situation may have been different if social media had existed at the time that the scandal broke in the late 1990s.\nOn August 6, 2019, it was announced that the Clinton\u2013Lewinsky scandal would be the focus of the third season of the television series \"American Crime Story\" with the title . The season began production in October 2020. Lewinsky was a co-producer. It consists of 10 episodes and premiered on September 7, 2021. The season portrays the Clinton\u2013Lewinsky scandal and is based on the book \"A Vast Conspiracy: The Real Story of the Sex Scandal That Nearly Brought Down a President\" by Jeffrey Toobin. The 28-year-old actress Beanie Feldstein plays Monica Lewinsky. In discussing the series and her observations on social media and cancel culture today in an interview with Kara Swisher for the New York Times Opinion podcast \"Sway\", Lewinsky noted that: &lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;I think that the first thing that went out the door in 1998 was the truth, and the second was context. And there\u2019s no nuance. And we were all women who were thrust into the spotlight underneath a political film or sheen. And we were all reduced. We were all reduced in different ways to serve purposes for other people, for either political points or to make money. In October 2021, she was executive producer of an HBO documentary \"15 Minutes of Shame\", directed by Max Joseph, which focused on public shaming, online shaming, and ostracism. \nLewinsky started her own production company, Alt Ending Productions, and signed a first look deal with 20th Television in June 2021.\nIn February 2025, she launched her podcast, \"Reclaiming with Monica Lewinsky\".\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "19951", "revid": "6727347", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19951", "title": "Pressure measurement", "text": " \nPressure measurement is the measurement of an applied force per unit area by a fluid (liquid or gas) on a surface. Pressure is typically expressed in units of pascals in the International System of Units (SI). Many techniques have been developed for the measurement of pressure and vacuum. Instruments used to measure and display pressure mechanically are called pressure gauges, vacuum gauges or compound gauges (vacuum &amp; pressure). The widely used Bourdon gauge is a mechanical device, which both measures and indicates and is probably the best known type of gauge.\nA vacuum gauge is used to measure pressures lower than the ambient atmospheric pressure, which is set as the zero point, in negative values (for instance, \u22121\u00a0bar or \u2212760\u00a0mmHg equals total vacuum). Most gauges measure pressure relative to atmospheric pressure as the zero point, so this form of reading is simply referred to as \"gauge pressure\". However, anything greater than total vacuum is technically a form of pressure. For very low pressures, a gauge that uses total vacuum as the zero point reference must be used, giving pressure reading as an absolute pressure.\nOther methods of pressure measurement involve sensors that can transmit the pressure reading to a remote indicator or control system (telemetry).\nAbsolute, gauge and differential pressures \u2014 zero reference.\nEveryday pressure measurements, such as for vehicle tire pressure, are usually made relative to ambient air pressure. In other cases measurements are made relative to a vacuum or to some other specific reference. When distinguishing between these zero references, the following terms are used:\nThe zero reference in use is usually implied by context, and these words are added only when clarification is needed. Tire pressure and blood pressure are gauge pressures by convention, while atmospheric pressures, deep vacuum pressures, and altimeter pressures must be absolute.\nFor most working fluids where a fluid exists in a closed system, gauge pressure measurement prevails. Pressure instruments connected to the system will indicate pressures relative to the current atmospheric pressure. The situation changes when extreme vacuum pressures are measured, then absolute pressures are typically used instead and measuring instruments used will be different.\nDifferential pressures are commonly used in industrial process systems. Differential pressure gauges have two inlet ports, each connected to one of the volumes whose pressure is to be monitored. In effect, such a gauge performs the mathematical operation of subtraction through mechanical means, obviating the need for an operator or control system to watch two separate gauges and determine the difference in readings.\nModerate \"vacuum pressure\" readings can be ambiguous without the proper context, as they may represent absolute pressure or gauge pressure without a negative sign. Thus a vacuum of 26\u00a0inHg gauge is equivalent to an absolute pressure of 4\u00a0inHg, calculated as 30\u00a0inHg (typical atmospheric pressure) \u2212 26\u00a0inHg (gauge pressure).\nAtmospheric pressure is typically about 100\u00a0kPa at sea level, but is variable with altitude and weather. If the absolute pressure of a fluid stays constant, the gauge pressure of the same fluid will vary as atmospheric pressure changes. For example, when a car drives up a mountain, the (gauge) tire pressure goes up because atmospheric pressure goes down. The absolute pressure in the tire is essentially unchanged.\nUsing atmospheric pressure as reference is usually signified by a \"g\" for gauge after the pressure unit, e.g. 70\u00a0psig, which means that the pressure measured is the total pressure minus atmospheric pressure. There are two types of gauge reference pressure: vented gauge (vg) and sealed gauge (sg).\nA vented-gauge pressure transmitter, for example, allows the outside air pressure to be exposed to the negative side of the pressure-sensing diaphragm, through a vented cable or a hole on the side of the device, so that it always measures the pressure referred to ambient barometric pressure. Thus a vented-gauge reference pressure sensor should always read zero pressure when the process pressure connection is held open to the air.\nA sealed gauge reference is very similar, except that atmospheric pressure is sealed on the negative side of the diaphragm. This is usually adopted on high pressure ranges, such as hydraulics, where atmospheric pressure changes will have a negligible effect on the accuracy of the reading, so venting is not necessary. This also allows some manufacturers to provide secondary pressure containment as an extra precaution for pressure equipment safety if the burst pressure of the primary pressure sensing diaphragm is exceeded.\nThere is another way of creating a sealed gauge reference, and this is to seal a high vacuum on the reverse side of the sensing diaphragm. Then the output signal is offset, so the pressure sensor reads close to zero when measuring atmospheric pressure.\nA sealed gauge reference pressure transducer will never read exactly zero because atmospheric pressure is always changing and the reference in this case is fixed at 1 bar.\nTo produce an absolute pressure sensor, the manufacturer seals a high vacuum behind the sensing diaphragm. If the process-pressure connection of an absolute-pressure transmitter is open to the air, it will read the actual barometric pressure.\nA sealed pressure sensor is similar to a gauge pressure sensor except that it measures pressure relative to some fixed pressure rather than the ambient atmospheric pressure (which varies according to the location and the weather).\nHistory.\nFor much of human history, the pressure of gases like air was ignored, denied, or taken for granted, but as early as the 6th century BC, Greek philosopher Anaximenes of Miletus claimed that all things are made of air that is simply changed by varying levels of pressure. He could observe water evaporating, changing to a gas, and felt that this applied even to solid matter. More condensed air made colder, heavier objects, and expanded air made lighter, hotter objects. This was akin to how gases really do become less dense when warmer, more dense when cooler.\nIn the 17th century, Evangelista Torricelli conducted experiments with mercury that allowed him to measure the presence of air. He would dip a glass tube, closed at one end, into a bowl of mercury and raise the closed end up out of it, keeping the open end submerged. The weight of the mercury would pull it down, leaving a partial vacuum at the far end. This validated his belief that air/gas has mass, creating pressure on things around it. Previously, the more popular conclusion, even for Galileo, was that air was weightless and it is vacuum that provided force, as in a siphon. The discovery helped bring Torricelli to the conclusion:\nThis test, known as Torricelli's experiment, was essentially the first documented pressure gauge.\nBlaise Pascal went further, having his brother-in-law try the experiment at different altitudes on a mountain, and finding indeed that the farther down in the ocean of atmosphere, the higher the pressure.\nUnits.\nThe SI unit for pressure is the pascal (Pa), equal to one newton per square metre (N\u00b7m\u22122 or kg\u00b7m\u22121\u00b7s\u22122). This special name for the unit was added in 1971; before that, pressure in SI was expressed in units such as N\u00b7m\u22122. When indicated, the zero reference is stated in parentheses following the unit, for example 101 kPa (abs). The pound per square inch (psi) is still in widespread use in the US and Canada, for measuring, for instance, tire pressure. A letter is often appended to the psi unit to indicate the measurement's zero reference; psia for absolute, psig for gauge, psid for differential, although this practice is discouraged by the NIST.\nBecause pressure was once commonly measured by its ability to displace a column of liquid in a manometer, pressures are often expressed as a depth of a particular fluid (\"e.g.,\" inches of water). Manometric measurement is the subject of pressure head calculations. The most common choices for a manometer's fluid are mercury (Hg) and water; water is nontoxic and readily available, while mercury's density allows for a shorter column (and so a smaller manometer) to measure a given pressure. The abbreviation \"W.C.\" or the words \"water column\" are often printed on gauges and measurements that use water for the manometer.\nFluid density and local gravity can vary from one reading to another depending on local factors, so the height of a fluid column does not define pressure precisely. So measurements in \"millimetres of mercury\" or \"inches of mercury\" can be converted to SI units as long as attention is paid to the local factors of fluid density and gravity. Temperature fluctuations change the value of fluid density, while location can affect gravity.\nAlthough no longer preferred, these manometric units are still encountered in many fields. Blood pressure is measured in millimetres of mercury (see torr) in most of the world, central venous pressure and lung pressures in centimeters of water are still common, as in settings for CPAP machines. Natural gas pipeline pressures are measured in inches of water, expressed as \"inches W.C.\"\nUnderwater divers use manometric units: the ambient pressure is measured in units of metres sea water (msw) which is defined as equal to one tenth of a bar. The unit used in the US is the foot sea water (fsw), based on standard gravity and a sea-water density of 64\u00a0lb/ft3. According to the US Navy Diving Manual, one fsw equals 0.30643\u00a0msw, , or , though elsewhere it states that 33\u00a0fsw is (one atmosphere), which gives one fsw equal to about 0.445\u00a0psi. The msw and fsw are the conventional units for measurement of diver pressure exposure used in decompression tables and the unit of calibration for pneumofathometers and hyperbaric chamber pressure gauges. Both msw and fsw are measured relative to normal atmospheric pressure.\nIn vacuum systems, the units torr (millimeter of mercury), micron (micrometer of mercury), and inch of mercury (inHg) are most commonly used. Torr and micron usually indicates an absolute pressure, while inHg usually indicates a gauge pressure.\nAtmospheric pressures are usually stated using hectopascal (hPa), kilopascal (kPa), millibar (mbar) or atmospheres (atm). In American and Canadian engineering, stress is often measured in kip. Stress is not a true pressure since it is not scalar. In the cgs system the unit of pressure was the barye (ba), equal to 1 dyn\u00b7cm\u22122. In the mts system, the unit of pressure was the pieze, equal to 1 sthene per square metre.\nMany other hybrid units are used such as mmHg/cm2 or grams-force/cm2 (sometimes as kg/cm2 without properly identifying the force units). Using the names kilogram, gram, kilogram-force, or gram-force (or their symbols) as a unit of force is prohibited in SI; the unit of force in SI is the newton (N).\nStatic and dynamic pressure.\nStatic pressure is uniform in all directions, so pressure measurements are independent of direction in an immovable (static) fluid. Flow, however, applies additional pressure on surfaces perpendicular to the flow direction, while having little impact on surfaces parallel to the flow direction. This directional component of pressure in a moving (dynamic) fluid is called dynamic pressure. An instrument facing the flow direction measures the sum of the static and dynamic pressures; this measurement is called the total pressure or stagnation pressure. Since dynamic pressure is referenced to static pressure, it is neither gauge nor absolute; it is a differential pressure.\nWhile static gauge pressure is of primary importance to determining net loads on pipe walls, dynamic pressure is used to measure flow rates and airspeed. Dynamic pressure can be measured by taking the differential pressure between instruments parallel and perpendicular to the flow. Pitot-static tubes, for example perform this measurement on airplanes to determine airspeed. The presence of the measuring instrument inevitably acts to divert flow and create turbulence, so its shape is critical to accuracy and the calibration curves are often non-linear.\nInstruments.\nA pressure sensor is a device for pressure measurement of gases or liquids. \nPressure sensors can alternatively be called pressure transducers, pressure transmitters, pressure senders, pressure indicators, piezometers and manometers, among other names.\nPressure is an expression of the force required to stop a fluid from expanding, and is usually stated in terms of force per unit area. A pressure sensor usually acts as a transducer; it generates a signal as a function of the pressure imposed. \nPressure sensors can vary drastically in technology, design, performance, application suitability and cost. A conservative estimate would be that there may be over 50 technologies and at least 300 companies making pressure sensors worldwide. There is also a category of pressure sensors that are designed to measure in a dynamic mode for capturing very high speed changes in pressure. Example applications for this type of sensor would be in the measuring of combustion pressure in an engine cylinder or in a gas turbine. These sensors are commonly manufactured out of piezoelectric materials such as quartz.\nSome pressure sensors are pressure switches, which turn on or off at a particular pressure. For example, a water pump can be controlled by a pressure switch so that it starts when water is released from the system, reducing the pressure in a reservoir.\nPressure range, sensitivity, dynamic response and cost all vary by several orders of magnitude from one instrument design to the next. The oldest type is the liquid column (a vertical tube filled with mercury) manometer invented by Evangelista Torricelli in 1643. The U-Tube was invented by Christiaan Huygens in 1661.\nThere are two basic categories of analog pressure sensors: force collector and other types.\nA pressure sensor, a resonant quartz crystal strain gauge with a Bourdon tube force collector, is the critical sensor of DART. DART detects tsunami waves from the bottom of the open ocean. It has a pressure resolution of approximately 1mm of water when measuring pressure at a depth of several kilometers.\nHydrostatic.\nHydrostatic gauges (such as the mercury column manometer) compare pressure to the hydrostatic force per unit area at the base of a column of fluid. Hydrostatic gauge measurements are independent of the type of gas being measured, and can be designed to have a very linear calibration. They have poor dynamic response.\nPiston.\nPiston-type gauges counterbalance the pressure of a fluid with a spring (for example tire-pressure gauges of comparatively low accuracy) or a solid weight, in which case it is known as a deadweight tester and may be used for calibration of other gauges.\nLiquid column (manometer).\nLiquid-column gauges consist of a column of liquid in a tube whose ends are exposed to different pressures. The column will rise or fall until its weight (a force applied due to gravity) is in equilibrium with the pressure differential between the two ends of the tube (a force applied due to fluid pressure). A very simple version is a U-shaped tube half-full of liquid, one side of which is connected to the region of interest while the reference pressure (which might be the atmospheric pressure or a vacuum) is applied to the other. The difference in liquid levels represents the applied pressure. The pressure exerted by a column of fluid of height \"h\" and density \"\u03c1\" is given by the hydrostatic pressure equation, \"P\" = \"hg\u03c1\". Therefore, the pressure difference between the applied pressure \"Pa\" and the reference pressure \"P\"0 in a U-tube manometer can be found by solving \"Pa\" \u2212 \"P\"0 \n \"hg\u03c1\". In other words, the pressure on either end of the liquid (shown in blue in the figure) must be balanced (since the liquid is static), and so \"Pa\" \n \"P\"0 + \"hg\u03c1\".\nIn most liquid-column measurements, the result of the measurement is the height \"h\", expressed typically in mm, cm, or inches. The \"h\" is also known as the pressure head. When expressed as a pressure head, pressure is specified in units of length and the measurement fluid must be specified. When accuracy is critical, the temperature of the measurement fluid must likewise be specified, because liquid density is a function of temperature. So, for example, pressure head might be written \"742.2\u00a0mmHg\" or \"4.2\u00a0inH2O at 59\u00a0\u00b0F\" for measurements taken with mercury or water as the manometric fluid respectively. The word \"gauge\" or \"vacuum\" may be added to such a measurement to distinguish between a pressure above or below the atmospheric pressure. Both mm of mercury and inches of water are common pressure heads, which can be converted to S.I. units of pressure using unit conversion and the above formulas.\nIf the fluid being measured is significantly dense, hydrostatic corrections may have to be made for the height between the moving surface of the manometer working fluid and the location where the pressure measurement is desired, except when measuring differential pressure of a fluid (for example, across an orifice plate or venturi), in which case the density \u03c1 should be corrected by subtracting the density of the fluid being measured.\nAlthough any fluid can be used, mercury is preferred for its high density (13.534\u00a0g/cm3) and low vapour pressure. Its convex meniscus is advantageous since this means there will be no pressure errors from wetting the glass, though under exceptionally clean circumstances, the mercury will stick to glass and the barometer may become stuck (the mercury can sustain a negative absolute pressure) even under a strong vacuum. For low pressure differences, light oil or water are commonly used (the latter giving rise to units of measurement such as inches water gauge and millimetres H2O). Liquid-column pressure gauges have a highly linear calibration. They have poor dynamic response because the fluid in the column may react slowly to a pressure change.\nOne of the disadvantages of the mercury manometer or barometer is that its reading is temperature dependent, a fact made clear by the use of mercury in glass thermometers.\nWhen measuring vacuum, the working liquid may evaporate and contaminate the vacuum if its vapor pressure is too high. When measuring liquid pressure, a loop filled with gas or a light fluid can isolate the liquids to prevent them from mixing, but this can be unnecessary, for example, when mercury is used as the manometer fluid to measure differential pressure of a fluid such as water. Simple hydrostatic gauges can measure pressures ranging from a few torrs (a few 100\u00a0Pa) to a few atmospheres (approximately ).\nA single-limb liquid-column manometer has a larger reservoir instead of one side of the U-tube and has a scale beside the narrower column. The column may be inclined to further amplify the liquid movement. Based on the use and structure, following types of manometers are used\nMcLeod gauge.\nA McLeod gauge isolates a sample of gas and compresses it in a modified mercury manometer until the pressure is a few millimetres of mercury. The technique is very slow and unsuited to continual monitoring, but is capable of good accuracy. Unlike other manometer gauges, the McLeod gauge reading is dependent on the composition of the gas, since the interpretation relies on the sample compressing as an ideal gas. Due to the compression process, the McLeod gauge completely ignores partial pressures from non-ideal vapors that condense, such as pump oils, mercury, and even water if compressed enough.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Block indent/styles.css\"/&gt;Useful range: from around 10\u22124\u00a0Torr (roughly 10\u22122\u00a0Pa) to vacuums as high as 10\u22126\u00a0Torr (0.1\u00a0mPa),\n0.1\u00a0mPa is the lowest direct measurement of pressure that is possible with current technology. Other vacuum gauges can measure lower pressures, but only indirectly by measurement of other pressure-dependent properties. These indirect measurements must be calibrated to SI units by a direct measurement, most commonly a McLeod gauge.\nAneroid.\nAneroid gauges are based on a metallic pressure-sensing element that flexes elastically under the effect of a pressure difference across the element. \"Aneroid\" means \"without fluid\", and the term originally distinguished these gauges from the hydrostatic gauges described above. However, aneroid gauges can be used to measure the pressure of a liquid as well as a gas, and they are not the only type of gauge that can operate without fluid. For this reason, they are often called mechanical gauges in modern language. Aneroid gauges are not dependent on the type of gas being measured, unlike thermal and ionization gauges, and are less likely to contaminate the system than hydrostatic gauges. The pressure sensing element may be a Bourdon tube, a diaphragm, a capsule, or a set of bellows, which will change shape in response to the pressure of the region in question. The deflection of the pressure sensing element may be read by a linkage connected to a needle, or it may be read by a secondary transducer. The most common secondary transducers in modern vacuum gauges measure a change in capacitance due to the mechanical deflection. Gauges that rely on a change in capacitance are often referred to as capacitance manometers.\nBourdon tube.\nThe Bourdon pressure gauge uses the principle that a flattened tube tends to straighten or regain its circular form in cross-section when pressurized. (A party horn illustrates this principle.) This change in cross-section may be hardly noticeable, involving moderate stresses within the elastic range of easily workable materials. The strain of the material of the tube is magnified by forming the tube into a C shape or even a helix, such that the entire tube tends to straighten out or uncoil elastically as it is pressurized. Eug\u00e8ne Bourdon patented his gauge in France in 1849, and it was widely adopted because of its superior simplicity, linearity, and accuracy; Bourdon is now part of the Baumer group and still manufacture Bourdon tube gauges in France. Edward Ashcroft purchased Bourdon's American patent rights in 1852 and became a major manufacturer of gauges. Also in 1849, Bernard Schaeffer in Magdeburg, Germany patented a successful diaphragm (see below) pressure gauge, which, together with the Bourdon gauge, revolutionized pressure measurement in industry. But in 1875 after Bourdon's patents expired, his company Schaeffer and Budenberg also manufactured Bourdon tube gauges.\nIn practice, a flattened thin-wall, closed-end tube is connected at the hollow end to a fixed pipe containing the fluid pressure to be measured. As the pressure increases, the closed end moves in an arc, and this motion is converted into the rotation of a (segment of a) gear by a connecting link that is usually adjustable. A small-diameter pinion gear is on the pointer shaft, so the motion is magnified further by the gear ratio. The positioning of the indicator card behind the pointer, the initial pointer shaft position, the linkage length and initial position, all provide means to calibrate the pointer to indicate the desired range of pressure for variations in the behavior of the Bourdon tube itself. Differential pressure can be measured by gauges containing two different Bourdon tubes, with connecting linkages (but is more usually measured via diaphragms or bellows and a balance system).\nBourdon tubes measures gauge pressure, relative to ambient atmospheric pressure, as opposed to absolute pressure; vacuum is sensed as a reverse motion. Some aneroid barometers use Bourdon tubes closed at both ends (but most use diaphragms or capsules, see below). When the measured pressure is rapidly pulsing, such as when the gauge is near a reciprocating pump, an orifice restriction in the connecting pipe is frequently used to avoid unnecessary wear on the gears and provide an average reading; when the whole gauge is subject to mechanical vibration, the case (including the pointer and dial) can be filled with an oil or glycerin. Typical high-quality modern gauges provide an accuracy of \u00b11% of span (Nominal diameter 100mm, Class 1 EN837-1), and a special high-accuracy gauge can be as accurate as 0.1% of full scale.\nForce-balanced fused quartz Bourdon tube sensors work on the same principle but uses the reflection of a beam of light from a mirror to sense the angular displacement and current is applied to electromagnets to balance the force of the tube and bring the angular displacement back to zero, the current that is applied to the coils is used as the measurement. Due to the extremely stable and repeatable mechanical and thermal properties of quartz and the force balancing which eliminates nearly all physical movement these sensors can be accurate to around 1\u00a0PPM of full scale. Due to the extremely fine fused quartz structures which must be made by hand these sensors are generally limited to scientific and calibration purposes.\nIn the following illustrations of a compound gauge (vacuum and gauge pressure), the case and window has been removed to show only the dial, pointer and process connection. This particular gauge is a combination vacuum and pressure gauge used for automotive diagnosis:\nMechanical details include stationary and moving parts.\nStationary parts:\nMoving parts:\nDiaphragm (membrane).\nA second type of aneroid gauge uses deflection of a flexible membrane that separates regions of different pressure. The amount of deflection is repeatable for known pressures so the pressure can be determined by using calibration. The deformation of a thin diaphragm is dependent on the difference in pressure between its two faces. The reference face can be open to atmosphere to measure gauge pressure, open to a second port to measure differential pressure, or can be sealed against a vacuum or other fixed reference pressure to measure absolute pressure. The deformation can be measured using mechanical, optical or capacitive techniques. Ceramic and metallic diaphragms are used.\nThe useful range is above 10\u22122 Torr (roughly 1 Pa).\nFor absolute measurements, welded pressure capsules with diaphragms on either side are often used.\nMembrane shapes include:\nBellows.\nIn gauges intended to sense small pressures or pressure differences, or require that an absolute pressure be measured, the gear train and needle may be driven by an enclosed and sealed bellows chamber, called an aneroid. (Early barometers used a column of liquid such as water or the liquid metal mercury suspended by a vacuum.) This bellows configuration is used in aneroid barometers (barometers with an indicating needle and dial card), altimeters, altitude recording barographs, and the altitude telemetry instruments used in weather balloon radiosondes. These devices use the sealed chamber as a reference pressure and are driven by the external pressure. Other sensitive aircraft instruments such as air speed indicators and rate of climb indicators (variometers) have connections both to the internal part of the aneroid chamber and to an external enclosing chamber.\nMagnetic coupling.\nThese gauges use the attraction of two magnets to translate differential pressure into motion of a dial pointer. As differential pressure increases, a magnet attached to either a piston or rubber diaphragm moves. A rotary magnet that is attached to a pointer then moves in unison. To create different pressure ranges, the spring rate can be increased or decreased.\nSpinning-rotor gauge.\nThe spinning-rotor gauge works by measuring how a rotating ball is slowed by the viscosity of the gas being measured. The ball is made of steel and is magnetically levitated inside a steel tube closed at one end and exposed to the gas to be measured at the other. The ball is brought up to speed (about 2500 or 3800\u00a0rad/s), and the deceleration rate is measured after switching off the drive, by electromagnetic transducers. The range of the instrument is 5\u22125 to 102\u00a0Pa (103\u00a0Pa with less accuracy). It is accurate and stable enough to be used as a secondary standard. During the last years this type of gauge became much more user friendly and easier to operate. In the past the instrument was famous for requiring some skill and knowledge to use correctly. For high accuracy measurements various corrections must be applied and the ball must be spun at a pressure well below the intended measurement pressure for five hours before using. It is most useful in calibration and research laboratories where high accuracy is required and qualified technicians are available. Insulation vacuum monitoring of cryogenic liquids is a well suited application for this system too. With the inexpensive and long term stable, weldable sensor, that can be separated from the more costly electronics, it is a perfect fit to all static vacuums.\nThe strain gauge is generally glued (foil strain gauge) or deposited (thin-film strain gauge) onto a membrane. Membrane deflection due to pressure causes a resistance change in the strain gauge which can be electronically measured.\nUses the piezoresistive effect of bonded or formed strain gauges to detect strain due to applied pressure.\nThe sensor is generally a temperature compensated, piezoresistive silicon pressure sensor chosen for its excellent performance and long-term stability. Integral temperature compensation is provided over a range of 0\u201350\u00a0\u00b0C using laser-trimmed resistors. An additional laser-trimmed resistor is included to normalize pressure sensitivity variations by programming the gain of an external differential amplifier. This provides good sensitivity and long-term stability. The two ports of the sensor, apply pressure to the same single transducer, please see pressure flow diagram below.\nElectronic pressure instruments.\nThis is an over-simplified diagram, but you can see the fundamental design of the internal ports in the sensor. The important item here to note is the \"diaphragm\" as this is the sensor itself. Is it slightly convex in shape (highly exaggerated in the drawing); this is important as it affects the accuracy of the sensor in use.\nThe shape of the sensor is important because it is calibrated to work in the direction of air flow as shown by the RED arrows. This is normal operation for the pressure sensor, providing a positive reading on the display of the digital pressure meter. Applying pressure in the reverse direction can induce errors in the results as the movement of the air pressure is trying to force the diaphragm to move in the opposite direction. The errors induced by this are small, but can be significant, and therefore it is always preferable to ensure that the more positive pressure is always applied to the positive (+ve) port and the lower pressure is applied to the negative (-ve) port, for normal 'gauge pressure' application. The same applies to measuring the difference between two vacuums, the larger vacuum should always be applied to the negative (-ve) port.\nThe measurement of pressure via the Wheatstone Bridge looks something like this...\nThe effective electrical model of the transducer, together with a basic signal conditioning circuit, is shown in the application schematic. The pressure sensor is a fully active Wheatstone bridge which has been temperature compensated and offset adjusted by means of thick film, laser trimmed resistors. The excitation to the bridge is applied via a constant current. The low-level bridge output is at +O and -O, and the amplified span is set by the gain programming resistor (r). The electrical design is microprocessor controlled, which allows for calibration, the additional functions for the user, such as Scale Selection, Data Hold, Zero and Filter functions, the Record function that stores/displays MAX/MIN. \nUses a diaphragm and pressure cavity to create a variable capacitor to detect strain due to applied pressure.\nMeasures the displacement of a diaphragm by means of changes in inductance (reluctance), LVDT, Hall effect, or by eddy current principle.\nUses the piezoelectric effect in certain materials such as quartz to measure the strain upon the sensing mechanism due to pressure.\nUses the physical change of an optical fiber to detect strain due to applied pressure.\nUses the motion of a wiper along a resistive mechanism to detect the strain caused by applied pressure.\nUses the changes in resonant frequency in a sensing mechanism to measure stress, or changes in gas density, caused by applied pressure.\nThermal conductivity.\nGenerally, as a real gas increases in density -which may indicate an increase in pressure- its ability to conduct heat increases. In this type of gauge, a wire filament is heated by running current through it. A thermocouple or resistance thermometer (RTD) can then be used to measure the temperature of the filament. This temperature is dependent on the rate at which the filament loses heat to the surrounding gas, and therefore on the thermal conductivity. A common variant is the Pirani gauge, which uses a single platinum filament as both the heated element and RTD. These gauges are accurate from 10\u22123\u00a0Torr to 10 Torr, but their calibration is sensitive to the chemical composition of the gases being measured.\nPirani (one wire).\nA Pirani gauge consists of a metal wire open to the pressure being measured. The wire is heated by a current flowing through it and cooled by the gas surrounding it. If the gas pressure is reduced, the cooling effect will decrease, hence the equilibrium temperature of the wire will increase. The resistance of the wire is a function of its temperature: by measuring the voltage across the wire and the current flowing through it, the resistance (and so the gas pressure) can be determined. This type of gauge was invented by Marcello Pirani.\nTwo-wire.\nIn two-wire gauges, one wire coil is used as a heater, and the other is used to measure temperature due to convection. Thermocouple gauges and thermistor gauges work in this manner using a thermocouple or thermistor, respectively, to measure the temperature of the heated wire.\nIonization gauge.\nIonization gauges are the most sensitive gauges for very low pressures (also referred to as hard or high vacuum). They sense pressure indirectly by measuring the electrical ions produced when the gas is bombarded with electrons. Fewer ions will be produced by lower density gases. The calibration of an ion gauge is unstable and dependent on the nature of the gases being measured, which is not always known. They can be calibrated against a McLeod gauge which is much more stable and independent of gas chemistry.\nThermionic emission generates electrons, which collide with gas atoms and generate positive ions. The ions are attracted to a suitably biased electrode known as the collector. The current in the collector is proportional to the rate of ionization, which is a function of the pressure in the system. Hence, measuring the collector current gives the gas pressure. There are several sub-types of ionization gauge.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Block indent/styles.css\"/&gt;Useful range: 10\u221210 - 10\u22123 torr (roughly 10\u22128 - 10\u22121 Pa)\nMost ion gauges come in two types: hot cathode and cold cathode. In the hot cathode version, an electrically heated filament produces an electron beam. The electrons travel through the gauge and ionize gas molecules around them. The resulting ions are collected at a negative electrode. The current depends on the number of ions, which depends on the pressure in the gauge. Hot cathode gauges are accurate from 10\u22123\u00a0Torr to 10\u221210\u00a0Torr. The principle behind cold cathode version is the same, except that electrons are produced in the discharge of a high voltage. Cold cathode gauges are accurate from 10\u22122\u00a0Torr to 10\u22129\u00a0Torr. Ionization gauge calibration is very sensitive to construction geometry, chemical composition of gases being measured, corrosion and surface deposits. Their calibration can be invalidated by activation at atmospheric pressure or low vacuum. The composition of gases at high vacuums will usually be unpredictable, so a mass spectrometer must be used in conjunction with the ionization gauge for accurate measurement.\nHot cathode.\nA hot-cathode ionization gauge is composed mainly of three electrodes acting together as a triode, wherein the cathode is the filament. The three electrodes are a collector or plate, a filament, and a grid. The collector current is measured in picoamperes by an electrometer. The filament voltage to ground is usually at a potential of 30 volts, while the grid voltage at 180\u2013210 volts DC, unless there is an optional electron bombardment feature, by heating the grid, which may have a high potential of approximately 565 volts.\nThe most common ion gauge is the hot-cathode Bayard\u2013Alpert gauge, with a small ion collector inside the grid. A glass envelope with an opening to the vacuum can surround the electrodes, but usually the nude gauge is inserted in the vacuum chamber directly, the pins being fed through a ceramic plate in the wall of the chamber. Hot-cathode gauges can be damaged or lose their calibration if they are exposed to atmospheric pressure or even low vacuum while hot. The measurements of a hot-cathode ionization gauge are always logarithmic.\nElectrons emitted from the filament move several times in back-and-forth movements around the grid before finally entering the grid. During these movements, some electrons collide with a gaseous molecule to form a pair of an ion and an electron (electron ionization). The number of these ions is proportional to the gaseous molecule density multiplied by the electron current emitted from the filament, and these ions pour into the collector to form an ion current. Since the gaseous molecule density is proportional to the pressure, the pressure is estimated by measuring the ion current.\nThe low-pressure sensitivity of hot-cathode gauges is limited by the photoelectric effect. Electrons hitting the grid produce x-rays that produce photoelectric noise in the ion collector. This limits the range of older hot-cathode gauges to 10\u22128\u00a0Torr and the Bayard\u2013Alpert to about 10\u221210\u00a0Torr. Additional wires at cathode potential in the line of sight between the ion collector and the grid prevent this effect. In the extraction type the ions are not attracted by a wire, but by an open cone. As the ions cannot decide which part of the cone to hit, they pass through the hole and form an ion beam. This ion beam can be passed on to a:\nCold cathode.\nThere are two subtypes of cold-cathode ionization gauges: the Penning gauge (invented by Frans Michel Penning), and the inverted magnetron, also called a Redhead gauge. The major difference between the two is the position of the anode with respect to the cathode. Neither has a filament, and each may require a DC potential of about 4 kV for operation. Inverted magnetrons can measure down to 1\u00d710\u221212 Torr.\nLikewise, cold-cathode gauges may be reluctant to start at very low pressures, in that the near-absence of a gas makes it difficult to establish an electrode current - in particular in Penning gauges, which use an axially symmetric magnetic field to create path lengths for electrons that are of the order of metres. In ambient air, suitable ion-pairs are ubiquitously formed by cosmic radiation; in a Penning gauge, design features are used to ease the set-up of a discharge path. For example, the electrode of a Penning gauge is usually finely tapered to facilitate the field emission of electrons.\nMaintenance cycles of cold cathode gauges are, in general, measured in years, depending on the gas type and pressure that they are operated in. Using a cold cathode gauge in gases with substantial organic components, such as pump oil fractions, can result in the growth of delicate carbon films and shards within the gauge that eventually either short-circuit the electrodes of the gauge or impede the generation of a discharge path.\nDynamic transients.\nWhen fluid flows are not in equilibrium, local pressures may be higher or lower than the average pressure in a medium. These disturbances propagate from their source as longitudinal pressure variations along the path of propagation. This is also called sound. Sound pressure is the instantaneous local pressure deviation from the average pressure caused by a sound wave. Sound pressure can be measured using a microphone in air and a hydrophone in water. The effective sound pressure is the root mean square of the instantaneous sound pressure over a given interval of time. Sound pressures are normally small and are often expressed in units of microbar.\nCalibration and standards.\nThe American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) has developed two separate and distinct standards on pressure measurement, B40.100 and PTC 19.2. B40.100 provides guidelines on Pressure Indicated Dial Type and Pressure Digital Indicating Gauges, Diaphragm Seals, Snubbers, and Pressure Limiter Valves. PTC 19.2 provides instructions and guidance for the accurate determination of pressure values in support of the ASME Performance Test Codes. The choice of method, instruments, required calculations, and corrections to be applied depends on the purpose of the measurement, the allowable uncertainty, and the characteristics of the equipment being tested.\nThe methods for pressure measurement and the protocols used for data transmission are also provided. Guidance is given for setting up the instrumentation and determining the uncertainty of the measurement. Information regarding the instrument type, design, applicable pressure range, accuracy, output, and relative cost is provided. Information is also provided on pressure-measuring devices that are used in field environments i.e., piston gauges, manometers, and low-absolute-pressure (vacuum) instruments.\nThese methods are designed to assist in the evaluation of measurement uncertainty based on current technology and engineering knowledge, taking into account published instrumentation specifications and measurement and application techniques. This Supplement provides guidance in the use of methods to establish the pressure-measurement uncertainty.\nApplications.\nThere are many applications for pressure sensors:\nThis is where the measurement of interest is pressure, expressed as a force per unit area. This is useful in weather instrumentation, aircraft, automobiles, and any other machinery that has pressure functionality implemented.\nThis is useful in aircraft, rockets, satellites, weather balloons, and many other applications. All these applications make use of the relationship between changes in pressure relative to the altitude. This relationship is governed by the following equation:\nformula_1\nThis equation is calibrated for an altimeter, up to 36,090\u00a0feet (11,000\u00a0m). Outside that range, an error will be introduced which can be calculated differently for each different pressure sensor. These error calculations will factor in the error introduced by the change in temperature as we go up.\nBarometric pressure sensors can have an altitude resolution of less than 1\u00a0meter, which is significantly better than GPS systems (about 20\u00a0meters altitude resolution). In navigation applications altimeters are used to distinguish between stacked road levels for car navigation and floor levels in buildings for pedestrian navigation.\nThis is the use of pressure sensors in conjunction with the venturi effect to measure flow. Differential pressure is measured between two segments of a venturi tube that have a different aperture. The pressure difference between the two segments is directly proportional to the flow rate through the venturi tube. A low pressure sensor is almost always required as the pressure difference is relatively small.\nA pressure sensor may also be used to calculate the level of a fluid. This technique is commonly employed to measure the depth of a submerged body (such as a diver or submarine), or level of contents in a tank (such as in a water tower). For most practical purposes, fluid level is directly proportional to pressure. In the case of fresh water where the contents are under atmospheric pressure, 1psi = 27.7 inH2O / 1Pa = 9.81 mmH2O. The basic equation for such a measurement is\nformula_2\nwhere \"P\" = pressure, \"\u03c1\" = density of the fluid, \"g\" = standard gravity, \"h\" = height of fluid column above pressure sensor\nA pressure sensor may be used to sense the decay of pressure due to a system leak. This is commonly done by either comparison to a known leak using differential pressure, or by means of utilizing the pressure sensor to measure pressure change over time.\nA piezometer is either a device used to measure liquid pressure in a system by measuring the height to which a column of the liquid rises against gravity, or a device which measures the pressure (more precisely, the piezometric head) of groundwater at a specific point. A piezometer is designed to measure static pressures, and thus differs from a pitot tube by not being pointed into the fluid flow. Observation wells give some information on the water level in a formation, but must be read manually. Electrical pressure transducers of several types can be read automatically, making data acquisition more convenient.\nThe first piezometers in geotechnical engineering were open wells or standpipes (sometimes called Casagrande piezometers) installed into an aquifer. A Casagrande piezometer will typically have a solid casing down to the depth of interest, and a slotted or screened casing within the zone where water pressure is being measured. The casing is sealed into the drillhole with clay, bentonite or concrete to prevent surface water from contaminating the groundwater supply. In an unconfined aquifer, the water level in the piezometer would not be exactly coincident with the water table, especially when the vertical component of flow velocity is significant. In a confined aquifer under artesian conditions, the water level in the piezometer indicates the pressure in the aquifer, but not necessarily the water table. Piezometer wells can be much smaller in diameter than production wells, and a 5\u00a0cm diameter standpipe is common.\nPiezometers in durable casings can be buried or pushed into the ground to measure the groundwater pressure at the point of installation. The pressure gauges (transducer) can be vibrating-wire, pneumatic, or strain-gauge in operation, converting pressure into an electrical signal. These piezometers are cabled to the surface where they can be read by data loggers or portable readout units, allowing faster or more frequent reading than is possible with open standpipe piezometers.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nApplications.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "19953", "revid": "525927", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19953", "title": "Medieval dance", "text": "Types of dance in medieval Europe\nSources for an understanding of dance in Europe in the Middle Ages are limited and fragmentary, being composed of some interesting depictions in paintings and illuminations, a few musical examples of what may be dances, and scattered allusions in literary texts. The first detailed descriptions of dancing only date from 1451 in Italy, which is after the start of the Renaissance in Western Europe.\nCarole.\nThe most documented form of secular dance during the Middle Ages is the carol also called the \"carole\" or \"carola\" and known from the 12th and 13th centuries in Western Europe in rural and court settings. It consisted of a group of dancers holding hands usually in a circle, with the dancers singing in a leader and refrain style while dancing. No surviving lyrics or music for the carol have been identified. In northern France, other terms for this type of dance included \"ronde\" and its diminutives \"rondet\", \"rondel\", and \"rondelet\" from which the more modern music term \"rondeau\" derives. In the German-speaking areas, this same type of choral dance was known as \"reigen\".\nMullally in his book on the carole makes the case that the dance, at least in France, was done in a closed circle with the dancers, usually men and women interspersed, holding hands. He adduces evidence that the general progression of the dance was to the left (clockwise) and that the steps probably were very simple consisting of a step to the left with the left foot followed by a step on the right foot closing to the left foot.\nFrance.\nChretien de Troyes.\nSome of the earliest mentions of the carol occur in the works of the French poet Chr\u00e9tien de Troyes in his series of Arthurian romances. In the wedding scene in Erec and Enide (about 1170)\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\u2014\u200a\nIn The Knight of the Cart (probably late 1170s) at a meadow where there are knights and ladies, various games are played while:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\u2014\u200a\nIn what is probably Chretien's last work, Perceval, the Story of the Grail, probably written 1181\u20131191, we find:\nMen and women danced rounds through every street and square\nand later at a court setting:\nThe queen ... had all her maidens join hands together to dance and begin the merry-making. In his honour they began their singing, dances, and rounds\nItaly.\nDante (1265\u20131321) has a few minor references to dance in his works but a more substantive description of the round dance with song from Bologna comes from Giovanni del Virgilio (floruit 1319\u20131327).\nLater in the 14th century Giovanni Boccaccio (1313\u20131375) shows us the \"carola\" in Florence in the \"Decameron\" (about 1350\u20131353) which has several passages describing men and women dancing to their own singing or accompanied by musicians. Boccaccio also uses two other terms for contemporary dances, \"ridda\" and \"ballonchio\", both of which refer to round dances with singing.\nApproximately contemporary with the \"Decameron\" are a series of frescos in Siena by Ambrogio Lorenzetti painted about 1338\u201340, one of which shows a group of women doing a \"bridge\" figure while accompanied by another woman playing the tambourine.\nEngland.\nIn a life of Saint Dunstan composed about 1000, the author tells how Dunstan, going into a church, found maidens dancing in a ring and singing a hymn. According to the \"Oxford English Dictionary\" (1933) the term \"carol\" was first used in England for this type of circle dance accompanied by singing in manuscripts dating to as early as 1300. The word was used as both a noun and a verb and the usage of carol for a dance form persisted well into the 16th century. One of the earliest references is in Robert of Brunne's early 14th century \"Handlyng Synne\" (Handling Sin) where it occurs as a verb.\nOther chain dances.\nCircle or line dances also existed in other parts of Europe outside England, France and Italy where the term carol was best known. These dances were of the same type with dancers hand-in-hand and a leader who sang the ballad.\nScandinavia.\nIn Denmark, old ballads mention a closed Ring dance which can open into a Chain dance. A fresco in \u00d8rslev church in Zealand from about 1400 shows nine people, men and women, dancing in a line. The leader and some others in the chain carry bouquets of flowers. Dances could be for men and women, or for men alone, or women alone. In the case of women's dances, however, there may have been a man who acted as the leader. Two dances specifically named in the Danish ballads which appear to be line dances of this type are \"The Beggar Dance\", and \"The Lucky Dance\" which may have been a dance for women. A modern version of these medieval chains is seen in the Faroese chain dance, the earliest account of which goes back only to the 17th century.\nIn Sweden too, medieval songs often mentioned dancing. A long chain was formed, with the leader singing the verses and setting the time while the other dancers joined in the chorus. These \"Long Dances\" have lasted into modern times in Sweden. A similar type of song dance may have existed in Norway in the Middle Ages as well, but no historical accounts have been found.\nCentral Europe.\nThe same dance in Germany was called \"Reigen\" and may have originated from devotional dances at early Christian festivals. Dancing around the church or a fire was frequently denounced by church authorities which only underscores how popular it was. There are records of church and civic officials in various German towns forbidding dancing and singing from the 8th to the 10th centuries. Once again, in singing processions, the leader provided the verse and the other dancers supplied the chorus. The minnesinger Neidhart von Reuental, who lived in the first half of the 13th century wrote several songs for dancing, some of which use the term \"reigen\".\nIn southern Tyrol, at Runkelstein Castle, a series of frescos was executed in the last years of the 14th century. One of the frescos depicts Elisabeth of Poland, Queen of Hungary leading a chain dance.\nCircle dances were also found in the area that is today the Czech Republic. Descriptions and illustrations of dancing can be found in church registers, chronicles and the 15th century writings of Bohuslav Hasi\u0161tejnsk\u00fd z Lobkovic. Dancing was primarily done around trees on the village green but special houses for dancing appear from the 14th century. In Poland as well the earliest village dances were in circles or lines accompanied by the singing or clapping of the participants.\nThe Balkans.\nThe present-day folk dances in the Balkans consist of dancers linked together in a hand or shoulder hold in an open or closed circle or a line. The basic round dance goes by many names in the various countries of the region: \"choros\", \"kolo\", \"oro\", \"horo\" or \"hora\". The modern couple dance so common in western and northern Europe has only made a few inroads into the Balkan dance repertory.\nChain dances of a similar type to these modern dance forms have been documented from the medieval Balkans. Tens of thousands of medieval tombstones called \"Ste\u0107ci\" are found in Bosnia and Hercegovina and neighboring areas in Montenegro, Serbia and Croatia. They date from the end of the 12th century to the 16th century. Many of the stones bear inscription and figures, several of which have been interpreted as dancers in a ring or line dance. These mostly date to the 14th and 15th centuries. Usually men and women are portrayed dancing together holding hands at shoulder level but occasionally the groups consist of only one sex.\nFurther south in Macedonia, near the town of Zletovo, Lesnovo monastery, originally built in the 11th century, was renovated in the middle of the 14th century and a series of murals were painted. One of these shows a group of young men linking arms in a round dance. They are accompanied by two musicians, one playing the kanun while the other beats on a long drum.\nThere is also some documentary evidence from the Dalmatian coast area of what is now Croatia. An anonymous chronicle from 1344 exhorts the people of the city of Zadar to sing and dance circle dances for a festival while in the 14th and 15th centuries, authorities in Dubrovnik forbid circle dances and secular songs on the cathedral grounds. Another early reference comes from the area of present-day Bulgaria in a manuscript of a 14th-century sermon which calls chain dances \"devilish and damned.\"\nAt a later period there are the accounts of two western European travelers to Constantinople, the capital of the Ottoman Empire. Salomon Schweigger (1551\u20131622) was a German preacher who traveled in the entourage of Jochim von Sinzendorf, Ambassador to Constantinople for Rudolf II in 1577. He describes the events at a Greek wedding:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nAnother traveler, the German pharmacist Reinhold Lubenau, was in Constantinople in November 1588 and reports on a Greek wedding in these terms:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nEstampie.\nIf the story is true that troubadour Raimbaut de Vaqueiras (about 1150\u20131207) wrote the famous Proven\u00e7al song \"Kalenda Maya\" to fit the tune of an estampie that he heard two jongleurs play, then the history of the estampie extends back to the 12th century. The only musical examples actually identified as \"estampie\" or \"istanpita\" occur in two 14th-century manuscripts. The same manuscripts also contain other pieces named \"danse real\" or other dance names. These are similar in musical structure to the estampies but consensus is divided as to whether these should be considered the same.\nIn addition to these instrumental music compositions, there are also mentions of the estampie in various literary sources from the 13th and 14th centuries. One of these as \"stampenie\" is found in Gottfried von Strassburg's \"Tristan\" from 1210 in a catalog of Tristan's accomplishments:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nLater, in a description of Isolde:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nA century and a half later in the poem \"La Prison amoreuse\" (1372\u201373) by French chronicler and poet Jean Froissart (c. 1337\u20131405), we find:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nOpinion is divided as to whether the Estampie was actually a dance or simply early instrumental music. Sachs believes the strong rhythm of the music, a derivation of the name from a term meaning \"to stamp\" and the quotation from the Froissart poem above definitely label the estampie as a dance. However, others stress the complex music in some examples as being uncharacteristic of dance melodies and interpret Froissart's poem to mean that the dancing begins with the carol. There is also debate on the derivation of the word \"estampie\". In any case, no description of dance steps or figures for the estampie are known.\nCouple dances.\nAccording to German dance historian Aenne Goldschmidt, the oldest notice of a couple dance comes from the southern German Latin romance Ruodlieb probably composed in the early to mid-11th century. The dance is done at a wedding feast and is described in the translation by Edwin Zeydel as follows:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nAnother literary mention comes from a later period in Germany with a description of couple dancing in Wolfram von Eschenbach's epic poem \"Parzival\", usually dated to the beginning of the 13th century. The scene occurs on manuscript page 639, the host is Gawain, the tables from the meal have been removed and musicians have been recruited:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nEschenbach also remarks that while many of the noblemen present were good fiddlers, they knew only the old style dances, not the many new dances from Thuringia.\nThe early 14th century Codex Manesse from Heidelberg has miniatures of many Minnesang poets of the period. The portrait of Heinrich von Stretelingen shows him engaged in a \"courtly pair dance\" while the miniature of Hiltbolt von Schwangau depicts him in a trio dance with two ladies, one in each hand, with a fiddler providing the music.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "19955", "revid": "7183365", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19955", "title": "Megatokyo", "text": "English-language webcomic\n is an English-language webcomic created by Fred Gallagher and Rodney Caston. \"Megatokyo\" debuted on August 14, 2000, and has been written and illustrated solely by Gallagher since June 17, 2002. Gallagher's style of writing and illustration is heavily influenced by Japanese manga. \"Megatokyo\" is freely available on its official website. The intended schedule for updates was for postings twice a week, but new comics are typically posted just once or twice a quarter on non-specific days. In 2011, updates began being delayed further due to the health issues of Sarah Gallagher (Seraphim), Gallagher's wife. \"Megatokyo\" was published in book-format by CMX, although the first three volumes were published by Dark Horse. For February 2005, sales of the comic's third printed volume were ranked third on BookScan's list of graphic novels sold in bookstores, then the best showing for an original English-language manga.\nSet in a fictional version of Tokyo, \"Megatokyo\" portrays the adventures of Piro, a young fan of anime and manga, and his friend Largo, an American video game enthusiast. The comic often parodies and comments on the archetypes and clich\u00e9s of anime, manga, dating sims, arcade and video games, occasionally making direct references to real-world works. \"Megatokyo\" originally emphasized humor, with continuity of the story a subsidiary concern. Over time, it focused more on developing a complex plot and the personalities of its characters. This transition was due primarily to Gallagher's increasing influence over the comic, which led to Caston choosing to leave the project.\nHistory.\n\"Megatokyo\" began publication as a joint project between Fred Gallagher and Rodney Caston, along with a few internet acquaintances. Gallagher and Caston later became business partners, as well. According to Gallagher, the comic's first two strips were drawn in reaction to Caston being \"convinced that he and I could do [a webcomic] ... [and] bothering me incessantly about it\", without any planning or pre-determined storyline. The comic's title was derived from an Internet domain owned by Caston, which had hosted a short-lived gaming news site maintained by Caston before the comic's creation. With Caston co-writing the comic's scripts and Gallagher supplying its artwork, the comic's popularity quickly increased, eventually reaching levels comparable to those of such popular webcomics as \"Penny Arcade\" and \"PvP\". According to Gallagher, \"Megatokyo\"'s popularity was not intended, as the project was originally an experiment to help him improve his writing and illustrating skills for his future project, \"Warmth\".\nIn May 2002, Caston sold his ownership of the title to Gallagher, who has managed the comic on his own since then. In October of the same year, after Gallagher was laid off from his day job as an architect, he took up producing the comic as a full time profession. Caston's departure from \"Megatokyo\" was not fully explained at the time. Initially, Gallagher and Caston only briefly mentioned the split, with Gallagher publicly announcing Caston's departure on June 17, 2002. On January 15, 2005, Gallagher explained his view of the reasoning behind the split in response to a comment made by Scott Kurtz of \"PvP\", in which he suggested that Gallagher had stolen ownership of \"Megatokyo\" from Caston. Calling Kurtz's claim \"mean spirited\", Gallagher responded:\nWhile things were good at first, over time we found that we were not working well together creatively. There is no fault in this, it happens. I've never blamed Rodney for this creative \"falling out\" nor do I blame myself. Not all creative relationships click, ours didn't in the long run.\nFour days later, Caston posted his view of the development on his website:\nAfter this he approached me and said either I would sell him my ownership of \"MegaTokyo\" or he would simply stop doing it entirely, and we'd divide up the company's assets and end it all.\nThis was right before the \"MT\" was to go into print form, and I really wanted to see it make it into print, rather [than] die on the vine.\nIn May 2011, it was announced that \"Endgames\" (a gameworld existing within \"Megatokyo\") was being revamped in a light novel format, with a story written by webfiction author Thomas Knapp, with four light novels planned. A short story \"Behind the Masque\" was also announced, and released on Amazon's Kindle Store on June 10, 2011.\nProduction.\n\"Megatokyo\" is usually hand-drawn in pencil by Fred Gallagher, without any digital or physical \"inking\". Inking was originally planned, but dropped as Gallagher decided it was unfeasible. \"Megatokyo\"'s first strips were created by roughly sketching on large sheets of paper, followed by tracing, scanning, digital clean-up of the traced comics with Adobe Photoshop, and final touches in Adobe Illustrator to achieve a finished product. Gallagher has stated that tracing was necessary because his sketches were not neat enough to use before tracing. Because of the tracing necessary, these comics regularly took six to eight hours to complete. As the comic progressed, Gallagher became able to draw \"cleaner\" comics without rough lines and tracing lines, and was able to abandon the tracing step. Gallagher believes \"that this eventually led to better looking and more expressive comics\".\n\"Megatokyo\"'s early strips were laid out in four square panels per strip, in a two-by-two square array \u2013 a formatting choice made as a compromise between the horizontal layout of American comic strips and the vertical layout of Japanese comic strips. The limitations of this format became apparent during the first year of \"Megatokyo\"'s publication, and in the spring of 2001, the comic switched to a manga-style, free-form panel layout. This format allowed for both large, detailed drawings and small, abstract progressions, as based on the needs of the script. Gallagher has commented that his drawing speed had increased since the comic's beginning, and with four panel comics taking much less time to produce, it \"made sense in some sort of twisted, masochistic way, that [he] could use that extra time to draw more for each comic\".\n\"Megatokyo\"'s earliest strips were drawn entirely on single sheets of paper. Following these, Gallagher began drawing the comic's panels separately and assembling them in Adobe Illustrator, allowing him to draw more detailed frames. This changed during \"Megatokyo\"'s eighth chapter, with Gallagher returning to drawing entire comics on single sheets of paper. Gallagher stated that this change allowed for more differentiated layouts, in addition to allowing him a better sense of momentum during comic creation.\nThe strip is currently drawn on inkjet paper in pencil, the text and speech being added later with Adobe Photoshop or Illustrator. In March 2009, he began Fredarting, a streaming live video feed of the comic being drawn.\nGallagher occasionally has guest artists participate in the production of the comic.\nRevenue.\n\"Megatokyo\" has had several sources of funding during its production. In its early years, it was largely funded by Gallagher and Caston's full time jobs, with the additional support of banner advertisements. A store connected to ThinkGeek was launched during October 2000 in order to sell \"Megatokyo\" merchandise, and, in turn, help fund the comic. On August 1, 2004, this store was replaced by \"Megagear\", an independent online store created by Fred Gallagher and his wife, Sarah, to be used by \"Megatokyo\", although it later offered \"Applegeeks\" and \"Angerdog\" merchandise as well.\nGallagher emphasized in 2004 that \"Megatokyo\" will remain on the Internet free of charge, and that releasing it in book form is simply another way for the comic to reach readers, as opposed to replacing its webcomic counterpart entirely. \nThemes and structure.\nMuch of \"Megatokyo\"'s early humor consists of jokes related to the video game subculture, as well as culture-clash issues. In these early strips, the comic progressed at a pace which Gallagher has called \"haphazard\", often interrupted by purely punchline-driven installments. As Gallagher gradually gained more control over \"Megatokyo\"'s production, the comic began to gain more similarities to the Japanese \"sh\u014djo\" (girls') manga that Gallagher enjoys. Following Gallagher's complete takeover of \"Megatokyo\", the comic's thematic relation to Japanese manga continued to grow.\nThe comic features characteristics borrowed from anime and manga archetypes, often parodying the medium's clich\u00e9s. Examples include Junpei, a ninja who becomes Largo's apprentice; Rent-a-zillas, giant monsters based on Godzilla; the Tokyo Police Cataclysm Division, which fights the monsters with giant robots and supervises the systematic destruction and reconstruction of predesignated areas of the city; fan service; a Japanese school girl, Yuki, who has also started being a magical girl in recent comics; and Ping, a robot girl. In addition, Dom and Ed, hitmen employed by Sega and Sony, respectively, are associated with a Japanese stereotype that all Americans are heavily armed.\nCharacters in \"Megatokyo\" usually speak Japanese, although some speak English, or English-based l33t. Typically, when a character is speaking Japanese, it is signified by enclosing English text between angle brackets (&lt;&gt;). Not every character speaks every language, so occasionally characters are unable to understand one another. In several scenes (such as http:// ), a character's speech is written entirely in r\u014dmaji Japanese to emphasize this.\n\"Megatokyo\" is divided into chapters. Chapter 0, which contains all of the comic's early phase, covers a time span in the comic of about six weeks. Each of the subsequent chapters chronicles the events of a single day. Chapter 0 was originally not given a title, although the book version retroactively dubbed it \"Relax, we understand j00.\" Between the chapters, and occasionally referenced in the main comic, are a number of \"omake\" (extras).\nMain characters.\nPiro.\nPiro, the protagonist, is an author surrogate of Fred Gallagher. Gallagher has stated that Piro is an idealized version of himself when he was in college. As a character, he is socially inept and frequently depressed. His design was originally conceived as a visual parody of the character Ruri Hoshino, from the \"Martian Successor Nadesico\" anime series. His name is derived from Gallagher's online nickname, which was in turn taken from Makoto Sawatari's cat in the Japanese visual novel \"Kanon\".\nIn the story, Piro has extreme difficulty understanding \"Megatokyo\"'s female characters, making him for the most part ignorant of the feelings that the character Nanasawa Kimiko has for him, though he has become much more aware of her attraction as the series progressed. Gallagher has commented that Piro is the focal point of emotional damage, while his friend, Largo, takes the physical damage in the comic.\nLargo.\nLargo is the comic's secondary protagonist, and the comic version of co-creator Rodney Caston. An impulsive alcoholic whose speech is rendered in L33t frequently, he serves as one of the primary sources of comic relief. A technologically gifted character, he is obsessed with altering devices, often with hazardous results. Gallagher designed Largo to be the major recipient of the comic's physical damage. Largo's name comes from Caston's online nickname, which refers to the villain from \"Bubblegum Crisis\". For various reasons (including fire and battle damage) he often ends up wearing very little clothing. Largo seems to have awkwardly blundered into a relatively successful relationship with Hayasaka Erika at the current time in the comic.\nHayasaka Erika.\n is a strong-willed, cynical, and sometimes violent character. At the time of the story, she is a former popular Japanese idol (singer) and voice actress who has been out of the spotlight for three years, though she still possesses a considerable fanbase. Erika's past relationship troubles, combined with exposure to swarms of fanboys, have caused her to adopt a negative outlook on life. Gallagher has implied that her personality was loosely based on the \"tsundere\" (tough girl) stereotype often seen in anime and manga.\nNanasawa Kimiko.\n is a Japanese girl who previously worked as a waitress at an Anna Miller's restaurant, and is Piro's romantic interest. At the current point in the story, she is a voice actress for the possibly-failing Lockart game \"Sight\", playing the main heroine, Kannazuki Kotone. Kimiko is a kind and soft-spoken character, though she is prone to mood-swings, and often causes herself embarrassment by saying things she does not mean. Gallagher has commented that Kimiko was the only female character not based entirely on anime stereotypes.\nTohya Miho.\n is an enigmatic and manipulative young goth girl. She is drawn to resemble a \"Gothic Lolita\", and is often described as \"darkly cute\", with Gallagher occasionally describing her as a \"perkigoth\". Miho often acts strangely compared to the comic's other characters, and regularly accomplishes abnormal feats, such as leaping inhuman distances or perching herself atop telephone poles. Despite these displays of ability, it is hinted at that Miho has problems with her health. Little is revealed in the comic about Miho's past or motivations, although Gallagher states that these will eventually be explained. Largo believes that she (Miho) is the queen of the undead, and is the cause of the zombie invasion of Tokyo. It has been hinted that she is a magical girl who may have some past connection with the zombies. She is apparently killed in a robotic beam attack by Ed, but nine days later is found in the hospital reading and eating with no obvious signs of physical damage. More possibilities exist that she is some type of game prototype or archetype.\nPlot.\n\"Megatokyo\"'s story begins when Piro and Largo fly to Tokyo after an incident at the Electronic Entertainment Expo (E3). Piro has the proper paperwork; Largo must beat the ninja Junpei at a video game to enter. After a spending spree, the pair are stranded without enough money to buy plane tickets home, forcing them to live with Tsubasa, a Japanese friend of Piro's. When Tsubasa suddenly departs for America to seek his \"first true love\", the protagonists are forced out of the apartment. Tsubasa leaves Ping, a robot girl PlayStation 2 accessory, in their care. This leads to old friends of Piro and Largo showing up later. The two are shadow operatives for video game companies, Ed (Sony) and Dom (SEGA).\nAt one point, Piro, confronted with girl troubles, visits the local bookstore to \"research\"\u2014look in the vast shelves of \"sh\u014djo\" manga for a solution to his problem. A spunky schoolgirl, Sonoda Yuki, and her friends, Asako and Mami, see him sitting amidst piles of read manga, and ask him what he is doing. Piro, flustered, runs away, accidentally leaving behind his bookbag and sketchbook.\nAfter their eviction, Piro begins work at \"Megagamers\", a store specializing in anime, manga, and video games. His employer allows him and Largo to live in the apartment above the store. Largo is mistaken for the new English teacher at a local school, where he takes on the alias \"Great Teacher Largo\" and instructs his students in L33t, video games, and about computers. Yuki's father, Inspector Sonada Masamichi of the \"Tokyo Police Cataclysm Division\" (TPCD) hires Largo after Largo manipulates Ping into stopping a rampaging monster, the drunken turtle Gameru.\nAs Largo is working at the local high school, Piro encounters Yuki again while working at Megagamers, when she returns his bookbag and sketchbook, scribbled all over with comments about his drawings. She then, to his consternation, asks if he would give her drawing lessons. Piro, flustered, agrees, and promptly forgets about them.\nEarlier in the story, Piro had seen Nanasawa Kimiko at an Anna Miller's restaurant, where she is a waitress, after Tsubasa brought him and Largo there. Later on, Piro encounters Kimiko outside a train station, where she is worrying aloud that she will miss an audition because she has forgotten her money and railcard. Piro hands her his own railcard and walks off before she can refuse his offer. This event causes Kimiko to develop an idealized vision of her benefactor, an image which is shattered the next time they meet. Despite this, she gradually develops feelings for Piro, though she is too shy to admit them. Later on in the story, Kimiko's outburst on a radio talk show causes her to suddenly rise to idol status. Angered by the hosts' derisive comments about fanboys, she comes to the defense of her audience, immediately and unintentionally securing their obsessive adoration. Later, her new horde of fanboys find out where she works and flock to the restaurant, obsessively trying to get pictures up her skirt. Piro works undercover as a busboy to get rid of all cameras. The scene eventually builds to a climax, in which Kimiko shouts at the fanboys and lifts her skirt in defiance, and they take photographs. Piro, provoked by her outburst into actively defending her, threatens the fanboy crowd, and collects all of their memory cards with the photos. On the way back from the restaurant, Kimiko is suffering from the aftermath of the scene and lashes out at Piro on the subway, which causes him to walk off.\nMeanwhile, Largo develops a relationship with Hayasaka Erika, Piro's coworker at Megagamers. She and Kimiko share a house. As with Piro and Kimiko, Largo and Erika meet by coincidence early in the story. Later, it is revealed that Erika is a former pop idol, who caused a big scene then disappeared from the public eye after her fianc\u00e9 left her. When she is rediscovered by her fans, Largo helps thwart a fanboy horde, but not well enough to escape being dismissed by the TPCD for it. He then offers to help Erika to deal with her \"vulnerabilities in the digital plane\". Erika insists on protecting herself, so Largo instructs her in computer-building. This leads into a little more relationship than Largo can handle, partly because he insists all computer building be done in the nude or as close to it as possible, to avoid static electrical discharge ruining components, and partly because his behavior, crude though it may appear, impresses Erika in many ways.\nThe enigmatic Tohya Miho frequently meddles in the lives of the protagonists. Miho knows Piro and Largo from the \"Endgames\" MMORPG previous to \"Megatokyo\"'s plot. She abused a hidden statistic in the game to gain control of nearly all of the game's player characters, but was ultimately defeated by Piro and Largo. In the comic, Miho becomes close friends with Ping, influencing Ping's relationship with Piro and pitting Ping against Largo in video game battles. Miho is also involved in Erika's backstory; Miho manipulated Erika's fans after Erika's disappearance. This effort ended badly, leaving Miho hospitalized, and the TPCD cleaning up the aftermath. Most of the exact details of what happened are left to the readers' imagination, as are her current motivations and ultimate goal. Miho and many of the events surrounding her involve a club in Harajuku, the Cave of Evil (CoE).\nAfter getting yelled at for retaining her waitress job, Kimiko quits her voice acting job and goes home to find Erika assembling a new computer in her undergarments. Not long after Erika tells Kimiko to strip, Piro comes by, who she tells to get undressed as well. While Erika and Piro talk about her, Kimiko, who hid when Piro showed up, runs out of the apartment. Kimiko runs into Ping, who wanted to talk to Piro about why, after an explosion at school, she had started to cry uncontrollably. They encounter Largo at the store, who explains what went wrong, although no one knows what he means until Piro comes in and translates. Ping is relieved to know that she will not shut down and Kimiko hugs Piro and apologizes for her actions. Largo leaves for Erika's apartment after she calls looking for help. That night, while Piro and Kimiko fall asleep watching TV, Erika, who finished the computer with Largo's help, tries to seduce Largo, but it freaks him out and he runs out for home. The next morning, after Kimiko departs, Piro finds out she quit her voice acting job and tries to find her.\nKimiko and Miho are in the same diner, to which Ed has sent an attack robot (Kill-Bot) against Miho, since she has disrupted his attempts to destroy Ping. Miho is in the diner trying to contact Piro, Kimiko is talking with Erika. Dom is also there to talk with Kimiko. After rescuing both herself and Kimiko from the Kill-Bot and chaos at the diner, the two talk about things. Miho talks to Piro on her phone, argues with him, and then Piro and Kimiko have a conversation about that as the two females are leaving the area. Dom follows and tries to coerce Kimiko into joining SEGA for protection from fans, but she refuses. Drained, she has Miho finish talking to Piro on the phone. Piro then encounters a group who found Kimiko's cell phone and other belongings after she and Miho escaped the diner. The group wants to help Piro get together with Kimiko, partially due to feeling bad for trying to snap a picture up Kimiko's skirt. Piro and the group set out for a press conference Kimiko is going to for the voice acting project, \"Sight\". Besides all of the other fans going to the event, a planned zombie outbreak occurs in the area. Miho, who helped Kimiko get ready for the event and accompanied her to it, later calls the zombies off for unexplained reasons through an unexplained mechanism.\nLargo and Yuki, who has since been revealed along the way to be a magical girl like her mother Meimi (likewise revealed), steal a Rent-a-Zilla to fight the zombie outbreak. Largo leaves Yuki to help Piro get to Kimiko. Unfortunately, the Rent-a-Zilla gets bitten by zombies and turns into one itself, resulting in the TPCD capturing it. Yuki protects it from the TPCD, teleports it out of the area, and adopts it as a pet in a miniaturized form, all much to her father's chagrin.\nAfter the event, Erika, Largo, Kimiko and Piro are reunited, and they talk a bit with Miho, who has shown up again after storming out following an argument with Kenji earlier. Miho declines an offer to eat with the group and wanders off thinking about games and Largo and Piro. She is shown walking amongst the zombies and then in Ed's gun-sights, and in the center of an attack by a number of Ed's Kill-Bots.\nDuring the next nine days, Piro and Kimiko have made up and Kimiko returned to both of her jobs, with them seeing little of each other. Largo and Erika are shown to likewise be involved but more often, including going to dinner with the Sonoda family, as the inspector's brother was Erika's fianc\u00e9. Kimiko is attempting to get Piro working as an artist on \"Sight\", which unbeknownst to them is now being funded by Dom. Ping is concerned about the whereabouts of Miho, who has not been seen during the time, but Piro is still upset about all that has happened and somewhat evasively refuses direct assistance. Ping and Junko, another one of Largo's students, who used to be a friend of Miho, work towards finding Miho. Yuki and Kobayashi Yutaka then also become involved with the attempt because of this. That night, Piro and Kimiko discuss Miho and \"Endgames\", which Yuki overhears, they unaware she is there. This leads Yuki to appropriate Piro's powerless laptop and leave, believing him to still be in love with Miho and that the device might hold clues to finding her. Kimiko and Piro work on his portfolio for \"Sight\" and then they say goodnight and leave. He returns to his apartment, but Kimiko goes to the CoE club using a pass Miho gave her long ago in the beginning. Once at the club, Dom mockingly advises her, Yuki unknowingly whisps past her, and she unexpectedly meets up with an old friend Komugiko. During all this, Piro has left his apartment after looking at his sketchbook and a drawing of Miho. His current location is unknown.\nAside from Kimiko, concurrent overlapping events have led to almost every main character converging upon the club for various reasons involving Miho, or in support of others involved. Ed, attempting to destroy Ping, fights with Largo, as the staff of the club have maneuvered Ed and Ping into the protective radius of ex-Idol Erika. Yuki and Yutaka get Piro's laptop powered on, she reads the old chat logs between Piro and Miho, and follows instructions from her to him. Going to a \"hidden-in-plain-sight\" hospital room, she finds Miho alive and well, although seemingly in a weakened state. During a heated argument and Miho's goading, Yuki then forcibly moves Miho to the club. Shortly after the arrival of the two in the center of everyone, the bulk of the denizens go into trance-like states while others are fighting or confused about what to do next. Miho appears to be collapsing. Upon instructions from Erika, Largo finds then uses his Largo-Phone and the club's sound system to knock out power in the immediate area of the club. During this event, Piro has gone to visit Miho at the \"hospital\" room, where he discovers that she is missing. Following the blackout, Largo, Erika, and Miho board a train, where Miho decides to return home. However, a large crowd has blocked her path home, apparently waiting for someone's return.\nThe next morning, Piro has been brought to jail, where he has been interrogated by police about Miho's disappearance. He is able to leave jail by paying a suspiciously set low bail of about $100 US, which is obtained through a 10,000 yen bill that has been shaped into an origami 'zilla and left in the cell. Piro walks back home, where he finds Miho sleeping on a beanbag in the apartment. Piro and Miho then work out some of the confusion between them, which reveals several background events. She explains the Analogue Support Facility as a sort of safehouse, where she was able to come and go when she wanted. Since Ping in her extreme attempt to find Miho had posted tons of pictures, videos, and information on the internet, people are now using that to \"build a 'real' me\", as Miho explains it. During the process, at one point Kimiko calls from the studio, updating Piro on his artwork and telling him some of how last night she and others found Miho and how crazy it was. Largo and Erika, who are riding on the roof of a train in the Miyagi prefecture also call during the conversation. After a short conversation with both Largo and Erika on the phone, and a bit more conversation with Miho, Piro instructs her to stay in the apartment until they can figure out what to do. Junko and Ping are shown leaving for school, with Junko seeming taking Ed's shotguns from last night with her.\nAfter receiving a phone call from Yutaka, whom Masamichi initially disapproves of, Yuki, who has not changed clothing from the events of the previous chapter, leaves her house, grabs him, and takes him to a rooftop, where they try to explain things after Yutaka was being questioned by Asako and Mami. She goes over everything, even why she referred to herself as a \"monster\", which Yuki's friends previously overheard and misunderstood. Realizing that Miho is the cause of this mess, Yutaka indirectly vows revenge, but Yuki stops him. Yutaka goes anyway and meets his brother in front of Megagamers, who has tracked Miho to the store since the previous night. Yutaka's brother is a member of a group of Nanasawa fans who plan to intervene and remind Piro who his true love is to get rid of Miho. However, Dom's van is blocking the store's entrance. Though Yuki protests against intervention to the group, Dom, who is unknown to them, performs his own method of intervention anyway and forces Piro to choose between Nanasawa and Miho. It is currently unknown if Dom knows who Miho is, but Miho, in a disguise, overhears the conversation and forces Piro to briefly wear a hat. At the same time, Yuki, deciding that she can wait no longer, steals Dom's van and guns, and rushes into the store with Yutaka in tow. Seeing this, Miho grabs Piro and rushes upstairs, discarding the hat in the process. Yuki subsequently collides with the hat and a presumed explosion occurs, stalling Yuki and Yutaka. Miho and Piro don cosplay outfits as a disguise, escape, and make their way to the local bath house. Just before Yuki grabs Yutaka again, Dom, now trapped under a pile of rubble, expresses his condolences to Yutaka, to which he does not understand. The pair quickly follow Miho and Piro and await for them to leave the bath house.\nBooks.\n\"Megatokyo\" was first published in print by Studio Ironcat, a partnership announced in September 2002. Following this, the first book, a compilation of \"Megatokyo\" strips under the title \"Megatokyo Volume One: Chapter Zero\", was released by Studio Ironcat in January 2003. According to Gallagher, Studio Ironcat was unable to meet demand for the book, due to problems the company was facing at the time. On July 7, 2003, Gallagher announced that Ironcat would not continue to publish \"Megatokyo\" in book form. This was followed by an announcement on August 27, 2003, that Dark Horse Comics would publish \"Megatokyo Volume 2\" and future collected volumes, including a revised edition of \"Megatokyo Volume 1\". The comic once more changed publishers in February 2006, moving from Dark Horse Comics to the CMX Manga imprint of DC Comics. The comic then transferred to CMX's parent Wildstorm, with its last volume published in July 2010.\nCMX, along with Wildstorm closed down in 2010. Former publisher Dark Horse regained the rights to the series and planned to release it in omnibus format in January 2013, but did not.\nAs of July 2010[ [update]], six volumes are available for purchase: volumes 1 through 3 from Dark Horse, volumes 4 and 5 by CMX/DC, and volume 6 by Wildstorm. The books have also been translated into German, Italian, French, and Polish. In July 2004, \"Megatokyo\" was the tenth best-selling manga property in the United States, and during the week ending February 20, 2005, volume 3 ranked third in the Nielsen BookScan figures, which was not only its highest ranking to date (as of August 2006[ [update]]), but also made it the highest monthly rank for an original English-language manga title.\nIn July 2007, Kodansha announced that in 2008 it intends to publish \"Megatokyo\" in a Japanese-language edition, (in a silver slipcased box as part of Kodansha Box editions, a new manga line started in November 2006). Depending on reader response, Kodansha hoped to subsequently publish the entire \"Megatokyo\" book series. The first volume was released in Japan on May 7, 2009.\n!width=4%|No.\n!width=48%|Title\n!width=24%|Release date\n!width=24%| ISBN\n&lt;/table&gt;\nReception.\nThe artwork and characterizations of \"Megatokyo\" have received praise from such publications as \"The New York Times\" and Comics Bulletin. Many critics praise \"Megatokyo\"'s character designs and pencil work, rendered entirely in grayscale; conversely, it has been criticized for perceived uniformity and simplicity in the designs of its peripheral characters, which have been regarded as confusing and difficult to tell apart due to their similar appearances.\nEric Burns, on his blog \"Websnark\", said that the comic suffered from \"incredibly slow pacing\" (from 2000\u20132009, only about two months of in-universe time elapsed), a lack of resolution for plot threads, and an erratic update schedule. He also complained that updates should have become more frequent and consistent after Gallagher took on \"Megatokyo\" as a full-time occupation, which did not happen.\nIGN called \"Megatokyo\"'s fans \"some of the most patient and forgiving in the webcomic world.\" During an interview, Gallagher stated that \"Megatokyo\" fans \"always [tell him] they are patient and find that the final comics are always worth the wait,\" but he feels as though he \"[has] a commitment to [his] readers and to [himself] to deliver the best comics [he] can, and to do it on schedule,\" finally saying that nothing would make him happier than \"[getting] a better handle on the time it takes to create each page.\" Upon missing deadlines, Gallagher often makes self-disparaging comments. Poking fun at this, Jerry \"Tycho\" Holkins of \"Penny Arcade\" has claimed to have \"gotten on famously\" with Gallagher, ever since he \"figured out that [Gallagher] legitimately detests himself and is not hoisting some kind of \"glamour\".\"\nWhile \"Megatokyo\" was originally presented as a slapstick comedy, it began focusing more on the romantic relationships between its characters after Caston's departure from the project. As a result, some fans, preferring the comic's gag-a-day format, have claimed its quality was superior when Caston was writing it. Additionally, it has been said that, without Caston's input, Largo's antics appear contrived. Comics Bulletin regards \"Megatokyo\"'s characters as convincingly portrayed, commenting that \"the reader truly feels connected to the characters, their romantic hijinks, and their wacky misadventures with the personal touches supplied by the author.\" Likewise, Anime News Network has praised the personal tone in which the comic is written, stating that much of its appeal is a result of the \"friendly and casual feeling of a fan-made production.\"\nGallagher states early in \"Megatokyo Volume 1\" that he and Caston \"didn't want the humor ... to rely too heavily on what might be considered 'obscure knowledge.'\" An article in \"The New York Times\" insists that such scenarios were unavoidable, commenting that the comic \"sits at the intersection of several streams of obscure knowledge,\" including \"gaming and hacking; manga ... the boom in Web comics over the past few years; and comics themselves.\" The article also held that \"Gallagher doesn't mean to be exclusive ... he graciously offers translation of the strip's later occasional lapses into l33t ... [and] explains why the characters are occasionally dressed in knickers or as rabbits.\" The newspaper went on to argue that \"The pleasure of a story like \"Megatokyo\" comes not in its novelistic coherence, but in its loose ranginess.\"\n\"Megatokyo\" was nominated in at least one category of the Web Cartoonists' Choice Awards every year from 2001 through 2007. It won Best Comic in 2002, as well as Best Writing, Best Serial Comic, and Best Dramatic Comic. The largest number of nominations it has received in one year is 14 in 2003, when it won Outstanding Environment Design. The series tied with Svetlana Chmakova's \"Dramacon\" for the 2007 Best Continuing OEL Manga.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "19956", "revid": "11096", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19956", "title": "Medieval music", "text": "Western music created during the Middle Ages\nMedieval music encompasses the sacred and secular music of Western Europe during the Middle Ages, from approximately the 6th to 15th centuries. It is the first and longest major era of Western classical music and is followed by the Renaissance music; the two eras comprise what musicologists generally term as early music, preceding the common practice period. Following the traditional division of the Middle Ages, medieval music can be divided into Early (500\u20131000), High (1000\u20131300), and Late (1300\u20131400) medieval music.\nMedieval music includes liturgical music used for the church, other sacred music, and secular or non-religious music. Much medieval music is purely vocal music, such as Gregorian chant. Other music used only instruments or both voices and instruments (typically with the instruments accompanying the voices). \nThe medieval period saw the creation and adaptation of systems of music notation which enabled creators to document and transmit musical ideas more easily, although notation coexisted with and complemented oral tradition.\nOverview.\nGenres.\nMedieval music was created for a number of different uses and contexts, resulting in different music genres. Liturgical as well as more general sacred contexts were important, but secular types emerged as well, including love songs and dances. During the earlier medieval period, liturgical music was monophonic chant; Gregorian chant became the dominant style. Polyphonic genres, in which multiple independent melodic lines are performed simultaneously, began to develop during the high medieval era, becoming prevalent by the later 13th and early 14th century. The development of polyphonic forms is often associated with the Ars antiqua style associated with Notre-Dame de Paris, but improvised polyphony around chant lines predated this.\nOrganum, for example, elaborated on a chant melody by creating one or more accompanying lines. The accompanying line could be as simple as a second line sung in parallel intervals to the original chant (often a perfect fifth or perfect fourth away from the main melody). The principles of this kind of organum date back at least to an anonymous 9th century tract, the \"Musica enchiriadis\", which describes the tradition of duplicating a preexisting plainchant in parallel motion at the interval of an octave, a fifth or a fourth. Some of the earliest written examples are in a style known as Aquitanian polyphony, but the largest body of surviving organum comes from the Notre-Dame school. This loose collection of repertory is often called the \"Magnus Liber Organi\" (\"Great Book of Organum\").\nRelated polyphonic genres included the motet and clausula genres, both also often built on an original segment of plainchant or as an elaboration on an organum passage. While most early motets were sacred and may have been liturgical (designed for use in a church service), by the end of the thirteenth century the genre had expanded to include secular topics, such as political satire and courtly love, and French as well as Latin texts. They also included from one to three upper voices, each with its own text. \nIn Italy, the secular genre of the Madrigal became popular. Similar to the polyphonic character of the motet, madrigals featured greater fluidity and motion in the leading melody. The madrigal form also gave rise to polyphonic canons (songs in which multiple singers sing the same melody, but starting at different times), especially in Italy where they were called \"caccie.\" These were three-part secular pieces, which featured the two higher voices in canon, with an underlying instrumental long-note accompaniment.\nIn the late middle ages, some purely instrumental music also began to be notated, though this remained rare. Dance music makes up most of the surviving instrumental music, and includes types such as the estampie, ductia, and nota.\nInstruments.\nMany instruments used to perform medieval music still exist in the 21st century, but in different and typically more technologically developed forms. The flute was made of wood in the medieval era rather than silver or other metal, and could be made as a side-blown or end-blown instrument. While modern orchestral flutes are usually made of metal and have complex key mechanisms and airtight pads, medieval flutes had holes that the performer had to cover with the fingers (as with the recorder). The recorder was made of wood during the medieval era, and despite the fact that in the 21st century, it may be made of synthetic materials such as plastic, it has more or less retained its past form. The gemshorn is similar to the recorder as it has finger holes on its front, though it is actually a member of the ocarina family. One of the flute's predecessors, the pan flute, was popular in medieval times, and is possibly of Hellenic origin. This instrument's pipes were made of wood, and were graduated in length to produce different pitches.\nMedieval music used many plucked string instruments like the lute, a fretted instrument with a pear-shaped hollow body which is the predecessor to the modern guitar. Other plucked stringed instruments included the mandore, gittern, citole and psaltery. \nThe bowed lyra of the Byzantine Empire was the first recorded European bowed string instrument. Like the modern violin, a performer produced sound by moving a bow with tensioned hair over tensioned strings. The Persian geographer Ibn Khurradadhbih of the 9th century (d.\u2009911) cited the Byzantine lyra, in his lexicographical discussion of instruments as a bowed instrument equivalent to the Arab rab\u0101b and typical instrument of the Byzantines along with the \"urghun\" (organ), \"shilyani\" (probably a type of harp or lyre) and the \"salandj\" (probably a bagpipe). The hurdy-gurdy was (and still is) a mechanical violin using a rosined wooden wheel attached to a crank to \"bow\" its strings. Instruments without sound boxes like the jew's harp were also popular. Early versions of the pipe organ, fiddle (or vielle), and a precursor to the modern trombone (called the sackbut) were used.\nNotation.\nDuring the medieval period the foundation was laid for the notational and theoretical practices that would shape Western music into the norms that developed during the common practice era. The most obvious of these is the development of a comprehensive music notational system; however the theoretical advances, particularly in regard to rhythm and polyphony, are equally important to the development of Western music.\nThe earliest medieval music did not have any kind of notational system. The tunes were primarily monophonic (a single melody without accompaniment) and transmitted by oral tradition. As Rome tried to centralize the various liturgies and establish the Roman rite as the primary church tradition the need to transmit these chant melodies across vast distances effectively was equally glaring. So long as music could only be taught to people \"by ear,\" it limited the ability of the church to get different regions to sing the same melodies, since each new person would have to spend time with a person who already knew a song and learn it \"by ear.\" The first step to fix this problem came with the introduction of various signs written above the chant texts to indicate direction of pitch movement, called \"neumes\".\nThe origin of \"neumes\" is unclear and subject to some debate; however, most scholars agree that their closest ancestors are the classic Greek and Roman grammatical signs that indicated important points of declamation by recording the rise and fall of the voice. The two basic signs of the classical grammarians were the \"acutus\", /, indicating a raising of the voice, and the \"gravis\", \\, indicating a lowering of the voice. A singer reading a chant text with neume markings would be able to get a general sense of whether the melody line went up in pitch, stayed the same, or went down in pitch. Since trained singers knew the chant repertoire well, written neume markings above the text served as a reminder of the melody but did not specify the actual intervals. However, a singer reading a chant text with neume markings would not be able to sight read a song which he or she had never heard sung before; these pieces would not be possible to interpret accurately today without later versions in more precise notation systems.\nThese neumes eventually evolved into the basic symbols for \"neumatic\" notation, the \"virga\" (or \"rod\") which indicates a higher note and still looked like the \"acutus\" from which it came; and the \"punctum\" (or \"dot\") which indicates a lower note and, as the name suggests, reduced the \"gravis\" symbol to a point. Thus the \"acutus\" and the \"gravis\" could be combined to represent graphical vocal inflections on the syllable. This kind of notation seems to have developed no earlier than the eighth century, but by the ninth it was firmly established as the primary method of musical notation. The basic notation of the \"virga\" and the \"punctum\" remained the symbols for individual notes, but other \"neumes\" soon developed which showed several notes joined. These new \"neumes\"\u2014called ligatures\u2014are essentially combinations of the two original signs.\nThe first music notation was the use of dots over the lyrics to a chant, with some dots being higher or lower, giving the reader a general sense of the direction of the melody. However, this form of notation only served as a memory aid for a singer who already knew the melody. This basic \"neumatic\" notation could only specify the number of notes and whether they moved up or down. There was no way to indicate exact pitch, any rhythm, or even the starting note. These limitations are further indication that the \"neumes\" were developed as tools to support the practice of oral tradition, rather than to supplant it. However, even though it started as a mere memory aid, the worth of having more specific notation soon became evident.\nThe next development in musical notation was \"heighted \"neumes\"\", in which \"neumes\" were carefully placed at different heights in relation to each other. This allowed the \"neumes\" to give a rough indication of the size of a given interval as well as the direction. This quickly led to one or two lines, each representing a particular note, being placed on the music with all of the \"neumes\" relating to the earlier ones. At first, these lines had no particular meaning and instead had a letter placed at the beginning indicating which note was represented. However, the lines indicating middle C and the F a fifth below slowly became most common. Having been at first merely scratched on the parchment, the lines now were drawn in two different colored inks: usually red for F, and yellow or green for C. This was the beginning of the musical staff. The completion of the four-line staff is usually credited to Guido d'Arezzo (c.\u20091000\u20131050), one of the most important musical theorists of the Middle Ages. While older sources attribute the development of the staff to Guido, some modern scholars suggest that he acted more as a codifier of a system that was already being developed. Either way, this new notation allowed a singer to learn pieces completely unknown to him in a much shorter amount of time. However, even though chant notation had progressed in many ways, one fundamental problem remained: rhythm. The \"neumatic\" notational system, even in its fully developed state, did not clearly define any kind of rhythm for the singing of notes.\nMusic theory.\nThe music theory of the medieval period saw several advances over previous practice both in regard to tonal material, texture, and rhythm.\nRhythm.\nConcerning rhythm, this period had several dramatic changes in both its conception and notation. During the early medieval period there was no method to notate rhythm, and thus the rhythmical practice of this early music is subject to debate among scholars. The first kind of written rhythmic system developed during the 13th century and was based on a series of modes. This rhythmic plan was codified by the music theorist Johannes de Garlandia, author of the \"De Mensurabili Musica\" (c.\u20091250), the treatise which defined and most completely elucidated these rhythmic modes. In his treatise Johannes de Garlandia describes six \"species\" of mode, or six different ways in which longs and breves can be arranged. Each mode establishes a rhythmic pattern in beats (or \"tempora\") within a common unit of three \"tempora\" (a \"perfectio\") that is repeated again and again. Furthermore, notation without text is based on chains of \"ligature\"s (the characteristic notations by which groups of notes are bound to one another).\nThe rhythmic mode can generally be determined by the patterns of ligatures used. Once a rhythmic mode had been assigned to a melodic line, there was generally little deviation from that mode, although rhythmic adjustments could be indicated by changes in the expected pattern of ligatures, even to the extent of changing to another rhythmic mode. The next step forward concerning rhythm came from the German theorist Franco of Cologne. In his treatise \"Ars cantus mensurabilis\" (\"The Art of Mensurable Music\"), written around 1280, he describes a system of notation in which differently shaped notes have entirely different rhythmic values. This is a striking change from the earlier system of de Garlandia. Whereas before the length of the individual note could only be gathered from the mode itself, this new inverted relationship made the mode dependent upon\u2014and determined by\u2014the individual notes or \"figurae\" that have incontrovertible durational values, an innovation which had a massive impact on the subsequent history of European music. Most of the surviving notated music of the 13th century uses the rhythmic modes as defined by Garlandia. The step in the evolution of rhythm came after the turn of the 13th century with the development of the \"Ars Nova\" style.\nThe theorist who is most well recognized in regard to this new style is Philippe de Vitry, famous for writing the \"Ars Nova\" (\"New Art\") treatise around 1320. This treatise on music gave its name to the style of this entire era. In some ways the modern system of rhythmic notation began with Vitry, who completely broke free from the older idea of the rhythmic modes. The notational predecessors of modern time meters also originate in the \"Ars Nova\". This new style was clearly built upon the work of Franco of Cologne. In Franco's system, the relationship between a breve and a semibreves (that is, half breves) was equivalent to that between a breve and a long: and, since for him \"modus\" was always perfect (grouped in threes), the \"tempus\" or beat was also inherently perfect and therefore contained three semibreves. Sometimes the context of the mode would require a group of only two semibreves, however, these two semibreves would always be one of normal length and one of double length, thereby taking the same space of time, and thus preserving the perfect subdivision of the \"tempus\". This ternary division held for all note values. In contrast, the \"Ars Nova\" period introduced two important changes: the first was an even smaller subdivision of notes (semibreves, could now be divided into \"minim\"), and the second was the development of \"mensuration.\"\nMensurations could be combined in various manners to produce metrical groupings. These groupings of mensurations are the precursors of simple and compound meter. By the time of \"Ars Nova\", the perfect division of the \"tempus\" was not the only option as duple divisions became more accepted. For Vitry the breve could be divided, for an entire composition, or section of one, into groups of two or three smaller semibreves. This way, the \"tempus\" (the term that came to denote the division of the breve) could be either \"perfect\" (\"tempus perfectum\"), with ternary subdivision, or \"imperfect\" (\"tempus imperfectum\"), with binary subdivision. In a similar fashion, the semibreve's division (termed \"prolation\") could be divided into three \"minima\" (\"prolatio perfectus\" or major prolation) or two \"minima\" (\"prolatio imperfectus\" or minor prolation) and, at the higher level, the longs division (called \"modus\") could be three or two breves (\"modus perfectus\" or perfect mode, or \"modus imperfectus\" or imperfect mode respectively). Vitry took this a step further by indicating the proper division of a given piece at the beginning through the use of a \"mensuration sign\", equivalent to our modern \"time signature\".\n\"Tempus perfectum\" was indicated by a circle, while \"tempus imperfectum\" was denoted by a half-circle (the current symbol , used as an alternative for the time signature, is actually a holdover of this symbol, not a letter \"C\" as an abbreviation for \"common time\", as popularly believed). While many of these innovations are ascribed to Vitry, and somewhat present in the \"Ars Nova\" treatise, it was a contemporary\u2014and personal acquaintance\u2014of de Vitry, named Johannes de Muris (or Jehan des Mars) who offered the most comprehensive and systematic treatment of the new mensural innovations of the \"Ars Nova\" (for a brief explanation of the mensural notation in general, see the article Renaissance music). Many scholars, citing a lack of positive attributory evidence, now consider \"Vitry's\" treatise to be anonymous, but this does not diminish its importance for the history of rhythmic notation. However, this makes the first definitely identifiable scholar to accept and explain the mensural system to be de Muris, who can be said to have done for it what Garlandia did for the rhythmic modes.\nFor the duration of the medieval period, most music would be composed primarily in perfect tempus, with special effects created by sections of imperfect tempus; there is a great current controversy among musicologists as to whether such sections were performed with a breve of equal length or whether it changed, and if so, at what proportion. This \"Ars Nova\" style remained the primary rhythmical system until the highly syncopated works of the \"Ars subtilior\" at the end of the 14th century, characterized by extremes of notational and rhythmic complexity. This sub-genera pushed the rhythmic freedom provided by \"Ars Nova\" to its limits, with some compositions having different voices written in different mensurations simultaneously. The rhythmic complexity that was realized in this music is comparable to that in the 20th century.\nPolyphony.\nOf equal importance to the overall history of western music theory were the textural changes that came with the advent of polyphony. This practice shaped western music into the harmonically dominated music that we know today. The first accounts of this textural development were found in two anonymous yet widely circulated treatises on music, the \"Musica\" and the \"Scolica enchiriadis\". These texts are dated to sometime within the last half of the ninth century. The treatises describe a technique that seemed already to be well established in practice. This early polyphony is based on three simple and three compound intervals. The first group comprises fourths, fifths, and octaves; while the second group has octave-plus-fourths, octave-plus-fifths, and double octaves. This new practice is given the name \"organum\" by the author of the treatises. \"Organum\" can further be classified depending on the time period in which it was written. The early \"organum\" as described in the \"enchiriadis\" can be termed \"strict \"organum\"\" Strict \"organum\" can, in turn, be subdivided into two types: \"diapente\" (organum at the interval of a fifth) and \"diatesseron\" (organum at the interval of a fourth). However, both of these kinds of strict \"organum\" had problems with the musical rules of the time. If either of them paralleled an original chant for too long (depending on the mode) a tritone would result.\nThis problem was somewhat overcome with the use of a second type of \"organum\". This second style of \"organum\" was called \"free \"organum\"\". Its distinguishing factor is that the parts did not have to move only in parallel motion, but could also move in oblique, or contrary motion. This made it much easier to avoid the dreaded tritone. The final style of \"organum\" that developed was known as \"melismatic \"organum\"\", which was a rather dramatic departure from the rest of the polyphonic music up to this point. This new style was not note against note, but was rather one sustained line accompanied by a florid melismatic line. This final kind of \"organum\" was also incorporated by the most famous polyphonic composer of this time\u2014L\u00e9onin. He united this style with measured discant passages, which used the rhythmic modes to create the pinnacle of \"organum\" composition. This final stage of \"organum\" is sometimes referred to as Notre-Dame school of polyphony, since that was where L\u00e9onin (and his student P\u00e9rotin) were stationed. Furthermore, this kind of polyphony influenced all subsequent styles, with the later polyphonic genera of motets starting as a trope of existing Notre-Dame \"organums\".\nAnother important element of medieval music theory was the system by which pitches were arranged and understood. During the Middle Ages, this systematic arrangement of a series of whole steps and half steps, what we now call a scale, was known as a mode. The modal system worked like the scales of today, insomuch that it provided the rules and material for melodic writing. The eight church modes are: \"Dorian\", \"Hypodorian\", \"Phrygian\", \"Hypophrygian\", \"Lydian\", \"Hypolydian\", \"Mixolydian\", and \"Hypomixolydian\". Much of the information concerning these modes, as well as the practical application of them, was codified in the 11th century by the theorist Johannes Afflighemensis. In his work he describes three defining elements to each mode: the final (or \"finalis)\", the reciting tone (\"tenor\" or \"confinalis\"), and the range (or \"ambitus\"). The \"finalis\" is the tone that serves as the focal point for the mode and, as the name suggests, is almost always used as the final tone. The reciting tone is the tone that serves as the primary focal point in the melody (particularly internally). It is generally also the tone most often repeated in the piece, and finally the range delimits the upper and lower tones for a given mode. The eight modes can be further divided into four categories based on their final (\"finalis\").\nMedieval theorists called these pairs \"maneriae\" and labeled them according to the Greek ordinal numbers. Those modes that have d, e, f, and g as their final are put into the groups \"protus\", \"deuterus\", \"tritus\", and \"tetrardus\" respectively. These can then be divided further based on whether the mode is \"authentic\" or \"plagal.\" These distinctions deal with the range of the mode in relation to the final. The authentic modes have a range that is about an octave (one tone above or below is allowed) and start on the final, whereas the plagal modes, while still covering about an octave, start a perfect fourth below the authentic. Another interesting aspect of the modal system is the use of \"Musica ficta\" which allows pitches to be altered (changing B\u266e to B\u266d for example) in certain contexts regardless of the mode. These changes have several uses, but one that seems particularly common is to avoid melodic difficulties caused by the tritone.\nThese ecclesiastical modes, although they have Greek names, have little relationship to the modes as set out by Greek theorists. Rather, most of the terminology seems to be a misappropriation on the part of the medieval theorists Although the church modes have no relation to the ancient Greek modes, the overabundance of Greek terminology does point to an interesting possible origin in the liturgical melodies of the Byzantine tradition. This system is called \"octoechos\" and is also divided into eight categories, called \"echoi\". \nFor specific medieval music theorists, see also: Isidore of Seville, Aurelian of R\u00e9\u00f4me, Odo of Cluny, Guido of Arezzo, Hermannus Contractus, Johannes Cotto (Johannes Afflighemensis), Johannes de Muris, Franco of Cologne, Johannes de Garlandia (Johannes Gallicus), Anonymous IV, Marchetto da Padova (Marchettus of Padua), Jacques of Li\u00e8ge, Johannes de Grocheo, Petrus de Cruce (Pierre de la Croix), and Philippe de Vitry.\nEarly medieval music (500\u20131000).\nEarly chant traditions.\nChant (or plainsong) is a monophonic sacred (single, unaccompanied melody) form which represents the earliest known music of the Christian church. Chant developed separately in several European centres. Although the most important were Rome, Hispania, Gaul, Milan, and Ireland, there were others as well. These styles were all developed to support the regional liturgies used when celebrating the Mass there. Each area developed its own chant and rules for celebration. In Spain and Portugal, Mozarabic chant was used and shows the influence of North African music. The Mozarabic liturgy even survived through Muslim rule, though this was an isolated strand and this music was later suppressed in an attempt to enforce conformity on the entire liturgy. In Milan, Ambrosian chant, named after St. Ambrose, was the standard, while Beneventan chant developed around Benevento, another Italian liturgical center. Gallican chant was used in Gaul, and Celtic chant in Ireland and Great Britain.\nThe reigning Carolingian dynasty wanted to standardize the Mass and chant across its Frankish Empire. At this time, Rome was the religious centre of western Europe, and northern Gaul and Rhineland (most notably the city of Aachen) was the political centre. The standardization effort consisted mainly of combining the two \u2013 Roman and Gallican \u2013 regional liturgies. Charlemagne (742\u2013814) sent trained singers throughout the Empire to teach this new form of chant. This body of chant became known as Gregorian Chant, named after Pope Gregory I. Gregorian chant was said to be collected and codified during his papacy or even composed by himself, inspired by the Holy Spirit in the form of a dove. However, that is only a popular legend that was spread by the Carolingians who wanted to legitimize their liturgy unification efforts. Gregorian chant certainly didn't exist at that time. It is possible, nevertheless, that Gregory's papacy really may have contributed to collecting and codifying the Roman chant of the time which then, in the 9th and 10th centuries, formed \u2013 alongside the Gallican chant \u2013 one of the two roots of the Gregorian chant. By the 12th and 13th centuries, Gregorian chant had superseded all the other Western chant traditions, with the exception of the Ambrosian chant in Milan and the Mozarabic chant in a few specially designated Spanish chapels. Hildegard von Bingen (1098\u20131179) was one of the earliest known female composers. She wrote many monophonic works for the Catholic Church, almost all of them for female voices.\nEarly polyphony: organum.\nAround the end of the 9th century, singers in monasteries such as St. Gall in Switzerland began experimenting with adding another part to the chant, generally a voice in parallel motion, singing mostly in perfect fourths or fifths above the original tune (see interval). This development is called organum and represents the beginnings of counterpoint and, ultimately, harmony. Over the next several centuries, organum developed in several ways.\nThe most significant of these developments was the creation of \"florid organum\" around 1100, sometimes known as the school of St. Martial (named after a monastery in south-central France, which contains the best-preserved manuscript of this repertory). In \"florid organum\" the original tune would be sung in long notes while an accompanying voice would sing many notes to each one of the original, often in a highly elaborate fashion, all the while emphasizing the perfect consonances (fourths, fifths and octaves), as in the earlier organa. Later developments of organum occurred in England, where the interval of the third was particularly favoured, and where organa were likely improvised against an existing chant melody, and at Notre-Dame in Paris, which was to be the centre of musical creative activity throughout the thirteenth century.\nMuch of the music from the early medieval period is anonymous. Some of the names may have been poets and lyric writers, and the tunes for which they wrote words may have been composed by others. Attribution of monophonic music of the medieval period is not always reliable. Surviving manuscripts from this period include the Musica Enchiriadis, Codex Calixtinus of Santiago de Compostela, the Magnus Liber, and the Winchester Troper. For information about specific composers or poets writing during the early medieval period, see Pope Gregory I, St. Godric, Hildegard of Bingen, Hucbald, Notker Balbulus, Odo of Arezzo, Odo of Cluny, and Tutilo.\nLiturgical drama.\nAnother musical tradition of Europe originating during the early Middle Ages was the liturgical drama.\nLiturgical drama developed possibly in the 10th century from the tropes\u2014poetic embellishments of the liturgical texts. One of the tropes, the so-called Quem Quaeritis, belonging to the liturgy of Easter morning, developed into a short play around the year 950. The oldest surviving written source is the Winchester Troper. Around the year 1000 it was sung widely in Northern Europe.\nShortly, a similar Christmas play was developed, musically and textually following the Easter one, and other plays followed.\nThere is a controversy among musicologists as to the instrumental accompaniment of such plays, given that the stage directions, very elaborate and precise in other respects, do not request any participation of instruments. These dramas were performed by monks, nuns and priests. In contrast to secular plays, which were spoken, the liturgical drama was always sung. Many have been preserved sufficiently to allow modern reconstruction and performance (for example the \"Play of Daniel\", which has been recently recorded at least ten times).\nHigh medieval music (1000\u20131300).\nGoliards.\nThe Goliards were itinerant poet-musicians of Europe from the tenth to the middle of the thirteenth century. Most were scholars or ecclesiastics, and they wrote and sang in Latin. Although many of the poems have survived, very little of the music has. They were possibly influential\u2014even decisively so\u2014on the troubadour\u2013trouv\u00e8re tradition which was to follow. Most of their poetry is secular and, while some of the songs celebrate religious ideals, others are frankly profane, dealing with drunkenness, debauchery and lechery. One of the most important extant sources of Goliards chansons is the Carmina Burana.\n\"Ars antiqua\".\nThe flowering of the Notre-Dame school of polyphony from around 1150 to 1250 corresponded to the equally impressive achievements in Gothic architecture: indeed the centre of activity was at the cathedral of Notre-Dame itself. Sometimes the music of this period is called the Parisian school, or Parisian organum, and represents the beginning of what is conventionally known as \"Ars antiqua\". This was the period in which rhythmic notation first appeared in western music, mainly a context-based method of rhythmic notation known as the rhythmic modes.\nThis was also the period in which concepts of formal structure developed which were attentive to proportion, texture, and architectural effect. Composers of the period alternated florid and discant organum (more note-against-note, as opposed to the succession of many-note melismas against long-held notes found in the florid type), and created several new musical forms: clausulae, which were melismatic sections of organa extracted and fitted with new words and further musical elaboration; conductus, which were songs for one or more voices to be sung rhythmically, most likely in a procession of some sort; and tropes, which were additions of new words and sometimes new music to sections of older chant. All of these genres save one were based upon chant; that is, one of the voices, (usually three, though sometimes four) nearly always the lowest (the tenor at this point) sang a chant melody, though with freely composed note-lengths, over which the other voices sang organum. The exception to this method was the conductus, a two-voice composition that was freely composed in its entirety.\nThe motet, one of the most important musical forms of the high Middle Ages and Renaissance, developed initially during the Notre-Dame period out of the clausula, especially the form using multiple voices as elaborated by P\u00e9rotin, who paved the way for this particularly by replacing many of his predecessor (as canon of the cathedral) L\u00e9onin's lengthy florid clausulae with substitutes in a discant style. Gradually, there came to be entire books of these substitutes, available to be fitted in and out of the various chants. Since, in fact, there were more than can possibly have been used in context, it is probable that the clausulae came to be performed independently, either in other parts of the mass, or in private devotions. The clausula, thus practised, became the motet when troped with non-liturgical words, and this further developed into a form of great elaboration, sophistication and subtlety in the fourteenth century, the period of \"Ars nova\". Surviving manuscripts from this era include the Montpellier Codex, Bamberg Codex, and Las Huelgas Codex.\nComposers of this time include L\u00e9onin, P\u00e9rotin, W. de Wycombe, Adam de St. Victor, and Petrus de Cruce (Pierre de la Croix). Petrus is credited with the innovation of writing more than three semibreves to fit the length of a breve. Coming before the innovation of imperfect tempus, this practice inaugurated the era of what are now called \"Petronian\" motets. These late 13th-century works are in three to four parts and have multiple texts sung simultaneously. Originally, the tenor line (from the Latin \"tenere\", \"to hold\") held a preexisting liturgical chant line in the original Latin, while the text of the one, two, or even three voices above, called the \"voces organales\", provided commentary on the liturgical subject either in Latin or in the vernacular French. The rhythmic values of the \"voces organales\" decreased as the parts multiplied, with the \"duplum\" (the part above the tenor) having smaller rhythmic values than the tenor, the \"triplum\" (the line above the \"duplum\") having smaller rhythmic values than the \"duplum\", and so on. As time went by, the texts of the \"voces organales\" became increasingly secular in nature and had less and less overt connection to the liturgical text in the tenor line.\nThe increasing rhythmic complexity seen in Petronian motets would be a fundamental characteristic of the 14th century, though music in France, Italy, and England would take quite different paths during that time.\nCantigas de Santa Maria.\nThe Cantigas de Santa Maria (\"Canticles of St. Mary\") are 420 poems with musical notation, written in Galician-Portuguese during the reign of Alfonso X \"The Wise\" (1221\u20131284). The manuscript was probably compiled from 1270 to 1280, and is highly decorated, with an illumination every 10 poems. The illuminations often depict musicians making the manuscript a particularly important source of medieval music iconography. Though the \"Cantigas\" are often attributed to Alfonso, it remains unclear as to whether he was a composer himself, or perhaps a compiler; Alfonso is known to regularly invited musicians and poets to court whom were undoubtedly involved in the \"Cantigas\" production.\nIt is one of the largest collections of monophonic (solo) songs from the Middle Ages and is characterized by the mention of the Virgin Mary in every song, while every tenth song is a hymn. The manuscripts have survived in four codices: two at El Escorial, one at Madrid's National Library, and one in Florence, Italy. Some have colored miniatures showing pairs of musicians playing a wide variety of instruments.\nTroubadours and trouv\u00e8res.\nThe music of the troubadours and trouv\u00e8res was a vernacular tradition of monophonic secular song, probably accompanied by instruments, sung by professional, occasionally itinerant, musicians who were as skilled as poets as they were singers and instrumentalists. The language of the troubadours was Occitan (also known as the langue d'oc, or Proven\u00e7al); the language of the trouv\u00e8res was Old French (also known as langue d'o\u00efl). The period of the troubadours corresponded to the flowering of cultural life in Provence which lasted through the twelfth century and into the first decade of the thirteenth. Typical subjects of troubadour song were war, chivalry and courtly love\u2014the love of an idealized woman from afar. The period of the troubadours wound down after the Albigensian Crusade, the fierce campaign by Pope Innocent III to eliminate the Cathar heresy (and northern barons' desire to appropriate the wealth of the south). Surviving troubadours went either to Portugal, Spain, northern Italy or northern France (where the trouv\u00e8re tradition lived on), where their skills and techniques contributed to the later developments of secular musical culture in those places.\nThe trouv\u00e8res and troubadours shared similar musical styles, but the trouv\u00e8res were generally noblemen. The music of the trouv\u00e8res was similar to that of the troubadours, but was able to survive into the thirteenth century unaffected by the Albigensian Crusade. Most of the more than two thousand surviving trouv\u00e8re songs include music, and show a sophistication as great as that of the poetry it accompanies.\nMinnes\u00e4nger and Meistersinger.\nThe Minnes\u00e4nger tradition was the Germanic counterpart to the activity of the troubadours and trouv\u00e8res to the west. Unfortunately, few sources survive from the time; the sources of Minnesang are mostly from two or three centuries after the peak of the movement, leading to some controversy over the accuracy of these sources. Among the Minnes\u00e4ngers with surviving music are Wolfram von Eschenbach, Walther von der Vogelweide, and Niedhart von Reuenthal.\nA Meistersinger (German for \"master singer\") was a member of a German guild for lyric poetry, composition and unaccompanied art song of the 14th, 15th and 16th centuries. The Meistersingers were drawn from middle class males for the most part. Konrad von W\u00fcrzburg, Reinmar von Zweter, and Heinrich Frauenlob. Frauenlob allegedly established the earliest Meistersinger school at Mainz, early in the 14th century. The schools originated first in the upper Rhine district, then spread elsewhere.\nTrovadorismo.\nIn the Middle Ages, Galician-Portuguese was the language used in nearly all of Iberia for lyric poetry. From this language derive both modern Galician and Portuguese. The Galician-Portuguese school, which was influenced to some extent (mainly in certain formal aspects) by the Occitan troubadours, is first documented at the end of the twelfth century and lasted until the middle of the fourteenth.\nThe earliest extant composition in this school is usually agreed to be \"Ora faz ost' o senhor de Navarra\" by the Portuguese Jo\u00e3o Soares de Paiva, usually dated just before or after 1200. The troubadours of the movement, not to be confused with the Occitan troubadours (who frequented courts in nearby Le\u00f3n and Castile), wrote almost entirely \"cantigas\". Beginning probably around the middle of the thirteenth century, these songs, known also as \"cantares\" or \"trovas\", began to be compiled in collections known as \"cancioneiros\" (songbooks). Three such anthologies are known: the Cancioneiro da Ajuda, the Cancioneiro Colocci-Brancuti (or Cancioneiro da Biblioteca Nacional de Lisboa), and the Cancioneiro da Vaticana. In addition to these there is the priceless collection of over 400 Galician-Portuguese \"cantigas\" in the Cantigas de Santa Maria, which tradition attributes to Alfonso X.\nThe Galician-Portuguese \"cantigas\" can be divided into three basic genres: male-voiced love poetry, called \"cantigas de amor\" (or \"cantigas d'amor\", in Galician-Portuguese spelling) female-voiced love poetry, called \"cantigas de amigo\" (or \"cantigas d'amigo\"); and poetry of insult and mockery called \"cantigas de esc\u00e1rnio e maldizer\" (or \"cantigas d'escarnho e de mal dizer\"). All three are lyric genres in the technical sense that they were strophic songs with either musical accompaniment or introduction on a stringed instrument. But all three genres also have dramatic elements, leading early scholars to characterize them as lyric-dramatic.\nThe origins of the cantigas d'amor are usually traced to Proven\u00e7al and Old French lyric poetry, but formally and rhetorically they are quite different. The \"cantigas d'amigo\" are probably rooted in a native song tradition, though this view has been contested. The \"cantigas d'escarnho e maldizer\" may also (according to Lang) have deep local roots. The latter two genres (totalling around 900 texts) make the Galician-Portuguese lyric unique in the entire panorama of medieval Romance poetry.\nTroubadours with surviving melodies.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Col-begin/styles.css\"/&gt;\nLate medieval music (1300\u20131400).\nFrance: \"Ars nova\".\nThe beginning of the \"Ars nova\" is one of the few clear chronological divisions in medieval music, since it corresponds to the publication of the \"Roman de Fauvel\", a huge compilation of poetry and music, in 1310 and 1314. The \"Roman de Fauvel\" is a satire on abuses in the medieval church, and is filled with medieval motets, lais, rondeaux and other new secular forms. While most of the music is anonymous, it contains several pieces by Philippe de Vitry, one of the first composers of the isorhythmic motet, a development which distinguishes the fourteenth century. The isorhythmic motet was perfected by Guillaume de Machaut, the finest composer of the time.\nDuring the \"Ars nova\" era, secular music acquired a polyphonic sophistication formerly found only in sacred music, a development not surprising considering the secular character of the early Renaissance (while this music is typically considered \"medieval\", the social forces that produced it were responsible for the beginning of the literary and artistic Renaissance in Italy\u2014the distinction between Middle Ages and Renaissance is a blurry one, especially considering arts as different as music and painting). The term \"Ars nova\" (new art, or new technique) was coined by Philippe de Vitry in his treatise of that name (probably written in 1322), in order to distinguish the practice from the music of the immediately preceding age.\nThe dominant secular genre of the Ars Nova was the \"chanson\", as it would continue to be in France for another two centuries. These chansons were composed in musical forms corresponding to the poetry they set, which were in the so-called \"formes fixes\" of \"rondeau\", \"ballade\", and \"virelai\". These forms significantly affected the development of musical structure in ways that are felt even today; for example, the \"ouvert-clos\" rhyme-scheme shared by all three demanded a musical realization which contributed directly to the modern notion of antecedent and consequent phrases. It was in this period, too, in which began the long tradition of setting the mass ordinary. This tradition started around mid-century with isolated or paired settings of Kyries, Glorias, etc., but Machaut composed what is thought to be the first complete mass conceived as one composition. The sound world of Ars Nova music is very much one of linear primacy and rhythmic complexity. \"Resting\" intervals are the fifth and octave, with thirds and sixths considered dissonances. Leaps of more than a sixth in individual voices are not uncommon, leading to speculation of instrumental participation at least in secular performance. Surviving French manuscripts include the Ivrea Codex and the Apt Codex.\nFor information about specific French composers writing in late medieval era, see Jehan de Lescurel, Philippe de Vitry, Guillaume de Machaut, Borlet, Solage, and Fran\u00e7ois Andrieu.\nItaly: \"Trecento\".\nMost of the music of \"Ars nova\" was French in origin; however, the term is often loosely applied to all of the music of the fourteenth century, especially to include the secular music in Italy. There this period was often referred to as \"Trecento\". Italian music has always been known for its lyrical or melodic character, and this goes back to the 14th century in many respects. Italian secular music of this time (what little surviving liturgical music there is, is similar to the French except for somewhat different notation) featured what has been called the \"cantalina\" style, with a florid top voice supported by two (or even one; a fair amount of Italian Trecento music is for only two voices) that are more regular and slower moving. This type of texture remained a feature of Italian music in the popular 15th and 16th century secular genres as well, and was an important influence on the eventual development of the trio texture that revolutionized music in the 17th.\nThere were three main forms for secular works in the Trecento. One was the madrigal, not the same as that of 150\u2013250 years later, but with a verse/refrain-like form. Three-line stanzas, each with different words, alternated with a two-line \"ritornello\", with the same text at each appearance. Perhaps we can see the seeds of the subsequent late-Renaissance and Baroque ritornello in this device; it too returns again and again, recognizable each time, in contrast with its surrounding disparate sections. Another form, the \"caccia\" (\"chase,\") was written for two voices in a canon at the unison. Sometimes, this form also featured a ritornello, which was occasionally also in a canonic style. Usually, the name of this genre provided a double meaning, since the texts of \"caccia\" were primarily about hunts and related outdoor activities, or at least action-filled scenes; second meaning was that a voice \"caccia\" (follows, run after) the preceding one. The third main form was the \"ballata\", which was roughly equivalent to the French \"virelai\".\nSurviving Italian manuscripts include the Squarcialupi Codex and the Rossi Codex. For information about specific Italian composers writing in the late medieval era, see Francesco Landini, Gherardello da Firenze, Andrea da Firenze, Lorenzo da Firenze, Giovanni da Firenze (aka Giovanni da Cascia), Bartolino da Padova, Jacopo da Bologna, Donato da Cascia, Lorenzo Masini, Niccol\u00f2 da Perugia, and Maestro Piero.\nGermany: \"Geisslerlieder\".\nThe Geisslerlieder were the songs of wandering bands of flagellants, who sought to appease the wrath of an angry God by penitential music accompanied by mortification of their bodies. There were two separate periods of activity of Geisslerlied: one around the middle of the thirteenth century, from which, unfortunately, no music survives (although numerous lyrics do); and another from 1349, for which both words and music survive intact due to the attention of a single priest who wrote about the movement and recorded its music. This second period corresponds to the spread of the Black Death in Europe, and documents one of the most terrible events in European history. Both periods of Geisslerlied activity were mainly in Germany.\n\"Ars subtilior\".\nAs often seen at the end of any musical era, the end of the medieval era is marked by a highly manneristic style known as \"Ars subtilior\". In some ways, this was an attempt to meld the French and Italian styles. This music was highly stylized, with a rhythmic complexity that was not matched until the 20th century. In fact, not only was the rhythmic complexity of this repertoire largely unmatched for five and a half centuries, with extreme syncopations, mensural trickery, and even examples of \"augenmusik\" (such as a chanson by Baude Cordier written out in manuscript in the shape of a heart), but also its melodic material was quite complex as well, particularly in its interaction with the rhythmic structures. Already discussed under Ars Nova has been the practice of isorhythm, which continued to develop through late-century and in fact did not achieve its highest degree of sophistication until early in the 15th century. Instead of using isorhythmic techniques in one or two voices, or trading them among voices, some works came to feature a pervading isorhythmic texture which rivals the integral serialism of the 20th century in its systematic ordering of rhythmic and tonal elements. The term \"mannerism\" was applied by later scholars, as it often is, in response to an impression of sophistication being practised for its own sake, a malady which some authors have felt infected the \"Ars subtilior\".\nOne of the most important extant sources of Ars Subtilior chansons is the Chantilly Codex. For information about specific composers writing music in \"Ars subtilior\" style, see Anthonello de Caserta, Philippus de Caserta (aka Philipoctus de Caserta), Johannes Ciconia, Matteo da Perugia, Lorenzo da Firenze, Grimace, Jacob Senleches, and Baude Cordier.\nTransitioning to the Renaissance.\nDemarcating the end of the medieval era and the beginning of the Renaissance era, with regard to the composition of music, is difficult. While the music of the fourteenth century is fairly obviously medieval in conception, the music of the early fifteenth century is often conceived as belonging to a transitional period, not only retaining some of the ideals of the end of the Middle Ages (such as a type of polyphonic writing in which the parts differ widely from each other in character, as each has its specific textural function), but also showing some of the characteristic traits of the Renaissance (such as the increasingly international style developing through the diffusion of Franco-Flemish musicians throughout Europe, and in terms of texture an increasing equality of parts). Music historians do not agree on when the Renaissance era began, but most historians agree that England was still a medieval society in the early fifteenth century (see periodization issues of the Middle Ages). While there is no consensus, 1400 is a useful marker, because it was around that time that the Renaissance came into full swing in Italy.\nThe increasing reliance on the interval of the third as a consonance is one of the most pronounced features of transition into the Renaissance. Polyphony, in use since the 12th century, became increasingly elaborate with highly independent voices throughout the 14th century. With John Dunstaple and other English composers, partly through the local technique of faburden (an improvisatory process in which a chant melody and a written part predominantly in parallel sixths above it are ornamented by one sung in perfect fourths below the latter, and which later took hold on the continent as \"fauxbordon\"), the interval of the third emerges as an important musical development; because of this \"Contenance Angloise\" (\"English countenance\"), English composers' music is often regarded as the first to sound less truly bizarre to 2000s-era audiences who are not trained in music history.\nEnglish stylistic tendencies in this regard had come to fruition and began to influence continental composers as early as the 1420s, as can be seen in works of the young Dufay, among others. While the Hundred Years' War continued, English nobles, armies, their chapels and retinues, and therefore some of their composers, travelled in France and performed their music there; it must also of course be remembered that the English controlled portions of northern France at this time. English manuscripts include the Worcester Fragments, the Old St. Andrews Music Book, the Old Hall Manuscript, and Egerton Manuscript. For information about specific composers who are considered transitional between the medieval and the Renaissance, see Zacara da Teramo, Paolo da Firenze, Giovanni Mazzuoli, Antonio da Cividale, Antonius Romanus, Bartolomeo da Bologna, Roy Henry, Arnold de Lantins, Leonel Power, and John Dunstaple.\nAn early composer from the Franco-Flemish School of the Renaissance was Johannes Ockeghem (1410/1425 \u20131497). He was the most famous member of the Franco-Flemish School in the last half of the 15th century, and is often considered the most influential composer between Dufay and Josquin des Prez. Ockeghem probably studied with Gilles Binchois, and at least was closely associated with him at the Burgundian court. Antoine Busnois wrote a motet in honor of Ockeghem. Ockeghem is a direct link from the Burgundian style to the next generation of Netherlanders, such as Obrecht and Josquin. A strong influence on Josquin des Prez and the subsequent generation of Netherlanders, Ockeghem was famous throughout Europe Charles VII for his expressive music, although he was equally renowned for his technical prowess.\nInfluence.\nThe musical style of P\u00e9rotin influenced 20th-century composers such as John Luther Adams and minimalist composer Steve Reich.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The term is an acronym for microwave amplification by stimulated emission of radiation. Nikolay Basov, Alexander Prokhorov and Joseph Weber introduced the concept of the maser in 1952, and Charles H. Townes, James P. Gordon, and Herbert J. Zeiger built the first maser at Columbia University in 1953. Townes, Basov and Prokhorov won the 1964 Nobel Prize in Physics for theoretical work leading to the maser. Masers are used as timekeeping devices in atomic clocks, and as extremely low-noise microwave amplifiers in radio telescopes and deep-space spacecraft communication ground-stations.\nModern masers can be designed to generate electromagnetic waves at microwave frequencies and radio and infrared frequencies. For this reason, Townes suggested replacing \"microwave\" with \"molecular\" as the first word in the acronym \"maser\".\nThe \"laser\" works by the same principle as the maser, but produces higher-frequency coherent radiation at visible wavelengths. The maser was the precursor to the laser, inspiring theoretical work by Townes and Arthur Leonard Schawlow that led to the invention of the laser in 1960 by Theodore Maiman. When the coherent optical oscillator was first imagined in 1957, it was originally called the \"optical maser\". This was ultimately changed to laser, for \"light amplification by stimulated emission of radiation\". Gordon Gould is credited with creating this acronym in 1957.\nHistory.\nThe theoretical principles governing the operation of a maser were first described by Joseph Weber of the University of Maryland, College Park at the Electron Tube Research Conference in June 1952 in Ottawa, with a summary published in the June 1953 Transactions of the Institute of Radio Engineers Professional Group on Electron Devices, and simultaneously by Nikolay Basov and Alexander Prokhorov from Lebedev Institute of Physics, at an \"All-Union Conference on Radio-Spectroscopy\" held by the USSR Academy of Sciences in May 1952, published in October 1954.\nIndependently, Charles Hard Townes, James P. Gordon, and H. J. Zeiger built the first ammonia maser at Columbia University in 1953. This device used stimulated emission in a stream of energized ammonia molecules to produce amplification of microwaves at a frequency of about 24.0 gigahertz. Townes later worked with Arthur L. Schawlow to describe the principle of the \"optical maser\", or \"laser\", of which Theodore H. Maiman created the first working model in 1960.\nFor their research in the field of stimulated emission, Townes, Basov and Prokhorov were awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1964.\nTechnology.\nThe maser is based on the principle of stimulated emission proposed by Albert Einstein in 1917. When atoms have been induced into an excited energy state, they can amplify radiation at a frequency particular to the element or molecule used as the masing medium (similar to what occurs in the lasing medium in a laser).\nBy putting such an amplifying medium in a resonant cavity, feedback is created that can produce coherent radiation.\n21st-century developments.\nIn 2012, a research team from the National Physical Laboratory and Imperial College London developed a solid-state maser that operated at room temperature by using optically pumped, pentacene-doped p-Terphenyl as the amplifier medium. It produced pulses of maser emission lasting for a few hundred microseconds.\nIn 2018, a research team from Imperial College London and University College London demonstrated continuous-wave maser oscillation using synthetic diamonds containing nitrogen-vacancy defects.\nIn 2025 a team from Northumbria University created a low-cost energy-efficient unit that works at room temperature and uses an LED as the source of emission.\nUses.\nMasers serve as high precision frequency references. These \"atomic frequency standards\" are one of the many forms of atomic clocks. Masers were also used as low-noise microwave amplifiers in radio telescopes, though these have largely been replaced by amplifiers based on FETs.\nDuring the early 1960s, the Jet Propulsion Laboratory developed a maser to provide ultra-low-noise amplification of S-band microwave signals received from deep space probes. This maser used deeply refrigerated helium to chill the amplifier down to a temperature of 4\u00a0kelvin. Amplification was achieved by exciting a ruby comb with a 12.0 gigahertz klystron. In the early years, it took days to chill and remove the impurities from the hydrogen lines. \nRefrigeration was a two-stage process, with a large Linde unit on the ground, and a crosshead compressor within the antenna. The final injection was at through a micrometer-adjustable entry to the chamber. The whole system noise temperature looking at cold sky (2.7\u00a0kelvin in the microwave band) was 17\u00a0kelvin. This gave such a low noise figure that the Mariner IV space probe could send still pictures from Mars back to the Earth, even though the output power of its radio transmitter was only 15\u00a0watts, and hence the total signal power received was only \u2212169\u00a0decibels with respect to a milliwatt\u00a0(dBm).\nHydrogen maser.\nThe hydrogen maser is used as an atomic frequency standard. Together with other kinds of atomic clocks, these help make up the International Atomic Time standard (\"Temps Atomique International\" or \"TAI\" in French). This is the international time scale coordinated by the International Bureau of Weights and Measures. Norman Ramsey and his colleagues first conceived of the maser as a timing standard. More recent masers are practically identical to their original design. Maser oscillations rely on the stimulated emission between two hyperfine energy levels of atomic hydrogen.\nHere is a brief description of how they work:\nAstrophysical masers.\nMaser-like stimulated emission has also been observed in nature from interstellar space, and it is frequently called \"superradiant emission\" to distinguish it from laboratory masers. These emissions are observed from molecules such as water (H2O), hydroxyl radicals (\u2022OH), methanol (CH3OH), formaldehyde (HCHO), silicon monoxide (SiO), and carbodiimide (HNCNH). Water molecules in star-forming regions can undergo a population inversion and emit radiation at about 22.0\u00a0GHz, creating the brightest spectral line in the radio universe. Some water masers also emit radiation from a rotational transition at a frequency of 96\u00a0GHz.\nExtremely powerful masers, associated with active galactic nuclei, are known as megamasers and are up to a million times more powerful than stellar masers.\nTerminology.\nThe meaning of the term \"maser\" has changed slightly since its introduction. Initially the acronym was universally given as \"microwave amplification by stimulated emission of radiation\", which described devices which emitted in the microwave region of the electromagnetic spectrum.\nThe principle and concept of stimulated emission has since been extended to more devices and frequencies. Thus, the original acronym is sometimes modified, as suggested by Charles H. Townes, to \"\"molecular\" amplification by stimulated emission of radiation.\" Some have asserted that Townes's efforts to extend the acronym in this way were primarily motivated by the desire to increase the importance of his invention, and his reputation in the scientific community. \nWhen the laser was developed, Townes and Schawlow and their colleagues at Bell Labs pushed the use of the term \"optical maser\", but this was largely abandoned in favor of \"laser\", coined by their rival Gordon Gould. In modern usage, devices that emit in the X-ray through infrared portions of the spectrum are typically called lasers, and devices that emit in the microwave region and below are commonly called \"masers\", regardless of whether they emit microwaves or other frequencies.\nGould originally proposed distinct names for devices that emit in each portion of the spectrum, including \"grasers\" (gamma ray lasers), \"xasers\" (x-ray lasers), \"uvasers\" (ultraviolet lasers), \"lasers\" (visible lasers), \"irasers\" (infrared lasers), \"masers\" (microwave masers), and \"rasers\" (RF masers). Most of these terms never caught on, however, and all have now become (apart from in science fiction) obsolete except for \"maser\" and \"laser\".\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Botta started his own architectural practice in Lugano in 1970.\nCareer.\nBotta designed his first building, a two-family house at Morbio Superiore in Ticino, at age 16. He graduated from the Universit\u00e0 Iuav di Venezia (1969). While the arrangement of spaces in this structure is inconsistent, its relationship to its site, separation of living from service spaces, and deep window recesses echo of what would become his stark, strong, towering style. His designs tend to include a strong sense of geometry, often being based on very simple shapes, yet creating unique volumes of space. His buildings are often made of brick, yet his use of material is wide, varied, and often unique.\nHis trademark style can be seen widely in Switzerland, particularly the Ticino region and also in the Mediatheque in Villeurbanne (1988), a cathedral in \u00c9vry (1995), and the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art or SFMOMA (1994). He also designed the Europa-Park Dome, which houses many major events at the Europa-Park theme park resort in Germany. Religious works by Botta, including the Cymbalista Synagogue and Jewish Heritage Center were shown in London at the Royal Institute of British Architects in an exhibition entitled, \"Architetture del Sacro: Prayers in Stone.\" \u201cA church is the place, par excellence, of architecture\u201d, he said in an interview with architectural historian Judith Dupr\u00e9. \u201cWhen you enter a church, you already are part of what has transpired and will transpire there. The church is a house that puts a believer in a dimension where he or she is the protagonist. The sacred directly lives in the collective. Man becomes a participant in a church, even if he never says anything.\u201d\nIn 1998, he designed the new bus station for Vimercate (near Milan), a red brick building linked to many facilities, underlining the city's recent development.\nHe worked at La Scala's theatre renovation, which proved controversial as preservationists feared that historic details would be lost. \nIn 2004, he designed Museum One (M1) of the Leeum, Samsung Museum of Art in Seoul, South Korea. On 1 January 2006 he received the Grand Officer award from President of the Italian Republic Carlo Azeglio Ciampi. In 2006, he designed his first-ever spa, the Bergoase Spa in Arosa, Switzerland. The spa opened in December 2006 and cost an estimated CHF 35 million. Mario Botta participated in the Stock Exchange of Visions project in 2007. He was a member of the Jury of the Global Holcim Awards in 2012. In 2014, he was awarded with the Prize Javier Carvajal by the Universidad de Navarra.\nOne of Botta's less-known works is the NBG Insurance Headquarters complex in Athens, Greece, completed in 2006, which represents a collaboration with Rena Sakellaridou and Morfo Papanikolaou of SPARCH architecture. The office complex features two solid forms arranged around a public square, facilitating views of the nearby Acropolis, and an atrium filled with glass skywalks. The project, which lies substantially underground so as to minimize the impact on the urban fabric, emphasizes movement and light by transforming masses into voids. Sakellaridou highlights that the project is typical of Botta's style in its symmetry, geometry, and solid form. The collaboration of Botta and Sakellaridou is notable in that the latter paid tribute to the former in her book \"Mario Botta: Architectural Poetics\"; regarding his design oeuvre, she writes: \"Botta continuously invents what is a strong possibility in the vast universe of unrealized architectural probability.\"\nArchitectural style.\nMario Botta has been heavily influenced by the Modern architecture movement, specifically the three Modernist architects Botta has worked under: Louis Kahn, Carlo Scarpa and Le Corbusier. Botta does not place himself in the Modernist movement, but rather he is responding to it. His architecture is tied very closely with nature, and is very simple. Botta believes that architecture is a basic need for man, and therefore creates buildings that symbolize simplicity and the essentials. About his own work, he says \"it is an architecture which is measured by the yardstick of a man's needs.\"\nMario Botta's style is in part defined by his clients needs. Most of his early work was planned and constructed under a tight budget, so use of low cost materials, such as exposed concrete blocks, was necessary. To Botta, material cost does not influence or define his style, as good architecture is made regardless of the medium or material. Botta also believes that architecture is the formal expression of history; and his job as an architect, to some degree, is to give validity to low budget materials through thoughtful expression.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Antony was appointed administrator of Italy while Caesar eliminated political opponents in Greece, North Africa, and Spain. After Caesar's assassination in 44 BC, Antony joined forces with Lepidus, another of Caesar's generals, and Octavian, Caesar's great-nephew and adopted son, forming a three-man dictatorship known to historians as the Second Triumvirate. The Triumvirs defeated Caesar's killers, the \"Liberatores\", at the Battle of Philippi in 42 BC, and divided the government of the Republic among themselves. Antony was assigned Rome's eastern provinces, including the client kingdom of Egypt, then ruled by Cleopatra VII, and was given the command in Rome's war against Parthia.\nRelations among the triumvirs were strained as the various members sought greater political power. Civil war between Antony and Octavian was averted in 40 BC, when Antony married Octavian's sister, Octavia. Despite this marriage, Antony carried on a love affair with Cleopatra, who bore him three children, further straining Antony's relations with Octavian. Lepidus was expelled from the association in 36 BC, and in 33 BC, disagreements between Antony and Octavian caused a split between the remaining Triumvirs. Their ongoing hostility erupted into civil war in 31 BC, when Octavian induced the republic to declare war on Cleopatra and proclaim Antony a traitor. Later that year, Antony was defeated by Octavian's forces at the Battle of Actium. Antony and Cleopatra fled to Egypt, where, having again been defeated at the Battle of Alexandria, they died by suicide.\nWith Antony dead, Octavian became the undisputed master of the Roman world. In 27 BC, Octavian was granted the honorific title of \"Augustus,\" marking the final stage in the transformation of the Republic into a monarchy, with himself as the first Roman emperor.\nEarly life.\nA member of the plebeian gens Antonia, Antony was born in Rome on 14 January 83 BC. His father and namesake was Marcus Antonius Creticus, son of the noted orator Marcus Antonius who had been murdered during the purges of Gaius Marius in the winter of 87\u201386 BC. His mother was Julia, a third cousin of Julius Caesar. Antony was an infant at the time of Lucius Cornelius Sulla's march on Rome in 82 BC.\nAccording to the Roman orator Marcus Tullius Cicero, Antony's father was incompetent and corrupt, and was only given power because he was incapable of using or abusing it effectively. In 74 BC he was given the military command to defeat the pirates of the Mediterranean, but he died in Crete in 71 BC without making any significant progress. The elder Antony's death left Antony and his brothers, Lucius and Gaius, in the care of their mother, Julia, who later married Publius Cornelius Lentulus Sura, an eminent member of the old patrician nobility. Lentulus, despite exploiting his political success for financial gain, was constantly in debt due to his extravagance. He was a major figure in the Catilinarian conspiracy and was summarily executed on the orders of the consul Cicero in 63 BC for his involvement.\nAccording to the historian Plutarch, Antony spent his teenage years wandering through Rome with his brothers and friends gambling, drinking, and becoming involved in scandalous love affairs. Antony's contemporary and enemy, Cicero, charged that he had a homosexual relationship with Gaius Scribonius Curio. This form of slander was popular during this time in the Roman Republic to demean and discredit political opponents. There is little reliable information on his political activity as a young man, although it is known that he was an associate of Publius Clodius Pulcher and his street gang. He may also have been involved in the Lupercal cult as he was referred to as a priest of this order later in life. By age twenty, Antony had amassed an enormous debt. Hoping to escape his creditors, Antony fled to Greece in 58 BC, where he studied philosophy and rhetoric at Athens.\nEarly career and occupation.\nIn 57 BC, Antony joined the military staff of Aulus Gabinius, the Proconsul of Syria, as commander of the cavalry. This appointment marks the beginning of his military career. As consul the previous year, Gabinius had consented to the exile of Cicero by Antony's mentor, Publius Clodius Pulcher.\nHyrcanus II, the Roman-supported Hasmonean High Priest of Judea, fled Jerusalem to Gabinius to seek protection against his rival and son-in-law Alexander. Years earlier in 63 BC, the Roman general Pompey had captured him and his father, King Aristobulus II, during his war against the declining Seleucid Empire. Pompey had deposed Aristobulus and installed Hyrcanus as Rome's client ruler over Judea. Antony achieved his first military distinctions after securing important victories at Alexandrium and Machaerus. With the rebellion defeated by 56 BC, Gabinius restored Hyrcanus to his position as High Priest in Judea.\nThe following year, in 55 BC, Gabinius intervened in the political affairs of Ptolemaic Egypt. Pharaoh Ptolemy XII Auletes had been deposed in a rebellion led by his daughter Berenice IV in 58 BC, forcing him to seek asylum in Rome. During Pompey's conquests years earlier, Ptolemy had received the support of Pompey, who named him an ally of Rome. Gabinius' invasion sought to restore Ptolemy to his throne. This was done against the orders of the senate but with the approval of Pompey, then Rome's leading politician, and only after the deposed king provided a 10,000 talent bribe. The Greek historian Plutarch records it was Antony who convinced Gabinius to finally act. After defeating the frontier forces of the Egyptian kingdom, Gabinius' army proceeded to attack the palace guards but they surrendered before a battle commenced. With Ptolemy XII restored as Rome's client king, Gabinius garrisoned two thousand Roman soldiers, later known as the \"Gabiniani\", in Alexandria to ensure Ptolemy's authority. In return for its support, Rome exercised considerable power over the kingdom's affairs, particularly control of the kingdom's revenues and crop yields. Antony claimed years later to have first met Cleopatra, the then 14-year-old daughter of Ptolemy XII, during this Egyptian campaign.\nWhile Antony was serving Gabinius in the East, the domestic political situation had changed in Rome. In 60 BC, a secret agreement (known as the \"First Triumvirate\") was entered into between three men to control the Republic: Marcus Licinius Crassus, Gnaeus Pompey Magnus, and Gaius Julius Caesar. Crassus, Rome's wealthiest man, had defeated the slave rebellion of Spartacus in 70 BC; Pompey conquered much of the Eastern Mediterranean in the 60's BC; Caesar was Rome's pontifex maximus and a former general in Spain. Caesar, with funding from Crassus, was elected consul for 59\u00a0BC to pursue legislation favourable to the allies' interests. Caesar, for his part, was made proconsular governor of Illyricum, Cisalpine Gaul, and Transalpine Gaul for five years. Caesar used his governorship as a launching point for his conquest of free Gaul. Some years later, in the midst of a breakdown in the alliance, the allies again pursued their interests together: in 55 BC, Crassus and Pompey were elected consuls in disputed elections and Caesar's command was extended for another five years.\nDuring his early military service, Antony married his cousin Antonia Hybrida Minor, the daughter of Gaius Antonius Hybrida. Sometime between 54 and 47 BC, the union produced a single known child, Antonia. It is unclear if this was Antony's first marriage.\nService under Caesar.\nGallic wars.\nAntony's association with Publius Clodius Pulcher allowed him to achieve greater prominence. Clodius, through the influence of his benefactor Marcus Licinius Crassus, had developed a positive political relationship with Julius Caesar. Clodius secured Antony a position on Caesar's military staff in 54 BC, joining his conquest of Gaul. Serving under Caesar, Antony demonstrated excellent military leadership. Despite a temporary alienation later in life, Antony and Caesar developed friendly relations which would continue until Caesar's assassination in 44 BC. Caesar's influence secured greater political advancement for Antony. After a year of service in Gaul, Caesar dispatched Antony to Rome to formally begin his political career, receiving election as quaestor for 52 BC. Assigned to assist Caesar, Antony returned to Gaul and commanded Caesar's cavalry during his victory at the Battle of Alesia against the Gallic chieftain Vercingetorix. Following his year in office, Antony was made one of Caesar's legates and assigned command of two legions (approximately 7,500 total soldiers).\nMeanwhile, the alliance among Caesar, Pompey and Crassus had effectively ended. Caesar's glory in conquering Gaul had served to further strain his alliance with Pompey, who, having grown jealous of his former ally, had drifted away from Caesar and towards Cato and his allies. The domestic political situation in Rome was tense, with multiple politicians leading large street gangs. Two important ones, were led by Clodius and his rival Titus Annius Milo. In 52\u00a0BC with elections unable to be held by the gangs' open violence and obstruction from radical tribunes, Milo encountered Clodius on a road outside Rome (both with entourages), which ended with Clodius' death. The violent ad hoc funeral held for Clodius resulted in widespread rioting and the destruction of the senate house, the curia Hostilia. Elevating Pompey to restore order and hold elections, the senate induced his election as sole consul. Fully secure in his political position, Pompey distanced himself from Caesar over the following years.\nAntony remained on Caesar's military staff until 50 BC, helping mopping-up actions across Gaul to secure Caesar's conquest. With the war largely over, Antony was sent back to Rome to act as Caesar's protector. With the support of Caesar, Antony was appointed to the College of Augurs, an important priestly office responsible for interpreting the will of the gods by studying the flight of birds. All public actions required favorable auspices, granting the college considerable influence. Antony was then elected as one of the ten plebeian tribunes for 49 BC. In this position, Antony could protect Caesar from his political enemies, by vetoing actions unfavorable to his patron.\nCivil war.\nThe feud between Caesar and Pompey erupted into open confrontation by early 49\u00a0BC. The consuls for the year, Gaius Claudius Marcellus and Lucius Cornelius Lentulus Crus, opposed Caesar. Pompey, though remaining in Rome, was then serving as the governor of Spain and commanded several legions. Throughout 50\u00a0BC an uneasy set of negotiations had been ongoing between Caesar and the senate, with Caesar demanding the right to stand for the consulship while in command of his forces \"in absentia\". Antony again brought up the proposal of the younger Curio that Caesar and Pompey lay down their commands and return to the status of private citizens. His proposal was well received by most of the senators but the consuls and Cato vehemently opposed it. Antony then made a new proposal: Caesar would retain only two of his eight legions and the governorship of Illyricum if he was allowed to stand for the consulship \"in absentia\". Though Pompey found the concession satisfactory, Cato and Lentulus refused to back down. Antony fled Rome, claiming to fear for his life, and returned to Caesar's camp in Cisalpine Gaul.\nWithin days of Antony's withdrawal, 7 January 49\u00a0BC, the senate reconvened. Under the leadership of Cato and with the tacit support of Pompey, the senate passed a \"senatus consultum ultimum\", a decree stripping Caesar of his command and ordering him to return to Rome and stand trial. The senate further declared Caesar a public enemy if he did not immediately disband his army. With all hopes of finding a peaceful solution gone, Caesar used Antony as a pretext for marching on Rome. As tribune, Antony's person was sacrosanct, so it was unlawful to harm him or to refuse to recognize his veto. Three days later, on 10 January, Caesar crossed the Rubicon, initiating the civil war. \nCaesar's rapid advance surprised Pompey, who withdrew from Italy to Greece. After entering Rome, instead of pursuing Pompey, Caesar marched to Spain to defeat the Pompeian loyalists there. Meanwhile, Antony, with the rank of propraetor, was installed as governor of Italy and commander of the army, stationed there while Marcus Aemilius Lepidus, one of Caesar's staff officers, ran the provisional administration of Rome itself. Though Antony was well liked by his soldiers, most other citizens despised him for his lack of interest in the hardships they faced from the civil war.\nBy the end of the year 49 BC, Caesar, already the ruler of Gaul, had captured Italy, Spain, Sicily, and Sardinia from his enemies. In early 48 BC, he prepared to sail with seven legions to Greece to face Pompey. Caesar had entrusted the defense of Illyricum to Gaius Antonius, Antony's younger brother, and Publius Cornelius Dolabella. Pompey's forces, however, defeated them and assumed control of the Adriatic Sea along with it. Additionally, the two legions they commanded defected to Pompey. Without their fleet, Caesar lacked the necessary transport ships to cross into Greece with his seven legions. Instead, he sailed with only two and placed Antony in command of the remaining five at Brundisium with instructions to join him as soon as he was able. In early 48 BC, Lucius Scribonius Libo was given command of Pompey's fleet, comprising some fifty galleys. Moving off to Brundisium, he blockaded Antony. Antony, however, managed to trick Libo into pursuing some decoy ships, causing Libo's squadron to be trapped and attacked. Most of Libo's fleet managed to escape, but several of his ships were trapped and captured. With Libo gone, Antony joined Caesar in Greece by March 48\u00a0BC.\nDuring the Greek campaign, Plutarch records that Antony was Caesar's top general, and second only to him in reputation. Antony joined Caesar at the western Balkan Peninsula and besieged Pompey's larger army at Dyrrhachium. With food sources running low, Caesar, in July, ordered a nocturnal assault on Pompey's camp, but Pompey's larger forces pushed back the assault. Though an indecisive result, the victory was a tactical win for Pompey. Pompey, however, did not order a counterassault on Caesar's camp, allowing Caesar to retreat unhindered. Caesar would later remark the civil war would have ended that day if only Pompey had attacked him. Caesar managed to retreat to Thessaly, with Pompey in pursuit.\nAssuming a defensive position at the plain of Pharsalus, Caesar's army prepared for pitched battle with Pompey's, which outnumbered his own two to one. At the Battle of Pharsalus on 9 August 48\u00a0BC, Caesar commanded the right wing opposite Pompey while Antony commanded the left. The resulting battle was a decisive victory for Caesar. Though the civil war did not end at Pharsalus, the battle marked the pinnacle of Caesar's power and effectively ended the Republic. The battle gave Caesar a much needed boost in legitimacy, as prior to the battle much of the Roman world outside Italy supported Pompey and the senators around him as the legitimate Roman government. After Pompey's defeat, most of the senate defected to Caesar, including many of the soldiers who had fought under Pompey. Pompey himself fled to Ptolemaic Egypt, but Pharaoh Ptolemy XIII Theos Philopator feared retribution from Caesar and had Pompey assassinated upon his arrival.\nGovernor of Italy.\nAfter the battle, Caesar was made dictator in absentia, and appointed Antony as master of horse (his lieutenant). Caesar without returning to Rome sailed for Egypt, where he took part in the Alexandrian war, deposing Ptolemy XIII in favour of Cleopatra, who became Caesar's mistress and bore him a son, Caesarion. Caesar's actions further strengthened Roman control over the already Roman-dominated kingdom.\nWhile Caesar was away in Egypt, Antony remained in Rome to govern Italy and restore order. Without Caesar to guide him, however, Antony quickly faced political difficulties and proved himself unpopular. The chief cause of his political challenges concerned debt forgiveness. One of the tribunes for 47\u00a0BC, Publius Cornelius Dolabella, proposed a law which would have canceled all outstanding debts. Antony opposed the law for political and personal reasons: he believed Caesar would not support such massive relief and suspected Dolabella had seduced his wife Antonia Hybrida. When Dolabella sought to enact the law by force and seized the Forum, Antony responded by unleashing his soldiers upon the assembled masses, killing hundreds. The resulting instability, especially among Caesar's veterans who would have benefited from the law, forced Caesar to return to Italy by October 47\u00a0BC.\nAntony's handling of the affair with Dolabella led to a cooling of his relationship with Caesar. Antony's violent reaction had caused Rome to fall into a state of anarchy. Caesar sought to mend relations with Dolabella; he was elected to a third term as consul for 46 BC, but proposed the senate should transfer the consulship to Dolabella. When Antony protested, Caesar was forced to withdraw the motion. Later, Caesar sought to exercise his prerogatives as dictator and directly proclaim Dolabella as consul instead. Antony again protested and, in his capacity as an augur, declared the omens were unfavorable and Caesar again backed down. Seeing the expediency of removing Dolabella from Rome, Caesar ultimately pardoned him for his role in the riots and took him as one of his generals in his campaign. Antony, however, was stripped of all official positions and received no appointments for the year 46 BC or 45 BC. Instead of Antony, Caesar appointed Marcus Aemilius Lepidus to be his consular colleague for 46 BC; Lepidus also replaced Antony as master of horse for Caesar's various dictatorships. While Caesar campaigned in North Africa, Antony remained in Rome as a mere private citizen. After returning victorious from North Africa, Caesar was appointed dictator for ten years and brought Cleopatra and their son to Rome. Antony again remained in Rome while Caesar, in 45 BC, sailed to Spain to defeat the final opposition to his rule; successful, the civil war ended.\nFollowing the scandal with Dolabella, Antony had divorced his second wife and quickly married Fulvia. Fulvia had previously been married to both Publius Clodius Pulcher and Gaius Scribonius Curio, having been a widow since Curio's death in the battle of the Bagradas in 49\u00a0BC. Though Antony and Fulvia were formally married in 47 BC, Cicero suggests the two had been in a relationship since at least 58 BC. The union produced two children: Marcus Antonius Antyllus (born 47) and Iullus Antonius (born 45).\nAssassination of Caesar.\nIdes of March.\nWhatever conflicts existed between himself and Caesar, Antony remained faithful to Caesar, ensuring their estrangement did not last long. Antony reunited with Caesar at Narbo in 45 BC with full reconciliation coming in 44 BC when Antony was elected consul alongside Caesar. Caesar planned a new invasion of Parthia and desired to leave Antony in Italy to govern Rome in his name. The reconciliation came soon after Antony is said to have rejected an offer from Gaius Trebonius, one of Caesar's generals, to join a conspiracy to assassinate Caesar. If such an offer was made, Antony made no mention of the matter to Caesar.\nSoon after they assumed office together, the Lupercalia was held on 15 February 44 BC. The festival was held in honor of Lupa, the she-wolf who suckled the infant orphans Romulus and Remus, the founders of Rome. The political atmosphere of Rome at the time of the festival was deeply divided. Caesar had by this point centralised almost all political powers into his own hands. He was granted further honors, including a form of semi-official cult, with Antony as his high priest. Additionally, on 1 January 44 BC, Caesar had been named \"dictator perpetuo\", removing any formal end to his autocratic powers. Caesar's political rivals feared this dictatorship with no end date would transform the Republic into a monarchy, abolishing the centuries of rule by the senate and people. During the festival's activities, Antony publicly offered Caesar a diadem, which Caesar threw off. When Antony placed the diadem in his lap, Caesar ordered the diadem to be placed in the Temple of Jupiter Optimus Maximus.\nWhen Antony offered Caesar the crown, there had been minor applause but mostly silence from the crowd. When Caesar refused it, however, the crowd was enthusiastic. The event presented a powerful message: a diadem was a symbol of a king. By refusing it, Caesar demonstrated he had no intention of making himself king. Antony's motive for such actions is not clear and it is unknown if he acted with Caesar's prior approval or on his own. While commonly described as an event that was \"scripted\", who was central to planning it is unclear. One argument is that Antony moved forward with the gesture on his own accord, possibly to embarrass or flatter Caesar. A later claim was that he was actually trying to convince Caesar not to go through with a kingship. By other accounts, it was Caesar's enemies who planned the incident as a way to frame him, with it being claimed two enemies of Caesar approached him to argue he should take the diadem. Another theory, one especially popular at the time, was that Caesar himself had orchestrated the event to test public support on him becoming king.\nA group of senators resolved to kill Caesar to prevent him from establishing a monarchy. Chief among them were Marcus Junius Brutus and Gaius Cassius Longinus. Although Cassius was \"the moving spirit\" in the plot, winning over the chief assassins to the cause of tyrannicide, Brutus, with his family's history of deposing Rome's kings, became their leader. Cicero, though not personally involved in the conspiracy, later claimed Antony's actions sealed Caesar's fate as such an obvious display of Caesar's preeminence motivated them to act. Originally, the conspirators had planned to eliminate not only Caesar but also many of his supporters, including Antony, but Brutus rejected the proposal, limiting the conspiracy to Caesar alone. With Caesar preparing to depart for Parthia in late March, the conspirators prepared to act when Caesar appeared for the senate meeting on the Ides of March (15 March).\nAntony also went with Caesar, but was waylaid at the door of the Theatre of Pompey by Trebonius and was distracted from aiding Caesar. According to the Greek historian Plutarch, as Caesar arrived at the senate, Lucius Tillius Cimber presented him with a petition to recall his exiled brother. The other conspirators crowded round to offer their support. Within moments, the entire group, including Brutus, was striking out at the dictator. Caesar attempted to get away, but, blinded by blood, he tripped and fell; the men continued stabbing him as he lay defenceless on the lower steps of the portico. According to Roman historian Eutropius, around 60 or more men participated in the assassination. Caesar was stabbed 23 times and died from the blood loss attributable to multiple stab wounds.\nLeader of the Caesarians.\nIn the turmoil surrounding the assassination, Antony escaped Rome dressed as a slave, fearing Caesar's death would be the start of a bloodbath among his supporters. When this did not occur, he soon returned to Rome. The conspirators, who styled themselves the \"liberatores\" (\"liberators\"), had barricaded themselves on the Capitoline hill. Although they believed Caesar's death would restore the Republic, Caesar had been immensely popular with the Roman middle and lower classes, who became enraged upon learning a small group of aristocrats had killed their champion.\nAntony, as the sole consul, soon took the initiative and seized the state treasury. Calpurnia, Caesar's widow, presented him with Caesar's personal papers and custody of his extensive property, clearly marking him as Caesar's heir and leader of the Caesarians. Caesar's master of horse Marcus Aemilius Lepidus marched over 6,000 troops into Rome on 16 March to restore order and intimidate the \"liberatores\". Lepidus wanted to storm the Capitol, but Antony preferred a peaceful solution as a majority of both the \"liberatores\" and Caesar's own supporters preferred a settlement over renewed civil war. On 17 March, at Antony's arrangement, the senate met to discuss a compromise, which, due to the presence of Caesar's veterans in the city, was quickly reached. Caesar's assassins would be pardoned of their crimes and, in return, all of Caesar's actions would be ratified. In particular, the offices assigned to both Brutus and Cassius by Caesar were likewise ratified. Antony also agreed to accept the appointment of his rival Dolabella as his consular colleague to replace Caesar. This compromise was a great success for Antony, who managed to simultaneously appease Caesar's veterans, reconcile the senate majority, and appear to the \"liberatores\" as their partner.\nOn 19 March, Caesar's will was opened and read. In it, Caesar posthumously adopted his great-nephew Gaius Octavius and named him his principal heir. Then only nineteen years old and stationed with Caesar's army in Macedonia, the youth became a member of Caesar's gens Julia with the name \"Gaius Julius Caesar\"; for clarity, it is historical convention to call him Octavian. Though not the chief beneficiary, Antony did receive some bequests.\nShortly after the compromise was reached, as a sign of good faith, Brutus, against the advice of Cassius and Cicero, agreed Caesar would be given a public funeral and his will would be validated. Caesar's funeral was held on 20 March. Antony, as Caesar's faithful lieutenant and incumbent consul, was chosen to preside over the ceremony and to recite a eulogy. In a demagogic speech, he enumerated the deeds of Caesar and, publicly reading his will, detailed the donations Caesar had left to the Roman people. Antony then seized the blood-stained toga from Caesar's body and presented it to the crowd. Worked into a fury by the bloody spectacle, the assembly turned into a riot. Several buildings in the Forum and some houses of the conspirators were burned to the ground. Panicked, many of the conspirators fled Italy. Under the pretext of not being able to guarantee their safety, Antony relieved Brutus and Cassius of their judicial duties in Rome and instead assigned them responsibility for procuring wheat for Rome from Sicily and Asia. Such an assignment, in addition to being unworthy of their rank, would have kept them far from Rome and shifted the balance towards Antony. Refusing such secondary duties, the two traveled to Greece instead. Additionally, Cleopatra left Rome to return to Egypt.\nDespite the provisions of Caesar's will, Antony proceeded to act as leader of the Caesarians, including appropriating for himself a portion of Caesar's fortune rightfully belonging to Octavian. Antony enacted the \"lex Antonia\", which formally abolished the dictatorship, in an attempt to consolidate his support among those who opposed Caesar's dictatorial rule. He also enacted a number of laws he purported to have found in Caesar's papers to ensure his popularity with Caesar's veterans, particularly by providing land grants to them. Lepidus, with Antony's support, was elected pontifex maximus, succeeding Caesar. To solidify the alliance between Antony and Lepidus, Antony's daughter Antonia Prima was engaged to Lepidus' homonymous son. Surrounding himself with a bodyguard of over six thousand of Caesar's veterans, Antony presented himself as Caesar's true successor, largely ignoring Octavian.\nFirst conflict with Octavian.\nOctavian arrived in Rome in May to claim his inheritance. Although Antony had amassed political support, Octavian still had opportunity to rival him as the leading member of the Caesarian faction. The senate increasingly viewed Antony as a new tyrant; Antony had also lost the support of many supporters of Caesar when he opposed the motion to elevate Caesar to divine status. When Antony refused to relinquish Caesar's vast fortune to him, Octavian borrowed heavily to fulfill the bequests in Caesar's will to the Roman people and to his veterans, as well as to establish his own bodyguard of veterans. This earned him the support of Caesarian sympathizers who hoped to use him as a means of eliminating Antony. The senate, and Cicero in particular, viewed Antony as the greater danger of the two. By summer 44\u00a0BC, Antony was in a difficult political position: he could either denounce the \"liberatores\" as murderers and alienate the senate or he could maintain his support for the compromise and risk betraying Caesar's legacy, strengthening Octavian's position. In either case, his situation as ruler of Rome would be weakened. Roman historian Cassius Dio later recorded that while Antony, as consul, maintained the advantage in the relationship, the general affection of the Roman people was shifting to Octavian due to his status as Caesar's son.\nSupporting the senatorial faction against Antony, Octavian, in September 44 BC, encouraged the eminent senator Marcus Tullius Cicero to attack Antony in a series of speeches portraying him as a threat to the republic. Risk of civil war between Antony and Octavian grew. Octavian continued to recruit Caesar's veterans to his side, away from Antony, with two of Antony's legions defecting in November 44 BC. At that time, Octavian, only a private citizen, lacked legal authority to command the Republic's armies, making his command illegal. With popular opinion in Rome turning against him and his consular term nearing its end, Antony attempted to secure a favorable military assignment to secure an army to protect himself. The senate, as was custom, assigned Antony and Dolabella the provinces of Macedonia and Syria, respectively, to govern in 43 BC after their consular terms expired. Antony, however, objected to the assignment, preferring to govern Cisalpine Gaul which was already controlled by Decimus Junius Brutus Albinus, one of Caesar's assassins. When Decimus refused to surrender his province, Antony marched north in December 44\u00a0BC with his remaining soldiers to take the province by force, besieging Decimus at Mutina. The senate, led by a fiery Cicero, denounced Antony's actions and declared him an enemy of the state.\nRatifying Octavian's extraordinary command on 1 January 43 BC, the senate dispatched him along with consuls Hirtius and Pansa to defeat Antony and his exhausted five legions. Antony's forces were defeated at the Battle of Mutina in April 43 BC, forcing Antony to retreat to Transalpine Gaul. Both consuls were killed, however, leaving Octavian in sole command of their armies, some eight legions.\nThe Second Triumvirate.\nForming the alliance.\nWith Antony defeated, the senate assigned command of the legions in northern Italy to Decimus. Sextus Pompey, son of Caesar's old rival Pompey Magnus, was given command of the Republic's fleet from his base in Sicily while Brutus and Cassius were granted the governorships of Macedonia and Syria respectively. These appointments attempted to renew the \"republican\" cause. However, the eight legions serving under Octavian, composed largely of Caesar's veterans, refused to follow one of Caesar's murderers, allowing Octavian to retain his command. Meanwhile, Antony recovered his position by joining forces with Marcus Aemilius Lepidus, who had been assigned the governorship of Transalpine Gaul and Nearer Spain. Antony sent Lepidus to Rome to broker a conciliation. Though he was an ardent Caesarian, Lepidus had maintained friendly relations with the senate and with Sextus Pompey. His legions, however, quickly joined Antony, giving him control over seventeen legions, the largest army in the West.\nBy mid-May, Octavian began secret negotiations to form an alliance with Antony to unify the Caesarians against the \"liberatores\". Remaining in Cisalpine Gaul, Octavian dispatched emissaries to Rome in July 43 BC demanding he be appointed consul to succeed Hirtius and Pansa and that the senate rescind the decree declaring Antony a public enemy. When the senate refused, Octavian marched on Rome with his eight legions and assumed control of the city in August 43\u00a0BC. Octavian had himself irregularly elected consul with a cousin, rewarded his soldiers, and then set about prosecuting Caesar's murderers. Under the \"lex Pedia\", all of the conspirators and Sextus Pompey were convicted \"in absentia\" and declared public enemies. Then, at the instigation of Lepidus, Octavian went to Cisalpine Gaul to meet Antony.\nIn November 43 BC, Octavian, Lepidus, and Antony met near Bononia. After two days of discussions, the group agreed to establish a three man dictatorship to govern the Republic for five years, known to modern historians as the Second Triumvirate. They shared military command of the republic's armies and provinces among themselves: Antony received Gaul, Lepidus Spain, and Octavian (as the junior partner) Africa. They jointly governed Italy. The triumvirate would have to conquer the rest of Rome's holdings; Brutus and Cassius held the Eastern Mediterranean, and Sextus Pompey held the Mediterranean islands. On 27 November 43 BC, the triumvirate was formally established by a new law, the \"lex Titia\". Octavian and Antony reinforced their alliance through Octavian's marriage to Antony's stepdaughter, Claudia.\nThe primary objective of the triumvirate was to avenge Caesar's death and to make war upon his murderers. Before marching against Brutus and Cassius in the East, the triumvirs issued proscriptions against their enemies in Rome. The dictator Lucius Cornelius Sulla had taken similar action to purge Rome of his opponents in 82\u00a0BC. The proscribed were named on public lists, stripped of citizenship, and outlawed. Their wealth and property were confiscated by the state, and rewards were offered to anyone who secured their arrest or death. With such encouragements, the proscription produced deadly results; two thousand equites were executed, and one third of the senate. Antony forced Octavian to give up Cicero, a personal enemy of Antony and friend of Octavian, who was then killed on 7 December. The confiscations helped replenish the state treasury, which had been depleted by Caesar's civil war the decade before; when this seemed insufficient to fund the imminent war against Brutus and Cassius, the triumvirs imposed new taxes, especially on the wealthy. By January 42\u00a0BC the proscription had ended; it had lasted two months, and though less bloody than Sulla's, it traumatized Roman society. A number of those named and outlawed had fled to either Sextus Pompey in Sicily or to the \"liberatores\" in the East. Senators who swore loyalty to the triumvirate were allowed to keep their positions; on 1 January 42 BC, the senate officially deified Caesar as \"The Divine Julius\", and confirmed Antony's position as his high priest.\nWar against the Liberators.\nDue to the infighting within the triumvirate during 43 BC, Brutus and Cassius had assumed control of much of Rome's eastern territories, and amassed a large army. Before the triumvirate could cross the Adriatic into Greece, the triumvirate had to address the threat posed by Sextus Pompey and his fleet. From his base in Sicily, Sextus raided the Italian coast and blockaded the triumvirs. Octavian's friend and admiral Quintus Salvidienus Rufus thwarted an attack by Sextus against the southern Italian mainland at Rhegium, but Salvidienus was then defeated in the resulting naval battle because of the inexperience of his crews. Only when Antony arrived with his fleet was the blockade broken. Though the blockade was defeated, control of Sicily remained in Sextus' hand, but the defeat of the \"liberatores\" was the triumvirate's first priority.\nIn the summer of 42 BC, Octavian and Antony sailed for Macedonia to face the \"liberatores\" with nineteen legions, the vast majority of their army (approximately 100,000 regular infantry plus supporting cavalry and irregular auxiliary units), leaving Rome under the administration of Lepidus. Likewise, the army of the \"liberatores\" also commanded an army of nineteen legions; their legions, however, were not at full strength while the legions of Antony and Octavian were. While the triumvirs commanded a larger number of infantry, the Liberators commanded a larger cavalry contingent. The \"liberatores\", who controlled Macedonia, did not wish to engage in a decisive battle, but rather to attain a good defensive position and then use their naval superiority to block the Triumvirs' communications with their supply base in Italy. They had spent the previous months plundering Greek cities to swell their war-chest and had gathered in Thrace with the Roman legions from the Eastern provinces and levies from Rome's client kingdoms.\nBrutus and Cassius held a position on the high ground along both sides of the \"via Egnatia\" west of the city of Philippi. The south position was anchored to a supposedly impassable marsh, while the north was bordered by impervious hills. They had plenty of time to fortify their position with a rampart and a ditch. Brutus put his camp on the north while Cassius occupied the south of the via Egnatia. Antony arrived shortly and positioned his army on the south of the via Egnatia, while Octavian put his legions north of the road. Antony offered battle several times, but the \"liberatores\" were not lured to leave their defensive stand. Thus, Antony tried to secretly outflank the Brutus and Cassius' position through the marshes in the south. This provoked a pitched battle on 3 October 42\u00a0BC. Antony commanded the triumvirate's army due to Octavian's sickness on the day, with Antony directly controlling the right flank opposite Cassius. Because of his health, Octavian remained in camp while his lieutenants assumed a position on the left flank opposite Brutus. In the resulting first battle of Philippi, Antony defeated Cassius and captured his camp while Brutus overran Octavian's troops and penetrated into the Triumvirs' camp but was unable to capture the sick Octavian. The battle was a tactical draw, but due to poor communications Cassius believed the battle was a complete defeat and committed suicide to prevent being captured.\nBrutus assumed sole command of the army and preferred a war of attrition over open conflict. His officers, however, were dissatisfied with these defensive tactics and his Caesarian veterans threatened to defect, forcing Brutus to give battle at the second battle of Philippi on 23 October. While the battle was initially evenly matched, Antony's leadership routed Brutus' forces. Brutus committed suicide the day after the defeat and the remainder of his army swore allegiance to the Triumvirate. Over fifty thousand Romans died in the two battles. While Antony treated the losers mildly, Octavian dealt cruelly with his prisoners and even beheaded Brutus' corpse.\nThe battles of Philippi ended the civil war in favor of the triumvirs. With the defeat of Brutus and Cassius, only Sextus Pompey and his fleet remained to challenge the triumvirate's control of the Roman world.\nMaster of the Roman East.\nDivision of the republic.\nThe victory at Philippi left the members of the triumvirate as masters of the republic, save Sextus Pompey in Sicily. Upon returning to Rome, the triumvirate repartitioned rule of Rome's provinces among themselves, with Antony as the clear senior partner. He received the largest distribution, governing all of the Eastern provinces while retaining Gaul in the West. Octavian's position improved, as he received Spain, which was taken from Lepidus. Lepidus was then reduced to holding only Africa, and he assumed a clearly tertiary role in the triumvirate. Rule over Italy remained undivided, but Octavian was assigned the difficult and unpopular task of demobilizing their veterans and providing them with land distributions in Italy. Antony assumed direct control of the East while he installed one of his lieutenants as the ruler of Gaul. During his absence, several of his supporters held key positions in Rome to protect his interests there.\nThe East was in need of reorganization. In addition, Rome contended with the Parthian Empire for dominance of the Near East. The Parthian threat to the triumvirate's rule was urgent due to the fact that the Parthians supported the \"liberatores\" in the recent civil war, aid which included the supply of troops at Philippi. As ruler of the East, Antony also assumed responsibility for overseeing Caesar's planned invasion of Parthia to avenge the defeat of Marcus Licinius Crassus at the Battle of Carrhae in 53 BC.\nIn 42 BC, the Roman East was composed of several directly controlled provinces and client kingdoms. The provinces included Macedonia, Asia, Bithynia, Cilicia, Cyprus, Syria, and Cyrenaica. Approximately half of the eastern territory was controlled by Rome's client kingdoms, nominally independent kingdoms subject to Roman direction. These kingdoms included:\nActivities in the East.\nAntony spent the winter of 42 BC in Athens, where he ruled generously towards the Greek cities. A proclaimed \"philhellene\" (\"Friend of all things Greek\"), Antony supported Greek culture to win the loyalty of the inhabitants of the Greek East. He attended religious festivals and ceremonies, including initiation into the Eleusinian Mysteries, a secret cult dedicated to the worship of the goddesses Demeter and Persephone. Beginning in 41 BC, he traveled across the Aegean Sea to Anatolia, leaving his friend Lucius Marcius Censorius as governor of Macedonia and Achaea. Upon his arrival in Ephesus in Asia, Antony was worshiped as the god Dionysus born anew. He demanded heavy taxes from the Hellenic cities in return for his pro-Greek culture policies, but exempted those cities which had remained loyal to Caesar during the civil war and compensated those cities which had suffered under Caesar's assassins, including Rhodes, Lycia, and Tarsus. He granted pardons to all Roman nobles living in the East who had supported Pompey, except for Caesar's assassins.\nRuling from Ephesus, Antony consolidated Rome's hegemony in the East, receiving envoys from Rome's client kingdoms and intervening in their dynastic affairs, extracting enormous financial \"gifts\" from them in the process. Though King Deiotarus of Galatia supported Brutus and Cassius following Caesar's assassination, Antony allowed him to retain his position. He also confirmed Ariarathes X as king of Cappadocia after the execution of his brother Ariobarzanes III of Cappadocia by Cassius before the Battle of Philippi. In Hasmonean Judea, several Israelite delegations complained to Antony of the harsh rule of Phasael and Herod, the sons of Rome's assassinated chief minister in the territory of Judaea, who was an Edomite called Antipater the Idumaean. After Herod offered him a large financial gift, Antony confirmed the brothers in their positions. Subsequently, influenced by the beauty and charms of Glaphyra, the widow of Archela\u00fcs (formerly the high priest of Comana), Antony deposed Ariarathes X, and appointed Glaphyra's son, Archela\u00fcs, to rule Cappadocia.\nIn October 41, Antony requested Rome's chief eastern vassal, the queen of Ptolemaic Egypt Cleopatra, meet him at Tarsus in Cilicia. Antony had first met a young Cleopatra while campaigning in Egypt in 55 BC and again in 48 BC when Caesar had backed her as queen of Egypt over the claims of her half-sister Arsinoe. Cleopatra would bear Caesar a son, Caesarion, in 47 BC and the two were living in Rome as Caesar's guests until his assassination in 44 BC. After Caesar's assassination, Cleopatra and Caesarion returned to Egypt, where she named the child as her co-ruler. In 42 BC, the Triumvirate, in recognition for Cleopatra's help towards Publius Cornelius Dolabella in opposition to the Liberators, granted official recognition to Caesarion's position as king of Egypt. Arriving in Tarsus aboard her magnificent ship, Cleopatra invited Antony to a grand banquet to solidify their alliance. As the most powerful of Rome's eastern vassals, Egypt was indispensable in Rome's planned military invasion of the Parthian Empire. At Cleopatra's request, Antony ordered the execution of Arsinoe, who, though marched in Caesar's triumphal parade in 46 BC, had been granted sanctuary at the temple of Artemis in Ephesus. Antony and Cleopatra then spent the winter of 41 BC together in Alexandria. Cleopatra bore Antony twin children, Alexander Helios and Cleopatra Selene II, in 40 BC, and a third, Ptolemy Philadelphus, in 36 BC. Antony also granted formal control over Cyprus, which had been under Egyptian control since 47 BC during the turmoil of Caesar's civil war, to Cleopatra in 40 BC as a gift for her loyalty to Rome.\nAntony, in his first months in the East, raised money, reorganized his troops, and secured the alliance of Rome's client kingdoms. He also promoted himself as Hellenistic ruler, which won him the affection of the Greek peoples of the East but also made him the target of Octavian's propaganda in Rome. According to some ancient authors, Antony led a carefree life of luxury in Alexandria. Upon learning the Parthian Empire had invaded Rome's territory in early 40 BC, Antony left Egypt for Syria to confront the invasion. However, after a short stay in Tyre, he was forced to sail with his army to Italy to confront Octavian due to Octavian's war against Antony's wife and brother.\nFulvia's civil war.\nFollowing the defeat of Brutus and Cassius, while Antony was stationed in the East, Octavian had authority over the West. Octavian's chief responsibility was distributing land to tens of thousands of Caesar's veterans who had fought for the Triumvirate. Additionally, tens of thousands of veterans who had fought for the Republican cause in the war also required land grants. This was necessary to ensure they would not support a political opponent of the triumvirate. However, the triumvirs did not possess sufficient state-controlled land to allot to the veterans. This left Octavian with two options: alienating many Roman citizens by confiscating their land, or alienating many Roman soldiers who might back a military rebellion against the triumvirate's rule. Octavian chose the former. As many as eighteen Roman towns through Italy were affected by the confiscations of 41 BC, with entire populations driven out.\nLed by Fulvia, the wife of Antony, the senators grew hostile towards Octavian over the issue of the land confiscations. According to the ancient historian Cassius Dio, Fulvia was the most powerful woman in Rome at the time. According to Dio, while Publius Servilius Vatia and Lucius Antonius were the consuls for the year 41 BC, real power was vested in Fulvia. As the mother-in-law of Octavian and the wife of Antony, no action was taken by the senate without her support. Fearing Octavian's land grants would cause the loyalty of the Caesarian veterans to shift away from Antony, Fulvia traveled constantly with her children to the new veteran settlements in order to remind the veterans of their debt to Antony. Fulvia also attempted to delay the land settlements until Antony returned to Rome, so that he could share credit for the settlements. With the help of Antony's brother, the consul of 41\u00a0BC Lucius Antonius, Fulvia encouraged the senate to oppose Octavian's land policies.\nThe conflict between Octavian and Fulvia caused great political and social unrest throughout Italy. Tensions escalated into open war, however, when Octavian divorced Claudia, Fulvia's daughter from her first husband Publius Clodius Pulcher. Outraged, Fulvia, supported by Lucius, raised an army to fight for Antony's rights against Octavian. According to the ancient historian Appian, Fulvia's chief reason for the war was her jealousy of Antony's affairs with Cleopatra in Egypt and desire to draw Antony back to Rome. Lucius and Fulvia took a political and martial gamble in opposing Octavian and Lepidus, however, as the Roman army still depended on the triumvirs for their salaries. Lucius and Fulvia, supported by their army, marched on Rome and promised the people an end to the triumvirate in favor of Antony's sole rule. However, when Octavian returned to the city with his army, the pair were forced to retreat to Perusia in Etruria. Octavian placed the city under siege while Lucius waited for Antony's legions in Gaul to come to his aid. Away in the East and embarrassed by Fulvia's actions, Antony gave no instructions to his legions. Without reinforcements, Lucius and Fulvia were forced to surrender in February 40 BC. While Octavian pardoned Lucius for his role in the war and even granted him command in Spain as his chief lieutenant there, Fulvia was forced to flee to Greece with her children. With the war over, Octavian was left in sole control over Italy. When Antony's governor of Gaul died, Octavian took over his legions there, further strengthening his control over the West.\nDespite the Parthian Empire's invasion of Rome's eastern territories, Fulvia's civil war forced Antony to leave the East and return to Rome in order to secure his position. Meeting her in Athens, Antony rebuked Fulvia for her actions before sailing on to Italy with his army to face Octavian, laying siege to Brundisium. This new conflict proved untenable for both Octavian and Antony, however. Their centurions, who had become important figures politically, refused to fight due to their shared service under Caesar. The legions under their command followed suit. Meanwhile, in Sicyon, Fulvia died of a sudden and unknown illness. Fulvia's death and the mutiny of their soldiers allowed the triumvirs to effect a reconciliation through a new power-sharing agreement in September 40 BC. The Roman world was redivided, with Antony receiving the Eastern provinces, Octavian the Western provinces, and Lepidus retained his junior position as governor of Africa. This agreement, known as the \"Treaty of Brundisium\", reinforced the triumvirate and allowed Antony to begin preparing for Caesar's long-awaited campaign against the Parthian Empire. As a symbol of their renewed alliance, Antony married Octavia, Octavian's sister, in October 40 BC.\nAntony's Parthian War.\nRoman\u2013Parthian relations.\nThe rise of the Parthian Empire in the 3rd century BC and Rome's expansion into the Eastern Mediterranean during the 2nd century BC brought the two powers into direct contact, causing centuries of tumultuous and strained relations. Though periods of peace developed cultural and commercial exchanges, war was a constant threat. Influence over the buffer state of the Kingdom of Armenia, located to the north-east of Roman Syria, was often a central issue in the Roman-Parthian conflict. In 95 BC, Tigranes the Great, a Parthian ally, became king. Tigranes would later aid Mithradates of Pontus against Rome before being decisively defeated by Pompey in 66 BC. Thereafter, with his son Artavasdes in Rome as a hostage, Tigranes would rule Armenia as an ally of Rome until his death in 55 BC. Rome then released Artavasdes, who succeeded his father as king.\nIn 53 BC, Rome's governor of Syria, Marcus Licinius Crassus, led an expedition across the Euphrates River into Parthian territory to confront the Parthian Shah Orodes II. Artavasdes II offered Crassus the aid of nearly forty thousand troops to assist his Parthian expedition on the condition that Crassus invade through Armenia as the safer route. Crassus refused, choosing instead the more direct route by crossing the Euphrates directly into desert Parthian territory. Crassus' actions proved disastrous as his army was defeated at the Battle of Carrhae by a numerically inferior Parthian force. Crassus' defeat forced Armenia to shift its loyalty to Parthia, with Artavasdes II's sister marrying Orodes' son and heir Pacorus.\nIn early 44 BC, Julius Caesar announced his intentions to invade Parthia and restore Roman power in the East. His reasons were to punish the Parthians for assisting Pompey in the recent civil war, to avenge Crassus' defeat at Carrhae, and especially to match the glory of Alexander the Great for himself. Before Caesar could launch his campaign, however, he was assassinated. As part of the compromise between Antony and the Republicans to restore order following Caesar's murder, Publius Cornelius Dolabella was assigned the governorship of Syria and command over Caesar's planned Parthian campaign. The compromise did not hold, however, and the republicans were forced to flee to the East. The republicans directed Quintus Labienus to attract the Parthians to their side in the resulting war against Antony and Octavian. After the \"liberatores\" were defeated at the Battle of Philippi, Labienus joined the Parthians. Despite Rome's internal turmoil during the time, the Parthians did not immediately benefit from the power vacuum in the East due to Orodes II's reluctance despite Labienus' urgings to the contrary.\nIn the summer of 41 BC, Antony, to reassert Roman power in the East, conquered Palmyra on the Roman-Parthian border. Antony then spent the winter of 41 BC in Alexandria with Cleopatra, leaving only two legions to defend the Syrian border against Parthian incursions. The legions, however, were composed of former Republican troops and Labienus convinced Orodes II to invade.\nParthian Invasion.\nA Parthian army, led by Orodes II's eldest son Pacorus, invaded Syria in early 40 BC. Labienus, the Republican ally of Brutus and Cassius, accompanied him to advise him and to rally the former Republican soldiers stationed in Syria to the Parthian cause. Labienus recruited many of the former Republican soldiers to the Parthian campaign in opposition to Antony. The joint Parthian\u2013Roman force, after initial success in Syria, separated to lead their offensive in two directions: Pacorus marched south toward Hasmonean Judea while Labienus crossed the Taurus Mountains to the north into Cilicia. Labienus conquered southern Anatolia with little resistance. The Roman governor of Asia, Lucius Munatius Plancus, a partisan of Antony, was forced to flee his province, allowing Labienus to recruit the Roman soldiers stationed there. For his part, Pacorus advanced south to Phoenicia and Palestine. In Hasmonean Judea, the exiled prince Antigonus allied himself with the Parthians. When his brother, Rome's client king Hyrcanus II, refused to accept Parthian domination, he was deposed in favor of Antigonus as Parthia's client king in Judea. Pacorus' conquest had captured much of the Syrian and Palestinian interior, with much of the Phoenician coast occupied as well. The city of Tyre remained the last major Roman outpost in the region.\nAntony, then in Egypt with Cleopatra, did not respond immediately to the Parthian invasion. Though he left Alexandria for Tyre in early 40 BC, when he learned of the civil war between his wife and Octavian, he was forced to return to Italy with his army to secure his position in Rome rather than defeat the Parthians. Instead, Antony dispatched Publius Ventidius Bassus to check the Parthian advance. Arriving in the East in spring 39 BC, Ventidius surprised Labienus near the Taurus Mountains, claiming victory at the Cilician Gates. Ventidius ordered Labienus executed as a traitor and the formerly rebellious Roman soldiers under his command were reincorporated under Antony's control. He then met a Parthian army at the border between Cilicia and Syria, defeating it and killing a large portion of the Parthian soldiers at the Amanus Pass. Ventidius' actions temporarily halted the Parthian advance and restored Roman authority in the East, forcing Pacorus to abandon his conquests and return to Parthia.\nIn the spring of 38 BC, the Parthians resumed their offensive with Pacorus leading an army across the Euphrates. Ventidius, in order to gain time, leaked disinformation to Pacorus implying that he should cross the Euphrates River at their usual ford. Pacorus did not trust this information and decided to cross the river much farther downstream; this was what Ventidius hoped would occur and gave him time to get his forces ready. The Parthians faced no opposition and proceeded to the town of Gindarus in Cyrrhestica where Ventidius' army was waiting. At the Battle of Cyrrhestica, Ventidius inflicted an overwhelming defeat against the Parthians which resulted in the death of Pacorus. Overall, the Roman army had achieved a complete victory with Ventidius' three successive victories forcing the Parthians back across the Euphrates. Pacorus' death threw the Parthian Empire into chaos. Shah Orodes II, overwhelmed by the grief of his son's death, appointed his younger son Phraates IV as his successor. However, Phraates IV assassinated Orodes II in late 38 BC, succeeding him on the throne.\nVentidius feared Antony's wrath if he invaded Parthian territory, thereby stealing his glory; so instead he attacked and subdued the eastern kingdoms, which had revolted against Roman control following the disastrous defeat of Crassus at Carrhae. One such rebel was King Antiochus of Commagene, whom he besieged in Samosata. Antiochus tried to make peace with Ventidius, but Ventidius told him to approach Antony directly. After peace was concluded, Antony sent Ventidius back to Rome where he celebrated a triumph, the first Roman to triumph over the Parthians.\nConflict with Sextus Pompey.\nWhile Antony and the other triumvirs ratified the Treaty of Brundisium to redivide the Roman world among themselves, the rebel Sextus Pompey, the son of Caesar's rival Pompey the Great, was largely ignored. From his stronghold on Sicily, he continued his piratical activities across Italy and blocked the shipment of grain to Rome. The lack of food in Rome undermined the triumvirate's political support. This pressure forced the triumvirs to meet with Sextus in early 39 BC.\nWhile Octavian wanted an end to the ongoing blockade of Italy, Antony sought peace in the West in order to make the Triumvirate's legions available for his service in his planned campaign against the Parthians. Though the Triumvirs rejected Sextus' initial request to replace Lepidus as the third man in the triumvirate, they did grant other concessions. Under the terms of the Treaty of Misenum, Sextus was allowed to retain control over Sicily and Sardinia, with the provinces of Corsica and Greece being added to his territory. He was also promised a future position with the Priestly College of Augurs and the consulship for 35 BC. In exchange, Sextus agreed to end his naval blockade of Italy, supply Rome with grain, and halt his piracy of Roman merchant ships. However, the most important provision of the Treaty was the end of the proscription the trimumvirate had begun in late 43 BC. Many of the proscribed senators, rather than face death, fled to Sicily seeking Sextus' protection. With the exception of those responsible for Caesar's assassination, all those proscribed were allowed to return to Rome and promised compensation. This caused Sextus to lose many valuable allies as the formerly exiled senators gradually aligned themselves with either Octavian or Antony. To secure the peace, Octavian betrothed Marcus Claudius Marcellus, Octavian's three-year-old nephew and Antony's stepson, to Sextus' daughter Pompeia. With peace in the West secured, Antony planned to retaliate against Parthia. Under an agreement with Octavian, Antony would be supplied with extra troops for his campaign. With this military purpose on his mind, Antony sailed to Greece with Octavia, where he behaved in a most extravagant manner, assuming the attributes of the Greek god Dionysus in 39 BC.\nThe peace with Sextus was short-lived, however. When Sextus demanded control over Greece as the agreement provided, Antony demanded the province's tax revenues be to fund the Parthian campaign. Sextus refused. Meanwhile, Sextus' admiral Menas betrayed him, shifting his loyalty to Octavian and thereby granting him control of Corsica, Sardinia, three of Sextus' legions, and a larger naval force. These actions worked to renew Sextus' blockade of Italy, preventing Octavian from sending the promised troops to Antony for the Parthian campaign. This new delay caused Antony to quarrel with Octavian, forcing Octavia to mediate a truce between them. Under the Treaty of Tarentum, Antony provided a large naval force for Octavian's use against Sextus while Octavian promised to raise new legions for Antony to support his invasion of Parthia. As the term of the Triumvirate was set to expire at the end of 38\u00a0BC, the two unilaterally extended their term of office another five years until 33\u00a0BC without seeking approval of the senate or the assemblies. To seal the Treaty, Antony's elder son Marcus Antonius Antyllus, then only six years old, was betrothed to Octavian's only daughter Julia, then only an infant. With the Treaty signed, Antony returned to the East, leaving Octavia in Italy.\nReconquest of Judea.\nWith Publius Ventidius Bassus returned to Rome in triumph for his defensive campaign against the Parthians, Antony appointed Gaius Sosius as the new governor of Syria and Cilicia in early 38 BC. Antony, still in the West negotiating with Octavian, ordered Sosius to depose Antigonus, who had been installed in the recent Parthian invasion as the ruler of Hasmonean Judea, and to make Herod the new Roman client king in the region. Years before in 40 BC, the Roman senate had proclaimed Herod \"King of the Jews\" because Herod had been a loyal supporter of Hyrcanus II, Rome's previous client king before the Parthian invasion, and was from a family with long standing connections to Rome. The Romans hoped to use Herod as a bulwark against the Parthians in the coming campaign.\nAdvancing south, Sosius captured the island-city of Aradus on the coast of Phoenicia by the end of 38 BC. The following year, the Romans besieged Jerusalem. After a forty-day siege, the Roman soldiers stormed the city and, despite Herod's pleas for restraint, acted without mercy, pillaging and killing all in their path, prompting Herod to complain to Antony. Herod finally resorted to bribing Sosius and his troops in order that they would not leave him \"king of a desert\". Antigonus was forced to surrender to Sosius, and was sent to Antony for the triumphal procession in Rome. Herod, however, fearing that Antigonus would win backing in Rome, bribed Antony to execute Antigonus. Antony, who recognized that Antigonus would remain a permanent threat to Herod, ordered him beheaded in Antioch. Now secure on his throne, Herod would rule the Herodian Kingdom until his death in 4 BC, and would be an ever-faithful client king of Rome.\nParthian Campaign.\nWith the triumvirate renewed in 38 BC, Antony returned to Athens in the winter with his new wife Octavia, the sister of Octavian. With the assassination of the Parthian king Orodes II by his son Phraates IV, who then seized the Parthian throne, in late 38 BC, Antony prepared to invade Parthia himself.Antony, however, realized Octavian had no intention of sending him the additional legions he had promised under the Treaty of Tarentum. To supplement his own armies, Antony instead looked to Rome's principal vassal in the East: his lover Cleopatra. In addition to significant financial resources, Cleopatra's backing of his Parthian campaign allowed Antony to amass the largest army Rome had ever assembled in the East. Wintering in Antioch during 37, Antony's combined Roman\u2013Egyptian army numbered some 100,000, including 60,000 soldiers from sixteen legions, 10,000 cavalry from Spain and Gaul, plus an additional 30,000 auxiliaries. The size of his army indicated Antony's intention to conquer Parthia, or at least receive its submission by capturing the Parthian capital of Ecbatana. Antony's rear was protected by Rome's client kingdoms in Anatolia, Syria, and Judea, while the client kingdoms of Cappadocia, Pontus, and Commagene would provide supplies along the march.\nAntony's first target for his invasion was the Kingdom of Armenia. Ruled by King Artavasdes II of Armenia, Armenia had been an ally of Rome since the defeat of Tigranes the Great by Pompey the Great in 66 BC during the Third Mithridatic War. However, following Marcus Licinius Crassus's defeat at the Battle of Carrhae in 53 BC, Armenia was forced into an alliance with Parthia due to Rome's weakened position in the East. Antony dispatched Publius Canidius Crassus to Armenia, receiving Artavasdes II's surrender without opposition. Canidius then led an invasion into the South Caucasus, subduing Iberia. There, Canidius forced the Iberian King Pharnavaz II into an alliance against Zober, king of neighboring Albania, subduing the kingdom and reducing it to a Roman protectorate.\nWith Armenia and the Caucasus secured, Antony marched south, crossing into the Parthian province of Media Atropatene. Though Antony desired a pitched battle, the Parthians would not engage, allowing Antony to march deep into Parthian territory by mid-August of 36 BC. This forced Antony to leave his logistics train in the care of two legions (approximately 10,000 soldiers), which was then attacked and completely destroyed by the Parthian army before Antony could rescue them. Though the Armenian King Artavasdes II and his cavalry were present during the massacre, they did not intervene. Despite the ambush, Antony continued the campaign. However, Antony was soon forced to retreat in mid-October after a failed two-month siege of the provincial capital.\nThe retreat soon proved a disaster as Antony's demoralized army faced increasing supply difficulties in the mountainous terrain during winter while constantly being harassed by the Parthian army. According to Plutarch, eighteen battles were fought between the retreating Romans and the Parthians during the month-long march back to Armenia, with approximately 20,000 infantry and 4,000 cavalry dying during the retreat alone. Once in Armenia, Antony quickly marched back to Syria to protect his interests there by late 36 BC, losing an additional 8,000 soldiers along the way. In all, two-fifths of his original army (some 80,000 men) had died during his failed campaign. The narration of Strabo and Plutarch blames the Armenian king for the defeat, but modern sources note Antony's poor management.\nAntony and Cleopatra.\nMeanwhile, in Rome, the triumvirate was no more. Octavian forced Lepidus to resign after the older triumvir attempted to take control of Sicily after the defeat of Sextus. Now in sole power, Octavian was occupied in wooing the aristocracy to his side. He married Livia and started to attack Antony. He argued that Antony was a man of low morals to have left his faithful wife abandoned in Rome with the children to be with the promiscuous queen of Egypt. Several times Antony was summoned to Rome, but remained in Alexandria with Cleopatra.\nAgain with Egyptian money, Antony invaded Armenia, this time successfully. In the return, a mock Roman triumph was celebrated in the streets of Alexandria. The parade through the city was a pastiche of Rome's most important military celebration. For the finale, the whole city was summoned to hear a very important political statement. Surrounded by Cleopatra and her children, Antony ended his alliance with Octavian.\nHe distributed kingdoms among his children: Alexander Helios was named king of Armenia, Media and Parthia (territories which were not for the most part under the control of Rome), his twin Cleopatra Selene got Cyrenaica and Libya, and the young Ptolemy Philadelphus was awarded Syria and Cilicia. As for Cleopatra, she was proclaimed Queen of Kings and Queen of Egypt, to rule with Caesarion (Ptolemy XV Caesar, son of Cleopatra by Julius Caesar), King of Kings and King of Egypt. Most important of all, Caesarion was declared legitimate son and heir of Caesar. These proclamations were known as the \"Donations of Alexandria\" and caused a fatal breach in Antony's relations with Rome.\nWhile the distribution of nations among Cleopatra's children was hardly a conciliatory gesture, it did not pose an immediate threat to Octavian's political position. Far more dangerous was the acknowledgment of Caesarion as legitimate and heir to Caesar's name. Octavian's base of power was his link with Caesar through adoption, which granted him much-needed popularity and loyalty of the legions. To see this convenient situation attacked by a child borne by the richest woman in the world was something Octavian could not accept. The triumvirate expired on the last day of 33\u00a0BC and was not renewed. Another civil war was beginning.\nDuring 33 and 32 BC, a propaganda war was fought in the political arena of Rome, with accusations flying between sides. Antony (in Egypt) divorced Octavia and accused Octavian of being a social upstart, of usurping power, and of forging the adoption papers by Caesar. Octavian responded with treason charges: of illegally keeping provinces that should be given to other men by lots, as was Rome's tradition, and of starting wars against foreign nations (Armenia and Parthia) without the consent of the senate.\nAntony was also held responsible for Sextus Pompey's execution without a trial. In 32 BC, the senate deprived him of his powers and declared war against Cleopatra \u2013 not Antony, because Octavian had no wish to advertise his role in perpetuating Rome's internecine bloodshed. Octavian and other Roman Senators believed that turning the hostilities towards Cleopatra as the villain would gather the most support from Romans for war. Contributing to this would be the years of propaganda against Cleopatra published by the Romans, dating back to the days of Julius Caesar. Octavian, informed of Antony's will by two Antonian defectors, sacrilegiously raided the Temple of Vesta to secure it. The will, which some modern scholars have suggested was partially forged \u2013 largely on legal grounds \u2013 is never so described in the ancient sources. Octavian's publication of the will's provisions, which named Antony and Cleopatra's children as heirs and directed his burial in Alexandria, was used as a political weapon in Rome to declare war against Cleopatra and Egypt as a whole. This was the perfect summation of their attacks on the woman Antony loved and they believed threatened their republic. Both consuls, Gnaeus Domitius Ahenobarbus and Gaius Sosius (both Antony's men), and a third of the senate abandoned Rome to meet Antony and Cleopatra in Greece.\nIn 31\u00a0BC, the war started. Octavian's general Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa captured the Greek city and naval port of Methone, loyal to Antony. The enormous popularity of Octavian with the legions secured the defection of the provinces of Cyrenaica and Greece to his side. On 2 September, the naval Battle of Actium took place. Antony and Cleopatra's navy was overwhelmed, and they were forced to escape to Egypt with 60 ships.\nDeath.\nOctavian, now close to absolute power, invaded Egypt with Agrippa in August of 30 BC. With no other refuge to escape to, Antony stabbed himself with his sword in the mistaken belief that Cleopatra had already committed suicide. When he found out that Cleopatra was still alive, his friends brought him to Cleopatra's monument in which she was hiding, and he died in her arms.\nCleopatra was allowed to conduct Antony's burial rites after she had been captured by Octavian. Realising that she was destined for Octavian's triumph in Rome, she made several attempts to take her life and finally succeeded in mid-August. Octavian had Caesarion and Antyllus killed, but he spared Iullus as well as Antony's children by Cleopatra, who were paraded through the streets of Rome.\nAftermath and legacy.\nCicero's son, Cicero Minor, announced Antony's death to the senate. Antony's honours were revoked and his statues removed, but he was not subject to a complete \"damnatio memoriae\". Cicero's son also made a decree that no member of the Antonii would ever bear the name Marcus again. \"In this way Heaven entrusted the family of Cicero the final acts in the punishment of Antony.\"\nWhen Antony died, Octavian became uncontested ruler of Rome. In the following years, Octavian, who was known as Augustus after 27\u00a0BC, managed to accumulate in his person all administrative, political, and military offices. When Augustus died in AD 14, his political powers passed to his adopted son Tiberius; the Roman Empire had begun.\nThe rise of Caesar and the subsequent civil war between his two most powerful adherents effectively ended the credibility of the Roman oligarchy as a governing power and ensured that all future power struggles would centre upon which one individual would achieve supreme control of the government, eliminating the senate and the former magisterial structure as important foci of power in these conflicts. Thus, in history, Antony appears as one of Caesar's main adherents, he and Octavian being the two men around whom power coalesced following the assassination of Caesar, and finally as one of the three men chiefly responsible for the demise of the republic.\nMarriages and issue.\nAntony had many mistresses (including Cytheris) and was married in succession to Fadia, Antonia, Fulvia, Octavia and Cleopatra. He left a number of children. Through his daughters by Octavia, he would be ancestor to the Roman emperors Caligula, Claudius and Nero.\nDescendants.\nThrough his daughters by Octavia, he was the paternal great grandfather of Roman emperor Caligula, the maternal grandfather of emperor Claudius, and both maternal great-great-grandfather and paternal great-great uncle of the emperor Nero of the Julio-Claudian dynasty. Through his eldest daughter, he was ancestor to the long line of kings and co-rulers of the Bosporan Kingdom, the longest-living Roman client kingdom, as well as the rulers and royalty of several other Roman client states. Through his daughter by Cleopatra, Antony was ancestor to the royal family of Mauretania, another Roman client kingdom, while through his sole surviving son Iullus, he was ancestor to several famous Roman statesmen.\n1.

They compete in the Premier League, the top tier of English football. Nicknamed the Red Devils, they were founded as Newton Heath LYR Football Club in 1878, but changed their name to Manchester United in 1902. After a spell playing in Clayton, Manchester, the club moved to their current stadium, Old Trafford, in 1910.\nDomestically, Manchester United have won a joint-record twenty top-flight league titles, thirteen FA Cups, six League Cups and a record twenty-one FA Community Shields. Additionally, in international football, they have won the European Cup/UEFA Champions League three times, and the UEFA Europa League, the UEFA Cup Winners' Cup, the UEFA Super Cup, the Intercontinental Cup and the FIFA Club World Cup once each. Appointed as manager in 1945, Matt Busby built a team with an average age of just 22 nicknamed the Busby Babes that won successive league titles in the 1950s and became the first English club to compete in the European Cup. Eight players were killed in the Munich air disaster, but Busby rebuilt the team around star players George Best, Denis Law and Bobby Charlton \u2013 known as the United Trinity. They won two more league titles before becoming the first English club to win the European Cup in 1968.\nAfter Busby's retirement, Manchester United were unable to produce sustained success until the arrival of Alex Ferguson, who became the club's longest-serving and most successful manager, winning 38 trophies including 13 league titles, five FA Cups and two Champions League titles between 1986 and 2013. In the 1998\u201399 season, under Ferguson, the club became the first in the history of English football to achieve the continental treble of the Premier League, FA Cup and UEFA Champions League. In winning the UEFA Europa League under Jos\u00e9 Mourinho in 2016\u201317, they became one of five clubs to have won the original three main UEFA club competitions (the Champions League, Europa League and Cup Winners' Cup).\nManchester United is one of the most widely supported football clubs in the world and have rivalries with Liverpool, Manchester City, Arsenal and Leeds United. Manchester United was the highest-earning football club in the world for 2016\u201317, with an annual revenue of \u20ac676.3\u00a0million, and the world's second-most-valuable football club in 2024, valued at \u00a36.55\u00a0billion ($5.22\u00a0billion). After being floated on the London Stock Exchange in 1991, the club was taken private in 2005 after a purchase by American businessman Malcolm Glazer valued at almost \u00a3800\u00a0million, of which over \u00a3500\u00a0million of borrowed money became the club's debt. From 2012, some shares of the club were listed on the New York Stock Exchange, although the Glazer family retains overall ownership and control of the club.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:TOC limit/styles.css\" /&gt;\nHistory.\nEarly years (1878\u20131945).\nManchester United were formed in 1878 as Newton Heath LYR Football Club by the Carriage and Wagon department of the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway (LYR) depot at Newton Heath. The team initially played games against other departments and railway companies, but on 20 November 1880, they competed in their first recorded match; wearing the colours of the railway company \u2013 green and gold \u2013 they were defeated 6\u20130 by Bolton Wanderers' reserve team. By 1888, the club had become a founding member of The Combination, a regional football league. Following the league's dissolution after only one season, Newton Heath joined the newly formed Football Alliance, which ran for three seasons before being merged with The Football League. This resulted in the club starting the 1892\u201393 season in the First Division, by which time it had become independent of the railway company and dropped the \"LYR\" from its name. After two seasons, the club was relegated to the Second Division.\nIn January 1902, with debts of \u00a32,670 \u2013 \u2013 the club was served with a winding-up order. Captain Harry Stafford found four local businessmen, including John Henry Davies (who became club president), each willing to invest \u00a3500 in return for a direct interest in running the club and who subsequently changed the name; on 24 April 1902, Manchester United was officially born. Under Ernest Mangnall, who assumed managerial duties in 1903, Manchester United finished as Second Division runners-up in 1906 and secured promotion to the First Division, which they won in 1908 \u2013 the club's first league title. The following season began with victory in the first ever Charity Shield and ended with the club's first FA Cup title. Mangnall was considered a significant influence behind the team's move to Old Trafford in 1910, and Manchester United won the First Division for the second time in 1911. At the end of the following season, however, Mangnall left the club to join Manchester City.\nIn 1922, three years after the resumption of football following the First World War, the club was relegated to the Second Division, where it remained until regaining promotion in 1925. Relegated again in 1931, Manchester United became a yo-yo club, achieving its all-time lowest position of 20th place in the Second Division in 1934, under secretary-manager Scott Duncan, narrowly avoiding relegation to the Third Division. Two years later, Duncan led the club to promotion before another relegation followed in 1937, which led to his resignation in November of that year. Following the death of principal benefactor John Henry Davies in October 1927, the club's finances deteriorated to the extent that Manchester United would likely have gone bankrupt had it not been for James W. Gibson, who, in December 1931, invested \u00a32,000 and assumed control of the club. In the 1938\u201339 season, the last year of football before the Second World War, the club finished 14th in the First Division.\nBusby years (1945\u20131969).\nIn October 1945, the impending resumption of football after the war led to the managerial appointment of Matt Busby, who demanded an unprecedented level of control over team selection, player transfers. and training sessions. Busby led the team to second-place league finishes in 1947, 1948. and 1949, and to FA Cup victory in 1948. In 1952, the club won the First Division, its first league title for 41 years. They then won back-to-back league titles in 1956 and 1957; the squad, which had an average age of 22, was nicknamed \"the Busby Babes\" by the media, a testament to Busby's faith in his youth players. In 1957, Manchester United became the first English team to compete in the European Cup, despite objections from The Football League, who had denied Chelsea the same opportunity the previous season. En route to the semi-final, which they lost to Real Madrid, the team recorded a 10\u20130 victory over Belgian champions Anderlecht, which remains the club's biggest victory on record.\nThe following season, on the way home from a European Cup quarter-final victory against Red Star Belgrade, the aircraft carrying the Manchester United players, officials, and journalists crashed while attempting to take off after refuelling in Munich, Germany. The Munich air disaster of 6 February 1958 claimed 23 lives, including those of eight players\u00a0\u2013 Geoff Bent, Roger Byrne, Eddie Colman, Duncan Edwards, Mark Jones, David Pegg, Tommy Taylor and Billy Whelan\u00a0\u2013 and injured several more.\nAssistant manager Jimmy Murphy took over as manager while Busby recovered from his injuries and the club's makeshift side reached the FA Cup final, which they lost to Bolton Wanderers. In recognition of the team's tragedy, UEFA invited the club to compete in the 1958\u201359 European Cup alongside eventual League champions Wolverhampton Wanderers. Despite approval from The Football Association, The Football League determined that the club should not enter the competition, since it had not qualified. Busby rebuilt the team through the 1960s by signing players such as Denis Law and Paddy Crerand, who combined with the next generation of youth players \u2013 including George Best \u2013 to win the FA Cup in 1963. Busby rested several key players for the League game before the Cup Final, which gave Dennis Walker the chance to make his debut against Nottingham Forest on 20 May. Walker thus became the first Black player to represent United. The following season, they finished second in the league, then won the title in 1965 and 1967. In 1968, Manchester United became the first English club to win the European Cup, beating Benfica 4\u20131 in the final with a team that contained three European Footballers of the Year: Bobby Charlton, Denis Law and George Best. They then represented Europe in the 1968 Intercontinental Cup against Estudiantes of Argentina, but defeat in the first leg in Buenos Aires meant a 1\u20131 draw at Old Trafford three weeks later was not enough to claim the title. Busby resigned as manager in 1969 before being replaced by the reserve team coach, former Manchester United player Wilf McGuinness.\n1969\u20131986.\nFollowing an eighth-place finish in the 1969\u201370 season and a poor start to the 1970\u201371 season, Busby was persuaded to temporarily resume managerial duties, and McGuinness returned to his position as reserve team coach. In June 1971, Frank O'Farrell was appointed as manager, but lasted less than 18\u00a0months before being replaced by Tommy Docherty in December 1972. Docherty saved Manchester United from relegation that season, only to see them relegated in 1974; by that time, the trio of Best, Law, and Charlton had left the club. The team won promotion at the first attempt and reached the FA Cup final in 1976, but were beaten by Southampton. They reached the final again in 1977, beating Liverpool 2\u20131. Docherty was dismissed shortly afterwards, following the revelation of his affair with the club physiotherapist's wife.\nDave Sexton replaced Docherty as manager in the summer of 1977. Despite major signings, including Joe Jordan, Gordon McQueen, Gary Bailey, and Ray Wilkins, the team failed to win any trophies; they finished second in 1979\u201380 and lost to Arsenal in the 1979 FA Cup final. Sexton was dismissed in 1981, even though the team won the last seven games under his direction. He was replaced by Ron Atkinson, who immediately broke the British record transfer fee to sign Bryan Robson from his former club West Bromwich Albion. Under Atkinson, Manchester United won the FA Cup in 1983 and 1985 and beat rivals Liverpool to win the 1983 Charity Shield. In 1985\u201386, after 13 wins and two draws in its first 15 matches, the club was favourite to win the league but finished in fourth place. The following season, with the club in danger of relegation by November, Atkinson was dismissed.\nFerguson years (1986\u20132013).\nAlex Ferguson and his assistant Archie Knox arrived from Aberdeen on 6 November 1986, and guided the club to an 11th-place finish in the league. Despite a second-place finish in 1987\u201388, the club was back in 11th place the following season. Reportedly on the verge of being dismissed, Ferguson's job was saved by victory over Crystal Palace in the 1990 FA Cup final. The following season, Manchester United claimed their first UEFA Cup Winners' Cup title. That triumph allowed the club to compete in the European Super Cup for the first time, where United beat European Cup holders Red Star Belgrade 1\u20130 at Old Trafford. The club appeared in two consecutive League Cup finals in 1991 and 1992, beating Nottingham Forest 1\u20130 in the second to win that competition for the first time as well. In 1993, in the first season of the newly founded Premier League, the club won their first league title since 1967, and a year later, for the first time since 1957, they won a second consecutive title \u2013 alongside the FA Cup \u2013 to complete the first \"Double\" in the club's history. United then became the first English club to do the Double twice when they won both competitions again in 1995\u201396, before retaining the league title once more in 1996\u201397 with a game to spare.\nIn the 1998\u201399 season, Manchester United became the first team to win the Premier League, FA Cup, and UEFA Champions League \u2013 \"The Treble\" \u2013 in the same season. Trailing 1\u20130 going into injury time in the 1999 UEFA Champions League final, Teddy Sheringham and Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r scored late goals to claim a dramatic victory over Bayern Munich, in what is considered one of the greatest comebacks of all time. That summer, Ferguson received a knighthood for his services to football.\nIn November 1999, the club became the only British team to ever win the Intercontinental Cup with a 1\u20130 victory over the strong 1999 Copa Libertadores winners Palmeiras in Tokyo. The Red Devils counted on an unexpected goalkeeper fail by future 2002 FIFA World Cup winner Marcos and a disallowed goal scored by Alex to win the game.\nManchester United won the league again in the 1999\u20132000 and 2000\u201301 seasons, becoming only the fourth club to win the English title three times in a row. The team finished third in 2001\u201302, before regaining the title in 2002\u201303. They won the 2003\u201304 FA Cup, beating Millwall 3\u20130 in the final at the Millennium Stadium in Cardiff to lift the trophy for a record 11th time. In the 2005\u201306 season, Manchester United failed to qualify for the knockout phase of the UEFA Champions League for the first time in over a decade, but recovered to secure a second-place league finish and victory over Wigan Athletic in the 2006 Football League Cup final. The club regained the Premier League title in the 2006\u201307 season, before completing the European double in 2007\u201308 with a 6\u20135 penalty shoot-out victory over Chelsea in the 2008 UEFA Champions League final in Moscow to go with their 17th English league title. Ryan Giggs made a record 759th appearance for the club in that game, overtaking previous record holder Bobby Charlton. In December 2008, the club became the first British team to win the FIFA Club World Cup after beating LDU Quito 1\u20130 in the final. Manchester United followed this with the 2008\u201309 Football League Cup, and its third successive Premier League title. That summer, forward Cristiano Ronaldo was sold to Real Madrid for a world record \u00a380\u00a0million. In 2010, Manchester United defeated Aston Villa 2\u20131 at Wembley to retain the League Cup, its first successful defence of a knockout cup competition.\nAfter finishing as runners-up to Chelsea in the 2009\u201310 season, United achieved a record 19th league title in 2010\u201311, securing the championship with a 1\u20131 away draw against Blackburn Rovers on 14 May 2011. This was extended to 20 league titles in 2012\u201313, securing the championship with a 3\u20130 home win against Aston Villa on 22 April 2013.\nPost-Ferguson decline (2013\u2013present).\nOn 8 May 2013, Ferguson announced that he was to retire as manager at the end of the football season, but would remain at the club as a director and club ambassador. He retired as the most decorated manager in football history. The club announced the next day that Everton manager David Moyes would replace him from 1 July, having signed a six-year contract. Ryan Giggs took over as interim player-manager 10 months later, on 22 April 2014, when Moyes was sacked after a poor season in which the club failed to defend their Premier League title and failed to qualify for the UEFA Champions League for the first time since 1995\u201396. They also failed to qualify for the UEFA Europa League, the first time Manchester United had not qualified for a European competition since 1990. On 19 May 2014, it was confirmed that Louis van Gaal would replace Moyes as Manchester United manager on a three-year deal, with Giggs as his assistant. Malcolm Glazer, the patriarch of the family that owns the club, died on 28 May 2014.\nUnder Van Gaal, United won a 12th FA Cup, but a disappointing slump in the middle of his second season led to rumours of the board sounding out potential replacements. Van Gaal was ultimately sacked just two days after the cup final victory, with United having finished fifth in the league. Former Porto, Chelsea, Inter Milan and Real Madrid manager Jos\u00e9 Mourinho was appointed in his place on 27 May 2016. Mourinho signed a three-year contract, and in his first season won the FA Community Shield, EFL Cup and UEFA Europa League. Wayne Rooney scored his 250th goal for United, a stoppage-time equaliser in a league game against Stoke City in January 2017, surpassing Sir Bobby Charlton as the club's all-time top scorer. The following season, United finished second in the league \u2013 their highest league placing since 2013 \u2013 but were still 19 points behind rivals Manchester City. Mourinho also guided the club to a 19th FA Cup final, but they lost 1\u20130 to Chelsea. On 18 December 2018, with United in sixth place in the Premier League table, 19 points behind leaders Liverpool and 11 points outside the Champions League places, Mourinho was sacked after 144 games in charge. The following day, former United striker Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r was appointed as caretaker manager until the end of the season. On 28 March 2019, after winning 14 of his first 19 matches in charge, Solskj\u00e6r was appointed permanent manager on a three-year deal.\nOn 18 April 2021, Manchester United announced they were joining 11 other European clubs as founding members of the European Super League, a proposed 20-team competition intended to rival the UEFA Champions League. The announcement drew a significant backlash from supporters, other clubs, media partners, sponsors, players and the UK Government, forcing the club to withdraw just two days later. The failure of the project led to the resignation of executive vice-chairman Ed Woodward, while resultant protests against Woodward and the Glazer family led to a pitch invasion ahead of a league match against Liverpool on 2 May 2021, which saw the first postponement of a Premier League game due to supporter protests in the competition's history.\nOn the pitch, United equalled their own record for the biggest win in Premier League history with a 9\u20130 win over Southampton on 2 February 2021, but ended the season with defeat on penalties in the UEFA Europa League final against Villarreal, going four straight seasons without a trophy. On 20 November 2021, Solskj\u00e6r left his role as manager. Former midfielder Michael Carrick took charge for the next three games, before the appointment of Ralf Rangnick as interim manager until the end of the season.\nOn 21 April 2022, Erik ten Hag was appointed as the manager from the end of the 2021\u201322 season, signing a contract until June 2025 with the option of extending for a further year. Under Ten Hag, Manchester United won the 2022\u201323 EFL Cup, defeating Newcastle United in the final to end their longest period without a trophy since a six-year span between 1977 and 1983. On 5 March 2023, the club suffered their joint-heaviest defeat, losing 7\u20130 to rivals Liverpool at Anfield. At the end of the following season, the club finished eighth in the Premier League, their lowest league finish since the 1989\u201390 season, but went on to beat cross-city rivals Manchester City 2\u20131 in the FA Cup final, to win their 13th FA Cup title. On 28 October 2024, Manchester United sacked Erik ten Hag with the club 14th in the Premier League and having recorded just four wins all season. \nOn 1 November 2024, Manchester United announced that they would be appointing Sporting CP boss Ruben Amorim as head coach from 11 November 2024. They finished the season 15th in the Premier League, their worst league campaign since their relegation in 1973\u201374. The club reached the UEFA Europa League final, but lost 1\u20130 to Tottenham Hotspur.\nCrest and colours.\nThe club crest is derived from the Manchester City Council coat of arms, although all that remains of it on the current crest is the ship in full sail. The devil stems from the club's nickname \"The Red Devils\" inspired from Salford Rugby Club; it was included on club programmes and scarves in the 1960s, and incorporated into the club crest in 1970, although the crest was not included on the chest of the shirt until 1971. In 1975, the red devil (\"A devil facing the sinister guardant supporting with both hands a trident gules\") was granted as a heraldic badge by the College of Arms to the English Football League for use by Manchester United. In 2023, the Red Devil motif alone, which had been used in promotional items and merchandise previously, was used as the sole badge on the Manchester United third kit. The existing crest remains on the home and away kits.\nNewton Heath's uniform in 1879, four years before the club played its first competitive match, has been documented as \"white with blue cord\". A photograph of the Newton Heath team, taken in 1892, is believed to show the players wearing red-and-white quartered jerseys and navy blue knickerbockers. Between 1894 and 1896, the players wore green and gold jerseys which were replaced in 1896 by white shirts, which were worn with navy blue shorts.\nAfter the name change in 1902, the club colours were changed to red shirts, white shorts, and black socks, which has become the standard Manchester United home kit. Very few changes were made to the kit until 1922 when the club adopted white shirts bearing a deep red \"V\" around the neck, similar to the shirt worn in the 1909 FA Cup final. They remained part of their home kits until 1927. For a period in 1934, the cherry and white hooped change shirt became the home colours, but the following season the red shirt was recalled after the club's lowest ever league placing of 20th in the Second Division and the hooped shirt dropped back to being the change.\nThe black socks were changed to white from 1959 to 1965, where they were replaced with red socks up until 1971 with white used on occasion, when the club reverted to black. Black shorts and white socks are sometimes worn with the home strip, most often in away games, if there is a clash with the opponent's kit. For 2018\u201319, black shorts and red socks became the primary choice for the home kit. Since 1997\u201398, white socks have been the preferred choice for European games, which are typically played on weeknights, to aid with player visibility. The current home kit is a red shirt with Adidas' trademark three stripes in red on the shoulders, white shorts, and black socks.\nThe Manchester United away strip has often been a white shirt, black shorts and white socks, but there have been several exceptions. These include an all-black strip with blue and gold trimmings between 1993 and 1995, the navy blue shirt with silver horizontal pinstripes worn during the 1999\u20132000 season, and the 2011\u201312 away kit, which had a royal blue body and sleeves with hoops made of small midnight navy blue and black stripes, with black shorts and blue socks. An all-grey away kit worn during the 1995\u201396 season was dropped after just five games; in its final outing against Southampton, Alex Ferguson instructed the team to change into the third kit during half-time. The reason for dropping it being that the players claimed to have trouble finding their teammates against the crowd, United failed to win a competitive game in the kit in five attempts. In 2001, to celebrate 100 years as \"Manchester United\", a reversible white and gold away kit was released, although the actual match day shirts were not reversible. Since 2016, the team has experimented with various colors and designs, going away from the traditional white.\nThe club's third kit was traditionally all-blue; this was most recently the case during the 2014\u201315 season. Exceptions include a green-and-gold halved shirt worn between 1992 and 1994, a blue-and-white striped shirt worn during the 1994\u201395 and 1995\u201396 seasons and once in 1996\u201397, an all-black kit worn during the Treble-winning 1998\u201399 season, and a white shirt with black-and-red horizontal pinstripes worn between 2003\u201304 and 2005\u201306. From 2006\u201307 to 2013\u201314, the third kit was the previous season's away kit, albeit updated with the new club sponsor in 2006\u201307 and 2010\u201311, apart from the 2008\u201309 season, when an all-blue kit was launched to mark the 40th anniversary of the 1967\u201368 European Cup success.\nGrounds.\n1878\u20131893: North Road.\nNewton Heath initially played on a field on North Road, close to the railway yard; the original capacity was about 12,000, but club officials deemed the facilities inadequate for a club hoping to join The Football League. Some expansion took place in 1887, and in 1891, Newton Heath used its minimal financial reserves to purchase two grandstands, each able to hold 1,000 spectators. Although attendances were not recorded for many of the earliest matches at North Road, the highest documented attendance was approximately 15,000 for a First Division match against Sunderland on 4 March 1893. A similar attendance was also recorded for a friendly match against Gorton Villa on 5 September 1889.\n1893\u20131910: Bank Street.\nIn June 1893, after the club was evicted from North Road by its owners, Manchester Deans and Canons, who felt it was inappropriate for the club to charge an entry fee to the ground, secretary A. H. Albut procured the use of the Bank Street ground in Clayton. It initially had no stands, by the start of the 1893\u201394 season, two had been built; one spanning the full length of the pitch on one side and the other behind the goal at the \"Bradford end\". At the opposite end, the \"Clayton end\", the ground had been \"built up, thousands thus being provided for\". Newton Heath's first league match at Bank Street was played against Burnley on 1 September 1893, when 10,000 people saw Alf Farman score a hat-trick, Newton Heath's only goals in a 3\u20132 win. The remaining stands were completed for the following league game against Nottingham Forest three weeks later. In October 1895, before the visit of Manchester City, the club purchased a 2,000-capacity stand from the Broughton Rangers rugby league club, and put up another stand on the \"reserved side\" (as distinct from the \"popular side\"); however, weather restricted the attendance for the Manchester City match to just 12,000.\nWhen the Bank Street ground was temporarily closed by bailiffs in 1902, club captain Harry Stafford raised enough money to pay for the club's next away game at Bristol City and found a temporary ground at Harpurhey for the next reserves game against Padiham. Following financial investment, new club president John Henry Davies paid \u00a3500 for the erection of a new 1,000-seat stand at Bank Street. Within four years, the stadium had cover on all four sides, as well as the ability to hold approximately 50,000 spectators, some of whom could watch from the viewing gallery atop the Main Stand.\n1910\u2013present: Old Trafford.\nFollowing Manchester United's first league title in 1908 and the FA Cup a year later, it was decided that Bank Street was too restrictive for Davies' ambition; in February 1909, six weeks before the club's first FA Cup title, Old Trafford was named as the home of Manchester United, following the purchase of land for around \u00a360,000. Architect Archibald Leitch was given a budget of \u00a330,000 for construction; original plans called for seating capacity of 100,000, though budget constraints forced a revision to 77,000. The building was constructed by Messrs Brameld and Smith of Manchester. The stadium's record attendance was registered on 25 March 1939, when an FA Cup semi-final between Wolverhampton Wanderers and Grimsby Town drew 76,962\u00a0spectators.\nBombing in the Second World War destroyed much of the stadium; the central tunnel in the South Stand was all that remained of that quarter. After the war, the club received compensation from the War Damage Commission in the amount of \u00a322,278. While reconstruction took place, the team played its \"home\" games at Manchester City's Maine Road ground; Manchester United was charged \u00a35,000 per year, plus a nominal percentage of gate receipts. Later improvements included the addition of roofs, first to the Stretford End and then to the North and East Stands. The roofs were supported by pillars that obstructed many fans' views, and they were eventually replaced with a cantilevered structure. The Stretford End was the last stand to receive a cantilevered roof, completed in time for the 1993\u201394 season. First used on 25 March 1957 and costing \u00a340,000, four pylons were erected, each housing 54\u00a0individual floodlights. These were dismantled in 1987 and replaced by a lighting system embedded in the roof of each stand, which remains in use today.\nThe Taylor Report's requirement for an all-seater stadium lowered capacity at Old Trafford to around 44,000 by 1993. In 1995, the North Stand was redeveloped into three tiers, restoring capacity to approximately 55,000. At the end of the 1998\u201399 season, second tiers were added to the East and West Stands, raising capacity to around 67,000, and between July 2005 and May 2006, 8,000 more seats were added via second tiers in the north-west and north-east quadrants. Part of the new seating was used for the first time on 26 March 2006, when an attendance of 69,070 became a new Premier League record. The record was pushed steadily upwards before reaching its peak on 31 March 2007, when 76,098 spectators saw Manchester United beat Blackburn Rovers 4\u20131, with just 114 seats (0.15\u00a0per\u00a0cent of the total capacity of 76,212) unoccupied. In 2009, reorganisation of the seating resulted in a reduction of capacity by 255 to 75,957. Manchester United has the second highest average attendance among European football clubs, behind only Borussia Dortmund. \nProposed new ground.\nIn 2021, United co-chairman Joel Glazer said that \"early-stage planning work\" for the redevelopment of Old Trafford was underway. This followed \"increasing criticism\" over the lack of development of the ground since 2006. After the club's takeover by Sir Jim Ratcliffe in 2024, it emerged that plans were being made for the construction of a new, 100,000-capacity stadium near Old Trafford and that the current stadium would be downsized to serve as the home for the women's team and the club's academy. In November 2024, it was revealed that the majority of fans surveyed are in favour of a new-build rather than redevelopment.\nOn 11 March 2025, the club announced that it had retained Foster and Partners to construct a new, 100,000-capacity stadium adjacent to Old Trafford. The club claims they are consulting with fans on key aspects of the build. \nThe new stadium is under consideration as a host venue for the 2035 FIFA Women's World Cup.\nSupport.\nAnthem of Manchester United FC\nManchester United is one of the most popular football clubs in the world, with one of the highest average home attendances in Europe. The club states that its worldwide fan base includes more than 200 officially recognised branches of the Manchester United Supporters Club (MUSC), in at least 24 countries. The club takes advantage of this support through its worldwide summer tours. Accountancy firm and sports industry consultants Deloitte estimate that Manchester United has 75\u00a0million fans worldwide. The club has the third highest social media following in the world among sports teams (after Barcelona and Real Madrid), with over 82\u00a0million Facebook followers as of July 2023. A 2014 study showed that Manchester United had the loudest fans in the Premier League.\nSupporters are represented by two independent bodies; the Independent Manchester United Supporters' Association (IMUSA), which maintains close links to the club through the MUFC Fans Forum, and the Manchester United Supporters' Trust (MUST). After the Glazer family's takeover in 2005, a group of fans formed a splinter club, F.C. United of Manchester. The West Stand of Old Trafford \u2013 the \"Stretford End\" \u2013 is the home end and the traditional source of the club's most vocal support.\nIn March 2025, Manchester United officially launched their first Jewish supporters\u2019 club. During the same year, the club also welcomed the \"Stretford Sikhs\", a non-geographic official supporters' club for Sikhs.\nRivalries.\nManchester United has high-profile rivalries with Liverpool and local neighbours Manchester City. The club has also had rivalries throughout its history with the likes of Arsenal, Leeds United and Chelsea.\nThe matches against Manchester City are known as the Manchester derby, as they are the two most important teams in the city of Manchester. It is considered one of the biggest local derbies in British football, particularly after City's rise to prominence in the 2010s and the two clubs fighting for trophies, such as the league title in 2012 and 2013, as well as two consecutive FA Cup finals in 2023 and 2024.\nThe rivalry with Liverpool is rooted in competition between the cities during the Industrial Revolution, when Manchester was famous for its textile industry while Liverpool was a major port. The two clubs are the most successful in the history of English football; between them they have won 40 league titles, 9 European Cups, 21 FA Cups, 16 League Cups, 4 UEFA Cup/Europa Leagues, 2 FIFA Club World Cups, 1 Intercontinental Cup, 37 FA Community Shields and 5 UEFA Super Cups. Ranked the two biggest clubs in England by \"France Football\" magazine based on metrics such as fanbase and historical importance, matches between Manchester United and Liverpool are considered to be the most famous fixture in English football and one of the biggest rivalries in the football world. No player has been transferred between the clubs since 1964. Former Manchester United manager Alex Ferguson said in 2002, \"My greatest challenge was knocking Liverpool right off their fucking perch\". As of April 2025, Liverpool lead in terms of number of trophies won with 69 to United\u2019s 68, while United lead in the head-to-head record between the two teams with 83 wins to Liverpool's 72; the remaining 61 matches have finished as draws.\nThe \"Roses Rivalry\" with Leeds stems from the Wars of the Roses, fought between the House of Lancaster and the House of York, with Manchester United representing Lancashire and Leeds representing Yorkshire.\nThe rivalry with Arsenal arose from the numerous times the two teams battled for the Premier League title, especially under managers Alex Ferguson and Ars\u00e8ne Wenger, who also had a heated personal rivalry. With 33 titles between them (20 for Manchester United, 13 for Arsenal), the fixture has been described as a \"blockbuster\" and the \"greatest\" rivalry in the history of the Premier League.\nGlobal brand.\nManchester United has been described as a global brand; a 2011 report by Brand Finance, valued the club's trademarks and associated intellectual property at \u00a3412\u00a0million \u2013 an increase of \u00a339\u00a0million on the previous year, valuing it at \u00a311\u00a0million more than the second best brand, Real Madrid \u2013 and gave the brand a strength rating of AAA (Extremely Strong). In July 2012, Manchester United was ranked first by \"Forbes\" magazine in its list of the ten most valuable sports team brands, valuing the Manchester United brand at $2.23\u00a0billion. The club is ranked third in the Deloitte Football Money League (behind Real Madrid and Barcelona). In January 2013, the club became the first sports team in the world to be valued at $3\u00a0billion. \"Forbes\" magazine valued the club at $3.3\u00a0billion \u2013 $1.2\u00a0billion higher than the next most valuable sports team. They were overtaken by Real Madrid for the next four years, but Manchester United returned to the top of the \"Forbes\" list in June 2017, with a valuation of $3.689\u00a0billion.\nThe core strength of Manchester United's global brand is often attributed to Matt Busby's rebuilding of the team and subsequent success following the Munich air disaster, which drew worldwide acclaim. The \"iconic\" team included Bobby Charlton and Nobby Stiles (members of England's World Cup-winning team), Denis Law and George Best. The attacking style of play adopted by this team (in contrast to the defensive-minded \"catenaccio\" approach favoured by the leading Italian teams of the era) \"captured the imagination of the English footballing public\". Busby's team also became associated with the liberalisation of Western society during the 1960s; George Best, known as the \"Fifth Beatle\" for his iconic haircut, was the first footballer to significantly develop an off-the-field media profile.\nAs the second English football club to float on the London Stock Exchange in 1991, the club raised significant capital, with which it further developed its commercial strategy. The club's focus on commercial and sporting success brought significant profits in an industry often characterised by chronic losses. The strength of the Manchester United brand was bolstered by intense off-the-field media attention to individual players, most notably David Beckham (who quickly developed his own global brand). This attention often generates greater interest in on-the-field activities, and hence generates sponsorship opportunities \u2013 the value of which is driven by television exposure. During his time with the club, Beckham's popularity across Asia was integral to the club's commercial success in that part of the world.\nBecause higher league placement results in a greater share of television rights, success on the field generates greater income for the club. Since the inception of the Premier League, Manchester United has received the largest share of the revenue generated from the BSkyB broadcasting deal. Manchester United has also consistently enjoyed the highest commercial income of any English club; in 2005\u201306, the club's commercial arm generated \u00a351\u00a0million, compared to \u00a342.5\u00a0million at Chelsea, \u00a339.3\u00a0million at Liverpool, \u00a334\u00a0million at Arsenal and \u00a327.9\u00a0million at Newcastle United. A key sponsorship relationship was with sportswear company Nike, who managed the club's merchandising operation as part of a \u00a3303\u00a0million 13-year partnership between 2002 and 2015. Through Manchester United Finance and the club's membership scheme, One United, those with an affinity for the club can purchase a range of branded goods and services. Additionally, Manchester United-branded media services \u2013 such as the club's dedicated television channel, MUTV \u2013 have allowed the club to expand its fan base to those beyond the reach of its Old Trafford stadium.\nSponsorship.\nIn an initial five-year deal worth \u00a3500,000, Sharp Electronics became the club's first shirt sponsor at the beginning of the 1982\u201383 season, a relationship that lasted until the end of the 1999\u20132000 season, when Vodafone agreed a four-year, \u00a330\u00a0million deal. Vodafone agreed to pay \u00a336\u00a0million to extend the deal by four years, but after two seasons triggered a break clause in order to concentrate on its sponsorship of the Champions League.\nTo commence at the start of the 2006\u201307 season, American insurance corporation AIG agreed a four-year \u00a356.5\u00a0million deal which in September 2006 became the most valuable in the world. At the beginning of the 2010\u201311 season, American reinsurance company Aon became the club's principal sponsor in a four-year deal reputed to be worth approximately \u00a380\u00a0million, making it the most lucrative shirt sponsorship deal in football history. Manchester United announced their first training kit sponsor in August 2011, agreeing a four-year deal with DHL reported to be worth \u00a340\u00a0million; it is believed to be the first instance of training kit sponsorship in English football. The DHL contract lasted for over a year before the club bought back the contract in October 2012, although they remained the club's official logistics partner. The contract for the training kit sponsorship was then sold to Aon in April 2013 for a deal worth \u00a3180\u00a0million over eight years, which also included purchasing the naming rights for the Trafford Training Centre.\nThe club's first kit manufacturer was Umbro, until a five-year deal was agreed with Admiral Sportswear in 1975. Adidas won the contract in 1980, before Umbro started a second spell in 1992. That sponsorship lasted for ten years, followed by Nike's record-breaking \u00a3302.9\u00a0million deal, which lasted until 2015; 3.8\u00a0million replica shirts were sold in the first 22 months with the company. In addition to Nike and Chevrolet, the club also has several lower-level \"platinum\" sponsors, including Aon and Budweiser.\nOn 30 July 2012, United signed a seven-year deal with American automotive corporation General Motors, which replaced Aon as the shirt sponsor from the 2014\u201315 season. The new $80m-a-year shirt deal is worth $559m over seven years and features the logo of General Motors brand Chevrolet. Nike announced that they would not renew their kit supply deal with Manchester United after the 2014\u201315 season, citing rising costs. Since the start of the 2015\u201316 season, Adidas has manufactured Manchester United's kit as part of a world-record 10-year deal worth a minimum of \u00a3750\u00a0million. Plumbing products manufacturer Kohler became the club's first sleeve sponsor ahead of the 2018\u201319 season. Manchester United and General Motors did not renew their sponsorship deal, and the club subsequently signed a five-year, \u00a3235\u00a0million sponsorship deal with TeamViewer ahead of the 2021\u201322 season. At the end of the 2023\u201324 season, TeamViewer were replaced by Snapdragon, who agreed a deal worth more than \u00a360\u00a0million a year to take over as the club's main sponsor. In August 2024, Snapdragon's parent company Qualcomm triggered an option to extend the deal by two years, taking it through to 2029.\nOwnership and finances.\nOriginally funded by the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway Company, the club became a limited company in 1892 and sold shares to local supporters for \u00a31 via an application form. In 1902, majority ownership passed to the four local businessmen who invested \u00a3500 to save the club from bankruptcy, including future club president John Henry Davies. After his death in 1927, the club faced bankruptcy yet again, but was saved in December 1931 by James W. Gibson, who assumed control of the club after an investment of \u00a32,000. Gibson promoted his son, Alan, to the board in 1948, but died three years later; the Gibson family retained ownership of the club through James' wife, Lillian, but the position of chairman passed to former player Harold Hardman.\nPromoted to the board a few days after the Munich air disaster, Louis Edwards, a friend of Matt Busby, began acquiring shares in the club; for an investment of approximately \u00a340,000, he accumulated a 54\u00a0per\u00a0cent shareholding and took control in January 1964. When Lillian Gibson died in January 1971, her shares passed to Alan Gibson who sold a percentage of his shares to Louis Edwards' son, Martin, in 1978; Martin Edwards went on to become chairman upon his father's death in 1980. Media tycoon Robert Maxwell attempted to buy the club in 1984, but did not meet Edwards' asking price. In 1989, chairman Martin Edwards attempted to sell the club to Michael Knighton for \u00a320\u00a0million, but the sale fell through and Knighton joined the board of directors instead.\nManchester United was floated on the stock market in June 1991 (raising \u00a36.7\u00a0million), and received yet another takeover bid in 1998, this time from Rupert Murdoch's British Sky Broadcasting Corporation. This resulted in the formation of \"Shareholders United Against Murdoch\" \u2013 now the \"Manchester United Supporters' Trust\" \u2013 who encouraged supporters to buy shares in the club in an attempt to block any hostile takeover. The Manchester United board accepted a \u00a3623\u00a0million offer, but the takeover was blocked by the Monopolies and Mergers Commission at the final hurdle in April 1999. A few years later, a power struggle emerged between the club's manager, Alex Ferguson, and his horse-racing partners, John Magnier and J. P. McManus, who had gradually become the majority shareholders. In a dispute that stemmed from contested ownership of the horse Rock of Gibraltar, Magnier and McManus attempted to have Ferguson removed from his position as manager, and the board responded by approaching investors to attempt to reduce the Irishmen's majority.\nGlazer ownership.\nIn May 2005, Malcolm Glazer purchased the 28.7\u00a0per\u00a0cent stake held by McManus and Magnier, thus acquiring a controlling interest through his investment vehicle Red Football Ltd in a highly leveraged takeover valuing the club at approximately \u00a3800\u00a0million (then approx. $1.5\u00a0billion). Once the purchase was complete, the club was taken off the stock exchange. Much of the takeover money was borrowed by the Glazers; the debts were transferred to the club. As a result, the club went from being debt-free to being saddled with debts of \u00a3540\u00a0million, at interest rates of between 7% and 20%.\nIn July 2006, the club announced a \u00a3660\u00a0million debt refinancing package, resulting in a 30\u00a0per\u00a0cent reduction in annual interest payments to \u00a362\u00a0million a year. In January 2010, with debts of \u00a3716.5\u00a0million ($1.17\u00a0billion), Manchester United further refinanced through a bond issue worth \u00a3504\u00a0million, enabling them to pay off most of the \u00a3509\u00a0million owed to international banks. The annual interest payable on the bonds \u2013 which were to mature on 1 February 2017 \u2013 is approximately \u00a345\u00a0million per annum. Despite restructuring, the club's debt prompted protests from fans on 23 January 2010, at Old Trafford and the club's Trafford Training Centre. Supporter groups encouraged match-going fans to wear green and gold, the colours of Newton Heath. On 30 January, reports emerged that the Manchester United Supporters' Trust had held meetings with a group of wealthy fans, dubbed the \"Red Knights\", with plans to buying out the Glazers' controlling interest. The club's debts reached a high of \u00a3777\u00a0million in June 2007.\nIn August 2011, the Glazers were believed to have approached Credit Suisse in preparation for a $1\u00a0billion (approx. \u00a3600\u00a0million) initial public offering (IPO) on the Singapore stock exchange that would value the club at more than \u00a32\u00a0billion; however, in July 2012, the club announced plans to list its IPO on the New York Stock Exchange instead. Shares were originally set to go on sale for between $16 and $20 each, but the price was cut to $14 by the launch of the IPO on 10 August, following negative comments from Wall Street analysts and Facebook's disappointing stock market debut in May. Even after the cut, Manchester United was valued at $2.3\u00a0billion, making it the most valuable football club in the world.\nThe New York Stock Exchange allows for different shareholders to enjoy different voting rights over the club. Shares offered to the public (\"Class A\") had 10 times lesser voting rights than shares retained by the Glazers (\"Class B\"). Initially in 2012, only 10% of shares were offered to the public. As of 2019, the Glazers retain ultimate control over the club, with over 70% of shares, and even higher voting power.\nIn 2012, \"The Guardian\" estimated that the club had paid a total of over \u00a3500\u00a0million in debt interest and other fees on behalf of the Glazers, and in 2019, reported that the total sum paid by the club for such fees had risen to \u00a31\u00a0billion. At the end of 2019, the club had a net debt of nearly \u00a3400\u00a0million.\nIn 2023, the Glazers began soliciting bids for the sale of the club, and several bids were received. Sir Jim Ratcliffe, who owns Ineos, and Hamad bin Jassim bin Jaber Al Thani, a Qatari sheikh, were the only bidders who had publicly declared their interest in a controlling share of the club. In March 2023, Finnish entrepreneur Thomas Zilliacus also made his interest in Manchester United public.\nOn 24 December 2023, it was announced that Ratcliffe had purchased 25 per cent of Manchester United, and that his Ineos Sport company was taking control of football operations. Ratcliffe's shareholdings increased to 28.94% in December 2024. The Glazers remain as majority shareholders.\nManchester United reported record revenues of \u00a3666.5 million in the year to June 2025 (up 0.7% from previous), but still a net loss of \u00a333 million.\n \"As of 2 September 2025\"\nPlayers.\nFirst-team squad.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Football squad player/styles.css\" /&gt;\nOut on loan.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Football squad player/styles.css\" /&gt;\nPlayer of the Year awards.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nHonours.\nManchester United is one of the most successful clubs in Europe in terms of trophies won. The club's first trophy was the Manchester Cup, which they won as Newton Heath LYR in 1886. In 1908, the club won their first league title, and won the FA Cup for the first time the following year. Since then, they have gone on to win a joint-record 20 top-division titles \u2013 including a record 13 Premier League titles \u2013 and their total of 13 FA Cups is second only to Arsenal (14). Those titles have meant the club has appeared a record 30 times in the FA Community Shield (formerly the FA Charity Shield), which is played at the start of each season between the winners of the league and FA Cup from the previous season; of those 30 appearances, Manchester United have won a record 21, including four times when the match was drawn and the trophy shared by the two clubs.\nThe club had a successful period under the management of Matt Busby, starting with the FA Cup in 1948 and culminating with becoming the first English club to win the European Cup in 1968, winning five league titles and two FA Cups in the intervening years. The club's most successful decade, however, came in the 1990s under Alex Ferguson; five league titles, four FA Cups, one League Cup, five Charity Shields (one shared), one UEFA Champions League, one UEFA Cup Winners' Cup, one UEFA Super Cup and one Intercontinental Cup. The club has won the Double (winning the Premier League and FA Cup in the same season) three times; the second in 1995\u201396 saw them become the first club to do so twice, and it became referred to as the \"Double Double\". United became the sole British club to win the Intercontinental Cup in 1999 and are one of only three British clubs to have won the FIFA Club World Cup, in 2008. In 1999, United became the first English club to win the Treble. In 2017, United won the 2016\u201317 UEFA Europa League, beating Ajax in the final. In winning that title, United became the fifth club to have won the \"European Treble\" of European Cup/UEFA Champions League, Cup Winners' Cup, and UEFA Cup/Europa League after Juventus, Ajax, Bayern Munich and Chelsea.\nThe club's most recent trophy is the 2023\u201324 FA Cup.\nDoubles and Trebles.\nShort competitions, comprising a single or two games \u2013 such as the FA Charity/Community Shield, Intercontinental Cup (now defunct), FIFA Club World Cup or UEFA Super Cup \u2013 are not generally considered to contribute towards a Double or Treble.\nManchester United Women.\nManchester United Supporters Club Ladies began operations in the late 1970s and was unofficially recognised as the club's senior women's team. They became founding members of the North West Women's Regional Football League in 1989. The team made an official partnership with Manchester United in 2001, becoming the club's official women's team; however, in 2005, following Malcolm Glazer's takeover, the club was disbanded as it was seen to be \"unprofitable\". In 2018, Manchester United formed a new women's football team, which entered the second division of women's football in England for their debut season. The women's football team won their first trophy on 12 May 2024 as they lifted the Women's FA Cup as they defeated Tottenham Hotspur 4\u20130.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The language name was a pun based upon the programming language catchphrases of the time, because Mesa is a \"high level\" programming language.\nMesa is an ALGOL-like language with strong support for modular programming. Every library module has at least two source files: a \"definitions\" file specifying the library's interface plus one or more \"program\" files specifying the implementation of the procedures in the interface. To use a library, a program or higher-level library must \"import\" the definitions. The Mesa compiler type-checks all uses of imported entities; this combination of separate compilation with type-checking was unusual at the time.\nMesa introduced several other innovations in language design and implementation, notably in the handling of software exceptions, thread synchronization, and incremental compilation.\nMesa was developed on the Xerox Alto, one of the first personal computers with a graphical user interface, however, most of the Alto's system software was written in BCPL. Mesa was the system programming language of the later Xerox Star workstations, and for the GlobalView desktop environment. Xerox PARC later developed Cedar, which was a superset of Mesa.\nMesa and Cedar had a major influence on the design of other important languages, such as Modula-2 and Java, and was an important vehicle for the development and dissemination of the fundamentals of GUIs, networked environments, and the other advances Xerox contributed to the field of computer science.\nHistory.\nMesa was originally designed in the Computer Systems Laboratory (CSL), a branch of the Xerox Palo Alto Research Center, for the Alto, an experimental micro-coded workstation. Initially, its spread was confined to PARC and a few universities to which Xerox had donated some Altos.\nMesa was later adopted as the systems programming language for Xerox's commercial workstations such as the Xerox 8010 (Xerox Star, Dandelion) and Xerox 6085 (Daybreak), in particular for the Pilot operating system.\nA secondary development environment, called the Xerox Development Environment (XDE) allowed developers to debug both the operating system Pilot as well as ViewPoint GUI applications using a world swap mechanism. This allowed the entire \"state\" of the world to be swapped out, and allowed low-level system crashes which paralyzed the whole system to be debugged. This technique did not scale very well to large application images (several megabytes), and so the Pilot/Mesa world in later releases moved away from the world swap view when the micro-coded machines were phased out in favor of SPARC workstations and Intel PCs running a Mesa PrincOps emulator for the basic hardware instruction set.\nMesa was compiled into a stack-machine language, purportedly with the highest code density ever achieved (roughly 4 bytes per high-level language statement). This was touted in a 1981 paper where implementors from the Xerox Systems Development Department (then, the development arm of PARC), tuned up the instruction set and published a paper on the resultant code density.\nMesa was taught via the Mesa Programming Course that took people through the wide range of technology Xerox had available at the time and ended with the programmer writing a \"hack\", a workable program designed to be useful. An actual example of such a hack is the BWSMagnifier, which was written in 1988 and allowed people to magnify sections of the workstation screen as defined by a resizable window and a changeable magnification factor. Trained Mesa programmers from Xerox were well versed in the fundamental of GUIs, networking, exceptions, and multi-threaded programming, almost a decade before they became standard tools of the trade.\nWithin Xerox, Mesa was eventually superseded by the Cedar programming language. Many Mesa programmers and developers left Xerox in 1985; some of them went to DEC Systems Research Center where they used their experience with Mesa in the design of Modula-2+, and later of Modula-3.\nMain features.\nSemantics.\nMesa was a strongly typed programming language with type-checking across module boundaries, but with enough flexibility in its type system that heap allocators could be written in Mesa.\nDue to its strict separation between interface and implementation, Mesa allows true incremental compilation and encourages architecture- and platform-independent programming. They also simplified source-level debugging, including remote debugging via the Ethernet.\nMesa had rich exception handling facilities, with four types of exceptions. It had support for thread synchronization via monitors. Mesa was the first language to implement monitor BROADCAST, a concept introduced by the Pilot operating system.\nSyntax.\nMesa has an \"imperative\" and \"algebraic\" syntax, based on ALGOL and Pascal rather than on BCPL or C; for instance, compound commands are indicated by the BEGIN and END keywords rather than braces. In Mesa, all keywords are written in uppercase.\nDue to PARC's using the 1963 variant of ASCII rather than the more common 1967 variant, the Alto's character set included a left-pointing arrow (\u2190) rather than an underscore. The result of this is that Alto programmers (including those using Mesa, Smalltalk etc.) conventionally used camelCase for compound identifiers, a practice which was incorporated in PARC's standard programming style. On the other hand, the availability of the left-pointing arrow allowed them to use it for the assignment operator, as it originally had been in ALGOL.\nWhen the Mesa designers wanted to implement an exception facility, they hired a recent M.Sc. graduate from Colorado who had written his thesis on exception handling facilities in algorithmic languages. This led to the richest exception facility for its time, with primitives SIGNAL, ERROR, ABORT, RETRY, CATCH, and CONTINUE. As the language did not have type-safe checks to verify full coverage for signal handling, uncaught exceptions were a common cause of bugs in released software.\nCedar.\nMesa was the precursor to the programming language Cedar. Cedar's main additions were garbage collection, dynamic types, better string support through ropes, a limited form of type parameterization, and special syntax for identifying the type-safe parts of multi-module software packages, to ensure deterministic execution and prevent memory leaks.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He was an astrologer, a reviver of Neoplatonism in touch with the major academics of his day, and the first translator of Plato's complete extant works into Latin. His Florentine Academy, an attempt to revive Plato's Academy, influenced the direction and tenor of the Italian Renaissance and the development of European philosophy.\nEarly life.\nFicino was born at Figline Valdarno. His father, Diotifeci d'Agnolo, was a physician under the patronage of Cosimo de' Medici, who took the young man into his household and became the lifelong patron of Marsilio, who was made tutor to his grandson, Lorenzo de' Medici. Giovanni Pico della Mirandola, the Italian humanist philosopher and scholar, was another of his students.\nCareer and thought.\nPlatonic Academy.\nDuring the sessions at Florence of the Council of Ferrara-Florence in 1438\u20131445, during the failed attempts to heal the schism of the Eastern (Orthodox) and Western (Catholic) churches, Cosimo de' Medici and his intellectual circle had made acquaintance with the Neoplatonic philosopher George Gemistos Plethon, whose discourses upon Plato and the Alexandrian mystics so fascinated the humanists of Florence that they named him the second Plato. In 1459 John Argyropoulos was lecturing on Greek language and literature at Florence, and Ficino became his pupil.\nWhen Cosimo decided to refound Plato's Academy at Florence, he chose Ficino as its head. In 1462, Cosimo supplied Ficino with Greek manuscripts of Plato's work, whereupon Ficino started translating the entire corpus into Latin (draft translation of the dialogues finished 1468\u201369; published 1484). Ficino also produced a translation of a collection of Hellenistic Greek documents found by Leonardo da Pistoia later called Hermetica, and the writings of many of the Neoplatonists, including Porphyry, Iamblichus, and Plotinus.\nAmong his many students were Niccolo Valori and Francesco Cattani da Diacceto. The latter was considered by Ficino to be his successor as the head of the Florentine Platonic Academy. Diacceto's student, Giovanni di Bardo Corsi, produced a short biography of Ficino in 1506.\nTheology, astrology, and the soul.\nThough trained as a physician, Ficino became a priest in 1473. In 1474 Ficino completed his treatise on the immortality of the soul, \"Theologia Platonica de immortalitate animae\" (Platonic Theology) and \"De Christiana Religione\" (On the Christian Religion), a history of religions and defense of Christianity. In the rush of enthusiasm for every rediscovery from Antiquity, he exhibited some interest in the arts of astrology (despite denigrating it in relation to divine revelation), which landed him in trouble with the Catholic Church. In 1489 he was accused of heresy before Pope Innocent VIII and was acquitted.\nWriting in 1492 Ficino proclaimed: &lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\"This century, like a golden age, has restored to light the liberal arts, which were almost extinct: grammar, poetry, rhetoric, painting, sculpture, architecture, music\u00a0... this century appears to have perfected astrology.\" \u2014\u200a\nFicino's letters, extending over the years 1474\u20131494, survive and have been published. He wrote \"De amore\" (Of Love) in 1484. \"De vita libri tres\" (Three books on life), or \"De triplici vita\" (The Book of Life), published in 1489, provides a great deal of medical and astrological advice for maintaining health and vigor, as well as espousing the Neoplatonist view of the world's ensoulment and its integration with the human soul:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;There will be some men or other, superstitious and blind, who see life plain in even the lowest animals and the meanest plants, but do not see life in the heavens or the world\u00a0... Now if those little men grant life to the smallest particles of the world, what folly! what envy! neither to know that the Whole, in which 'we live and move and have our being,' is itself alive, nor to wish this to be so.\nOne metaphor for this integrated \"aliveness\" is Ficino's astrology. In the \"Book of Life\", he details the interlinks between behavior and consequence. It talks about a list of things that hold sway over a man's destiny. Regardless, in his later extensive commentary on Plotinus's Ennead III, he actively and systematically repudiated the Neoplatonic account of the soul, the hypostasis Soul's unity, as well as the transmigration of the soul, the soul's eternity as opposed to mere imperishability, and the notion that the soul was created by intermediaries and not by God directly. Instead he preferred to interpret all of these more pagan Neoplatonic points, as Stephen Gersh comments in his Analytic Study of the same work, as moral allegories\u2015in keeping with his general tendency towards concordance between Platonism and Christianity.\nMedical works.\nProbably due to early influences from his father, Diotifeci, who was a doctor to Cosimo de' Medici, Ficino published Latin and Italian treatises on medical subjects such as \"Consiglio contro la pestilenza\" (Recommendations for the treatment of the plague) and \"De vita libri tres\" (Three books on life). His medical works exerted considerable influence on Renaissance physicians such as Paracelsus, with whom he shared the perception on the unity of the microcosmos and macrocosmos, and their interactions, through somatic and psychological manifestations, with the aim to investigate their signatures to cure diseases. Those works, which were very popular at the time, dealt with astrological and alchemical concepts. Thus Ficino came under the suspicion of heresy; especially after the publication of the third book in 1489, which contained specific instructions on healthful living in a world of demons and other spirits.\nPlatonic love.\nNotably, Ficino coined the term Platonic love, which first appeared in his letter to Alamanno Donati in 1476. In 1492, Ficino published \"Epistulae\" (Epistles), which contained Platonic love letters, written in Latin, to his academic colleague and life-long friend, Giovanni Cavalcanti, concerning the nature of Platonic love. Because of this, some have alleged Ficino was a homosexual, but this finds little basis in his letters or his general works and philosophy. In his commentary on the \"Republic\", too, he specifically denies to his readers that the homosexual references made in Plato's dialogue were anything more than to bemuse the audience, \"spoken merely to relieve the feeling of heaviness\". Regardless, Ficino's letters to Cavalcanti resulted in the popularization of the term Platonic love in Western Europe.\nDeath.\nFicino died on 1 October 1499 at Careggi. In 1521 his memory was honored with a bust sculpted by Andrea Ferrucci, which is located in the south side of the nave in the Cathedral of Santa Maria del Fiore.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It is one of three fundamental aspects of developmental biology along with the control of tissue growth and patterning of cellular differentiation.\nThe process controls the organized spatial distribution of cells during the embryonic development of an organism. Morphogenesis can take place also in a mature organism, such as in the normal maintenance of tissue by stem cells or in regeneration of tissues after damage. Cancer is an example of highly abnormal and pathological tissue morphogenesis. Morphogenesis also describes the development of unicellular life forms that do not have an embryonic stage in their life cycle. Morphogenesis is essential for the evolution of new forms.\nMorphogenesis is a mechanical process involving forces that generate mechanical stress, strain, and movement of cells, and can be induced by genetic programs according to the spatial patterning of cells within tissues. Abnormal morphogenesis is called dysmorphogenesis.\nHistory.\nSome of the earliest ideas and mathematical descriptions on how physical processes and constraints affect biological growth, and hence natural patterns such as the spirals of phyllotaxis, were written by D'Arcy Wentworth Thompson in his 1917 book \"On Growth and Form\" and Alan Turing in his \"The Chemical Basis of Morphogenesis\" (1952). Where Thompson explained animal body shapes as being created by varying rates of growth in different directions, for instance to create the spiral shell of a snail, Turing correctly predicted a mechanism of morphogenesis, the diffusion of two different chemical signals, one activating and one deactivating growth, to set up patterns of development, decades before the formation of such patterns was observed. The fuller understanding of the mechanisms involved in actual organisms required the discovery of the structure of DNA in 1953, and the development of molecular biology and biochemistry.\nGenetic and molecular basis.\nSeveral types of molecules are important in morphogenesis. Morphogens are soluble molecules that can diffuse and carry signals that control cell differentiation via concentration gradients. Morphogens typically act through binding to specific protein receptors. An important class of molecules involved in morphogenesis are transcription factor proteins that determine the fate of cells by interacting with DNA. These can be coded for by master regulatory genes, and either activate or deactivate the transcription of other genes; in turn, these secondary gene products can regulate the expression of still other genes in a regulatory cascade of gene regulatory networks. At the end of this cascade are classes of molecules that control cellular behaviors such as cell migration, or, more generally, their properties, such as cell adhesion or cell contractility. For example, during gastrulation, clumps of stem cells switch off their cell-to-cell adhesion, become migratory, and take up new positions within an embryo where they again activate specific cell adhesion proteins and form new tissues and organs. Developmental signaling pathways implicated in morphogenesis include Wnt, Hedgehog, and ephrins.\nCellular basis.\nAt a tissue level, ignoring the means of control, morphogenesis arises because of cellular proliferation and motility. Morphogenesis also involves changes in the cellular structure or how cells interact in tissues. These changes can result in tissue elongation, thinning, folding, invasion or separation of one tissue into distinct layers. The latter case is often referred as cell sorting. Cell \"sorting out\" consists of cells moving so as to sort into clusters that maximize contact between cells of the same type. The ability of cells to do this has been proposed to arise from differential cell adhesion by Malcolm Steinberg through his differential adhesion hypothesis. Tissue separation can also occur via more dramatic cellular differentiation events during which epithelial cells become mesenchymal (see Epithelial\u2013mesenchymal transition). Mesenchymal cells typically leave the epithelial tissue as a consequence of changes in cell adhesive and contractile properties. Following epithelial-mesenchymal transition, cells can migrate away from an epithelium and then associate with other similar cells in a new location. In plants, cellular morphogenesis is tightly linked to the chemical composition and the mechanical properties of the cell wall.\nCell-to-cell adhesion.\nDuring embryonic development, cells are restricted to different layers due to differential affinities. One of the ways this can occur is when cells share the same cell-to-cell adhesion molecules. For instance, homotypic cell adhesion can maintain boundaries between groups of cells that have different adhesion molecules. Furthermore, cells can sort based upon differences in adhesion between the cells, so even two populations of cells with different levels of the same adhesion molecule can sort out. In cell culture cells that have the strongest adhesion move to the center of a mixed aggregates of cells. Moreover, cell-cell adhesion is often modulated by cell contractility, which can exert forces on the cell-cell contacts so that two cell populations with equal levels of the same adhesion molecule can sort out. The molecules responsible for adhesion are called cell adhesion molecules (CAMs). Several types of cell adhesion molecules are known and one major class of these molecules are cadherins. There are dozens of different cadherins that are expressed on different cell types. Cadherins bind to other cadherins in a like-to-like manner: E-cadherin (found on many epithelial cells) binds preferentially to other E-cadherin molecules. Mesenchymal cells usually express other cadherin types such as N-cadherin.\nExtracellular matrix.\nThe extracellular matrix (ECM) is involved in keeping tissues separated, providing structural support or providing a structure for cells to migrate on. Collagen, laminin, and fibronectin are major ECM molecules that are secreted and assembled into sheets, fibers, and gels. Multisubunit transmembrane receptors called integrins are used to bind to the ECM. Integrins bind extracellularly to fibronectin, laminin, or other ECM components, and intracellularly to microfilament-binding proteins \u03b1-actinin and talin to link the cytoskeleton with the outside. Integrins also serve as receptors to trigger signal transduction cascades when binding to the ECM. A well-studied example of morphogenesis that involves ECM is mammary gland ductal branching.\nCell contractility.\nTissues can change their shape and separate into distinct layers via cell contractility. Just as in muscle cells, myosin can contract different parts of the cytoplasm to change its shape or structure. Myosin-driven contractility in embryonic tissue morphogenesis is seen during the separation of germ layers in the model organisms \"Caenorhabditis elegans\", \"Drosophila\" and zebrafish. There are often periodic pulses of contraction in embryonic morphogenesis. A model called the cell state splitter involves alternating cell contraction and expansion, initiated by a bistable organelle at the apical end of each cell. The organelle consists of microtubules and microfilaments in mechanical opposition. It responds to local mechanical perturbations caused by morphogenetic movements. These then trigger traveling embryonic differentiation waves of contraction or expansion over presumptive tissues that determine cell type and is followed by cell differentiation. The cell state splitter was first proposed to explain neural plate morphogenesis during gastrulation of the axolotl and the model was later generalized to all of morphogenesis.\nBranching morphogenesis.\nIn the development of the lung a bronchus branches into bronchioles forming the respiratory tree. The branching is a result of the tip of each bronchiolar tube bifurcating, and the process of branching morphogenesis forms the bronchi, bronchioles, and ultimately the alveoli.\nBranching morphogenesis is also evident in the ductal formation of the mammary gland. Primitive duct formation begins in development, but the branching formation of the duct system begins later in response to estrogen during puberty and is further refined in line with mammary gland development.\nCancer morphogenesis.\nCancer can result from disruption of normal morphogenesis, including both tumor formation and tumor metastasis. Mitochondrial dysfunction can result in increased cancer risk due to disturbed morphogen signaling.\nVirus morphogenesis.\nDuring assembly of the bacteriophage (phage) T4 virion, the morphogenetic proteins encoded by the phage genes interact with each other in a characteristic sequence. Maintaining an appropriate balance in the amounts of each of these proteins produced during viral infection appears to be critical for normal phage T4 morphogenesis. Phage T4 encoded proteins that determine virion structure include major structural components, minor structural components and non-structural proteins that catalyze specific steps in the morphogenesis sequence. Phage T4 morphogenesis is divided into three independent pathways: the head, the tail and the long tail fibres as detailed by Yap and Rossman.\nComputer models.\nAn approach to model morphogenesis in computer science or mathematics can be traced to Alan Turing's 1952 paper, \"The chemical basis of morphogenesis\", a model now known as the Turing pattern.\nAnother famous model is the so-called French flag model, developed in the sixties.\nImprovements in computer performance in the twenty-first century enabled the simulation of relatively complex morphogenesis models. In 2020, such a model was proposed where cell growth and differentiation is that of a cellular automaton with parametrized rules. As the rules' parameters are differentiable, they can be trained with gradient descent, a technique which has been highly optimized in recent years due to its use in machine learning. This model was limited to the generation of pictures, and is thus bi-dimensional.\nA similar model to the one described above was subsequently extended to generate three-dimensional structures, and was demonstrated in the video game \"Minecraft\", whose block-based nature made it particularly expedient for the simulation of 3D cellular automatons.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "19975", "revid": "19816285", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19975", "title": "Muhammad ibn Abd al-Wahhab", "text": "Islamic scholar, jurist, and eponym of Wahhabi movement (1703\u20131792) from Saudi Arabia\nMuhammad ibn Abd al-Wahhab ibn Sulayman al-Tamimi Al Najdi (1703\u20131792) was an Arab Muslim scholar, theologian, preacher, activist, religious leader, jurist, and reformer, who was from Najd in Arabian Peninsula and is considered as the eponymous founder of the Wahhabi movement.\nThe label \"Wahhabi\" is not claimed by his followers but rather employed by Western scholars as well as his critics. Born to a family of jurists, Ibn Abd al-Wahhab's early education consisted of learning a fairly standard curriculum of jurisprudence according to the Hanbali school, which was most prevalent in his area of birth. He promoted strict adherence to traditional Islamic law, proclaiming the necessity of returning directly to the Quran and Hadith literature rather than relying on medieval interpretations, and insisted that every Muslim\u00a0\u2013 male and female\u00a0\u2013 personally read and study the Quran. He opposed \"taqlid\" (blind following) and called for the use of \"ijtihad\" (independent legal reasoning through research of scripture).\nBeing given religious training under various Sunni Muslim scholars during his travels to Hejaz and Basra, Ibn \u02bfAbd al-Wahhab gradually became opposed to certain rituals and practices such as the visitation to and veneration of the shrines and tombs of Muslim saints, which he condemned as heretical religious innovation or even idolatry. While claiming to be a Hanbali, Ibn Abd al-Wahhab minimized reliance on medieval legal manuals, instead engaging in direct interpretation of scriptures. His views were also rejected by nearly all of mainstream Hanbali scholars of his time. His call for social reforms was based on the key doctrine of \"tawhid\" (oneness of God), and was greatly inspired by the treatises of classical scholars Ibn Taymiyya (d. 728 A.H/ 1328 C.E) and Ibn Qayyim (d. 751 A.H/ 1350 C.E).\nDespite being opposed or rejected by some of his contemporary critics amongst the religious clergy, Ibn Abd al-Wahhab charted a religio-political pact with Muhammad bin Saud to help him to establish the Emirate of Diriyah, the first Saudi state, and began a dynastic alliance and power-sharing arrangement between their families which continues to the present day in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. The Al ash-Sheikh, Saudi Arabia's leading religious family, are the descendants of Ibn \u02bfAbd al-Wahhab, and have historically led the \"ulama\" in the Saudi state, dominating the state's clerical institutions.\nAncestry and early life.\nMuhammad ibn Abd al-Wahhab is generally acknowledged to have been born in 1703 into the sedentary and impoverished Arab clan of Banu Tamim in 'Uyayna, a village in the Najd region of central Arabia. Before the emergence of the movement, there was a very limited history of Islamic education in the area. For this reason, Ibn \u02bfAbd al-Wahhab had modest access to Islamic education during his youth. Despite this, the area had nevertheless produced several notable jurists of the Hanbali school of orthodox Sunni jurisprudence, which was the school of law most prominently practiced in the area. In fact, Ibn \u02bfAbd-al-Wahhab's own family \"had produced several doctors of the school,\" with his father, \u02bfAbd al-Wahh\u0101b, having been the Hanbali jurisconsult of the Najd and his grandfather, Sulaym\u0101n, having been a judge of Hanbali law.\nEarly studies.\nIbn \u02bfAbd-al-Wahhab's early education was taught by his father, and consisted of learning the Quran by heart and studying a rudimentary level of Hanbali jurisprudence and Islamic theology as outlined in the works of Ibn Qudamah (d. 1223), one of the most influential medieval representatives of the Hanbali school, whose works were regarded \"as having great authority\" in the Najd. The affirmation of Islamic sainthood and the ability of saints to perform miracles (\"karamat\") by the grace of God had become a major aspect of Sunni Muslim belief throughout the Islamic world, being agreed-upon by majority of the classical Islamic scholars. Ibn \u02bfAbd-al-Wahhab had encountered various excessive beliefs and practices associated with saint-veneration and saint-cults which were prevalent in his area. During that era, various supernatural rituals and beliefs associated with magic, superstitions, occultism, numerology, etc. had become predominant across numerous towns and villages of Arabian Peninsula. He probably chose to leave Najd and look elsewhere for studies to see if such beliefs and rituals were as popular in the neighboring places of the Muslim world or the possibility that his home town offered inadequate educational resources. Even today, the reasoning for why he left Najd is unclear.\nTravels.\nPilgrimage to Mecca.\nAfter leaving 'Uyayna around the age of twenty, Ibn \u02bfAbd al-Wahhab performed the Greater Pilgrimage in Mecca, where the scholars appear to have held opinions and espoused teachings that were unpalatable to him. After this, he went to Medina, the stay at which seems to have been \"decisive in shaping the later direction of his thought.\" In Medina, he met a Hanbali theologian from Najd named \u02bfAbd All\u0101h ibn Ibr\u0101h\u012bm al-Najd\u012b, who had been a supporter of the works of Ibn Taymiyyah (d. 1328), who holds an exceptionally high position in Islamic history. Some Sunni Muslim scholars who adhere to a scripture-focused methodology praise Ibn Taymiyyah to be a mujadid of the authentic Sunnah, taking pride in the proliferation of his strict adherence to the Qur'an, Sunnah and way of the companions of Muhammad, though his teachings had been considered heterodox and misguided by many Sunni Muslim scholars who ascribed to the Sufis of their time.\nTutelage under Al-Sindhi.\nIbn Abd al-Wahhab's teacher, 'Abdallah ibn Ibrahim ibn Sayf, introduced the relatively young man to Mohammad Hayya Al-Sindhi in Medina, who belonged to the Naqshbandi order (\"tariqa\") of Sufism, and recommended him as a student. Muhammad Ibn Abd-al-Wahhab and al-Sindhi became very close, and Ibn Abd-al-Wahhab stayed with him for some time. Muhammad Hayya taught Muhammad Ibn Abd-al-Wahhab to reject popular religious practices associated with walis and their tombs. He also encouraged him to reject rigid imitation (\"Taqlid\") of medieval legal commentaries and develop individual research of scriptures (\"Ijtihad\"). Influenced by Al-Sindi's teachings, Ibn Abd al-Wahhab became critical of the established \"Madh'hab\" system, prompting him to disregard the instruments of \"Usul al-Fiqh\" in his intellectual approach. Ibn Abd al-Wahhab rarely made use of \"Fiqh\" (Islamic jurisprudence) and various legal opinions in his writings, by and large forming views based on his direct understanding of Scriptures.\nApart from his emphasis on hadith studies, aversion for the \"madhhab\" system and disregard for technical juristic discussions involving legal principles, Ibn Abd al-Wahh\u0101b's views on \"ziy\u0101rah\" (visitations to the shrines of \"Awliyaa\") were also shaped by Al-Sindhi. Sindi encouraged his student to reject folk practices associated with graves and saints. Various themes in Al-Sindi's writings, such as his opposition to erecting tombs and drawing human images, would be revived later by the Wahhabi movement. Sindi instilled in Ibn Abd al-Wahhab the belief that practices like beseeching the dead saints constituted apostasy and resembled the customs of the people of \"Jahiliyya\" (pre-Islamic era). In a significant encounter between a young Ibn Abd al-Wahhab and Al-Sindhi reported by the Najdi historian 'Uthman Ibn Bishr (d. 1288 A.H./ 1871/2 C.E.):\"... one day Shaykh Mu\u1e25ammad [Ibn 'Abdi'l-Wahh\u0101b] stood by the chamber of the Prophet where people were calling [upon him or supplicating] and seeking help by the Prophet's chamber, blessings and peace be upon him. He then saw Mu\u1e25ammad \u1e24ay\u0101t [al Sind\u012b] and came to him. The shaykh [Ibn 'Abdi'l-Wahh\u0101b] asked, \"What do you say about them?\" He [al-Sind\u012b] said, \"Verily that in which they are engaged shall be destroyed and their acts are invalid.\"\"\nJourney to Basra.\nFollowing his early education in Medina, Ibn \u02bfAbd-al-Wahhab traveled outside of the Arabian Peninsula, venturing first to Basra which was still an active center of Islamic culture. During his stay in Basra, Ibn 'Abd al-Wahhab studied Hadith and Fiqh under the Islamic scholar Muhammad al-Majmu'i. In Basra, Ibn 'Abd al-Wahhab came into contact with Shi'is and would write a treatise repudiating the theological doctrines of \"Rafidah\", an extreme sect of Shiism. He also became influenced by the writings of Hanbali theologian Ibn Rajab (d. 1393 C.E/ 795 A.H) such as \"\"Kalimat al-Ikhlas\" which inspired Ibn 'Abd al-Wahhab's seminal treatise \"Kitab al-Tawhid\"\".\nReturn to 'Uyaynah.\nEarly preaching.\nHis leave from Basra marked the end of his education and by the time of his return to 'Uyayna, Ibn 'Abd al-Wahhab had mastered various religious disciplines such as Islamic \"Fiqh\" (jurisprudence), theology, hadith sciences and \"Tasawwuf\". His exposure to various practices centered around the cult of saints and grave veneration would eventually propel Ibn 'Abd al-Wahhab to grow critical of Sufi superstitious accretions and practices. Rather than targeting \"Sufism\" as a phenomenon or a group, Ibn 'Abd al-Wahhab denounced particular practices which he considered sinful. He fashioned his reformist campaign in a manner that appealed to the socio-cultural dynamics of 18th century Arabia. Many of Ibn 'Abd al-Wahhab's scholarly treatises, pamphlets and speeches appropriated idioms of local Arab dialects, monologues of vernacular poetry and catchphrases of folk culture into his religious discourse.\nAs a gifted communicator with a talent for breaking down his ideas into shorter units, Ibn 'Abd al-Wahhab entitled his treatises with terms such as \"qaw\u0101\u02bfid\" (\"principles\"), \"mas\u0101\u02beil\" (\"matters\"), \"kalim\u0101t\" (\"phrases\"), or \"u\u1e63\u016bl\" (\"foundations\"), simplifying his texts point by point for mass reading. Calling upon the people to follow his call for religious revival (\"tajdid\" ) based on following the founding texts and the authoritative practices of the first generations of Muslims, Ibn 'Abd al-Wahhab declared: \"I do not - God be blessed - conform to any particular sufi order or \"faqih\", nor follow the course of any speculative theologian (\"mutakalim\") or any other Imam for that matter, not even such dignitaries as ibn al-Qayyim, al-Dhahabi, or ibn Kathir, I summon you only to God, and Only Him as well as observe the path laid by His Prophet, God's messenger.\"\nIbn \u02bfAbd al-Wahhab's call gradually began to attract followers, including the ruler of 'Uyayna, Uthman ibn Mu'ammar. Upon returning to Huraymila, where his father had settled, Ibn \u02bfAbd al-Wahhab wrote his first work on the Unity of God. With Ibn Mu'ammar, Ibn \u02bfAbd al-Wahhab agreed to support Ibn Mu'ammar's political ambitions to expand his rule \"over Najd and possibly beyond\", in exchange for the ruler's support for Ibn \u02bfAbd al-Wahhab's religious teachings. During the early years of preaching, he criticised various folk practices and superstitions peacefully through sermons. Starting from 1742, Ibn 'Abd al-Wahhab would shift towards an activist stance; and began to implement his reformist ideas. First, he persuaded Ibn Mu'ammar to help him level the tomb of Zayd ibn al-Khattab, a companion of Muhammad, whose shrine was revered by locals. Secondly, he ordered the cutting down of trees considered sacred by locals, cutting down \"the most glorified of all of the trees\" himself. Third, he organized the stoning of a woman who confessed to having committed adultery.\nThese actions gained the attention of Sulaiman ibn Muhammad ibn Ghurayr of the tribe of Bani Khalid, the chief of Al-Hasa and Qatif, who held substantial influence in Najd. Ibn Ghurayr threatened Ibn Mu'ammar by denying him the ability to collect a land tax for some properties that Ibn Mu'ammar owned in Al-Hasa if he did not kill or drive away from Ibn \u02bfAbd al-Wahhab. Consequently, Ibn Mu'ammar forced Ibn \u02bfAbd al-Wahhab to leave.\nThe early Wahhabis had been protected by Ibn Mu'ammar in 'Uyayna, despite being persecuted in other settlements. As soon as Ibn Mu'ammar disowned them, Wahhabis were subject to excommunication (\"Takfir\"); exposing themselves to loss of lives and property. This experience of suffering reminded them of the \"Mihna\" against Ahmad Ibn Hanbal and his followers, and shaped the collective Wahhabi memory. As late as 1749, the sharif of Mecca imprisoned those Wahhabis who went to Mecca to perform the \"Hajj\" (annual pilgrimage).\nPact with Muhammad bin Saud.\nUpon his expulsion from 'Uyayna, Ibn \u02bfAbd al-Wahhab was invited to settle in neighboring Diriyah by its ruler Muhammad ibn Saud Al Muqrin. After some time in Diriyah, Ibn \u02bfAbd al-Wahhab concluded his second and more successful agreement with a ruler. Ibn \u02bfAbd al-Wahhab and Muhammad bin Saud agreed that, together, they would bring the Arabs of the peninsula back to the \"true\" principles of Islam as they saw it. According to the anonymous author of \"Lam al-Shihab\" (Brilliance of the Meteor), when they first met, Ibn Saud declared:\"This oasis is yours, do not fear your enemies. By the name of God, if all Nejd was summoned to throw you out, we will never agree to expel you.\"\nMuhammad ibn \u02bfAbd al-Wahhab replied:\"You are the settlement's chief and wise man. I want you to grant me an oath that you will perform jihad against the unbelievers. In return, you will be imam, leader of the Muslim community and I will be leader in religious matters.\"\nThe agreement was confirmed with a mutual oath of loyalty (\"bay'ah\") in 1744. Once Al-Sa'ud made Dir'iyya a safe haven, Wahhabis from other towns took refuge. These included dissenters from Ibn Mu'ammar clan who had sworn allegiance to Ibn 'Abd al-Wahhab. The nucleus of Ibn 'Abd al-Wahhab's supporters all across Najd retreated to Dir'iyyah and formed the vanguard of the insurgency launched by Al-Saud against other towns.\nFrom a person who started his career as a lone activist, Ibn 'Abd al-Wahhab would become the spiritual guide of the nascent Emirate of Muhammad ibn Saud Al-Muqrin. Ibn 'Abd al-Wahhab would be responsible for religious matters and Ibn Saud in charge of political and military issues. This agreement became a \"mutual support pact\" and power-sharing arrangement between the Aal Saud family, and the \"Aal ash-Sheikh\" and followers of Ibn \u02bfAbd al-Wahhab, which had remained in place for nearly 300 years, providing the ideological impetus to Saudi expansion. Reviving the teachings of Ibn Taymiyya, the \"Muwa\u1e25\u1e25id\u016bn\" (Unitarian) movement emphasized strict adherence to \"Qur'an\" and \"Sunnah\"; while simultaneously championing the conception of an Islamic state based on the model of early Muslim community in Medina. Meanwhile, it's Muslim and Western opponents derogatorily labelled the movement as the \"Wahh\u0101biyyah\" (anglicised as \"Wahhabism\").\nRise of Emirate of Dir'iyyah.\nThe 1745 pact between Muhammad ibn Saud and Muhammad ibn \u02bfAbd al-Wahhab marked the rise of the First Saudi state, the Emirate of Diriyah, which was established in 1727. By offering the Al-Saud a clearly defined religious mission, the alliance provided the ideological impetus to Saudi expansion. Deducing from his bitter experiences in 'Uyaynah, Ibn 'Abd al-Wahhab had understood the necessity of political backing from a strong Islamic political entity to transform the local socio-religious status quo and also safeguard Wahhabism's territorial base from external pressure. After consolidating his position in Diriyah, he wrote to the rulers and clerics of other towns; appealing them to embrace his doctrines. While some heeded his calls, others rejected it; accusing him of ignorance or sorcery.\nWar with Riyadh (1746\u20131773).\nRealising the significance of efficient religious preaching (\"da'wa\"), Ibn 'Abd al-Wahhab called upon his students to master the path of reasoning and proselytising over warfare to convince other Muslims of their reformist endeavour. Between 1744 and 1746, Ibn 'Abd al-Wahhab's preaching continued in the same non-violent manner as before and spread widely across the people of Najd. Rulers of various towns across Najd pledged their allegiance to Ibn Su\u02bf\u016bd. This situation changed drastically around 1158/1746; when the powerful anti-Wahhabi chieftain of Riyadh, Dahh\u0101m ibn Daww\u0101s (fl. 1187/1773), attacked the town of Manfuha which had pledged allegiance to Diriyah. This would spark a nearly 30-year long war between Diriyah and Riyadh, which lasted until 1187/1773, barring some interruptions. First conquering Najd, Muhammad ibn Saud's forces expanded the Wahhabi influence to most of the present-day territory of Saudi Arabia, eradicating various popular practices they viewed as akin to polytheism and propagating the doctrines of \u02bfAbd al-Wahhab.\nMuhammad Ibn \u02bfAbd al-Wahh\u0101b maintained that the military campaigns of the Emirate of Dir\u02bfiyya were strictly defensive and rebuked his opponents as being the first to initiate \"Takfir\" (excommunication). Ibn 'Abd al-Wahhab had defined jihad as an activity that must have a valid religious justification and which can only be declared by an \"Imam\" whose purpose must be strictly defensive in nature. Justifying the Wahhabi military campaigns as defensive operations against their enemies, Ibn 'Abd al-Wahhab asserts:\"As for warfare, until today, we did not fight anyone, except in defense of our lives and honor. They came to us in our area and did not spare any effort in fighting us. We only initiated fighting against some of them in retaliation for their continued aggression, [The recompense for an evil is an evil like thereof] (42:40)... they are the ones who started declaring us to be unbelievers and fighting us\"\nRebellion in Huraymila (1752\u20131755).\nIn 1753\u20134, the Wahhabis were confronted by an alarming number of towns renouncing allegiance and aligning with their opponents. Most prominent amongst these was the town of Huraymila, which had pledged allegiance to Dir'iyah in 1747. However, by 1752, a group of rebels encouraged by Ibn \u02bfAbd al-Wahh\u0101b's brother, Sulaym\u0101n, had initiated a coup in Huraymila and installed a new ruler that threatened to topple the Wahh\u0101b\u012b order. A fierce war between Diriyah and Huraymila began in a magnitude that was unprecedented. Ibn 'Abd al-Wahhab held a convocation of Wahhabis from all the settlements across Najd. Reviewing the recent desertions and defeats, he encouraged them to hold fast to their faith and recommit to the struggle.\nThe ensuing battles and the re-capture of Huraymila in 1168/1755, constituted a significant development in Wahhabi expansionist stage. Abd al-Azeez, the son of Muhammad ibn Saud, had emerged as the principal leader of the Wahhabi military operations. Alongside a force of 800 men, accompanied by an additional 200 under the command of the deposed ruler of Huraymila, Abd al Azeez was able to subdue the rebels. More significantly, the rationale behind the campaign was based on Ibn \u02bfAbd al-Wahh\u0101b's newly written epistle \"Muf\u012bd al-mustaf\u012bd\", which marked a shift from the earlier posture of defensive Jihad to justify a more aggressive one. In the treatise, compiled to justify Jihad pursued by Dir'iyyah and its allies, Ibn 'Abd al-Wahhab excommunicated the inhabitants of Huraymila and declared it as a duty of Wahhabi soldiers to fight them as apostates. He also quoted several \"Qur'anic\" verses indicative of offensive forms of jih\u0101d.\nCapture of Riyadh and Retirement (1773).\nThe last point of serious threat to the Saudi state was in 1764-1765. During this period, the Ism\u0101\u02bf\u012bl\u012b Sh\u012b\u02bfa of Najr\u0101n alongside their allied tribe of 'Ujman, combined forces to inflict a major defeat on the Saudis at the Battle of Hair in October 1764, killing around 500 men. The anti-Wahhabi forces allied with the invaders and participated in the combined siege of Dir\u02bfiyya. However, the defenders were able to hold onto their town due to the unexpected departure of the Najranis after a truce concluded with the Saudis. A decade later in 1773-'4, 'Abd al-Azeez had conquered Riyadh and secured the entirety of al-\u02bf\u0100ri\u1e0d, after its chieftain Dahham ibn Dawwas fled. By 1776/7, Sulayman ibn Abd al-Wahhab had surrendered. The capture of Riyadh marked the point at which Muhammad Ibn 'Abd al-Wahhab delegated all affairs of governing to 'Abd al-Azeez, withdrew from public life and devoted himself to teaching, preaching and worshipping. Meanwhile, 'Abd al-Azeez would proceed with his military campaigns, conquering towns like Sudayr (1196/1781), al-Kharj (1199/1784), etc. Opposition in towns to the North like al-Qa\u1e63\u012bm was stamped out by 1196/1781, and the rebels in \u02bfUnayza were subdued by 1202/1787. Further north, the town of \u1e24\u0101\u02beil, was captured in 1201/1786 and by the 1780s; Wahh\u0101b\u012bs were able to establish their jurisdiction over most of Najd.\nDeath.\nAfter his departure from public affairs, Ibn 'Abd al-Wahhab would remain a consultant to 'Abd al-Azeez, who followed his recommendations. However, he withdrew from any active military and political activities of the Emirate of Diriyah and devoted himself to educational endeavours, preaching, and worship. His last major activity in state affairs was in 1202/1787; when he called on the people to give \"bay'ah\" (allegiance) to Su\u02bf\u016bd, \u02bfAbd al-\u02bfAz\u012bz's son, as heir apparent.\nMuhammad ibn 'Abd al-Wahhab fell ill and died in June 1792 C.E or 1206 A.H in the lunar month of Dhul-Qa'dah, at the age of eighty-nine. He was buried in an unmarked grave at al-Turayf in al-Dir'iyya. He left behind four daughters and six sons. Many of his sons became clerics of greater or lesser distinction. The descendants of Muhammad ibn Abd al-Wahhab are known as the Aal Ash-Shaykhs and they continued to hold a special position in the Saudi state throughout its history, which still continues.\nA clear separation of roles between the Saudi family and the Wahhabi clerics had begun to emerge during the interval between Ibn 'Abd al-Wahhab's retirement from front-line politics in 1773 and his death in 1792. Although the Aal Ash-Shaykhs did not engage in politics, they comprised a significant part of the designating group of notables who gave allegiance (\"bay'ah\") to a new ruler and acclaimed his accession. After Ibn 'Abd al-Wahhab, his son 'Abd Allah, recognised by his critics as moderate and fair-minded, would succeed him as the dominant Wahhabi cleric. The Wahhabi cause would flourish for more than two decades after Ibn 'Abd al-Wahhab's death; until the defeat of the First Saudi State in the Ottoman-Saudi war. 'Abd Allah would spend his last days as an exile in Cairo, having witnessed the destruction of Dir\u02bfiyya and the execution of his talented son Sulayman ibn 'Abd Allah in 1818.\nFamily.\nAccording to academic publications such as the \"Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica\", Ibn \u02bfAbd al-Wahhab married an affluent woman during his studies in Baghdad. When she died, he inherited her property and wealth. Muhammad ibn \u02bfAbd al-Wahhab had six sons; Hussain (died 1809), 'Abdallah (1751\u20131829), Hassan, Ali (died 1829), Ibrahim and 'Abdulazeez who died in his youth. Four of his sons, Hussain, Abdullah, Ali and Ibrahim, established religious schools close to their home in Dir'iyah and taught the young students from Yemen, Oman, Najd and other parts of Arabia at their \"majlis\" (study circle). One of their pupils was Husayn Ibn Abu Bakr Ibn Ghannam, a well-known Hanbali scholar and chronicler. (Although Islamic scholar ibn 'Uthaymin writes about Ibn Ghannam that he was a Maliki scholar from al-Ahsa.)\nIbn 'Abd al-Wahhab also had a daughter named Fatimah, who was a revered Islamic scholar known for her piety, valour and beauty. She was a committed adherent to her father's reformist ideals and taught numerous men and women. Fatimah travelled a lot and remained unmarried throughout her life in order to research hadith sciences and concentrate on her scholarly endeavours. She witnessed the Fall of Dir'iyah, and in 1818 fled to Ras al-Khaimah, which was captured by the British the following year. As a result, she was again forced to emigrate along with her nephew; this time to Oman, wherein she became a major proponent of reformist teachings of the \"Muwahhidun\" and campaigned against various superstitions. Fatimah returned to Riyadh after the establishment of Emirate of Nejd in 1824. Due to her travels, she was often referred to by her appellation \"Lady of the Two Migrations\". As the daughter of Ibn 'Abd al-Wahhab, Fatimah became a role model for Arabian women active in educational efforts and various social undertakings.\nThe descendants of Ibn \u02bfAbd al-Wahhab, the Al ash-Sheikh, have historically led the \"ulama\" (clerical establishment) of the Saudi state, dominating the state's religious institutions. Within Saudi Arabia, the family is held in prestige similar to the Saudi royal family, with whom they share power, and has included several religious scholars and officials. The arrangement between the two families is based on the Al Saud maintaining the Al ash-Sheikh's authority in religious matters and upholding and propagating the Salafi doctrine. In return, the Al ash-Sheikh support the Al Saud's political authority thereby using its religious-moral authority to legitimize the royal family's rule.\nViews.\nOn \"Tawhid\".\nMuhammad Ibn \u02bfAbd al-Wahhab sought to revive and purify Islam from what he perceived as non-Islamic popular religious beliefs and practices by returning to what, he believed, were the fundamental principles of the Islamic religion. His works were generally short, full of quotations from the \"Qur'an\" and \"Hadith\", such as his main and foremost theological treatise, \"Kit\u0101b at-Taw\u1e25\u012bd\" (; \"The Book of Oneness\"). He taught that the primary doctrine of Islam was the uniqueness and oneness of God (\"tawhid\"), and denounced those religious beliefs and practices widespread amongst the people of Najd. Following Ibn Taymiyya's teachings on \"Tawhid\", Ibn 'Abd al-Wahhab believed that much of Najd had descended into superstitious folk religion akin to the period of \"Jahiliyya\" (pre-Islamic era) and denounced much of their beliefs as polytheism (\"shirk\"). He associated such practices with the culture of \"Taqlid\" (imitation to established customs) adored by pagan-cults of \"Jahiliyya\" era. Based on the doctrine of \"Tawhid\" espoused in \"Kitab al-Tawhid\", the followers of Ibn 'Abd al-Wahhab referred themselves by the designation \"Al-Muwahhidun\" (Unitarians).\nThe \"core\" of Ibn \u02bfAbd al-Wahhab's teaching is found in \"Kit\u0101b at-Taw\u1e25\u012bd\", a theological treatise which draws from material in the \"Qur'an\" and the recorded doings and sayings of the Islamic prophet Muhammad in the Hadith literature. It preaches that worship in Islam includes conventional acts of worship such as the five daily prayers (\"Salat\"); fasting (\"Sawm\"); supplication (\"Dua\"); seeking protection or refuge (\"Istia'dha\"); seeking help (\"Ist'ana\" and \"Istigatha\") of Allah.\nAccording to David Commins, various Muslims throughout history had held the view that declaring the testimony of faith is sufficient in becoming a Muslim. Ibn 'Abd al-Wahhab did not agree with this. He asserted that an individual who believed in the existence of intercessors or intermediaries alongside God was guilty of \"shirk\" (polytheism or idolatry). This was the major difference between him and his opponents, and led him to label his adversaries who engaged in folk rituals associated with such beliefs to be apostates (a practice known in Islamic jurisprudence as \"takfir\") and idolaters (\"mushrikin\").\nAnother major doctrine of Ibn 'Abd al-Wahhab was the concept known as \"Al-'Udhr bil Jahl\" (excuse of ignorance), wherein any ignorant person unaware of core Islamic teachings is excused by default until clarification. As per this doctrine, those who fell into beliefs of \"shirk\" (polytheism) or \"kufr\" (disbelief) cannot be excommunicated until they have direct access to scriptural evidences and get the opportunity to understand their mistakes and retract. If not, their affairs are to be delegated only to God. Hence, he believed that education and dialogue was the only effective path for the successful implementation of reforms. Explaining this concept in various pamphlets addressed to the masses and other scholars, Ibn 'Abd al-Wahhab declared:\"What has been mentioned to you about me, that I make generalised \"takf\u012br\", this is from the slanders of the enemies.. [Rather] we make \"takf\u012br\" of the one who affirms the religion of All\u0101h and His Messenger but then showed enmity towards it and hindered people from it; as well as the one who worshipped idols after he came to know that this is the religion of the polytheists and beautified it for the people [inviting them to it].. [In fact] every scholar on the face of the Earth makes \"takf\u012br\" of them, save an obstinate or ignorant... But we [only] make \"takf\u012br\" of the one who associates partners with All\u0101h in His sole right of worship (il\u0101hiyyah), after we have made clear to him the proof for the futility of \"shirk\".\"\nRejecting the allegations of his detractors who accused him of ex-communicating whoever didn't follow his doctrines, Ibn 'Abd al-Wahhab maintained that he only advocated orthodox Sunni doctrines. In a letter addressed to the Iraqi scholar Abdul Rahman Al-Suwaidi who had sought clarification over the rumours spread against his mission, Ibn 'Abd al-Wahhab explains:\"I am a man of social standing in my village and the people respect my word. This led some chieftains to reject my call, because I called them to what contradicts the traditions they were raised to uphold... the chieftains directed their criticism and enmity towards our enjoining \"Tawheed\" and forbidding \"Shirk\"... Among the false accusations they propagated, ... is the claim that I accuse all Muslims, except my followers, of being Kuffar (Unbelievers)... This is truly incredible. How can any sane person accept such accusations? Would a Muslim say these things? I declare that I renounce, before Allah, these statements that only a mad person would utter. In short, what I was accused of calling to, other than enjoining Tawheed and forbidding Shirk, is all false.\"\nOn \"Taqlid\".\nMuhammad ibn 'Abd al-Wahhab was highly critical of the practice of \"Taqlid\" (blind-following), which in his view, deviated people away from \"Qur'an\" and \"Sunnah\". He also advocated for \"Ijtihad\" of qualified scholars in accordance with the teachings of \"Qur'an\" and \"Hadith\". In his legal writings, Ibn 'Abd al-Wahhab referred to a number of sources- \"Qur'an\", \"hadith\", opinions of companions, \"Salaf\" as well as the treatises of the 4 schools of thought. Ibn 'Abd al-Wahhab argued that Qur'an condemned blind emulation of forefathers and nowhere did it stipulate scholarly credentials for a person to refer to it directly. His advocacy of \"Ijtihad\" and harsh denunciation of \"Taqlid\" arose widespread condemnation from Sufi orthodoxy in Najd and beyond, compelling him to express many of his legal verdicts (\"fatwas\") discreetly, using convincing juristic terms. He differed from Hanbali school in various points of law and in some cases, also departed from the positions of the 4 schools. In his treatise \"Usul al-Sittah\" (Six Foundations), Ibn 'Abd al-Wahhab vehemently rebuked his detractors for raising the description of \"Mujtahids\" to what he viewed as humanely unattainable levels. He condemned the establishment clergy as a class of oppressors who ran a \"tyranny of wordly possessions\" by exploiting the masses to make money out of their religious activities. The teachings of Medinan hadith scholar Muhammad Hayat as Sindi highly influenced the anti-taqlid views of Ibn 'Abd al Wahhab.\nMuhammad Ibn Abd al-Wahhab opposed partisanship to \"madhabs\" (legal schools) and didn't consider it obligatory to follow a particular madhab. Rather, in his view, the obligation is to follow \"Qur'an\" and the \"Sunnah\". Referring to the classical scholars Ibn Taymiyya and Ibn Qayyim, ibn 'Abd al-Wahhab condemned the popular practice prevalent amongst his contemporary scholars to blindfollow latter-day legal works and urged Muslims to take directly from Qur'an and Sunnah. He viewed it as a duty upon every Muslim, laymen and scholar, male &amp; female, to seek knowledge directly from the sources. Radically departing from both Ibn Taymiyya and Ibn Qayyim, Ibn 'Abd al-Wahhab viewed the entirety of the prevalent \"mad'hab\" system of jurisprudence (\"Fiqh\") as a fundamentally corrupt institution, seeking a radical reform of scholarly institutions and preached the obligation of all Muslims to directly refer to the foundational texts of revelation. He advocated a form of scholarly authority based upon the revival of the practice of \"ittiba\", i.e., laymen following the scholars only after seeking evidences. The prevalent legal system was, in his view, a \"factory for the production of slavish emulators\" symbolic of Muslim decline.\nOn the nature of \"Nubuwwah\" (Prophethood).\nMuhammad Ibn 'Abd al-Wahhab elucidated his concept on the nature of Prophethood in his book \"Mukhta\u1e63ar s\u012brat al-Ras\u016bl\" (\"Abridgement of the life of the Prophet\"), an extensive biographical work on the Islamic prophet Muhammad. \"Mukhta\u1e63ar\" was written with the purpose of explaining Muhammad's role in universal history by undermining certain prophetologic conceptions that had come to prominence among Sunn\u012b religious circles during the twelfth Islamic century. These included negating those concepts and beliefs that bestowed the Prophet with mystical attributes that elevated Muhammad beyond the status of ordinary humans. In his introduction to \"Mukhtasar\", Ibn 'Abd al-Wahhab asserts that every Prophet came with the mission of upholding \"Tawhid\" and prohibiting \"shirk\". Ibn 'Abd al-Wahhab further tries to undermine the belief in the pre-existence of Mu\u1e25ammad as a divine light preceding all other creation, a salient concept that served as an aspect of Prophetic devotion during the eleventh Islamic century. Additionally, Ibn \u02bfAbd al-Wahh\u0101b omitted mentioning other episodes narrated in various \"sirah\" (Prophetic biography) works such as trees and stones allegedly expressing veneration for Mu\u1e25ammad, purification of Muhammad's heart by angels, etc. which suggested that Mu\u1e25ammad possessed characteristics that transcend those of ordinary humans.\nIbn 'Abd al-Wahhab adhered to Ibn Taymiyya's understanding of the concept of \"Isma\" (infallibility) which insisted that \"\u02bfi\u1e63ma\" does not prevent prophets from committing minor sins or speaking false things. This differed from the alternative understanding of Sunni theologians like Fakhr al-D\u012bn al-R\u0101zi, Q\u0101\u1e0d\u012b \u02bfIy\u0101\u1e0d, etc. who had emphasised the complete independence of the Prophet from any form of error or sin.\nFurthermore, Ibn 'Abd al-Wahhab had given little importance to Prophetic miracles in his \"Mukhta\u1e63ar\". Although he hadn't denied miracles as an expression of Divine Omnipotence so long as they are attested by \"Qur'an\" or authentic \"hadith\", \"Al-Mukhtasar\" represented an open protest against the exuberance of miracles that characterised later biographies of Mu\u1e25ammad. In Ibn 'Abd al-Wahhab's view, miracles are of little significance in the life of Mu\u1e25ammad in comparison to that of the previous prophets, since central to his prophethood were the institutionalisation of \"Jih\u0101d\" and the \"\u1e25udud\" punishments. Contrary to prevalent religious beliefs, Mu\u1e25ammad was not portrayed as the central purpose of creation in the historical conception of \"Mukhta\u1e63ar\". Instead, he has a function within creation and for the created beings. Rather than being viewed as an extraordinary performer of miracles, Muhammad should instead be upheld as a model of emulation. By depriving the person of Mu\u1e25ammad of all supernatural aspects not related to \"Wahy\" (revelation) and Divine intervention, Ibn 'Abd al-Wahhab also re-inforced his rejection of beliefs and practices related to cult of saints and veneration of graves. Thus, Ibn \u02bfAbd al-Wahh\u0101b's conception of history emphasised the necessity to follow the role-model of Mu\u1e25ammad and re-establish the Islamic order.\nInfluence on Salafism.\nIbn \u02bfAbd al-Wahhab's movement is known today as Wahhabism (). The designation of his doctrine as \"Wahh\u0101biyyah\" actually derives from his father's name, \u02bfAbd al-Wahhab. Many adherents consider the label \"Wahhabism\" as a derogatory term coined by his opponents, and prefer it to be known as the Salafi movement. Modern scholars of Islamic studies point out that \"Salafism\" is a term applied to several forms of puritanical Islam in various parts of the world, while Wahhabism refers to the specific Saudi school, which is seen as a more strict form of Salafism. However, modern scholars remark that Ibn 'Abd al-Wahhab's followers adopted the term \"Salafi\" as a self-designation much later. His early followers denominated themselves as \"Ahl al-Tawhid\" and \"al-Muwahhidun\" (\"Unitarians\" or \"those who affirm/defend the unity of God\"), and were labeled \"Wahhabis\" by their opponents.\nThe \"Salafiyya\" movement was not directly connected to Ibn 'Abd al-Wahhab's movement in Najd. According to professor Abdullah Saeed, Ibn \u02bfAbd al-Wahhab should rather be considered as one of the \"precursors\" of the modern \"Salafiyya\" movement since he called for a return to the pristine purity of the early eras of Islam by adhering to the \"Qur'an\" and the \"Sunnah\", rejection of the blind following (\"Taqlid\") of earlier scholars and advocating for \"Ijtihad\". Scholars like Adam J. Silverstein consider Wahhabi movement as \"the most influential expression of Salafism of the Islamist sort, both for its role in shaping (some might say: 'creating') modern Islamism, and for disseminating \"salafi\" ideas widely across the Muslim world.\"\nOn \"Fiqh\".\nMuhammad Ibn 'Abd al-Wahhab's approach to \"Fiqh\" (Islamic jurisprudence) was based on four major principles:\nAccording to Ibn 'Abd al-Wahhab, the clear meaning of authentic \"hadiths\" takes precedence over the opinions of any other scholar, even if it went against the agreement of the eponyms of the four \"madhabs\". In line with these principles, he encouraged all believers to engage directly with the Scriptures while respecting \"Ikhtilaf\" (scholarly differences), writing:\"The companions of the Messenger of God, may God bless him and grant him peace, differed on various issues without denunciation, so long as the text was not clear. It is upon the believer to place his concern and intent to know the command of God and His Messenger in those matters of disagreement, and to act accordingly whilst respecting the people of knowledge, and respect them, even if they erred, but he does not take them as lords besides God; This is the way of those who are blessed. As for those who throw away their speech and do not respect, then this is the path of those who have incurred God's wrath.\"\nThroughout his epistles like \"Arba\u02bf qaw\u0101\u02bfid tad\u016bru\u02bel-a\u1e25k\u0101m \u02bfalayh\u0101\" (Four rules on which rulings revolve), Ibn 'Abd al-Wahhab fiercely attacked the prevalent Hanbali Fiqh opinions; with a broader view of re-orienting the Fiqh tradition. Ibn 'Abd al-Wahhab challenged the \"madhhab\" system, by advocating for a direct understanding of the Scriptures. Rather than rejecting \"madhabs\" outright, he sought a reformation of the system by condemning prevalent trends within the \"madhabs\". He criticised the \"madhhab\" partisans for adhering solely to medieval \"Fiqh\" manuals of later scholars and ignoring \"Qur'an\", \"Hadith\" and opinions of early Imams. He rebuked the contemporary Shafi'i scholars for being partisans of Ibn Hajar al Haytami (d. 1566) and relying solely on his 16th-century manual \"Tuhfat al Muhtaj\". Similarly, he critiqued the Malikis for being dependent on the \"Mukhtasar\" of the Egyptian jurist Khalil ibn Ishaq (d. 1365) rather than acting upon authentic traditions (\"hadith\"). In addition to criticising the Madhab partisans, he berated the advocates of \"Taqlid\" for discouraging the practice of \"Ijtihad\" and called on the laity to follow scholars only after asking for Scriptural evidences. Most noticeably, Ibn 'Abd al-Wahhab rejected the authority of \"Al-Iqna\" and \"Al-Muntaha\" - two of the most important medieval Hanbali works for the regional clerics of Arabia - asserting:\"The Hanbalis are the least prone of all people to innovation. [Yet] most of the \"Iqna\" and the \"Muntah\u0101\" [two late Hanbali authoritative works] conflicts with the view of Ahmad and his explicit statements, not to mention the hadith of the Messenger of God\"\nIn calling for a direct return to the Scriptures, Ibn 'Abd al-Wahhab was not a literalist and often strongly objected to literalist approaches and ritualism of religion that came with it. He believed that pure intentions (\"Niyyah\") constituted the essence of all virtous actions and upheld its superiority over dull ritualism. As a deferential and accomplished jurist with the experience of religious training under numerous masters in his travels, Ibn 'Abd al-Wahhab opposed the rigid, hardline views of the tradition-bound \"ulema\" who had excommunicated sinful, unrepenting Muslims; thereby making their blood forfeit based on their reading of the reports of Muhammad and Companions. On the other hand, Ibn 'Abd al-Wahhab contextualised those reports; arguing that they must be understood in recognition of historical circumstances. According to his view, sincerity and purity of intent (\"Ikhlas\") could expiate the evil of sins committed in mistakes. Ibn 'Abd al-Wahhab's legal approach began with \"hadith\" authentication, followed by contextualised intrapolation in consideration of Hanbali legal principles such as \"Maslaha\" (common good). Other legal criteria involved upholding the spirit of the law, \"Maqasid al-Sharia\", and intent behind pronouncing legal verdicts which addressed various themes such as societal justice and safeguarding women. He also believed in a holistic legal understanding of \"Qur'anic\" verses and \"hadith\", distinguishing between general rules applicable for all Muslims and rulings unique to various life-time situations.\nOn Islamic revival.\nAs a young scholar in Medina, Muhammad Ibn 'Abd al-Wahhab was profoundly influenced by the revivalist doctrines taught by his teachers Muhammad Hayyat ibn Ibrahim al-Sindhi and Abdullah Ibn Ibrahim Ibn Sayf. Much of the Wahhabi teachings such as opposition to saint-cults, radical denunciation of blind-following medieval commentaries, adherence to Scriptures and other revivalist thoughts came from Muhammad Hayyat. Ibn Abd al-Wahhab's revivalist efforts were based on a strong belief in \"Tawhid\" (Oneness of Allah) and a firm adherence to the Sunnah. His reformative efforts left exemplary marks on contemporary Islamic scholarship. Viewing Blind adherence ( \"Taqlid\" ) as an obstacle to the progress of Muslims, he dedicated himself to educating the masses for them to be vanguards of Islam. According to Ibn Abd al-Wahhab, the degradation and lagging behind of Muslims was due to their neglect of the teachings of Islam, emphasizing that progress could be achieved only by firmly adhering to Islam. He also campaigned against popular Sufi practices associated with \"istigatha\", myths and superstitions.\nOn Sufism.\nIbn \u02bfAbd al-Wahhab praised Tasawwuf. He stated the popular saying: \"From among the wonders is to find a Sufi who is a \"faqih\" and a scholar who is an ascetic (\"zahid\")\". He described Tasawwuf as \"the science of the deeds of the heart, which is known as the science of \"Suluk\"\", and considered it as an important branch of Islamic religious sciences.\nAt the end of his treatise, \"Al-Hadiyyah al-Suniyyah\", Ibn \u02bfAbd al-Wahhab's son 'Abd Allah speaks positively on the practice of \"tazkiah\" (purification of the inner self). 'Abd Allah Ibn \u02bfAbd al-Wahhab ends his treatise saying:\nWe do not negate the way of the Sufis and the purification of the inner self from the vices of those sins connected to the heart and the limbs as long as the individual firmly adheres to the rules of Shari'ah and the correct and observed way. However, we will not take it on ourselves to allegorically interpret (\"ta'wil\") his speech and his actions. We only place our reliance on, seek help from, beseech aid from and place our confidence in all our dealings in Allah Most High. He is enough for us, the best trustee, the best \"mawla\" and the best helper. May Allah send peace on our master Muhammad, his family and companions.\nOn social reforms.\nMuhammad ibn 'Abd al-Wahhab concerned himself with the social reformation of his people. As an 18th-century reformer, Muhammad ibn 'Abd al Wahhab called for the re-opening of \"Ijtihad\" by qualified persons through strict adherence to Scriptures in reforming society. His thoughts reflected the major trends apparent in the 18th-century Islamic reform movements. Unlike other reform movements which were restricted to \"da'wa\", Ibn 'Abd al-Wahhab was also able to transform his movement into a successful Islamic state. Thus, his teachings had a profound influence on majority of Islamic reform-revivalist movements since the 18th century. Numerous significant socio-economic reforms would be advocated by the \"Imam\" during his lifetime. His reforms touched over various fields such as \"aqeeda\", \"ibaadat\" (ritual acts of worship), \"muamalaat\" (social interactions), etc. In the affairs of \"mu'amalat\", he harshly rebuked the practice of leaving endowments to prevent the rightful heirs (particularly the females) from receiving their deserved inheritance. He also objected to various forms of \"riba\" (usury) as well as the practice of presenting judges with gifts, which according to him, was nothing more than bribing. He also opposed and brought an end to numerous un-Islamic taxes that were forced upon the people.\nOn women.\nThe legal writings of Ibn 'Abd al-Wahhab reflected a general concern of female welfare and justice. In line with this approach, Ibn 'Abd al-Wahhab denounced the practice of instant \"triple talaq\", counting it as only a single \"talaq\" (regardless of the number of pronouncements). The outlawing of \"triple talaq\" is considered to be one of the most significant reforms across the Islamic World in the 20th and 21st centuries. Following a balanced approach in issues of gender, Ibn Abd al-Wahhab advocated moderation between men and women in social interactions as well as spirituality. According to Ibn Abd al-Wahhab, women has a place in society with both rights and responsibility, with the society being obliged to respect her status and protect her. He also condemned forced marriages and declared any marriage contracted without the consent of a woman (be it minor, virgin or non-virgin) to be \"invalid\". This too was a significant reform as well as a break from the four Sunni schools which allowed the \"wali\" (ward/guardian) to compel minor daughters into marriage without consent. Ibn Abd al-Wahhab also stipulated the permission of the guardian as a condition in marriage (in line with traditional Hanbali, Shafi'i and Maliki schools). Nevertheless, as a practical jurist, Ibn Abd al-Wahhab allowed guardians to delegate the right to contract marriages to women herself, after which his permission cannot be denied. He also allowed women the right to stipulate favourable conditions for her in the marriage contract. Ibn Abd al-Wahhab also defended the woman's right to divorce through \"Khul\"' for various reasons, including in cases wherein she despised her husband. He also prohibited the killing of women, children and various non-combatants such as monks, elderly, blind, \"shaykhs\", slaves and peasants in warfare.\nIn addition to these, Ibn Abd al-Wahhab also defended married women's right to maintenance from her husband; as well as bride's right to receive \"mahr\" from her groom. He also strongly campaigned against domestic abuses against women, enjoining men to treat their wives with kindness.\nMuhammad ibn Abd al-Wahhab believed in social participation of women for communal solidarity; as per Islamic codes of modesty (\"Haya\") that was inclusive to all sections of society, especially the poor. He also campaigned for improving female literacy and asserted women's education as part of their religious rights and duties. Educated elite women played an important role in the Wahhabi movement through social activism and in various instances also weld significant political influence. Many women were trained in various religious disciplines, memorising \"Qur'an\" and being proficient in hadith sciences; which gained them civic respect as well as a source of income by teaching. As a result, the townsfolk of 19th-century Central Arabia had noticeably higher rates of literacy as observed by foreign travellers. Ibn Abd al-Wahhab also encouraged educated women to be active in various communal activities so as to bolster the reformist campaigns of the \"Muwahhidun\", educating other women, generating awareness of superstitions as well as other cultural activities such as reciting poetry, playing tambourine during feasts, weddings and various social gatherings. Ibn Abd al-Wahhab's own daughter, Fatima was an influential Islamic scholar active in social and communal affairs and would influence subsequent generations of Arabian women.\nOn Jihad.\nMuhammad Ibn \u02bfAbd al-Wahh\u0101b defined jihad as an activity that must have a valid religious justification and which can only be declared by an \"Imam\" whose purpose must be strictly defensive in nature. He viewed the military campaigns of the Emirate of Dir\u02bfiyya as strictly defensive operations against aggressive opponents who initiated \"Takfir\" against his followers. Justifying the Wahhabi military campaigns as primarily defensive operations, Ibn Abd al-Wahhab asserts:\"As for warfare, until today, we did not fight anyone, except in defense of our lives and honor. They came to us in our area and did not spare any effort in fighting us. We only initiated fighting against some of them in retaliation for their continued aggression, [\"The recompense for an evil is an evil like thereof\"] (42:40)... they are the ones who started declaring us to be unbelievers and fighting us\"\nOn Muslim saints.\nIbn \u02bfAbd al-Wahhab strongly condemned the veneration of Muslim saints (which he described as worship) or associating divinity to beings other than God, labeling it as \"shirk\". Despite his great aversion to venerating the saints after their earthly passing and seeking their intercession, it should nevertheless be noted that Muhammad ibn Abd al-Wahhab did not deny the existence of saints as such; on the contrary, he acknowledged that \"the miracles of saints (\"kar\u0101m\u0101t al-awliy\u0101\u02be\") are not to be denied, and their right guidance by God is acknowledged\" when they acted properly during their life. Muhammad ibn Abd al-Wahhab opposed the practice of pilgrimage of saints' tombs as it is considered as Bid\u02bbah (heresy), such as the practice of the pilgrimage towards a tomb believed belong to a companion of the Prophet named Dhiraar ibn al-Azwar in the valley of Ghobaira.\nOn non-Muslims.\nAccording to the political scientist Dore Gold, Muhammad ibn Abd al-Wahhab presented a strong anti-Christian and anti-Judaic stance in his main theological treatise \"Kit\u0101b at-Taw\u1e25\u012bd\", describing the followers of both Christian and Jewish faiths as sorcerers who believe in devil-worship, and by citing a hadith attributed to the Islamic prophet Muhammad he stated that capital punishment for the sorcerer is \"that he be struck with the sword\". Ibn Abd al-Wahhab asserted that both the Christian and Jewish religions had improperly made the graves of their prophet into places of worship and warned Muslims not to imitate this practice. Ibn Abd al-Wahhab concluded that \"The ways of the People of the Book are condemned as those of polytheists.\"\nHowever, Western scholar Natana J. DeLong-Bas defended the position of Muhammad ibn Abd al-Wahhab, stating that:\ndespite his at times vehement denunciations of other religious groups for their supposedly heretical beliefs, Ibn Abd al Wahhab never called for their destruction or death ... he assumed that these people would be punished in the Afterlife ...\"\nReception.\nBy contemporaries.\nThe doctrines of Ibn Abd al-Wahhab were criticized by a number of Islamic scholars during his lifetime, accusing him of disregarding Islamic history, monuments, traditions and the sanctity of Muslim life. His critics were mainly \"ulama\" from his homeland, the Najd region of central Arabia, which was directly affected by the growth of the Wahhabi movement, based in the cities of Basra, Mecca, and Medina. Some of the early opponents of Ibn Abd al-Wahhab classified his doctrine as a \"Kharijite sectarian heresy\".\nOn the other hand, Ibn Abd al-Wahh\u0101b and his supporters held that they were the victims of aggressive warfare; accusing their opponents of starting the pronouncements of \"Takfir\" (excommunication) and maintained that the military operations of Emirate of Dir\u02bfiyya were strictly defensive. The memory of the unprovoked military offensive launched by Dahh\u0101m ibn Daww\u0101s (fl. 1187/1773), the powerful chieftain of Riyadh, on Diriyya in 1746 was deeply engrained in the Wahhabi tradition. Early Wahhabi chronicler Ibn Ghann\u0101m states in his book \"Tarikh an-Najd\" (History of Najd) that Ibn Abd al-Wahh\u0101b did not order the use of violence until his enemies excommunicated him and deemed his blood licit:\"He gave no order to spill blood or to fight against the majority of the heretics and the misguided until they started ruling that he and his followers were to be killed and excommunicated.\"\nBy 1802, the Ottoman Empire had officially begun to wage religious campaigns against the Wahhabis, issuing tracts condemning them as \"Kharijites\". In contrast, Ibn Abd al-Wahhab profoundly despised the \"decorous, arty tobacco-smoking, music happy, drum pounding, Egyptian and Ottoman nobility who traveled across Arabia to pray at Mecca each year\", and intended to either subjugate them to his doctrine or overthrow them. A handful of Arabian Hanbalis participated on the Ottoman side of the controversy. Muhammad ibn 'Abdullah ibn Humayd's 19th century biographical dictionary sheds light on those Hanbali scholars. However, the reliability of his biography itself is disputed for its inherent biases, which portrays Ibn Abd al-Wahhab and his followers as heretics. It also misrepresents many Najdi Hanbali scholars as on the side of Ottoman Hanbalis.\nIbn Humayd's maternal lineage, Al-Turki, was of some local renown for its religious scholars, including two men who opposed the Wahhabi movement. One of them, named Ibn Muhammad, compared Ibn Abd al-Wahhab with Musaylimah. He also accused Ibn Abd al-Wahhab of wrongly declaring fellow Muslims to be infidels based on a misguided reading of Quranic passages and prophetic traditions (\"Hadith\"), and of wrongly declaring all scholars as infidels who did not agree with his \"deviant innovation\". In contrast to this anti-Wahhabi family tradition, Ibn Humayd's early education included extensive studies under two Wahhabi Shaykhs, both praised in his biographical dictionary. He then travelled to Damascus and Mecca, wherein he attended lessons of men known for strong anti-Wahhabi convictions. Ibn Humayd's compatibility with Ottoman religious outlook made him eligible for the post of Ottoman Mufti in Mecca.\nAnother Hanbali scholar whom Ibn Humayd portrays as a central figure in rejecting Ibn Abd al-Wahhab's doctrine was Ibn Fayruz Al-Tamimi al-Ahsai (1729/30 \u2013 1801/02). Ibn Fayruz publicly repudiated Ibn Abd al-Wahhab's teachings when he sent an envoy to him. Ibn Fayruz then wrote to Sultan Abdul Hamid I and requested Ottoman assistance to subjugate Ibn Abd al-Wahhab's followers, whom he referred to as the \"seditious Kharijites\" of Najd. The Wahhabis, in turn, came to view him as one of their worst enemies and an exemplar of idolatry.\nAccording to Ibn Humayd, Ibn Abd al-Wahhab's father criticized his son for his unwillingness to specialize in jurisprudence and disagreed with his doctrine and declared that he would be the cause of wickedness. Similarly his brother, Sulayman ibn Abd al-Wahhab, wrote one of the first treatises refuting the Wahhabi doctrine, \"The Divine Thunderbolts in Refutation of Wahhabism\" (\"Al-\u0160aw\u0101'iq Al-Il\u0101hiyya f\u012b Al-radd 'al\u0101 Al-Wahh\u0101biyya\"), alleging that Muhammad was ill-educated and intolerant, and classing his views as fringe and fanatical. Sulayman's first anti-Wahhabi treatise was followed by a second book, \"The Unmistakable Judgment in the Refutation of Muhammad ibn 'Abd al-Wahhab\" (\"Fa\u1e63l al-\u1e2ai\u1e6d\u0101b f\u012b Al-radd 'al\u0101 Mu\u1e25ammad ibn 'Abd al-Wahh\u0101b\"). Later \"Muwahhidun\" scholarly figures like Abdullah ibn Abd al-Latif Aal al-Shaykh (d. 1921 C.E) would respond to these accusations by asserting that Ibn Abd al-Wahhab refrained from making \"Takfir\": \" Shaykh Muhammad (May God have Mercy on him) never made takfeer of the people in the beginning; except via establishing the proofs and the da'wah, because at that time there was a dearth of knowledge of the message (of Isl\u0101m) and for that reason he said 'due to their ignorance and the lack of anyone who makes them aware'. However, as for those on whom the proofs are established, then there is nothing to prevent \"takfeer\" being made on such people\"\nMuhammad ibn Abd al-Wahhab was known to have had disagreements with both his father and his brother Sulayman.\n Sulayman, his brother, disputed many of his doctrinal statements and was one of his staunch opponents during a certain time-period. Ibn Abd al-Wahhab's father disagreed with his son's metholodolgy in implementing reforms. According to historical records, Sulayman declared his repentance and started to support his brother during later life, after understanding the doctrines and objectives of Ibn Abd al-Wahhab's revivalist movement.\nThe 19th century anti-Wahhabi critic and historian Ahmad ibn al-Zayni Dahlan, Ottoman empire's Grand Mufti of the Shafi'i madhab in Mecca, recorded the account of the dispute between Muhammad ibn \u02bfAbd al-Wahhab and his brother Sulayman, reporting that:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Sulayman [ibn \u02bfAbd al-Wahhab] once asked his brother Muhammad [ibn \u02bfAbd al-Wahhab], \"How many are the pillars of Islam?\" \"Five,\" he answered. Sulayman replied, \"No, you have added a sixth one: He who does not follow you is not a Muslim. This, to you, is the sixth pillar of Islam.\"\nAccording to various historical records, Sulayman repented and joined the religious mission of his brother. However, there is a disagreement regarding his repentance. While earlier Najdi chroniclers like Ibn Ghannam reported he repented and embraced Ibn 'Abd al-Wahhab's cause in Diriyah, later historians like Ibn Bishr simply mentions his departure to Diriyah with his family and his last years under the protection of Diriyah, while being allowed by state-allotted stipend. A letter attributed to Sulayman also mentions his public repentance.\nThe Ottoman Grand Mufti of Mecca, Ahmad Zayni Dahlan (d. 1886), wrote an anti-Wahhabi treatise, in which he listed the religious practices that the Najdi Hanbalis considered idolatrous: visiting the tomb of Muhammad, seeking the intercession of saints, venerating Muhammad and obtaining the blessings of saints. He also accused Ibn Abd al-Wahhab of not adhering to the Hanbali school and that he was deficient in learning. However, Ibn Abd al-Wahhab had believed that visiting the tomb of Muhammad was a righteous deed, referring to it as \"among the best of deeds\" while condemning its excesses. The medieval theologians Ibn Taymiyyah and Ibn Qayyim, who inspired Ibn Abd al-Wahhab, had issued \"Fatwas\" declaring the visitations to the tomb of Muhammad to be \"haram\" (forbidden); which would lead to their imprisonment.\nIn response, the British Indian \"Ahl-i Hadith\" scholar Muhammad Bashir Sahsawani (1834-1908 C.E) wrote the treatise \"Sayaanah al-Insaan an Waswaswah al-Shaikh Dahlaan\" in order to refute Dahlan. Sahsawani asserted that after his correspondence with various scholars of the \"Muwahhidun\" movement and study of their creedal works; he came to the conclusion that the allegation that they excommunicated \"non-Wahhabis\" were false and slanderous.\nThe Islamic scholar Muhammad Rashid Rida (d. 1935 C.E/ 1354 A.H) in his introduction to al-Sahsawani's refutation of Dahlan, described Ibn Abd al-Wahhab as a \"mujaddid\" repelling the innovations and deviations in Muslim life. Through his \"Al-Manar\" magazine, Rashid Rida greatly contributed to the spread of Ibn Abd al-Wahhab's teachings in the Islamic world. He was a strong supporter of Ibn Taymiyyah and scholars of Najd, publishing works in his magazine entitled \"Majmooah al-Rasaail wa al-Masaail al-Najdiyyah\" and \"al-Wahhaabiyoon wa al-Hijaaz.\" Rida notes that given Dahlan's position in Mecca, and availability there of the works of Ibn Abd al-Wahhab, he must have simply chosen to write otherwise. Rida also argued that Dahlan simply wrote what he heard from people, and criticised him for not verifying reports and seeking out the writings of Ibn Abd al-Wahhab. He condemned Dahlan for his ignorance and his sanctioning of acts of \"kufr\" and \"shirk\"; based on his reinterpretation of Islamic texts.\nRashid Rida contended that Ibn Abd al-Wahhab was a victim of persecution by the combined oppression of three forces: i) the power of state and its rulers ii) power of hypocritical scholars and iii) power of tyrannical commoners. Fiercely rebuking his opponents, Rashid Rida declared: \"The best weapon they brandished against him was that he contradicted the majority of Muslims. Who were the majority of Muslims Muhammad Ibn Abdul Wahhab contradicted in his \"Da'wah\"? They were Bedouins of the desert, worse than the people of \"Jahiliyyah\", intent on looting and theft. They allowed shedding the blood of Muslims and non-Muslims, just to earn a living. They took their tyrants as judges in every matter and denied many aspects of Islam on which there is consensus [especially among scholars], matters in which no Muslim can claim ignorance.\"\nAli Bey el Abbassi, a Spanish explorer who was in Mecca in 1803, shortly after the Wahhabi conquest of Hejaz, presented a starkly different view of the Wahhabis. He was surprised to find that they were fairly \"moderate, reasonable and civilized\". He further observed that, rather than engaging in rampant violence and destruction, the Wahhabis were pleasant and well-organized. According to Ali Bey, there were major differences in the political approach of Muhammad ibn Saud Al Muqrin, and that of his son, Abdulaziz bin Muhammad Al Saud, during whose reign Ibn Abd al-Wahhab was retired from active public life. Ali Bey asserts that unlike the fair-minded Muhammad Ibn Saud; his son 'Abd Al-Azeez began employing a \"convert or die\" approach for the acquirment of wealth and stabilising the state. Ali Bey writes in his \"Travels\": \"I discovered much reason and moderation among the Wehhabites to whom I spoke, and from whom I obtained the greater part of the information which I have given concerning their nation... The reformer Abdoulwehhab did not invest himself with any honour or public character: he was only the chief of the sect, and did not require any personal distinction. After his death, his son, who succeeded him, preserved the same simplicity.\"British diplomat Harford Jones-Brydges, who was stationed in Basra in 1784 attributed the popular hysteria about the Wahhabis to a different cause. Unlike Ottoman depictions, Brydges believed that Ibn Abd al-Wahhab's doctrine was in keeping with the teachings of Quran, was \"perfectly orthodox\", \"consonant to the purest and best interpretations of that volume\", and that Ottomans feared its spread precisely on that basis.\nThe Egyptian historian and Azhari Islamic scholar Abd al-Rahman al-Jabarti (1753\u20131825 C.E) was a great admirer of Ibn \u02bfAbd al-Wahhab and his movement. He defended his doctrines in Egypt and held the movement in high regard, viewing its doctrines as having a great prospective to spearhead future Islamic revival. Al-Jabarti had the chance to personally meet with various Wahhabi scholars in Egypt in 1814. Finding them to be friendly and knowledgeable, Al-Jabarti stated that the Wahhabis were \"modest men of good morals, well trained in oratory, in the principles of religion, the branches of fiqh, and the disagreements of the Schools of Law. In all this they were extraordinary.\" He described Ibn Abd al-Wahhab as a man who \"summoned men to \"Qur'an\" and the Prophet's \"Sunna\", bidding them to abandon innovations in worship\". Through his writings, Al-Jabarti repeatedly stressed that the beliefs and doctrines championed by Ibn Abd al-Wahhab were nothing other than orthodox Sunni Islam.\nMoroccan military leader 'Abd al-Karim al-Khattabi (1882-1963 C.E) praised Ibn Abd al-Wahhab's reform endeavour as a \"promising voice\" that sparked spiritual and intellectual Awakening across the Islamic World.\nProminent Syrian Hanbali scholar 'Abd al-Qadir ibn Badran (1864-1927 C.E/ 1280-1346 A.H) praised the efforts of Muhammad ibn Abd al-Wahhab in his treatise \"Al-Madkhal ila Madhhab il-Imam Ahmad ibn Hanbal\" (An Introduction to the Madhab of Imam Ahmad ibn Hanbal), writing: \"When he [i.e, Ibn 'Abd al Wahhab] learned the narrations and the \"Sunnah\" and became expertised in the \"madhab\" of Ahmad; he began supporting the Truth, fighting \"bid'ah\" and resisting what illiterates have made part of this monotheistic religion and \"Sharia\" of moderation\".\" Some people supported him and made their worship solely to The One God following his path, which was to establish pure \"Tawhid\", call sincerely to monotheism and direct worship in all of its forms solely to The Creator of creation alone. Some people resisted him; they were used to rigidity in following what their forefathers did and they armoured themselves with laziness instead of seeking the truth.\" \nModern reception.\nVarious academics have compared Muhammad ibn Abd al-Wahhab to the 15th-century German Christian pastor Martin Luther, for their efforts in launching socio-religious movements that challenged the authority of the dominant clerical and political hierarchy of their societies. Despite being adherents of different religions; both of them were inspired by their respective idealised visions of the past and shared similar themes such as the social and economic upliftment of their societies empowered through mass-education enabled by campaigns for open access to Scriptures. He is honoured by many scholars of the Salafi tradition as a juristic authority and source of reference. Salafi scholars Rashid Rida and Ibn Baz considered him a \"mujaddid\". Salafi scholar Al-Albani (d. 1999) praised him for his dawah movement in the Najd while also criticizing him for having a \"level of exaggeration and harshness\", as well as being \"weak in hadith and jurisprudence\". He asserted that Ibn Abd al-Wahhab was not a mujtahid in fiqh, accusing him of imitating the Hanbali school, and also challenged Ibn Abd al-Wahhab's credentials in the knowledge of hadith.\nAccording to the 20th-century Austro-Hungarian scholar Muhammad Asad, all modern Islamic Renaissance movements took inspiration from the spiritual impetus set in motion in the 18th century by Muhammad Ibn Abd al-Wahhab. Crediting Ibn Abd al-Wahhab for his contributions to Islamic Renaissance and spread of revolutionary ideals across the Muslim world, Tunisian Islamist intellectual Rached Gannouchi writes:\"Just as in the West in the age of Renaissance, the Muslim world was stirred by a great awakening. Muhammad bin Abd al-Wahhab's message of \"jihad\" and \"ijtihad\" inspired an unbroken movement... to push the umma towards \"jihad\" against its enemies, to abandon the guise of tradition (\"taqlid\") and to unite its divisions around the mystical origins of Islam and Islamic thought.\"Scholars of the Deobandi movement have held ambiguous views on Muhammad ibn Abd al-Wahhab. Rashid Ahmad Gangohi, one of the founders of the Deobandi school praised Ibn Abd al-Wahhab as a virtuous scholar who upheld the Sunnah and campaigned against polytheistic and superstitious beliefs and practices. Muhammad Zakariya, Muhammad Ilyas Kandhlawi, Yusuf Kandhalawi, etc. were supportive of Ibn Abd al-Wahhab's ideals. Senior Deobandi scholar Manzur Numani penned the treatise \"Sheikh Muhammad bin Abdul Wahhab ke Khilaf Propaganda\" (The Propaganda against Sheikh Muhammad bin Abdul Wahhab) in defense of Ibn Abd al-Wahhab. As such, some activists of Deobandi persuasion viewed Ibn Abd al-Wahhab's movement as an example for establishing an Islamic state in contemporary Muslim societies.\nHowever, other Deobandi scholars harshly criticized Ibn Abd al-Wahhab. Anwar Shah Kashmiri considered him a \"dull minded person with little knowledge\". In \"Al-Shihab al-Thaqib\", Hussain Ahmad Madani called Ibn Abd al-Wahhab a \"tyrant, rebel and blood spilling transgressor\". Mahmud Hasan Gangohi believed Ibn Abd al-Wahhab was initially a follower of the Sunnah, though later changed his objective to seize political power. Mahmud Ganhohi also claimed that Rashid Ahmad Gangohi had recanted his previous positive statements about Ibn Abd al-Wahhab when he read Ibn Abidin's refutation \"Radd al-Muhtar\" against Ibn Abd al-Wahhab.\nIslamic scholar Yusuf Al-Q\u0101r\u0101daw\u012b praised Muhammad ibn 'Abd al-Wahhab as a \"Mujaddid\" (religious reviver) of the Arabian Peninsula who defended the purity of \"Tawhid\" from various superstitions and polytheistic beliefs. Praising Ibn 'Abd al-Wahhab's efforts, Muhammad Rash\u012bd Rid\u00e1 wrote:\"Muhammad bin Abd al-Wahhab al-Najdi was one of those \"Mujaddids\", [who] called for the upholding of \"Tawhid\" and the sincerity of worship to God alone with what He legislated in His Book and on the tongue of His Messenger, the Seal of the Prophets; ... abandoning heresies and sins, establishing the abandoned rituals of Islam, and venerating its violated sanctities.\"\nIn his book \"Saviours of the Islamic Spirit\", Islamic scholar Abul Hasan Ali Nadwi (1913-1999 C.E) acclaimed Ibn 'Abd al-Wahhab as a \"great reformer\" who called his people to \"Tawhid\", revived injunctions based on \"Qur'an\" and \"Sunnah\" and eradicated superstitious rites prevalent amongst the illiterate masses of Central Arabia. Nadwi compared his movement to that of the contemporary South Asian Islamic revivalist Shah Waliullah Dehlawi (1703-1762 C.E/ 1114-1176 A.H) who had expounded similar ideas such as differentiating between \"Tawhid-i-Uluhiyyat\" (Oneness of Worship) and \"Tawhid-i-Rububiyat\" (Oneness of Lordship) and promotion of strict adherence to \"Qur'an\" and \"Hadith\". In Nadwi's opinion, Ibn Abd al-Wahhab was able to make outstanding efforts with far-reaching impact compared to other contemporary reformers since he played the role of a revolutionary reformer whose initiatives were implemented through a newly established Islamic state and thus his movement was highly pertinent for the people of his time.\nProfessor Satoru Nakamura of Kobe University believed that sectarian clerics were the first to initiate \"Takfir\" (excommunication) and sanction bloodshed against the followers of Ibn Abd al-Wahhab, forcing Ibn Abd al-Wahhab to launch a defensive Jihad, citing religious justifications in line with the principles of Islamic \"Wasitiyya\". In 2010, Prince Salman bin Abdulaziz, at the time serving as the governor of Riyadh, said that the doctrine of Muhammad Ibn Abd al-Wahhab was pure Islam, and said regarding his works:\"I dare anyone to bring a single alphabetical letter from the Sheikh's books that goes against the book of Allah and the teachings of his prophet, Muhammad.\"\nWestern Reception.\nDuring the early 21st century Western security discourse, Muhammad Ibn Abd al-Wahhab's movement, Wahhabism, was often associated with various Jihadi movements across the Islamic World. Various Western analysts claimed that the pan-Islamist militant organization al-Qaeda were influenced by the Wahhabi doctrine. Other scholars note that the ideology of al-Qaeda is Salafi jihadism that emerged as a synthesis of the Qutbist doctrine with Salafism. Western media often conflated Deobandi Jihadists of Taliban in Afghanistan with Wahhabis in the early 2000s; despite the fact that Taliban adhered to the doctrines of the Hanafi Deobandi movement. According to other sources, Salafis are fundamentally opposed to the ideology of Al-Qaeda. According to various Western media outlets, the ideology of Islamic State, a Salafi Jihadist militant organization, has also been inspired by Wahhabi doctrines, alongside Salafism, Qutbism, and Salafi jihadism.\nDuring the early years of post-9/11 hysteria, FBI had designated al-Qaeda as \"the number one terrorist threat to the United States\" and the neo-cons in the Bush Administration were able to incite hysterical narratives of \"Wahhabism\" through their expanded influence in politics and Western media. Neo-conservative journalist Lulu Schwartz and former U.S. Senator and Republican politician Jon Kyl claimed before a U.S. Senate Judiciary Subcommittee in June 2003 that \"Wahhabism is the source of the overwhelming majority of terrorist atrocities in today's world\". Their recommendations would become influential in Bush Administration's agenda for its \"Global War on Terrorism\".\nOn the other hand, contemporary Western historians and researchers have taken a more nuanced approach on the history and evolution of the \"Wahhabi\" movement; pointing out the discrepancy between the Ibn 'Abd al-Wahhab's teachings, some of his later followers and the actions of contemporary militant Jihadist groups. Various scholars assert that many writings of Ibn 'Abd al-Wahhab were revised during the 19th century by authorities of the Second Saudi State; transforming them away from a poetic-vernacular style of communication with mass appeal to a more rigid and purist understanding that aligned with the interests of the ruling class and the clerical establishment. David E. Long believes that modern Jihadist movements are more influenced by the ideological worldview of Egyptian Islamist extremism of the 20th century, rather than Ibn 'Abd al-Wahhab's socio-religious reformism. Although many Salafi-Jihadists maybe inspired by Wahhabi ideals, it doesn't credibly explain their inclinations towards lethal violence.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\nthe development of the hadith, whose importance cannot be overemphasized, incorporated dynamism into the very heart of Islam. When Ibn 'Abd al-Wahhab criticized local customs in Arabia on the basis of their incongruence with the past he was indeed trying to get back to a former golden age, but that is a very modern thing to do... What the Wahhabis were doing was to criticize current society and seek to undermine the existing order, something that the earlier Ibn Taymiyya fell foul of when for having similar views he was tortured and threatened with death.\n \u2014 Oliver Leaman, Professor of Philosophy at the University of Kentucky\nWestern scholars like Michael Ryan assert that Ibn 'Abd al-Wahhab's reformist teachings were a rationalist enterprise that sought to eradicate superstitions widespread in the context of tribal rivalry within the Arabian Peninsula. Moreover, the regional background of Ibn 'Abd al-Wahhab's intellectual efforts in the chaotic context of the 18th-century Arabian Peninsula had been distinct from the 21st century global Jihad ideology of organisations like Al-Qaeda or IS. Consequently, his scholarly heirs, including the prestigious Aal al-Shaykhs constitute the primary ideological nemesis of groups such as al-Qaeda. Since the Saudi population overwhelmingly prefers their traditional religious institutions and scholars to Bin Laden's claims to revolutionary Jihadi-Salafism; Al-Qaeda harshly attacks these mainstream Saudi clerics with much rhetorical vitriol.\nVarious scholars have also contested Orientalist portrayals of Wahhabi movement as \"ultra-conservative\" or \"stagnant\", noting its dynamic nature and capability of multiple interpretations. Professor Satoru Nakamura of Kobe University has criticized Orientalist scholars who depicted Ibn 'Abd al-Wahhab as a slavish imitator of Ibn Taymiyya, without studying the scholar's vast works and analysing historical nuances. Contemporary academic research in the Islamic studies field has found that Ibn 'Abd al-Wahhab's scholarly methodology were based on the moderation of \"Islamic Middle Way\" (\"Wasitiyya\").\nHis photo.\nSome alleged photos of Muhammad ibn Abd al-Wahhab have spread on the Internet, but no real photo of him has been proven, because the oldest surviving photograph of a camera dates back to 1826 or 1827, taken by Louis Daguerre; and that was thirty-five years after his death.\nContemporary recognition.\nMuhammad ibn Abd al-Wahhab's thoughts would greatly influence the pan-Islamic movement of the 19th century. The national mosque of Qatar is named after him. The \"Imam Muhammad ibn Abd al-Wahhab Mosque\" was opened in 2011, with the Emir of Qatar presiding over the occasion. The mosque has the capacity to host a congregation of 30,000 people. In 2017, there was a request published in the Saudi Arabian newspaper \"Okaz\" signed by 200 descendants of Ibn Abd al-Wahhab that the name of the mosque be changed, because according to their statement \"it does not carry its true Salafi path\", even though most Qataris adhere to Wahhabism.\nThe Turaif district in Diriyah, the capital of the First Saudi state, was declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2010. In 2011, Saudi Arabia announced its plans for large-scale development of Ibn 'Abd al-Wahhab's domain Diriyah; to establish a national cultural site in Diriyah and turn it into a major tourist attraction. Other features in the area include the \"Sheikh Muhammad bin Abdul Wahab Foundation\", which is planned to include a light and sound presentation located near the \"Mosque of Sheikh Mohammad bin Abdulwahab\".\nWorks.\nIbn 'Abd al-Wahhab has been described as a \"prolific writer\" whose scholarly treatises are collected into fourteen large volumes; which consists of various legal books, Qur'anic commentaries, creedal works, and compilation of \"fatwas\". Some of his major works include:\nSources.\nTwo of the earliest sources for the biography of Muhammad ibn 'Abd al-Wahhab and early history of the Wahhabi movement have been documented by its followers:\nA third account, covering Arabian history between the 1730s to 1817 is \"Lam' al-Shihab\" (The Brilliance of the Meteor) written by an anonymous author who respectfully disapproved of Ibn \u02bfAbd al-Wahhab's movement, regarding it as a \"bid'ah\" (heresy).\nIt is also commonly cited in Orientalist circles because it is considered to be a relatively objective and unofficial treatment of the subject. However, unlike Ibn Ghannam and Ibn Bishr, its author did not live in Najd and his work contains various tales, apocryphal and legendary materials concerning the details of Ibn \u02bfAbd al-Wahhab's life.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
